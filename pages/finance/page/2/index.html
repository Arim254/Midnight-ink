              <div><div><p>In 2024, <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@itslexib" target="_blank">Lexi Smith</a>, 24, was working as a teacher in Atlanta, Georgia, when she decided she was ready for a change of scenery.</p><p>Smith began exploring the possibility of teaching English abroad and worked with Xplore Asia, an organization that assists individuals in obtaining their TEFL (Teaching English as a Foreign Language) certification to work and study abroad.</p><p>"I wasn't quite loving the school system from having an overbearing administration that didn't appreciate me to having a hard time living on my salary," Smith tells CNBC Make It. "When I found out that I could teach abroad for a much easier life and the ability to see more culture, I had to jump on it."</p></div><div><p>Smith pays $238 a month for her one-bedroom, one-bathroom apartment.</p><p>Naotomo Umewaka for CNBC Make It</p></div><div><p>Smith got her TEFL certification and taught English as a foreign language in the U.S. for a bit while Xplore Asia worked to find her an employer abroad.</p><p>Eventually, Smith landed a teaching position at an eikaiwa, a private language school focused on conversational English, in the Chiba Prefecture of Japan and moved in March of this year.</p><p>The Chiba Prefecture is located on Japan's eastern Pacific coast to the east of Tokyo. It is about a four-hour drive from the country's capital city.</p><p>"Living in the countryside of the Chiba Prefecture is quite different than Tokyo. Things are a lot cheaper out here. The culture is more respectful, and what you see when you look around is rice fields," Smith says.</p></div><div><p>In lieu of an oven, Smith's kitchen has a mini grill.</p><p>Naotomo Umewaka for CNBC Make It</p></div><div><p>One of the perks of Smith's job was that her employer was able to secure her an apartment before she even got to Japan. It's a one-bedroom, one-bathroom apartment with a balcony and a walk-in closet that rents for 35,000 yen or $238 a month. The apartment is also within walking distance of the school where Smith teaches.</p><p>Smith admits she was nervous about moving to the countryside, having grown up in a city like Atlanta, but it was a much easier transition than she expected.</p><p>"I really did move here by myself without knowing the language or anyone here. My family knows that I'm a bit of a wild child, and I want to see the world. I'm a free spirit, so they accepted it," Smith says. "They were a little bit nervous for me, but after virtually meeting my boss and seeing how well prepared I was, they weren't that concerned anymore."</p></div><div><p>One of Smith's favorite design features of her apartment is her walk-in closet.</p><p>Naotomo Umewaka for CNBC Make It</p></div><div><p>Smith's employment contract includes her employer covering the costs of some expenses, like key money —a one-time, non-refundable payment given to the landlord when renting an apartment or house. Smith also didn't have to put down a security deposit, which is usually the case in the U.S. Her employer also pays for her fire insurance.</p><p>The apartment also came with a portable washer in her bathroom, and she uses the balcony to dry her clothes. One of the unique aspects of the apartment is that it came with an emergency bag containing items, like a safety helmet, needed in case of events like a tsunami, fire or earthquake.</p><p>Some of Smith's other monthly expenses include water, gas, electricity, health insurance, and groceries, which total approximately $376 a month.</p></div><div><p>Smith's apartment also has a balcony.</p><p>Naotomo Umewaka for CNBC Make It</p></div><div><p>Though Smith is enjoying her time in Japan, she already knows she will move back to Atlanta at the end of her one-year contract.</p><p>"There is a big part of me that does want to stay longer than a year in Japan, but there's so much of the world to see. As much as I love Japan, I can't wait to also expand myself to see the rest of the world as well," Smith says. </p><p>"I miss my family. We're really close-knit, so it's hard being 7,000 miles away from them, but also being a Southern girl, I miss my soul food so much. Japan's food is great, but there's nothing like a good collard green at the end of the day."</p><p>Smith still isn't sure what she'll do when she moves back to the U.S., but is considering pursuing a graduate degree or a return to teaching.</p><p>"I'm not quite sure what the future holds for me, but I'm excited to take whatever path it has," she says.</p></div><div><p>Smith's apartment came with an emergency kit in case of tsunamis, earthquakes and fires.</p><p>Naotomo Umewaka for CNBC Make It</p></div><div><p>One way that Smith is making sure she gets the most out of her experience living in Japan is by documenting her journey on social media, which is she started doing three months after relocating.</p><p>"I decided to start sharing my experience because people don't know what regular life is like. I feel that Tokyo gets a lot of viewership, but all of Japan isn't Tokyo. A lot of us live in the countryside and live regular lives, and I wanted to share that with the world. A lot of people are thinking about leaving the States and I wanted to share my perspective on it too," Smith says.</p></div><div><p>Since she started sharing her life in Japan on TikTok, Smith says the reception has been positive.</p><p>"A lot of people who live in Japan do see themselves in me. They feel like I am sharing the authentic Japanese experience and that means a lot to me that I can create that visibility where it might not otherwise exist," she says.</p><p>"And for other people who look like me, [they can] also feel empowered that they can do it too. I feel that knowing more about the place that you're going and seeing other people doing it can take some of the fear out of doing that move."</p><p><em>Conversions from Japanese yen to USD were done using the OANDA conversion rate of 147 Japanese yen to $1 USD on August 30, 2025.

                <div><div><p>Rachael De Foe, 31, works as a fractional head of communications.</p><p>Courtesy of Rachael De Foe.</p></div><div><p>In late 2019, Rachael De Foe was burnt out, so she took a leap of faith that many dream of but never do: she quit her nine-to-five job without anything lined up.</p><p>The Singapore-native had spent the past few years working in public relations at various companies, from large agencies to smaller boutique firms.</p><p>"Every single business was chasing what I now like to call the 'agency monster' ... You have too many clients, so you need [a bigger] team. You have too many team [members], so you need more clients. There's never equilibrium," De Foe told <a target="_blank" href="https://www.cnbc.com/make-it/">CNBC Make It</a>. "I had burned out more than once."</p><p>One day, she realized that she couldn't picture herself in her bosses' shoes. "That's just not the life that I wanted. So that's when I decided to quit at the end of 2019," she said.</p><p>Today, the 31-year-old works as a fractional head of communications through her public relations and communications company, Redefy, which she started in 2020. What she didn't expect was that this leap in the dark would eventually allow her to more than triple her income.</p><p>She went from making $72,000 Singaporean dollars (about $56,000) in her nine-to-five job to about $220,000 a year as her own boss, according to documents verified by <a target="_blank" href="https://www.cnbc.com/make-it/">CNBC Make It.</a></p></div><h2><a></a>'I had no plan'</h2><div><p>After leaving her job, De Foe thought she was going to take some time to decompress during the holiday season before finding another job in the new year.</p><p>"I had no plan, if I'm being quite honest ... my plan was to figure it out," she said. "At first I [thought] maybe I should look for a different job. But every time I looked at other jobs in the market, it just wasn't interesting, and I could see the same patterns happening again."</p><p>Then, all of a sudden a global pandemic hit in early 2020.</p><p>"I'll be honest, it was actually really scary at that point of time, because I think two of the functions [first] to be cut [during an] economic downturn, was both PR and HR ... so in my mind, I was like: 'Oh no, what am I going to do?"</p><p>However, this also presented a new opportunity for De Foe. As companies downsized and cut their PR and communications teams, many ultimately had to find leaner solutions.</p><p>"At the peak of Covid, essentially, I had founders and VCs reach out to me saying something along the lines of: 'Rachel, we just got rid of our agency, but we have this reputation problem ... Can you solve this problem?'" she recalls.</p><p>What started as some ad hoc freelancing turned into the next chapter of her career. She incorporated her own company and became a fractional head of communications.</p></div><h2><a></a>Why choose fractional work?</h2><div><p>While freelancers are hired to execute specific projects or hourly tasks, fractional workers are more embedded into a business — often helping to lead the overall strategy at a company. Also, as opposed to a permanent or staff employee, fractional workers contribute on a part-time basis for multiple businesses or clients.</p><p>"As a fractional head of [communications] ... I'm completely responsible for the communications function of a company. But because the company may not [need] a full time person, it's really up to me to make my own hours," De Foe explained. </p><p>"I answer to three CEOs, but I'm my own CEO at the same time," she said.</p><p>Going fractional has allowed De Foe to escape the cycle of burnout she experienced earlier in her career, she said. Instead of continuously chasing more clients or needing more people on the team, she now gets to choose whether or not to take specific clients or projects.</p><p>"In the past few years, it's been very interesting to see the shift in fractional as well, because people who used to be seniors at companies that I've worked for have started going the fractional route too," said De Foe.</p><p>She says that fractional work can make sense in a services-based businesses, because "you are the service," she said.</p><p>"You are the person that people want to work with, right? So it doesn't matter whether you're sitting under a [bigger] company or [if you're working alone]. People are looking for that interaction with you, and if you have [the experience or seniority], that's enough to start on your own," she said.</p><p>Her typical client load ranges from three to five companies at once. This model of working has not only afforded her more autonomy, but also more money.</p><p>In the past five years, she's earned more than $1.4 million Singapore dollars (about $1.1 million), according to documents verified by CNBC Make It.</p><p>"I'm never going back to one boss," said De Foe. "I'm a lot happier. I'm a lot more fulfilled, and I think more than anything — I feel like I can give myself the permission to chase the things that I want to."</p><p><em><strong>Want to be your own boss?</strong> Sign up for Smarter by CNBC Make It's new online course, </em><a href="https://smarter.cnbcmakeit.com/p/how-to-start-a-business-for-first-time-founders?utm_source=cnbc&amp;utm_medium=makeitarticle&amp;utm_campaign=bottom" target="_blank"><em>How To Start A Business: For First-Time Founders</em></a><em>.

But the good news is that damage done to telomeres as a result of chronic stress can be reversed.</p><p>"We can, on a daily basis, restore. Restore our cells, give ourselves breaks, create an anti-inflammatory lifestyle, so that we are slowing our aging. Or at least not letting all of the stressors we're exposed to, get under the skin, into our cells and accelerate aging," she said.</p><p>Here are some ways that she says you can de-stress and positively impact telomeres:</p><ol><li>Eat more fruits and vegetables</li><li>Create a meditative state by taking short breaks daily, even if it's just five minutes or through meditation</li><li>Add more more Omega-3s to your diet or trying a <a target="_blank" href="https://www.cnbc.com/2025/01/13/the-mediterranean-diet-is-the-no-1-diet-for-2025-why-its-so-popular-.html">Mediterranean diet</a></li><li>Prioritize deep rest with practices like being in a flow state through yoga or breathwork</li></ol><p>"It's these small changes that we can make, they're not huge lifestyle changes," Epel said.</p><p>"Those are the changes that we can maintain and keep over years and years."</p><p><em><strong>Want to be your own boss?</strong> Sign up for Smarter by CNBC Make It's new online course, </em><a href="https://smarter.cnbcmakeit.com/p/how-to-start-a-business-for-first-time-founders?utm_source=cnbc&amp;utm_medium=makeitarticle&amp;utm_campaign=bottom" target="_blank"><em>How To Start A Business: For First-Time Founders</em></a><em>.

"We are fully staffed for all existing client requirements and will operate in a business-as-usual mode."</p><p>JPMorgan's Toshi Jain also predicted that the impact, although modest, will be felt far beyond India's tech sector. </p><p>The economist said that a decline in the number of new H1-B visa holders will likely lead to a reduction in remittances sent to India.</p><p>Jain also sees a decline in Indian students choosing to go to the U.S. in the coming years, as the $100,000 visa fee may work as a new "tax" on finding a job in the U.S. post-education.</p></div></div>

                <div><div><p>In 2024, <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@itslexib" target="_blank">Lexi Smith</a>, 24, was working as a teacher in Atlanta, Georgia, when she decided she was ready for a change of scenery.</p><p>Smith began exploring the possibility of teaching English abroad and worked with Xplore Asia, an organization that assists individuals in obtaining their TEFL (Teaching English as a Foreign Language) certification to work and study abroad.</p><p>"I wasn't quite loving the school system from having an overbearing administration that didn't appreciate me to having a hard time living on my salary," Smith tells CNBC Make It. "When I found out that I could teach abroad for a much easier life and the ability to see more culture, I had to jump on it."</p></div><div><p>Smith pays $238 a month for her one-bedroom, one-bathroom apartment.</p><p>Naotomo Umewaka for CNBC Make It</p></div><div><p>Smith got her TEFL certification and taught English as a foreign language in the U.S. for a bit while Xplore Asia worked to find her an employer abroad.</p><p>Eventually, Smith landed a teaching position at an eikaiwa, a private language school focused on conversational English, in the Chiba Prefecture of Japan and moved in March of this year.</p><p>The Chiba Prefecture is located on Japan's eastern Pacific coast to the east of Tokyo. It is about a four-hour drive from the country's capital city.</p><p>"Living in the countryside of the Chiba Prefecture is quite different than Tokyo. Things are a lot cheaper out here. The culture is more respectful, and what you see when you look around is rice fields," Smith says.</p></div><div><p>In lieu of an oven, Smith's kitchen has a mini grill.</p><p>Naotomo Umewaka for CNBC Make It</p></div><div><p>One of the perks of Smith's job was that her employer was able to secure her an apartment before she even got to Japan. It's a one-bedroom, one-bathroom apartment with a balcony and a walk-in closet that rents for 35,000 yen or $238 a month. The apartment is also within walking distance of the school where Smith teaches.</p><p>Smith admits she was nervous about moving to the countryside, having grown up in a city like Atlanta, but it was a much easier transition than she expected.</p><p>"I really did move here by myself without knowing the language or anyone here. My family knows that I'm a bit of a wild child, and I want to see the world. I'm a free spirit, so they accepted it," Smith says. "They were a little bit nervous for me, but after virtually meeting my boss and seeing how well prepared I was, they weren't that concerned anymore."</p></div><div><p>One of Smith's favorite design features of her apartment is her walk-in closet.</p><p>Naotomo Umewaka for CNBC Make It</p></div><div><p>Smith's employment contract includes her employer covering the costs of some expenses, like key money —a one-time, non-refundable payment given to the landlord when renting an apartment or house. Smith also didn't have to put down a security deposit, which is usually the case in the U.S. Her employer also pays for her fire insurance.</p><p>The apartment also came with a portable washer in her bathroom, and she uses the balcony to dry her clothes. One of the unique aspects of the apartment is that it came with an emergency bag containing items, like a safety helmet, needed in case of events like a tsunami, fire or earthquake.</p><p>Some of Smith's other monthly expenses include water, gas, electricity, health insurance, and groceries, which total approximately $376 a month.</p></div><div><p>Smith's apartment also has a balcony.</p><p>Naotomo Umewaka for CNBC Make It</p></div><div><p>Though Smith is enjoying her time in Japan, she already knows she will move back to Atlanta at the end of her one-year contract.</p><p>"There is a big part of me that does want to stay longer than a year in Japan, but there's so much of the world to see. As much as I love Japan, I can't wait to also expand myself to see the rest of the world as well," Smith says. </p><p>"I miss my family. We're really close-knit, so it's hard being 7,000 miles away from them, but also being a Southern girl, I miss my soul food so much. Japan's food is great, but there's nothing like a good collard green at the end of the day."</p><p>Smith still isn't sure what she'll do when she moves back to the U.S., but is considering pursuing a graduate degree or a return to teaching.</p><p>"I'm not quite sure what the future holds for me, but I'm excited to take whatever path it has," she says.</p></div><div><p>Smith's apartment came with an emergency kit in case of tsunamis, earthquakes and fires.</p><p>Naotomo Umewaka for CNBC Make It</p></div><div><p>One way that Smith is making sure she gets the most out of her experience living in Japan is by documenting her journey on social media, which is she started doing three months after relocating.</p><p>"I decided to start sharing my experience because people don't know what regular life is like. I feel that Tokyo gets a lot of viewership, but all of Japan isn't Tokyo. A lot of us live in the countryside and live regular lives, and I wanted to share that with the world. A lot of people are thinking about leaving the States and I wanted to share my perspective on it too," Smith says.</p></div><div><p>Since she started sharing her life in Japan on TikTok, Smith says the reception has been positive.</p><p>"A lot of people who live in Japan do see themselves in me. They feel like I am sharing the authentic Japanese experience and that means a lot to me that I can create that visibility where it might not otherwise exist," she says.</p><p>"And for other people who look like me, [they can] also feel empowered that they can do it too. I feel that knowing more about the place that you're going and seeing other people doing it can take some of the fear out of doing that move."</p><p><em>Conversions from Japanese yen to USD were done using the OANDA conversion rate of 147 Japanese yen to $1 USD on August 30, 2025.

"We strongly disagree with any suggestion otherwise and are deeply concerned with the health risk this poses for expecting mothers."</p><p>Tylenol <a href="https://www.tylenol.com/contact-us" target="_blank">added a section to its site</a> addressing "recent media coverage," stating that there's "no proven link between taking acetaminophen and autism."</p><p>Kenvue CEO Kirk Perry met with Kennedy earlier this month to stress that message, and try to discourage him from including Tylenol as a potential cause of autism in an upcoming report on the disorder, according to a separate report from <a href="https://www.wsj.com/health/pharma/ceo-of-tylenol-maker-lobbied-rfk-jr-not-to-cite-drug-as-autism-cause-in-report-45be9a46?gaa_at=eafs&amp;gaa_n=ASWzDAgR1cgrTl8QpbE8Ss5mAxkIWFkB44X23p3qC9RqP21n72H8AZH0_nGBf0MtQNs%3D&amp;gaa_ts=68d06bfb&amp;gaa_sig=8Y0u3XiMN8AuKqhYc_dk1ylZCO66mJQs36OjIRd7zka11IO4-FSwNnqQQQ7hDhebabFOTvXRJXva5H5FSNp1cQ%3D%3D" target="_blank">The Wall Street Journal</a>.</p><p>Kenvue executives also said that there are few safe alternatives to acetaminophen to reduce fevers in pregnant women, the Journal reported.</p><p><a href="https://www.fda.gov/drugs/information-drug-class/acetaminophen" target="_blank">The Food and Drug Administration</a> and <a href="https://www.acog.org/news/news-articles/2021/09/response-to-consensus-statement-on-paracetamol-use-during-pregnancy" target="_blank">leading medical organizations</a> also have maintained that acetaminophen is safe during pregnancy when taken as directed but advise individuals to consult their health-care provider before using any over-the-counter drugs.</p><p>Kennedy has made autism a key focus of the HHS, pledging to "get to the bottom" of the neurodevelopmental condition's cause. He's shared <a href="https://www.factcheck.org/2025/09/the-facts-behind-claims-on-autism-tylenol-and-folate/" target="_blank">unsupported claims</a> about autism in the past surrounding its prevalence and its causes.</p><p><em>— CNBC's Annika Kim Constantino contributed reporting.</em></p></div></div>

"We are fully staffed for all existing client requirements and will operate in a business-as-usual mode."</p><p>JPMorgan's Toshi Jain also predicted that the impact, although modest, will be felt far beyond India's tech sector. </p><p>The economist said that a decline in the number of new H1-B visa holders will likely lead to a reduction in remittances sent to India.</p><p>Jain also sees a decline in Indian students choosing to go to the U.S. in the coming years, as the $100,000 visa fee may work as a new "tax" on finding a job in the U.S. post-education.</p></div></div>
