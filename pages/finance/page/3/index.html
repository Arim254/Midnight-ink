"The IPO dialogue is ramping and secondary selldown activity will continue to be strong."</p></div><div><p>The Swiss Stock Exchange in Zurich.</p><p>Fabrice Coffrini | Afp | Getty Images</p></div><div><p>Christoph Tonini, CEO of Swiss Marketplace Group, underlined the potential opportunities for existing shareholders as it went to market.</p><p>"The best way to make exit or participate in growth is to be in a listed company," Tonini told CNBC. "That's also why you're going to see all the four shareholders remain shareholders, but they will grow together with us."</p><p>"We have now new investors coming in, and we're going to deliver, also for them, value creation," he added.</p><p>The online advertising company priced its shares at 46 Swiss francs ($57.84) each, valuing the company at $5.7 billion. Shares ended Friday at 49 Swiss francs.</p></div><div><p><img src="https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/108201123-17582705401758270538-41717162357-1080pnbcnews.jpg?v=1758270539&amp;w=750&amp;h=422&amp;vtcrop=y" alt="Why Swiss Marketplace Group decided to go public" /><span></span><span><div><p><span>watch now</span><span></span></p></div></span></p></div><div><p>Aumovio, meanwhile, began trading at 35 euro ($41.11) a share with a $4.14 billion market cap, and shares closed the week at over 39 euros.</p><p>Aumovoi's Frankfurt rollout came as Sweden's market is set to see two imminent debuts.</p><p>Verisure, the private equity-backed Swiss alarms and security company, this week unveiled plans for a 3.1 billion euro listing on the Nasdaq Stockholm, with CEO Austin Lally saying it hoped to raise funds for international expansion.</p><p>"And also to pay down debt, to get the leverage levels and the balance sheet to a position where we think public investors will be comfortable, long term, supporting the company," Lally told CNBC on Wednesday.</p><p>Meanwhile, NOBA, the Swedish digital banking group, has also signalled its intention for a $3.7 billion splash on Stockholm's bourse.</p><p>"Now we will get some more publicity, which I think we will benefit from, also in our retail offerings, of course, in relation to to people out there, but also it clearly also gives us access, more clear access to the capital markets, as I think that's that's probably very good for us," NOBA CEO Jacob Lundblad told CNBC last week.</p></div><h2><a></a>Private vs. public</h2><div><p>The recent uptick in listings follows a prolonged period of sluggishness in Europe, which has been l<a target="_blank" href="https://www.cnbc.com/2025/09/15/ipos-are-booming-in-the-us-and-asia-is-europe-falling-behind.html"> the Asian and U.S. IPO markets</a>.</p><p>Between January and August this year, initial public offerings in North America raised $17.7 billion across 153 deals, while Europe has managed just $5.5 billion from 57 listings, according to data from FactSet.</p><p>"Clearly the level of IPO has been reducing significantly," Henri Marcoux, deputy CEO, Tikehau Capital, told CNBC last week. He contrasted the low number of public offerings with an upsurge in appetite for private assets. "The demand for private assets is increasing, both from private investors, private wealth, same for institutions."</p><p>German pharma business Stada and regional bank OLB recently cancelled plans to list, opting instead for the certainty of private sales.</p><p>However, Bank of America's Drake said there was evidence that investor perspectives on listings are improving.</p><p>Key drivers of this rebound include low volatility and enhanced dollar-based returns on European equity investments due to a weakened greenback versus the euro, which is helping attract fresh U.S. capital into the continent, he said.</p><p>As a result, Drake said activity continued to be broad-based across sectors, "particularly for high-quality, scale stories with attractive growth opportunities."</p><p>"What's not to like about the backdrop for equities and ECM [equity capital markets] right now?" he added.</p><p><em>— CNBC's David Martin, Michael Considine and Katrina Bishop contributed to this report.</em></p></div></div>

                <div><div><p>U.S. President Donald Trump speaks in the Oval Office at the White House in Washington, D.C., U.S., Sept. 19, 2025. </p><p>Ken Cedeno | Reuters</p></div><div><p>The Trump administration stepped in to stop U.S. Steel from idling operations at its Granite City, Ill., plant, exercising new powers tied to the company's recent takeover, <a href="https://www.wsj.com/business/trump-invokes-golden-share-to-block-u-s-steel-plans-for-illinois-plant-f6b661ed?mod=hp_lead_pos11" target="_blank">the Wall Street Journal reported</a>.</p><p>The steelmaker had informed nearly 800 workers that the plant would close in November, noting however that they would still be paid. But after Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick warned CEO Dave Burritt the administration wouldn't allow it, U.S. Steel reversed course on Friday, saying the facility would keep rolling slabs into sheet steel, the Journal reported, citing a person familiar with the matter.</p><p>The intervention marked Trump's first use of so-called "golden share" rights, a condition of <a target="_blank" href="https://www.cnbc.com/2025/06/13/trump-us-steel-nippon-deal.html">the $14.1 billion takeover by Japan's Nippon that cleared in June.</a> The national-security agreement gave the White House veto power over plant closures, offshore production shifts and other strategic decisions.</p><p>"U. S. Steel will continue to supply slabs to Granite City," a spokesperson for U.S. Steel told CNBC. "Our goal was to maintain flexibility, and we are pleased to have found a solution to continue to slab consumption at Granite City."</p><p>The move highlights Trump's growing hand in the private sector. Last month, the president said the government would <a target="_blank" href="https://www.cnbc.com/2025/08/22/intel-goverment-equity-stake.html">take a 10% stake in Intel,</a> after the chipmaker received billions in subsidies under the 2022 Chips Act.</p><p>In June, when the deal was announced, Trump told U.S. Steel workers that Nippon would be a "great partner." The Trump administration is currently engaged in trade talks with Japan as investors eagerly await signs that the U.S. will strike deals with key partners that avoid steep tariffs.</p><p>Trump told the steelworkers that Nippon had agreed to keep U.S. Steel's blast furnaces operating at full capacity for a minimum of 10 years. The president said the deal would not result in layoffs and promised there would be "no outsourcing whatsoever." At the time, he said workers would receive a $5,000 bonus.</p><p><a href="https://www.wsj.com/business/trump-invokes-golden-share-to-block-u-s-steel-plans-for-illinois-plant-f6b661ed?mod=hp_lead_pos11" target="_blank">Read the complete WSJ story here</a>.</p></div></div>

The one-year rate influences most new and outstanding loans, while the five-year benchmark affects mortgages.</p><p>The central bank last <a target="_blank" href="https://www.cnbc.com/2025/05/20/china-cuts-benchmark-lending-rates-for-the-first-time-in-7-months.html">trimmed the key lending rates by 10 basis points in May</a> as part of Beijing's efforts to shore up its economy.</p><p>The PBOC last Thursday kept the seven-day reverse repo rate, which serves as the main policy rate, unchanged, following the Fed's 25-basis-point cut.</p><p>The benchmark lending rates — normally charged to banks' best clients — are calculated monthly based on designated commercial banks' proposed rates submitted to the PBOC.</p><p>The decision Monday came in line with economists' expectations that Chinese authorities would hold off major stimulus measures amid a recent stock market rally, even as a string of economic data underscored signs of fatigue in the economy.</p><p>The benchmark CSI 300 index opened higher on Monday before edging down 0.24%. The offshore yuan strengthened slightly to 7.1161 against the U.S. dollar.</p><p>China's economic <a target="_blank" href="https://www.cnbc.com/2025/09/15/china-retail-sales-industrial-output-slow-in-august-missing-estimates-as-real-estate-slump-worsens.html">slowdown deteriorated in August</a> with a raft of key indicators missing expectations. Retail sales slowed to 3.4% in August as consumption remained weak, while industrial output growth eased to 5.2%, marking its weakest level since August last year.</p><p>In another sign of sluggish domestic demand, China's consumer prices <a target="_blank" href="https://www.cnbc.com/2025/09/10/china-cpi-august-deflation-.html">fell more than expected last month</a> while deflation in wholesale prices persisted for nearly three years.</p><p>The country's export growth slowed to 4.4% in August, marking their lowest growth rate since February, as the impact of frontloading shipments waned and the U.S. trade policy targeting transshipment weighed on exports to third countries.</p><p>The growth momentum significantly weakened in the third quarter as China's real estate slump worsened, Beijing's fiscal stimulus faded, and the crackdown on excess capacity curbed industrial output, said a team of Barclays economists, who noted that "almost all housing indicators deteriorated further" in August.</p></div><div><p><img src="https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/108201076-17582567021758256698-41714591656-1080pnbcnews.jpg?v=1758256701&amp;w=750&amp;h=422&amp;vtcrop=y" alt="'Nervous' about China hitting its growth target: JD's Economist" /><span></span><span><div><p><span>watch now</span><span></span></p></div></span></p></div><div><p>Economists largely expect Chinese policymakers to roll out marginal monetary easing later this year to ensure the world's second-largest economy hits the government's annual growth target of around 5%.</p><p>"Beijing's focus has shifted from risk management to growth stimulation, moving from tolerating deflation to reflating the economy," said Hong Hao, managing partner and CIO at Lotus Asset Management.</p><p>"China has reached a point where it must stop inefficient, debt-fueled asset accumulation and begin reducing unproductive investments," said Hao, expecting further policy stimulus in the coming months.</p><p>Barclays forecasts China's real GDP to grow 4.5% in 2025, citing a sharper-than-expected slowdown," even as "incremental policy support" is likely later this year.</p><p>The bank expects the PBOC to cut the seven-day reverse repo rate and loan prime rate by 10-basis points in the fourth quarter, along with a a 50-basis-point reduction in the reserve requirement ratio, which sets out how much cash banks must hold in reserve.</p></div></div>

"The IPO dialogue is ramping and secondary selldown activity will continue to be strong."</p></div><div><p>The Swiss Stock Exchange in Zurich.</p><p>Fabrice Coffrini | Afp | Getty Images</p></div><div><p>Christoph Tonini, CEO of Swiss Marketplace Group, underlined the potential opportunities for existing shareholders as it went to market.</p><p>"The best way to make exit or participate in growth is to be in a listed company," Tonini told CNBC. "That's also why you're going to see all the four shareholders remain shareholders, but they will grow together with us."</p><p>"We have now new investors coming in, and we're going to deliver, also for them, value creation," he added.</p><p>The online advertising company priced its shares at 46 Swiss francs ($57.84) each, valuing the company at $5.7 billion.

He contrasted the low number of public offerings with an upsurge in appetite for private assets. "The demand for private assets is increasing, both from private investors, private wealth, same for institutions."</p><p>German pharma business Stada and regional bank OLB recently cancelled plans to list, opting instead for the certainty of private sales.</p><p>However, Bank of America's Drake said there was evidence that investor perspectives on listings are improving.</p><p>Key drivers of this rebound include low volatility and enhanced dollar-based returns on European equity investments due to a weakened greenback versus the euro, which is helping attract fresh U.S. capital into the continent, he said.</p><p>As a result, Drake said activity continued to be broad-based across sectors, "particularly for high-quality, scale stories with attractive growth opportunities."</p><p>"What's not to like about the backdrop for equities and ECM [equity capital markets] right now?" he added.</p><p><em>— CNBC's David Martin, Michael Considine and Katrina Bishop contributed to this report.</em></p></div></div>
