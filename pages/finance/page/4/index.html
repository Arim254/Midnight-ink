At the time, she only had one year and eight classes to go before she graduated. This came as a shock to her Chinese immigrant parents.</p><p>"They [parents] sacrificed everything to immigrate from China to America to give their kids a better future, and because education gave them everything that they have in life, for their kids to suddenly let go of their education when they were almost done was like a slap in the face," she said.</p><p>Guo instead decided to pursue the Thiel Fellowship, a program launched by the billionaire co-founder of PayPal, Peter Thiel, which offers young people $200,000 to build innovative companies.</p><p>"I think they [parents] viewed that as a sign that I didn't love them, and they weren't very happy with it, when it was just me making a bet on myself and choosing to optimize for what I thought would be a better future for myself."</p><p>But even the billionaire college dropout sees some benefits to higher education.</p></div><h2><a></a>The best networking opportunity</h2><div><p> Guo said that going to college introduced her to a network that became even more valuable to her as a founder.</p><p>"My recommendation for people is that one to two years in college is actually just incredibly great, because you're going to make the best friends in college, and you're going to meet the smartest people in college," Guo said. "Everyone's going to college because they want to meet people."</p><p>She explained there's no other scenario where there's such a high concentration of smart people who are also looking to make friends.</p><p>"When you go to work at a new company, not everyone you're working with is looking for a new friend because they already have friends. If you never went to college, and you just dive into a city, you can go to these events and try to meet people, and it does work out. But, again, not everyone is desperate to make friends," she added.</p></div><h2><a></a>Future employees</h2><div><p>A company's greatest assets is the people it hires, and Guo says the best hiring pool is your college peers.</p><p>"Make sure to get to know your smartest peers and actually be friends with them. The best place to do this, I think personally, is actually in college," she said.</p><p>"I can't even think of one place where it's such a high density of people that are intelligent and that's the most likely place [college] where you're going to meet your future hires."</p><p>She says this network of intelligent friends will remain handy, because you'll already have a talented pool of people to hire.  </p><p>Guo said her peers on the two-year Thiel Fellowship program motivated her be successful as an entrepreneur.</p><p>"You become part of a community where it's so normal to build a unicorn company, because in order to build a company, you have to be a little crazy. You have to be so arrogant to believe that you have a shot at building a company that could be a unicorn. And it's easier to believe that, and to delude yourself, when you are surrounded by so many people that have, and that is, I think, the beauty of San Francisco and the Thiel Fellowship."</p><p>Other alumni of the program, like Guo, have gone on to produce unicorns — startups valued at over $1 billion — from Vitalik Buterin's Ethereum to Dylan Field's Figma and Ritesh Agarwal's Oyo Rooms.</p><p><em>This article is part of a series on billionaire Lucy Guo.

When it comes to buying a home, it's very similar in many ways to falling in love or choosing a partner," he says.</p><p>"There are so many boxes to check and sometimes you have to compromise but understanding what really matters and what your core values are and what the core characteristics of a partner or home is and being able to help someone discuss that and discover it for themselves and community it to me is a very meaningful bonus, having done it for the past 15 years."</p></div><div><p>Schulman started working as a licensed real estate agent in August of this year.</p><p>Coldwell Banker Warburg</p></div><div><p>Schulman says hosting "Catfish: The TV Show" taught him how to find workarounds that he is using now to do things like get appointments for his clients.</p><p>"I'm so used to being told no and hitting dead ends, especially when it comes to searching for things," he adds. "I think not getting discouraged and not taking no for an answer is a really good skill that I've built over the years making the show."</p><p>Getting into real estate was something that felt very natural to Schulman. He was born in New York City and grew up watching his dad, Robert Schulman, working as a broker at Coldwell Banker Warburg. His grandfather, Lowell Schulman, also worked in the industry, but as a builder and developer, before he died in 2017.</p><p>"I've grown up in the city and have lived in so many different neighborhoods. Life in New York City is so much about your apartment and your neighborhood. You really want to feel good about where you're going and your apartment becomes this sort of haven and place to recharge and I think that's why I've always loved it," Schulman says.</p><p>Schulman says his dad approached him about joining him at Coldwell Banker Warburg, and it made the "Catfish" star really start thinking about his future and what else he could do with his career.</p><p>"I thought this was the perfect time to give it a try, and here I am," he says.</p><p><em><strong>Want to be your own boss?</strong> Sign up for Smarter by CNBC Make It's new online course, </em><a href="https://smarter.cnbcmakeit.com/p/how-to-start-a-business-for-first-time-founders?utm_source=cnbc&amp;utm_medium=makeitarticle&amp;utm_campaign=bottom" target="_blank"><em>How To Start A Business: For First-Time Founders</em></a><em>.

                <div><div><p>If you're in the market for a premium travel credit card, get ready to pay an even heftier annual fee.</p><p>On Thursday, American Express <a target="_blank" href="https://www.cnbc.com/2025/09/18/american-express-platinum-card-refresh-895-fee-3500-perks.html">rolled out the latest version</a> of its Platinum card, which now comes with a $895 fee, up from $695. Earlier this summer, JPMorgan Chase <a target="_blank" href="https://www.cnbc.com/2025/06/17/chase-sapphire-reserve-credit-card-new-perks-fee.html">upped the annual charge</a> for its Sapphire Reserve card to $795.</p><p>If that's not money you're willing to part with, or if you know you won't be able to take full advantage of an expensive card's perks, you may be more comfortable with a lower-rung rewards card with a more modest fee.</p><p>But you shouldn't shy away from cards with fees altogether, says Brian Kelly, founder of The Points Guy. "Don't go 'no annual fee,'" he says. "I'm a big believer in cheaper is not better when it comes to credit cards."</p><p>Here's what he says are the biggest mistakes when it comes to maximizing rewards credit cards.</p></div><h2><a></a>Going the no-fee route</h2><div><p>Kelly doesn't think you should pay a fee just for the sake of paying one. But even those who take a casual approach to earning and redeeming benefits will likely find that a low annual fee is worth it, he says.</p><p>"No-annual-fee cards generally just don't have great rewards," he says. "For anyone who spends any amount of money, $95 a year for [a card] which is 2x on dining and travel, plus all the extra perks, is worth it."</p><p>To select a card that works for you, <a target="_blank" href="https://www.cnbc.com/2025/02/11/minimum-number-of-credit-cards-you-need-to-maximize-rewards.html">experts say to think about how you already spend</a>, and gravitate toward cards that offer more points for your most popular categories, which may include travel, dining out, groceries or gas.</p><p>Even if you already have a card that you think works for you, it's important to check in to see how your spending and reward preferences may have changed, Kelly says.</p><p>"People in general don't change their cards as their lifestyle changes," he says. "When people have kids, when people don't travel much or travel more, or they're retiring — they don't switch their credit cards to suit their lifestyle."</p></div><h2><a></a>Hoarding points</h2><div><p>If you already own a rewards card and you have a huge glut of points sitting around, it might mean that you need to switch to a different card. Or if you're using a premium card, one with a lower fee.</p><p>"If you're having a tough time using those points over the years and you have a huge balance and you haven't redeemed recently, I think that's a red flag," Kelly says. "You should be able to say, this currency works for the way I redeem points."</p><p>If you're saving the points on purpose, say, until you hit a particular number or have enough to cover a luxurious trip, you're likely making a big mistake, too, <a target="_blank" href="https://www.cnbc.com/2024/11/05/travel-planning-myths-you-can-ignore.html">credit experts say</a>. That's because rewards programs can change the value of points at will.</p><p>"You don't want to hoard points and miles," Ted Rossman, senior industry analyst at Bankrate, <a target="_blank" href="https://www.cnbc.com/2025/02/13/credit-card-points-mistakes-to-avoid.html">told CNBC Make It</a> in February. "You don't want to be a points millionaire. It's not like a 401(k)."</p></div><h2><a></a>Failing to negotiate</h2><div><p>If you're uncomfortable with your card's annual fee, you can always downgrade to a cheaper card — but you shouldn't do so without asking if your credit card issuer can help you out first, Kelly says.</p><p>"If you're on the fence, the first thing you want to do is, don't do anything," he says. "Call the credit card company and say you're thinking about canceling."</p><p>This may put you through to the retention department, but if it doesn't that's who you should ask to speak with, Kelly says. Once you tell them you're thinking about canceling, they may sweeten the deal to keep your business.</p><p>"Often they'll give you either discounts or points offers that'll make it a slam dunk, at least for another year," Kelly says. "And then you can come back the next year to reassess."</p><p><em><strong>Want to be your own boss?</strong> Sign up for Smarter by CNBC Make It's new online course, </em><a href="https://smarter.cnbcmakeit.com/p/how-to-start-a-business-for-first-time-founders?utm_source=cnbc&amp;utm_medium=makeitarticle&amp;utm_campaign=bottom" target="_blank"><em>How To Start A Business: For First-Time Founders</em></a><em>.

                <div><p>For some brides and grooms, the prospect of writing and publicly reciting their wedding vows can be daunting.</p><p>That's where Katelyn Peterson comes in.</p><p>Peterson, 37, is the founder and CEO of Wedding Words, a wedding vow and speech-writing business, and she's passionate about helping "tongue-tied" couples express themselves.</p><p>"I got into this business to help people put their heart into words," Peterson says.</p><p>Since founding Wedding Words eight years ago, Peterson has turned her writing talent into business bringing in six figures a year, and she's written over 700 speeches for couples, bridal party members and parents.</p><p>Peterson worked in sales for years before founding Wedding Words, but she's always considered herself "a writer at heart."</p><p>The catalyst for her career change came in 2017, when Peterson's father asked her for help writing her grandfather's eulogy.</p><p>Her father's original draft sounded "like it could have been written about anyone's dad or anyone's grandpa," Peterson recalls.</p><p>Peterson helped her father rewrite the eulogy to include meaningful memories and details about her grandfather.</p><p>Her father's response touched her: "He said, 'This is exactly what I wanted to say. I just didn't know how to put it into words,' and he had tears in his eyes," Peterson recalls.</p><p>That experience inspired Peterson to start Wedding Words just a few months later.</p><p>"I thought, there have to be other people that have these milestone moments that they really want to do emotional justice to, but they just don't know how to put it into words," she says.</p><h3><strong>Hitting 'an emotional chord'</strong></h3><p>One of the most common misconceptions Peterson hears about her work is that people who hire her "just don't care enough" to write their speeches themselves.</p><p>"I think it's quite the opposite," she says. "I think you care so much that you feel like you can't do it on your own."</p><p>Peterson begins her process with an introductory video call, during which she and the client talk about their goals for the speech, and Peterson teases out significant details and key stories to include.</p><p>The process is often emotional, Peterson says, and clients cry "all the time."</p><p>"We're hitting an emotional chord," she says. "We're getting somewhere deep, and that's a good thing."</p><p>After Peterson drafts the speech, she and the client go over revisions in another video call, before finalizing the speech and practicing it out loud.</p><p>"Writing is half of it, but it's also making sure your delivery is done in a way that hits those emotional and humorous beats," Peterson says.</p><p>By the end of the last call, clients almost always let out a visible sigh of relief, Peterson says.</p><p>"They're like, 'I feel so much better. I can't believe I'm actually excited to say this speech in front of 200 people,'" she says. "That's the moment that I know, OK, I did my job."</p><h3><strong>The need for 'human storytelling'</strong></h3><p>Starting a speech-writing business from scratch wasn't easy. In the beginning, Peterson spent hours scouring wedding Facebook groups in search of potential clients.</p><p>She took on her first clients for free, instead asking them to share a review or testimonial on her site.</p><p>"I found that people weren't ready to pay me to write something so personal without hearing what the experience is like from other people," she says.</p><p>Soon, Peterson was able to start charging a "nominal fee" of $350 for speechwriting services, and the business grew from there, she says.</p><p>Peterson currently charges $999 to write and edit wedding speeches, and $499 for a "Power Hour" editing session.</p><p>Wedding Words' monthly revenue was over $8,000 in August, according to documents reviewed by CNBC Make It, and the company consistently brings in six figures in gross revenue each year.</p><p>A point of pride for Peterson is that Wedding Words is entirely self-funded, and the business has been profitable since day one, she says.</p><p>Until this year, Peterson was the company's only employee — "I was super, super precious with not outsourcing my writing for the longest time," she says — but she realized that scaling the business would require some extra hands.</p><p>Peterson hired a full-time writer earlier this year, and she's in the process of onboarding a second.</p><p>"The goal is to be able to serve more clients more quickly and keep it a lower price point as a result," she says.</p><p>As a writer, Peterson's business has definitely been impacted by AI.</p><p>She says Wedding Words' blog has lost half of its web traffic in the past year, and some of her competitors are churning out content at a rapid rate using AI tools.</p><p>Still, Peterson is less concerned about AI impacting Wedding Words' long term revenue.</p><p>"The people that are happy using AI tools to write their wedding speech are not my clients," she says. "My clients value human storytelling."</p><p>"No matter what changes in the technical world, there is still a need for human touch and the human heart, and I don't think that that's ever gonna go away," she continues.</p><p><em><strong>Want to be your own boss?</strong> Sign up for Smarter by CNBC Make It's new online course, </em><a href="https://smarter.cnbcmakeit.com/p/how-to-start-a-business-for-first-time-founders?utm_source=cnbc&amp;utm_medium=makeitarticle&amp;utm_campaign=bottom" target="_blank"><em>How To Start A Business: For First-Time Founders</em></a><em>.

Based on her research, she&#39;s identified the nine things successful parents do to raise kids with strong social skills.</p>

                <div><div><p>Many parents think kids develop <a target="_blank" href="https://www.cnbc.com/2025/02/23/kids-with-the-best-people-skills-have-parents-who-do-these-things-therapist.html">strong social skills</a> from memorizing phrases like "please" and "thank you." But the real foundation is built much earlier, at home and through everyday interactions.</p><p>I've studied over <a target="_blank" href="https://www.cnbc.com/reem-raouda/">200 parent-child relationships</a>, and I'm a mother myself. I've found that kids learn to communicate and connect by watching how their parents behave. And being raised in an environment where <a target="_blank" href="https://www.cnbc.com/2025/05/25/ive-studied-over-200-kids-emotionally-safe-parenting-is-the-new-parenting-style-that-works-better-than-the-rest.html">emotional safety</a> and <a target="_blank" href="https://www.cnbc.com/2025/03/30/psychologist-parents-who-have-close-bonds-with-their-adult-kids-do-7-things.html">authentic connection</a> are modeled makes a world of difference.</p><p>Here are nine things that parents who raise kids with exceptional social skills do early on.</p></div><h2><a></a>1. They talk openly about feelings and emotions</h2><div><p>Kids learn emotional vocabulary when parents name and normalize feelings.</p><p>Parents who say things like, "I feel disappointed we can't go today, but I'll take a deep breath and try again tomorrow," are modeling <a target="_blank" href="https://www.cnbc.com/2025/09/14/ive-worked-with-over-1000-kids-the-no-1-phrase-to-validate-your-child-at-every-age.html">emotional regulation</a> in real time. It helps kids later express themselves with friends, like saying, "I'm sad you didn't play with me," instead of lashing out.</p></div><h2><a></a>2. They model empathy in everyday life</h2><div><p>Children absorb how parents treat others: the neighbor, the cashier, and even each other.</p><p>A simple, “She has her hands full, so let's hold the door for her,” teaches more about empathy than any lecture. Small daily acts of kindness become the blueprint for lifelong social awareness.</p></div><h2><a></a>3. They foster real, authentic confidence</h2><div><p>True confidence comes from being loved as you are and from being given the chance to try (and sometimes fail).</p><p>Letting kids try out for the team or pour their own milk, even if it gets messy, says: "I trust you." When paired with encouragement like, "I love how you kept trying," kids feel capable and connected, without needing to be perfect.</p></div><h2><a></a>4. They teach how to make things right after conflict</h2><div><p>Every relationship includes conflict. What matters is whether kids learn how to repair.</p><p>Parents who say, "You hurt your sister's feelings. Let’s think of what we can say or do to make it right," are teaching a critical life skill: Repair strengthens relationships, and kids who learn it early grow into adults who can sustain healthy bonds.</p></div><h2><a></a>5. They validate their child's feelings</h2><h2><a></a>6. They help their kids recognize social cues</h2><div><p>Kids don't always pick up on social dynamics naturally. Parents who gently point out, "Did you notice how his voice got quiet? He might be feeling shy," help kids tune into the subtleties of human interaction.</p><p>These micro-lessons add up and shape <a target="_blank" href="https://www.cnbc.com/2025/02/23/kids-with-the-best-people-skills-have-parents-who-do-these-things-therapist.html">socially aware</a>, <a target="_blank" href="https://www.cnbc.com/2023/07/27/quiz-do-you-have-high-emotional-intelligence.html">emotionally intelligent adults</a>.</p></div><h2><a></a>7. They don't rush in to solve every conflict for their child</h2><div><p>The second kids argue, the impulse is often to intervene. But the best social learning happens when parents step back just enough.</p><p>Saying, "I'm here if you need help, but I think you two can work it out," creates space for problem-solving and compromise. With time, kids learn they can handle conflict themselves because they were trusted to practice.</p></div><h2><a></a>8. They treat mistakes as learning opportunities</h2><div><p>When parents treat mistakes as evidence of growth, kids build resilience instead of shame.</p><p>A parent who calmly says, “You spilled the juice. Let’s grab a towel and clean it up,” models accountability without humiliation. Children raised this way see mistakes as opportunities to learn. That mindset makes them more adaptable and compassionate with others.</p></div><h2><a></a>9. They listen more than they lecture</h2><div><p>Kids need to see what good listening looks like.</p><p>When parents pause, make eye contact, give full attention (without rushing to fix or interrupt) and say, "Tell me more about that," they teach how to be patient and respectful. Over time, kids carry this into friendships, becoming the kind of people others feel safe opening up to.</p><p>Good social skills are becoming more and more important in today's world, and those skills grow from connection and emotional safety. By practicing early, you're ensuring that your kid will grow up to be empathetic humans who are ready for real-world relationships.</p><p><a href="https://www.highloveparenting.com/" target="_blank"><em><strong>Reem Raouda</strong></em></a><em> is a leading voice in conscious parenting and the creator of </em><a href="https://parentingwithreem.com/foundations" target="_blank"><em>FOUNDATIONS</em></a><em>, a step-by-step guide that helps parents heal and become emotionally safe. She is widely recognized for her expertise in children's emotional safety and for redefining what it means to raise emotionally healthy kids.

At the time, she only had one year and eight classes to go before she graduated. This came as a shock to her Chinese immigrant parents.</p><p>"They [parents] sacrificed everything to immigrate from China to America to give their kids a better future, and because education gave them everything that they have in life, for their kids to suddenly let go of their education when they were almost done was like a slap in the face," she said.</p><p>Guo instead decided to pursue the Thiel Fellowship, a program launched by the billionaire co-founder of PayPal, Peter Thiel, which offers young people $200,000 to build innovative companies.</p><p>"I think they [parents] viewed that as a sign that I didn't love them, and they weren't very happy with it, when it was just me making a bet on myself and choosing to optimize for what I thought would be a better future for myself."</p><p>But even the billionaire college dropout sees some benefits to higher education.</p></div><h2><a></a>The best networking opportunity</h2><div><p> Guo said that going to college introduced her to a network that became even more valuable to her as a founder.</p><p>"My recommendation for people is that one to two years in college is actually just incredibly great, because you're going to make the best friends in college, and you're going to meet the smartest people in college," Guo said. "Everyone's going to college because they want to meet people."</p><p>She explained there's no other scenario where there's such a high concentration of smart people who are also looking to make friends.</p><p>"When you go to work at a new company, not everyone you're working with is looking for a new friend because they already have friends. If you never went to college, and you just dive into a city, you can go to these events and try to meet people, and it does work out. But, again, not everyone is desperate to make friends," she added.</p></div><h2><a></a>Future employees</h2><div><p>A company's greatest assets is the people it hires, and Guo says the best hiring pool is your college peers.</p><p>"Make sure to get to know your smartest peers and actually be friends with them. The best place to do this, I think personally, is actually in college," she said.</p><p>"I can't even think of one place where it's such a high density of people that are intelligent and that's the most likely place [college] where you're going to meet your future hires."</p><p>She says this network of intelligent friends will remain handy, because you'll already have a talented pool of people to hire.  </p><p>Guo said her peers on the two-year Thiel Fellowship program motivated her be successful as an entrepreneur.</p><p>"You become part of a community where it's so normal to build a unicorn company, because in order to build a company, you have to be a little crazy. You have to be so arrogant to believe that you have a shot at building a company that could be a unicorn. And it's easier to believe that, and to delude yourself, when you are surrounded by so many people that have, and that is, I think, the beauty of San Francisco and the Thiel Fellowship."</p><p>Other alumni of the program, like Guo, have gone on to produce unicorns — startups valued at over $1 billion — from Vitalik Buterin's Ethereum to Dylan Field's Figma and Ritesh Agarwal's Oyo Rooms.</p><p><em>This article is part of a series on billionaire Lucy Guo.

When it comes to buying a home, it's very similar in many ways to falling in love or choosing a partner," he says.</p><p>"There are so many boxes to check and sometimes you have to compromise but understanding what really matters and what your core values are and what the core characteristics of a partner or home is and being able to help someone discuss that and discover it for themselves and community it to me is a very meaningful bonus, having done it for the past 15 years."</p></div><div><p>Schulman started working as a licensed real estate agent in August of this year.</p><p>Coldwell Banker Warburg</p></div><div><p>Schulman says hosting "Catfish: The TV Show" taught him how to find workarounds that he is using now to do things like get appointments for his clients.</p><p>"I'm so used to being told no and hitting dead ends, especially when it comes to searching for things," he adds. "I think not getting discouraged and not taking no for an answer is a really good skill that I've built over the years making the show."</p><p>Getting into real estate was something that felt very natural to Schulman. He was born in New York City and grew up watching his dad, Robert Schulman, working as a broker at Coldwell Banker Warburg. His grandfather, Lowell Schulman, also worked in the industry, but as a builder and developer, before he died in 2017.</p><p>"I've grown up in the city and have lived in so many different neighborhoods. Life in New York City is so much about your apartment and your neighborhood. You really want to feel good about where you're going and your apartment becomes this sort of haven and place to recharge and I think that's why I've always loved it," Schulman says.</p><p>Schulman says his dad approached him about joining him at Coldwell Banker Warburg, and it made the "Catfish" star really start thinking about his future and what else he could do with his career.</p><p>"I thought this was the perfect time to give it a try, and here I am," he says.</p><p><em><strong>Want to be your own boss?</strong> Sign up for Smarter by CNBC Make It's new online course, </em><a href="https://smarter.cnbcmakeit.com/p/how-to-start-a-business-for-first-time-founders?utm_source=cnbc&amp;utm_medium=makeitarticle&amp;utm_campaign=bottom" target="_blank"><em>How To Start A Business: For First-Time Founders</em></a><em>.

                <div><div><p>Many parents think kids develop <a target="_blank" href="https://www.cnbc.com/2025/02/23/kids-with-the-best-people-skills-have-parents-who-do-these-things-therapist.html">strong social skills</a> from memorizing phrases like "please" and "thank you." But the real foundation is built much earlier, at home and through everyday interactions.</p><p>I've studied over <a target="_blank" href="https://www.cnbc.com/reem-raouda/">200 parent-child relationships</a>, and I'm a mother myself. I've found that kids learn to communicate and connect by watching how their parents behave. And being raised in an environment where <a target="_blank" href="https://www.cnbc.com/2025/05/25/ive-studied-over-200-kids-emotionally-safe-parenting-is-the-new-parenting-style-that-works-better-than-the-rest.html">emotional safety</a> and <a target="_blank" href="https://www.cnbc.com/2025/03/30/psychologist-parents-who-have-close-bonds-with-their-adult-kids-do-7-things.html">authentic connection</a> are modeled makes a world of difference.</p><p>Here are nine things that parents who raise kids with exceptional social skills do early on.</p></div><h2><a></a>1. They talk openly about feelings and emotions</h2><div><p>Kids learn emotional vocabulary when parents name and normalize feelings.</p><p>Parents who say things like, "I feel disappointed we can't go today, but I'll take a deep breath and try again tomorrow," are modeling <a target="_blank" href="https://www.cnbc.com/2025/09/14/ive-worked-with-over-1000-kids-the-no-1-phrase-to-validate-your-child-at-every-age.html">emotional regulation</a> in real time. It helps kids later express themselves with friends, like saying, "I'm sad you didn't play with me," instead of lashing out.</p></div><h2><a></a>2. They model empathy in everyday life</h2><div><p>Children absorb how parents treat others: the neighbor, the cashier, and even each other.</p><p>A simple, “She has her hands full, so let's hold the door for her,” teaches more about empathy than any lecture. Small daily acts of kindness become the blueprint for lifelong social awareness.</p></div><h2><a></a>3. They foster real, authentic confidence</h2><div><p>True confidence comes from being loved as you are and from being given the chance to try (and sometimes fail).</p><p>Letting kids try out for the team or pour their own milk, even if it gets messy, says: "I trust you." When paired with encouragement like, "I love how you kept trying," kids feel capable and connected, without needing to be perfect.</p></div><h2><a></a>4. They teach how to make things right after conflict</h2><div><p>Every relationship includes conflict. What matters is whether kids learn how to repair.</p><p>Parents who say, "You hurt your sister's feelings. Let’s think of what we can say or do to make it right," are teaching a critical life skill: Repair strengthens relationships, and kids who learn it early grow into adults who can sustain healthy bonds.</p></div><h2><a></a>5. They validate their child's feelings</h2><h2><a></a>6. They help their kids recognize social cues</h2><div><p>Kids don't always pick up on social dynamics naturally. Parents who gently point out, "Did you notice how his voice got quiet? He might be feeling shy," help kids tune into the subtleties of human interaction.</p><p>These micro-lessons add up and shape <a target="_blank" href="https://www.cnbc.com/2025/02/23/kids-with-the-best-people-skills-have-parents-who-do-these-things-therapist.html">socially aware</a>, <a target="_blank" href="https://www.cnbc.com/2023/07/27/quiz-do-you-have-high-emotional-intelligence.html">emotionally intelligent adults</a>.</p></div><h2><a></a>7. They don't rush in to solve every conflict for their child</h2><div><p>The second kids argue, the impulse is often to intervene. But the best social learning happens when parents step back just enough.</p><p>Saying, "I'm here if you need help, but I think you two can work it out," creates space for problem-solving and compromise. With time, kids learn they can handle conflict themselves because they were trusted to practice.</p></div><h2><a></a>8. They treat mistakes as learning opportunities</h2><div><p>When parents treat mistakes as evidence of growth, kids build resilience instead of shame.</p><p>A parent who calmly says, “You spilled the juice. Let’s grab a towel and clean it up,” models accountability without humiliation. Children raised this way see mistakes as opportunities to learn. That mindset makes them more adaptable and compassionate with others.</p></div><h2><a></a>9. They listen more than they lecture</h2><div><p>Kids need to see what good listening looks like.</p><p>When parents pause, make eye contact, give full attention (without rushing to fix or interrupt) and say, "Tell me more about that," they teach how to be patient and respectful. Over time, kids carry this into friendships, becoming the kind of people others feel safe opening up to.</p><p>Good social skills are becoming more and more important in today's world, and those skills grow from connection and emotional safety. By practicing early, you're ensuring that your kid will grow up to be empathetic humans who are ready for real-world relationships.</p><p><a href="https://www.highloveparenting.com/" target="_blank"><em><strong>Reem Raouda</strong></em></a><em> is a leading voice in conscious parenting and the creator of </em><a href="https://parentingwithreem.com/foundations" target="_blank"><em>FOUNDATIONS</em></a><em>, a step-by-step guide that helps parents heal and become emotionally safe. She is widely recognized for her expertise in children's emotional safety and for redefining what it means to raise emotionally healthy kids.

                <div><div><p>If you're in the market for a premium travel credit card, get ready to pay an even heftier annual fee.</p><p>On Thursday, American Express <a target="_blank" href="https://www.cnbc.com/2025/09/18/american-express-platinum-card-refresh-895-fee-3500-perks.html">rolled out the latest version</a> of its Platinum card, which now comes with a $895 fee, up from $695. Earlier this summer, JPMorgan Chase <a target="_blank" href="https://www.cnbc.com/2025/06/17/chase-sapphire-reserve-credit-card-new-perks-fee.html">upped the annual charge</a> for its Sapphire Reserve card to $795.</p><p>If that's not money you're willing to part with, or if you know you won't be able to take full advantage of an expensive card's perks, you may be more comfortable with a lower-rung rewards card with a more modest fee.</p><p>But you shouldn't shy away from cards with fees altogether, says Brian Kelly, founder of The Points Guy. "Don't go 'no annual fee,'" he says. "I'm a big believer in cheaper is not better when it comes to credit cards."</p><p>Here's what he says are the biggest mistakes when it comes to maximizing rewards credit cards.</p></div><h2><a></a>Going the no-fee route</h2><div><p>Kelly doesn't think you should pay a fee just for the sake of paying one. But even those who take a casual approach to earning and redeeming benefits will likely find that a low annual fee is worth it, he says.</p><p>"No-annual-fee cards generally just don't have great rewards," he says. "For anyone who spends any amount of money, $95 a year for [a card] which is 2x on dining and travel, plus all the extra perks, is worth it."</p><p>To select a card that works for you, <a target="_blank" href="https://www.cnbc.com/2025/02/11/minimum-number-of-credit-cards-you-need-to-maximize-rewards.html">experts say to think about how you already spend</a>, and gravitate toward cards that offer more points for your most popular categories, which may include travel, dining out, groceries or gas.</p><p>Even if you already have a card that you think works for you, it's important to check in to see how your spending and reward preferences may have changed, Kelly says.</p><p>"People in general don't change their cards as their lifestyle changes," he says. "When people have kids, when people don't travel much or travel more, or they're retiring — they don't switch their credit cards to suit their lifestyle."</p></div><h2><a></a>Hoarding points</h2><div><p>If you already own a rewards card and you have a huge glut of points sitting around, it might mean that you need to switch to a different card. Or if you're using a premium card, one with a lower fee.</p><p>"If you're having a tough time using those points over the years and you have a huge balance and you haven't redeemed recently, I think that's a red flag," Kelly says. "You should be able to say, this currency works for the way I redeem points."</p><p>If you're saving the points on purpose, say, until you hit a particular number or have enough to cover a luxurious trip, you're likely making a big mistake, too, <a target="_blank" href="https://www.cnbc.com/2024/11/05/travel-planning-myths-you-can-ignore.html">credit experts say</a>. That's because rewards programs can change the value of points at will.</p><p>"You don't want to hoard points and miles," Ted Rossman, senior industry analyst at Bankrate, <a target="_blank" href="https://www.cnbc.com/2025/02/13/credit-card-points-mistakes-to-avoid.html">told CNBC Make It</a> in February. "You don't want to be a points millionaire. It's not like a 401(k)."</p></div><h2><a></a>Failing to negotiate</h2><div><p>If you're uncomfortable with your card's annual fee, you can always downgrade to a cheaper card — but you shouldn't do so without asking if your credit card issuer can help you out first, Kelly says.</p><p>"If you're on the fence, the first thing you want to do is, don't do anything," he says. "Call the credit card company and say you're thinking about canceling."</p><p>This may put you through to the retention department, but if it doesn't that's who you should ask to speak with, Kelly says. Once you tell them you're thinking about canceling, they may sweeten the deal to keep your business.</p><p>"Often they'll give you either discounts or points offers that'll make it a slam dunk, at least for another year," Kelly says. "And then you can come back the next year to reassess."</p><p><em><strong>Want to be your own boss?</strong> Sign up for Smarter by CNBC Make It's new online course, </em><a href="https://smarter.cnbcmakeit.com/p/how-to-start-a-business-for-first-time-founders?utm_source=cnbc&amp;utm_medium=makeitarticle&amp;utm_campaign=bottom" target="_blank"><em>How To Start A Business: For First-Time Founders</em></a><em>.
