   <p>Canada, the U.K., Australia and other countries on Sunday announced they will formally recognize Palestine as a state — a move that has long been opposed by the U.S. and Israel.</p>   <p>"We recognized the State of Israel more than 75 years ago as a homeland for the Jewish people. Today we join over 150 countries who recognize a Palestinian State also. A pledge to the Palestinian and Israeli people, that there can be a better future," U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer said in a speech on Sunday.</p>   <p>Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney said Sunday recognizing Palestine as a state "empowers those who seek peaceful coexistence and the end of Hamas."</p>   
   <p>"This in no way legitimises terrorism, nor is it any reward for it. Furthermore, it in no way compromises Canada's steadfast support for the State of Israel, its people, and their security — security that can only ultimately be guaranteed through the achievement of a comprehensive two-state solution," Carney <a href="https://www.pm.gc.ca/en/news/statements/2025/09/21/statement-prime-minister-carney-on-canada-recognition-state-palestine" target="_blank">said in a statement</a>.</p>   <p>Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese said Sunday that opening embassies and establishing diplomatic relations will be considered as the Palestinian Authority makes progress on its commitment to reform.</p>   <p>"Already, crucial work is underway across the international community to develop a credible peace plan that enables the reconstruction of Gaza, builds the capacity of the state of Palestine and guarantees the security of Israel," Albanese said in a <a href="https://www.foreignminister.gov.au/minister/penny-wong/media-release/australia-recognises-state-palestine" target="_blank">statement</a>.</p>   <p>The designation from U.S. allies follows Starmer's meeting with President Trump last week. After their meeting, Trump said he wanted the war in Gaza to end but disagreed with plans to recognize Palestine as a state.</p>   <p>"I have a disagreement with the prime minister on that score," Trump said during a press conference.</p>   <p>World leaders will meet for the UN General Assembly on Tuesday, with more countries, including France, expected to formally recognize Palestine as a state in the coming days. More than 140 of 193 UN member states already recognize Palestine as a state.</p>   
   <p>French President Emmanuel Macron said in July France would announce the designation at the assembly, <a href="https://x.com/EmmanuelMacron/status/1948482142356603089" target="_blank">posting on X</a> that recognizing Israel and Palestine will contribute to "the security of all in the region."</p>   <p>Portugal's Ministry of Foreign Affairs also <a href="https://portaldiplomatico.mne.gov.pt/comunicacao-e-media/comunciados-de-imprensa/comunicado-reconhecimento-do-estado-da-palestina" target="_blank">announced on Friday</a> that it would formally recognize Palestine as a state.</p>   <div>

   <h2><strong>Israeli and Palestinian reactions</strong></h2>   <p>News that countries had formally recognized Palestine as a state was praised by Palestinian officials.</p>   <p>Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas stressed in multiple statements that it will help pave the way for a two-state solution, and allow Palestine to live "side by side with the State of Israel in security, peace and good neighborliness."</p>   
   <p>In the Israeli-occupied West Bank, reaction among Palestinians was mixed. Sara Mohammed, a 20-year-old computer engineering student at Birzeit University near Ramallah, told NPR that she wants to see more concrete action. </p>   <p>"We want people to speak up to change something — not to just say it and move on," she said. </p>   <p>The muted mood in the West Bank — where there are now more than 1,200 Israeli-manned checkpoints and gates, making travel very difficult — is a far cry from celebrations that broke out back in 2012 when the UN upgraded Palestine to observer state status.</p>   <p>Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu denounced the countries' new designation, saying on Sunday in a message<a href="https://x.com/IsraeliPM_heb/status/1969790851938386153" target="_blank"> posted on X</a> that "there will be no Palestinian state west of the Jordan."</p>   <p>"I have a clear message to those leaders who recognize a Palestinian state after the terrible massacre of October 7: You are giving a huge reward to terrorism," Netanyahu said. "The response to the latest attempt to impose a terrorist state on us in the heart of our country will be given after my return from the US. We will wait."</p>   <p>And as the countries announced the recognition, Israel launched an attack on Gaza City, killing more than 40 people, according to <a href="https://apnews.com/article/israel-palestinians-hamas-war-news-09-21-2025-6697b72cb308da276e6e4c9409fcf5c9" target="_blank">The Associated Press</a>.</p>

      <p>Many protestors responding to "Operation Midway Blitz," the stepped-up immigration enforcement in Chicago, are politically active for the first time in their lives.</p>   
</div><div>
    <p>AYESHA RASCOE, HOST: </p><p> Chicago has a long, proud history of activism and is considered by many the birthplace of community organizing. So it's no surprise that there's fierce opposition in the city to increased immigration enforcement. On Friday, Immigration and Customs Enforcement - or ICE - said it made 400 arrests since it launched Operation Midway Blitz two weeks ago. Resistance in the city is attracting many who are becoming politically active for the first time, as Jessica Pupovac reports.</p><p>(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED PROTESTER: (Chanting) No more suspicion (ph)...</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED PROTESTERS: (Chanting) No more suspicion (ph)...</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED PROTESTER: ...(Chanting) From fascist politicians.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED PROTESTERS: ...(Chanting) From fascist politicians.</p><p>JESSICA PUPOVAC: Outside an ICE processing facility in the Chicago suburb of Broadview, armed federal agents in tactical gear and gas masks recently stared down about 50 demonstrators. Jose Richter (ph) stood toward the front, wearing a pro-Second Amendment hat. He was in his work clothes, a black security guard uniform with an American flag on the sleeve.</p><p>JOSE RICHTER: I do security at Navy Pier.</p><p>PUPOVAC: Have you been to many protests?</p><p>RICHTER: No. This is my first one.</p><p>PUPOVAC: Richter is a U.S. Army veteran, born in Mexico and adopted by a U.S. family as a child. He has legal status but said he's standing up for those who don't.</p><p>RICHTER: I never seen this, how they discriminate if you're Latino and looking at you like a criminal. That's not right. My old friends, they got deported already. They went to court. Not even 10 minutes, they were out of the courthouse, sent back to Mexico. And it shouldn't be like that. We're not in Russia. They need to stop it.</p><p>PUPOVAC: The Trump administration's crackdown on illegal immigration has sparked a wave of new organizing here and inspired many first-time activists like Richter and Kevin Naglich. Naglich used to work in cybersecurity. Now he's devoting most of his time to resisting Trump's second-term agenda, including his call for mass deportations.</p><p>KEVIN NAGLICH: Right out of the gate, this time was, you know, attacking all these pillars of democracy. I was just like, OK, well, I can either sit around, feel bad and do nothing or try to make a difference, and I chose the latter.</p><p>PUPOVAC: So he got to work. In February, Naglich started a northwest Chicago chapter of the progressive pro-Democracy group Indivisible. He says it's already attracted more than 3,000 members, most of them brand new to activism. And he's not alone. Other groups are forming networks to support their immigrant neighbors, canvassing door to door, helping them get their IDs and guardianship paperwork in order and walking children of immigrant parents to school if they're afraid to leave their homes. Others are protesting almost daily - outside a suburban hotel where ICE agents are believed to be staying, at the naval base north of Chicago where they train and at this ICE processing facility just west of the city.</p><p>(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)</p><p>RACHEL COHEN: And I am so proud to be a Chicagoan. I am so proud...</p><p>PUPOVAC: Attorney Rachel Cohen is another new activist.</p><p>COHEN: And I am so proud to be in a community that shows up and says absolutely not.</p><p>PUPOVAC: Earlier this year, Cohen was a corporate finance attorney at one of the country's largest firms. But then her former firm pledged $100 million in pro bono legal services to causes backed by Trump after the White House threatened sanctions. She said that capitulation kept her up at night, and eventually it changed her life. She publicly quit her job in March and has since devoted herself to resisting the president's agenda, plugging into local efforts and sharing what she learns with her growing TikTok following.</p><p>COHEN: When you get off your couch and you stop scrolling and you plug into the community, you realize that things are very bad. But there are so many people who also see that for what it is, and you're motivated to keep going and keep showing up.</p><p>PUPOVAC: ICE agents have continued making arrests in Chicago and the suburbs this week, though it is unclear exactly how many. A DHS spokesperson told NPR the number is in the hundreds across Illinois. DHS Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin this week blasted what she called the demonization of ICE agents by the media and, quote, "leftist groups and sanctuary politicians." She says it puts ICE agents at risk and undermines public safety and national security. But Cohen and other activists here say they have no intention of stopping.</p><p>For NPR News, I'm Jessica Pupovac in Chicago.</p><p>(SOUNDBITE OF SHOOK'S "WIND ON THE WATER")</p>

      <p>NPR's Ayesha Rascoe asks Minnesota lawmakers Lisa Demuth and Erin Murphy about prospects for gun violence legislation in a special session.</p>   
</div><div>
    <p>AYESHA RASCOE, HOST: </p><p> Students returned to classrooms at Annunciation Catholic School in Minneapolis on Tuesday for the first time since a gunman killed two children and injured 21 other students and parishioners at a mass there. Tuesday was also the day voters filled the seat left vacant by the murder of Minnesota lawmaker Melissa Hortman. Speaker Emerita Hortman was shot in her home earlier this summer, the same night state Senator John Hoffman was also shot and injured in his home. Now Governor Tim Walz says he wants a special session of the legislature to address the state's gun laws. Republican Lisa Demuth is Minnesota's current House speaker, and she joins us now. Welcome.</p><p>LISA DEMUTH: Thank you, Ayesha. Good to talk with you.</p><p>RASCOE: And on the other side of the Capitol and the aisle is state Senator Erin Murphy, a Democrat. Welcome to you, as well.</p><p>ERIN MURPHY: It's good to be with you.</p><p>RASCOE: So for both of you, I mean, so much has happened in your state in the last few months, how are you both doing?</p><p>DEMUTH: In Minnesota, that is such a common question that we get, and I fail to come up with the correct answer. I don't know that there is a right answer, but I think as we continue to heal, we are resilient, but it is a very painful time.</p><p>RASCOE: And Senator Murphy?</p><p>MURPHY: I think the best answer I can give is I'm doing well enough today. And I'd served with Speaker Emerita Hortman for all of my career, and she was well known and deeply loved. The recovery for all of us is going to take some time.</p><p>RASCOE: Speaker Demuth, I know you had a special and a close relationship with Melissa Hortman, as well.</p><p>DEMUTH: I did. When I first came into the legislature in 2019, Speaker Emerita Hortman was the speaker then. She is the only one that I served under until we came back this year in the tie, and I became speaker of the House. But our working relationship really developed in 2023, when my party was in the minority. Speaker Hortman, at the time, they were in the full majority in the state. And yet as a new minority leader, she reached out to me and said, I want to meet weekly with you.</p><p>And she didn't need my votes, but it was important to her that we would develop a working relationship. Even though we didn't agree politically, we found common ground what could we get done or kind of where we were both at on issues, but also things outside of that. Her love for gardening. Her love for dogs. Common things - talking about just being parents. And so that relationship and the way she led as a leader has really formed the way I do my work as speaker of the House now.</p><p>RASCOE: Talking about working across the aisles, like, if Governor Walz does call a special session on gun violence, what realistically could be accomplished?</p><p>DEMUTH: The way that we are looking at it in the House, specifically House Republicans, is it's broader than that. We have to look at mental health. We also have to look at keeping our schools safe and then punishing criminals. There was a tragedy in my community, in my schools, in 2003, and I had children in the building. And so I don't just say this as an elected official or speaker of the House. It is a much broader issue of mental health and how we treat each other.</p><p>RASCOE: And just to follow up on that. So your own children were affected by a school shooting, and it was in Cold Spring, Minnesota, in 2003?</p><p>DEMUTH: That is correct. I had two high school students in the building at the time, and then I had two elementary students that were just across the parking lot. And so as a family and as a community, we've lived that. So I understand it from a little bit different perspective, and that's what I bring into the work that we do in the legislature also.</p><p>RASCOE: Did someone die in that shooting?</p><p>DEMUTH: There were two students that lost their lives. One that day and one just a short two weeks later.</p><p>RASCOE: Well, Senator Murphy, what do you think the approach should be?</p><p>MURPHY: I'm - my background, I'm a nurse and come to this discussion through a lens of prevention and well-being and health. And with Speaker Demuth and the governor, went to the funeral for Fletcher, one of the children killed in Annunciation. And then went to the funeral for Harper, a little girl who was killed in Annunciation. And feel the presence of their stories and their grief and their loss as I think about the work in front of us. We can't go into a special session and not talk about assault weapons. They are weapons of war, intended to harm, destroy and kill in rapid fire.</p><p>And what we saw happen at Annunciation to those families and to those kids was someone standing outside with a high-powered weapon, shoot and harm so many people in a short amount of time. And those children will tell you the story of what they knew. They knew because they'd been through drills that they needed to lay on top of the youngest kids to protect them. They knew what to do. And that by itself, to me, says our politics - something I believe so deeply in our ability in a self-governing America to solve our hard problems. Our politics are failing right now on this issue.</p><p>RASCOE: I do feel like what we're seeing in the conversation we're having right now is what happens, seems to happen over and over again after shootings. Republicans saying, harden the schools, focus on mental health. And then you have Democrats saying, focus on the type of weaponry. Like, how does anything get done?</p><p>MURPHY: We don't agree necessarily on this issue, but I do believe that it is possible for us to find a path forward. As we negotiated probably one of the hardest budgets that I ever have back in June, that was a hard-fought compromise, and we all gave things up. But we got our job done because we all agreed that we shouldn't fail Minnesota.</p><p>DEMUTH: In the House, right now, we are tied 67-67. And what that has done this year is it has required that we work together in a bipartisan fashion. And what that meant is we have co-chairs in every single one of our committees. So Democrats and Republicans have already proven this year that through deliberative legislative action, we can get things done. They're not fast conversations. They're not do this and hope it works but really, really deliberative.</p><p>RASCOE: I want to talk about the heated and divisive political climate we're in right now. I mean, each side is calling the other side evil. We have to be honest about that.</p><p>MURPHY: What I feel alarmed about, Ayesha, is the thing that I watched happen on the day that Melissa and Mark were assassinated and John was wounded. And again, on the day of the school shooting, and again, on the day that Charlie Kirk was killed. There were efforts in social media to drive a narrative and ascribe blame for what happened from a partisan perspective. And it feels like the extremism that is experienced around the world, it's finding its way into the day-to-day work of legislating.</p><p>A number of my colleagues, but one in particular, has experienced over the course of this last weekend a number of death threats coming not just from Minnesota but from other parts of the country, and they are crude and violent in writing threats. That doesn't serve Democratic governing at all. We can't lead in America if we are operating under that kind of fear. Yes, we disagree, and we should be able to say that. Yes, we have free speech rights, and we should speak what we believe. But we shouldn't turn it into such a personal attack that it becomes weaponized.</p><p>RASCOE: Speaker Demuth, do you feel that partisanship has blinded people to others' humanity?</p><p>DEMUTH: In Minnesota, with the hard things that have happened, one of the things that we have talked about with some of my colleagues is people express their grief differently, and we need to give grace in grief. As far as the partisanship of politics, we have to work together and get things done for the greater good. And it takes each one of us individually to try to tone down the way we speak or speak more with kindness, even while there's a strength in getting things done.</p><p>MURPHY: I think Americans need to start looking up and seeing each other again because the path forward for our country, every time we've been in a bad corner like this, is with each other. And I have faith that when we see each other for who we are as people, we will find our way forward.</p><p>RASCOE: That's state Senator Erin Murphy. Also, we heard from Lisa Demuth, speaker of the Minnesota House. Thanks to you both.</p><p>MURPHY: Thank you.</p><p>DEMUTH: Thank you.</p>

   <p>Early Sunday, people started lining up outside the State Farm Stadium in Glendale, Ariz., for the <a href="https://www.npr.org/2025/09/21/nx-s1-5545613/charlie-kirk-funeral" target="_blank">memorial for right-wing activist Charlie Kirk</a>. People wore "I am Charlie Kirk" hats and T-shirts, "Make America Great Again" baseball caps and carried American flags. The line extended for over a mile outside the stadium, according to Glendale Police. </p>   <p>The memorial service features <a href="https://www.npr.org/2025/09/19/nx-s1-5546856/erika-kirk-ceo-turning-point-usa-charlie-kirk-death" target="_blank">Kirk's widow, Erika Kirk</a>, who on Thursday was named the new CEO of Turning Point USA. Kirk founded the nonprofit in 2012 as a space for young conservatives. President Trump and Vice President Vance traveled for the service along with many other GOP leaders, who have praised Kirk for boosting support for Trump among young voters.</p>   <div>

   <p>President Trump said Charlie Kirk is "a martyr now for American freedom" in front of tens of thousands of his supporters at a memorial service for the conservative activist, less than two weeks after he was killed.</p>   <p>"Our greatest evangelist for American liberty became immortal, Trump said. "He's a martyr now for American freedom."</p>   <p>The 31-year-old co-founder of Turning Point USA was a close ally of Trump and seen as one of the most prominent young leaders within the MAGA movement. His death has reverberated across the Republican Party — from the grassroots through the upper echelons of the White House.</p>   
   <p>"While Charlie has been reunited with his creator in heaven, his voice on earth will let go through the generations, and his name will live forever in the eternal chronicle of America's greatest patriots," Trump said. "He will live forever."</p>   <p>Trump spoke after Kirk's widow, Erika Kirk, who said she forgave her husband's alleged killer.  </p>   <p>"I forgive him because it was what Christ did and is what Charlie would do," she said. "The answer to hate is not hate. The answer we know from the gospel is love and always love. Love for our enemies and love for those who persecute us."</p>   <p>Trump and Ms. Kirk spoke after a long list of friends, spiritual and political mentors in a service marked by its focus on Kirk's faith, feeling much more like a worship service than a funeral. </p>   <div>

   <p>Kirk's pastor Rob McCoy spoke first and highlighted Kirk's faith above politics. McCoy's son and Kirk's former Chief of Staff Mike McCoy then said Kirk was a martyr. </p>   <p>"Charlie's assassin thought that he could steal and silence his voice by putting a bullet in his neck," McCoy said before quoting a Christian philosopher. "In the words of Soren Kierkegaard, 'The tyrant dies. His rule is over. The martyr dies. His rule has just begun.'" </p>   
   <p>After a handful of members of President Trump's administration spoke, Vice President Vance took the podium and said Kirk's death will bring about a Christian revival in the United States. </p>   <p>"The evil murderer who took Charlie from us expected us to have a funeral today," Vance said. "And instead, my friends, we have had a revival in celebration of Charlie Kirk and of his Lord Jesus Christ."</p>   
   <p>The president's son, Donald Trump Jr., also spoke and called Kirk his friend. He said, Kirk embodied the conservative movement in his passion debate and not sinking into violence. </p>   <p>"If we're truly going to honor Charlie properly, his loss cannot be the end of the story," Trump Jr. said. "His legacy must be that when they took his life, a million more Charlies stepped up to fill the void. We are all Charlie."</p>   <div>

   <h3>Starting the remembrance early</h3>   <p>A line of people reached over a mile long outside the stadium early Sunday morning, according to the City of Glendale Police Department. </p>   <p>Walking over Sunday morning, 21-year-old Kaity Jay said she couldn't stop smiling. Knowing the stadium was filling up, she decided to just sit to the side and take in the crowds around her.</p>   <p>"I don't have to go in there," said Jay, who first got involved with Turning Point several years ago when she moved to Arizona. "I'm just glad I got to experience this part of history and see that Charlie Kirk affected more people than ever."</p>   <p>To Jay, Kirk's focus on young conservatives held a lot of weight, and in the wake of his death, she said she plans to be more outspoken about her own beliefs.</p>   <p>"I think he gave us a voice," she said. "Losing that voice has really made a turning point in my life. I've had to stand up for myself and voice my opinion more on my social media, and I lost a couple of friends out of that."</p>   
   <p>Before the event officially started, people were being turned away from State Farm Stadium, which reached capacity. </p>   <p>Alex Bready, 22, is a student at Brigham Young University in Provo, Utah. Sporting an American flag tie, he says that the turnout for Kirk's memorial bodes well for the future of his movement.</p>   <p>"I think of a line from 'Star Wars' actually, 'strike me down and I'll become more powerful than you can ever imagine,'" he remarked. "His voice has been a lot louder in the last week than it has been through, I think, the rest of his career."</p>   <div>

   <h3>A debate on political violence</h3>   <p>The late activist's memorial comes just days after prosecutors <a href="https://www.npr.org/2025/09/16/nx-s1-5542545/utah-files-murder-charges-against-tyler-robinson" target="_blank">charged Tyler Robinson</a>, 22, with murdering Kirk as he was speaking at a Turning Point event at Utah Valley University in Orem, Utah, on September 10. In charging documents, authorities cite a text message sent by Robinson in which he allegedly <a href="https://www.npr.org/2025/09/18/nx-s1-5544446/charlie-kirk-suspect-shooter-motive" target="_blank">explains why he targeted Kirk</a>, writing, "I had enough of his hatred."</p>   <p>Kirk was known as a campus free speech advocate, beloved by his many followers for creating a space for young Republicans to counter what he saw as more liberal-leaning campus climates. In recent years, he had increasingly espoused and amplified many <a href="https://www.npr.org/2024/10/24/nx-s1-5009316/charlie-kirk-turning-point-christian-nationalism-trump" target="_blank">right-wing Christian views</a>. </p>   <p>He also took some stances that his critics derided as offensive. He was a vocal opponent of transgender rights, for example, and believed the 1964 Civil Rights Act was a "mistake," arguing it has caused a <a href="https://www.factcheck.org/2025/09/viral-claims-about-charlie-kirks-words/" target="_blank">"permanent DEI-type bureaucracy."</a></p>   
   <p>His assassination has sparked a broader conversation <a href="https://www.npr.org/2025/09/11/nx-s1-5537908/political-violence-charlie-kirk" target="_blank">around political violence</a> in the country. Several Republican leaders, including Vance, have argued that the "far left" is disproportionately to blame for political violence and that it is not a "both sides problem."</p>   <p>It is an argument that stands in stark contrast to a sobering list of recent documented acts of targeted violence directed at individuals across the political spectrum. Democrats have also fervently denounced those GOP-led claims.</p>   <h3>From student organizer to MAGA leader</h3>   <div>

   <p>Kirk launched Turning Point in 2012 at the age of 18 as a space for young conservatives. Since then, the organization has reported more than 1,800 college and high school chapters around the country. At the time of his death, Kirk had amassed a following of millions online and hosted a popular multi-platform program, <em>The Charlie Kirk Show</em>.</p>   
   <p>Despite initial concerns from <a href="https://www.npr.org/2025/09/11/nx-s1-5537991/for-charlie-kirks-followers-grief-shock-and-questions-about-the-future" target="_blank">some young conservatives</a> about whether Kirk's killing could lessen campus activism, Turning Point has since reported a rise in engagement. As of Thursday, the <a href="https://x.com/TPUSA/status/1968825732974399957" target="_blank">group announced</a> it has received more than 60,000 requests from high school and college students looking to join or start a school chapter.</p>   <h3>Questions about Turning Point's future </h3>   <p>Ahead of the 2024 election, the group's advocacy wing Turning Point Action — which does not have a youth-only focus — assisted the Trump campaign with voter turnout efforts in key swing states like Arizona, Michigan and Wisconsin.</p>   
   <p>Many top Republicans have since credited Kirk with helping <a href="https://www.npr.org/2024/11/07/g-s1-33331/unpacking-the-2024-youth-vote-heres-what-we-know-so-far" target="_blank">boost support for Trump among young people</a>, though his direct impact is hard to quantify.</p>   <p>To his young followers, Kirk's larger impact cannot be overstated. Grieving <a href="https://www.npr.org/2025/09/11/nx-s1-5537991/for-charlie-kirks-followers-grief-shock-and-questions-about-the-future" target="_blank">Gen Z and millennial organizers and content creators</a> have praised the late activist for helping inspire their own political careers. It's something several Republican elected officials have echoed in their own remembrances of Kirk, including Vance, who spoke about how Kirk pushed for him as Trump's running mate.</p>   <p>"If it weren't for Charlie Kirk, I would not be the Vice President of the United States," Vance said while hosting Kirk's show this past week. </p>   
   <p>While <a href="https://www.npr.org/2025/09/19/nx-s1-5546856/erika-kirk-ceo-turning-point-usa-charlie-kirk-death" target="_blank">Erika Kirk</a> has been named CEO, asked to lead the Turning Point organization, maintaining Kirk's larger political movement may take a group effort. It's something Vance alluded to on Monday from the host chair.</p>   <p>"Charlie is irreplaceable, but we can at least have a team of people try to step into the gap," he said. "We're not going to let Charlie's mantle be discarded. We're going to keep on carrying it."</p>

   <p>Early Sunday, people started lining up outside the State Farm Stadium in Glendale, Ariz., for the <a href="https://www.npr.org/2025/09/21/nx-s1-5545613/charlie-kirk-funeral" target="_blank">memorial for right-wing activist Charlie Kirk</a>. People wore "I am Charlie Kirk" hats and T-shirts, "Make America Great Again" baseball caps and carried American flags. The line extended for over a mile outside the stadium, according to Glendale Police. </p>   <p>The memorial service features <a href="https://www.npr.org/2025/09/19/nx-s1-5546856/erika-kirk-ceo-turning-point-usa-charlie-kirk-death" target="_blank">Kirk's widow, Erika Kirk</a>, who on Thursday was named the new CEO of Turning Point USA. Kirk founded the nonprofit in 2012 as a space for young conservatives. President Trump and Vice President Vance traveled for the service along with many other GOP leaders, who have praised Kirk for boosting support for Trump among young voters.</p>   <div>

    <p>AYESHA RASCOE, HOST: </p><p> Students returned to classrooms at Annunciation Catholic School in Minneapolis on Tuesday for the first time since a gunman killed two children and injured 21 other students and parishioners at a mass there. Tuesday was also the day voters filled the seat left vacant by the murder of Minnesota lawmaker Melissa Hortman. Speaker Emerita Hortman was shot in her home earlier this summer, the same night state Senator John Hoffman was also shot and injured in his home. Now Governor Tim Walz says he wants a special session of the legislature to address the state's gun laws. Republican Lisa Demuth is Minnesota's current House speaker, and she joins us now. Welcome.</p><p>LISA DEMUTH: Thank you, Ayesha. Good to talk with you.</p><p>RASCOE: And on the other side of the Capitol and the aisle is state Senator Erin Murphy, a Democrat. Welcome to you, as well.</p><p>ERIN MURPHY: It's good to be with you.</p><p>RASCOE: So for both of you, I mean, so much has happened in your state in the last few months, how are you both doing?</p><p>DEMUTH: In Minnesota, that is such a common question that we get, and I fail to come up with the correct answer. I don't know that there is a right answer, but I think as we continue to heal, we are resilient, but it is a very painful time.</p><p>RASCOE: And Senator Murphy?</p><p>MURPHY: I think the best answer I can give is I'm doing well enough today. And I'd served with Speaker Emerita Hortman for all of my career, and she was well known and deeply loved. The recovery for all of us is going to take some time.</p><p>RASCOE: Speaker Demuth, I know you had a special and a close relationship with Melissa Hortman, as well.</p><p>DEMUTH: I did. When I first came into the legislature in 2019, Speaker Emerita Hortman was the speaker then. She is the only one that I served under until we came back this year in the tie, and I became speaker of the House. But our working relationship really developed in 2023, when my party was in the minority. Speaker Hortman, at the time, they were in the full majority in the state. And yet as a new minority leader, she reached out to me and said, I want to meet weekly with you.</p><p>And she didn't need my votes, but it was important to her that we would develop a working relationship. Even though we didn't agree politically, we found common ground what could we get done or kind of where we were both at on issues, but also things outside of that. Her love for gardening. Her love for dogs. Common things - talking about just being parents. And so that relationship and the way she led as a leader has really formed the way I do my work as speaker of the House now.</p><p>RASCOE: Talking about working across the aisles, like, if Governor Walz does call a special session on gun violence, what realistically could be accomplished?</p><p>DEMUTH: The way that we are looking at it in the House, specifically House Republicans, is it's broader than that. We have to look at mental health. We also have to look at keeping our schools safe and then punishing criminals. There was a tragedy in my community, in my schools, in 2003, and I had children in the building. And so I don't just say this as an elected official or speaker of the House. It is a much broader issue of mental health and how we treat each other.</p><p>RASCOE: And just to follow up on that. So your own children were affected by a school shooting, and it was in Cold Spring, Minnesota, in 2003?</p><p>DEMUTH: That is correct. I had two high school students in the building at the time, and then I had two elementary students that were just across the parking lot. And so as a family and as a community, we've lived that. So I understand it from a little bit different perspective, and that's what I bring into the work that we do in the legislature also.</p><p>RASCOE: Did someone die in that shooting?</p><p>DEMUTH: There were two students that lost their lives. One that day and one just a short two weeks later.</p><p>RASCOE: Well, Senator Murphy, what do you think the approach should be?</p><p>MURPHY: I'm - my background, I'm a nurse and come to this discussion through a lens of prevention and well-being and health. And with Speaker Demuth and the governor, went to the funeral for Fletcher, one of the children killed in Annunciation. And then went to the funeral for Harper, a little girl who was killed in Annunciation. And feel the presence of their stories and their grief and their loss as I think about the work in front of us. We can't go into a special session and not talk about assault weapons. They are weapons of war, intended to harm, destroy and kill in rapid fire.</p><p>And what we saw happen at Annunciation to those families and to those kids was someone standing outside with a high-powered weapon, shoot and harm so many people in a short amount of time. And those children will tell you the story of what they knew. They knew because they'd been through drills that they needed to lay on top of the youngest kids to protect them. They knew what to do. And that by itself, to me, says our politics - something I believe so deeply in our ability in a self-governing America to solve our hard problems. Our politics are failing right now on this issue.</p><p>RASCOE: I do feel like what we're seeing in the conversation we're having right now is what happens, seems to happen over and over again after shootings. Republicans saying, harden the schools, focus on mental health. And then you have Democrats saying, focus on the type of weaponry. Like, how does anything get done?</p><p>MURPHY: We don't agree necessarily on this issue, but I do believe that it is possible for us to find a path forward. As we negotiated probably one of the hardest budgets that I ever have back in June, that was a hard-fought compromise, and we all gave things up. But we got our job done because we all agreed that we shouldn't fail Minnesota.</p><p>DEMUTH: In the House, right now, we are tied 67-67. And what that has done this year is it has required that we work together in a bipartisan fashion. And what that meant is we have co-chairs in every single one of our committees. So Democrats and Republicans have already proven this year that through deliberative legislative action, we can get things done. They're not fast conversations. They're not do this and hope it works but really, really deliberative.</p><p>RASCOE: I want to talk about the heated and divisive political climate we're in right now. I mean, each side is calling the other side evil. We have to be honest about that.</p><p>MURPHY: What I feel alarmed about, Ayesha, is the thing that I watched happen on the day that Melissa and Mark were assassinated and John was wounded. And again, on the day of the school shooting, and again, on the day that Charlie Kirk was killed. There were efforts in social media to drive a narrative and ascribe blame for what happened from a partisan perspective. And it feels like the extremism that is experienced around the world, it's finding its way into the day-to-day work of legislating.</p><p>A number of my colleagues, but one in particular, has experienced over the course of this last weekend a number of death threats coming not just from Minnesota but from other parts of the country, and they are crude and violent in writing threats. That doesn't serve Democratic governing at all. We can't lead in America if we are operating under that kind of fear. Yes, we disagree, and we should be able to say that. Yes, we have free speech rights, and we should speak what we believe. But we shouldn't turn it into such a personal attack that it becomes weaponized.</p><p>RASCOE: Speaker Demuth, do you feel that partisanship has blinded people to others' humanity?</p><p>DEMUTH: In Minnesota, with the hard things that have happened, one of the things that we have talked about with some of my colleagues is people express their grief differently, and we need to give grace in grief. As far as the partisanship of politics, we have to work together and get things done for the greater good. And it takes each one of us individually to try to tone down the way we speak or speak more with kindness, even while there's a strength in getting things done.</p><p>MURPHY: I think Americans need to start looking up and seeing each other again because the path forward for our country, every time we've been in a bad corner like this, is with each other. And I have faith that when we see each other for who we are as people, we will find our way forward.</p><p>RASCOE: That's state Senator Erin Murphy. Also, we heard from Lisa Demuth, speaker of the Minnesota House. Thanks to you both.</p><p>MURPHY: Thank you.</p><p>DEMUTH: Thank you.</p>

   <p>President Trump said Charlie Kirk is "a martyr now for American freedom" in front of tens of thousands of his supporters at a memorial service for the conservative activist, less than two weeks after he was killed.</p>   <p>"Our greatest evangelist for American liberty became immortal, Trump said. "He's a martyr now for American freedom."</p>   <p>The 31-year-old co-founder of Turning Point USA was a close ally of Trump and seen as one of the most prominent young leaders within the MAGA movement. His death has reverberated across the Republican Party — from the grassroots through the upper echelons of the White House.</p>   
   <p>"While Charlie has been reunited with his creator in heaven, his voice on earth will let go through the generations, and his name will live forever in the eternal chronicle of America's greatest patriots," Trump said. "He will live forever."</p>   <p>Trump spoke after Kirk's widow, Erika Kirk, who said she forgave her husband's alleged killer.  </p>   <p>"I forgive him because it was what Christ did and is what Charlie would do," she said. "The answer to hate is not hate. The answer we know from the gospel is love and always love. Love for our enemies and love for those who persecute us."</p>   <p>Trump and Ms. Kirk spoke after a long list of friends, spiritual and political mentors in a service marked by its focus on Kirk's faith, feeling much more like a worship service than a funeral. </p>   <div>

   <p>Kirk's pastor Rob McCoy spoke first and highlighted Kirk's faith above politics. McCoy's son and Kirk's former Chief of Staff Mike McCoy then said Kirk was a martyr. </p>   <p>"Charlie's assassin thought that he could steal and silence his voice by putting a bullet in his neck," McCoy said before quoting a Christian philosopher. "In the words of Soren Kierkegaard, 'The tyrant dies. His rule is over. The martyr dies. His rule has just begun.'" </p>   
   <p>After a handful of members of President Trump's administration spoke, Vice President Vance took the podium and said Kirk's death will bring about a Christian revival in the United States. </p>   <p>"The evil murderer who took Charlie from us expected us to have a funeral today," Vance said. "And instead, my friends, we have had a revival in celebration of Charlie Kirk and of his Lord Jesus Christ."</p>   
   <p>The president's son, Donald Trump Jr., also spoke and called Kirk his friend. He said, Kirk embodied the conservative movement in his passion debate and not sinking into violence. </p>   <p>"If we're truly going to honor Charlie properly, his loss cannot be the end of the story," Trump Jr. said. "His legacy must be that when they took his life, a million more Charlies stepped up to fill the void. We are all Charlie."</p>   <div>

   <h3>Starting the remembrance early</h3>   <p>A line of people reached over a mile long outside the stadium early Sunday morning, according to the City of Glendale Police Department. </p>   <p>Walking over Sunday morning, 21-year-old Kaity Jay said she couldn't stop smiling. Knowing the stadium was filling up, she decided to just sit to the side and take in the crowds around her.</p>   <p>"I don't have to go in there," said Jay, who first got involved with Turning Point several years ago when she moved to Arizona. "I'm just glad I got to experience this part of history and see that Charlie Kirk affected more people than ever."</p>   <p>To Jay, Kirk's focus on young conservatives held a lot of weight, and in the wake of his death, she said she plans to be more outspoken about her own beliefs.</p>   <p>"I think he gave us a voice," she said. "Losing that voice has really made a turning point in my life. I've had to stand up for myself and voice my opinion more on my social media, and I lost a couple of friends out of that."</p>   
   <p>Before the event officially started, people were being turned away from State Farm Stadium, which reached capacity. </p>   <p>Alex Bready, 22, is a student at Brigham Young University in Provo, Utah. Sporting an American flag tie, he says that the turnout for Kirk's memorial bodes well for the future of his movement.</p>   <p>"I think of a line from 'Star Wars' actually, 'strike me down and I'll become more powerful than you can ever imagine,'" he remarked. "His voice has been a lot louder in the last week than it has been through, I think, the rest of his career."</p>   <div>

   <h3>A debate on political violence</h3>   <p>The late activist's memorial comes just days after prosecutors <a href="https://www.npr.org/2025/09/16/nx-s1-5542545/utah-files-murder-charges-against-tyler-robinson" target="_blank">charged Tyler Robinson</a>, 22, with murdering Kirk as he was speaking at a Turning Point event at Utah Valley University in Orem, Utah, on September 10. In charging documents, authorities cite a text message sent by Robinson in which he allegedly <a href="https://www.npr.org/2025/09/18/nx-s1-5544446/charlie-kirk-suspect-shooter-motive" target="_blank">explains why he targeted Kirk</a>, writing, "I had enough of his hatred."</p>   <p>Kirk was known as a campus free speech advocate, beloved by his many followers for creating a space for young Republicans to counter what he saw as more liberal-leaning campus climates. In recent years, he had increasingly espoused and amplified many <a href="https://www.npr.org/2024/10/24/nx-s1-5009316/charlie-kirk-turning-point-christian-nationalism-trump" target="_blank">right-wing Christian views</a>. </p>   <p>He also took some stances that his critics derided as offensive. He was a vocal opponent of transgender rights, for example, and believed the 1964 Civil Rights Act was a "mistake," arguing it has caused a <a href="https://www.factcheck.org/2025/09/viral-claims-about-charlie-kirks-words/" target="_blank">"permanent DEI-type bureaucracy."</a></p>   
   <p>His assassination has sparked a broader conversation <a href="https://www.npr.org/2025/09/11/nx-s1-5537908/political-violence-charlie-kirk" target="_blank">around political violence</a> in the country. Several Republican leaders, including Vance, have argued that the "far left" is disproportionately to blame for political violence and that it is not a "both sides problem."</p>   <p>It is an argument that stands in stark contrast to a sobering list of recent documented acts of targeted violence directed at individuals across the political spectrum. Democrats have also fervently denounced those GOP-led claims.</p>   <h3>From student organizer to MAGA leader</h3>   <div>

   <p>Kirk launched Turning Point in 2012 at the age of 18 as a space for young conservatives. Since then, the organization has reported more than 1,800 college and high school chapters around the country. At the time of his death, Kirk had amassed a following of millions online and hosted a popular multi-platform program, <em>The Charlie Kirk Show</em>.</p>   
   <p>Despite initial concerns from <a href="https://www.npr.org/2025/09/11/nx-s1-5537991/for-charlie-kirks-followers-grief-shock-and-questions-about-the-future" target="_blank">some young conservatives</a> about whether Kirk's killing could lessen campus activism, Turning Point has since reported a rise in engagement. As of Thursday, the <a href="https://x.com/TPUSA/status/1968825732974399957" target="_blank">group announced</a> it has received more than 60,000 requests from high school and college students looking to join or start a school chapter.</p>   <h3>Questions about Turning Point's future </h3>   <p>Ahead of the 2024 election, the group's advocacy wing Turning Point Action — which does not have a youth-only focus — assisted the Trump campaign with voter turnout efforts in key swing states like Arizona, Michigan and Wisconsin.</p>   
   <p>Many top Republicans have since credited Kirk with helping <a href="https://www.npr.org/2024/11/07/g-s1-33331/unpacking-the-2024-youth-vote-heres-what-we-know-so-far" target="_blank">boost support for Trump among young people</a>, though his direct impact is hard to quantify.</p>   <p>To his young followers, Kirk's larger impact cannot be overstated. Grieving <a href="https://www.npr.org/2025/09/11/nx-s1-5537991/for-charlie-kirks-followers-grief-shock-and-questions-about-the-future" target="_blank">Gen Z and millennial organizers and content creators</a> have praised the late activist for helping inspire their own political careers. It's something several Republican elected officials have echoed in their own remembrances of Kirk, including Vance, who spoke about how Kirk pushed for him as Trump's running mate.</p>   <p>"If it weren't for Charlie Kirk, I would not be the Vice President of the United States," Vance said while hosting Kirk's show this past week. </p>   
   <p>While <a href="https://www.npr.org/2025/09/19/nx-s1-5546856/erika-kirk-ceo-turning-point-usa-charlie-kirk-death" target="_blank">Erika Kirk</a> has been named CEO, asked to lead the Turning Point organization, maintaining Kirk's larger political movement may take a group effort. It's something Vance alluded to on Monday from the host chair.</p>   <p>"Charlie is irreplaceable, but we can at least have a team of people try to step into the gap," he said. "We're not going to let Charlie's mantle be discarded. We're going to keep on carrying it."</p>

      <p>Many protestors responding to "Operation Midway Blitz," the stepped-up immigration enforcement in Chicago, are politically active for the first time in their lives.</p>   
</div><div>
    <p>AYESHA RASCOE, HOST: </p><p> Chicago has a long, proud history of activism and is considered by many the birthplace of community organizing. So it's no surprise that there's fierce opposition in the city to increased immigration enforcement. On Friday, Immigration and Customs Enforcement - or ICE - said it made 400 arrests since it launched Operation Midway Blitz two weeks ago. Resistance in the city is attracting many who are becoming politically active for the first time, as Jessica Pupovac reports.</p><p>(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED PROTESTER: (Chanting) No more suspicion (ph)...</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED PROTESTERS: (Chanting) No more suspicion (ph)...</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED PROTESTER: ...(Chanting) From fascist politicians.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED PROTESTERS: ...(Chanting) From fascist politicians.</p><p>JESSICA PUPOVAC: Outside an ICE processing facility in the Chicago suburb of Broadview, armed federal agents in tactical gear and gas masks recently stared down about 50 demonstrators. Jose Richter (ph) stood toward the front, wearing a pro-Second Amendment hat. He was in his work clothes, a black security guard uniform with an American flag on the sleeve.</p><p>JOSE RICHTER: I do security at Navy Pier.</p><p>PUPOVAC: Have you been to many protests?</p><p>RICHTER: No. This is my first one.</p><p>PUPOVAC: Richter is a U.S. Army veteran, born in Mexico and adopted by a U.S. family as a child. He has legal status but said he's standing up for those who don't.</p><p>RICHTER: I never seen this, how they discriminate if you're Latino and looking at you like a criminal. That's not right. My old friends, they got deported already. They went to court. Not even 10 minutes, they were out of the courthouse, sent back to Mexico. And it shouldn't be like that. We're not in Russia. They need to stop it.</p><p>PUPOVAC: The Trump administration's crackdown on illegal immigration has sparked a wave of new organizing here and inspired many first-time activists like Richter and Kevin Naglich. Naglich used to work in cybersecurity. Now he's devoting most of his time to resisting Trump's second-term agenda, including his call for mass deportations.</p><p>KEVIN NAGLICH: Right out of the gate, this time was, you know, attacking all these pillars of democracy. I was just like, OK, well, I can either sit around, feel bad and do nothing or try to make a difference, and I chose the latter.</p><p>PUPOVAC: So he got to work. In February, Naglich started a northwest Chicago chapter of the progressive pro-Democracy group Indivisible. He says it's already attracted more than 3,000 members, most of them brand new to activism. And he's not alone. Other groups are forming networks to support their immigrant neighbors, canvassing door to door, helping them get their IDs and guardianship paperwork in order and walking children of immigrant parents to school if they're afraid to leave their homes. Others are protesting almost daily - outside a suburban hotel where ICE agents are believed to be staying, at the naval base north of Chicago where they train and at this ICE processing facility just west of the city.</p><p>(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)</p><p>RACHEL COHEN: And I am so proud to be a Chicagoan. I am so proud...</p><p>PUPOVAC: Attorney Rachel Cohen is another new activist.</p><p>COHEN: And I am so proud to be in a community that shows up and says absolutely not.</p><p>PUPOVAC: Earlier this year, Cohen was a corporate finance attorney at one of the country's largest firms. But then her former firm pledged $100 million in pro bono legal services to causes backed by Trump after the White House threatened sanctions. She said that capitulation kept her up at night, and eventually it changed her life. She publicly quit her job in March and has since devoted herself to resisting the president's agenda, plugging into local efforts and sharing what she learns with her growing TikTok following.</p><p>COHEN: When you get off your couch and you stop scrolling and you plug into the community, you realize that things are very bad. But there are so many people who also see that for what it is, and you're motivated to keep going and keep showing up.</p><p>PUPOVAC: ICE agents have continued making arrests in Chicago and the suburbs this week, though it is unclear exactly how many. A DHS spokesperson told NPR the number is in the hundreds across Illinois. DHS Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin this week blasted what she called the demonization of ICE agents by the media and, quote, "leftist groups and sanctuary politicians." She says it puts ICE agents at risk and undermines public safety and national security. But Cohen and other activists here say they have no intention of stopping.</p><p>For NPR News, I'm Jessica Pupovac in Chicago.</p><p>(SOUNDBITE OF SHOOK'S "WIND ON THE WATER")</p>
