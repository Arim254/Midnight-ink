      <p>The Pentagon says journalists must sign a pledge not to gather any information, including unclassified reports, that hasn't been authorized for release.</p>   
</div><div>
    <p>SCOTT DETROW, HOST: </p><p> The Pentagon has told the press corps that covers it, there are some new rules to follow - that is, if they want to keep their official credentials that allow them to report from inside the building. It is worth noting, the move came at the end of a week where the Trump administration took aim at First Amendment rights on several fronts.</p><p>President Trump tried to sue The New York Times. ABC took late-night host Jimmy Kimmel off the airwaves after the chairman of the FCC threatened the network's stations unless they acted against the longtime Trump critic. Trump also warned that broadcasters who air the voices of critics like Kimmel should lose their licenses.</p><p>Joining us to explain what this latest move at the Pentagon means for reporters and for the rest of us is NPR media correspondent David Folkenflik. Hi, David.</p><p>DAVID FOLKENFLIK, BYLINE: Hey, Scott.</p><p>DETROW: Tell us what exactly the new rule is.</p><p>FOLKENFLIK: Well, you know, Pete Hegseth came in as the Pentagon chief. He's a former "Fox &amp; Friends Weekend" host, and he promised that it would be the most transparent Pentagon in history. Instead, they've had very few press briefings, and now - and they threw out, by the way, a number of media organizations from their slots at the Pentagon, including NPR and the Washington Post, The New York Times. And now they're saying that reporters who want to report from inside the building have to pledge never to divulge or even gather any information that the Pentagon hasn't authorized for release, and that's including unclassified information.</p><p>DETROW: I mean, that just doesn't sound like reporting.</p><p>FOLKENFLIK: It doesn't sound like reporting. It doesn't sound like the kind of reporters you and I know. I mean, these are people who often have done this for many years. Many of them have, you know, covered military conflict and wars in faraway zones and have gotten to know military personnel from the grunts to the multistar generals and commanders and, you know, have gone through corridors and hallways, knocked on doors not only to get scoops, but just to get expertise and understanding of the kinds of stories they're trying to bring to the American public and to the military personnel themselves.</p><p>DETROW: How are the news organizations that cover the Pentagon responding to this?</p><p>FOLKENFLIK: You know, Scott, I think it's very striking that none of the TV networks that I've reached to - out to, including Fox News itself, CBS, NBC, CNN, have said anything publicly, issued any public statements. Meanwhile, our new editor in chief, Tommy Evans, as well as Matt Murray, the executive editor of the Washington Post, and The New York Times corporately have released strong statements saying that this goes against First Amendment principles.</p><p>There's something called prior restraint, that is that the government preventing the press or broadcasters from reporting the news before it's actually reported. That was taken more than 50 years ago to the Supreme Court, which upheld the idea that the government cannot do that in the Pentagon papers case involving the Nixon administration.</p><p>DETROW: I mean, this makes it harder for us, the reporters who cover Washington, to do our jobs. David, why do you think people who read the news, who listen to the news, who watch the news or just see it scroll by in their social media feet should care about this development?</p><p>FOLKENFLIK: Well, reporters are trying to give the American people an accurate understanding of what our military is doing, what is - you know, how our military are treated and what's being done with their taxpayer dollars.</p><p>Take the attacks by the, you know, Trump administration and Defense Department against what they've characterized as Venezuelan drug boats. There's been some question about that, and there have been some lawmakers on Capitol Hill, both parties, who've raised questions about the legality of that. You know, clearly, Hegseth would like to control what kind of information gets out about that now-contentious thing.</p><p>The idea of the strikes on nuclear sites in Iran - you know, the military told us they were incredibly successful. In subsequent days and weeks, we heard, maybe not so much.</p><p>DETROW: Right.</p><p>FOLKENFLIK: Again, the question is, what kind of information is the American people getting? I don't think the Pentagon gets to decide what we learn about the Pentagon.</p><p>DETROW: That is NPR media correspondent David Folkenflik. Thanks so much.</p><p>FOLKENFLIK: You bet.</p>

</div><div>
    <p>AYESHA RASCOE, HOST: </p><p> With a looming government shutdown, top congressional Democrats have requested a meeting with President Trump because they say Republican leaders are refusing to engage in bipartisan negotiations. We're joined now by NPR senior national political correspondent Mara Liasson. Good morning, Mara.</p><p>MARA LIASSON, BYLINE: Good morning.</p><p>RASCOE: So it looks like Senate Democrats and Republicans can't even agree on a short-term spending bill. So where does that leave us?</p><p>LIASSON: It leaves us looking at a looming - at a possible government shutdown because it doesn't look like the Senate has come to any agreement. They can't pass a spending bill without Democratic votes, and Democrats say they won't agree to a bill that doesn't include an extension of Obamacare subsidies and a rollback of some of those Medicaid cuts that were in the One Big Beautiful Bill. The president has said he - originally that he didn't want to negotiate with Democrats, but now he says he'd love to meet with them, but he doesn't think it will come to much.</p><p>RASCOE: Well, on Friday, U.S. Attorney Erik Siebert of the Eastern District of Virginia resigned. He didn't say why he stepped down, but President Trump wanted him out, right?</p><p>LIASSON: That's right. President Trump wanted him out because he had asked - wanted Siebert to go after New York Attorney General Letitia James for mortgage fraud. Letitia James successfully prosecuted Trump in New York. But Siebert's office, after months of investigation, didn't find enough evidence to file charges. So he was pressured to resign. Trump actually said, he didn't resign. I fired him.</p><p>But now, in an extraordinary post on Truth Social, Donald Trump has ordered Pam Bondi, his attorney general, to prosecute his political opponents, including James, but also former FBI Director James Comey and California Democratic Senator Adam Schiff. Trump claims they are all, quote, "guilty as hell."</p><p>And this is an escalation of Trump's decision to use the Department of Justice as the instrument about - of his campaign of revenge and retaliation. He promised he'd do this. He campaigned on this. And he has overturned a long-standing norm that presidents shouldn't interfere in law enforcement investigations. His critics say this is an attack on the rule of law.</p><p>RASCOE: That is extraordinary. We have to say that. FBI Director Kash Patel faced questions from the House Judiciary Committee on things like the firing of dozens of FBI agents and the release of the Jeffrey Epstein files. Specifically, Democratic lawmakers kept reminding Patel of all the times he said the FBI should release all of the files. But now that he's FBI director, he's not doing that, right?</p><p>LIASSON: No, he's not doing that, and there have been a lot of top officials like Kash Patel or Tulsi Gabbard or Robert F. Kennedy Jr., who have been called on the carpet to various degrees by Congress in hearings like this. But I don't think it matters much as long as Trump has their back.</p><p>And the big question for me that came out of the Kash Patel hearings is - beyond Kash Patel's future, is the future of the Epstein story and how much staying power it has, and whether now with everything else that's going on, it will be pushed out of people's attention span.</p><p>RASCOE: Well, I mean, it has some staying power in the U.K. That - activists were projecting images and news clips linking Trump to Epstein onto Windsor Castle during Trump's visit there last week. But while the president can't control criticism of him overseas, he is trying to do that here in the U.S., isn't he?</p><p>LIASSON: He certainly is. He's using every power at his disposal and some powers that experts say the Constitution does not put at his disposal to dominate or destroy institutions he feels are his opponents, whether they're law firms or universities. This week, it was the media. On Air Force One, he told reporters that the television networks, quote, "only give me bad publicity. I think maybe their licenses should be taken away." We saw Jimmy Kimmel's late-night comedy show get pulled hours after FCC chair Brendan Carr suggested that if ABC's affiliates didn't drop the show, they might lose their licenses.</p><p>We also see the Pentagon 2now prohibiting reporters from obtaining any information, including unclassified information, without prior Pentagon approval, or they'll lose their press credentials. So this kind of crackdown is getting criticism from Trump's own supporters like Tucker Carlson and Ted Cruz, who say it's an attack on the First Amendment that could backfire on Trump.</p><p>RASCOE: That's NPR's Mara Liasson. Thank you so much, Mara.</p><p>LIASSON: You're welcome.</p>

   <p>Erika Kirk, widow of conservative activist Charlie Kirk, said she forgives her husband's alleged killer.</p>   <p>"That man, that young man … I forgive him," Kirk said, wiping away tears as the audience <a href="https://www.npr.org/2025/09/21/nx-s1-5545613/charlie-kirk-funeral" target="_blank">at Kirk's memorial</a> at State Farm Stadium in Glendale, Ariz., erupted in applause on Sunday.</p>   <p>"I forgive him because it was what Christ did and is what Charlie would do," she said. "The answer to hate is not hate. The answer we know from the gospel is love and always love. Love for our enemies and love for those who persecute us."</p>   <p>Last week prosecutors <a href="https://www.npr.org/2025/09/16/nx-s1-5542545/utah-files-murder-charges-against-tyler-robinson" target="_blank">filed murder charges</a> against <a href="https://www.npr.org/2025/09/18/nx-s1-5544446/charlie-kirk-suspect-shooter-motive" target="_blank">22-year-old Tyler Robinson</a>. Officials said Robinson had admitted to shooting Kirk to his roommate, saying in a text message, "I had enough of his hatred."</p>   
   <p>Erika Kirk, who is 36 and the mother of two young children, tearfully described the moment she saw her husband's body at the hospital in Utah, hours after he was shot in the neck while debating college students at Utah Valley University.</p>   <p>"I saw the wound that ended his life … I felt shock, I felt horror and a level of heartache that I didn't even know existed," Kirk said. "But even in death, I could see the man that I loved. I saw the single gray hair on the side of his head, which I never told him about. I also saw in his lips the faintest smile. It revealed to me a great mercy from God in this tragedy. When I saw that, it told me Charlie didn't suffer."</p>   <p>Speaking to tens of thousands of people at the stadium, Kirk said she had found comfort in prayer and also in the way people had responded to her husband's death.</p>   <p>"We didn't see violence, we didn't see riots. We didn't see revolution. Instead we saw what my husband always prayed he would see in this country: We saw revival. We saw people open a Bible for the first time in a decade," she said, urging people to continue doing so.</p>   
   <p>"Pray again, read the Bible again, go to church next Sunday, and the Sunday after that and break free from the temptations and shackles of this world," Kirk said.</p>   
   <p>Her remarks came in striking contrast to both <a href="https://www.npr.org/2025/09/21/nx-s1-5545613/charlie-kirk-funeral" target="_blank">the vice president and president</a>, who bookended her speech. Vice President Vance said that "evil still walks among us" and that society "shouldn't ignore it for a fake kumbaya moment." President Trump said: "I hate my opponents and I don't want the best for them."</p>   <h3>Emphasis on the family</h3>   <p>Kirk had another message for the crowd, saying that the "greatest cause in Charlie's life was trying to revive the American family."</p>   <p>"When he spoke to young people, he was always eager to tell them about God's vision for marriage and how if they could just dare to live it out, it would enrich every part of their life in the same way that it enriched ours," she said.</p>   <p>She told the men in the audience to follow her husband's example in a Christian marriage where they are the spiritual heads of the family, who love and lead their wives and protect their children.</p>   <p>"Please be a leader worth following," Kirk said. "Your wife is not your servant. Your wife is not your employee. Your wife is not your slave. She is your helper. You are not rivals. You are one flesh, working together for the glory of God."</p>   <p>Kirk compared her husband to a martyr who died doing the will of God. She said, while her husband had died far too early, "he was ready to die, he left this world without regrets" because he had done "100% of what he wanted to do every day."</p>   <p>"He died with incomplete work but not with unfinished business," Kirk said.</p>   <p>Last week, Kirk was named the new <a href="https://www.npr.org/2025/09/19/nx-s1-5546856/erika-kirk-ceo-turning-point-usa-charlie-kirk-death" target="_blank">CEO of Turning Point USA</a>, the right-wing youth organization that her late husband founded.</p>

   <p>WASHINGTON — President Donald Trump said Saturday that he would be nominating senior White House aide Lindsey Halligan to serve as the top federal prosecutor for the Virginia office that was thrown into turmoil when its U.S. attorney was pushed out Friday.</p>   <p>In a social media post just after he departed the White House for an event at Mount Vernon, Trump wrote he was nominating Halligan as U.S. attorney for the Eastern District of Virginia, writing that she "will be Fair, Smart, and will provide, desperately needed, JUSTICE FOR ALL!"</p>   <p>The announcement came as Trump pressed Attorney General Pam Bondi to move forward with pursuing cases against some of his political opponents, part of a vow for retribution that has been a theme of his return to the White House.</p>   
   <p>The nomination would place one of the president's legal defenders in charge of an office in tumult over political pressure by administration officials to criminally charge New York Attorney General Letitia James, a longtime foe of Trump, in a mortgage fraud investigation.</p>   
   <p>Erik Siebert, who had been the office's top prosecutor, resigned amid a push by Trump administration officials to bring charges in the investigation, which stems from allegations of paperwork discrepancies on James' Brooklyn townhouse and a Virginia home.</p>   <p>The Justice Department has spent months investigating, and there's been no indication that prosecutors have managed to uncover any degree of incriminating evidence necessary to secure an indictment. James' lawyers have vigorously denied any allegations and characterized the investigation as an act of political revenge.</p>   <p>Halligan has been part of Trump's legal orbit for the last several years, including serving as one of his attorneys in the early days of the FBI's investigation into Trump's retention of classified documents at his Mar-a-Lago estate in Florida. She has more recently been enlisted in a White House effort to remove what the administration contends is "improper ideology" from Smithsonian properties.</p>   
   <p>Earlier Saturday, Trump posted to social media what appeared to be somewhat of an open letter to Bondi, saying he had "reviewed over 30 statements and posts" that he characterized as criticizing his administration for a lack of action on investigations, including the one into James' dealings. Trump's message mentioned former FBI Director James Comey, Trump's longtime foil whom he fired during his first term amid the Russia election interference investigation.</p>   <p>The FBI acknowledged this summer that it was investigating Comey, who was interviewed by the Secret Service after an Instagram post that Republicans insisted was a call for violence against Trump. Comey has said he did not mean the post as a threat and removed it once he realized how it was being interpreted.</p>   
   <p>Asked as he departed the White House if he was criticizing Bondi, Trump said he just wanted action.</p>   <div>

   <p>"We have to act fast — one way or the other," Trump said. "They're guilty, they're not guilty — we have to act fast. If they're not guilty, that's fine. If they are guilty or if they should be charged, they should be charged. And we have to do it now."</p>   <p>In announcing Halligan's nomination soon after on social media, Trump said that Bondi was "doing a GREAT job."</p>   <p>The selection of Halligan came just hours after another conservative lawyer, Mary "Maggie" Cleary, said in an email to staff that she had been named acting U.S. attorney for the Eastern District of Virginia, according to a copy viewed by The Associated Press.</p>   <p>"While this appointment was unexpected, I am humbled to be joining your ranks," Cleary, a conservative lawyer who has said she was falsely accused of being at the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021, told employees in the email.</p>   <p>While Siebert said in an email to colleagues Friday evening that he had submitted his resignation, Trump said in a social media post: "He didn't quit, I fired him!" Trump noted he was backed by the state's two Democratic senators, Mark Warner and Tim Kaine, adding: "Next time let him go in as a Democrat, not a Republican."<br /></p>

      <p>We look at conservative activist Charlie Kirk's faith, and how it helped form him political beliefs.</p>   
</div><div>
    <p>AYESHA RASCOE, HOST: </p><p> Charlie Kirk's Christian faith was central to his life and his political views. NPR political correspondent Sarah McCammon has been listening to some of Kirk's own words about his views on religion and politics, and she joins me now. Good morning.</p><p>SARAH MCCAMMON, BYLINE: Good morning, Ayesha.</p><p>RASCOE: So what do we know about Charlie Kirk's religious beliefs?</p><p>MCCAMMON: Well, Charlie Kirk often talked about his Christian faith. He spoke publicly about growing up attending Christian school and, like many evangelicals, said he made a decision at a young age to give his life to Jesus. In an interview six years ago with David Brody of the Christian Broadcasting Network, Kirk said that his faith had deepened around the time he got out of high school and founded Turning Point USA, his organization for young conservatives.</p><p>(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)</p><p>CHARLIE KIRK: I started to experience real adversity. I started to come in a much closer relationship with Jesus Christ and reading my Bible more and becoming more essentially unapologetic about my Christianity 'cause I was given a choice. I could try to descend more into this kind of secular world or reaffirm my faith. And, you know, that's exactly what I did.</p><p>MCCAMMON: Now, Turning Point USA is a political organization that describes itself as training young people to promote ideas like free markets and limited government. But later, Kirk founded a spin-off group called TPUSA Faith whose mission is to, quote, "eliminate wokeism from the American pulpit." That was more focused on churches. And while Kirk had friendly relationships with like-minded people of other faith traditions - including some politically conservative Jews and Roman Catholics, among others - he was himself a Protestant and specifically an Evangelical.</p><p>RASCOE: And how did his beliefs show up in politics?</p><p>MCCAMMON: Well, Kirk often referenced his Christian faith when he talked about political issues. For example, his belief that when it comes to helping the needy, churches - not the government - should be responsible. He also cited his faith in connection with some of his most controversial ideas. He described DEI - diversity, equity and inclusion - as unbiblical. He argued against abortion by saying that an embryo is, quote, "a baby made in the image of God deserving of protection." And he described being transgender as, quote, "a throbbing middle finger to God."</p><p>RASCOE: Critics have described Charlie Kirk as promoting Christian nationalism, or the belief that the American system of government should be based on Christianity. How did he talk about the connection between religion and politics?</p><p>MCCAMMON: You know, this is interesting, Ayesha. Earlier in his career, he expressed the view that Christian conservatives had, at times, gone too far in trying to impose their religious beliefs on the rest of society through politics. Back in 2018, while talking with the conservative podcaster David Rubin, Kirk said that had been a big mistake.</p><p>(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)</p><p>KIRK: Because it created this kind of counter revolution, which is, I don't want to have to live the way some Christian in Alabama wants me to live. Does that make sense?</p><p>DAVID RUBIN: Yeah, yeah.</p><p>KIRK: So it's the imposition of those values through legislation and government, which is something I don't necessarily support, right?</p><p>RUBIN: Yeah.</p><p>KIRK: So I try to always advocate for every one of my political positions through a secular world view.</p><p>MCCAMMON: And at that point, Kirk said he believed in the separation of church and state, but he later reversed that and described that idea as a fabrication. Here he is last year, arguing that the U.S. was set up by and for not just Christians, but specifically Protestant Christians. And Kirk said he did not think the country could function well any other way.</p><p>(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)</p><p>KIRK: The body politic of America was so Christian and was so Protestant that our form and structure of government was built for the people that believed in Christ, our Lord. One of the reasons we're living through a constitutional crisis is that we no longer have a Christian nation, but we have a Christian form of government, and they're incompatible. So you cannot have liberty if you do not have a Christian population.</p><p>MCCAMMON: So clearly, he went through a shift in his thinking about the proper role of religion in politics.</p><p>RASCOE: How is Kirk's faith shaping the way he's remembered?</p><p>MCCAMMON: Well, he was a polarizing figure in life and in his death. Some of his supporters are describing him as a martyr for the Christian faith. Here's Cissie Graham Lynch - the granddaughter of the late Reverend Billy Graham - comparing Kirk to Stephen, who's recognized as Christianity's first martyr.</p><p>CISSIE GRAHAM LYNCH: Charlie was a modern-day Stephen. His life, and now his death, testify that the gospel is worth everything.</p><p>MCCAMMON: Now, others worry about this framing. I spoke recently with a scholar of Christian nationalism, Matthew Bodie, at the University of North Georgia, who warns that this kind of talk can lead to escalation of both rhetoric and sometimes of violence. And he said that can ultimately be dangerous for everyone.</p><p>RASCOE: That's NPR's Sarah McCammon. Thank you so much.</p><p>MCCAMMON: Thank you.</p>

   <p>WASHINGTON — President Donald Trump said Saturday that he would be nominating senior White House aide Lindsey Halligan to serve as the top federal prosecutor for the Virginia office that was thrown into turmoil when its U.S. attorney was pushed out Friday.</p>   <p>In a social media post just after he departed the White House for an event at Mount Vernon, Trump wrote he was nominating Halligan as U.S. attorney for the Eastern District of Virginia, writing that she "will be Fair, Smart, and will provide, desperately needed, JUSTICE FOR ALL!"</p>   <p>The announcement came as Trump pressed Attorney General Pam Bondi to move forward with pursuing cases against some of his political opponents, part of a vow for retribution that has been a theme of his return to the White House.</p>   
   <p>The nomination would place one of the president's legal defenders in charge of an office in tumult over political pressure by administration officials to criminally charge New York Attorney General Letitia James, a longtime foe of Trump, in a mortgage fraud investigation.</p>   
   <p>Erik Siebert, who had been the office's top prosecutor, resigned amid a push by Trump administration officials to bring charges in the investigation, which stems from allegations of paperwork discrepancies on James' Brooklyn townhouse and a Virginia home.</p>   <p>The Justice Department has spent months investigating, and there's been no indication that prosecutors have managed to uncover any degree of incriminating evidence necessary to secure an indictment. James' lawyers have vigorously denied any allegations and characterized the investigation as an act of political revenge.</p>   <p>Halligan has been part of Trump's legal orbit for the last several years, including serving as one of his attorneys in the early days of the FBI's investigation into Trump's retention of classified documents at his Mar-a-Lago estate in Florida. She has more recently been enlisted in a White House effort to remove what the administration contends is "improper ideology" from Smithsonian properties.</p>   
   <p>Earlier Saturday, Trump posted to social media what appeared to be somewhat of an open letter to Bondi, saying he had "reviewed over 30 statements and posts" that he characterized as criticizing his administration for a lack of action on investigations, including the one into James' dealings. Trump's message mentioned former FBI Director James Comey, Trump's longtime foil whom he fired during his first term amid the Russia election interference investigation.</p>   <p>The FBI acknowledged this summer that it was investigating Comey, who was interviewed by the Secret Service after an Instagram post that Republicans insisted was a call for violence against Trump. Comey has said he did not mean the post as a threat and removed it once he realized how it was being interpreted.</p>   
   <p>Asked as he departed the White House if he was criticizing Bondi, Trump said he just wanted action.</p>   <div>

   <p>"We have to act fast — one way or the other," Trump said. "They're guilty, they're not guilty — we have to act fast. If they're not guilty, that's fine.

      <p>We look at conservative activist Charlie Kirk's faith, and how it helped form him political beliefs.</p>   
</div><div>
    <p>AYESHA RASCOE, HOST: </p><p> Charlie Kirk's Christian faith was central to his life and his political views. NPR political correspondent Sarah McCammon has been listening to some of Kirk's own words about his views on religion and politics, and she joins me now. Good morning.</p><p>SARAH MCCAMMON, BYLINE: Good morning, Ayesha.</p><p>RASCOE: So what do we know about Charlie Kirk's religious beliefs?</p><p>MCCAMMON: Well, Charlie Kirk often talked about his Christian faith. He spoke publicly about growing up attending Christian school and, like many evangelicals, said he made a decision at a young age to give his life to Jesus. In an interview six years ago with David Brody of the Christian Broadcasting Network, Kirk said that his faith had deepened around the time he got out of high school and founded Turning Point USA, his organization for young conservatives.</p><p>(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)</p><p>CHARLIE KIRK: I started to experience real adversity. I started to come in a much closer relationship with Jesus Christ and reading my Bible more and becoming more essentially unapologetic about my Christianity 'cause I was given a choice. I could try to descend more into this kind of secular world or reaffirm my faith. And, you know, that's exactly what I did.</p><p>MCCAMMON: Now, Turning Point USA is a political organization that describes itself as training young people to promote ideas like free markets and limited government. But later, Kirk founded a spin-off group called TPUSA Faith whose mission is to, quote, "eliminate wokeism from the American pulpit." That was more focused on churches. And while Kirk had friendly relationships with like-minded people of other faith traditions - including some politically conservative Jews and Roman Catholics, among others - he was himself a Protestant and specifically an Evangelical.</p><p>RASCOE: And how did his beliefs show up in politics?</p><p>MCCAMMON: Well, Kirk often referenced his Christian faith when he talked about political issues. For example, his belief that when it comes to helping the needy, churches - not the government - should be responsible. He also cited his faith in connection with some of his most controversial ideas. He described DEI - diversity, equity and inclusion - as unbiblical. He argued against abortion by saying that an embryo is, quote, "a baby made in the image of God deserving of protection." And he described being transgender as, quote, "a throbbing middle finger to God."</p><p>RASCOE: Critics have described Charlie Kirk as promoting Christian nationalism, or the belief that the American system of government should be based on Christianity. How did he talk about the connection between religion and politics?</p><p>MCCAMMON: You know, this is interesting, Ayesha. Earlier in his career, he expressed the view that Christian conservatives had, at times, gone too far in trying to impose their religious beliefs on the rest of society through politics. Back in 2018, while talking with the conservative podcaster David Rubin, Kirk said that had been a big mistake.</p><p>(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)</p><p>KIRK: Because it created this kind of counter revolution, which is, I don't want to have to live the way some Christian in Alabama wants me to live. Does that make sense?</p><p>DAVID RUBIN: Yeah, yeah.</p><p>KIRK: So it's the imposition of those values through legislation and government, which is something I don't necessarily support, right?</p><p>RUBIN: Yeah.</p><p>KIRK: So I try to always advocate for every one of my political positions through a secular world view.</p><p>MCCAMMON: And at that point, Kirk said he believed in the separation of church and state, but he later reversed that and described that idea as a fabrication. Here he is last year, arguing that the U.S. was set up by and for not just Christians, but specifically Protestant Christians. And Kirk said he did not think the country could function well any other way.</p><p>(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)</p><p>KIRK: The body politic of America was so Christian and was so Protestant that our form and structure of government was built for the people that believed in Christ, our Lord. One of the reasons we're living through a constitutional crisis is that we no longer have a Christian nation, but we have a Christian form of government, and they're incompatible. So you cannot have liberty if you do not have a Christian population.</p><p>MCCAMMON: So clearly, he went through a shift in his thinking about the proper role of religion in politics.</p><p>RASCOE: How is Kirk's faith shaping the way he's remembered?</p><p>MCCAMMON: Well, he was a polarizing figure in life and in his death. Some of his supporters are describing him as a martyr for the Christian faith. Here's Cissie Graham Lynch - the granddaughter of the late Reverend Billy Graham - comparing Kirk to Stephen, who's recognized as Christianity's first martyr.</p><p>CISSIE GRAHAM LYNCH: Charlie was a modern-day Stephen. His life, and now his death, testify that the gospel is worth everything.</p><p>MCCAMMON: Now, others worry about this framing. I spoke recently with a scholar of Christian nationalism, Matthew Bodie, at the University of North Georgia, who warns that this kind of talk can lead to escalation of both rhetoric and sometimes of violence. And he said that can ultimately be dangerous for everyone.</p><p>RASCOE: That's NPR's Sarah McCammon. Thank you so much.</p><p>MCCAMMON: Thank you.</p>

      <p>We look at the potential of a government shutdown, as well as FBI Director Kash Patel being questioned on the Jeffrey Epstein files he refuses to release, and Trump's attacks on the media.</p>   
</div><div>
    <p>AYESHA RASCOE, HOST: </p><p> With a looming government shutdown, top congressional Democrats have requested a meeting with President Trump because they say Republican leaders are refusing to engage in bipartisan negotiations. We're joined now by NPR senior national political correspondent Mara Liasson. Good morning, Mara.</p><p>MARA LIASSON, BYLINE: Good morning.</p><p>RASCOE: So it looks like Senate Democrats and Republicans can't even agree on a short-term spending bill. So where does that leave us?</p><p>LIASSON: It leaves us looking at a looming - at a possible government shutdown because it doesn't look like the Senate has come to any agreement. They can't pass a spending bill without Democratic votes, and Democrats say they won't agree to a bill that doesn't include an extension of Obamacare subsidies and a rollback of some of those Medicaid cuts that were in the One Big Beautiful Bill. The president has said he - originally that he didn't want to negotiate with Democrats, but now he says he'd love to meet with them, but he doesn't think it will come to much.</p><p>RASCOE: Well, on Friday, U.S. Attorney Erik Siebert of the Eastern District of Virginia resigned. He didn't say why he stepped down, but President Trump wanted him out, right?</p><p>LIASSON: That's right. President Trump wanted him out because he had asked - wanted Siebert to go after New York Attorney General Letitia James for mortgage fraud. Letitia James successfully prosecuted Trump in New York. But Siebert's office, after months of investigation, didn't find enough evidence to file charges. So he was pressured to resign. Trump actually said, he didn't resign. I fired him.</p><p>But now, in an extraordinary post on Truth Social, Donald Trump has ordered Pam Bondi, his attorney general, to prosecute his political opponents, including James, but also former FBI Director James Comey and California Democratic Senator Adam Schiff. Trump claims they are all, quote, "guilty as hell."</p><p>And this is an escalation of Trump's decision to use the Department of Justice as the instrument about - of his campaign of revenge and retaliation. He promised he'd do this. He campaigned on this. And he has overturned a long-standing norm that presidents shouldn't interfere in law enforcement investigations. His critics say this is an attack on the rule of law.</p><p>RASCOE: That is extraordinary. We have to say that. FBI Director Kash Patel faced questions from the House Judiciary Committee on things like the firing of dozens of FBI agents and the release of the Jeffrey Epstein files. Specifically, Democratic lawmakers kept reminding Patel of all the times he said the FBI should release all of the files. But now that he's FBI director, he's not doing that, right?</p><p>LIASSON: No, he's not doing that, and there have been a lot of top officials like Kash Patel or Tulsi Gabbard or Robert F. Kennedy Jr., who have been called on the carpet to various degrees by Congress in hearings like this. But I don't think it matters much as long as Trump has their back.</p><p>And the big question for me that came out of the Kash Patel hearings is - beyond Kash Patel's future, is the future of the Epstein story and how much staying power it has, and whether now with everything else that's going on, it will be pushed out of people's attention span.</p><p>RASCOE: Well, I mean, it has some staying power in the U.K. That - activists were projecting images and news clips linking Trump to Epstein onto Windsor Castle during Trump's visit there last week. But while the president can't control criticism of him overseas, he is trying to do that here in the U.S., isn't he?</p><p>LIASSON: He certainly is. He's using every power at his disposal and some powers that experts say the Constitution does not put at his disposal to dominate or destroy institutions he feels are his opponents, whether they're law firms or universities. This week, it was the media. On Air Force One, he told reporters that the television networks, quote, "only give me bad publicity. I think maybe their licenses should be taken away." We saw Jimmy Kimmel's late-night comedy show get pulled hours after FCC chair Brendan Carr suggested that if ABC's affiliates didn't drop the show, they might lose their licenses.</p><p>We also see the Pentagon 2now prohibiting reporters from obtaining any information, including unclassified information, without prior Pentagon approval, or they'll lose their press credentials. So this kind of crackdown is getting criticism from Trump's own supporters like Tucker Carlson and Ted Cruz, who say it's an attack on the First Amendment that could backfire on Trump.</p><p>RASCOE: That's NPR's Mara Liasson. Thank you so much, Mara.</p><p>LIASSON: You're welcome.</p>

      <p>The Pentagon says journalists must sign a pledge not to gather any information, including unclassified reports, that hasn't been authorized for release.</p>   
</div><div>
    <p>SCOTT DETROW, HOST: </p><p> The Pentagon has told the press corps that covers it, there are some new rules to follow - that is, if they want to keep their official credentials that allow them to report from inside the building. It is worth noting, the move came at the end of a week where the Trump administration took aim at First Amendment rights on several fronts.</p><p>President Trump tried to sue The New York Times. ABC took late-night host Jimmy Kimmel off the airwaves after the chairman of the FCC threatened the network's stations unless they acted against the longtime Trump critic. Trump also warned that broadcasters who air the voices of critics like Kimmel should lose their licenses.</p><p>Joining us to explain what this latest move at the Pentagon means for reporters and for the rest of us is NPR media correspondent David Folkenflik. Hi, David.</p><p>DAVID FOLKENFLIK, BYLINE: Hey, Scott.</p><p>DETROW: Tell us what exactly the new rule is.</p><p>FOLKENFLIK: Well, you know, Pete Hegseth came in as the Pentagon chief. He's a former "Fox &amp; Friends Weekend" host, and he promised that it would be the most transparent Pentagon in history. Instead, they've had very few press briefings, and now - and they threw out, by the way, a number of media organizations from their slots at the Pentagon, including NPR and the Washington Post, The New York Times. And now they're saying that reporters who want to report from inside the building have to pledge never to divulge or even gather any information that the Pentagon hasn't authorized for release, and that's including unclassified information.</p><p>DETROW: I mean, that just doesn't sound like reporting.</p><p>FOLKENFLIK: It doesn't sound like reporting. It doesn't sound like the kind of reporters you and I know. I mean, these are people who often have done this for many years. Many of them have, you know, covered military conflict and wars in faraway zones and have gotten to know military personnel from the grunts to the multistar generals and commanders and, you know, have gone through corridors and hallways, knocked on doors not only to get scoops, but just to get expertise and understanding of the kinds of stories they're trying to bring to the American public and to the military personnel themselves.</p><p>DETROW: How are the news organizations that cover the Pentagon responding to this?</p><p>FOLKENFLIK: You know, Scott, I think it's very striking that none of the TV networks that I've reached to - out to, including Fox News itself, CBS, NBC, CNN, have said anything publicly, issued any public statements. Meanwhile, our new editor in chief, Tommy Evans, as well as Matt Murray, the executive editor of the Washington Post, and The New York Times corporately have released strong statements saying that this goes against First Amendment principles.</p><p>There's something called prior restraint, that is that the government preventing the press or broadcasters from reporting the news before it's actually reported. That was taken more than 50 years ago to the Supreme Court, which upheld the idea that the government cannot do that in the Pentagon papers case involving the Nixon administration.</p><p>DETROW: I mean, this makes it harder for us, the reporters who cover Washington, to do our jobs. David, why do you think people who read the news, who listen to the news, who watch the news or just see it scroll by in their social media feet should care about this development?</p><p>FOLKENFLIK: Well, reporters are trying to give the American people an accurate understanding of what our military is doing, what is - you know, how our military are treated and what's being done with their taxpayer dollars.</p><p>Take the attacks by the, you know, Trump administration and Defense Department against what they've characterized as Venezuelan drug boats. There's been some question about that, and there have been some lawmakers on Capitol Hill, both parties, who've raised questions about the legality of that. You know, clearly, Hegseth would like to control what kind of information gets out about that now-contentious thing.</p><p>The idea of the strikes on nuclear sites in Iran - you know, the military told us they were incredibly successful. In subsequent days and weeks, we heard, maybe not so much.</p><p>DETROW: Right.</p><p>FOLKENFLIK: Again, the question is, what kind of information is the American people getting? I don't think the Pentagon gets to decide what we learn about the Pentagon.</p><p>DETROW: That is NPR media correspondent David Folkenflik. Thanks so much.</p><p>FOLKENFLIK: You bet.</p>
