          <p>We know he might be off the air for a little while ... but we still wanna see if you can guess who this late-night TV show host is!</p>
      </section>
    <section>
          <p>We ran into this guy and his wife way back in 2017, when we caught him greeting a couple of fans while leaving a restaurant in L.A., and he was pretty popular -- back then, at least. You may also recognize a prolific celeb picture-collector known on the Hollywood streets ...</p>
      </section>
    <section>
          <p>The thing is, the host in question here got pulled off the air earlier this month after making some comments about the circumstances surrounding a certain right-wing commentator ... so who knows when he's coming back?!</p>

          <p>Fall's just around the corner, folks, and it's finally time to start breaking out the layers ... so we were thinking maybe getting some inspiration from our gallery of beanie-wearing babes would help out a bit!</p>

          <p>Sure, beanies keep your head warm, but they can also be essential parts of an outfit -- <a target="_blank" href="https://www.tmz.com/people/billie-eilish/"><strong>Billie Eilish</strong></a> and <strong>Coi Leray</strong> really used them as fashion statements.</p>
      </section>
    <section>
          <p>Then again, they could also just keep you really comfy ... we're thinking <strong>Corinna Kopf</strong> and <a target="_blank" href="https://www.tmz.com/people/candice-swanepoel/"><strong>Candice Swanepoel</strong></a> got the memo!</p>

          <p>Back in 2013, American actress <strong>Leah Pipes</strong> was in her mid 20s when she first started playing Camille O'Connell -- the former brave psychology student who's highly intelligent -- on the supernatural fantasy-drama spinoff series "The Originals."</p>
      </section>

          <p>Pipes was part of an ensemble cast including <strong>Joseph Morgan </strong>as Niklaus, the OG vampire who's romantically interested in Camile, <strong>Phoebe Tonkin </strong>as Hayley, the protective alpha werewolf who shares a kid with Niklaus, and<strong> Danielle Campbell</strong> as<strong> </strong>Davina, who is extremely powerful and the dependent teen witch ...</p>

          <p>Pipes also starred in the slasher film "Sorority Row" where she played Jessica Pierson.</p>

          <p>We know he might be off the air for a little while ... but we still wanna see if you can guess who this late-night TV show host is!</p>
      </section>
    <section>
          <p>We ran into this guy and his wife way back in 2017, when we caught him greeting a couple of fans while leaving a restaurant in L.A., and he was pretty popular -- back then, at least. You may also recognize a prolific celeb picture-collector known on the Hollywood streets ...</p>
      </section>
    <section>
          <p>The thing is, the host in question here got pulled off the air earlier this month after making some comments about the circumstances surrounding a certain right-wing commentator ... so who knows when he's coming back?!</p>
