	Pickford’s AI series “<a target="_blank" href="https://variety.com/t/whispers/">Whispers</a>” bowed at Busan Asian Contents &amp; Film Market, offering audiences an interactive teaser that showcased the potential of AI-driven storytelling.</p>
<p>
	Emmy-winning producer Bernie Su (“The Lizzie Bennet Diaries”) said his motivation for creating an AI series stemmed from his desire to explore new narrative formats. “The storyteller to me is that what you’re about to see, this experience, is a story experience that cannot be done without AI,” Su explained. ““It’s a new art form that, at its speed and at its fidelity, cannot be done without AI and the technology that Pickford pioneered, and put in this experience.”
	</p>
<p>
	The showcase allowed audiences to participate through a QR code-enabled chat room where they could provide instant feedback. Stephen Piron, co-founder of <a target="_blank" href="https://variety.com/t/pickford-ai/">Pickford AI</a>, described the audience’s phones as “the conductor’s baton, painter’s brush, and storyteller’s voice.”
</p>
<p>
	Though brief, the clip demonstrated how the interactive format functions, particularly through a catchphrase generated in Marcus Kent’s dialogue. The post-screening panel featured voice actors Brandon Soohoo (“Tropic Thunder”) and Heavenly Reyna (“The Bold and the Beautiful”), who discussed their experience working on the project. </p>
<p>
	“I honestly did not recognize myself. It was really interesting. I recognized different things that I have said, but nothing altogether,” Reyna said.</p>
<p>
	Soohoo echoed similar sentiments about the AI voice synthesis results. “I recognize certain things that we were recording, like a portion that we did kind of happier or a little bit more anxious,” he said. “But some of the inflections are for sure familiar, but most of them, I didn’t necessarily say that.”
	</p>
<p>
	Addressing the use of actors’ voices, Su emphasized the importance of consent and transparency, and <a target="_blank" href="https://variety.com/2025/digital/news/sag-framework-pickford-ai-whispers-voice-actor-casting-1236515884/">working within SAG’s framework for AI projects</a>. “We are using a voice with their approval” Su said. “But some actors would pass, not because they were against AI, but they were concerned about the stigma that the audience would have against them.”</p>
<div><p>
	Reyna acknowledged the broader industry concerns while expressing trust in the project. “For me personally, I have a lot of reservations with AI just in the creative industry, but I trust Bernie, and I also trust his visions and his innovation,” she said. “And I thought it was cool.”</p></div>

	Busan’s Asian Contents &amp; Film Market hosted a lively panel on India–Korea collaborations under the banner “India-Korea Synergies: New Horizons in Co-Productions,” bringing together policymakers, producers and media figures to discuss how the two industries can forge deeper ties.</p>
<p>
	The session featured Prithul Kumar, joint secretary (broadcasting) for India’s Ministry of Information and Broadcasting; actor-producer Arfi Lamba; Anthology Studios president Choi Jae-won; LME Studios CEO Heo Youngkook; media personality Abhishek Gupta; and Nishikant Singh, deputy chief of mission at the Embassy of India in Seoul.
	</p>
<p>
	Kumar outlined India’s incentive framework, stressing that international productions – including Korean projects – can access rebates of up to $3.6 million, with approvals granted in as little as 18 days. “Our co-production agreements mean films can qualify as national films in both countries, opening markets and maximizing support,” he noted.
</p>
<p>
	Choi highlighted his company’s <a target="_blank" href="https://variety.com/2025/film/news/drishyam-korean-remake-director-1236525498/">remake of Indian blockbuster “Drishyam”</a> for the Korean market, describing it as “a landmark step in bridging storytelling traditions.” Heo discussed his upcoming 3D animation “Astro Station,” made in collaboration with an Indian partner studio, crediting the project’s visual quality to India’s fast-growing VFX ecosystem.</p>
<p>
	Lamba called Asia’s creative industries “the new superpower,” pointing to India’s experience in backend VFX for Disney, Pixar and Marvel. “This is the time to take the front foot, go global together, and recover faster through shared resources,” he said.
	</p>
<p>
	Gupta, long based in Seoul and nicknamed “the most famous Indian in Korea,” emphasized cultural affinity and the need to break stereotypes about Indian cinema. “Korean audiences still think of Indian films as just song-and-dance epics, but younger viewers are ready for action-driven, layered stories,” he said.</p>
<div><p>
	Singh added that increased festival participation and talent exchanges could “create a real bridge” between the industries, while all panelists agreed on the potential for Indo-Korean stories to resonate across Asia and beyond.</p></div>

	<a target="_blank" href="https://variety.com/t/john-oliver/">John Oliver</a> used most of his “<a target="_blank" href="https://variety.com/t/last-week-tonight/">Last Week Tonight</a>” episode on Sept. 21 breaking down <a target="_blank" href="https://variety.com/t/jimmy-kimmel/">Jimmy Kimmel</a>‘s <a target="_blank" href="https://variety.com/2025/tv/news/nexstar-jimmy-kimmel-abc-charlie-kirk-1236522584/">indefinite suspension</a> at ABC. At the end of his segment analyzing the developments of the last week and corporate players involved, Oliver used the opportunity to speak directly to Disney CEO Bob Iger.</p>
<p>
	“Hi there, Bob. We haven’t met, but you probably know me as America’s third favorite Zazu,” Oliver said, recalling his “Lion King” voice role. “Congratulations on recasting that role, by the way. It was a fun thing to learn about after the fact. Anyway, one day, the history of the time we’re living through is going to be written, and when it is, I’m not sure it’s those in this administration who are even gonna come off the worst. Now don’t get me wrong, they’re going to come off <em>terribly</em>. But history is also going to remember the cowards who definitely knew better but still let things happen, whether it was for money, convenience or just comfort. I know this is something of a tough sell, and it can be a bit of anathema to risk-averse business leaders. 
	</p>
<p>
	“But I will say this,” he continued. “If we’ve learned nothing else from this administration’s second term so far, and I don’t think we have, is that giving the bully your lunch money doesn’t make him go away. It just makes him come back hungrier each time. They are never going to stop. They’ve literally said that openly. After Kimmel’s suspension, Trump posted, ‘That leaves Jimmy and Seth, two total losers on fake news NBC. Their ratings are also horrible. Do it, NBC.’ And [FCC chairman Brendan] Carr hinted that ‘The View’ might be next. The fucking ‘View!’ Look, at some point you’re going to have to draw a line. So I’d argue, why not draw it right here? And when they come to you with stupid ridiculous demands, picking fights that you know you could win in court instead of rolling over, why not stand up and use four key words they don’t tend to teach you in business school. Not ‘OK, you’re the boss.’ Not ‘Whatever you say goes.’ But instead, the only phrase that can genuinely make a weak bully go away. And that is, ‘Fuck you, make me.'”

	Spain’s <a target="_blank" href="https://variety.com/t/film-factory-entertainment/">Film Factory Entertainment</a> has picked up global rights to “<a target="_blank" href="https://variety.com/t/pray-for-us/">Pray for Us</a>,” the latest from Daniel Monzón, produced by <a target="_blank" href="https://variety.com/t/arcadia-motion-pictures/">Arcadia Motion Pictures</a>, the Madrid-based outfit behind Rodrigo Sorogoyen’s “The Beasts” and Pablo Berger’s Oscar-nominated “Robot Dreams.”</p>
<p>
	Headlined by Zoe Bonafonte (“The Goldsmith’s Secret,” “The 47”) and Manuela Calle (“Marbella”), the film also stars Adelfa Calvo (“On the Fringe,” “God’s Crooked Lines”), Malena Gutiérrez (“Bitching and Witching,” “All About My Mother”) and María Cerezuela (“Maixabel”).
	</p>
<p>
	Reuniting Monzón with longtime co-writer Jorge Guerricaechevarría and inspired by real events “Pray for Us” dramatizes one of the most silenced chapters of Franco’s Spain: the Patronato de Protección a la Mujer (Women’s Protection Board). Created in 1941 and active until 1985, the state-backed institution confined thousands of women, many single mothers, in convents and boarding schools under the guise of moral “reform.” Historians estimate some 40,000 women passed through them.
</p>
<p>
	“We’re thrilled to be part of Daniel Monzón’s upcoming film. We believe ‘Pray for Us’ has strong international potential and will leave a lasting impression on audiences worldwide.” said Film Factory Director Vicente Canales. </p>
<p>
	Set between 1974 and 1979, the story follows two young women from different social backgrounds who meet inside one such institution. Ana, a rebellious 19-year-old from Barcelona, is sent by her wealthy father to a Patronato facility overseen by the merciless Sister Socorro. Amid the harsh conditions, Ana forms a deep bond with Sole, a friendship tested by escape attempts, reprisals, and an ultimate sacrifice.
	</p>
<p>
	Billed as a powerful human drama, “Pray for Us” seeks to provoke reflection. “I am very interested in films that take the viewer on an intense emotional journey, that introduce them to an unknown universe and confront them with moral dilemmas they would never consider in their everyday life,” said Monzón.</p>
<p>
	A Spain-France co-production with Noodles Production, the film will be released theatrically in Spain by Elastica, a top indie producer-distributor (“Alcarràs”) ranging from arthouse to more upscale mainstream.</p>
<p>
	<a target="_blank" href="https://variety.com/2000/film/reviews/the-heart-of-the-warrior-1200460693/"><em>Variety</em> described</a> Monzón’s debut “The Heart of the Warrior” as “combining the commercial and the idiosyncratic to sometimes sizzling effect,” a remark that proved prophetic. His sophomore outing, “The Biggest Robbery Never Told,” and only English language turn “The Kovak Box,” with Alex de la Iglesia co-scribe Guerricaechevarría now on board as co-writer, paved the way to his 2009 breakout smash “Cell 211.” Wildly entertaining but subtly revealing political undercurrents, it grabbed eight Goyas.</p>
<p>
	Monzón followed with Luis Tosar starrer “El Niño,” a social-issue thriller boasting some of Spanish cinema’s most dynamic action, before returning with sea-cruise set caper “Yukatan,” and 2021’s “The Laws of the Border,” adapting Javier Cercas’ novel, selected for San Sebastián and scoring the second best IMDB rating of his career and five Goyas including adapted screenplay.</p>

	<a target="_blank" href="https://variety.com/t/madrid/">Madrid</a> reaffirmed its status as Spain’s leading audiovisual powerhouse at the 73rd San Sebastián Film Festival on Sept. 21, presenting key data, strategic initiatives and upcoming plans to support the industry’s continued growth. </p>
<p>
	Speaking in turns were Inmaculada Sánchez Cervera, general coordinator of the Madrid mayor’s office, Carlo d’Ursi, VP Audiovisual Cluster of Madrid and Luis Martín Izquierdo, vice minister of Culture, Tourism and Sport of the Community of Madrid – the Madrid region.
	</p>
<p>
	Now on its fifth year, the event – organized by the <a target="_blank" href="https://variety.com/t/madrid-audiovisual-cluster/">Madrid Audiovisual Cluster</a> with support from the City Council and the Community of Madrid – brought together industry professionals, investors and public institutions to spotlight the region’s robust infrastructure, talent pool and growing international appeal.
</p>
<p>
	<strong>A Strategic Sector Backed by Investment</strong></p>
<p>
	The audiovisual industry is considered strategic by both city and regional authorities – not only for its cultural impact, but for its substantial economic contribution. According to a recent study by the AFI (Analistas Financieros Internacionales):</p>
<div>
<ul>
<li>The sector contributes 2.6% of the GDP and 2.8% of employment in the Community of Madrid—well above the national average.</li>
<li>It generates €2.3 billion ($2.7 billion) in direct GVA, with a total economic impact of over €7.2 billion ($8.45 billion)</li>
<li>The region accounts for 28.9% of all active audiovisual companies in Spain, but generates 74.7% of the sector’s revenue and 47.2% of its employment.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<p>
	“Madrid is undoubtedly – and increasingly – a reference point in the global audiovisual landscape,” said Martín Izquierdo, adding: “It is also becoming an increasingly significant production hub, thanks to a combination of key factors for the industry: The exceptional level of development and competitiveness of the ecosystem, made up of more than 3,500 companies and the high level of qualification and specialization of the over 30,000 professionals who work in the audiovisual sector in Madrid.”</p>
<p>
	“Madrid is home to the largest concentration of the audiovisual sector in Spain – this includes both independent cinema and major streamers. Movistar Plus+, <a target="_blank" href="https://variety.com/t/netflix/">Netflix</a>, Disney, Amazon – all operate across Spain, but they do so from Madrid. The same goes for both public and private TV corporations like Mediaset, Atresmedia, and Televisión Española,” D’Ursi pointed out.

	“The call for feature film production grants is endowed with €2 million ($2.34m), extendable by an additional €2 million, and is currently in the resolution phase. The call for promotion and distribution grants is endowed with €1 million ($1.17m) also potentially extendable by another €2 million,” said Sánchez Cervera.</p>
<p>
	She added: “The results of this effort, I believe, are well known and more than evident. In the 2024–2025 awards season, the films supported by the City Council have truly shone. We have productions like ‘<a target="_blank" href="https://variety.com/t/saturn-return/">Saturn Return</a>’ (‘Segundo premio’), which, as you know, won three Goya Awards; ‘Buscando a Coque,’ awarded Best Ibero-American Comedy at the Platino Awards or titles like ‘Ciudad sin Sueño’ and ‘Anoche conquisté Tebas,’ both born from the residency program and awarded at Cannes and Venice, respectively.”</p>
<p>
	<strong>Public Support and Policy Momentum</strong></p>
<p>
	The City of Madrid invests over €6 million ($7.04 million) annually into the audiovisual sector, supporting the entire value chain – from development and production to distribution and exhibition. “Since the formation of the current administration, we have invested more than €11 million ($12.9 m) —exclusively through the General Coordination of the Mayor’s Office—in the promotion of the audiovisual industry,” said Sánchez Cervera.</p>
<p>
	The Community of Madrid is now developing a new strategic plan for the audiovisual industry, which will include:</p>
<div>
<ul>
<li>Doubling production grants</li>
<li>New programs to attract investment</li>
<li>Initiatives to support talent development, innovation and sustainability</li>
<li>A renewed focus on promoting all municipalities in the region as filming destinations</li>
</ul>
</div>
<p>
	<strong>AI and Innovation at Iberseries</strong></p>
<p>
	As part of its commitment to innovation, the Cluster will host an AI Workshop on Oct. 1 during the Madrid confab Iberseries, showcasing seven case studies—including applications in VFX, scripted workflows, sports content creation and marketing—featuring speakers from leading companies such as El Ranchito, Brandominus, Pendular and The Film Agency.</p>
<p>
	“Madrid offers a set of competitive advantages that are hard to match – from world-class professionals and diverse locations to institutional support and legal certainty,” said Martin Izquierdo, “Our challenge now is to continue showcasing these strengths to the world.”</p>

	Pickford’s AI series “<a target="_blank" href="https://variety.com/t/whispers/">Whispers</a>” bowed at Busan Asian Contents &amp; Film Market, offering audiences an interactive teaser that showcased the potential of AI-driven storytelling.</p>
<p>
	Emmy-winning producer Bernie Su (“The Lizzie Bennet Diaries”) said his motivation for creating an AI series stemmed from his desire to explore new narrative formats. “The storyteller to me is that what you’re about to see, this experience, is a story experience that cannot be done without AI,” Su explained. ““It’s a new art form that, at its speed and at its fidelity, cannot be done without AI and the technology that Pickford pioneered, and put in this experience.”
	</p>
<p>
	The showcase allowed audiences to participate through a QR code-enabled chat room where they could provide instant feedback. Stephen Piron, co-founder of <a target="_blank" href="https://variety.com/t/pickford-ai/">Pickford AI</a>, described the audience’s phones as “the conductor’s baton, painter’s brush, and storyteller’s voice.”
</p>
<p>
	Though brief, the clip demonstrated how the interactive format functions, particularly through a catchphrase generated in Marcus Kent’s dialogue. The post-screening panel featured voice actors Brandon Soohoo (“Tropic Thunder”) and Heavenly Reyna (“The Bold and the Beautiful”), who discussed their experience working on the project. </p>
<p>
	“I honestly did not recognize myself. It was really interesting. I recognized different things that I have said, but nothing altogether,” Reyna said.</p>
<p>
	Soohoo echoed similar sentiments about the AI voice synthesis results. “I recognize certain things that we were recording, like a portion that we did kind of happier or a little bit more anxious,” he said. “But some of the inflections are for sure familiar, but most of them, I didn’t necessarily say that.”
	</p>
<p>
	Addressing the use of actors’ voices, Su emphasized the importance of consent and transparency, and <a target="_blank" href="https://variety.com/2025/digital/news/sag-framework-pickford-ai-whispers-voice-actor-casting-1236515884/">working within SAG’s framework for AI projects</a>. “We are using a voice with their approval” Su said. “But some actors would pass, not because they were against AI, but they were concerned about the stigma that the audience would have against them.”</p>
<div><p>
	Reyna acknowledged the broader industry concerns while expressing trust in the project. “For me personally, I have a lot of reservations with AI just in the creative industry, but I trust Bernie, and I also trust his visions and his innovation,” she said. “And I thought it was cool.”</p></div>

	<a target="_blank" href="https://variety.com/t/john-oliver/">John Oliver</a> used most of his “<a target="_blank" href="https://variety.com/t/last-week-tonight/">Last Week Tonight</a>” episode on Sept. 21 breaking down <a target="_blank" href="https://variety.com/t/jimmy-kimmel/">Jimmy Kimmel</a>‘s <a target="_blank" href="https://variety.com/2025/tv/news/nexstar-jimmy-kimmel-abc-charlie-kirk-1236522584/">indefinite suspension</a> at ABC. At the end of his segment analyzing the developments of the last week and corporate players involved, Oliver used the opportunity to speak directly to Disney CEO Bob Iger.</p>
<p>
	“Hi there, Bob. We haven’t met, but you probably know me as America’s third favorite Zazu,” Oliver said, recalling his “Lion King” voice role. “Congratulations on recasting that role, by the way. It was a fun thing to learn about after the fact. Anyway, one day, the history of the time we’re living through is going to be written, and when it is, I’m not sure it’s those in this administration who are even gonna come off the worst. Now don’t get me wrong, they’re going to come off <em>terribly</em>. But history is also going to remember the cowards who definitely knew better but still let things happen, whether it was for money, convenience or just comfort. I know this is something of a tough sell, and it can be a bit of anathema to risk-averse business leaders. 
	</p>
<p>
	“But I will say this,” he continued. “If we’ve learned nothing else from this administration’s second term so far, and I don’t think we have, is that giving the bully your lunch money doesn’t make him go away. It just makes him come back hungrier each time. They are never going to stop. They’ve literally said that openly. After Kimmel’s suspension, Trump posted, ‘That leaves Jimmy and Seth, two total losers on fake news NBC. Their ratings are also horrible. Do it, NBC.’ And [FCC chairman Brendan] Carr hinted that ‘The View’ might be next. The fucking ‘View!’ Look, at some point you’re going to have to draw a line. So I’d argue, why not draw it right here? And when they come to you with stupid ridiculous demands, picking fights that you know you could win in court instead of rolling over, why not stand up and use four key words they don’t tend to teach you in business school. Not ‘OK, you’re the boss.’ Not ‘Whatever you say goes.’ But instead, the only phrase that can genuinely make a weak bully go away. And that is, ‘Fuck you, make me.'”

	Busan’s Asian Contents &amp; Film Market hosted a lively panel on India–Korea collaborations under the banner “India-Korea Synergies: New Horizons in Co-Productions,” bringing together policymakers, producers and media figures to discuss how the two industries can forge deeper ties.</p>
<p>
	The session featured Prithul Kumar, joint secretary (broadcasting) for India’s Ministry of Information and Broadcasting; actor-producer Arfi Lamba; Anthology Studios president Choi Jae-won; LME Studios CEO Heo Youngkook; media personality Abhishek Gupta; and Nishikant Singh, deputy chief of mission at the Embassy of India in Seoul.
	</p>
<p>
	Kumar outlined India’s incentive framework, stressing that international productions – including Korean projects – can access rebates of up to $3.6 million, with approvals granted in as little as 18 days. “Our co-production agreements mean films can qualify as national films in both countries, opening markets and maximizing support,” he noted.
</p>
<p>
	Choi highlighted his company’s <a target="_blank" href="https://variety.com/2025/film/news/drishyam-korean-remake-director-1236525498/">remake of Indian blockbuster “Drishyam”</a> for the Korean market, describing it as “a landmark step in bridging storytelling traditions.” Heo discussed his upcoming 3D animation “Astro Station,” made in collaboration with an Indian partner studio, crediting the project’s visual quality to India’s fast-growing VFX ecosystem.</p>
<p>
	Lamba called Asia’s creative industries “the new superpower,” pointing to India’s experience in backend VFX for Disney, Pixar and Marvel. “This is the time to take the front foot, go global together, and recover faster through shared resources,” he said.
	</p>
<p>
	Gupta, long based in Seoul and nicknamed “the most famous Indian in Korea,” emphasized cultural affinity and the need to break stereotypes about Indian cinema. “Korean audiences still think of Indian films as just song-and-dance epics, but younger viewers are ready for action-driven, layered stories,” he said.</p>
<div><p>
	Singh added that increased festival participation and talent exchanges could “create a real bridge” between the industries, while all panelists agreed on the potential for Indo-Korean stories to resonate across Asia and beyond.</p></div>

	<a target="_blank" href="https://variety.com/t/madrid/">Madrid</a> reaffirmed its status as Spain’s leading audiovisual powerhouse at the 73rd San Sebastián Film Festival on Sept. 21, presenting key data, strategic initiatives and upcoming plans to support the industry’s continued growth. </p>
<p>
	Speaking in turns were Inmaculada Sánchez Cervera, general coordinator of the Madrid mayor’s office, Carlo d’Ursi, VP Audiovisual Cluster of Madrid and Luis Martín Izquierdo, vice minister of Culture, Tourism and Sport of the Community of Madrid – the Madrid region.
	</p>
<p>
	Now on its fifth year, the event – organized by the <a target="_blank" href="https://variety.com/t/madrid-audiovisual-cluster/">Madrid Audiovisual Cluster</a> with support from the City Council and the Community of Madrid – brought together industry professionals, investors and public institutions to spotlight the region’s robust infrastructure, talent pool and growing international appeal.
</p>
<p>
	<strong>A Strategic Sector Backed by Investment</strong></p>
<p>
	The audiovisual industry is considered strategic by both city and regional authorities – not only for its cultural impact, but for its substantial economic contribution. According to a recent study by the AFI (Analistas Financieros Internacionales):</p>
<div>
<ul>
<li>The sector contributes 2.6% of the GDP and 2.8% of employment in the Community of Madrid—well above the national average.</li>
<li>It generates €2.3 billion ($2.7 billion) in direct GVA, with a total economic impact of over €7.2 billion ($8.45 billion)</li>
<li>The region accounts for 28.9% of all active audiovisual companies in Spain, but generates 74.7% of the sector’s revenue and 47.2% of its employment.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<p>
	“Madrid is undoubtedly – and increasingly – a reference point in the global audiovisual landscape,” said Martín Izquierdo, adding: “It is also becoming an increasingly significant production hub, thanks to a combination of key factors for the industry: The exceptional level of development and competitiveness of the ecosystem, made up of more than 3,500 companies and the high level of qualification and specialization of the over 30,000 professionals who work in the audiovisual sector in Madrid.”</p>
<p>
	“Madrid is home to the largest concentration of the audiovisual sector in Spain – this includes both independent cinema and major streamers. Movistar Plus+, <a target="_blank" href="https://variety.com/t/netflix/">Netflix</a>, Disney, Amazon – all operate across Spain, but they do so from Madrid. The same goes for both public and private TV corporations like Mediaset, Atresmedia, and Televisión Española,” D’Ursi pointed out.
