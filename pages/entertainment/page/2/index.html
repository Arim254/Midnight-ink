              <div><p>
	Following the explosive violence of “Destruction Babies,” Japanese filmmaker Mariko Tetsuya has pivoted to explore a different kind of devastation in “<a target="_blank" href="https://variety.com/t/dear-stranger/">Dear Stranger</a>” — the quiet collapse of a marriage under the weight of unspoken truths and cultural displacement. </p>
<p>
	The drama, which had its international premiere at the <a target="_blank" href="https://variety.com/t/busan-international-film-festival/">Busan International Film Festival</a>, stars <a target="_blank" href="https://variety.com/t/nishijima-hidetoshi/">Nishijima Hidetoshi</a> (Oscar-winning “Drive My Car”) and Gwei Lun-Mei (“Black Coal, Thin Ice”). Set against the backdrop of New York, the film follows Kenji (Nishijima), a Japanese professor desperately seeking tenure, and Jane (Gwei), a Taiwanese-American puppeteer struggling to balance motherhood with her artistic identity. When their young son Kai goes missing, the couple’s carefully constructed life begins to unravel.
	</p>
<p>
	For Mariko, whose previous work “Destruction Babies” earned him the Golden Leopard for Best Emerging Director at Locarno, the shift to emotional rather than physical violence was sparked by his return to Japan during the pandemic. “The starting point was on the plane returning to Japan after a year living in the U.S., when a national state of emergency was declared,” Mariko explains. “The world suddenly changed and was engulfed in uncertainty, and I began to think about the family — the smallest unit of society.”
</p>
<p>
	The director deliberately moved away from the “absurd violence” of his earlier work to focus on “the tragedy of drifting apart precisely because they care for each other.” </p>
<p>
	Central to the film’s visual and thematic language is the motif of ruins, both literal and metaphorical. Kenji lectures on the difference between Japanese static views of ruins versus Western dynamic interpretations and carries the memory of past earthquakes. “For Kenji, who studies ruins, the collapse of his own family into ruins marked both a beautiful and fleeting beginning,” Mariko notes. “I set this as the backbone of the screenplay and built the themes of the story around it.”
	</p>
<p>
	The ruins metaphor extends to Jane’s puppet performances in abandoned theaters, where larger-than-life puppets become extensions of her suppressed emotions. Working with Blair Thomas, Mariko developed choreography that allowed the puppetry to serve as Jane’s emotional outlet. “For Jane’s character, it was essential to show both her passion for puppetry and her conflict in balancing it with family life,” the director explains.</p>
<p>
	The film represents a true international co-production between Japan, Taiwan and the U.S., with filming in New York, editing in Taiwan, and a multinational cast and crew. For Mariko, the experience reinforced cinema’s power as a universal language. “I approached filmmaking with that ambiguity in mind,” he says regarding the challenges of multilingual communication. “Since the staff and cast came from different languages and cultures, our ongoing communication naturally became reflected in the film itself.”</p>
<p>
	Nishijima brings his characteristic intensity to Kenji, a man whose academic arrogance masks deep insecurity and desperation. “I wanted to portray Kenji as someone who is doing his best to live though imperfect — a character that reflects most of us,” the actor explains. Nishijima, who has built a career spanning Japanese and international productions from “Drive My Car” to Apple TV+’s “Sunny,” filmed in New York with a small, multinational cast and crew.</p>
<p>
	“Through this experience, I was reminded that film itself is a kind of universal language, and when everyone shares a strong passion to create something meaningful, it can take shape in ways that don’t rely on language,” he reflects.</p>
<p>
	Gwei Lun-Mei delivers an equally nuanced performance as Jane, a woman caught between her artistic ambitions and maternal responsibilities. The Taiwanese actor, who has worked across multiple film industries, found particular resonance in Jane’s struggle with cultural displacement. “Having studied abroad myself, I’ve felt that truly settling and being recognized by people from another culture is very difficult,” she says.</p>
<p>
	The puppet sequences became crucial for expressing Jane’s interior life. “The puppet scenes were extremely important for Jane. On one hand, they represented her passion; on the other, they were like another soul,” Gwei explains. 
	</p>
<p>
	At its core, “Dear Stranger” interrogates the nature of love itself — particularly the gap between feeling and expression, intention and understanding. For Mariko, the question was sparked by photographer Masafumi Sanai’s assessment that he had “no affection, but having love” when they worked together on “From Miyamoto to You.”</p>
<div><p>
	“For me, love exists in cinema,” Mariko says. “It’s not an easily understandable emotion — it accumulates quietly and surely, through countless human connections. It arises so naturally from passion that it feels almost embarrassing to put into words, yet it’s also fragile, as if it might disappear if left unspoken.”</p></div>

	London and LA-based studio <a target="_blank" href="https://variety.com/t/the-ink-factory/">The Ink Factory</a> is teaming with Korean production company VO Media to develop a series adaptation of <a target="_blank" href="https://variety.com/t/john-le-carre-2/">John le Carré</a>‘s acclaimed espionage thriller “<a target="_blank" href="https://variety.com/t/a-most-wanted-man/">A Most Wanted Man</a>.”</p>
<p>
	The Korea-set adaptation will be scripted by Kim Yun-shin, with VO Media’s Kim Shin-ho producing. VO Media’s Park Bo-kyeong will oversee development alongside The Ink Factory’s Executive Producer for Korea, Junyoung Jang. Executive producers include Tessa Inkelaar, Simon Cornwell, Stephen Cornwell and Michele Wolkoff for The Ink Factory, plus Joe Tsai and Arthur Wang from 127 Wall Productions.
	</p>
<p>
	The 2008 novel centers on an illegal Muslim immigrant arriving in Hamburg from Russia, who becomes caught between intelligence services from multiple countries in the post-9/11 era. The story explores themes of paranoia and moral ambiguity in the war on terror.
</p>
<p>
	“John le Carré’s ‘A Most Wanted Man’ is not simply about espionage or the war on terror. At its core, the story asks: under the name of the nation, how easily can an individual become a sacrifice?” said producer Kim Shin-ho and writer Kim Yun-shin. “We were drawn to reinterpret this story within the context of modern Korean history — a history marked by war, division, dictatorship, and countless sacrifices made in the name of security.”</p>
<p>
	Simon Cornwell and Stephen Cornwell, founders and co-CEOs at The Ink Factory, said: “‘A Most Wanted Man’ is a poignant exploration of trust, power and morality — themes that remain deeply relevant today. As we continue expanding the global legacy of the le Carré canon, it’s a privilege to forge our first partnership with VO Media, who have a very impressive track record in crafting masterfully plotted projects. Together, we look forward to bringing a distinctly Korean perspective to this gripping story and to reimagine le Carré’s intricate world of espionage through a fresh cultural lens for audiences in Korea and far beyond.”
	</p>
<p>
	Park Bo-kyeong at VO Media added: “This collaboration allows us not only to adapt one of le Carré’s most human and politically sharp works, but also to learn and grow through The Ink Factory’s experience across Europe, the U.S. and beyond.”</p>
<p>
	VO Media, founded in 2015 by Park and Kim, has credits including “Why Her,” “I Can Hear Your Voice” and “The King 2 Hearts.” The partnership represents The Ink Factory’s continued expansion into Asian markets, following projects like the Hindi-language adaptation of “The Night Manager” for Disney+ Hotstar.</p>

	<a target="_blank" href="https://variety.com/t/daniel-burman/">Daniel Burman</a>, icon of the New Argentine Cinema and now one of Argentina’s foremost feature/TV series writer-directors and showrunners, is shooting a new series “So Far So Good” (“El Resto Bien”). Created by Burman, it re-teams him with <a target="_blank" href="https://variety.com/t/daniel-hendler/">Daniel Hendler</a> – star of 2004’s “Lost Embrace,” which won Burman a Berlin Jury Grand Prix and Hendler a Silver Bear for actor.</p>
<p>
	Hendler and Burman will co-direct together all the series’ eight half-hour episodes. Far So Good” is produced by Uruguay H.Q.-ed <a target="_blank" href="https://variety.com/t/cimarron-2/">Cimarrón</a> (“Barrabrava,” <a target="_blank" href="https://variety.com/2023/film/global/alfredo-castro-paula-hernandez-ravaging-wind-1235705979/">“A Ravaging Wind”</a>) and Argentina’s <a target="_blank" href="https://variety.com/t/oficina-burman/">Oficina Burman</a> (“Victoria Small,”<a target="_blank" href="https://variety.com/2022/tv/festivals/lone-scherfig-daniel-burman-the-shift-yosi-1235182065/"> “Yosi, the Regretful Spy”</a>), whose latest series, “Maledictions” bowed Sept. 12 on Netflix, hitting its Global non-English Top 10 TV Shows. Both are <a target="_blank" href="https://variety.com/t/the-mediapro-studio/">The Mediapro Studio</a> companies. 
	</p>
<p>
	Oficina Burman and Cimarrón are producing “So Far So Good” for <a target="_blank" href="https://variety.com/t/flow/">Flow</a>, the Argentine cable TV, internet and SVOD operator. Flow has acquired distribution rights for Latin America; The Mediapro Studio owns rights to the rest of the world. 
</p>
<p>
	Many of Burman’s films are autobiographical, exploring nuanced family relations and questions of identity with a hallmark warm irony, seeking as well an emotional punch.<br />Currently half way through its shoot in Uruguay and Paraguay, “So Far So Good” has all this in arguably the most autobiographical of Burman’s works. </p>
<p>
	His alter ego Ariel (<a target="_blank" href="https://variety.com/t/benjamin-vicuna/">Benjamin Vicuña</a>, “Locked Up”), a successful cartoonist is now in seeming danger of emotional burnout as he turns 50, trapped in a world – Burman’s first irony – that he has created himself. Caught in the vortex of a frenzied social life, given the pressing needs of his five children and constant attention required by his parents, already on the verge of physical and emotional collapse, he is told by his doctor that he has a hernia and shouldn’t lift anything weighing more than three kilos.
	</p>
<p>
	“This limitation sparks a journey which is comic and around where Ariel has to discover what really worries us in life. Will he be able to recuperate his freedom or be crushed by his own reality?” the synopsis ends by asking.</p>
<p>
	Ariel’s crisis is of his own making, in more ways than one, Burman told <em>Variety</em>, calling “So Far So Good” a “human dramedy” about “men’s mid-life crises with themselves, that moment of life when you ask: ‘When will there be time for me?’”</p>
<p>
	He added: “Mid-life men issues haven’t addressed so much in recent years what happens to men with regard to themselves. Or they’re focused in relation to women or partners. What’s been left somewhat aside is men’s crises with themselves.”</p>
<p>
	Series leads are Vicuña, Violeta Urtizberea (“Las estrellas”), Rita Cortese (‘Wild Tales’) and Martín Seefeld (“Pretenders”). Guest artists take in Andrea Frigerio (“The Distinguished Citizen”), Alejandro Awada (“Yosi, the Repentant Spy”) and Marina Bellati (“Envious”). The series is written by Burman and frequent recent collaborators Ariel Gurevich (‘Transmitzvah’) and Andrés Gelós and Pablo Gelós, (“Maledictions”) as well as Eloy Burman.</p>
<p>
	<em>Variety </em>chatted to Burman briefly about his new series:</p>
<p>
	<strong>All films and TV series are, to a certain extent autobiographical. “So Far So Good” seems to be perhaps your most obviously autobiographical work to date….</strong><br />This is conscious. Sometimes you tell stories you need to tell, and at others stories that you need to be told. I was looking for a story to establish a dialog with the moment of life I’m going through, middle-age – I’m 52 – where you’re father to your children and father to your parents. Without a sense of victimization. I created a family, which is marvellous. But the time you have for yourself is the small remainder after being a father and son, and it becomes smaller and smaller.</p>
<p>
	<strong>In the series, Ariel also suffers from a hernia.…</strong><br />Yes, your body begins to fail and you have a sense you just have some years to do everything you haven’t done. Your body begins to abandon you, but remaining are your responsibilities, a lot of which are self-imposed. Many times we use them to escape from real responsibility, which is taking responsibility for what we are.
	</p>
<p>
	<strong>Isn’t this a larger masculine trait?</strong><br />Yes: It’s a specific facet of men: How we’re fascinated in conquering empires, going out to conquer the world, to escape from our own world, our small microcosmos. How we go to our Waterloos to escape confronting our own families. Again, that will be treated without any sense of accusation. I’m not so much deconstructing masculinity as constructing it, because it still hasn’t been constructed.</p>
<p>
	<strong>In “So Far So Good” you’re working with people you’ve worked with before over multiple films. Is that just a coincidence?</strong><br />It’s not by chance. rather like a party with friends. On the shoot, you can look around and see so many people you want to give a hug to or have a coffee with them. Daniel Hendler is one case. We began working together over 20 years ago with “The Lost Embrace.” I was moved by his becoming a director. He’s slightly younger but also addresses the same middle-age issues. I’ve worked with many of the screenwriters on “Yosi, the Regretful Spy” and “Maledictions.” It’s a very feel-good series, and made to connect, made not only with a male gaze but inviting other viewpoints, those of how our children and parents look at us.</p>
<p>
	<strong>This is your first collaboration with Flow?</strong><br />Yes, I’m enjoying working with them immensely. They’ve also given me absolute creative freedom. They are the perfect partner for this project. I’ve now worked with Cimarrón on several titles. The Mediapro Studio is rather like a household where you take each project to your cousin, uncle or brother. We really work like a family. Cimarrón is a sister company. I live in Buenos Aires but each time I shoot, I now move to Montevideo. It’s like a second home.</p>

	Top executives, government leaders and international figures gathered during the <a target="_blank" href="https://variety.com/t/san-sebastian-film-festival-2/">San Sebastián Film Festival</a> this Sunday to reflect on Spain’s position within the European audiovisual industry and how to navigate a constantly evolving market. </p>
<p>
	The event, whose third edition was titled “Leading the Audiovisual of the Future,” is held by Spain’s Ministry for Digital Transformation and Public Service through the State Secretariat for Digitalization and <a target="_blank" href="https://variety.com/t/artificial-intelligence/">Artificial Intelligence</a>. The gathering aims to reflect on the audiovisual landscape in Europe and understand how Spanish professionals can thrive in an industry constantly facing major changes. This year, conversations focused largely on two key issues: artificial intelligence and Spain’s need for better regulation when it comes to protecting Spanish IP. 
	</p>
<p>
	In her closing remarks, Secretary of State for Digitalization and Artificial Intelligence María González Veracruz said hosting the conference for a third year felt like the “consolidation of a space.” “The work of everyone in this room is crucial to Spain being the most successful non-English audiovisual content producer in Europe,” she added. “Above all, we are going to continue to invest. This is a moment of consolidation. It is difficult to understand new tools, but what we are doing is very powerful.” 
</p>
<p>
	Ignasi Camós, director of Spain’s Institute of Cinematography and Audiovisual Arts (ICAA), said it is “essential to bet on enhancing creative, technical, and production talent at a national level and to have Spain as a bridge between Europe and Latin America.”
	</p>
<p>
	“We must get increasingly involved in international projects and co-productions,” he reiterated. “I believe this is the element that can give us a qualitative leap internationally, giving us prestige and important recognition. But we must be accompanied by European allies to compete with other markets. We are committed to opening up markets, including countries in the Asian continent.” </p>
<p>
	It’s important to note that the conference took place just an hour after the <a target="_blank" href="https://variety.com/t/european-producers-club/">European Producers Club</a> (EPC) shared a statement highlighting their concerns over the recently proposed AgoraEU Regulation (2028-2034). The European Union program is proposed by the European Commission to support and promote culture and media. According to the EPC, the “new MEDIA strand raises serious concerns for the future of independent European audiovisual creation.”</p>
<p>
	Key concerns include “weakened support for independent productions: the removal of the independence criterion; unclear budget and shifting priorities; open doors to non-European entities; and complex and opaque governance.” A common line amongst these concerns is a threat to cultural sovereignty and the increasing dominat position of U.S. streamers. Although the EPC statement was not addressed directly during the conference, these issues were widely discussed, especially regarding cultural homogeneity, the increasingly digital behavior of young audiences, and the proliferation of AI programs developed by foreign countries. </p>
<p>
	Below, you will find the main takeaways from this year’s Leading the Audiovisual of the Future conference:</p>
<p>
	<strong>AI: Create jobs, not replace them</strong></p>
<p>
	As it was to be expected, AI dominated much of the conversations at the conference. During a panel on new tendencies in the audiovisual sector, CEO at Professor Octopus AI Laboratory Carlos Fernández de Vigo, tried to appease some of the apprehensions by emphasizing artificial intelligence’s potential to create jobs in the industry. “Thanks to AI, we have projects that are viable now that were not viable just a few years ago,” he reiterated, stating that AI allows for the creation of new business models, “and therefore the creation of new jobs.” </p>
<p>
	Nathalie Martínez, president at the Spanish Federation of Animation and Visual Effects Producers Associations (Diboos), said that “without technology there is no cinema.” “We haven’t just discovered AI. We’ve been working with it for years, even if they were more primitive forms beforehand. We are using it as a tool. I want to emphasize it’s a tool and tools don’t replace people who work with those tools.”
	</p>
<p>
	<strong>No to cultural homogeneization</strong></p>
<p>
	When speaking about the great fears stemming from technologies such as AI, Martínez warned that the industry should be careful of how technology developed and championed by other countries can contribute to cultural homogeneization. “What we create should represent us,” she said. “We should have original stories. To me, that is our greatest obstacle.”</p>
<p>
	Lucía Recalde, Head of Creative Media Unit at the European Commission, gave a brief presentation of the recently finished Media Outlook Report for 2025. The executive echoed Martínez’s fears, especially when it comes to major U.S. streamers. The new report showed how young audiences are increasingly concentrated within digital platforms. “And we know those aren’t European,” she emphasized, before showing numbers highlighting that 70% of the Spanish market for streamers consists of non-European players such as Netflix, Disney and Amazon Prime Video. “The weight of American companies has grown in the last year while European companies have decreased,” she alerted.</p>
<p>
	<strong>Spanish IP belongs to Spain</strong></p>
<p>
	In what was perhaps the most applauded passage of the entire conference, the president of the Galician Audiovisual Cluster, Alfonso Blanco, reiterated that the most pressing issue within the Spanish industry today is creative rights retention. “We need a law that protects the creator and the product,” he said, reiterating that other major European powerhouses such as France and the U.K have long-established regulations providing security for creatives when it comes to original IP, while Spain still lacks that sense of security. “We need to regulate the TV market,” added Blanco. “We are one of the markets that faces the greatest difficulties in retaining IP rights. There is a fault in the system.” </p>
<p>
	Alfonso del Río, director at Culture CAP7, echoed this thought: “It doesn’t make sense. Imagine you do something great, others take it, and you never see it again?” Rights retention is a key point in financing conversations for del Río, who often works with international partners. The executive said that now, “we are starting to see financing instruments that allow us to go to international studios and say we have an idea, but I want it to be my own because I have the capacity to assume the risks.” Del Río reiterated, however, that having to play with such high stakes shouldn’t take precedence over legislation that protects Spanish IP. 
	</p>
<p>
	<strong>Talent is not enough: control distribution at home and internationally</strong></p>
<p>
	Filmin co-founder José Antonio de Luna said the feeling is that players “always focus all their strategies on the raw material, which is creation. But we forget that if we don’t get the content to an audience, it doesn’t matter how much talent we have.” </p>
<p>
	Recalde highlighted how research shows that “European cinema does not travel enough to other countries.” Currently, only 44% of European films travel internationally. Within Spain’s domestic exhibition market, U.S. dominance is also an issue, with U.S. films making up 20% of the offer but 60% of the box office, while European films make up 60% of the offer but only 31% of the box office. </p>
<p>
	<strong>What is the European Model?</strong></p>
<p>
	Speaking on the importance — and the difficulties — of co-producing with other European countries, de Luna said that Spain “lacks the thought of a fully European model while also lacking the tools of how to think it.”</p>
<p>
	Helena Suárez Jaqueti, partner at law firm ECIJA and founder of E-LAB, praised the co-production model as a way of exposing Spanish professionals to international expertise without requiring them to leave Spain, but pointed out that because different European Union countries have different legal guidelines for co-productions, it is a “pretty difficult process” to co-produce. “You have to take into account each of the legislations, and it’s difficult when you are a European platform that wants to reach several markets.” </p>
<p>
	Clara Ruipérez, director of legal content strategy at Movistar Plus+, emphasized that while film has seen a rise in co-productions in recent years, the model is still fairly difficult to realize within TV. “We’d love to be always open to [co-productions], but that is not the reality. [The model] is still missing a lot.”</p>

              <template class="article-body">
                <div><p>
	Director Larry Yang and producer Victoria Hon are considering a sequel to <a target="_blank" href="https://variety.com/t/jackie-chan/">Jackie Chan</a>‘s “The Shadow’s Edge” as the action thriller makes its international festival debut at the <a target="_blank" href="https://variety.com/t/busan-international-film-festival/">Busan International Film Festival</a>‘s Open Cinema section.</p>
<p>
	The crime thriller, which has held the No. 1 position at the China box office for four consecutive weekends, represents a reimagining of the Hong Kong classic “Eye in the Sky” for contemporary audiences. Director Larry Yang, whose debut feature “Mountain Cry” served as the closing film of the 20th Busan festival, collaborates again with Chan following their 2023 success “Ride On.”
	</p>
<p>
	“The challenge didn’t come from shaping the story into today’s tech-driven world, but from fitting into today’s audiences’ cinematic tastes,” Yang tells <em>Variety</em>. “I wouldn’t mind tell the same story again if the audiences today could appreciate it, but I guess that would not be the case. Finding the right tone – a combination of right characters, rhythm and emotional flow – for today’s audiences is more important than finding the right story settings.”
</p>
<p>
	The film features 85-90% new material while drawing inspiration from the original story. “My respect for the original come from my willingness to buy the remake right even if it’s just 1%, because that 1% is the idea of a film,” Yang explains. “A great idea always comes before a story. There can be countless ways to tell that idea, but a great idea is a great idea.”</p>
<p>
	Yang’s approach to the remake prioritized creative freedom over strict adherence to the source material. “My opinion of a remake doesn’t necessarily have to be an exact scene-by-scene reboot of the same story, but instead a new breed of the same idea,” he says. “Therefore, I didn’t worry too much about balance. I primarily focused on what would be good for my story and my tone surrounding this great idea.”
	</p>
<p>
	In “The Shadow’s Edge,” Chan plays a veteran surveillance expert pulled out of retirement to investigate a high-stakes heist in Macau. Tony Leung Ka-fai reprises his villain role from the original “Eye in the Sky,” though Yang reimagined the character for the contemporary setting.</p>
<p>
	Yang approached Leung’s character as a “simple speculation of ‘what if,’ like in a parallel universe. What if that guy didn’t die? What if he survived, was saved by a bunch of kids, raised them, trained them, and teamed up with them two decades later? What if, by spending years with these boys, this ruthless guy began to grow a bit of something called love in him? And, what if, due to some misunderstanding or miscommunication, the boy betrayed his love?”</p>
<p>
	The film blends surveillance technology with character-driven action sequences. “The idea of a covert surveillance team on foot searching for a ghost came from the original story,” Yang notes. “Technology serves as obstacles and opportunities on both sides, giving new twists to the story. I made sure this part never exceeded the flow of intensive energy while telling the story. It’s still a ‘human story,’ never tech-driven, but wit-driven.”</p>
<p>
	Yang emphasizes that action sequences serve narrative purposes beyond spectacle. “Action served as a continuation of a dialogue, a continuation of a quiet and covert surveillance mission, and a continuation of the evil-fighting barrier which technology alone couldn’t reach,” he explains. “We built sequences that ‘speak’ through character by always holding on to the human factors.”</p>
<p>
	Regarding Chan’s performance capabilities, Yang remains confident: “Jackie can still fight, and this movie is far from reaching his limit.”</p>
<p>
	Producer Victoria Hon emphasizes the film’s thematic exploration of generational dynamics. “We bought the remake rights for ‘Eye in the Sky’ a few years ago and have been developing a story for years,” Hon says. “How to make the story work with today’s audiences has always been an interesting discussion internally. At the same time, we see how AI plays a more and more significant role in modern society. So we wanted to incorporate this element into the story. The idea of old and new became the theme we wanted to discuss and explore.”</p>
<p>
	The challenging production required convincing investors that action films could succeed in the current Chinese market. “I think the biggest challenge was to make this film and this genre itself,” Hon explains. “In the recent China film market, action films were not doing very well at the box office. To make investors believe in this genre, we worked hard on the script and building the characters.”
	</p>
<p>
	Hon credits the strong screenplay with attracting top talent. “I believe the script is always the first milestone of a project – being able to talk to masters like Jackie and Tony and convince them there’s something different and unique in their characters,” she says. The production also featured young actors with extensive wushu training and “young and talented crew members who are very creative and energetic.”</p>
<p>
	Balancing industry veterans with emerging talent became a key production strategy. “This is just like the theme of our film,” Hon notes. “I think it is also one of the key to success – that we respectfully learned from the masters and added young energy and creatives into the film.”</p>
<p>
	Hon describes the collaborative process with Chan: “In all the action scenes, Larry and action director Su Hang had many creative ideas they wanted to try. They shot action demos and showed them to Jackie. With Jackie’s experience, he gave advice on parts that could escalate the tension, or parts that could be dangerous and needed preparations. Other than that, he gave us all his trust, which meant a lot and allowed us to try new things.”</p>
<p>
	The complex action sequences required extensive preparation and significant budget allocation. “Action scenes are very costly and time consuming,” Hon explains. “Even so, we shot the actions scenes with one single crew to keep the action and actor performance consistent. Pre-production time was about 5 months and we shot 84 days. Most of the action scenes were storyboarded, and action demos were filmed during pre-production.”</p>
<p>
	Macau’s distinctive cultural backdrop proved essential to the film’s atmosphere. “Macau is a city with mixed cultural elements. It has very fancy luxurious hotels, and also very old town almost next to each other,” Hon notes. “We loved that atmosphere, and we felt the story and character could blend into the city well.”</p>
<p>
	The production team spent eight months scouting locations, with some sequences emerging organically from the geography. “The script’s locations were based on routes we walked ourselves and felt reasonable to include,” Hon explains. “For example, when the robbers flew from the Macau Tower, they needed to find the nearest platform to land. We stood at the edge of the tower and saw the platform of Wynn Macau. That’s how we first approached the hotel and asked for their support.”
	</p>
<p>
	With Golden Network Asia handling international sales, Hon expresses optimism about overseas performance. “This time most of the sales were made in Cannes earlier this year, and many buyers were confident to promote the film after seeing our demos and reels,” she says. “I look forward to the theatrical release in all the regions and hope for strong box office results.”</p>
<p>
	Looking toward future projects, Yang indicates sequel discussions are underway while he develops additional action projects. “We’re considering the idea of a sequel, but right now we’re unsure what direction it will take,” Yang says. “I don’t want to repeat myself so I will very likely find a new approach. We’ll see how that goes.”</p>
<p>
	The director remains committed to genre exploration. “I love telling a good story, and I will continue searching for great movie ideas and compelling stories to tell, no matter the genre,” Yang explains. “I’m interested to try different genres, including sci-fi or historical stories in the future.”</p>
<p>
	Hon sees continued opportunities for Asian cinema in global markets. “Commercial genres like action and thrillers are probably the most popular ones for reaching global audiences,” she says. “We will keep working in action, and I also hope to do more co-production that can target both local and international audiences.”</p>

              <template class="article-body">
                <div><p>
	Following the explosive violence of “Destruction Babies,” Japanese filmmaker Mariko Tetsuya has pivoted to explore a different kind of devastation in “<a target="_blank" href="https://variety.com/t/dear-stranger/">Dear Stranger</a>” — the quiet collapse of a marriage under the weight of unspoken truths and cultural displacement. </p>
<p>
	The drama, which had its international premiere at the <a target="_blank" href="https://variety.com/t/busan-international-film-festival/">Busan International Film Festival</a>, stars <a target="_blank" href="https://variety.com/t/nishijima-hidetoshi/">Nishijima Hidetoshi</a> (Oscar-winning “Drive My Car”) and Gwei Lun-Mei (“Black Coal, Thin Ice”). Set against the backdrop of New York, the film follows Kenji (Nishijima), a Japanese professor desperately seeking tenure, and Jane (Gwei), a Taiwanese-American puppeteer struggling to balance motherhood with her artistic identity. When their young son Kai goes missing, the couple’s carefully constructed life begins to unravel.
	</p>
<p>
	For Mariko, whose previous work “Destruction Babies” earned him the Golden Leopard for Best Emerging Director at Locarno, the shift to emotional rather than physical violence was sparked by his return to Japan during the pandemic. “The starting point was on the plane returning to Japan after a year living in the U.S., when a national state of emergency was declared,” Mariko explains. “The world suddenly changed and was engulfed in uncertainty, and I began to think about the family — the smallest unit of society.”
</p>
<p>
	The director deliberately moved away from the “absurd violence” of his earlier work to focus on “the tragedy of drifting apart precisely because they care for each other.” </p>
<p>
	Central to the film’s visual and thematic language is the motif of ruins, both literal and metaphorical. Kenji lectures on the difference between Japanese static views of ruins versus Western dynamic interpretations and carries the memory of past earthquakes. “For Kenji, who studies ruins, the collapse of his own family into ruins marked both a beautiful and fleeting beginning,” Mariko notes. “I set this as the backbone of the screenplay and built the themes of the story around it.”
	</p>
<p>
	The ruins metaphor extends to Jane’s puppet performances in abandoned theaters, where larger-than-life puppets become extensions of her suppressed emotions. Working with Blair Thomas, Mariko developed choreography that allowed the puppetry to serve as Jane’s emotional outlet. “For Jane’s character, it was essential to show both her passion for puppetry and her conflict in balancing it with family life,” the director explains.</p>
<p>
	The film represents a true international co-production between Japan, Taiwan and the U.S., with filming in New York, editing in Taiwan, and a multinational cast and crew. For Mariko, the experience reinforced cinema’s power as a universal language. “I approached filmmaking with that ambiguity in mind,” he says regarding the challenges of multilingual communication. “Since the staff and cast came from different languages and cultures, our ongoing communication naturally became reflected in the film itself.”</p>
<p>
	Nishijima brings his characteristic intensity to Kenji, a man whose academic arrogance masks deep insecurity and desperation. “I wanted to portray Kenji as someone who is doing his best to live though imperfect — a character that reflects most of us,” the actor explains. Nishijima, who has built a career spanning Japanese and international productions from “Drive My Car” to Apple TV+’s “Sunny,” filmed in New York with a small, multinational cast and crew.</p>
<p>
	“Through this experience, I was reminded that film itself is a kind of universal language, and when everyone shares a strong passion to create something meaningful, it can take shape in ways that don’t rely on language,” he reflects.</p>
<p>
	Gwei Lun-Mei delivers an equally nuanced performance as Jane, a woman caught between her artistic ambitions and maternal responsibilities. The Taiwanese actor, who has worked across multiple film industries, found particular resonance in Jane’s struggle with cultural displacement. “Having studied abroad myself, I’ve felt that truly settling and being recognized by people from another culture is very difficult,” she says.</p>
<p>
	The puppet sequences became crucial for expressing Jane’s interior life. “The puppet scenes were extremely important for Jane. On one hand, they represented her passion; on the other, they were like another soul,” Gwei explains. 
	</p>
<p>
	At its core, “Dear Stranger” interrogates the nature of love itself — particularly the gap between feeling and expression, intention and understanding. For Mariko, the question was sparked by photographer Masafumi Sanai’s assessment that he had “no affection, but having love” when they worked together on “From Miyamoto to You.”</p>
<div><p>
	“For me, love exists in cinema,” Mariko says. “It’s not an easily understandable emotion — it accumulates quietly and surely, through countless human connections. It arises so naturally from passion that it feels almost embarrassing to put into words, yet it’s also fragile, as if it might disappear if left unspoken.”</p></div>

	Top executives, government leaders and international figures gathered during the <a target="_blank" href="https://variety.com/t/san-sebastian-film-festival-2/">San Sebastián Film Festival</a> this Sunday to reflect on Spain’s position within the European audiovisual industry and how to navigate a constantly evolving market. </p>
<p>
	The event, whose third edition was titled “Leading the Audiovisual of the Future,” is held by Spain’s Ministry for Digital Transformation and Public Service through the State Secretariat for Digitalization and <a target="_blank" href="https://variety.com/t/artificial-intelligence/">Artificial Intelligence</a>. The gathering aims to reflect on the audiovisual landscape in Europe and understand how Spanish professionals can thrive in an industry constantly facing major changes. This year, conversations focused largely on two key issues: artificial intelligence and Spain’s need for better regulation when it comes to protecting Spanish IP. 
	</p>
<p>
	In her closing remarks, Secretary of State for Digitalization and Artificial Intelligence María González Veracruz said hosting the conference for a third year felt like the “consolidation of a space.” “The work of everyone in this room is crucial to Spain being the most successful non-English audiovisual content producer in Europe,” she added. “Above all, we are going to continue to invest. This is a moment of consolidation. It is difficult to understand new tools, but what we are doing is very powerful.” 
</p>
<p>
	Ignasi Camós, director of Spain’s Institute of Cinematography and Audiovisual Arts (ICAA), said it is “essential to bet on enhancing creative, technical, and production talent at a national level and to have Spain as a bridge between Europe and Latin America.”
	</p>
<p>
	“We must get increasingly involved in international projects and co-productions,” he reiterated. “I believe this is the element that can give us a qualitative leap internationally, giving us prestige and important recognition. But we must be accompanied by European allies to compete with other markets. We are committed to opening up markets, including countries in the Asian continent.” </p>
<p>
	It’s important to note that the conference took place just an hour after the <a target="_blank" href="https://variety.com/t/european-producers-club/">European Producers Club</a> (EPC) shared a statement highlighting their concerns over the recently proposed AgoraEU Regulation (2028-2034). The European Union program is proposed by the European Commission to support and promote culture and media. According to the EPC, the “new MEDIA strand raises serious concerns for the future of independent European audiovisual creation.”</p>
<p>
	Key concerns include “weakened support for independent productions: the removal of the independence criterion; unclear budget and shifting priorities; open doors to non-European entities; and complex and opaque governance.” A common line amongst these concerns is a threat to cultural sovereignty and the increasing dominat position of U.S. streamers. Although the EPC statement was not addressed directly during the conference, these issues were widely discussed, especially regarding cultural homogeneity, the increasingly digital behavior of young audiences, and the proliferation of AI programs developed by foreign countries. </p>
<p>
	Below, you will find the main takeaways from this year’s Leading the Audiovisual of the Future conference:</p>
<p>
	<strong>AI: Create jobs, not replace them</strong></p>
<p>
	As it was to be expected, AI dominated much of the conversations at the conference. During a panel on new tendencies in the audiovisual sector, CEO at Professor Octopus AI Laboratory Carlos Fernández de Vigo, tried to appease some of the apprehensions by emphasizing artificial intelligence’s potential to create jobs in the industry. “Thanks to AI, we have projects that are viable now that were not viable just a few years ago,” he reiterated, stating that AI allows for the creation of new business models, “and therefore the creation of new jobs.” </p>
<p>
	Nathalie Martínez, president at the Spanish Federation of Animation and Visual Effects Producers Associations (Diboos), said that “without technology there is no cinema.” “We haven’t just discovered AI. We’ve been working with it for years, even if they were more primitive forms beforehand. We are using it as a tool. I want to emphasize it’s a tool and tools don’t replace people who work with those tools.”
	</p>
<p>
	<strong>No to cultural homogeneization</strong></p>
<p>
	When speaking about the great fears stemming from technologies such as AI, Martínez warned that the industry should be careful of how technology developed and championed by other countries can contribute to cultural homogeneization. “What we create should represent us,” she said. “We should have original stories. To me, that is our greatest obstacle.”</p>
<p>
	Lucía Recalde, Head of Creative Media Unit at the European Commission, gave a brief presentation of the recently finished Media Outlook Report for 2025. The executive echoed Martínez’s fears, especially when it comes to major U.S. streamers. The new report showed how young audiences are increasingly concentrated within digital platforms. “And we know those aren’t European,” she emphasized, before showing numbers highlighting that 70% of the Spanish market for streamers consists of non-European players such as Netflix, Disney and Amazon Prime Video. “The weight of American companies has grown in the last year while European companies have decreased,” she alerted.</p>
<p>
	<strong>Spanish IP belongs to Spain</strong></p>
<p>
	In what was perhaps the most applauded passage of the entire conference, the president of the Galician Audiovisual Cluster, Alfonso Blanco, reiterated that the most pressing issue within the Spanish industry today is creative rights retention. “We need a law that protects the creator and the product,” he said, reiterating that other major European powerhouses such as France and the U.K have long-established regulations providing security for creatives when it comes to original IP, while Spain still lacks that sense of security. “We need to regulate the TV market,” added Blanco. “We are one of the markets that faces the greatest difficulties in retaining IP rights. There is a fault in the system.” </p>
<p>
	Alfonso del Río, director at Culture CAP7, echoed this thought: “It doesn’t make sense. Imagine you do something great, others take it, and you never see it again?” Rights retention is a key point in financing conversations for del Río, who often works with international partners. The executive said that now, “we are starting to see financing instruments that allow us to go to international studios and say we have an idea, but I want it to be my own because I have the capacity to assume the risks.” Del Río reiterated, however, that having to play with such high stakes shouldn’t take precedence over legislation that protects Spanish IP. 
	</p>
<p>
	<strong>Talent is not enough: control distribution at home and internationally</strong></p>
<p>
	Filmin co-founder José Antonio de Luna said the feeling is that players “always focus all their strategies on the raw material, which is creation. But we forget that if we don’t get the content to an audience, it doesn’t matter how much talent we have.” </p>
<p>
	Recalde highlighted how research shows that “European cinema does not travel enough to other countries.” Currently, only 44% of European films travel internationally. Within Spain’s domestic exhibition market, U.S. dominance is also an issue, with U.S. films making up 20% of the offer but 60% of the box office, while European films make up 60% of the offer but only 31% of the box office. </p>
<p>
	<strong>What is the European Model?</strong></p>
<p>
	Speaking on the importance — and the difficulties — of co-producing with other European countries, de Luna said that Spain “lacks the thought of a fully European model while also lacking the tools of how to think it.”</p>
<p>
	Helena Suárez Jaqueti, partner at law firm ECIJA and founder of E-LAB, praised the co-production model as a way of exposing Spanish professionals to international expertise without requiring them to leave Spain, but pointed out that because different European Union countries have different legal guidelines for co-productions, it is a “pretty difficult process” to co-produce. “You have to take into account each of the legislations, and it’s difficult when you are a European platform that wants to reach several markets.” </p>
<p>
	Clara Ruipérez, director of legal content strategy at Movistar Plus+, emphasized that while film has seen a rise in co-productions in recent years, the model is still fairly difficult to realize within TV. “We’d love to be always open to [co-productions], but that is not the reality. [The model] is still missing a lot.”</p>

	Director Larry Yang and producer Victoria Hon are considering a sequel to <a target="_blank" href="https://variety.com/t/jackie-chan/">Jackie Chan</a>‘s “The Shadow’s Edge” as the action thriller makes its international festival debut at the <a target="_blank" href="https://variety.com/t/busan-international-film-festival/">Busan International Film Festival</a>‘s Open Cinema section.</p>
<p>
	The crime thriller, which has held the No. 1 position at the China box office for four consecutive weekends, represents a reimagining of the Hong Kong classic “Eye in the Sky” for contemporary audiences. Director Larry Yang, whose debut feature “Mountain Cry” served as the closing film of the 20th Busan festival, collaborates again with Chan following their 2023 success “Ride On.”
	</p>
<p>
	“The challenge didn’t come from shaping the story into today’s tech-driven world, but from fitting into today’s audiences’ cinematic tastes,” Yang tells <em>Variety</em>. “I wouldn’t mind tell the same story again if the audiences today could appreciate it, but I guess that would not be the case. Finding the right tone – a combination of right characters, rhythm and emotional flow – for today’s audiences is more important than finding the right story settings.”
</p>
<p>
	The film features 85-90% new material while drawing inspiration from the original story. “My respect for the original come from my willingness to buy the remake right even if it’s just 1%, because that 1% is the idea of a film,” Yang explains. “A great idea always comes before a story. There can be countless ways to tell that idea, but a great idea is a great idea.”</p>
<p>
	Yang’s approach to the remake prioritized creative freedom over strict adherence to the source material. “My opinion of a remake doesn’t necessarily have to be an exact scene-by-scene reboot of the same story, but instead a new breed of the same idea,” he says. “Therefore, I didn’t worry too much about balance. I primarily focused on what would be good for my story and my tone surrounding this great idea.”
	</p>
<p>
	In “The Shadow’s Edge,” Chan plays a veteran surveillance expert pulled out of retirement to investigate a high-stakes heist in Macau. Tony Leung Ka-fai reprises his villain role from the original “Eye in the Sky,” though Yang reimagined the character for the contemporary setting.</p>
<p>
	Yang approached Leung’s character as a “simple speculation of ‘what if,’ like in a parallel universe. What if that guy didn’t die? What if he survived, was saved by a bunch of kids, raised them, trained them, and teamed up with them two decades later? What if, by spending years with these boys, this ruthless guy began to grow a bit of something called love in him? And, what if, due to some misunderstanding or miscommunication, the boy betrayed his love?”</p>
<p>
	The film blends surveillance technology with character-driven action sequences. “The idea of a covert surveillance team on foot searching for a ghost came from the original story,” Yang notes. “Technology serves as obstacles and opportunities on both sides, giving new twists to the story. I made sure this part never exceeded the flow of intensive energy while telling the story. It’s still a ‘human story,’ never tech-driven, but wit-driven.”</p>
<p>
	Yang emphasizes that action sequences serve narrative purposes beyond spectacle. “Action served as a continuation of a dialogue, a continuation of a quiet and covert surveillance mission, and a continuation of the evil-fighting barrier which technology alone couldn’t reach,” he explains. “We built sequences that ‘speak’ through character by always holding on to the human factors.”</p>
<p>
	Regarding Chan’s performance capabilities, Yang remains confident: “Jackie can still fight, and this movie is far from reaching his limit.”</p>
<p>
	Producer Victoria Hon emphasizes the film’s thematic exploration of generational dynamics. “We bought the remake rights for ‘Eye in the Sky’ a few years ago and have been developing a story for years,” Hon says. “How to make the story work with today’s audiences has always been an interesting discussion internally. At the same time, we see how AI plays a more and more significant role in modern society. So we wanted to incorporate this element into the story. The idea of old and new became the theme we wanted to discuss and explore.”</p>
<p>
	The challenging production required convincing investors that action films could succeed in the current Chinese market. “I think the biggest challenge was to make this film and this genre itself,” Hon explains. “In the recent China film market, action films were not doing very well at the box office. To make investors believe in this genre, we worked hard on the script and building the characters.”
	</p>
<p>
	Hon credits the strong screenplay with attracting top talent. “I believe the script is always the first milestone of a project – being able to talk to masters like Jackie and Tony and convince them there’s something different and unique in their characters,” she says. The production also featured young actors with extensive wushu training and “young and talented crew members who are very creative and energetic.”</p>
<p>
	Balancing industry veterans with emerging talent became a key production strategy. “This is just like the theme of our film,” Hon notes. “I think it is also one of the key to success – that we respectfully learned from the masters and added young energy and creatives into the film.”</p>
<p>
	Hon describes the collaborative process with Chan: “In all the action scenes, Larry and action director Su Hang had many creative ideas they wanted to try. They shot action demos and showed them to Jackie. With Jackie’s experience, he gave advice on parts that could escalate the tension, or parts that could be dangerous and needed preparations. Other than that, he gave us all his trust, which meant a lot and allowed us to try new things.”</p>
<p>
	The complex action sequences required extensive preparation and significant budget allocation. “Action scenes are very costly and time consuming,” Hon explains. “Even so, we shot the actions scenes with one single crew to keep the action and actor performance consistent. Pre-production time was about 5 months and we shot 84 days. Most of the action scenes were storyboarded, and action demos were filmed during pre-production.”</p>
<p>
	Macau’s distinctive cultural backdrop proved essential to the film’s atmosphere. “Macau is a city with mixed cultural elements. It has very fancy luxurious hotels, and also very old town almost next to each other,” Hon notes. “We loved that atmosphere, and we felt the story and character could blend into the city well.”</p>
<p>
	The production team spent eight months scouting locations, with some sequences emerging organically from the geography. “The script’s locations were based on routes we walked ourselves and felt reasonable to include,” Hon explains. “For example, when the robbers flew from the Macau Tower, they needed to find the nearest platform to land. We stood at the edge of the tower and saw the platform of Wynn Macau. That’s how we first approached the hotel and asked for their support.”
	</p>
<p>
	With Golden Network Asia handling international sales, Hon expresses optimism about overseas performance. “This time most of the sales were made in Cannes earlier this year, and many buyers were confident to promote the film after seeing our demos and reels,” she says. “I look forward to the theatrical release in all the regions and hope for strong box office results.”</p>
<p>
	Looking toward future projects, Yang indicates sequel discussions are underway while he develops additional action projects. “We’re considering the idea of a sequel, but right now we’re unsure what direction it will take,” Yang says. “I don’t want to repeat myself so I will very likely find a new approach. We’ll see how that goes.”</p>
<p>
	The director remains committed to genre exploration. “I love telling a good story, and I will continue searching for great movie ideas and compelling stories to tell, no matter the genre,” Yang explains. “I’m interested to try different genres, including sci-fi or historical stories in the future.”</p>
<p>
	Hon sees continued opportunities for Asian cinema in global markets. “Commercial genres like action and thrillers are probably the most popular ones for reaching global audiences,” she says. “We will keep working in action, and I also hope to do more co-production that can target both local and international audiences.”</p>

                <div><p>
	<a target="_blank" href="https://variety.com/t/daniel-burman/">Daniel Burman</a>, icon of the New Argentine Cinema and now one of Argentina’s foremost feature/TV series writer-directors and showrunners, is shooting a new series “So Far So Good” (“El Resto Bien”). Created by Burman, it re-teams him with <a target="_blank" href="https://variety.com/t/daniel-hendler/">Daniel Hendler</a> – star of 2004’s “Lost Embrace,” which won Burman a Berlin Jury Grand Prix and Hendler a Silver Bear for actor.</p>
<p>
	Hendler and Burman will co-direct together all the series’ eight half-hour episodes. Far So Good” is produced by Uruguay H.Q.-ed <a target="_blank" href="https://variety.com/t/cimarron-2/">Cimarrón</a> (“Barrabrava,” <a target="_blank" href="https://variety.com/2023/film/global/alfredo-castro-paula-hernandez-ravaging-wind-1235705979/">“A Ravaging Wind”</a>) and Argentina’s <a target="_blank" href="https://variety.com/t/oficina-burman/">Oficina Burman</a> (“Victoria Small,”<a target="_blank" href="https://variety.com/2022/tv/festivals/lone-scherfig-daniel-burman-the-shift-yosi-1235182065/"> “Yosi, the Regretful Spy”</a>), whose latest series, “Maledictions” bowed Sept. 12 on Netflix, hitting its Global non-English Top 10 TV Shows. Both are <a target="_blank" href="https://variety.com/t/the-mediapro-studio/">The Mediapro Studio</a> companies. 
	</p>
<p>
	Oficina Burman and Cimarrón are producing “So Far So Good” for <a target="_blank" href="https://variety.com/t/flow/">Flow</a>, the Argentine cable TV, internet and SVOD operator. Flow has acquired distribution rights for Latin America; The Mediapro Studio owns rights to the rest of the world. 
</p>
<p>
	Many of Burman’s films are autobiographical, exploring nuanced family relations and questions of identity with a hallmark warm irony, seeking as well an emotional punch.<br />Currently half way through its shoot in Uruguay and Paraguay, “So Far So Good” has all this in arguably the most autobiographical of Burman’s works. </p>
<p>
	His alter ego Ariel (<a target="_blank" href="https://variety.com/t/benjamin-vicuna/">Benjamin Vicuña</a>, “Locked Up”), a successful cartoonist is now in seeming danger of emotional burnout as he turns 50, trapped in a world – Burman’s first irony – that he has created himself. Caught in the vortex of a frenzied social life, given the pressing needs of his five children and constant attention required by his parents, already on the verge of physical and emotional collapse, he is told by his doctor that he has a hernia and shouldn’t lift anything weighing more than three kilos.
	</p>
<p>
	“This limitation sparks a journey which is comic and around where Ariel has to discover what really worries us in life. Will he be able to recuperate his freedom or be crushed by his own reality?” the synopsis ends by asking.</p>
<p>
	Ariel’s crisis is of his own making, in more ways than one, Burman told <em>Variety</em>, calling “So Far So Good” a “human dramedy” about “men’s mid-life crises with themselves, that moment of life when you ask: ‘When will there be time for me?’”</p>
<p>
	He added: “Mid-life men issues haven’t addressed so much in recent years what happens to men with regard to themselves. Or they’re focused in relation to women or partners. What’s been left somewhat aside is men’s crises with themselves.”</p>
<p>
	Series leads are Vicuña, Violeta Urtizberea (“Las estrellas”), Rita Cortese (‘Wild Tales’) and Martín Seefeld (“Pretenders”). Guest artists take in Andrea Frigerio (“The Distinguished Citizen”), Alejandro Awada (“Yosi, the Repentant Spy”) and Marina Bellati (“Envious”). The series is written by Burman and frequent recent collaborators Ariel Gurevich (‘Transmitzvah’) and Andrés Gelós and Pablo Gelós, (“Maledictions”) as well as Eloy Burman.</p>
<p>
	<em>Variety </em>chatted to Burman briefly about his new series:</p>
<p>
	<strong>All films and TV series are, to a certain extent autobiographical. “So Far So Good” seems to be perhaps your most obviously autobiographical work to date….</strong><br />This is conscious. Sometimes you tell stories you need to tell, and at others stories that you need to be told. I was looking for a story to establish a dialog with the moment of life I’m going through, middle-age – I’m 52 – where you’re father to your children and father to your parents. Without a sense of victimization. I created a family, which is marvellous. But the time you have for yourself is the small remainder after being a father and son, and it becomes smaller and smaller.</p>
<p>
	<strong>In the series, Ariel also suffers from a hernia.…</strong><br />Yes, your body begins to fail and you have a sense you just have some years to do everything you haven’t done. Your body begins to abandon you, but remaining are your responsibilities, a lot of which are self-imposed. Many times we use them to escape from real responsibility, which is taking responsibility for what we are.
	</p>
<p>
	<strong>Isn’t this a larger masculine trait?</strong><br />Yes: It’s a specific facet of men: How we’re fascinated in conquering empires, going out to conquer the world, to escape from our own world, our small microcosmos. How we go to our Waterloos to escape confronting our own families. Again, that will be treated without any sense of accusation. I’m not so much deconstructing masculinity as constructing it, because it still hasn’t been constructed.</p>
<p>
	<strong>In “So Far So Good” you’re working with people you’ve worked with before over multiple films. Is that just a coincidence?</strong><br />It’s not by chance. rather like a party with friends. On the shoot, you can look around and see so many people you want to give a hug to or have a coffee with them. Daniel Hendler is one case. We began working together over 20 years ago with “The Lost Embrace.” I was moved by his becoming a director. He’s slightly younger but also addresses the same middle-age issues. I’ve worked with many of the screenwriters on “Yosi, the Regretful Spy” and “Maledictions.” It’s a very feel-good series, and made to connect, made not only with a male gaze but inviting other viewpoints, those of how our children and parents look at us.</p>
<p>
	<strong>This is your first collaboration with Flow?</strong><br />Yes, I’m enjoying working with them immensely. They’ve also given me absolute creative freedom. They are the perfect partner for this project. I’ve now worked with Cimarrón on several titles. The Mediapro Studio is rather like a household where you take each project to your cousin, uncle or brother. We really work like a family. Cimarrón is a sister company. I live in Buenos Aires but each time I shoot, I now move to Montevideo. It’s like a second home.</p>
