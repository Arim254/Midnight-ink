        <p>The <a target="_blank" href="https://www.cbssports.com/wnba/teams/GS/golden-state-valkyries/">Golden State Valkyries</a>' historic debut season reached new heights on Thursday when they clinched a playoff spot with an 84-80 win over the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.cbssports.com/wnba/teams/DAL/dallas-wings/">Dallas Wings</a>. The Valkyries are the first expansion team in WNBA history to make the playoffs in their inaugural season.Â </p><p>When the Wings jumped out to a 10-0 lead in the opening minutes, it looked like it might not be the Valkyries' night. But as they've done all season long, the Valkyries found a way to overcome adversity. They battled back in the second half and went ahead for good on a <a target="_blank" href="https://www.cbssports.com/wnba/players/29362928/carla-leite/">Carla Leite</a> bucket with 2:26 remaining. When the final buzzer sounded, streamers fell from the rafters and the team celebrated at midcourt.Â </p>
<p>The Valkyries, the first expansion team to join the league since the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.cbssports.com/wnba/teams/ATL/atlanta-dream/">Atlanta Dream</a> in 2008, faced plenty of questions after their expansion draft back in December, in which they favored hard-working veterans over younger players with potential. As it turned out, the front office led by Ohemaa Nyanin and coaching staff led by Natalie Nakase knew exactly what they were doing.Â </p><p>A tough schedule over the first few weeks led to a 2-5 start, but since then the Valkyries have been one of the league's best teams despite a parade of injuries. <a target="_blank" href="https://www.cbssports.com/wnba/players/28850640/veronica-burton/">Veronica Burton</a> is the only player on the roster who has played in every game thus far, and 19 different players have appeared in a game. Most notably, leading scorer <a target="_blank" href="https://www.cbssports.com/wnba/players/26678082/kayla-thornton/">Kayla Thornton</a> went down with a season-ending knee injury shortly after becoming the first All-Star in franchise history.Â </p>

They don't have a healthy player averaging more than 11.9 points per game this season, and they have the worst offensive rating (102.3, ninth in the league) of any team currently in playoff position.Â </p><p>The Valkyries have managed to exceed expectations thanks to an elite defense. They lead the league in field goal defense, and are holding opponents to just 40.4% from the field, which would be the be lowest opponent field goal percentage since the 2020 Seattle Storm (40.1%). Overall, the Valkyries rank third in defensive rating (99.7).Â </p><a href="https://www.cbssports.com/wnba/news/how-the-valkyries-created-an-unmatched-wnba-home-court-advantage-and-why-expectations-are-high-in-ballhalla/" target="_blank">

<p>Off the court, the Valkyries have also excelled. In March, the they became the first team in WNBA history to sell 10,000 season tickets. All 20 of their home games have been sold out, and their average attendance of 18,064 not only leads the league, but is also on pace to be an all-time record. At home in Ballhalla, the team's nickname for the Chase Center, the Valkyries are 13-7 with a plus-8.8 net rating.Â </p>
<p>The Valkyries have set a high bar for the wave of expansion teams set to follow them. The Portland Fire and Toronto Tempo will join next season, followed by yet unnamed franchises in Cleveland (2028), Detroit (2029) and Philadelphia (2030), which will bring the league to 18 teams.</p>

        <p>For the second straight year, the NFL schedule has a Week 1 Friday night contest in Brazil. The three-time defending AFC champion Kansas City Chiefs are the road team while their AFC West division rivals, the Los Angeles Chargers, are at "home" in Brazil. The Chiefs have won each of the last seven meetings dating back to 2021, though six of the seven have been via one possession. The featured matchup is between the quarterbacks: Justin Herbert leads an improved Los Angeles team, while Patrick Mahomes continues his ascent among the greatest of all-time for Kansas City. The latestÂ <a target="_blank" href="https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/odds/">NFL odds</a>Â list Herbert's over/under for total passing attempts at 33.5, while Mahomes' over/under for his longest completion is 35.5 yards.Â </p><p>Kickoff for Chiefs vs. Chargers on Friday Night Football is set for 8 p.m. ET at Neo Quimica Arena in SÃ£o Paulo, Brazil. With NFL props available for almost every player in every game atÂ <a href="https://www.cbssports.com/betting/news/best-betting-apps/" target="_blank">sportsbooks</a>, SportsLine's proven computer model can help you find value to add to your Chargers vs. Chiefs picks.

The model went 31-15 on top-rated picks in 2024.

Now, the model has revealed its top Chiefs vs. Chargers NFL player prop picks:Â </p><p><strong>Best Friday Night Football player prop picks for Week 1:<br /></strong></p><ul><li>Patrick Mahomes, Chiefs, Over 245.5 passing yards (-125)</li><li>Ladd McConkey, Chargers, Over 71.5 receiving yards (-114)</li><li>Isiah Pacheco, Chiefs, Under 50.5 rushing yards (-114)</li></ul><p>Parlay these picks for +535 odds (risk $100 to win $534) atÂ <a href="https://martech.cbssports.com/bt/redirect/prod?b=draftkings&amp;c=sport" target="_blank">DraftKings</a>Â (odds subject to change)</p><h2>Patrick Mahomes, Chiefs, Over 245.5 passing yards (-111)</h2><p>The model is projecting Mahomes to top 283 yards passing, which gives us approximately 40 yards in wiggle room vs. his over/under. Also consider that the Chiefs' star quarterback has topped this total in six of his last eight games against the Chargers. Considering that Kansas City may struggle to run against Los Angeles' defensive line, it's conceivable to think that Mahomes may be asked to carry a heavier load in the passing game in Week 1.Â </p><h2>Ladd McConkey, Chargers, Over 71.5 receiving yards (-114)</h2><p>In his rookie season, McConkey topped 71 yards in six of his last seven games, including an impressive 9-197-1 performance in the Chargers loss to Houston in the AFC Wild Card playoff game. In his one appearance against the Chiefs in 2024, the 6'0" receiver posted a 5-67-1 line but should see double-digit targets on Friday night. The model projects him at 92.9 yards, which is more than 20 yards above the oddsmakers' yardage line.</p><h2>Isiah Pacheco, Chiefs, Under 50.5 rushing yards (-114)</h2><p>The Chiefs were held below four yards per carry in their two games against Los Angeles last season. The model is projecting Kansas City's No. 1 running back to rush for 38.6 yards, well below his sportsbook total. With Kareem Hunt as the primary pass catching back, any second half deficit could keep Pacheco on the bench for long stretches and limit his chance to top 50 yards rushing.</p><h2>Want more Week 1 NFL picks?</h2><p><strong>You've seen the model's NFL picks for Chiefs vs. Chargers player props for Week 1.

The race for the sport's highest individual honor could not be more wide open with so much season left to be played, but every game counts, and each data point has long-term implications in the process of determining who hoists the trophy in December.</p><p>The upcoming Week 2 slate is significantly lighter on marquee matchups, but that does not mean the next batch of games is unimportant in defining the road to glory. The strongest Heisman contenders go above and beyond regardless of their opponent, and quite a few of this year's hopefuls have an opportunity this week to pad their stats against inferior foes.</p><a href="https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/news/college-football-qb-power-rankings-arch-manning-falls-from-top-50-tcus-josh-hoover-ascends-to-no-1-spot/" target="_blank">

The second-year LSU starter and reigning SEC completions leader went 28-for-38 for 230 yards and a touchdown against Clemson and capped off his night with what proved to be the decisive score: an 8-yard touchdown pass to <a target="_blank" href="https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/players/29390367/treydez-green/">Trey'Dez Green</a>.</p><p>Nussmeier entered the Tigers vs. Tigers clash tied with Clemson's Cade Klubnik on the odds board and gained meaningful separation from him with a noticeably better performance. Stacking up ranked wins like that one would not only keep the potential first-round pick in front of the Heisman pack, but it would also finally cement LSU as a real national championship contender in Year 4 of the Brian Kelly era.</p><p>The early stages of the season allow for big leaps up the odds board, and it was a good week to be a victorious quarterback. Utah dazzled in a rout of <a target="_blank" href="https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/teams/UCLA/ucla-bruins/">UCLA</a>, and dual-threat transfer Devon Dampier looked the part of a quarterback who could lead his team to a Big 12 title. He misfired just four times on 25 pass attempts, ran for 87 yards and found the end zone three times -- twice through the air and once on the ground. The market loved what it saw. Dampier's Heisman odds improved twofold from +5000 to +2500 in the matter of just one game.</p>
<p>Dampier was the most dramatic riser, but a bevy of other quarterbacks made leaps worthy of recognition, too. Georgia's Gunner Stockton passed for two touchdowns and ran for two more to become the second-steepest climber behind Dampier. John Mateer, Carson Beck and Jackson Arnold all lived up to their transfer hype at their respective schools. LaNorris Sellers looked like a certified playmaker for South Carolina. And the Dante Moore era is off and running at Oregon in style.</p><h2>Stock down: Defensive battle hurts Manning, Ohio State</h2><p>The Manning hype dwindled quickly. He and the Texas offense are far, far away from being a lost cause, though. One bad game against what may very well be the best defense in <a target="_blank" href="https://cbssports.com/college-football/">college football</a> <a target="_blank" href="https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/news/resetting-arch-mannings-expectations-at-texas-in-2025-after-steve-sarkisian-says-hype-was-out-of-control/">should not be cause for massive concern</a>, particularly because it came on the road in Manning's first outing as a full-time starter. His poor timing and head-scratching overthrows and underthrows do not have to define his season.</p><p>On the other side of that No. 1 vs. No. 3 showdown, it was not as though Ohio State's individual standouts got off to a hot start, either. Julian Sayin looked very much like a redshirt freshman making his first career start against an equally formidable defense, and for the second time in as many years, Jeremiah Smith was only a modest factor against the Longhorns. Neither bolstered their Heisman candidacy despite what was a gargantuan team result.</p>
<p>Heisman voters will want to see more from Cade Klubnik the rest of the year, too. While he seemed down the stretch of the 2024 season to assuage the concerns surrounding his performance against top competition, <a target="_blank" href="https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/news/clemsons-dabo-swinney-calls-out-cade-klubnik-says-biggest-problem-vs-lsu-was-best-player-didnt-play-well/">he faltered in his first test of 2025</a>. The 50% completion rate and interception he logged against LSU were reminiscent of his struggles against Georgia a year ago and <a target="_blank" href="https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/teams/ND/notre-dame-fighting-irish/">Notre Dame</a> the season prior.</p><figure><p><img alt="Texas v Ohio State" src="https://sportshub.cbsistatic.com/i/r/2025/09/03/9d1dd8df-62de-4707-b613-ddfea5d58f60/resize/670x377/3d798bad3e7496115e9579737954ddfb/arch.jpg" /></p><figcaption><span>Texas quarterback Arch Manning is no longer the Heisman favorite after last week's loss to Caleb Downs and Ohio State. </span><span>

                                                            </span></figcaption></figure><h2>Week 2 performances to watch</h2><p>Last week was a treat with its flock of top-25 matchups. Week 2 is, um, a bit lighter on big-time showdowns. No. 15 <a target="_blank" href="https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/teams/MICH/michigan-wolverines/">Michigan</a> and No. 18 Oklahoma will take center stage in a game that carries significant Heisman implications, though.</p><h3>John Mateer vs. Michigan</h3><p>Okay, John Mateer, you ripped an FCS defense to shreds. Now show us what you have against almighty Michigan. Mateer's Oklahoma debut was historic. He set the school record for most passing yards in a debut with 392 against <a target="_blank" href="https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/teams/ILST/illinois-state-redbirds/">Illinois State</a> to go with three touchdowns, 24 rushing yards and another score on the ground. But the looming Wolverines are about as different of a beast as there is in college football. This is exactly the kind of game that Brent Venables brought Mateer in from <a target="_blank" href="https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/teams/WASHST/washington-state-cougars/">Washington State</a> for, and it is precisely the type of all-eyes-on-me opportunity he needs to make a statement in front of Heisman voters.</p>
<h3>Dante Moore vs. <a target="_blank" href="https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/teams/OKLAST/oklahoma-state-cowboys/">Oklahoma State</a></h3><p>Dante Moore's last start against a Power Four opponent came in Nov. 2023, and he threw two interceptions in that game. This week will show how much growth he made in his developmental year at Oregon. Another good outing to open his starting stint with the Ducks would be a solid first step in proving he is a different player from the one that began his career at UCLA as an underwhelming five-star freshman. Oklahoma State's is a nice, soft defense to help him ease into Power Four action.</p><h3>Sam Leavitt vs. <a target="_blank" href="https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/teams/MISSST/mississippi-state-bulldogs/">Mississippi State</a></h3><p>Arizona State heads to SEC country for the second leg of a home-and-home with Mississippi State -- the one opponent that truly had Sam Leavitt's number in 2024. The Bulldogs were the only team to hold the breakout star to fewer than 150 yards and one of just three to keep him out of the end zone through the air. Now, he did set a career high with two rushing scores in the win, but 69 passing yards against Mississippi State? <em>That</em> Mississippi State? The trendy Heisman dark horse needs a better effort in the rematch.</p>

        <p>Entering this summer, Amanda Anisimova had never been to a slam final. Now, she's heading to her second in three months. The 24-year-old American is into the US Open women's singles final with a 6-7(4), 7-6(3), 6-3 win over No. 23 Naomi Osaka.</p><p>Anisimova will face No. 1 seed Aryna Sabalenka in Saturday's final.</p><p>"This has been a dream of mine, like, forever is to be in the US Open final," Anisimova told ESPN on her on-court interview. "Obviously the hope is to be the champion, but I'm in the final now, and I'm gonna try to get ready, but I'm just excited. It's really special."</p><p>Osaka broke Anisimova in the first game of the match. After Anisimova took a 30-0 lead, she committed four straight unforced errors, including a double fault.</p><p>Down 0-40 on her second service game and in danger of letting things get out of control early, Anisimova fought off three break points to remain just one break down, and she promptly broke Osaka back to get on serve. Osaka would break right back, though, as both players had issues with their serve.</p>
<p>Serving for the set up 5-4, Osaka fell down 0-40, and Anisimova converted her second break point opportunity of the game, jumping all over an Osaka second serve.</p><p>The momentum quickly swung the other way in the tiebreaker, though: down 2-1, Anisimova double faulted and then put a relatively straightforward forehand into the net. That was more than enough room for Osaka to win the tiebreaker comfortably, 7-4.</p><p>The second set began with a pair of breaks and then a pair of holds before Anisimova got up a break when Osaka sent a shot long. The No. 23 seed slammed a tennis ball onto the court in frustration.</p>
<p>Osaka's frustration continued to simmer -- she slammed her racket into the ground a couple of times -- during the next game, but she ended up breaking back anyway. Again, it wasn't the most beautiful tennis Arthur Ashe Stadium has ever seen.</p><p>The seesaw match tilted back in Anisimova's favor in the ninth game of the second set. Down 40-0, she ripped off six straight points, the last one featuring some marvelous defense, to go up a break, 5-4.</p><p>This time, though, it was Anisimova's turn to fail to serve out the set, another double fault allowing Osaka to get back on serve.</p>
<p>In the second-set tiebreak, Anisimova was the one taking control with a quick 4-0 lead. She closed out the set on an Osaka unforced error.</p><p>Osaka headed back to the locker room between the second and third set and appeared to be dealing with a foot issue -- a trainer came out early in the third set -- as Anisimova went up an early break.</p><p>This time, Anisimova would not give her hard-earned break back. Serving for the match, Anisimova unleashed big serves and the crisp, powerful ground strokes that have fueled her rise. After failing to convert two match points -- and even facing two break points herself -- Anisimova unleashed a pair of strong forehand winners to close things out.</p>
<p>Anisimova will be looking to improve on her first performance in a slam final; at the Wimbledon final in July, she lost 6-0, 6-0 to Iga Swiatek. Anisimova, who beat Swiatek in the US Open quarters Wednesday, is the first woman to reach a slam final after losing the previous slam's final 6-0, 6-0.</p><p>She needed all that resilience, and then some, against Osaka, who has been plenty resilient herself throughout this tournament, her deepest slam run since winning the 2021 Australian Open.</p><p>"Naomi is playing amazing tennis," Anisimova said. "She's back where she belongs. I just told her I'm so proud of her after having a baby and playing at this level. It's insane."</p>
<p>Anisimova is 6-3 against Sabalenka, including a three-set win over her at Wimbledon.</p>

<p>This is a long first trip for the Pete Carroll-led Raiders. The Patriots will have Mike Vrabel making his debut as coach as well.

        <p>For the second straight year, the NFL schedule has a Week 1 Friday night contest in Brazil. The three-time defending AFC champion Kansas City Chiefs are the road team while their AFC West division rivals, the Los Angeles Chargers, are at "home" in Brazil. The Chiefs have won each of the last seven meetings dating back to 2021, though six of the seven have been via one possession. The featured matchup is between the quarterbacks: Justin Herbert leads an improved Los Angeles team, while Patrick Mahomes continues his ascent among the greatest of all-time for Kansas City. The latestÂ <a target="_blank" href="https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/odds/">NFL odds</a>Â list Herbert's over/under for total passing attempts at 33.5, while Mahomes' over/under for his longest completion is 35.5 yards.Â </p><p>Kickoff for Chiefs vs. Chargers on Friday Night Football is set for 8 p.m. ET at Neo Quimica Arena in SÃ£o Paulo, Brazil.

Considering that Kansas City may struggle to run against Los Angeles' defensive line, it's conceivable to think that Mahomes may be asked to carry a heavier load in the passing game in Week 1.Â </p><h2>Ladd McConkey, Chargers, Over 71.5 receiving yards (-114)</h2><p>In his rookie season, McConkey topped 71 yards in six of his last seven games, including an impressive 9-197-1 performance in the Chargers loss to Houston in the AFC Wild Card playoff game. In his one appearance against the Chiefs in 2024, the 6'0" receiver posted a 5-67-1 line but should see double-digit targets on Friday night. The model projects him at 92.9 yards, which is more than 20 yards above the oddsmakers' yardage line.</p><h2>Isiah Pacheco, Chiefs, Under 50.5 rushing yards (-114)</h2><p>The Chiefs were held below four yards per carry in their two games against Los Angeles last season. The model is projecting Kansas City's No. 1 running back to rush for 38.6 yards, well below his sportsbook total. With Kareem Hunt as the primary pass catching back, any second half deficit could keep Pacheco on the bench for long stretches and limit his chance to top 50 yards rushing.</p><h2>Want more Week 1 NFL picks?</h2><p><strong>You've seen the model's NFL picks for Chiefs vs. Chargers player props for Week 1.

The preseason Heisman Trophy favorite <a target="_blank" href="https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/news/arch-mannings-heisman-trophy-odds-plummet-after-dreadful-first-start-against-ohio-state-no-longer-favorite/">suddenly has heaps of ground to make up</a> after he ceded frontrunner status to <a target="_blank" href="https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/teams/LSU/lsu-tigers/">LSU's</a> <a target="_blank" href="https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/players/26701706/garrett-nussmeier/">Garrett Nussmeier</a>.</p><p>Those stars from the top-10 matchups were far from the only Heisman hopefuls to make statements, for better or worse, in <a target="_blank" href="https://cbssports.com/college-football/">college football's</a> loaded opening week. The race for the sport's highest individual honor could not be more wide open with so much season left to be played, but every game counts, and each data point has long-term implications in the process of determining who hoists the trophy in December.</p><p>The upcoming Week 2 slate is significantly lighter on marquee matchups, but that does not mean the next batch of games is unimportant in defining the road to glory. The strongest Heisman contenders go above and beyond regardless of their opponent, and quite a few of this year's hopefuls have an opportunity this week to pad their stats against inferior foes.</p><a href="https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/news/college-football-qb-power-rankings-arch-manning-falls-from-top-50-tcus-josh-hoover-ascends-to-no-1-spot/" target="_blank">

The second-year LSU starter and reigning SEC completions leader went 28-for-38 for 230 yards and a touchdown against Clemson and capped off his night with what proved to be the decisive score: an 8-yard touchdown pass to <a target="_blank" href="https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/players/29390367/treydez-green/">Trey'Dez Green</a>.</p><p>Nussmeier entered the Tigers vs. Tigers clash tied with Clemson's Cade Klubnik on the odds board and gained meaningful separation from him with a noticeably better performance. Stacking up ranked wins like that one would not only keep the potential first-round pick in front of the Heisman pack, but it would also finally cement LSU as a real national championship contender in Year 4 of the Brian Kelly era.</p><p>The early stages of the season allow for big leaps up the odds board, and it was a good week to be a victorious quarterback. Utah dazzled in a rout of <a target="_blank" href="https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/teams/UCLA/ucla-bruins/">UCLA</a>, and dual-threat transfer Devon Dampier looked the part of a quarterback who could lead his team to a Big 12 title. He misfired just four times on 25 pass attempts, ran for 87 yards and found the end zone three times -- twice through the air and once on the ground. The market loved what it saw. Dampier's Heisman odds improved twofold from +5000 to +2500 in the matter of just one game.</p>
<p>Dampier was the most dramatic riser, but a bevy of other quarterbacks made leaps worthy of recognition, too. Georgia's Gunner Stockton passed for two touchdowns and ran for two more to become the second-steepest climber behind Dampier. John Mateer, Carson Beck and Jackson Arnold all lived up to their transfer hype at their respective schools. LaNorris Sellers looked like a certified playmaker for South Carolina. And the Dante Moore era is off and running at Oregon in style.</p><h2>Stock down: Defensive battle hurts Manning, Ohio State</h2><p>The Manning hype dwindled quickly. He and the Texas offense are far, far away from being a lost cause, though. One bad game against what may very well be the best defense in <a target="_blank" href="https://cbssports.com/college-football/">college football</a> <a target="_blank" href="https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/news/resetting-arch-mannings-expectations-at-texas-in-2025-after-steve-sarkisian-says-hype-was-out-of-control/">should not be cause for massive concern</a>, particularly because it came on the road in Manning's first outing as a full-time starter. His poor timing and head-scratching overthrows and underthrows do not have to define his season.</p><p>On the other side of that No. 1 vs. No. 3 showdown, it was not as though Ohio State's individual standouts got off to a hot start, either. Julian Sayin looked very much like a redshirt freshman making his first career start against an equally formidable defense, and for the second time in as many years, Jeremiah Smith was only a modest factor against the Longhorns. Neither bolstered their Heisman candidacy despite what was a gargantuan team result.</p>
<p>Heisman voters will want to see more from Cade Klubnik the rest of the year, too. While he seemed down the stretch of the 2024 season to assuage the concerns surrounding his performance against top competition, <a target="_blank" href="https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/news/clemsons-dabo-swinney-calls-out-cade-klubnik-says-biggest-problem-vs-lsu-was-best-player-didnt-play-well/">he faltered in his first test of 2025</a>. The 50% completion rate and interception he logged against LSU were reminiscent of his struggles against Georgia a year ago and <a target="_blank" href="https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/teams/ND/notre-dame-fighting-irish/">Notre Dame</a> the season prior.</p><figure><p><img alt="Texas v Ohio State" src="https://sportshub.cbsistatic.com/i/r/2025/09/03/9d1dd8df-62de-4707-b613-ddfea5d58f60/resize/670x377/3d798bad3e7496115e9579737954ddfb/arch.jpg" /></p><figcaption><span>Texas quarterback Arch Manning is no longer the Heisman favorite after last week's loss to Caleb Downs and Ohio State. </span><span>

Week 2 is, um, a bit lighter on big-time showdowns. No. 15 <a target="_blank" href="https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/teams/MICH/michigan-wolverines/">Michigan</a> and No. 18 Oklahoma will take center stage in a game that carries significant Heisman implications, though.</p><h3>John Mateer vs. Michigan</h3><p>Okay, John Mateer, you ripped an FCS defense to shreds. Now show us what you have against almighty Michigan. Mateer's Oklahoma debut was historic. He set the school record for most passing yards in a debut with 392 against <a target="_blank" href="https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/teams/ILST/illinois-state-redbirds/">Illinois State</a> to go with three touchdowns, 24 rushing yards and another score on the ground. But the looming Wolverines are about as different of a beast as there is in college football. This is exactly the kind of game that Brent Venables brought Mateer in from <a target="_blank" href="https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/teams/WASHST/washington-state-cougars/">Washington State</a> for, and it is precisely the type of all-eyes-on-me opportunity he needs to make a statement in front of Heisman voters.</p>
<h3>Dante Moore vs. <a target="_blank" href="https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/teams/OKLAST/oklahoma-state-cowboys/">Oklahoma State</a></h3><p>Dante Moore's last start against a Power Four opponent came in Nov. 2023, and he threw two interceptions in that game. This week will show how much growth he made in his developmental year at Oregon. Another good outing to open his starting stint with the Ducks would be a solid first step in proving he is a different player from the one that began his career at UCLA as an underwhelming five-star freshman. Oklahoma State's is a nice, soft defense to help him ease into Power Four action.</p><h3>Sam Leavitt vs. <a target="_blank" href="https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/teams/MISSST/mississippi-state-bulldogs/">Mississippi State</a></h3><p>Arizona State heads to SEC country for the second leg of a home-and-home with Mississippi State -- the one opponent that truly had Sam Leavitt's number in 2024. The Bulldogs were the only team to hold the breakout star to fewer than 150 yards and one of just three to keep him out of the end zone through the air. Now, he did set a career high with two rushing scores in the win, but 69 passing yards against Mississippi State? <em>That</em> Mississippi State? The trendy Heisman dark horse needs a better effort in the rematch.</p>

        <p>The <a target="_blank" href="https://www.cbssports.com/wnba/teams/GS/golden-state-valkyries/">Golden State Valkyries</a>' historic debut season reached new heights on Thursday when they clinched a playoff spot with an 84-80 win over the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.cbssports.com/wnba/teams/DAL/dallas-wings/">Dallas Wings</a>. The Valkyries are the first expansion team in WNBA history to make the playoffs in their inaugural season.Â </p><p>When the Wings jumped out to a 10-0 lead in the opening minutes, it looked like it might not be the Valkyries' night. But as they've done all season long, the Valkyries found a way to overcome adversity. They battled back in the second half and went ahead for good on a <a target="_blank" href="https://www.cbssports.com/wnba/players/29362928/carla-leite/">Carla Leite</a> bucket with 2:26 remaining. When the final buzzer sounded, streamers fell from the rafters and the team celebrated at midcourt.Â </p>
<p>The Valkyries, the first expansion team to join the league since the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.cbssports.com/wnba/teams/ATL/atlanta-dream/">Atlanta Dream</a> in 2008, faced plenty of questions after their expansion draft back in December, in which they favored hard-working veterans over younger players with potential. As it turned out, the front office led by Ohemaa Nyanin and coaching staff led by Natalie Nakase knew exactly what they were doing.Â </p><p>A tough schedule over the first few weeks led to a 2-5 start, but since then the Valkyries have been one of the league's best teams despite a parade of injuries. <a target="_blank" href="https://www.cbssports.com/wnba/players/28850640/veronica-burton/">Veronica Burton</a> is the only player on the roster who has played in every game thus far, and 19 different players have appeared in a game. Most notably, leading scorer <a target="_blank" href="https://www.cbssports.com/wnba/players/26678082/kayla-thornton/">Kayla Thornton</a> went down with a season-ending knee injury shortly after becoming the first All-Star in franchise history.Â </p>

They don't have a healthy player averaging more than 11.9 points per game this season, and they have the worst offensive rating (102.3, ninth in the league) of any team currently in playoff position.Â </p><p>The Valkyries have managed to exceed expectations thanks to an elite defense. They lead the league in field goal defense, and are holding opponents to just 40.4% from the field, which would be the be lowest opponent field goal percentage since the 2020 Seattle Storm (40.1%). Overall, the Valkyries rank third in defensive rating (99.7).Â </p><a href="https://www.cbssports.com/wnba/news/how-the-valkyries-created-an-unmatched-wnba-home-court-advantage-and-why-expectations-are-high-in-ballhalla/" target="_blank">

<p>Off the court, the Valkyries have also excelled. In March, the they became the first team in WNBA history to sell 10,000 season tickets. All 20 of their home games have been sold out, and their average attendance of 18,064 not only leads the league, but is also on pace to be an all-time record. At home in Ballhalla, the team's nickname for the Chase Center, the Valkyries are 13-7 with a plus-8.8 net rating.Â </p>
<p>The Valkyries have set a high bar for the wave of expansion teams set to follow them. The Portland Fire and Toronto Tempo will join next season, followed by yet unnamed franchises in Cleveland (2028), Detroit (2029) and Philadelphia (2030), which will bring the league to 18 teams.</p>

        <p>Entering this summer, Amanda Anisimova had never been to a slam final. Now, she's heading to her second in three months. The 24-year-old American is into the US Open women's singles final with a 6-7(4), 7-6(3), 6-3 win over No. 23 Naomi Osaka.</p><p>Anisimova will face No. 1 seed Aryna Sabalenka in Saturday's final.</p><p>"This has been a dream of mine, like, forever is to be in the US Open final," Anisimova told ESPN on her on-court interview. "Obviously the hope is to be the champion, but I'm in the final now, and I'm gonna try to get ready, but I'm just excited. It's really special."</p><p>Osaka broke Anisimova in the first game of the match. After Anisimova took a 30-0 lead, she committed four straight unforced errors, including a double fault.</p><p>Down 0-40 on her second service game and in danger of letting things get out of control early, Anisimova fought off three break points to remain just one break down, and she promptly broke Osaka back to get on serve. Osaka would break right back, though, as both players had issues with their serve.</p>
<p>Serving for the set up 5-4, Osaka fell down 0-40, and Anisimova converted her second break point opportunity of the game, jumping all over an Osaka second serve.</p><p>The momentum quickly swung the other way in the tiebreaker, though: down 2-1, Anisimova double faulted and then put a relatively straightforward forehand into the net. That was more than enough room for Osaka to win the tiebreaker comfortably, 7-4.</p><p>The second set began with a pair of breaks and then a pair of holds before Anisimova got up a break when Osaka sent a shot long. The No. 23 seed slammed a tennis ball onto the court in frustration.</p>
<p>Osaka's frustration continued to simmer -- she slammed her racket into the ground a couple of times -- during the next game, but she ended up breaking back anyway. Again, it wasn't the most beautiful tennis Arthur Ashe Stadium has ever seen.</p><p>The seesaw match tilted back in Anisimova's favor in the ninth game of the second set. Down 40-0, she ripped off six straight points, the last one featuring some marvelous defense, to go up a break, 5-4.</p><p>This time, though, it was Anisimova's turn to fail to serve out the set, another double fault allowing Osaka to get back on serve.</p>
<p>In the second-set tiebreak, Anisimova was the one taking control with a quick 4-0 lead. She closed out the set on an Osaka unforced error.</p><p>Osaka headed back to the locker room between the second and third set and appeared to be dealing with a foot issue -- a trainer came out early in the third set -- as Anisimova went up an early break.</p><p>This time, Anisimova would not give her hard-earned break back. Serving for the match, Anisimova unleashed big serves and the crisp, powerful ground strokes that have fueled her rise. After failing to convert two match points -- and even facing two break points herself -- Anisimova unleashed a pair of strong forehand winners to close things out.</p>
<p>Anisimova will be looking to improve on her first performance in a slam final; at the Wimbledon final in July, she lost 6-0, 6-0 to Iga Swiatek. Anisimova, who beat Swiatek in the US Open quarters Wednesday, is the first woman to reach a slam final after losing the previous slam's final 6-0, 6-0.</p><p>She needed all that resilience, and then some, against Osaka, who has been plenty resilient herself throughout this tournament, her deepest slam run since winning the 2021 Australian Open.</p><p>"Naomi is playing amazing tennis," Anisimova said. "She's back where she belongs. I just told her I'm so proud of her after having a baby and playing at this level. It's insane."</p>
<p>Anisimova is 6-3 against Sabalenka, including a three-set win over her at Wimbledon.</p>
