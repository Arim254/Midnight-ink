        <p>For the second straight season, the NFL scheduled an exciting Week 1 matchup in Brazil. The Los Angeles Chargers, in their second season under coach Jim Harbaugh, are the "home" team against the three-time reigning AFC champion Kansas City Chiefs on Friday night. The game features an exciting matchup of top NFL quarterbacks: the future Hall of Famer Patrick Mahomes and his rival, Justin Herbert. Kansas City has won each of the last seven matchups, though six of them have been within one score. The latest <a target="_blank" href="https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/odds/">NFL odds</a> list Herbert's over/under for total passing yards as high as 227.5, while Mahomes' tops out at 243.5, but there are also alternate NFL player props you can play to enhance your payout or take out some of the risk.</p><p>Herbert's alternate line for 300 or more passing yards is +515 (risk $100 to win $515), which he's accomplished five times combined over the last two seasons. NFL alternate line props are available for nearly every offensive player in every game, and you can combine them with some of the <span><a href="https://www.cbssports.com/betting/news/sportsbook-promos/" target="_blank">best sportsbook promos</a></span> to add even more value. SportsLine's proven computer model can help you identify some of the top NFL alt props to use on some of the <span><a target="_blank" href="https://www.cbssports.com/betting/news/best-betting-apps/">best sports betting apps</a></span>. Use the latest <span><a href="https://www.cbssports.com/betting/news/draftkings-promo-code/" target="_blank">DraftKings promo code</a></span>, and you can <a href="https://martech.cbssports.com/bt/redirect/prod?b=draftkings&amp;c=sport" target="_blank">get $300 in bonus bets instantly as well as over $200 off on NFL Sunday Ticket</a>.</p><p>The model, which simulates every NFL game 10,000 times, is up well over $7,000 for $100 players on top-rated <a href="https://www.sportsline.com/nfl/picks/" target="_blank">NFL picks</a> since its inception. The model went 31-15 on top-rated picks in 2024. Anybody following its <a href="https://www.cbssports.com/betting/news/nfl/" target="_blank">NFL betting</a> picks at <a href="https://www.cbssports.com/betting/news/best-betting-apps/" target="_blank">sportsbooks</a> and on <a href="https://www.cbssports.com/betting/news/best-betting-apps/" target="_blank">betting sites</a> could have seen strong returns.</p><p><strong>Best NFL player prop longshots for Chiefs vs. Chargers:</strong></p><ul><li>Patrick Mahomes, Chiefs, 300+ passing yards (+350)</li><li>Xavier Worthy, Chiefs, 100+ receiving yards (+425)</li><li>Keenan Allen, Chargers, 50+ receiving yards (+155)</li></ul><p>Parlay these picks for +2300 odds at bet365 (odds subject to change). Use the latest <span><a href="https://www.cbssports.com/betting/news/bet365-promo-code/" target="_blank">bet365 bonus code</a></span> and <a href="https://martech.cbssports.com/bt/redirect/prod?b=bet365&amp;c=sport" target="_blank">get $300 in bonus bets on a $5 bet</a>. </p><h2>Patrick Mahomes, Chiefs, 300+ passing yards (+350)</h2><p>Between two successful offenses, the potential of a shootout is certainly in play on Friday night. Patrick Mahomes has topped 300 yards passing seven times in the regular season over the last two seasons combined. While only Cincinnati's Joe Burrow eclipsed this total against Los Angeles in 2024, Mahomes has the weapons around him to give the Chargers' secondary fits. His over/under for total passing yards is 243.5 yards, but the model is confident that the future Hall of Fame quarterback will exceed that total. You can find Mahomes priced at +350 to record 300 or more passing yards at FanDuel, where you can also <a href="https://martech.cbssports.com/bt/redirect/prod?b=fanduel&amp;c=sport" target="_blank">get $300 in bonus bets if your first wager of $5 or more wins</a>.</p><h2>Xavier Worthy, Chiefs, 100+ receiving yards (+425)</h2><p>Worthy topped this number only once last season, but it was an impressive eight reception, 157 yard, two touchdown performance in Kansas City's Super Bowl loss to Philadelphia. With Rashee Rice suspended, Worthy is Kansas City's top wide receiver for at least the first six weeks of the 2025 season. With his big play ability, the Chiefs' speedster is fully capable of surpassing this number on two or three catches. His over/under for receiving yards is 59.5, but there's excellent value from this <a href="https://martech.cbssports.com/bt/redirect/prod?b=bet365&amp;c=sport" target="_blank">alt line at bet365</a>.</p><h2>Keenan Allen, Chargers, 50+ receiving yards (+155)</h2><p>The Chargers brought the dependable Allen back after a one season stint in Chicago, where he registered 70 catches for 744 yards and seven scores last season. In 2023, he posted 1,243 yards receiving for Los Angeles, including surpassing 50 yards in 12 of 13 games. Justin Herbert already trusts the veteran receiver, and while he may not play a full complement of snaps due to the presence of second-year receiver Ladd McConkey, Allen should get enough volume to exceed this total. Once again, <a href="https://martech.cbssports.com/bt/redirect/prod?b=bet365&amp;c=sport" target="_blank">bet365 has a good alt line price here</a>.</p><h2>Where to bet NFL alternate props for Chiefs vs. Chargers</h2><p>Here is a look at sportsbooks that will offer NFL player props for Chargers vs. Chiefs in Week 1:</p><table><tbody><tr><td><strong><br />Brand</strong></td><td><strong>Promo</strong></td><td><strong>CBS promo code</strong></td></tr><tr><td>DraftKings</td><td><a href="https://martech.cbssports.com/bt/redirect/prod?b=draftkings&amp;c=sport" target="_blank">Bet $5, get $300 in bonus bets instantly + over $200 off NFL Sunday Ticket</a></td><td><a href="https://martech.cbssports.com/bt/redirect/prod?b=draftkings&amp;c=sport" target="_blank">Just click here</a></td></tr><tr><td>BetMGM</td><td><a href="https://martech.cbssports.com/bt/redirect/prod?b=betmgm&amp;c=sport" target="_blank">Up to $1,500 in bonus bets if your first bet loses</a></td><td><a href="https://martech.cbssports.com/bt/redirect/prod?b=betmgm&amp;c=sport" target="_blank">CBSSPORTS</a></td></tr><tr><td>bet365</td><td><a href="https://martech.cbssports.com/bt/redirect/prod?b=bet365&amp;c=sport" target="_blank">Bet $5, get $300 in bonus bets win or lose</a></td><td><a href="https://martech.cbssports.com/bt/redirect/prod?b=bet365&amp;c=sport" target="_blank">CBSBET365</a></td></tr><tr><td>Caesars</td><td><a href="https://martech.cbssports.com/bt/redirect/prod?b=caesars&amp;c=sport" target="_blank">Bet $1, double your winnings your next 20 bets</a></td><td><a href="https://martech.cbssports.com/bt/redirect/prod?b=caesars&amp;c=sport" target="_blank">CBS20X</a></td></tr><tr><td>FanDuel</td><td><a href="https://martech.cbssports.com/bt/redirect/prod?b=fanduel&amp;c=sport" target="_blank">Bet $5, get $300 in bonus bets if your bet wins</a></td><td><a href="https://martech.cbssports.com/bt/redirect/prod?b=fanduel&amp;c=sport" target="_blank">Just click here</a></td></tr><tr><td>Fanatics</td><td><a href="https://martech.cbssports.com/bt/redirect/prod?b=fanatics&amp;c=sport" target="_blank">Get $100 No Sweat Bet in FanCash on every Game Day</a>  </td><td><a href="https://martech.cbssports.com/bt/redirect/prod?b=fanatics&amp;c=sport" target="_blank">Just click here</a></td></tr></tbody></table><h2>Get more Week 1 NFL picks</h2><p><strong>You've seen the model's NFL picks for Chiefs vs. Chargers player props for Week 1.

        <p>It's an AFC West showdown from Brazil on Friday as the three-time defending AFC champion Kansas City Chiefs take on the Los Angeles Chargers. While the Chiefs have won seven straight games in the rivalry, six of them have been decided by seven points or fewer, and another close game is expected in the opener. Surprisingly, no player has shorter anytime touchdown odds than Chiefs wide receiver Xavier Worthy at +125, followed by running backs Omarion Hampton (Chargers, +150), and Isiah Pacheco (Chiefs, +150).</p><p>Targeting NFL player props is one way to approach <a href="https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/odds/" target="_blank">NFL odds</a> at <a href="https://www.cbssports.com/betting/" target="_blank">online sports betting</a> sites for NFL Week 1 <a href="https://www.cbssports.com/betting/" target="_blank">betting</a>.

He is not only Kansas City's No. 1 wide receiver with Rashee Rice out for the first six weeks (suspension), but the speedster adds a rushing threat. In last year's opener against the Ravens, Worthy scored one touchdown rushing and one receiving. He had three total rushing scores in 2024 and could be used for a few gadget plays on the ground in the season opener. The model predicts he scores 0.44 receiving touchdowns on average, making him a solid value at this price from DraftKings.</p><h2>Ladd McConkey, Chargers (+170, Caesars)</h2><p>McConkey caught seven touchdown passes in his rookie season, including one against Kansas City, the only time he faced them in 2024. In Los Angeles' postseason loss to Houston, the Chargers' slot receiver posted a 9-197-1 line, including an 86-yard touchdown. The Chiefs' secondary can be susceptible to big plays, and it's likely that Justin Herbert will pepper his top wide receiver with targets. The model predicts that McConkey scores 0.43 touchdowns on average, making this a good value.</p><h2>Quentin Johnston, Chargers (+350, FanDuel)</h2><p>This one is a bit of a surprise as the model projects Los Angeles' deep threat to score 0.38 times on average. Though he's returning from a concussion suffered in a preseason game, Johnston should be ready to go in Brazil on Friday night. Last season, he scored eight times, including once against Kansas City. He is a top red zone weapon for the Chargers, and there's great value on his prop from FanDuel. </p><h2>Want more Week 1 NFL picks?</h2><p><strong>You've seen the model's NFL picks for Chiefs vs. Chargers anytime TD props for Week 1.

        <p>Indiana Fever star Caitlin Clark will miss the remainder of the 2025 WNBA season, <a href="https://x.com/CaitlinClark22/status/1963759570536333690" target="_blank">she announced on Thursday night</a>. Clark hasn't played since July 15 due to a groin injury, and her season is now over amidst a difficult rehab process.</p><p>Clark announced the news on social media, and she expressed frustration at her lack of progress. In spite of her personal setback, Clark called on the Fever to continue their playoff push without her in the lineup.</p><p>"I had hoped to share a better update, but I will not be returning to play this season," Clark wrote. "I spent hours in the gym every day with the singular goal of getting back out there, disappointed isn't a big enough word to describe how I am feeling. I want to thank everyone who had my back through all the uncertainty.</p><p>"This has been incredibly frustrating, but even in the bad, there is good. The way the fans continued to show up for me, and for the Fever, brought me so much joy and important perspective. I am so proud of how this team has only gotten stronger through adversity this year. Now it's time to close out the season and claim our spot in the Playoffs."</p>
<p>After a historic Rookie of the Year campaign, Clark's sophomore season was derailed by injuries. </p><p>She only played 13 times due to a left quad strain that kept her out for three weeks, a left groin injury that sidelined her for two weeks and now a right groin injury. Clark also suffered a left ankle bone bruise while rehabbing her current groin issue. </p><p>In 13 games, she averaged 16.5 points and 8.8 assists per game. Clark, however, shot just 27.9%from 3-point range on eight attempts per game. She was named an All-Star, but Clark missed out on the Commissioner's Cup championship and All-Star weekend in her adopted home city of Indianapolis. </p>

"She's been able to get up-and-down 5-on-0, been able to do shooting, but hasn't been able to get a whole lot of contact."</p><p>Earlier this month, White said that she wants to see Clark participate in "multiple practices" before she returns to game action. She clarified that because the team will have limited practice time down the stretch, that doesn't necessarily mean team practices, but could include 3-on-3 or 4-on-4 work. </p><p>"I want to see her in practice, live in practice," White said. "I want to see her to continue to work to not just build endurance, but to be able to handle contact 94 feet as it's going to be in game, and to be able to do that and sustain from an endurance standpoint, and that's going to take multiple practices to make sure that there's no regression. As most of us know, when we get fatigued, we look different. [We need to see] how she plays through fatigue."</p><p>The Fever were 8-5 with Clark in the lineup and 13-15 without her. At 21-20, they currently hold the eighth and final playoff spot, but are just 1½ games up on the ninth-place <a target="_blank" href="https://www.cbssports.com/wnba/teams/LAS/los-angeles-sparks/">Sparks</a>, who own the tiebreaker between the two teams. </p>

        <p>WWE is bringing a new pay-per-view to its event calendar. Wrestlepalooza is headed to Indianapolis following Clash in Paris, with John Cena in the main event.</p><p>Wrestlepalooza takes place in Indianapolis, the site of this year's Royal Rumble, on Sept. 21. WWE <span><a href="https://www.cbssports.com/wwe/news/wwe-announces-new-ppv-wrestlepalooza-for-september-with-john-cena-and-cody-rhodes-expected-to-compete/" target="_blank">announced</a></span> that Cena will headline the card as part of his retirement tour. Other notable stars expected are Cody Rhodes, CM Punk, Becky Lynch and Drew McIntyre. Wrestlepalooza will be the first PPV to air as part of WWE's recent deal with ESPN, and it goes head-to-head against AEW All Out.</p><p>One week before WrestlePalooza, WWE's YouTube channel hosts Worlds Collide, the latest crossover event between WWE and Mexican promotion AAA. Though not technically a PPV, the card deserves mention for its main event: AAA mega champion El Hijo del Vikingo vs. intercontinental champion Dominik Mysterio.</p><p>After Worlds Collide and Wrestlepalooza, the superstars jet to Perth, Australia, for Crown Jewel before returning home for Survivor Series in San Diego. </p><p>To ensure you stay up to date with all of WWE's signature events -- each of which will be covered right here by CBS Sports -- check out the entire 2025 PPV schedule (at least the events we know about at this time) below, along with the dates and locations of all key upcoming events. </p>

        <p>Nearly a year removed from last season's loss to <a target="_blank" href="https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/teams/UK/kentucky-wildcats/">Kentucky</a>, Lane Kiffin is still haunted by a setback that derailed <a target="_blank" href="https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/teams/MISS/ole-miss-rebels/">Ole Miss</a>' unbeaten start and altered its place in the playoff conversation. The Wildcats stunned the Rebels as heavy underdogs, and the defeat continues to linger for Kiffin ahead of Saturday's return trip to Lexington. </p><p>"It was really hard to deal with," Kiffin said Monday, noting that last year's early — and sleepy — kickoff didn't help. "I just didn't think we played that well either. ... It just all sucked." </p><p>No. 21 Ole Miss, <span><a href="https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/news/best-college-football-transfer-portal-fits-colorado-adds-star-edge-ole-miss-lands-stud-rb-in-spring-window/" target="_blank">now built around a new roster</a></span> outside of a handful of returning starters, rolled past <a target="_blank" href="https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/teams/GAST/georgia-state-panthers/">Georgia State</a> 63-10 in the opener behind first-year starting quarterback <a target="_blank" href="https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/players/29159005/austin-simmons/">Austin Simmons</a>, who replaced first-round pick Jaxson Dart. Kentucky, picked near the bottom of the SEC this fall, survived a 24-16 scare against <a target="_blank" href="https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/teams/TOLEDO/toledo-rockets/">Toledo</a>. </p><h2> Ole Miss vs. Kentucky: Need to know  </h2><p><strong>Battle of transfer backs:</strong> Kentucky's <a target="_blank" href="https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/players/29122137/dante-dowdell/">Dante Dowdell</a> and Ole Miss' <a target="_blank" href="https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/players/29387514/kewan-lacy/">Kewan Lacy</a> both cleared the 100-yard mark in successful openers. Dowdell, who spent time at <a target="_blank" href="https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/teams/OREG/oregon-ducks/">Oregon</a> and <a target="_blank" href="https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/teams/NEB/nebraska-cornhuskers/">Nebraska</a>, posted the first 100-yard game of his career with 129 yards against Toledo, punctuated by a 79-yard touchdown run in the fourth quarter. Lacy, a <a target="_blank" href="https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/teams/MIZZOU/missouri-tigers/">Missouri</a> transfer, scored three times and rumbled for 108 yards in his Rebels debut. </p><p><strong>Rebels' poll streak:</strong> Dating back to the 2023 opener, Ole Miss has appeared in every AP Top 25 with 22 wins over that span. Kentucky, meanwhile, is 3-7 against ranked foes in that same stretch under Mark Stoops  including last year's upset of the Rebels in Oxford. </p>
<p><strong>Yards per play:</strong> Ole Miss averaged 8.9 yards per play and racked up 33 first downs in its opener, compared to Kentucky's slower, grind-it-out pace. The Wildcats averaged just 4.6 yards per play with only three explosive gains: Dowdell's long run and chain-moving receptions from <a target="_blank" href="https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/players/28901524/josh-kattus/">Josh Kattus</a> and <a target="_blank" href="https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/players/29417673/willie-rodriguez/">Willie Rodriguez</a>. Transfer quarterback <a target="_blank" href="https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/players/3121158/zach-calzada/">Zach Calzada</a> struggled in his debut, finishing with 85 yards and an interception. </p><h2> Where to watch Ole Miss vs. Kentucky live </h2><p><strong>Date</strong>: Saturday, Sept. 6 | <strong>Time</strong>: 3:30 p.m. ET<br /> <strong>Location</strong>: Kroger Field -- Lexington, Kentucky<br /> <strong>TV: </strong>ABC | <strong>Live stream: </strong><a href="https://www.fubo.tv/welcome/leagues/191261?irad=399332&amp;irmp=416484&amp;sharedid=HTW" target="_blank">Fubo</a> (Try for free) </p><h2> Ole Miss vs. Kentucky prediction, picks </h2>
<p>The last four matchups in this SEC series have all been decided by three points or less, including a pair of shootouts in the Bluegrass. There's not an analytical edge here, but Stoops' program seems to get up for this matchup more than a few others in the conference and coming off last season's victory over the Rebels, already knows a double-digit spread doesn't mean much. Simmons had two giveaways in the opener, so he'll need to trim those mistakes to win on the road. Ole Miss wins this one, but Kentucky covers. </p>

        <p>For the second straight year, the NFL schedule has a Week 1 Friday night contest in Brazil. The three-time defending AFC champion Kansas City Chiefs are the road team while their AFC West division rivals, the Los Angeles Chargers, are at "home" in Brazil. The Chiefs have won each of the last seven meetings dating back to 2021, though six of the seven have been via one possession. The featured matchup is between the quarterbacks: Justin Herbert leads an improved Los Angeles team, while Patrick Mahomes continues his ascent among the greatest of all-time for Kansas City. The latest <a target="_blank" href="https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/odds/">NFL odds</a> list Herbert's over/under for total passing attempts at 33.5, while Mahomes' over/under for his longest completion is 35.5 yards. </p><p>Kickoff for Chiefs vs. Chargers on Friday Night Football is set for 8 p.m. ET at Neo Quimica Arena in São Paulo, Brazil. With NFL props available for almost every player in every game at <a href="https://www.cbssports.com/betting/news/best-betting-apps/" target="_blank">sportsbooks</a>, SportsLine's proven computer model can help you find value to add to your Chargers vs. Chiefs picks.

The model went 31-15 on top-rated picks in 2024. Anybody following its <span><a href="https://www.cbssports.com/betting/news/nfl/" target="_blank">NFL betting</a></span> picks at <a target="_blank" href="https://www.cbssports.com/betting/news/best-betting-apps/">sportsbooks</a> and on <a target="_blank" href="https://www.cbssports.com/betting/news/best-betting-apps/">betting sites</a> could have seen strong returns. Now, the model has revealed its top Chiefs vs. Chargers NFL player prop picks: </p><p><strong>Best Friday Night Football player prop picks for Week 1:<br /></strong></p><ul><li>Patrick Mahomes, Chiefs, Over 245.5 passing yards (-125)</li><li>Ladd McConkey, Chargers, Over 71.5 receiving yards (-114)</li><li>Isiah Pacheco, Chiefs, Under 50.5 rushing yards (-114)</li></ul><p>Parlay these picks for +535 odds (risk $100 to win $534) at <a href="https://martech.cbssports.com/bt/redirect/prod?b=draftkings&amp;c=sport" target="_blank">DraftKings</a> (odds subject to change)</p><h2>Patrick Mahomes, Chiefs, Over 245.5 passing yards (-111)</h2><p>The model is projecting Mahomes to top 283 yards passing, which gives us approximately 40 yards in wiggle room vs. his over/under. Also consider that the Chiefs' star quarterback has topped this total in six of his last eight games against the Chargers. Considering that Kansas City may struggle to run against Los Angeles' defensive line, it's conceivable to think that Mahomes may be asked to carry a heavier load in the passing game in Week 1. </p><h2>Ladd McConkey, Chargers, Over 71.5 receiving yards (-114)</h2><p>In his rookie season, McConkey topped 71 yards in six of his last seven games, including an impressive 9-197-1 performance in the Chargers loss to Houston in the AFC Wild Card playoff game. In his one appearance against the Chiefs in 2024, the 6'0" receiver posted a 5-67-1 line but should see double-digit targets on Friday night. The model projects him at 92.9 yards, which is more than 20 yards above the oddsmakers' yardage line.</p><h2>Isiah Pacheco, Chiefs, Under 50.5 rushing yards (-114)</h2><p>The Chiefs were held below four yards per carry in their two games against Los Angeles last season. The model is projecting Kansas City's No. 1 running back to rush for 38.6 yards, well below his sportsbook total. With Kareem Hunt as the primary pass catching back, any second half deficit could keep Pacheco on the bench for long stretches and limit his chance to top 50 yards rushing.</p><h2>Want more Week 1 NFL picks?</h2><p><strong>You've seen the model's NFL picks for Chiefs vs. Chargers player props for Week 1.

The preseason Heisman Trophy favorite <a target="_blank" href="https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/news/arch-mannings-heisman-trophy-odds-plummet-after-dreadful-first-start-against-ohio-state-no-longer-favorite/">suddenly has heaps of ground to make up</a> after he ceded frontrunner status to <a target="_blank" href="https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/teams/LSU/lsu-tigers/">LSU's</a> <a target="_blank" href="https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/players/26701706/garrett-nussmeier/">Garrett Nussmeier</a>.</p><p>Those stars from the top-10 matchups were far from the only Heisman hopefuls to make statements, for better or worse, in <a target="_blank" href="https://cbssports.com/college-football/">college football's</a> loaded opening week. The race for the sport's highest individual honor could not be more wide open with so much season left to be played, but every game counts, and each data point has long-term implications in the process of determining who hoists the trophy in December.</p><p>The upcoming Week 2 slate is significantly lighter on marquee matchups, but that does not mean the next batch of games is unimportant in defining the road to glory. The strongest Heisman contenders go above and beyond regardless of their opponent, and quite a few of this year's hopefuls have an opportunity this week to pad their stats against inferior foes.</p><a href="https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/news/college-football-qb-power-rankings-arch-manning-falls-from-top-50-tcus-josh-hoover-ascends-to-no-1-spot/" target="_blank">

The second-year LSU starter and reigning SEC completions leader went 28-for-38 for 230 yards and a touchdown against Clemson and capped off his night with what proved to be the decisive score: an 8-yard touchdown pass to <a target="_blank" href="https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/players/29390367/treydez-green/">Trey'Dez Green</a>.</p><p>Nussmeier entered the Tigers vs. Tigers clash tied with Clemson's Cade Klubnik on the odds board and gained meaningful separation from him with a noticeably better performance. Stacking up ranked wins like that one would not only keep the potential first-round pick in front of the Heisman pack, but it would also finally cement LSU as a real national championship contender in Year 4 of the Brian Kelly era.</p><p>The early stages of the season allow for big leaps up the odds board, and it was a good week to be a victorious quarterback. Utah dazzled in a rout of <a target="_blank" href="https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/teams/UCLA/ucla-bruins/">UCLA</a>, and dual-threat transfer Devon Dampier looked the part of a quarterback who could lead his team to a Big 12 title. He misfired just four times on 25 pass attempts, ran for 87 yards and found the end zone three times -- twice through the air and once on the ground. The market loved what it saw. Dampier's Heisman odds improved twofold from +5000 to +2500 in the matter of just one game.</p>
<p>Dampier was the most dramatic riser, but a bevy of other quarterbacks made leaps worthy of recognition, too. Georgia's Gunner Stockton passed for two touchdowns and ran for two more to become the second-steepest climber behind Dampier. John Mateer, Carson Beck and Jackson Arnold all lived up to their transfer hype at their respective schools. LaNorris Sellers looked like a certified playmaker for South Carolina. And the Dante Moore era is off and running at Oregon in style.</p><h2>Stock down: Defensive battle hurts Manning, Ohio State</h2><p>The Manning hype dwindled quickly. He and the Texas offense are far, far away from being a lost cause, though. One bad game against what may very well be the best defense in <a target="_blank" href="https://cbssports.com/college-football/">college football</a> <a target="_blank" href="https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/news/resetting-arch-mannings-expectations-at-texas-in-2025-after-steve-sarkisian-says-hype-was-out-of-control/">should not be cause for massive concern</a>, particularly because it came on the road in Manning's first outing as a full-time starter. His poor timing and head-scratching overthrows and underthrows do not have to define his season.</p><p>On the other side of that No. 1 vs. No. 3 showdown, it was not as though Ohio State's individual standouts got off to a hot start, either. Julian Sayin looked very much like a redshirt freshman making his first career start against an equally formidable defense, and for the second time in as many years, Jeremiah Smith was only a modest factor against the Longhorns. Neither bolstered their Heisman candidacy despite what was a gargantuan team result.</p>
<p>Heisman voters will want to see more from Cade Klubnik the rest of the year, too. While he seemed down the stretch of the 2024 season to assuage the concerns surrounding his performance against top competition, <a target="_blank" href="https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/news/clemsons-dabo-swinney-calls-out-cade-klubnik-says-biggest-problem-vs-lsu-was-best-player-didnt-play-well/">he faltered in his first test of 2025</a>. The 50% completion rate and interception he logged against LSU were reminiscent of his struggles against Georgia a year ago and <a target="_blank" href="https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/teams/ND/notre-dame-fighting-irish/">Notre Dame</a> the season prior.</p><figure><p><img alt="Texas v Ohio State" src="https://sportshub.cbsistatic.com/i/r/2025/09/03/9d1dd8df-62de-4707-b613-ddfea5d58f60/resize/670x377/3d798bad3e7496115e9579737954ddfb/arch.jpg" /></p><figcaption><span>Texas quarterback Arch Manning is no longer the Heisman favorite after last week's loss to Caleb Downs and Ohio State. </span><span>

Week 2 is, um, a bit lighter on big-time showdowns. No. 15 <a target="_blank" href="https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/teams/MICH/michigan-wolverines/">Michigan</a> and No. 18 Oklahoma will take center stage in a game that carries significant Heisman implications, though.</p><h3>John Mateer vs. Michigan</h3><p>Okay, John Mateer, you ripped an FCS defense to shreds. Now show us what you have against almighty Michigan. Mateer's Oklahoma debut was historic. He set the school record for most passing yards in a debut with 392 against <a target="_blank" href="https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/teams/ILST/illinois-state-redbirds/">Illinois State</a> to go with three touchdowns, 24 rushing yards and another score on the ground. But the looming Wolverines are about as different of a beast as there is in college football. This is exactly the kind of game that Brent Venables brought Mateer in from <a target="_blank" href="https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/teams/WASHST/washington-state-cougars/">Washington State</a> for, and it is precisely the type of all-eyes-on-me opportunity he needs to make a statement in front of Heisman voters.</p>
<h3>Dante Moore vs. <a target="_blank" href="https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/teams/OKLAST/oklahoma-state-cowboys/">Oklahoma State</a></h3><p>Dante Moore's last start against a Power Four opponent came in Nov. 2023, and he threw two interceptions in that game. This week will show how much growth he made in his developmental year at Oregon. Another good outing to open his starting stint with the Ducks would be a solid first step in proving he is a different player from the one that began his career at UCLA as an underwhelming five-star freshman. Oklahoma State's is a nice, soft defense to help him ease into Power Four action.</p><h3>Sam Leavitt vs. <a target="_blank" href="https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/teams/MISSST/mississippi-state-bulldogs/">Mississippi State</a></h3><p>Arizona State heads to SEC country for the second leg of a home-and-home with Mississippi State -- the one opponent that truly had Sam Leavitt's number in 2024. The Bulldogs were the only team to hold the breakout star to fewer than 150 yards and one of just three to keep him out of the end zone through the air. Now, he did set a career high with two rushing scores in the win, but 69 passing yards against Mississippi State? <em>That</em> Mississippi State? The trendy Heisman dark horse needs a better effort in the rematch.</p>

        <p>The <a target="_blank" href="https://www.cbssports.com/wnba/teams/GS/golden-state-valkyries/">Golden State Valkyries</a>' historic debut season reached new heights on Thursday when they clinched a playoff spot with an 84-80 win over the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.cbssports.com/wnba/teams/DAL/dallas-wings/">Dallas Wings</a>. The Valkyries are the first expansion team in WNBA history to make the playoffs in their inaugural season. </p><p>When the Wings jumped out to a 10-0 lead in the opening minutes, it looked like it might not be the Valkyries' night. But as they've done all season long, the Valkyries found a way to overcome adversity. They battled back in the second half and went ahead for good on a <a target="_blank" href="https://www.cbssports.com/wnba/players/29362928/carla-leite/">Carla Leite</a> bucket with 2:26 remaining. When the final buzzer sounded, streamers fell from the rafters and the team celebrated at midcourt. </p>
<p>The Valkyries, the first expansion team to join the league since the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.cbssports.com/wnba/teams/ATL/atlanta-dream/">Atlanta Dream</a> in 2008, faced plenty of questions after their expansion draft back in December, in which they favored hard-working veterans over younger players with potential. As it turned out, the front office led by Ohemaa Nyanin and coaching staff led by Natalie Nakase knew exactly what they were doing. </p><p>A tough schedule over the first few weeks led to a 2-5 start, but since then the Valkyries have been one of the league's best teams despite a parade of injuries. <a target="_blank" href="https://www.cbssports.com/wnba/players/28850640/veronica-burton/">Veronica Burton</a> is the only player on the roster who has played in every game thus far, and 19 different players have appeared in a game. Most notably, leading scorer <a target="_blank" href="https://www.cbssports.com/wnba/players/26678082/kayla-thornton/">Kayla Thornton</a> went down with a season-ending knee injury shortly after becoming the first All-Star in franchise history. </p>

They don't have a healthy player averaging more than 11.9 points per game this season, and they have the worst offensive rating (102.3, ninth in the league) of any team currently in playoff position. </p><p>The Valkyries have managed to exceed expectations thanks to an elite defense. They lead the league in field goal defense, and are holding opponents to just 40.4% from the field, which would be the be lowest opponent field goal percentage since the 2020 Seattle Storm (40.1%). Overall, the Valkyries rank third in defensive rating (99.7). </p><a href="https://www.cbssports.com/wnba/news/how-the-valkyries-created-an-unmatched-wnba-home-court-advantage-and-why-expectations-are-high-in-ballhalla/" target="_blank">

<p>Off the court, the Valkyries have also excelled. In March, the they became the first team in WNBA history to sell 10,000 season tickets. All 20 of their home games have been sold out, and their average attendance of 18,064 not only leads the league, but is also on pace to be an all-time record. At home in Ballhalla, the team's nickname for the Chase Center, the Valkyries are 13-7 with a plus-8.8 net rating. </p>
<p>The Valkyries have set a high bar for the wave of expansion teams set to follow them. The Portland Fire and Toronto Tempo will join next season, followed by yet unnamed franchises in Cleveland (2028), Detroit (2029) and Philadelphia (2030), which will bring the league to 18 teams.</p>

        <p>Entering this summer, Amanda Anisimova had never been to a slam final. Now, she's heading to her second in three months. The 24-year-old American is into the US Open women's singles final with a 6-7(4), 7-6(3), 6-3 win over No. 23 Naomi Osaka.</p><p>Anisimova will face No. 1 seed Aryna Sabalenka in Saturday's final.</p><p>"This has been a dream of mine, like, forever is to be in the US Open final," Anisimova told ESPN on her on-court interview. "Obviously the hope is to be the champion, but I'm in the final now, and I'm gonna try to get ready, but I'm just excited. It's really special."</p><p>Osaka broke Anisimova in the first game of the match. After Anisimova took a 30-0 lead, she committed four straight unforced errors, including a double fault.</p><p>Down 0-40 on her second service game and in danger of letting things get out of control early, Anisimova fought off three break points to remain just one break down, and she promptly broke Osaka back to get on serve. Osaka would break right back, though, as both players had issues with their serve.</p>
<p>Serving for the set up 5-4, Osaka fell down 0-40, and Anisimova converted her second break point opportunity of the game, jumping all over an Osaka second serve.</p><p>The momentum quickly swung the other way in the tiebreaker, though: down 2-1, Anisimova double faulted and then put a relatively straightforward forehand into the net. That was more than enough room for Osaka to win the tiebreaker comfortably, 7-4.</p><p>The second set began with a pair of breaks and then a pair of holds before Anisimova got up a break when Osaka sent a shot long. The No. 23 seed slammed a tennis ball onto the court in frustration.</p>
<p>Osaka's frustration continued to simmer -- she slammed her racket into the ground a couple of times -- during the next game, but she ended up breaking back anyway. Again, it wasn't the most beautiful tennis Arthur Ashe Stadium has ever seen.</p><p>The seesaw match tilted back in Anisimova's favor in the ninth game of the second set. Down 40-0, she ripped off six straight points, the last one featuring some marvelous defense, to go up a break, 5-4.</p><p>This time, though, it was Anisimova's turn to fail to serve out the set, another double fault allowing Osaka to get back on serve.</p>
<p>In the second-set tiebreak, Anisimova was the one taking control with a quick 4-0 lead. She closed out the set on an Osaka unforced error.</p><p>Osaka headed back to the locker room between the second and third set and appeared to be dealing with a foot issue -- a trainer came out early in the third set -- as Anisimova went up an early break.</p><p>This time, Anisimova would not give her hard-earned break back. Serving for the match, Anisimova unleashed big serves and the crisp, powerful ground strokes that have fueled her rise. After failing to convert two match points -- and even facing two break points herself -- Anisimova unleashed a pair of strong forehand winners to close things out.</p>
<p>Anisimova will be looking to improve on her first performance in a slam final; at the Wimbledon final in July, she lost 6-0, 6-0 to Iga Swiatek. Anisimova, who beat Swiatek in the US Open quarters Wednesday, is the first woman to reach a slam final after losing the previous slam's final 6-0, 6-0.</p><p>She needed all that resilience, and then some, against Osaka, who has been plenty resilient herself throughout this tournament, her deepest slam run since winning the 2021 Australian Open.</p><p>"Naomi is playing amazing tennis," Anisimova said. "She's back where she belongs. I just told her I'm so proud of her after having a baby and playing at this level. It's insane."</p>
<p>Anisimova is 6-3 against Sabalenka, including a three-set win over her at Wimbledon.</p>
