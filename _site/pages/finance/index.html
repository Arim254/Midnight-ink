He's set to replace Adriana Kugler, who resigned unexpectedly at the beginning of August.</p><p>Miran's appointment comes amid speculation that Trump would seek to nominate a "shadow chair" and obtain ample influence in the central bank, raising fears about the central bank's independence. Miran keeping his White House job while serving as Fed governor could further fuel those concerns.</p><p>"I have been advised by counsel that the legal approach is to take an unpaid leave of absence from the Council of Economic Advisors, cease my activities and if council advises me otherwise, I will follow the law and follow council's advice," Miran said at the hearing.</p><p>"The term for which I've been nominated is four and a half months. If I am nominated and confirmed for a longer term than just a handful of months, I would absolutely resign," he added.</p><p>Trump has been pushing for sharply lower interest rates, criticizing current Fed Chair Jerome Powell for staying put for too long. At the hearing, Miran repeatedly <a target="_blank" href="https://www.cnbc.com/2025/09/03/stephen-miran-trumps-fed-governor-nominee-pledges-central-bank-independence.html">pledged to uphold the central bank's independence</a>, stressing that no one at the administration had asked him to commit to easing monetary policy.</p><p>The Fed's next policy meeting takes place on Sept. 16-17.</p></div></div>

The White House has been actively promoting artificial intelligence and domestic manufacturing, with recent announcements including a plan to reduce regulation of artificial intelligence and support for leading AI chipmakers.

"Google had a very good day yesterday. Do you want to talk about that big day you had yesterday?"</p><p>Alphabet this week <a target="_blank" href="https://www.cnbc.com/2025/09/03/alphabet-pops-after-google-avoids-breakup-in-antitrust-case.html">added</a> $230 billion to its market cap after avoiding a breakup in a landmark antitrust case brought by the U.S. Department of Justice in 2020. Google was found to hold an illegal monopoly in its core market of internet search last year. Deciding on the penalties this week, U.S. District JudgeÂ Amit Mehta <a target="_blank" href="https://www.cnbc.com/2025/09/02/google-antitrust-search-ruling.html">ruled</a> against the most severe consequences proposed by the DOJ, causing shares of the search company to jump.</p><p>"I'm glad it's over," Pichai responded to Trump, causing an eruption of laughter from the other table guests.</p><p>"It's a long process," Pichai said. "Appreciate that your administration had a constructive dialogue, and we were able to get it to some resolution."Â </p><p>"Right," Trump replied.</p><p>"The AI moment is one of the most transformative moments any of us have ever seen or will see in our lifetimes, so making sure the U.S. is at the forefront â€” and I think your administration is investing a lot," Pichai said. "Already the AI action plan under your leadership I think is a great start, and we look forward to working together. And thanks for your leadership."</p><p>The plan Pichai referred to is the administration's "<a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Americas-AI-Action-Plan.pdf" target="_blank">Winning the AI Race: America's AI Action Plan</a>," launched in July, which claims to identify 90 federal policy actions across three pillars: the acceleration of innovation, building of artificial intelligence infrastructure and leadership in international diplomacy and security. Part of that plan includes a <a target="_blank" href="https://www.cnbc.com/2025/07/24/no-woke-ai-in-washington-says-trump-as-he-launches-ai-action-plan.html">July executive order</a> that says AI models should not incorporate "Woke AI" or "ideological dogmas such as DEI," meaning diversity, equity and inclusion. Â </p><p>Google is also in discussions with Trump's lawyers for an ongoingÂ <a target="_blank" href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/07/07/trump-says-he-is-suing-facebook-google-twitter-dorsey-zuckerberg-pichai.html">lawsuit</a> that the president filed more than four years ago, accusing the online video platform YouTube of unlawful censorship. The lawsuit stemmed from the suspension of Trump's accounts on social media sites after the Jan. 6 U.S. Capitol riot.</p><p>Earlier Thursday, Pichai attended the White House "AI Education Taskforce" event hosted by First Lady Melania Trump.</p><p>Trump interrupted Pichai's Thursday evening response to say "Biden was the one who prosecuted that lawsuit, you know that right?" Trump said, referring to the search monopoly case.</p><p>The search case was brought by the DOJ while Trump was in office during his first term. Pichai did not correct him.</p><p><strong>WATCH: </strong><a target="_blank" href="https://www.cnbc.com/video/2025/09/03/alphabet-antitrust-ruling-the-dream-scenario-for-google-says-wedbushs-dan-ives.html">Alphabet antitrust ruling the 'dream scenario' for Google, says Wedbush's Dan Ives</a></p></div><div><p><img src="https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/108193895-17569274411756927438-41480201527-1080pnbcnews.jpg?v=1756927440&amp;w=750&amp;h=422&amp;vtcrop=y" alt="Alphabet antitrust ruling the 'dream scenario' for Google, says Wedbush's Dan Ives" /><span></span><span><div><p><span>watch now</span><span></span></p></div></span></p></div></div>

Microsoft is OpenAI's biggest investor, having reportedly poured $13 billion in the company.</p><p>The news was announced by Fidji Simo, chief executive officer of applications and the former head of Instacart, in a <a href="https://openai.com/index/expanding-economic-opportunity-with-ai/" target="_blank">blog post</a> on Thursday.Â </p><p>"Importantly, the jobs platform won't just be a way for big companies to attract more talent. It will have a track dedicated to helping local businesses compete, and local governments find the AI talent they need to better serve their constituents," Simo said.</p><p>She didn't elaborate further on details regarding the platform, but a company spokesperson told TechCrunch that it expects to launch the service by mid-2026.Â </p><p>Additionally, OpenAI will introduce a new certification program in connection with its "OpenAI Academy," an online learning platform that teaches workers how to use AI on the job better. This could also put it in competition with LinkedIn's learning platform, which also offers video courses across business, technology and creative fields, with certifications.</p><p>"[W]e're going to expand the Academy by offering certifications for different levels of AI fluency, from the basics of using AI at work all the way up to AI-custom jobs and prompt engineering," Simo said, adding that the program will utilize ChatGPT's Study mode<strong>. </strong>The study feature turns the chatbot into a teacher that questions, hints and provides feedback, instead of giving direct answers.</p></div><div><p><img src="https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/108192522-1756483526819-1756483225-41403454035-hd.jpg?v=1756483629&amp;w=750&amp;h=422&amp;vtcrop=y" alt="AI is eliminating jobs and climbing the corporate ladder" /><span></span><span><div><p><span>watch now</span><span></span></p></div></span></p></div><div><p>Organizations will be able to make the certificate part of their own learning and development programs, with OpenAI already working with <span><a target="_blank" href="https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/WMT/">Walmart</a><span><span></span></span></span>, the largest private employer in the U.S. OpenAI said it plans to certify 10 million Americans by 2030.</p><p>The plans come amid fears about how AI is impacting the labor market.

OpenAI is also part of the $500 billion Stargate project, which aims to invest in AI infrastructure in the U.S. over the next four years.Â </p><p>OpenAI CEO Sam Altman was part of a group of tech leaders that met with U.S. President Donald Trump on Thursday to discuss topics including the development of artificial intelligence.Â </p><p>Before the dinner, first lady Melania Trump made a speech highlighting the importance of AI in education and American progress, but that "we must manage AI's growth responsibly."</p></div></div>

He's set to replace Adriana Kugler, who resigned unexpectedly at the beginning of August.</p><p>Miran's appointment comes amid speculation that Trump would seek to nominate a "shadow chair" and obtain ample influence in the central bank, raising fears about the central bank's independence. Miran keeping his White House job while serving as Fed governor could further fuel those concerns.</p><p>"I have been advised by counsel that the legal approach is to take an unpaid leave of absence from the Council of Economic Advisors, cease my activities and if council advises me otherwise, I will follow the law and follow council's advice," Miran said at the hearing.</p><p>"The term for which I've been nominated is four and a half months. If I am nominated and confirmed for a longer term than just a handful of months, I would absolutely resign," he added.</p><p>Trump has been pushing for sharply lower interest rates, criticizing current Fed Chair Jerome Powell for staying put for too long. At the hearing, Miran repeatedly <a target="_blank" href="https://www.cnbc.com/2025/09/03/stephen-miran-trumps-fed-governor-nominee-pledges-central-bank-independence.html">pledged to uphold the central bank's independence</a>, stressing that no one at the administration had asked him to commit to easing monetary policy.</p><p>The Fed's next policy meeting takes place on Sept. 16-17.</p></div></div>

Google was found to hold an illegal monopoly in its core market of internet search last year. Deciding on the penalties this week, U.S. District JudgeÂ Amit Mehta <a target="_blank" href="https://www.cnbc.com/2025/09/02/google-antitrust-search-ruling.html">ruled</a> against the most severe consequences proposed by the DOJ, causing shares of the search company to jump.</p><p>"I'm glad it's over," Pichai responded to Trump, causing an eruption of laughter from the other table guests.</p><p>"It's a long process," Pichai said. "Appreciate that your administration had a constructive dialogue, and we were able to get it to some resolution."Â </p><p>"Right," Trump replied.</p><p>"The AI moment is one of the most transformative moments any of us have ever seen or will see in our lifetimes, so making sure the U.S. is at the forefront â€” and I think your administration is investing a lot," Pichai said. "Already the AI action plan under your leadership I think is a great start, and we look forward to working together. And thanks for your leadership."</p><p>The plan Pichai referred to is the administration's "<a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Americas-AI-Action-Plan.pdf" target="_blank">Winning the AI Race: America's AI Action Plan</a>," launched in July, which claims to identify 90 federal policy actions across three pillars: the acceleration of innovation, building of artificial intelligence infrastructure and leadership in international diplomacy and security. Part of that plan includes a <a target="_blank" href="https://www.cnbc.com/2025/07/24/no-woke-ai-in-washington-says-trump-as-he-launches-ai-action-plan.html">July executive order</a> that says AI models should not incorporate "Woke AI" or "ideological dogmas such as DEI," meaning diversity, equity and inclusion.

The lawsuit stemmed from the suspension of Trump's accounts on social media sites after the Jan. 6 U.S. Capitol riot.</p><p>Earlier Thursday, Pichai attended the White House "AI Education Taskforce" event hosted by First Lady Melania Trump.</p><p>Trump interrupted Pichai's Thursday evening response to say "Biden was the one who prosecuted that lawsuit, you know that right?"

                <div><div><p>OpenAI CEO Sam Altman (L) attends a meeting of the White House Task Force on Artificial Intelligence Education in the East Room of the White House on September 04, 2025 in Washington, DC. </p><p>Chip Somodevilla | Getty Images News | Getty Images</p></div><div><p>OpenAI has announced it is developing an AI-centered jobs platform as part of broader efforts to expand AI literacy, and as the company grows its consumer and business-facing AI applications.</p><p>The ChatGPT maker's "OpenAI Jobs Platform" will utilize AI to help connect qualified job candidates to companies, which could put it in competition with Microsoft's LinkedIn.Â </p><p>OpenAI and <span><a target="_blank" href="https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/MSFT/">Microsoft</a><span><span></span></span></span> have an uneasy partnership, with Microsoft formally labeling the AI startup as a competitor in search and news advertising in its annual filing last year. Microsoft is OpenAI's biggest investor, having reportedly poured $13 billion in the company.</p><p>The news was announced by Fidji Simo, chief executive officer of applications and the former head of Instacart, in a <a href="https://openai.com/index/expanding-economic-opportunity-with-ai/" target="_blank">blog post</a> on Thursday.Â </p><p>"Importantly, the jobs platform won't just be a way for big companies to attract more talent. It will have a track dedicated to helping local businesses compete, and local governments find the AI talent they need to better serve their constituents," Simo said.</p><p>She didn't elaborate further on details regarding the platform, but a company spokesperson told TechCrunch that it expects to launch the service by mid-2026.Â </p><p>Additionally, OpenAI will introduce a new certification program in connection with its "OpenAI Academy," an online learning platform that teaches workers how to use AI on the job better. This could also put it in competition with LinkedIn's learning platform, which also offers video courses across business, technology and creative fields, with certifications.</p><p>"[W]e're going to expand the Academy by offering certifications for different levels of AI fluency, from the basics of using AI at work all the way up to AI-custom jobs and prompt engineering," Simo said, adding that the program will utilize ChatGPT's Study mode<strong>. </strong>The study feature turns the chatbot into a teacher that questions, hints and provides feedback, instead of giving direct answers.</p></div><div><p><img src="https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/108192522-1756483526819-1756483225-41403454035-hd.jpg?v=1756483629&amp;w=750&amp;h=422&amp;vtcrop=y" alt="AI is eliminating jobs and climbing the corporate ladder" /><span></span><span><div><p><span>watch now</span><span></span></p></div></span></p></div><div><p>Organizations will be able to make the certificate part of their own learning and development programs, with OpenAI already working with <span><a target="_blank" href="https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/WMT/">Walmart</a><span><span></span></span></span>, the largest private employer in the U.S. OpenAI said it plans to certify 10 million Americans by 2030.</p><p>The plans come amid fears about how AI is impacting the labor market. Business leaders like Salesforce's Marc Benioff have recently <a target="_blank" href="https://www.cnbc.com/2025/09/02/salesforce-ceo-confirms-4000-layoffs-because-i-need-less-heads-with-ai.html">announced layoffs due to AI,</a> while new studies have linked the technology to mass job loss for certain workers.Â Â </p><p>Simo acknowledged the "disruptive" force of AI in her post, saying jobs and companies will look different and need to adapt.Â </p><p>"[W]hat we can do is help more people become fluent in AI and connect them with companies that need their skills, to give people more economic opportunities.Â </p><p><a target="_blank" href="https://www.cnbc.com/2025/09/05/trump-warns-of-fairly-substantial-chip-tariffs-signals-apple-others-safe-ai-tim-cook-tech.html">Recent research</a> from labor market data company Lightcast found that roles that require AI skills pay higher salaries on average than those that don't.Â </p><p>The new initiatives were also said to come as part of OpenAI's "commitment to the White House's efforts toward expanding AI literacy."Â </p><p>The company has been strengthening ties with Washington, launching a new offering called OpenAI for Government on June 16, the same day it was awarded a contract of up to $200 million by the U.S. Department of Defense. OpenAI is also part of the $500 billion Stargate project, which aims to invest in AI infrastructure in the U.S. over the next four years.Â </p><p>OpenAI CEO Sam Altman was part of a group of tech leaders that met with U.S. President Donald Trump on Thursday to discuss topics including the development of artificial intelligence.Â </p><p>Before the dinner, first lady Melania Trump made a speech highlighting the importance of AI in education and American progress, but that "we must manage AI's growth responsibly."</p></div></div>
