That's below the consensus forecast of 75,000 from economists polled by Dow Jones and marks a significant slowdown from the revised gain of 106,000 seen in the prior month.</p><p>"The year started with strong job growth, but that momentum has been whipsawed by uncertainty," said Nela Richardson, ADP's chief economist, in a press release.</p><p>Richardson pointed to rising worries from consumers, labor shortages and disruptions tied to artificial intelligence as potential drivers of this decrease in growth.</p><p>Jobs tied to trade, transportation and utilities saw particular weakness in August, with the group losing 17,000 roles on net, according to the ADP. Education and health services followed, recording a decline of 12,000 jobs.</p><p>But those losses were offset in part by a boom in the leisure and hospitality industry, which added 50,000 jobs in the month.</p><p>Wage growth maintained the same pace in August. Those staying in their roles saw their pay rise 4.4% year-over-year, while job changes recorded a 7.1% increase over the same period.</p><p>Thursday's ADP report adds to an already concerning picture of the labor market.</p><p>Jobless claims increased to 237,000, up 8,000 from the prior week and above estimates, per data also published Thursday morning. The Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey registered <a target="_blank" href="https://www.cnbc.com/2025/09/03/job-opening-data-falls-to-levels-rarely-seen-since-pandemic.html">one of its worst levels</a> for job openings in July since 2020, according to government figures released Wednesday.</p><p>Now, attention will home in on the all-important jobs report slated for Friday morning. Economists expect the official government report to show 75,000 non-farm payrolls added in August, about even with the prior month, according to estimates collected by Dow Jones. Economists predict the unemployment rate inched up to 4.3% from 4.2%.</p><p>Labor market worries have pushed traders to build on already hefty bets that the Federal Reserve will cut rates at its meeting later this month.Â There's now a <a href="https://www.cmegroup.com/markets/interest-rates/cme-fedwatch-tool.html" target="_blank">97.4% chance</a> of a rate cut at the September gathering, up from 96.6% a day ago, according to the CME's FedWatch tool.</p><p><em>â€” CNBC's John Melloy contributed reporting.</em></p></div></div>

The fully permitted project is 80% complete and would provide enough power for more than 350,000 homes across both states.</p><p>Orsted asked the United States District Court for the District of Columbia to set aside the stop-work order, calling it "unlawful" and "issued in bad faith."</p><p>Orsted <a target="_blank" href="https://www.cnbc.com/2025/08/25/orsted-shares-tumble-as-us-halts-wind-project-construction.html">shares hit a record low</a> on Aug. 25 in the wake of the stop-work order.</p><p>The Bureau of Ocean Energy Management has justified the order on <a href="https://www.boem.gov/sites/default/files/documents/renewable-energy/Director%26%23039%3BsOrder-20250822.pdf?VersionId=Y674sNo8zi7jLu3VWRvq2hFb_8KtMldc" target="_blank">national security grounds</a> and concerns that Revolution Wind will interfere with other uses of U.S. territorial waters. But Orsted said this justification is just a pretext, pointing to President Donald Trump's long-standing animus toward wind power going back more than a decade.</p><p>"The President has apparent hostility towards offshore wind, including based on statements made on the campaign trail," Orsted's attorney told the court.</p><p>Revolution Wind has undergone extensive environmental and safety reviews over nearly a decade that cost hundreds of millions of dollars, according to Orsted's lawsuit. Federal agencies have uniformily concluded based on thousands of pages of data that the project is "environmentally sound, safe and consistent with federal law," the company said.</p><p>Trump has targeted the wind industry since his first day in office, when he issued an order that closed federal waters to new leases for offshore projects. But the renewable industry had hoped that the White House would allow permitted projects such as Revolution Wind to proceed.</p><p>Trump has escalated his attacks on the renewable energy industry in recent weeks. The president said his administration <a target="_blank" href="https://www.cnbc.com/2025/08/20/trump-says-us-will-not-approve-solar-or-wind-power-projects.html">would not approve solar and wind projects</a> two days before Revolution Wind was hit with the stop-work order.</p><p>And the Trump administration on Friday canceled <a target="_blank" href="https://www.cnbc.com/2025/08/29/trump-administration-cancels-679-million-for-offshore-wind-projects.html">$679 million in funding</a> for a dozen infrastructure projects that support the offshore wind industry.</p></div></div>
