   <p>Even by Donald Trump's <a href="https://www.npr.org/2025/08/14/nx-s1-5500509/how-much-money-is-trump-making-off-of-the-presidency" target="_blank">well-established track record</a> of making money off the presidency, he's had a banner week.</p>   <p>On Monday, President Trump's family earned <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/ckgjgyyqgvyo" target="_blank">some $5 billion</a> â€” at least on paper â€” as their latest cryptocurrency venture launched. Now a "token" from World Liberty Financial, the crypto business <a href="https://www.npr.org/2024/09/25/nx-s1-5056183/trump-has-a-pro-cryptocurrency-platform-while-harris-chases-the-crypto-vote" target="_blank">co-founded last year</a> by Trump and his sons, is trading publicly.</p>   <p>This launch highlights <a href="https://www.npr.org/transcripts/1254804015?ft=nprml&amp;f=1254804015" target="_blank">the extraordinary degree</a> to which Trump and his family are using the Oval Office to personally profit, especially through his close ties to the crypto industry. The president <a href="https://www.npr.org/2025/06/26/nx-s1-5446114/trump-wealth-business-crypto-brand-golf-course" target="_blank">reported income</a> of more than $630 million last year, including $57 million from cryptocurrency sales, before launching a<a href="https://www.npr.org/2025/01/20/nx-s1-5268759/donald-trump-melania-cryptocurrency-meme-coins" target="_blank"> "meme coin"</a> earlier this year. (He has also licensed his name to sell <a href="https://www.npr.org/2024/02/19/1232438349/donald-trump-golden-high-top-sneakers" target="_blank">sneakers</a>, watches, guitars, and <a href="https://www.npr.org/2024/03/27/1241186975/donald-trump-bible-god-bless-usa" target="_blank">Bibles</a>.)</p>   
   <p>Now anyone can buy or sell this "$WLFI" token â€” giving those wishing to curry favor with the president another avenue to directly contribute to his personal finances.</p>   <p>"You used to have to join <a href="https://www.npr.org/2022/09/08/1121578102/mar-a-lago-trump-fbi-investigation-history-merriweather-post" target="_blank">Mar-a-Lago</a>[, Trump's resort and private club]. This is much more fun. You don't even have to get out of bed in the morning," says Ross Delston, a lawyer and former banking regulator at the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp.</p>   <p>"You can invest in this [cryptocurrency], and now he's your friend," he adds. "And that could be anybody â€” somebody who's sketchy, or who's been convicted of something, or acting on behalf of a [foreign] state actor. "</p>   <p>Democratic Senator Elizabeth Warren was even more blunt. "It's corruption, plain and simple," she <a href="https://x.com/SenWarren/status/1962998997251227752" target="_blank">wrote on X</a> on Tuesday, linking to a <em>Wall Street Journal</em> <a href="https://www.wsj.com/finance/currencies/trump-family-amasses-6-billion-fortune-after-crypto-launch-567faec5" target="_blank">story </a>about the Trump family's $5 billion on-paper windfall.</p>   <p>The White House<a href="https://www.npr.org/2025/05/22/nx-s1-5407411/white-house-denies-conflicts-of-interest-as-trump-joins-dinner-for-meme-coin-investors" target="_blank"> has repeatedly</a> dismissed such criticisms over Trump's efforts to personally profit from the crypto industry.</p>   <p>"Neither the President nor his family have ever engaged, or will ever engage, in conflicts of interest," White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt told NPR in an emailed statement this week.</p>   <h3><strong>From calling crypto a "scam" to appointing pro-crypto financial cops</strong></h3>   <p>World Liberty's public launch didn't exactly set the crypto world on fire. Its tokens were priced at about <a href="https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/world-liberty-financial-wlfi/" target="_blank">22 cents each</a> by Wednesday afternoon, down from their high of 32 cents shortly after their debut.</p>   
   <p>And so far, the Trumps have limited ability to actually cash in their holdings: World Liberty Financial <a href="https://medium.com/@wlfi/understanding-the-wlfi-circulating-supply-at-launch-061f904e6923" target="_blank">says</a> that its "team," including the Trumps, were barred from selling their own tokens when they started trading publicly.</p>   <p>But even without an immediate payday, the token's debut creates more pathways for the Trump family to profit from the crypto industry that helped <a href="https://www.npr.org/2024/11/11/nx-s1-5184152/the-crypto-industry-won-big-this-election-it-has-several-implications" target="_blank">put him back in office</a>.</p>   <p>Just a few years ago, Trump<a href="https://www.foxbusiness.com/politics/crypto-potentially-a-disaster-waiting-to-happen-trump.amp" target="_blank"> called crypto a scam</a>. But now he's <a href="https://www.npr.org/transcripts/1254874796" target="_blank">embraced it</a>. Last year he courted deep-pocketed crypto investors, by<a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/fact-sheets/2025/07/fact-sheet-president-donald-j-trump-signs-genius-act-into-law/" target="_blank"> vowing to make</a> the United States the crypto capital of the world. And once he won re-election, Trump started appointing <a href="https://www.npr.org/2024/11/19/nx-s1-5189643/commerce-treasury-secretary-howard-lutnick-trump-cantor-fitzgerald" target="_blank">crypto-friendly</a> officials to his <a href="https://www.npr.org/2024/12/06/g-s1-37097/up-first-newsletter-donald-trump-crypto-syrian-rebels-gift-ideas" target="_blank">administration </a>â€” including at the financial regulatory agencies that once heavily policed the crypto industry.</p>   <p>Under President Biden, the Securities and Exchange Commission in particular <a href="https://www.npr.org/2024/11/21/g-s1-35233/sec-gary-gensler-resigns-crypto" target="_blank">cracked down heavily</a> on crypto companies, suing many for fraud and money laundering. That gave Trump an opportunity to court the vote of frustrated crypto investors, <a href="https://www.npr.org/2024/09/30/nx-s1-5130919/crypto-companies-are-spending-big-on-the-election" target="_blank">who poured money</a> into the 2024 federal elections. Last year, Trump appointed Paul Atkins, <a href="https://www.npr.org/2024/12/04/g-s1-36803/trump-crypto-paul-atkins-sec-chair" target="_blank">a crypto supporter</a>, to head the SEC.</p>   <p>At the same time, the crypto ventures that Trump and his family have started have put them in a position to profit from the more relaxed rules coming out of his administration.</p>   <p>Now there are few guardrails for how Trump is co-mingling his personal and presidential crypto interests. As Delston says: "What exists now is virtually nothing."<br /></p>

   <p>A Fox News executive has called a prominent Trump appointee a "reckless maniac."</p>   <p>Another Fox executive said, "I don't trust her to be responsible."</p>   <p>A third condemned her for the "tendency to find random conspiracy theories on weird internet sites."</p>   <p>And a Fox corporate board member called a public statement of hers "insane."</p>   <p>The person they were talking about is Jeanine Pirro, now the United States' top law enforcement official for Washington, D.C. At the time, she was a top-rated star on Fox News itself.</p>   <p>Her colleagues made those remarks in the aftermath of the 2020 presidential election, when Pirro used her platform to amplify baseless claims that victory had been stolen from President Trump.</p>   
   <p>The exchanges are quoted in legal documents made public last month in a defamation lawsuit brought by Smartmatic, a voting technology company, against Fox News. Pirro is named as a defendant.</p>   <p>As the U.S. attorney for the District of Columbia, Pirro is the public face of Trump's crackdown on crime in the district, with armed troops and federal law enforcement officers patrolling neighborhoods.</p>   
   <p>"At some point in the near future, she's going to be really tested â€” like all U.S. attorneys with these kinds of big posts are," says Sarah Isgur, an attorney who served as a senior official in the U.S. Justice Department during President Trump's first term. "And we'll find out whether those comments were prescient or whether she really does understand the difference between the two hats."</p>   <p>Pirro, in a chance encounter aboard an Amtrak train, declined to comment for this story. Her Justice Department spokesperson, previously a Fox News producer who worked on her show for eight years, did not respond to written requests for comment.</p>   <div>

                In August 2005, Jeanine Pirro was serving as Westchester County district attorney when she announced on the steps of the New York State Capitol that she would try to unseat Democratic U.S. Sen. Hillary Clinton of New York.

   <h3>A law enforcement career revived after nearly two decadesÂ </h3>   <p>Before television, Pirro was a prosecutor, judge and political hopeful. In 2006, Pirro briefly sought to run against Hillary Clinton for a U.S. Senate seat representing New York. Pirro then withdrew to run, unsuccessfully, for New York attorney general.</p>   
   <p>Nearly two decades later, she has returned to law enforcement. In her new role, she has captured headlines and cable news coverage â€” not all of it flattering.</p>   <p>Since becoming the U.S. attorney for the District of Columbia, Pirro has made public announcements about the indictment of a Haitian gang leader, the D.C. homicide level reaching triple digits for the year and the takedown of an alleged fentanyl and PCP drug-trafficking crew. Last month, Pirro told prosecutors to seek the most serious charges available for people who had been arrested.</p>   <p>Yet not all those charges are sticking.</p>   <div>

I work so hard for the President and party."</p>   <p>By November 2020, Fox's controlling owner, Rupert Murdoch, and network executives were walking a razor's edge.</p>   
   <p>On election night, Fox's voting-projection team concluded that Joe Biden had clinched Arizona. The network aired that call before any other major news outlet. That infuriated Trump's fans.

                Chris Wallace, then a Fox News anchor, is displayed on a monitor during an election night party on Wednesday, Nov. 4, 2020, in the White House's East Room. President TrumpÂ falsely declared early that Wednesday that he had won reelection againstÂ Joe BidenÂ and said he would ask the Supreme Court to intervene, even as several battleground states continued to count votes.

   <p>Both Fox and Smartmatic have each submitted lengthy court filings arguing why the judge should rule in its favor before trial. These filings include collections of what each asserts to be undisputed facts, including quotations from conversations, text messages and depositions from Fox News hosts and executives.</p>   <p>The <a href="https://iapps.courts.state.ny.us/fbem/DocumentDisplayServlet?documentId=olzwemuCPi6hRO6vLFAOVQ==&amp;system=prod" target="_blank">legal documents Smartmatic filed</a> indicate that network executives privately agreed that Trump had lost. But as the network rushed to stem the bleeding, Pirro became one of the most prominent Fox stars to embrace and amplify Trump's repeated claims that he had been cheated of victory, even as evidence publicly amassed that this was untrue.</p>   <h3>A complicated lawsuitÂ </h3>   <p>Fox declined comment for this story.</p>   <p>Its executives have testified in sworn depositions that they had no concerns about what Pirro said on the air and considered her a source of reliable information. They assert Pirro took steps to investigate the claims and was careful to feature the denials she was aware of. The network's legal team notes that Pirro had couched things as allegations.</p>   <p>Fox argues that its journalists didn't know that the allegations were false. And therefore, its lawyers say, the network shouldn't be held liable for defamation, giving no credence to Smartmatic's arguments about the concerns of producers and executives.</p>   
   <p>Fundamentally, Fox's legal team asserts the network was reporting on newsworthy claims by the president and his allies, a journalistic endeavor that it argues is protected by the First Amendment. The allegations were "an issue that was pretty much splattered across newspapers across the country," Pirro said in a December 2023 deposition.</p>   <p>In filings for its defense, Fox says Smartmatic cannot prove its libel claims or that it was financially harmed.</p>   <p>The network also points to Smartmatic's own legal troubles: The Department of Justice (DOJ) recently <a href="https://www.npr.org/2024/08/09/nx-s1-5069756/smartmatic-alleged-bribery-scheme-elections-philippines" target="_blank">charged Smartmatic executives with involvement in a bribery scheme</a> in the Philippines. Prosecutors also have raised questions about how Smartmatic spent money from its Los Angeles County contract.</p>   <p>Smartmatic told NPR that it operates ethically and in full compliance with the law wherever it does business, adding: "The allegations in the DOJ's filing are full of misrepresentations."</p>   <h3>"I don't trust her to be responsible tomorrow"</h3>   <p>On Nov. 6, 2020, ahead of Pirro's regularly scheduled Saturday show the next day, Fox News' senior vice president for weekend programming, David Clark, texted Meade Cooper, the executive vice president over prime time, with a grim assessment. "Bottom line, I don't trust her to be responsible tomorrow. Her guests are all going to say the election is being stolen and if she pushes back at all it will just be a token," he wrote.</p>   
   <p>Cooper replied: "Maybe she does not have a show tomorrow night.'</p>   <p>"Honestly," Clark wrote back, "that would be the wisest course of action."</p>   <p>The network canceled Pirro's show for that Saturday; at the time, it told NPR and other outlets that her program was simply preempted for standard election coverage.</p>   <p>Fox had done the same at least once before: In 2019, the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/16/business/media/jeanine-pirro-fox-news-muslim.html" target="_blank">network took Pirro off the air</a> after she had attacked U.S. Rep. Ilhan Omar for wearing a hijab, suggesting the Minnesota Democrat, who is Muslim, was committed to sharia law.</p>   
   <p>This time, however, Pirro privately complained to Fox star Sean Hannity of censorship. And conservative news outlets reported she had been silenced for supporting Trump, much to the dismay of executives, internal exchanges reproduced in court filings show.</p>   <p>Hannity, who had talked to Fox News CEO Suzanne Scott, is quoted in the court documents as texting Pirro that she'd be fine: "You can come on and let it rip."</p>   <h3>A weakness for "random conspiracy theories on weird internet sites"</h3>   <p>Even after Trump administration officials responsible for the integrity of the election process said they had found no appreciable voting fraud, Pirro kept at it, executives said.</p>   <p>On Nov. 13, Fox Corp. Executive Chairman Lachlan Murdoch texted Scott, concerned about the backlash over the question of her show being pulled the previous week. "Has anyone spoken to Judge Jeanine before her show this weekend?" he asked, according to Smartmatic's filing. "It would be good if she corrects the record and clears up the schedule change last week."</p>   <p>Scott told top executives to promote Pirro on the network's major shows and website, Smartmatic's legal filing says. "I expect this to be handled well," she wrote. The network's top communications executive confirmed that the promotions for Pirro were airing and posted online too.</p>   <p>Even so, according to Smartmatic's filing, prime-time executive Cooper warned Scott: "Pirro has a tendency to find random conspiracy theories on weird internet sites." The filing says she assigned a manager and a consultant to work with Pirro to keep her "from saying untrue things... etc."</p>   <p>Pirro hosted her weekly show the next day and again the next week. Executives flagged her scripts, which were frequently contradicted by research from Fox's "Brainroom," to one another, according to Smartmatic's filing.</p>   <p>"It's rife w[ith] conspiracy theories and bs and is yet another example of why this woman should never be on live television," Fox News executive Jerry Andrews wrote to two other executives on Nov. 20, Smartmatic's filing says.</p>   
   <p>The next day, Pirro opened her show by discussing two voting technology companies. The first was Dominion, which would <a href="https://www.npr.org/2023/04/18/1170339114/fox-news-settles-blockbuster-defamation-lawsuit-with-dominion-voting-systems" target="_blank">settle a defamation case against Fox</a> in 2023 for $787.5 million. The second, Smartmatic, had only a single contract in 2020 where its technology was used: in heavily Democratic Los Angeles County, which no one doubted would go for Biden.</p>   
   <p>"The president's lawyers [are] alleging a company called Dominion, which they say started in Venezuela with Cuban money, and with the assistance of Smartmatic software, a back door is capable of flipping votes," <a href="https://www.facebook.com/watch/?v=3424348634350374" target="_blank">Pirro told viewers</a>. (Dominion did not start in Venezuela, and no one has shown that it has a means of flipping votes.)</p>   <p>Immediately following the 2020 race, Trump and his allies, led by attorneys Sidney Powell and Rudy Giuliani, claimed that Dominion and Smartmatic had colluded with the Biden campaign to throw the election.</p>   <p>Dominion had already been blanketing the network with denials, and Fox News researchers had dismissed Giuliani as an unreliable source.</p>   <p>(Both lawyers have since faced serious consequences for their claims, including financial penalties and legal sanctions. Giuliani was subsequently disbarred in <a href="https://www.nycourts.gov/courts/ad1/calendar/List_Word/2024/07_Jul/02/PDF/Matter%20of%20Giuliani%20(2021-00506).pdf" target="_blank">New York state</a> and the <a href="https://www.dccourts.gov/sites/default/files/2024-09/In%20re%20Giuliani%20%2021-BG-0423.pdf" target="_blank">District of Columbia</a>.)</p>   <p>But Pirro said Giuliani "made clear the Democrat cities were targeted by crooked Democrats who stole votes." These were cities comfortable with corruption, like Pittsburgh and Detroit, she said. And she said there was legal documentation:</p>   <p>"The president's lawyers offered evidence by way of affidavits, which I told you last Saturday as a judge, from a legal perspective, are sworn statements of individuals signed under penalty of perjury," Pirro told viewers, "meaning they know they face the penalty of prosecution and five years if they lie."</p>   <p>Testifying under oath in a later deposition, Pirro indicated that she had been referring to a declaration submitted in a lawsuit brought by a pro-Trump lawyer against Georgia's secretary of state.</p>   
   <p>She acknowledged under questioning that it was not signed and that she did not know the identity of the person making the declaration, as his or her identity had been withheld from the public, according to Smartmatic's legal filing.</p>   <p>In the weeks after Election Day, Dominion sent a barrage of messages to Fox's executives and journalists flagging the false claims in the allegations being relayed â€” thousands of emails and warnings in all.</p>   <p>In dozens of court hearings and reviews by state and local election officials, none of the claims by the Trump teams was found to have merit.</p>   <p>Smartmatic's filing says that via text message, Fox executive Andrews told Pirro that if she brought up the issue again, she must include Dominion's denials. She replied by saying she would follow the lead of Fox stars Hannity, Tucker Carlson and Lou Dobbs. (Dobbs lost his job after Smartmatic filed its lawsuit.)</p>   <p>"Reckless maniac," Andrews later wrote to a colleague, Smartmatic's filing says. He was referring to Pirro.</p>   <h3>An "insane" invocation of KristallnachtÂ </h3>   <p>Pirro would go on to be a leading voice on Fox urging a mass turnout on the National Mall on Jan. 6, 2021, the day that the U.S. Congress was to ceremonially certify Biden's election victory.</p>   <p>On Jan. 3, Pirro <a href="https://archive.org/details/FOXNEWSW_20210103_080000_Justice_With_Judge_Jeanine/start/438/end/540" target="_blank">compared</a> those gathering to protest in Washington with Trump to the American soldiers in the Revolutionary War, adding, "Jan. 6 will tell us whether there are any in Congress willing to battle for the America that those soldiers fought for."</p>   <p>After protesters participated in a bloody siege of the Capitol, Pirro called for the most violent to be prosecuted. But she called the deplatforming of Parler, a far-right site that had hosted content calling for violence that day, akin to Kristallnacht â€” a night of violent rampages by Nazis against Jews in 1938.</p>   <p>Smartmatic's filing says Fox Corp. corporate board member Anne Dias texted another board member â€” former U.S. House Speaker Paul Ryan â€” calling Pirro's Kristallnacht remark "insane." The two directors urged the Murdochs to have the network and its stars make a public stand against Trump and his claims.</p>   
   <p>Days after the Dominion lawsuit settled in the spring of 2023, Fox forced out Tucker Carlson; the network also settled a case brought by a former producer who alleged an abusive workplace and that Fox was pressuring her to lie in the Dominion case.</p>   <div>

   <p>Despite the internal misgivings about Pirro, Fox promoted her in 2022 from weekend host to full-time host of <em>The Five</em>, usually Fox's highest-rated show â€” where she stayed, and starred, until Trump picked her as the top federal prosecutor in the nation's capital.</p>   <p>Lachlan Murdoch, Fox Corp.'s executive chairman and CEO, <a href="https://www.adweek.com/tvnewser/lachlan-murdoch-addresses-dominion-lawsuit-settlement-risk-and-fox-news-primetime-on-earnings-call/#:~:text=The%20Delaware%20Superior%20Court%20Judge,strength%20of%20the%20advertising%20demand.%E2%80%9D" target="_blank">has told investment analysts</a> that the network will fare better against Smartmatic in court than it did against Dominion. The case is before a different judge in a different jurisdiction â€” in this case, New York state court in Manhattan.</p>

</div><div>
    <p>JUANA SUMMERS, HOST: </p><p> The justices of the U.S. Supreme Court aren't scheduled to meet with each other face-to-face until the end of this month, but already, there's a legal truckload of Trump administration appeals that the court will almost certainly have to decide this term, and each day seems to bring another blockbuster. NPR's legal affairs correspondent, Nina Totenberg is here in the studio with more. Hi.</p><p>NINA TOTENBERG, BYLINE: Hi there.</p><p>SUMMERS: So Nina, it's been nine months of the Trump administration, and it's an administration that has seen a number of legal challenges. What might we expect from the court this term?</p><p>TOTENBERG: You know, whatever I tell you this evening will be superseded or added to tomorrow or the next day. And that's because the Supreme Court, after dancing around most of the challenges to Trump executive orders, will soon face a bunch of cases that can't be avoided. They can't be - the can can't be kicked down the road. I say dancing around because the court, for the most part, until now, has blocked lower court decisions against Trump on a raft of issues. But these blocks, or stays, as they're called, are only temporary when the cases play out in the lower courts. But now, nearly a year into the second Trump administration, the lower courts - both district and appeals courts - have issued full-blown decisions in some of these cases - really big cases - and the court will have to deal with those lower court decisions on the merits, not on the question of a temporary stay.</p><p>SUMMERS: Got it. So tell us, Nina, what is the biggest case facing the Supreme Court at the moment?</p><p>TOTENBERG: Well, it depends a little bit on what floats your boat.</p><p>SUMMERS: (Laughter) OK.</p><p>TOTENBERG: (Laughter) In terms of the structure of modern government and the economy, it's probably two issues - tariffs and the Federal Reserve Board. First tariffs - this week, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit ruled by a 7 to 4 vote that the president exceeded his authority imposing tariffs worldwide with virtually no restraint. The circuit court stayed its ruling to allow Trump to appeal to the Supreme Court, and that means that we almost certainly will get a decision on Trump's tariff power this term.</p><p>SUMMERS: OK, so that was tariffs. What about the Federal Reserve Board?</p><p>TOTENBERG: Well, the court in recent months has all but formally overturned a nearly 100-year-old precedent that barred firing independent agency heads. But in one recent opinion, the court seemed to carve out an exception for the Federal Reserve Board members. Trump, who's made no secret of wanting to fire Jerome Powell, the head of the Fed, has now fired a different board member, Lisa Cook. She was appointed by President Biden, and her case is now kind of a test case. And that is making Trump allies in Congress and the business world very nervous because the Fed, since its creation in 1913, has been viewed as an apolitical, independent force for stability in the American economy, and all of this will undoubtedly come to a head in the coming months.</p><p>SUMMERS: Last thing, Nina, I understand that President Trump's use of the Alien Enemies Act is another major case that is likely to make its way to the court. Tell us about that one, if you can.</p><p>TOTENBERG: Yes, that's the law enacted in 1798 that allows the deportation of immigrants in times of foreign invasion. It's a law that until now has been used only three times, always in wartime - declared wartimes - including to round up Japanese Americans and put them in camps during World War II, an action that both Congress and the Supreme Court have since repudiated.</p><p>The Supreme Court earlier this year, rather than decide whether Trump's invocation of the Alien Enemies Act was legitimate, sent the case back to the very conservative 5th Circuit Court of Appeals to answer specific questions, among them, was Trump's action legal? And last night, a 5th Circuit panel found that Trump's use of the Alien Enemies Act to deport undocumented individuals was illegal. Writing for the panel majority, Judge Leslie Southwick, a Republican appointee, found that even a mass illegal immigration is not an armed and organized invasion of the kind contemplated by the Alien Enemies Act.</p><p>SUMMERS: Right.</p><p>TOTENBERG: There's also the deployment of the National Guard and Marines in California to handle protests against immigration enforcement activities. A federal judge ruled just a few days ago that the president didn't have the authority to do that...</p><p>SUMMERS: All right.</p><p>TOTENBERG: ...At least not without the consent of the state's governor, which he definitely didn't have.</p><p>SUMMERS: All right. We have to leave it there. We are out of time. NPR legal affairs correspondent Nina Totenberg, thank you.</p><p>TOTENBERG: Thank you.</p>
