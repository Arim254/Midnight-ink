   <p>President Trump will sign an executive order on Friday to give the Department of Defense a new name: the Department of War.</p>   <p>The change would return the department to a name that it carried for much of its history, until it became the Department of Defense in the wake of World War II. The executive order was confirmed to NPR by a White House official who was not authorized to discuss the matter.</p>   <p>A White House fact sheet explains that under the executive order, the name "Department of War" will serve as a "secondary title" for the Department of Defense. </p>   
   <p>According to the fact sheet, the order will also authorize Defense Department officials to substitute the word "war" into their titles. For example, the Secretary of Defense could use the title Secretary of War. </p>   <p>Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth appeared to acknowledge the change in <a href="https://x.com/PeteHegseth/status/1963727635143639327" target="_blank">a post</a> on social media on Thursday, writing simply, "DEPARTMENT OF WAR." </p>   <p>President Trump has previously signaled that a change was in the works. During an appearance in the Oval Office last month, <a href="https://rollcall.com/factbase/trump/transcript/donald-trump-remarks-proclamation-afghanistan-servicemembers-august-25-2025/" target="_blank">Trump said</a> that War Department "just sounded to me better."</p>   <p>It's not clear whether Trump can officially change the name without congressional action, but he told reporters, "We're just gonna do it."</p>   <p>"I'm sure Congress will go along if we need that. I don't think we even need that. But if we need that, I'm sure Congress will go along," Trump said.</p>   <p>Almost from the country's founding, the military was overseen by the War Department, but the sprawling agency took on its current name following an act of Congress<a href="https://www.trumanlibrary.gov/library/public-papers/177/statement-president-upon-signing-national-security-act-amendments-1949" target="_blank"> in 1949</a>. At the time, the change marked the culmination of an effort by President Harry Truman to unify the Air Force, Army and Navy under the umbrella of a single department.</p>   <p>As the largest department in the U.S. government, even just changing signs, seals and titles could prove costly. In 2023, an Army official told Congress that an effort to rename only nine Army bases would cost taxpayers <a href="https://www.militarytimes.com/news/your-military/2023/03/24/the-cost-to-rename-9-confederacy-honoring-army-bases-has-doubled/#:~:text=The%20cost%20to%20rename%209%20Confederacy%2Dhonoring%20Army%20bases%20has%20doubled,-By%20Karen%20Jowers&amp;text=The%20cost%20of%20renaming%20the,pay%20%2439%20million%2C%20said%20Lt" target="_blank">$39 million</a>.</p>

   <p>A little more than three weeks ago, President Trump placed the <a href="https://www.npr.org/2025/08/08/g-s1-81755/trump-dc-federal-policing-washington-dc" target="_blank">Washington, D.C., police under federal control</a> and put the National Guard on the city's streets to crush crime and "clean up" the nation's capital.</p>   <p>Although crime in D.C. was already in decline after spiking during the pandemic, the administration has cast the operation, which also includes a surge of federal law enforcement officers, as a major success.</p>   <p>"We've had some incredible results," Trump said last month while visiting law enforcement officers in southeast D.C. "It's like a different place. It's like a different city."</p>   
   <p>Trump, who travels in an armored limousine with a huge security detail, also said: "I feel very safe now."</p>   <p>The White House said on Tuesday that 1,669 people have been arrested since the president's surge of federal officers into the nation's capital began on Aug. 7. A sizeable chunk of those arrests are for immigration-related offenses. </p>   <p>The administration has not provided the names or case numbers for any of the individuals who have been arrested or what they've been charged with on an individual basis, despite repeated NPR requests for such information.</p>   <p>NPR combed through court records and other data for the first two weeks of Trump's takeover of D.C. police — Aug. 11 to Aug. 25 — to get a better understanding of who has been swept up in the federal surge for non-immigration offenses and what charges they are facing.</p>   <h3>The situation in the nation's capital is unique.</h3>   <p>There is no local district attorney's office in Washington, D.C. Instead, federal prosecutors at the U.S. Attorney's Office handle both local and federal crimes. The D.C. Attorney General's Office, meanwhile, prosecutes juvenile crimes as well as certain adult misdemeanors for local crimes.</p>   <p>Prosecutions for local crimes go through the Superior Court of the District of Columbia, while federal cases land in U.S. District Court.</p>   
   <p>The vast majority of people arrested or formally charged over the Aug. 11 to Aug. 25 timeframe — nearly 1,100 defendants — saw their cases go through superior court.</p>   <p>Lawyers who work in the courthouse say they are swamped. The courtroom where defendants are arraigned has on some days been working past 1 a.m., which attorneys say is almost unheard of.</p>   
   <p>Of the more than 1,050 defendants whose cases have gone to superior court, prosecutors charged around 20% with felonies: more serious offenses that include drug and gun crimes.</p>   <p>The remaining 80% of the cases were either misdemeanors, warrants, traffic offenses or prosecutors dropping the case.</p>   <p>Attorneys say prosecutors decide not to pursue a case — a move known as "no papering" — for a range of reasons, including weak evidence, a questionable search or finding that the alleged offense is too minor to merit the time and expense of pursuing it.</p>   <p>The percentage of cases the U.S. Attorney's Office drops at this early stage varies, but in recent months it has been between 10% and 20%, according to lawyers who work in the courthouse.</p>   
   <p>In the first week of the federal takeover, prosecutors dropped around 17% of cases, according to records reviewed by NPR.</p>   <p>In the second week, that figure fell to less than 1%.</p>   <p>Defense attorneys say that shift is striking since the deficiencies that previously led the U.S. Attorney's Office to weed out certain cases have not suddenly stopped occurring.</p>   <h3>Federal cases</h3>   <p>At least 35 cases were filed and unsealed in federal court over the first two weeks of the takeover. More than half of those involved gun charges or gun and drug charges, according to an NPR analysis.</p>   <p>In one case, federal agents pulled a car over after the driver failed to use his turn signal, according to court papers. Officers allegedly found a loaded handgun, 143.5 grams of crack cocaine, plastic baggies and $900 in cash in the car.</p>   
   <p>The driver, Anthony Grant, had multiple prior convictions for drug and gun-related offenses. A judge has ordered him to remain in custody without bond.</p>   <p>The second most common charge among these cases is assaulting, resisting or impeding certain officers. Some of those cases involve violence. In one instance, court papers say the defendant struck a federal agent with his car while fleeing an attempted arrest at a gas station.</p>   <p>Several of these cases, however, involve contact with officers that falls far short of that.</p>   <p>One defendant, for example, Sean Charles Dunn, threw a sub sandwich at a federal agent, hitting the officer in the chest.</p>   <p>In another case, the defendant, Scott Pichon, allegedly spit on two South Carolina National Guard troops while riding past them on a scooter outside D.C.'s Union Station.     </p>   
   <h3>Questions of overreach</h3>   <p>Despite an aggressive push from law enforcement and prosecutors, some of the cases have unraveled before federal judges and grand juries.</p>   <p>Take the <a href="https://www.npr.org/2025/08/26/g-s1-85119/crime-washington-dc-judges-arrests" target="_blank">gun case against Torez Riley</a>. Police said in court papers that they found two firearms in Riley's crossbody satchel when they stopped him in a Trader Joe's grocery store. Riley had previously been convicted on weapons and drug charges, according to court papers.</p>   <p>At a hearing last week, U.S. Magistrate Judge Zia Faruqui said Riley appeared to have been singled out by the police because he was a Black man carrying a satchel that looked heavy.</p>   <p>"It is without a doubt the most illegal search I've even seen in my life," Faruqui said from the bench. "I'm absolutely flabbergasted at what has happened. A high school student would know this was an illegal search."</p>   <p>The U.S. Attorney's Office later filed papers to dismiss the case, which the judge granted.</p>   <p>Other cases have run into trouble with grand juries.</p>   
   <p>It is extremely rare for grand juries to reject charges proposed by prosecutors.</p>   <p>But on multiple occasions in recent weeks grand juries in D.C. have done exactly that, including in the case against the man who hurled a sandwich at a federal agent.</p>   <p>In that instance, prosecutors reduced the charge to a misdemeanor after failing to secure an indictment from the grand jury.<br /></p>   <p><em>NPR's Luke Garrett and Carrie Johnson contributed to this report. </em></p>

      <p>Missouri lawmakers meet to redraw their congressional districts so they're more favorable to Republican congressional candidates. It comes at the urging of President Trump.</p>   
</div><div>
    <p>JUANA SUMMERS, HOST: </p><p> Republican leaders in Missouri have now answered President Trump's call to redraw voting districts and help Republican candidates in next year's congressional elections. Usually, states do their redistricting early in the decade after the national census comes in. But this year, halfway through the decade, Texas Republicans have already approved a new map there. And today, Missouri lawmakers are discussing a plan that's expected to pass next week. St. Louis Public Radio's Jason Rosenbaum joins us from the Capitol in Jefferson City. Hey there.</p><p>JASON ROSENBAUM, BYLINE: Hey, Juana. Thank you for having me.</p><p>SUMMERS: Thanks for being here, Jason. Tell us what are they trying to do with districts there in Missouri?</p><p>ROSENBAUM: So right now, Missouri has six Republican-leaning districts and two heavily Democratic districts, and their delegation in the House consists of six Republicans and two Democrats. Republican Governor Mike Kehoe wants lawmakers to convert Democratic Congressman Emanuel Cleaver's district, which takes in most of Kansas City, into a much more GOP-leaning seat. Republicans say this is fair game in politics. In fact, I spoke with GOP State Representative Bill Hardwick, who told me his voters in rural Pulaski County like Trump and want to see Republicans retain control of Congress. I talked with him before a public hearing today.</p><p>BILL HARDWICK: I think that partisan gerrymandering is not a threat to the republic. I think it's what's been happening since the republic was founded, essentially. I don't necessarily like - it's not that I - that's not what I think is ideal. I just think that it's hyperbolic to say that partisan gerrymandering is, like, the end of America.</p><p>ROSENBAUM: And this comes after Trump exerted direct pressure on the governor and Republican lawmakers to overhaul its map so that the GOP can maintain its slim hold over the U.S. House.</p><p>SUMMERS: Jason, I'd love to hear some of what you have been hearing from people that you've been talking to in the state in the last few days about this effort.</p><p>ROSENBAUM: Missouri Democratic voters have been absolutely irate over the push to redraw the state's congressional lines, and they contend that it's against the state constitution. And they also say that Republicans were content with the current map until Trump exerted pressure on them. They also say it dilutes the voting power of Black voters. Sharon Schneeberger came to the state Capitol from Columbia, which is about 30 miles away. She acknowledges that stopping the map from passing the legislature may not be possible, since Democrats are vastly outnumbered in the General Assembly, but she says it's important to speak out, especially since the current map already favors Republicans.</p><p>SHARON SCHNEEBERGER: I think the train is out of the station. But honestly, I feel like we all have to keep telling them that we care about our state and we care about what they do in Jefferson City. And all of us should be represented.</p><p>ROSENBAUM: And it should be noted that even some Republicans now concede that the map could backfire, since splitting up Democratic voters in Kansas City could make nearby Republican districts more competitive.</p><p>SUMMERS: Jason, this is part of a redistricting race that President Trump has set off across the country. Where do other states stand?</p><p>ROSENBAUM: Texas finished work on their map, which could net five seats for Republicans, and Florida and Indiana may also redraw their maps.</p><p>SUMMERS: Got it. Now, that's from the Republican side. How are Democrats countering?</p><p>ROSENBAUM: California Governor Gavin Newsom is backing a plan that would recraft his state's districts to basically counteract what Texas is doing. Illinois and Maryland Democrats haven't ruled out redrawing their maps, though their congressional districts are already skewed heavily against Republicans. The stakes are really high, since Trump needs a Republican Congress to support his agenda and avoid investigations of his administration that Democrats could launch if they take over the House.</p><p>SUMMERS: St. Louis Public Radio's Jason Rosenbaum, thank you.</p><p>ROSENBAUM: Thank you.</p><p>(SOUNDBITE OF KATZROAR'S "POMEGRANATE SEEDS")</p>

   <p>In a contentious Senate hearing marked by raised voices and heated exchanges, Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. faced calls to resign from Democrats and unexpected criticism from Republicans.</p>   <p>Several Republican senators brought up the legacy of President Donald Trump's Operation Warp Speed, which sent a safe COVID vaccine to the public in record time, helping save millions of lives. They pushed Kennedy to explain his current approach to the shots and mRNA technology.</p>   
   <p>Under his leadership, the health agency cancelled hundreds of millions of dollars in research funding on mRNA technology for future vaccines, and the Food and Drug Administration limited access to the COVID shots, saying only people at high risk of complications from COVID or those over 65.</p>   <p>"President Trump deserves a Nobel Prize for Operation Warp Speed," said Sen. Bill Cassidy, a Louisiana Republican and physician, whose vote was critical in Kennedy's confirmation. He demanded Kennedy explain his changing stance on COVID vaccines, and said: "effectively, we're denying people vaccine" — an assertion echoed by many physicians' groups including the American Association of Pediatrics and the American Medical Association.</p>   <p>Cassidy had exacted assurances from Kennedy during his confirmation process in February that he would not restrict Americans' access to vaccines, a promise the senator now accuses Kennedy of violating. Kennedy <a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/shots-health-news/2025/06/13/nx-s1-5429604/cdc-rfk-acip-vaccine-committee" target="_blank">fired the entire </a>17-member Advisory Panel on Immunization Practices at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, replacing them with members Cassidy argued are largely unscientific vaccine skeptics with vested financial interests in suing vaccine makers.</p>   
   <p>Another Republican physician on the Senate Finance Committee, Dr. John Barrasso of Wyoming, joined Democrats in criticizing Kennedy for undermining vaccines.</p>   <p>"In your confirmation hearings, you promised to uphold the highest standards for vaccines. Since then, I've grown deeply concerned," Barrasso told Kennedy at the hearing. "I've been hearing from many of my medical colleagues, and there are real concerns that safe, proven vaccines like measles, like hepatitis B and others, could be in jeopardy and that would put Americans at risk and reverse decades of progress."</p>   
   <p>He expressed concern that Kennedy could politicize vaccines further and undermine public health.</p>   <h3>CDC leadership change debated</h3>   <p>Kennedy hotly defended his decisions and statements on vaccines and on changes at the CDC, arguing the agencies have historically relied on bad data. </p>   
   <p>"These changes were absolutely necessary adjustments to restore the agency to its role as the world's gold standard public health agency," he said. He claimed he had the backing of "scientists and doctors are supporting me all across the country."</p>   <p>Senators also repeatedly asked Kennedy about his decision to push out newly confirmed CDC chief Susan Monarez. Though she was his own pick to lead the agency, he said Monarez was lying when she claimed she was fired from that job after only a month for <a href="https://www.wsj.com/opinion/robert-f-kennedy-jr-the-cdc-and-me-b4ca2eaa" target="_blank">insisting on rigorous scientific review.</a> </p>   <p>In response to questions from Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., Kennedy said: "I told her she had to resign because I asked her, 'Are you a trustworthy person?' And she said, 'No.'"</p>   <p>Trump administration allies like Republican Ron Johnson of Wisconsin rushed to his defense, calling the senators' pointed questions "abuse," and lauding Kennedy for his attempts to overhaul health agencies.</p>   <h3>Vaccine access arguments</h3>   <p>Kennedy's seven-and-a-half month tenure as Health Secretary is roiling the fields of science and health. His early sweeping changes included mass layoffs across the federal health and science agencies, from the FDA to the CDC to the National Institutes of Health.</p>   <p>Democratic senators took issue with these and other changes, as they and Kennedy accused each other of lying and manipulating data to serve political ends.</p>   <p>The committee's ranking Democratic member Sen. Ron Wyden criticized Kennedy's approach to vaccines: "I think Secretary Kennedy is dead set on making it harder for children to get vaccines and that kids are going to die because of it," he said.</p>   
   <p>Sen. Warren challenged Kennedy to "honor your promise that you made when you were looking to get confirmed" not to take away vaccines from people who want them. She said his recent moves <a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/shots-health-news/2025/08/27/nx-s1-5515503/fda-covid-vaccines-restricted" target="_blank">to change the classification of the COVID vaccine</a> do just that.</p>   <p>In response, Kennedy said "everybody can get access to them" for free, including those on Medicare and Medicaid, though the many contradictory statements have left many patients, doctors and insurers confused.</p>   <p>Kennedy said it was unclear the COVID vaccine had saved millions of lives — a data point generally accepted by scientists and doctors. But he also seemed to backtrack on assertions that he is "anti-vaccine," arguing that there remain some unknown risks, even with long-approved vaccines.</p>   <p><strong>"</strong>Saying I'm anti-vaccine is like saying I'm anti-medicine," Kennedy said, arguing he just wants more research to look into possible risks. "It doesn't mean that I'm, you know, anti-vax. It just means I'm pro-science."</p>   <p>His argument didn't appear to sway the Democratic senators in attendance, with several calling for Kennedy to resign throughout the hearing.</p>

   <p>When it was Secretary of State Marco Rubio's turn to speak during President Trump's recent marathon Cabinet meeting, he joked about his current employment status.</p>   <p>"For me personally, this is the most meaningful Labor Day of my life, as someone with four jobs," Rubio said to laughter. "It's true."</p>   <p>Rubio is currently serving as secretary of state, acting national security adviser and acting archivist of the United States. Late last week, he handed off his fourth job — acting director of the U.S. Agency for International Development — to another administration official, who already had two other jobs himself.</p>

   </div>
   <p>President Trump has a pattern of giving people in his administration multiple very big jobs. There are now at least a dozen administration officials serving in two jobs or more.</p>   <p>There's Treasury Secretary/acting IRS Commissioner Scott Bessent; the Health and Human Services deputy secretary who is now also interim director for the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Jim O'Neill; Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy, who is now also the acting NASA administrator; and U.S. Trade Representative Jamieson Greer, who's been put in charge of the Office of Special Counsel.</p>   <p>"This is no way to run anything and certainly not a way to run our government," said Max Stier, who leads the Partnership for Public Service, which exists to promote best practices in government.</p>   <p>Stier is beside himself with all the double- and triple-hatting in the second Trump administration. He says this is like asking "a single player to be able to play your center and your point guard on your basketball team at the same time."</p>   <h3>'There's not enough time in the day'</h3>   <p>In most cases, the jobs opened up when Trump fired the person who previously held it. And then, instead of having someone at that agency ascend to an interim leadership role, Trump chose a Senate-confirmed loyalist — often from a completely unrelated agency. Trump is fully within the law in doing this, but he is an outlier among presidents for operating this way.</p>   
   <p>"Other presidents don't tend to do this," said Kathryn Dunn Tenpas, who tracks White House staffing at the Brookings Institution.</p>   <p>She's done many oral history interviews with officials from other administrations, all of whom talked about how absolutely overwhelming their jobs were. And they only had one.</p>   <p>"The notion that somebody could have multiple jobs in a White House is simply beyond the pale," said Tenpas. "There's not enough time in the day."</p>   <p>The White House defends the practice, saying Trump has assembled a talented team.</p>   <p>"Some officials hold multiple roles, which allows for greater communication and collaboration across the administration," said Anna Kelly, a White House spokesperson, in a statement to NPR. "The results of the President's first seven months back in office speak to his exceptional leadership and the capacity of his team to execute all of the American people's priorities — inflation has cooled, the border is secure, our country is strong, and the best is yet to come!"</p>   <p> Loading... </p>
   <h3><strong>The heavy-hatters</strong></h3>   <p>Among the many officials with multiple hats, three stand out for their extra-full plates.</p>   <p>One of them is former Ambassador to Germany Richard Grenell, who sat at Trump's side during his visit to California in late January to survey the wildfire damage. Trump asked Grenell to oversee the federal response to the California fires.</p>   <p>Days later, Grenell flew to Venezuela to secure the release of six detained U.S. citizens, in his role as Trump's special missions envoy. Less than two weeks later, Trump gave Grenell a third job as interim executive director of the Kennedy Center, the performing arts center in Washington, D.C.</p>   <p>"Everything Ric ever touched has worked out," Trump said last month, praising a man who, in Trump's first term, also served in multiple overlapping roles.</p>   <p>Another standout is Rubio,<strong> </strong>who became acting national security adviser four months ago. At this point there is no apparent urgency to name a permanent replacement. Historically, there is only one other instance of someone serving as national security adviser and secretary of state simultaneously. That was Henry Kissinger in the Nixon administration.</p>   
   <p>"Secretary Rubio's role as national security adviser allows him to better understand the president's priorities and execute them across our foreign policy apparatus as secretary of state," said Kelly.</p>   
   <p>But those are both "more than full-time jobs," said Alexander Gray, who was chief of staff for the National Security Council in the first Trump administration.</p>   <p>He said Rubio is successfully navigating his dual roles of secretary of state and acting national security adviser, by running the National Security Council the way the president wants it run, with Trump and his foreign policy instincts taking the lead.</p>   <p>"If you don't have delusions of grandeur about what the job is supposed to do, if you don't think you are a policy maker, you can do the job very effectively, even while doing other things," said Gray.</p>   <p>The other administration official with as many jobs as Rubio and Grenell is Russell Vought, the director of the Office of Management and Budget. He has also been acting director of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau since February. This dual-role setup also existed in Trump's first term, when OMB director Mick Mulvaney served as acting director of CFPB.</p>   <p>It's a semi-independent watchdog agency most Republicans have opposed since its inception.</p>   <p>"[Vought] actively wants to dismantle it," said Stier. "So that puts his hand on the tiller to make sure he can run it into the rocks. So, there, I think it says a lot about what they think of our government."</p>   
   <h3>Not an accident</h3>   <p>Vought also became acting director of USAID last week, with the express purpose of closing it down. USAID was created by former President John F. Kennedy and Congress to fight poverty and disease around the world, but the Trump White House argues it was wasting taxpayer dollars.</p>   <p>"A lot of people think it looks like a comedy skit where Marco Rubio is running every agency," said Richard Stern of the conservative Heritage Foundation. "I actually think this is a process of very carefully putting trusted people in a position to gain that knowledge, to then use it for the betterment of government efficiency."</p>   
   <p>Gray, who served in the first term, has another theory. He believes this is just Trump's management style, honed over a lifetime of running the Trump Organization.</p>   <p>"And in a family business like the Trump Organization, people wear multiple hats," said Gray, explaining that Trump took a similar approach to his first campaign and first term. Now, he said, it's "turbocharged."</p>   <p>"That's his comfort level," Gray said. "You find people who he's comfortable with, who he thinks do a great job and you just keep giving them more responsibility."</p>

   <p>When it was Secretary of State Marco Rubio's turn to speak during President Trump's recent marathon Cabinet meeting, he joked about his current employment status.</p>   <p>"For me personally, this is the most meaningful Labor Day of my life, as someone with four jobs," Rubio said to laughter. "It's true."</p>   <p>Rubio is currently serving as secretary of state, acting national security adviser and acting archivist of the United States. Late last week, he handed off his fourth job — acting director of the U.S. Agency for International Development — to another administration official, who already had two other jobs himself.</p>   
   <div>
            <blockquote><p>I joked with <a target="_blank" href="https://twitter.com/POTUS?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@POTUS</a> that I had four jobs.

   <p>President Trump has a pattern of giving people in his administration multiple very big jobs. There are now at least a dozen administration officials serving in two jobs or more.</p>   <p>There's Treasury Secretary/acting IRS Commissioner Scott Bessent; the Health and Human Services deputy secretary who is now also interim director for the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Jim O'Neill; Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy, who is now also the acting NASA administrator; and U.S. Trade Representative Jamieson Greer, who's been put in charge of the Office of Special Counsel.</p>   <p>"This is no way to run anything and certainly not a way to run our government," said Max Stier, who leads the Partnership for Public Service, which exists to promote best practices in government.</p>   <p>Stier is beside himself with all the double- and triple-hatting in the second Trump administration. He says this is like asking "a single player to be able to play your center and your point guard on your basketball team at the same time."</p>   <h3>'There's not enough time in the day'</h3>   <p>In most cases, the jobs opened up when Trump fired the person who previously held it. And then, instead of having someone at that agency ascend to an interim leadership role, Trump chose a Senate-confirmed loyalist — often from a completely unrelated agency. Trump is fully within the law in doing this, but he is an outlier among presidents for operating this way.</p>   
   <p>"Other presidents don't tend to do this," said Kathryn Dunn Tenpas, who tracks White House staffing at the Brookings Institution.</p>   <p>She's done many oral history interviews with officials from other administrations, all of whom talked about how absolutely overwhelming their jobs were. And they only had one.</p>   <p>"The notion that somebody could have multiple jobs in a White House is simply beyond the pale," said Tenpas. "There's not enough time in the day."</p>   <p>The White House defends the practice, saying Trump has assembled a talented team.</p>   <p>"Some officials hold multiple roles, which allows for greater communication and collaboration across the administration," said Anna Kelly, a White House spokesperson, in a statement to NPR. "The results of the President's first seven months back in office speak to his exceptional leadership and the capacity of his team to execute all of the American people's priorities — inflation has cooled, the border is secure, our country is strong, and the best is yet to come!"</p>   <p> Loading... </p>
   <h3><strong>The heavy-hatters</strong></h3>   <p>Among the many officials with multiple hats, three stand out for their extra-full plates.</p>   <p>One of them is former Ambassador to Germany Richard Grenell, who sat at Trump's side during his visit to California in late January to survey the wildfire damage. Trump asked Grenell to oversee the federal response to the California fires.</p>   <p>Days later, Grenell flew to Venezuela to secure the release of six detained U.S. citizens, in his role as Trump's special missions envoy. Less than two weeks later, Trump gave Grenell a third job as interim executive director of the Kennedy Center, the performing arts center in Washington, D.C.</p>   <p>"Everything Ric ever touched has worked out," Trump said last month, praising a man who, in Trump's first term, also served in multiple overlapping roles.</p>   <p>Another standout is Rubio,<strong> </strong>who became acting national security adviser four months ago. At this point there is no apparent urgency to name a permanent replacement. Historically, there is only one other instance of someone serving as national security adviser and secretary of state simultaneously. That was Henry Kissinger in the Nixon administration.</p>   
   <p>"Secretary Rubio's role as national security adviser allows him to better understand the president's priorities and execute them across our foreign policy apparatus as secretary of state," said Kelly.</p>   
   <p>But those are both "more than full-time jobs," said Alexander Gray, who was chief of staff for the National Security Council in the first Trump administration.</p>   <p>He said Rubio is successfully navigating his dual roles of secretary of state and acting national security adviser, by running the National Security Council the way the president wants it run, with Trump and his foreign policy instincts taking the lead.</p>   <p>"If you don't have delusions of grandeur about what the job is supposed to do, if you don't think you are a policy maker, you can do the job very effectively, even while doing other things," said Gray.</p>   <p>The other administration official with as many jobs as Rubio and Grenell is Russell Vought, the director of the Office of Management and Budget. He has also been acting director of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau since February. This dual-role setup also existed in Trump's first term, when OMB director Mick Mulvaney served as acting director of CFPB.</p>   <p>It's a semi-independent watchdog agency most Republicans have opposed since its inception.</p>   <p>"[Vought] actively wants to dismantle it," said Stier. "So that puts his hand on the tiller to make sure he can run it into the rocks. So, there, I think it says a lot about what they think of our government."</p>   
   <h3>Not an accident</h3>   <p>Vought also became acting director of USAID last week, with the express purpose of closing it down. USAID was created by former President John F. Kennedy and Congress to fight poverty and disease around the world, but the Trump White House argues it was wasting taxpayer dollars.</p>   <p>"A lot of people think it looks like a comedy skit where Marco Rubio is running every agency," said Richard Stern of the conservative Heritage Foundation. "I actually think this is a process of very carefully putting trusted people in a position to gain that knowledge, to then use it for the betterment of government efficiency."</p>   
   <p>Gray, who served in the first term, has another theory. He believes this is just Trump's management style, honed over a lifetime of running the Trump Organization.</p>   <p>"And in a family business like the Trump Organization, people wear multiple hats," said Gray, explaining that Trump took a similar approach to his first campaign and first term. Now, he said, it's "turbocharged."</p>   <p>"That's his comfort level," Gray said. "You find people who he's comfortable with, who he thinks do a great job and you just keep giving them more responsibility."</p>

   <p>President Trump will sign an executive order on Friday to give the Department of Defense a new name: the Department of War.</p>   <p>The change would return the department to a name that it carried for much of its history, until it became the Department of Defense in the wake of World War II. The executive order was confirmed to NPR by a White House official who was not authorized to discuss the matter.</p>   <p>A White House fact sheet explains that under the executive order, the name "Department of War" will serve as a "secondary title" for the Department of Defense. </p>   
   <p>According to the fact sheet, the order will also authorize Defense Department officials to substitute the word "war" into their titles. For example, the Secretary of Defense could use the title Secretary of War. </p>   <p>Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth appeared to acknowledge the change in <a href="https://x.com/PeteHegseth/status/1963727635143639327" target="_blank">a post</a> on social media on Thursday, writing simply, "DEPARTMENT OF WAR." </p>   <p>President Trump has previously signaled that a change was in the works. During an appearance in the Oval Office last month, <a href="https://rollcall.com/factbase/trump/transcript/donald-trump-remarks-proclamation-afghanistan-servicemembers-august-25-2025/" target="_blank">Trump said</a> that War Department "just sounded to me better."</p>   <p>It's not clear whether Trump can officially change the name without congressional action, but he told reporters, "We're just gonna do it."</p>   <p>"I'm sure Congress will go along if we need that. I don't think we even need that. But if we need that, I'm sure Congress will go along," Trump said.</p>   <p>Almost from the country's founding, the military was overseen by the War Department, but the sprawling agency took on its current name following an act of Congress<a href="https://www.trumanlibrary.gov/library/public-papers/177/statement-president-upon-signing-national-security-act-amendments-1949" target="_blank"> in 1949</a>.

   <p>A little more than three weeks ago, President Trump placed the <a href="https://www.npr.org/2025/08/08/g-s1-81755/trump-dc-federal-policing-washington-dc" target="_blank">Washington, D.C., police under federal control</a> and put the National Guard on the city's streets to crush crime and "clean up" the nation's capital.</p>   <p>Although crime in D.C. was already in decline after spiking during the pandemic, the administration has cast the operation, which also includes a surge of federal law enforcement officers, as a major success.</p>   <p>"We've had some incredible results," Trump said last month while visiting law enforcement officers in southeast D.C. "It's like a different place. It's like a different city."</p>   
   <p>Trump, who travels in an armored limousine with a huge security detail, also said: "I feel very safe now."</p>   <p>The White House said on Tuesday that 1,669 people have been arrested since the president's surge of federal officers into the nation's capital began on Aug. 7. A sizeable chunk of those arrests are for immigration-related offenses. </p>   <p>The administration has not provided the names or case numbers for any of the individuals who have been arrested or what they've been charged with on an individual basis, despite repeated NPR requests for such information.</p>   <p>NPR combed through court records and other data for the first two weeks of Trump's takeover of D.C. police — Aug. 11 to Aug. 25 — to get a better understanding of who has been swept up in the federal surge for non-immigration offenses and what charges they are facing.</p>   <h3>The situation in the nation's capital is unique.</h3>   <p>There is no local district attorney's office in Washington, D.C. Instead, federal prosecutors at the U.S. Attorney's Office handle both local and federal crimes. The D.C. Attorney General's Office, meanwhile, prosecutes juvenile crimes as well as certain adult misdemeanors for local crimes.</p>   <p>Prosecutions for local crimes go through the Superior Court of the District of Columbia, while federal cases land in U.S. District Court.</p>   
   <p>The vast majority of people arrested or formally charged over the Aug. 11 to Aug. 25 timeframe — nearly 1,100 defendants — saw their cases go through superior court.</p>   <p>Lawyers who work in the courthouse say they are swamped. The courtroom where defendants are arraigned has on some days been working past 1 a.m., which attorneys say is almost unheard of.</p>   
   <p>Of the more than 1,050 defendants whose cases have gone to superior court, prosecutors charged around 20% with felonies: more serious offenses that include drug and gun crimes.</p>   <p>The remaining 80% of the cases were either misdemeanors, warrants, traffic offenses or prosecutors dropping the case.</p>   <p>Attorneys say prosecutors decide not to pursue a case — a move known as "no papering" — for a range of reasons, including weak evidence, a questionable search or finding that the alleged offense is too minor to merit the time and expense of pursuing it.</p>   <p>The percentage of cases the U.S. Attorney's Office drops at this early stage varies, but in recent months it has been between 10% and 20%, according to lawyers who work in the courthouse.</p>   
   <p>In the first week of the federal takeover, prosecutors dropped around 17% of cases, according to records reviewed by NPR.</p>   <p>In the second week, that figure fell to less than 1%.</p>   <p>Defense attorneys say that shift is striking since the deficiencies that previously led the U.S. Attorney's Office to weed out certain cases have not suddenly stopped occurring.</p>   <h3>Federal cases</h3>   <p>At least 35 cases were filed and unsealed in federal court over the first two weeks of the takeover. More than half of those involved gun charges or gun and drug charges, according to an NPR analysis.</p>   <p>In one case, federal agents pulled a car over after the driver failed to use his turn signal, according to court papers. Officers allegedly found a loaded handgun, 143.5 grams of crack cocaine, plastic baggies and $900 in cash in the car.</p>   
   <p>The driver, Anthony Grant, had multiple prior convictions for drug and gun-related offenses. A judge has ordered him to remain in custody without bond.</p>   <p>The second most common charge among these cases is assaulting, resisting or impeding certain officers. Some of those cases involve violence. In one instance, court papers say the defendant struck a federal agent with his car while fleeing an attempted arrest at a gas station.</p>   <p>Several of these cases, however, involve contact with officers that falls far short of that.</p>   <p>One defendant, for example, Sean Charles Dunn, threw a sub sandwich at a federal agent, hitting the officer in the chest.</p>   <p>In another case, the defendant, Scott Pichon, allegedly spit on two South Carolina National Guard troops while riding past them on a scooter outside D.C.'s Union Station.     </p>   
   <h3>Questions of overreach</h3>   <p>Despite an aggressive push from law enforcement and prosecutors, some of the cases have unraveled before federal judges and grand juries.</p>   <p>Take the <a href="https://www.npr.org/2025/08/26/g-s1-85119/crime-washington-dc-judges-arrests" target="_blank">gun case against Torez Riley</a>. Police said in court papers that they found two firearms in Riley's crossbody satchel when they stopped him in a Trader Joe's grocery store. Riley had previously been convicted on weapons and drug charges, according to court papers.</p>   <p>At a hearing last week, U.S. Magistrate Judge Zia Faruqui said Riley appeared to have been singled out by the police because he was a Black man carrying a satchel that looked heavy.</p>   <p>"It is without a doubt the most illegal search I've even seen in my life," Faruqui said from the bench. "I'm absolutely flabbergasted at what has happened. A high school student would know this was an illegal search."</p>   <p>The U.S. Attorney's Office later filed papers to dismiss the case, which the judge granted.</p>   <p>Other cases have run into trouble with grand juries.</p>   
   <p>It is extremely rare for grand juries to reject charges proposed by prosecutors.</p>   <p>But on multiple occasions in recent weeks grand juries in D.C. have done exactly that, including in the case against the man who hurled a sandwich at a federal agent.</p>   <p>In that instance, prosecutors reduced the charge to a misdemeanor after failing to secure an indictment from the grand jury.<br /></p>   <p><em>NPR's Luke Garrett and Carrie Johnson contributed to this report. </em></p>

      <p>Missouri lawmakers meet to redraw their congressional districts so they're more favorable to Republican congressional candidates. It comes at the urging of President Trump.</p>   
</div><div>
    <p>JUANA SUMMERS, HOST: </p><p> Republican leaders in Missouri have now answered President Trump's call to redraw voting districts and help Republican candidates in next year's congressional elections. Usually, states do their redistricting early in the decade after the national census comes in. But this year, halfway through the decade, Texas Republicans have already approved a new map there. And today, Missouri lawmakers are discussing a plan that's expected to pass next week. St. Louis Public Radio's Jason Rosenbaum joins us from the Capitol in Jefferson City. Hey there.</p><p>JASON ROSENBAUM, BYLINE: Hey, Juana. Thank you for having me.</p><p>SUMMERS: Thanks for being here, Jason. Tell us what are they trying to do with districts there in Missouri?</p><p>ROSENBAUM: So right now, Missouri has six Republican-leaning districts and two heavily Democratic districts, and their delegation in the House consists of six Republicans and two Democrats. Republican Governor Mike Kehoe wants lawmakers to convert Democratic Congressman Emanuel Cleaver's district, which takes in most of Kansas City, into a much more GOP-leaning seat. Republicans say this is fair game in politics. In fact, I spoke with GOP State Representative Bill Hardwick, who told me his voters in rural Pulaski County like Trump and want to see Republicans retain control of Congress. I talked with him before a public hearing today.</p><p>BILL HARDWICK: I think that partisan gerrymandering is not a threat to the republic. I think it's what's been happening since the republic was founded, essentially. I don't necessarily like - it's not that I - that's not what I think is ideal. I just think that it's hyperbolic to say that partisan gerrymandering is, like, the end of America.</p><p>ROSENBAUM: And this comes after Trump exerted direct pressure on the governor and Republican lawmakers to overhaul its map so that the GOP can maintain its slim hold over the U.S. House.</p><p>SUMMERS: Jason, I'd love to hear some of what you have been hearing from people that you've been talking to in the state in the last few days about this effort.</p><p>ROSENBAUM: Missouri Democratic voters have been absolutely irate over the push to redraw the state's congressional lines, and they contend that it's against the state constitution. And they also say that Republicans were content with the current map until Trump exerted pressure on them. They also say it dilutes the voting power of Black voters. Sharon Schneeberger came to the state Capitol from Columbia, which is about 30 miles away. She acknowledges that stopping the map from passing the legislature may not be possible, since Democrats are vastly outnumbered in the General Assembly, but she says it's important to speak out, especially since the current map already favors Republicans.</p><p>SHARON SCHNEEBERGER: I think the train is out of the station. But honestly, I feel like we all have to keep telling them that we care about our state and we care about what they do in Jefferson City. And all of us should be represented.</p><p>ROSENBAUM: And it should be noted that even some Republicans now concede that the map could backfire, since splitting up Democratic voters in Kansas City could make nearby Republican districts more competitive.</p><p>SUMMERS: Jason, this is part of a redistricting race that President Trump has set off across the country. Where do other states stand?</p><p>ROSENBAUM: Texas finished work on their map, which could net five seats for Republicans, and Florida and Indiana may also redraw their maps.</p><p>SUMMERS: Got it. Now, that's from the Republican side. How are Democrats countering?</p><p>ROSENBAUM: California Governor Gavin Newsom is backing a plan that would recraft his state's districts to basically counteract what Texas is doing. Illinois and Maryland Democrats haven't ruled out redrawing their maps, though their congressional districts are already skewed heavily against Republicans. The stakes are really high, since Trump needs a Republican Congress to support his agenda and avoid investigations of his administration that Democrats could launch if they take over the House.</p><p>SUMMERS: St. Louis Public Radio's Jason Rosenbaum, thank you.</p><p>ROSENBAUM: Thank you.</p><p>(SOUNDBITE OF KATZROAR'S "POMEGRANATE SEEDS")</p>
