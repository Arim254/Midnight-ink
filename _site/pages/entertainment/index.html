	Piers Morgan is bringing his “Uncensored” YouTube show to Paramount UK’s Channel 5 starting next week, the controversial TV personality announced on his X account on Friday. </p>
<p>
	In his post, Morgan said his show will be launching on Channel 5 on Sept. 12 at 11 p.m. and will “broadcast the week’s best ‘PMU’ moments each Friday night, teasing that there will be “rousing debates, big-impact interviews &amp; a hard dose of truth.”</p>
<figure></figure>
<p>
	“Uncensored” will continue being on YouTube, as the Channel 5 show essentially feature highlights that have already posted on the social media platform.  Morgan said “It’s the first time a YouTube news show has done this with a linear network.” 
	</p>
<p>
	Morgan was previously fired former employer ITV in 2021 following comments he made about Meghan, the Duchess of Sussex, on his breakfast show “Good Morning Britain.”</p>
<p>
	He <a target="_blank" href="https://variety.com/2025/tv/news/piers-morgan-no-wonder-stephen-colbert-canceled-1236471574/">recently commented on the cancellation</a> of “<a target="_blank" href="https://variety.com/t/the-late-show-with-stephen-colbert/">The Late Show With Stephen Colbert</a>,” arguing that most late-night hosts have become “hyper-partisan activist hacks” for the Left and that it’s really “no wonder” why Stephen Colbert was ousted from the network.</p>
<p>
	More to come. </p>

<p>
	The new studio will produce content across multiple platforms including theatrical releases, streaming services, commercial projects, gaming experiences and international collaborations. The announcement follows Devgn’s track record of investing in production companies, visual effects firms and his recent <a target="_blank" href="https://variety.com/2025/film/news/ajay-devgn-generative-ai-prismix-1236330979/">AI company Prismix</a>, which he launched alongside Danish Devgn.

</p>
<p>
	“We are building a creative ecosystem within LVS where original ideas are nurtured and new forms of storytelling are realised using world-class technology,” Ajay Devgn said. “Our goal is to set a new benchmark for Indian media on the global stage, an environment that empowers creators and leverages next-generation tools to bring stories to life at a scale never seen before.”</p>
<p>
	The company plans to focus heavily on animation, visual effects and artificial intelligence applications in content creation, with ambitions to position India as a major player in international production.</p>
<p>
	Danish Devgn, who brings producing and entrepreneurial experience to the role, outlined the studio’s creative philosophy.</p>
<p>
	“At LVS, originality is our currency and intelligence is our engine,” he said. “We build stories the way innovators build technology – scalable, adaptive, and timeless. From live-action and animation to immersive AR/VR worlds, our goal is to craft IP’s that resonate globally while staying deeply rooted and close to emotions.”
	</p>
<p>
	The studio’s development pipeline will span scripted series, documentaries, lifestyle programming, advertising content, interactive media and virtual reality projects.</p>

<p>
	Bieber included 23 songs on the new record, with guest appearances from Tems, Lil B, Bakar, Hurricane Chris and Eddie Benjamin. The album arrived after its promised release time of midnight, appearing first on <a href="https://music.youtube.com/playlist?list=OLAK5uy_nw1x_-4T3M8EcDwtVFko4s488OKq9oSK0" target="_blank">YouTube Music</a> before hitting other streaming services. On Instagram, Bieber addressed the delays in a series of posts, stating, “I’m sorry for the wait their telling me any second” and “Me waiting with u, not baiting u not sure wut the fuckkyyy is going on clicking refreshhhhhh.”
	</p>
<p>
	“Swag II” was teased early Thursday morning with billboards popping up in London and banners appearing in West Hollywood, much like he had done with the grassroots advertising of the album’s predecessor. He confirmed the album’s imminent arrival on Instagram, stating that the record would drop at midnight.
</p>
<p>
	Bieber has been posting photos from the studio over the past month or so, suggesting that he was hard at work on another project. He’d done the same with “Swag,” teasing that new music was potentially on the way. Hits Daily Double previously reported that “Swag” was a precursor to a second, more pop-oriented album expected to be released later this year. Presumably, “Swag II” is the record in question, serviced as an addendum to “Swag” and upping the total track count to 44 songs.</p>
<p>
	The first “Swag” clocked in at 21 tracks and featured guest appearances from Gunna, Sexyy Red, Druski, Dijon, Lil B, Cash Cobain, Eddie Benjamin and Marvin Winans. Bieber handled the production on “Swag” alongside contributions from Tobias Jesso Jr., Carter Lang, Dylan Wiggins, Daniel Caesar, mk.gee, Daniel Chetrit, Knox Fortune and more.
	</p>
<p>
	Upon release, “Swag” debuted at No. 2 on the Billboard 200 and marked his biggest streaming week yet. “Daisies” also bowed at No. 2 on the Billboard Hot 100, while “Yukon” peaked at No. 8 and “First Place” landed at No. 52.</p>

	<a target="_blank" href="https://variety.com/t/cambodia/">Cambodia</a> has submitted the psychological horror thriller “<a target="_blank" href="https://variety.com/t/tenement/">Tenement</a>,” co-directed by Inrasothythep Neth and Sokyou Chea, as its contender for best international feature at the 98th <a target="_blank" href="https://variety.com/t/academy-awards/">Academy Awards</a>.</p>
<p>
	The film is set within a decaying Khmer Rouge–era tenement in Phnom Penh. It follows Soriya (Thorn Thanet), a Cambodian-Japanese manga artist who returns home after her mother’s death and becomes trapped in a series of terrifying visions that blur the boundaries between the past and present.
	</p>
<p>
	“Tenement” world premiered in the Big Screen Competition at the International Film Festival Rotterdam in 2024 and has since screened at Osaka Asian Film Festival, Ho Chi Minh City International Film Festival, Seattle International Film Festival, Sitges International Fantastic Film Festival, Kaohsiung Film Festival, Luxembourg City Film Festival, Motel X and Horrorant’s Fright Nights, among others.
</p>
<p>
	Shot across Tokyo and Phnom Penh, production began in 2020 but was delayed for two years by the COVID-19 pandemic. The film employed Dolby Atmos sound design, a first for Cambodian cinema, and went on to win best production design at the 2024 Ho Chi Minh City International Film Festival.</p>
<p>
	The film is produced by Westec Media Limited and Kongchak Pictures. </p>
<p>
	International sales for “Tenement” are handled by Paris-based Reel Suspects.</p>
<p>
	This marks Cambodia’s latest attempt at the international feature Oscar. The country has previously submitted several films, with only Rithy Panh’s “The Missing Picture” in 2013 securing a nomination. In 2022, Davy Chou’s “Return to Seoul” made it to the shortlist. 
	</p>
<div><p>
	The Oscar international feature shortlist will be announced on Dec. 16 and the final five nominees will be announced on Jan. 22.</p></div>

	<a target="_blank" href="https://variety.com/t/warner-music/">Warner Music</a> India has inked a distribution agreement with <a target="_blank" href="https://variety.com/t/renzu-music/">Renzu Music</a>, providing the Kashmir-focused independent label with access to one of the country’s leading music distribution networks.</p>
<p>
	The partnership represents a major breakthrough for the Srinagar-based operation, which has built its reputation around discovering and developing talent from the Kashmir Valley. Under the leadership of filmmaker <a target="_blank" href="https://variety.com/t/danish-renzu/">Danish Renzu</a>, the label has carved out a niche by combining music curation with cinematic storytelling through music videos.
	</p>
<p>
	Warner’s distribution muscle will now support a roster that spans both established and emerging voices. The talent pipeline includes Zahra Banoo, Noor Mohammad, Hyder Dar, Adam, Saqib Wani, Shivani Matyal, Bilal Tantray, Afaq Dar, Kafil Qureshie, Tasneef Bukhari, and Masrat Un Nissa.
</p>
<p>
	Several high-profile fusion projects anchor the label’s current slate. Folk legend Noor Mohammad appears on multiple tracks, collaborating with Rashmeet Kaur on “Ranjha” and with Shikha Joshi on “Maryo.” IP Singh rounds out the featured releases with “Chingari.”</p>
<p>
	“Our goal was to bring music from Kashmir to a larger audience and create a bridge between Kashmir and the rest of the world,” said Danish Renzu. “The distribution partnership with Warner does exactly that—it helps the sounds of Kashmir travel across the globe. I’m grateful to Vaibhav [Nagpal, head of partner relations, acquisition and distribution at Warner Music India] for putting his faith in us and excited to see where this journey takes us. We have some exciting projects lined up to share with the world.”
	</p>
<p>
	The deal has attracted endorsements from entertainment industry figures who see cultural significance in the partnership. Actor Saba Azad noted the broader implications: “Kashmir is often in the news but there is little to nothing of its culture that makes it to the mainstream. I’m delighted Danish is bringing the music of the people of Kashmir to mainstream India and the world and that Warner has put their faith in his efforts.”</p>
<p>
	For the artists involved, the collaboration represents an opportunity to blend traditional and contemporary approaches. Shikha Joshi reflected on her experience: “Creating an Indian fusion that blended Kashmiri folk with contemporary elements was so enriching. It was lovely working alongside naturally gifted artists like Noor Mohammad ji whose authentic folk texture gave a truly unique sound.”</p>
<div><p>
	Actor Udit Arora, known for Netflix’s “The Royals” and a collaborator on one of the label’s Kashmiri tracks, emphasized the timing: “Music from Kashmir is beautiful and I’m glad that finally this music is getting its well-deserved platform. We want to focus on more success stories from the valley. It’s time.”</p></div>

	<a target="_blank" href="https://variety.com/t/warner-music/">Warner Music</a> India has inked a distribution agreement with <a target="_blank" href="https://variety.com/t/renzu-music/">Renzu Music</a>, providing the Kashmir-focused independent label with access to one of the country’s leading music distribution networks.</p>
<p>
	The partnership represents a major breakthrough for the Srinagar-based operation, which has built its reputation around discovering and developing talent from the Kashmir Valley. Under the leadership of filmmaker <a target="_blank" href="https://variety.com/t/danish-renzu/">Danish Renzu</a>, the label has carved out a niche by combining music curation with cinematic storytelling through music videos.
	</p>
<p>
	Warner’s distribution muscle will now support a roster that spans both established and emerging voices. The talent pipeline includes Zahra Banoo, Noor Mohammad, Hyder Dar, Adam, Saqib Wani, Shivani Matyal, Bilal Tantray, Afaq Dar, Kafil Qureshie, Tasneef Bukhari, and Masrat Un Nissa.
</p>
<p>
	Several high-profile fusion projects anchor the label’s current slate. Folk legend Noor Mohammad appears on multiple tracks, collaborating with Rashmeet Kaur on “Ranjha” and with Shikha Joshi on “Maryo.” IP Singh rounds out the featured releases with “Chingari.”</p>
<p>
	“Our goal was to bring music from Kashmir to a larger audience and create a bridge between Kashmir and the rest of the world,” said Danish Renzu. “The distribution partnership with Warner does exactly that—it helps the sounds of Kashmir travel across the globe. I’m grateful to Vaibhav [Nagpal, head of partner relations, acquisition and distribution at Warner Music India] for putting his faith in us and excited to see where this journey takes us. We have some exciting projects lined up to share with the world.”
	</p>
<p>
	The deal has attracted endorsements from entertainment industry figures who see cultural significance in the partnership. Actor Saba Azad noted the broader implications: “Kashmir is often in the news but there is little to nothing of its culture that makes it to the mainstream. I’m delighted Danish is bringing the music of the people of Kashmir to mainstream India and the world and that Warner has put their faith in his efforts.”</p>
<p>
	For the artists involved, the collaboration represents an opportunity to blend traditional and contemporary approaches. Shikha Joshi reflected on her experience: “Creating an Indian fusion that blended Kashmiri folk with contemporary elements was so enriching. It was lovely working alongside naturally gifted artists like Noor Mohammad ji whose authentic folk texture gave a truly unique sound.”</p>
<div><p>
	Actor Udit Arora, known for Netflix’s “The Royals” and a collaborator on one of the label’s Kashmiri tracks, emphasized the timing: “Music from Kashmir is beautiful and I’m glad that finally this music is getting its well-deserved platform. We want to focus on more success stories from the valley. It’s time.”</p></div>

	<a target="_blank" href="https://variety.com/t/cambodia/">Cambodia</a> has submitted the psychological horror thriller “<a target="_blank" href="https://variety.com/t/tenement/">Tenement</a>,” co-directed by Inrasothythep Neth and Sokyou Chea, as its contender for best international feature at the 98th <a target="_blank" href="https://variety.com/t/academy-awards/">Academy Awards</a>.</p>
<p>
	The film is set within a decaying Khmer Rouge–era tenement in Phnom Penh. It follows Soriya (Thorn Thanet), a Cambodian-Japanese manga artist who returns home after her mother’s death and becomes trapped in a series of terrifying visions that blur the boundaries between the past and present.
	</p>
<p>
	“Tenement” world premiered in the Big Screen Competition at the International Film Festival Rotterdam in 2024 and has since screened at Osaka Asian Film Festival, Ho Chi Minh City International Film Festival, Seattle International Film Festival, Sitges International Fantastic Film Festival, Kaohsiung Film Festival, Luxembourg City Film Festival, Motel X and Horrorant’s Fright Nights, among others.
</p>
<p>
	Shot across Tokyo and Phnom Penh, production began in 2020 but was delayed for two years by the COVID-19 pandemic. The film employed Dolby Atmos sound design, a first for Cambodian cinema, and went on to win best production design at the 2024 Ho Chi Minh City International Film Festival.</p>
<p>
	The film is produced by Westec Media Limited and Kongchak Pictures. </p>
<p>
	International sales for “Tenement” are handled by Paris-based Reel Suspects.</p>
<p>
	This marks Cambodia’s latest attempt at the international feature Oscar. The country has previously submitted several films, with only Rithy Panh’s “The Missing Picture” in 2013 securing a nomination. In 2022, Davy Chou’s “Return to Seoul” made it to the shortlist. 
	</p>
<div><p>
	The Oscar international feature shortlist will be announced on Dec. 16 and the final five nominees will be announced on Jan. 22.</p></div>
