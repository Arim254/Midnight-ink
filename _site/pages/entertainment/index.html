	<a target="_blank" href="https://variety.com/t/stephen-king/">Stephen King</a> recently spoke to <a href="https://www.thetimes.com/culture/books/article/stephen-king-author-77-writing-dementia-worries-interview-2w85zz6cq" target="_blank">The Times UK</a> and criticized Hollywood’s superhero movies for often depicting baseless violence. In various Marvel and DC movies, entire cities are destroyed without the viewer seeing any actual harm to human life. King, whose dystopian horror novel “The Long Walk” gets the film adaptation treatment this month, does not agree with this approach to movie violence.</p>
<p>
	“If you look at these superhero movies, you’ll see some supervillain who’s destroying whole city blocks but you never see any blood,” King said. “And man, that’s wrong. It’s almost, like, pornographic… I said [for ‘The Long Walk’], if you’re not going to show it, don’t bother. And so they made a pretty brutal movie.”
	</p>
<p>
	Directed by “The Hunger Games” veteran Francis Lawrence and adapted by “Strange Darling” filmmaker JT Mollner, “The Long Walk” movie follows the same setup as King’s 1979 novel. Set in a dystopian United States, the story centers on a group of teenage boys who compete in the eponymous contest that requires them to walk at a certain speed or get killed. The film stars Cooper Hoffman, David Jonsson, Judy Greer, Mark Hamill and more.</p>
<p>
	In a recent <a target="_blank" href="https://variety.com/2025/film/features/cooper-hoffman-the-long-walk-acting-challenges-1236498409/">interview with </a><em><a target="_blank" href="https://variety.com/2025/film/features/cooper-hoffman-the-long-walk-acting-challenges-1236498409/">Variety</a>,</em> Hoffman said the movie’s storyline required the actors to often walk “15 miles a day in 100-degree weather” during filming.</p>
<p>
	“There are moments where you’re forced to be method actors,” Hoffman said. “Whatever ‘method’ means to people. But we <em>are </em>walking. No one is faking that. And it is exhausting.”</p>
<p>
	“The Long Walk” opens in theaters Sept. 12 from Lionsgate.</p>

	The Folio Society is marking <a target="_blank" href="https://variety.com/t/jane-austen/">Jane Austen</a>’s 250th birthday with a collector’s edition fit for a literary icon. On Sept. 9 at 11 a.m. ET, the London-based publisher will release <a href="https://www.foliosociety.com/usa/austen-collection" target="_blank">“Jane Austen: The Complete Novels,” </a>a six-volume limited edition of Austen’s major works, capped at just 750 copies worldwide.</p>
<p>
	The release gathers all six of Austen’s beloved novels — “Sense and Sensibility,” “Pride and Prejudice,” “Mansfield Park,” “Emma,” “Northanger Abbey” and “Persuasion” — in an elaborate set. Each volume features woodcut frontispieces and Regency-inspired illustrations by printmaker Sarah Young. Each copy also comes with a new introduction by historian and broadcaster Lucy Worsley exploring Austen’s world and cultural influence. Traditional versions of Austen’s books are also available at a less steeper price on <a href="https://clicks.trx-hub.com/xid/pmc_0aaa4_variety?q=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FGreatest-Works-Jane-Austen-Books%2Fdp%2F9388810511%3Fcrid%3D11WUJFO3166Z7%26dib%3DeyJ2IjoiMSJ9.ZlXPXZh0JPJDui2Wqy6OxP-Z-dEYx7KMbsQEE1aKXL1owHIl4ZrOiMBuNBXg_EwNEP22257jIYsKypfdsIyqCS0s7pnsNt6rdhqqkDMZTn0CF42neQuyRB-Ebu7mBf858Cxh5y6SQPHSxSoIKe1R8sqZzzxZ0YORvrY9yvIV5JRbSFg0PXVZSfyV_02l76eya7UKiLoy6XKmc7mBgZFdxusnuTJ1keu-VclZo847uq8.toR1wLzKWo4tXVCw1eC8Sqtsuf99E_k49jqRrbhbSE4%26dib_tag%3Dse%26keywords%3Djane%2Bausten%26qid%3D1756998632%26sprefix%3Djane%2Baus%252Caps%252C345%26sr%3D8-1-spons%26sp_csd%3Dd2lkZ2V0TmFtZT1zcF9hdGY%26psc%3D1%26linkCode%3Dll1%26tag%3Dvypinterest-20%26linkId%3D24ee9fd487a95f3c9fd14327323f862f%26language%3Den_US%26ref_%3Das_li_ss_tl%26asc_source%3Dweb%26asc_campaign%3Dweb%26asc_refurl%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Fvariety.com%252F2025%252Fshopping%252Fnews%252Fjane-austen-collectors-set-buy-online-1236507898%252F&amp;p=https%3A%2F%2Fvariety.com%2F2025%2Fshopping%2Fnews%2Fjane-austen-collectors-set-buy-online-1236507898%2F&amp;ref=pmcTrackonomicsReferrer&amp;event_type=click" target="_blank">Amazon</a>.

	Austen’s novels have inspired some of the most enduring film and television adaptations of the last half-century, from Ang Lee’s 1995 “Sense and Sensibility” starring Emma Thompson and Kate Winslet, to Joe Wright’s 2005 “Pride &amp; Prejudice” led by Keira Knightley, and countless television versions for the BBC and PBS’ Masterpiece. More recently, Autumn de Wilde’s candy-colored Emma (2020) introduced Austen to Gen Z audiences, while Netflix’s Persuasion (2022), starring Dakota Johnson, proved the an enduring appetite for Austen’s romantic worlds.</p>
<p>
	Hollywood isn’t done with her either: several new projects are reportedly in development, with studios and streamers continuing to mine her works for fresh takes. A <a target="_blank" href="https://variety.com/2025/film/news/daisy-edgar-jones-sense-and-sensibility-movie-1236440135/">new remake of “Sense and Sensibility,” </a>starring Daisy Edgar-Jones, is in the works at Focus Features.
</p>
<p>
	With only 750 sets available, “Jane Austen: The Complete Novels” is as much a collector’s piece as a reading experience. Buy the new release starting Sept. 9 here.<br /></p>

	If you purchase an independently reviewed product or service through a link on our website, Variety may receive an affiliate commission.</p>
<p>
	A new day, a new spin-off. “<a target="_blank" href="https://variety.com/t/ncis/">NCIS</a>, Tony and Ziva,” the highly anticipated series from the crime drama series drops tonight on Paramount+. </p>
<p>
	The 10-episode spin-off debuts on the streamer with its free three episodes on Sept. 4 at at 12 a.m. PT, with one new episode dropping weekly thereafter until the finale in Oct. 23. The series will debut on Paramount+ in the U.S., Canada, U.K., Australia, Latin America, Brazil, Italy, Germany, Switzerland, Austria, and Japan.
	</p>
<p>
	“‘NCIS: Tony &amp; Ziva’ picks up after Ziva’s (Cote de Pablo) supposed death when Tony (Michael Weatherly) left the NCIS team to go raise their daughter. Years later, Ziva was discovered alive, leading her to complete one final mission with NCIS before she was reunited with Tony and their daughter in Paris. Since then – and where we find them in the new show– Tony and Ziva have been raising their daughter, Tali (Isla Gie), together. When Tony’s security company is attacked, they must go on the run across Europe, try to figure out who is after them and maybe even learn to trust each other again so they can finally have their unconventional happily ever after.”
</p>
<p>
	“What a luxury it is to revisit a character after such a long time,” de Pablo told a crowd while teasing a clip from the series at Mipcom in Cannes earlier this year. De Pablo and Weatherly worked together on “NCIS” for 10 years, playing longtime co-workers who always seemed to have a romantic spark between them. The pair haven’t been seen together on screen in the “NCIS” universe since 2013, when de Pablo exited as a series regular.
	</p>
<p>
	Along with de Pablo, Weatherly, and Gie, the cast of the series includes Amita Suman, Maximilian Osinski, Lara Rossi, Nassima Benchicou, Terence Maynard, Julian Ovenden, and James D’Arcy.</p>

                <p class="excerpt">Madelyn Cline is a “sleepy girl” — understandably so. This summer, she’s had two massive films come out — first, the highly anticipated “I Know What You Did Last Summer,” and second, Prime Video’s romance...</p>
              </div>

              <!-- 🔑 Modal body -->
              <template class="article-body">
                <div><p>
	<a target="_blank" href="https://variety.com/t/madelyn-cline/">Madelyn Cline</a> is a “sleepy girl” — understandably so. This summer, she’s had two massive films come out — first, the highly anticipated “<a target="_blank" href="https://variety.com/t/i-know-what-you-did-last-summer/">I Know What You Did Last Summer</a>,” and second, Prime Video’s romance “<a target="_blank" href="https://variety.com/t/the-map-that-leads-to-you/">The Map That Leads to You</a>.” By the time the latter came out, she was back in Charleston to film the fifth and final season of “<a target="_blank" href="https://variety.com/t/outer-banks/">Outer Banks</a>.”</p>
<p>
	“I think sometimes managing all of it is a little difficult. That’s my own fault. I definitely need an assistant — my Oura ring says I need to do better, mostly with sleep and taking care of myself,” Cline says during a Zoom interview. “It’s about learning how to juggle all of it, while also prioritizing myself. Sometimes I feel like I’m constantly playing catch-up. Centering myself in the middle of it all has been a little difficult. Like anything, the longer the time goes on, the better I get at it. We’re a traveling circus. That’s just the name of the game, and that’s the fun of it.”
	</p>
<p>
	Currently, she’s in the throes of “Outer Banks” and will likely be filming until December or January 2026, depending on whether or not storms delay production. During our conversation, we discuss her very busy year, whether she’ll take time off, playing <em>pregnant</em> Sarah Cameron in Season 5 and the “OBX” pairing she hopes <em>is not</em> endgame.
</p>
	<h5>
		You’ve been going nonstop. How are you handling all of this? 	</h5>
<p>
	Shooting “Outer Banks” is always really physically taxing, and I don’t feel like I get a whole lot of time for myself, which is something that I love. I love being able to spend time alone or be quiet and recharge, and that has definitely not been the theme of this year so far. But it’s ultimately been very fulfilling, and it’s a great lesson in relinquishing any need or want to control outcomes or situations. I simply can’t, which I think is always a really good life lesson to come back to. I’m mainly just really tired. I’ve always been a very sleepy girl!
	</p>
	<h5>
		Let’s start out with “The Map That Leads to You.” What made you say yes to this?	</h5>
<p>
	The first time I read it, it made me sob uncontrollably. I thought the story was really, really beautiful, and I was really attached to Heather and Jack. But I love a good romance, I love a good love story, and I think theirs is really special.</p>
	<h5>
		KJ Apa is excellent as Jack, and your chemistry is great. How did you go about finding that bond?	</h5>
<p>
	I knew from our chemistry read that KJ was Jack, and that was step one. And then once we got there, step two was to live in these adventures that these characters were on. The line between reality and stories started to get a little blurry, and we were also giving ourselves up to the experience and the travel. I think that’s when I knew things were working. The energy, it felt like, was all kind of conspiring with us. The experience itself was special, and it’s hard for that to <em>not</em> translate.</p>
	<h5>
		How did you feel about the ending?	</h5>
<p>
	I personally love an ambiguous ending. I like to cry, I like to sob. I like to go into a downward spiral for catharsis. An ending that’s not definitive, I find, is more personal because you can superimpose your own thoughts and feelings. I was also a big fan of an alternate ending that was even more ambiguous. There were lots and lots of conversations about how much we lean to the imagination. I was fully in the imagination station corner.</p>
	<h5>
		So, is there a possibility we could get a sequel?	</h5>
<p>
	We have joked about it, actually. And Marty Bowen, one of our producers, has jokingly given me a plot. I don’t want to spoil it, but it’s really funny. It leans more into the “com” than “rom.”</p>

	<h5>
		You said earlier, “Nostalgia is overrated.” But “I Know What You Did Last Summer” was nostalgic for many of us!	</h5>
<p>
	“I Know What You Did Last Summer,” even though it’s a legacy sequel, is still kind of its own. They also brought such an amazing camp to it. That was really fun to shoot.</p>
	<h5>
		How do you feel now that it’s out in the world? Do you read reviews?	</h5>
<p>
	Sometimes I get curious and maybe seek out some reviews. If I’m feeling a little self-loathing, maybe I’ll even read the bad ones. Ultimately, what I love is that people are just very, very passionate about what they like and what they don’t like. They have opinions, and everyone’s entitled to that. 
	</p>
	<h5>
		You have scenes with Sarah Michelle Gellar and Freddie Prinze Jr. Did you get any time with Jennifer Love Hewitt on set, too?	</h5>
<p>
	Actually, no. I met her for the first time at the premiere. Some of our days overlapped, but we were like passing ships in the night. We were on such a tight schedule. Everything was so under wraps, especially our legacy cast members — super top secret. She was so sweet, I walked up to her at the premiere and I was like, “Hi, mom. Mother!”</p>
	<h5>
		That ending is also set up for a sequel, with most of the women surviving! Have you talked about what that would look like?	</h5>
<p>
	No, we have not spoken about it at all. We’ve had a good laugh about it, and we’ve talked about what would be funny or cool but not officially.</p>
	<h5>
		Can I ask one plot question: Where were Danica and Ava’s (Chase Sui Wonders) parents at the end? Why didn’t anyone pick them up at the hospital?	</h5>
<p>
	I don’t know! At least Danica’s parents were at her first bridal shower. The parents were kind of an afterthought.</p>

	<h5>
		OK, let’s dive into “Outer Banks.” Production has started on Season 5. Does it feel different, knowing you’re filming the final season?	</h5>
<p>
	Besides the obvious of how much things have changed, it’s definitely already different. But knowing that this is the last go around, there’s definitely some nostalgia. There’s definitely some bittersweet energy.</p>
	<h5>
		Is there a time jump? 	</h5>
<p>
	Actually no. We pick up pretty soon after Season 4 ends. We have one big time jump in all five, but just like the prior seasons, everything happens in such a short amount of time; it feels like it would be this huge, months-long adventure, but it actually doesn’t take that much time at all. I think this one follows the same formula.</p>
	<h5>
		At the end of Season 4, Sarah finds out she’s pregnant. What can you say about her journey this season?	</h5>
<p>
	Well, I’m not wearing a baby bump. Everyone’s like, “Where’s the baby?” I don’t know. I’m not jumping over walls and getting thrown off the back of boats and sprinting at full speed away from bad guys in a silicone baby bump. When I said yes to this storyline, that was my one stipulation: “Please don’t do that to me in the South Carolina summer heat.” Most of July, the heat index was 100-116.</p>
	<h5>
		When were you told the ending?	</h5>
<p>
	I have known from the beginning the way they wanted to end — not the full wrap-up, but I remember when we were first shooting Season 1, I asked [co-creator] Jonas Pate if they knew how the story ended, and in very broad strokes, three sentences, he told me.
	</p>
	<h5>
		Let’s talk about the show’s romances. With Rudy Pankow being gone, people are really hoping Rafe (Drew Starkey) and Kiara (Madison Bailey) will get together. How do you feel about that?	</h5>
<p>
	I hate that. I really don’t want to yuck anyone’s yum, but I actually think that that’s really yuck. Just because there’s a single character doesn’t mean she has to get with anyone, especially not the psychotic older brother. But maybe that’s just me! I understand — I, too, am a girl who looks and says, “I can fix him.” I get it. I’ve been there. We’ve all been there. But I just don’t think Rafe Cameron is for Kiara. She deserves better. He deserves a therapist.</p>
	<h5>
		I really like that you said just because she’s single, it doesn’t mean she needs to be paired off.	</h5>
<p>
	That’s one thing I really don’t like! Sometimes, just because there’s a single girl, we refuse to try and pass the Bechdel test. So much has happened to her. She’s gone through so much, and to just throw her into a relationship storyline, I think kind of downplays all the exploration of grief, and basically her whole arc. Kiara’s always been such a strong character, and I love seeing her explore coming into her power. I know there are shippers — they keep saying it, we keep saying no!</p>
	<h5>
		Will you be taking a break after “Outer Banks”?	</h5>
<p>
	I say I will, but also, if I’m sitting and it’s too quiet for too long, I feel like I need to find a job. </p>

	In his directorial debut, “Maddie’s Secret,” <a target="_blank" href="https://variety.com/t/john-early/">John Early</a> wears a lace-front wig and a fresh face of makeup to transform into the title character, a woman who works as a food influencer while concealing a debilitating eating disorder.</p>
<p>
	But it was an invisible alteration that was most difficult for Early. “I tucked for the first time in my life,” says the comedian and actor best known for “Search Party” and his sketch comedy with Kate Berlant. “My balls were on a shelf in my stomach cavity, basically.”
	</p>
<p>
	The realization that Early needed to tuck and tape his genitals between his legs, a common process in the world of drag, came on the first day of filming.
</p>
<p>
	“Everyone said it wasn’t necessary, and then on day one we shot the running scenes. It was totally necessary,” Early says, his eyes narrowing. “I feel quite heartbroken about some of the shots where you can… see it.”</p>
<p>
	Sitting in a park in New York’s Chinatown, Early discusses “Maddie’s Secret” publicly for the first time, ahead of its Sept. 4 premiere at the Toronto Intl. Film Festival. “It didn’t feel like drag,” Early says of his performance as Maddie. “I just felt like an actress.”</p>

<p>
	Shot independently over just four weeks in Los Angeles, the film walks a tonal tightrope, oscillating between a lurid melodrama and a played-straight workplace soap that almost resembles a Disney Channel original movie. “I wanted it to be both a hard comedy and a hard drama, and not a dramedy,” Early says.</p>
<p>
	In the film, Maddie cheerfully navigates the politics of her jealous co-worker (Claudia O’Doherty), exacting boss (Connor O’Malley) and lesbian BFF (Berlant) at the sunny studios of Gourmaybe. But away from the ring lights, cowering in the dark corners of her home, lies a pivotal conflict that dares the viewer to take Maddie — and thus a wig-laden Early — seriously.
	</p>
<p>
	“The transformation into Maddie is a magic trick,” says Early. “Once the audience accepts it in the beginning, then they have suspended their disbelief, and they’re willing to go along with a tone that’s very heightened.”</p>
<p>
	But while Early insists the film would not work without him embodying the female lead, it was nonetheless a risk. “I was nervous that I had written myself a role that required an incredible emotional commitment,” he says. “I had moments of paralyzing fear, where I was like, ‘You are the one holding the gun to your head. Put down the gun.’”</p>
<p>
	In fact, the entire concept for the film came from Early’s desire to play a “blonde ingénue in a high-style melodrama.” He specifically wanted it to be set in contemporary life, and he wanted to avoid a “sent-up satire,” instead aiming for something “more emotionally strange and compelling.” When it came time to develop the character, Early thought what better modern-day ingénue than a culinary content creator? “They are my princesses,” Early says. “I watch their videos at night before bed with no intention of making the recipe, but just because their presence is soothing.” Plus, “It felt very funny to me to say things like Hulu or [the Chinese sauce brand] Fly by Jing in the way that Lana Turner might have said it in the 1950s.”</p>
<p>
	“Maddie’s Secret” showcases elegantly crafted, social media-ready dishes, but it also claws behind that beautiful facade and scratches at the grotesque and sometimes carnal way we view food.</p>
<p>
	“Half of my algorithm is Turkish men getting their pecks rubbed with oil, and the other half is girls emulsifying pasta in a pan, where the noodles are slapping the edge, and it’s really creamy and buttery,” Early says. “It’s unmistakably sexual, you know? There was something very dark in my algorithm with the intersection of food and sex.”</p>
<p>
	And central to the film is not only how we consume food but how it can, in turn, consume us.</p>
<p>
	“I obviously knew that I was stepping into something very sensitive and potentially very painful for people,” Early says of depicting Maddie’s eating disorder. “But I’ve always felt that it’s the job of art to drill fearlessly into the emotions of it, instead of carefully stepping back. It’s not a filmmaker’s job to be educational about these issues, it’s about exploding them into mythic proportions.”</p>
