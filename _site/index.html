                                    <p>The situation between the Cowboys and linebacker Micah Parsons is getting ugly. It could still get even uglier.</p><p>Dallas faces the Eagles in only 10 days. Parsons has yet to practice during training camp, citing a back problem. Owner and G.M. Jerry Jones has dismissed his “hurt back” (and Micah’s trade request) as a negotiating tactic. In other words, Jerry doesn’t think it’s real.</p><p>The MRI of Parsons’s back was, according to coach Brian Schottenheimer, “pretty clean.” If the team thinks it’s clean enough for Parsons to play, the team could take things up a notch.</p><p>As one league source with knowledge of the procedures explained it to PFT, the Cowboys can send a letter to Parsons, explaining that he’s cleared to practice and reminding him that failure to do so constitutes conduct detrimental to the team.</p><p>If he persists in refusing to practice (and, eventually, to play), the Cowboys can take action. They can fine him for conduct detrimental to the team. Eventually, he can be suspended, for up to four games without pay.</p>
<p>During his recent interview with Hall of Fame receiver Michael Irvin, Jones explained the Parsons is under contract for 2025, and that the Cowboys can string the situation out after that, through a couple of franchise tags. Which is what they did with quarterback Dak Prescott.</p><p>"[T]he precedent is handling it like Dak,” Jones said. “If he doesn’t, <span><a href="https://www.espn.com/nfl/story/_/id/46043382/jerry-jones-cowboys-offer-parsons-was-richest-non-qb" target="_blank">it’s very costly</a></span>. It’s very costly for everybody.”</p><p>For Micah, it’s eventually costly to the tune of $5.33 million. Which is the cost of a four-game unpaid suspension, based on his fifth-year option of $24 million.</p><p>And that could be where things are heading, if the Cowboys decide to take the current ugliness to the next level.</p>

        <h3><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2025/aug/25/netflix-astrology-hub">Can Netflix find your new favourite watch based on your star sign?</a></h3>
        <p>The streamer has launched a new tool it claims can predict which film or show you’re going to love based on astrology</p>
      </div>

      <!-- Inert full body for modal -->
      <template class="article-body">
        <div><p><span>A</span>s you will already be aware, one of the downsides of the streaming era is decision paralysis. In times gone by, people would watch television by simply turning their television on, watching whatever was showing at that precise moment and then complaining about it. But now, as you find yourself forced to pick from every single film and series ever made, you feel overwhelmed. You spend entire evenings scrolling through submenu after submenu, glazing over as your inability to find something to watch ossifies into dissociative panic.</p><figure></figure><p>The challenge for the streamers is how to effectively curate this infinite content. In the past they have done this by prioritising new releases, or showing you what everyone else is watching, or sharpening their algorithms to second-guess what you want to watch based on what you have already watched. But finally – finally – <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theguardian.com/media/netflix">Netflix</a> has cracked it. And it has achieved this with science.</p><p>Sorry, not science, <em>bullshit</em>. Because this weekend Netflix officially launched its <a target="_blank" href="https://www.netflix.com/browse/genre/82115657">Astrology Hub</a>. Now, after all these years, subscribers can at last pick something to watch based on a loose collection of personality quirks determined by the position of the planets at the time of their birth. Doesn’t that sound great?</p><p>So, for instance, I am a Leo. And this means that, when I enter the Netflix Astrology Hub and scroll down a bit, I am informed that “Leos have main character energy”. And as such, it means I should watch The Crown, or The King, or Queen Charlotte: A Bridgerton Story, or Emily in Paris, or The Kissing Booth 2, or that Cilla Black biopic that ITV made a few years ago. And I think that, as a heterosexual 45-year-old man, Netflix has absolutely cracked it.</p><p>Sure, I have already watched most of these for work, and I flat-out disliked almost all of them. But if Netflix says that every single person born within a specific window has the exact same personality, then sure. Tonight, after flopping down on to my sofa at the end of another long day trying to locate the right balance between quality family time and the financial imperative to work, I will watch Emily in bloody Paris. And I will like it, because Netflix told me that I would.</p><figure><div><picture><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0a785b737badec37ebe1627421d4a7a718986708/0_0_1372_792/master/1372.jpg?width=620&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 660px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 660px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"></source><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0a785b737badec37ebe1627421d4a7a718986708/0_0_1372_792/master/1372.jpg?width=620&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 660px)"></source><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0a785b737badec37ebe1627421d4a7a718986708/0_0_1372_792/master/1372.jpg?width=605&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 480px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 480px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"></source><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0a785b737badec37ebe1627421d4a7a718986708/0_0_1372_792/master/1372.jpg?width=605&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 480px)"></source><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0a785b737badec37ebe1627421d4a7a718986708/0_0_1372_792/master/1372.jpg?width=445&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 320px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 320px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"></source><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0a785b737badec37ebe1627421d4a7a718986708/0_0_1372_792/master/1372.jpg?width=445&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 320px)"></source><img alt="Netflix’s astrology hub" src="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0a785b737badec37ebe1627421d4a7a718986708/0_0_1372_792/master/1372.jpg?width=445&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" /></picture></div><figcaption><span><svg width="18" height="13"></svg></span><span>Netflix’s astrology hub.</span> Photograph: Netflix</figcaption></figure><p>Now, the naysayers among you will point out that all these choices seem geared to appeal to young girls, because young girls are statistically the demographic most likely to believe in the zodiac, and so the Netflix Astrology Hub is essentially just a bit of a grift designed to push content at one specific group. And you might even go further, by pointing out that astrology is a pseudoscience that has repeatedly proved itself to have no scientific validity whatsoever. To which I respond: of course you think that, you’re a Virgo.</p><p>And anyway, if there is any message at all behind the Netflix Astrology Hub, it is this: just be grateful that you’re not an Aquarius. Because while the other signs get off relatively lightly – Sagittarians (“bring adventure”) get Indiana Jones and the Spider-Verse, Capricorns (“activate boss mode”) get Hostage and Blackberry, and Virgos (“always hustling”) get Beef and Oppenheimer, the Aquarians are left to mournfully sift through the scraps.</p><p>Aquarians, according to Netflix, are “otherworldly” and that means their recommendations include the worst Men in Black film, the terrible Battleship film, a bizarre South Korean drama about a gynaecologist who falls in love on a space station and, of course, Rebel Moon: Part One – A Child of Fire. Does this seem like a deliberate decision on the part of Netflix to alienate a full 12th of its subscriber base? Probably, but maybe Aquarians lap this stuff up. I’m not a scientist, so I don’t know.</p><p>But, still, here we are. Netflix has access to an almost unparalleled set of highly tailored data points about every single one of its subscribers. It knows what you watch, when you watch it and for how long. It knows, with granular precision, more about your viewing habits than you ever will. It changes the image for each piece of content it has, based on your specific desires, to better maximise clicks. By harnessing this universe of data, Netflix is able to individually drip-feed shows and films to you with such dead-on accuracy that it feels like magic. But, in a way, isn’t it better to just blankly state that all Libras like Peaky Blinders and be done with it? I am willing to say yes it is.</p></div>

<p>However, the mood in the market is cautious. Nvidia shares have been volatile this week, <a target="_blank" href="https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/nvda">sliding 3.5% last Tuesday</a> after comments from OpenAI’s CEO raised concerns about an <a target="_blank" href="https://www.tipranks.com/compare-stocks/artificial-intelligence">AI</a> bubble. Adding to pressure, an MIT report <a target="_blank" href="https://www.tipranks.com/news/tech-stocks-fall-as-investors-begin-to-question-the-ai-hype">suggested that most companies investing in generative AI</a> have yet to see returns. That has weighed on tech broadly, with the Nasdaq down more than 7% in recent sessions.</p>
<figure><a target="_blank" href="https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/nvda"><img src="https://blog.tipranks.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/image-1750.png" alt="" srcset="https://blog.tipranks.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/image-1750.png 772w, https://blog.tipranks.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/image-1750-300x159.png 300w, https://blog.tipranks.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/image-1750-768x408.png 768w" /></a></figure>
<h2><strong>Nvidia Balances Supply Strains and Export Rules</strong></h2>
<p>At the same time, Nvidia is working through its own operational challenges. The company’s new <a target="_blank" href="https://www.tipranks.com/news/nvidia-falls-amid-blackwell-delays-and-potential-export-rules">Blackwell-based GPUs have faced production delays</a> tied to partner Taiwan <a target="_blank" href="https://www.tipranks.com/compare-stocks/chips-stocks">Semiconductor</a> Manufacturing Co. <a target="_blank" href="https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/tsm">(TSM)</a>, and some analysts warn that full-scale shipments may not land until later next year. These supply constraints could influence the company’s ability to meet rising demand.</p>
<p>Geopolitical issues are also in play. CEO Jensen Huang confirmed last week that Nvidia is in talks with the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/djt">Trump</a> administration <a target="_blank" href="https://www.tipranks.com/news/nvidia-nvda-unveils-cloud-gaming-boost-and-china-only-chip">about a next-generation AI chip for the Chinese market.</a> The proposed B30A chip would deliver roughly half the computing power of the flagship B300 to comply with export rules. This comes as the company and <a target="_blank" href="https://www.tipranks.com/news/new-15-tariff-stuns-nvidia-and-amd-as-analysts-wonder-whos-next">Advanced Micro Devices </a><a target="_blank" href="https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/amd">(AMD)</a> face a 15% revenue-sharing requirement on advanced chip sales to China, adding another layer of complexity to growth plans.</p>
<h2><strong><strong>Is Nvidia Stock a Buy, Sell, or Hold?</strong></strong></h2>
<p>Despite these hurdles, analysts remain broadly positive. Out of 39 ratings, 35 analysts rate NVDA shares a Buy, culminating in a Strong Buy consensus. The <a target="_blank" href="https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/nvda/forecast">average NVDA stock price target stands at $198.57,</a> about 11.5% above the current price of $177.99. </p>

<p>Still, with high expectations and sensitive headlines, the upcoming earnings call will be pivotal. Investors want proof that Nvidia can sustain growth while managing supply, regulation, and a market debating whether AI is a boom or a bubble.</p>

Director Kelly Reichardt makes of him a rather Updikean figure who ends up on the run from the consequences of his own actions.<br />

        <p>The Netflix phenomenon has shot relative unknowns to stardom, and inspired kids and parents alike</p>

      <template class="article-body">
        <div><p><strong>OK, so what actually is KPop Demon Hunters? I’ve heard it mentioned by parents at school, by kids and randomly on social media but I am too lazy to Google it. Also, Google is terrible now.</strong></p><p>It’s been touted by <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theguardian.com/media/netflix">Netflix</a> as the platform’s most-watched original animated film ever. It tells the story of three hunters who use music’s power to move and connect hearts to create a barrier – the “golden Honmoon” – that will keep the forces of evil demons at bay. But probably just as importantly, it has everything: characters that grow, gorgeous animated visuals and a soundtrack I’ve been playing on repeat.</p><p><strong>That sounds great! Big fan of demon hunting. But is it</strong><strong> for kids, adults, or both?</strong></p><p>Like many animated productions, it can be watched on multiple levels. I put the film on for my niece and nephew, who loved the action and fun animation. However, just as viewers can enjoy Wall-E or Spirited Away with childlike wonder at any age, the film’s story and characters might resonate with adults just as much. The characters of KPop Demon Hunters deal with survivors’ guilt, pressures to perform and finding their voices in a chaotic world.</p><p><strong>Are BlackPink in it? Or other legit K-pop stars? My K-pop knowledge is extremely limited. </strong><strong>Though my kids occasionally sing the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Ebqe2Dbzls">‘ah pt pt’</a></strong><strong><a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Ebqe2Dbzls"> song</a>, if that helps.</strong></p><p>No BlackPink. In, fact the singing stars of KPop Demon Hunters come from relative obscurity. EJAE, who provides the singing voice for the main character, Rumi, had been considered an K-pop unsuccessful debut, and went on to find success on the other side of the recording booth, writing and producing. The same could be said for Andrew Choi – the singing voice of another major character, Jinu – whose career hadn’t gone far before this. It’s quite meta, really – that a movie about the pressures to keep up appearances has now shot two relative unknowns, previously unable to meet the K-pop industry’s infamous standards for beauty and perfection, to stardom.</p><figure></figure><p><strong>Even though it seems really popular, I haven’t</strong><strong> seen</strong><strong> ads for it</strong><strong>. I only know about it from people talking about it in real life and on social media. What’s going on?</strong></p><p>It seems like Sony, the corporation behind the studio that created Kpop Demon Hunters didn’t have enough confidence to sell it themselves. According to <a target="_blank" href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/paultassi/2025/08/15/sony-lost-big-on-kpop-demon-hunters-record-success-says-report/">Forbes</a>, Sony sold the rights to KPop Demon Hunters to Netflix for just US$100m so I can imagine the hair-tearing frustration when the movie caught fire. Not only has it risen to the top of Netflix but four of its songs, Golden, How It’s Done, Soda Pop and Your Idol, took two out of five spots in <a target="_blank" href="https://www.billboard.com/music/chart-beat/huntr-x-golden-global-charts-number-one-fifth-week-1236046527/">Billboard’s</a> top 5 charts. It’s safe to say the execs at Sony had no idea how much audiences would love it, and they paid dearly.</p><p><strong>Wow, OK. So is it good? It sounds like it is good.</strong></p><p>The fact that an entire month after its streaming release, its theatrical “sing-a-long” release in cinemas has <a target="_blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/p/DNvnq2s3mQ_/">packed out cinemas</a> with <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2025/aug/13/uk-cinemas-to-host-kpop-demon-hunters-sing-alongs">kids and adults alike</a>, says it all. In a world of AI slop, turns out the kids just want to be inspired by something Golden.</p></div>

Director Paul Thomas Anderson returns with a movie inspired by Thomas Pynchon’s 1990 novel Vineland, another black comic riff on the war on drugs, the war on terror, the paranoid style of American politics and much else. Leonardo DiCaprio and Sean Penn star as two ex-revolutionaries trying to save the former’s daughter, played by Chase Infiniti.<br />
 <span></span> <em>26 September</em></p><h2 id="him">Him</h2><p>A drama on classic underdog sports movie lines: Tyriq Withers plays Cameron, a promising but callow young American football player who gets the chance to train with the charismatic quarterback Isaiah White – a serious role for comedy veteran Marlon Wayans – and the experience is unnerving. Jordan Peele produces.<br />

The action will surely show that the hero is more than just a machine.<br />

With fewer than 1,500 people, the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk/lake-district">Lake District</a> event – created and curated by the art-rock outfit Sea Power – is intimate almost to the point of being familial.

Sea Power put in a herculean effort to play their third gig of the weekend on Sunday, despite some members being up until eight o’clock that morning, resulting in a chill and woozy set that feels custom-built for fragile brains.</p><figure></figure><p>While Krankenhaus is endearingly back to basics, it’s also deceptively vast. Steam train trips and guided walks in sublime mountainous settings open up its cosiness into even more beautiful terrain. While so many festivals feel like the equivalent of an airport experience – trapped in a space and rinsed for all you’ve got while stuck there – Krankenhaus really leans into its location and encourages festival-goers to do the same. It’s genuinely unique.</p></div>

The former rock festival is a post-GCSE rite of passage, a place for many to don a daft hat, wear as little as possible, toast results or drown sorrows. Two years ago, Szmeriek – imagine the Streets’ Mike Skinner with a ’tache and trackies – was a special needs teacher before becoming a dazzling wordsmith, so draws on his backstory (and gets another cheer) when he tells the kid in the front row who failed all his exams: “It doesn’t matter. You will be someone.”</p><p>Other hits include Skye Newman’s raw soul, dance producer <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2025/aug/24/optimism-is-very-important-especially-now-why-sammy-virjis-joyful-dance-tracks-are-conquering-the-world">Sammy Virji</a> and besuited, sunglasses-wearing New York one-man electronic band <a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXXbck3y5C8">Harrison Smith</a> AKA the Dare, whose brilliantly jerky set is like watching Jarvis Cocker fronting LCD Soundsystem. Kids waiting for rap at the main stage look bewildered by Amy Taylor’s raucous, shouty Aussie punks Amyl and the Sniffers. Trippie Redd’s affecting blend of the plaintive and unsettling is beautifully illustrated when a father plays football with his toddlers as the American raps about putting someone in their casket. Otherwise, with fewer stages and big names than previous years, the first day feels somewhat undersold and underpowered. US rap superstar Travis Scott’s headlining set builds in intensity as pyro and fireworks erupt around him, but ends abruptly 35 minutes early, without explanation, to a smattering of boos.</p><p>Saturday is visibly busier and while co-headliner <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2024/sep/21/chappell-roan-3olympia-theatre-dublin-live-review-the-rise-and-fall-of-a-midwest-princess">Chappell Roan</a> is second on the bill here (she topped it in Reading on Sunday, alternating with Hozier) she pulls by far the biggest crowd all weekend, a sea of pink cowboy hats.

With a fantasy castle stage set, outfit like an Andy Warhol take on Elizabethan England and female musicians reminiscent of Prince’s band, subjects from LGBTQ+ issues to feminism to meltdowns are channelled into joyous, stylish, era-defining anthems. Few artists have owned the field so effectively in years. Irish singer-songwriter Hozier has to follow that, but the crowd stay put and his cosier vibe explodes into fire when he speaks up for Kneecap, Palestine and equality, and closes with a blazing Take Me to Church.</p><figure><div><picture><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/57d8634b60708971f95482a1a63f3167b1dcef1e/0_0_4113_2435/master/4113.jpg?width=620&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 660px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 660px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"></source><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/57d8634b60708971f95482a1a63f3167b1dcef1e/0_0_4113_2435/master/4113.jpg?width=620&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 660px)"></source><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/57d8634b60708971f95482a1a63f3167b1dcef1e/0_0_4113_2435/master/4113.jpg?width=605&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 480px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 480px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"></source><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/57d8634b60708971f95482a1a63f3167b1dcef1e/0_0_4113_2435/master/4113.jpg?width=605&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 480px)"></source><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/57d8634b60708971f95482a1a63f3167b1dcef1e/0_0_4113_2435/master/4113.jpg?width=445&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 320px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 320px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"></source><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/57d8634b60708971f95482a1a63f3167b1dcef1e/0_0_4113_2435/master/4113.jpg?width=445&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 320px)"></source><img alt="The demonic commander … Oli Sykes of Bring Me the Horizon performing at Leeds festival." src="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/57d8634b60708971f95482a1a63f3167b1dcef1e/0_0_4113_2435/master/4113.jpg?width=445&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" /></picture></div><figcaption><span><svg width="18" height="13"></svg></span><span>The demonic commander … Oli Sykes of Bring Me the Horizon performing at Leeds festival.</span> Photograph: Katja Ogrin/Redferns for ABA</figcaption></figure><p>Sunday is rock day, and Sheffield pop-metal kings <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/bring-me-the-horizon">Bring Me the Horizon</a> deliver a postmodern eye- and ear-melter of a headline set where the band are stars in their own gigantic video game. Singer Oli Sykes is the demonic commander and the arm-swaying crowd and circle pits become part of the spectacle. Overall, though, it bodes well to see so many triumphs from newer artists, particularly Wunderhorse, who have gone off like a rocket since playing the BBC Introducing stage here last year and pack the hi-tech, usually dance-focused Chevron stage. For all the obvious echoes of Nirvana and REM, the Cornwall-based band’s undefinable edge – not least in wiry frontman Jacob Slater – makes them utterly compelling, and they enrapture an audience of all ages.</p></div>

The Leipzig Gewandhaus and the Melbourne Symphony are among this week’s arrivals. But the past weekend belonged to the Royal Concertgebouw Orchestra. No visit by Amsterdam’s finest is to be missed, but these two Proms in less than 24 hours brought something more – the starry presence of <a target="_blank" href="https://klausmakela.com/">Klaus Mäkelä</a>, who becomes the RCO’s chief conductor in 2027 and who currently has the musical world at his feet.</p><p>The obvious challenge in judging whether the two will become a perfect fit is that the RCO are simply so good. The warmth and precision of the Amsterdam string sound is legendary, while the RCO offers listeners wind playing to die for. So strong is the squad that, like a top football club, many principals who played in the visit’s first concert of Berio and Mahler were rotated in the second, consisting of Mozart, Prokofiev and Bartók.</p><figure><div><picture><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/69ef8e81de993aeb982113d880c9eea264faf25f/0_0_2949_1850/master/2949.jpg?width=880&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 1300px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 1300px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"></source><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/69ef8e81de993aeb982113d880c9eea264faf25f/0_0_2949_1850/master/2949.jpg?width=880&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 1300px)"></source><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/69ef8e81de993aeb982113d880c9eea264faf25f/0_0_2949_1850/master/2949.jpg?width=800&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 1140px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 1140px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"></source><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/69ef8e81de993aeb982113d880c9eea264faf25f/0_0_2949_1850/master/2949.jpg?width=800&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 1140px)"></source><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/69ef8e81de993aeb982113d880c9eea264faf25f/0_0_2949_1850/master/2949.jpg?width=640&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 980px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 980px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"></source><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/69ef8e81de993aeb982113d880c9eea264faf25f/0_0_2949_1850/master/2949.jpg?width=640&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 980px)"></source><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/69ef8e81de993aeb982113d880c9eea264faf25f/0_0_2949_1850/master/2949.jpg?width=620&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 660px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 660px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"></source><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/69ef8e81de993aeb982113d880c9eea264faf25f/0_0_2949_1850/master/2949.jpg?width=620&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 660px)"></source><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/69ef8e81de993aeb982113d880c9eea264faf25f/0_0_2949_1850/master/2949.jpg?width=605&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 480px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 480px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"></source><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/69ef8e81de993aeb982113d880c9eea264faf25f/0_0_2949_1850/master/2949.jpg?width=605&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 480px)"></source><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/69ef8e81de993aeb982113d880c9eea264faf25f/0_0_2949_1850/master/2949.jpg?width=445&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 320px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 320px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"></source><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/69ef8e81de993aeb982113d880c9eea264faf25f/0_0_2949_1850/master/2949.jpg?width=445&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 320px)"></source><img alt="Klaus Mäkelä conducts the Royal Concertgebouw orchestra at the BBC Proms." src="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/69ef8e81de993aeb982113d880c9eea264faf25f/0_0_2949_1850/master/2949.jpg?width=445&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" /></picture></div><figcaption><span><svg width="18" height="13"></svg></span><span>Playing to die for… Klaus Mäkelä conducts the Royal Concertgebouw orchestra at the BBC Proms.</span> Photograph: Chris Christodoulou/BBC</figcaption></figure><p>But Mäkelä is himself a Galáctico signing and the hall was duly packed. Still only 29, he brought two big works – Mahler’s fifth symphony in the first concert and Bartok’s Concerto for Orchestra in the second – not forgetting a truly thrilling Kodály encore to close with. The big pieces were fabulously played, of course, but it was the instrumental details rather than the overall conception that made the biggest mark. There was too little sense of symphonic architecture in Mäkelä’s approach to the Mahler, while his Bartók emphasised the work’s showpiece qualities at the expense of the sense of distance and loneliness that haunts the score.</p><p>Mahler, though, is in the RCO’s blood. The composer himself conducted this orchestra. Decades later, Bernard Haitink’s Amsterdam Mahler performances became legendary. Mäkelä’s relentless approach had little in common with Haitink’s more measured tread, nor with <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/article/2024/jul/22/prom-6-halle-orchestra-and-choirs-mark-elder-review">Mark Elder’s cerebral take</a> on the same symphony in last year’s Proms. From the expertly phrased funeral march trumpet call onwards, wind playing was exceptional, as were quieter passages more generally. The strings caressed the Adagietto’s lingering phrases and Mäkelä brought fine swagger and propulsion to the rondo-finale. As an interpretation, though, it never quite established itself.</p><p>Unexpectedly, Luciano Berio’s Rendering, which preceded the Mahler, fared better. This substantial three-movement piece feeds some of Schubert’s late symphonic sketches through Berio’s fertile and ingenious late 20th-century sensibility. The result, especially when it is as well done as it was here, is fresh and exploratory, as Schubertian melodies modulate into Berio’s mysterious fragments and colours. If the test of a good performance is that it stays in the head, then this one did just that.</p><p>The same was true of <a target="_blank" href="https://www.janinejansen.com/">Janine Jansen</a>’s account of Prokofiev’s first violin concerto on the following day. Jansen commanded the performance, her playing technically dazzling and musically intense, with Mäkelä and the RCO providing impeccably unobtrusive accompaniment.</p><p>Finally, hats off to Mäkelä for opening the second concert with an elegantly played example of something that has become too much of a <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/proms">Proms</a> rarity in recent years – a Mozart symphony, in this case the D major “Paris”.</p></div>

            <div><p>The Last Dinner Party pulled out of their set at Portsmouth’s Victorious festival at the weekend after Irish band the Mary Wallopers saw their set cut short after saying “free Palestine and fuck Israel”.</p><p>On Friday, the Mary Wallopers walked onstage and unveiled a Palestinian flag alongside their opening remarks. Video appeared to show a crew member confronting the band about the flag, which was draped on the stage, and then removing it. After calls from the band and the crowd of “free, free Palestine”, the sound was cut. The band briefly retrieved the flag to cheers.</p><p>A representative for the festival initially said that the show was cut short after the band used “a chant which is widely understood to have a discriminatory context”.</p><p>On Instagram, the Mary Wallopers disputed this, posting footage of the incident. “The festival have released a misleading statement to the press claiming they cut our sound because of a discriminatory chant and not the band’s call to Free Palestine. Our video clearly shows a Victorious crew member coming on stage, interfering with our show, removing the flag from the stage and then the sound being cut following a chant of ‘Free Palestine’. The same crew member is later heard in the video saying ‘you aren’t playing until the flag is removed’.</p><p>“We completely reject Victorious’ portrayal of today’s events and request that they retract their statement immediately.”</p><p>Victorious put out a subsequent statement apologising for the situation. “We are in the business of putting on great shows, not cutting them off and this is the last thing we wanted, for the band, their fans and ourselves. We didn’t handle the explanation of our policies sensitively or far enough in advance to allow a sensible conclusion to be reached. This put the band and our own team in a difficult situation which never should have arisen. We would like to sincerely apologise to all involved.</p><p>“We absolutely support the right of artists to freely express their views from the stage, within the law and the inclusive nature of the event. Our policy of not allowing flags of any kind, which has been in place for many years for wider event management and safety reasons, is not meant to compromise that right.”</p><p>The organisers accepted the band’s version of the events and said they would be making “a substantial donation to humanitarian relief efforts for the Palestinian people”.</p><p>In response to the Mary Walloper’s set being pulled, British band the Last Dinner Party cancelled their scheduled Saturday performance at the festival. “We are outraged by the decision made to silence the Mary Wallopers yesterday at Victorious,” they posted on Instagram. “As a band we cannot cosign political censorship and will therefore be boycotting the festival today.”</p><figure></figure><p>The decision also drew condemnation from US band <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/vampire-weekend">Vampire Weekend</a>, who went ahead with their performance at Victorious on Saturday night. Frontman Ezra Koenig told the crowd: “If someone was punished for flying a flag, that is wrong and they deserve an apology. The terrible suffering of the Palestinian people deserves all of our sympathy.”</p><p>Additionally this weekend, the BBC explained that it had “mutually agreed” with Reading and Leeds headliner Hozier ahead of the festivals that it would not broadcast his set. Onstage, the Irish musician called for a free Palestine and a “meaningful political solution for the kind of violence we’ve been seeing on our TV screens over the last two years – not lip service, but a meaningful peace process”.</p></div>
