Its follow-up a year later, “(What’s the Story) Morning Glory?” — featuring a trio of enduring tracks, “Wonderwall,” “Don’t Look Back in Anger” and “Champagne Supernova” — was a smash on both sides of the Atlantic. Five more albums followed from 1997 to 2008.</p><p>Still, the band’s forays into the United States <a target="_blank" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/06/28/arts/music/oasis-liam-noel-gallagher-reunion.html" title="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/06/28/arts/music/oasis-liam-noel-gallagher-reunion.html">didn’t match its peaks at home</a>.

Cups of beer rocketed into the air. The crowd gathered in front of the stage bobbed in an ecstatic, near unified mass.<span>  </span></p></div><div><p><img alt="" src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/09/04/multimedia/04CUL-AUDIENCE-OASIS-03-zwmj/04CUL-AUDIENCE-OASIS-03-zwmj-threeByTwoMediumAt2X-v2.jpg" /><img alt="" src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/09/04/multimedia/04CUL-AUDIENCE-OASIS-04-zwmj/04CUL-AUDIENCE-OASIS-04-zwmj-threeByTwoMediumAt2X-v2.jpg" /></p></div><div><p>Liam Gallagher, dressed in a trademark parka and sunglasses, shook maracas and a tambourine with an amusingly menacing air.

Some of these NFL odds include Chiefs vs. Chargers (+3), Buccaneers vs. Falcons (+2.5), Dolphins vs. Colts (-1) and Steelers vs. Jets (+2.5). There are just two contests with Week 1 NFL spreads of over a touchdown, including when No. 1 overall pick Cam Ward makes his pro debut as his Titans are 8.5-point underdogs to the Broncos, tying them as the biggest underdogs with the Cowboys (+8.5) to the Eagles in the 2025 NFL Kickoff Game.</p><p>Whatever NFL betting trends you decide to follow for the opening slate of games, you certainly want your football bets to kick off the 2025 NFL season to start off on the right note.

Joe Flacco will be under center for Cleveland, and the 40-year-old has lost three straight starts to Cincinnati. Meanwhile, Joe Burrow led the league in both passing yards (4,918) and passing touchdowns (43) a year ago as he became the third player in NFL history to have at least 4,500 yards, 40 touchdowns and fewer than 10 interceptions. After signing both Ja'Marr Chase and Tee Higgins to extensions this offseason, the league's No. 1 passing offense from a year ago returns intact.</p><p>Cincy's passing game, alone, may put more points on the game than Cleveland, which ranked dead-last in scoring in 2024. Cleveland struggled in all facets, with the last-ranked third-down offense, committing the second-most turnovers, and having bottom-five rankings in both rushing offense and redzone scoring. Plus, the Browns' defense slipped considerably from the unit which led the NFL in yards allowed in 2023 as Cleveland ranked 27th in points allowed in 2024. The model projects Cincy (-5.5) to win by more than a touchdown and cover well over 50% of the time. <a href="https://www.sportsline.com/insiders/nfl-odds-lines-spreads-2025-week-1-picks-predictions-from-proven-model/#ttag=07102025_agg_cbssports_picks_football_nfl_model_Week1NFLodds" target="_blank">See which other teams to pick here</a>.</p>
<p>Another one of its Week 1 NFL predictions: the Packers (-2.5, 47.5), fresh off acquiring Micah Parsons, cover at home versus the Lions. The line has moved one point in favor of Green Bay since the Parsons trade news broke The <a target="_blank" href="https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/WAS/washington-commanders/">Commanders</a> may have revealed the blueprint to exploiting Detroit, courtesy of Washington's road playoff win last season. Jared Goff was often pressured, which led to him turning the ball over four times, and few teams apply pressure or create takeaways quite like Green Bay. It ranked fourth in turnovers created a year ago, and just seven teams racked up more sacks, despite the Packers blitzing at the second-lowest rate in the league.</p><p>One also can't forget the offseason attrition for Detroit, which lost both of its coordinators, as well as three-time All-Pro center Frank Ragnow. The Packers, meanwhile, added the one thing it was missing in a No. 1 wideout by drafting Matthew Golden in the first round. The model projects him to make an immediate impact by leading the Packers in receiving in Week 1, while Green Bay's defense has both more sacks and more takeaways than Detroit on defense. With that, the Packers (-2.5) cover nearly 60% of the time, with the Over (47.5) hitting in well over 50% of simulations. <a href="https://www.sportsline.com/insiders/nfl-odds-lines-spreads-2025-week-1-picks-predictions-from-proven-model/#ttag=07102025_agg_cbssports_picks_football_nfl_model_Week1NFLodds" target="_blank">See which other teams to pick here</a>.</p>
<h3>How to make Week 1 NFL picks</h3><p>The model has also made the call on who wins and covers in every other game on the Week 1 NFL schedule and just revealed three underdogs that outright win, potentially giving you a huge payday. <a href="https://www.sportsline.com/insiders/nfl-odds-lines-spreads-2025-week-1-picks-predictions-from-proven-model/#ttag=07102025_agg_cbssports_picks_football_nfl_model_Week1NFLodds" target="_blank">You can only get every pick for every game at SportsLine</a>.</p><p><strong>So what NFL picks can you make with confidence, and which three teams should you lock in now?

<p>On Labor Day, first-year <a target="_blank" href="https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/DAL/dallas-cowboys/">Dallas Cowboys</a> head coach Brian Schottenheimer gathered his players. With just three days remaining until his team's season opener against the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/PHI/philadelphia-eagles/">Philadelphia Eagles</a>, the coach, as he recalled, gave a fiery and excited speech about playing the reigning <a target="_blank" href="https://cbssports.com/nfl/superbowl/">Super Bowl</a> champions in primetime on Thursday in the <a target="_blank" href="https://cbssports.com/nfl/">NFL</a> Kickoff Game.</p><p>He immediately regretted it.</p><p>"I went to bed that night," Schottenheimer recalled Tuesday. "I was like, 'What are you doing? You know better than that.' Every game we play is just another championship opportunity. It's just another championship opportunity. We get a chance to go out there against the Eagles. You don't get extra credit for beating the Eagles in Philly on primetime than you do for beating the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/NYG/new-york-giants/">Giants</a> at noon in AT&amp;T Stadium."</p><p>While what Schottenheimer said is technically true, the numbers say that no <a target="_blank" href="https://cbssports.com/nfl/teams/">NFL team</a> can benefit more from a victory in Week 1 than Dallas.</p>
<p>The SportsLine Projection Model, which simulates every NFL game 10,000 times and went 31-15 on top-rated picks in 2024, has already crunched the numbers on the 2025 season. According to the model, the Cowboys, who went 7-10 a year ago and missed the playoffs, enter the season with a 17.9% chance of making the playoffs. However if Dallas, which is a 8.5-point underdog against Philadelphia, can pull off an upset against the champs, the Cowboys' chances of making the postseason would jump to 28.5%. That's the biggest leap any team in the league could make, based on the model's projections.</p><table><tbody><tr><td><br /></td><td>CHANCES OF MAKING THE PLAYOFFS</td><td><br /></td><td><br /></td></tr><tr><td>TEAM</td><td>CURRENT</td><td>AFTER WIN</td><td>DIFFERENCE</td></tr><tr><td>Dallas Cowboys</td><td>17.9%</td><td>28.5%</td><td>10.6%</td></tr><tr><td>Atlanta Falcons</td><td>17.0%</td><td>27.1%</td><td>10.1%</td></tr><tr><td>San Francisco 49ers</td><td>62.0%</td><td>72.1%</td><td>10.1%</td></tr><tr><td>New York Jets</td><td>18.9%</td><td>28.5%</td><td>9.6%</td></tr><tr><td>Miami Dolphins</td><td>36.4%</td><td>45.7%</td><td>9.3%</td></tr></tbody></table><p>By contrast, the model does not think a win by the Eagles would affect their playoff chances significantly. Philadelphia already has a 91.0% chance to reach the postseason, and that number would move to 91.9% with a victory over Dallas. The 0.9% differential is tied for the lowest of any team in Week 1.</p><p>In short, the Cowboys have significantly more to gain on Thursday night than the Eagles do.</p><p>Of course Dallas has a tall task against the defending champs. Philadelphia has won the last 14 games started and finished by quarterback <a target="_blank" href="https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/2240246/jalen-hurts/">Jalen Hurts</a>, including the playoffs. Last season, the Eagles blew out the Cowboys twice, 34-6 and 41-7. </p><p>Philadelphia running back <a target="_blank" href="https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/2185957/saquon-barkley/">Saquon Barkley</a> is coming off a season in which he led the league in rushing (2,005 yards) while running for 13 touchdowns. On Thursday, he will face a Dallas defense that allowed 137.1 rushing yards per game last season, the fourth most in the NFL.</p><p>But Schottenheimer doesn't want his players to put more emphasis on this game than any other.</p><p>"What I don't these guys to do, and I think the coaches are a big part of this, is go in there and try so hard," he said. "'We're playing the Eagles. I'm going to do so hard.' They're going to make mistakes if they do that. Play free. It's football. Fly around. Love be around your brothers. Just run to the football. Celebrate. Have fun."</p>

        <p>The season isn't quite over yet. I have your attention still. Whatever is left for you to wring out of the waiver wire is well spoken for already, so how about a change of pace? Let's start talking 2026. </p><p>And let's do it in the most reckless way imaginable, by predicting a bunch of things that ... eh, probably won't be correct. </p><p>But they'll at least be <em>directionally</em> correct. I'm exaggerating to drive home a point, in other words, but with the important caveat that the exaggeration is at least within the realm of possibility. That's what makes for a <strong>bold</strong> prediction, and that's the most enjoyable kind of prediction this far out. </p><p>You wanna get nuts? Let's get nuts! </p><h2> 	<a target="_blank" href="https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/players/29426033/nick-kurtz/fantasy/">Nick Kurtz</a> is the top first baseman drafted and <em>still</em> goes too low </h2><p>This one won't seem so bold by the time we're actually drafting, but sitting here in early September, it may not have occurred to you just how well the rookie rates at one of the most star-studded positions. Kurtz is a distant No. 1 in Head-to-Head points per game and is No. 1 outright in Rotisserie since reaching the majors on April 23 --  and that's in spite of a miserable first month in which he hit .208 with a .558 OPS. We've seen high draft picks with collegiate experience steamroll the minors only to meet with a harsh dose of reality upon reaching the majors (looking at you, <a target="_blank" href="https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/players/29153543/wyatt-langford/fantasy/">Wyatt Langford</a>), but Kurtz has thrived in a way that seems almost effortless. Detractors will point to his high strikeout rate and say correction is coming to his batting average, but I think the correction will be to the strikeout rate itself, making Kurtz a possible Triple Crown threat. </p>
<h2> 	<a target="_blank" href="https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/players/2507333/shane-bieber/fantasy/">Shane Bieber</a> places in the top five in Cy Young voting </h2><p>Part of me wants to say top three, but since I'm already penciling <a target="_blank" href="https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/players/3126008/tarik-skubal/fantasy/">Tarik Skubal</a> and <a target="_blank" href="https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/players/2836763/garrett-crochet/fantasy/">Garrett Crochet</a> into two of those spots, I want to leave myself a little wiggle room. Top five should be <strong>bold</strong> enough for a pitcher in his first full year back from Tommy John surgery, particularly one who only had a 3.80 ERA in his last meaningful sample. It's the meaningless sample in between that has me so bullish. That 3.80 ERA led to Bieber working with Driveline Baseball prior to 2024 to regain some of the velocity he had lost since winning a Cy Young in 2020, and it seemed to translate, seeing him strike out 20 in 12 innings prior to succumbing to Tommy John surgery. The velocity bump has held post-surgery, and the results have been sparkling as well. Bieber will be on an expiring contract for the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/teams/TOR/toronto-blue-jays/">Blue Jays</a> in 2026, so I doubt they'd blink at him taking on a full workload, even so soon after surgery. </p><h2> The <a target="_blank" href="https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/teams/BAL/baltimore-orioles/">Orioles</a> reach the postseason </h2><p>Despite being one of the most disappointing teams this year, the Orioles still have ample reason for optimism, beginning with their strong offensive nucleus. <a target="_blank" href="https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/players/3152104/gunnar-henderson/fantasy/">Gunnar Henderson</a>, <a target="_blank" href="https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/players/3117469/adley-rutschman/fantasy/">Adley Rutschman</a>, and <a target="_blank" href="https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/players/28920005/jackson-holliday/fantasy/">Jackson Holliday</a> all endured some growing pains while <a target="_blank" href="https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/players/26615346/jordan-westburg/fantasy/">Jordan Westburg</a> struggled to stay on the field, but I don't think anyone is counting them out from reaching their full offensive potential. And now <a target="_blank" href="https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/players/26912463/samuel-basallo/fantasy/">Samuel Basallo</a> and <a target="_blank" href="https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/players/29075533/dylan-beavers/fantasy/">Dylan Beavers</a> are part of the equation. I would have said coming into the year that the Orioles didn't have the pitching to compete, but they've since seen <a target="_blank" href="https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/players/2835065/trevor-rogers/fantasy/">Trevor Rogers</a> return to form and <a target="_blank" href="https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/players/2932284/kyle-bradish/fantasy/">Kyle Bradish</a> return to health. They'll presumably go hard after a front-line starter in the offseason, having been humbled by this lost season. </p><h2> And so do the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/teams/ATL/atlanta-braves/">Braves</a> </h2><p>Unlike the Orioles, the Braves had all the pitching they needed at the start of the year, but were operating with four automatic outs in their lineup. They knowingly punted at shortstop with <a target="_blank" href="https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/players/2836533/nick-allen/fantasy/">Nick Allen</a>, but then had to replace a suspended <a target="_blank" href="https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/players/1796123/jurickson-profar/fantasy/">Jurickson Profar</a> with table scraps while <a target="_blank" href="https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/players/3167984/michael-harris/fantasy/">Michael Harris</a> and <a target="_blank" href="https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/players/2167464/ozzie-albies/fantasy/">Ozzie Albies</a> fought through debilitating slumps. The second half has shown what their offense can be with everyone up to their usual form -- and that was true even before they replaced Allen with <a target="_blank" href="https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/players/26608279/ha-seong-kim/fantasy/">Ha-seong Kim</a>. Unfortunately, by the time the offense got going, <a target="_blank" href="https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/players/1762602/chris-sale/fantasy/">Chris Sale</a>, <a target="_blank" href="https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/players/26911687/spencer-schwellenbach/fantasy/">Spencer Schwellenbach</a>, and <a target="_blank" href="https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/players/2135253/grant-holmes/fantasy/">Grant Holmes</a> were lost to injury. Sale has since returned, and Schwellenbach should be fine for 2026. How much the Braves get from <a target="_blank" href="https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/players/2837573/spencer-strider/fantasy/">Spencer Strider</a> and <a target="_blank" href="https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/players/2165932/reynaldo-lopez/fantasy/">Reynaldo Lopez</a> moving forward is anybody's guess, but I think, like the Orioles, they'll look to add an arm in the offseason, having more funds to work with after resetting their luxury tax penalty this year. </p>
<h2> Ozzie Albies bounces back as a top five second baseman </h2><p>Here's one of the many ways 2026 figures to be better than 2025 for the Braves. Ozzie Albies was one of their four automatic outs in the first half, going that whole time without a single homer from the right side of the plate. Historically, he's only needed to tread water from the left side. It's his dominance from the right side that would bring his numbers in line. Seeing his platoon splits that far out of whack makes me more hopeful it's something he can correct, like a mechanical flaw, when before I worried he may be a casualty of a shifting league environment. Already, we're seeing evidence of that with his two homers from the right side in the second half. Hitting coach Tim Hyers has also suggested that Albies was <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/athletic/6583330/2025/08/28/braves-hitting-coach-tim-hyers-progress/" target="_blank">still afflicted by last year's fractured wrist</a> until recently, offering more reason to believe that his sudden turnaround is a more permanent return to form. </p><h2> 	<a target="_blank" href="https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/players/3077711/noelvi-marte/fantasy/">Noelvi Marte</a> has more Head-to-Head points than <a target="_blank" href="https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/players/26912505/elly-de-la-cruz/fantasy/">Elly De La Cruz</a> </h2><p>Go <strong>bold</strong> or go home, right? This isn't meant as a knock on De La Cruz, who's still firmly part of the first-round discussion, and I wouldn't dare suggest that Marte could finish ahead of him in a 5x5 categories league (such as Rotisserie), where his stolen bases are more impactful and his strikeouts are of no consequence. In Head-to-Head points, though, where strikeouts do count for something, the gap may be enough to tip the scales in Marte's favor, but that's only if he's a masher in his own right. I think he can be. He has the exit velocities for it and makes contact at a nice rate for a player who can hit the ball in excess of 115 mph.  He's also a capable base-stealer, his sprint speed measuring in the 88th percentile. The fact is that Marte is capable of impacting the game in more ways than De La Cruz (if not to the same extent), and while it may never quite elevate him to first-round status, it could bring him pretty close. </p><h2> 	<a target="_blank" href="https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/players/2942981/brice-turang/fantasy/">Brice Turang</a> hits 25 home runs </h2><p>This prediction would seem <strong>bolder</strong> if Brice Turang hadn't just hit 10 home runs in August. If he does that again in September, well, he's at 27 for 2025, putting him past the threshold that I'm <strong>boldly</strong> predicting here. But of course, no one is thinking he'll do that. It was a stretch to think he might hit 10 home runs <em>in an entire season</em> prior to him doing it in that one month, and lightning doesn't strike twice. One development that may have gone unnoticed prior to Turang's big August, though, is how much harder he's hitting the ball this year. His average and max exit velocities are both up more than 3 mph from last year, which is a huge leap. It wasn't translating to power because his swing was geared for hitting line drives the other way, but that's what changed in August. His pull-air rate exploded, and if that remains his approach going forward, his new exit velocities will make power inevitable. A 25-homer season for a former 50-steal guy? Just how high does the upside go here? </p>
<h2> 	<a target="_blank" href="https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/players/29086560/ben-rice/fantasy/">Ben Rice</a> hits over .290 with an OPS over .900 </h2><p>All I'm doing here is saying that Rice is exactly who Statcast makes him out to be. His Baseball Savant page is lit up by bright red bars that read 94th percentile or better in all the major hitting metrics, such as xBA (.293) and xSLG (.576). If he just lives up to those, he meets this prediction easily. </p><figure><p><img alt="ben-rice-stats.jpg" src="https://sportshub.cbsistatic.com/i/r/2025/09/04/5dcc934b-d2de-421d-b669-c6f6b7210da6/resize/670x377/b60ff20b5e632eab279b62d926be8e6f/ben-rice-stats.jpg" /></p><figcaption><span>
                                                                    via Baseball Savant
                                                            </span></figcaption></figure><p>Of course, he wouldn't be the first hitter to routinely fall short of Statcat's expectations, but we've learned this year that a low pull-air rate can usually explain such shortfalls. Rice excels there, too, his 26.5 percent rate placing him in the 93rd percentile. The 26-year-old is everything you could want a hitter to be, right down to him batting left-handed at Yankee Stadium, and as a full-time first baseman next year (one with catcher eligibility, no less), he should achieve his final form. </p><h2> At least five catchers score more Head-to-Head points than <a target="_blank" href="https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/players/1947839/j-t-realmuto/fantasy/">J.T. Realmuto</a> had in his best season </h2><p>I'm using Realmuto as a frame of reference because he was long considered the gold standard at catcher, routinely drafted No. 1 at the position. The most Head-to-Head points he ever scored in a season were 441.5 in 2019. <a target="_blank" href="https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/players/2933037/cal-raleigh/fantasy/">Cal Raleigh</a> has already topped that number this year, and <a target="_blank" href="https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/players/2822087/william-contreras/fantasy/">William Contreras</a> is on pace to thanks to his second-half surge. Let's pencil them in for 2026 as well, but who else? </p>
<p>Well, Ben Rice would easily meet the mark if he meets my bold prediction for him (see above). <a target="_blank" href="https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/players/26911639/hunter-goodman/fantasy/">Hunter Goodman</a> probably doesn't have the plate discipline for it, projecting for 412 points (along with 32 homers and 95 RBI) even in a year when everything has gone right. <a target="_blank" href="https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/players/29075524/drake-baldwin/fantasy/">Drake Baldwin</a>, though, presents a near flawless hitting profile and will presumably take on a bigger portion of catching responsibilities next year. <a target="_blank" href="https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/players/29085042/agustin-ramirez/fantasy/">Agustin Ramirez</a> and Samuel Basallo both offer massive upside and project to take a big step forward. <a target="_blank" href="https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/players/29155728/kyle-teel/fantasy/">Kyle Teel</a> has begun to flash real potential of his own, and I'm not ruling out a return to form for Adley Rutschman, who scored 463.5 points in 2023. That's not even mentioning standbys like <a target="_blank" href="https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/players/1666825/will-smith/fantasy/">Will Smith</a>, <a target="_blank" href="https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/players/3117480/shea-langeliers/fantasy/">Shea Langeliers</a>, <a target="_blank" href="https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/players/1793168/salvador-perez/fantasy/">Salvador Perez</a>, <a target="_blank" href="https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/players/2829012/yainer-diaz/fantasy/">Yainer Diaz</a>, and, yes, Realmuto. Bottom line is that the position has so much to offer than in those days when Realmuto stood atop the rankings, and I only see it getting better. </p><h2> Spencer Strider bounces back with 200-plus strikeouts </h2><p>The bloom is fully off the rose now. Only once in his past six starts has Strider struck out more than three batters, putting together an 8.16 ERA during that time and marking his return from elbow surgery as a big enough dud that he may never recover from it. </p><p>But I think he will. It's easy to forget that he had a seven-start stretch earlier this year with a 2.53 ERA, 1.08 WHIP, and 12.2 K/9. Things were looking up then, mostly on the strength of a slider that still rates as one of the best of the game. The problem is that he has nothing to go with it but a fastball, which itself rated as an elite pitch before the injury. It has since lost some velocity and, more notably, its characteristic "rising" effect that causes hitters to swing underneath it. Strider is aware of this and, for one start on Aug. 25, seemed to recapture that shape after working with Maven Baseball Lab in Atlanta. It'll take more time in the lab this offseason for that change to stick, probably, but at least there's proof of concept. And if Strider works to expand his arsenal as another potential safeguard, even better. </p>
<h2> 	<a target="_blank" href="https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/players/2211754/dylan-cease/fantasy/">Dylan Cease</a> shaves two runs off of his ERA </h2><p>Maybe a 2.81 ERA, which is what this prediction would translate to at this particular moment, is a touch optimistic, but this is a <strong>bold</strong> prediction, after all. Cease did have a 2.20 ERA in 2022, so a 2.81 mark is in the realm of the reasonable. The bottom line is that I don't think anything is actually wrong with him. His strikeout rate is still fourth-best among qualifiers. His walk rate, while not good, is in line with career norms. What we've seen from Cease this year is the typical variance that accompanies a pitcher with good stuff but bad control. You could basically sum up his whole career this way. It's why his past four seasons have alternated between Cy Young-caliber and not so good. Just playing the odds, then, you'd bet on his ERA settling back into the mid-threes, where it was last year and where all the estimators say it should be now. Getting to the high twos from there isn't a big leap. </p><h2> 	<a target="_blank" href="https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/players/29075759/roman-anthony/fantasy/">Roman Anthony</a> leads the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/teams/BOS/boston-red-sox/">Red Sox</a> in home runs </h2><p>This is a bet on talent as much as anything. We know Anthony impacts the ball like an elite slugger, placing behind only <a target="_blank" href="https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/players/2822182/oneil-cruz/fantasy/">Oneil Cruz</a>, <a target="_blank" href="https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/players/2071264/aaron-judge/fantasy/">Aaron Judge</a>, <a target="_blank" href="https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/players/2901324/shohei-ohtani/fantasy/">Shohei Ohtani</a>, and <a target="_blank" href="https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/players/2135243/kyle-schwarber/fantasy/">Kyle Schwarber</a> in average exit velocity. It's just a matter of him actualizing that power by angling the ball off the bat properly. This was the read on him in the minors as well, and it didn't stop him from being the consensus top prospect at the time of his promotion. Already, we were seeing him make strides with six homers in his final 21 games before suffering a season-ending oblique injury, and looking over the Red Sox's roster, he seems like the most reasonable bet for 30-plus homers next year, regardless of his pace this year. </p><h2> 	<a target="_blank" href="https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/players/2449444/bryan-reynolds/fantasy/">Bryan Reynolds</a> gets traded and goes on to deliver his best OPS in five years </h2><p>Reynolds is the hitter version of Dylan Cease in that there's little in the underlying data to explain why he's been so much worse this year, which inclines me to believe it's just one of those things. "Variance" would be the more sophisticated way of putting it. If you want to harp on his strikeout rate being his highest since 2020, fair enough, but his expected stats, which take strikeout rate into account, are virtually identical to last year. In short, Statcast thinks he should be hitting .272 and slugging .474, which is more or less the player we've always known him to be. The reason I'm saying "best in five years" is because his .912 OPS in 2021 (incidentally, the year after his other high-strikeout season) is unlikely to be repeated. Then again, we've never seen him play for a team with something to play for, so a trade could propel him to new heights. </p>
<h2> 	<a target="_blank" href="https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/players/2173411/matthew-boyd/fantasy/">Matthew Boyd</a>, <a target="_blank" href="https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/players/2836515/andrew-abbott/fantasy/">Andrew Abbott</a> both have an ERA over 4.00 </h2><p>I have to go negative with one of these predictions, don't I? A certain pitcher phenotype has excelled in a way that's unique to 2025. I'd define it as a left-hander who doesn't throw especially hard, doesn't miss bats at an above-average rate, and doesn't put the ball on the ground nearly as much as you'd want given those shortcomings. But he does throw a lot of strikes and induces mostly weak contact. Normally, I'd say such a pitcher could be serviceable in Fantasy, but with pronounced ERA concerns. Something about the league environment this year, though, has allowed that phenotype to play beyond its capabilities, with Boyd (2.94 ERA) and Abbott (2.65 ERA) being the most prominent examples. </p><p>The biggest lesson I've learned in the past four years is that the way the ball is playing one year won't necessarily be the way it plays the next, so identifying those one-off environmental darlings and fading them in drafts would seem to be the wisest course of action. </p><h2> 	<a target="_blank" href="https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/players/29085946/jakob-marsee/fantasy/">Jakob Marsee</a> has more combined home runs and stolen bases than <a target="_blank" href="https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/players/2932710/jarren-duran/fantasy/">Jarren Duran</a> </h2><p>This prediction is performing double duty. On the one hand, it's acknowledging that Duran is much more beatable in this metric than he might have seemed a year ago. A combined 40 homers and steals may be all it takes, and frankly, that's more believable than the combined 55 he had in 2024, a year that wrung out every last bit of the production he has to offer. But this prediction is also expressing confidence in Marsee, a top minor-league performer who never rated as much of a prospect because of subpar exit velocity readings but who has continued to do the same things that got him called to the majors in the first place, namely working the count, running with reckless abandon, and directing the ball to the shortest part of right field. He's capable of impacting the game in so many ways that even if he falls short in one area, he's likely to be of value still. </p>
<h2> 	<a target="_blank" href="https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/players/29321958/luke-keaschall/fantasy/">Luke Keaschall</a> leads all second basemen in OPS </h2><p>Before I address Keaschall specifically, let me remind you that a certain fellow named <a target="_blank" href="https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/players/1963334/ketel-marte/fantasy/">Ketel Marte</a> still plays second base, and Marte is presently enjoying his second straight year (and fourth overall) with an OPS over .900. I don't think Keaschall is as good of a hitter as Marte. He simply doesn't impact the ball the same way.  But what may put him slightly ahead is the O in OPS, on-base percentage. It's going to be tough because Marte himself is great at drawing walks, but Keaschall has a chance to be even better. He reached base at a .420 clip in the minors last year and is so far at .404 in the majors. </p><p>So is this prediction a technicality? What about leagues where walks don't matter? Fortunately, Keaschall has also shown himself to be a prolific base-stealer, as was also true in the minors. And to be clear, he has the ability to put the ball in the bleachers, too. He just relies more on hitting it at the proper angles than Marte does. </p><h2> 	<a target="_blank" href="https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/players/2835064/shane-baz/fantasy/">Shane Baz</a> blossoms into an ace </h2><p>Even though the full-season line for Baz is sorely lacking, there have been flashes this year, from the two double-digit strikeout efforts in April to the four-start stretch with a 2.30 ERA, 1.02 WHIP, and 9.9 K/9 in June and July. They serve as little reminders of the potential that made him arguably the top pitching prospect in baseball prior to needing Tommy John surgery in 2022. Unfortunately, he's still searching for the put-away pitch he lost with the procedure. He's shelved his once dominant slider almost completely in 2025, finding occasional success with a curveball and cutter instead, and that willingness to tinker, combined with his peak velocities and pedigree, is why I remain hopeful. With the way this season has gone, I suspect he'll redouble his efforts to rediscover his slider in the offseason. </p>
<h2> 	<a target="_blank" href="https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/players/29644503/payton-tolle/fantasy/">Payton Tolle</a> wins AL Rookie of the Year </h2><p>I'm planting my flag in this one early. One start is all it took to convince me Tolle will join with Garrett Crochet to form maybe the fiercest 1-2 punch in all of the American League. His fastball looks like it's on a ramp, inducing feeble swings as it soars through the top of the zone at 98 mph. He has no trouble locating it either, throwing 67 percent of his pitches for strikes in the minors this year. He also stands an intimidating 6-feet-6 and flashes a menacing stare every time he notches a strikeout. </p>
<p>It's everything I could hope for in a young pitcher, and seeing as he stormed through three levels of the minors this year -- compiling a 3.04 ERA, 0.99 WHIP, and 13.1 K/9 along the way -- I don't feel like I'm speaking too soon here. Rookie of the Year is harder to win for pitchers than hitters, given that their reps are often limited, but Tolle's sheer dominance may be enough to vault him ahead of the defensively challenged Samuel Basallo. </p><h2> 	<a target="_blank" href="https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/players/2821278/jonathan-aranda/fantasy/">Jonathan Aranda</a> doubles his home run total </h2><p>Another year, another Jonathan Aranda bold prediction. What makes the tradition different this year is that there can be no denying he's good anymore. He made the All-Star team and is likely to finish 2025 with a batting average north of .300 and an OPS north of .850. The one area where he still has ground to gain is home runs, and while I don't yet know the exact number that I'm asking him to double, the point is that I'm comfortable projecting him to be in the 25-30 range, which is how he was pacing his last few years in the minors. He has the exit velocities for it. He has the pull-air rate for it. Statcast right now has him as one of the biggest underachievers in slugging percentage, with his actual mark trailing his expected mark by nearly 50 points. </p>
<h2> 	<a target="_blank" href="https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/players/26912475/jacob-lopez/fantasy/">Jacob Lopez</a> outperforms <a target="_blank" href="https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/players/2933069/joe-ryan/fantasy/">Joe Ryan</a> </h2><p>This isn't meant as a slight to Ryan, who has emerged as a borderline Cy Young candidate this year by rounding out his usual low WHIP and high strikeout rate with a solid ERA. The reason for the comparison is that I think Lopez has a lot in common. Both were passed over as prospects because of marginal velocities, even as they racked up high strikeout totals in the minors. The key for both has been a similar arm angle and low induced vertical break. In short, the unfamiliar shape of the fastball helps it play beyond its velocity. Only when Ryan was promoted to the majors at age 25 did he convince evaluators it was no fluke, and Lopez's rookie season (at age 27) has played out similarly, seeing him strike out nine or more five times in just 17 starts. </p>

<p>The National League West-leading <a target="_blank" href="https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/teams/LAD/los-angeles-dodgers/">Los Angeles Dodgers</a> look to break out of their funk and avoid a sweep when they visit the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/teams/PIT/pittsburgh-pirates/">Pittsburgh Pirates</a> on Thursday for the finale of their three-game series. Los Angeles (78-61), which owns a 2 1/2-game division lead over the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/teams/SD/san-diego-padres/">San Diego Padres</a> (76-64), has lost four of its last five contests after having dropped 9-7 and 3-0 decisions in Pittsburgh.</p><p>The Dodgers hope to salvage the finale behind <a target="_blank" href="https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/players/2006996/blake-snell/">Blake Snell</a> (3-3, 2.41 ERA), who lost three of his five starts in August despite allowing three runs or fewer in each outing. However, the 32-year-old left-hander recorded at least eight strikeouts three times in that span.</p><p>Los Angeles' task will be a difficult one as Pittsburgh, which has won four of its last five contests, counters with ace <a target="_blank" href="https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/players/29153541/paul-skenes/">Paul Skenes</a> (9-9, 2.05). The 23-year-old right-hander is coming off back-to-back victories in which he registered 13 strikeouts over 13 innings and was superb against the Dodgers earlier this season, scattering five hits while fanning nine batters across 6 1/3 frames en route to victory.</p><p><span><a target="_blank" href="https://www.cbssports.com/betting/news/best-betting-apps/">Top sportsbooks</a></span> have set the total strikeouts props for both Snell (Over -156, Under +119) and Skenes (Over -118, Under -112) at 6.5. The SportsLine Projection Model, which simulates every <a target="_blank" href="https://cbssports.com/mlb/">MLB</a> game 10,000 times, rates Skenes' Over 6.5 strikeouts prop as a 3-star play on its 5-star scale and Snell's Over 6.5 as a 2.5-star play.</p><p>However, the model has found better value <a href="https://www.sportsline.com/mlb/" target="_blank">on Thursday's six-game schedule</a>, as there are two pitcher strikeout player props that it has rated at 4.5 stars, including one that returns plus money, and one at 4 stars. Here they are:</p>
<h3>Kyle Hendricks Over 2.5 strikeouts (+110) vs. Royals (7:40 p.m. ET)</h3><p>Rating: 4.5 stars<br /><a href="https://www.sportsline.com/mlb/game-forecast/MLB_20250904_LAA@KC/prop-picks/" target="_blank">Model projection: 3.5 strikeouts</a></p>
<p>Hendricks has fanned only two batters in each of his last two starts but has posted his best strikeout numbers this year on the road. The 35-year-old righty recorded a season-high nine strikeouts against the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/teams/NYY/new-york-yankees/">Yankees</a> in New York and struck out six at both Cleveland and Detroit. Kansas City enters Thursday with the lowest strikeout total in the majors (945) this campaign but whiffed eight times in Wednesday's loss to the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/teams/LAA/los-angeles-angels/">Angels</a>. Hendricks has gone Over this projected total in each of his four career starts against the Royals and fanned four over five innings in his turn against them last year.</p>
<h3>Ranger Suarez Over 4.5 strikeouts (-135) vs. Brewers (4:10 p.m. ET)</h3><p>Rating: 4 stars<br /><a href="https://www.sportsline.com/mlb/game-forecast/MLB_20250904_PHI@MIL/prop-picks/" target="_blank">Model projection: 5.4 strikeouts</a></p>
<p>Suarez is looking to bounce back from an outing against the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/teams/ATL/atlanta-braves/">Atlanta Braves</a> in which he recorded only two strikeouts over five innings. The 30-year-old Venezuelan left-hander reached double digits in each of his previous two turns, fanning 10 across 6 2/3 frames versus the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/teams/SEA/seattle-mariners/">Seattle Mariners</a> and 11 over seven innings against the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/teams/WAS/washington-nationals/">Washington Nationals</a>. Suarez has registered five or more strikeouts in eight of his nine starts on the road this season, averaging 6.1 in those contests.</p>
<h3>Carlos Rodon Over 5.5 strikeouts (-101) vs. Astros (7:40 p.m. ET)</h3><p>Rating: 4.5 stars<br /><a href="https://www.sportsline.com/mlb/game-forecast/MLB_20250904_NYY@HOU/prop-picks/" target="_blank">Model projection: 6.3 strikeouts</a></p>
<p>Rodon hasn't recorded more than five strikeouts in any of his last five starts but has had good success against the Astros over his career. The 32-year-old southpaw has fanned 64 batters across 64 2/3 innings in 11 outings versus Houston and struck out 11 over 10 2/3 frames in two meetings last season. The Astros have the third-fewest amount of strikeouts in the American League this year but have whiffed at least eight times in each of their last four games.</p>
