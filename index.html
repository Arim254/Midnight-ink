I got you. “My man!” This is the moment in the film where Isaiah White, played by Marlon Wayans, is going to teach Cameron Cade, played by Tyriq Withers a lesson in how to be a great quarterback. In this lesson, I did a lot of research about quarterback drills that hone in on specific skills. For example, in a pro game, you want to be able to get the ball out of your hands under two seconds. So that’s why we have two seconds on the clock and to work on that speed that’s required of decision making. That’s why he’s turned away from the actual receivers. He has his eyes closed. So that you’re forced into a panic-like situation, and you have to throw the ball as quickly as possible. So what I really wanted to communicate in this scene specifically, was that there’s going to be a big tonal shift from something’s off to something’s very wrong, and it’s the first time we’re going to introduce violence and a dynamic between the two characters that becomes much more like a narcissistic, abusive relationship than a mentor-mentee “Too slow.” But seed it and bury that under the guise of hazing and just being a rookie. And what I landed on was this idea of using this JUGS machine to be that conduit of punishment. I also didn’t want him to have time to process anything. That’s why I kind of try to get music and a rhythm going in the edit. And even the sound design is rhythmic. That vibration and metallic clanking, it escalates and grows and grows over this entire sequence. And then we have these really tight, extreme close-ups of Cameron Cade’s eyes. And that was just a creative choice I made to rely on the language of horror, where there’s a classic peekaboo.</p></dd></dl></div></div></div>

Now, the model has revealed its top Chiefs vs. Chargers NFL player prop picks: </p><p><strong>Best Friday Night Football player prop picks for Week 1:<br /></strong></p><ul><li>Patrick Mahomes, Chiefs, Over 245.5 passing yards (-125)</li><li>Ladd McConkey, Chargers, Over 71.5 receiving yards (-114)</li><li>Isiah Pacheco, Chiefs, Under 50.5 rushing yards (-114)</li></ul><p>Parlay these picks for +535 odds (risk $100 to win $534) at <a href="https://martech.cbssports.com/bt/redirect/prod?b=draftkings&amp;c=sport" target="_blank">DraftKings</a> (odds subject to change)</p><h2>Patrick Mahomes, Chiefs, Over 245.5 passing yards (-111)</h2><p>The model is projecting Mahomes to top 283 yards passing, which gives us approximately 40 yards in wiggle room vs. his over/under. Also consider that the Chiefs' star quarterback has topped this total in six of his last eight games against the Chargers. Considering that Kansas City may struggle to run against Los Angeles' defensive line, it's conceivable to think that Mahomes may be asked to carry a heavier load in the passing game in Week 1. </p><h2>Ladd McConkey, Chargers, Over 71.5 receiving yards (-114)</h2><p>In his rookie season, McConkey topped 71 yards in six of his last seven games, including an impressive 9-197-1 performance in the Chargers loss to Houston in the AFC Wild Card playoff game. In his one appearance against the Chiefs in 2024, the 6'0" receiver posted a 5-67-1 line but should see double-digit targets on Friday night. The model projects him at 92.9 yards, which is more than 20 yards above the oddsmakers' yardage line.</p><h2>Isiah Pacheco, Chiefs, Under 50.5 rushing yards (-114)</h2><p>The Chiefs were held below four yards per carry in their two games against Los Angeles last season. The model is projecting Kansas City's No. 1 running back to rush for 38.6 yards, well below his sportsbook total. With Kareem Hunt as the primary pass catching back, any second half deficit could keep Pacheco on the bench for long stretches and limit his chance to top 50 yards rushing.</p><h2>Want more Week 1 NFL picks?</h2><p><strong>You've seen the model's NFL picks for Chiefs vs. Chargers player props for Week 1.

The preseason Heisman Trophy favorite <a target="_blank" href="https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/news/arch-mannings-heisman-trophy-odds-plummet-after-dreadful-first-start-against-ohio-state-no-longer-favorite/">suddenly has heaps of ground to make up</a> after he ceded frontrunner status to <a target="_blank" href="https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/teams/LSU/lsu-tigers/">LSU's</a> <a target="_blank" href="https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/players/26701706/garrett-nussmeier/">Garrett Nussmeier</a>.</p><p>Those stars from the top-10 matchups were far from the only Heisman hopefuls to make statements, for better or worse, in <a target="_blank" href="https://cbssports.com/college-football/">college football's</a> loaded opening week. The race for the sport's highest individual honor could not be more wide open with so much season left to be played, but every game counts, and each data point has long-term implications in the process of determining who hoists the trophy in December.</p><p>The upcoming Week 2 slate is significantly lighter on marquee matchups, but that does not mean the next batch of games is unimportant in defining the road to glory.

The second-year LSU starter and reigning SEC completions leader went 28-for-38 for 230 yards and a touchdown against Clemson and capped off his night with what proved to be the decisive score: an 8-yard touchdown pass to <a target="_blank" href="https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/players/29390367/treydez-green/">Trey'Dez Green</a>.</p><p>Nussmeier entered the Tigers vs. Tigers clash tied with Clemson's Cade Klubnik on the odds board and gained meaningful separation from him with a noticeably better performance. Stacking up ranked wins like that one would not only keep the potential first-round pick in front of the Heisman pack, but it would also finally cement LSU as a real national championship contender in Year 4 of the Brian Kelly era.</p><p>The early stages of the season allow for big leaps up the odds board, and it was a good week to be a victorious quarterback. Utah dazzled in a rout of <a target="_blank" href="https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/teams/UCLA/ucla-bruins/">UCLA</a>, and dual-threat transfer Devon Dampier looked the part of a quarterback who could lead his team to a Big 12 title. He misfired just four times on 25 pass attempts, ran for 87 yards and found the end zone three times -- twice through the air and once on the ground. The market loved what it saw. Dampier's Heisman odds improved twofold from +5000 to +2500 in the matter of just one game.</p>
<p>Dampier was the most dramatic riser, but a bevy of other quarterbacks made leaps worthy of recognition, too. Georgia's Gunner Stockton passed for two touchdowns and ran for two more to become the second-steepest climber behind Dampier. John Mateer, Carson Beck and Jackson Arnold all lived up to their transfer hype at their respective schools. LaNorris Sellers looked like a certified playmaker for South Carolina. And the Dante Moore era is off and running at Oregon in style.</p><h2>Stock down: Defensive battle hurts Manning, Ohio State</h2><p>The Manning hype dwindled quickly. He and the Texas offense are far, far away from being a lost cause, though. One bad game against what may very well be the best defense in <a target="_blank" href="https://cbssports.com/college-football/">college football</a> <a target="_blank" href="https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/news/resetting-arch-mannings-expectations-at-texas-in-2025-after-steve-sarkisian-says-hype-was-out-of-control/">should not be cause for massive concern</a>, particularly because it came on the road in Manning's first outing as a full-time starter. His poor timing and head-scratching overthrows and underthrows do not have to define his season.</p><p>On the other side of that No. 1 vs. No. 3 showdown, it was not as though Ohio State's individual standouts got off to a hot start, either. Julian Sayin looked very much like a redshirt freshman making his first career start against an equally formidable defense, and for the second time in as many years, Jeremiah Smith was only a modest factor against the Longhorns. Neither bolstered their Heisman candidacy despite what was a gargantuan team result.</p>
<p>Heisman voters will want to see more from Cade Klubnik the rest of the year, too. While he seemed down the stretch of the 2024 season to assuage the concerns surrounding his performance against top competition, <a target="_blank" href="https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/news/clemsons-dabo-swinney-calls-out-cade-klubnik-says-biggest-problem-vs-lsu-was-best-player-didnt-play-well/">he faltered in his first test of 2025</a>. The 50% completion rate and interception he logged against LSU were reminiscent of his struggles against Georgia a year ago and <a target="_blank" href="https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/teams/ND/notre-dame-fighting-irish/">Notre Dame</a> the season prior.</p><figure><p><img alt="Texas v Ohio State" src="https://sportshub.cbsistatic.com/i/r/2025/09/03/9d1dd8df-62de-4707-b613-ddfea5d58f60/resize/670x377/3d798bad3e7496115e9579737954ddfb/arch.jpg" /></p><figcaption><span>Texas quarterback Arch Manning is no longer the Heisman favorite after last week's loss to Caleb Downs and Ohio State. </span><span>

Week 2 is, um, a bit lighter on big-time showdowns. No. 15 <a target="_blank" href="https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/teams/MICH/michigan-wolverines/">Michigan</a> and No. 18 Oklahoma will take center stage in a game that carries significant Heisman implications, though.</p><h3>John Mateer vs. Michigan</h3><p>Okay, John Mateer, you ripped an FCS defense to shreds. Now show us what you have against almighty Michigan. Mateer's Oklahoma debut was historic. He set the school record for most passing yards in a debut with 392 against <a target="_blank" href="https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/teams/ILST/illinois-state-redbirds/">Illinois State</a> to go with three touchdowns, 24 rushing yards and another score on the ground. But the looming Wolverines are about as different of a beast as there is in college football. This is exactly the kind of game that Brent Venables brought Mateer in from <a target="_blank" href="https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/teams/WASHST/washington-state-cougars/">Washington State</a> for, and it is precisely the type of all-eyes-on-me opportunity he needs to make a statement in front of Heisman voters.</p>
<h3>Dante Moore vs. <a target="_blank" href="https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/teams/OKLAST/oklahoma-state-cowboys/">Oklahoma State</a></h3><p>Dante Moore's last start against a Power Four opponent came in Nov. 2023, and he threw two interceptions in that game. This week will show how much growth he made in his developmental year at Oregon. Another good outing to open his starting stint with the Ducks would be a solid first step in proving he is a different player from the one that began his career at UCLA as an underwhelming five-star freshman. Oklahoma State's is a nice, soft defense to help him ease into Power Four action.</p><h3>Sam Leavitt vs. <a target="_blank" href="https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/teams/MISSST/mississippi-state-bulldogs/">Mississippi State</a></h3><p>Arizona State heads to SEC country for the second leg of a home-and-home with Mississippi State -- the one opponent that truly had Sam Leavitt's number in 2024. The Bulldogs were the only team to hold the breakout star to fewer than 150 yards and one of just three to keep him out of the end zone through the air. Now, he did set a career high with two rushing scores in the win, but 69 passing yards against Mississippi State? <em>That</em> Mississippi State? The trendy Heisman dark horse needs a better effort in the rematch.</p>

        <p>The <a target="_blank" href="https://www.cbssports.com/wnba/teams/GS/golden-state-valkyries/">Golden State Valkyries</a>' historic debut season reached new heights on Thursday when they clinched a playoff spot with an 84-80 win over the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.cbssports.com/wnba/teams/DAL/dallas-wings/">Dallas Wings</a>. The Valkyries are the first expansion team in WNBA history to make the playoffs in their inaugural season. </p><p>When the Wings jumped out to a 10-0 lead in the opening minutes, it looked like it might not be the Valkyries' night. But as they've done all season long, the Valkyries found a way to overcome adversity. They battled back in the second half and went ahead for good on a <a target="_blank" href="https://www.cbssports.com/wnba/players/29362928/carla-leite/">Carla Leite</a> bucket with 2:26 remaining. When the final buzzer sounded, streamers fell from the rafters and the team celebrated at midcourt. </p>
<p>The Valkyries, the first expansion team to join the league since the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.cbssports.com/wnba/teams/ATL/atlanta-dream/">Atlanta Dream</a> in 2008, faced plenty of questions after their expansion draft back in December, in which they favored hard-working veterans over younger players with potential. As it turned out, the front office led by Ohemaa Nyanin and coaching staff led by Natalie Nakase knew exactly what they were doing. </p><p>A tough schedule over the first few weeks led to a 2-5 start, but since then the Valkyries have been one of the league's best teams despite a parade of injuries. <a target="_blank" href="https://www.cbssports.com/wnba/players/28850640/veronica-burton/">Veronica Burton</a> is the only player on the roster who has played in every game thus far, and 19 different players have appeared in a game. Most notably, leading scorer <a target="_blank" href="https://www.cbssports.com/wnba/players/26678082/kayla-thornton/">Kayla Thornton</a> went down with a season-ending knee injury shortly after becoming the first All-Star in franchise history. </p>

They don't have a healthy player averaging more than 11.9 points per game this season, and they have the worst offensive rating (102.3, ninth in the league) of any team currently in playoff position. </p><p>The Valkyries have managed to exceed expectations thanks to an elite defense. They lead the league in field goal defense, and are holding opponents to just 40.4% from the field, which would be the be lowest opponent field goal percentage since the 2020 Seattle Storm (40.1%). Overall, the Valkyries rank third in defensive rating (99.7). </p><a href="https://www.cbssports.com/wnba/news/how-the-valkyries-created-an-unmatched-wnba-home-court-advantage-and-why-expectations-are-high-in-ballhalla/" target="_blank">

<p>Off the court, the Valkyries have also excelled. In March, the they became the first team in WNBA history to sell 10,000 season tickets. All 20 of their home games have been sold out, and their average attendance of 18,064 not only leads the league, but is also on pace to be an all-time record. At home in Ballhalla, the team's nickname for the Chase Center, the Valkyries are 13-7 with a plus-8.8 net rating. </p>
<p>The Valkyries have set a high bar for the wave of expansion teams set to follow them. The Portland Fire and Toronto Tempo will join next season, followed by yet unnamed franchises in Cleveland (2028), Detroit (2029) and Philadelphia (2030), which will bring the league to 18 teams.</p>
