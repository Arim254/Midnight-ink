The network could also likely be used for espionage.</p>   \n   <p>According to the Secret Service, there were over 300 SIM servers, 100,000 SIM cards, and other illicit materials found in multiple sites in the tristate area surrounding New York City. Secret Service agents are working alongside the New York Police Department and other law enforcement agencies including Homeland Security Investigations to conduct forensic analysis on the devices. Matt McCool, the special agent in charge of the U.S. Secret Service Washington field office, said forensic investigation has already revealed the involvement of at least one foreign nation, as well as several bad actors already known to law enforcement.</p>   <p>McCool said the investigation is ongoing and that the agency made the decision to share information about the threat with the public in the early stages \"to safeguard critical infrastructure.\"</p>   <p>The investigation comes at a time when U.S. national security officials and private sector experts are<a href=\"https://2021-2025.state.gov/office-of-the-spokesperson/releases/2025/01/u-s-takes-action-against-prc-linked-cyber-actors-for-treasury-hack-and-salt-typhoon/\" target=\"_blank\"> tracking ongoing breaches</a> of telecommunications companies, aiming to steal private communications of senior U.S. government officials including President Trump. The group responsible, often referred to as Salt Typhoon, has been linked to the Chinese government. The campaign was first disclosed last year.</p>   <p>The U.S. Secret Service did not say whether the devices uncovered in New York had any connection to Salt Typhoon operations. However, McCool insisted the investigation of this cache was kicked off after picking up on earlier, specific telecommunications-related threats.</p>   \n   <p>\"Following multiple telecommunications-related imminent threats directed towards senior U.S. government officials this spring, the Secret Service began a protective intelligence investigation to determine the extent and impact these threats could have on protective operations,\" McCool said.</p>   <p>If the network of devices was intended to disrupt or spy on the U.N. General Assembly, it wouldn't be the first time that the diplomatic gathering, which attracts more than 100 foreign officials and their staffs, has been targeted. Former intelligence officials <a href=\"https://codeanddagger.com/news/2017/9/19/un-general-assembly-is-superbowl-of-espionage-ex-spy-says\" target=\"_blank\">have described the occasion</a> as \"the Super Bowl of espionage.\" If the massive cache of devices was used to shut down cellphone networks and potentially impair emergency communications, that would go beyond what might be an expected level of monitoring and spying.</p>   <p>However, it's unclear how long the network of devices was in operation around New York City, and whether its operators were hoping to disrupt the geopolitical gathering, rather than spying or organizing criminal activity in the area.<br /></p>\n</div>"

The president said he wanted to see justice served. </p>   <p>\"We can't delay any longer, it's killing our reputation and credibility,\" <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2025/08/08/nx-s1-5496468/justice-department-escalates-its-campaign-against-trumps-perceived-political-enemies\" target=\"_blank\">he wrote</a>.</p>   <p>What Trump said couldn't wait are criminal investigations of his most prominent critics: former FBI Director Jim Comey, New York Attorney General Letitia James, and California Democratic Sen. Adam Schiff. </p>   \n   <p>His post emerged only hours after the top federal prosecutor in northern Virginia left his job under pressure. Erik Siebert had worked closely with Trump's top DOJ leaders this year, but he concluded he could not seek criminal charges the president wanted against James.</p>   <p>Now Lindsey Halligan, who had been serving as a special assistant to the president, was sworn in Monday as U.S. attorney for the Eastern District of Virginia, though she has no prosecutorial experience. Most recently, she's been helping Trump remove what he calls \"improper ideology\" from the Smithsonian museums.</p>   <p>\"This attorney general sent a memo on Day 1 that made it clear that Justice Department lawyers were the president's lawyers, and we are now seeing how that's playing out and how dangerous it is — how it disintegrates the rule of law,\" Stacey Young, a former DOJ attorney who now leads a group called Justice Connection that helps Justice Department workers, said of Attorney General Pam Bondi.</p>   <p>Already this year <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2025/07/31/nx-s1-5484932/layoffs-at-the-department-of-justice-are-transforming-its-workforce\" target=\"_blank\">thousands of employees have left the Justice Department</a> through dismissals and forced resignations. Nearly all of the public integrity unit is gone, as are three in four lawyers in the civil rights division. </p>   <p>Many people inside the department are afraid, Young said. After all, she said, if the president is willing to fire a prosecutor for not pursuing his enemies, <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2025/07/30/nx-s1-5476311/trump-fired-workers-justice-department\" target=\"_blank\">anybody at the department could get fired</a>. </p>   \n   <p>White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said Trump was understandably frustrated with lawmakers and state officials who investigated him.</p>   <p>\"The president is fulfilling his promise to restore a Department of Justice that demands accountability, and it is not weaponizing the Department of Justice to demand accountability for those who weaponize the Department of Justice,\" Leavitt said.</p>   <p>The Justice Department has traditionally operated with some measure of distance from the White House on criminal investigations. But that distance seems to have closed this year in a way that feels different to longtime observers.</p>   \n   <p>During the presidency of Richard Nixon, public servants at the DOJ felt squeezed between what the president wanted and what the law required. But even Nixon was not as clear and open as Trump is now about what he wanted to happen.</p>   <p>\"In this situation you have a president who is openly, brazenly bragging about his ability to seek retribution against his political enemies,\" said George Washington University law professor Stephen Saltzburg.</p>   <p>Saltzburg said it looks as if the Trump White House is insisting career prosecutors use their power to make life hell for people who challenge Trump — and on the other side of the coin, to drop investigations or pardon people who support the president, including <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2025/02/18/nx-s1-5299906/justice-department-trumps-allies-cases\" target=\"_blank\">the people who rioted at the U.S. Capitol</a> four years ago.</p>   <p>Trump's political appointees took an oath to support and defend the Constitution when they arrived on the job. That oath may soon be put to the test, if it hasn't already, Harvard law professor Jack Goldsmith <a href=\"https://executivefunctions.substack.com/p/how-should-a-doj-political-appointee\" target=\"_blank\">wrote recently in his newsletter Executive Functions</a>. </p>   <p>\"The Article II truism about presidential power cannot justify continued service to a president and administration openly indifferent to law,\" Goldsmith wrote. \"That is an issue of personal and professional ethics and integrity.\"</p>   \n   <p>Federal prosecutors decide which defendants to charge, and when and where. But there are still some outside checks on that power. In recent weeks, <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2025/09/05/nx-s1-5526925/as-trump-cracks-down-on-d-c-crime-grand-juries-emerge-as-a-check-on-overreach\" target=\"_blank\">grand juries in Washington, D.C.,</a> have refused to indict people, and magistrate judges have turned away requests for search warrants. </p>   <p>That skepticism, which followed the federal occupation of D.C., may carry over into other cases. Take the claims by Trump's critics of <a href=\"https://www.congress.gov/crs-product/LSB11326\" target=\"_blank\">selective or vindictive prosecution</a>, for example.</p>   <p>In the past, there's been a very high bar to succeed in court on that allegation. But now that Trump is so open about his demands, judges may think differently.</p>   \n   <p>\"I think the president's announcement of what he wants the Justice Department to do is so out of line with our history of promoting equal justice under law and fairness that I don't think that any federal judge is going to look at this and be happy about what the president is doing,\" Saltzburg said.</p>\n</div>"

    "body": "<div>\n      <p>A handful of states led by Democrats could have attempted mid-decade redistricting to counter President Trump's push in GOP-led states, but aside from California, they have been slow to act.</p>   \n</div><div>\n    <p>AILSA CHANG, HOST: </p><p> President Trump has repeatedly called for Republican-led states to redraw their congressional districts before next year's midterms. Texas did so, Missouri's new map awaits the governor's signature, and leaders in Florida and Indiana are openly discussing it. Democratic-led states have mostly been slow to act in response. Colorado Public Radio's Bente Birkeland reports from her state.</p><p>BENTE BIRKELAND, BYLINE: California voters will decide this November whether to temporarily bypass their independent redistricting commission to draw five more blue seats. And in August, Governor Gavin Newsom made a plea. He asked blue states to join California's fight against GOP gerrymandering.</p><p>(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)</p><p>GAVIN NEWSOM: We need to stand up. Not just California. Other blue states need to stand up.</p><p>(CHEERING)</p><p>NEWSOM: We need to be firm. And I resolve...</p><p>BIRKELAND: But that hasn't happened. Democratic governors in already-gerrymandered states like Illinois and Maryland have said everything's on the table, but haven't made any moves. Then there's Colorado. Like California, it has an independent redistricting commission. Multimillionaire businessman Kent Thiry helped spearhead the movement in those two states. He says this national partisan battle is like his worst nightmare coming true.</p><p>KENT THIRY: Anyone who treasures representative democracy and the fragility of representative democracy has to be just horrified at what is happening right now.</p><p>BIRKELAND: Thiry says even though he doesn't want Colorado to follow California's lead...</p><p>THIRY: I am not critical of those who have decided that right now they're in a gunfight and you can't unilaterally disarm. I respect that logic, I just won't be an active part of it.</p><p>BIRKELAND: In Colorado, Democrats control state government and hold both U.S. Senate seats, but the House delegation is four Democrats and four Republicans. Some political observers say, in theory, it wouldn't be that hard to draw two more seats favorable to Democrats. However, Colorado Governor Jared Polis told progressive podcaster Brian Tyler Cohen that it's impossible to change how the state draws congressional lines before the midterm election.</p><p>(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)</p><p>JARED POLIS: Our state constitution has a process. That cannot be amended in an off year. So there is no mechanism to go to the ballot this year, like California is doing.</p><p>BIRKELAND: That means 2026 is the earliest something could get on the ballot. But changing how Colorado redistricts to make it partisan isn't an idea Polis seems to support. And he doesn't think voters would, either.</p><p>(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)</p><p>POLIS: They see through this. And swing voters, unaffiliated voters really don't like this kind of sheer arrogance.</p><p>BIRKELAND: Polis says he thinks Democrats can flip seats by focusing on other things, like the impact of Trump's massive tax and spending bill.</p><p>(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)</p><p>POLIS: This is going to be an albatross around the neck of all the Republicans that voted for it.</p><p>BIRKELAND: But outside of Colorado's political establishment, some on the left do want to fight back. Jorge Rodriguez is an accountant from the northern part of the state. He's trying to put a question on the 2026 ballot to allow Colorado to draw more blue seats. Rodriguez says his idea gained traction after he posted about it on Reddit.</p><p>JORGE RODRIGUEZ: Kind of frustrated why Democratic leaders in Colorado are not trying to do anything. They're just playing it silent.</p><p>BIRKELAND: Rodriguez's idea still faces hurdles. The ballot title hasn't been approved, and then backers would need to raise money to get enough signatures to put it before voters and launch a statewide campaign. Rodriguez himself voted for Colorado's independent commission back in 2018.</p><p>RODRIGUEZ: I don't regret it, but in light of what's going on right now nationally, I - you know, things can change. And things have changed.</p><p>BIRKELAND: But if change happens in Colorado - and that's a big if - the state will have to wait until after 2026.</p><p>For NPR News, I'm Bente Birkeland in Colorado.</p><p>(SOUNDBITE OF HERMANOS GUTIERREZ'S \"AMAR Y VIVIR\")</p>\n    <p>Copyright © 2025 NPR.

This month, an international UN commission concluded Israel has committed genocide in Gaza, an accusation Israeli officials reject.</p>   <p>Some Democratic leaders have also distanced themselves from Mamdani <a href=\"https://www.zohranfornyc.com/platform\" target=\"_blank\">because of his progressive stance on economic policies</a>, including a call for a rent freeze, free childcare, and higher taxes for the wealthy and corporations.</p>   <p>\"Socialism does not work and his proposed plans would make New York a less competitive city and state,' <a href=\"https://x.com/Tom_Suozzi/status/1967543930846650392\" target=\"_blank\">said Rep.

Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, a Democrat who represents parts of the Bronx and Queens, and Sen. Bernie Sanders, an independent from Vermont.</p>   \n   <p>But two of the country's most powerful Democrats, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer and House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, both from New York, have so far declined to back Mamdani's bid to lead the nation's largest city.</p>   <p>The chair of New York's state Democratic Party, <a href=\"https://x.com/npfandos/status/1968730967943581877\" target=\"_blank\">Jay Jacobs, also released a statement</a> earlier this month saying he would refuse to back Mamdani because of their sharply differing views on Israel and other policy issues. </p>   <p>\"I reject the platform of the so-called 'Democratic Socialists of America' and do not believe that it represents the principles, values or policies of the Democratic Party,\" Jacobs wrote.</p>   <p>Polls show Mamdani holds a commanding lead in the mayor's race against a packed field that includes current Mayor Eric Adams, former Democratic Governor Andrew Cuomo and Republican Curtis Sliwa.  </p>   <p><a href=\"https://sri.siena.edu/2025/09/09/new-york-times-siena-poll-new-york-city-mayoral-race/?_gl=1*1l734sv*_ga*MTU5MzUxNTA5Mi4xNzU4NjMyNDgx*_ga_XN3VDZ9ZYZ*czE3NTg2MzI0ODAkbzEkZzAkdDE3NTg2MzI0ODAkajYwJGwwJGgw\" target=\"_blank\">A Sept. 9 survey by the Siena Research Institute</a> found Mamdani at 46 percent in a four-way race,  with Cuomo in second place at 24 percent, Sliwa at 15 percent and Adams with 9 percent. </p>   <p>Some Democrats who back Mamdani have been fiercely critical of party leaders who've stayed on the sidelines. After Jacobs announced that he wouldn't endorse his party's candidate, state Senator Mike Gianaris called the decision \"disgraceful.\"</p>   <p>\"The chair of the Democratic Party refusing to support the candidate clearly selected by the voters of the Democratic Party,\" <a href=\"https://x.com/SenGianaris/status/1968734432602227150\" target=\"_blank\">Gianaris wrote on the social media platform X</a>. \"If he won't perform that most basic responsibility of a party leader, what exactly is he doing over there?\"</p>\n</div>"

    "body": "<div>\n      <p>Hundreds of thousands of conservatives attended right wing activist Charlie Kirk's memorial service. Many now wonder who will fill the shoes of this influential voice in the conservative movement.</p>   \n</div><div>\n    <p>AILSA CHANG, HOST: </p><p> Yesterday, tens of thousands of people gathered at State Farm Stadium in Glendale, Arizona, for the memorial of Charlie Kirk. The right-wing activist founded the conservative youth organization Turning Point USA at the age of 18, and he was a major figure in Republican politics when he was killed at the age of 31. Many in the MAGA world are now sorting through what is next for his movement. NPR political reporter Elena Moore joins us now from Phoenix, Arizona. Hi, Elena.</p><p>ELENA MOORE, BYLINE: Hey, Ailsa.</p><p>CHANG: OK, let's start with Turning Point USA. Where might that group go without Charlie Kirk, you think?</p><p>MOORE: It's a really complicated question to answer because so much of Turning Point's draw was built on Kirk's own personality and leadership. They're big shoes to fill, and no single person can replace him, says Turning Point spokesman Andrew Kolvet.</p><p>ANDREW KOLVET: I think that would be the worst way to analyze this situation. The right way to analyze this situation is to say, what can I do? And I will tell you, it's the total refrain in the office right now. It's like, what would Charlie have wanted in this moment?</p><p>MOORE: And he told me that Kirk's team is stepping up, you know, led by his widow, Erika Kirk, who was named the new CEO of Turning Point last week.</p><p>CHANG: Yeah, Erika Kirk has been really thrown into the spotlight now. Like, do we have a sense of what kind of leader she might be?</p><p>MOORE: Well, she's no stranger to the public eye or the Turning Point movement. She already had a large social media following before Kirk's death, talking about her Christian faith and her family, but she appears to also be a very skilled messenger, especially on those ideas. That was especially clear during her speech at the memorial, when she emphasized Kirk's work with young people especially, and told young men to, quote, \"accept Charlie's challenge and embrace true manhood.\"</p><p>(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)</p><p>ERIKA KIRK: Be strong and courageous for your families. Love your wives and lead them.</p><p>MOORE: And she also made this point.</p><p>(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)</p><p>KIRK: Your wife is not your slave. She is your helper. You are not rivals.</p><p>MOORE: And, you know, she had several notable moments, even at one point saying she forgave the young man who is accused of killing Charlie Kirk, her husband, bringing many people to tears. So it's clear she's already had some impact. But again, Turning Point is not expecting her to push their larger message alone. Notably, since Kirk died, we've seen some of the most prominent voices in the MAGA world step in to host his show nearly every day. And now many are also expected to speak as part of Turning Point's college tour, which Kirk had just kicked off when he was killed.</p><p>CHANG: OK, so lots of attention from top conservative voices, but is that translating to the grassroots level, where Kirk first had an impact?</p><p>MOORE: I think supporters and staff are hopeful. Turning Point has had tens of thousands of inquiries from young people looking to get involved or start chapters. But even outside the organization, we've seen young people ramp up their own efforts to keep Kirk's style of campus debate alive. Twenty-five-year-old content creator Cam Higby is - he's part of a small group that decided to travel together to different campuses, visiting campuses. And I talked to them while they were on the road, and here's how he described their goals.</p><p>CAM HIGBY: Show them you're not afraid, it's OK to talk to people who disagree with you, and honor Charlie. Those are the - I think, the three tiers of what we're trying to accomplish.</p><p>MOORE: We're also just going to start seeing more activism inspired by Kirk, I think. I talked to several young people at his memorial who said they're pushing themselves to be less afraid of sharing their political views, even if that means, Ailsa, losing friends. One young woman told me that Kirk gave her a voice, but now she has to, quote, \"stand up for herself.\"</p><p>CHANG: That is NPR's Elena Moore in Phoenix, Arizona. Thank you so much, Elena.</p><p>MOORE: Good to be with you.</p>\n    <p>Copyright © 2025 NPR.  All rights reserved.

    "body": "<div>\n      <p>NPR's Mary Louise Kelly talks with the conservative podcaster Michael Knowles, who was a friend of Charlie Kirk's and will headline tonight's show of The American Comeback Tour as a tribute to Kirk.</p>   \n</div><div>\n    <p>MARY LOUISE KELLY, HOST: </p><p> Tens of thousands of people gathered yesterday in Arizona to remember conservative activist Charlie Kirk. Among them, Kirk's widow, Erika Kirk. She has now taken the reins at the organization he helped found - Turning Point USA. Last night, she spoke of her husband's mission and of forgiveness for the man who killed him.</p><p>(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)</p><p>ERIKA KIRK: I forgive him because it was what Christ did and is what Charlie would do.</p><p>KELLY: One of the people committed to continuing Kirk's legacy is the conservative podcaster Michael Knowles. He was scheduled to join Kirk tonight at a Turning Point USA event at the University of Minnesota. Instead, he is now headlining the event alone. Michael Knowles, welcome, and I'm sorry for the loss of your friend.</p><p>MICHAEL KNOWLES: Oh, thank you very much. I appreciate it. And it's good to be with you.</p><p>KELLY: I know you were there at this big memorial service in Arizona yesterday. What will you take from that? What was your impression?</p><p>KNOWLES: It was striking in so many ways. Charlie's widow, Erika, gave one of the most powerful speeches I've ever heard, as we just heard a clip of. It was a magnificent expression of Christian charity and forgiveness. And to see all of these hardened politicians show up and proclaim a beautiful gospel message was something that in previous ages would not have been unusual in our country, but these days is rare. And so it was just remarkable and uplifting in so many ways.</p><p>KELLY: May I ask, do you share that spirit of forgiveness that Erika Kirk so eloquently expressed?</p><p>KNOWLES: I do. I think she exhibited it in really a superhuman way. But with whatever I can muster, I certainly agree with it. And of course, this does not come to the exclusion of justice. You know, the civil authority has the right and the responsibility to carry out justice. But we should not hate our enemies.</p><p>KELLY: So I do need to note that President Trump also spoke last night. He took a rather different approach and a different tone. He said - and he was speaking of Charlie Kirk - he said...</p><p>(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)</p><p>PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: He did not hate his opponents. He wanted the best for them. That's where I disagreed with Charlie. I hate my opponent. And I don't want the best for them. I'm sorry.</p><p>KELLY: Michael Knowles, is that helpful in this moment?</p><p>KNOWLES: I think it is because it was a joke. And it was understood to be a joke in the room. He even...</p><p>KELLY: He didn't sound like he was joking.</p><p>KNOWLES: I think he did. I think - he said afterward, he said, Charlie's looking down at me. He's angry at me for saying that. Maybe Erika can talk to me. I think it was an expression of humility, of a fall in human nature, and, by contrast, pointing to the alternative and saying, you know, what Erika and Charlie were talking about - that's the right thing. Maybe someday I'll get there.</p><p>KELLY: So let me turn you to tonight. I mentioned you will be headlining this event. I saw your post on social media that you plan for this to be a tribute. And you said, the enemies of civilization will not succeed at killing his mission. They will not even succeed at killing his tour. What will be your message tonight, and have you changed it at all because of what's happened?</p><p>KNOWLES: Well, I'm certainly reacting to Erika's beautiful speech and really what was a beautiful event yesterday. But the substance of it remains the same. You know, Charlie went out into hostile places where people really hated him, and he had a civil dialogue with them. He was always generous. He was always respectful. He would argue with his friends and he would be generous and respectful. And we're going to do that, and we're going to encourage people who disagree to come to the front of the line.</p><p>KELLY: Stay with us for a minute and the idea that people, especially those who disagreed, are welcome at these events and welcome in conversation because Charlie Kirk, your friend, has been portrayed as an advocate of free speech, of engaging with people who held really different political views than he did. What do you think he would have made of some of the developments of recent days? I'm thinking of Attorney General Pam Bondi's attack on hate speech or of the chair of the FCC, Brendan Carr, threatening TV stations with fines or with losing their license if they continue to carry Jimmy Kimmel's show.</p><p>KNOWLES: Well, I certainly wouldn't presume to speak for Charlie. You know, Charlie ran his course. And I find it unseemly to try to speak for the dead. We do know he publicly opposed the idea of hate speech. And so I think that was an unfortunate phrase. Now, of course, there are plenty of kinds of speech. There are...</p><p>KELLY: But he said even that is protected by the First Amendment.</p><p>KNOWLES: Well, something called hate speech, but that's not - as Charlie observed, that's not even a legal concept in America. Certain hateful ideas can be debated, but certain things are unlawful, like direct threats, incitement to violence and all the rest. So that certainly should be prosecuted in order to defend the free marketplace of ideas. But distasteful ideas can be debated, certainly.</p><p>As for the FCC, I won't presume to speak for Charlie on the issue other than to observe the FCC exists for a reason, is to regulate the public airwaves and to give licenses and to revoke licenses from corporations that use them. So there's nothing wrong in principle, and it's actually the responsibility of the government in principle, to regulate those airwaves. And in terms of the specific incident of Jimmy Kimmel, it seems to me that came much more from the affiliates canceling him over his repugnant lie about the assassination of Charlie rather than any government pressure.</p><p>KELLY: Well, and I can play what he actually said.</p><p>(SOUNDBITE OF TV SHOW, \"JIMMY KIMMEL LIVE!\")</p><p>JIMMY KIMMEL: We hit some new lows over the weekend with the MAGA gang desperately trying to characterize this kid who murdered Charlie Kirk as anything other than one of them and doing everything they can to score political points from it.</p><p>KELLY: That's what he actually said.</p><p>KNOWLES: And that was a lie. That was a lie because the alleged shooter was on the left. I'm not surprised that the affiliates wanted to cancel his show.</p><p>KELLY: I guess I'm interested. You know, we've just been talking about President Trump's remarks last night, which you interpreted as a joke. Some other people may hear that and disagree strongly. But you're defending the use of humor, even in a situation like last night. Do you also defend the right of someone to use humor on television even if you really don't like what they said?</p><p>KNOWLES: I'm certainly fine defending Jimmy Kimmel's bad jokes. But what I take issue with is not his joke that came at the end of that monologue. What I take issue with is his lie that said that the assassin who murdered Charlie Kirk was on the right rather than on the left, in - contrary to all of the available evidence.</p><p>KELLY: Just want to note, I don't think he said he was on the right. Can I turn us to something else? Tonight, do you have concerns about security?</p><p>KNOWLES: It's always prudent to be a little bit concerned, especially with all of this violence. I myself have been targeted by left-wing violence. So we're concerned, but we're taking it seriously. And more importantly, I think it would greatly dishonor Charlie's legacy if we cowered, if we let them silence us. So that will not happen. And if Charlie's friends can muster even an iota of the courage that he demonstrated, I think that will do him some honor, and I think it would be very salutary for the country.</p><p>KELLY: Michael Knowles. He hosts \"The Michael Knowles Show,\" and tonight, as you heard, he's headlining Charlie Kirk's American Comeback Tour with an event at the University of Minnesota. Thank you.</p><p>KNOWLES: Wonderful to be with you. Thank you for having me.</p><p>(SOUNDBITE OF RENE AUBRY'S \"WATER FALLS\")</p>\n    <p>Copyright © 2025 NPR.  All rights reserved.

Harris believes she was loyal to the Bidens, but says the feeling wasn't mutual</strong></h3>   <p>Loyalty is one of the underlying themes in Harris' book. It's even laid out in one of the introduction quotes before the memoir begins from Kendrick Lamar's \"DNA\": \"I got loyalty, got royalty inside my DNA.\"</p>   \n   <p>Harris writes of times that Biden, his family and his senior staff in the West Wing questioned whether Harris truly was loyal, while her own frustrations mounted from the president's staff not speaking up to defend her from outside criticism. </p>   <p>In the tumultuous weeks after Biden's disastrous debate performance last summer — when high-profile Democrats began to question his ability to beat Trump — first lady Jill Biden pulled aside Harris' husband, Second Gentleman Doug Emhoff, to ask if they were standing by the Bidens. Harris says that irked Emhoff. </p>   <p>In another instance, two months into Harris' bid, right as she was about to get on the debate stage, Harris writes that Biden called her. He wished her luck — but then spent time on the call asking if she was bashing him to \"powerbrokers.\"</p>   <p>\"I just couldn't understand why he would call me, right now, and make it all about himself,\" she writes.</p>   <p>A spokesperson for Biden declined to comment.</p>   <h3><strong>2. She doesn't directly say that Biden shouldn't have run for a second term</strong></h3>   <p>Harris doesn't make any comment in the book on whether Biden should have run for a second term at all. She defends his mental capacity to serve as president but writes that Biden's staff mismanaged his fatigue and worsened the issue.</p>   \n   <p>By the time last summer's debate debacle came around, and questions mounted on whether Biden should stay in the race, she says, she was in the \"worst position\" to tell Biden to drop out.</p>   <p>\"He would see it as naked ambition, perhaps as poisonous disloyalty, even if my only message was: Don't let the other guy win,\" Harris writes.</p>   \n   <p>She writes that she perhaps should have told Biden in the aftermath of the debate to drop out, but that \"maybe he was right\" to think voters would support him in a second match-up against Trump. In the end, Harris says, it was \"Joe and Jill's decision.\"</p>   <p>But Harris acknowledges in the book that it was \"recklessness\" to leave the decision of whether Biden should drop out to the Bidens themselves. \"It should have been more than a personal decision.\"</p>   <p>In an interview on MSNBC Monday night, Harris admitted, \"I have and had a certain responsibility that I should have followed through on. … When I talk about the recklessness, as much as anything, I'm talking about myself.\"</p>   \n   <p>Harris notes that throughout her run, she struggled to distance herself from Biden and his legacy — like when she told ABC's <em>The View</em> that she wouldn't have done anything different than Biden in their years in office.</p>   <p>She says at one point, her adviser David Plouffe didn't mince words: \"People hate Joe Biden,\" he said.</p>   <h3><strong>3. Her first choice as running mate was Pete Buttigieg</strong></h3>   <p>Harris reveals that Pete Buttigieg, her former 2020 political rival who served as transportation secretary in the Biden administration, is a close friend and was her first choice for running mate. She compliments Buttigieg as a savvy communicator and says he would have been an \"ideal partner,\" but she had reservations about whether Americans would accept a ticket with a Black woman married to a Jewish man alongside a gay man.</p>   \n   <p>Buttigieg responded in a statement to <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/news/2025/09/18/buttigieg-harris-runing-mate-107-days-00571954\" target=\"_blank\"><u>Politico</u></a>, \"My experience in politics has been that the way that you earn trust with voters is based mostly on what they think you're going to do for their lives, not on categories.\"</p>   <div>\n            <div>\n        <picture>\n            <source srcset=\"https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/1024x683+0+0/resize/400/quality/85/format/webp/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F1c%2Fdc%2F65c79de64ccba2ec471c7c2949f0%2Fgettyimages-2181638838.jpg 400w, https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/1024x683+0+0/resize/600/quality/85/format/webp/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F1c%2Fdc%2F65c79de64ccba2ec471c7c2949f0%2Fgettyimages-2181638838.jpg 600w, https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/1024x683+0+0/resize/800/quality/85/format/webp/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F1c%2Fdc%2F65c79de64ccba2ec471c7c2949f0%2Fgettyimages-2181638838.jpg 800w, https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/1024x683+0+0/resize/900/quality/85/format/webp/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F1c%2Fdc%2F65c79de64ccba2ec471c7c2949f0%2Fgettyimages-2181638838.jpg 900w, https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/1024x683+0+0/resize/1200/quality/85/format/webp/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F1c%2Fdc%2F65c79de64ccba2ec471c7c2949f0%2Fgettyimages-2181638838.jpg 1200w, https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/1024x683+0+0/resize/1600/quality/85/format/webp/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F1c%2Fdc%2F65c79de64ccba2ec471c7c2949f0%2Fgettyimages-2181638838.jpg 1600w, https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/1024x683+0+0/resize/1800/quality/85/format/webp/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F1c%2Fdc%2F65c79de64ccba2ec471c7c2949f0%2Fgettyimages-2181638838.jpg 1800w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1025px) 650px, calc(100vw - 30px)\" type=\"image/webp\"></source>\n            <source srcset=\"https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/1024x683+0+0/resize/400/quality/85/format/jpeg/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F1c%2Fdc%2F65c79de64ccba2ec471c7c2949f0%2Fgettyimages-2181638838.jpg 400w, https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/1024x683+0+0/resize/600/quality/85/format/jpeg/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F1c%2Fdc%2F65c79de64ccba2ec471c7c2949f0%2Fgettyimages-2181638838.jpg 600w, https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/1024x683+0+0/resize/800/quality/85/format/jpeg/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F1c%2Fdc%2F65c79de64ccba2ec471c7c2949f0%2Fgettyimages-2181638838.jpg 800w, https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/1024x683+0+0/resize/900/quality/85/format/jpeg/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F1c%2Fdc%2F65c79de64ccba2ec471c7c2949f0%2Fgettyimages-2181638838.jpg 900w, https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/1024x683+0+0/resize/1200/quality/85/format/jpeg/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F1c%2Fdc%2F65c79de64ccba2ec471c7c2949f0%2Fgettyimages-2181638838.jpg 1200w, https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/1024x683+0+0/resize/1600/quality/85/format/jpeg/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F1c%2Fdc%2F65c79de64ccba2ec471c7c2949f0%2Fgettyimages-2181638838.jpg 1600w, https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/1024x683+0+0/resize/1800/quality/85/format/jpeg/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F1c%2Fdc%2F65c79de64ccba2ec471c7c2949f0%2Fgettyimages-2181638838.jpg 1800w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1025px) 650px, calc(100vw - 30px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\"></source>\n            <img src=\"https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/1024x683+0+0/resize/1100/quality/50/format/jpeg/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F1c%2Fdc%2F65c79de64ccba2ec471c7c2949f0%2Fgettyimages-2181638838.jpg\" alt=\"Former Vice President Kamala Harris takes the stage after being introduced by then-Democratic vice presidential nominee, Minnesota Gov.

It was a contrast to Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro, whom Harris is critical of in her book and paints as too ambitious for being a No. 2. She says Shapiro asked one of her staffers about how many rooms the VP's residence had, and on the way in for his final interview, wondered how he could get work from Pennsylvania artists sent to the house.</p>   <p>She muses that Shapiro tried to call her to withdraw himself as a contender right before she named Walz because he knew he wouldn't be her choice.</p>   <p>Shapiro's spokesperson Manuel Bonder said in a statement, \"it's simply ridiculous to suggest that Governor Shapiro was focused on anything other than defeating Donald Trump. … The conclusion of this process was a deeply personal decision for both him and the Vice President.\"</p>   \n   <h3><strong>4. She is still trying to tell her own backstory</strong></h3>   <p>Harris has typically been a buttoned-up politician, especially when it comes to sharing personal anecdotes. In the memoir, though, she's more candid and reveals some of the personal struggles and stresses of her run for president — like the toll it took on her relationship with Emhoff.</p>   <p>But in most other parts of the book, it seems Harris is still trying to tell her own story to the public — something the campaign was pressed to do in a short window of time last year after Biden dropped out. After three and a half years of being a vice president that largely left her in the shadows, Harris spent several weeks on the campaign trail trying to reintroduce herself to the country in her own words.</p>   \n   <p>The book is peppered with familiar stump speech lines from Harris, along with explanations about her decision to become a prosecutor and lessons from her mother.</p>   <p>She also recounts her time as vice president meeting with foreign leaders like Ukraine's Volodymyr Zelenskyy and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, as well as leading on issues like gun violence prevention from the White House.</p>   <h3><strong>5. What's next for Harris is still unanswered</strong></h3>   <p>In the last few pages of her book, Harris gives some vague ideas for what she sees as the path forward for Democrats, and for the country.</p>   \n   <p>\"We need to come up with our own blueprint that sets out our alternative vision for our country,\" Harris writes, adding that \"the heart\" of her vision is investing in educating Gen Z.</p>   \n   <p>While she touches on the topics of transgender athletes and Israel's war in Gaza in the book, Harris doesn't offer any suggestions for how the party should handle specific issues going forward. Besides noting that she wants to \"be with the people\" and hear their ideas, Harris also doesn't indicate what her own future in politics will look like. She does say that the answer for what's next, though, won't come from Washington.</p>   <p>Her book tour, which kicks off Wednesday in New York, will include nearly 20 stops around the country, as well as London and Toronto.</p>\n</div>"
