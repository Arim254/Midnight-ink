    "description": "On hot button issues, a majority say children should be vaccinated; controlling gun violence is more important than gun rights; and Epstein files should be released, in a new NPR/PBS News/Marist poll.",
    "body": "<div>\n   <p>Three in 10 people now say that Americans may have to resort to violence to get the country back on track, according to a <a href=\"https://www.maristpoll.marist.edu/polls/the-1st-amendment-in-the-u-s-october-2025/\" target=\"_blank\">new NPR/PBS News/Marist poll</a>.</p>   <p>To be sure, a strong majority disagree with that (70%), but the 30% who now say violence may be necessary is up 11 points since April 2024, an increase driven by Democrats. Eighteen months ago, just 12% of Democrats agreed; now, 28% do.</p>   <p>But, still, a slightly higher percentage of Republicans — 31% — also say Americans may have to resort to violence. That's also up 3 points since last year. (Independents have also increased from 18% to 25%.)</p>   <p>The findings come after a string of high-profile acts of political violence, including the assassination of conservative activist Charlie Kirk last month.</p>   \n   <p>Three-quarters of people — 77% — described political violence as a major concern. Respondents are split, however, on whether they're more concerned with violence toward public officials (49%) or protesters (50%).</p>   <p>Here, there's a very sharp political divide — 70% of Democrats said protesters, 74% of Republicans said public officials.</p>   <p>The survey of more than 1,400 people nationwide was conducted over five days last week. Respondents were reached in various ways, by phone, cell and landline, online and via text in both English and Spanish. It has a +/- 3.1 percentage point margin of error, meaning results could be roughly 3 points higher or lower.</p>   <p>The survey was wide-ranging, showing that:<br /></p>   <ul><li>Most think the country is going in the wrong direction.</li><li>A majority of respondents believe the country has gone too far in restricting free speech.</li><li>There's a sharp partisan divide on whether the National Guard should be deployed to cities to curb crime.</li><li>The overwhelming majority believe children should be vaccinated before being allowed to go to school.</li><li>Controlling gun violence is more important than protecting gun rights.</li><li>And the files on the late financier/convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein should be released.</li></ul><h3><strong>Americans still sour on direction of the country, but partisanship is notable</strong></h3>   <p>By a 62%-to-38% margin, respondents said they believe the country is headed in the wrong direction.</p>   \n   <p>But, with Donald Trump as president, Republicans are far more positive about the direction of the country compared to last year when Joe Biden was president.</p>   <p>Consider that in an <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2024/10/27/us/elections/times-siena-poll-crosstabs.html\" target=\"_blank\">October 2024 New York Times/Siena poll</a> that asked a similar question, 9 in 10 Republicans said the country was headed in the wrong direction. Now, almost 8 in 10 said it's going in the right direction.</p>   <p>The reversal was evident with Democrats, too, but not quite as sharply. In October, 54% of Democrats thought the country was headed in the right direction. Now, 90% say it's going the wrong way.</p>   <p>Independents feel similarly to the way they did last year, but are 6 points higher in saying the country is headed in the wrong direction now (68%).</p>   \n   <p>A whopping 79% think the country has gone too far in restricting speech.</p>   <p>That crosses political lines, with 88% of Democrats, 86% of independents and 64% of Republicans saying so.</p>   <p>People also believe the federal government should play a minimal role in regulating speech. Just 15% said they think the government should play a major role in doing so. Another 44% said it should only play a minor role, and 41% said it should play no role at all.</p>   <p>The numbers were similar across political parties, but with Trump as president Republicans were more likely than Democrats or independents to say the government should play a major role — 22% of Republicans said that, while just 13% of Democrats and 11% of independents agreed.</p>   <p>Respondents also said by a wide margin that the Supreme Court should be responsible for defining what speech is considered unacceptable or too extreme — 62% said that compared to 26% for Congress and 11% for the president.</p>   \n   <p>There was a sharp partisan split on support for the deployment of the National Guard in local communities to reduce crime or assist local law enforcement.</p>   <p>Overall, by a 52%-47% margin, respondents said they support it in trying to reduce crime, but three-quarters of Democrats oppose the effort (60% strongly). A majority of independents (56%) also oppose, but 89% of Republicans are in favor.</p>   <p>The numbers were nearly identical on assisting law enforcement.</p>   <h3><strong>Wide support for requiring vaccines for children before entering school, but not as strongly among Republicans</strong></h3>   <p>The overwhelming majority — 82% — support requiring children to be vaccinated against certain diseases, such as measles, mumps and rubella, before attending public school.</p>   <p>That includes 71% of Republicans, but they believe so far less strongly than Democrats and independents. For example, 77% of those who voted for Democrat Kamala Harris in 2024 felt strongly that children should be vaccinated, while only 30% of Trump voters did.</p>   <h3><strong>Most say controlling gun violence is more important than protecting gun rights</strong></h3>   \n   <p>Roughly 6 in 10 said they believe that controlling gun violence is more important than protecting gun rights. But, like on many issues, Democrats and independents feel one way — 90% and 63%, respectively, said controlling gun violence is more important — while Republicans overwhelmingly feel another way. Three-quarters of Republicans said protecting gun rights is more important.</p>   <p>There was a notable split, however, among a key Trump base group — white voters without college degrees. White men without degrees were 58% in favor of protecting gun rights, a majority white women without degrees (56%), on the other hand, said controlling gun violence was more important.</p>   \n   <h3><strong>High disapproval of Trump's handling of the Epstein files</strong></h3>   <p>By a 61%-20% margin, respondents said they disapprove of how the Trump administration is handling the files related to the death of Jeffrey Epstein, the late financier and convicted sex offender who died by suicide while in prison six years ago.</p>   <p>That included almost 9 in 10 Democrats and 7 in 10 independents. Republicans, though, were more split — 45% approved, 25% didn't and 30% said they don't know enough to say.</p>   <p>But two-thirds of Republicans (and 77% of respondents overall) said they support releasing all the files with the names of victims redacted. So they appear to be giving Trump the benefit of the doubt to do what they think should happen — eventually.<br /></p>\n</div>"

    "body": "<div>\n      <p>A government shutdown is looming as Republicans and Democrats continue to search for middle ground on a variety of issues. Newt Gingrich shares his perspective on this most recent shutdown fight.</p>   \n</div><div>\n    <p>SCOTT DETROW, HOST: </p><p> The federal government is likely headed toward a shutdown. Democrats in Congress are withholding support for a short-term spending bill over demands to protect federal health care coverage. They want to extend health care subsidies that are set to expire at the end of the year and reverse GOP-led cuts to programs like Medicaid. President Trump and Republican lawmakers are not budging, and the White House is threatening to fire government employees if a shutdown takes place.</p><p>Our next guest is no stranger to a shutdown fight. Newt Gingrich was speaker of the House when Republicans shut down the government twice during the Clinton administration in the mid-'90s. And he recently wrote an op-ed in The New York Times titled \"There's Only One Way To Win A Shutdown. Democrats Don't Have What It Takes.\" Speaker Gingrich, welcome back to ALL THINGS CONSIDERED.</p><p>NEWT GINGRICH: I'm glad to be with you.</p><p>DETROW: So in your op-ed, you argue Democrats would regret this shutdown. Why is that?</p><p>GINGRICH: Well, at America's (ph) Renewal Project, which we run, which has been - does polling, it's very clear that there are two things that seemingly are in contradiction. The one is that the American people do not want an increase in spending by an overwhelming majority. The other is that they don't want their government to shut. Now, what's amazing to me about the position that we're now in, which is really different, Schumer has basically taken the position that he is willing to shut the government, which is unpopular, in order to increase spending, which is unpopular. And that's sort of a double negative you don't get very often.</p><p>DETROW: Well, isn't the flip side of that, though, subsidies for health care? Like, making health care more affordable is, by and large, bipartisan...</p><p>GINGRICH: Well, sure. They...</p><p>DETROW: ...Popular, right?</p><p>GINGRICH: Yeah. That would be, except you have John Thune saying oh, we agree, and there are plenty of time between now and December to do it. We're just not going to do it while you hold the government hostage. So I think the Republicans have pretty successfully cluttered the argument. I mean, there's a new survey that just came out that shows that the Republicans now have a six-point advantage, 47-41 on the generic ballot. And Gallup came out the other day and said that the Democrats favorability is now the lowest it has been since they've been taking that poll, which is 34%. So...</p><p>DETROW: Well, can I ask about that?</p><p>GINGRICH: Yeah. Yeah.</p><p>DETROW: Because when you look into those polls, a lot of the reasons that Democrats are sagging in popularity is because their base is frustrated to them. You know what happens when your base gets mad at you, right? That's a constant problem...</p><p>GINGRICH: Yeah.</p><p>DETROW: ...For Republicans in Congress over the years. What would you do if you were a Democratic leader and you're being pressured to pressure the Trump administration with truly the only point of leverage that you have right now?</p><p>GINGRICH: Well, look, I managed to help lead, when I was the speaker, two shutdowns, and they were successful. I mean, the news media said we'd suffered terrible losses, but in fact, we became the first reelected majority of Republicans since 1928 because people thought we were doing the right thing. But here's the difference. If you shut the government down for something people really want, then they'll say, yes, I'm glad you have the guts to do it. The Democrat problem is they're going to yell, health care. And the Republicans are going to say, terrific. We're for doing it in November, but not in this bill.</p><p>DETROW: But...</p><p>GINGRICH: So it's not like the Republicans are going to jump up and down and say, no, we want to make sure people don't get any - don't get their - and basically this is a fight over...</p><p>DETROW: Sure.</p><p>GINGRICH: ...The Obamacare subsidy.</p><p>DETROW: As partisan, though, as the things were in the first Trump administration, by and large, the Trump White House did negotiate with Senate Democrats on spending bills. It seems like that has been a nonstarter this time around. Democrats are arguing, we are not welcome at the table at any other point except this moment. Is that a point that they have?</p><p>GINGRICH: Yeah, look, historically, sure. Does it work politically? No.</p><p>DETROW: Yeah.</p><p>GINGRICH: I mean, nobody in most of America sits around and worries about the maneuvers of politicians. And it's just, you know, life's too short, and there are too many things to worry about.</p><p>DETROW: (Laughter).</p><p>GINGRICH: So you've got to find a thematic. This is the great lesson from Reagan and from Lincoln and, frankly, from Trump. You have to find a thematic that resonates where people look up and say, yeah, that really matters.</p><p>DETROW: Well...</p><p>GINGRICH: And frankly, if the Republicans, who have become significantly less dumb than they were for a while - if the Republicans stick to, yes, we're willing to try to solve that but not in this bill and this is a clean bill, and you are closing the government, I think they have probably a pretty powerful winning position.</p><p>DETROW: When it comes to things that cut through and don't cut through, you know, the same pattern often plays itself out where the White House is not blamed, and it's the minority party in Congress that is blamed. At the same time, though, you have President Trump threatening mass firings - not furloughs, firings - of possibly thousands of federal employees. Do you see any political risk to that?</p><p>GINGRICH: Well, I think they picked up on the Rahm Emanuel theory that you should never let a crisis go to waste.</p><p>DETROW: And that these are...</p><p>GINGRICH: And I think...</p><p>DETROW: ...Furloughs they would want...</p><p>GINGRICH: ...This...</p><p>DETROW: ...To make anyway, firings they would want to make anyway.</p><p>GINGRICH: Sure. Look, I think what you have here, that people have not really dug into enough, is that when Trump was forced into the wilderness for four years, the entire team at America First Policy Institute was about 400 experienced people from the Trump administration. And they had four years to sit down and think through, what is it we have to do to really dramatically change the system? And I think that - and Russ Vought, who's now the head of OMB, Office of Management and Budget, I think thought this through. They all knew a government shutdown was possible. They had been talking about it for four years. This is not a surprise to them. And I think they had decided early on that you're only going to get the scale of change they want if you're very tough and very determined and every chance you get, you take the opportunity.</p><p>DETROW: Taking a step back, you have direct experience with this, but you've also written and studied history. This has now become the norm since the mid-1990s. Every few years, there's a possible or a government shutdown. The government lists are long on short-term funding.</p><p>GINGRICH: Yep.</p><p>DETROW: Do you see long-term damage to that?</p><p>GINGRICH: Yeah. Look, I don't think it's a good idea. I think it's particularly destructive in the Defense Department, where you just stretch out things that make them dramatically harder to get done. But it's really a symptom of a deeper problem, which is that - and this is why we founded America's New Majority Project. We are currently or have been - I think it's breaking loose now. We have been, for a very long time, in a deeply divided nation in which the balance of power is so narrow that each side thinks that it has to screw up the other side. And if you think historically, that's not abnormal. It happens, you know, when you're going through this scale of change.</p><p>One side or the other, has to win by a big enough margin to have real control. And, of course, the Senate is the real crux of that because the Senate requires 60 votes, not 51. And so you either have to have a huge majority or you have to pick issues so popular that the other side can't vote against you. When we did, for example, welfare reform, we literally split the Democrats 93 to 93, because half of them couldn't go home and explain why they were going to vote no.</p><p>DETROW: Yeah. That is former house speaker Newt Gingrich, giving us his insights on this possible government shutdown. Thank you so much for talking to us.</p><p>(SOUNDBITE OF BADBADNOTGOOD SONG, \"MARKING MY TIME\")</p>\n    <p>Copyright © 2025 NPR.  All rights reserved.

It was updated early Wednesday morning and warns: \"The Radical Left in Congress shut down the government. HUD will use available resources to help Americans in need.\"</p>   <p>Wednesday morning, a banner added to the top of Department of Justice websites reads \"Democrats have shut down the government\" with a link to its shutdown plans.</p>   \n   <p>Staffers at multiple agencies and Cabinet departments received emails on Tuesday from the White House Office of Management and Budget. Many shared screenshots of those emails with NPR, or confirmed the text of the message they received. The messages said any lapse in government funding would be \"forced by Congressional Democrats.\"</p>   \n   <p>\"President Trump opposes a government shutdown, and strongly supports the enactment of H.R. 5371, which is a clean Continuing Resolution to fund the government through November 21, and already passed the U.S. House of Representatives,\" the message says. \"Unfortunately, Democrats are blocking this Continuing Resolution in the U.S. Senate due to unrelated policy demands. If Congressional Democrats maintain their current posture and refuse to pass a clean Continuing Resolution to keep the government funded before midnight on September 30, 2025, federal appropriated funding will lapse.\"</p>   <p>The message continues: \"The agency has contingency plans in place for executing an orderly shutdown of activities that would be affected by any lapse in appropriations forced by Congressional Democrats.\"</p>   <p>Similar messages were received by staff at the Departments of the Interior, Commerce, Labor, State, Treasury, Justice, Agriculture and Health and Human Services, the Social Security Administration, the General Services Administration, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, the Securities and Exchange Commission, the Office of Personnel Management and the National Labor Relations Board, according to screenshots shared with NPR.</p>   \n   <p>Republicans control both chambers of Congress but <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2025/09/30/g-s1-91217/government-shutdown-midnight\" target=\"_blank\">need Democratic support</a> in the Senate to approve any government funding deal.</p>   <p>A statement from the Department of Veterans Affairs also used sharply partisan language, saying \"radical liberals in Congress\" would be to blame for services not being available during a shutdown, such as career counseling activities and the closure of regional benefits offices. </p>   <p>\"Radical liberals in Congress are trying to shut down the government to achieve their crazy fantasy of open borders, 'transgender' for everybody and men competing in women's sports,\" VA press secretary Pete Kasperowicz said in a statement sent to the media. \"If they succeed, they will stop critical Veterans care and assistance programs.\"</p>   <p>Health care for veterans will not be affected and the <a href=\"https://department.va.gov/contingency-planning/human-capital-contingency-plan/\" target=\"_blank\">VA's contingency plan</a> notes that about 97% of its employees will not be furloughed.</p>   \n   <h3>Alarm bells for ethics experts</h3>   <p>The inclusion of overtly political messages in federal agency communications raised immediate alarm bells for some federal workers and ethics experts. They said it could violate the <a href=\"https://osc.gov/Services/pages/hatchact.aspx\" target=\"_blank\">Hatch Act</a>, which prohibits civil servants in the executive branch from engaging in most political activity inside federal buildings or while on duty.</p>   <p>\"This correspondence from Federal Government Officials could be considered a violation of the Hatch Act,\" Michael Fallings, a partner at Tully Rinckey, an employment law firm, said in a statement. \"The Hatch Act prohibits engaging in political activity while in an official capacity, including communication that contains advocacy in opposition to a political party. Here, while the reference to Democrats alone likely does not constitute a violation, the explicit blaming of the Democratic Party for the shutdown and 'reference to radical left' may constitute a violation.\"</p>   <p>\"The code of ethics requires that federal employees serve the American public impartially, without regard to their political views. This message may not technically violate the Hatch Act--since it does not advocate for particular candidates or weigh in on elections, but it certainly violates the spirit of that law,\" said Donald Sherman, executive director and chief counsel at Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington, a liberal nonprofit ethics watchdog group.</p>   \n   <p>\"A shutdown will cause stress for the public regardless of political affiliation. Agency leadership's job in this moment is to provide nonpartisan service to their constituents, not politicize the situation and blame political enemies,\" Sherman said.</p>   <p>\"We just all accept that the Hatch Act is null and void,\" one federal worker, who requested anonymity because they fear retaliation from the Trump administration for speaking out, told NPR. \"Nothing matters.\"</p>   <h3>Sent at the behest of the White House</h3>   <p>The highly partisan language from the Trump administration also differs from that used by other administrations during previous shutdowns.</p>   <p>Ahead of a government shutdown that lasted more than two weeks in 2013, then-President Obama <a href=\"https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/blog/2013/10/01/president-obamas-letter-federal-employees-shutdown-government\" target=\"_blank\">penned a letter to federal employees</a> that thanked them for their service and chided a Congress that \"has failed to meet its responsibility\" to approve a spending plan, without mentioning Republicans.</p>   <p>\"This shutdown was completely preventable,\" he wrote. \"It should not have happened. And the House of Representatives can end it as soon as it follows the Senate's lead, and funds your work in the United States Government without trying to attach highly controversial and partisan measures in the process.\"</p>   <p>\"This type of email informing us of a potential shutdown is not new, but the tone and blaming one political party is definitely unusual,\" said a Office of Personnel Management staffer who requested anonymity due to fear of reprisal.</p>   <p>Tuesday's messages were sent by agency leadership, but in several cases made clear that they were sent at the behest of the White House.</p>   <p>\"The Office of Management and Budget has requested that we send the attached message to you regarding a potential lapse in funding,\" the email to NLRB staff read. The National Labor Relations Board declined to comment.</p>   <p>\"This message was issued under the guidance of the Office of Management and Budget and in alignment with their protocols,\" an Interior Department spokesperson said in a statement to NPR.</p>   \n   <p>\"The reality is that the Trump Administration wants to keep the government open so HHS, including the CDC, can fully safeguard the public's health and well-being. By contrast, Congressional Democrats are threatening a shutdown that would impact care to millions of Americans. We will refer you to OMB for additional comment,\" HHS communications director Andrew Nixon said in a statement.</p>   <p>The Office of Management and Budget didn't respond to a request for comment.</p>   \n   <p>The message to Labor Department employees was unsigned by leadership and was sent from a generic department email address that doesn't accept replies, said one department employee who requested anonymity due to fear of reprisal.</p>   <p>At the Social Security Administration, the email came from Commissioner Frank Bisignano, according to a staffer who requested anonymity for fear of retaliation.</p>   <p>\"It basically read like a campaign email,\" the staffer said.</p>   <p>The Departments of Labor, Housing and Urban Development, Commerce, Justice, Agriculture and Treasury, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the Social Security Administration, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, the General Services Administration and the Office of Personnel Management did not respond to requests for comment. The Securities and Exchange Commission declined to comment.</p>   <p>Federal employees are on edge amid this week's funding negotiation, as the White House has <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2025/09/24/nx-s1-5552789/trump-government-shutdown-plan-memo\" target=\"_blank\">threatened to fire some federal workers</a> during a shutdown rather than temporarily furloughing workers as is usually done.</p>      <p><em>NPR's Quil Lawrence and Tamara Keith contributed reporting.</em></p>   <p><em>Have information you want to share about the shutdown or other restructuring changes across the federal government?

During the last shutdown, parks remained open even though they went unstaffed.</li></ul><h3>Ahead of the funding deadline, Democrats and Republicans dug in</h3>   <p>As the funding deadline neared, lawmakers ratcheted up the finger-pointing over the impending shutdown.</p>   <p>Democrats continue to argue that they are fighting to protect Americans' health care, as they push to extend the insurance subsidies and also attempt to repeal cuts to health care programs that were enacted by the GOP's tax and spending bill passed earlier this summer.</p>   <p>\"We see now Republicans are plunging America into a shutdown, rejecting bipartisan talks, pushing a partisan bill and risking America's health care,\" Minority Leader Chuck Schumer said Tuesday night.</p>   \n   <p>But, Republicans have accused Democrats of taking the federal budget hostage to advance their policy goals.</p>   <p>\"Senate Democrats have sacrificed the American people to Democrats' partisan interests,\" Majority Leader John Thune said shortly before the government shut down.</p>   <h3>How long will the shutdown last?</h3>   <p>Republican leaders say they plan to continue holding votes on their stopgap funding measure, hoping they can peel off more Democrats to join them as a shutdown wears on.</p>   <p>\"When we had a vote on our proposal to keep the government open right before the recess, we had one Democrat vote,\" Republican Whip John Barrasso said Tuesday night. \"Tonight, we had three. So the cracks are beginning to show.\"</p>   \n   <p>Two Democrats, Sens. John Fetterman of Pennsylvania, and Catherine Cortez Masto of Nevada and one independent, Angus King of Maine — who caucuses with Democrats — voted for the Republican bill on Tuesday. </p>   \n   <p>\"We need a bipartisan solution to address this impending health care crisis, but we should not be swapping the pain of one group of Americans for another,\" Cortez Masto said.</p>   <p>But six Democrats who voted yes on the continuing resolution when it first came for a vote in March declined to support the measure this time around. And like Thune, Schumer also said he believes some members on the other side may eventually find their position untenable.</p>   <p>Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., was the lone Republican to oppose the measure Tuesday.</p>   <p>The last government shutdown, from December 2018 to January 2019, lasted 35 days and was the longest in U.S. history.</p>   <p>With Republicans and Democrats both signaling they are unwilling to budge, there is no clarity about the path out of the shutdown — or how long it will last.</p>\n</div>"

The <a href=\"https://fiscaldata.treasury.gov/americas-finance-guide/federal-spending/\" target=\"_blank\">bulk of that spending</a> goes to debt service, national defense and entitlement programs like Social Security and Medicare.</p>   \n   <p>Loading...</p>\n   <p>When it <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2025/02/19/nx-s1-5302705/doge-overstates-savings-federal-contracts\" target=\"_blank\">first launched this year</a>, NPR found <a href=\"https://doge.gov/savings\" target=\"_blank\">DOGE's savings and efficiency tracker</a> to be riddled with factual errors, overstatements and unverifiable claims. As a new fiscal year begins, that remains true today.</p>   <p>White House assistant press secretary Liz Huston said in a statement to NPR that Trump has been \"given a clear mandate to reduce waste, fraud, and abuse across the federal government, and he is delivering on that commitment.\" </p>   <p>\"President Trump's policies, moreover, have made the federal government more efficiently work for the American people again — deporting illegal alien criminals, predicting natural disasters, reducing health outbreaks, and restoring law and order in our cities,\" Huston added.</p>   \n   <p>The White House declined to answer NPR's questions about rehiring workers, increasing federal spending and DOGE data errors. </p>   <p>The ad-hoc DOGE initiative's controversial and often haphazard insertion into the federal government is now further complicated by a government shutdown that began Wednesday. </p>   <p>The White House has floated using the budget impasse as an <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2025/09/24/nx-s1-5552789/trump-government-shutdown-plan-memo\" target=\"_blank\">opportunity to enact more widespread job cuts</a> that would circumvent Congress' role in appropriations — and <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2025/09/30/nx-s1-5558393/government-shutdown-trump-ethics-hatch-act\" target=\"_blank\">used taxpayer funds to send partisan messages to federal workers</a> ahead of the shutdown.</p>   <h3>After deep cuts, some agencies are rehiring — sort of</h3>   <p>The Office of Personnel Management estimates the federal government could see about 1 in 8 civilian workers gone by the end of the year, or about 300,000 employees out of 2.4 million — most of them voluntary. More than 150,000 <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2025/09/30/nx-s1-5545715/federal-employees-fork-deferred-resignation-trump\" target=\"_blank\">took the Trump administration's \"Fork in the Road\" buyout</a> offer.</p>   \n   <p>By comparison, the federal government has typically shed 6% to 8% of its total workforce annually in recent years.</p>   <p>A more precise accounting of how many federal workers have already left through voluntary buyouts, retirements and job cuts is difficult because the government's own data is compiled and published on a several-month delay. </p>   <p>But amid those departures, some agencies have sought to bring people back — a pattern that has picked up in recent weeks ahead of the end of the fiscal year. </p>   \n   <p>Hundreds of employees whose jobs had been cut or who had taken the \"Fork\" deferred resignation deal, which sent them home from work but kept them on the federal payroll through the end of the fiscal year, are now being offered their jobs back, according to multiple federal workers who requested anonymity because they fear reprisal from the Trump administration for speaking publicly.</p>   <p>That includes around 285 employees at GSA's Public Building Service division, who manage the federal government's real estate portfolio — out of around 600 to 700 whose jobs were eliminated earlier this year, according to multiple GSA employees. In an initial email communication, staffers who had lost their jobs were told that their reinstatement did not guarantee future job security amid the agency's ongoing restructuring efforts. But in a follow-up message, they were told that if they turned the offer down, they would \"forfeit severance and other entitlements associated with an involuntary separation.\" </p>   <p>They were given a deadline of Oct. 1 to decide.</p>   <p>GSA employees are also <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2025/09/18/g-s1-89492/ice-immigration-raids-gsa-office-space\" target=\"_blank\">scrambling to find office space</a> to accommodate a surge of Immigration and Customs Enforcement activity in cities across the country after DOGE pushed for the firings and termination of a sizable chunk of federal leases.</p>   <p>Even as the administration is <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2025/08/01/g-s1-80636/trump-immigration-ice-federal-workers\" target=\"_blank\">recruiting</a> 10,000 new ICE officers, President Trump's push for increased immigration enforcement has been undercut by increased firing of immigration judges, with the Justice Department's Executive Office for Immigration Review <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2025/09/23/nx-s1-5550915/trump-immigration-judges\" target=\"_blank\">losing more than 125 judges </a>since the start of the year, down from about 700, due to firings and voluntary resignations.</p>   \n   <p>Other agencies are also juggling real estate needs in the wake of DOGE's cuts. The Labor Department's Mine Safety and Health Administration is seeking new lease agreements for space for mine inspectors after DOGE canceled some leases, according to a Labor Department employee.</p>   <p>The Labor Department is also bringing back some workers who took the government's deferred resignation offer, while other employees whose jobs were eliminated received notices that they would instead be assigned to new positions at the department. They were told they would \"remain on administrative leave\" until more details could be provided.</p>   \n   <p>As the government shutdown arrives, employees are still waiting for those further details. </p>   <p>The Labor Department's IT website briefly had a banner welcoming back employees who had taken the deferred resignation offer, but it was quickly taken down, the Labor Department employee said. \"They definitely want minimal noise about it,\" they said.</p>   <p>At some agencies, workers were never officially laid off, but haven't been working, either. Many Department of Agriculture employees, including high-ranking officials, have been on administrative leave, with pay, for months \"with no plan for them in sight,\" according to one USDA employee. They haven't received severance notices or further information about whether they'll be asked to return. </p>   <p>\"This was all a giant waste of money,\" the employee said.</p>   <p>Elsewhere, however, federal employees say they are scrambling to keep doing their work with fewer colleagues, and are being hampered by an executive order that says agencies can only hire one employee for every four who leave their jobs.</p>   <p>\"There is a serious worry of too many people leaving or retiring and us not being able to function,\" said a Bureau of Land Management employee in the Mountain West. \"It's so bad in some of our offices that leadership told local managers to do anything short of begging or breaking policy to keep people,\" this person said.</p>   <p>Heightening that uncertainty is the fallout of the government shutdown. In a memo last week, the White House Office of Management and Budget told agency heads to <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2025/09/24/nx-s1-5552789/trump-government-shutdown-plan-memo\" target=\"_blank\">prepare for a \"reduction in force\"</a> that would permanently eliminate some federal jobs during a shutdown, rather than temporarily furloughing workers as is usually done.</p>   <p>At an agency-wide town hall meeting on Sep. 25, an anonymous GSA worker asked, \"So are our jobs safe or are we getting RIF'ed anyway on Oct 1rst,\" according to a screenshot shared with NPR by another GSA employee.</p>   \n   <p>The GSA and Departments of Labor, Interior and Agriculture didn't respond to requests for comment.</p>   <h3>The federal government is spending more, even with DOGE</h3>   <p>Trump and other DOGE backers say the effort is needed to cut federal spending and decrease the deficit.</p>   <p>Treasury data shows the federal government collected <a href=\"https://fiscaldata.treasury.gov/\" target=\"_blank\">$4.69 trillion in revenue</a> from Oct. 1, 2024 through the end of August, a 7% increase over the same period the prior fiscal year. But during the same time, the government spent $6.66 trillion, an increase of <a href=\"https://fiscaldata.treasury.gov/americas-finance-guide/federal-spending/\" target=\"_blank\">$376 billion</a>, or about 6%. Looking at <a href=\"https://fiscaldata.treasury.gov/datasets/monthly-treasury-disbursements/\" target=\"_blank\">monthly expenditures published by the U.S. Treasury</a>, spending is down compared to last year at some agencies and programs that the Trump administration has sought to cut back or eliminate, like the <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2025/09/26/nx-s1-5544177/trump-school-funding-federal-budget\" target=\"_blank\">Department of Education</a>, the <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2025/03/18/g-s1-54569/us-institute-of-peace-trump-doge\" target=\"_blank\">U.S. Institute of Peace</a> and the <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2025/09/04/nx-s1-5528887/a-vaccine-skeptic-is-leading-public-health-in-the-us-today-rfk-jr-faced-questions\" target=\"_blank\">Centers for Disease Control and Prevention</a>.</p>   <p>Others have seen an increase, like the Office of the Secretary for the Department of Health and Human Services. Overall, however, HHS has undertaken <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/sections/shots-health-news/2025/05/13/nx-s1-5381022/rfk-hhs-layoffs-restructuring-trump-budget\" target=\"_blank\">massive layoffs</a>, claiming they are necessary to reorganize the department to align with Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s goal to \"Make America Healthy Again.\" </p>   <p>Fiscal year data covers the end of the Biden administration and the beginning of the Trump administration.</p>   \n   <p>The overwhelming majority of federal spending — about 64% — is on Social Security, Medicare, health programs, income security and veterans' benefits and services. Another 14% has been interest payments towards the country's $37.5 trillion in debt, plus 13% for national defense. </p>   <p>That leaves a tiny slice of the budgetary pie for discretionary spending and little room to cut without targeting overwhelmingly popular benefit programs.</p>   <p>Jessica Riedl of the center-right Manhattan Institute <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2025/03/06/nx-s1-5318072/how-much-money-has-doge-saved-budget-deficit-congress\" target=\"_blank\">previously told NPR</a> that any meaningful changes to how the federal government spends taxpayer money would have to come from Congressional action.</p>   <p>\"DOGE has created this false perception that the entire budget deficit can be eliminated by going after waste, fraud and abuse and without making the difficult decisions elsewhere in the budget,\" Riedl said. \"And this exaggeration is making it even harder to do the real hard things that are going to be needed to fix the deficit beyond waste.\"</p>   <p>Still, billionaire and on-and-off Trump ally Elon Musk, who <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2025/05/30/nx-s1-5415641/musk-leaves-doge-what-comes-next\" target=\"_blank\">oversaw DOGE until the end of May</a>, set an ever-shifting goal that eventually landed on <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2025/03/06/nx-s1-5318072/how-much-money-has-doge-saved-budget-deficit-congress\" target=\"_blank\">$1 trillion in cuts</a> to federal spending from Jan. 20 to the end of September.</p>   \n   <p>Even taking DOGE's savings claims at face value, <a href=\"https://fiscaldata.treasury.gov/americas-finance-guide/national-deficit/\" target=\"_blank\">U.S. Treasury Department data</a> shows the federal deficit has grown by nearly $2 trillion from Oct. 1, 2024 to the end of August 2025 — an increase of $76 billion from the same period the year before.</p>   \n   <h3>DOGE claims still can't be verified</h3>   <p>DOGE has never given an accurate or transparent accounting of how its work has saved the taxpayer dollars it claims, and its <a href=\"https://doge.gov/savings\" target=\"_blank\">\"wall of receipts\"</a> page only accounts for part of the unverifiable estimate of $206 billion saved.</p>   <p>As NPR has <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2025/02/19/nx-s1-5302705/doge-overstates-savings-federal-contracts\" target=\"_blank\">frequently</a> <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2025/03/01/nx-s1-5313853/doge-savings-receipts-musk-trump\" target=\"_blank\">reported</a>, DOGE's claims are overstated, full of errors and seem to reflect little understanding of the federal procurement process.</p>   <p>The most recent contract termination on DOGE's website purports to show $4.3 million in savings from canceling a $4.4 million consulting contract for the Federal Aviation Administration. The <a href=\"https://www.fpds.gov/common/jsp/LaunchWebPage.jsp?command=execute&requestid=326858981&version=1.5\" target=\"_blank\">linked contract</a> is not terminated, is <a href=\"https://www.usaspending.gov/award/CONT_AWD_693KA922F00215_6920_693KA922D00015_6920\" target=\"_blank\">worth about $150,000</a> and almost all of the money has been spent already.</p>   <p>The largest claim is $4 billion in savings from a <a href=\"https://govtribe.com/award/federal-vehicle/base-infrastructure-modernization-1?clickedFeature=true&r1=e2&omrie417nwb=1\" target=\"_blank\">decade-long multiple-vendor contract </a>worth up to $12.5 billion for the Air Force's Base Infrastructure Modernization (BIM) project. There's no public evidence to support that claim. A review of federal contracting data shows the nearly two dozen companies involved have been awarded about $12,000 so far to kick off the project.</p>   <p>It's not just contracts: some of the leases touted on the DOGE tracker as terminated still appear as active on the GSA's Inventory of Owned and Leased Properties.</p>   <p>The White House has declined to answer specific questions from NPR over the last eight months about how DOGE operates, how its savings claims are calculated and about specific errors and exaggerations.</p>   <p><em>Have information you want to share about DOGE, spending, hiring, the government shutdown or other restructuring changes across the federal government?

And with turnout for overseas voters long trailing that of domestic voters (3.4% compared to 62.5% <a href=\"https://www.fvap.gov/info/reports-surveys/overseas-citizen-population-analysis\" target=\"_blank\">in 2022</a>), voting rights advocates fear GOP-led lawsuits and proposals could drive down participation even further.</p>   \n   <p>\"It really stands out,\" says Susan Dzieduszycka-Suinat, president and CEO of the U.S. Vote Foundation, a nonpartisan organization that advocates for U.S. citizens casting ballots from outside the country. \"I have to admit that 20 years ago when I got involved with overseas voting, I did not fast forward to this time where I thought we would be fighting for our basic rights. But it seems like that's what's on the chopping block here.\"</p>   <h3>GOP officials are pushing to block voting by citizens who've never lived in the U.S.</h3>   <p>Much of the current fight is centered on overseas citizens who were born abroad and have never lived in the United States, including those with U.S. citizen parents or legal guardians serving abroad in the U.S. military.</p>   <p>Thirty-seven <a href=\"https://www.fvap.gov/citizen-voter/reside\" target=\"_blank\">states</a>, plus Washington, D.C., allow these citizens to vote if a relative last lived in the state or territory before leaving the country. Some places allow these voters to only cast ballots in federal elections, while others also allow voting in state and local races.</p>   <p><strong>North Carolina</strong></p>   <p>Last year, in the final weeks of voting for the 2024 general election, the Republican National Committee challenged the legitimacy of these voters' ballots in the swing states of Michigan and North Carolina, claiming rules allowing these voters to cast ballots violated state constitutions. No ballots ended up getting tossed, as the lawsuits were dismissed.

The group <a href=\"https://www.superiorcourt.maricopa.gov/docket/CivilCourtCases/caseInfo.asp?caseNumber=CV2025-022859\" target=\"_blank\">filed a state court challenge</a> in June claiming that a <a href=\"https://www.azleg.gov/legtext/47leg/1R/laws/0271.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">20-year-old state law</a> allowing overseas non-resident voters to cast ballots in federal and state elections violates the Arizona Constitution.</p>   <p>The RNC declined NPR's interview request but confirmed in a statement that more legal challenges may be coming in other states that allow these U.S. citizens to vote.</p>   \n   <p>\"RNC lawsuits are absolutely part of our strategy heading into the midterms,\" Kiersten Pels, a spokesperson for the RNC, said. \"Allowing individuals who have never lived in the United States to register to vote dilutes the voting power of lawful Arizona voters.\"</p>   \n   <p>Advocates for these U.S. citizens say efforts to block voting by what GOP officials often refer to as \"never residents\" discount the connections that many of those born abroad have with communities in the United States.</p>   <p>\"We should never as Americans, I would hope, want to penalize children of those who serve for their parents' service and their service. We should never want to take away a right for them because their parents chose to serve the country,\" says Brandi Jones, a spouse of an active-duty Marine, who helps lead Secure Families Initiative, an advocacy group for military families.</p>   <p><strong>Nationwide</strong></p>   <p>The voting system for U.S. citizens living abroad could be further upended by a House bill introduced in August by Republican Rep. Abe Hamadeh of Arizona, who previously served abroad for the U.S. Army.</p>   <p>The <a href=\"https://www.congress.gov/bill/119th-congress/house-bill/4851/text\" target=\"_blank\">Proving Residency for Overseas Voter Eligibility, or PROVE, Act</a> would require overseas voters to have a \"current residence\" in the state they're registered, or a spouse, parent or guardian with such a residence. Overseas voters who do not would be able to register in Washington, D.C., and vote in federal elections in the district, which is represented in Congress by a non-voting delegate.</p>   <p>Hamadeh did not agree to an interview or respond to written questions from NPR. The bill's four other Republican sponsors also did not respond to NPR's requests for comment.</p>   <p>But in a <a href=\"https://hamadeh.house.gov/media/press-releases/congressman-abe-hamadeh-introduces-prove-act-ensure-election-integrity\" target=\"_blank\">press release</a>, Hamadeh said allowing overseas voters without a \"current residence\" in a state to cast ballots there \"threatens electoral integrity and is an affront to everyone who believes in fair and free elections.\"</p>   \n   <p>For Dzieduszycka-Suinat of the U.S. Vote Foundation, the bill is the latest sign that the threats to overseas voting that began during the 2024 election have not gone away.</p>   <p>\"Actually, it's transformed into an even worse monster because now we have the PROVE Act hanging out there,\" Dzieduszycka-Suinat says.</p>   <h3>Overseas voters are now mostly civilians, not military</h3>   <p>Dzieduszycka-Suinat sees these GOP-led moves as a reaction to the Democratic National Committee's<a href=\"https://democrats.org/news/dnc-announces-innovative-six-figure-investment-in-democrats-abroad-to-ensure-engagement-of-key-voters-living-outside-u-s/\" target=\"_blank\"> voter-registration push</a> last year among U.S. citizens living abroad.</p>   <p>A September 2024 social media post by President Trump appeared to refer to that effort by claiming — without evidence — that Democrats \"want to dilute the TRUE vote of our beautiful military and their families\" with ballots sent overseas \"without any citizenship check or verification of identity.\"</p>   <div>\n            <div>\n        <picture>\n            <source srcset=\"https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/5256x3504+0+0/resize/400/quality/85/format/webp/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fe0%2F90%2F76c78d8e471eac90b14ba7cedb9a%2Fgettyimages-2183250933.jpg 400w, https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/5256x3504+0+0/resize/600/quality/85/format/webp/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fe0%2F90%2F76c78d8e471eac90b14ba7cedb9a%2Fgettyimages-2183250933.jpg 600w, https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/5256x3504+0+0/resize/800/quality/85/format/webp/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fe0%2F90%2F76c78d8e471eac90b14ba7cedb9a%2Fgettyimages-2183250933.jpg 800w, https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/5256x3504+0+0/resize/900/quality/85/format/webp/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fe0%2F90%2F76c78d8e471eac90b14ba7cedb9a%2Fgettyimages-2183250933.jpg 900w, https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/5256x3504+0+0/resize/1200/quality/85/format/webp/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fe0%2F90%2F76c78d8e471eac90b14ba7cedb9a%2Fgettyimages-2183250933.jpg 1200w, https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/5256x3504+0+0/resize/1600/quality/85/format/webp/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fe0%2F90%2F76c78d8e471eac90b14ba7cedb9a%2Fgettyimages-2183250933.jpg 1600w, https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/5256x3504+0+0/resize/1800/quality/85/format/webp/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fe0%2F90%2F76c78d8e471eac90b14ba7cedb9a%2Fgettyimages-2183250933.jpg 1800w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1025px) 650px, calc(100vw -

Beginning with the 2016 election, civilians have been outnumbering military members and any eligible family members stationed with them abroad. In 2024, civilians made up 59.3% of registered voters covered by the <a href=\"https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/COMPS-694/pdf/COMPS-694.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">Uniformed and Overseas Citizens Absentee Voting Act</a>, while 39.8% were military service members and their relatives, according to estimates released <a href=\"https://www.eac.gov/sites/default/files/2025-06/2024_EAVS_Report_508c.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">by the U.S. Election Assistance Commission</a>.</p>   <p>\"There's nothing that went wrong here. It's just that some people got their knickers in a twist that maybe overseas voters — their votes can't be controlled to vote for any one single party,\" Dzieduszycka-Suinat says. \"Certain groups are going after splinters of the UOCAVA vote to get particular wins that don't amount to much, but really have a terrible negative impact on the overall sense of principle regarding our voting rights.\"</p>   <p>Indeed, the GOP admits a partisan motive.</p>   <p>In its <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/26171557-republican-party-of-arizona-complaint-cv2025-022859/\" target=\"_blank\">Arizona lawsuit</a>, the RNC claims that allowing overseas non-resident voters to cast ballots \"inflicts a competitive injury\" on both the state and national GOP by adding to the state's voter rolls \"individuals who are disproportionately non-Republican in their partisan affiliations.\"</p>   \n   <h3>Proof-of-citizenship requirements could also complicate overseas voting</h3>   <p>Other Republican efforts related to overseas voting raise the specter of voter fraud.</p>   <p>Despite no evidence of widespread fraud among overseas voters, some Republican officials are calling for additional requirements in order for voters to register or cast their ballots.</p>   <p>When processing new voter registrations, <a href=\"https://bipartisanpolicy.org/blog/four-things-to-know-about-noncitizen-voting/\" target=\"_blank\">most states</a> use an applicant's personal information, such as their Social Security number, to confirm their eligibility with government databases.</p>   <p>Still, <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2025/03/12/nx-s1-5301676/save-act-explainer-voter-registration\" target=\"_blank\">a GOP-backed bill</a> in Congress would require eligible overseas voters registering by mail using a state's voter registration form to show their passport or another document proving their U.S. citizenship \"in person to the office of the appropriate election official.\" The <a href=\"https://www.congress.gov/bill/119th-congress/house-bill/22/text\" target=\"_blank\">Safeguard American Voter Eligibility Act</a>, also known as the SAVE Act, passed the Republican-controlled U.S. House of Representatives in April.</p>   <p>Similarly, in March, Trump <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2025/03/26/g-s1-55927/trump-voting-citizenship-executive-order\" target=\"_blank\">put out an executive order</a> that <a href=\"https://www.federalregister.gov/d/2025-05523/p-34\" target=\"_blank\">calls for</a> a change to the <a href=\"https://www.fvap.gov/uploads/FVAP/Forms/fpca.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">federal post card application</a> that many military and overseas voters use. His plan would require a passport or another document proving their U.S. citizenship, as well as \"proof of eligibility to vote in elections in the State in which the voter is attempting to vote.\"</p>   <p>Trump's order also tries to put pressure on states that count absentee ballots that are postmarked by Election Day but received afterwards — a move that advocates of overseas voters say raises the risk that votes of citizens living abroad could get thrown out because of mail delays.</p>   <p>After Secure Families Initiative and other organizations, plus a group of states, filed lawsuits, federal judges have put parts of the order on hold for now. In <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/26173379-state-of-california-v-trump-2025-06-13-memorandum-and-order-125-cv-10810-djc/\" target=\"_blank\">her decision from June</a>, which the Trump administration is <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/26173743-state-of-california-v-trump-2025-07-31-notice-of-appeal-125-cv-10810-djc/\" target=\"_blank\">appealing</a>, U.S. District Judge Denise Casper wrote that \"neither the Constitution nor any statute grants the President the authority\" to change the federal post card application. (Still, Trump has said he's <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2025/08/18/nx-s1-5506210/trump-mail-in-ballots-ban\" target=\"_blank\">planning another executive order</a> on mail voting.)</p>   \n   <p>Rebecca Nowatchik, an Air Force spouse who is Secure Families Initiative's director of external partnerships, says if carried out, Trump's March order would add \"very burdensome requirements to what is already a difficult process\" for military and overseas voters. They <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2024/06/11/nx-s1-4991903/voter-registration-proof-of-citizenship-requirement\" target=\"_blank\">may not have easy access to their citizenship documents</a> and could have a hard time finding a secure way of sending them to election officials.</p>   <p>\"This is solving a problem that doesn't exist,\" Nowatchik says. \"There are already these very robust ways of checking citizenship of voters that are voting. It's a system that isn't broken. And there are so many other things that we could be spending time on to correct in this country. And so we're very perplexed as to why these attempts are happening, particularly to a community that's already having a difficult time to participate.\"</p>   \n   <p>In Canada, the country with the <a href=\"https://www.fvap.gov/uploads/FVAP/Reports/rtc_20231113_V10_FINAL.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">largest number of voting-age U.S. citizens</a>, all of these efforts have led Kate Sable to reconsider her rights as a U.S. citizen registered to vote in North Carolina.</p>   <p>Her two adult sons who were born abroad are among the state's overseas non-resident voters who can no longer vote in state elections — a change that Sable fears could lead to more disenfranchisement.</p>   <p>\"Contemplating the thought of not being able to, or my children not being able to, just makes me realize how precious the right to vote is and just how important it is as a citizen of a democratic country,\" says Sable, a member of the Association of Americans Resident Overseas.</p>   <p>She's now making plans to cast a ballot in next year's midterm election from Toronto, she adds, while holding her breath for potential complications.</p>   <p>\"I think it's very uncertain in this moment — very, very uncertain,\" Sable says. \"And I'm just very committed to making sure that I can vote.\"</p>   <p><em>Edited by </em><a href=\"https://www.npr.org/people/795948473/benjamin-swasey\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Benjamin Swasey</em></a></p>\n</div>"

Since then, the Democrats' limited influence in Washington has become evident as President Trump and the GOP passed a massive partisan spending and tax plan. Now, Democrats are seeking an extension of Affordable Care Act subsidies set to expire this year. Grisales says the Senate will hold another vote, and with a few Democrats crossing party lines Tuesday night to vote with Republicans, the GOP <a href=\"https://one.npr.org/?sharedMediaId=nx-s1-5559115:x\" target=\"_blank\">could be looking to build on that</a>.</li><li>🎧 <strong>Many federal workers will not receive their pay during the shutdown</strong>, says NPR's Andrea Hsu. In 2019, Congress passed a law requiring that federal employees receive back pay once a shutdown ends. However, the White House has threatened to fire many federal workers during this shutdown. Yesterday, two unions representing federal employees filed a lawsuit, arguing that the administration's threats of mass layoffs during a government shutdown are an <a href=\"https://one.npr.org/?sharedMediaId=nx-s1-5559115:x\" target=\"_blank\">unlawful abuse of power</a> by the administration. The unions claim the threats are aimed at punishing workers and pressuring Democrats in Congress to cave.</li><li>➡️<strong> A new NPR/PBS News/Marist poll indicates that Republicans would face more blame</strong> than Democrats for a government shutdown. However, a <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2025/09/30/nx-s1-5557396/poll-shutdown-congress-trump-approval-rating\" target=\"_blank\">significant percentage would blame</a> both parties equally.</li><li>➡️ <strong>History tells us that during a shutdown, visitors will likely find shuttered doors at major cultural institutions</strong> like Smithsonian museums.

At the gathering in Quantico, Va., Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth emphasized to the generals that the <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2025/09/30/nx-s1-5557232/hegseth-generals-trump\" target=\"_blank\">purpose of the department</a> would solely be \"war fighting.\" Hegseth spoke about toughening physical fitness standards for those in combat jobs, saying he wants men and women to achieve the highest male standard. <br /></p>   <ul><li>🎧<strong> One Marine officer who's well-versed on creating physical fitness tests estimated that</strong> meeting the highest male standard of fitness could result in losing 15 to 20 percent of women in those combat roles. Hegseth thinks overall the military hasn't been tough enough and wants drill sergeants to be harder on recruits, says NPR's Tom Bowman. The president stated he informed Hegseth he should <a href=\"https://one.npr.org/?sharedMediaId=nx-s1-5559115:x\" target=\"_blank\">use dangerous cities as training grounds</a> for the military.</li></ul>   <p><strong>The president announced yesterday that a deal has been made with Pfizer</strong> to sell its drugs directly to consumers at discounted prices.

With love and intention, interracial couples can flourish, but the journey should start with curiosity, says Nina Sharma, author of <em>The Way You Make Me Feel: Love in Black and Brown</em>. That means having open communication about each other's cultures, by both sharing experiences and asking questions. Here are some essential conversations to <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2025/09/27/nx-s1-5405489/4-essential-conversations-every-interracial-couple-should-have\" target=\"_blank\">help manage some of the toughest parts</a> of being in an interracial relationship. <br /></p>   \n   <ul><li>💞 Try discussing your differences early in the relationship; if you do not, they could become a conflict later on. Some talking points could include: teaching them your language and asking if your partner has ever felt othered by their skin color.</li><li>💞 Talk about how you plan to blend and co-create with your partner in a way to help you both feel understood and respected.

It has completed several stops, including Los Angeles, San Francisco, New York and London, with plans for many more stops in the future. The idea sparked for passionate baker Elisa Sunga about a year ago when she started a small gathering to bring friends and dessert lovers together to eat as many cakes as possible. For the first picnic event, she hoped for at least 15 people to attend, but she soon got far more than she expected. Hundreds of RSVPs flooded in after a posting about it on Instagram. The event has one rule: No cake, no entry. But you don't need a sweet treat to catch a glimpse of the latest sold-out event held in Santa Monica.
