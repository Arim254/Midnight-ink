The Russia-friendly Alternativa Bloc came third, followed by the populist Our Party. The right-wing Democracy at Home party also won enough votes to enter parliament.</p>   \n   <p>The tense ballot Sunday pitted the governing PAS against several Russia-friendly opponents but no viable pro-European partners. Electoral data indicate the party will hold a clear majority of about 55 of the 101 seats in the legislature.</p>   <p>It is likely that President Maia Sandu, who founded PAS in 2016, will opt for some continuity by nominating pro-Western Prime Minister Dorin Recean, an economist who has steered Moldova's government through multiple crises since 2023. Recean has also previously served as Sandu's defense and security adviser.</p>   <p>The election was widely viewed as a geopolitical choice for Moldovans: between a path to the European Union or a drift back into Moscow's fold.</p>   <p>Cristian Cantir, a Moldovan associate professor of international relations at Oakland University, told The Associated Press that PAS's victory is \"a clear win for pro-European forces in Moldova, which will be able to ensure continuity in the next few years in the pursuit of their ultimate goal of EU integration.\"</p>   <p>\"A PAS majority saves the party from having to form a coalition that would have most likely been unstable and would have slowed down the pace of reforms to join the EU,\" he said, adding that \"Moldova will continue to be in a difficult geopolitical environment characterized by Russia's attempts to pull it back into its sphere of influence.\"</p>   \n   <p>The outcome of Sunday's high-stakes ballot was noteworthy considering Moldovan authorities' repeated claims that Russia was conducting a vast \"hybrid war\" to try to sway the outcome. Moldova applied to join the EU in 2022 in the wake of Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine, and was granted candidate status that year. Brussels agreed to open accession negotiations last year.</p>   <p>The alleged Russian schemes included orchestrating a large-scale vote-buying scheme, conducting more than 1,000 cyberattacks on critical government infrastructure so far this year, a plan to incite riots around Sunday's election, and a sprawling disinformation campaign online to sway voters.</p>   <p>In an interview with the AP, days before the vote, PAS leader Igor Grosu also warned of Russian interference, and said Sunday's results would define the country's future \"not just for the next four years, but for many, many years ahead.\"</p>   <p>\"But I believe in the determination and mobilization spirit of Moldovans, at home and in the diaspora,\" he said.</p>   <p>Election day was dogged by a string of incidents, ranging from bomb threats at multiple polling stations abroad to cyberattacks on electoral and government infrastructure, voters photographing their ballots and some being illegally transported to polling stations. Three people were also detained, suspected of plotting to cause unrest after the vote.</p>   <p>PAS campaigned on a pledge to continue Moldova's path toward EU membership by signing an accession treaty to the 27-nation bloc by 2028, doubling incomes, modernizing infrastructure, and fighting corruption.</p>   <p>After a legislative election, Moldova's president nominates a prime minister, generally from the leading party or bloc, which can then try to form a new government. A proposed government then needs parliamentary approval.</p>   <p>Some 1.6 million people, or about 52.1% of eligible voters cast ballots, according to the Central Electoral Commission, with 280,000 of them coming from votes in polling stations set up abroad.</p>\n</div>"

    "body": "<div>\n      <p>NPR's Ayesha Rascoe talks with Senator Andy Kim, a New Jersey Democrat, about his party's strategy heading into a possible government shutdown.</p>   \n</div><div>\n    <p>AYESHA RASCOE, HOST: </p><p> President Donald Trump will meet tomorrow with top congressional leaders from both parties. The White House meeting comes just one day before a deadline to approve legislation to avoid a government shutdown. For the latest on the negotiations and what it means for civil services, we're joined now by Senator Andy Kim. He's a Democrat representing New Jersey. Good morning, Senator.</p><p>ANDY KIM: Good morning.</p><p>RASCOE: Senate leaders John Thune and Chuck Schumer and House leaders Mike Johnson and Hakeem Jeffries will meet with President Trump tomorrow. What do you expect to come out of that meeting?</p><p>KIM: Well, I'm glad this meeting is happening, and I'm glad that President Trump changed his mind. I think it shows that the president is feeling pressure from his position before saying that he doesn't want to deal with Democrats, doesn't want to negotiate. And I think that's because the American people are feeling a lot of pain right now. You know, I'm here in New Jersey, going around my state. People here have been telling me overwhelmingly about just the continued challenges that they're facing in terms of cost of living, health care and housing, and they want relief, and they don't see that from Donald Trump right now.</p><p>RASCOE: What is the party's strategy - your party's strategy - going into these negotiations?</p><p>KIM: Well, the negotiations are about addressing these exact needs from the American people. You know, they're terrified about their health care costs. Starting October 1, we're going to see health care costs increase dramatically for so many Americans, and we want to make sure that that is addressed by this president, by this Republican administration that has done so much to be able to hurt them by gutting Medicaid and so many other issues. So we're going to be fighting to be able to lower those costs for Americans and help them be able to address the needs in their families.</p><p>RASCOE: If Republicans are unwilling, as they have said, to roll back some of those changes that came from the spending bill that was passed earlier this year, that's going to affect Medicaid, that's going to affect medical insurance, should Democrats hold out for a shutdown?</p><p>KIM: Well, look, you know, we'll see how the negotiations go tomorrow in terms of what Trump is willing to move on because we know that, you know, Speaker Johnson and congressional Republicans, they're just doing whatever Trump is saying. So, you know, go in, be able to talk to Donald Trump and see how much this pressure is coming down on him. You know, he is somebody that has said in the past that if a shutdown happens, that it's the president's fault. So we'll see how far he's willing to go. But what we need to make sure we're addressing here are the just high costs that people are facing. And just what I hear from people is just - they just use the word chaos, and they use the word exhausted. You know, they are exhausted by Donald Trump, and they don't see this chaos as helping them. In fact, it's making things more unpredictable in their lives.</p><p>RASCOE: But if there is a shutdown, that would be chaotic, too, right? The Trump administration has threatened mass firings across the government if there's a shutdown. What would you say to those who will blame Democrats for that?</p><p>KIM: Well, no, I don't think they're going to blame Democrats because, I mean, look, even Donald Trump said, you know, it's the president's job to pull people together. You know, look, they see it as him unwilling to govern. Right now, we're seeing a situation where Donald Trump is literally trying to take down and dismantle the other two branches of government. You know, it doesn't want to be able to do what we normally need to do in terms of being able to negotiate. And the American people are seeing that. They're seeing that he is the focal point, the cause of this chaos in their lives.</p><p>RASCOE: Is there any plan for what would happen if the shutdown happens and more federal workers are let go? Is there a message that Democrats have? Is there a plan, you know, to try to support people who are losing their jobs?</p><p>KIM: Oh, absolutely. I mean, we've been fighting all along to be able to support federal workers. I used to be a federal civil servant under both Republicans and Democratic presidents. I served through multiple shutdowns. I didn't get a paycheck, despite working. I know how difficult this is, and I don't want to see this. But what we also see is just a blatant lawlessness from Donald Trump right now. And when they're threatening to fire federal employees, it comes across as just, like, you know, straight up, you know, mafia, straight up, just like, you know, we're going to do whatever we want to do. And people don't want that. So, you know, I think it's going to backfire immensely on Donald Trump if he leads us down that path.</p><p>RASCOE: Should Americans be worried about essential services like weather forecasting and federal emergency response if there's a shutdown?</p><p>KIM: You know, having been through this multiple times, you know, we know some of the things that we're going to have to worry about, and that's what we're trying to close the gap on. You know, we want to be able to make sure that, you know, this is something that if a shutdown happens, if Donald Trump causes a shutdown, that we're going to try to minimize the damages and the challenges facing the American people. So, yes, that's part of the negotiations. You know, we're going to try to do our best to minimize it if it gets to that. I hope we avoid it. You know, I hope Donald Trump comes to these negotiations, willing to be able to address some of these needs that the American people are facing and show that, yes, you know, we need to make sure we come together at this time.</p><p>RASCOE: That's Senator Andy Kim of New Jersey. Thank you so much.</p><p>KIM: Thank you.</p>\n    <p>Copyright © 2025 NPR.  All rights reserved.

    "body": "<div>\n      <p>In our roundup of domestic political news: an announced troop deployment to Portland, Oregon, the latest efforts to halt a government shutdown, and the indictment of a prominent Trump critic.</p>   \n</div><div>\n    <p>AYESHA RASCOE, HOST: </p><p> There's so much happening in U.S. politics right now - President Trump has announced he will send troops to Portland, Oregon, to handle, quote, \"domestic terrorists,\" a government shutdown could come Wednesday and the Trump administration is threatening large-scale layoffs of federal workers if that happens. And one of Trump's most vocal critics, former FBI Director James Comey, has been indicted by the Justice Department. Comey said in a video message that he's innocent.</p><p>(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)</p><p>JAMES COMEY: My family and I have known for years that there are costs to standing up to Donald Trump. But we couldn't imagine ourselves living any other way. We will not live on our knees, and you shouldn't either.</p><p>RASCOE: And that's just some of what's going on. Joining me now is NPR senior national political correspondent Mara Liasson. Hi, Mara.</p><p>MARA LIASSON, BYLINE: Hi there.</p><p>RASCOE: What's the latest about that intended troop deployment to Portland?</p><p>LIASSON: Well, Trump posted that he is allowing the military to use, quote, \"full force if necessary.\" He said it's - they're being sent to Portland to protect, quote, \"war-ravaged Portland.\" It's not completely clear what they're going to do there, and the mayor says there's no need for troops. The city is doing just fine. But of course, this - he sent federal troops to other places like Washington, D.C., and LA and threatened to do it in Chicago. So yet another Democratic-controlled city getting the military from Trump.</p><p>RASCOE: OK. Well, let's talk about James Comey. He's charged with one count of making false statements and one count of obstruction of justice. And this is stemming from testimony he gave to Congress in 2020. His guilt or innocence aside, what's the significance of these charges?</p><p>LIASSON: The significance is that they came at the specific demand of the president. Legal experts say this is a tipping point, that Trump has now bulldozed through the post-Watergate reforms, all sorts of norms and rules that were put in place after the Watergate scandal to protect the Justice Department from political interference from the president. The reforms were meant to send a message to the American people that prosecutions would be based on evidence and facts, not on whether someone is the enemy of the president. But Donald Trump has a different view of the Department of Justice. He calls himself the chief law enforcement official of the country. On the campaign trail last year, he said he would use the Department of Justice to prosecute his enemies, and that's what he's doing.</p><p>RASCOE: Comey, in his video after the indictment, said, let's have a trial. So how strong is a case against him?</p><p>LIASSON: Legal experts say the case is weak. The former U.S. attorney for the Eastern District of Virginia wouldn't file it. Trump then fired him and appointed a lawyer named Lindsey Halligan as the acting U.S. attorney. She's never prosecuted a case before. But convicting Comey isn't necessarily the goal here. Legal experts say the goal really is to send a message to all of Trump's opponents that he can bankrupt them, ruin their reputation and cost them their careers. So domination is really the point.</p><p>RASCOE: Friday afternoon, the president was asked who's next on his list, and he denied having a list, but he did post some names last week on social media - not just Comey, but California Senator Adam Schiff and New York Attorney General Letitia James.</p><p>LIASSON: That's right. The president said this isn't revenge, but when he described why he was doing it, it sounded a lot like revenge. Here's what he said.</p><p>(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)</p><p>PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Well, that's what they tried to do, right? They did it with me. For four years, they went after me. They went after me for four years.</p><p>LIASSON: He also signed an executive order designating antifa as a terrorist organization and telling the government to go after other domestic terrorists. He has suggested that billionaire philanthropist George Soros could be investigated, in addition to other progressive groups and organizations like the Ford Foundation. The New York Times is reporting that the Department of Justice has issued a subpoena for Fani Willis. She's the Fulton County, Georgia, district attorney who charged Trump with trying to overturn the 2020 election, and this comes after Trump has gone after other institutions and organizations that he sees as his adversaries - law firms, universities, media organizations. His top official, Stephen Miller, in the White House, has called the Democratic Party a domestic extremist organization. So this is very wide-ranging.</p><p>RASCOE: I want to talk to you about - you know, keeping the government funded, possible shutdown. What's happening in regards with those efforts to avoid a government shutdown and keep the government funded past Tuesday?</p><p>LIASSON: Well, top leaders of Congress are going to the White House tomorrow. The big four congressional leaders - Senate Majority Leader Thune, Senate Minority Leader Schumer, House Speaker Johnson and House Minority Leader Jeffries - they're all going to be talking about a shutdown, but they don't have a lot of time. There's a September 30 deadline to approve legislation or face a partial government shutdown. Democrats say they won't vote for a funding bill unless Obamacare subsidies, which allow millions of people to buy health insurance, are extended.</p><p>RASCOE: That's NPR senior national political correspondent Mara Liasson.

No reason was given for the denial, he said. He boarded a plane back to San Francisco on Sunday after about 14 hours in Singapore.</p>   \n   <p>\"I think the decision to deny my entry was political, although I am unsure whether external forces, such as the PRC, are involved, directly or indirectly,\" his statement said, referring to China by the acronym for its official name, the People's Republic of China.</p>   \n   <p>Law declined further comment.</p>   <p>A Singapore government statement confirmed that he had been refused entry, saying a visa holder is subject to further checks at the border. It noted that Hong Kong police have issued a warrant for Law's arrest under the city's National Security Law.</p>   <p>\"Law's entry into and presence in the country would not be in Singapore's national interests,\" the statement from the Home Affairs Ministry said.</p>   <p>Singapore has an extradition agreement with Hong Kong but it doesn't appear to cover national security crimes.</p>   <p>Hong Kong police issued warrants for Law and other self-exiled activists in 2023 and offered rewards of 1 million Hong Kong dollars ($127,600) for information leading to their arrest.</p>   <p>Law is accused of colluding with foreign parties and inciting secession for allegedly calling for sanctions and Hong Kong's separation from China in meetings with foreign officials and in open letters, petitions, social media posts and media interviews.</p>   <p>Hong Kong is a Chinese territory with its own laws and regulations, but the central government in Beijing cracked down in 2020 after massive anti-government the previous year, imposing a National Security Law on the city of 7.5 million people.</p>   \n   <p>Law rose to prominence as a student leader of the pro-democracy Umbrella Revolution in 2014 along with Joshua Wong, who is imprisoned in Hong Kong.</p>   <p>Law was elected to the legislature in 2016 but disqualified after he raised his tone while swearing allegiance to China during the oath of office, making it sound like a question.<br /></p>\n</div>"

At this point in the investigation, a possible motive for the attack is unknown, as well as whether Sanford had any relationship with the church or someone who was attending the service, Carmody says. Today, more information is expected to be released about the victims and when the first funerals will be held. Carmody says people in the community have <a href=\"https://one.npr.org/?sharedMediaId=nx-s1-5556767:nx-s1-mx-5737675\" target=\"_blank\">expressed shock and have been overwhelmed</a> by the news.</li></ul>   \n   <p><strong>Four top congressional leaders, two from each party, are scheduled to meet with President Trump today </strong>at the White House. This meeting comes ahead of the Sept. 30 deadline to fund the government. Although Republicans control both chambers of Congress, Democrats are <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2025/09/29/g-s1-90959/congress-leaders-white-house-shutdown\" target=\"_blank\">needed to help clear a 60-vote threshold</a> in the Senate and avoid a government shutdown. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer and House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries were supposed to meet with Trump last week, but the president canceled, saying that he thought their demands were unreasonable. <br /></p>   <ul><li>🎧 <strong>Schumer and Jeffries, along with their Republican counterparts, Senate Majority Leader John Thune and Speaker of the House Mike Johnson, will attend the meeting with Trump.</strong> NPR's Barbara Sprunt says she <a href=\"https://one.npr.org/?sharedMediaId=nx-s1-5556767:nx-s1-mx-5737675\" target=\"_blank\">doesn't believe that Democrats' demands have</a> shifted since last week's canceled meeting. Democrats want to undo some cuts to healthcare programs and make some expanded tax cuts from the Affordable Care Act permanent. If a shutdown were to happen, the White House has instructed agencies to prepare to lay off workers permanently.</li></ul>   <p><strong>Trump is expected to meet with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu today at the White House.</strong> The president has proposed a 21-point peace plan for Gaza. The U.S. is still negotiating the details with Israel and Arab countries. <br /></p>   \n   <ul><li>🎧<strong> The proposal calls for Hamas to release all 48 of its remaining hostages, living and dead</strong>, a person briefed on the plan confirmed to NPR's Daniel Estrin. Once that demand is met, the plan calls for a gradual process where a multinational Arab and Muslim <a href=\"https://one.npr.org/?sharedMediaId=nx-s1-5556767:nx-s1-mx-5737675\" target=\"_blank\">peacekeeping force enters Gaza</a> while Israeli forces withdraw. Estrin says this is the most serious effort yet since Trump entered office to end the war and plan a postwar future for Gaza. There are some difficult points left to resolve, such as disarming Hamas and the role of the Palestinian Authority after the war. Notably, this is an Israel-U.S. negotiation and not an Israel-Hamas one, Estrin says. Next week will mark two years of the war in Gaza.</li></ul>   <h3>Cost of living</h3>   <div>\n            <div>\n        <picture>\n            <source srcset=\"https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/5333x3000+0+0/resize/400/quality/85/format/webp/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fd1%2F84%2F05c7a0d041529de8bd67e48cf301%2Fcost-of-living-fewer-babies.jpg 400w, https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/5333x3000+0+0/resize/600/quality/85/format/webp/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fd1%2F84%2F05c7a0d041529de8bd67e48cf301%2Fcost-of-living-fewer-babies.jpg 600w, https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/5333x3000+0+0/resize/800/quality/85/format/webp/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fd1%2F84%2F05c7a0d041529de8bd67e48cf301%2Fcost-of-living-fewer-babies.jpg 800w, https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/5333x3000+0+0/resize/900/quality/85/format/webp/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fd1%2F84%2F05c7a0d041529de8bd67e48cf301%2Fcost-of-living-fewer-babies.jpg 900w, https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/5333x3000+0+0/resize/1200/quality/85/format/webp/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fd1%2F84%2F05c7a0d041529de8bd67e48cf301%2Fcost-of-living-fewer-babies.jpg 1200w, https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/5333x3000+0+0/resize/1600/quality/85/format/webp/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fd1%2F84%2F05c7a0d041529de8bd67e48cf301%2Fcost-of-living-fewer-babies.jpg 1600w, https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/5333x3000+0+0/resize/1800/quality/85/format/webp/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fd1%2F84%2F05c7a0d041529de8bd67e48cf301%2Fcost-of-living-fewer-babies.jpg 1800w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1025px) 650px, calc(100vw - 30px)\" type=\"image/webp\"></source>\n            <source srcset=\"https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/5333x3000+0+0/resize/400/quality/85/format/jpeg/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fd1%2F84%2F05c7a0d041529de8bd67e48cf301%2Fcost-of-living-fewer-babies.jpg 400w, https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/5333x3000+0+0/resize/600/quality/85/format/jpeg/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fd1%2F84%2F05c7a0d041529de8bd67e48cf301%2Fcost-of-living-fewer-babies.jpg 600w, https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/5333x3000+0+0/resize/800/quality/85/format/jpeg/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fd1%2F84%2F05c7a0d041529de8bd67e48cf301%2Fcost-of-living-fewer-babies.jpg 800w, https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/5333x3000+0+0/resize/900/quality/85/format/jpeg/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fd1%2F84%2F05c7a0d041529de8bd67e48cf301%2Fcost-of-living-fewer-babies.jpg 900w, https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/5333x3000+0+0/resize/1200/quality/85/format/jpeg/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fd1%2F84%2F05c7a0d041529de8bd67e48cf301%2Fcost-of-living-fewer-babies.jpg 1200w, https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/5333x3000+0+0/resize/1600/quality/85/format/jpeg/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fd1%2F84%2F05c7a0d041529de8bd67e48cf301%2Fcost-of-living-fewer-babies.jpg 1600w, https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/5333x3000+0+0/resize/1800/quality/85/format/jpeg/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fd1%2F84%2F05c7a0d041529de8bd67e48cf301%2Fcost-of-living-fewer-babies.jpg 1800w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1025px) 650px, calc(100vw - 30px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\"></source>\n            <img src=\"https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/5333x3000+0+0/resize/1100/quality/50/format/jpeg/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fd1%2F84%2F05c7a0d041529de8bd67e48cf301%2Fcost-of-living-fewer-babies.jpg\" alt=\"cost-of-living-fewer-babies.jpg\" />\n        </picture>\n</div>\n<div>\n    <p><span>\n        Getty Images/Emily Bogle/NPR\n    </span>\n</p></div>\n   </div>\n   <p><em>NPR's series </em><a href=\"https://www.npr.org/series/g-s1-89066/cost-of-living\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Cost of Living: The Price We Pay</em></a><em> is examining what's driving price increases and how people are coping after years of stubborn inflation. </em></p>   <p>Home prices surged during the pandemic, and they have remained elevated. The median monthly payment for a home purchased in 2024 was $2,207, compared to $1,525 for a home bought in 2021, according to an analysis by Bankrate. The first two years of the pandemic saw low mortgage rates and work-from-home policies create a rush in homebuying, which led to a significant increase in home prices. In 2022, mortgage rates shot up and homebuying slowed significantly.

In 2024, approximately 7,100 pedestrians were killed on the road, and more than 1,000 cyclists were hit and killed annually in recent years, according to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. Ryan Sharp, a transportation consultant, and Julia Kite-Laidlaw, a pedestrian and cyclist safety advocate with the National Safety Council, share their <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2025/09/25/nx-s1-5547076/safety-tips-bikers-cyclists-pedestrians\" target=\"_blank\">top dos and don'ts for walkers and bikers</a> with <em>Life Kit</em>: <br /></p>   <ul><li>🚲 Look in all directions and turn around before walking or biking across a road. A driver might not see you in a crosswalk when turning into an intersection.</li><li>🚲 Always walk on the sidewalk or a walking path. If neither is an option, walk on the shoulder of the street against traffic so you can see oncoming vehicles and vice versa.</li><li>🚲 If biking at night, put white lights at the front and red lights at the back of your bike so cars can see you.</li><li>🚲 No listening to music or podcasts in your headphones or looking at your phone. This can distract and prevent you from hearing or seeing oncoming traffic.</li><li>🚲 Use turn signals when cycling. The easiest rules to remember are to keep the left arm straight out for a left turn and the right arm straight out for a right turn.</li></ul>   <p><em>For more walking and biking safety tips, </em><a href=\"https://one.npr.org/?sharedMediaId=nx-s1-5517315:nx-s1-mx-5687937\" target=\"_blank\"><em>listen to this episode of NPR's </em></a><a href=\"https://one.npr.org/?sharedMediaId=nx-s1-5517315:nx-s1-mx-5687937\" target=\"_blank\">Life Kit</a><em>.

The program, created in 2012 to protect children who arrived in the country illegally prior to 2007 from deportation, now benefits around half a million people. During the last few months, there have been reports of DACA recipients without criminal records being detained by federal immigration officials despite the protection the program offers from immigration enforcement.</p>   \n   <p>As Trump expands the reach of his mass deportation effort bolstered by record funding from Congress, immigration advocates and <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2025/09/03/g-s1-86764/daca-democrats-homeland-security\" target=\"_blank\">Democrats are raising concern</a> that those on DACA may get caught in the crosshairs. Nearly 20 DACA recipients have been detained by immigration officials this year, according to the <a href=\"https://homeishere.us/stop-abducting-immigrant-youth/\" target=\"_blank\">immigrant rights group Home is Here</a>. But Republican lawmakers open to a solution are still deferring to the executive branch to broker a deal.</p>   <p>\"I understand they are undocumented. I get it that they broke the law. I get it. But they're needed in the economy and someone gave them a job,\" said Rep. Maria Elvira Salazar, a Republican from Florida who earlier this year <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2025/04/09/nx-s1-5345741/the-politics-of-trump-deportations\" target=\"_blank\">introduced a bill</a> that would provide a pathway to legal status for DACA recipients and others. \"President Trump is a guy who gets things done and he can do it. And I am sure that he will come to the realization that this is what's good for America so we can make America greater.\"</p>   <p>Salazar's bill has <a href=\"https://www.congress.gov/bill/119th-congress/house-bill/4393/cosponsors\" target=\"_blank\">received bipartisan support</a>. But in interviews with Republican lawmakers who have previously supported a pathway to legal status for DACA recipients, nearly every lawmaker was clear: Trump needs to be the one to start talks.</p>   \n   <p>Trump spent the bulk of the campaign vowing to launch the largest deportation effort in American history. While he has occasionally voiced support for finding a policy solution for certain groups, like farmworkers and other migrant laborers, there has been little effort to do so.</p>   <p>\"The Trump Administration's top immigration enforcement priority is arresting and removing the dangerous violent, illegal criminal aliens that Joe Biden let flood across our Southern Border – of which there are many,\" said Abigail Jackson, a White House spokesperson. \"America is safer because of President Trump's immigration policies.\"</p>   \n   <h3><strong>The DACA coalition has weakened in Congress</strong></h3>   <p>In 2017, <a href=\"https://news.wttw.com/sites/default/files/article/file-attachments/2017-12-05-DACA_Letter_1.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">34 Republicans signed onto a letter</a> urging then-House Speaker Paul Ryan to pass a permanent fix for DACA after Trump attempted to rescind the program, arguing that \"reaching across the aisle to protect DACA recipients…is the right thing to do.\"</p>   <p>But strategists and immigration advocates said that the coalition of Republicans supporting DACA has shrunk over the years, as has the sense of urgency to find a solution after Trump's <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2020/06/18/829858289/supreme-court-upholds-daca-in-blow-to-trump-administration\" target=\"_blank\">first attempt to repeal the program failed</a>. Of those 34 Republicans who signed that letter, only eight are still voting members in the House.</p>   <p>\"Allowing DACA to go forward became a political hot potato for the Republicans,\" said Muzaffar Chishti, senior fellow at the nonpartisan Migration Policy Institute. \"Congress always tries to kick the can down the street.\"</p>   \n   <p>During his first network interview after winning the election, Trump <a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/donald-trump/trump-interview-meet-press-kristen-welker-election-president-rcna182857\" target=\"_blank\">said he would be open to negotiating a deal for DACA</a> with Democrats. More recently, border czar Tom Homan told reporters at the White House that \"<a href=\"https://rollcall.com/factbase/trump/transcript/donald-trump-press-briefing-tom-homan-the-white-house-august-6-2025/\" target=\"_blank\">no one is prioritizing DACA</a>\" for enforcement.</p>   <p>On the Hill, strategists said that this early in the administration's tenure, it may be a tall order to envision the cabinet's immigration enforcement leaders at the negotiating table with the Capitol Hill Democrats that would be needed to see a Congressional fix through.</p>   <p>\"The Trump administration's position is that the only thing that is important on immigration is shutting the border. Almost everything [else] to this administration looks secondary,\" Chishti said. \"As long as that doesn't change as a signal from President Trump, I don't think we're going to see much movement from Republicans in the House or the Senate.\"</p>   <h3><strong>House holds out hope on a bipartisan deal</strong></h3>   <p>Attempts to work across the aisle can be seen scattered throughout the chamber. The strongest effort is seemingly from Rep. Salazar.</p>   \n   <p>\"I have no doubt that we have started a national conversation as to what are we going to do with those people, including the DACA kids, who have roots in the country, who have children, who have been working, paying taxes and do not have a criminal record,\" Elvira Salazar told NPR in an interview. \"That is the national conversation that we need to sit down on the table and specifically the GOP, my party and my president. We can definitely solve it.\"</p>   <p>Rep. Brian Fitzpatrick, R-Penn., said his support for DACA has not wavered. A member of the Problem Solvers Caucus, he was joined by fellow caucus <a href=\"https://problemsolverscaucus.house.gov/media/press-releases/icymi-problem-solvers-caucus-members-hold-press-conference-after-returning-from-bipartisan-trip-to-us-mexico-border\" target=\"_blank\">members earlier this month</a> to announce the group would provide a framework to hopefully kickstart negotiations on legislation that could include providing a solution to those who have been here for decades.</p>   <p>\"I look in America and look [at] how immigrants built this country,\" he said. \"So it's really a question for my colleagues as to whether they view America that way.\"</p>   \n   <p>Separately, earlier this year the<a href=\"https://problemsolverscaucus.house.gov/media/press-releases/problem-solvers-caucus-co-chairs-request-meeting-with-president-trump-on-key-bipartisan-priorities\" target=\"_blank\"> caucus sent a letter to the White House</a> requesting a meeting to discuss a bipartisan compromise on immigration. For now, the goal is to come up with a general framework.</p>   <p>Still, there needs to be a strong directive from Trump in order to get the process moving, reiterated Todd Schulte, president of <a href=\"http://fwd.us/\" target=\"_blank\">FWD.us</a>, an immigration advocacy organization.</p>   <p>\"The political reality here is he could snap his fingers and tomorrow we'll have an intelligent conversation,\" Schulte said.</p>   <p>Still, any measure also needs bipartisan support in the Senate where enthusiasm is low.</p>   <p>Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., cosponsored the Dream Act in 2024, which would provide a pathway to legal status for people brought to the U.S. illegally as children. Speaking at the Capitol with NPR, Graham said he didn't see any of the current efforts making much headway while the priority stays on enforcement.</p>   \n   <p>\"If you start legalizing anybody now, that's just another magnet. So I want to turn off the magnets before we do anything,\" Graham said.</p>   <p>Sen. Thom Tillis, R-N.C., who introduced measures to provide some pathway to <a href=\"https://www.judiciary.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/Secure%20and%20Succeed%20Act%20of%202018%20-%20%20One-Page%20Summary.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">legalization for DACA</a>, said he doesn't see movement before the new year.</p>   <p>\"I hope the president goes back to what he said in his first term – he thinks there's room for legal immigration and more people immigrating legally here,\" Tillis said.</p>   <p>Sen. John Cornyn, who, in <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I5vOxJsnZOM\" target=\"_blank\">the past spoke strongly </a>about the need to provide a pathway for DACA recipients, said he believes there are others ahead of DACA recipients in terms of the administration's immigration priorities.</p>   <p>\"These young people who've now grown to be adults have found themselves in a very bad situation but don't see any prospects for immigration bills, including for them, any time soon,\" Cornyn said. \"Thankfully, the border has settled down, but we still have a lot of people in the country who are under final orders of deportation shouldn't be here. And I think at some point, hopefully, we can have that conversation. But I don't think any time soon.\"</p>\n</div>"
