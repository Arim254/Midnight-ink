Vought has argued that presidents — rather than Congress — have considerable <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2024/11/26/nx-s1-5195528/trump-impoundment-government-cuts\" target=\"_blank\">power to control more spending</a>, Democrats and the nonpartisan Government Accountability Office (GAO) have disagreed.</p>   <p>House Republicans have passed a bill that would fund the government at current levels through Nov. 21. But in the Senate, where 60 votes are required to pass the bill, Democrats have insisted on adding a number of measures, including subsidies for Affordable Care Act insurance premiums. They are set to expire, hitting Americans who buy insurance on the Obamacare exchanges with shocking price increases this year.</p>   <h3>Schumer calls the memo \"an attempt at intimidation\"</h3>   <p>Democratic leaders had been set to sit down with Trump on Thursday to talk about the issues, but Trump canceled the meeting, saying Democrats were making \"<a href=\"https://x.com/TrumpTruthOnX/status/1970486815087042821\" target=\"_blank\">unserious and ridiculous demands</a>.\"</p>   <p>The White House said it supports the bill passed by House Republicans. In the memo, the OMB said its layoff notices could be avoided if Democrats decide to support the bill.</p>   \n   <p>Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., called the memo \"an attempt at intimidation\" in a statement released late Wednesday night.</p>   <p>\"This is nothing new and has nothing to do with funding the government,\" Schumer wrote. \"These unnecessary firings will either be overturned in court or the administration will end up hiring the workers back, just like they did as recently as today.\"</p>   <p>Congressional Democrats are under intense pressure from their voters to stand up to Trump after they <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2025/03/13/g-s1-53495/senate-democrats-funding-bill-government-shutdown\" target=\"_blank\">provided the votes to pass a six-month spending bill in March</a>.</p>   \n   <p>At the time, Schumer said that a shutdown would give Trump the power to pick and choose what departments and agencies to reopen.</p>   <p>The plan for layoff notices is a break from the Trump administration's approach during his first term. In 2018, Trump refused to sign a bipartisan stopgap government funding bill because it didn't include funding for his border wall, sparking a 35-day shutdown, the longest on record. But the administration worked to reduce the pain from the shutdown by keeping as much of the government open as possible, and pledging to give furloughed workers back pay as quickly as possible.</p>\n</div>"

He'd received a strong performance review in January, shortly before he was fired.</p>   <p>He was looking forward to finding ways to use artificial intelligence to find inaccuracies in clinical data.

In a heated committee meeting Wednesday, state lawmakers said they're considering a lot of options before deciding in October.</p>   <p>Unlike other Republican-led states redistricting this year, Utah's new map is expected to give Democrats more of a chance at winning at least one of the state's four congressional districts, which could help Democrats in the race to control the U.S. House. State lawmakers were ordered to draw the new districts after a<strong> </strong>Utah judge ruled they had acted unconstitutionally in creating the map used in 2022.</p>   \n   <h2>GOP \"complying under protest\" </h2>   <p>The Legislature's Republican supermajority has made it clear they are not happy they had to go back to the drawing board and are complying under protest. The map must be approved by lawmakers and the court by Nov. 10 to be used in the 2026 midterms, according to Lt. Gov. Deidre Henderson's <strong>o</strong>ffice.</p>   <p>Utah's <a href=\"https://citygate.utleg.gov/legdistricting/comments/plan/156/12\" target=\"_blank\"><u>voided congressional map</u></a> split the bluest area of the state, Salt Lake County, among the state's four districts, making four U.S. House seats safe for Republicans. That split was the biggest critique of the map, especially by county residents.</p>   <p>All of the proposed new boundaries also <a href=\"https://www.kuer.org/politics-government/2025-09-23/as-utah-moves-forward-in-redistricting-a-divided-salt-lake-county-is-inevitable\" target=\"_blank\"><u>divide the county</u></a>, the most populous one in the state, but some only split it into two districts.</p>   <p>Instead of advancing a single proposed map, the Legislature's redistricting committee said Wednesday it will let the public weigh in on any map that has been posted on its <a href=\"https://citygate.utleg.gov/legdistricting/utah/comment_links\" target=\"_blank\"><u>website</u></a> before making a decision. That includes six maps commissioned by lawmakers, as well as proposals submitted by citizens.</p>   <p>Lawmakers will choose from one of those maps, and only those maps, on Oct. 6. The map will go back to court for the judge to approve.</p>   <h2>The national picture</h2>   <p>Though Utah's redistricting originated from a local court case, it's playing out amid a <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2025/09/14/nx-s1-5538407/after-missouri-what-state-is-next-a-redistricting-race-started-by-trump-continues\" target=\"_blank\"><u>redistricting race </u></a>around the country set off by President Trump.</p>   \n   <p>Usually, states redistrict early in the decade using new census numbers. In order to try to keep the GOP hold on the U.S. House and worried about midterm election losses, Trump has asked states led by Republicans to redistrict ahead of 2026 and help their party win seats.</p>   <p>At Trump's urging, Texas passed a new map that could help Republicans win five more seats. <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2025/08/22/nx-s1-5511300/california-texas-redistricting-shifts\" target=\"_blank\"><u>To counter, California's</u></a> Democratic leaders are asking voters to approve a new map that could help their party win five seats on November 4. <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2025/09/12/nx-s1-5537977/redistricting-midterms-trump-missouri\" target=\"_blank\"><u>Missouri has followed</u></a> Trump's lead, with the Republican-led Legislature passing a map that could oust a Democratic congressman.</p>   <p>Republican leaders in Indiana and Florida say they are working to follow Trump's call. They and other Republicans across the country say holding the U.S. House is key to maintaining Trump's agenda and preventing investigations of his administration that could be launched by a Democratic-led House.</p>   <h2>The Utahns who sued</h2>   <p>In 2018, Utah voters narrowly approved a ballot initiative known as Proposition 4 that, among other things, created an independent redistricting commission and prohibited gerrymandering. In 2020, the Legislature repealed and replaced the initiative with a law that weakened the commission's role and took out the prohibition on partisan gerrymandering.</p>   <p>In 2022, the League of Women Voters of Utah, Mormon Women for Ethical Government and a handful of Utah voters sued the Legislature. They alleged that the Legislature violated Utahns' right to alter and reform their government and that the state's 2021 congressional map was gerrymandered to favor Republicans.</p>   <p>In <a href=\"https://www.kuer.org/politics-government/2025-08-25/judge-tosses-out-utahs-congressional-maps-in-long-fought-redistricting-case\" target=\"_blank\"><u>August of this year</u></a>, a Utah judge ruled that the Legislature's override of Proposition 4 was unconstitutional. Because the state's 2021 congressional map was a product of that unconstitutional act, the judge said it had to go.</p>   <p>Without valid maps, the Legislature has to redraw the boundaries in accordance with Proposition 4, which the judge also reinstated.</p>   \n   <p>At the same time, GOP state lawmakers are trying to pass a <a href=\"https://le.utah.gov/interim/2025/pdf/00003633.pdf\" target=\"_blank\"><u>bill</u></a> that creates a single standardized method for testing \"partisan symmetry\" in congressional maps to determine if boundaries are fair.</p>   <p>But Democrats on the committee argued that the test does not work in states like Utah where one party dominates in statewide elections.</p>   <p>That proposed test is what most concerns Elizabeth Rasmussen, executive director of Better Boundaries, the group that backed Proposition 4.</p>   <p>\"I just see this as weaponization of the process to get a map they want,\" Rasmussen says.</p>   <p>If the plaintiffs in the lawsuit have objections to the Legislature's map, they are also allowed to submit a proposal to the court. If that happens, there will be additional court hearings in late October to decide which map will be used.</p>\n</div>"

And while a National Park Service permit issued for the statue — obtained by NPR — allowed it to remain there until Sunday evening, <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/washingtondc/comments/1np7z0z/us_park_police_remove_statue_of_donald_trump_and/\" target=\"_blank\">eyewitness video </a>showed U.S. Park Police hauling it onto a truck before sunrise on Wednesday.</p>   <p>A spokesperson for the Department of the Interior told NPR that the statue was removed \"because it was not compliant with the permit issued,\" though did not specify how.</p>   <p>The Secret Handshake is accusing the Trump administration of illegally removing the statue as part of its crackdown on speech it disagrees with, on the heels of ABC's temporary suspension of Jimmy Kimmel's late-night show <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2025/09/18/nx-s1-5545720/kimmel-abc-carr-fcc-jawboning\" target=\"_blank\">under pressure</a> from the Federal Communications Commission.</p>   <p>The White House did not respond to NPR's questions about the artwork's removal, but had previously criticized it.</p>   \n   <p>\"Liberals are free to waste their money however they see fit – but it's not news that Epstein knew Donald Trump, because Donald Trump kicked Epstein out of his club for being a creep,\" White House spokesperson Abigail Jackson told NPR on Wednesday.</p>   <p>A Secret Handshake group member, who spoke on the condition of anonymity out of fear of retaliation from the Trump administration, told NPR over email that it found out late Tuesday that \"some people within the parks department aka most likely the Trump administration were trying to find ways to say we were not in compliance.\"</p>   \n   <p>They said the group was reassured that if that were to happen, it would get 24 hours' written notice to remove the statue themselves, as required by the permit.</p>   <p>\"Instead, they showed up in the middle of the night without notice and physically toppled the statue, broke it, and took it away,\" the member said. \"We do not know where it is.\"</p>   <p>On Wednesday afternoon, the group member told NPR they had been allowed to see the statue, and sent NPR pictures of the figures, ripped from their pedestals and broken into pieces.</p>   <h3>Friendship as a sensitive subject </h3>   <div>\n            <div>\n        <picture>\n            <source srcset=\"https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/6000x4000+0+0/resize/400/quality/85/format/webp/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F07%2F3b%2F9b099f254c898b402949f1e1eb7d%2Fgettyimages-2236613518.jpg 400w, https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/6000x4000+0+0/resize/600/quality/85/format/webp/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F07%2F3b%2F9b099f254c898b402949f1e1eb7d%2Fgettyimages-2236613518.jpg 600w, https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/6000x4000+0+0/resize/800/quality/85/format/webp/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F07%2F3b%2F9b099f254c898b402949f1e1eb7d%2Fgettyimages-2236613518.jpg 800w, https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/6000x4000+0+0/resize/900/quality/85/format/webp/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F07%2F3b%2F9b099f254c898b402949f1e1eb7d%2Fgettyimages-2236613518.jpg 900w, https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/6000x4000+0+0/resize/1200/quality/85/format/webp/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F07%2F3b%2F9b099f254c898b402949f1e1eb7d%2Fgettyimages-2236613518.jpg 1200w, https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/6000x4000+0+0/resize/1600/quality/85/format/webp/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F07%2F3b%2F9b099f254c898b402949f1e1eb7d%2Fgettyimages-2236613518.jpg 1600w, https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/6000x4000+0+0/resize/1800/quality/85/format/webp/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F07%2F3b%2F9b099f254c898b402949f1e1eb7d%2Fgettyimages-2236613518.jpg 1800w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1025px) 650px, calc(100vw -

They socialized at parties and flew together on Epstein's private jet. In one <a href=\"https://nymag.com/nymetro/news/people/n_7912/\" target=\"_blank\">2002 interview</a>, Trump called Epstein \"a terrific guy\" and referenced their shared penchant for beautiful women.</p>   <p>But Trump says their friendship ended before 2006, when Epstein was indicted for soliciting prostitution.</p>   <p>In 2019, after Epstein was arrested on sex trafficking charges, Trump <a href=\"https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/trump-jeffrey-epstein-years-including-2024-campaign-trail/story?id=123778541\" target=\"_blank\">repeatedly described</a> himself as \"not a fan\" and said the two hadn't spoken since a falling out some 15 years earlier. And in July, Trump said he had banned Epstein from his Mar-a-Lago club in Florida after Epstein <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2025/07/29/nx-s1-5484136/trump-jeffrey-epstein-mar-a-lago-ghislaine-maxwell\" target=\"_blank\">repeatedly \"stole\" employees</a> who worked at the spa there, including some young women.</p>   <p>Epstein's life and death remain the focus of intense public <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2025/07/25/nx-s1-5478620/jeffrey-epstein-crimes-timeline-legal-case\" target=\"_blank\">scrutiny and suspicion</a>, particularly when it comes to allegations that his wealthy, powerful network helped facilitate and cover up his crimes. The names of several powerful figures — including Trump — have appeared in flight logs and other already-released records related to Epstein's case, though there is no public evidence that they have been involved in Epstein's offenses.</p>   \n   <p>Trump's refusal to <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2025/07/25/nx-s1-5478620/jeffrey-epstein-crimes-timeline-legal-case\" target=\"_blank\">release the Epstein files</a> — despite his campaign vow to do so — has prompted criticism across the aisle and pressure from Congress.</p>   <p>In August, the House Oversight Committee <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2025/08/22/nx-s1-5509535/epstein-files-congress-house-oversight-committee-trump\" target=\"_blank\">subpoenaed thousands of pages</a> of records from the Justice Department regarding its investigation into Epstein and his associate Ghislaine Maxwell. It released some of those documents earlier this month.</p>   <p>Among them was a copy of a book of 50th birthday well-wishes that Epstein's friends had made for him in 2003, which includes a <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2025/09/08/nx-s1-5534397/trump-epstein-birthday-book\" target=\"_blank\">crude image signed by Trump</a>. When the <em>Wall Street Journal </em>first reported on the note in July, Trump dismissed it as \"fake\" and <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2025/07/29/nx-s1-5482955/trump-epstein-murdoch-deposition-lawsuit\" target=\"_blank\">sued the publication</a> for defamation.</p>   \n   <p>Notably, the plaques beneath the Trump and Epstein statues that briefly graced the mall bear quotes from that letter, including: \"Happy Birthday — and may every day be another wonderful secret.\"</p>   <h3>A series of satirical statues</h3>   <p>The friendship statue is one of <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2024/10/29/nx-s1-5169978/poop-desk-statue-tiki-torch-national-mall\" target=\"_blank\">several anti-Trump sculptures</a> to materialize in the heart of D.C. in the past year.

That last job brought threats that required around-the-clock security and hostility from Trump, who has said he wants to throw Smith in jail or deport him. (The Justice Department dropped both of Smith's criminal cases, as a matter of policy, after Trump won the 2024 election.)</p>   <p>At the start of his remarks, Smith said he would not discuss politics, and he never referred to Trump by name. Instead, he delivered a call to defend the rule of law, punctuated by recent examples of its erosion.</p>   <p>For Smith, the headlines tell part of the story. Already this year, career prosecutors in Manhattan have <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2025/02/14/nx-s1-5298040/justice-department-eric-adams-fallout\" target=\"_blank\">quit en masse</a> after DOJ leaders sought to walk away from a corruption case against New York Mayor Eric Adams. </p>   <p>The White House issued <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2025/03/28/nx-s1-5343616/two-major-law-firms-fight-back-against-trump-orders-seen-as-retribution\" target=\"_blank\">executive orders targeting big law firms</a> because of their clients or lawyers they hired who had run afoul of Trump. Only days after Smith's speech, not far from George Mason University, in the Eastern District of Virginia, came a marked escalation. Last weekend, Trump posted a message on social media, saying the Justice Department <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2025/09/22/nx-s1-5550132/trump-justice-department-comey-letitia-james-virginia\" target=\"_blank\">needed to prosecute</a> former FBI Director Jim Comey, New York Attorney General Letitia James, and California Democratic Sen. Adam Schiff—and fast. The U.S. attorney in the Eastern District, who had cast doubt on cases against Comey and James, was forced out and replaced with a Trump ally who has no experience as a prosecutor. </p>   \n   <p>\"Political opponents, critics, perceived enemies are targeted for investigation or arrest to silence them, and the prosecutors instead of investigating…cases, they're left to figure out a basis for charges after the fact,\" Smith said.</p>   <p>On the flip side, people close to the president face no danger of investigation or prosecution, even when the facts and the law might merit those steps, Smith said.</p>   <p>\"Where the rule of law is eroding, friends of the president do not have to worry about following the same laws that the rest of us follow,\" Smith said. \"Exceptions will be made. And nobody, I mean nobody, in a president's administration, or his allies, will be investigated or prosecuted, no matter what they do.\"</p>   <p>This week, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt forcefully rejected the idea that Trump is misusing the Justice Department. </p>   <p>\"The President is fulfilling his promise to restore a Department of Justice that demands accountability, and it is not weaponizing the Department of Justice,\" Leavitt said.</p>   \n   <p>But for Smith, and many other DOJ veterans, traditions and norms over decades have been thrown aside along with the idea that the law applies equally to friends and foes. At the heart of the system is the idea that \"law itself must be the same for everyone but importantly it must be enforced the same for everyone,\" Smith said.</p>   <p>Now, current leaders at the Justice Department, who helped defend Trump in cases that Smith brought, seem to have abandoned norms and traditions about nonpartisan enforcement if they clash with what the president wants, he said. </p>   <p>\"They were hired and they're thus driven to get outcomes, no matter the cost to the credibility of the institution they represent, no matter whether those outcomes are legal, no matter whether those outcomes are just,\" Smith said.</p>   <p>This year, grand juries in Washington, D.C. and Los Angeles have been rejecting demands to issue indictments amid the administration's surge of federal immigration enforcement in those cities. And judges have been rejecting search warrants and calling out prosecutors for a lack of credibility. It's extremely difficult to witness, Smith said.</p>   \n   <p>He saved his strongest remarks for public servants at the DOJ and elsewhere, offering praise for their integrity and expertise. Several Justice Department lawyers have <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2025/07/30/nx-s1-5476311/trump-fired-workers-justice-department\" target=\"_blank\">resigned or been fired</a> this year in flash points across the country. </p>   <p>\"Today we have seen conflict between the leadership of the Justice Department and line career prosecutors like never before,\" Smith said. \"And the reason is simple: because the leadership is asking those prosecutors to do things that the prosecutors know are wrong.\"</p>\n</div>"

    "description": "<em>Jimmy Kimmel Live!</em> is back, but <em>New York Times </em>reporter Adam Liptak and former <em>Washington Post</em> editor Marty Baron say the Trump administration is using federal power to control speech and the press.",
    "body": "<div>\n    <p>TERRY GROSS, HOST: </p><p> This is FRESH AIR. I'm Terry Gross. Jimmy Kimmel and his show \"Jimmy Kimmel Live!\" returned to ABC last night after he was suspended indefinitely a week ago. The story of his suspension and return has implications beyond Kimmel, pertaining to conglomerate ownership of broadcast networks and news publications, the First Amendment and freedom of the press, the FCC and President Trump. Here to talk about the larger story are Marty Baron and Adam Liptak.</p><p>Baron was the editor of The Washington Post from 2013 until his retirement in 2021. During most of his tenure, The Post was owned by Amazon founder Jeff Bezos. Baron's memoir about that time is titled \"Collision Of Power: Trump, Bezos, And The Washington Post.\" He was previously the editor of The Boston Globe. In the movie \"Spotlight,\" a drama based on The Globe's investigation, revealing sexual abuse within the Catholic Church, Baron was portrayed by Liev Schreiber.</p><p>Adam Liptak covers the courts and legal issues for The New York Times. Before joining the Times' news staff, he practiced law for 14 years, concentrating on First Amendment issues, including in The New York Times Company's corporate legal department. Let's start with a clip from Jimmy Kimmel's monologue last night.</p><p>(SOUNDBITE OF TV SHOW, \"JIMMY KIMMEL LIVE!\")</p><p>JIMMY KIMMEL: I've been hearing a lot about what I need to say and do tonight, and the truth is, I don't think what I have to say is going to make much of a difference. If you like me, you like me. If you don't, you don't. I have no illusions about changing anyone's mind. But I do want to make something clear because it's important to me as a human, and that is you understand that it was never my intention to make light of the murder (crying) of a young man. I don't...</p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>KIMMEL: ...I don't think there's anything funny about it. I posted a message on Instagram on the day he was killed, sending love to his family and asking for compassion, and I meant it. And I still do. Nor was it my intention to blame any specific group for the actions of what - it was obviously a deeply disturbed individual. That was really the opposite of the point I was trying to make. But I understand that to some that felt either ill-timed or unclear, or maybe both.</p><p>And for those who think I did point a finger, I get why you're upset. If the situation was reversed, there's a good chance I'd have felt the same way. I have many friends and family members on the other side who I love and remain close to, even though we don't agree on politics at all. I don't think the murderer who shot Charlie Kirk represents anyone. This was a sick person who believed violence was a solution, and it isn't. It - ever. And also selfishly...</p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>KIMMEL: ...I am a person who gets a lot of threats. I get many ugly and scary threats against my life, my wife, my kids, my coworkers because of what I choose to say. And I know those threats don't come from the kind of people on the right who I know and love. So that's what I wanted to say on that subject. But I don't want to make this about me because - and I know this is what people say when they make things about them.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>KIMMEL: But I really don't. This show is not important. What is important is that we get to live in a country that allows us to have a show like this.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #1: Woo.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #2: Yeah.</p><p>(CHEERING)</p><p>KIMMEL: I've had the opportunity to meet and spend time with comedians and talk show hosts from countries like Russia, countries in the Middle East, who tell me they would get thrown in prison for making fun of those in power, and worse than being thrown in prison. They know how lucky we are here. Our freedom to speak is what they admire most about this country. And that's something I'm embarrassed to say I took for granted until they pulled my friend Stephen off the air and tried to coerce the affiliates who run our show in the cities that you live in to take my show off the air. That's not legal. That's not American. That is un-American. And it is so dangerous.</p><p>(CHEERING)</p><p>GROSS: All right, so that was an excerpt of last night's monologue by Jimmy Kimmel. Kimmel went on to praise Charlie Kirk's widow, Erika Kirk, for forgiving her husband's assassin. And he added while tearing up...</p><p>(SOUNDBITE OF TV SHOW, \"JIMMY KIMMEL LIVE!\")</p><p>KIMMEL: There it was. That's it, a selfless act of grace, forgiveness from a grieving widow. (Crying) And it touched me deeply. And I hope it...</p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>KIMMEL: ...It touches many. And if there's anything we should take from this tragedy to carry forward, I hope it can be that, and not this.</p><p>GROSS: So, Marty Baron, Adam Liptak, welcome to FRESH AIR. What was your reaction to last night's monologue?</p><p>MARTY BARON: Well, it was very moving, very emotional and, I think, very effective. I really think that this could end up being an extraordinarily important moment in the history of the country. And you know, I think back to the 1950s, actually. It recalled for me the Army-McCarthy hearings in 1954, when Joseph Welch was representing the U.S. Army. He told Senator Joseph McCarthy, have you no decency, sir? And that really proved to be a turning point when the country turned against McCarthy and his incredibly malicious behavior.</p><p>So, you know, now we live in a time where - era where performative behavior is rewarded. It's all about spectacle. You know, we have a president who really revels in showmanship. So maybe what we need is a different spectacle in this instance, from an entertainer like Jimmy Kimmel, really, as a counterweight, as a corrective, because the standard forms of argument just aren't as effective as they once were. So I thought it was highly effective and effective in a way that traditional debate hasn't been.</p><p>GROSS: Adam Liptak, what are your thoughts?</p><p>ADAM LIPTAK: I agree with Marty. It was, among other things, a robust defense of free speech in the sense that you don't have to agree with what Jimmy Kimmel was saying, although it's hard to disagree with much of what he said because it was so moving. But what free speech requires is that you hear him out and you consider it, and you don't try to stifle it or censor it. That said, my viewing of this was a little frustrating because I live in Washington, D.C., and I learned last night, as I tried to watch Jimmy Kimmel, that the local ABC affiliate is owned by Sinclair, and they had chosen not to air it. And while it appeared on YouTube soon enough, this is not an unalloyed victory. In much of the country, Kimmel remains unavailable, and this fight is not over.</p><p>GROSS: Yeah. I think that between Sinclair and Nexstar, they own about 20% of the ABC affiliates.</p><p>BARON: Yeah, I think they...</p><p>GROSS: They own 70 stations, and I think it's like 20% of...</p><p>BARON: ...Households.</p><p>GROSS: Of households, yeah. That's a lot. And some of it is in college towns in upstate New York and in California. And, of course, Washington, I mean, the argument that they've been making is their listeners don't want to hear this. It's not in the public interest. Well, in Washington, D.C., Adam Liptak wants to see it. You know, a lot of people in Washington, D.C. would want to see it. So they're depriving people of what they want to see as opposed to helping them.</p><p>BARON: I think that's true, and it's going to be - get worse if Nexstar is able to go through with its merger with Tegna. Tegna owns 13 affiliates of ABC. And so when you add Nexstar and Sinclair and Tegna, you're talking about a really substantial portion of the stations that are owned by ABC and a lot of households in this country, including in places where they definitively would like to see this show.</p><p>LIPTAK: And they're operating, it looks like, against their economic self-interests. Certainly, this show will get astounding ratings. But President Trump, Terry, is not backing down. He's doubling down. Just before Kimmel went on, he posted on social media that he thinks this could be another lucrative opportunity for him, that he's collected $16 million in the settlement of a libel suit from ABC, and he suggested that he wants to go after Kimmel now. So this is not over.</p><p>GROSS: I want to quote something that Brian Stelter, who is CNN's chief media correspondent, wrote in his newsletter about Nexstar and Sinclair, the two broadcast owners that are not broadcasting Kimmel. Stelter wrote, (reading) those station owners, Nexstar and Sinclair, have positioned themselves as Trump administration allies, leading public interest groups to raise concerns about the objectivity of the news coverage coming from those stations. A top Sinclair executive famously told Trump back in 2016, we are here to deliver your message.</p><p>Is there anything you can say about the political positions or editorial policies of those two station owners and how that may figure into their decisions to, for now, cancel broadcasts of Kimmel?</p><p>LIPTAK: One distinction that's worth making is that the First Amendment applies to the government, and the government can't censor people. Private companies can make good decisions or bad decisions about what they choose to air or not. And that may be a serious policy and cultural and political question, but it's not a First Amendment question.</p><p>GROSS: So this story is also a business story. Disney and Nexstar have business interests that have to be approved by the Trump administration. Disney, which also owns ESPN or merged with ESPN, they're trying to expand their football coverage, and they're planning to launch a new ESPN streaming platform that wouldn't require having cable. They have a deal to acquire the NFL's RedZone brand, but that needs to be approved from - by the Justice Department and the Federal Trade Commission. So in terms of their business deals, they need to get approval and, you know, might be concerned about alienating the Trump administration. And then Nexstar is trying to buy Tegna, which is a rival company that owns TV stations. It's a $6.2 billion deal, and that requires FCC approval. So do you want to talk about the age of conglomerate-owned media and the sometimes conflicting needs within the conglomerate itself?</p><p>BARON: Look, I mean, I think it is an issue. I think ownership is an issue. It's definitely a point of vulnerability for media companies and for the ability of journalists to do their jobs. Many of these companies have interests before the federal government. They worry that those interests will be put in jeopardy if they alienate Donald Trump. And so it's a big concern.</p><p>But there is no perfect form of ownership, you know? I mean, you have actually a fairly fragmented media environment right now with a lot of influencers and YouTubers and people like that all over the place. In many instances, they have their own conflicts of interest. They may be aligned with political parties, with the president or against the president. Some of them, it's been reported, are receiving actual payments in order to air - I use that phrase air - but to disseminate certain opinions and even provide any sort of coverage. So there is no perfect form of ownership.</p><p>There's the corporate ownership that we talked about. That's concerning. You used to have, you know, business magnates, and you still do, who own media outlets. The Washington Post is one of those. They have their own interests. Private equity is a problem. They treat these media outlets like an annuity and try to extract as much cash as quickly as possible from them with little concern for their future. And look, nonprofits are an emerging form of ownership as well. On the other hand, they have to turn primarily to wealthy philanthropists to sustain themselves and to foundations that have their own causes that they're trying to advance. So there is no perfect form of ownership.</p><p>But right now there is a big concern, I think, about the conglomerate ownership and the ownership by individuals who have commercial interests that are in front of the federal government. And they fear that the federal government under Donald Trump will not approve their contracts, will not approve their mergers if they alienate him, if they support anyone who is critical of Donald Trump.</p><p>GROSS: Well, let's take a break here. If you're just joining us, my guests are Marty Baron, former editor of The Washington Post, and Adam Liptak, who covers the courts and legal issues for The New York Times. We'll be right back. This is FRESH AIR.</p><p>(SOUNDBITE OF LOUIS SCLAVIS' \"FETE FORAINE\")</p><p>GROSS: This is FRESH AIR. Let's get back to my interview with Marty Baron, former editor of The Washington Post who's now on the Steering Committee of the Reporters Committee for Freedom of the Press, and Adam Liptak, who covers the courts and legal issues for The New York Times. We're talking about Jimmy Kimmel's monologue last night and about larger issues pertaining to freedom of the press and freedom of speech.</p><p>So yesterday, when President Trump spoke before the U.N., he talked about free speech, and he referred to the upcoming 250th anniversary of the founding of the U.S. And he said, in honor of this momentous anniversary, I hope that all countries who find inspiration in our example will join us in renewing our commitment, values and those values really that we hold so dear. Let us defend free speech and free expression.</p><p>It's ironic that (laughter) that coincides with what we're talking about - you know, TV stations that refuse right now to broadcast Jimmy Kimmel.</p><p>BARON: This is so hypocritical on his part. He talks about free speech, but he doesn't actually believe in free speech. And all of his policies are contrary to free speech or so many of his policies are contrary to free speech. He's practiced censorship, and it's not just for the press and for late-night entertainers. And I really appreciated Jimmy Kimmel mentioning the free press last night because he's absolutely right that that issue has not gotten enough attention. You know, Trump's been going after the press since he launched his campaign for the presidency in 2015, and he hasn't stopped. He's denigrated. He's demonized. He's actually dehumanized the press thousands of times. And he's trying to extinguish an independent press in this country.</p><p>And really, the press was the canary in the coal mine. The threat to the free press, it was really an omen of a threat to free speech by everybody - by ordinary individuals, by lawyers, by scientists, scholars, students - you know, everybody. You know, the press is often the first target of leaders who aspire to authoritarian powers, and I think that's been the case with Trump. And so it's extraordinary that - in his U.N. speech, that he would endorse the idea of free speech because his policies are not in line with the idea of free speech.</p><p>LIPTAK: And, you know, Terry, the passage you read, it doesn't sound like Donald Trump. That is something a speechwriter wrote on a teleprompter that he managed to read, but it's at odds with what he says in unguarded moments. And he doesn't seem to know - unlike Brendan Carr, the FCC chairman who at least tries to, you know, veil the threat - the Trump threat is unveiled. And we have this phenomenon now of a sitting president of the United States suing news organizations for libel. And we've sort of gotten used to that, like that's a normal thing. But that's a preposterous thing. The leader of the United States thinks that rather than respond to speech with his own set of reasons and policies and, you know, engagement in debate, his approach is to file libel suits. Can you imagine, you know, earlier presidents doing that? It's a different era entirely.</p><p>GROSS: Adam, you had paraphrased what Trump wrote on Truth Social, his social media platform, so let me read it. He wrote, I can't believe ABC Fake News gave Jimmy Kimmel his job back. The White House was told by ABC that his show was canceled. Something happened between then and now because his audience is gone - in capital letters - and his talent - in quotes - was never there. Why would they want somebody back who does so poorly, who's not funny and who puts the network in jeopardy by playing 90% positive Democrat garbage? He's yet another arm of the DNC, and to the best of my knowledge, that would be a major illegal campaign contribution. I think we're going to test ABC out on this. Let's see how we do. Last time I went after them, they gave me $16 million. This one sounds even more lucrative. A true bunch of losers. Let Jimmy Kimmel rot in his bad ratings.</p><p>Adam, do you want to break down what you make of that?</p><p>LIPTAK: I mean, every part of it is disturbing and unseemly. The notion that he can sue Kimmel - for what? For a joke? And this idea that political commentary is a campaign contribution is, you know, entirely at odds with the law. It's hard to know what to make of it, except that it's sort of an incoherent rant.</p><p>GROSS: But it says that this story isn't over.</p><p>LIPTAK: Oh, I...</p><p>GROSS: That, you know, victory has not been won by Jimmy Kimmel just 'cause he's back on the air. That's a very partial victory for him if Trump intends to go after him or ABC and sue for even more money than $16 million.</p><p>LIPTAK: Yes. I mean, Trump is at war with not only the press but even with comedians who make jokes at his expense. I mean, it's beyond unseemly, and it's wholly at odds with the American conception of free speech.</p><p>GROSS: So I want to mention in this context that Brendan Carr wrote the chapter in The Heritage Foundation's 2025 project, which has become a blueprint for the Trump administration - he wrote the chapter on the FCC. Do you have any comment about the fact that he was chosen to write this conservative blueprint?</p><p>BARON: Well, I think he's just following the playbook that he himself wrote. We can see that playing out now. And he...</p><p>GROSS: Following the playbook...</p><p>BARON: I mean...</p><p>GROSS: ...That he put in Project 2025?</p><p>BARON: Yeah, absolutely. He wrote it, and now he's putting it into practice. And these are, without question, authoritarian measures - I mean, that he's going to decide what's fair. He's going to decide what commentary is permitted. He's going to decide what coverage is supposedly biased. And clearly, he's going to suggest bias on the part of anything that's critical of Donald Trump, as opposed to anything that's critical of the Democrats. That's going to be the - his target is going to be anything that's critical of Donald Trump. This is not his role, and it's yet another step toward authoritarianism.</p><p>GROSS: If you're just joining us, my guests are Marty Baron, former editor of The Washington Post, who's now on the Steering Committee of the Reporters Committee for Freedom of the Press, and Adam Liptak, who covers the courts and legal issues for The New York Times. He previously worked as a lawyer representing The Times. We'll talk more about freedom of the press and other First Amendment issues during President Trump's second term after a break. I'm Terry Gross, and this is FRESH AIR.</p><p>(SOUNDBITE OF TED NASH'S \"WATER IN CUPPED HANDS (AUNG SAN SUU KYI)\")</p><p>GROSS: This is FRESH AIR. Let's get back to my interview with Marty Baron and Adam Liptak. Baron is the former editor of The Washington Post and is now on the Steering Committee of the Reporters Committee for Freedom of the Press. Adam Liptak covers the courts for The New York Times. He's also a lawyer who previously represented the Times. We're talking about the First Amendment and freedom of the press and what they mean now in President Trump's second term.</p><p>So now that we know what Jimmy Kimmel had to say on his show, let's talk about the FCC's role in this story. And I want to start with two clips from FCC commissioner. Now, he's the chair of the Federal Communications Commission. And first, I want to play what he had to say after the Kimmel broadcast that created all this controversy. So here's Brendan Carr.</p><p>(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)</p><p>BRENDAN CARR: I've been very clear from the moment that I have become chairman of the FCC, I want to reinvigorate the public interest. And what people don't understand is that the broadcasters - and you've gotten this right - are entirely different than people that use other forms of communication. They have a license granted by us at the FCC, and that comes with it an obligation to operate in the public interest. And we can get into some ways that we've been trying to reinvigorate the public interest and some changes that we've seen. But frankly, when you see stuff like this, I mean, look, we can do this the easy way or the hard way. These companies can find ways to change conduct, to take action, frankly, on Kimmel, or, you know, there's going to be additional work for the FCC ahead.</p><p>GROSS: So that was the chair of the FCC, Brendan Carr. He was speaking to Benny Johnson. Benny Johnson is a right-wing podcaster. So let's hear what he had to say Monday. And this was at the Concordia Annual Summit in New York City.</p><p>(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)</p><p>CARR: What happens at the FCC is when you have a broadcast license, there's conditions. There's a public interest standard, which means you have to operate consistent with the public interest. And one of the things that the FC has in our case law and our precedent is this concept of a news distortion complaint. And what I spoke about last week was that when concerns are raised about news distortion, there's a way - there's an easy way for parties to address that and work that out. And in the main, that takes place between local television stations that are licensed by the FCC and what we call national programmers like Disney. They work that out, and there doesn't need to be any involvement of the FCC.</p><p>Now, if they don't, there's a way that's not as easy, which is someone can file a complaint at the FCC. And then the FCC, by law, as set up by Congress, has to adjudicate that complaint. And what I've been very clear in the context of the Kimmel episode is the FCC, and myself in particular, have expressed no view on the ultimate merits, had something like that been filed, what our take would be one way or the other.</p><p>GROSS: OK. So in the first clip, he was talking about changing Jimmy Kimmel's conduct. He was talking about Kimmel's conduct on the show. And in the second clip, he's saying, I was just referring to, like, the process that the FCC goes through. You could work it out among, you know, Kimmel and Disney, or you could do it the hard way and work it out through the FCC. And he was talking about news distortion. So how do you interpret these two separate clips? And do you see him as just clarifying what he had to say? 'Cause he said that Democrats had distorted what he was saying the first time around. So do you see this as a clarification or as a walking back?</p><p>BARON: Well, I think it's really neither. I think what he said at the beginning was clearly a threat. I think it's also important to remember that - how Trump was able to extract a settlement from Paramount when it was trying to execute its merger with Skydance. Paramount, of course, was the owner of CBS, and now Skydance is. But under that scenario, Trump had sued CBS under the Texas law normally applied to false advertising, and he was seeking this sum of $20 billion - an absurd sum - over how \"60 Minutes\" had ended at a campaign interview with Kamala Harris.</p><p>And what happened then was that at about the same time, a conservative group filed a complaint with the FCC alleging news distortion along the very same lines that Trump alleged in his private litigation. And so what Carr did in those circumstances was that he said that he'd take up that complaint by the conservative group - he'd take that into consideration in deciding whether to approve the Paramount-Skydance merger. And in that way, he was able to say he wasn't responding to Trump's lawsuit. He wasn't working on behalf of Trump. He was simply responding to a complaint from this conservative group. But it's not difficult to imagine that there's some level of coordination or at least like-minded thinking that these things are all happening at the same time, and it gives Carr deniability that he's really responding to pressure from Donald Trump. And it allows him to say, I'm just responding to a complaint that was filed with the FCC under the normal rules.</p><p>LIPTAK: There is a line of Supreme Court precedent here that's quite relevant that says the government and the president has a bully pulpit and is permitted to try to persuade people that its policies are the right ones. But what it's not permitted to do is to use coercion backed by threats that the government, through regulation or otherwise, will punish you if you don't do what it wants. And these Carr statements at least bump up next to that line.</p><p>The Supreme Court in 1963 in a case called Bantam Books said that a Rhode Island commission concerned about indecent books could not lean on a book distributor and say, you know, you'd be better off. We'd hate to refer you to a prosecutor. If - you might want to blacklist the following books. And the Supreme Court says that violates the First Amendment, that leaning on an intermediary to try to suppress the speech of somebody else violates the First Amendment. And just last year, and unanimously, the Supreme Court said that the NRA's free speech rights were jeopardized when a New York insurance commissioner after the Parkland school shooting urged insurance companies not to do business with the NRA. And the Supreme Court again says, that kind of coercion, that use of regulatory power, rather than persuasion, coercion, violates the First Amendment. And that maps onto pretty plainly what we're seeing here.</p><p>GROSS: So the Pentagon has announced a new policy that if you are a Pentagon reporter, you have to take a pledge. Marty, do you want to describe what the pledge is?</p><p>BARON: Well, essentially, the pledge is that anybody who's covering the Pentagon has to pledge that are - they will not collect or distribute - disseminate any information that wasn't officially released by the Department of Defense. And so that's the - whether it's classified or unclassified, it doesn't matter. So that's the policy. And now news organizations have to decide whether they're going to sign that sort of pledge. I would argue that they definitively should not sign such a pledge and that they should work together and all deciding not to sign that pledge.</p><p>GROSS: Why would you say definitively they should not sign the pledge?</p><p>BARON: Well, I mean, basically, what the Department of Defense is now asking of journalists is that they convert themselves into extensions of the Public Relations Department, that they not perform as journalists, independent journalists, that they essentially - I think any journalist who would sign such a pledge instantly becomes something else entirely. They become a propagandist for the Department of Defense. So there's a big difference between being just an outfit that disseminates press releases from the Department of Defense and being a journalist who covers it with full independence.</p><p>GROSS: Adam, what would you say about First Amendment issues in terms of this pledge and, you know...</p><p>LIPTAK: I...</p><p>GROSS: ...Freedom of the press?</p><p>LIPTAK: I mean, it's preposterous. It's laughable. It's a plain violation of the First Amendment. And as Marty says, it's a nonstarter. I mean, no serious journalist would consider signing a thing. And if you did sign a thing, you would no longer be a serious journalist, or any kind of journalist.</p><p>GROSS: So, you know, President Trump has filed multiple lawsuits against newspapers, TV networks - CBS, ABC. And he has settled out of court with CBS and ABC. Although he says he won, meaning that he won in court, he just - it was settled out of court. But they each paid, like, $16 million. How do you interpret that, standing outside of this? Do you see them as having caved to Trump or just avoided worst nightmares? Like, do you have an interpretation?</p><p>BARON: I think they caved. They clearly feared Trump's power. I mean, ABC's settlement came before Trump actually took office, but they feared what the consequences would be once he did take office. The agreement by Paramount regarding Trump's allegations against CBS were because they felt they needed to execute a merger - a merger with Skydance. And they wanted to execute that merger, and it was clear to them that that merger would not go through unless they reached an agreement. And sure enough, as soon as they reached that agreement of paying $16 million, which purportedly is going to the Trump library, the agreement was - an agreement was struck. The merger was approved.</p><p>But it also came with a side deal that Trump himself has confirmed. And in order to execute that merger, Paramount felt that it needed to reach this agreement, and Skydance felt that it needed to meet its agreement to provide this so-called public service advertising. And by the way, it also agreed to have a so-called ombudsman. And it has now named that ombudsman, who came from a very conservative, far-right organization called the Hudson Institute - someone who doesn't really have experience in journalism at all. And he will now be the ombudsman at CBS.</p><p>LIPTAK: These lawsuits were - one of them, the ABC lawsuit - very weak. The other, the CBS lawsuit - laughable, preposterous. And not long ago, no serious news organization would have contemplated settling either lawsuit. So it's hard to interpret it as anything other than caving to pressure. Or it's not hard to understand it as a kind of a bribe to pay the president of the United States money when you have a business before the federal government.</p><p>GROSS: Well, let me reintroduce you both. If you're just joining us, my guests are Adam Liptak, who covers the courts for The New York Times. He's also a lawyer who previously represented the Times. Also with us is Marty Baron, the former editor of The Washington Post, who's now on the Steering Committee of the Reporters Committee for Freedom of the Press. We'll be right back. This is FRESH AIR.</p><p>(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)</p><p>GROSS: This is FRESH AIR. Let me reintroduce my guests if you're just joining us. Marty Baron is the former editor of The Washington Post. He's currently on the Steering Committee of the Reporters Committee for Freedom of the Press. Adam Liptak covers the courts for The New York Times. He's also a lawyer who previously represented The Times. We're talking about what the First Amendment and freedom of the press mean now in President Trump's second term.</p><p>So Trump has sued The New York Times three times. The first two were thrown out. The third decision was reached last week. It's not a final decision. Adam, you used to be The New York Times' lawyer. You've done a lot of First Amendment cases. Tell us about what the suit is and what the judge's comments were.</p><p>LIPTAK: Well, it dignifies it to call it a suit. It's a screed. It's a rant with a legal caption on it. And...</p><p>GROSS: It's officially a defamation suit.</p><p>LIPTAK: Yes. It seems the president thinks The Times defamed him by not giving him enough credit for his business acumen. And in a telling development, federal judge in Florida, Republican appointee, throughout - provisionally; they can refile - but throughout the lawsuit, for being a violation of the fundamental rule in civil procedure that when you sue somebody, you should, in plain and short terms, say what was false and what your claim is. And he said this document that the president's lawyers filed, you know, failed that basic test that every lawyer should know.</p><p>BARON: I thought this lawsuit was this - I mean, which was for $15 billion, by the way, and it's hard to see any damages that Trump has suffered. He - as he himself says in that lawsuit, he won the election with a wide margin of electoral votes and calls it a - he likes to call it a landslide. And now, on page 10 of that lawsuit, you know, Trump's lawyers - they assert his - as they call it, his sui generis charisma, his singular brilliance, his unique business acumen, and suggest later that he single-mindedly revolutionized the television business. You know, anyone who looks in the mirror in the morning and marvels at himself that way, I think, would naturally view anything less flattering as defamation. And I think the federal judge who dismissed the lawsuit provisionally, he was correct in calling it just - that lawsuit - mostly invective and mostly public relations.</p><p>GROSS: Can I just read a couple of excerpts of the judge's writing? Because it really reads like a book critic's review of a terrible book. The judge says that the complaint was unnecessarily lengthy and digressive. He criticized Trump's lawyers for waiting until Page 80 to lodge a formal allegation of defamation and for including ahead of it dozens of, quote, \"florid and enervating pages lavishing praise on the president and enumerating a range of grievances.\" I actually looked up enervating. I know the word. I read it in context, but I never knew exactly what it meant. So it means to reduce your strength or mental vigor. So that's what he's accusing the writing here of doing.</p><p>And the judge goes on to say, a complaint is not a public forum for vituperation and invective. It's not a protected platform to rage against an adversary. So the judge threw it out, calling it improper and impermissible in its present form. So it gave Trump's lawyers 28 days to resubmit. Adam, any speculation about what will happen?</p><p>LIPTAK: There will be an attempt to satisfy the judge and satisfy the client, and that's going to be hard to navigate because, you know, this is not serious business. This is an attempt by the president to do two things. One is sort of lay out his worldview, which is not the appropriate setting, and the other is to try to punish and intimidate The New York Times. And I dare say that's not going to work either. So it's a weird thing.</p><p>And we should step back for a second, Terry, and sort of remind people that this idea that a sitting president of the United States is going to file libel suits against leading news organizations, it would've been unthinkable for another president to do this. And the notion that the president of the United States should on his own behalf, while in office, file this kind of screen, it's all of a piece with what we've been talking about. It's not serious business. It's an attempt to intimidate.</p><p>GROSS: Well, let me reintroduce you both. If you're just joining us, my guests are Adam Liptak, who covers the courts for The New York Times. He's also a lawyer who previously represented the Times. Also with us is Marty Baron, the former editor of The Washington Post who's now on the Steering Committee of the Reporters Committee for Freedom of the Press. We'll be right back. This is FRESH AIR.</p><p>(SOUNDBITE OF JAY-Z AND BEYONCE SONG, \"'03 BONNIE & CLYDE\")</p><p>GROSS: This is FRESH AIR. Let me reintroduce my guests if you're just joining us. Marty Baron is the former editor of The Washington Post. He's currently on the Steering Committee of the Reporters Committee for Freedom of the Press. Adam Liptak covers the courts for The New York Times. He's also a lawyer who previously represented the Times. We're talking about what the First Amendment and freedom of the press mean now in President Trump's second term.</p><p>Marty Baron, I want to ask you about Jeff Bezos and The Washington Post. You were the editor of the post when Bezos bought the Post, and things went well between you. And The Washington Post, I think it's fair to say, really flourished during Trump's first term, did great investigative reporting, had the slogan democracy dies in the darkness. Compare that to Trump's second term and what Bezos - who he's hired, you know, in high-up positions at the Post and how the editorial policy has changed.</p><p>BARON: Sure. Well, I do think that Bezos did a great job as owner during the time that I was there and for - overall actually, after the time that I was there, so for about 10 years. I think things started to change just before Trump was elected. About 11 days before the election, Bezos made the decision to kill an editorial endorsement of Kamala Harris. I mean, he certainly had the right to do that. I think it's his prerogative to decide that they're not going to publish presidential endorsements. But the timing was a signal that he was fearful that Trump would come into power, that Trump would seek vengeance, as he promised, against his perceived political enemies. And Bezos was always perceived as a political enemy really for one reason and one reason only, and that was the coverage of The Washington Post, which he owned a hundred percent of.</p><p>And Bezos stood up for us during those first 10 years. He spoke eloquently on behalf of the mission of The Washington Post. He endured reprisals by Trump in terms of attacking Amazon, of seeking to increase postal rates that would affect Amazon and then ultimately interfering in a giant $10 billion Defense Department cloud computing contract. And, of course, Bezos denies what I'm going to say here, but I think that he was very fearful of reprisals during the second Trump administration. It was clear at the end of the first Trump administration of exactly how Trump would behave, that he would seek to cut off business to anybody that he perceived as political enemy. So I think that's exactly what Bezos was afraid of.</p><p>And look, I mean, I think the coverage of the Post, the news coverage of the Post is - continues to be really good. They've lost a lot of talented people, and I'm very upset over that, but they have a deep reserve of talent there. I think that's demonstrated every single day with the stories that they do. They have scoops one day after the next, revelatory stories. They're digging into what this administration is doing. My concern has really been on the opinion pages. I think that they have clearly made a sharp turn there. It's not that they won't criticize Trump. They do criticize Trump. But I think that it's become more timid, more tepid, and they're certainly looking for every opportunity to agree with Trump whenever they possibly can, I mean, even publishing an editorial about how they think it's a good idea to bring back the presidential fitness test, for God's sake. They endorsed the idea of changing the name of the Department of Defense to the Department of War, which is clearly just performative nonsense on the part of this administration. But I have to reiterate that I think the news department continues to do an exceptional job of covering Trump, and I admire that. I support it. I subscribe. I urge other people, too, as well, to support that kind of journalism.</p><p>GROSS: So Bezos, of course, owns Amazon. And Amazon is making or has made a documentary about Melania Trump and paying her - my understanding is $28 million for it. And some news organizations have been making the connection between this documentary and Bezos trying to please the Trump administration. How do you interpret it?</p><p>BARON: I interpret it that way. I think it is an effort to do something for Trump personally. Everybody seems to feel the need to do that - people who want to ingratiate themselves with him. Actually, they went beyond that. I mean, Amazon bought the rights to \"The Apprentice\" television series. Of course, Trump was the star of that. In his lawsuit against The New York Times, he reveals that he had 50% rights and the profits from that television show. So I have to assume that he's going to get a portion of whatever Amazon pays for the rights to \"The Apprentice\" television series. So why the sudden interest in an old TV series? It seems to me - I think it's a logical conclusion - that it was yet another effort to ingratiate himself with Donald Trump.</p><p>GROSS: Is there anything you want to add to that, Adam Liptak?</p><p>LIPTAK: Just that the news sign of The Washington Post is a great American newspaper, a great competitor and everyone at The New York Times wishes them well.</p><p>BARON: I will say, by the way, Terry, if I can add, is that I do believe that if The Washington Post were confronted with a lawsuit along the lines of what The New York Times faced, that it would fight back. They do believe in a free press. I think Bezos believes in a free press and that he would defend the rights of that news organization.</p><p>LIPTAK: And I should say just as The Wall Street Journal is doing on...</p><p>BARON: Correct.</p><p>LIPTAK: ...That birthday letter in the Epstein birthday book, which the president said did not exist, and now it sure seems to exist.</p><p>GROSS: So, Marty, the last time you were on the show, you gave us a list of things that you feared would happen during the Trump administration, and some of those things have come true. I'd like you to each say, if you can, what you're concerned might happen next.</p><p>BARON: Well, I'm concerned that this administration is going to seek to incarcerate journalists. It's been salivating to do that for some time. Trump talked about that during his rallies years ago, how he wanted to put journalists in jail so that they would reveal their sources. And I think the groundwork has been laid. I mean, the Justice Department, under Pam Bondi, has dispensed with the previous constraints on the government's use of subpoenas and search warrants to get testimony, to get records of journalists, like phone records and emails and all of that. So I think it'll go to court, trying to ask journalists to reveal their sources. And since the journalists are not likely to do that, I think you can expect to see the DOJ request that the journalist be incarcerated.</p><p>LIPTAK: I agree with Marty. American press law is quite protective of the press for what it publishes, exceptionally protective. But there's a weak spot, and it's the one Marty identifies. The Supreme Court has never recognized a reporter's privilege. There is no federal shield law. And if we publish information from confidential sources, the government can box us in, can go after reporters to try to get their sources. And as Marty says, no respectable reporter will give up a source. And that becomes a real pressure point.</p><p>GROSS: Marty Baron, Adam Liptak, thank you both so much for talking with us.</p><p>LIPTAK: It's great to be with you, Terry.</p><p>BARON: Thank you, Terry.</p><p>GROSS: Adam Liptak covers the courts and legal issues for The New York Times.

General Assembly, a growing number of experts are calling on diplomats to address what they describe as <a href=\"https://www.ohchr.org/en/press-releases/2025/09/gaza-un-experts-urge-general-assembly-respond-famine-and-genocide\" target=\"_blank\">genocide and famine</a> in Gaza.</p>   <p>Israel strongly rejects accusations that it is guilty of genocide in its nearly two-year campaign in Gaza following the Hamas-led Oct. 7, 2023, attack that killed nearly 1,200 people, with another 250 taken hostage, according to Israeli officials.</p>   <p>The Israeli military campaign that followed has killed more than 64,000 people, including more than 18,000 children, according to Gaza health authorities. Almost all of Gaza's estimated 2 million residents have been forced to flee their homes, often multiple times. Many Palestinians, as well as rights groups and some prominent Americans, have said Israel is responsible for genocide in the enclave.</p>   \n   <p>In the United States, the word has started to enter the public discourse. Polls show Democrats and independents are increasingly likely to describe Israel's actions as genocide, even as Republican views have remained steady.</p>   <p>To understand what the term means and how it has become such a battleground, NPR spoke with historians, legal scholars, military analysts and people living through the war. The scholars say it's difficult to hold states legally responsible for any crimes. And some pointed to a thornier issue: the burden of proving that Israel's war in Gaza is motivated by \"genocidal intent.\"</p>   <h3>What does genocide mean?</h3>   \n   <p>The term \"genocide\" was introduced in 1944 by Polish Jewish lawyer Raphael Lemkin to describe the extermination of European Jews during the Holocaust. Lemkin's early exposure to the history of Ottoman attacks on Armenians and the pogroms in Poland was instrumental in shaping his belief that groups needed protection under international law.</p>   <p>In 1948, four years later, the United Nations adopted the Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide, often called the Genocide Convention, defining genocide as \"any of the following acts committed with intent to destroy, in whole or in part, a national, ethnical, racial or religious group, as such:</p>   \n   <p>(a) Killing members of the group;</p>   <p>(b) Causing serious bodily or mental harm to members of the group;</p>   <p>(c) Deliberately inflicting on the group conditions of life calculated to bring about its physical destruction in whole or in part;</p>   <p>(d) Imposing measures intended to prevent births within the group;</p>   <p>(e) Forcibly transferring children of the group to another group.\"</p>   <p>Both Israel and the U.S. have ratified the convention — <a href=\"https://treaties.un.org/pages/ViewDetails.aspx?src=TREATY&mtdsg_no=IV-1&chapter=4\" target=\"_blank\">Israel in 1950</a> and the U.S. in 1988.</p>   <h3>How are countries tried for genocide in courts?</h3>   \n   <p>The International Court of Justice (ICJ) in The Hague, Netherlands, handles disputes between countries, including under the Genocide Convention. A separate court, the International Criminal Court, entered into force in 2002 to prosecute individuals for genocide, war crimes and crimes against humanity. But it has no jurisdiction over countries that haven't joined, among them the U.S., Israel, Myanmar and China. Outside the courts, the U.N. Security Council can authorize the protection of civilians, but that power is often paralyzed by the veto powers of the council's five permanent members.</p>   <p>In Rwanda, the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda ruled that the 1994 mass killings of the Tutsi minority constituted genocide, and it convicted several political and military leaders for organizing and inciting it. In the war following the breakup of the former Yugoslavia, the ICJ found that genocide occurred in 1995 in Srebrenica, where around 8,000 Bosnian Muslims were killed by a Serbian-aligned force. But the court did not hold Serbia directly responsible for committing genocide, only for failing to prevent it.</p>   <p>The U.S. has also formally recognized genocides against Armenians and Darfuris. Then-President Barack Obama labeled ISIS's actions genocide, and President Trump<strong> </strong>used the term to describe the situation facing white South Africans.</p>   <p>Gambia brought a still-ongoing case against Myanmar to the ICJ in 2019, accusing it of genocide over a military campaign that forced more than 700,000 Rohingya to flee. The U.K. and other states argued in that case that intent could be inferred from the mass displacement and harm to children. Myanmar claims it was targeting terrorists, but the court rejected its bid to throw out the case and is now weighing it on the merits.</p>   \n   <h3>Why is \"intent\" in genocide cases hard to prove?</h3>   <p>Genocide is considered the hardest crime to prove in court.</p>   <p>The \"intent\" requirement makes it distinct, said Shannon Fyfe, a legal scholar at Washington and Lee University.</p>   <p>\"Proving intent tends to be the most difficult part of any criminal case,\" she said. \"The ICJ says genocidal intent must be the only reasonable inference from the available evidence.\"</p>   <p>The Genocide Convention's drafters added \"as such\" to require that acts be carried out because of who the group is, not just to achieve another goal — something judges struggle to assess.</p>   <h3>Gaza: Early warnings, early rejections</h3>   <div>\n            <div>\n        <picture>\n            <source srcset=\"https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/3750x2500+0+0/resize/400/quality/85/format/webp/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F82%2Fb2%2F2bb7569b494098869d058eabdb44%2Fgettyimages-2150458806.jpg 400w, https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/3750x2500+0+0/resize/600/quality/85/format/webp/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F82%2Fb2%2F2bb7569b494098869d058eabdb44%2Fgettyimages-2150458806.jpg 600w, https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/3750x2500+0+0/resize/800/quality/85/format/webp/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F82%2Fb2%2F2bb7569b494098869d058eabdb44%2Fgettyimages-2150458806.jpg 800w, https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/3750x2500+0+0/resize/900/quality/85/format/webp/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F82%2Fb2%2F2bb7569b494098869d058eabdb44%2Fgettyimages-2150458806.jpg 900w, https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/3750x2500+0+0/resize/1200/quality/85/format/webp/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F82%2Fb2%2F2bb7569b494098869d058eabdb44%2Fgettyimages-2150458806.jpg 1200w, https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/3750x2500+0+0/resize/1600/quality/85/format/webp/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F82%2Fb2%2F2bb7569b494098869d058eabdb44%2Fgettyimages-2150458806.jpg 1600w, https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/3750x2500+0+0/resize/1800/quality/85/format/webp/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F82%2Fb2%2F2bb7569b494098869d058eabdb44%2Fgettyimages-2150458806.jpg 1800w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1025px) 650px, calc(100vw -

No. The convention is activated by the risk of genocide, not just its occurrence. That's the whole point of prevention. That's the meaning of 'Never Again,'\" Segal told NPR, referencing a common saying calling for the Holocaust to never be repeated.</p>   <p>He added that denying Israel was committing any war crimes, including genocide, allowed for Israel's actions to be justified.</p>   <p>\"As if the Hamas-led massacres that day were not terrible enough, Israel and its allies, primarily the United States, including President Biden, immediately started circulating this atrocity propaganda,\" he said. \"The lies and fabrications — like the false claim about beheaded babies — continuously shifted the focus not to Israeli violence but to the alleged barbarity of the Palestinians, to the point where they were seen as a danger that no international law should apply to.\"</p>   \n   <h3>When did a Palestinian \"genocide\" become a legal claim? A timeline</h3>   <p>In November 2023, the Biden administration <a href=\"https://ccrjustice.org/sites/default/files/attach/2023/11/Complaint_DCI-Pal-v-Biden_w.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">was named in a federal lawsuit</a> filed by the Center for Constitutional Rights and the law firm Van Der Hout LLP on behalf of Palestinian individuals and the human rights organizations Al-Haq and Defense for Children International-Palestine, along with eight other plaintiffs.</p>   <p>The suit alleged that the \"unfolding genocide of the Palestinian people in Gaza has so far been made possible because of the unconditional support\" of President Joe Biden, Secretary of State Antony Blinken and Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin.</p>   <p>Laila Elhaddad, a Palestinian American author from Gaza and one of the plaintiffs, went to court on Jan. 26, 2024, and later told NPR that she knew it was a long shot, but she felt \"uniquely obligated, as an American whose taxes were partly financing the killing of my family members,\" to take legal action.</p>   <p>She added, \"We as Palestinians understood from the start the intent to genocide. Israeli leaders spelled out exactly what they planned to do and then carried it out. We never expected it to go this far. But with no one to stop Netanyahu and no red lines in place, it was no surprise that he felt emboldened to destroy everything.\"</p>   <p>On Jan. 31, 2024, U.S. District Judge Jeffrey White wrote that he found indications that \"the ongoing military siege in Gaza is intended to eradicate a whole people and therefore plausibly falls within the international prohibition against genocide.\" Still, White dismissed the case in 2024, saying the court could not intervene in U.S. foreign policy decisions.</p>   <p>For Elhaddad, the ruling was both validating and bitter.</p>   <p>\"It was cathartic,\" she said, to testify about what her family had endured. But outside the courtroom, she felt silenced. \"Even using the word 'genocide' in opinion pieces was a no from editors I worked with.\"</p>   \n   <p>The hearing of Elhaddad's case, along with those of the other plaintiffs, began just hours after the International Court of Justice in The Hague ruled that it is plausible that Israel has violated the terms of the Genocide Convention in the war in Gaza, in a case brought forward by South Africa. The proceedings remain ongoing and have drawn support from more than 25 countries.</p>   <p>In its case against Israel, South Africa devotes nine pages to claims of genocidal incitement. The filing says Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu <a href=\"https://www.gov.il/en/pages/statement-by-pm-netanyahu-28-oct-2023\" target=\"_blank\">twice referred</a> to the <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Deuteronomy.25.17?lang=bi&aliyot=0\" target=\"_blank\">biblical story</a> of Amalek, saying: \"Remember what Amalek has done to you, says our holy Bible.

Under pressure from the United States, Israel has allowed some aid into the territory, but humanitarian organizations say the conditions imposed by Israel <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2025/09/04/g-s1-86841/gaza-aid-famine-hunger-israel\" target=\"_blank\">severely limit</a> the amount that can reach civilians. </p>   <p>Israeli officials have not provided public evidence to support their claim that Hamas systematically steals aid.

But it is never permissible, even if the war itself is. So war is not a defense. If the legal elements are met, they are met, regardless of other circumstances.\"</p>   <p>On intent, she said, \"If a military leader intends to gain land and removing a group is the only way to do it, that's not necessarily genocide. But if the only reasonable inference from a siege or campaign is that the group itself is being destroyed as such, then that is genocidal intent.\"</p>   <p>In Gaza, she said, that distinction has blurred.</p>   <p>\"There are statements from Israeli officials that suggest intent to destroy, but it's not always clear if they mean Hamas or Gazans,\" she said. \"But I do not think it is reasonable to claim that the siege is a military objective, given that Hamas is already crippled.\"</p>   <p>\"So it may be that the only reasonable inference that can be made about the siege is that it reflects genocidal intent. Objective behavior can, and may here, stand in for objective statements.\"</p>   <p>\"Each Israeli strike may be a war crime, but serially they've destroyed more than 70% of Gaza's buildings and killed tens of thousands, mainly civilians,\" said A. Dirk Moses, Spitzer professor of international relations at City College of New York and editor of the <a href=\"https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/14623528.2025.2558401#d1e104\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Journal of Genocide Research</em></a>. \"In no way can this outcome be seen as collateral.\"</p>   \n   <p>He also said that it is often forgotten that the Genocide Convention includes the destruction of a group \"in whole or in part.\" \"In Srebrenica, 'only' 8,000 men and boys were killed, but they were deemed a substantial part of the Bosnian population. That was enough for a genocide ruling.\"</p>   <p>Sonia Boulos, a professor of international human rights law at Nebrija University in Spain, argued that Israel's justification — that Hamas uses civilians as human shields — has functioned to deny Palestinians civilian status altogether.</p>   <p>\"Even if one were to accept the premise that Hamas uses civilians as human shields, that fact does not alter the genocidal nature of rhetoric that dehumanizes Palestinians as 'human animals,' calls for the complete destruction of Gaza or invokes biblical references to Amalek,\" she said.</p>   <p>\"Such utterances are not only genocidal in nature — they help explain the apocalyptic reality currently unfolding in Gaza,\" Boulos said.</p>   <h3>What led two scholars to change their minds about Gaza?</h3>   <div>\n            <div>\n        <picture>\n            <source srcset=\"https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/4000x2668+0+0/resize/400/quality/85/format/webp/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F10%2Fe3%2F36e60c6e4bbc9cc8ef01400bb58b%2Fgettyimages-2235966818.jpg 400w, https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/4000x2668+0+0/resize/600/quality/85/format/webp/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F10%2Fe3%2F36e60c6e4bbc9cc8ef01400bb58b%2Fgettyimages-2235966818.jpg 600w, https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/4000x2668+0+0/resize/800/quality/85/format/webp/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F10%2Fe3%2F36e60c6e4bbc9cc8ef01400bb58b%2Fgettyimages-2235966818.jpg 800w, https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/4000x2668+0+0/resize/900/quality/85/format/webp/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F10%2Fe3%2F36e60c6e4bbc9cc8ef01400bb58b%2Fgettyimages-2235966818.jpg 900w, https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/4000x2668+0+0/resize/1200/quality/85/format/webp/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F10%2Fe3%2F36e60c6e4bbc9cc8ef01400bb58b%2Fgettyimages-2235966818.jpg 1200w, https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/4000x2668+0+0/resize/1600/quality/85/format/webp/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F10%2Fe3%2F36e60c6e4bbc9cc8ef01400bb58b%2Fgettyimages-2235966818.jpg 1600w, https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/4000x2668+0+0/resize/1800/quality/85/format/webp/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F10%2Fe3%2F36e60c6e4bbc9cc8ef01400bb58b%2Fgettyimages-2235966818.jpg 1800w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1025px) 650px, calc(100vw -

But also, people considering the element of 'intent to destroy' that is part of the U.N. definition of genocide seem to find it more consistently now, in the context of a man-made famine, than they did with respect to the previous elements of conflict, which at least from a distance read more as 'war.'\"</p>   <p>In an August 2025 <em>Economist/</em>YouGov poll, 69% of Democrats and 44% of independents said that <a href=\"https://d3nkl3psvxxpe9.cloudfront.net/documents/econTabReport_sBoaiA0.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">Israel was committing genocide against Palestinian civilians</a>.

The percentage of Republicans who thought that genocide was being committed against Palestinians was unchanged at 17%.</p>   <p>In Israel, only a minority of the population shares that view.</p>   <p>A survey conducted in March 2025 and the subject of an essay in <a href=\"https://www.haaretz.com/israel-news/2025-05-28/ty-article-magazine/.premium/yes-to-transfer-82-of-jewish-israelis-back-expelling-gazans/00000197-12a4-df22-a9d7-9ef6af930000\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Haaretz</em> newspaper</a> found that 82% of Jewish Israelis polled backed the expulsion of Gazans and that nearly half, 47%, said they supported killing all Palestinians in \"enemy cities captured by the Israeli army.\"</p>   <p>Martin Shaw, a historical sociologist and the author of <em>What Is Genocide? </em>and<em> The New Age of Genocide: Intellectual and Political Challenges After Gaza</em>, says that the public discourse reveals how \"some people still think that only events like the Holocaust count as genocide, which no expert would argue. Gaza is different from the Holocaust, but it is still a deliberate attempt to destroy a people, which is the meaning of genocide.\"</p>   <p>Shaw, who wrote early in the war that Hamas' killings of Israeli civilians constituted \"genocidal massacres\" and who now believes Gaza is experiencing a genocide, said there is a new dynamic in how the public understanding of the word is being shaped. Israel, he said, believed that by banning international journalists from entering Gaza, \"it could prevent the world from seeing its atrocities.\"</p>   \n   <p>\"It has tried to kill local Palestinian journalists,\" he said, \"but so many ordinary people in Gaza have filmed what Israel is doing that the world has seen it nevertheless.\"</p>   <p>Israel denies deliberately targeting journalists. International news agencies have criticized past Israeli investigations into its military, <a href=\"https://reutersagency.com/media-centre/reuters-and-ap-issue-joint-letter-to-israeli-officials-to-demand-clear-explanation-for-airstrikes-that-killed-journalists-in-gaza\" target=\"_blank\">stating in a recent joint letter</a> following Israeli strikes that killed five journalists in Gaza that such investigations \"rarely result in clarity and action.\"</p>   <p>The Committee to Protect Journalists says the war in Gaza is the deadliest conflict for journalists since it started gathering data in 1992.</p>   \n   <p>Simon, of Yale University, observes that media blackouts are not new. But in the case of Gaza, \"having social media serve as the source of information has made it much harder to agree on the basic understanding of what's actually been going on, and [has] added more to the algorithmic amplification that contributed to the acute polarization over the past two years.\"</p>   <h3>Beyond debates</h3>   <div>\n            <div>\n        <picture>\n            <source srcset=\"https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/6000x4000+0+0/resize/400/quality/85/format/webp/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F89%2F63%2F920dc9ab4cbda98219d6ad9aa2ee%2Fgettyimages-2220186627.jpg 400w, https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/6000x4000+0+0/resize/600/quality/85/format/webp/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F89%2F63%2F920dc9ab4cbda98219d6ad9aa2ee%2Fgettyimages-2220186627.jpg 600w, https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/6000x4000+0+0/resize/800/quality/85/format/webp/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F89%2F63%2F920dc9ab4cbda98219d6ad9aa2ee%2Fgettyimages-2220186627.jpg 800w, https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/6000x4000+0+0/resize/900/quality/85/format/webp/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F89%2F63%2F920dc9ab4cbda98219d6ad9aa2ee%2Fgettyimages-2220186627.jpg 900w, https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/6000x4000+0+0/resize/1200/quality/85/format/webp/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F89%2F63%2F920dc9ab4cbda98219d6ad9aa2ee%2Fgettyimages-2220186627.jpg 1200w, https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/6000x4000+0+0/resize/1600/quality/85/format/webp/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F89%2F63%2F920dc9ab4cbda98219d6ad9aa2ee%2Fgettyimages-2220186627.jpg 1600w, https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/6000x4000+0+0/resize/1800/quality/85/format/webp/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F89%2F63%2F920dc9ab4cbda98219d6ad9aa2ee%2Fgettyimages-2220186627.jpg 1800w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1025px) 650px, calc(100vw -
