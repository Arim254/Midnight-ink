The Russia-friendly Alternativa Bloc came third, followed by the populist Our Party. The right-wing Democracy at Home party also won enough votes to enter parliament.</p>   \n   <p>The tense ballot Sunday pitted the governing PAS against several Russia-friendly opponents but no viable pro-European partners. Electoral data indicate the party will hold a clear majority of about 55 of the 101 seats in the legislature.</p>   <p>It is likely that President Maia Sandu, who founded PAS in 2016, will opt for some continuity by nominating pro-Western Prime Minister Dorin Recean, an economist who has steered Moldova's government through multiple crises since 2023. Recean has also previously served as Sandu's defense and security adviser.</p>   <p>The election was widely viewed as a geopolitical choice for Moldovans: between a path to the European Union or a drift back into Moscow's fold.</p>   <p>Cristian Cantir, a Moldovan associate professor of international relations at Oakland University, told The Associated Press that PAS's victory is \"a clear win for pro-European forces in Moldova, which will be able to ensure continuity in the next few years in the pursuit of their ultimate goal of EU integration.\"</p>   <p>\"A PAS majority saves the party from having to form a coalition that would have most likely been unstable and would have slowed down the pace of reforms to join the EU,\" he said, adding that \"Moldova will continue to be in a difficult geopolitical environment characterized by Russia's attempts to pull it back into its sphere of influence.\"</p>   \n   <p>The outcome of Sunday's high-stakes ballot was noteworthy considering Moldovan authorities' repeated claims that Russia was conducting a vast \"hybrid war\" to try to sway the outcome. Moldova applied to join the EU in 2022 in the wake of Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine, and was granted candidate status that year. Brussels agreed to open accession negotiations last year.</p>   <p>The alleged Russian schemes included orchestrating a large-scale vote-buying scheme, conducting more than 1,000 cyberattacks on critical government infrastructure so far this year, a plan to incite riots around Sunday's election, and a sprawling disinformation campaign online to sway voters.</p>   <p>In an interview with the AP, days before the vote, PAS leader Igor Grosu also warned of Russian interference, and said Sunday's results would define the country's future \"not just for the next four years, but for many, many years ahead.\"</p>   <p>\"But I believe in the determination and mobilization spirit of Moldovans, at home and in the diaspora,\" he said.</p>   <p>Election day was dogged by a string of incidents, ranging from bomb threats at multiple polling stations abroad to cyberattacks on electoral and government infrastructure, voters photographing their ballots and some being illegally transported to polling stations. Three people were also detained, suspected of plotting to cause unrest after the vote.</p>   <p>PAS campaigned on a pledge to continue Moldova's path toward EU membership by signing an accession treaty to the 27-nation bloc by 2028, doubling incomes, modernizing infrastructure, and fighting corruption.</p>   <p>After a legislative election, Moldova's president nominates a prime minister, generally from the leading party or bloc, which can then try to form a new government. A proposed government then needs parliamentary approval.</p>   <p>Some 1.6 million people, or about 52.1% of eligible voters cast ballots, according to the Central Electoral Commission, with 280,000 of them coming from votes in polling stations set up abroad.</p>\n</div>"

And I think we're beyond very close,\" Trump said in a press conference alongside Netanyahu. \"And I want to thank Bibi for really getting in there and doing a job.\"</p>   <p>The announcement of a peace plan<strong> </strong>comes as the two-year anniversary of the Hamas attack on Israel draws closer — and as a growing list of nations recognized Palestinian statehood last week during the United Nations General Assembly.</p>   \n   <p>Ahead of the meeting, the White House released its multi-point plan for peace. <em>[Scroll down to read the White House's plan.]</em> The 20-point plan would immediately end Israel's war in the territory, boost aid to Gaza, and require Hamas to release remaining Israeli hostages within 48 hours. A \"Trump economic development plan\" will be created to rebuild Gaza, including a special economic zone with preferred tariffs and access rates.</p>   <p>\"The hostages are coming back,\" Trump said.</p>   \n   <p>Netanyahu, who spoke next, said he supports Trump's plans, which he said \"achieves our war aims.\"</p>   <p>\"I believe that today, we're taking a critical step towards both ending the war in Gaza and setting the stage for dramatically advancing peace in the Middle East, and I think beyond the Middle East and very important Muslim countries,\" Netanayhu said.</p>   <p>Hamas has yet to accept the proposal and has resisted specific measures that are outlined in the proposal.</p>   <p>\"All military, terror and offensive infrastructure, including tunnels and weapon production facilities, will be destroyed and not rebuilt,\" the plan states.</p>   <p>Unlike Trump's earlier comments to move Palestinians out of the region and redevelop the Gaza strip, the White House plan says Palestinians will be encouraged to stay and help \"build a better Gaza.\"</p>   \n   <p>\"No one will be forced to leave Gaza, and those who wish to leave will be free to do so and free to return,\" the plan states.</p>   <p>Trump has been one of Netanyahu's strongest supporters, but he has grown more frustrated with the prime minister as the war has dragged on and the loss of lives has grown. Earlier this month, Trump claimed he was blindsided when<a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2025/09/09/nx-s1-5535210/israel-qatar-hamas-doha\" target=\"_blank\"> Israel launched a strike against Hamas officials in Qatar</a>, a key U.S. ally and mediator in ceasefire talks.</p>   <p>A few hours before their joint press conference, Netanyahu called Qatar's Prime Minister Al Thani from the Oval Office and apologized for Israel's missile strike, the White House said in a statement.</p>   <p>\"He further expressed regret that, in targeting Hamas leadership during hostage negotiations, Israel violated Qatari sovereignty and affirmed that Israel will not conduct such an attack again in the future,\" the White House said in the statement.</p>   <p>Trump said he expects Hamas will accept the plans, opining that it will likely be easier now that so many of its leaders have been killed by Israel.</p>   <p>But if Hamas rejects the proposal, Trump said Israel would have his full backing to \"finish the job\" of destroying Hamas.</p>   <p>\"Everyone understands that the ultimate result must be the elimination of any danger posed in the region,\" Trump said. \"And that danger is caused by Hamas.\"</p>      <p>READ: President Donald J. Trump's Plan to End the Gaza Conflict</p>   <ol><li>Gaza will be a deradicalized terror-free zone that does not pose a threat to its neighbors.</li><li>Gaza will be redeveloped for the benefit of the people of Gaza, who have suffered more than enough.</li><li>If both sides agree to this proposal, <u>the war will immediately end</u>. Israeli forces will withdraw to the agreed upon line to prepare for a hostage release. During this time, all military operations, including aerial and artillery bombardment, will be suspended, and battle lines will remain frozen until conditions are met for the complete staged withdrawal.</li><li>Within 72 hours of Israel publicly accepting this agreement, all hostages, alive and deceased, will be returned.</li><li>Once all hostages are released, Israel will release 250 life sentence prisoners plus 1700 Gazans who were detained after October 7th 2023, including all women and children detained in that context. For every Israeli hostage whose remains are released, Israel will release the remains of 15 deceased Gazans.</li><li>Once all hostages are returned, Hamas members who commit to peaceful co-existence and to decommission their weapons will be given amnesty. Members of Hamas who wish to leave Gaza will be provided safe passage to receiving countries.</li><li>Upon acceptance of this agreement, full aid will be immediately sent into the Gaza Strip. At a minimum, aid quantities will be consistent with what was included in the January 19, 2025, agreement regarding humanitarian aid, including rehabilitation of infrastructure (water, electricity, sewage), rehabilitation of hospitals and bakeries, and entry of necessary equipment to remove rubble and open roads.</li><li>Entry of distribution and aid in the Gaza Strip will proceed without interference from the two parties through the United Nations and its agencies, and the Red Crescent, in addition to other international institutions not associated in any manner with either party. Opening the Rafah crossing in both directions will be subject to the same mechanism implemented under the January 19, 2025 agreement.</li><li>Gaza will be governed under the temporary transitional governance of a technocratic, apolitical Palestinian committee, responsible for delivering the day-to-day running of public services and municipalities for the people in Gaza. This committee will be made up of qualified Palestinians and international experts, with oversight and supervision by a new international transitional body, the \"Board of Peace,\" which will be headed and chaired by President Donald J. Trump, with other members and heads of State to be announced, including Former Prime Minister Tony Blair. This body will set the framework and handle the funding for the redevelopment of Gaza until such time as the Palestinian Authority has completed its reform program, as outlined in various proposals, including President Trump's peace plan in 2020 and the Saudi-French proposal, and can securely and effectively take back control of Gaza. This body will call on best international standards to create modern and efficient governance that serves the people of Gaza and is conducive to attracting investment.</li><li>A Trump economic development plan to rebuild and energize Gaza will be created by convening a panel of experts who have helped birth some of the thriving modern miracle cities in the Middle East. Many thoughtful investment proposals and exciting development ideas have been crafted by well-meaning international groups, and will be considered to synthesize the security and governance frameworks to attract and facilitate these investments that will create jobs, opportunity, and hope for future Gaza.</li><li>A special economic zone will be established with preferred tariff and access rates to be negotiated with participating countries.</li><li>No one will be forced to leave Gaza, and those who wish to leave will be free to do so and free to return. We will encourage people to stay and offer them the opportunity to build a better Gaza.</li><li>Hamas and other factions agree to not have any role in the governance of Gaza, directly, indirectly, or in any form. All military, terror, and offensive infrastructure, including tunnels and weapon production facilities, will be destroyed and not rebuilt. There will be a process of demilitarization of Gaza under the supervision of independent monitors, which will include placing weapons permanently beyond use through an agreed process of decommissioning, and supported by an internationally funded buy back and reintegration program all verified by the independent monitors. New Gaza will be fully committed to building a prosperous economy and to peaceful coexistence with their neighbors.</li><li>A guarantee will be provided by regional partners to ensure that Hamas, and the factions, comply with their obligations and that New Gaza poses no threat to its neighbors or its people.</li><li>The United States will work with Arab and international partners to develop a temporary International Stabilization Force (ISF) to immediately deploy in Gaza. The ISF will train and provide support to vetted Palestinian police forces in Gaza, and will consult with Jordan and Egypt who have extensive experience in this field. This force will be the long-term internal security solution. The ISF will work with Israel and Egypt to help secure border areas, along with newly trained Palestinian police forces. It is critical to prevent munitions from entering Gaza and to facilitate the rapid and secure flow of goods to rebuild and revitalize Gaza. A deconfliction mechanism will be agreed upon by the parties.</li><li>Israel will not occupy or annex Gaza. As the ISF establishes control and stability, the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) will withdraw based on standards, milestones, and timeframes linked to demilitarization that will be agreed upon between the IDF, ISF, the guarantors, and the Unites States, with the objective of a secure Gaza that no longer poses a threat to Israel, Egypt, or its citizens. Practically, the IDF will progressively hand over the Gaza territory it occupies to the ISF according to an agreement they will make with the transitional authority until they are withdrawn completely from Gaza, save for a security perimeter presence that will remain until Gaza is properly secure from any resurgent terror threat.</li><li>In the event Hamas delays or rejects this proposal, the above, including the scaled-up aid operation, will proceed in the terror-free areas handed over from the IDF to the ISF.</li><li>An interfaith dialogue process will be established based on the values of tolerance and peaceful co-existence to try and change mindsets and narratives of Palestinians and Israelis by emphasizing the benefits that can be derived from peace.</li><li>While Gaza re-development advances and when the PA reform program is faithfully carried out, the conditions may finally be in place for a credible pathway to Palestinian self-determination and statehood, which we recognize as the aspiration of the Palestinian people.</li><li>The United States will establish a dialogue between Israel and the Palestinians to agree on a political horizon for peaceful and prosperous co-existence.</li></ol>\n</div>"

    "body": "<div>\n      <p>NPR's Ayesha Rascoe talks with Senator Andy Kim, a New Jersey Democrat, about his party's strategy heading into a possible government shutdown.</p>   \n</div><div>\n    <p>AYESHA RASCOE, HOST: </p><p> President Donald Trump will meet tomorrow with top congressional leaders from both parties. The White House meeting comes just one day before a deadline to approve legislation to avoid a government shutdown. For the latest on the negotiations and what it means for civil services, we're joined now by Senator Andy Kim. He's a Democrat representing New Jersey. Good morning, Senator.</p><p>ANDY KIM: Good morning.</p><p>RASCOE: Senate leaders John Thune and Chuck Schumer and House leaders Mike Johnson and Hakeem Jeffries will meet with President Trump tomorrow. What do you expect to come out of that meeting?</p><p>KIM: Well, I'm glad this meeting is happening, and I'm glad that President Trump changed his mind. I think it shows that the president is feeling pressure from his position before saying that he doesn't want to deal with Democrats, doesn't want to negotiate. And I think that's because the American people are feeling a lot of pain right now. You know, I'm here in New Jersey, going around my state. People here have been telling me overwhelmingly about just the continued challenges that they're facing in terms of cost of living, health care and housing, and they want relief, and they don't see that from Donald Trump right now.</p><p>RASCOE: What is the party's strategy - your party's strategy - going into these negotiations?</p><p>KIM: Well, the negotiations are about addressing these exact needs from the American people. You know, they're terrified about their health care costs. Starting October 1, we're going to see health care costs increase dramatically for so many Americans, and we want to make sure that that is addressed by this president, by this Republican administration that has done so much to be able to hurt them by gutting Medicaid and so many other issues. So we're going to be fighting to be able to lower those costs for Americans and help them be able to address the needs in their families.</p><p>RASCOE: If Republicans are unwilling, as they have said, to roll back some of those changes that came from the spending bill that was passed earlier this year, that's going to affect Medicaid, that's going to affect medical insurance, should Democrats hold out for a shutdown?</p><p>KIM: Well, look, you know, we'll see how the negotiations go tomorrow in terms of what Trump is willing to move on because we know that, you know, Speaker Johnson and congressional Republicans, they're just doing whatever Trump is saying. So, you know, go in, be able to talk to Donald Trump and see how much this pressure is coming down on him. You know, he is somebody that has said in the past that if a shutdown happens, that it's the president's fault. So we'll see how far he's willing to go. But what we need to make sure we're addressing here are the just high costs that people are facing. And just what I hear from people is just - they just use the word chaos, and they use the word exhausted. You know, they are exhausted by Donald Trump, and they don't see this chaos as helping them. In fact, it's making things more unpredictable in their lives.</p><p>RASCOE: But if there is a shutdown, that would be chaotic, too, right? The Trump administration has threatened mass firings across the government if there's a shutdown. What would you say to those who will blame Democrats for that?</p><p>KIM: Well, no, I don't think they're going to blame Democrats because, I mean, look, even Donald Trump said, you know, it's the president's job to pull people together. You know, look, they see it as him unwilling to govern. Right now, we're seeing a situation where Donald Trump is literally trying to take down and dismantle the other two branches of government. You know, it doesn't want to be able to do what we normally need to do in terms of being able to negotiate. And the American people are seeing that. They're seeing that he is the focal point, the cause of this chaos in their lives.</p><p>RASCOE: Is there any plan for what would happen if the shutdown happens and more federal workers are let go? Is there a message that Democrats have? Is there a plan, you know, to try to support people who are losing their jobs?</p><p>KIM: Oh, absolutely. I mean, we've been fighting all along to be able to support federal workers. I used to be a federal civil servant under both Republicans and Democratic presidents. I served through multiple shutdowns. I didn't get a paycheck, despite working. I know how difficult this is, and I don't want to see this. But what we also see is just a blatant lawlessness from Donald Trump right now. And when they're threatening to fire federal employees, it comes across as just, like, you know, straight up, you know, mafia, straight up, just like, you know, we're going to do whatever we want to do. And people don't want that. So, you know, I think it's going to backfire immensely on Donald Trump if he leads us down that path.</p><p>RASCOE: Should Americans be worried about essential services like weather forecasting and federal emergency response if there's a shutdown?</p><p>KIM: You know, having been through this multiple times, you know, we know some of the things that we're going to have to worry about, and that's what we're trying to close the gap on. You know, we want to be able to make sure that, you know, this is something that if a shutdown happens, if Donald Trump causes a shutdown, that we're going to try to minimize the damages and the challenges facing the American people. So, yes, that's part of the negotiations. You know, we're going to try to do our best to minimize it if it gets to that. I hope we avoid it. You know, I hope Donald Trump comes to these negotiations, willing to be able to address some of these needs that the American people are facing and show that, yes, you know, we need to make sure we come together at this time.</p><p>RASCOE: That's Senator Andy Kim of New Jersey. Thank you so much.</p><p>KIM: Thank you.</p>\n    <p>Copyright © 2025 NPR.  All rights reserved.

At this point in the investigation, a possible motive for the attack is unknown, as well as whether Sanford had any relationship with the church or someone who was attending the service, Carmody says. Today, more information is expected to be released about the victims and when the first funerals will be held. Carmody says people in the community have <a href=\"https://one.npr.org/?sharedMediaId=nx-s1-5556767:nx-s1-mx-5737675\" target=\"_blank\">expressed shock and have been overwhelmed</a> by the news.</li></ul>   \n   <p><strong>Four top congressional leaders, two from each party, are scheduled to meet with President Trump today </strong>at the White House. This meeting comes ahead of the Sept. 30 deadline to fund the government. Although Republicans control both chambers of Congress, Democrats are <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2025/09/29/g-s1-90959/congress-leaders-white-house-shutdown\" target=\"_blank\">needed to help clear a 60-vote threshold</a> in the Senate and avoid a government shutdown. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer and House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries were supposed to meet with Trump last week, but the president canceled, saying that he thought their demands were unreasonable. <br /></p>   <ul><li>🎧 <strong>Schumer and Jeffries, along with their Republican counterparts, Senate Majority Leader John Thune and Speaker of the House Mike Johnson, will attend the meeting with Trump.</strong> NPR's Barbara Sprunt says she <a href=\"https://one.npr.org/?sharedMediaId=nx-s1-5556767:nx-s1-mx-5737675\" target=\"_blank\">doesn't believe that Democrats' demands have</a> shifted since last week's canceled meeting. Democrats want to undo some cuts to healthcare programs and make some expanded tax cuts from the Affordable Care Act permanent. If a shutdown were to happen, the White House has instructed agencies to prepare to lay off workers permanently.</li></ul>   <p><strong>Trump is expected to meet with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu today at the White House.</strong> The president has proposed a 21-point peace plan for Gaza. The U.S. is still negotiating the details with Israel and Arab countries. <br /></p>   \n   <ul><li>🎧<strong> The proposal calls for Hamas to release all 48 of its remaining hostages, living and dead</strong>, a person briefed on the plan confirmed to NPR's Daniel Estrin. Once that demand is met, the plan calls for a gradual process where a multinational Arab and Muslim <a href=\"https://one.npr.org/?sharedMediaId=nx-s1-5556767:nx-s1-mx-5737675\" target=\"_blank\">peacekeeping force enters Gaza</a> while Israeli forces withdraw. Estrin says this is the most serious effort yet since Trump entered office to end the war and plan a postwar future for Gaza. There are some difficult points left to resolve, such as disarming Hamas and the role of the Palestinian Authority after the war. Notably, this is an Israel-U.S. negotiation and not an Israel-Hamas one, Estrin says. Next week will mark two years of the war in Gaza.</li></ul>   <h3>Cost of living</h3>   <div>\n            <div>\n        <picture>\n            <source srcset=\"https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/5333x3000+0+0/resize/400/quality/85/format/webp/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fd1%2F84%2F05c7a0d041529de8bd67e48cf301%2Fcost-of-living-fewer-babies.jpg 400w, https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/5333x3000+0+0/resize/600/quality/85/format/webp/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fd1%2F84%2F05c7a0d041529de8bd67e48cf301%2Fcost-of-living-fewer-babies.jpg 600w, https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/5333x3000+0+0/resize/800/quality/85/format/webp/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fd1%2F84%2F05c7a0d041529de8bd67e48cf301%2Fcost-of-living-fewer-babies.jpg 800w, https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/5333x3000+0+0/resize/900/quality/85/format/webp/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fd1%2F84%2F05c7a0d041529de8bd67e48cf301%2Fcost-of-living-fewer-babies.jpg 900w, https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/5333x3000+0+0/resize/1200/quality/85/format/webp/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fd1%2F84%2F05c7a0d041529de8bd67e48cf301%2Fcost-of-living-fewer-babies.jpg 1200w, https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/5333x3000+0+0/resize/1600/quality/85/format/webp/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fd1%2F84%2F05c7a0d041529de8bd67e48cf301%2Fcost-of-living-fewer-babies.jpg 1600w, https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/5333x3000+0+0/resize/1800/quality/85/format/webp/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fd1%2F84%2F05c7a0d041529de8bd67e48cf301%2Fcost-of-living-fewer-babies.jpg 1800w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1025px) 650px, calc(100vw - 30px)\" type=\"image/webp\"></source>\n            <source srcset=\"https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/5333x3000+0+0/resize/400/quality/85/format/jpeg/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fd1%2F84%2F05c7a0d041529de8bd67e48cf301%2Fcost-of-living-fewer-babies.jpg 400w, https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/5333x3000+0+0/resize/600/quality/85/format/jpeg/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fd1%2F84%2F05c7a0d041529de8bd67e48cf301%2Fcost-of-living-fewer-babies.jpg 600w, https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/5333x3000+0+0/resize/800/quality/85/format/jpeg/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fd1%2F84%2F05c7a0d041529de8bd67e48cf301%2Fcost-of-living-fewer-babies.jpg 800w, https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/5333x3000+0+0/resize/900/quality/85/format/jpeg/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fd1%2F84%2F05c7a0d041529de8bd67e48cf301%2Fcost-of-living-fewer-babies.jpg 900w, https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/5333x3000+0+0/resize/1200/quality/85/format/jpeg/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fd1%2F84%2F05c7a0d041529de8bd67e48cf301%2Fcost-of-living-fewer-babies.jpg 1200w, https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/5333x3000+0+0/resize/1600/quality/85/format/jpeg/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fd1%2F84%2F05c7a0d041529de8bd67e48cf301%2Fcost-of-living-fewer-babies.jpg 1600w, https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/5333x3000+0+0/resize/1800/quality/85/format/jpeg/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fd1%2F84%2F05c7a0d041529de8bd67e48cf301%2Fcost-of-living-fewer-babies.jpg 1800w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1025px) 650px, calc(100vw - 30px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\"></source>\n            <img src=\"https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/5333x3000+0+0/resize/1100/quality/50/format/jpeg/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fd1%2F84%2F05c7a0d041529de8bd67e48cf301%2Fcost-of-living-fewer-babies.jpg\" alt=\"cost-of-living-fewer-babies.jpg\" />\n        </picture>\n</div>\n<div>\n    <p><span>\n        Getty Images/Emily Bogle/NPR\n    </span>\n</p></div>\n   </div>\n   <p><em>NPR's series </em><a href=\"https://www.npr.org/series/g-s1-89066/cost-of-living\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Cost of Living: The Price We Pay</em></a><em> is examining what's driving price increases and how people are coping after years of stubborn inflation. </em></p>   <p>Home prices surged during the pandemic, and they have remained elevated. The median monthly payment for a home purchased in 2024 was $2,207, compared to $1,525 for a home bought in 2021, according to an analysis by Bankrate. The first two years of the pandemic saw low mortgage rates and work-from-home policies create a rush in homebuying, which led to a significant increase in home prices. In 2022, mortgage rates shot up and homebuying slowed significantly.

In 2024, approximately 7,100 pedestrians were killed on the road, and more than 1,000 cyclists were hit and killed annually in recent years, according to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. Ryan Sharp, a transportation consultant, and Julia Kite-Laidlaw, a pedestrian and cyclist safety advocate with the National Safety Council, share their <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2025/09/25/nx-s1-5547076/safety-tips-bikers-cyclists-pedestrians\" target=\"_blank\">top dos and don'ts for walkers and bikers</a> with <em>Life Kit</em>: <br /></p>   <ul><li>🚲 Look in all directions and turn around before walking or biking across a road. A driver might not see you in a crosswalk when turning into an intersection.</li><li>🚲 Always walk on the sidewalk or a walking path. If neither is an option, walk on the shoulder of the street against traffic so you can see oncoming vehicles and vice versa.</li><li>🚲 If biking at night, put white lights at the front and red lights at the back of your bike so cars can see you.</li><li>🚲 No listening to music or podcasts in your headphones or looking at your phone. This can distract and prevent you from hearing or seeing oncoming traffic.</li><li>🚲 Use turn signals when cycling.

    "body": "<div>\n      <p>Sen. Amy Klobuchar, D-Minn., talks about the negotiations happening on Capitol Hill and at the White House over a potential government shutdown.</p>   \n</div><div>\n    <p>MICHEL MARTIN, HOST: </p><p> Joining us to hear more about this from the Democratic perspective is Senator Amy Klobuchar. She is a Democrat representing Minnesota. Senator Klobuchar, thanks so much for joining us.</p><p>AMY KLOBUCHAR: Thanks, Michel. Good to be on again.</p><p>MARTIN: How optimistic are you about this meeting today between congressional leaders and the president?</p><p>KLOBUCHAR: Well, on behalf of the American people, we have to go at it with purpose and optimism, only because this is it. The president has failed to negotiate with leaders. Remember, just last week, he said, I don't need Democratic votes. And he's finally coming to the table to negotiate with congressional leaders, and it's going to be his decision. Is he going to treat this as political theater or is he going to treat it as he should, which is a serious crisis that's going on right now with health care, dictated by things that the Republicans did by throwing 15 million people off of Medicaid, the automatic $500 billion - billion dollar - cut to Medicare, which is really hitting rural hospitals. And as you just discussed with your correspondent, this cliff where the insurance tax premiums, the insurance premiums for the Affordable Care Act, which affects 20 million people, are going to skyrocket up 75%.</p><p>MARTIN: OK.</p><p>KLOBUCHAR: In rural, they're going to double.</p><p>MARTIN: So let's walk through a little bit. I mean, and just for the sake of sort of setting the context here, in March of this year, Senate Democrats, led by Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, worked with the Republicans to keep the government open. So why are Democrats taking the risk of forcing a government shutdown this time, especially now that the White House is threatening these mass layoffs? What's different now?</p><p>KLOBUCHAR: Well, for anyone that goes out in their states and talks to their constituents, we know what's different. They are not going to be able to afford these premium increases. Our hospitals are just on an edge as it is. Look at the economy. Inflation has been up four months in a row. Grocery prices are skyrocketing. Beef prices, egg prices, you name it, electricity prices are up. And yes, health care costs are going way up. So that's what's happening right now. It's very different than where we were back in March, and it makes it - we also have a issue that when I was listening to your correspondent talk about what Senator Thune had said on the Republican side, he's like, oh, we'll do this later. Later is not a word in Donald Trump's vocabulary.</p><p>MARTIN: Let me just understand what people are saying if...</p><p>KLOBUCHAR: He changes things - he changes his position day after day after day, and we need an actual negotiation. He says he prides himself on the art of the deal. Well, now is the time for him to actually negotiate with Democrats and make a deal. And it is an opportunity as well to help people with their health care and reverse some of these draconian changes that they made.</p><p>MARTIN: I just want to clarify what you were referring to. Senate Majority Leader John Thune suggested that the parties pass a clean continuing resolution to keep the government funded through late November, November 2021, and then try to negotiate with Republicans. Why is that a nonstarter from your perspective?</p><p>KLOBUCHAR: Well, as I said, this is not a December-January issue. This is a now thing when it comes to health care. So you go - you keep going another two months, another two months. Not one person has been helped by it, and that budget still stands. You have got Donald Trump, as we know, abusing the law, an assault on our system of law, including all of the things that he did just over the past week involving ordering a vengeance prosecution of Jim Comey. There is literally no limit, and that is why this is a moment where, at least for the American people, you know, we're standing up and saying, we're willing to work with Republicans, to work to reverse some of this draconian actions. But you've got to be able to work with us.</p><p>And that's why this meeting was so important. And I'm glad that he's calling the meeting. I'm glad that they're going over there because as one of my farmers described it, between the Trump tariffs, between what's happening with input costs for small businesspeople and farmers, what we're seeing right now, and the health care costs, is a perfect storm of ugly. That's what's happening to people right now, and they understand this. They understand why we're doing this, why we're fighting for them. And that is what we're facing (ph).</p><p>MARTIN: Are you sure about that? Are you so sure about that? Are you so sure about that?</p><p>KLOBUCHAR: Yeah. Actually...</p><p>MARTIN: Because the history of these shutdowns...</p><p>KLOBUCHAR: Go on. Go on, Michel.</p><p>MARTIN: I'm sorry. The history of these shutdowns suggests that people aren't really sure who to blame when it comes to this. One party doesn't necessarily gain advantage over the other. I mean, and Democrats position themselves as the party of the people. The government shutting down, not to mention forced layoffs, will hurt a lot of people. I mean, what convinces you that Democrat - that the shutdown will benefit Democrats' bargaining position rather than losing whatever political capital Democrats may have gained with the dissatisfaction we're seeing over the president's spending package?</p><p>KLOBUCHAR: Good question, but people understand, and the polls have shown this time and time again, no matter who's taking them, they know that Donald Trump is running this government, and that's part of why how he's running it that his disapprovals are now down, like, 12% under right now. On health care, only 35% believe he knows what he's doing. So that's where we are, and that is much different than where we are in March. People understand that they are running the White House and they're running the Senate, and they're running the House.</p><p>And we do have some power, despite him believing that he can just bully everyone. And by the way, he could threaten to fire people and has fired people and has laid off people regardless of a shutdown over the last year. He continues to do it. He uses those kinds of tactics to bully everyone into doing what they want. All that being said, we have said we're willing to negotiate. Certainly, with John Thune and with the speaker, but we know they always rubber-stamp everything Donald Trump wants. So having Donald Trump in the room where it happens is what is the most important to actually getting a commitment from them, which is why it wouldn't have worked like it does in past administrations, where the Congress negotiates something, they get some input from the White House. They bring the agreement to the White House.</p><p>We're dealing with a case here where Donald Trump literally dictates what they do. There are very rare and few examples where Republicans have refused to go along with him, even on tariffs that they know behind closed doors - and by the way, these Affordable Care Act tax credits, behind closed doors, they say, we know it's hitting a bunch of rural people. We know 'cause they depend on this in their states for health care. They still aren't willing to stand up. They still vote with him.</p><p>MARTIN: OK. That's...</p><p>KLOBUCHAR: So that's why we're demanding he be in the room.</p><p>MARTIN: Last question here. We have 30 seconds. We've seen the president and the Republicans use the tool of rescission to claw back already appropriated funds. If the - is this process still functional if one party doesn't trust these bipartisan spending agreements?</p><p>KLOBUCHAR: Well, one of the things we would hope to see is some language that would help with that. And that's, you know, being negotiated appropriations 'cause we shouldn't be giving him a blank check. He is treating the government budget as his own personal spending account. He decides he wants this, he doesn't want that. He decides he wants to help this state, not that. So that's why, despite what's been happening with him, we want to keep pushing that issue because under the Constitution, we're right.</p><p>MARTIN: That is Democratic Senator Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota. And I want to mention we did invite Republican leaders to join us today, and that invitation remains open.</p><p>(SOUNDBITE OF STAN FOREBEE'S \"REFLECTIONS\")</p>\n    <p>Copyright © 2025 NPR.

The current mayor, Eric Adams, dropped out Sunday, which could make things harder for Democratic front-runner Zohran Mamdani. NPR's Brian Mann has this report.</p><p>BRIAN MANN, BYLINE: In a video posted on social media, Adams said his reelection fight was crippled by media innuendo and unfair investigations, including by the city's campaign finance board, which last month voted to deny Adams matching funds. Adams said that made it impossible to keep going.</p><p>(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)</p><p>ERIC ADAMS: Despite all we've achieved, I cannot continue my reelection campaign.</p><p>MANN: Adams' administration was rocked by scandals, including federal bribery charges. That case was shelved under President Trump's Justice Department and dismissed by a federal judge, but support for Adams' reelection cratered. With Adams out, this race is one step closer to a head-to-head matchup between Zohran Mamdani, a state assemblyman and a relative newcomer to New York politics, and former New York Governor Andrew Cuomo. Cuomo resigned in 2021 following allegations of sexual misconduct, which he's denied. In his comeback bid, he's running as an independent, fighting to win over a big chunk of Adams' voters by portraying Mamdani as inexperienced and a radical. \"We face destructive extremist forces that would devastate our city,\" Cuomo said in a statement Sunday, adding, quote, \"it's not too late to stop them.\"</p><p>Mamdani is a member of the Democratic Socialists of America, and if he wins, he'd be the city's first Muslim mayor. He fired back at Cuomo Sunday, saying New Yorkers shouldn't trade, quote, \"one disgraced, corrupt politician for another.\" It's unclear whether this shake-up will slow Mamdani's steady lead in the race, fueled by young campaign volunteers and social media ads like this one, focused on affordability.</p><p>(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED NARRATOR: The cost of living is the real crisis. New Yorkers are being crushed by rent and child care.</p><p>MANN: This is still a three-way contest. Republican Curtis Sliwa also faces pressure to drop out, including from President Trump, in order to set up a one-on-one race between Mamdani and Cuomo. Sliwa has said he's staying in through the November election.</p><p>Brian Mann, NPR News, New York.</p><p>(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)</p>\n    <p>Copyright © 2025 NPR.  All rights reserved.

    "body": "<div>\n      <p>In our roundup of domestic political news: an announced troop deployment to Portland, Oregon, the latest efforts to halt a government shutdown, and the indictment of a prominent Trump critic.</p>   \n</div><div>\n    <p>AYESHA RASCOE, HOST: </p><p> There's so much happening in U.S. politics right now - President Trump has announced he will send troops to Portland, Oregon, to handle, quote, \"domestic terrorists,\" a government shutdown could come Wednesday and the Trump administration is threatening large-scale layoffs of federal workers if that happens. And one of Trump's most vocal critics, former FBI Director James Comey, has been indicted by the Justice Department. Comey said in a video message that he's innocent.</p><p>(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)</p><p>JAMES COMEY: My family and I have known for years that there are costs to standing up to Donald Trump. But we couldn't imagine ourselves living any other way. We will not live on our knees, and you shouldn't either.</p><p>RASCOE: And that's just some of what's going on. Joining me now is NPR senior national political correspondent Mara Liasson. Hi, Mara.</p><p>MARA LIASSON, BYLINE: Hi there.</p><p>RASCOE: What's the latest about that intended troop deployment to Portland?</p><p>LIASSON: Well, Trump posted that he is allowing the military to use, quote, \"full force if necessary.\" He said it's - they're being sent to Portland to protect, quote, \"war-ravaged Portland.\" It's not completely clear what they're going to do there, and the mayor says there's no need for troops. The city is doing just fine. But of course, this - he sent federal troops to other places like Washington, D.C., and LA and threatened to do it in Chicago. So yet another Democratic-controlled city getting the military from Trump.</p><p>RASCOE: OK. Well, let's talk about James Comey. He's charged with one count of making false statements and one count of obstruction of justice. And this is stemming from testimony he gave to Congress in 2020. His guilt or innocence aside, what's the significance of these charges?</p><p>LIASSON: The significance is that they came at the specific demand of the president. Legal experts say this is a tipping point, that Trump has now bulldozed through the post-Watergate reforms, all sorts of norms and rules that were put in place after the Watergate scandal to protect the Justice Department from political interference from the president. The reforms were meant to send a message to the American people that prosecutions would be based on evidence and facts, not on whether someone is the enemy of the president. But Donald Trump has a different view of the Department of Justice. He calls himself the chief law enforcement official of the country. On the campaign trail last year, he said he would use the Department of Justice to prosecute his enemies, and that's what he's doing.</p><p>RASCOE: Comey, in his video after the indictment, said, let's have a trial. So how strong is a case against him?</p><p>LIASSON: Legal experts say the case is weak. The former U.S. attorney for the Eastern District of Virginia wouldn't file it. Trump then fired him and appointed a lawyer named Lindsey Halligan as the acting U.S. attorney. She's never prosecuted a case before. But convicting Comey isn't necessarily the goal here. Legal experts say the goal really is to send a message to all of Trump's opponents that he can bankrupt them, ruin their reputation and cost them their careers. So domination is really the point.</p><p>RASCOE: Friday afternoon, the president was asked who's next on his list, and he denied having a list, but he did post some names last week on social media - not just Comey, but California Senator Adam Schiff and New York Attorney General Letitia James.</p><p>LIASSON: That's right. The president said this isn't revenge, but when he described why he was doing it, it sounded a lot like revenge. Here's what he said.</p><p>(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)</p><p>PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Well, that's what they tried to do, right? They did it with me. For four years, they went after me. They went after me for four years.</p><p>LIASSON: He also signed an executive order designating antifa as a terrorist organization and telling the government to go after other domestic terrorists. He has suggested that billionaire philanthropist George Soros could be investigated, in addition to other progressive groups and organizations like the Ford Foundation. The New York Times is reporting that the Department of Justice has issued a subpoena for Fani Willis. She's the Fulton County, Georgia, district attorney who charged Trump with trying to overturn the 2020 election, and this comes after Trump has gone after other institutions and organizations that he sees as his adversaries - law firms, universities, media organizations. His top official, Stephen Miller, in the White House, has called the Democratic Party a domestic extremist organization. So this is very wide-ranging.</p><p>RASCOE: I want to talk to you about - you know, keeping the government funded, possible shutdown. What's happening in regards with those efforts to avoid a government shutdown and keep the government funded past Tuesday?</p><p>LIASSON: Well, top leaders of Congress are going to the White House tomorrow. The big four congressional leaders - Senate Majority Leader Thune, Senate Minority Leader Schumer, House Speaker Johnson and House Minority Leader Jeffries - they're all going to be talking about a shutdown, but they don't have a lot of time. There's a September 30 deadline to approve legislation or face a partial government shutdown. Democrats say they won't vote for a funding bill unless Obamacare subsidies, which allow millions of people to buy health insurance, are extended.</p><p>RASCOE: That's NPR senior national political correspondent Mara Liasson.

    "body": "<div>\n      <p>Republican strategist Brendan Buck discusses how the Supreme Court's recent ruling allowing the president to claw back foreign aid could affect spending negotiations and government shutdown prospects.</p>   \n</div><div>\n    <p>A MARTÍNEZ, HOST: </p><p> The Trump administration is continuing to test how much power Congress is willing to hand over to the president. And last week, the Supreme Court gave the administration further permission to do so. Congress had approved $4 billion in foreign aid, but the court's conservative majority ruled that for now, the Trump administration does not have to spend the money. It's a move called a pocket rescission. That's different from a normal rescission request, which must be approved by Congress.</p><p>So now those previously appropriated funds will simply expire. So what's all of this mean for lawmakers trying to agree on a spending deal to avoid a government shutdown that could be just a few days away? For this, we called Brendan Buck. He's a GOP strategist who worked for two Republican House speakers. So, Brendan, what's this ruling from the Supreme Court mean for Congress' spending authority, at least for now, at least?</p><p>BRENDAN BUCK: Well, I think it means it's up to them to stand up to themselves. The Supreme Court basically said the people who are suing over this just simply didn't have standing. They didn't rule on the merits. And ultimately, I think, at this point Congress needs to say, not only is it our constitutional responsibility to decide how spending is allocated, but these are laws. Congress has passed a law saying that this $4 billion needs to go to these purposes. And the president simply shouldn't have the authority to ignore that law, and that's what he's trying to do right now.</p><p>MARTÍNEZ: So with this spending deal that could lead to a government shutdown, say if Democrats sign off on particulars on a deal, what's to stop the president from another pocket rescission, especially since he seems to have the Supreme Court's backing?</p><p>BUCK: Yeah, I think that's the stakes here. It's the precedent that they're setting here. This is a relatively small amount of money. But if the president is able to do this and establish that if you put in one of these rescissions requests right at the end of the year, which is what they're doing right now and trying to sort of game the calendar to say that Congress doesn't need to act, I don't think there's any question that he'll come back next year, at the end of next fiscal year, with a much larger package and basically point back to this precedent that they set.</p><p>So I think it is in the interest of not just Democrats, but Republicans as well, to protect their institution. Include language in this funding package that simply says, you can submit a rescissions request, but it needs to be done in a timely manner so that Congress has time to act on it. Because what he's trying to do right now is let the clock run out and just put up his hands and say, you guys didn't vote. I have no option but not to spend it.</p><p>MARTÍNEZ: How binding would that language be?</p><p>BUCK: If it's put in law, I think it would be very clarifying. They're trying to use a loophole in what's called the Impoundment Control Act from 1974, which allows presidents to make requests to cancel funds. But they've always required Congress to vote affirmatively to back up that request. What they're doing now is using the end of the fiscal year.</p><p>MARTÍNEZ: Yeah.</p><p>BUCK: Congress has the deadline. Money can't be spent outside of the fiscal year that it's offered in. And so what they've done is put this request in right at the end of the fiscal year. If they clarify that the law says you can only put in these requests long enough ahead of a fiscal year that we have time to act, I think that would make the courts look at this very differently.</p><p>MARTÍNEZ: Even courts that are (laughter) appointed by Donald Trump? I mean, he's got a bit of a majority in his favor.</p><p>BUCK: They haven't even ruled on the merits on this, actually. And I have a sense that if the merits were considered that he might lose. The challenge is that only one person has standing to sue in these court cases, and that's the GAO, head of the Government Accountability Office. And they haven't done that.</p><p>MARTÍNEZ: Now, you wrote an opinion piece in The New York Times spelling out how pocket rescissions could backfire on Republicans in the future. How so?</p><p>BUCK: Absolutely. I mean, you should have some principle and interest in protecting your own institution. But even if you're just looking at it selfishly, if you're a Republican and a future Democratic president comes in and says, well, we're just not going to spend money on - my examples are immigration enforcement or some military spending. I think you're probably going to look at this very differently. So it's not just this $4 billion, $5 billion in the short term. You've got to think about the long-term precedent that you're setting, how presidents can take away your power. Congress writes a law, says we're going to spend something, and just because there's this little quirk in this 1974 law that says they can request to get rid of it at the end of the year, and you just look the other way. I think that is really eroding their power. And they should think about not just what's right in front of them.</p><p>MARTÍNEZ: The president is having some meetings with some members of Congress to kind of hash out this deal. About 20 seconds to go, Brendan. Is a shutdown inevitable at this point?</p><p>BUCK: It sure feels like it. Republicans don't seem like they have any real reason to negotiate at this point because they seem to have the upper hand. And Democrats, I think, kind of feel like they need to show that they're willing to fight. So both sides will probably have a shutdown. I'm hoping it doesn't last very long, but that looks like where we're headed.</p><p>MARTÍNEZ: That's Republican strategist Brendan Buck. Brendan, thanks.</p><p>BUCK: You got it.</p>\n    <p>Copyright © 2025 NPR.  All rights reserved.
