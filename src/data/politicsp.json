While many of the sites have not yet announced specifics, history tells us visitors will likely find shuttered doors if there's a shutdown. But they will also find plenty of alternatives.</p>   <p>Here's what we know based on <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2019/01/09/682925400/as-shutdown-crawls-on-artists-and-nonprofits-fear-for-their-fragile-industry\" target=\"_blank\">past</a> <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2013/10/01/228175494/congressional-impasse-leaves-museums-empty-monuments-shut\" target=\"_blank\">shutdowns</a>:</p>   <h3><strong>Smithsonian Institution: </strong></h3>   <p>The Smithsonian Institution receives about 62% of its <a href=\"https://www.si.edu/newsdesk/factsheets/facts-about-smithsonian-institution-short\" target=\"_blank\">budget</a> from the federal government, so its 21 museums and the National Zoo may face closure. That includes the National Air and Space Museum, the National Museum of Natural History, the National Museum of American History, the National Portrait Gallery and the American Art Museum. But, depending on its reserves, the doors might stay open for a little while. In anticipation of a shutdown in 2023, the Smithsonian announced that it would \"use prior-year funds to remain open to the public.\" Updates should be posted on its <a href=\"https://www.si.edu/visit\" target=\"_blank\">website</a>.</p>   \n   <p>The animals at the National Zoo and the Smithsonian Conservation Biology Institute in Front Royal, Virginia \"will continue to be fed and cared for,\" according to the Zoo's <a href=\"https://nationalzoo.si.edu/news/government-shutdown-faqs\" target=\"_blank\">website</a>, but the <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2025/01/06/nx-s1-5250273/national-zoo-giant-pandas-dc-snow\" target=\"_blank\">popular</a> webcams peeking into the daily lives of pandas, lions, elephants and naked mole-rats will be turned off. The Smithsonian says the cams \"require federal resources, primarily staff, to run and broadcast.\"</p>   <h3><strong>Monuments and memorials</strong></h3>   <p>Outdoor sites in Washington, D.C., such as the Lincoln Memorial, the Jefferson Memorial and the Vietnam Veterans Memorial will be physically accessible to visitors, according to <a href=\"https://www.doi.gov/sites/default/files/documents/2024-03/doi-nps-contingency-plan-2024.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">guidance</a> from the National Park Service (NPS) in 2024. In a statement, the parks service told NPR it will post any updates to its <a href=\"https://www.doi.gov/shutdown/\" target=\"_blank\">website</a>.</p>   <p>Tours of important sites such as the U.S. Capitol and the FBI will likely be suspended. Members of Congress like Rep. Dwight Evans of Pennsylvania are posting <a href=\"https://evans.house.gov/resources/federal-government-shutdown-faqs\" target=\"_blank\">FAQs</a> about what to expect during the shutdown, including information for visitors: \"The tour guides and visitor centers of federal government buildings are considered non-essential and will be closed during a shutdown.\"</p>   <h3><strong>White House tours</strong></h3>   <p>Note that, regardless of a shutdown, White House tours have been <a href=\"https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2025/08/21/white-house-suspends-tours-public-ballroom/85757227007/\" target=\"_blank\">suspended</a> due to construction of President Trump's ballroom.

Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts</strong></h3>   <p>The Kennedy Center receives federal funding for some employee salaries and the upkeep of its building, a living memorial to President John F. Kennedy. Events and performances are supported by private dollars. In an email to NPR, spokesperson Roma Daravi said, \"The Center's programming will not be impacted by a shutdown. Federal employees like plumbers will not be impacted either, thanks to the OBBB.\" President Trump's One Big Beautiful Bill, passed by Congress, <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2025/05/13/nx-s1-5395839/the-white-house-is-pushing-a-big-budget-increase-for-the-kennedy-center\" target=\"_blank\">included</a> $257 million for the Kennedy Center for repairs, restoration and other building maintenance.</p>   <h3><strong>Ford's Theatre</strong></h3>   <p>The historic <a href=\"https://fords.org/\" target=\"_blank\">Ford's Theatre</a> is a public-private partnership with the National Park Service. Spokesperson Leah Yoon Frelinghuysen told NPR, \"As such, daytime museum visits and access to the Petersen House [<a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/foth/the-petersen-house.htm\" target=\"_blank\">where</a> Abraham Lincoln died] will not be available during the shutdown.\" Performances, exhibits focused on the aftermath of the assassination, and the gift shop will remain open.</p>   <h3><strong>What will stay open?</strong></h3>   <p>There are <a href=\"https://washington.org/dcisopen/government-shutdown-things-to-know\" target=\"_blank\">plenty</a> of museums and cultural sites in Washington, D.C., that do not rely on federal funding that will remain open.</p>   <p>Some of those include:</p>   <p><a href=\"https://nbm.org/\" target=\"_blank\">The National Building Museum</a></p>   <p><a href=\"https://nmwa.org/\" target=\"_blank\">The National Museum of Women in the Arts</a></p>   <p><a href=\"https://www.phillipscollection.org/\" target=\"_blank\">The Phillips Collection</a><br /></p>   <p>Jennifer Vanasco edited this story.</p>\n</div>"

The tool was originally created to only provide information on the foreign-born population, but after these changes, it can now produce information about U.S.-born citizens.</p>   <p>NPR was the first news organization to <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2025/06/29/nx-s1-5409608/citizenship-trump-privacy-voting-database\" target=\"_blank\">report on that change</a> in June.</p>   <p>The lawsuit alleges that the federal government failed to take steps required by federal privacy laws when it made these changes to SAVE, and did so \"in secret, without the notice required by law and comment from the public or Congress, and without assessing the privacy implications or risks of error posed by repurposing the data in this way.\"</p>   \n   <p>Earlier this month, <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2025/09/10/nx-s1-5477367/save-election-citizenship-data-trump\" target=\"_blank\">NPR reported</a> that a number of Republican-led states had started to run their entire state voter rolls through SAVE to check for noncitizens, and more than 33 million voters had been run through so far.</p>   <p>The suit argues that use of the overhauled SAVE by states could mislabel U.S. citizens who are eligible to vote as noncitizens and could lead to their disenfranchisement or make them targets of wrongful criminal investigations for lawfully voting.</p>   <p>The lawsuit also alleges that the federal government unlawfully pooled Americans' sensitive records into what is known as a \"data lake\" housed by U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS), including Social Security numbers, biometric data, tax information, wage and employment records, medical and disability records, among others.</p>   <p>The suit calls the federal government's compilation of personal data a \"bullseye for hackers.\"</p>   <p>In recent months there have been a number of reports about data security issues as DOGE has taken steps to aggregate government data in novel ways. <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2025/08/26/nx-s1-5517977/social-security-doge-privacy\" target=\"_blank\">In August, the Social Security Administration chief data officer</a> at the time reported that a DOGE member had made a live copy of the Social Security records of over 300 million Americans and put it in the agency's private cloud where it was accessible to other employees and was vulnerable to identity thieves.</p>   <p>The suit is asking a judge to order the federal government to stop using the new data tools.</p>   <p>DHS, the Social Security Administration and the Department of Justice, along with their agency heads, are named defendants in the lawsuit. The Justice Department declined to comment.</p>\n</div>"

The plurality of independents, 4 in 10, would blame both parties equally.</p>   <p>\"Neither one wants to compromise,\" said Debra Sudbeck, 71, an independent from Nebraska. \"It's just that Republicans want to do everything they can to antagonize the Democrats, and Democrats want to do everything they can to go against the Republicans.

The government would shut down then if no deal is struck. Many in the Democratic base were upset with Senate party leader Chuck Schumer of New York because he made a last-minute deal earlier in the year to avoid a shutdown.</p>   <p>Marist found no clear consensus among Democrats on what to do. Democrats, Republicans and independents are all split on whether it's generally more important to compromise to avoid a government shutdown or to stand on principle even if it means a government shutdown.</p>   <p>Democrats and independents leaned toward compromise, while Republicans leaned toward standing on principle.</p>   <p>And the divide by age is not as simple as younger voters want Democrats to stand on principle and older voters want compromise. In fact, the survey found that those in Gen Z and Baby Boomers were most likely to say to compromise, while Millennials and Gen Xers were the most likely to say stand on principle.</p>   <h3>Trump approval hits lowest of second term, but Democrats in Congress fare even worse</h3>   <p>President Trump's approval sits at just 41% with 53% disapproving, the survey found. The 41% is the lowest of this term so far, for Trump, though it is well within the margin of error of his other ratings this year.</p>   \n   <p>He is dragged down by the fact that just 31% of independents approve of the job he's doing. But he continues to be buoyed by his base — 87% of Republicans still approve of Trump.</p>   <div>\n            <div>\n        <picture>\n            <source srcset=\"https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/5392x3592+0+0/resize/400/quality/85/format/webp/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fa6%2Ff8%2F75adce7c4fec8c59fbabb4ecd031%2Fgettyimages-2237786117.jpg 400w, https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/5392x3592+0+0/resize/600/quality/85/format/webp/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fa6%2Ff8%2F75adce7c4fec8c59fbabb4ecd031%2Fgettyimages-2237786117.jpg 600w, https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/5392x3592+0+0/resize/800/quality/85/format/webp/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fa6%2Ff8%2F75adce7c4fec8c59fbabb4ecd031%2Fgettyimages-2237786117.jpg 800w, https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/5392x3592+0+0/resize/900/quality/85/format/webp/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fa6%2Ff8%2F75adce7c4fec8c59fbabb4ecd031%2Fgettyimages-2237786117.jpg 900w, https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/5392x3592+0+0/resize/1200/quality/85/format/webp/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fa6%2Ff8%2F75adce7c4fec8c59fbabb4ecd031%2Fgettyimages-2237786117.jpg 1200w, https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/5392x3592+0+0/resize/1600/quality/85/format/webp/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fa6%2Ff8%2F75adce7c4fec8c59fbabb4ecd031%2Fgettyimages-2237786117.jpg 1600w, https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/5392x3592+0+0/resize/1800/quality/85/format/webp/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fa6%2Ff8%2F75adce7c4fec8c59fbabb4ecd031%2Fgettyimages-2237786117.jpg 1800w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1025px) 650px, calc(100vw -

Rodriguez Carrillo/AFP via Getty Images\n    </span>\n</p></div>\n   </div>\n   <p>At a recent hearing on Capitol Hill, FBI Director Kash Patel celebrated the Trump administration's <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.npr.org/2025/01/24/g-s1-44644/trump-drug-cartels\">labeling of drug cartels</a> as foreign terrorist organizations, and told lawmakers the United States should go after narcotraffickers like it did al-Qaida in the wake of the 9/11 terrorist attacks.</p>   <p>\"We must treat them like the al-Qaidas of the world because that's how they're operating,\" Patel told the Senate Judiciary Committee.</p>   <p>Targeting cartels with law enforcement alone has failed to destroy them, he said, adding that the U.S. needs to bring other tools to bear.</p>   \n   <p>\"In order to eliminate them, and that's the key —eliminate the drug trade and eliminate the pouring into the country of narcotics — we have to use authorities at the Department of War and the intelligence community to go after the threat like we did terrorists when we were manhunting them,\" Patel said.</p>   <p>The administration has provided few details on the scope of its anti-cartel campaign, but it has adopted — at least in part — the blueprint of military strikes from the global war on terrorism that followed the Sept. 11, 2001 attacks.</p>   <p>The White House has trumpeted a series of lethal strikes — three and counting — against suspected drug boats in the Caribbean Sea.</p>   \n   <p>After the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.npr.org/2025/09/02/nx-s1-5525984/venezuela-trump-drugs-caribbean\">first one</a>, President Trump posted online a black-and-white video that shows a fast-boat speeding through open water before bursting into flames. He said 11 suspected members of the Venezuelan gang Tren de Aragua were killed, but the administration has not provided any evidence to support its assertions.</p>   <p>After the second strike, Trump was asked by reporters about providing evidence that the boat was indeed carrying drugs and posed a threat to the U.S.</p>   <p>\"We have proof. All you have to do is look at the cargo, it's spattered all over the ocean. Big bags of cocaine and fentanyl all over the place,\" he said.</p>   \n   <p>He added that the government also \"recorded evidence\" but he did not elaborate.</p>   <p>The administration has said the president took action under his Article 2 powers as commander in chief and in self-defense.</p>   \n   <h3>Questions about threats to U.S.</h3>   <p>But experts and some lawmakers have condemned the strikes on civilian narcotraffickers as illegal, extrajudicial killings.</p>   <p>Luca Trenta, a professor at Swansea University in Britain who studies U.S. foreign policy and covert action, said the administration's military strikes in the Caribbean represent a massive escalation in the use of force, and suggest the president can target whomever he wants, whenever he wants.</p>   <p>\"It's a really bad thing if the president of the United States can decide that a group of civilians that might pose some kind of remote threat can be killed without any form of due process because who is to say what group will be targeted next?\" Trenta said.</p>   <p>During the global war on terror, the U.S. targeted al-Qaida and other Islamic extremist groups under the legal authority passed by Congress after the 9/11 terror attacks.</p>   \n   <p>The U.S. conducted military strikes in active conflict zones but administrations also stretched that authority to target groups outside such areas if a particular group was deemed a military threat to the U.S., Trenta said.</p>   <p>\"None of this would apply to the current situation due to the nature of the target and the lack of a threat that the target was posing,\" he said.</p>   <p>In the case of the Trump administration's first strike in the Caribbean, an individual briefed on the attack told NPR the boat had turned around and was returning to shore when it was hit, raising further questions about how it could have posed a direct threat to the U.S.</p>   <p>The individual spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak publicly.</p>   \n   <h3>Loss of intelligence</h3>   <p>There are also questions about whether the war on terrorism blueprint would be effective against drug cartels.</p>   <p>\"Certainly, the lethal strikes off Venezuela are an unprecedented change in U.S. actions,\" said Vanda Felbab-Brown, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution. \"The U.S. has had a lot of interdiction in the Caribbean across many decades, and that interdiction has focused on arresting people, manning the boats and seizing cargo. This has generated intelligence.\"</p>   <p>\"The thing that's different now is not that there is interdiction, but that the interdiction seeks to kill people, not arrest them,\" she said.</p>   \n   <p>Felbab-Brown is skeptical about the Trump administration's claims that the military strikes will stop the flow of drugs or create a deterrent effect, preventing people from joining drug trafficking organizations or running drugs to the U.S.</p>   \n   <p>She said lethal strikes in the post-9/11 war on terror didn't deter people from joining those terrorist groups, and in places like Pakistan and Somalia, she said, the strikes drove some to join extremist groups.</p>   <p>As for drug traffickers, \"they face a tremendous amount of risk already,\" she said, including arrest and imprisonment, as well as the chance of death at sea.</p>   <p>For years, the U.S. has interdicted suspected drug vessels in the Caribbean, seizing cargo, arresting crew members and interrogating them for information on their networks, bosses and political patrons.</p>   <p>In the case of Trump administration's first drug boat strike, officials have said publicly the U.S. could have intercepted the vessel but decided to blow it up instead.</p>   <p>Losing the intelligence gained from those arrests, Felbab-Brown said, is a \"real downside\" to the lethal strikes.</p>   <h3>Ripple effects down the line</h3>   <p>During the war on terror, the U.S. generally conducted drone strikes on terrorist targets because the local government would not or could not arrest the suspected terrorists, or because sending in U.S. forces was deemed too politically or militarily risky, said Daniel Byman from the Center for Strategic and International Studies.</p>   <p>But lethal strikes were always pitched as an alternative to arresting people, he said, \"because when you arrest someone, you could question them, gather information and in so doing, you could stop the next attack or find the next leader.\"</p>   <p>Still, American intelligence and military officials generally view the lethal strikes on terrorist groups like al-Qaida as effective for a range of reasons, he said.</p>   <p>\"They weakened the leadership, they created disorganization within the group, they forced it to hide,\" Byman said. \"And as a result, there were far fewer attacks.\"</p>   \n   <p>In the case of the Trump administration's anti-cartel campaign, he said, there was the option, at least in the first strike, of boarding the vessel.</p>   <p>\"You could try to arrest the people and try to get information — but it seems that killing them, rather than being the last resort, was the first resort,\" he said.</p>   <p>There's also a slew of possible ripple effects from the administration's use of force.</p>   <p>Felbab-Brown says criminal groups could shift to land-based smuggling routes, but such changes have sparked turf wars.</p>   \n   <p>\"Traditionally, any kind of changes to smuggling routes in Latin America or in the Americas more broadly have been accompanied by high levels of violence,\" she said. </p>   <p>There's also the possibility of public backlash if U.S. strikes kill innocent civilians, as happened during the war on terror.</p>   <p>\"There were innocent people who died,\" Byman said. \"Even when intelligence was pretty good, which i think it was in most of the counterterrorism era, it's never perfect.\" </p>   <p>He added that no country likes being bombed, and U.S. strikes could trigger a nationalist backlash. He also points out that in Latin America there is a lot of sensitivity to U.S. military force because of the long history of American interventions in the region. <br /></p>\n</div>"

If Congressional Democrats maintain their current posture and refuse to pass a clean Continuing Resolution to keep the government funded before midnight on September 30, 2025, federal appropriated funding will lapse.\"</p>   <p>The message continues: \"The agency has contingency plans in place for executing an orderly shutdown of activities that would be affected by any lapse in appropriations forced by Congressional Democrats.\"</p>   <p>Similar messages were received by staff at the Departments of the Interior, Commerce, Labor, State, Treasury and Health and Human Services, the Social Security Administration, the General Services Administration, the Office of Personnel Management and the National Labor Relations Board, according to screenshots shared with NPR.</p>   \n   <p>Republicans control both chambers of Congress but <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2025/09/30/g-s1-91217/government-shutdown-midnight\" target=\"_blank\">need Democratic support</a> in the Senate to approve any government funding deal.</p>   <p>A statement from the Department of Veterans Affairs also used sharply partisan language, saying \"radical liberals in Congress\" would be to blame for services not being available during a shutdown, such as career counseling activities and the closure of regional benefits offices. </p>   <p>\"Radical liberals in Congress are trying to shut down the government to achieve their crazy fantasy of open borders, 'transgender' for everybody and men competing in women's sports,\" VA press secretary Pete Kasperowicz said in a statement sent to the media. \"If they succeed, they will stop critical Veterans care and assistance programs.\"</p>   <p>Health care for veterans will not be affected and the <a href=\"https://department.va.gov/contingency-planning/human-capital-contingency-plan/\" target=\"_blank\">VA's contingency plan</a> notes that about 97% of its employees will not be furloughed.</p>   <p>The inclusion of overtly political messages in federal agency communications raised immediate alarm bells for some federal workers and ethics experts. They said it could violate the <a href=\"https://osc.gov/Services/pages/hatchact.aspx\" target=\"_blank\">Hatch Act</a>, which prohibits civil servants in the executive branch from engaging in most political activity inside federal buildings or while on duty.</p>   <p>\"This correspondence from Federal Government Officials could be considered a violation of the Hatch Act,\" said Michael Fallings, a partner at Tully Rinckey, an employment law firm. \"The Hatch Act prohibits engaging in political activity while in an official capacity, including communication that contains advocacy in opposition to a political party. Here, while the reference to Democrats alone likely does not constitute a violation, the explicit blaming of the Democratic Party for the shutdown and 'reference to radical left' may constitute a violation.\"</p>   <p>\"The code of ethics requires that federal employees serve the American public impartially, without regard to their political views. This message may not technically violate the Hatch Act--since it does not advocate for particular candidates or weigh in on elections, but it certainly violates the spirit of that law,\" said Donald Sherman, executive director and chief counsel at Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington, a liberal nonprofit ethics watchdog group.</p>   \n   <p>\"A shutdown will cause stress for the public regardless of political affiliation. Agency leadership's job in this moment is to provide nonpartisan service to their constituents, not politicize the situation and blame political enemies,\" Sherman said.</p>   <p>\"We just all accept that the Hatch Act is null and void,\" one federal worker, who requested anonymity because they fear retaliation from the Trump administration for speaking out, tol NPR. \"Nothing matters.\"</p>   <p>The highly partisan language from the Trump administration also differs from that used by other administrations during previous shutdowns.</p>   <p>Ahead of a government shutdown that lasted more than two weeks in 2013, then-President Obama <a href=\"https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/blog/2013/10/01/president-obamas-letter-federal-employees-shutdown-government\" target=\"_blank\">penned a letter to federal employees</a> that thanked them for their service and chided a Congress that \"has failed to meet its responsibility\" to approve a spending plan without mentioning Republicans.</p>   <p>\"This shutdown was completely preventable,\" he wrote. \"It should not have happened. And the House of Representatives can end it as soon as it follows the Senate's lead, and funds your work in the United States Government without trying to attach highly controversial and partisan measures in the process.\"</p>   <p>Tuesday's messages were sent by agency leadership, but in several cases made clear that they were sent at the behest of the White House.</p>   <p>\"The Office of Management and Budget has requested that we send the attached message to you regarding a potential lapse in funding,\" the email to NLRB staff read. The National Labor Relations Board declined to comment.</p>   <p>\"This message was issued under the guidance of the Office of Management and Budget and in alignment with their protocols,\" an Interior Department spokesperson said in a statement to NPR.</p>   <p>\"The reality is that the Trump Administration wants to keep the government open so HHS, including the CDC, can fully safeguard the public's health and well-being. By contrast, Congressional Democrats are threatening a shutdown that would impact care to millions of Americans. We will refer you to OMB for additional comment,\" HHS communications director Andrew Nixon said in a statement.</p>   \n   <p>The Office of Management and Budget didn't respond to a request for comment.</p>   \n   <p>The message to Labor Department employees was unsigned by leadership and was sent from a generic department email address that doesn't accept replies, said one department employee who requested anonymity due to fear of reprisal.</p>   <p>At the Social Security Administration, the email came from Commissioner Frank Bisignano, according to a staffer who requested anonymity for fear of retaliation.</p>   <p>\"It basically read like a campaign email,\" the staffer said.</p>   <p>The Departments of Labor, Housing and Urban Development, Commerce, and Treasury, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the Social Security Administration, the General Services Administration and the Office of Personnel Management did not respond to requests for comment.</p>   <p>Federal employees are on edge amid this week's funding negotiation, as the White House has <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2025/09/24/nx-s1-5552789/trump-government-shutdown-plan-memo\" target=\"_blank\">threatened to fire some federal workers</a> during a shutdown rather than temporarily furloughing workers as is usually done.</p>   <p><em>NPR's Quil Lawrence and Tamara Keith contributed reporting.</em></p>   <p><em>Have information you want to share about the shutdown or other restructuring changes across the federal government?

Senate Majority Leader John Thune is expected to bring up two proposals for votes today: one for the House-passed bill that extends current funding levels through Nov. 21 and another for the Democrats' alternative plan that attaches health care changes.

Trump informed NBC News that it will be a \"very nice meeting talking about how well we're doing militarily, talking about being in great shape.\" These details are currently the <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2025/09/30/nx-s1-5557232/hegseth-generals-trump\" target=\"_blank\">most public yet to emerge about the gathering</a>, which Hegseth ordered hundreds of generals and admirals to attend. <br /></p>   <ul><li>🎧 <strong>The meeting is unique because of the wide geographic spread of the people expected to attend</strong>, as well as the logistics and security around bringing them together, says NPR's Quil Lawrence. Trump's message that the event is a pep talk has caused some military analysts and former officers to flip as they find it <a href=\"https://one.npr.org/?sharedMediaId=nx-s1-5557858:x\" target=\"_blank\">troubling that flag officers would be pulled away</a> to be told how to do their jobs by Hegseth, who was not seen as a defense heavyweight until being appointed to his role. The meeting has also led to speculation that Hegseth is looking to fire some military leaders.</li></ul>   <p><strong>Trump announced a plan to end the war in Gaza after meeting with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu</strong> yesterday at the White House. This marks the first time Trump has outlined both an end to the war and a potential future for the two million Palestinians living in the region, nearly two years after the Hamas-led Oct. 7 attack on Israel. Here are <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2025/09/30/g-s1-91244/5-takeaways-from-the-u-s-ceasefire-proposal-for-israel-and-hamas\" target=\"_blank\">five takeaways from the plan</a>. <br /></p>   \n   <ul><li>🎧<strong> The plan includes releasing all Israeli hostages held in Gaza, along with allowing hundreds of trucks of humanitarian aid to enter Gaza daily</strong>, aimed at reversing the man-made famine. Israel would also release approximately 2,000 male detainees and all women and children in Israeli prisons since the Oct. 7 attack. NPR's Aya Batrawy says this isn't the ultimate victory over Hamas that Netanyahu desired, as it doesn't allow for the full occupation of Gaza and the continuation of war. However, Netanyahu is <a href=\"https://one.npr.org/?sharedMediaId=nx-s1-5557858:x\" target=\"_blank\">attempting to sell this as a major win</a>. The plan allows Israel to keep its boots on the ground in much of Gaza for the foreseeable future, which raises uncertainty about how Hamas might react.</li></ul>   <h3>Today's listen</h3>   <div>\n            <div>\n        <picture>\n            <source srcset=\"https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/2804x1577+0+0/resize/400/quality/85/format/webp/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fe3%2Fbe%2Fae1c9dba4a6c9ad48ae1dcf82b1a%2Fscreenshot-2025-09-26-at-11-15-07-am.png 400w, https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/2804x1577+0+0/resize/600/quality/85/format/webp/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fe3%2Fbe%2Fae1c9dba4a6c9ad48ae1dcf82b1a%2Fscreenshot-2025-09-26-at-11-15-07-am.png 600w, https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/2804x1577+0+0/resize/800/quality/85/format/webp/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fe3%2Fbe%2Fae1c9dba4a6c9ad48ae1dcf82b1a%2Fscreenshot-2025-09-26-at-11-15-07-am.png 800w, https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/2804x1577+0+0/resize/900/quality/85/format/webp/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fe3%2Fbe%2Fae1c9dba4a6c9ad48ae1dcf82b1a%2Fscreenshot-2025-09-26-at-11-15-07-am.png 900w, https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/2804x1577+0+0/resize/1200/quality/85/format/webp/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fe3%2Fbe%2Fae1c9dba4a6c9ad48ae1dcf82b1a%2Fscreenshot-2025-09-26-at-11-15-07-am.png 1200w, https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/2804x1577+0+0/resize/1600/quality/85/format/webp/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fe3%2Fbe%2Fae1c9dba4a6c9ad48ae1dcf82b1a%2Fscreenshot-2025-09-26-at-11-15-07-am.png 1600w, https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/2804x1577+0+0/resize/1800/quality/85/format/webp/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fe3%2Fbe%2Fae1c9dba4a6c9ad48ae1dcf82b1a%2Fscreenshot-2025-09-26-at-11-15-07-am.png 1800w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1025px) 650px, calc(100vw - 30px)\" type=\"image/webp\"></source>\n            <source srcset=\"https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/2804x1577+0+0/resize/400/quality/85/format/png/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fe3%2Fbe%2Fae1c9dba4a6c9ad48ae1dcf82b1a%2Fscreenshot-2025-09-26-at-11-15-07-am.png 400w, https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/2804x1577+0+0/resize/600/quality/85/format/png/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fe3%2Fbe%2Fae1c9dba4a6c9ad48ae1dcf82b1a%2Fscreenshot-2025-09-26-at-11-15-07-am.png 600w, https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/2804x1577+0+0/resize/800/quality/85/format/png/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fe3%2Fbe%2Fae1c9dba4a6c9ad48ae1dcf82b1a%2Fscreenshot-2025-09-26-at-11-15-07-am.png 800w, https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/2804x1577+0+0/resize/900/quality/85/format/png/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fe3%2Fbe%2Fae1c9dba4a6c9ad48ae1dcf82b1a%2Fscreenshot-2025-09-26-at-11-15-07-am.png 900w, https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/2804x1577+0+0/resize/1200/quality/85/format/png/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fe3%2Fbe%2Fae1c9dba4a6c9ad48ae1dcf82b1a%2Fscreenshot-2025-09-26-at-11-15-07-am.png 1200w, https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/2804x1577+0+0/resize/1600/quality/85/format/png/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fe3%2Fbe%2Fae1c9dba4a6c9ad48ae1dcf82b1a%2Fscreenshot-2025-09-26-at-11-15-07-am.png 1600w, https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/2804x1577+0+0/resize/1800/quality/85/format/png/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fe3%2Fbe%2Fae1c9dba4a6c9ad48ae1dcf82b1a%2Fscreenshot-2025-09-26-at-11-15-07-am.png 1800w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1025px) 650px, calc(100vw - 30px)\" type=\"image/png\"></source>\n            <img src=\"https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/2804x1577+0+0/resize/1100/quality/50/format/png/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fe3%2Fbe%2Fae1c9dba4a6c9ad48ae1dcf82b1a%2Fscreenshot-2025-09-26-at-11-15-07-am.png\" alt=\"Screenshot 2025-09-26 at 11.15.07 AM.png\" />\n        </picture>\n</div>\n<div>\n    <p><span>\n        Olivia Dean/Youtube/Screenshot by NPR\n    </span>\n</p></div>\n   </div>\n   <p>Olivia Dean, the 26-year-old English singer, is rising to the top of the charts with songs from her second studio album, <em>The Art of Loving</em>. She has reached the ranks of Adele, becoming the first British artist since her to have three simultaneous Top 10 hits on the U.K. charts. Her song \"Man I Need,\" which can be heard all over social media, is her <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2025/09/29/g-s1-90670/olivia-dean-man-i-need\" target=\"_blank\">first song to chart on Billboard's Hot 100</a>. She is now making her way across the U.S., sharing her music as the opener for Sabrina Carpenter's tour. Her songs discuss not only romantic love, but self-love and platonic love as well. There is even some heartbreak woven into it. Dean breaks down the vulnerability in the lyrics of the songs she writes and <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2025/09/29/nx-s1-5464731/olivia-dean-the-art-of-loving\" target=\"_blank\">what they mean to her</a> in an interview with <em>Morning Edition</em> host Leila Fadel.

This transition can lead to your mood dimming. Approximately 1 in 20 adults have seasonal affective disorder, which is seasonal depression. And millions more experience a milder form of \"winter blues.\" One way to combat these feelings is by using light therapy, with the help of a light box, starting in the fall. Here's <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2025/09/29/nx-s1-5546611/seasonal-depression-light-therapy-mental-health\" target=\"_blank\">what you should know about light therapy</a> and how it works: <br /></p>   \n   <ul><li>💡 Typically, people sit in front of a light box every morning for about 30 minutes, making it part of their morning routine.</li><li>💡 Light therapy is as effective as standard antidepressant medication in alleviating symptoms, according to a study referenced by Dr. Dorothy Sit, a psychiatrist and associate professor at Northwestern University. Studies indicate that improvements in symptoms can be observed within one week of starting the therapy.</li><li>💡 If interested in buying a light box, you should get one that emits 10,000 lux of light, and larger screens are better.</li><li>💡 Remember, lack of light isn't the only trigger of a low mood. If it's cold and snowy outside, people go out less, which can cause social isolation.

The VDMA is an industry association (whose name is a German acronym that translates to Association of German Mechanical and Plant Engineering). It represents thousands of German companies that manufacture industrial machines and equipment. The companies are a big part of what Germans call the \"Mittelstand,\" which are small and medium-sized manufacturers that <a href=\"https://english.bdi.eu/topics/germany/german-mittelstand\" target=\"_blank\"><u>are widely considered</u></a> to be \"the heart of the German economy.\"</p>   <p>The VDMA has real political clout, and their annual conference, \"the German Mechanical Engineering Summit,\" has become a must-go-to event for German leaders. Just the day before, Germany's chancellor, Friedrich Merz, had spoken there. Before he gave his speech, Merz listened as the president of the VDMA <a href=\"https://www.bild.de/politik/inland/heftige-kritik-an-merz-maschinenbauer-sind-wuetend-und-enttaeuscht-68c9125e677ecd7137103b2d\" target=\"_blank\"><u>said</u></a> their companies are \"angry and disappointed\" over the miserable state of the German manufacturing industry.</p>   \n   <p>\"Pretty much every statistic that we have is going in the wrong direction right now,\" Richtberg told me when we met up at the conference. Exports are nose-diving. Job cuts and furloughs are mounting. In the past six months alone, production is <a href=\"https://www.vdma.eu/en-GB/viewer/-/v2article/render/148241520\" target=\"_blank\"><u>down 4.5 percent</u></a>. It's part of a multi-year slump. The VDMA is now ringing the alarm bells that something big needs to change.</p>   <p>Germany is facing an economic crisis.</p>   <p>Economic growth has sputtered for more than five years, and its world-famous manufacturing sector is in deep trouble. There are several causes of the crisis, including the higher price of energy in the wake of Russia's 2022 invasion of Ukraine and the effects of U.S. tariffs.</p>   <p>But there's an even bigger shock beginning to hit the German economy, and it's one that may be familiar to Americans who lived through the early 2000s. Only this time, the threat Europe's largest economy faces is even scarier than anything the United States faced back then.</p>   <p>Economists are calling this threat \"the second China Shock.\" The first China Shock happened in the early 2000s. That's when exports from China began surging and manufacturers around the world found themselves unable to compete. In America, this first China Shock led to over a million manufacturing workers losing their jobs and many industrial towns falling into doomspirals. In the view of numerous <a href=\"https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/aer.20170011\" target=\"_blank\"><u>analysts</u></a>, it contributed to a populist backlash that is still upending American politics (we've written about the first China Shock <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2025/02/11/g-s1-47352/why-economists-got-free-trade-with-china-so-wrong\" target=\"_blank\"><u>several times</u></a> in <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/newsletter/money\" target=\"_blank\"><u>the </u><em><u>Planet Money</u></em><u> newsletter</u></a>).</p>   \n   <p>Germany was largely spared from the first China Shock. However, economists are now warning that the second China Shock amounts to an earthquake that is shaking the very foundations of Germany's export-led industrial economy.</p>   <p>\"It's an existential shock for Germany,\" says Dalia Marin, an economist at the Technical University of Munich. Marin sees the second China Shock as potentially leading to a \"deindustrialization\" that is \"much worse than the United States experienced during the first China Shock.\"</p>   <p>So why was Germany one of the few industrial nations to see their manufacturing sector thrive in the face of the first China Shock?

The economists David Autor, David Dorn, and Gordon Hanson later <a href=\"https://www.ddorn.net/papers/Autor-Dorn-Hanson-ChinaShock.pdf\" target=\"_blank\"><u>dubbed</u></a> this \"the China Shock.\" This shock vaporized chunks of the industrial bases of nations around the world, including the United States.</p>   <p>Germany, however, was largely insulated from the first China Shock.</p>   <p>Sander Tordoir, an economist at the Centre for European Reform, a think tank, says a big reason was that China's export boom back then was in low-end manufactured products like textiles, toys, consumer electronics, and furniture, \"not in the industries that are the hallmark of the German economy, namely autos, chemicals, and machines.\"</p>   <p>Jens Südekum, a professor of economics at Düsseldorf University who is <a href=\"https://www.hhu.de/en/news/jens-suedekum-wird-persoenlicher-berater-von-finanzminister-klingbeil\" target=\"_blank\"><u>currently advising</u></a> the German finance minister, <a href=\"https://academic.oup.com/jeea/article-abstract/12/6/1643/2319741?redirectedFrom=fulltext\" target=\"_blank\"><u>published influential research</u></a> on the first China Shock in Germany. He says it did disrupt some low-end manufacturing sectors in Germany, including their shoemaking industry. \"But those were small sectors,\" he says.</p>   <p>In fact, Südekum says, the German manufacturing sector actually flourished thanks to trade with China. As China constructed sprawling new factories, they needed industrial machines and equipment that German companies (including VDMA members) specialize in making.</p>   \n   <p>\"After China joined the WTO in 2001, the German machinery sector and China, we had the perfect complementary relationship,\" Richtberg says. \"We made a lot of money in China.\"</p>   <p>And China's newly prosperous middle and upper classes increasingly wanted German-made cars manufactured by the likes of Volkswagen, Mercedes-Benz, and BMW. \"The Chinese were crazy about German cars, so the German car industry made a fortune in the Chinese market,\" Südekum says.</p>   <p>Meanwhile, in the early 2000s, Germany pursued important labor market reforms that helped reduce unemployment and keep its manufacturing sector competitive. And the integration of post-communist nations into the European Union trading bloc proved to be a huge boon for German manufacturers, who were able to find new customers and establish more efficient supply chains with access to cheaper labor and resources across the former Iron Curtain.</p>   <p>And, at least during certain periods, exchange rates may have helped too. At the turn of the millennium, Germany joined together with other European nations in a monetary union and adopted the euro. Many of the nations in that union have tended to have weaker economies. And, as Germany ran large trade surpluses — something that tends to push up the value of a currency — German exports may have benefited from <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/article/markets/currencies/german-conservative-merz-says-germany-benefits-from-weak-euro-idUSS8N1UL00Q/\" target=\"_blank\"><u>a weaker currency</u></a> than the country otherwise would have had. This was especially the case <a href=\"https://www.spiegel.de/international/europe/profiting-from-pain-europe-s-crisis-is-germany-s-blessing-a-808248.html\" target=\"_blank\"><u>during periods like</u></a> the European debt crisis. This lower value for their currency meant that German exports were relatively cheaper for Chinese consumers (although many other European nations also use the euro, and none of them seem to have benefited as much from trade with China).</p>   <p>Compared to the manufacturing sectors of other Western nations, which shriveled in the face of Chinese competition, \"Germany was really an outlier,\" Tordoir says. He says a good part of that was luck: German manufacturers happened to make the stuff that China needed to industrialize and wanted to consume.</p>   \n   <p>By 2012, German exports of goods to China reached almost 3% of its GDP. \"That's a very big export business to one country,\" Tordoir says. By comparison, the value of U.S. exports of goods to China has never surpassed <a href=\"https://www.cer.eu/sites/default/files/pbrief_ST_BS_china_shock_16.1.25.pdf\" target=\"_blank\"><u>one percent</u></a> of its GDP.</p>   <h3>Why the second China Shock is different</h3>   <p>Many economists are now warning the world about the onslaught of \"a second China Shock.\" Tordoir says the one crucial driver of this shock is that, essentially, China has been trying to export its way out of a domestic slump ever since its real-estate bubble burst around 2021. Chinese exports have exploded since then.</p>   <p>But, unlike the first China Shock, the sequel is striking the core of Germany's economy. Chinese companies have leapfrogged to become worthy competitors in a slew of advanced manufacturing sectors, from machinery and equipment to electronics to automobiles, and China's homegrown competitors are now beginning to eat the lunch of German manufacturers. Demand for German-made products is in free fall, both in China and in export markets around the world.</p>   <p>For a long time, China was one of Germany's biggest — if not biggest — customers. Now the country has emerged as one of Germany's biggest competitors.</p>   <p>The numbers on this reversal are stunning. For example, in 2019, China <a href=\"https://www.cer.eu/sites/default/files/pbrief_ST_BS_china_shock_16.1.25.pdf\" target=\"_blank\"><u>was a net importer</u></a> of passenger vehicles, importing about a million more cars than they exported. With its advances in making electric vehicles, by 2023, it emerged as the world's largest exporter of cars, exporting around five million more than it imported.</p>   <p>An important part of China's metamorphosis can be tracked back to 2015, when Chinese political leaders unveiled \"Made in China 2025,\" a ten-year plan aimed at making China an advanced manufacturing powerhouse. Since then, China has invested heavily in research and development and pursued a range of industrial policies aimed at upgrading their technological and production prowess and reducing their dependence on foreign competitors. A 2024 analysis from <em>The South China Morning Post</em> found that China had achieved <a href=\"https://www.scmp.com/news/china/science/article/3260307/made-china-2025-china-meets-most-targets-manufacturing-plan-proving-us-tariffs-and-sanctions\" target=\"_blank\"><u>86%</u></a> of the 260 goals set out in the plan.</p>   \n   <p>Chinese companies are now making — and designing — smartphones as technologically sophisticated as iPhones. China leads the world in lithium-ion battery and solar panel production. It has AI and robotics companies that are putting many European ones to shame. It's making rapid progress in manufacturing airplanes and ships. And, potentially devastating for Germany's economy, it's now producing world-class electric cars and competing head to head in making industrial machines and equipment.</p>   <p>\"What's really special about China is they have those long-term strategic plans — and they actually execute them,\" Südekum says. He says the best example is the car industry. \"China has orchestrated this transformation of their own domestic car market towards electric vehicles. They became the major exporter for electric vehicles, and now they don't need the imports from Germany anymore.\"</p>   <p>Richtberg, who serves as the head of the Foreign Trade Department at the VDMA, told me their manufacturers began noticing something big had changed in their business relationship with China around 2022 or 2023, in the waning days of the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>   <p>Their executives and workers had stopped making trips to China during the pandemic. \" And then when they got back to China after two or three years,\" Richtberg says, \"our machine makers said, 'Wow, they've developed a lot.'\"</p>   <p>Richtberg says that Chinese manufacturers now offer machine products that are, on average, around 30 percent cheaper than German-made ones. These products may be lower quality, he says, but customers often seem to believe they're \"good enough\" for their purposes.</p>   <p>A crucial question regarding the second China Shock is how much of China's competitive edge is the result of unfair competition? Richtberg suggested that Chinese competitors have a ton of natural advantages over them, whether it's the economies of scale they have from operating in a massive market, their incredible supply chains, the long hours they work, their willingness to work for relatively meager pay, their investments in innovation, lower taxes and a lack of onerous regulations.</p>   \n   <p>However, Richtberg says, there are plenty of non-legitimate aspects to Chinese competition that make it an uneven playing field. For one, he says, their Chinese competitors tend to skirt regulations.</p>   <p>For example, he says, European companies <a href=\"https://europa.eu/youreurope/business/product-requirements/labels-markings/ce-marking/index_en.htm\" target=\"_blank\"><u>mark their products</u></a> with a symbol, \"CE,\" when their products comply with European regulatory standards and meet <a href=\"https://single-market-economy.ec.europa.eu/single-market/goods/ce-marking_en\" target=\"_blank\"><u>health, safety, and environmental protection requirements</u></a>.</p>   <p>\"And when European companies put it on their machine, we believe them,\" Richtberg says. \"What Chinese companies are doing, they're putting a logo on their products — <a href=\"https://www.kimuagroup.com/news/differences-between-ce-and-china-export-markings/\" target=\"_blank\"><u>which looks pretty much exactly the same</u></a> — but it means exported from China.\"</p>   <p>Besides some differences in spacing, the symbols look almost identical. It's almost as if Chinese manufacturers are messing with their Western competitors. \"It would be funny if it weren't so sad for our industry,\" Richtberg says.</p>   <div>\n            <div>\n        <picture>\n            <source srcset=\"https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/1422x936+0+0/resize/400/quality/85/format/webp/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Ff8%2Ff1%2Faca6b05640b78fa3d2e7cd8538ca%2Fscreenshot-2025-09-25-at-2-08-38-pm.png 400w, https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/1422x936+0+0/resize/600/quality/85/format/webp/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Ff8%2Ff1%2Faca6b05640b78fa3d2e7cd8538ca%2Fscreenshot-2025-09-25-at-2-08-38-pm.png 600w, https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/1422x936+0+0/resize/800/quality/85/format/webp/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Ff8%2Ff1%2Faca6b05640b78fa3d2e7cd8538ca%2Fscreenshot-2025-09-25-at-2-08-38-pm.png 800w, https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/1422x936+0+0/resize/900/quality/85/format/webp/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Ff8%2Ff1%2Faca6b05640b78fa3d2e7cd8538ca%2Fscreenshot-2025-09-25-at-2-08-38-pm.png 900w, https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/1422x936+0+0/resize/1200/quality/85/format/webp/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Ff8%2Ff1%2Faca6b05640b78fa3d2e7cd8538ca%2Fscreenshot-2025-09-25-at-2-08-38-pm.png 1200w, https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/1422x936+0+0/resize/1600/quality/85/format/webp/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Ff8%2Ff1%2Faca6b05640b78fa3d2e7cd8538ca%2Fscreenshot-2025-09-25-at-2-08-38-pm.png 1600w, https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/1422x936+0+0/resize/1800/quality/85/format/webp/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Ff8%2Ff1%2Faca6b05640b78fa3d2e7cd8538ca%2Fscreenshot-2025-09-25-at-2-08-38-pm.png 1800w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1025px) 650px, calc(100vw - 30px)\" type=\"image/webp\"></source>\n            <source srcset=\"https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/1422x936+0+0/resize/400/quality/85/format/png/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Ff8%2Ff1%2Faca6b05640b78fa3d2e7cd8538ca%2Fscreenshot-2025-09-25-at-2-08-38-pm.png 400w, https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/1422x936+0+0/resize/600/quality/85/format/png/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Ff8%2Ff1%2Faca6b05640b78fa3d2e7cd8538ca%2Fscreenshot-2025-09-25-at-2-08-38-pm.png 600w, https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/1422x936+0+0/resize/800/quality/85/format/png/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Ff8%2Ff1%2Faca6b05640b78fa3d2e7cd8538ca%2Fscreenshot-2025-09-25-at-2-08-38-pm.png 800w, https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/1422x936+0+0/resize/900/quality/85/format/png/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Ff8%2Ff1%2Faca6b05640b78fa3d2e7cd8538ca%2Fscreenshot-2025-09-25-at-2-08-38-pm.png 900w, https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/1422x936+0+0/resize/1200/quality/85/format/png/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Ff8%2Ff1%2Faca6b05640b78fa3d2e7cd8538ca%2Fscreenshot-2025-09-25-at-2-08-38-pm.png 1200w, https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/1422x936+0+0/resize/1600/quality/85/format/png/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Ff8%2Ff1%2Faca6b05640b78fa3d2e7cd8538ca%2Fscreenshot-2025-09-25-at-2-08-38-pm.png 1600w, https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/1422x936+0+0/resize/1800/quality/85/format/png/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Ff8%2Ff1%2Faca6b05640b78fa3d2e7cd8538ca%2Fscreenshot-2025-09-25-at-2-08-38-pm.png 1800w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1025px) 650px, calc(100vw - 30px)\" type=\"image/png\"></source>\n            <img src=\"https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/1422x936+0+0/resize/1100/quality/50/format/png/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Ff8%2Ff1%2Faca6b05640b78fa3d2e7cd8538ca%2Fscreenshot-2025-09-25-at-2-08-38-pm.png\" alt=\"Screenshot 2025-09-25 at 2.08.38 PM.png\" />\n        </picture>\n</div>\n<div>\n    <p><span>\n        Kimua Group\n    </span>\n</p></div>\n   </div>\n   <p>An even bigger issue that could make this unfair competition is that the Chinese government has been showering their country's manufacturers with subsidies. Chinese manufacturers are coddled by the government by, for example, being given free or cheap land, access to cheap credit, and support even when they fail to become profitable. A <a href=\"https://www.imf.org/en/Publications/WP/Issues/2025/08/07/Industrial-Policy-in-China-Quantification-and-Impact-on-Misallocation-568888#:~:text=Summary,policy%20and%20increase%20its%20transparency.\" target=\"_blank\"><u>recent IMF study</u></a> estimated that annual Chinese subsidies to their industries amount to a staggering 4 percent of their GDP.</p>   <h3>How Germany should respond</h3>   <p>For years, Richtberg says, the VDMA has been urging Germany and the EU to get China to play by the rules, follow regulations, and end subsidies that make global competition unfair. But, he says, China hasn't been listening. The VDMA is calling on the German government to lower taxes and reduce regulations so their companies can be more competitive. And, in a break with the past, the VDMA is now expressing support for erecting countervailing tariffs when foreign products are found to be made with the support of government subsidies. Most of the economists we spoke to also expressed support for countervailing tariffs.</p>   \n   <p>However, European Union tariffs will only protect German companies within Europe. A crucial problem for Germany is that its economy has been incredibly dependent on exports. According to <a href=\"https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/NE.EXP.GNFS.ZS?locations=DE-US\" target=\"_blank\"><u>data from the World Bank</u></a>, in 2024, German exports accounted for more than 42 percent of its GDP. Compare that to the United States, where exports accounted for less than 11 percent of GDP. How will Germany compete with China in export markets outside the EU?</p>   <p>This gets to why the second China Shock in Germany could prove much more devastating than the first one proved to be in the United States. For one thing, the first China Shock centered on the imports of low-end manufacturing goods. Even then, it killed more than a million manufacturing jobs in the US and workers and communities struggled to adapt.</p>   <p>And the US has long been less reliant on manufacturing than Germany. When the China Shock was hitting the US economy in the early 2000s, manufacturing (value-added) accounted for about 13 percent of US GDP. Today it accounts for only about 10 percent of U.S. GDP. Manufacturing accounts <a href=\"https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/NV.IND.MANF.ZS?locations=DE-US\" target=\"_blank\"><u>for about 18 percent</u></a> of Germany's GDP, according to the World Bank.</p>   <p>The export-led industrial model that Germany has pursued for decades is now at a crossroads. In addition to the China Shock, there's the retreat of the United States behind a tariff wall. That means Germany is struggling to sell products in what were long its two biggest export markets.</p>   <p>And, Tordoir says, high U.S. tariffs against Chinese goods are hurting Germany through another channel: \"Chinese products are bouncing off the U.S. tariff wall and are being rerouted.\" So, Tordoir says, Chinese exporters are looking to sell more in Europe, where there are much lower tariffs.</p>   <p>Tordoir says one core issue in all of this is that Chinese consumers don't consume enough, and he hopes that one win-win solution for everyone will be convincing China to pursue policy reforms that increase their domestic consumption and stop their export onslaught.</p>   \n   <p>Germany — which itself long pursued an export-led growth model and ran huge trade surpluses, sometimes to the chagrin of other nations — has recently begun working to increase domestic spending. The country, under Chancellor Friedrich Merz, has passed constitutional reforms that allow the government to spend more, and the government has begun to do so on things like defense and infrastructure.</p>   <p>\"The only way out that I can see is that we need to rely on internal demand, demand from the European Union really,\" Südekum says. He thinks that Germany's recent spending reforms, which he was involved in, are an important first step. As a next step, he and Tordoir both expressed support for the idea that the European Union should develop incentive schemes to encourage European consumers to \"Buy European.\"</p>   <p>As far as other policies to help Germany overcome its current struggles, some of the economists we spoke with, ironically, pointed to China as worthy of some emulation.</p>   <p>Tordoir said it's worth studying how the Chinese government made strategic investments and pursued far-sighted industrial policies that are now paying incredible dividends. It may be harder to wrangle a diverse group of liberal democracies with different interests, but he hopes that Germany will join other EU nations to develop EU-wide industrial policies to boost their own strategic sectors.</p>   <p>Marin worries that Germany has been failing to innovate in crucial technological sectors, including electric vehicles and batteries. A new book titled <a href=\"https://swiftpress.com/book/kaput/\" target=\"_blank\"><em><u>Kaput: The End of the German Miracle</u></em></a><em>, </em>by German business journalist Wolfgang Münchau, offers a rather harsh critique of German leaders in recent decades for clinging to an old industrial model and being unwilling to make important investments and policy changes in the face of epic technological changes. Germany lacks a vibrant digital sector and a significant venture capital industry — and even its world-famous automakers have been slow to pivot to electric vehicles and the integration of cutting-edge software into their cars.</p>   <p>Marin says a big reason for China's technological leapfrogging was due to a particular model in which it got Western companies to form joint ventures with Chinese companies, thereby transferring technology and know-how to their workers and entrepreneurs. She <a href=\"https://cepr.org/voxeu/columns/china-shock-hits-germany\" target=\"_blank\"><u>argues</u></a> that Germany should \"reverse-engineer\" this model, and get foreign companies — including from China — to now help German workers and companies advance technologically since they've fallen behind in crucial areas.</p>\n</div>"
