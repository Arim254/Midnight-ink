The executive order was confirmed to NPR by a White House official who was not authorized to discuss the matter.</p>   <p>A White House fact sheet explains that under the executive order, the name \"Department of War\" will serve as a \"secondary title\" for the Department of Defense. </p>   \n   <p>According to the fact sheet, the order will also authorize Defense Department officials to substitute the word \"war\" into their titles. For example, the Secretary of Defense could use the title Secretary of War. </p>   <p>Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth appeared to acknowledge the change in <a href=\"https://x.com/PeteHegseth/status/1963727635143639327\" target=\"_blank\">a post</a> on social media on Thursday, writing simply, \"DEPARTMENT OF WAR.\" </p>   <p>President Trump has previously signaled that a change was in the works. During an appearance in the Oval Office last month, <a href=\"https://rollcall.com/factbase/trump/transcript/donald-trump-remarks-proclamation-afghanistan-servicemembers-august-25-2025/\" target=\"_blank\">Trump said</a> that War Department \"just sounded to me better.\"</p>   <p>It's not clear whether Trump can officially change the name without congressional action, but he told reporters, \"We're just gonna do it.\"</p>   <p>\"I'm sure Congress will go along if we need that. I don't think we even need that. But if we need that, I'm sure Congress will go along,\" Trump said.</p>   <p>Almost from the country's founding, the military was overseen by the War Department, but the sprawling agency took on its current name following an act of Congress<a href=\"https://www.trumanlibrary.gov/library/public-papers/177/statement-president-upon-signing-national-security-act-amendments-1949\" target=\"_blank\"> in 1949</a>. At the time, the change marked the culmination of an effort by President Harry Truman to unify the Air Force, Army and Navy under the umbrella of a single department.</p>   <p>As the largest department in the U.S. government, even just changing signs, seals and titles could prove costly. In 2023, an Army official told Congress that an effort to rename only nine Army bases would cost taxpayers <a href=\"https://www.militarytimes.com/news/your-military/2023/03/24/the-cost-to-rename-9-confederacy-honoring-army-bases-has-doubled/#:~:text=The%20cost%20to%20rename%209%20Confederacy%2Dhonoring%20Army%20bases%20has%20doubled,-By%20Karen%20Jowers&amp;text=The%20cost%20of%20renaming%20the,pay%20%2439%20million%2C%20said%20Lt\" target=\"_blank\">$39 million</a>.</p>   \n   <p><em>Danielle Kurtzleben and Quil Lawrence contributed to this report.</em> </p>\n</div>"

It's like a different city.\"</p>   \n   <p>Trump, who travels in an armored limousine with a huge security detail, also said: \"I feel very safe now.\"</p>   <p>The White House said on Tuesday that 1,669 people have been arrested since the president's surge of federal officers into the nation's capital began on Aug. 7. A sizeable chunk of those arrests are for immigration-related offenses. </p>   <p>The administration has not provided the names or case numbers for any of the individuals who have been arrested or what they've been charged with on an individual basis, despite repeated NPR requests for such information.</p>   <p>NPR combed through court records and other data for the first two weeks of Trump's takeover of D.C. police — Aug. 11 to Aug. 25 — to get a better understanding of who has been swept up in the federal surge for non-immigration offenses and what charges they are facing.</p>   <h3>The situation in the nation's capital is unique.</h3>   <p>There is no local district attorney's office in Washington, D.C. Instead, federal prosecutors at the U.S. Attorney's Office handle both local and federal crimes. The D.C. Attorney General's Office, meanwhile, prosecutes juvenile crimes as well as certain adult misdemeanors for local crimes.</p>   <p>Prosecutions for local crimes go through the Superior Court of the District of Columbia, while federal cases land in U.S. District Court.</p>   \n   <p>The vast majority of people arrested or formally charged over the Aug. 11 to Aug. 25 timeframe — nearly 1,100 defendants — saw their cases go through superior court.</p>   <p>Lawyers who work in the courthouse say they are swamped. The courtroom where defendants are arraigned has on some days been working past 1 a.m., which attorneys say is almost unheard of.</p>   \n   <p>Of the more than 1,050 defendants whose cases have gone to superior court, prosecutors charged around 20% with felonies: more serious offenses that include drug and gun crimes.</p>   <p>The remaining 80% of the cases were either misdemeanors, warrants, traffic offenses or prosecutors dropping the case.</p>   <p>Attorneys say prosecutors decide not to pursue a case — a move known as \"no papering\" — for a range of reasons, including weak evidence, a questionable search or finding that the alleged offense is too minor to merit the time and expense of pursuing it.</p>   <p>The percentage of cases the U.S. Attorney's Office drops at this early stage varies, but in recent months it has been between 10% and 20%, according to lawyers who work in the courthouse.</p>   \n   <p>In the first week of the federal takeover, prosecutors dropped around 17% of cases, according to records reviewed by NPR.</p>   <p>In the second week, that figure fell to less than 1%.</p>   <p>Defense attorneys say that shift is striking since the deficiencies that previously led the U.S. Attorney's Office to weed out certain cases have not suddenly stopped occurring.</p>   <h3>Federal cases</h3>   <p>At least 35 cases were filed and unsealed in federal court over the first two weeks of the takeover. More than half of those involved gun charges or gun and drug charges, according to an NPR analysis.</p>   <p>In one case, federal agents pulled a car over after the driver failed to use his turn signal, according to court papers. Officers allegedly found a loaded handgun, 143.5 grams of crack cocaine, plastic baggies and $900 in cash in the car.</p>   \n   <p>The driver, Anthony Grant, had multiple prior convictions for drug and gun-related offenses. A judge has ordered him to remain in custody without bond.</p>   <p>The second most common charge among these cases is assaulting, resisting or impeding certain officers. Some of those cases involve violence. In one instance, court papers say the defendant struck a federal agent with his car while fleeing an attempted arrest at a gas station.</p>   <p>Several of these cases, however, involve contact with officers that falls far short of that.</p>   <p>One defendant, for example, Sean Charles Dunn, threw a sub sandwich at a federal agent, hitting the officer in the chest.</p>   <p>In another case, the defendant, Scott Pichon, allegedly spit on two South Carolina National Guard troops while riding past them on a scooter outside D.C.'s Union Station.     </p>   \n   <h3>Questions of overreach</h3>   <p>Despite an aggressive push from law enforcement and prosecutors, some of the cases have unraveled before federal judges and grand juries.</p>   <p>Take the <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2025/08/26/g-s1-85119/crime-washington-dc-judges-arrests\" target=\"_blank\">gun case against Torez Riley</a>. Police said in court papers that they found two firearms in Riley's crossbody satchel when they stopped him in a Trader Joe's grocery store. Riley had previously been convicted on weapons and drug charges, according to court papers.</p>   <p>At a hearing last week, U.S. Magistrate Judge Zia Faruqui said Riley appeared to have been singled out by the police because he was a Black man carrying a satchel that looked heavy.</p>   <p>\"It is without a doubt the most illegal search I've even seen in my life,\" Faruqui said from the bench. \"I'm absolutely flabbergasted at what has happened. A high school student would know this was an illegal search.\"</p>   <p>The U.S. Attorney's Office later filed papers to dismiss the case, which the judge granted.</p>   <p>Other cases have run into trouble with grand juries.</p>   \n   <p>It is extremely rare for grand juries to reject charges proposed by prosecutors.</p>   <p>But on multiple occasions in recent weeks grand juries in D.C. have done exactly that, including in the case against the man who hurled a sandwich at a federal agent.</p>   <p>In that instance, prosecutors reduced the charge to a misdemeanor after failing to secure an indictment from the grand jury.<br /></p>   <p><em>NPR's Luke Garrett and Carrie Johnson contributed to this report. </em></p>\n</div>"

It comes at the urging of President Trump.</p>   \n</div><div>\n    <p>JUANA SUMMERS, HOST: </p><p> Republican leaders in Missouri have now answered President Trump's call to redraw voting districts and help Republican candidates in next year's congressional elections. Usually, states do their redistricting early in the decade after the national census comes in. But this year, halfway through the decade, Texas Republicans have already approved a new map there. And today, Missouri lawmakers are discussing a plan that's expected to pass next week. St. Louis Public Radio's Jason Rosenbaum joins us from the Capitol in Jefferson City. Hey there.</p><p>JASON ROSENBAUM, BYLINE: Hey, Juana. Thank you for having me.</p><p>SUMMERS: Thanks for being here, Jason. Tell us what are they trying to do with districts there in Missouri?</p><p>ROSENBAUM: So right now, Missouri has six Republican-leaning districts and two heavily Democratic districts, and their delegation in the House consists of six Republicans and two Democrats. Republican Governor Mike Kehoe wants lawmakers to convert Democratic Congressman Emanuel Cleaver's district, which takes in most of Kansas City, into a much more GOP-leaning seat. Republicans say this is fair game in politics. In fact, I spoke with GOP State Representative Bill Hardwick, who told me his voters in rural Pulaski County like Trump and want to see Republicans retain control of Congress. I talked with him before a public hearing today.</p><p>BILL HARDWICK: I think that partisan gerrymandering is not a threat to the republic. I think it's what's been happening since the republic was founded, essentially. I don't necessarily like - it's not that I - that's not what I think is ideal. I just think that it's hyperbolic to say that partisan gerrymandering is, like, the end of America.</p><p>ROSENBAUM: And this comes after Trump exerted direct pressure on the governor and Republican lawmakers to overhaul its map so that the GOP can maintain its slim hold over the U.S. House.</p><p>SUMMERS: Jason, I'd love to hear some of what you have been hearing from people that you've been talking to in the state in the last few days about this effort.</p><p>ROSENBAUM: Missouri Democratic voters have been absolutely irate over the push to redraw the state's congressional lines, and they contend that it's against the state constitution. And they also say that Republicans were content with the current map until Trump exerted pressure on them. They also say it dilutes the voting power of Black voters. Sharon Schneeberger came to the state Capitol from Columbia, which is about 30 miles away. She acknowledges that stopping the map from passing the legislature may not be possible, since Democrats are vastly outnumbered in the General Assembly, but she says it's important to speak out, especially since the current map already favors Republicans.</p><p>SHARON SCHNEEBERGER: I think the train is out of the station. But honestly, I feel like we all have to keep telling them that we care about our state and we care about what they do in Jefferson City. And all of us should be represented.</p><p>ROSENBAUM: And it should be noted that even some Republicans now concede that the map could backfire, since splitting up Democratic voters in Kansas City could make nearby Republican districts more competitive.</p><p>SUMMERS: Jason, this is part of a redistricting race that President Trump has set off across the country. Where do other states stand?</p><p>ROSENBAUM: Texas finished work on their map, which could net five seats for Republicans, and Florida and Indiana may also redraw their maps.</p><p>SUMMERS: Got it. Now, that's from the Republican side. How are Democrats countering?</p><p>ROSENBAUM: California Governor Gavin Newsom is backing a plan that would recraft his state's districts to basically counteract what Texas is doing. Illinois and Maryland Democrats haven't ruled out redrawing their maps, though their congressional districts are already skewed heavily against Republicans. The stakes are really high, since Trump needs a Republican Congress to support his agenda and avoid investigations of his administration that Democrats could launch if they take over the House.</p><p>SUMMERS: St. Louis Public Radio's Jason Rosenbaum, thank you.</p><p>ROSENBAUM: Thank you.</p><p>(SOUNDBITE OF KATZROAR'S \"POMEGRANATE SEEDS\")</p>\n    <p>Copyright © 2025 NPR.

Kennedy Jr. faced calls to resign from Democrats and unexpected criticism from Republicans.</p>   <p>Several Republican senators brought up the legacy of President Donald Trump's Operation Warp Speed, which sent a safe COVID vaccine to the public in record time, helping save millions of lives. They pushed Kennedy to explain his current approach to the shots and mRNA technology.</p>   \n   <p>Under his leadership, the health agency cancelled hundreds of millions of dollars in research funding on mRNA technology for future vaccines, and the Food and Drug Administration limited access to the COVID shots, saying only people at high risk of complications from COVID or those over 65.</p>   <p>\"President Trump deserves a Nobel Prize for Operation Warp Speed,\" said Sen. Bill Cassidy, a Louisiana Republican and physician, whose vote was critical in Kennedy's confirmation. He demanded Kennedy explain his changing stance on COVID vaccines, and said: \"effectively, we're denying people vaccine\" — an assertion echoed by many physicians' groups including the American Association of Pediatrics and the American Medical Association.</p>   <p>Cassidy had exacted assurances from Kennedy during his confirmation process in February that he would not restrict Americans' access to vaccines, a promise the senator now accuses Kennedy of violating. Kennedy <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/sections/shots-health-news/2025/06/13/nx-s1-5429604/cdc-rfk-acip-vaccine-committee\" target=\"_blank\">fired the entire </a>17-member Advisory Panel on Immunization Practices at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, replacing them with members Cassidy argued are largely unscientific vaccine skeptics with vested financial interests in suing vaccine makers.</p>   \n   <p>Another Republican physician on the Senate Finance Committee, Dr. John Barrasso of Wyoming, joined Democrats in criticizing Kennedy for undermining vaccines.</p>   <p>\"In your confirmation hearings, you promised to uphold the highest standards for vaccines. Since then, I've grown deeply concerned,\" Barrasso told Kennedy at the hearing. \"I've been hearing from many of my medical colleagues, and there are real concerns that safe, proven vaccines like measles, like hepatitis B and others, could be in jeopardy and that would put Americans at risk and reverse decades of progress.\"</p>   \n   <p>He expressed concern that Kennedy could politicize vaccines further and undermine public health.</p>   <h3>CDC leadership change debated</h3>   <p>Kennedy hotly defended his decisions and statements on vaccines and on changes at the CDC, arguing the agencies have historically relied on bad data. </p>   \n   <p>\"These changes were absolutely necessary adjustments to restore the agency to its role as the world's gold standard public health agency,\" he said. He claimed he had the backing of \"scientists and doctors are supporting me all across the country.\"</p>   <p>Senators also repeatedly asked Kennedy about his decision to push out newly confirmed CDC chief Susan Monarez. Though she was his own pick to lead the agency, he said Monarez was lying when she claimed she was fired from that job after only a month for <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/opinion/robert-f-kennedy-jr-the-cdc-and-me-b4ca2eaa\" target=\"_blank\">insisting on rigorous scientific review.</a> </p>   <p>In response to questions from Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., Kennedy said: \"I told her she had to resign because I asked her, 'Are you a trustworthy person?' And she said, 'No.'\"</p>   <p>Trump administration allies like Republican Ron Johnson of Wisconsin rushed to his defense, calling the senators' pointed questions \"abuse,\" and lauding Kennedy for his attempts to overhaul health agencies.</p>   <h3>Vaccine access arguments</h3>   <p>Kennedy's seven-and-a-half month tenure as Health Secretary is roiling the fields of science and health. His early sweeping changes included mass layoffs across the federal health and science agencies, from the FDA to the CDC to the National Institutes of Health.</p>   <p>Democratic senators took issue with these and other changes, as they and Kennedy accused each other of lying and manipulating data to serve political ends.</p>   <p>The committee's ranking Democratic member Sen. Ron Wyden criticized Kennedy's approach to vaccines: \"I think Secretary Kennedy is dead set on making it harder for children to get vaccines and that kids are going to die because of it,\" he said.</p>   \n   <p>Sen. Warren challenged Kennedy to \"honor your promise that you made when you were looking to get confirmed\" not to take away vaccines from people who want them. She said his recent moves <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/sections/shots-health-news/2025/08/27/nx-s1-5515503/fda-covid-vaccines-restricted\" target=\"_blank\">to change the classification of the COVID vaccine</a> do just that.</p>   <p>In response, Kennedy said \"everybody can get access to them\" for free, including those on Medicare and Medicaid, though the many contradictory statements have left many patients, doctors and insurers confused.</p>   <p>Kennedy said it was unclear the COVID vaccine had saved millions of lives — a data point generally accepted by scientists and doctors. But he also seemed to backtrack on assertions that he is \"anti-vaccine,\" arguing that there remain some unknown risks, even with long-approved vaccines.</p>   <p><strong>\"</strong>Saying I'm anti-vaccine is like saying I'm anti-medicine,\" Kennedy said, arguing he just wants more research to look into possible risks. \"It doesn't mean that I'm, you know, anti-vax. It just means I'm pro-science.\"</p>   <p>His argument didn't appear to sway the Democratic senators in attendance, with several calling for Kennedy to resign throughout the hearing.</p>\n</div>"

There are now at least a dozen administration officials serving in two jobs or more.</p>   <p>There's Treasury Secretary/acting IRS Commissioner Scott Bessent; the Health and Human Services deputy secretary who is now also interim director for the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Jim O'Neill; Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy, who is now also the acting NASA administrator; and U.S. Trade Representative Jamieson Greer, who's been put in charge of the Office of Special Counsel.</p>   <p>\"This is no way to run anything and certainly not a way to run our government,\" said Max Stier, who leads the Partnership for Public Service, which exists to promote best practices in government.</p>   <p>Stier is beside himself with all the double- and triple-hatting in the second Trump administration. He says this is like asking \"a single player to be able to play your center and your point guard on your basketball team at the same time.\"</p>   <h3>'There's not enough time in the day'</h3>   <p>In most cases, the jobs opened up when Trump fired the person who previously held it. And then, instead of having someone at that agency ascend to an interim leadership role, Trump chose a Senate-confirmed loyalist — often from a completely unrelated agency. Trump is fully within the law in doing this, but he is an outlier among presidents for operating this way.</p>   \n   <p>\"Other presidents don't tend to do this,\" said Kathryn Dunn Tenpas, who tracks White House staffing at the Brookings Institution.</p>   <p>She's done many oral history interviews with officials from other administrations, all of whom talked about how absolutely overwhelming their jobs were. And they only had one.</p>   <p>\"The notion that somebody could have multiple jobs in a White House is simply beyond the pale,\" said Tenpas. \"There's not enough time in the day.\"</p>   <p>The White House defends the practice, saying Trump has assembled a talented team.</p>   <p>\"Some officials hold multiple roles, which allows for greater communication and collaboration across the administration,\" said Anna Kelly, a White House spokesperson, in a statement to NPR. \"The results of the President's first seven months back in office speak to his exceptional leadership and the capacity of his team to execute all of the American people's priorities — inflation has cooled, the border is secure, our country is strong, and the best is yet to come!\"</p>   <p> Loading... </p>\n   <h3><strong>The heavy-hatters</strong></h3>   <p>Among the many officials with multiple hats, three stand out for their extra-full plates.</p>   <p>One of them is former Ambassador to Germany Richard Grenell, who sat at Trump's side during his visit to California in late January to survey the wildfire damage. Trump asked Grenell to oversee the federal response to the California fires.</p>   <p>Days later, Grenell flew to Venezuela to secure the release of six detained U.S. citizens, in his role as Trump's special missions envoy. Less than two weeks later, Trump gave Grenell a third job as interim executive director of the Kennedy Center, the performing arts center in Washington, D.C.</p>   <p>\"Everything Ric ever touched has worked out,\" Trump said last month, praising a man who, in Trump's first term, also served in multiple overlapping roles.</p>   <p>Another standout is Rubio,<strong> </strong>who became acting national security adviser four months ago. At this point there is no apparent urgency to name a permanent replacement. Historically, there is only one other instance of someone serving as national security adviser and secretary of state simultaneously. That was Henry Kissinger in the Nixon administration.</p>   \n   <p>\"Secretary Rubio's role as national security adviser allows him to better understand the president's priorities and execute them across our foreign policy apparatus as secretary of state,\" said Kelly.</p>   \n   <p>But those are both \"more than full-time jobs,\" said Alexander Gray, who was chief of staff for the National Security Council in the first Trump administration.</p>   <p>He said Rubio is successfully navigating his dual roles of secretary of state and acting national security adviser, by running the National Security Council the way the president wants it run, with Trump and his foreign policy instincts taking the lead.</p>   <p>\"If you don't have delusions of grandeur about what the job is supposed to do, if you don't think you are a policy maker, you can do the job very effectively, even while doing other things,\" said Gray.</p>   <p>The other administration official with as many jobs as Rubio and Grenell is Russell Vought, the director of the Office of Management and Budget. He has also been acting director of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau since February. This dual-role setup also existed in Trump's first term, when OMB director Mick Mulvaney served as acting director of CFPB.</p>   <p>It's a semi-independent watchdog agency most Republicans have opposed since its inception.</p>   <p>\"[Vought] actively wants to dismantle it,\" said Stier. \"So that puts his hand on the tiller to make sure he can run it into the rocks. So, there, I think it says a lot about what they think of our government.\"</p>   \n   <h3>Not an accident</h3>   <p>Vought also became acting director of USAID last week, with the express purpose of closing it down. USAID was created by former President John F. Kennedy and Congress to fight poverty and disease around the world, but the Trump White House argues it was wasting taxpayer dollars.</p>   <p>\"A lot of people think it looks like a comedy skit where Marco Rubio is running every agency,\" said Richard Stern of the conservative Heritage Foundation. \"I actually think this is a process of very carefully putting trusted people in a position to gain that knowledge, to then use it for the betterment of government efficiency.\"</p>   \n   <p>Gray, who served in the first term, has another theory. He believes this is just Trump's management style, honed over a lifetime of running the Trump Organization.</p>   <p>\"And in a family business like the Trump Organization, people wear multiple hats,\" said Gray, explaining that Trump took a similar approach to his first campaign and first term. Now, he said, it's \"turbocharged.\"</p>   <p>\"That's his comfort level,\" Gray said. \"You find people who he's comfortable with, who he thinks do a great job and you just keep giving them more responsibility.\"</p>\n</div>"

    "body": "<div>\n      <p>Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. will testify in a Senate Finance Committee hearing Thursday, a week after turmoil and upheavals rocked the CDC.</p>   \n</div><div>\n    <p>A MARTÍNEZ, HOST: </p><p> Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. is testifying in the Senate this morning after a week of upheaval at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Last week, Kennedy pressured the brand-new CDC director, Susan Monarez, to resign. When she refused, the White House fired her. Then three top CDC officials resigned in protest. Now, that is the backdrop as Kennedy faces the Senate Finance Committee this morning. Selena Simmons-Duffin covers health policy for NPR, and she told us what to know about heading into this meeting.</p><p>SELENA SIMMONS-DUFFIN, BYLINE: Kennedy has replaced a key vaccine advisory panel with his own handpicked roster of people who have a history of anti-vaccine activism. They are set to shake up recommendations on a variety of vaccines later this month. Several Democratic lawmakers, a variety of public health groups and more than a thousand current and former HHS employees have all called on Kennedy to resign in the last few days.</p><p>MARTÍNEZ: Calls for him to resign seem to be resonating with Democrats in Congress.</p><p>SIMMONS-DUFFIN: Yesterday, California, Washington and Oregon launched the West Coast Health Alliance to coordinate their own health guidance and vaccine recommendations.</p><p>MARTÍNEZ: Selena also gave us more context on Republican Senator Bill Cassidy of Louisiana. He's on the Finance Committee.</p><p>SIMMONS-DUFFIN: Cassidy is a physician. He chairs the Health Committee, which oversees HHS, and he believes strongly in vaccines. Kennedy won Cassidy's vote by promising he wouldn't change that CDC vaccine advisory panel. Obviously, Kennedy broke that promise. He fired everyone on that committee and replaced them.</p><p>MARTÍNEZ: And now we can turn to some of what is happening in the Finance Committee room hearing. Here's Secretary Kennedy near the top of the hearing. He was soon interrupted by a protester.</p><p>(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)</p><p>ROBERT F KENNEDY JR: We have been the busiest, most proactive administration in HHS history. In just half a year, we've taken on food dyes, baby formula contamination, the GRAS loophole, fluoride in our drinking water, gas station heroin, electronic cigarettes, drug prices, prior authorization, information blocking...</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED PROTESTER: [inaudible] prior authorization [inaudible] .</p><p>(SOUNDBITE OF GAVEL BANGING)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED PROTESTER: It takes over three months to get a prior authorization.</p><p>(SOUNDBITE OF GAVEL BANGING)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED PROTESTER: Senator Kennedy, do you know some people...</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>MICHAEL CRAPO: The committee will come to order.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED PROTESTER: ...Authorization? You're killing millions of people.</p><p>MARTÍNEZ: Yeah, Kennedy has gotten a start on that list of issues that he mentioned, and some states have passed laws on things such as food dyes and labeling ultra-processed foods. But for the most part, NPR's reporting shows that meaningful change in public health and health policy has not happened yet. And from that introduction, Kennedy and Democratic Senators were going at it. Here's an exchange with Senator Ron Wyden of Oregon.</p><p>(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)</p><p>RON WYDEN: I don't get letters from thousands of people who are not political saying that this set of changes is going to damage American health care and particularly these health care agencies for decades to come. I don't get any letters from people saying...</p><p>KENNEDY: Well, you know, maybe the people...</p><p>WYDEN: ...Hey, this is going to make a big difference forever.</p><p>KENNEDY: And maybe you're listening to a selective group of people.</p><p>WYDEN: Well, you get me some of the letters from...</p><p>KENNEDY: Yeah. And I will...</p><p>WYDEN: Fine. OK.</p><p>KENNEDY: I will tell you what, Senator.</p><p>WYDEN: I've got 30 seconds.</p><p>KENNEDY: I will put my mailbag against your mailbag any day of the week.</p><p>WYDEN: I've got 30 seconds.</p><p>MARTÍNEZ: All right.

    "body": "<div>\n      <p>In a contentious hearing, Senators from both parties called on Robert F. Kennedy Jr. to defend his actions as health secretary. He has made changes to vaccine access and to the CDC leadership.</p>   \n</div><div>\n    <p>ARI SHAPIRO, HOST: </p><p> Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. testified in the Senate today, and as expected, it was fiery.</p><p>(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)</p><p>ROBERT F KENNEDY JR: You're making things up to scare people, and it's a lie.</p><p>MAGGIE HASSAN: I don't think...</p><p>KENNEDY: Anything to get...</p><p>HASSAN: I don't - with respect, I do not think I'm the one making the things up. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.</p><p>KENNEDY: You are lying right now, senator.</p><p>SHAPIRO: That is just a taste of the nearly three-hour hearing. That exchange was with Senator Maggie Hassan, Democrat of New Hampshire. NPR health policy correspondent Selena Simmons-Duffin watched the hearing closely. Hi, Selena.</p><p>SELENA SIMMONS-DUFFIN, BYLINE: Hi, Ari.</p><p>SHAPIRO: There's been chaos recently at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, including the firing of the recently confirmed CDC director. So what did we learn about that today?</p><p>SIMMONS-DUFFIN: Well, right as the hearing was beginning, Susan Monarez, the CDC director who was fired, published an op-ed in The Wall Street Journal. And this is just a few days after Kennedy published his own op-ed there. Kennedy, in the hearing, confirmed that he asked her to fire career CDC scientists and Monarez refused, but he also contradicted her account. Here is Senator Elizabeth Warren, Democrat from Massachusetts.</p><p>(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)</p><p>KENNEDY: Medicaid...</p><p>ELIZABETH WARREN: Did you tell...</p><p>KENNEDY: ...Will still pay for them.</p><p>WARREN: ... The head of the CDC that if she refused to sign off on your changes to the childhood vaccine schedule, that she had to resign?</p><p>KENNEDY: No, I told her that she had to resign 'cause I asked her, are you a trustworthy person? And she said, no.</p><p>SIMMONS-DUFFIN: You can hear Warren and others in the room respond to that with, what? He went on to accuse Monarez of lying. I asked Monarez's attorney if she had any response to this version of events, but I haven't heard back.</p><p>SHAPIRO: Vaccines came up a bit in that clip of tape you just played, and they were a major topic of the hearing. What was discussed?</p><p>SIMMONS-DUFFIN: Yeah, so one really interesting line of questioning from both sides of the aisle was about Operation Warp Speed. President Trump has described this as one of his greatest accomplishments. It involved the government and private companies working together to bring a new vaccine to market for this emerging virus in record time. Kennedy praised Trump throughout the hearing, but he struggled to square that praise with his recent actions as secretary.</p><p>SHAPIRO: Give us an example. What do you mean?</p><p>SIMMONS-DUFFIN: Well, this year, because the FDA's approval of the COVID-19 booster limits who can get it, there's all this confusion about how the fall rollout is going to go. Kennedy, in the hearing, refused to acknowledge that that does, in effect, limit who has access to the vaccines. And he also refused to concede that COVID vaccines saved millions of lives, which is something there's scientific consensus about. Here is an exchange with Senator Bill Cassidy, Republican of Louisiana. He's a physician, and he told Kennedy it surprised him that here he was praising Operation Warp Speed after working as an attorney to restrict access to that vaccine.</p><p>(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)</p><p>BILL CASSIDY: It also surprises me because you've canceled, or HHS did but apparently under your direction, $500 million in contracts using the mRNA vaccine platform that was critical to Operation Warp Speed; again, an accomplishment that I think President Trump should get a Nobel Prize for.</p><p>SHAPIRO: Now, Selena, that's striking because Senator Cassidy cast one of the key votes to confirm Kennedy as health secretary.</p><p>SIMMONS-DUFFIN: Yeah, that's right. But that's only after Kennedy made lots of promises not to drastically change federal vaccine policy. Cassidy supports vaccines. He's a physician. He said he's seen how they spare people suffering and save lives. But Kennedy has now gone and broken a lot of those promises, and Cassidy has been reticent to publicly hold him to account. Cassidy and several other Republican senators in this hearing were critical of Kennedy's anti-vaccine posture, but they didn't go so far as to join their Democratic colleagues in calling for him to resign.</p><p>SHAPIRO: But apart from Congress, we saw this letter yesterday signed by more than a thousand HHS employees and public health organizations calling for Kennedy's resignation. Any news on that front?</p><p>SIMMONS-DUFFIN: There are no signs that Kennedy plans to resign. The question is whether President Trump will continue to back him. So far, it seems like, yes, Trump still supports him and is giving him leeway to upend federal health policy in all sorts of different ways.</p><p>SHAPIRO: NPR's Selena Simmons-Duffin, thank you.</p><p>SIMMONS-DUFFIN: You're welcome.</p>\n    <p>Copyright © 2025 NPR.

Kennedy Jr. testified before the Senate Finance Committee on Thursday. </p>   <p><strong><em>Read our latest story on </em></strong><a href=\"https://www.npr.org/sections/shots-health-news/2025/09/04/nx-s1-5528966/rfk-kennedy-hearing-covid-vaccines-cdc\" target=\"_blank\"><strong><em>what happened during the hearing</em></strong></a><strong><em>.</em></strong></p>   <p>The hearing came a week after Kennedy pressured the brand-new Centers for Disease Control and Prevention director, Susan Monarez, to resign, and when she refused, the White House fired her. Three top CDC officials then <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/sections/shots-health-news/2025/08/29/nx-s1-5522036/cdc-rfk-hhs-monarez-jim-oneill-leadership\" target=\"_blank\">resigned in protest</a>.</p>   \n   <p>The hearing's stated focus was the president's 2026 health care agenda and Kennedy's goal to Make America Healthy Again. But Secretary Kennedy <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/sections/shots-health-news/2025/09/04/nx-s1-5528966/rfk-kennedy-hearing-covid-vaccines-cdc\" target=\"_blank\">faced questions</a> about CDC leadership in disarray, and his moves to overhaul federal vaccine policy, amid growing calls for his resignation, including from more than a thousand <a href=\"http://savehhs.org/\" target=\"_blank\">current and former HHS staff</a> and numerous medical groups.</p>   <p>Here are three things to know about Kennedy's leadership going into the hearing.</p>   <h3>1. Kennedy's anti-vaccine activism is alive and well</h3>   <p>Kennedy built his reputation on anti-vaccine advocacy. That made some senators wary of confirming him, so he spent time leading up to his confirmation vote in February reassuring them:</p>   \n   <p>\"If confirmed, I will do nothing as HHS secretary that makes it difficult or discourages people from taking vaccines,\" <a href=\"https://www.finance.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/responses_to_questions_for_the_record_to_robert_f_kennedy_jrpart2.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">he wrote repeatedly</a> in answer to written questions from members of the Senate Finance Committee.</p>   \n   <p>He also said that he would accept \"unprecedented\" input from Republican Sen. Bill Cassidy, a physician and vaccine supporter who chairs the Senate committee that oversees HHS and is a member of the finance committee.</p>   <p>Kennedy has broken many of the <a href=\"https://www.cassidy.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/cassidy-delivers-floor-speech-in-support-of-rfk-jr-to-be-hhs-secretary/\" target=\"_blank\">specific promises</a> he made to Cassidy. He moved to dramatically transform the federal government's approach to vaccines, from investment in biomedical research to the FDA approval process, to access. Already, some who want the new COVID-19 booster are <a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/delayed-vaccine-meeting-shifting-policies-make-difficult-people-get-co-rcna228055\" target=\"_blank\">finding they can't get it</a>.</p>   <p>Access to other vaccines could be limited next. Kennedy fired all the members of a key vaccine advisory panel in June and <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/sections/shots-health-news/2025/06/11/nx-s1-5430870/cdc-vaccine-experts-rfk-jr\" target=\"_blank\">replaced them</a> with his own roster of people who have a history of anti-vaccine activism. Later this month, they're set to consider recommendations for COVID-19 vaccines as well as more routine vaccines, including the respiratory virus RSV and measles.</p>   <p>Changes to those recommendations would have huge implications for public health, insurance coverage and availability across the country.</p>   <h3>2. He doesn't seem bothered by departures from the CDC</h3>   <p>Kennedy wrote an <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/opinion/robert-f-kennedy-jr-were-restoring-public-trust-in-the-cdc-6f26c176?gaa_at=eafs&amp;gaa_n=ASWzDAjqj4aZMecrBVMCXBibHzwGmXxe4yD5aWiQyMcHPqNpSIQjPdpTa_UDCpKbnAU%3D&amp;gaa_ts=68b87851&amp;gaa_sig=WufMl93o-lN9jNtVCjcb2Smy3SWrjf_mom7Xy-_XoIs1YCukEU5BSWdqYHB_p4LIOeSqwHPi14p81wk6BCrAzQ%3D%3D\" target=\"_blank\">op-ed in <em>The Wall Street Journal</em></a> defending his handling of the CDC over the weekend.</p>   \n   <p>\"Over the decades, bureaucratic inertia, politicized science and mission creep have corroded [the CDC's] purpose and squandered public trust,\" he wrote. \"The path forward is clear: Restore the CDC's focus on infectious disease, invest in innovation, and rebuild trust through integrity and transparency.\"</p>   <p>In an <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cCnf8mIg5A\" target=\"_blank\">interview on Fox News</a> last week, Kennedy said he wasn't surprised by the three top CDC scientists resigning. \"The agency is in trouble and we need to fix it and we are fixing it, and it may be that some people should not be working there anymore,\" he said.</p>   <p>It's not just high-profile leaders who have left HHS in recent days. Approximately <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/sections/shots-health-news/2025/04/05/g-s1-58312/hhs-layoffs-rif-cdc-fda-nih\" target=\"_blank\">20,000 HHS staff</a> — roughly one-quarter of the agency's workforce — have been fired or taken offers to leave voluntarily since Kennedy took over as secretary. The exodus was partly driven by the Elon Musk-led effort to shrink the federal workforce, but Kennedy <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ArVor4oGPhc\" target=\"_blank\">has also said</a> in April that cutting so many staff was necessary to streamline the agency and to capitalize on the \"political momentum.\"</p>   <p>HHS Communications Director Andrew Nixon echoed that idea in response to the letter from HHS staff calling for Kennedy to resign: </p>   <p>\"Secretary Kennedy has been clear: the CDC has been broken for a long time. Restoring it as the world's most trusted guardian of public health will take sustained reform and more personnel changes,\" Nixon wrote in a statement shared with NPR.</p>   <h3>3. Kennedy and his allies want to talk about healthy food</h3>   <p>As public health groups have grown increasingly alarmed by what's happening at HHS, Kennedy has been traveling around the country promoting state efforts to cut out certain dyes and limit ultra-processed products in the food supply.</p>   <p>Kennedy held <a href=\"https://www.hhs.gov/press-room/secretary-kennedy-maha-tour-austin-tx.html\" target=\"_blank\">a press conference</a> with Texas Gov. Greg Abbott last week as he signed several bills, including one that limits additives in school lunches and another that prevents people from using food benefits for sugary drinks and candy.</p>   \n   <p>These efforts in Texas and similar bills in other states will help right the health of the American people, Kennedy said. \"We have more chronic disease than we can treat and we know what it is and we know it is the food we are eating,\" he said.<br /></p>\n</div>"

Over the last few months, Donald Trump has launched three huge attacks on the independence of the Fed: first, threatening to fire Jerome Powell; then, deciding that Powell had spent too much money on renovations of the Federal Reserve building and he could fire him for cause; and when that failed, now trying to fire Lisa Cook, another member of the Fed board — all of them [are] direct attacks on the independence of the Fed. </p>   <p>Right now, the banking committee should be investigating the president's direct attacks on that independence, not pretending that it's business as usual.</p>   \n   <p><strong>Inskeep:</strong> Given that the president has challenged the independence of the Fed and many other federal agencies in a way that nobody has seen for a long time, why does the independence of the Fed matter that much?</p>   <p><strong>Warren: </strong>If we have a totally politicized Fed, not a Fed that's making decisions about interest rates, for example, based on the best data they've got, but a Fed that says, 'What do you want us to do, Mr. President?' then what happens is everyone loses confidence in the Fed, in our central bank, and in the decisions they make. And that ultimately drives up the cost of mortgages and car loans and credit cards for Americans across this country. And this isn't a theoretical argument here. We've actually seen this happen before. Countries where authoritarians take control of the central bank suffer from higher inflation. And who does it hit hardest? It hits working people across that country.</p>   \n   <p><strong>Inskeep:</strong> Some people will know that you have been sharply critical of Jerome Powell, the Fed chairman, from time to time. How would you rate his performance now?</p>   <p><strong>Warren:</strong> I completely disagreed with Chair Powell since he was first nominated by Donald Trump, that's how far back he goes. I have disagreed with him on regulatory policy. I think he's way too easy on the banks. And I have disagreed with him on interest rate policy. I thought he should have lowered interest rates two years ago, and I have said so quite vocally and done my best to persuade him. But I have never, ever questioned the independence of the Fed and the Fed's ultimate power to make those decisions based on their best judgment of what's good for the United States of America.</p>   <p><strong>Inskeep: </strong>So you, like the President, are hoping for an interest rate cut this month, it sounds like, but you're saying your methods are different?</p>   <p><strong>Warren:</strong> Yes. But what I don't want to see is that Donald Trump has squeezed out the independence of the Fed, and that he's managed to get his own lackeys in there, that he's managed to fire someone at the Fed. Because as soon as that happens, the value that the United States has built up, literally for more than a century, by having an independent Fed, we lose the gold standard. And ultimately that costs the American economy. And it also, most importantly, costs American workers.</p>   <p><strong>Inskeep: </strong>Do you believe that your Republican colleagues are concerned?</p>   <p><strong>Warren:</strong> I think some of them are, because they understand the value of this independent Fed. And that's true whether we've got a Democrat in the White House or a Republican in the White House that we need independence, really, across the board, for our financial regulators. Because as soon as the politicians can grab them by the throat and say, for political reasons, 'Here's the economic decision I want you to make,' people start to understand that the whole game is being played on a political playing field, not an economic playing field. That doesn't make for a stronger economy, that doesn't build our GDP, and it sure doesn't make life better for American workers.</p>   \n   <p><em>The broadcast version of this interview was produced by Ana Perez and edited by HJ Mai.</em></p>\n</div>"

Mark Green in July. The district, which includes parts of west Nashville, is where Mason Foley, 28, has chosen to launch a long-shot bid for the House.</p>   \n   <p>The Tennessee Republican did not respond to multiple requests for an interview.</p>   <p>His campaign may provide an early example of what a young Republican's pitch for Congress may look like during Trump's second term. In his announcement video, Foley repeatedly highlighted his age, referring to the election as \"a once-in-a-generation chance to choose a better future.\"</p>   <p>\"President Trump's legislative policies are making real progress,\" he said. \"He needs a new generation of conservative leaders to step up and help finish what he started. We have to put the American dream back in reach.\"</p>   <p>That message stands in stark contrast to the one being amplified on the other side of the aisle, where some <a href=\"https://x.com/liamelkind/status/1950536198780338622\" target=\"_blank\">younger Democrats have demanded</a> that longtime progressive leaders must step aside so that the party can <a href=\"https://x.com/KatAbughazaleh?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor\" target=\"_blank\">rework its playbook</a> following the 2024 election.</p>   <p>In addition to President Trump's <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2024/11/22/nx-s1-5199119/2024-election-exit-polls-demographics-black-latino-voters\" target=\"_blank\">gains</a> with <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2024/11/07/g-s1-33331/unpacking-the-2024-youth-vote-heres-what-we-know-so-far\" target=\"_blank\">voters under 30 last fall</a>, the Democratic Party has lost significant support from young Americans in recent years. Less than a quarter approve of the job performance of Congressional Democrats, according to the latest <a href=\"https://iop.harvard.edu/youth-poll/50th-edition-spring-2025\" target=\"_blank\">Harvard Youth Poll conducted in March</a>, marking a 25-point drop compared to the fall of 2020. Congressional Republicans hold a slightly higher approval rating than Democrats, standing at 29%, but it's remained consistent over the same period.</p>   <p>Some young Democrats running for Congress are calling attention to the <a href=\"https://www.pewresearch.org/short-reads/2025/01/16/age-and-generation-in-the-119th-congress-somewhat-younger-with-fewer-boomers-and-more-gen-xers/\" target=\"_blank\">age breakdown</a> and <a href=\"https://clerk.house.gov/member_info/Terms_of_Service.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">lengthy tenures</a> that many hold within the party, and citing these as reasons why the party has struggled.</p>   \n   <p>It's a message that 26-year-old community organizer Liam Elkind pushed earlier this summer when he launched a bid for New York's 12th Congressional district, challenging Democrat Jerry Nadler, who is 78. The longtime Democrat has since said he will retire at the end of the congressional term, a decision that Elkind had urged him to make.</p>   <p>\"Our leaders need to answer the call now, and they aren't,\" Elkind said in his announcement video. \"I grew up voting for [Nadler,] but we need new leaders to meet this moment because we can't wait.\"</p>   \n   <p>Democrats have a larger share of members over the age of 80, outnumbering Republicans 13-4. And of the 52 House lawmakers who have served more than 10 terms in office, nearly 70% are Democrats. Since 2022, the party has also seen <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/8-members-congress-died-office-democrats-2025-5\" target=\"_blank\">eight party members die while in office</a> — six were age 70 or older.</p>   <p>Republicans have a <a href=\"https://www.house.gov/leadership\" target=\"_blank\">slightly older</a> House <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2025/03/27/nx-s1-5342528/trump-elise-stefanik-un-ambassador-nomination\" target=\"_blank\">leadership</a>, with an average age of 57 compared to Democrats at 52.</p>   <p>\"When young people in the Republican Party step up, they're more welcomed,\" said Adam Pennings, the executive director of Run Gen Z, a group that helps young conservatives run for state and local office.</p>   <h3>Young lawmakers are still a small share of Congress</h3>   <p>Over the last decade, several prominent Democratic and Republican politicians in their 20s and 30s have been sent to Congress, including Rep. Elise Stefanik, R-N.Y., who was first elected at the age of 30 in 2014, Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., at 28 in 2018 and Rep. Maxwell Frost, D-Fla, who, at 25, became the first Gen Z elected to Congress in 2022. That said, though the share of younger House members <a href=\"https://www.pewresearch.org/short-reads/2025/01/16/age-and-generation-in-the-119th-congress-somewhat-younger-with-fewer-boomers-and-more-gen-xers/\" target=\"_blank\">has increased</a> in recent years, lawmakers under 40 make up <a href=\"https://fiscalnote.com/blog/how-old-is-the-119th-congress\" target=\"_blank\">less than 10% of the current Congress</a>.</p>   <p>To Pennings, young Republicans vying for office may be more likely to follow a more traditional path, first running for state and local office positions before eying Congress.</p>   <p>\"When their congressman … steps down, then they'll step up. Whereas on the other side, it's a lot more of trying to fight in, and maybe even some might say, dog-eat-dog,\" he said. \"On the Republican side. It's more of a waiting in the wings.\"</p>   <p>\"There's a sense of like, why break it if it's working?\"</p>\n</div>"
