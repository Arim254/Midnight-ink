In a heated committee meeting Wednesday, state lawmakers said they're considering a lot of options before deciding in October.</p>   <p>Unlike other Republican-led states redistricting this year, Utah's new map is expected to give Democrats more of a chance at winning at least one of the state's four congressional districts, which could help Democrats in the race to control the U.S. House. State lawmakers were ordered to draw the new districts after a<strong> </strong>Utah judge ruled they had acted unconstitutionally in creating the map used in 2022.</p>   \n   <h2>GOP \"complying under protest\"¬†</h2>   <p>The Legislature's Republican supermajority has made it clear they are not happy they had to go back to the drawing board and are complying under protest. The map must be approved by lawmakers and the court by Nov. 10 to be used in the 2026 midterms, according to Lt. Gov. Deidre Henderson's <strong>o</strong>ffice.</p>   <p>Utah's <a href=\"https://citygate.utleg.gov/legdistricting/comments/plan/156/12\" target=\"_blank\"><u>voided congressional map</u></a> split the bluest area of the state, Salt Lake County, among the state's four districts, making four U.S. House seats safe for Republicans. That split was the biggest critique of the map, especially by county residents.</p>   <p>All of the proposed new boundaries also <a href=\"https://www.kuer.org/politics-government/2025-09-23/as-utah-moves-forward-in-redistricting-a-divided-salt-lake-county-is-inevitable\" target=\"_blank\"><u>divide the county</u></a>, the most populous one in the state, but some only split it into two districts.</p>   <p>Instead of advancing a single proposed map, the Legislature's redistricting committee said Wednesday it will let the public weigh in on any map that has been posted on its <a href=\"https://citygate.utleg.gov/legdistricting/utah/comment_links\" target=\"_blank\"><u>website</u></a> before making a decision. That includes six maps commissioned by lawmakers, as well as proposals submitted by citizens.</p>   <p>Lawmakers will choose from one of those maps, and only those maps, on Oct. 6. The map will go back to court for the judge to approve.</p>   <h2>The national picture</h2>   <p>Though Utah's redistricting originated from a local court case, it's playing out amid a <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2025/09/14/nx-s1-5538407/after-missouri-what-state-is-next-a-redistricting-race-started-by-trump-continues\" target=\"_blank\"><u>redistricting race </u></a>around the country set off by President Trump.</p>   \n   <p>Usually, states redistrict early in the decade using new census numbers. In order to try to keep the GOP hold on the U.S. House and worried about midterm election losses, Trump has asked states led by Republicans to redistrict ahead of 2026 and help their party win seats.</p>   <p>At Trump's urging, Texas passed a new map that could help Republicans win five more seats. <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2025/08/22/nx-s1-5511300/california-texas-redistricting-shifts\" target=\"_blank\"><u>To counter, California's</u></a> Democratic leaders are asking voters to approve a new map that could help their party win five seats on November 4. <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2025/09/12/nx-s1-5537977/redistricting-midterms-trump-missouri\" target=\"_blank\"><u>Missouri has followed</u></a> Trump's lead, with the Republican-led Legislature passing a map that could oust a Democratic congressman.</p>   <p>Republican leaders in Indiana and Florida say they are working to follow Trump's call. They and other Republicans across the country say holding the U.S. House is key to maintaining Trump's agenda and preventing investigations of his administration that could be launched by a Democratic-led House.</p>   <h2>The Utahns who sued</h2>   <p>In 2018, Utah voters narrowly approved a ballot initiative known as Proposition 4 that, among other things, created an independent redistricting commission and prohibited gerrymandering. In 2020, the Legislature repealed and replaced the initiative with a law that weakened the commission's role and took out the prohibition on partisan gerrymandering.</p>   <p>In 2022, the League of Women Voters of Utah, Mormon Women for Ethical Government and a handful of Utah voters sued the Legislature. They alleged that the Legislature violated Utahns' right to alter and reform their government and that the state's 2021 congressional map was gerrymandered to favor Republicans.</p>   <p>In <a href=\"https://www.kuer.org/politics-government/2025-08-25/judge-tosses-out-utahs-congressional-maps-in-long-fought-redistricting-case\" target=\"_blank\"><u>August of this year</u></a>, a Utah judge ruled that the Legislature's override of Proposition 4 was unconstitutional. Because the state's 2021 congressional map was a product of that unconstitutional act, the judge said it had to go.</p>   <p>Without valid maps, the Legislature has to redraw the boundaries in accordance with Proposition 4, which the judge also reinstated.</p>   \n   <p>At the same time, GOP state lawmakers are trying to pass a <a href=\"https://le.utah.gov/interim/2025/pdf/00003633.pdf\" target=\"_blank\"><u>bill</u></a> that creates a single standardized method for testing \"partisan symmetry\" in congressional maps to determine if boundaries are fair.</p>   <p>But Democrats on the committee argued that the test does not work in states like Utah where one party dominates in statewide elections.</p>   <p>That proposed test is what most concerns Elizabeth Rasmussen, executive director of Better Boundaries, the group that backed Proposition 4.</p>   <p>\"I just see this as weaponization of the process to get a map they want,\" Rasmussen says.</p>   <p>If the plaintiffs in the lawsuit have objections to the Legislature's map, they are also allowed to submit a proposal to the court. If that happens, there will be additional court hearings in late October to decide which map will be used.</p>\n</div>"

That last job brought threats that required around-the-clock security and hostility from Trump, who has said he wants to throw Smith in jail or deport him. (The Justice Department dropped both of Smith's criminal cases, as a matter of policy, after Trump won the 2024 election.)</p>   <p>At the start of his remarks, Smith said he would not discuss politics, and he never referred to Trump by name. Instead, he delivered a call to defend the rule of law, punctuated by recent examples of its erosion.</p>   <p>For Smith, the headlines tell part of the story. Already this year, career prosecutors in Manhattan have <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2025/02/14/nx-s1-5298040/justice-department-eric-adams-fallout\" target=\"_blank\">quit en masse</a> after DOJ leaders sought to walk away from a corruption case against New York Mayor Eric Adams. </p>   <p>The White House issued <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2025/03/28/nx-s1-5343616/two-major-law-firms-fight-back-against-trump-orders-seen-as-retribution\" target=\"_blank\">executive orders targeting big law firms</a> because of their clients or lawyers they hired who had run afoul of Trump. Only days after Smith's speech, not far from George Mason University, in the Eastern District of Virginia, came a marked escalation. Last weekend, Trump posted a message on social media, saying the Justice Department <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2025/09/22/nx-s1-5550132/trump-justice-department-comey-letitia-james-virginia\" target=\"_blank\">needed to prosecute</a> former FBI Director Jim Comey, New York Attorney General Letitia James, and California Democratic Sen. Adam Schiff ‚Äî and fast. The U.S. attorney in the Eastern District, who had cast doubt on cases against Comey and James, was forced out and replaced with a Trump ally who has no experience as a prosecutor. </p>   \n   <p>\"Political opponents, critics, perceived enemies are targeted for investigation or arrest to silence them, and the prosecutors instead of investigating ‚Ä¶ cases, they're left to figure out a basis for charges after the fact,\" Smith said.</p>   <p>On the flip side, people close to the president face no danger of investigation or prosecution, even when the facts and the law might merit those steps, Smith said.</p>   <p>\"Where the rule of law is eroding, friends of the president do not have to worry about following the same laws that the rest of us follow,\" Smith said. \"Exceptions will be made. And nobody, I mean nobody, in a president's administration, or his allies, will be investigated or prosecuted, no matter what they do.\"</p>   <p>This week, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt forcefully rejected the idea that Trump is misusing the Justice Department. </p>   <p>\"The President is fulfilling his promise to restore a Department of Justice that demands accountability, and it is not weaponizing the Department of Justice,\" Leavitt said.</p>   \n   <p>But for Smith, and many other DOJ veterans, traditions and norms over decades have been thrown aside along with the idea that the law applies equally to friends and foes. At the heart of the system is the idea that \"law itself must be the same for everyone but importantly it must be enforced the same for everyone,\" Smith said.</p>   <p>Now, current leaders at the Justice Department, who helped defend Trump in cases that Smith brought, seem to have abandoned norms and traditions about nonpartisan enforcement if they clash with what the president wants, he said. </p>   <p>\"They were hired and they're thus driven to get outcomes, no matter the cost to the credibility of the institution they represent, no matter whether those outcomes are legal, no matter whether those outcomes are just,\" Smith said.</p>   <p>This year, grand juries in Washington, D.C., and Los Angeles have been rejecting demands to issue indictments amid the administration's surge of federal immigration enforcement in those cities. And judges have been rejecting search warrants and calling out prosecutors for a lack of credibility. It's extremely difficult to witness, Smith said.</p>   \n   <p>He saved his strongest remarks for public servants at the DOJ and elsewhere, offering praise for their integrity and expertise. Several Justice Department lawyers have <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2025/07/30/nx-s1-5476311/trump-fired-workers-justice-department\" target=\"_blank\">resigned or been fired</a> this year in flash points across the country. </p>   <p>\"Today we have seen conflict between the leadership of the Justice Department and line career prosecutors like never before,\" Smith said. \"And the reason is simple: because the leadership is asking those prosecutors to do things that the prosecutors know are wrong.\"</p>\n</div>"

Vought has argued that presidents ‚Äî rather than Congress ‚Äî have considerable <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2024/11/26/nx-s1-5195528/trump-impoundment-government-cuts\" target=\"_blank\">power to control more spending</a>, Democrats and the nonpartisan Government Accountability Office (GAO) have disagreed.</p>   <p>House Republicans have passed a bill that would fund the government at current levels through Nov. 21. But in the Senate, where 60 votes are required to pass the bill, Democrats have insisted on adding a number of measures, including subsidies for Affordable Care Act insurance premiums. They are set to expire, hitting Americans who buy insurance on the Obamacare exchanges with shocking price increases this year.</p>   <h3>Schumer calls the memo \"an attempt at intimidation\"</h3>   <p>Democratic leaders had been set to sit down with Trump on Thursday to talk about the issues, but Trump canceled the meeting, saying Democrats were making \"<a href=\"https://x.com/TrumpTruthOnX/status/1970486815087042821\" target=\"_blank\">unserious and ridiculous demands</a>.\"</p>   <p>The White House said it supports the bill passed by House Republicans. In the memo, the OMB said its layoff notices could be avoided if Democrats decide to support the bill.</p>   \n   <p>Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., called the memo \"an attempt at intimidation\" in a statement released late Wednesday night.</p>   <p>\"This is nothing new and has nothing to do with funding the government,\" Schumer wrote. \"These unnecessary firings will either be overturned in court or the administration will end up hiring the workers back, just like they did as recently as today.\"</p>   <p>Congressional Democrats are under intense pressure from their voters to stand up to Trump after they <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2025/03/13/g-s1-53495/senate-democrats-funding-bill-government-shutdown\" target=\"_blank\">provided the votes to pass a six-month spending bill in March</a>.</p>   \n   <p>At the time, Schumer said that a shutdown would give Trump the power to pick and choose what departments and agencies to reopen.</p>   <p>The plan for layoff notices is a break from the Trump administration's approach during his first term. In 2018, Trump refused to sign a bipartisan stopgap government funding bill because it didn't include funding for his border wall, sparking a 35-day shutdown, the longest on record. But the administration worked to reduce the pain from the shutdown by keeping as much of the government open as possible, and pledging to give furloughed workers back pay as quickly as possible.</p>\n</div>"

General Assembly, demanding an investigation into back-to-back mishaps with an escalator, a teleprompter and a sound system ‚Äî for which the U.N. is at least partially blaming the White House.</p>   <p>\"A REAL DISGRACE took place at the United Nations yesterday ‚Äî Not one, not two, but three very sinister events!\" Trump wrote in a Wednesday <a href=\"https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/posts/115261466629181518\" target=\"_blank\">Truth Social post</a>. \"This wasn't a coincidence, this was triple sabotage at the UN. They ought to be ashamed of themselves ‚Ä¶ No wonder the United Nations hasn't been able to do the job that they were put in existence to do.\"</p>   \n   <p>Trump visited the U.N.'s headquarters in New York City on Tuesday to speak to a room of world leaders. The trouble began pretty much the moment he stepped on the escalator, just behind first lady Melania Trump.</p>   \n   <p>The escalator stopped abruptly mere seconds into their ride, leaving the couple briefly stranded. Video of the incident, which some are calling \"Escalatorgate,\" <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GTAa97rSFgY\" target=\"_blank\">shows them walking up</a> the rest of the stairs while holding onto the handrails.</p>   <p>A short while later, as Trump took the podium to begin his remarks, he observed that his teleprompter wasn't working. He said he didn't mind, adding that \"I can only say that whoever's operating this teleprompter is in big trouble,\" which drew laughs from the crowd.</p>   <p>Trump took a moment to recount ‚Äî and seemingly laugh off ‚Äî the technical difficulties of the day.</p>   <p>\"All I got from the United Nations was an escalator that on the way up stopped right in the middle,\" he said, adding that if the first lady weren't in such good shape, she would have fallen. \"And then a teleprompter that didn't work.\"</p>   <p>Then, with the device back on track, Trump proceeded to deliver a nearly <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2025/09/23/nx-s1-5546864/trump-foreign-policy-priorities-unga\" target=\"_blank\">hourlong speech</a> in which <a href=\"https://www.rev.com/transcripts/trump-speaks-at-un\" target=\"_blank\">he called</a> global warming a hoax, criticized Europe for its \"unmitigated immigration disaster\" and accused the U.N. of \"funding an assault on Western countries and their borders.\"</p>   \n   <p>Trump has long been critical of the organization, <a href=\"https://www.state.gov/releases/2025/07/the-united-states-withdraws-from-the-united-nations-educational-scientific-and-cultural-organization-unesco\" target=\"_blank\">withdrawing the U.S. from UNESCO</a> and the U.N. Human Rights Council in both of his terms. But he said during a <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/world/trump-blasts-un-not-helping-us-led-peace-efforts-backs-it-100-2025-09-23/\" target=\"_blank\">meeting later Tuesday</a> with U.N. Secretary-General Ant√≥nio Guterres that the U.S. is \"behind the United Nations 100%.\"</p>   \n   <p>Afterward, Trump <a href=\"https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/posts/115254363337739989\" target=\"_blank\">wrote on Truth Social</a> that he believed his speech was \"very well received,\" and that the teleprompter and escalator malfunctions \"probably made the speech more interesting than it would have been otherwise.\"</p>   <p>But his tone quickly changed. By Wednesday, Trump was calling the escalator incident \"absolutely sabotage\" and calling for the arrest of those responsible.</p>   <p>\"It's amazing that Melania and I didn't fall forward onto the sharp edges of these steel steps, face first,\" Trump wrote. \"It was only that we were each holding the handrail tightly or, it would have been a disaster.\"</p>   <p>Trump said the Secret Service was investigating, and demanded that the U.N. open its own probe. On Wednesday night, Guterres spokesperson St√©phane Dujarric <a href=\"https://www.un.org/sg/en/content/sg/statement/2025-09-24/statement-attributable-the-spokesperson-for-the-secretary-general-%E2%80%93-correspondence-the-permanent-mission-of-the-united-states-the-united-nations\" target=\"_blank\">announced</a> that the secretary-general had ordered a thorough investigation.</p>   <p>\"He conveyed that the UN is ready to cooperate in full transparency with relevant US authorities on this matter to determine what caused the incidents referred to by the United States,\" he wrote.</p>   <div>\n            <div>\n        <picture>\n            <source srcset=\"https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/7809x5208+0+0/resize/400/quality/85/format/webp/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fad%2Fd8%2F93a37d384bd4896511fc1653400b%2Fgettyimages-2236921769.jpg 400w, https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/7809x5208+0+0/resize/600/quality/85/format/webp/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fad%2Fd8%2F93a37d384bd4896511fc1653400b%2Fgettyimages-2236921769.jpg 600w, https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/7809x5208+0+0/resize/800/quality/85/format/webp/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fad%2Fd8%2F93a37d384bd4896511fc1653400b%2Fgettyimages-2236921769.jpg 800w, https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/7809x5208+0+0/resize/900/quality/85/format/webp/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fad%2Fd8%2F93a37d384bd4896511fc1653400b%2Fgettyimages-2236921769.jpg 900w, https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/7809x5208+0+0/resize/1200/quality/85/format/webp/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fad%2Fd8%2F93a37d384bd4896511fc1653400b%2Fgettyimages-2236921769.jpg 1200w, https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/7809x5208+0+0/resize/1600/quality/85/format/webp/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fad%2Fd8%2F93a37d384bd4896511fc1653400b%2Fgettyimages-2236921769.jpg 1600w, https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/7809x5208+0+0/resize/1800/quality/85/format/webp/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fad%2Fd8%2F93a37d384bd4896511fc1653400b%2Fgettyimages-2236921769.jpg 1800w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1025px) 650px, calc(100vw - 30px)\" type=\"image/webp\"></source>\n            <source srcset=\"https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/7809x5208+0+0/resize/400/quality/85/format/jpeg/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fad%2Fd8%2F93a37d384bd4896511fc1653400b%2Fgettyimages-2236921769.jpg 400w, https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/7809x5208+0+0/resize/600/quality/85/format/jpeg/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fad%2Fd8%2F93a37d384bd4896511fc1653400b%2Fgettyimages-2236921769.jpg 600w, https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/7809x5208+0+0/resize/800/quality/85/format/jpeg/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fad%2Fd8%2F93a37d384bd4896511fc1653400b%2Fgettyimages-2236921769.jpg 800w, https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/7809x5208+0+0/resize/900/quality/85/format/jpeg/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fad%2Fd8%2F93a37d384bd4896511fc1653400b%2Fgettyimages-2236921769.jpg 900w, https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/7809x5208+0+0/resize/1200/quality/85/format/jpeg/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fad%2Fd8%2F93a37d384bd4896511fc1653400b%2Fgettyimages-2236921769.jpg 1200w, https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/7809x5208+0+0/resize/1600/quality/85/format/jpeg/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fad%2Fd8%2F93a37d384bd4896511fc1653400b%2Fgettyimages-2236921769.jpg 1600w, https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/7809x5208+0+0/resize/1800/quality/85/format/jpeg/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fad%2Fd8%2F93a37d384bd4896511fc1653400b%2Fgettyimages-2236921769.jpg 1800w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1025px) 650px, calc(100vw - 30px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\"></source>\n            <img src=\"https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/7809x5208+0+0/resize/1100/quality/50/format/jpeg/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fad%2Fd8%2F93a37d384bd4896511fc1653400b%2Fgettyimages-2236921769.jpg\" alt=\"President Trump addresses a room full of world leaders from the U.N.'s New York City headquarters.\" />\n        </picture>\n</div>\n<div>\n    <div>\n        <p>\n                Trump addresses a room full of world leaders at the U.N.

Apparently, when the videographer reached the top, he inadvertently triggered a safety feature designed to keep people or objects from getting caught in the gearing, Dujarric said.</p>   <p>\"A subsequent investigation, including a readout of the machine's central processing unit, indicated that the escalator had stopped after a built-in safety mechanism on the comb step was triggered at the top of the escalator,\" he wrote.</p>   <p>The U.N. says the U.S. delegation is responsible for operating the president's teleprompter and referred questions to the White House. </p>   <p>In a statement to NPR, the White House said its staffers were \"prevented by UN staff\" from setting up the teleprompter prior to Trump's speech as promised, so were left \"trying to set the teleprompter up as the President was speaking.\"</p>   <p>Mike Waltz, the freshly confirmed U.S. ambassador to the U.N., <a href=\"https://x.com/USAmbUN/status/1970975737856581672\" target=\"_blank\">tweeted Wednesday</a> that the U.S. has asked the U.N. secretary-general to share a \"detailed explanation of the teleprompter failure's root cause, along with immediate plans to implement robust preventative measures.\"</p>   \n   <p>He also demanded the complete results of the U.N.'s internal investigation into the escalator malfunction, \"including who or what caused it to halt and whether it was intentional sabotage.\"</p>   <div>\n            <div>\n        <picture>\n            <source srcset=\"https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/4729x3153+0+0/resize/400/quality/85/format/webp/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F63%2Fca%2F53fa98ad495498f0360269b94666%2Fap25266547143484.jpg 400w, https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/4729x3153+0+0/resize/600/quality/85/format/webp/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F63%2Fca%2F53fa98ad495498f0360269b94666%2Fap25266547143484.jpg 600w, https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/4729x3153+0+0/resize/800/quality/85/format/webp/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F63%2Fca%2F53fa98ad495498f0360269b94666%2Fap25266547143484.jpg 800w, https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/4729x3153+0+0/resize/900/quality/85/format/webp/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F63%2Fca%2F53fa98ad495498f0360269b94666%2Fap25266547143484.jpg 900w, https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/4729x3153+0+0/resize/1200/quality/85/format/webp/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F63%2Fca%2F53fa98ad495498f0360269b94666%2Fap25266547143484.jpg 1200w, https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/4729x3153+0+0/resize/1600/quality/85/format/webp/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F63%2Fca%2F53fa98ad495498f0360269b94666%2Fap25266547143484.jpg 1600w, https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/4729x3153+0+0/resize/1800/quality/85/format/webp/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F63%2Fca%2F53fa98ad495498f0360269b94666%2Fap25266547143484.jpg 1800w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1025px) 650px, calc(100vw -

He'd received a strong performance review in January, shortly before he was fired.</p>   <p>He was looking forward to finding ways to use artificial intelligence to find inaccuracies in clinical data. Now, he's not sure whether someone else will pick up the work.

At times, he questioned whether government lawyers were telling him the truth.</p>   \n   <p>Back in March, White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt released a statement, accusing the judge of \"attempting to unconstitutionally seize the power of hiring and firing from the Executive Branch,\" and inviting him to run for president himself.</p>   \n   <p>In his Sept. 12 order, Alsup again chastised the government, this time for failing to produce key documents and records as required by the court, frustrating the judicial review process.</p>   <p>\"The 'administrative record' leaves the reader with the feeling that he is being led, blindfolded, along a carefully plotted path through a dense, unseen wood,\" Alsup wrote. \"Here and there, he may hear a rustle in the trees, feel the dark silhouette of a towering form, or intuit some other hint at the forest beyond, but never is he afforded an unfettered view of the landscape through which he passes.\"</p>   <h3>An order to set the record straight on performance</h3>   <div>\n            <div>\n        <picture>\n            <source srcset=\"https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/7788x5192+0+0/resize/400/quality/85/format/webp/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fe8%2F78%2F01a371b349338c72224f9272a277%2Fnpr-09-20-2025-0106.jpg 400w, https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/7788x5192+0+0/resize/600/quality/85/format/webp/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fe8%2F78%2F01a371b349338c72224f9272a277%2Fnpr-09-20-2025-0106.jpg 600w, https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/7788x5192+0+0/resize/800/quality/85/format/webp/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fe8%2F78%2F01a371b349338c72224f9272a277%2Fnpr-09-20-2025-0106.jpg 800w, https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/7788x5192+0+0/resize/900/quality/85/format/webp/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fe8%2F78%2F01a371b349338c72224f9272a277%2Fnpr-09-20-2025-0106.jpg 900w, https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/7788x5192+0+0/resize/1200/quality/85/format/webp/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fe8%2F78%2F01a371b349338c72224f9272a277%2Fnpr-09-20-2025-0106.jpg 1200w, https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/7788x5192+0+0/resize/1600/quality/85/format/webp/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fe8%2F78%2F01a371b349338c72224f9272a277%2Fnpr-09-20-2025-0106.jpg 1600w, https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/7788x5192+0+0/resize/1800/quality/85/format/webp/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fe8%2F78%2F01a371b349338c72224f9272a277%2Fnpr-09-20-2025-0106.jpg 1800w, https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/7788x5192+0+0/resize/2400/quality/85/format/webp/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fe8%2F78%2F01a371b349338c72224f9272a277%2Fnpr-09-20-2025-0106.jpg 2400w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1350px) 953px, (min-width: 1025px) calc(100vw -

The letters also say that the government is only providing such notice due to a court order, and that the government believes the order is \"legally and factually erroneous\" and therefore is appealing it.</p>   <p>This time, Alsup has given federal agencies until Nov. 14 to reissue the letters, without all the disclaimers.</p>   <p>\"There is no need to lard the letters with such distractions,\" Alsup wrote.</p>   <p>The government has appealed Alsup's final order to the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals.</p>   <p>Meanwhile, Beck wonders if she'll forever have a mark on her record.</p>   <p>\"It's going to make it difficult to explain to future employers outside of the government and will absolutely make it difficult to get another federal job,\" she says.<br /></p>\n</div>"

Without them, millions face rate hikes or risk losing their coverage.</p>   \n</div>\n<div>\n    <p>A MART√çNEZ, HOST: </p><p> A government shutdown is looking more and more likely. And this time, it could be far more severe than in the past.</p><p>STEVE INSKEEP, HOST: </p><p> A memo from the White House instructs federal agencies to prepare mass firing plans if funding lapses at the end of the month. This plan goes beyond the usual temporary furloughs during a shutdown. It would permanently cut jobs in programs that are established by law but the president doesn't like. As so often happens, Republicans and Democrats do not agree on a funding measure for the fiscal year that is about to start. Republicans want a short-term extension, while Democrats have insisted that extension should include some protections for people who have health insurance premiums to pay.</p><p>MART√çNEZ: NPR's Selena Simmons-Duffin covers all things health insurance. All right, so let's start with deadlines here. The shutdown could start next week, but there are other key dates at play.</p><p>SELENA SIMMONS-DUFFIN, BYLINE: Yeah. So in just over a month, on November 1st, open enrollment begins on the Affordable Care Act marketplaces. You might know them as Obamacare, healthcare.gov. That's all the same thing. And this is where people shop for insurance if they don't get it through their job - so, you know, a lot of freelancers, small business employees. At the end of the year, something called the enhanced premium tax credits expire. Those have kept premiums affordable for people who get their insurance this way. And if Congress doesn't act to extend those tax credits in the next week or two, people are going to get sticker shock when open enrollment starts and they see that monthly amount they pay for health insurance is going to go way up next year.</p><p>MART√çNEZ: Where did these tax credits come from?</p><p>SIMMONS-DUFFIN: So when the ACA was passed way back in 2010, Congress created kind of a sliding scale to help give people a break on their premiums. But the way it was originally set up didn't work very well. Premiums were still really high for a lot of people, so enrollment was sluggish. And in 2021, Congress stepped in. They sweetened the pot with a lot more federal funding, which made premiums more affordable for people at all income levels. Sabrina Corlette of the Georgetown Center on Health Insurance Reform told me that worked. Enrollment more than doubled. It's now 24 million people. And the uninsured rate for the entire country sank to the lowest it's ever been.</p><p>SABRINA CORLETTE: Incredibly successful effort to get more people into coverage and reduce the uninsured rate.</p><p>MART√çNEZ: All right. So what happens, though, if the enhanced credits expire?</p><p>SIMMONS-DUFFIN: In short, people's costs will go up and enrollment will drop. Ultimately, millions of people could become uninsured. Yesterday, I talked with Emily Pisacreta. She's a senior producer with the health care podcast An Arm And A Leg, which partners with KFF Health News and NPR member station KUOW. They just did an episode about her quest to find ACA insurance, something she really needs since she has Type 1 diabetes. She found a plan that works for her for $500 per month, but it could get much more expensive next year if those enhanced credits expire.</p><p>EMILY PISACRETA, BYLINE: Five hundred dollars a month is not little. And to imagine it going up to almost $900 a month seems really scary.</p><p>SIMMONS-DUFFIN: I talked to somebody who lives in West Virginia who's putting money aside that would go to retirement because of these changes. And another person in Florida told me he's considering finding a new job with benefits if his premium becomes unaffordable.</p><p>MART√çNEZ: So what are the politics on all this? Where does that stand right now?</p><p>SIMMONS-DUFFIN: There are Republican lawmakers who would like to extend these tax credits, others who really don't want to. But either way, it's really hard to see this getting resolved before a shutdown next week since there are no - currently no active talks between the two parties.</p><p>MART√çNEZ: That's NPR health policy correspondent, Selena Simmons-Duffin. Thanks a lot.</p><p>SIMMONS-DUFFIN: You're welcome.</p>\n    <p>Copyright ¬© 2025 NPR.  All rights reserved.

General Assembly, a growing number of experts are calling on diplomats to address what they describe as <a href=\"https://www.ohchr.org/en/press-releases/2025/09/gaza-un-experts-urge-general-assembly-respond-famine-and-genocide\" target=\"_blank\">genocide and famine</a> in Gaza.</p>   <p>Israel strongly rejects accusations that it is guilty of genocide in its nearly two-year campaign in Gaza following the Hamas-led Oct. 7, 2023, attack that killed nearly 1,200 people, with another 250 taken hostage, according to Israeli officials.</p>   <p>The Israeli military campaign that followed has killed more than 64,000 people, including more than 18,000 children, according to Gaza health authorities. Almost all of Gaza's estimated 2 million residents have been forced to flee their homes, often multiple times. Many Palestinians, as well as rights groups and some prominent Americans, have said Israel is responsible for genocide in the enclave.</p>   \n   <p>In the United States, the word has started to enter the public discourse. Polls show Democrats and independents are increasingly likely to describe Israel's actions as genocide, even as Republican views have remained steady.</p>   <p>To understand what the term means and how it has become such a battleground, NPR spoke with historians, legal scholars, military analysts and people living through the war. The scholars say it's difficult to hold states legally responsible for any crimes. And some pointed to a thornier issue: the burden of proving that Israel's war in Gaza is motivated by \"genocidal intent.\"</p>   <h3>What does genocide mean?</h3>   \n   <p>The term \"genocide\" was introduced in 1944 by Polish Jewish lawyer Raphael Lemkin to describe the extermination of European Jews during the Holocaust. Lemkin's early exposure to the history of Ottoman attacks on Armenians and the pogroms in Poland was instrumental in shaping his belief that groups needed protection under international law.</p>   <p>In 1948, four years later, the United Nations adopted the Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide, often called the Genocide Convention, defining genocide as \"any of the following acts committed with intent to destroy, in whole or in part, a national, ethnical, racial or religious group, as such:</p>   \n   <p>(a) Killing members of the group;</p>   <p>(b) Causing serious bodily or mental harm to members of the group;</p>   <p>(c) Deliberately inflicting on the group conditions of life calculated to bring about its physical destruction in whole or in part;</p>   <p>(d) Imposing measures intended to prevent births within the group;</p>   <p>(e) Forcibly transferring children of the group to another group.\"</p>   <p>Both Israel and the U.S. have ratified the convention ‚Äî <a href=\"https://treaties.un.org/pages/ViewDetails.aspx?src=TREATY&mtdsg_no=IV-1&chapter=4\" target=\"_blank\">Israel in 1950</a> and the U.S. in 1988.</p>   <h3>How are countries tried for genocide in courts?</h3>   \n   <p>The International Court of Justice (ICJ) in The Hague, Netherlands, handles disputes between countries, including under the Genocide Convention. A separate court, the International Criminal Court, entered into force in 2002 to prosecute individuals for genocide, war crimes and crimes against humanity. But it has no jurisdiction over countries that haven't joined, among them the U.S., Israel, Myanmar and China. Outside the courts, the U.N. Security Council can authorize the protection of civilians, but that power is often paralyzed by the veto powers of the council's five permanent members.</p>   <p>In Rwanda, the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda ruled that the 1994 mass killings of the Tutsi minority constituted genocide, and it convicted several political and military leaders for organizing and inciting it. In the war following the breakup of the former Yugoslavia, the ICJ found that genocide occurred in 1995 in Srebrenica, where around 8,000 Bosnian Muslims were killed by a Serbian-aligned force. But the court did not hold Serbia directly responsible for committing genocide, only for failing to prevent it.</p>   <p>The U.S. has also formally recognized genocides against Armenians and Darfuris. Then-President Barack Obama labeled ISIS's actions genocide, and President Trump<strong> </strong>used the term to describe the situation facing white South Africans.</p>   <p>Gambia brought a still-ongoing case against Myanmar to the ICJ in 2019, accusing it of genocide over a military campaign that forced more than 700,000 Rohingya to flee. The U.K. and other states argued in that case that intent could be inferred from the mass displacement and harm to children. Myanmar claims it was targeting terrorists, but the court rejected its bid to throw out the case and is now weighing it on the merits.</p>   \n   <h3>Why is \"intent\" in genocide cases hard to prove?</h3>   <p>Genocide is considered the hardest crime to prove in court.</p>   <p>The \"intent\" requirement makes it distinct, said Shannon Fyfe, a legal scholar at Washington and Lee University.</p>   <p>\"Proving intent tends to be the most difficult part of any criminal case,\" she said. \"The ICJ says genocidal intent must be the only reasonable inference from the available evidence.\"</p>   <p>The Genocide Convention's drafters added \"as such\" to require that acts be carried out because of who the group is, not just to achieve another goal ‚Äî something judges struggle to assess.</p>   <h3>Gaza: Early warnings, early rejections</h3>   <div>\n            <div>\n        <picture>\n            <source srcset=\"https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/3750x2500+0+0/resize/400/quality/85/format/webp/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F82%2Fb2%2F2bb7569b494098869d058eabdb44%2Fgettyimages-2150458806.jpg 400w, https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/3750x2500+0+0/resize/600/quality/85/format/webp/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F82%2Fb2%2F2bb7569b494098869d058eabdb44%2Fgettyimages-2150458806.jpg 600w, https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/3750x2500+0+0/resize/800/quality/85/format/webp/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F82%2Fb2%2F2bb7569b494098869d058eabdb44%2Fgettyimages-2150458806.jpg 800w, https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/3750x2500+0+0/resize/900/quality/85/format/webp/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F82%2Fb2%2F2bb7569b494098869d058eabdb44%2Fgettyimages-2150458806.jpg 900w, https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/3750x2500+0+0/resize/1200/quality/85/format/webp/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F82%2Fb2%2F2bb7569b494098869d058eabdb44%2Fgettyimages-2150458806.jpg 1200w, https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/3750x2500+0+0/resize/1600/quality/85/format/webp/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F82%2Fb2%2F2bb7569b494098869d058eabdb44%2Fgettyimages-2150458806.jpg 1600w, https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/3750x2500+0+0/resize/1800/quality/85/format/webp/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F82%2Fb2%2F2bb7569b494098869d058eabdb44%2Fgettyimages-2150458806.jpg 1800w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1025px) 650px, calc(100vw -

No. The convention is activated by the risk of genocide, not just its occurrence. That's the whole point of prevention. That's the meaning of 'Never Again,'\" Segal told NPR, referencing a common saying calling for the Holocaust to never be repeated.</p>   <p>He added that denying Israel was committing any war crimes, including genocide, allowed for Israel's actions to be justified.</p>   <p>\"As if the Hamas-led massacres that day were not terrible enough, Israel and its allies, primarily the United States, including President Biden, immediately started circulating this atrocity propaganda,\" he said. \"The lies and fabrications ‚Äî like the false claim about beheaded babies ‚Äî continuously shifted the focus not to Israeli violence but to the alleged barbarity of the Palestinians, to the point where they were seen as a danger that no international law should apply to.\"</p>   \n   <h3>When did a Palestinian \"genocide\" become a legal claim? A timeline</h3>   <p>In November 2023, the Biden administration <a href=\"https://ccrjustice.org/sites/default/files/attach/2023/11/Complaint_DCI-Pal-v-Biden_w.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">was named in a federal lawsuit</a> filed by the Center for Constitutional Rights and the law firm Van Der Hout LLP on behalf of Palestinian individuals and the human rights organizations Al-Haq and Defense for Children International-Palestine, along with eight other plaintiffs.</p>   <p>The suit alleged that the \"unfolding genocide of the Palestinian people in Gaza has so far been made possible because of the unconditional support\" of President Joe Biden, Secretary of State Antony Blinken and Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin.</p>   <p>Laila Elhaddad, a Palestinian American author from Gaza and one of the plaintiffs, went to court on Jan. 26, 2024, and later told NPR that she knew it was a long shot, but she felt \"uniquely obligated, as an American whose taxes were partly financing the killing of my family members,\" to take legal action.</p>   <p>She added, \"We as Palestinians understood from the start the intent to genocide. Israeli leaders spelled out exactly what they planned to do and then carried it out. We never expected it to go this far. But with no one to stop Netanyahu and no red lines in place, it was no surprise that he felt emboldened to destroy everything.\"</p>   <p>On Jan. 31, 2024, U.S. District Judge Jeffrey White wrote that he found indications that \"the ongoing military siege in Gaza is intended to eradicate a whole people and therefore plausibly falls within the international prohibition against genocide.\" Still, White dismissed the case in 2024, saying the court could not intervene in U.S. foreign policy decisions.</p>   <p>For Elhaddad, the ruling was both validating and bitter.</p>   <p>\"It was cathartic,\" she said, to testify about what her family had endured. But outside the courtroom, she felt silenced. \"Even using the word 'genocide' in opinion pieces was a no from editors I worked with.\"</p>   \n   <p>The hearing of Elhaddad's case, along with those of the other plaintiffs, began just hours after the International Court of Justice in The Hague ruled that it is plausible that Israel has violated the terms of the Genocide Convention in the war in Gaza, in a case brought forward by South Africa. The proceedings remain ongoing and have drawn support from more than 25 countries.</p>   <p>In its case against Israel, South Africa devotes nine pages to claims of genocidal incitement.

Under pressure from the United States, Israel has allowed some aid into the territory, but humanitarian organizations say the conditions imposed by Israel <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2025/09/04/g-s1-86841/gaza-aid-famine-hunger-israel\" target=\"_blank\">severely limit</a> the amount that can reach civilians. </p>   <p>Israeli officials have not provided public evidence to support their claim that Hamas systematically steals aid.

But it is never permissible, even if the war itself is. So war is not a defense. If the legal elements are met, they are met, regardless of other circumstances.\"</p>   <p>On intent, she said, \"If a military leader intends to gain land and removing a group is the only way to do it, that's not necessarily genocide. But if the only reasonable inference from a siege or campaign is that the group itself is being destroyed as such, then that is genocidal intent.\"</p>   <p>In Gaza, she said, that distinction has blurred.</p>   <p>\"There are statements from Israeli officials that suggest intent to destroy, but it's not always clear if they mean Hamas or Gazans,\" she said. \"But I do not think it is reasonable to claim that the siege is a military objective, given that Hamas is already crippled.\"</p>   <p>\"So it may be that the only reasonable inference that can be made about the siege is that it reflects genocidal intent.

But also, people considering the element of 'intent to destroy' that is part of the U.N. definition of genocide seem to find it more consistently now, in the context of a man-made famine, than they did with respect to the previous elements of conflict, which at least from a distance read more as 'war.'\"</p>   <p>In an August 2025 <em>Economist/</em>YouGov poll, 69% of Democrats and 44% of independents said that <a href=\"https://d3nkl3psvxxpe9.cloudfront.net/documents/econTabReport_sBoaiA0.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">Israel was committing genocide against Palestinian civilians</a>.

The percentage of Republicans who thought that genocide was being committed against Palestinians was unchanged at 17%.</p>   <p>In Israel, only a minority of the population shares that view.</p>   <p>A survey conducted in March 2025 and the subject of an essay in <a href=\"https://www.haaretz.com/israel-news/2025-05-28/ty-article-magazine/.premium/yes-to-transfer-82-of-jewish-israelis-back-expelling-gazans/00000197-12a4-df22-a9d7-9ef6af930000\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Haaretz</em> newspaper</a> found that 82% of Jewish Israelis polled backed the expulsion of Gazans and that nearly half, 47%, said they supported killing all Palestinians in \"enemy cities captured by the Israeli army.\"</p>   <p>Martin Shaw, a historical sociologist and the author of <em>What Is Genocide? </em>and<em> The New Age of Genocide: Intellectual and Political Challenges After Gaza</em>, says that the public discourse reveals how \"some people still think that only events like the Holocaust count as genocide, which no expert would argue. Gaza is different from the Holocaust, but it is still a deliberate attempt to destroy a people, which is the meaning of genocide.\"</p>   <p>Shaw, who wrote early in the war that Hamas' killings of Israeli civilians constituted \"genocidal massacres\" and who now believes Gaza is experiencing a genocide, said there is a new dynamic in how the public understanding of the word is being shaped. Israel, he said, believed that by banning international journalists from entering Gaza, \"it could prevent the world from seeing its atrocities.\"</p>   \n   <p>\"It has tried to kill local Palestinian journalists,\" he said, \"but so many ordinary people in Gaza have filmed what Israel is doing that the world has seen it nevertheless.\"</p>   <p>Israel denies deliberately targeting journalists. International news agencies have criticized past Israeli investigations into its military, <a href=\"https://reutersagency.com/media-centre/reuters-and-ap-issue-joint-letter-to-israeli-officials-to-demand-clear-explanation-for-airstrikes-that-killed-journalists-in-gaza\" target=\"_blank\">stating in a recent joint letter</a> following Israeli strikes that killed five journalists in Gaza that such investigations \"rarely result in clarity and action.\"</p>   <p>The Committee to Protect Journalists says the war in Gaza is the deadliest conflict for journalists since it started gathering data in 1992.</p>   \n   <p>Simon, of Yale University, observes that media blackouts are not new. But in the case of Gaza, \"having social media serve as the source of information has made it much harder to agree on the basic understanding of what's actually been going on, and [has] added more to the algorithmic amplification that contributed to the acute polarization over the past two years.\"</p>   <h3>Beyond debates</h3>   <div>\n            <div>\n        <picture>\n            <source srcset=\"https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/6000x4000+0+0/resize/400/quality/85/format/webp/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F89%2F63%2F920dc9ab4cbda98219d6ad9aa2ee%2Fgettyimages-2220186627.jpg 400w, https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/6000x4000+0+0/resize/600/quality/85/format/webp/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F89%2F63%2F920dc9ab4cbda98219d6ad9aa2ee%2Fgettyimages-2220186627.jpg 600w, https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/6000x4000+0+0/resize/800/quality/85/format/webp/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F89%2F63%2F920dc9ab4cbda98219d6ad9aa2ee%2Fgettyimages-2220186627.jpg 800w, https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/6000x4000+0+0/resize/900/quality/85/format/webp/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F89%2F63%2F920dc9ab4cbda98219d6ad9aa2ee%2Fgettyimages-2220186627.jpg 900w, https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/6000x4000+0+0/resize/1200/quality/85/format/webp/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F89%2F63%2F920dc9ab4cbda98219d6ad9aa2ee%2Fgettyimages-2220186627.jpg 1200w, https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/6000x4000+0+0/resize/1600/quality/85/format/webp/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F89%2F63%2F920dc9ab4cbda98219d6ad9aa2ee%2Fgettyimages-2220186627.jpg 1600w, https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/6000x4000+0+0/resize/1800/quality/85/format/webp/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F89%2F63%2F920dc9ab4cbda98219d6ad9aa2ee%2Fgettyimages-2220186627.jpg 1800w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1025px) 650px, calc(100vw -
