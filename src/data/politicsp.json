    "body": "<div>\n      <p>Former FBI Director James Comey has been indicted after a push by President Trump. The move marks a dramatic escalation in Trump's effort to go after his political opponents.</p>   \n</div><div>\n    <p>ANDREW LIMBONG, HOST: </p><p> The Justice Department is following through on President Trump's threats to go after his political enemies. Former FBI director James Comey has been indicted, and tension among federal prosecutors has been building since Trump took office. Trump campaigned on the idea of ending the weaponization of the Justice Department, arguing that he had been unfairly targeted. Here to talk about what's happening and what might come next is NPR senior political editor and correspondent Domenico Montanaro. Hey, Domenico.</p><p>DOMENICO MONTANARO, BYLINE: Hey, Andrew, great to be with you.</p><p>LIMBONG: Yeah, so all right, for someone who came into the office saying he would stop the weaponization, the targeted Comey indictment seems contrary to that, right?</p><p>MONTANARO: Yeah, I mean, he said repeatedly on the campaign trail and during his second term here in the White House that he was going to stop the weaponization. You know, his attorney general, Pam Bondi, said during her confirmation hearing that she would take the politics out of the Justice Department. But it turns out that what they mean by all of that is that it's about anticonservative bias, not removing politically motivated investigations overall. To Trump and his MAGA allies, they see the moves that he's making, like going after Comey, as going after people who deserve it. Frankly, though, none of this is very surprising. Yes, Trump talked about ending weaponization, but he also - remember - said, quote, \"I am your retribution,\" and he's certainly following through on that.</p><p>LIMBONG: And it's not just Comey, right? Remind listeners who else he's gone after.</p><p>MONTANARO: Yeah, I mean, Trump has tried to wrest control of lots of aspects of society. He's gone after the media with lawsuits to try and control the narrative. He pushed ABC, for example, to get Jimmy Kimmel, the comedian, off the air, using the FCC and licensing threats to operationalize what Trump wants.</p><p>He's gone after quasi-independent agencies like the Federal Reserve, the Federal Trade Commission, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau; federal workers who don't, quote, \"align\" with his philosophy universities that don't adhere to what he wants to see taught or not taught or the types of people that they hire.</p><p>And of course, when it comes to the Justice Department, prosecutors were fired who investigated him and the January 6, 2021, siege at the Capitol. Plus he pardoned all of those convicted for their actions on January 6.</p><p>LIMBONG: Usually, there are traditional checks on this power of the executive. Not so much this time.</p><p>MONTANARO: Yeah, and it's quite the opposite. Republicans control both chambers of Congress, and they've only greased the wheels for his agenda and this retribution campaign. You know, he has an open ear at the Supreme Court after he appointed three justices during his first term that have swung the court to be more ideologically conservative. They haven't weighed in yet on this apparent political retribution effort, though, we should say.</p><p>And the only tension that continues here about Trump's philosophy of, you know, being able to put forward this retribution campaign and exerting total control has to be through the lower courts, and of course, that's where this Comey case is going to be heard.</p><p>LIMBONG: Yeah. This apparent retribution is happening despite the fact that Trump didn't face substantial consequences from any of the charges or investigations he's faced, right?</p><p>MONTANARO: Yeah, and the criminal charges against Trump are far more serious than the charges against Comey here. I mean, Trump was facing multiple counts in multiple courts on everything from fraudulent business practices in New York, which he was convicted on, to inciting the January 6 riots. You know, this case against Comey is a very short indictment, just two pages, with a former personal attorney of Trump's who's - just this week was sworn in as the U.S. attorney, and she's the only signee.</p><p>And on the substance, it's about alleged false statements to Congress, statements that the inspector general's office already investigated, about whether Comey authorized a leak about the existence of an investigation into the Clinton Foundation. The IG report stated that they found it highly improbable that Comey would have been approving of the leak. So on its face, this looks like a very thin case.</p><p>LIMBONG: All right, we got 3 1/2 years left in the Trump presidency. What should we expect going forward?</p><p>MONTANARO: I mean, you can expect more to come. I mean, just on Friday, in fact, Trump himself said that this is not about revenge, but about justice and that he, quote, \"thinks that there will be others.\" So there are going to be a lot of people looking over their shoulders, and it may have a chilling effect, or it could make dissenters more dug in.</p><p>LIMBONG: Alright, that's NPR's Domenico Montanaro. Domenico, thanks so much.</p><p>MONTANARO: You're welcome.</p>\n    <p>Copyright © 2025 NPR.  All rights reserved.

But through Oct. 9, the country's capital, Riyadh, is hosting dozens of A-list comedians — many of them American — at the first ever <a href=\"https://www.visitsaudi.com/en/seasons/riyadh-comedy-festival\" target=\"_blank\"><u>Riyadh Comedy Festival</u></a>.</p>   <p>The participation of big-name funnymen, including Dave Chappelle, Aziz Ansari, Kevin Hart and Jimmy Carr, has provoked criticism from fellow comedians, including Marc Maron, Shane Gillis and Stavros Halkias, as well as human rights groups and other commentators.</p>   <p>\"The Saudi government is using the Riyadh Comedy Festival … to deflect attention from its brutal repression of free speech and other pervasive human rights violations,\" said Human Rights Watch in a <a href=\"https://www.hrw.org/news/2025/09/23/saudi-arabia-riyadh-comedy-festival-whitewashes-abuses\" target=\"_blank\"><u>statement</u></a> this week. \"Participating comedians, to avoid contributing to laundering the Saudi government's reputation, should use the comedy festival to publicly urge Saudi authorities to free unjustly detained Saudi dissidents, journalists, and human rights activists.\"</p>   \n   <p>A recent U.S. State Department <a href=\"https://www.state.gov/reports/2024-country-reports-on-human-rights-practices/saudi-arabia/\" target=\"_blank\">report</a> on Saudi Arabia's human rights record in 2024 listed abuses including \"arbitrary or unlawful killings, disappearances, torture, arbitrary arrest and detention, and serious restrictions on freedom of expression and media freedom,\" among other issues.</p>   <h3>Comedians' spat</h3>   <p>In a <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/reel/DO9RDQ0ks4P/?hl=en\" target=\"_blank\"><u>video</u></a> on Maron's Instagram channel, the WTF podcast host took aim at colleagues who signed up to perform at the festival, while referencing the allegations of the Saudi government's <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2021/09/12/1036389448/biden-declassifies-secret-fbi-report-detailing-saudi-nationals-connections-to-9-\" target=\"_blank\">possible involvement in the Sept. 11 attacks</a> and its <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2023/10/02/1202937036/jamal-khashoggi-mbs-murder-saudi-arabia-human-rights\" target=\"_blank\">role in the 2018 murder of journalist Jamal Khashoggi</a>.</p>   <p>\"From the folks that brought you 9/11. Two weeks of laughter in the desert, don't miss it!'\" joked Maron acerbically. \"The same guy that's gonna pay them is the same guy that paid that guy to bone-saw Jamal Khashoggi and put him in a f***ing suitcase. But don't let that stop the yucks, it's gonna be a good time!\"</p>   <p>Gillis and Halkias were both invited to perform at this event, which was <a href=\"https://www.spa.gov.sa/en/N2366242\" target=\"_blank\"><u>announced</u></a> in July by General Entertainment Authority chairman Turki Alalshikh. On his <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/shorts/i-5YGz0z-Ro\" target=\"_blank\"><u>podcast</u></a>, Gillis said he declined a \"significant bag\" to perform at the event. \"I took a principled stand,\" he said. In a podcast <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/shorts/6fGtKnAVeVk\" target=\"_blank\"><u>conversation</u></a> with Chris DiStefano, Halkias said \"Can't do it.\"</p>   \n   <p>Fellow comedian DiStefano, conversely, told Halkias he accepted the invitation: \"I didn't want to do it either,\" he said, adding that it was his wife who urged him to take the money.</p>   <h3>Saudi Arabia's play</h3>   <p>NPR reached out to representatives of nearly every participating comedian for comment, as well as the Saudi embassy in Washington, D.C., and the country's General Entertainment Authority. No one had responded by the time of publication. However, in its statement announcing the event, the General Entertainment Authority described the festival as \"the largest of its kind globally,\" adding that it \"reflects the efforts to amplify Riyadh's status as a leading destination for major cultural and artistic events.\"</p>   <p>As a nation heavily dependent on oil, Saudi Arabia is currently engaged in a plan to diversify itself economically, socially and culturally. Its <a href=\"https://www.vision2030.gov.sa/en\" target=\"_blank\"><u>Vision 2030</u></a> program, implemented in 2016, encompasses efforts to increase the country's visibility on the cultural stage. \"Vision 2030 is a blueprint that is diversifying the economy, empowering citizens, creating a vibrant environment for both local and international investors, and establishing Saudi Arabia as a global leader,\" the website states.</p>   <h3>A history of pushback </h3>   <p>The Riyadh Comedy Festival isn't the first time artists have inspired blowback for accepting invitations to participate in events in Saudi Arabia.</p>   <p>Big name pop music acts including Mariah Carey, The Black Eyed Peas and Justin Bieber all earned criticism for opting to perform in the country in recent years. \"Doesn't she know Saudi Arabia is one of the most repressive and murderous regimes on the planet?\" wrote the activism group Code Pink in a 2019 <a href=\"https://www.codepink.org/dont_artwash_saudi_crimes\" target=\"_blank\"><u>statement</u></a> calling for Carey to cancel her show that year.</p>   <p>And American visual artists who've exhibited their work at Desert X AlUla, a spinoff of the U.S. <a href=\"https://desertx.org/\" target=\"_blank\"><u>Desert X</u></a> art festival in the Saudi Arabian desert, as well as the event's organizers, have also received criticism. In a 2019 <a href=\"https://www.latimes.com/entertainment-arts/story/2019-10-29/desert-x-alula-saudi-arabia\" target=\"_blank\"><u>article</u></a>, <em>Los Angeles Times </em>art critic Christopher Knight called the show \"morally corrupt.\" Knight added: \"Saudi Arabia is an absolute monarchy built on theocratic law. Free expression is forbidden. Illegal. A criminal act.\"</p>   \n   <p>Comedian Tim Dillon said on his <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNa2lhfSWxg\" target=\"_blank\">podcast</a> last month that he signed up for financial reasons. He said he had been offered \"a large sum of money\" — $375,000 for one performance — and said that other comedians had been offered as much as $1.6 million. He told his detractors to \"get over it,\" adding, \"So what if they have slaves, they're paying me enough to look the other way.\"</p>   <p>But in an <a href=\"https://audioboom.com/posts/8779658-462-cancelling-kimmel-fired-from-riyadh-the-prison-housing-market\" target=\"_blank\">episode</a> of the Tim Dillon Podcast last week, the comedian announced he'd been removed from the lineup for the comments he made about the country's record on slavery. (NPR reached out to Saudi's General Entertainment Authority for verification, but has not yet heard back.) \"I addressed it in a funny way and they fired me,\" Dillon said on his podcast. \"I certainly wasn't gonna show up in your country and insult the people that are paying me the money.\"</p>\n</div>"

The program, created in 2012 to protect children who arrived in the country illegally prior to 2007 from deportation, now benefits around half a million people. During the last few months, there have been reports of DACA recipients without criminal records being detained by federal immigration officials despite the protection the program offers from immigration enforcement.</p>   \n   <p>As Trump expands the reach of his mass deportation effort bolstered by record funding from Congress, immigration advocates and <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2025/09/03/g-s1-86764/daca-democrats-homeland-security\" target=\"_blank\">Democrats are raising concern</a> that those on DACA may get caught in the crosshairs. Nearly 20 DACA recipients have been detained by immigration officials this year, according to the <a href=\"https://homeishere.us/stop-abducting-immigrant-youth/\" target=\"_blank\">immigrant rights group Home is Here</a>. But Republican lawmakers open to a solution are still deferring to the executive branch to broker a deal.</p>   <p>\"I understand they are undocumented. I get it that they broke the law. I get it. But they're needed in the economy and someone gave them a job,\" said Rep. Maria Elvira Salazar, a Republican from Florida who earlier this year <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2025/04/09/nx-s1-5345741/the-politics-of-trump-deportations\" target=\"_blank\">introduced a bill</a> that would provide a pathway to legal status for DACA recipients and others. \"President Trump is a guy who gets things done and he can do it. And I am sure that he will come to the realization that this is what's good for America so we can make America greater.\"</p>   <p>Salazar's bill has <a href=\"https://www.congress.gov/bill/119th-congress/house-bill/4393/cosponsors\" target=\"_blank\">received bipartisan support</a>. But in interviews with Republican lawmakers who have previously supported a pathway to legal status for DACA recipients, nearly every lawmaker was clear: Trump needs to be the one to start talks.</p>   \n   <p>Trump spent the bulk of the campaign vowing to launch the largest deportation effort in American history. While he has occasionally voiced support for finding a policy solution for certain groups, like farmworkers and other migrant laborers, there has been little effort to do so.</p>   <p>\"The Trump Administration's top immigration enforcement priority is arresting and removing the dangerous violent, illegal criminal aliens that Joe Biden let flood across our Southern Border – of which there are many,\" said Abigail Jackson, a White House spokesperson. \"America is safer because of President Trump's immigration policies.\"</p>   \n   <h3><strong>The DACA coalition has weakened in Congress</strong></h3>   <p>In 2017, <a href=\"https://news.wttw.com/sites/default/files/article/file-attachments/2017-12-05-DACA_Letter_1.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">34 Republicans signed onto a letter</a> urging then-House Speaker Paul Ryan to pass a permanent fix for DACA after Trump attempted to rescind the program, arguing that \"reaching across the aisle to protect DACA recipients…is the right thing to do.\"</p>   <p>But strategists and immigration advocates said that the coalition of Republicans supporting DACA has shrunk over the years, as has the sense of urgency to find a solution after Trump's <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2020/06/18/829858289/supreme-court-upholds-daca-in-blow-to-trump-administration\" target=\"_blank\">first attempt to repeal the program failed</a>. Of those 34 Republicans who signed that letter, only eight are still voting members in the House.</p>   <p>\"Allowing DACA to go forward became a political hot potato for the Republicans,\" said Muzaffar Chishti, senior fellow at the nonpartisan Migration Policy Institute. \"Congress always tries to kick the can down the street.\"</p>   \n   <p>During his first network interview after winning the election, Trump <a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/donald-trump/trump-interview-meet-press-kristen-welker-election-president-rcna182857\" target=\"_blank\">said he would be open to negotiating a deal for DACA</a> with Democrats. More recently, border czar Tom Homan told reporters at the White House that \"<a href=\"https://rollcall.com/factbase/trump/transcript/donald-trump-press-briefing-tom-homan-the-white-house-august-6-2025/\" target=\"_blank\">no one is prioritizing DACA</a>\" for enforcement.</p>   <p>On the Hill, strategists said that this early in the administration's tenure, it may be a tall order to envision the cabinet's immigration enforcement leaders at the negotiating table with the Capitol Hill Democrats that would be needed to see a Congressional fix through.</p>   <p>\"The Trump administration's position is that the only thing that is important on immigration is shutting the border. Almost everything [else] to this administration looks secondary,\" Chishti said. \"As long as that doesn't change as a signal from President Trump, I don't think we're going to see much movement from Republicans in the House or the Senate.\"</p>   <h3><strong>House holds out hope on a bipartisan deal</strong></h3>   <p>Attempts to work across the aisle can be seen scattered throughout the chamber. The strongest effort is seemingly from Rep. Salazar.</p>   \n   <p>\"I have no doubt that we have started a national conversation as to what are we going to do with those people, including the DACA kids, who have roots in the country, who have children, who have been working, paying taxes and do not have a criminal record,\" Elvira Salazar told NPR in an interview. \"That is the national conversation that we need to sit down on the table and specifically the GOP, my party and my president. We can definitely solve it.\"</p>   <p>Rep. Brian Fitzpatrick, R-Penn., said his support for DACA has not wavered. A member of the Problem Solvers Caucus, he was joined by fellow caucus <a href=\"https://problemsolverscaucus.house.gov/media/press-releases/icymi-problem-solvers-caucus-members-hold-press-conference-after-returning-from-bipartisan-trip-to-us-mexico-border\" target=\"_blank\">members earlier this month</a> to announce the group would provide a framework to hopefully kickstart negotiations on legislation that could include providing a solution to those who have been here for decades.</p>   <p>\"I look in America and look [at] how immigrants built this country,\" he said. \"So it's really a question for my colleagues as to whether they view America that way.\"</p>   \n   <p>Separately, earlier this year the<a href=\"https://problemsolverscaucus.house.gov/media/press-releases/problem-solvers-caucus-co-chairs-request-meeting-with-president-trump-on-key-bipartisan-priorities\" target=\"_blank\"> caucus sent a letter to the White House</a> requesting a meeting to discuss a bipartisan compromise on immigration. For now, the goal is to come up with a general framework.</p>   <p>Still, there needs to be a strong directive from Trump in order to get the process moving, reiterated Todd Schulte, president of <a href=\"http://fwd.us/\" target=\"_blank\">FWD.us</a>, an immigration advocacy organization.</p>   <p>\"The political reality here is he could snap his fingers and tomorrow we'll have an intelligent conversation,\" Schulte said.</p>   <p>Still, any measure also needs bipartisan support in the Senate where enthusiasm is low.</p>   <p>Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., cosponsored the Dream Act in 2024, which would provide a pathway to legal status for people brought to the U.S. illegally as children. Speaking at the Capitol with NPR, Graham said he didn't see any of the current efforts making much headway while the priority stays on enforcement.</p>   \n   <p>\"If you start legalizing anybody now, that's just another magnet. So I want to turn off the magnets before we do anything,\" Graham said.</p>   <p>Sen. Thom Tillis, R-N.C., who introduced measures to provide some pathway to <a href=\"https://www.judiciary.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/Secure%20and%20Succeed%20Act%20of%202018%20-%20%20One-Page%20Summary.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">legalization for DACA</a>, said he doesn't see movement before the new year.</p>   <p>\"I hope the president goes back to what he said in his first term – he thinks there's room for legal immigration and more people immigrating legally here,\" Tillis said.</p>   <p>Sen. John Cornyn, who, in <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I5vOxJsnZOM\" target=\"_blank\">the past spoke strongly </a>about the need to provide a pathway for DACA recipients, said he believes there are others ahead of DACA recipients in terms of the administration's immigration priorities.</p>   <p>\"These young people who've now grown to be adults have found themselves in a very bad situation but don't see any prospects for immigration bills, including for them, any time soon,\" Cornyn said. \"Thankfully, the border has settled down, but we still have a lot of people in the country who are under final orders of deportation shouldn't be here. And I think at some point, hopefully, we can have that conversation. But I don't think any time soon.\"</p>\n</div>"

The official said it's likely that National Guard troops would be used.</p>   <p>In a statement later sent to NPR, chief Pentagon spokesman Sean Parnell said department chief Hegseth will address his senior military leaders early next week.</p>   <p>\"We stand ready to mobilize U.S. military personnel in support of DHS operations in Portland at the President's direction,\" Parnell said, and that the department will provide information as it becomes available.</p>   <p>Earlier this week, in comments made in the Oval Office, Trump teased a plan involving Portland, accusing activists there of being paid \"professional agitators\" and anarchists.</p>   \n   <p>\"We're going to get out there and do a big number on those people in Portland,\" he said.</p>   <p>Oregon Sen.

I ask Oregonians to stay calm and enjoy a beautiful fall day.\"</p>   <p>Portland's Democratic mayor, Keith Wilson, said the deployment of troops to the city would be unnecessary and that it's a power play on the part of the White House.</p>   <p>\"The number of necessary troops is zero, in Portland and any other American city,\" Wilson said in a <a href=\"https://www.portland.gov/mayor/keith-wilson/news/2025/9/27/mayor-wilson-responds-presidents-threat-send-troops-portland\" target=\"_blank\">statement</a>.</p>   \n   <p>If Trump does issue National Guard troops to Oregon's most populous city, he would be continuing a streak of broken political norms that has dominated both of his terms in the White House.</p>   <p>Prior to this year, a president hadn't exerted his power to go over a governor's head to call on the National Guard without their request <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2025/08/21/g-s1-83915/national-guard-dc-deployed\" target=\"_blank\">since 1965</a>.

    "body": "<div>\n      <p>NPR's Ayesha Rascoe talks with Senator Andy Kim, a New Jersey Democrat, about his party's strategy heading into a possible government shutdown.</p>   \n</div><div>\n    <p>AYESHA RASCOE, HOST: </p><p> President Donald Trump will meet tomorrow with top congressional leaders from both parties. The White House meeting comes just one day before a deadline to approve legislation to avoid a government shutdown. For the latest on the negotiations and what it means for civil services, we're joined now by Senator Andy Kim. He's a Democrat representing New Jersey. Good morning, Senator.</p><p>ANDY KIM: Good morning.</p><p>RASCOE: Senate leaders John Thune and Chuck Schumer and House leaders Mike Johnson and Hakeem Jeffries will meet with President Trump tomorrow. What do you expect to come out of that meeting?</p><p>KIM: Well, I'm glad this meeting is happening, and I'm glad that President Trump changed his mind. I think it shows that the president is feeling pressure from his position before saying that he doesn't want to deal with Democrats, doesn't want to negotiate. And I think that's because the American people are feeling a lot of pain right now. You know, I'm here in New Jersey, going around my state. People here have been telling me overwhelmingly about just the continued challenges that they're facing in terms of cost of living, health care and housing, and they want relief, and they don't see that from Donald Trump right now.</p><p>RASCOE: What is the party's strategy - your party's strategy - going into these negotiations?</p><p>KIM: Well, the negotiations are about addressing these exact needs from the American people. You know, they're terrified about their health care costs. Starting October 1, we're going to see health care costs increase dramatically for so many Americans, and we want to make sure that that is addressed by this president, by this Republican administration that has done so much to be able to hurt them by gutting Medicaid and so many other issues. So we're going to be fighting to be able to lower those costs for Americans and help them be able to address the needs in their families.</p><p>RASCOE: If Republicans are unwilling, as they have said, to roll back some of those changes that came from the spending bill that was passed earlier this year, that's going to affect Medicaid, that's going to affect medical insurance, should Democrats hold out for a shutdown?</p><p>KIM: Well, look, you know, we'll see how the negotiations go tomorrow in terms of what Trump is willing to move on because we know that, you know, Speaker Johnson and congressional Republicans, they're just doing whatever Trump is saying. So, you know, go in, be able to talk to Donald Trump and see how much this pressure is coming down on him. You know, he is somebody that has said in the past that if a shutdown happens, that it's the president's fault. So we'll see how far he's willing to go. But what we need to make sure we're addressing here are the just high costs that people are facing. And just what I hear from people is just - they just use the word chaos, and they use the word exhausted. You know, they are exhausted by Donald Trump, and they don't see this chaos as helping them. In fact, it's making things more unpredictable in their lives.</p><p>RASCOE: But if there is a shutdown, that would be chaotic, too, right? The Trump administration has threatened mass firings across the government if there's a shutdown. What would you say to those who will blame Democrats for that?</p><p>KIM: Well, no, I don't think they're going to blame Democrats because, I mean, look, even Donald Trump said, you know, it's the president's job to pull people together. You know, look, they see it as him unwilling to govern. Right now, we're seeing a situation where Donald Trump is literally trying to take down and dismantle the other two branches of government. You know, it doesn't want to be able to do what we normally need to do in terms of being able to negotiate. And the American people are seeing that. They're seeing that he is the focal point, the cause of this chaos in their lives.</p><p>RASCOE: Is there any plan for what would happen if the shutdown happens and more federal workers are let go? Is there a message that Democrats have? Is there a plan, you know, to try to support people who are losing their jobs?</p><p>KIM: Oh, absolutely. I mean, we've been fighting all along to be able to support federal workers. I used to be a federal civil servant under both Republicans and Democratic presidents. I served through multiple shutdowns. I didn't get a paycheck, despite working. I know how difficult this is, and I don't want to see this. But what we also see is just a blatant lawlessness from Donald Trump right now. And when they're threatening to fire federal employees, it comes across as just, like, you know, straight up, you know, mafia, straight up, just like, you know, we're going to do whatever we want to do. And people don't want that. So, you know, I think it's going to backfire immensely on Donald Trump if he leads us down that path.</p><p>RASCOE: Should Americans be worried about essential services like weather forecasting and federal emergency response if there's a shutdown?</p><p>KIM: You know, having been through this multiple times, you know, we know some of the things that we're going to have to worry about, and that's what we're trying to close the gap on. You know, we want to be able to make sure that, you know, this is something that if a shutdown happens, if Donald Trump causes a shutdown, that we're going to try to minimize the damages and the challenges facing the American people. So, yes, that's part of the negotiations. You know, we're going to try to do our best to minimize it if it gets to that. I hope we avoid it. You know, I hope Donald Trump comes to these negotiations, willing to be able to address some of these needs that the American people are facing and show that, yes, you know, we need to make sure we come together at this time.</p><p>RASCOE: That's Senator Andy Kim of New Jersey.

Security Council, meaning China and Russia could not stop it alone, as they have other proposed actions against Tehran in the past. Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov called them a \"trap\" for Iran on Saturday.</p>   \n   <p>France, Germany and the United Kingdom triggered snapback over Iran 30 days ago for its further restricting monitoring of its nuclear program and the deadlock over its negotiations with the U.S.</p>   <p>Iran further withdrew from the International Atomic Energy Agency monitoring after Israel's war with the country in June, which also saw the U.S. strike nuclear sites in the Islamic Republic. Meanwhile, the country still maintains a stockpile of uranium enriched up to 60% purity — a short, technical step away from weapons-grade levels of 90% — that is largely enough to make several atomic bombs, should Tehran choose to rush toward weaponization.</p>   \n   <p>Iran has long insisted its nuclear program is peaceful, though the West and IAEA say Tehran had an organized weapons program up until 2003.</p>   \n   <p>The three European nations on Sunday said they \"continuously made every effort to avoid triggering snapback.\" But Iran \"has not authorized IAEA inspectors to regain access to Iran's nuclear sites, nor has it produced and transmitted to the IAEA a report accounting for its stockpile of high-enriched uranium.\"</p>   <p>Tehran has further argued that the three European nations shouldn't be allowed to implement snapback, pointing in part to America's unilateral withdrawal from the accord in 2018, during the first term of President Donald Trump's administration.</p>   <p>U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio praised the three European nations for \"an act of decisive global leadership\" for imposing the sanctions on Iran and said \"diplomacy is still an option.\"</p>   <p>\"For that to happen, Iran must accept direct talks,\" Rubio said.</p>   <p>However, it remains unclear how Tehran will respond Sunday.</p>   <p>\"The Trump administration appears to think it has a stronger hand post-strikes, and it can wait for Iran to come back to the table,\" said Kelsey Davenport, a nuclear expert at the Washington-based Arms Control Association. \"Given the knowledge Iran has, given the materials that remain in Iran, that's a very dangerous assumption.\"</p>   <p>Risks also remain for Iran as well, she added: \"In the short term, kicking out the IAEA increases the risk of miscalculation. The U.S. or Israel could use the lack of inspections as a pretext for further strikes.\"</p>   <h3>Hunger and anxiety grow in Iran</h3>   <p>The aftermath of the June war drove up food prices in Iran, putting already expensive meat out of reach for poorer families.</p>   <div>\n            <div>\n        <picture>\n            <source srcset=\"https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/7655x5104+0+0/resize/400/quality/85/format/webp/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F96%2F43%2F160c896c4c69ae9cc1cf85faa2b1%2Fap25270427625732.jpg 400w, https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/7655x5104+0+0/resize/600/quality/85/format/webp/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F96%2F43%2F160c896c4c69ae9cc1cf85faa2b1%2Fap25270427625732.jpg 600w, https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/7655x5104+0+0/resize/800/quality/85/format/webp/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F96%2F43%2F160c896c4c69ae9cc1cf85faa2b1%2Fap25270427625732.jpg 800w, https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/7655x5104+0+0/resize/900/quality/85/format/webp/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F96%2F43%2F160c896c4c69ae9cc1cf85faa2b1%2Fap25270427625732.jpg 900w, https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/7655x5104+0+0/resize/1200/quality/85/format/webp/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F96%2F43%2F160c896c4c69ae9cc1cf85faa2b1%2Fap25270427625732.jpg 1200w, https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/7655x5104+0+0/resize/1600/quality/85/format/webp/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F96%2F43%2F160c896c4c69ae9cc1cf85faa2b1%2Fap25270427625732.jpg 1600w, https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/7655x5104+0+0/resize/1800/quality/85/format/webp/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F96%2F43%2F160c896c4c69ae9cc1cf85faa2b1%2Fap25270427625732.jpg 1800w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1025px) 650px, calc(100vw - 30px)\" type=\"image/webp\"></source>\n            <source srcset=\"https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/7655x5104+0+0/resize/400/quality/85/format/jpeg/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F96%2F43%2F160c896c4c69ae9cc1cf85faa2b1%2Fap25270427625732.jpg 400w, https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/7655x5104+0+0/resize/600/quality/85/format/jpeg/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F96%2F43%2F160c896c4c69ae9cc1cf85faa2b1%2Fap25270427625732.jpg 600w, https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/7655x5104+0+0/resize/800/quality/85/format/jpeg/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F96%2F43%2F160c896c4c69ae9cc1cf85faa2b1%2Fap25270427625732.jpg 800w, https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/7655x5104+0+0/resize/900/quality/85/format/jpeg/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F96%2F43%2F160c896c4c69ae9cc1cf85faa2b1%2Fap25270427625732.jpg 900w, https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/7655x5104+0+0/resize/1200/quality/85/format/jpeg/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F96%2F43%2F160c896c4c69ae9cc1cf85faa2b1%2Fap25270427625732.jpg 1200w, https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/7655x5104+0+0/resize/1600/quality/85/format/jpeg/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F96%2F43%2F160c896c4c69ae9cc1cf85faa2b1%2Fap25270427625732.jpg 1600w, https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/7655x5104+0+0/resize/1800/quality/85/format/jpeg/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F96%2F43%2F160c896c4c69ae9cc1cf85faa2b1%2Fap25270427625732.jpg 1800w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1025px) 650px, calc(100vw - 30px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\"></source>\n            <img src=\"https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/7655x5104+0+0/resize/1100/quality/50/format/jpeg/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F96%2F43%2F160c896c4c69ae9cc1cf85faa2b1%2Fap25270427625732.jpg\" alt=\"Two women walk past a huge banner showing the late commander of the Iran's Revolutionary Guard expeditionary Quds Force, Gen.

    "body": "<div>\n      <p>In our roundup of domestic political news: an announced troop deployment to Portland, Oregon, the latest efforts to halt a government shutdown, and the indictment of a prominent Trump critic.</p>   \n</div><div>\n    <p>AYESHA RASCOE, HOST: </p><p> There's so much happening in U.S. politics right now - President Trump has announced he will send troops to Portland, Oregon, to handle, quote, \"domestic terrorists,\" a government shutdown could come Wednesday and the Trump administration is threatening large-scale layoffs of federal workers if that happens. And one of Trump's most vocal critics, former FBI Director James Comey, has been indicted by the Justice Department. Comey said in a video message that he's innocent.</p><p>(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)</p><p>JAMES COMEY: My family and I have known for years that there are costs to standing up to Donald Trump. But we couldn't imagine ourselves living any other way. We will not live on our knees, and you shouldn't either.</p><p>RASCOE: And that's just some of what's going on. Joining me now is NPR senior national political correspondent Mara Liasson. Hi, Mara.</p><p>MARA LIASSON, BYLINE: Hi there.</p><p>RASCOE: What's the latest about that intended troop deployment to Portland?</p><p>LIASSON: Well, Trump posted that he is allowing the military to use, quote, \"full force if necessary.\" He said it's - they're being sent to Portland to protect, quote, \"war-ravaged Portland.\" It's not completely clear what they're going to do there, and the mayor says there's no need for troops. The city is doing just fine. But of course, this - he sent federal troops to other places like Washington, D.C., and LA and threatened to do it in Chicago. So yet another Democratic-controlled city getting the military from Trump.</p><p>RASCOE: OK. Well, let's talk about James Comey. He's charged with one count of making false statements and one count of obstruction of justice. And this is stemming from testimony he gave to Congress in 2020. His guilt or innocence aside, what's the significance of these charges?</p><p>LIASSON: The significance is that they came at the specific demand of the president. Legal experts say this is a tipping point, that Trump has now bulldozed through the post-Watergate reforms, all sorts of norms and rules that were put in place after the Watergate scandal to protect the Justice Department from political interference from the president. The reforms were meant to send a message to the American people that prosecutions would be based on evidence and facts, not on whether someone is the enemy of the president. But Donald Trump has a different view of the Department of Justice. He calls himself the chief law enforcement official of the country. On the campaign trail last year, he said he would use the Department of Justice to prosecute his enemies, and that's what he's doing.</p><p>RASCOE: Comey, in his video after the indictment, said, let's have a trial. So how strong is a case against him?</p><p>LIASSON: Legal experts say the case is weak. The former U.S. attorney for the Eastern District of Virginia wouldn't file it. Trump then fired him and appointed a lawyer named Lindsey Halligan as the acting U.S. attorney. She's never prosecuted a case before. But convicting Comey isn't necessarily the goal here. Legal experts say the goal really is to send a message to all of Trump's opponents that he can bankrupt them, ruin their reputation and cost them their careers. So domination is really the point.</p><p>RASCOE: Friday afternoon, the president was asked who's next on his list, and he denied having a list, but he did post some names last week on social media - not just Comey, but California Senator Adam Schiff and New York Attorney General Letitia James.</p><p>LIASSON: That's right. The president said this isn't revenge, but when he described why he was doing it, it sounded a lot like revenge. Here's what he said.</p><p>(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)</p><p>PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Well, that's what they tried to do, right? They did it with me. For four years, they went after me. They went after me for four years.</p><p>LIASSON: He also signed an executive order designating antifa as a terrorist organization and telling the government to go after other domestic terrorists. He has suggested that billionaire philanthropist George Soros could be investigated, in addition to other progressive groups and organizations like the Ford Foundation. The New York Times is reporting that the Department of Justice has issued a subpoena for Fani Willis. She's the Fulton County, Georgia, district attorney who charged Trump with trying to overturn the 2020 election, and this comes after Trump has gone after other institutions and organizations that he sees as his adversaries - law firms, universities, media organizations. His top official, Stephen Miller, in the White House, has called the Democratic Party a domestic extremist organization. So this is very wide-ranging.</p><p>RASCOE: I want to talk to you about - you know, keeping the government funded, possible shutdown. What's happening in regards with those efforts to avoid a government shutdown and keep the government funded past Tuesday?</p><p>LIASSON: Well, top leaders of Congress are going to the White House tomorrow. The big four congressional leaders - Senate Majority Leader Thune, Senate Minority Leader Schumer, House Speaker Johnson and House Minority Leader Jeffries - they're all going to be talking about a shutdown, but they don't have a lot of time. There's a September 30 deadline to approve legislation or face a partial government shutdown. Democrats say they won't vote for a funding bill unless Obamacare subsidies, which allow millions of people to buy health insurance, are extended.</p><p>RASCOE: That's NPR senior national political correspondent Mara Liasson.

    "body": "<div>\n      <p>We examine the indictment of former FBI Director James Comey after President Trump called for several of his political enemies — including Comey — to be prosecuted.</p>   \n</div><div>\n    <p>SCOTT SIMON, HOST: </p><p> Justice, as in the U.S. Justice Department, can move swiftly. A week ago today, President Trump publicly called on the DOJ to prosecute his perceived political enemies, including the former FBI director James Comey. On Thursday, prosecutors followed through and secured a criminal indictment against James Comey for false statements and obstruction. NPR Justice correspondent Ryan Lucas joins us. Ryan, thanks so much for being with us.</p><p>RYAN LUCAS, BYLINE: Thanks for having me, Scott.</p><p>SIMON: What does the indictment allege?</p><p>LUCAS: Well, look, it's very much a bare-bones indictment. It's just a page and a half long, but it contains the two counts you mentioned - one for false statements, the other for obstruction of a congressional proceeding. Now, these charges stem from testimony that Comey gave to the Senate Judiciary Committee in September of 2020, so about five years ago. That hearing revolved around the FBI's investigation into Russia's interference in the 2016 election. The indictment says that Comey lied by denying that he had authorized someone at the FBI to leak information. That appears to be a reference to an exchange at that hearing between Comey and Texas Republican Ted Cruz. Cruz asked Comey whether he had authorized someone at the FBI to be an anonymous source in news reports. Comey gave only a brief reply. He told Cruz that he stood by the answer that he had given back in 2017, which was that he had not authorized any such leak.</p><p>SIMON: And what do you think we should make of the timing of this indictment, given what the president had said just a week ago?</p><p>LUCAS: I think the timing is a really important aspect here. You mentioned the demand the president made one week ago today, in essence instructing Attorney General Pam Bondi by name to investigate specific people he doesn't like. Trump named three people in that post to be prosecuted -  New York Attorney General Letitia James, California Democratic Senator Adam Schiff and James Comey.</p><p>Now, the case against Comey was being handled by the U.S. attorney's office in the Eastern District of Virginia. Last week, Trump pushed out the top federal prosecutor there, in part because that prosecutor had expressed doubts about the strength of the case against Comey. Trump then installed Lindsey Halligan to replace him. Halligan has no prosecutorial experience, but she did once serve as a personal attorney for Trump, and she had been working in the White House. Halligan then pushed through the indictment against Comey over the objections of career prosecutors in the U.S. attorney's office there, who also had concerns about the strength of the evidence in this case.</p><p>SIMON: Now that James Comey's been indicted, what did the president have to say?</p><p>LUCAS: Well, Trump was asked about it yesterday when he was leaving the White House. He was asked who would be next on his list of retribution. You can hear the helicopter in the background here, but here's a bit of what he said.</p><p>(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)</p><p>PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: It's not a list, but I think there'll be others. I mean, they're corrupt. These were corrupt, radical-left Democrats. 'Cause Comey essentially was a - he's worse than a Democrat.</p><p>LUCAS: Now, Trump has insulted Comey for years. He did it again yesterday. He called him a dirty cop. Now, after the indictment was made public, Comey also put out a video on Instagram. Here's a bit of what he said.</p><p>(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)</p><p>JAMES COMEY: My family and I have known for years that there are costs to standing up to Donald Trump, but we couldn't imagine ourselves living any other way. We will not live on our knees, and you shouldn't either.</p><p>LUCAS: Comey also declared his innocence, said he has confidence in the federal judicial system. And he said, let's have a trial.</p><p>SIMON: Finally, does this signal anything for the second Trump term?</p><p>LUCAS: Well, look, traditionally, the Justice Department has enjoyed independence from the White House, particularly when it comes to investigations and prosecutions, because you want to be sure that prosecutions and investigations aren't driven by and don't appear to be driven by politics. Here in just the past week, we have the president openly calling for the attorney general to go after people Trump doesn't like, including James Comey. Now Comey's been indicted. So for legal observers and Justice Department veterans, this sure looks like Trump using the Justice Department to enact the campaign of retribution that he promised.</p><p>SIMON: NPR's Ryan Lucas.
