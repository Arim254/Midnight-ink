But Martin and others in the party view it as a win because the Democratic candidate, Debra Shigley, improved the party's margin by double digits from November.</p>   \n   <p>For their part, Republicans aren't concerned. Georgia Republican Party Chairman Josh McKoon said in a statement that Republicans \"cut through the noise\" with a coordinated investment in digital and social media messages to get out the vote.</p>   <p>Still, in an interview with NPR before this week's elections, Martin said the Democratic Party is energized and voters are expressing enthusiasm after the party's defeat in November that saw them lose the White House and control of the Senate.</p>   <p>That enthusiasm has carried over to the ballot box: in about 40 special elections since President Trump was elected last November, <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1JGk1r1VXnxBrAIVHz1C5HTB5jxCO6Zw4QNPivdhyWHw/edit?usp=sharing\" target=\"_blank\">Democrats have overperformed their prior margins by an average of about 15%</a>.</p>   <p>Martin said some of that bump is because of Trump, and voters seeing a difference between his campaign promises and his governing. He points to polling that shows Republicans losing ground with different groups who notably supported the president last year, like independents, young people and Hispanic Americans.</p>   <p>\"The important thing to remember is midterm elections are not a referendum on a party that's not in power,\" Martin said. \"So our numbers really don't matter here. Donald Trump is at an all-time low in terms of his favorability and his approval numbers… the Republican Party is as well.\"</p>   \n   <p>But the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.npr.org/2025/07/31/nx-s1-5484137/democrats-approval-unpopular-buttigieg-podcasts-2026-midterms\">numbers aren't great for the Democratic Party either</a>, and opposition to Trump does not inherently mean voters like what Democrats are selling.</p>   <p>Voters have historically negative views about Congressional Democrats and the overall brand of the party, according to recent polls, and that dissatisfaction also comes from a notable share of self-identified Democrats.</p>   <p>Martin was elected chair of the DNC in February by party insiders after 14 years leading Minnesota's Democratic-Farmer-Labor party — a time when the party never lost a statewide race, he notes — and says they are working on changing those negative perceptions.</p>   \n   <p>\"We can walk and chew gum at the same time,\" he said. \"We can both resist Donald Trump while also giving people a sense of what we're fighting for and how their lives should improve with Democrats back in power.\"</p>   <p>As for those within the party who say Democrats aren't doing enough to win elections or to push back against Trump policies they don't like, Martin has a blunt response:</p>   <p>\"Stop bitching,\" he said. \"Stop complaining. Roll up your sleeves and get in the game.\"</p>   <p>More diplomatically, the chairman points out he's been to 32 states since taking over in February, the DNC has been organizing in more places earlier than normal and there's been investment in behind-the-scenes infrastructure that doesn't grab as many headlines.</p>   <p>\"And so, again, people ask what the DNC is doing? We're winning,\" he said. \"We've been winning since I've been chair. And we're going to continue to win because we're doing the things that help put us in a position to do that.\"</p>   <p>Still, one of Martin's go-to quips is that \"there's no brownie points when you come in second place,\" and that's the place that Democrats still find themselves in with little power in Washington.</p>\n</div>"

Some wore suits, others high heels, and nearly all carried small binders with resumes, certificates and diplomas.</p>   <p>They were veterans, current law enforcement officials, college graduates and fired federal workers.</p>   <p>They came from California, Texas, Georgia, Arkansas and Utah.</p>   <p>And they want to be deportation officers, or work for other parts of the Department of Homeland Security, the agency leading President Trump's mass deportation policy.</p>   <p>The Trump administration wants to recruit 10,000 people for Immigration and Customs Enforcement, a branch of DHS, using congressional funds approved this summer. The administration's goal is to deport 1 million people a year. But that target is unlikely to be easy to hit: The lack of personnel to conduct arrests, investigate and litigate cases has been among the biggest challenges to increasing the pace of arrests, detentions and deportations.</p>   \n   <p>NPR spoke with more than 30 people at the DHS career expo held in Provo last week. This was the first agencywide career fair after Congress approved funds to recruit candidates for positions beyond immigration enforcement, including for the Secret Service, Federal Protective Police and the Transportation Security Administration, which like ICE are all part of DHS. Interviews conducted by NPR suggest many of the people who had traveled across state lines to Utah wanted to work in immigration enforcement.</p>   <p>More than 1,500 people registered for the event, DHS Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin told NPR in a statement. DHS extended 500 tentative job offers, with 370 for ICE Enforcement and Removal Operations.</p>   <p>\"Many of the candidates who attended the expo had started the application process before attending and were completing things on their to-do list, such as drug tests, finger printing, and more,\" McLaughlin said. \"Attending the in-person career expo helped candidates expedite their hiring process with a one-stop shop to complete their applications.\"</p>   <p>ICE had <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2025/02/05/nx-s1-5259788/homeland-security-immigration-trump-workforce\" target=\"_blank\">about 20,000 people</a> at the start of the year, 6,000 of them in roles directly conducting deportations. Last week, <a href=\"https://www.dhs.gov/news/2025/09/16/ice-receives-more-150000-applications-join-ice-law-enforcement-help-remove-worst\" target=\"_blank\">ICE boasted receiving </a>more than 150,000 applications nationwide and extending 18,000 tentative job offers, though it is unclear how many will ultimately see a first day on the job.</p>   \n   <p>DHS officials have raised concerns over what they said is a 1,000% increase in threats to their officers. Officials reiterated that statistic after a <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2025/09/24/nx-s1-5552151/ice-dallas-detention-facility-shooting\" target=\"_blank\">fatal shooting at the Dallas ICE field</a> office this week killed one person and injured two others — all immigrants detained there — and bullets were found with the words \"ANTI-ICE.\"</p>   <p>Acting Director Todd Lyons <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2025/09/24/us/video/ice-director-dallas-shooting-cnc-digvid\" target=\"_blank\">told CNN after the shooting</a> that the threats have not negatively affected recruitment efforts.</p>   <p>\"There's really excitement for people that want to serve, not just necessarily ICE but want to serve in a federal law enforcement capacity, especially at a time when assaults and attacks on law enforcement are increasing,\" Lyons said. \"We are seeing a great uptick in our recruitment, so people definitely want to do the job.\"</p>   <h3>The recruits</h3>   <p>As part of its recruitment campaign, DHS offered signing bonuses, <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2025/08/07/nx-s1-5494724/ice-is-recruiting-federal-workers-offering-bonuses-to-hire-thousands-of-workers\" target=\"_blank\">lifted age restrictions</a> and roped in celebrities like <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2025/08/07/nx-s1-5495436/superman-tv-actor-dean-cain-joins-ice-recruit-immigration\" target=\"_blank\">actor Dean Cain, who played Clark Kent/Superman in <em>Lois and Clark</em></a>, to encourage more people to apply.</p>   <p>Ana Maria Vargas, 52, a correctional officer in Arizona, applied to be a deportation officer.</p>   \n   <p>\"I saw … the guy that played Superman on the TV series so many years ago,\" Vargas said. \"A lot of us still have the desire and want to serve our country, yet we don't know how to get into it because of the age restrictions.\"</p>   <p>Vargas said she wants to \"take out the bad guys,\" though she acknowledged \"there are a lot of good people that are here. However, they are here illegally.\"</p>   <p>Andrea Alexander, an attorney living in Utah, came to apply for the Office of the Principal Legal Advisor, the branch of ICE that argues immigration cases in immigration court. She learned of ICE's recruitment efforts from White House Deputy Chief of Staff Stephen Miller's social media.</p>   <p>\"I love Trump. I love his administration. I think he's going to save our country,\" Alexander said, adding that those applying to be deportation officers should likely believe in the mission as well. \"They probably have to be true believers for the front line because they have to be ready to catch a lot of flak right now.\"</p>   \n   <p>Still, Alexander said she wanted to see efforts to increase legal migration and visa reform.</p>   <p>\"We've made it almost impossible for people to immigrate legally. It's very difficult and they should be able to come over,\" she added.</p>   <p>Another applicant, Peter, who did not want to disclose his last name since he is applying to be a deportation officer, flew to Utah from Arkansas.</p>   <p>He said he was on the right of the political spectrum and that the hiring bonuses and increased media attention on the agency drew his attention.</p>   <p>\"I think there's way too many illegal immigrants here,\" he said, noting that if he gets the job, he hopes he gets to deport people. </p>   <h3>Former federal employees seek a second chance</h3>   <p>Sherrell Pyatt was one of several DHS employees laid off as part of a broader effort to reduce the size of the federal government. <a href=\"http://google.com/search?q=Sherrell+Pyatt+npr&rlz=1C1GCFQ_enUS1132US1132&oq=Sherrell+Pyatt+npr&gs_lcrp=EgZjaHJvbWUyBggAEEUYOTIKCAEQABiiBBiJBTIKCAIQABiiBBiJBTIHCAMQABjvBTIKCAQQABiABBiiBNIBCDIyMDVqMGo5qAIFsAIB8QUxiCo-BAwJwA&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8\" target=\"_blank\">NPR reported her story in April</a>. But months later, she flew from Georgia to Utah with the hopes of being rehired at the agency that let her go.</p>   <p><strong>\"</strong>I want to be judged on my qualifications, my credentials, and I don't feel like I've been given that opportunity,\" Pyatt said, noting that her severance had ended in August.</p>   <p>She wanted to apply for a role with the fraud investigations unit of U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services. After working in the federal government for 10 years, Pyatt said that she wants to continue her service and believes she should have priority to be rehired, since she was a part of a reduction in force, but is competing with external candidates.</p>   <div>\n            <div>\n        <picture>\n            <source srcset=\"https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/7659x5106+0+0/resize/400/quality/85/format/webp/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fcc%2F46%2F53f325de4fc593cd94600fa8b559%2Fgettyimages-2235696135.jpg 400w, https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/7659x5106+0+0/resize/600/quality/85/format/webp/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fcc%2F46%2F53f325de4fc593cd94600fa8b559%2Fgettyimages-2235696135.jpg 600w, https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/7659x5106+0+0/resize/800/quality/85/format/webp/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fcc%2F46%2F53f325de4fc593cd94600fa8b559%2Fgettyimages-2235696135.jpg 800w, https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/7659x5106+0+0/resize/900/quality/85/format/webp/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fcc%2F46%2F53f325de4fc593cd94600fa8b559%2Fgettyimages-2235696135.jpg 900w, https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/7659x5106+0+0/resize/1200/quality/85/format/webp/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fcc%2F46%2F53f325de4fc593cd94600fa8b559%2Fgettyimages-2235696135.jpg 1200w, https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/7659x5106+0+0/resize/1600/quality/85/format/webp/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fcc%2F46%2F53f325de4fc593cd94600fa8b559%2Fgettyimages-2235696135.jpg 1600w, https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/7659x5106+0+0/resize/1800/quality/85/format/webp/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fcc%2F46%2F53f325de4fc593cd94600fa8b559%2Fgettyimages-2235696135.jpg 1800w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1025px) 650px, calc(100vw -

So I firsthand see the benefits of it,\" he said.</p>   <h3>Concerns over DHS' widespread recruitment comes from all sides</h3>   <p>The numbers at the recruitment events notwithstanding, ICE's recruitment strategies have not all been well received.</p>   <p>Utah County Sheriff Mike Smith, who has an agreement to assist ICE in the Provo area, called an initial call to recruit local law enforcement \"unprofessional\" in an interview with NPR. The recruitment fair in Provo, as well as an <a href=\"https://www.texasstandard.org/stories/immigration-customs-enforcement-recruitment-event-ice-arlington-texas/\" target=\"_blank\">ICE-specific fair in Texas</a>, were met with scattered protests.</p>   <p>RJ Hauman, a visiting fellow at the conservative Heritage Foundation, said he supports the administration's immigration enforcement goals, but said he is skeptical about the recruitment campaign.</p>   \n   <p>\"When you're recruiting large numbers of qualified candidates, you got to consider how you get them to the finish line,\" Hauman said. \"Rather than doing ads that ICE is hiring, all these on-site job fairs, let's start hammering out more facilities to train these potential agents and streamline the vetting, the background check, make sure you get the right people and you don't make a mistake.\"</p>   <p>Critics say the modification of requirements, including a reduced training period, could result in hiring candidates with less experience. <a href=\"https://www.dhs.gov/news/2025/08/06/secretary-noem-unveils-no-age-limit-patriotic-americans-join-ice-law-enforcement\" target=\"_blank\">The agency</a> insists standards aren't being lowered: ICE law enforcement recruits will still be required to go through medical screening, drug screening and a physical fitness test. </p>   <h3>Just another job</h3>   <p>ICE's enforcement efforts have made the agency the focus of negative attention, protests and lawsuits. But like for many who work in the federal government, the politics of the moments are irrelevant.</p>   \n   <p>John Heubert, who expects to retire from the Army next summer, came from Georgia to apply to be a deportation officer.</p>   <p>\"I feel like I could do good in that realm. I've been military for 23 years. I've worked in detainee operations for a long time,\" Heubert said. \"So I feel like leveraging my skills, and deployments, and everything would help kind of transition me easier into the civilian life, doing kind of the same thing I've been doing.\"</p>   <p>He said everything has been politicized, so the controversy surrounding the agency did not deter him.</p>   <p>\"I'm the guy that just executes at this point. So whatever they want, they tell me to do it, I go do,\" Heubert said.</p>   <p>Alan Richardson, who came to the expo from Utah, is another veteran. He learned of the expo from a friend's post on LinkedIn.</p>   <p>\"I want to go back into federal service … and retire earlier than have to start a whole another career with a state or county agency,\" he said, noting he is interested in Border Patrol, Secret Service and ICE.</p>   <p>\"As a law enforcement officer, you don't get to pick and choose which laws to enforce. You enforce them as they are on the books,\" Heubert said. \"There is no politics behind it. If you want to change laws, you have to go to Congress. That's simply all it is.\"</p>   <p>Richardson said that he supports the effort to arrest and deport criminals.</p>   <p>\"If your employer says you have to do something, you've got to go do it. That's any business in the country. Everyone can have an opinion,\" Richardson said. \"But I think going after the criminals is the goal here. There's no way you're going to deport how many millions of people that are here illegally.\"</p>   <p>Eric Garibay, an immigration detention officer, said he drove over 12 hours from El Paso, Texas, to attend the fair. Speaking to NPR in Spanish, he said it has always been his goal to be a Border Patrol agent.</p>   \n   <p>\"It's a job and a career that I chose, so you have to move forward,\" he said.</p>   <p>As for the people he'd be detaining, he said: \"It hurts to see. They're human, but a job is a job.\"</p>\n</div>"

The move comes days after the top federal prosecutor in Northern Virginia cast doubt on the evidence, only to be forced out by the president and <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2025/09/21/nx-s1-5549086/trump-nominates-white-house-aide-top-us-prosecutor-probing-letitia-james\" target=\"_blank\">replaced with one of Trump's former defense attorneys</a>.</p>   \n   <p>\"No one is above the law,\" Attorney General Pam Bondi <a href=\"https://x.com/AGPamBondi/status/1971345371583611099\" target=\"_blank\">said in a post on X</a>. \"Today's indictment reflects this Department of Justice's commitment to holding those who abuse positions of power accountable for misleading the American people.\"</p>   <p>Comey posted <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/reel/DPC1sFFD2iF/?igsh=MXg0eDRiYXVoZjFjOA%3D%3D\" target=\"_blank\">a video message on Instagram</a> after the indictment.</p>   <p>\"My heart is broken for the Department of Justice, but I have great confidence in the federal judicial system, and I'm innocent. So let's have a trial,\" he said.</p>   <p>Trump has long railed against Comey, blaming the former FBI leader for the <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2017/05/17/528846598/former-fbi-director-mueller-appointed-special-counsel-to-oversee-russia-probe\" target=\"_blank\">appointment of a special prosecutor</a> who probed contacts between Russia and Trump's 2016 campaign through most of the president's first term in office. </p>   \n   <p>The charges against Comey mark the latest escalation in a years-long war of words between Trump and Comey, who famously likened the president to a mob boss.</p>   <p>This year the Secret Service interrogated the former FBI director after he posted a photo of seashells in <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2025/05/16/nx-s1-5400400/comey-trump-8647-investigation-instagram\" target=\"_blank\">the shape of the numbers \"86 47.\"</a> Comey later removed the post, saying he thought it was a restaurant-themed joke about removing Trump, the 47th president. But Trump's son and Cabinet members interpreted the message as an assassination threat. \"Eighty-six\" is a <a href=\"https://www.merriam-webster.com/wordplay/eighty-six-meaning-origin\" target=\"_blank\">slang term</a> that means \"get rid of,\" and Trump is the 47th (and 45th) president of the United States. </p>   \n   <p>Comey once served as second in command at the Justice Department, under President George W. Bush. But he started his career as a federal prosecutor, working to some acclaim in the same office in Virginia that later moved to seek his indictment.</p>   <p>DOJ fired his daughter, Maurene Comey, from a prominent job as an assistant U.S. attorney in Manhattan earlier this year, only hours after she said she had been asked to lead an important public corruption case. </p>   <p>This month, Maurene Comey sued current Justice Department leaders, arguing she was fired without cause and in violation of the Constitution and federal statutes. Her lawsuit said she thought she was dismissed because of \"her father's protected speech, or because of her perceived political affiliation and beliefs, or both.\"</p>\n</div>"

President Trump upped the stakes, threatening large-scale layoffs if Democrats don't provide the necessary votes.</p>   \n</div><div>\n    <p>STEVE INSKEEP, HOST: </p><p> We are four days away from a government shutdown.</p><p>A MARTÍNEZ, HOST: </p><p> And a memo from the White House promises to punish federal workers if that happens. The Trump administration is threatening large-scale layoffs if Democrats don't provide the necessary votes to avoid a shutdown. We don't know exactly which jobs would be targeted or how many federal workers could lose their jobs, but the deadline to come up with a solution is fast approaching.</p><p>INSKEEP: And NPR congressional correspondent Barbara Sprunt will be covering whatever happens. Barbara, good morning.</p><p>BARBARA SPRUNT, BYLINE: Hey. Good morning, Steve.</p><p>INSKEEP: OK. So this is kind of a departure from the normal shutdown scenario where the government says, we're going to increase the pain. What prompted this?</p><p>SPRUNT: Well, there's a line in the memo that I think is telling here, essentially saying, we're hopeful that Democrats in Congress don't trigger a shutdown, and then this won't be necessary. So I think this is partly aimed at making any funding lapse as difficult as possible for Democrats.</p><p>INSKEEP: Got it.</p><p>SPRUNT: Normally in a shutdown, you know, agencies furlough federal workers temporarily until a deal is brokered and a stopgap funding bill is passed. This is next-level. It's instructing agencies to look for workers to fire permanently, people whose work is not consistent with the president's priorities.</p><p>INSKEEP: How are Democrats responding?</p><p>SPRUNT: Well, they view it as an intimidation tactic to get them to accept the continuing resolution that House Republicans passed that would fund the government through November 21. I spoke with Maryland Senator Chris Van Hollen, a Democrat, about this yesterday. Here's what he had to say.</p><p>CHRIS VAN HOLLEN: This is nothing less than Mafia-style blackmail. Essentially, the president is threatening to fire dedicated federal employees who have nothing to do with the ongoing political and policy dispute.</p><p>SPRUNT: Meanwhile, Senate minority leader Chuck Schumer says that if these firings do go forward, he suspects they'll eventually be overturned in court.</p><p>INSKEEP: Although we've learned when the president fires someone, even if a court finds illegality, it's difficult to reverse the firing, so we'll see. Is anybody talking about getting a deal out of this?</p><p>SPRUNT: Well, top congressional Democrats were supposed to meet with President Trump yesterday at the White House, but the president canceled that meeting, saying it would be pointless to meet because Democrats, in his view, are making unreasonable demands.</p><p>INSKEEP: Which are what?</p><p>SPRUNT: Well, Democrats want to roll back some Medicaid changes that were part of the big tax and spending bill that the president signed earlier this summer, and they want to extend tax credits from the Affordable Care Act that are set to expire at the end of the year. House Democratic leader Hakeem Jeffries has said a verbal agreement that comes in any sort of negotiation isn't enough. Democrats want to address these issues in written legislation. Here he is yesterday.</p><p>(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)</p><p>HAKEEM JEFFRIES: We're able to sit down any time, any place with anyone, not hard to find. I'm here in the Capitol, willing to go to the White House at any time in order to have that conversation.</p><p>SPRUNT: But, you know, Steve, yes, this is about the shutdown. It's a very real possibility, and it would have very real consequences for people who rely on certain services and workers who might find themselves without a job permanently. But this is also about an ongoing conflict between the White House and Democrats in Congress who feel the administration has continued to overreach in its authority and diminish the legislative branch's power of the purse. So yes, this memo is unprecedented, but it also very much follows the administration's philosophy that we've seen play out again and again this year.</p><p>INSKEEP: Well, Barbara, I hope you're ready for a busy few days here.</p><p>SPRUNT: Looking forward to it. Thanks, Steve.</p><p>INSKEEP: NPR congressional correspondent Barbara Sprunt.</p>\n    <p>Copyright © 2025 NPR.  All rights reserved.

    "body": "<div>\n      <p>If the government shuts down next week, the White House said it will look for ways to permanently eliminate some federal workers, rather than just temporarily send them home on unpaid leave.</p>   \n</div><div>\n    <p>AILSA CHANG, HOST: </p><p> Well, the federal government is set to run out of funding in just five days. And with no deal on the horizon, the White House is instructing agencies to look for people to fire permanently if a temporary shutdown does occur. It is an unprecedented escalation in the standoff between Republicans and Democrats on federal spending. And joining us now to talk through all of this is NPR senior White House correspondent Tamara Keith and NPR congressional correspondent Barbara Sprunt. Hello to both of you.</p><p>TAMARA KEITH, BYLINE: Hello.</p><p>BARBARA SPRUNT, BYLINE: Hi.</p><p>CHANG: All right, Tam, let's start with you. I mean, this proposal, if I'm not mistaken, is a major departure from what's historically happened to federal workers in the event of a shutdown, right? Like, we're usually talking about furloughs and such. Where is this threat coming from?</p><p>KEITH: Yeah. The White House budget office sent a letter to agency heads saying that a funding lapse would give the administration a chance to further cut the federal workforce, and it urged them to draw up plans for firing people who work on programs that are not consistent with the president's priorities. It also included the line, we remain hopeful that Democrats in Congress will not trigger a shutdown and the steps outlined above will not be necessary.</p><p>CHANG: OK. Well, as we said, it's T minus five days to a shutdown. Barbara, remind us where things do stand on negotiations at the moment.</p><p>SPRUNT: Well, House Republicans passed a bill that would fund the government at current levels through November 21, but it hasn't passed the Senate because Democrats are holding out for changes in health care spending. Democratic leaders were on track to sit down with the president today to talk about all this, but President Trump canceled the meeting.</p><p>KEITH: Yeah, he said it would be pointless because Democrats are making unreasonable demands. And then he blamed a potential shutdown on Democrats. So the usual back-and-forth, closed-door negotiations, shuttle diplomacy with the Hill that would normally be happening this close to a shutdown just isn't happening.</p><p>SPRUNT: Yeah, that's for sure. And top Democrats keep saying that they're ready to meet. You know, they want to discuss this, but they want more than a verbal agreement in the negotiations. They want their demands in written legislation. And if we're reading the tea leaves about Congress itself, I think it's telling that Speaker Mike Johnson isn't planning on bringing the House back into session until after this shutdown would begin.</p><p>CHANG: Yeah, that is a clue. I mean - OK, so Tam, let's just play this out a bit. Can the White House use a government shutdown to push through mass layoffs as they're describing they're going to do?</p><p>KEITH: Well, I called up Shalanda Young. She has been through many budget battles as a high-level congressional staffer and then as budget director in the Biden administration. And that's one of the questions I asked her.</p><p>SHALANDA YOUNG: A shutdown doesn't give OMB or White House any further authority to let federal workers go or do mass firings. So this is, at best, a negotiating tactic; at worst, a cover to do what you were going to do anyway, which is fire a bunch of federal workers.</p><p>KEITH: She expects that if a funding lapse were to happen and if the administration moved forward with this plan, there would be lawsuits challenging the legality of the moves, which would end up winding their way slowly through the courts like so many other challenges to Trump administration actions that are already being litigated. But she said significant damage to the government can be done in the meantime, and that would be hard to reverse.</p><p>One more thing to note, though, so far, all we have is this budget office memo or letter instructing agencies to plan for layoffs. We don't yet have those specific agency plans, so we don't know which jobs would be targeted for elimination or how many.</p><p>CHANG: That's - I mean, in many ways, wouldn't you say that all of this tracks with the basic philosophy of the Trump administration when it comes to its approach to cutting government programs?</p><p>KEITH: Very much so. This is on brand. So far this year, the Partnership for Public Service says more than 200,000 people have been pushed out of the federal workforce, with more cuts planned even before this potential shutdown move. And the White House has made no secret of its desire to have more power over how the government spends its money, regardless of what Congress passes.</p><p>CHANG: OK. Well, Barbara, leaving Pennsylvania Avenue for a moment and turning to Capitol Hill, is it fair to say some people in Congress disagree with this approach?</p><p>SPRUNT: Oh, I'd say so...</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>SPRUNT: ...Particularly the Democrats. You know, this is not only about the shutdown. I think it speaks to a larger, ongoing conflict between the White House and Congress. The White House has already rescinded funds that Congress appropriated. And, you know, lawmakers are generally pretty protective of that power of the purse. This is part of the reason that Democratic lawmakers say it's hard to make a deal with Republicans when it comes to funding issues, because they feel that Republicans in Congress have ceded that authority to the president.</p><p>CHANG: Well, tell us more about what Democrats are asking for specifically here.</p><p>SPRUNT: So Democrats want to roll back some Medicaid changes that were part of the president's tax and spending bill that he passed - or he signed earlier this summer, and they want to extend tax credits that are part of the Affordable Care Act. Those expire at the end of the year. And, of course, now they're also concerned about this OMB memo and potential firings of their constituents. I spoke to Maryland Senator Chris Van Hollen today about this. He said the memo - in his words - is another example of the president taking a chainsaw to important services for the public and workers themselves.</p><p>CHRIS VAN HOLLEN: This is nothing less than mafia-style blackmail. Essentially, the president is threatening to fire dedicated federal employees who have nothing to do with the ongoing political and policy dispute.</p><p>CHANG: Well, I have to ask both of you, 'cause you've covered other government shutdowns, I mean, how does this standoff compare to past shutdown standoffs?</p><p>KEITH: Yeah, I was chatting with Max Stier from the Partnership for Public Service, which is a nonpartisan organization that basically exists to make the government work better. And he told me, in past shutdowns, when they've happened, administrations have typically wanted to minimize the impact that the public feels. This administration, however, he says, sees a shutdown as a new opportunity to further tear apart the federal workforce and undermine agencies and programs that it does not like.</p><p>SPRUNT: And you know, what strikes me about this, I have to say, is that, like, both parties seem so sure that the other party is going to own the consequence of the shutdown. Democrats seem to be banking on the fact that the public will blame the White House and Republicans, and vice versa. And, you know, we hate to leave things at time will tell. But in this case, until a shutdown happens, it is hard to know which party is actually going to shoulder the blame of this. And we're talking a lot about politics and political maneuvering here. But we should say, like, beyond politics, a shutdown means paused services. It means dismissed workers. There are real consequences here.</p><p>CHANG: Absolutely. That is NPR's Barbara Sprunt and Tamara Keith. Thanks so much to both of you.</p><p>KEITH: You're welcome.</p><p>SPRUNT: Thank you, Ailsa.</p>\n    <p>Copyright © 2025 NPR.  All rights reserved.

And education researchers warn that two of those three proposals — from the White House and House Republicans — would impose steep cuts on some of the United States' most vulnerable students and disadvantaged school communities.</p>   <h3>The three proposals on the table</h3>   <p>First up, <a href=\"https://www.ed.gov/media/document/fy-2026-presidents-budget-request-110152.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">President Trump's proposed budget</a> would cut U.S. Department of Education funding by 15%. It would eliminate all funding ($1.3 billion) for English language learners and migrant students. It would also combine 18 funding streams — including help for rural schools, civics education, at-risk youth and students experiencing homelessness — and cut them from roughly $6.5 billion down to $2 billion.</p>   \n   <p>The White House has <a href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Fiscal-Year-2026-Discretionary-Budget-Request.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">defended this consolidation</a>, saying it \"requires fewer Federal staff and empowers States and districts to make spending decisions based on their needs.\"</p>   <p>The <a href=\"https://appropriations.house.gov/sites/evo-subsites/republicans-appropriations.house.gov/files/evo-media-document/fy26-labor-health-and-human-services-education-and-related-agencies-subcommittee-mark.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">second proposal, from House Republicans</a>, would push for even deeper K-12 cuts, notably a $4.7 billion reduction in funding that supports schools in low-income communities. This funding stream, known as Title I, has enjoyed bipartisan support for decades and currently sends roughly <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2025/03/21/nx-s1-5330917/trump-schools-education-department-cuts-low-income\" target=\"_blank\">$18 billion to schools</a> in disadvantaged communities all over the United States.</p>   <p>In a <a href=\"https://appropriations.house.gov/news/press-releases/committee-approves-fy26-labor-health-and-human-services-education-and-related\" target=\"_blank\">news release</a> heralding the legislation, the chairman of the House Appropriations Committee, Republican Tom Cole of Oklahoma, said, \"Change doesn't come from keeping the status quo—it comes from making bold, disciplined choices.\"</p>   <p>And the<strong> </strong><a href=\"https://www.appropriations.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/fy26_lhhs_bill_text.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">third proposal, from the Senate</a>, would make minor cuts but largely maintain funding.</p>   <p>A quick reminder: Federal funding makes up a relatively small share of school budgets, roughly 11%, though cuts in low-income districts can still be painful and disruptive.</p>   <h3>Schools in blue congressional districts could lose more money</h3>   <p>Researchers at the liberal-leaning think tank New America <a href=\"https://www.newamerica.org/education-policy/edcentral/congressional-districts-losing-the-most-k12-funding-under-trump-and-house-budgets/\" target=\"_blank\">wanted to know</a> how the impact of these proposals might vary depending on the politics of the congressional district receiving the money. They found that the Trump budget would subtract an average of about $35 million from each district's K-12 schools, with those led by Democrats losing slightly more than those led by Republicans.</p>   \n   <p>The House proposal would make deeper, more partisan cuts, with districts represented by Democrats losing an average of about $46 million and Republican-led districts losing about $36 million.</p>   <p>Republican leadership of the House Appropriations Committee, which is responsible for this budget proposal, did not respond to an NPR request for comment on this partisan divide.</p>   <p>\"In several cases, we've had to make some very hard choices,\" Rep. Robert Aderholt, R-Ala., a top Republican on the appropriations committee, said during the full-committee markup of the bill. \"Americans must make priorities as they sit around their kitchen tables about the resources they have within their family. And we should be doing the same thing.\"</p>   \n   <p>The Senate proposal is more moderate and would leave the status quo largely intact.</p>   <p>In addition to the work of New America, the liberal-leaning Learning Policy Institute created <a href=\"https://learningpolicyinstitute.org/blog/5-billion-federal-k-12-formula-funding-hangs-balance-between-white-house-and-senate-proposals\" target=\"_blank\">this tool</a> to compare the potential impact of the Senate bill with the president's proposal.</p>   <h3>High-poverty schools could lose more than low-poverty schools</h3>   <p>The Trump and House proposals would disproportionately hurt high-poverty school districts, according to an <a href=\"https://edtrust.org/rti/fy26-federal-funding-at-risk-for-americas-schools/\" target=\"_blank\">analysis by the liberal-leaning EdTrust</a>.</p>   \n   <p>In Kentucky, for example, EdTrust estimates that the president's budget could cost the state's highest-poverty school districts $359 per student, nearly three times what it would cost its wealthiest districts.</p>   <p>The cuts are even steeper in<strong> </strong>the House proposal: Kentucky's highest-poverty schools could lose $372 per student, while its lowest-poverty schools could lose $143 per child.</p>   <p>The Senate bill would cut far less: $37 per child in the state's highest-poverty school districts versus $12 per student in its lowest-poverty districts.</p>   <p>New America researchers arrived at similar conclusions when studying congressional districts.</p>   <p>\"The lowest-income congressional districts would lose one and a half times as much funding as the richest congressional districts under the Trump budget,\" says New America's Zahava Stadler.</p>   <p>The House proposal, Stadler says, would go further, imposing a cut the Trump budget does not on Title I.</p>   <p>\"The House budget does something new and scary,\" Stadler says, \"which is it openly targets funding for students in poverty. This is not something that we see <em>ever</em>.\"</p>   <p>Republican leaders of the House Appropriations Committee did not respond to NPR requests for comment on their proposal's outsize impact on low-income communities.</p>   <p>The Senate has proposed a modest increase to Title I for next year.</p>   <h3>Majority-minority schools could lose more than mostly white schools</h3>   <p>Just as the president's budget would hit high-poverty schools hard, New America found that it would also have an outsize impact on congressional districts where schools serve predominantly children of color. These districts would lose nearly twice as much funding as predominantly white districts, in what Stadler calls \"a huge, huge disparity<em>.\"</em></p>   \n   <p>One of several drivers of that disparity is the White House's decision to end all funding for English language learners and <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2018/08/29/640862283/in-one-generation-a-farmworker-family-grows-college-ambitions\" target=\"_blank\">migrant students</a>. In <a href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Fiscal-Year-2026-Discretionary-Budget-Request.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">one budget document</a>, the White House justified cutting the former by arguing the program \"deemphasizes English primacy. ... The historically low reading scores for all students mean States and communities need to unite—not divide—classrooms.\"</p>   <p>Under the House proposal, according to New America, congressional districts that serve predominantly white students would lose roughly $27 million on average, while districts with schools that serve mostly children of color would lose more than twice as much: nearly $58 million.</p>   \n   <p>EdTrust's data tool tells a similar story, state by state. For example, under the president's budget, Pennsylvania school districts that serve the most students of color would lose $413 per student. Districts that serve the fewest students of color would lose just $101 per child.</p>   <p>The findings were similar for the House proposal: a $499-per-student cut in Pennsylvania districts that serve the most students of color versus a $128 cut per child in predominantly white districts.</p>   <p>\"That was most surprising to me,\" says EdTrust's Ivy Morgan. \"Overall, the House proposal really is worse [than the Trump budget] for high-poverty districts, districts with high percentages of students of color, city and rural districts. And we were not expecting to see that.\"</p>   <p>The Trump and House proposals do share one common denominator: the belief that the federal government should be spending less on the nation's schools.</p>   <p>When Trump <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSbBNm5Pms0\" target=\"_blank\">pledged</a>, \"We're going to be returning education very simply back to the states where it belongs,\" that apparently included scaling back some of the federal role in funding schools, too.</p>   <p>The challenge for states, communities and families, if one of these budgets becomes a reality, will be filling that funding void, especially since the federal government has always focused its dollars on helping students and schools that need it the most.</p>\n</div>"

In the case of TikTok, the administration is seeking a fee for service. With Intel, the federal government is acquiring an equity stake. For chipmakers Nvidia and AMD, meanwhile, the demand was for a slice of future profits. And with the network television settlements, the payouts arose after personal legal disputes.</p>   \n   <p>\"There is no consistent principle at play, just the exercise of Trump's personal power over other people's money,\" said Dael Norwood, associate professor of history at the University of Delaware, who notes that the winners and losers are clear.</p>   <p>\"All Americans — taxpayers, investors, customers, and workers — lose with crony capitalism,\" he said. \"It increases everyone's costs, makes everyone more vulnerable to extortion (or worse), and profoundly degrades our expectations for honesty and fair dealing, society-wide.\"</p>   <p>In public, corporate executives show support to the president and appear to back such deals, but behind closed doors, <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2025/08/14/nx-s1-5501591/trump-corporate-america-capitalism\" target=\"_blank\">some business leaders are expressing deep concern</a>.</p>   \n   <p>Yale School of Management professor Jeffrey Sonnenfeld recently helped organize a gathering of more than 100 top CEOs, and he said there was near-unanimous consensus in surveys conducted at the event that Trump's interventions in private business are undermining America's free market principles.</p>   <p>\"These are shakedown schemes. It's a gross violation of what capitalism is supposed to stand for. I'd even call it extortion,\" Sonnenfeld said. \"Privately, CEOs are horrified.\"</p>   <p>But Sonnenfeld said executives are not banding together to push back on Trump, as top business leaders <a href=\"https://insights.som.yale.edu/insights/ceos-urge-respect-for-election-integrity\" target=\"_blank\">did</a> following Trump's election denialism in November 2020.</p>   <p>\"CEOs need to speak up, like they did then, but they aren't doing it publicly,\" Sonnenfeld said. \"Fear of retaliation is motivating the silence, but there has got to be a trigger line to stop this. We just don't know what that is yet.\"</p>   <p>Talks with American investors for a potential acquisition of TikTok's U.S. enterprise have been moving in fits and starts for the past five years, starting back when the Trump administration <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2020/09/26/917134452/new-doj-filing-tiktoks-owner-is-a-mouthpiece-of-chinese-communist-party\" target=\"_blank\">declared</a> the Chinese-owned hit video app to be a national security threat and sought to have it banned.</p>   <p>Since Trump's about-face and embrace of TikTok, it has been clear that software and cloud-computing company Oracle would be a major player in the bid to take over the app's American presence.</p>   \n   <p>Oracle co-founder Larry Ellison is a close confidante of Trump and the president has said both publicly and in private that he'd like to see TikTok controlled by Oracle.</p>   <p>According to the source with direct knowledge of the talks, many of the deal's provisions have been under discussion for months, including that Oracle will host and oversee all of Americans' TikTok data. Beijing-based ByteDance <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2025/04/02/nx-s1-5349592/tiktok-oracle-trump-china-deal\" target=\"_blank\">will license</a> its algorithm to the U.S. entity to be retrained based only on the 170 million U.S. users of the app and ByteDance will keep a minority stake in the company.</p>   <p>The one part of the agreement that caught investors by surprise? The multibillion-dollar fee request.</p>   <p>\"They were taken aback when they were told they'd have to kick in,\" the source said. \"But I think they see it as just the price of doing business right now.\"</p>\n</div>"
