    "body": "<div>\n      <p>If the government shuts down next week, the White House said it will look for ways to permanently eliminate some federal workers, rather than just temporarily send them home on unpaid leave.</p>   \n</div><div>\n    <p>AILSA CHANG, HOST: </p><p> Well, the federal government is set to run out of funding in just five days. And with no deal on the horizon, the White House is instructing agencies to look for people to fire permanently if a temporary shutdown does occur. It is an unprecedented escalation in the standoff between Republicans and Democrats on federal spending. And joining us now to talk through all of this is NPR senior White House correspondent Tamara Keith and NPR congressional correspondent Barbara Sprunt. Hello to both of you.</p><p>TAMARA KEITH, BYLINE: Hello.</p><p>BARBARA SPRUNT, BYLINE: Hi.</p><p>CHANG: All right, Tam, let's start with you. I mean, this proposal, if I'm not mistaken, is a major departure from what's historically happened to federal workers in the event of a shutdown, right? Like, we're usually talking about furloughs and such. Where is this threat coming from?</p><p>KEITH: Yeah. The White House budget office sent a letter to agency heads saying that a funding lapse would give the administration a chance to further cut the federal workforce, and it urged them to draw up plans for firing people who work on programs that are not consistent with the president's priorities. It also included the line, we remain hopeful that Democrats in Congress will not trigger a shutdown and the steps outlined above will not be necessary.</p><p>CHANG: OK. Well, as we said, it's T minus five days to a shutdown. Barbara, remind us where things do stand on negotiations at the moment.</p><p>SPRUNT: Well, House Republicans passed a bill that would fund the government at current levels through November 21, but it hasn't passed the Senate because Democrats are holding out for changes in health care spending. Democratic leaders were on track to sit down with the president today to talk about all this, but President Trump canceled the meeting.</p><p>KEITH: Yeah, he said it would be pointless because Democrats are making unreasonable demands. And then he blamed a potential shutdown on Democrats. So the usual back-and-forth, closed-door negotiations, shuttle diplomacy with the Hill that would normally be happening this close to a shutdown just isn't happening.</p><p>SPRUNT: Yeah, that's for sure. And top Democrats keep saying that they're ready to meet. You know, they want to discuss this, but they want more than a verbal agreement in the negotiations. They want their demands in written legislation. And if we're reading the tea leaves about Congress itself, I think it's telling that Speaker Mike Johnson isn't planning on bringing the House back into session until after this shutdown would begin.</p><p>CHANG: Yeah, that is a clue. I mean - OK, so Tam, let's just play this out a bit. Can the White House use a government shutdown to push through mass layoffs as they're describing they're going to do?</p><p>KEITH: Well, I called up Shalanda Young. She has been through many budget battles as a high-level congressional staffer and then as budget director in the Biden administration. And that's one of the questions I asked her.</p><p>SHALANDA YOUNG: A shutdown doesn't give OMB or White House any further authority to let federal workers go or do mass firings. So this is, at best, a negotiating tactic; at worst, a cover to do what you were going to do anyway, which is fire a bunch of federal workers.</p><p>KEITH: She expects that if a funding lapse were to happen and if the administration moved forward with this plan, there would be lawsuits challenging the legality of the moves, which would end up winding their way slowly through the courts like so many other challenges to Trump administration actions that are already being litigated. But she said significant damage to the government can be done in the meantime, and that would be hard to reverse.</p><p>One more thing to note, though, so far, all we have is this budget office memo or letter instructing agencies to plan for layoffs. We don't yet have those specific agency plans, so we don't know which jobs would be targeted for elimination or how many.</p><p>CHANG: That's - I mean, in many ways, wouldn't you say that all of this tracks with the basic philosophy of the Trump administration when it comes to its approach to cutting government programs?</p><p>KEITH: Very much so. This is on brand. So far this year, the Partnership for Public Service says more than 200,000 people have been pushed out of the federal workforce, with more cuts planned even before this potential shutdown move. And the White House has made no secret of its desire to have more power over how the government spends its money, regardless of what Congress passes.</p><p>CHANG: OK. Well, Barbara, leaving Pennsylvania Avenue for a moment and turning to Capitol Hill, is it fair to say some people in Congress disagree with this approach?</p><p>SPRUNT: Oh, I'd say so...</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>SPRUNT: ...Particularly the Democrats. You know, this is not only about the shutdown. I think it speaks to a larger, ongoing conflict between the White House and Congress. The White House has already rescinded funds that Congress appropriated. And, you know, lawmakers are generally pretty protective of that power of the purse. This is part of the reason that Democratic lawmakers say it's hard to make a deal with Republicans when it comes to funding issues, because they feel that Republicans in Congress have ceded that authority to the president.</p><p>CHANG: Well, tell us more about what Democrats are asking for specifically here.</p><p>SPRUNT: So Democrats want to roll back some Medicaid changes that were part of the president's tax and spending bill that he passed - or he signed earlier this summer, and they want to extend tax credits that are part of the Affordable Care Act. Those expire at the end of the year. And, of course, now they're also concerned about this OMB memo and potential firings of their constituents. I spoke to Maryland Senator Chris Van Hollen today about this. He said the memo - in his words - is another example of the president taking a chainsaw to important services for the public and workers themselves.</p><p>CHRIS VAN HOLLEN: This is nothing less than mafia-style blackmail. Essentially, the president is threatening to fire dedicated federal employees who have nothing to do with the ongoing political and policy dispute.</p><p>CHANG: Well, I have to ask both of you, 'cause you've covered other government shutdowns, I mean, how does this standoff compare to past shutdown standoffs?</p><p>KEITH: Yeah, I was chatting with Max Stier from the Partnership for Public Service, which is a nonpartisan organization that basically exists to make the government work better. And he told me, in past shutdowns, when they've happened, administrations have typically wanted to minimize the impact that the public feels. This administration, however, he says, sees a shutdown as a new opportunity to further tear apart the federal workforce and undermine agencies and programs that it does not like.</p><p>SPRUNT: And you know, what strikes me about this, I have to say, is that, like, both parties seem so sure that the other party is going to own the consequence of the shutdown. Democrats seem to be banking on the fact that the public will blame the White House and Republicans, and vice versa. And, you know, we hate to leave things at time will tell. But in this case, until a shutdown happens, it is hard to know which party is actually going to shoulder the blame of this. And we're talking a lot about politics and political maneuvering here. But we should say, like, beyond politics, a shutdown means paused services. It means dismissed workers. There are real consequences here.</p><p>CHANG: Absolutely. That is NPR's Barbara Sprunt and Tamara Keith. Thanks so much to both of you.</p><p>KEITH: You're welcome.</p><p>SPRUNT: Thank you, Ailsa.</p>\n    <p>Copyright © 2025 NPR.  All rights reserved.

That last job brought threats that required around-the-clock security and hostility from Trump, who has said he wants to throw Smith in jail or deport him. (The Justice Department dropped both of Smith's criminal cases, as a matter of policy, after Trump won the 2024 election.)</p>   <p>At the start of his remarks, Smith said he would not discuss politics, and he never referred to Trump by name. Instead, he delivered a call to defend the rule of law, punctuated by recent examples of its erosion.</p>   <p>For Smith, the headlines tell part of the story. Already this year, career prosecutors in Manhattan have <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2025/02/14/nx-s1-5298040/justice-department-eric-adams-fallout\" target=\"_blank\">quit en masse</a> after DOJ leaders sought to walk away from a corruption case against New York Mayor Eric Adams. </p>   <p>The White House issued <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2025/03/28/nx-s1-5343616/two-major-law-firms-fight-back-against-trump-orders-seen-as-retribution\" target=\"_blank\">executive orders targeting big law firms</a> because of their clients or lawyers they hired who had run afoul of Trump. Only days after Smith's speech, not far from George Mason University, in the Eastern District of Virginia, came a marked escalation. Last weekend, Trump posted a message on social media, saying the Justice Department <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2025/09/22/nx-s1-5550132/trump-justice-department-comey-letitia-james-virginia\" target=\"_blank\">needed to prosecute</a> former FBI Director Jim Comey, New York Attorney General Letitia James, and California Democratic Sen. Adam Schiff — and fast. The U.S. attorney in the Eastern District, who had cast doubt on cases against Comey and James, was forced out and replaced with a Trump ally who has no experience as a prosecutor. </p>   \n   <p>\"Political opponents, critics, perceived enemies are targeted for investigation or arrest to silence them, and the prosecutors instead of investigating … cases, they're left to figure out a basis for charges after the fact,\" Smith said.</p>   <p>On the flip side, people close to the president face no danger of investigation or prosecution, even when the facts and the law might merit those steps, Smith said.</p>   <p>\"Where the rule of law is eroding, friends of the president do not have to worry about following the same laws that the rest of us follow,\" Smith said. \"Exceptions will be made. And nobody, I mean nobody, in a president's administration, or his allies, will be investigated or prosecuted, no matter what they do.\"</p>   <p>This week, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt forcefully rejected the idea that Trump is misusing the Justice Department. </p>   <p>\"The President is fulfilling his promise to restore a Department of Justice that demands accountability, and it is not weaponizing the Department of Justice,\" Leavitt said.</p>   \n   <p>But for Smith, and many other DOJ veterans, traditions and norms over decades have been thrown aside along with the idea that the law applies equally to friends and foes. At the heart of the system is the idea that \"law itself must be the same for everyone but importantly it must be enforced the same for everyone,\" Smith said.</p>   <p>Now, current leaders at the Justice Department, who helped defend Trump in cases that Smith brought, seem to have abandoned norms and traditions about nonpartisan enforcement if they clash with what the president wants, he said. </p>   <p>\"They were hired and they're thus driven to get outcomes, no matter the cost to the credibility of the institution they represent, no matter whether those outcomes are legal, no matter whether those outcomes are just,\" Smith said.</p>   <p>This year, grand juries in Washington, D.C., and Los Angeles have been rejecting demands to issue indictments amid the administration's surge of federal immigration enforcement in those cities. And judges have been rejecting search warrants and calling out prosecutors for a lack of credibility. It's extremely difficult to witness, Smith said.</p>   \n   <p>He saved his strongest remarks for public servants at the DOJ and elsewhere, offering praise for their integrity and expertise. Several Justice Department lawyers have <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2025/07/30/nx-s1-5476311/trump-fired-workers-justice-department\" target=\"_blank\">resigned or been fired</a> this year in flash points across the country. </p>   <p>\"Today we have seen conflict between the leadership of the Justice Department and line career prosecutors like never before,\" Smith said. \"And the reason is simple: because the leadership is asking those prosecutors to do things that the prosecutors know are wrong.\"</p>\n</div>"

In a heated committee meeting Wednesday, state lawmakers said they're considering a lot of options before deciding in October.</p>   <p>Unlike other Republican-led states redistricting this year, Utah's new map is expected to give Democrats more of a chance at winning at least one of the state's four congressional districts, which could help Democrats in the race to control the U.S. House. State lawmakers were ordered to draw the new districts after a<strong> </strong>Utah judge ruled they had acted unconstitutionally in creating the map used in 2022.</p>   \n   <h2>GOP \"complying under protest\" </h2>   <p>The Legislature's Republican supermajority has made it clear they are not happy they had to go back to the drawing board and are complying under protest. The map must be approved by lawmakers and the court by Nov. 10 to be used in the 2026 midterms, according to Lt. Gov. Deidre Henderson's <strong>o</strong>ffice.</p>   <p>Utah's <a href=\"https://citygate.utleg.gov/legdistricting/comments/plan/156/12\" target=\"_blank\"><u>voided congressional map</u></a> split the bluest area of the state, Salt Lake County, among the state's four districts, making four U.S. House seats safe for Republicans. That split was the biggest critique of the map, especially by county residents.</p>   <p>All of the proposed new boundaries also <a href=\"https://www.kuer.org/politics-government/2025-09-23/as-utah-moves-forward-in-redistricting-a-divided-salt-lake-county-is-inevitable\" target=\"_blank\"><u>divide the county</u></a>, the most populous one in the state, but some only split it into two districts.</p>   <p>Instead of advancing a single proposed map, the Legislature's redistricting committee said Wednesday it will let the public weigh in on any map that has been posted on its <a href=\"https://citygate.utleg.gov/legdistricting/utah/comment_links\" target=\"_blank\"><u>website</u></a> before making a decision. That includes six maps commissioned by lawmakers, as well as proposals submitted by citizens.</p>   <p>Lawmakers will choose from one of those maps, and only those maps, on Oct. 6. The map will go back to court for the judge to approve.</p>   <h2>The national picture</h2>   <p>Though Utah's redistricting originated from a local court case, it's playing out amid a <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2025/09/14/nx-s1-5538407/after-missouri-what-state-is-next-a-redistricting-race-started-by-trump-continues\" target=\"_blank\"><u>redistricting race </u></a>around the country set off by President Trump.</p>   \n   <p>Usually, states redistrict early in the decade using new census numbers. In order to try to keep the GOP hold on the U.S. House and worried about midterm election losses, Trump has asked states led by Republicans to redistrict ahead of 2026 and help their party win seats.</p>   <p>At Trump's urging, Texas passed a new map that could help Republicans win five more seats. <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2025/08/22/nx-s1-5511300/california-texas-redistricting-shifts\" target=\"_blank\"><u>To counter, California's</u></a> Democratic leaders are asking voters to approve a new map that could help their party win five seats on November 4. <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2025/09/12/nx-s1-5537977/redistricting-midterms-trump-missouri\" target=\"_blank\"><u>Missouri has followed</u></a> Trump's lead, with the Republican-led Legislature passing a map that could oust a Democratic congressman.</p>   <p>Republican leaders in Indiana and Florida say they are working to follow Trump's call. They and other Republicans across the country say holding the U.S. House is key to maintaining Trump's agenda and preventing investigations of his administration that could be launched by a Democratic-led House.</p>   <h2>The Utahns who sued</h2>   <p>In 2018, Utah voters narrowly approved a ballot initiative known as Proposition 4 that, among other things, created an independent redistricting commission and prohibited gerrymandering. In 2020, the Legislature repealed and replaced the initiative with a law that weakened the commission's role and took out the prohibition on partisan gerrymandering.</p>   <p>In 2022, the League of Women Voters of Utah, Mormon Women for Ethical Government and a handful of Utah voters sued the Legislature. They alleged that the Legislature violated Utahns' right to alter and reform their government and that the state's 2021 congressional map was gerrymandered to favor Republicans.</p>   <p>In <a href=\"https://www.kuer.org/politics-government/2025-08-25/judge-tosses-out-utahs-congressional-maps-in-long-fought-redistricting-case\" target=\"_blank\"><u>August of this year</u></a>, a Utah judge ruled that the Legislature's override of Proposition 4 was unconstitutional. Because the state's 2021 congressional map was a product of that unconstitutional act, the judge said it had to go.</p>   <p>Without valid maps, the Legislature has to redraw the boundaries in accordance with Proposition 4, which the judge also reinstated.</p>   \n   <p>At the same time, GOP state lawmakers are trying to pass a <a href=\"https://le.utah.gov/interim/2025/pdf/00003633.pdf\" target=\"_blank\"><u>bill</u></a> that creates a single standardized method for testing \"partisan symmetry\" in congressional maps to determine if boundaries are fair.</p>   <p>But Democrats on the committee argued that the test does not work in states like Utah where one party dominates in statewide elections.</p>   <p>That proposed test is what most concerns Elizabeth Rasmussen, executive director of Better Boundaries, the group that backed Proposition 4.</p>   <p>\"I just see this as weaponization of the process to get a map they want,\" Rasmussen says.</p>   <p>If the plaintiffs in the lawsuit have objections to the Legislature's map, they are also allowed to submit a proposal to the court. If that happens, there will be additional court hearings in late October to decide which map will be used.</p>\n</div>"

This year, the party has done noticeably better in special elections. The Democratic National Committee says it's investing more time and more resources into federal, state and local races. NPR political correspondent Stephen Fowler sat down with DNC Chairman Ken Martin over the weekend and he asked if that plan seems to be working.</p><p>STEPHEN FOWLER, BYLINE: Why is the head of the Democratic Party in a suburban Atlanta coffee shop on a random Saturday in September?</p><p>KEN MARTIN: Well, I'll tell you why. We've got a really important state Senate special election here in Senate District 21, which we are investing in. We believe we have a real shot at winning.</p><p>FOWLER: In that special election runoff this past Tuesday, they did not flip the deep-red seat. But Martin and others in the party do view it as a win because the Democrat, Debra Shigley, improved the party's margin by double digits from November. For their part, Republicans aren't concerned and tout their own enthusiasm. Georgia Republican Party Chairman Josh McKoon said the victory was because Republicans, quote, \"cut through the noise with a coordinated investment in digital and social media messages to get out the vote.\"</p><p>MARTIN: You know, the reality is what we're seeing right now, of course, is a lot of enthusiasm amongst Democrats. People are energized. People understand that we have to stand up and fight back.</p><p>FOWLER: Because it's not a one-off result. In about 40 special elections since President Trump was reelected in November, Democrats have overperformed by an average of about 15%. In an interview before this week's elections, Martin said he has an idea why.</p><p>MARTIN: Many of the groups that Donald Trump won in 2024, he's lost considerable ground with, including independent voters, young voters, the Latino community, the AAPI community, women.</p><p>FOWLER: So Martin is optimistic for next year's midterms.</p><p>MARTIN: The important thing to remember is midterm elections are not a referendum on the party that's not in power. So our numbers really don't matter here, right? Donald Trump is at an all-time low in terms of his favorability and his approval numbers. The Republican Party is as well.</p><p>FOWLER: But the numbers aren't great for the Democratic Party, either. And opposition to Trump does not inherently mean voters like what Democrats are selling. The DNC chairman, elected in February by party insiders after leading Minnesota's Democratic-Farmer-Labor Party for 14 years, says they're working on it.</p><p>MARTIN: Guess what? We can walk and chew gum at the same time. We can both resist Donald Trump while also giving people a sense of what we're fighting for and how their lives would improve with Democrats back in power.</p><p>FOWLER: As for those within the party who say the Democrats aren't doing enough to win elections or push back against Trump policies they don't like, Martin has a blunt response.</p><p>MARTIN: Stop bitching. Stop complaining. Roll up your sleeves and get in the game.</p><p>FOWLER: More diplomatically, the chairman points out he's been to 32 states since taking over the DNC. The party has been organizing in more places earlier than normal, and there's been investment in behind-the-scenes infrastructure that doesn't grab as many headlines.</p><p>MARTIN: And so, again, people ask what the DNC is doing. We're winning. We've been winning since I've been chair, and we're going to continue to win because we're doing the things that help put us in a position to do that.</p><p>FOWLER: Still, one of Martin's go-to quips is that there are no brownie points for coming in second place - a place that Democrats still find themselves in, with little power in Washington.

Without them, millions face rate hikes or risk losing their coverage.</p>   \n</div>\n<div>\n    <p>A MARTÍNEZ, HOST: </p><p> A government shutdown is looking more and more likely. And this time, it could be far more severe than in the past.</p><p>STEVE INSKEEP, HOST: </p><p> A memo from the White House instructs federal agencies to prepare mass firing plans if funding lapses at the end of the month. This plan goes beyond the usual temporary furloughs during a shutdown. It would permanently cut jobs in programs that are established by law but the president doesn't like. As so often happens, Republicans and Democrats do not agree on a funding measure for the fiscal year that is about to start. Republicans want a short-term extension, while Democrats have insisted that extension should include some protections for people who have health insurance premiums to pay.</p><p>MARTÍNEZ: NPR's Selena Simmons-Duffin covers all things health insurance. All right, so let's start with deadlines here. The shutdown could start next week, but there are other key dates at play.</p><p>SELENA SIMMONS-DUFFIN, BYLINE: Yeah. So in just over a month, on November 1st, open enrollment begins on the Affordable Care Act marketplaces. You might know them as Obamacare, healthcare.gov. That's all the same thing. And this is where people shop for insurance if they don't get it through their job - so, you know, a lot of freelancers, small business employees. At the end of the year, something called the enhanced premium tax credits expire. Those have kept premiums affordable for people who get their insurance this way. And if Congress doesn't act to extend those tax credits in the next week or two, people are going to get sticker shock when open enrollment starts and they see that monthly amount they pay for health insurance is going to go way up next year.</p><p>MARTÍNEZ: Where did these tax credits come from?</p><p>SIMMONS-DUFFIN: So when the ACA was passed way back in 2010, Congress created kind of a sliding scale to help give people a break on their premiums. But the way it was originally set up didn't work very well. Premiums were still really high for a lot of people, so enrollment was sluggish. And in 2021, Congress stepped in. They sweetened the pot with a lot more federal funding, which made premiums more affordable for people at all income levels. Sabrina Corlette of the Georgetown Center on Health Insurance Reform told me that worked. Enrollment more than doubled. It's now 24 million people. And the uninsured rate for the entire country sank to the lowest it's ever been.</p><p>SABRINA CORLETTE: Incredibly successful effort to get more people into coverage and reduce the uninsured rate.</p><p>MARTÍNEZ: All right. So what happens, though, if the enhanced credits expire?</p><p>SIMMONS-DUFFIN: In short, people's costs will go up and enrollment will drop. Ultimately, millions of people could become uninsured. Yesterday, I talked with Emily Pisacreta. She's a senior producer with the health care podcast An Arm And A Leg, which partners with KFF Health News and NPR member station KUOW. They just did an episode about her quest to find ACA insurance, something she really needs since she has Type 1 diabetes. She found a plan that works for her for $500 per month, but it could get much more expensive next year if those enhanced credits expire.</p><p>EMILY PISACRETA, BYLINE: Five hundred dollars a month is not little. And to imagine it going up to almost $900 a month seems really scary.</p><p>SIMMONS-DUFFIN: I talked to somebody who lives in West Virginia who's putting money aside that would go to retirement because of these changes. And another person in Florida told me he's considering finding a new job with benefits if his premium becomes unaffordable.</p><p>MARTÍNEZ: So what are the politics on all this? Where does that stand right now?</p><p>SIMMONS-DUFFIN: There are Republican lawmakers who would like to extend these tax credits, others who really don't want to. But either way, it's really hard to see this getting resolved before a shutdown next week since there are no - currently no active talks between the two parties.</p><p>MARTÍNEZ: That's NPR health policy correspondent, Selena Simmons-Duffin. Thanks a lot.</p><p>SIMMONS-DUFFIN: You're welcome.</p>\n    <p>Copyright © 2025 NPR.  All rights reserved.

General Assembly, demanding an investigation into back-to-back mishaps with an escalator, a teleprompter and a sound system — for which the U.N. is at least partially blaming the White House.</p>   <p>\"A REAL DISGRACE took place at the United Nations yesterday — Not one, not two, but three very sinister events!\" Trump wrote in a Wednesday <a href=\"https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/posts/115261466629181518\" target=\"_blank\">Truth Social post</a>. \"This wasn't a coincidence, this was triple sabotage at the UN. They ought to be ashamed of themselves … No wonder the United Nations hasn't been able to do the job that they were put in existence to do.\"</p>   \n   <p>Trump visited the U.N.'s headquarters in New York City on Tuesday to speak to a room of world leaders. The trouble began pretty much the moment he stepped on the escalator, just behind first lady Melania Trump.</p>   \n   <p>The escalator stopped abruptly mere seconds into their ride, leaving the couple briefly stranded. Video of the incident, which some are calling \"Escalatorgate,\" <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GTAa97rSFgY\" target=\"_blank\">shows them walking up</a> the rest of the stairs while holding onto the handrails.</p>   <p>A short while later, as Trump took the podium to begin his remarks, he observed that his teleprompter wasn't working. He said he didn't mind, adding that \"I can only say that whoever's operating this teleprompter is in big trouble,\" which drew laughs from the crowd.</p>   <p>Trump took a moment to recount — and seemingly laugh off — the technical difficulties of the day.</p>   <p>\"All I got from the United Nations was an escalator that on the way up stopped right in the middle,\" he said, adding that if the first lady weren't in such good shape, she would have fallen. \"And then a teleprompter that didn't work.\"</p>   <p>Then, with the device back on track, Trump proceeded to deliver a nearly <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2025/09/23/nx-s1-5546864/trump-foreign-policy-priorities-unga\" target=\"_blank\">hourlong speech</a> in which <a href=\"https://www.rev.com/transcripts/trump-speaks-at-un\" target=\"_blank\">he called</a> global warming a hoax, criticized Europe for its \"unmitigated immigration disaster\" and accused the U.N. of \"funding an assault on Western countries and their borders.\"</p>   \n   <p>Trump has long been critical of the organization, <a href=\"https://www.state.gov/releases/2025/07/the-united-states-withdraws-from-the-united-nations-educational-scientific-and-cultural-organization-unesco\" target=\"_blank\">withdrawing the U.S. from UNESCO</a> and the U.N. Human Rights Council in both of his terms. But he said during a <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/world/trump-blasts-un-not-helping-us-led-peace-efforts-backs-it-100-2025-09-23/\" target=\"_blank\">meeting later Tuesday</a> with U.N. Secretary-General António Guterres that the U.S. is \"behind the United Nations 100%.\"</p>   \n   <p>Afterward, Trump <a href=\"https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/posts/115254363337739989\" target=\"_blank\">wrote on Truth Social</a> that he believed his speech was \"very well received,\" and that the teleprompter and escalator malfunctions \"probably made the speech more interesting than it would have been otherwise.\"</p>   <p>But his tone quickly changed. By Wednesday, Trump was calling the escalator incident \"absolutely sabotage\" and calling for the arrest of those responsible.</p>   <p>\"It's amazing that Melania and I didn't fall forward onto the sharp edges of these steel steps, face first,\" Trump wrote. \"It was only that we were each holding the handrail tightly or, it would have been a disaster.\"</p>   <p>Trump said the Secret Service was investigating, and demanded that the U.N. open its own probe. On Wednesday night, Guterres spokesperson Stéphane Dujarric <a href=\"https://www.un.org/sg/en/content/sg/statement/2025-09-24/statement-attributable-the-spokesperson-for-the-secretary-general-%E2%80%93-correspondence-the-permanent-mission-of-the-united-states-the-united-nations\" target=\"_blank\">announced</a> that the secretary-general had ordered a thorough investigation.</p>   <p>\"He conveyed that the UN is ready to cooperate in full transparency with relevant US authorities on this matter to determine what caused the incidents referred to by the United States,\" he wrote.</p>   <div>\n            <div>\n        <picture>\n            <source srcset=\"https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/7809x5208+0+0/resize/400/quality/85/format/webp/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fad%2Fd8%2F93a37d384bd4896511fc1653400b%2Fgettyimages-2236921769.jpg 400w, https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/7809x5208+0+0/resize/600/quality/85/format/webp/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fad%2Fd8%2F93a37d384bd4896511fc1653400b%2Fgettyimages-2236921769.jpg 600w, https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/7809x5208+0+0/resize/800/quality/85/format/webp/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fad%2Fd8%2F93a37d384bd4896511fc1653400b%2Fgettyimages-2236921769.jpg 800w, https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/7809x5208+0+0/resize/900/quality/85/format/webp/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fad%2Fd8%2F93a37d384bd4896511fc1653400b%2Fgettyimages-2236921769.jpg 900w, https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/7809x5208+0+0/resize/1200/quality/85/format/webp/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fad%2Fd8%2F93a37d384bd4896511fc1653400b%2Fgettyimages-2236921769.jpg 1200w, https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/7809x5208+0+0/resize/1600/quality/85/format/webp/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fad%2Fd8%2F93a37d384bd4896511fc1653400b%2Fgettyimages-2236921769.jpg 1600w, https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/7809x5208+0+0/resize/1800/quality/85/format/webp/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fad%2Fd8%2F93a37d384bd4896511fc1653400b%2Fgettyimages-2236921769.jpg 1800w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1025px) 650px, calc(100vw - 30px)\" type=\"image/webp\"></source>\n            <source srcset=\"https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/7809x5208+0+0/resize/400/quality/85/format/jpeg/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fad%2Fd8%2F93a37d384bd4896511fc1653400b%2Fgettyimages-2236921769.jpg 400w, https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/7809x5208+0+0/resize/600/quality/85/format/jpeg/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fad%2Fd8%2F93a37d384bd4896511fc1653400b%2Fgettyimages-2236921769.jpg 600w, https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/7809x5208+0+0/resize/800/quality/85/format/jpeg/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fad%2Fd8%2F93a37d384bd4896511fc1653400b%2Fgettyimages-2236921769.jpg 800w, https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/7809x5208+0+0/resize/900/quality/85/format/jpeg/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fad%2Fd8%2F93a37d384bd4896511fc1653400b%2Fgettyimages-2236921769.jpg 900w, https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/7809x5208+0+0/resize/1200/quality/85/format/jpeg/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fad%2Fd8%2F93a37d384bd4896511fc1653400b%2Fgettyimages-2236921769.jpg 1200w, https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/7809x5208+0+0/resize/1600/quality/85/format/jpeg/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fad%2Fd8%2F93a37d384bd4896511fc1653400b%2Fgettyimages-2236921769.jpg 1600w, https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/7809x5208+0+0/resize/1800/quality/85/format/jpeg/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fad%2Fd8%2F93a37d384bd4896511fc1653400b%2Fgettyimages-2236921769.jpg 1800w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1025px) 650px, calc(100vw - 30px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\"></source>\n            <img src=\"https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/7809x5208+0+0/resize/1100/quality/50/format/jpeg/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fad%2Fd8%2F93a37d384bd4896511fc1653400b%2Fgettyimages-2236921769.jpg\" alt=\"President Trump addresses a room full of world leaders from the U.N.'s New York City headquarters.\" />\n        </picture>\n</div>\n<div>\n    <div>\n        <p>\n                Trump addresses a room full of world leaders at the U.N.

Apparently, when the videographer reached the top, he inadvertently triggered a safety feature designed to keep people or objects from getting caught in the gearing, Dujarric said.</p>   <p>\"A subsequent investigation, including a readout of the machine's central processing unit, indicated that the escalator had stopped after a built-in safety mechanism on the comb step was triggered at the top of the escalator,\" he wrote.</p>   <p>The U.N. says the U.S. delegation is responsible for operating the president's teleprompter and referred questions to the White House. </p>   <p>In a statement to NPR, the White House said its staffers were \"prevented by UN staff\" from setting up the teleprompter prior to Trump's speech as promised, so were left \"trying to set the teleprompter up as the President was speaking.\"</p>   <p>Mike Waltz, the freshly confirmed U.S. ambassador to the U.N., <a href=\"https://x.com/USAmbUN/status/1970975737856581672\" target=\"_blank\">tweeted Wednesday</a> that the U.S. has asked the U.N. secretary-general to share a \"detailed explanation of the teleprompter failure's root cause, along with immediate plans to implement robust preventative measures.\"</p>   \n   <p>He also demanded the complete results of the U.N.'s internal investigation into the escalator malfunction, \"including who or what caused it to halt and whether it was intentional sabotage.\"</p>   <div>\n            <div>\n        <picture>\n            <source srcset=\"https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/4729x3153+0+0/resize/400/quality/85/format/webp/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F63%2Fca%2F53fa98ad495498f0360269b94666%2Fap25266547143484.jpg 400w, https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/4729x3153+0+0/resize/600/quality/85/format/webp/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F63%2Fca%2F53fa98ad495498f0360269b94666%2Fap25266547143484.jpg 600w, https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/4729x3153+0+0/resize/800/quality/85/format/webp/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F63%2Fca%2F53fa98ad495498f0360269b94666%2Fap25266547143484.jpg 800w, https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/4729x3153+0+0/resize/900/quality/85/format/webp/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F63%2Fca%2F53fa98ad495498f0360269b94666%2Fap25266547143484.jpg 900w, https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/4729x3153+0+0/resize/1200/quality/85/format/webp/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F63%2Fca%2F53fa98ad495498f0360269b94666%2Fap25266547143484.jpg 1200w, https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/4729x3153+0+0/resize/1600/quality/85/format/webp/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F63%2Fca%2F53fa98ad495498f0360269b94666%2Fap25266547143484.jpg 1600w, https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/4729x3153+0+0/resize/1800/quality/85/format/webp/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F63%2Fca%2F53fa98ad495498f0360269b94666%2Fap25266547143484.jpg 1800w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1025px) 650px, calc(100vw -

And she said, 'I couldn't hear a word you said.'\"</p>   \n   <p>But the U.N. says there's a logistical — and linguistic — reason Trump's speech may have sounded quiet to those in the room.</p>   <p>The sound system was designed to allow people at their seats to hear speeches being translated into six different languages through earpieces, a U.N. official said, speaking on condition of anonymity to discuss internal processes.</p>   <p>Waltz, the U.N. ambassador, called the series of incidents \"unacceptable and symptomatic of a broken institution that pose serious safety and security risks.\"</p>   \n   <p>\"The United States will not tolerate threats to our security or dignity at international forums,\" Waltz wrote in his Wednesday tweet. \"We expect swift cooperation and decisive action.\"</p>   <p><em>NPR's Michele Kelemen contributed reporting. </em></p>\n</div>"

But a lot of us have also taken pay cuts to do so and really have suffered a lot of damage to our careers.\"</p>   <p>While Beck says it's validating to read that Alsup found malfeasance in the government's actions, she's extremely frustrated that the relief he offered was so limited.</p>   <p>\"I think that from the outset, Judge Alsup really had his hands tied,\" she says. \"It seems like the judicial process is being undermined by a higher court.\"</p>   <h3>A victory in court offers little meaningful relief</h3>   <p>Through multiple decisions issued on its shadow docket, the conservative majority on the Supreme Court has made clear it believes the Constitution gives the president <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2025/09/22/nx-s1-5550307/supreme-court-ftc-firing\" target=\"_blank\">expansive powers over the executive branch</a>, including the power to hire and fire as he sees fit, despite federal law granting civil servants, including probationary employees, some job protections.</p>   \n   <p>Alsup has clearly taken notice. In April, the court vacated his temporary pause on the probationary firings, leading him to remark the next day in court, \"They are the boss.

He has gotten some initial interviews only to be told the companies are not interested in moving forward with him. Sometimes he hears nothing at all. NPR agreed not to name him, because he fears speaking out publicly could further complicate his efforts to get another job.</p>   \n   <p>Meanwhile, his attempts to get unemployment insurance through the state of New York, where he worked, have gone nowhere.

When he was hired by the government in 2024, he was told he was one of 1,300 applicants for three positions.</p>   <p>\"I was totally enjoying it, doing some meaningful work,\" the former government employee says. He'd received a strong performance review in January, shortly before he was fired.</p>   <p>He was looking forward to finding ways to use artificial intelligence to find inaccuracies in clinical data. Now, he's not sure whether someone else will pick up the work.

At times, he questioned whether government lawyers were telling him the truth.</p>   \n   <p>Back in March, White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt released a statement, accusing the judge of \"attempting to unconstitutionally seize the power of hiring and firing from the Executive Branch,\" and inviting him to run for president himself.</p>   \n   <p>In his Sept. 12 order, Alsup again chastised the government, this time for failing to produce key documents and records as required by the court, frustrating the judicial review process.</p>   <p>\"The 'administrative record' leaves the reader with the feeling that he is being led, blindfolded, along a carefully plotted path through a dense, unseen wood,\" Alsup wrote. \"Here and there, he may hear a rustle in the trees, feel the dark silhouette of a towering form, or intuit some other hint at the forest beyond, but never is he afforded an unfettered view of the landscape through which he passes.\"</p>   <h3>An order to set the record straight on performance</h3>   <div>\n            <div>\n        <picture>\n            <source srcset=\"https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/7788x5192+0+0/resize/400/quality/85/format/webp/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fe8%2F78%2F01a371b349338c72224f9272a277%2Fnpr-09-20-2025-0106.jpg 400w, https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/7788x5192+0+0/resize/600/quality/85/format/webp/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fe8%2F78%2F01a371b349338c72224f9272a277%2Fnpr-09-20-2025-0106.jpg 600w, https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/7788x5192+0+0/resize/800/quality/85/format/webp/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fe8%2F78%2F01a371b349338c72224f9272a277%2Fnpr-09-20-2025-0106.jpg 800w, https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/7788x5192+0+0/resize/900/quality/85/format/webp/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fe8%2F78%2F01a371b349338c72224f9272a277%2Fnpr-09-20-2025-0106.jpg 900w, https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/7788x5192+0+0/resize/1200/quality/85/format/webp/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fe8%2F78%2F01a371b349338c72224f9272a277%2Fnpr-09-20-2025-0106.jpg 1200w, https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/7788x5192+0+0/resize/1600/quality/85/format/webp/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fe8%2F78%2F01a371b349338c72224f9272a277%2Fnpr-09-20-2025-0106.jpg 1600w, https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/7788x5192+0+0/resize/1800/quality/85/format/webp/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fe8%2F78%2F01a371b349338c72224f9272a277%2Fnpr-09-20-2025-0106.jpg 1800w, https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/7788x5192+0+0/resize/2400/quality/85/format/webp/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fe8%2F78%2F01a371b349338c72224f9272a277%2Fnpr-09-20-2025-0106.jpg 2400w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1350px) 953px, (min-width: 1025px) calc(100vw -
