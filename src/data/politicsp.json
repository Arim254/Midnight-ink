I think we're going to test ABC out on this.\"</p>   <p>Kimmel was suspended by ABC and Disney last Wednesday after the Trump administration took issue with his comments about the suspect in Charlie Kirk's killing.</p>   <p>\"We hit some new lows over the weekend with the MAGA gang desperately trying to characterize this kid who murdered Charlie Kirk as anything other than one of them, and doing everything they can to score political points from it,\" Kimmel said on his show last Monday.</p>   \n   <p>Brendan Carr, chair of the Federal Communications Commission, wasn't pleased that the comedian had characterized the suspect as a MAGA conservative. \"We can do this the easy way or the hard way,\" he <a href=\"https://x.com/bennyjohnson/status/1968359685045838041\" target=\"_blank\">told podcaster Benny Johnson</a>, taking aim at ABC and Disney. \"These companies can find ways to take action on Kimmel or there is going to be additional work for the FCC ahead.\"</p>   <p>Carr encouraged local stations to push back and refuse to run <em>Jimmy Kimmel Live! </em></p>   <p>Nexstar and Sinclair, which operate ABC stations around the country, including in Nashville, Salt Lake City, New Orleans, Washington, D.C., Seattle, and Portland, Ore., both pulled the show off their airwaves. ABC and Disney then suspended Kimmel indefinitely.</p>   <p>This week, even after Disney said the host would return to his regular 11:35 p.m. ET timeslot on ABC, Sinclair and Nexstar said they would continue preempting the show.

Top House Democrat Hakeem Jeffries says that the Democrats' position isn't complicated.

Congress can sometimes work fast when confronted with a deadline, but there have been no talks so far to help in this process. Republicans say Democrats need to back a seven-week funding bill without other policy demands. Some Republicans believe that Congress should implement a form of health care subsidies, but say that it <a href=\"https://one.npr.org/?sharedMediaId=nx-s1-5552036:x\" target=\"_blank\">doesn't need to be connected to</a> the current must-pass funding bill.</li></ul>   <p><strong>At the United Nations General Assembly, Trump declared that Ukraine could reclaim all the territory it has lost to Russia. </strong>He believes this is achievable with support from the European Union and NATO. This is a <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2025/09/23/nx-s1-5551269/trump-ukraine-territory\" target=\"_blank\">significant shift from the president's long-held stance</a> that Kyiv would need to concede some territory to Moscow in order to end the war. <br /></p>   \n   <ul><li>🎧 <strong>Part of the reason for the shift is that Trump met with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and other European leaders at the U.N.</strong>, according to NPR's Michele Kelemen. Trump met with Russian President Vladimir Putin last month and informed the public that they had made progress. However, since then, Putin has ramped up attacks on Ukrainian cities. In recent weeks, Poland and Estonia have called emergency U.N. Security Council meetings because Russian drones entered Polish airspace and Russian jets were spotted in Estonia. Europeans say that this <a href=\"https://one.npr.org/?sharedMediaId=nx-s1-5552036:x\" target=\"_blank\">shows Russia is not interested in peace</a>. Kelemen adds that Trump may be recognizing that his friendship with Putin might not be enough to end the war.</li></ul>   <p><strong>Jimmy Kimmel last night received a standing ovation when he returned to television screens after his show was suspended for nearly a week.</strong> During his monologue, Kimmel was emotional as he thanked the network and those who support free speech. He went on to <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2025/09/24/nx-s1-5551277/jimmy-kimmel-live-abc-back-on-air-glen-powell-fcc-trump\" target=\"_blank\">try to make it clear</a> that it wasn't his intention to make light of Charlie Kirk's killing. He also referenced Erica Kirk expressing forgiveness to the man who killed her husband, saying she is an example we should all follow. <br /></p>   \n   <ul><li>🎧 <strong>Trump posted on social media that he couldn't believe that Kimmel is back on the air.</strong> NPR's Mandalit del Barco says it appears the president is threatening the ABC network. Last year, ABC settled a defamation lawsuit with Trump. Now he has posted that this situation seems <a href=\"https://one.npr.org/?sharedMediaId=nx-s1-5552036:x\" target=\"_blank\">more lucrative than last time</a>, when he received $16 million.</li><li>➡️<strong> Kimmel opened the show joking that he didn't know who had a weirder 48 hours: him or Tylenol. </strong>His comments come after the president suggested, without sufficient evidence, that a link exists between autism and acetaminophen, the painkiller's active ingredient.

To zero in on how AI is affecting our day-to-day experience,<em> It's Been a Minute</em> has introduced a new series <em>AI + U</em>. In \"Can you trust AI search results?\" host Brittany Luse discusses with NPR's Bobby Allyn what transparency means for a rapidly changing industry and whether AI is a tool for its users or its creators. They also talk about best practices when they come across AI-generated content.

You have probably even eaten a sea moss product and didn't even know it. It is often harvested for its carrageenan, which is used in the food industry as a thickening agent and an emulsifier in products like ice cream and puddings. Currently, the component can be found sold as pills, powders and gummies. But is there evidence to back up the hype? <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2025/09/22/nx-s1-5539099/sea-moss-supplements-health-nutrition-beauty\" target=\"_blank\">Here's what we know</a>. <br /></p>   \n   <ul><li>➡️ Most of the claims are based on cell or animal studies, which may not apply to humans. Human trials have been small and brief, says Dr. Melinda Ring at Northwestern University.</li><li>➡️ Sea moss in its whole form is a good source of fiber, antioxidants, vitamins and minerals like zinc, which do support gut health and the immune system, Ring says. However, those nutrients can be found in many other foods.</li><li>➡️ Consuming too much sea moss is a concern because it can accumulate heavy metals like arsenic, lead and mercury.</li><li>➡️ Another threat sea moss poses is its richness in iodine. Iodine is needed for good thyroid health, but too much can potentially trigger thyroid dysfunction.</li><li>➡️ If you are interested in trying sea moss, Ring advises eating it as a whole food or in gel form instead of taking supplements.</li></ul>   <h3>3 things to know before you go</h3>   <div>\n            <div>\n        <picture>\n            <source srcset=\"https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/1145x644+18+0/resize/400/quality/85/format/webp/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F79%2Ff8%2Fd6d12f884a35a1e26736e50c0768%2Fbooker.jpg 400w, https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/1145x644+18+0/resize/600/quality/85/format/webp/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F79%2Ff8%2Fd6d12f884a35a1e26736e50c0768%2Fbooker.jpg 600w, https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/1145x644+18+0/resize/800/quality/85/format/webp/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F79%2Ff8%2Fd6d12f884a35a1e26736e50c0768%2Fbooker.jpg 800w, https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/1145x644+18+0/resize/900/quality/85/format/webp/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F79%2Ff8%2Fd6d12f884a35a1e26736e50c0768%2Fbooker.jpg 900w, https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/1145x644+18+0/resize/1200/quality/85/format/webp/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F79%2Ff8%2Fd6d12f884a35a1e26736e50c0768%2Fbooker.jpg 1200w, https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/1145x644+18+0/resize/1600/quality/85/format/webp/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F79%2Ff8%2Fd6d12f884a35a1e26736e50c0768%2Fbooker.jpg 1600w, https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/1145x644+18+0/resize/1800/quality/85/format/webp/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F79%2Ff8%2Fd6d12f884a35a1e26736e50c0768%2Fbooker.jpg 1800w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1025px) 650px, calc(100vw - 30px)\" type=\"image/webp\"></source>\n            <source srcset=\"https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/1145x644+18+0/resize/400/quality/85/format/jpeg/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F79%2Ff8%2Fd6d12f884a35a1e26736e50c0768%2Fbooker.jpg 400w, https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/1145x644+18+0/resize/600/quality/85/format/jpeg/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F79%2Ff8%2Fd6d12f884a35a1e26736e50c0768%2Fbooker.jpg 600w, https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/1145x644+18+0/resize/800/quality/85/format/jpeg/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F79%2Ff8%2Fd6d12f884a35a1e26736e50c0768%2Fbooker.jpg 800w, https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/1145x644+18+0/resize/900/quality/85/format/jpeg/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F79%2Ff8%2Fd6d12f884a35a1e26736e50c0768%2Fbooker.jpg 900w, https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/1145x644+18+0/resize/1200/quality/85/format/jpeg/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F79%2Ff8%2Fd6d12f884a35a1e26736e50c0768%2Fbooker.jpg 1200w, https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/1145x644+18+0/resize/1600/quality/85/format/jpeg/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F79%2Ff8%2Fd6d12f884a35a1e26736e50c0768%2Fbooker.jpg 1600w, https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/1145x644+18+0/resize/1800/quality/85/format/jpeg/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F79%2Ff8%2Fd6d12f884a35a1e26736e50c0768%2Fbooker.jpg 1800w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1025px) 650px, calc(100vw - 30px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\"></source>\n            <img src=\"https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/1145x644+18+0/resize/1100/quality/50/format/jpeg/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F79%2Ff8%2Fd6d12f884a35a1e26736e50c0768%2Fbooker.jpg\" alt=\"Booker Prize 2025 shortlisted authors (left to right): Susan Choi, Andrew Miller, Kiran Desai, Ben Markovits, Katie Kitamura, David Szalay\" />\n        </picture>\n</div>\n<div>\n    <div>\n        <p>\n                Booker Prize 2025 shortlisted authors (left to right): Susan Choi, Andrew Miller, Kiran Desai, Ben Markovits, Katie Kitamura, David Szalay\n                <b>\n                    Premiere Scotland Ltd.\n                </b>\n                <b><b>hide caption</b></b>\n            </p>\n            <p><b><b>toggle caption</b></b>\n    </p></div>\n    <p><span>\n        Premiere Scotland Ltd.\n    </span>\n</p></div>\n   </div>\n   <ol><li>The six <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2025/09/23/nx-s1-5550983/booker-prize-shortlist-2025\" target=\"_blank\">authors shortlisted for the 2025 Booker Prize</a> are veterans, most of whom have published more than five books.

General Assembly, even suggesting that Ukraine could \"maybe even go further than that!\"</p>   \n   <p>The reversal is the latest example of how Trump has swung between deference, frustration and indirect threats against Russia. Early in his second term, Trump boasted that his close relationship with Russian President Vladimir Putin would help him broker a quick resolution to the conflict.</p>   <p>But as the war dragged on, Trump has grown increasingly frustrated with Putin. In July, during a meeting with the NATO Secretary General, Trump lashed out at Putin and announced that he was sending Patriot air defense missiles to Ukraine.</p>   \n   <p>As recently as last month – when Trump met Putin in Alaska to try to broker an end to the war – Trump had said he believed \"some land-swapping\" would take place. Zelenskyy <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2025/08/09/g-s1-81860/zelenskyy-rejects-ceding-ukrainian-territory\" target=\"_blank\"><u>has been resistant</u></a> to that idea.</p>   \n   <p>Afterward, Trump said the two countries needed to discuss \"the possible exchanges of territory, taking into consideration the current line of contact. That means, the war zone.\"</p>   <p>But since the Alaska talks, there have been no signs that Putin is willing to meet Zelenskyy. Russia has ramped up its strikes on Ukraine, and there have been a <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2025/09/21/nx-s1-5549406/russia-nato-plane-baltic-sea-germany-sweden\" target=\"_blank\"><u>series of incursions</u></a> by Russian military aircraft into NATO airspace in the month since the talks.</p>   <p>Trump said he thinks NATO members should shoot down Russian aircraft in such cases. \"Yes, I do,\" he said in answer to a question from a reporter.</p>   \n   <p>Asked whether he would back up NATO allies if that happened, Trump said: \"Depends on the circumstance, but you know we're very strong toward NATO.\"</p>   <p>In his social media post, Trump said Russia looks like \"a paper tiger\" because the war has dragged on for so long, and said that the United States would continue to supply weapons to NATO. \"Good luck to all!\" Trump said.</p>   <p>Trump has so far resisted calls for tougher sanctions, insisting that European leaders first need to stop buying oil from Russia, as well as apply steep tariffs for major buyers of Russian oil, like China.</p>   \n   <p>In a pointed speech to world leaders at the United Nations General Assembly on Tuesday, Trump said it was inexcusable that some NATO members were still buying Russian energy. \"Think of it: they're funding the war against themselves. Who the hell ever heard of that one?\"</p>   <p>Zelenskyy said he was hoping to see more sanctions on Russia, and said he supported <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2025/09/13/nx-s1-5540664/trump-russia-sanctions-nato-ukraine\" target=\"_blank\">Trump's push to get NATO members to stop buying Russian energy</a>.</p>   <p>Zelenskyy said he had spoken with Slovakia's prime minister who seemed open to cutting off its imports. \"I'm not sure the Hungarians are ready,\" Zelenskyy said. Trump said he hasn't spoken to Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban about it yet. \"I had a feeling if I did, he might stop,\" Trump said.</p>\n</div>"

But New York voters will also weigh in on a lesser-known <a href=\"https://www.nyc.gov/site/charter/news/2025-nyc-charter-revision-commission-adopts-five-ballot-proposals.page\" target=\"_blank\">proposal</a> that could move future city elections to even-numbered years.</p>   <p>It's part of a growing trend to consolidate election dates — adding local races to the ballot during presidential and midterm elections.</p>   <p>Proponents of the effort say it counters persistently low turnout for local elections, despite concerns about local issues and candidates getting overshadowed.</p>   <p>Right now, most local races across the country — for things like city council, school board and bond measures — are \"off-cycle,\" or don't coincide with federal elections, according to Katy Owens Hubler, director of elections and redistricting at the National Conference of State Legislatures.</p>   \n   <p>\"So, all throughout the year, you know, any given Tuesday, there's probably an election somewhere in the country,\" she said.</p>   \n   <p>Many states require in their constitution that local races be separate from federal and state elections. About a third of states leave it up to local officials to decide when to have local elections, said Zoli Hajnal, a political science professor at UC San Diego. And most local officials choose to have their elections during odd-numbered years.</p>   <p>\"I think it's the sort of feeling of not wanting to get lost in the shuffle,\" said Hubler, adding that city leaders often worry their smaller contests and local issues will be overshadowed by bigger races.</p>   <p>\"There could also be a campaign finance aspect of this where they feel that they can't actually raise the funds that they need to run a campaign because they're competing with the state-level candidates or even national-level candidates,\" she said.</p>   <h3>A main driver for reform: \"extremely low\" turnout</h3>   <p>Holding local races in odd-numbered years, though, has resulted in what Hajnal describes as \"extremely low\" turnout — and it's only gotten worse over the past several decades.</p>   <p>\"And there is essentially no better solution to low voter turnout at the local level than moving local elections to the same day as statewide and federal elections,\" he said.</p>   \n   <p>Hajnal uses Las Vegas as <a href=\"https://www.ncsl.org/state-legislatures-news/details/when-it-comes-to-turnout-in-local-elections-timing-matters\" target=\"_blank\">an example</a>. When the Nevada Legislature first gave cities the option to move their local races to even-numbered years, very few cities made the change. Turnout in Las Vegas averaged about 37,000. But once it was required in 2019, the first election on-cycle saw more than 244,000 Las Vegas voters cast ballots.</p>   <div>\n            <div>\n        <picture>\n            <source srcset=\"https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/5170x3689+0+0/resize/400/quality/85/format/webp/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F40%2F40%2F26ebdf034782a7cd9d1a50db3bf3%2Fgettyimages-2221179994.jpg 400w, https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/5170x3689+0+0/resize/600/quality/85/format/webp/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F40%2F40%2F26ebdf034782a7cd9d1a50db3bf3%2Fgettyimages-2221179994.jpg 600w, https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/5170x3689+0+0/resize/800/quality/85/format/webp/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F40%2F40%2F26ebdf034782a7cd9d1a50db3bf3%2Fgettyimages-2221179994.jpg 800w, https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/5170x3689+0+0/resize/900/quality/85/format/webp/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F40%2F40%2F26ebdf034782a7cd9d1a50db3bf3%2Fgettyimages-2221179994.jpg 900w, https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/5170x3689+0+0/resize/1200/quality/85/format/webp/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F40%2F40%2F26ebdf034782a7cd9d1a50db3bf3%2Fgettyimages-2221179994.jpg 1200w, https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/5170x3689+0+0/resize/1600/quality/85/format/webp/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F40%2F40%2F26ebdf034782a7cd9d1a50db3bf3%2Fgettyimages-2221179994.jpg 1600w, https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/5170x3689+0+0/resize/1800/quality/85/format/webp/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F40%2F40%2F26ebdf034782a7cd9d1a50db3bf3%2Fgettyimages-2221179994.jpg 1800w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1025px) 650px, calc(100vw - 30px)\" type=\"image/webp\"></source>\n            <source srcset=\"https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/5170x3689+0+0/resize/400/quality/85/format/jpeg/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F40%2F40%2F26ebdf034782a7cd9d1a50db3bf3%2Fgettyimages-2221179994.jpg 400w, https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/5170x3689+0+0/resize/600/quality/85/format/jpeg/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F40%2F40%2F26ebdf034782a7cd9d1a50db3bf3%2Fgettyimages-2221179994.jpg 600w, https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/5170x3689+0+0/resize/800/quality/85/format/jpeg/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F40%2F40%2F26ebdf034782a7cd9d1a50db3bf3%2Fgettyimages-2221179994.jpg 800w, https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/5170x3689+0+0/resize/900/quality/85/format/jpeg/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F40%2F40%2F26ebdf034782a7cd9d1a50db3bf3%2Fgettyimages-2221179994.jpg 900w, https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/5170x3689+0+0/resize/1200/quality/85/format/jpeg/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F40%2F40%2F26ebdf034782a7cd9d1a50db3bf3%2Fgettyimages-2221179994.jpg 1200w, https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/5170x3689+0+0/resize/1600/quality/85/format/jpeg/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F40%2F40%2F26ebdf034782a7cd9d1a50db3bf3%2Fgettyimages-2221179994.jpg 1600w, https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/5170x3689+0+0/resize/1800/quality/85/format/jpeg/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F40%2F40%2F26ebdf034782a7cd9d1a50db3bf3%2Fgettyimages-2221179994.jpg 1800w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1025px) 650px, calc(100vw - 30px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\"></source>\n            <img src=\"https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/5170x3689+0+0/resize/1100/quality/50/format/jpeg/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F40%2F40%2F26ebdf034782a7cd9d1a50db3bf3%2Fgettyimages-2221179994.jpg\" alt=\"A person, alongside their dog, votes at a polling location at Louis D.

You also get more racial and ethnic minority voters, people of color, and potentially also some greater mix of working class and poor Americans participating as well.\"</p>   <h3>More elections mean higher costs</h3>   <p>In recent years, efforts to boost turnout have been <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2024/11/18/nx-s1-5183063/trump-turnout-republican-voting-access\" target=\"_blank\">typically associated with the political left</a>. But some conservative groups, such as the American Legislative Exchange Council, or ALEC, agree with consolidating elections.</p>   <p>Though ALEC has called for some restrictions on voting, <a href=\"https://alec.org/model-policy/voter-id-citizenship-on-id-act/\" target=\"_blank\">such as strict voter ID laws</a>, the organization wants more eligible voters to participate, said Katie Thompson, a director at ALEC.</p>   <p>Thompson said ALEC is <a href=\"https://alec.org/model-policy/the-school-board-election-date-act/\" target=\"_blank\">recommending GOP-led states move their local races</a> to on-cycle elections as a cost-saving measure as well. She noted that local governments have to spend a lot of money on local elections on things like paper, electricity and staffing.</p>   <p>\"Even when you're looking at the volunteers required to staff elections, it is way harder to get the personnel you need during off-cycle years,\" she said. \"And personnel is really important to the security of elections, which I think we can all agree is an important factor. We want the polls to be adequately staffed.\"</p>   <p><a href=\"https://www.ncsl.org/state-legislatures-news/details/a-move-toward-fewer-elections-with-more-on-the-ballots\" target=\"_blank\">This year</a> 29 states introduced legislation aimed at consolidating election dates in some way or another, including Democratic-run states such as <a href=\"https://www.spokesman.com/stories/2025/feb/22/washington-legislature-considers-allowing-local-el/\" target=\"_blank\">Washington</a> and Republican-run states like <a href=\"https://www.wfyi.org/news/articles/hoosiers-weigh-in-on-moving-municipal-elections-to-even-numbered-years-at-public-meeting\" target=\"_blank\">Indiana</a>. And so far, 12 states have enacted these laws.</p>   \n   <p>If passed this fall, New York City's ballot measure would <a href=\"https://www.nyc.gov/site/charter/news/2025-nyc-charter-revision-commission-adopts-five-ballot-proposals.page\" target=\"_blank\">require a change</a> to the state constitution before it could go into effect.</p>   \n   <p>Hajnal said this uptick in discussions about election timing is somewhat unprecedented.</p>   <p>\"There's absolutely no doubt there's a major trend towards consolidation or aligning elections,\" he said. \"It's getting a lot more attention and a lot more action and at least looks like into the future a lot more momentum for further reform.\"</p>   <p>Besides the cost and low turnout, there is also the concern that all these scattered elections create a lot of work for election administrators, Hubler said.</p>   <p>\"There's all these things that you have to do for a regular election anyway. And now you can just do that once as opposed to a number of different times for the smaller races,\" she said.</p>   <h3>One concern: Longer ballots</h3>   <p>There are concerns, however, about consolidated elections leading to longer ballots, which cost more and can cause longer lines at polling signs or overwhelm voters.</p>   <p>Hajnal said they could also create a situation where voters will get tired and just skip those local races at the end of their ballot, anyway.</p>   <p>\"Yes, there is some ballot drop-off,\" he said. \"So the longer the ballot, the more people who drop off. But the jump in participation is so high that it much more than offsets that small ballot drop-off.\"</p>   <p>Thompson said the longer ballot would probably be worth it to voters.</p>   <p>\"The extra few minutes it would take to fill out the next two or three races on the ballot is still less time than knowing that there's an election, driving to the polls, voting, driving all the way home,\" she said. \"It would just be more convenient for people to have those elections on one ballot in a consolidated place versus having to go to all this extra time and expense and effort to go for a whole separate election cycle.\"</p>\n</div>"

It said that in order to secure seats for High Holidays services — the holiest days of the Jewish year — you must show proof of voter registration.</p>   <p>The synagogue's letter comes weeks before New York City's mayoral election on November 4. It reads in part, \"We believe we must put in our best effort to try to avoid a very serious danger that can affect all of us.\"</p>   \n   <p>The letter does not mention any candidate by name. Nor does it tell congregants what party to register with, or who to vote for or against. But it does warn that the outcome of the election could result in \"very serious problems\" for the Jewish community, and that as a result the synagogue had no choice but to make this requirement.</p>   <p>Shaare Zion is the largest Syrian synagogue in New York City, and an important and influential part of the Sephardic Jewish community. That includes Jews with roots in the Iberian Peninsula, and sometimes Mizrahi Jews from the Middle East and North Africa.</p>   <h3>Synagogue-state relations</h3>   <p>Scholars who study church-state relations say they cannot recall another house of worship ever taking this kind of step.</p>   <p>\"Asking a congregant to register with the implications that it's for the mayoral election in a Jewish congregation implies very much a divine sanction for voting and perhaps leaning one way or the other,\" said <a href=\"https://religiousstudies.wustl.edu/people/mark-valeri\" target=\"_blank\">Mark Valeri</a>, professor of religion and politics at Washington University in St. Louis.</p>   <p>\"My surmise is there is fear of [Zohran] Mamdani being elected,\" said Valeri.</p>   <p>Mark Treyger is CEO of the Jewish Community Relations Council and a former city councilmember who represented the south Brooklyn district that includes Shaare Zion. He says the concerns raised in the letter are ones he's heard elsewhere about Mamdani, who <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2025/06/25/nx-s1-5444734/zohran-mamdani-set-to-defeat-cuomo-in-nyc-mayoral-primary-upset\" target=\"_blank\">won the Democratic primary in June</a>.</p>   \n   <p>\"Given his victory, it has compounded existing concerns that were raised before this primary occurred about public safety and the future of policing and how to handle protests and how to protect shuls [synagogues] and schools,\" said Treyger.</p>   <h3>Is it religiously permissible?</h3>   <p>Even with these concerns in mind, there are lingering questions about a synagogue's ability to require voter registration.</p>   <p>Valeri says because of the letter's careful wording — it doesn't name a candidate or tell people how to vote — there's no obvious legal issue with it.</p>   <p>Religiously, the question is different.</p>   <p>\"It is terribly unusual,\" said <a href=\"https://www.yu.edu/faculty/pages/bleich-j\" target=\"_blank\">Rabbi David Bleich</a>, a high ranking and respected rabbinical authority at Yeshiva University in New York. \"The question isn't whether it's unusual — it's whether it's permissible.\"</p>   <p>By \"permissible,\" Bleich means according to Jewish law.</p>   <p>\"On what grounds would a religious organization impose all sorts of conditions that have nothing to do with religion or spirituality?\" said Bleich.</p>   <p>Rabbi Bleich says synagogues often have membership requirements. And — he thinks people <em>should </em>vote. But combining the two – having requirements in order to attend services? It doesn't sit well with him.</p>   <p>\"The only way they can even work under any kind of color of religious right is by claiming that these people are in violation of a religious duty,\" said Bleich. \"And I respond by asking — do you require that any Jew entering be a Sabbath observer also? It's a little bit ludicrous.\"</p>\n</div>"

The move comes as other top Democrats have shied away from Mamdani, despite his landslide win in the Democratic primary in June.</p>   <p>\"Look as far as I'm concerned he's the Democratic nominee and he should be supported,\" <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwt7hMaNaBQ\" target=\"_blank\">Harris said during an appearance Monday on MSNBC</a>, but she also appeared to downplay his national significance. \"He's not the only star,\" Harris said.</p>   <p>Harris's backing is notable as many Democratic Party leaders have so far declined to back Mamdani, a member of the Democratic Socialist Party who has been critical of Israel's war in Gaza, which began after Hamas's deadly terror attack on Oct. 7, 2023.  </p>   \n   <p>Speaking this month with the New York Times, <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/09/12/nyregion/mamdani-arrest-netanyahu-nyc-mayor.html\" target=\"_blank\">Mamdani said he would order the NYPD to arrest Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu</a> on international war crime charges if the Israeli leader entered New York City.</p>   <p>\"This is something that I intend to fulfill,\" Mr. Mamdani told the Times.  This month, an international UN commission concluded Israel has committed genocide in Gaza, an accusation Israeli officials reject.</p>   <p>Some Democratic leaders have also distanced themselves from Mamdani <a href=\"https://www.zohranfornyc.com/platform\" target=\"_blank\">because of his progressive stance on economic policies</a>, including a call for a rent freeze, free childcare, and higher taxes for the wealthy and corporations.</p>   <p>\"Socialism does not work and his proposed plans would make New York a less competitive city and state,' <a href=\"https://x.com/Tom_Suozzi/status/1967543930846650392\" target=\"_blank\">said Rep. Tom Suozzi</a>, a moderate Democratic congressman from Long Island who announced he won't back Mamdani.</p>   <p>New York's Democratic Governor Kathy Hochul <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/09/14/opinion/hochul-endorsement-mamdani.html\" target=\"_blank\">endorsed Mamdani in an editorial in the New York Times</a> earlier this month, describing him as \"a leader who is focused on making New York City affordable — a goal I enthusiastically support.\"</p>   <p>Mamdani has also won strong backing from progressive leaders, including Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, a Democrat who represents parts of the Bronx and Queens, and Sen. Bernie Sanders, an independent from Vermont.</p>   \n   <p>But two of the country's most powerful Democrats, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer and House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, both from New York, have so far declined to back Mamdani's bid to lead the nation's largest city.</p>   <p>The chair of New York's state Democratic Party, <a href=\"https://x.com/npfandos/status/1968730967943581877\" target=\"_blank\">Jay Jacobs, also released a statement</a> earlier this month saying he would refuse to back Mamdani because of their sharply differing views on Israel and other policy issues. </p>   <p>\"I reject the platform of the so-called 'Democratic Socialists of America' and do not believe that it represents the principles, values or policies of the Democratic Party,\" Jacobs wrote.</p>   <p>Polls show Mamdani holds a commanding lead in the mayor's race against a packed field that includes current Mayor Eric Adams, former Democratic Governor Andrew Cuomo and Republican Curtis Sliwa.  </p>   <p><a href=\"https://sri.siena.edu/2025/09/09/new-york-times-siena-poll-new-york-city-mayoral-race/?_gl=1*1l734sv*_ga*MTU5MzUxNTA5Mi4xNzU4NjMyNDgx*_ga_XN3VDZ9ZYZ*czE3NTg2MzI0ODAkbzEkZzAkdDE3NTg2MzI0ODAkajYwJGwwJGgw\" target=\"_blank\">A Sept. 9 survey by the Siena Research Institute</a> found Mamdani at 46 percent in a four-way race,  with Cuomo in second place at 24 percent, Sliwa at 15 percent and Adams with 9 percent. </p>   <p>Some Democrats who back Mamdani have been fiercely critical of party leaders who've stayed on the sidelines. After Jacobs announced that he wouldn't endorse his party's candidate, state Senator Mike Gianaris called the decision \"disgraceful.\"</p>   <p>\"The chair of the Democratic Party refusing to support the candidate clearly selected by the voters of the Democratic Party,\" <a href=\"https://x.com/SenGianaris/status/1968734432602227150\" target=\"_blank\">Gianaris wrote on the social media platform X</a>. \"If he won't perform that most basic responsibility of a party leader, what exactly is he doing over there?\"</p>\n</div>"
