    "body": "<div>\n      <p>A handful of states led by Democrats could have attempted mid-decade redistricting to counter President Trump's push in GOP-led states, but aside from California, they have been slow to act.</p>   \n</div><div>\n    <p>AILSA CHANG, HOST: </p><p> President Trump has repeatedly called for Republican-led states to redraw their congressional districts before next year's midterms. Texas did so, Missouri's new map awaits the governor's signature, and leaders in Florida and Indiana are openly discussing it. Democratic-led states have mostly been slow to act in response. Colorado Public Radio's Bente Birkeland reports from her state.</p><p>BENTE BIRKELAND, BYLINE: California voters will decide this November whether to temporarily bypass their independent redistricting commission to draw five more blue seats. And in August, Governor Gavin Newsom made a plea. He asked blue states to join California's fight against GOP gerrymandering.</p><p>(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)</p><p>GAVIN NEWSOM: We need to stand up. Not just California. Other blue states need to stand up.</p><p>(CHEERING)</p><p>NEWSOM: We need to be firm. And I resolve...</p><p>BIRKELAND: But that hasn't happened. Democratic governors in already-gerrymandered states like Illinois and Maryland have said everything's on the table, but haven't made any moves. Then there's Colorado. Like California, it has an independent redistricting commission. Multimillionaire businessman Kent Thiry helped spearhead the movement in those two states. He says this national partisan battle is like his worst nightmare coming true.</p><p>KENT THIRY: Anyone who treasures representative democracy and the fragility of representative democracy has to be just horrified at what is happening right now.</p><p>BIRKELAND: Thiry says even though he doesn't want Colorado to follow California's lead...</p><p>THIRY: I am not critical of those who have decided that right now they're in a gunfight and you can't unilaterally disarm. I respect that logic, I just won't be an active part of it.</p><p>BIRKELAND: In Colorado, Democrats control state government and hold both U.S. Senate seats, but the House delegation is four Democrats and four Republicans. Some political observers say, in theory, it wouldn't be that hard to draw two more seats favorable to Democrats. However, Colorado Governor Jared Polis told progressive podcaster Brian Tyler Cohen that it's impossible to change how the state draws congressional lines before the midterm election.</p><p>(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)</p><p>JARED POLIS: Our state constitution has a process. That cannot be amended in an off year. So there is no mechanism to go to the ballot this year, like California is doing.</p><p>BIRKELAND: That means 2026 is the earliest something could get on the ballot. But changing how Colorado redistricts to make it partisan isn't an idea Polis seems to support. And he doesn't think voters would, either.</p><p>(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)</p><p>POLIS: They see through this. And swing voters, unaffiliated voters really don't like this kind of sheer arrogance.</p><p>BIRKELAND: Polis says he thinks Democrats can flip seats by focusing on other things, like the impact of Trump's massive tax and spending bill.</p><p>(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)</p><p>POLIS: This is going to be an albatross around the neck of all the Republicans that voted for it.</p><p>BIRKELAND: But outside of Colorado's political establishment, some on the left do want to fight back. Jorge Rodriguez is an accountant from the northern part of the state. He's trying to put a question on the 2026 ballot to allow Colorado to draw more blue seats. Rodriguez says his idea gained traction after he posted about it on Reddit.</p><p>JORGE RODRIGUEZ: Kind of frustrated why Democratic leaders in Colorado are not trying to do anything. They're just playing it silent.</p><p>BIRKELAND: Rodriguez's idea still faces hurdles. The ballot title hasn't been approved, and then backers would need to raise money to get enough signatures to put it before voters and launch a statewide campaign. Rodriguez himself voted for Colorado's independent commission back in 2018.</p><p>RODRIGUEZ: I don't regret it, but in light of what's going on right now nationally, I - you know, things can change. And things have changed.</p><p>BIRKELAND: But if change happens in Colorado - and that's a big if - the state will have to wait until after 2026.</p><p>For NPR News, I'm Bente Birkeland in Colorado.</p><p>(SOUNDBITE OF HERMANOS GUTIERREZ'S \"AMAR Y VIVIR\")</p>\n    <p>Copyright © 2025 NPR.

    "body": "<div>\n      <p>Hundreds of thousands of conservatives attended right wing activist Charlie Kirk's memorial service. Many now wonder who will fill the shoes of this influential voice in the conservative movement.</p>   \n</div><div>\n    <p>AILSA CHANG, HOST: </p><p> Yesterday, tens of thousands of people gathered at State Farm Stadium in Glendale, Arizona, for the memorial of Charlie Kirk. The right-wing activist founded the conservative youth organization Turning Point USA at the age of 18, and he was a major figure in Republican politics when he was killed at the age of 31. Many in the MAGA world are now sorting through what is next for his movement. NPR political reporter Elena Moore joins us now from Phoenix, Arizona. Hi, Elena.</p><p>ELENA MOORE, BYLINE: Hey, Ailsa.</p><p>CHANG: OK, let's start with Turning Point USA. Where might that group go without Charlie Kirk, you think?</p><p>MOORE: It's a really complicated question to answer because so much of Turning Point's draw was built on Kirk's own personality and leadership. They're big shoes to fill, and no single person can replace him, says Turning Point spokesman Andrew Kolvet.</p><p>ANDREW KOLVET: I think that would be the worst way to analyze this situation. The right way to analyze this situation is to say, what can I do? And I will tell you, it's the total refrain in the office right now. It's like, what would Charlie have wanted in this moment?</p><p>MOORE: And he told me that Kirk's team is stepping up, you know, led by his widow, Erika Kirk, who was named the new CEO of Turning Point last week.</p><p>CHANG: Yeah, Erika Kirk has been really thrown into the spotlight now. Like, do we have a sense of what kind of leader she might be?</p><p>MOORE: Well, she's no stranger to the public eye or the Turning Point movement. She already had a large social media following before Kirk's death, talking about her Christian faith and her family, but she appears to also be a very skilled messenger, especially on those ideas. That was especially clear during her speech at the memorial, when she emphasized Kirk's work with young people especially, and told young men to, quote, \"accept Charlie's challenge and embrace true manhood.\"</p><p>(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)</p><p>ERIKA KIRK: Be strong and courageous for your families. Love your wives and lead them.</p><p>MOORE: And she also made this point.</p><p>(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)</p><p>KIRK: Your wife is not your slave. She is your helper. You are not rivals.</p><p>MOORE: And, you know, she had several notable moments, even at one point saying she forgave the young man who is accused of killing Charlie Kirk, her husband, bringing many people to tears. So it's clear she's already had some impact. But again, Turning Point is not expecting her to push their larger message alone. Notably, since Kirk died, we've seen some of the most prominent voices in the MAGA world step in to host his show nearly every day. And now many are also expected to speak as part of Turning Point's college tour, which Kirk had just kicked off when he was killed.</p><p>CHANG: OK, so lots of attention from top conservative voices, but is that translating to the grassroots level, where Kirk first had an impact?</p><p>MOORE: I think supporters and staff are hopeful. Turning Point has had tens of thousands of inquiries from young people looking to get involved or start chapters. But even outside the organization, we've seen young people ramp up their own efforts to keep Kirk's style of campus debate alive. Twenty-five-year-old content creator Cam Higby is - he's part of a small group that decided to travel together to different campuses, visiting campuses. And I talked to them while they were on the road, and here's how he described their goals.</p><p>CAM HIGBY: Show them you're not afraid, it's OK to talk to people who disagree with you, and honor Charlie. Those are the - I think, the three tiers of what we're trying to accomplish.</p><p>MOORE: We're also just going to start seeing more activism inspired by Kirk, I think. I talked to several young people at his memorial who said they're pushing themselves to be less afraid of sharing their political views, even if that means, Ailsa, losing friends. One young woman told me that Kirk gave her a voice, but now she has to, quote, \"stand up for herself.\"</p><p>CHANG: That is NPR's Elena Moore in Phoenix, Arizona. Thank you so much, Elena.</p><p>MOORE: Good to be with you.</p>\n    <p>Copyright © 2025 NPR.  All rights reserved.

He was scheduled to join Kirk tonight at a Turning Point USA event at the University of Minnesota. Instead, he is now headlining the event alone. Michael Knowles, welcome, and I'm sorry for the loss of your friend.</p><p>MICHAEL KNOWLES: Oh, thank you very much. I appreciate it. And it's good to be with you.</p><p>KELLY: I know you were there at this big memorial service in Arizona yesterday. What will you take from that? What was your impression?</p><p>KNOWLES: It was striking in so many ways. Charlie's widow, Erika, gave one of the most powerful speeches I've ever heard, as we just heard a clip of. It was a magnificent expression of Christian charity and forgiveness. And to see all of these hardened politicians show up and proclaim a beautiful gospel message was something that in previous ages would not have been unusual in our country, but these days is rare. And so it was just remarkable and uplifting in so many ways.</p><p>KELLY: May I ask, do you share that spirit of forgiveness that Erika Kirk so eloquently expressed?</p><p>KNOWLES: I do. I think she exhibited it in really a superhuman way. But with whatever I can muster, I certainly agree with it. And of course, this does not come to the exclusion of justice. You know, the civil authority has the right and the responsibility to carry out justice. But we should not hate our enemies.</p><p>KELLY: So I do need to note that President Trump also spoke last night. He took a rather different approach and a different tone. He said - and he was speaking of Charlie Kirk - he said...</p><p>(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)</p><p>PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: He did not hate his opponents. He wanted the best for them. That's where I disagreed with Charlie. I hate my opponent. And I don't want the best for them. I'm sorry.</p><p>KELLY: Michael Knowles, is that helpful in this moment?</p><p>KNOWLES: I think it is because it was a joke. And it was understood to be a joke in the room. He even...</p><p>KELLY: He didn't sound like he was joking.</p><p>KNOWLES: I think he did. I think - he said afterward, he said, Charlie's looking down at me. He's angry at me for saying that. Maybe Erika can talk to me. I think it was an expression of humility, of a fall in human nature, and, by contrast, pointing to the alternative and saying, you know, what Erika and Charlie were talking about - that's the right thing. Maybe someday I'll get there.</p><p>KELLY: So let me turn you to tonight. I mentioned you will be headlining this event. I saw your post on social media that you plan for this to be a tribute. And you said, the enemies of civilization will not succeed at killing his mission. They will not even succeed at killing his tour. What will be your message tonight, and have you changed it at all because of what's happened?</p><p>KNOWLES: Well, I'm certainly reacting to Erika's beautiful speech and really what was a beautiful event yesterday. But the substance of it remains the same. You know, Charlie went out into hostile places where people really hated him, and he had a civil dialogue with them. He was always generous. He was always respectful. He would argue with his friends and he would be generous and respectful. And we're going to do that, and we're going to encourage people who disagree to come to the front of the line.</p><p>KELLY: Stay with us for a minute and the idea that people, especially those who disagreed, are welcome at these events and welcome in conversation because Charlie Kirk, your friend, has been portrayed as an advocate of free speech, of engaging with people who held really different political views than he did. What do you think he would have made of some of the developments of recent days? I'm thinking of Attorney General Pam Bondi's attack on hate speech or of the chair of the FCC, Brendan Carr, threatening TV stations with fines or with losing their license if they continue to carry Jimmy Kimmel's show.</p><p>KNOWLES: Well, I certainly wouldn't presume to speak for Charlie. You know, Charlie ran his course. And I find it unseemly to try to speak for the dead. We do know he publicly opposed the idea of hate speech. And so I think that was an unfortunate phrase. Now, of course, there are plenty of kinds of speech. There are...</p><p>KELLY: But he said even that is protected by the First Amendment.</p><p>KNOWLES: Well, something called hate speech, but that's not - as Charlie observed, that's not even a legal concept in America. Certain hateful ideas can be debated, but certain things are unlawful, like direct threats, incitement to violence and all the rest. So that certainly should be prosecuted in order to defend the free marketplace of ideas. But distasteful ideas can be debated, certainly.</p><p>As for the FCC, I won't presume to speak for Charlie on the issue other than to observe the FCC exists for a reason, is to regulate the public airwaves and to give licenses and to revoke licenses from corporations that use them. So there's nothing wrong in principle, and it's actually the responsibility of the government in principle, to regulate those airwaves. And in terms of the specific incident of Jimmy Kimmel, it seems to me that came much more from the affiliates canceling him over his repugnant lie about the assassination of Charlie rather than any government pressure.</p><p>KELLY: Well, and I can play what he actually said.</p><p>(SOUNDBITE OF TV SHOW, \"JIMMY KIMMEL LIVE!\")</p><p>JIMMY KIMMEL: We hit some new lows over the weekend with the MAGA gang desperately trying to characterize this kid who murdered Charlie Kirk as anything other than one of them and doing everything they can to score political points from it.</p><p>KELLY: That's what he actually said.</p><p>KNOWLES: And that was a lie. That was a lie because the alleged shooter was on the left. I'm not surprised that the affiliates wanted to cancel his show.</p><p>KELLY: I guess I'm interested. You know, we've just been talking about President Trump's remarks last night, which you interpreted as a joke. Some other people may hear that and disagree strongly. But you're defending the use of humor, even in a situation like last night. Do you also defend the right of someone to use humor on television even if you really don't like what they said?</p><p>KNOWLES: I'm certainly fine defending Jimmy Kimmel's bad jokes. But what I take issue with is not his joke that came at the end of that monologue. What I take issue with is his lie that said that the assassin who murdered Charlie Kirk was on the right rather than on the left, in - contrary to all of the available evidence.</p><p>KELLY: Just want to note, I don't think he said he was on the right. Can I turn us to something else? Tonight, do you have concerns about security?</p><p>KNOWLES: It's always prudent to be a little bit concerned, especially with all of this violence. I myself have been targeted by left-wing violence. So we're concerned, but we're taking it seriously. And more importantly, I think it would greatly dishonor Charlie's legacy if we cowered, if we let them silence us. So that will not happen. And if Charlie's friends can muster even an iota of the courage that he demonstrated, I think that will do him some honor, and I think it would be very salutary for the country.</p><p>KELLY: Michael Knowles. He hosts \"The Michael Knowles Show,\" and tonight, as you heard, he's headlining Charlie Kirk's American Comeback Tour with an event at the University of Minnesota. Thank you.</p><p>KNOWLES: Wonderful to be with you. Thank you for having me.</p><p>(SOUNDBITE OF RENE AUBRY'S \"WATER FALLS\")</p>\n    <p>Copyright © 2025 NPR.  All rights reserved.

The survey has been published annually for 30 years, throughout both Republican and Democratic administrations.</p>   \n   <p>Ross thinks that the higher job requirements people have to meet to access SNAP benefits, and the resulting rise in food insecurity, is the likely motive behind the Trump administration scrapping the report.</p>   <p>\"This will substantially increase food insecurity, and unfortunately, that will make itself clear in the data of food insecurity reports in the next couple of years,\" Ross said.</p>   <p>The USDA did not respond to questions from NPR about the reasons behind the report's cancellation.</p>   <p>The last report will be released on Oct. 22, according to <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/trump-ending-america-hunger-report-snap-cuts-750f90757f50ab2d8bc97dfca5a917dd\" target=\"_blank\">The Associated Press</a>.

Harris believes she was loyal to the Bidens, but says the feeling wasn't mutual</strong></h3>   <p>Loyalty is one of the underlying themes in Harris' book. It's even laid out in one of the introduction quotes before the memoir begins from Kendrick Lamar's \"DNA\": \"I got loyalty, got royalty inside my DNA.\"</p>   \n   <p>Harris writes of times that Biden, his family and his senior staff in the West Wing questioned whether Harris truly was loyal, while her own frustrations mounted from the president's staff not speaking up to defend her from outside criticism. </p>   <p>In the tumultuous weeks after Biden's disastrous debate performance last summer — when high-profile Democrats began to question his ability to beat Trump — first lady Jill Biden pulled aside Harris' husband, Second Gentleman Doug Emhoff, to ask if they were standing by the Bidens. Harris says that irked Emhoff. </p>   <p>In another instance, two months into Harris' bid, right as she was about to get on the debate stage, Harris writes that Biden called her. He wished her luck — but then spent time on the call asking if she was bashing him to \"powerbrokers.\"</p>   <p>\"I just couldn't understand why he would call me, right now, and make it all about himself,\" she writes.</p>   <p>A spokesperson for Biden declined to comment.</p>   <h3><strong>2. She doesn't directly say that Biden shouldn't have run for a second term</strong></h3>   <p>Harris doesn't make any comment in the book on whether Biden should have run for a second term at all. She defends his mental capacity to serve as president but writes that Biden's staff mismanaged his fatigue and worsened the issue.</p>   \n   <p>By the time last summer's debate debacle came around, and questions mounted on whether Biden should stay in the race, she says, she was in the \"worst position\" to tell Biden to drop out.</p>   <p>\"He would see it as naked ambition, perhaps as poisonous disloyalty, even if my only message was: Don't let the other guy win,\" Harris writes.</p>   \n   <p>She writes that she perhaps should have told Biden in the aftermath of the debate to drop out, but that \"maybe he was right\" to think voters would support him in a second match-up against Trump. In the end, Harris says, it was \"Joe and Jill's decision.\"</p>   <p>But Harris acknowledges in the book that it was \"recklessness\" to leave the decision of whether Biden should drop out to the Bidens themselves. \"It should have been more than a personal decision.\"</p>   <p>In an interview on MSNBC Monday night, Harris admitted, \"I have and had a certain responsibility that I should have followed through on. … When I talk about the recklessness, as much as anything, I'm talking about myself.\"</p>   \n   <p>Harris notes that throughout her run, she struggled to distance herself from Biden and his legacy — like when she told ABC's <em>The View</em> that she wouldn't have done anything different than Biden in their years in office.</p>   <p>She says at one point, her adviser David Plouffe didn't mince words: \"People hate Joe Biden,\" he said.</p>   <h3><strong>3. Her first choice as running mate was Pete Buttigieg</strong></h3>   <p>Harris reveals that Pete Buttigieg, her former 2020 political rival who served as transportation secretary in the Biden administration, is a close friend and was her first choice for running mate. She compliments Buttigieg as a savvy communicator and says he would have been an \"ideal partner,\" but she had reservations about whether Americans would accept a ticket with a Black woman married to a Jewish man alongside a gay man.</p>   \n   <p>Buttigieg responded in a statement to <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/news/2025/09/18/buttigieg-harris-runing-mate-107-days-00571954\" target=\"_blank\"><u>Politico</u></a>, \"My experience in politics has been that the way that you earn trust with voters is based mostly on what they think you're going to do for their lives, not on categories.\"</p>   <div>\n            <div>\n        <picture>\n            <source srcset=\"https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/1024x683+0+0/resize/400/quality/85/format/webp/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F1c%2Fdc%2F65c79de64ccba2ec471c7c2949f0%2Fgettyimages-2181638838.jpg 400w, https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/1024x683+0+0/resize/600/quality/85/format/webp/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F1c%2Fdc%2F65c79de64ccba2ec471c7c2949f0%2Fgettyimages-2181638838.jpg 600w, https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/1024x683+0+0/resize/800/quality/85/format/webp/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F1c%2Fdc%2F65c79de64ccba2ec471c7c2949f0%2Fgettyimages-2181638838.jpg 800w, https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/1024x683+0+0/resize/900/quality/85/format/webp/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F1c%2Fdc%2F65c79de64ccba2ec471c7c2949f0%2Fgettyimages-2181638838.jpg 900w, https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/1024x683+0+0/resize/1200/quality/85/format/webp/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F1c%2Fdc%2F65c79de64ccba2ec471c7c2949f0%2Fgettyimages-2181638838.jpg 1200w, https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/1024x683+0+0/resize/1600/quality/85/format/webp/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F1c%2Fdc%2F65c79de64ccba2ec471c7c2949f0%2Fgettyimages-2181638838.jpg 1600w, https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/1024x683+0+0/resize/1800/quality/85/format/webp/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F1c%2Fdc%2F65c79de64ccba2ec471c7c2949f0%2Fgettyimages-2181638838.jpg 1800w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1025px) 650px, calc(100vw - 30px)\" type=\"image/webp\"></source>\n            <source srcset=\"https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/1024x683+0+0/resize/400/quality/85/format/jpeg/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F1c%2Fdc%2F65c79de64ccba2ec471c7c2949f0%2Fgettyimages-2181638838.jpg 400w, https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/1024x683+0+0/resize/600/quality/85/format/jpeg/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F1c%2Fdc%2F65c79de64ccba2ec471c7c2949f0%2Fgettyimages-2181638838.jpg 600w, https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/1024x683+0+0/resize/800/quality/85/format/jpeg/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F1c%2Fdc%2F65c79de64ccba2ec471c7c2949f0%2Fgettyimages-2181638838.jpg 800w, https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/1024x683+0+0/resize/900/quality/85/format/jpeg/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F1c%2Fdc%2F65c79de64ccba2ec471c7c2949f0%2Fgettyimages-2181638838.jpg 900w, https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/1024x683+0+0/resize/1200/quality/85/format/jpeg/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F1c%2Fdc%2F65c79de64ccba2ec471c7c2949f0%2Fgettyimages-2181638838.jpg 1200w, https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/1024x683+0+0/resize/1600/quality/85/format/jpeg/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F1c%2Fdc%2F65c79de64ccba2ec471c7c2949f0%2Fgettyimages-2181638838.jpg 1600w, https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/1024x683+0+0/resize/1800/quality/85/format/jpeg/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F1c%2Fdc%2F65c79de64ccba2ec471c7c2949f0%2Fgettyimages-2181638838.jpg 1800w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1025px) 650px, calc(100vw - 30px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\"></source>\n            <img src=\"https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/1024x683+0+0/resize/1100/quality/50/format/jpeg/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F1c%2Fdc%2F65c79de64ccba2ec471c7c2949f0%2Fgettyimages-2181638838.jpg\" alt=\"Former Vice President Kamala Harris takes the stage after being introduced by then-Democratic vice presidential nominee, Minnesota Gov.

It was a contrast to Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro, whom Harris is critical of in her book and paints as too ambitious for being a No. 2. She says Shapiro asked one of her staffers about how many rooms the VP's residence had, and on the way in for his final interview, wondered how he could get work from Pennsylvania artists sent to the house.</p>   <p>She muses that Shapiro tried to call her to withdraw himself as a contender right before she named Walz because he knew he wouldn't be her choice.</p>   <p>Shapiro's spokesperson Manuel Bonder said in a statement, \"it's simply ridiculous to suggest that Governor Shapiro was focused on anything other than defeating Donald Trump. … The conclusion of this process was a deeply personal decision for both him and the Vice President.\"</p>   \n   <h3><strong>4. She is still trying to tell her own backstory</strong></h3>   <p>Harris has typically been a buttoned-up politician, especially when it comes to sharing personal anecdotes. In the memoir, though, she's more candid and reveals some of the personal struggles and stresses of her run for president — like the toll it took on her relationship with Emhoff.</p>   <p>But in most other parts of the book, it seems Harris is still trying to tell her own story to the public — something the campaign was pressed to do in a short window of time last year after Biden dropped out. After three and a half years of being a vice president that largely left her in the shadows, Harris spent several weeks on the campaign trail trying to reintroduce herself to the country in her own words.</p>   \n   <p>The book is peppered with familiar stump speech lines from Harris, along with explanations about her decision to become a prosecutor and lessons from her mother.</p>   <p>She also recounts her time as vice president meeting with foreign leaders like Ukraine's Volodymyr Zelenskyy and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, as well as leading on issues like gun violence prevention from the White House.</p>   <h3><strong>5. What's next for Harris is still unanswered</strong></h3>   <p>In the last few pages of her book, Harris gives some vague ideas for what she sees as the path forward for Democrats, and for the country.</p>   \n   <p>\"We need to come up with our own blueprint that sets out our alternative vision for our country,\" Harris writes, adding that \"the heart\" of her vision is investing in educating Gen Z.</p>   \n   <p>While she touches on the topics of transgender athletes and Israel's war in Gaza in the book, Harris doesn't offer any suggestions for how the party should handle specific issues going forward. Besides noting that she wants to \"be with the people\" and hear their ideas, Harris also doesn't indicate what her own future in politics will look like. She does say that the answer for what's next, though, won't come from Washington.</p>   <p>Her book tour, which kicks off Wednesday in New York, will include nearly 20 stops around the country, as well as London and Toronto.</p>\n</div>"

The comments in question from Kimmel: \"We hit some new lows over the weekend with the MAGA gang desperately trying to characterize this kid who murdered Charlie Kirk as anything other than one of them and doing everything they can to score political points from it.\"</p>   \n   <p>Carr threatened Disney and ABC affiliates that carry Kimmel's show, encouraging stations to preempt the late night program. Nexstar, which owns stations across the country and needs FCC approval for a multibillion dollar merger with media company TEGNA, quickly pulled the program. So did Sinclair Broadcast Group, which aired a remembrance of Charlie Kirk in Kimmel's Friday timeslot on ABC stations.</p>   <p>\"Last Wednesday, we made the decision to suspend production on the show to avoid further inflaming a tense situation at an emotional moment for our country,\" Disney explained in a statement provided to NPR. The company cited concerns that \"some of the comments were ill-timed and thus insensitive.\"</p>   <div>\n            <div>\n        <picture>\n            <source srcset=\"https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/6000x4000+0+0/resize/400/quality/85/format/webp/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F63%2Fed%2F7f637fb943cea723eea7d9cee6a5%2Fap25261706669269.jpg 400w, https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/6000x4000+0+0/resize/600/quality/85/format/webp/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F63%2Fed%2F7f637fb943cea723eea7d9cee6a5%2Fap25261706669269.jpg 600w, https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/6000x4000+0+0/resize/800/quality/85/format/webp/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F63%2Fed%2F7f637fb943cea723eea7d9cee6a5%2Fap25261706669269.jpg 800w, https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/6000x4000+0+0/resize/900/quality/85/format/webp/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F63%2Fed%2F7f637fb943cea723eea7d9cee6a5%2Fap25261706669269.jpg 900w, https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/6000x4000+0+0/resize/1200/quality/85/format/webp/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F63%2Fed%2F7f637fb943cea723eea7d9cee6a5%2Fap25261706669269.jpg 1200w, https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/6000x4000+0+0/resize/1600/quality/85/format/webp/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F63%2Fed%2F7f637fb943cea723eea7d9cee6a5%2Fap25261706669269.jpg 1600w, https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/6000x4000+0+0/resize/1800/quality/85/format/webp/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F63%2Fed%2F7f637fb943cea723eea7d9cee6a5%2Fap25261706669269.jpg 1800w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1025px) 650px, calc(100vw - 30px)\" type=\"image/webp\"></source>\n            <source srcset=\"https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/6000x4000+0+0/resize/400/quality/85/format/jpeg/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F63%2Fed%2F7f637fb943cea723eea7d9cee6a5%2Fap25261706669269.jpg 400w, https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/6000x4000+0+0/resize/600/quality/85/format/jpeg/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F63%2Fed%2F7f637fb943cea723eea7d9cee6a5%2Fap25261706669269.jpg 600w, https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/6000x4000+0+0/resize/800/quality/85/format/jpeg/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F63%2Fed%2F7f637fb943cea723eea7d9cee6a5%2Fap25261706669269.jpg 800w, https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/6000x4000+0+0/resize/900/quality/85/format/jpeg/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F63%2Fed%2F7f637fb943cea723eea7d9cee6a5%2Fap25261706669269.jpg 900w, https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/6000x4000+0+0/resize/1200/quality/85/format/jpeg/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F63%2Fed%2F7f637fb943cea723eea7d9cee6a5%2Fap25261706669269.jpg 1200w, https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/6000x4000+0+0/resize/1600/quality/85/format/jpeg/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F63%2Fed%2F7f637fb943cea723eea7d9cee6a5%2Fap25261706669269.jpg 1600w, https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/6000x4000+0+0/resize/1800/quality/85/format/jpeg/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F63%2Fed%2F7f637fb943cea723eea7d9cee6a5%2Fap25261706669269.jpg 1800w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1025px) 650px, calc(100vw - 30px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\"></source>\n            <img src=\"https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/6000x4000+0+0/resize/1100/quality/50/format/jpeg/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F63%2Fed%2F7f637fb943cea723eea7d9cee6a5%2Fap25261706669269.jpg\" alt=\"Protesters outside Walt Disney Studios in Burbank, Calif., last week.\" />\n        </picture>\n</div>\n<div>\n    <div>\n        <p>\n                Protesters outside Walt Disney Studios in Burbank, Calif., last week.\n                <b>\n                    Jae C.

The signers also include Selena Gomez and Olivia Rodrigo, who both had early success as Disney actors.</p>   \n   <p>Other signers include Tom Hanks, Jennifer Aniston, Robert DeNiro, Jason Bateman, Natalie Portman and Maya Rudolph.</p>   \n   <p>In part, the letter reads: \"Last week, Jimmy Kimmel was taken off the air after the government threatened a private company with retaliation, marking a dark moment for freedom of speech in our nation. In an attempt to silence its critics, our government has resorted to threatening the livelihoods of journalists, talk show hosts, artists, creatives, and entertainers across the board. This runs counter to the values our nation was built upon, and our Constitution guarantees … Regardless of our political affiliation, or whether we engage in politics or not, we all love our country. We also share the belief that our voices should never be silenced by those in power – because if it happens to one of us, it happens to all of us.\"</p>   <p>In his opening monologue last Monday, Kimmel had criticized the conservative response to the assassination of conservative activist and close Trump ally Charlie Kirk. \"We hit some new lows over the weekend with the MAGA gang desperately trying to characterize this kid who murdered Charlie Kirk as anything other than one of them and doing everything they can to score political points from it,\" Kimmel said.</p>   \n   <p>Last Wednesday, Brendan Carr, the chairman of the Federal Communications Commission (FCC), <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2025/09/19/nx-s1-5546764/fcc-brendan-carr-kimmel-trump-free-speech\" target=\"_blank\">told</a> conservative podcaster Benny Johnson: \"We can do this the easy way or the hard way. These companies can find ways to change conduct to take action on Kimmel or, you know, there's going to be additional work for the FCC ahead.\"</p>   <p>Within <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2025/09/18/nx-s1-5545671/kimmel-suspension-charlie-kirk-death-free-speech-censorship\" target=\"_blank\">hours</a>, ABC announced it would suspend Kimmel's show indefinitely. On the Fox News program <em>Saturday in America</em>, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt <a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/media/karoline-leavitt-says-obama-has-no-idea-what-hes-talking-about-after-kimmel-comments.amp\" target=\"_blank\">said</a>, \"The decision to fire Jimmy Kimmel and to cancel his show came from executives at ABC.\" Kimmel has not been fired, nor has his show been canceled.</p>   \n   <p>The executive director of the ACLU, Anthony D. Romero, told NPR in a written statement on Monday: \"We now find ourselves in a modern McCarthy era, facing exactly the type of heavy-handed government censorship our Constitution rightfully forbids. The silencing of Jimmy Kimmel and jawboning of media outlets through lawsuits and threats to their licenses evoke dark memories of the 1950s. We must remember, however, that Senator McCarthy was ultimately disgraced and neutralized once Americans mobilized and stood up to him. We must do the same today because, together, our voices are louder and, together, we will fight to be heard.\"</p>   \n   <p>Other entertainers have taken separate actions to make their feelings known – including some who also have ties to Disney properties.</p>   <p>On Monday morning, hosts of the popular ABC morning show <em>The View</em> also <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxcGIHLUcRM\" target=\"_blank\">criticized</a> the Trump administration and their own corporate bosses. Host Whoopi Goldberg said that her show had waited several days to see if Kimmel would make any sort of public statement. \"The government cannot — cannot — apply pressure to force someone to be silenced,\" she said. Her co-host Alyssa Farah Griffin added, \"The First Amendment is the first for a reason, because you need to be able to hold those in power accountable.\"</p>   <p>On Sunday evening, musician Sarah McLachlan, one of the founders of the Lilith Fair music festival, and fellow artist Jewel declined to perform at the premiere of the Hulu documentary <em>Lilith Fair: Building a Mystery</em>. (Hulu is also owned by Disney.)</p>   <p>In comments made from the stage before the documentary's screening in Los Angeles, McLachlan — who appears in the film — announced the decision to cancel the live performances. She <a href=\"https://x.com/chrissgardner/status/1969995307355431388\" target=\"_blank\">said</a>: \"I've grappled with being here tonight and around what to say about the present situation that we are all faced with, the stark contraction to the many advances we've made watching the insidious erosion of women's rights, of trans and queer rights, the muzzling of free speech. I think we're all fearful for what comes next, and none of us know.\"</p>   \n   <p>Another, <a href=\"https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/tv/tv-news/jimmy-kimmel-suspension-reactions-marvel-disney-stars-1236376120/\" target=\"_blank\">currently circulating</a> open letter signed by some <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1-vhY9XHKjmqUJ50imhEn4UPXTTYgxY9XlZ83hhA2k_o/edit?tab=t.0\" target=\"_blank\">600 comedians</a> including Jimmy Fallon, Chelsea Handler, Margaret Cho, David Cross and W. Kamau Bell reads in part: \"Every culture needs humor. It's how we heal and how we connect with each other. Take it away, and what's left is fear, silence, and a bleak existence. When the government targets one of us, they target all of us. They strike at the heart of our shared humanity. They strip away the basic right every person deserves: to speak freely, question boldly, and laugh loudly… We will not be silenced.\"</p>   \n   <p>Some prominent conservative lawmakers and commentators have also weighed in on the issue of free speech.</p>   <p>Last week, former Fox News host Tucker Carlson, during an episode of his podcast dedicated to Kirk's murder and its aftermath, addressed Attorney General Pam Bondi and her declaration that the Department of Justice would \"target\" those who used \"<a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2025/09/19/nx-s1-5544346/where-does-free-speech-go-from-here\" target=\"_blank\">hate speech</a>.\" Carlson <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5iCxIu7Syw\" target=\"_blank\">said</a>: \"Consider what it means if you don't respect free speech, which is another way of saying free conscience. The right of other people to make up their own minds about the basic questions of what is right and wrong, and to express their views on those issues. If you don't acknowledge the right of other people to do that, and if you take steps to prevent them from doing that, what are you really saying? You're saying, 'I don't think you have a soul. I think you're a meat puppet I can control.'\"</p>   <p>On Friday, Republican Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas criticized Carr and the FCC on his own podcast, calling the situation \"dangerous as hell.\"</p>   <p>\"I gotta say, that's right out of <em>GoodFellas</em>,\" Cruz <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l6KYixCBTJc&list=PL5V1QY3MemiGElRzUH3Zea8yGBkMwYMHb&index=3\" target=\"_blank\">said</a>. \"That's right out of a mafioso coming into a bar going, 'Nice bar you got here. It'd be a shame if something happened to it.'\"</p>\n</div>"

The president said he wanted to see justice served. </p>   <p>\"We can't delay any longer, it's killing our reputation and credibility,\" <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2025/08/08/nx-s1-5496468/justice-department-escalates-its-campaign-against-trumps-perceived-political-enemies\" target=\"_blank\">he wrote</a>.</p>   <p>What Trump said couldn't wait are criminal investigations of his most prominent critics: former FBI Director Jim Comey, New York Attorney General Letitia James, and California Democratic Sen. Adam Schiff. </p>   \n   <p>His post emerged only hours after the top federal prosecutor in northern Virginia left his job under pressure. Erik Siebert had worked closely with Trump's top DOJ leaders this year, but he concluded he could not seek criminal charges the president wanted against James.</p>   <p>Now Lindsey Halligan, who had been serving as a special assistant to the president, was sworn in Monday as U.S. attorney for the Eastern District of Virginia, though she has no prosecutorial experience. Most recently, she's been helping Trump remove what he calls \"improper ideology\" from the Smithsonian museums.</p>   <p>\"This attorney general sent a memo on Day 1 that made it clear that Justice Department lawyers were the president's lawyers, and we are now seeing how that's playing out and how dangerous it is — how it disintegrates the rule of law,\" Stacey Young, a former DOJ attorney who now leads a group called Justice Connection that helps Justice Department workers, said of Attorney General Pam Bondi.</p>   <p>Already this year <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2025/07/31/nx-s1-5484932/layoffs-at-the-department-of-justice-are-transforming-its-workforce\" target=\"_blank\">thousands of employees have left the Justice Department</a> through dismissals and forced resignations. Nearly all of the public integrity unit is gone, as are three in four lawyers in the civil rights division. </p>   <p>Many people inside the department are afraid, Young said. After all, she said, if the president is willing to fire a prosecutor for not pursuing his enemies, <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2025/07/30/nx-s1-5476311/trump-fired-workers-justice-department\" target=\"_blank\">anybody at the department could get fired</a>. </p>   \n   <p>White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said Trump was understandably frustrated with lawmakers and state officials who investigated him.</p>   <p>\"The president is fulfilling his promise to restore a Department of Justice that demands accountability, and it is not weaponizing the Department of Justice to demand accountability for those who weaponize the Department of Justice,\" Leavitt said.</p>   <p>The Justice Department has traditionally operated with some measure of distance from the White House on criminal investigations. But that distance seems to have closed this year in a way that feels different to longtime observers.</p>   \n   <p>During the presidency of Richard Nixon, public servants at the DOJ felt squeezed between what the president wanted and what the law required. But even Nixon was not as clear and open as Trump is now about what he wanted to happen.</p>   <p>\"In this situation you have a president who is openly, brazenly bragging about his ability to seek retribution against his political enemies,\" said George Washington University law professor Stephen Saltzburg.</p>   <p>Saltzburg said it looks as if the Trump White House is insisting career prosecutors use their power to make life hell for people who challenge Trump — and on the other side of the coin, to drop investigations or pardon people who support the president, including <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2025/02/18/nx-s1-5299906/justice-department-trumps-allies-cases\" target=\"_blank\">the people who rioted at the U.S. Capitol</a> four years ago.</p>   <p>Trump's political appointees took an oath to support and defend the Constitution when they arrived on the job. That oath may soon be put to the test, if it hasn't already, Harvard law professor Jack Goldsmith <a href=\"https://executivefunctions.substack.com/p/how-should-a-doj-political-appointee\" target=\"_blank\">wrote recently in his newsletter Executive Functions</a>. </p>   <p>\"The Article II truism about presidential power cannot justify continued service to a president and administration openly indifferent to law,\" Goldsmith wrote. \"That is an issue of personal and professional ethics and integrity.\"</p>   \n   <p>Federal prosecutors decide which defendants to charge, and when and where. But there are still some outside checks on that power. In recent weeks, <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2025/09/05/nx-s1-5526925/as-trump-cracks-down-on-d-c-crime-grand-juries-emerge-as-a-check-on-overreach\" target=\"_blank\">grand juries in Washington, D.C.,</a> have refused to indict people, and magistrate judges have turned away requests for search warrants. </p>   <p>That skepticism, which followed the federal occupation of D.C., may carry over into other cases. Take the claims by Trump's critics of <a href=\"https://www.congress.gov/crs-product/LSB11326\" target=\"_blank\">selective or vindictive prosecution</a>, for example.</p>   <p>In the past, there's been a very high bar to succeed in court on that allegation. But now that Trump is so open about his demands, judges may think differently.</p>   \n   <p>\"I think the president's announcement of what he wants the Justice Department to do is so out of line with our history of promoting equal justice under law and fairness that I don't think that any federal judge is going to look at this and be happy about what the president is doing,\" Saltzburg said.</p>\n</div>"

And they added that state Medicaid programs, in partnership with the federal Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, would cover this use.</p>   \n   <p>The suite of changes was announced despite a notable lack of clear scientific evidence to support these moves. The changes were presented as part of what the administration said was its commitment to identify the root causes of autism, diagnoses of which have increased in recent years.</p>   <p>Flanked by Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. and Centers for Medicare and Medicaid head Dr. Mehmet Oz, President Trump pinned substantial blame for rising autism rates on the common painkiller, which is also known by its<strong> </strong>brand name<strong>, </strong>Tylenol.</p>   \n   <p>\"Taking Tylenol is not good — I'll say it: It's not good,\" he said, suggesting without evidence that communities without access to the medicine have \"no autism,\" while in others, autism now affects 1 in 12 boys. (An estimated <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2025/04/17/nx-s1-5366693/researcher-discusses-cdc-findings-that-autism-rates-have-increased-in-kids\" target=\"_blank\">1 in 31 children in the U.S. </a>are diagnosed with autism.) Trump discouraged giving acetaminophen to babies, as well. (He also suggested that vaccines and their frequency may be a culprit in causing autism, an oft-repeated claim that has been debunked by decades of research.)</p>   <p>Trump and his deputies repeatedly advised pregnant women to refrain from using acetaminophen and said they would caution physicians against using it — contrary to what physicians groups say.</p>   \n   <p>In a statement sent to NPR, Tylenol-maker Kenvue disputed<strong> </strong>the administration's claims.</p>   <p>\"We believe independent, sound science clearly shows that taking acetaminophen does not cause autism,\" the statement said. \"We strongly disagree with any suggestion otherwise and are deeply concerned about the health risks and confusion this poses for expecting mothers and parents.\"</p>   <p>During the press conference, officials pointed to <a href=\"https://ehjournal.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12940-025-01208-0\" target=\"_blank\">a study</a> done by Harvard University and other researchers that found that women who reported taking acetaminophen while they were pregnant seemed to be slightly more likely to have a child who was later diagnosed with autism.</p>   \n   <p>One of the researchers on that study was Ann Bauer, an epidemiologist at the University of Massachusetts. Bauer said she thinks pregnant women should be told about a possible risk from acetaminophen. But the researcher also was worried that it might be too soon to have the federal government offering guidance on its use.</p>   <p>\"I'm a little concerned about how this message is going to come because I think they may be jumping the gun,\" Bauer said before the announcement was made. \"I think those of us in the research community would like to see stronger evidence.\"</p>   \n   <p>Diagnoses of autism have risen over the past two decades, though use of acetaminophen has not — remaining largely steady over that time. The increase in diagnoses is often attributed to a broadened definition of autism, with changes in the diagnostic criteria, as well as increased awareness and screening, but Kennedy dismissed those explanations as a \"canard.\"</p>   <p>Many physicians and autism advocacy groups said they opposed the administration's stance.</p>   <p>\"It is highly unsettling that our federal health agencies are willing to make an announcement that will affect the health and well-being of millions of people without the backing of reliable data,\" Steven J. Fleischman, M.D., president of the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, said in a written statement.</p>   <p>Even the notice about acetaminophen issued to physicians by the Food and Drug Administration <a href=\"https://www.fda.gov/media/188843/download?attachment=&utm_medium=email&utm_source=govdelivery\" target=\"_blank\"><u>pointed out</u></a> that a possible link to autism was an area of ongoing scientific debate, and said that \"while an association between acetaminophen and autism has been described in many studies, a causal relationship has not been established and there are contrary studies in the scientific literature.\"</p>   <p>Specifically, the Food and Drug Administration, as well as the agency that sets policy for Medicare and Medicaid, pledged to change the indication on a medication called leucovorin as a treatment for autism, despite scant evidence that this form of vitamin B has any effect.</p>   <p>In response to that change, the American Psychiatric Association issued a statement opposing the administration's suggestion that vaccines cause autism, adding that leucovorin (folinic acid) is not recommended to treat autism, adding \"it will require many more years of research before we know if leucovorin is an appropriate treatment for individuals with autism.\"</p>   <p>By his own admission, President Trump said he was not precise with his language on the subject. But he repeated the same message multiple times during his remarks.</p>   \n   <p>\"If you can't tough it out,\" President Trump said, limited use of acetaminophen might be necessary. But \"ideally you don't take it at all,\" he said, in a rambling press conference that at times conflated vaccine and painkiller use, citing both unconfirmed rumors and personal suppositions that both might be harmful to women and babies.</p>   <p>\"It looks like you're pumping it into a horse,\" Trump said of multiple vaccinations given to children. \"The Amish, for example, have no autism,\" he said, despite research showing that autism does affect Amish communities, later adding that there are no cases of autism in Cuba, when in fact there are cases of autism there. He called on pregnant women to refrain from using the common painkiller, repeatedly saying, \"Don't take Tylenol.\"</p>   <p>\"There's no downside,\" he maintained, although pregnant women are told to avoid other anti-fever drugs such as aspirin and ibuprofen, and fever can be dangerous in a pregnancy. The Society for Maternal-Fetal Medicine, which recommends using acetaminophen to treat fever and pain in pregnant women, says that untreated fever can cause grave harms such as miscarriage, birth defects or premature birth, especially early in a pregnancy.</p>   <p>Merck, maker of various vaccines including for measles, pneumonia and HPV, also responded, saying, \"the recent statement that vaccines could be linked to autism is inconsistent with the extensive scientific studies that have been conducted over the past 25 years, which have consistently shown no link between vaccination and autism.\"</p>   <p>\"Today's announcement risks taking us backwards,\" said Jackie Dilworth, a spokesperson for The Arc of the United States, a group representing people with developmental disabilities and their families. \"Today's claims risk fueling stigma, misleading the public, and distracting from what families truly need,\" because they present unproven suppositions as fact, she said.</p>\n</div>"
