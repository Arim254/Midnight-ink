Lawmakers have less than 24 hours to reach a deal before a midnight deadline.</p>   <p>Senate Democrats have refused to back the spending bill, in an effort to force Republicans to negotiate on federal health care subsidies. They are pushing for an extension of Affordable Care Act subsidies that are set to expire at the end of the year in exchange for their support. Democrats also want to repeal cuts to health care programs that were enacted by the GOP's tax and spending bill passed earlier this summer.</p>   \n   <p>House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., Senate Majority Leader John Thune, R-S.D., Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., and House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, D-N.Y., met with President Trump at the White House on Monday in hopes of reaching an agreement.</p>   <p>But the two parties walked away saying major differences remained. Democrats vowed to continue to push for concessions on health care.</p>   <p>Trump went on to taunt Democrats after the meeting. <a href=\"https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/115290424560405640\" target=\"_blank\">He posted a racist AI-generated video on social media.</a> It included mariachi music in the background and an image of Jeffries with a sombrero and a drawn-on mustache. This was accompanied by a vulgar, crudely deep-faked voiceover of Schumer denigrating Democrats.</p>   <p>Jeffries dismissed the video in <a href=\"https://x.com/repjeffries/status/1972838488975507458?s=46&t=TP-MRsbb_b6cnhD3pggMMg\" target=\"_blank\">a social media response</a>, saying \"Bigotry will get you nowhere.\"</p>   <p>Earlier in the day, Thune accused Democrats of \"hijacking\" the process with a push to address an issue he argued should be dealt with on a separate track. He pointed out that Democrats have voted repeatedly for stopgap bills in the past.</p>   <p>The standoff over spending could have major consequences for federal workers and people who rely on government services, particularly as the White House threatens to permanently fire some federal workers deemed nonessential in a shutdown. The move is a dramatic escalation in the increasingly frequent battle over federal spending.</p>   \n   <p>House Republicans narrowly <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2025/09/19/nx-s1-5545929/house-stopgap-funding-bill-government-shutdown\" target=\"_blank\">passed a continuing resolution</a> earlier this month that would fund the government through Nov. 21, but that measure did not win the Democratic support needed to reach a 60-vote threshold in the Senate.</p>   <p>The Senate is expected to bring up the House-passed bill and the Democrats' alternative bill for votes again Tuesday afternoon, just hours before funding is set to run out. Both again are not expected to get the 60 votes needed to advance.</p>   <h3>No resolution following a meeting at the White House</h3>   <p>Congressional leaders met with President Trump and Vice President Vance on Monday afternoon, but left without a deal. After the meeting, Vance accused Democrats of holding government funding hostage.</p>   <p>\"I think we're headed to a shutdown because the Democrats won't do the right thing,\" Vance said. \"I hope they change their mind, but we're going to see.\"</p>   <p>Schumer, however, said it's on Republicans to negotiate a bipartisan agreement.</p>   <p>\"Their bill has not one iota of Democratic input. That is never how we've done this before,\" said Schumer. \"When I was leader, we negotiated four times with Republicans, and we never had a shutdown. And so it's up to the Republicans whether they want a shutdown or not.\"</p>   <p>Lawmakers from both parties' positions appeared to harden on Monday evening, and most signaled no viable path to averting a shutdown. House Democrats gathered at the Capitol, but Speaker Johnson has not called the chamber back into session for votes, and it's likely to stay out of session as a shutdown starts.</p>   <p>Sen. Raphael Warnock, D-Ga., told reporters there was still time for some sort of solution, but GOP lawmakers were ignoring a major problem if they insisted on no provisions to deal with increasing costs.</p>   <p>\"They must not be talking to the people I'm talking to in Georgia who are hurting and who cannot afford this astronomical hike that we are going to see in their health care premiums. People can't afford that.\"</p>   \n   <p>Schumer's latest strategy<strong> </strong>comes almost six months after he and several other Senate Democrats <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2025/03/13/g-s1-53495/senate-democrats-funding-bill-government-shutdown\" target=\"_blank\">voted to advance</a> a GOP stopgap plan that avoided a government shutdown and pushed back the deadline to September. The move <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2025/03/13/nx-s1-5327600/house-democrats-outrage-spending\" target=\"_blank\">infuriated many</a> within the Democratic base and <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2025/04/23/nx-s1-5339833/young-democrats-trump-primary-challenges-midterm-elections\" target=\"_blank\">fueled calls</a> for the party to fight harder against Trump's agenda.</p>   <p>Republicans argue that the stopgap bill allows the committees negotiating the spending bills more time to finish bipartisan spending bills.</p>   <p>\"I think it will send a real sense of confidence across the country that we're actually capable of doing the very basics of our job up here,\" Sen. Mike Rounds, R-S.D., told reporters in the Capitol on Monday. Rounds says he and other Republicans are open to addressing health care costs. \"Even though none of us were supportive of the ACA to begin with, we can't walk away from the people who have had no place else to go to get their health care coverage.\"</p>   <h3>What's affected in a shutdown?</h3>   <p>While critical services such as Social Security and payments from Medicare and Medicaid would continue, there could be delays in processing new applications for those programs.</p>   <p>In a shutdown, anything deemed nonessential is put on hold, so Americans could experience delays in certain services and hundreds of thousands of federal workers will go without pay.</p>   <p>In a move to seemingly raise the stakes, the White House's budget arm issued a memo that instructed federal agencies to prepare to lay off workers permanently, instead of the traditional temporary furlough.</p>   <p>Congressional Democrats panned the memo as an intimidation tactic.</p>   <p>\"This is nothing less than mafia-style blackmail,\" Sen. Chris Van Hollen, D-Md., told NPR. \"Essentially, the president is threatening to fire dedicated federal employees who have nothing to do with the ongoing political and policy dispute.\"</p>   <p>If the administration makes good on its threat, it could mean that whenever the federal government does reopen, it would have a smaller workforce.</p>   \n   <p>Typically, the White House budget office would collect and release agency shutdown plans. This time, each individual agency is responsible for posting and sharing its plans, which has caused a confusing patchwork of information for those seeking to understand the scope of a potential shutdown. However, the White House is saying the Women, Infants and Children program, known as WIC, will be among the programs hit quickest in a shutdown. The program provides nutrition assistance and health care screenings to mothers and young children.<br /></p>   <p><em>NPR's Tamara Keith and Elena Moore contributed to this report.</em></p>\n</div>"

That happened during the 2018-2019 government shutdown as workers showed their anger over missing paychecks.</p>   <p>Lastly, if you're planning on any international travel in the new year, you may need to build in even more time for passport renewals.

USPS is primarily self-funded and doesn't depend on the appropriations process to continue running as usual.</p>      <h2>Benefit and safety net programs</h2>   <p>Social Security, VA and other benefits will continue, but there could be some delay in services, such as processing applications.</p>   <p>In a shutdown, the first to feel the pinch could be the mothers and young children who rely on the Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children (WIC) food program. </p>   <p>\"The timing of this shutdown threat at the start of the fiscal year puts WIC at risk of rapidly running out of funds. A prolonged federal government shutdown of more than one week puts WIC families at risk,\" says Georgia Machell, president and CEO of the National WIC Association.</p>   \n   <p>Whether WIC could continue under a prolonged shutdown would vary depending on whether states could access other contingency funds.  </p>   <p>The Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP, formerly known as food stamps) will last longer but could also run out if a shutdown dragged on.</p>      <h2>There could be missed paychecks and lost jobs</h2>   <p>Perhaps the biggest impacts will be felt by federal workers and active-duty military service members who will not receive a paycheck during a government shutdown. The White House is also threatening mass layoffs (a reduction in force, or RIF) of federal employees, in addition to furlough notices, if a shutdown happens.</p>   <p>A shutdown would happen toward the end of a pay period, so the first full paycheck missed for federal employees would be Oct. 24, while for the military it would be Oct. 15.</p>   <p>The only salaries the federal government will continue to pay during a shutdown will be members of Congress and the president, according to the Constitution. However, elected officials can request that their paychecks be deferred while a shutdown is ongoing.</p>   <p>Federal employees and military members will get back pay once the shutdown is over.</p>      <div>\n            <div>\n        <picture>\n            <source srcset=\"https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/7907x5271+0+0/resize/400/quality/85/format/webp/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F78%2F8c%2Faa6074f944a9b53f5ed2e34ec900%2Fgettyimages-2223867369.jpg 400w, https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/7907x5271+0+0/resize/600/quality/85/format/webp/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F78%2F8c%2Faa6074f944a9b53f5ed2e34ec900%2Fgettyimages-2223867369.jpg 600w, https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/7907x5271+0+0/resize/800/quality/85/format/webp/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F78%2F8c%2Faa6074f944a9b53f5ed2e34ec900%2Fgettyimages-2223867369.jpg 800w, https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/7907x5271+0+0/resize/900/quality/85/format/webp/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F78%2F8c%2Faa6074f944a9b53f5ed2e34ec900%2Fgettyimages-2223867369.jpg 900w, https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/7907x5271+0+0/resize/1200/quality/85/format/webp/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F78%2F8c%2Faa6074f944a9b53f5ed2e34ec900%2Fgettyimages-2223867369.jpg 1200w, https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/7907x5271+0+0/resize/1600/quality/85/format/webp/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F78%2F8c%2Faa6074f944a9b53f5ed2e34ec900%2Fgettyimages-2223867369.jpg 1600w, https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/7907x5271+0+0/resize/1800/quality/85/format/webp/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F78%2F8c%2Faa6074f944a9b53f5ed2e34ec900%2Fgettyimages-2223867369.jpg 1800w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1025px) 650px, calc(100vw -

And a <a href=\"https://www.gao.gov/products/b-330776-0\" target=\"_blank\">Government Accountability Office opinion</a> in September 2019 found that the Trump administration violated federal law when it used entrance fees to keep the parks accessible.</p>      <h2><strong>The weather forecasts will keep coming</strong></h2>   <p>Ahead of past possible shutdowns, the National Weather Service has said it would continue to provide routine forecasts, as well as extreme weather watch and warning information. </p>   <p>Many other day-to-day weather operations will also continue uninterrupted, including urgent repairs to radar and other key equipment. But a shutdown could delay routine maintenance, upgrades and long-term projects for less critical services, according to the National Weather Service.</p>   \n   <p>Previous government shutdowns have delayed the processing of long-term weather and climate data at other federal agencies.</p>      <h2>FEMA will keep working, but funding is running low</h2>   <p>Most employees of the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) are considered exempt and will be available for any emergency or disasters. </p>   <p>But the main funding source for FEMA, the Disaster Relief Fund, is running dangerously low and needs congressional approval for additional funds. </p>   <p>During a shutdown, FEMA would implement immediate needs funding, and this could mean delays in reimbursements to states and local governments.

Senate Majority Leader John Thune is expected to bring up two proposals for votes today: one for the House-passed bill that extends current funding levels through Nov. 21 and another for the Democrats' alternative plan that attaches health care changes. Both are expected to fail.</li></ul>   \n   <p><strong>Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth's meeting with top U.S. military leaders today in Quantico, Va., just got even more notable </strong>with the president announcing he will attend. Trump informed NBC News that it will be a \"very nice meeting talking about how well we're doing militarily, talking about being in great shape.\" These details are currently the <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2025/09/30/nx-s1-5557232/hegseth-generals-trump\" target=\"_blank\">most public yet to emerge about the gathering</a>, which Hegseth ordered hundreds of generals and admirals to attend. <br /></p>   <ul><li>🎧 <strong>The meeting is unique because of the wide geographic spread of the people expected to attend</strong>, as well as the logistics and security around bringing them together, says NPR's Quil Lawrence. Trump's message that the event is a pep talk has caused some military analysts and former officers to flip as they find it <a href=\"https://one.npr.org/?sharedMediaId=nx-s1-5557858:x\" target=\"_blank\">troubling that flag officers would be pulled away</a> to be told how to do their jobs by Hegseth, who was not seen as a defense heavyweight until being appointed to his role. The meeting has also led to speculation that Hegseth is looking to fire some military leaders.</li></ul>   <p><strong>Trump announced a plan to end the war in Gaza after meeting with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu</strong> yesterday at the White House. This marks the first time Trump has outlined both an end to the war and a potential future for the two million Palestinians living in the region, nearly two years after the Hamas-led Oct. 7 attack on Israel. Here are <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2025/09/30/g-s1-91244/5-takeaways-from-the-u-s-ceasefire-proposal-for-israel-and-hamas\" target=\"_blank\">five takeaways from the plan</a>. <br /></p>   \n   <ul><li>🎧<strong> The plan includes releasing all Israeli hostages held in Gaza, along with allowing hundreds of trucks of humanitarian aid to enter Gaza daily</strong>, aimed at reversing the man-made famine. Israel would also release approximately 2,000 male detainees and all women and children in Israeli prisons since the Oct. 7 attack. NPR's Aya Batrawy says this isn't the ultimate victory over Hamas that Netanyahu desired, as it doesn't allow for the full occupation of Gaza and the continuation of war. However, Netanyahu is <a href=\"https://one.npr.org/?sharedMediaId=nx-s1-5557858:x\" target=\"_blank\">attempting to sell this as a major win</a>. The plan allows Israel to keep its boots on the ground in much of Gaza for the foreseeable future, which raises uncertainty about how Hamas might react.</li></ul>   <h3>Today's listen</h3>   <div>\n            <div>\n        <picture>\n            <source srcset=\"https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/2804x1577+0+0/resize/400/quality/85/format/webp/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fe3%2Fbe%2Fae1c9dba4a6c9ad48ae1dcf82b1a%2Fscreenshot-2025-09-26-at-11-15-07-am.png 400w, https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/2804x1577+0+0/resize/600/quality/85/format/webp/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fe3%2Fbe%2Fae1c9dba4a6c9ad48ae1dcf82b1a%2Fscreenshot-2025-09-26-at-11-15-07-am.png 600w, https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/2804x1577+0+0/resize/800/quality/85/format/webp/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fe3%2Fbe%2Fae1c9dba4a6c9ad48ae1dcf82b1a%2Fscreenshot-2025-09-26-at-11-15-07-am.png 800w, https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/2804x1577+0+0/resize/900/quality/85/format/webp/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fe3%2Fbe%2Fae1c9dba4a6c9ad48ae1dcf82b1a%2Fscreenshot-2025-09-26-at-11-15-07-am.png 900w, https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/2804x1577+0+0/resize/1200/quality/85/format/webp/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fe3%2Fbe%2Fae1c9dba4a6c9ad48ae1dcf82b1a%2Fscreenshot-2025-09-26-at-11-15-07-am.png 1200w, https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/2804x1577+0+0/resize/1600/quality/85/format/webp/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fe3%2Fbe%2Fae1c9dba4a6c9ad48ae1dcf82b1a%2Fscreenshot-2025-09-26-at-11-15-07-am.png 1600w, https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/2804x1577+0+0/resize/1800/quality/85/format/webp/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fe3%2Fbe%2Fae1c9dba4a6c9ad48ae1dcf82b1a%2Fscreenshot-2025-09-26-at-11-15-07-am.png 1800w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1025px) 650px, calc(100vw - 30px)\" type=\"image/webp\"></source>\n            <source srcset=\"https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/2804x1577+0+0/resize/400/quality/85/format/png/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fe3%2Fbe%2Fae1c9dba4a6c9ad48ae1dcf82b1a%2Fscreenshot-2025-09-26-at-11-15-07-am.png 400w, https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/2804x1577+0+0/resize/600/quality/85/format/png/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fe3%2Fbe%2Fae1c9dba4a6c9ad48ae1dcf82b1a%2Fscreenshot-2025-09-26-at-11-15-07-am.png 600w, https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/2804x1577+0+0/resize/800/quality/85/format/png/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fe3%2Fbe%2Fae1c9dba4a6c9ad48ae1dcf82b1a%2Fscreenshot-2025-09-26-at-11-15-07-am.png 800w, https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/2804x1577+0+0/resize/900/quality/85/format/png/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fe3%2Fbe%2Fae1c9dba4a6c9ad48ae1dcf82b1a%2Fscreenshot-2025-09-26-at-11-15-07-am.png 900w, https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/2804x1577+0+0/resize/1200/quality/85/format/png/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fe3%2Fbe%2Fae1c9dba4a6c9ad48ae1dcf82b1a%2Fscreenshot-2025-09-26-at-11-15-07-am.png 1200w, https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/2804x1577+0+0/resize/1600/quality/85/format/png/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fe3%2Fbe%2Fae1c9dba4a6c9ad48ae1dcf82b1a%2Fscreenshot-2025-09-26-at-11-15-07-am.png 1600w, https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/2804x1577+0+0/resize/1800/quality/85/format/png/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fe3%2Fbe%2Fae1c9dba4a6c9ad48ae1dcf82b1a%2Fscreenshot-2025-09-26-at-11-15-07-am.png 1800w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1025px) 650px, calc(100vw - 30px)\" type=\"image/png\"></source>\n            <img src=\"https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/2804x1577+0+0/resize/1100/quality/50/format/png/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fe3%2Fbe%2Fae1c9dba4a6c9ad48ae1dcf82b1a%2Fscreenshot-2025-09-26-at-11-15-07-am.png\" alt=\"Screenshot 2025-09-26 at 11.15.07 AM.png\" />\n        </picture>\n</div>\n<div>\n    <p><span>\n        Olivia Dean/Youtube/Screenshot by NPR\n    </span>\n</p></div>\n   </div>\n   <p>Olivia Dean, the 26-year-old English singer, is rising to the top of the charts with songs from her second studio album, <em>The Art of Loving</em>. She has reached the ranks of Adele, becoming the first British artist since her to have three simultaneous Top 10 hits on the U.K. charts. Her song \"Man I Need,\" which can be heard all over social media, is her <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2025/09/29/g-s1-90670/olivia-dean-man-i-need\" target=\"_blank\">first song to chart on Billboard's Hot 100</a>. She is now making her way across the U.S., sharing her music as the opener for Sabrina Carpenter's tour. Her songs discuss not only romantic love, but self-love and platonic love as well.

This transition can lead to your mood dimming. Approximately 1 in 20 adults have seasonal affective disorder, which is seasonal depression. And millions more experience a milder form of \"winter blues.\" One way to combat these feelings is by using light therapy, with the help of a light box, starting in the fall. Here's <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2025/09/29/nx-s1-5546611/seasonal-depression-light-therapy-mental-health\" target=\"_blank\">what you should know about light therapy</a> and how it works: <br /></p>   \n   <ul><li>💡 Typically, people sit in front of a light box every morning for about 30 minutes, making it part of their morning routine.</li><li>💡 Light therapy is as effective as standard antidepressant medication in alleviating symptoms, according to a study referenced by Dr. Dorothy Sit, a psychiatrist and associate professor at Northwestern University. Studies indicate that improvements in symptoms can be observed within one week of starting the therapy.</li><li>💡 If interested in buying a light box, you should get one that emits 10,000 lux of light, and larger screens are better.</li><li>💡 Remember, lack of light isn't the only trigger of a low mood. If it's cold and snowy outside, people go out less, which can cause social isolation. Reach out to friends and family and stay engaged in activities that keep you in contact with people.</li></ul>   <h3>3 things to know before you go</h3>   <div>\n            <div>\n        <picture>\n            <source srcset=\"https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/4500x2530+0+218/resize/400/quality/85/format/webp/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F7e%2Fb6%2F8668f4a9403993ed69b1867d6654%2F831stories-authortalk-kc-27-edit.jpg 400w, https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/4500x2530+0+218/resize/600/quality/85/format/webp/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F7e%2Fb6%2F8668f4a9403993ed69b1867d6654%2F831stories-authortalk-kc-27-edit.jpg 600w, https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/4500x2530+0+218/resize/800/quality/85/format/webp/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F7e%2Fb6%2F8668f4a9403993ed69b1867d6654%2F831stories-authortalk-kc-27-edit.jpg 800w, https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/4500x2530+0+218/resize/900/quality/85/format/webp/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F7e%2Fb6%2F8668f4a9403993ed69b1867d6654%2F831stories-authortalk-kc-27-edit.jpg 900w, https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/4500x2530+0+218/resize/1200/quality/85/format/webp/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F7e%2Fb6%2F8668f4a9403993ed69b1867d6654%2F831stories-authortalk-kc-27-edit.jpg 1200w, https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/4500x2530+0+218/resize/1600/quality/85/format/webp/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F7e%2Fb6%2F8668f4a9403993ed69b1867d6654%2F831stories-authortalk-kc-27-edit.jpg 1600w, https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/4500x2530+0+218/resize/1800/quality/85/format/webp/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F7e%2Fb6%2F8668f4a9403993ed69b1867d6654%2F831stories-authortalk-kc-27-edit.jpg 1800w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1025px) 650px, calc(100vw -

The VDMA is an industry association (whose name is a German acronym that translates to Association of German Mechanical and Plant Engineering). It represents thousands of German companies that manufacture industrial machines and equipment. The companies are a big part of what Germans call the \"Mittelstand,\" which are small and medium-sized manufacturers that <a href=\"https://english.bdi.eu/topics/germany/german-mittelstand\" target=\"_blank\"><u>are widely considered</u></a> to be \"the heart of the German economy.\"</p>   <p>The VDMA has real political clout, and their annual conference, \"the German Mechanical Engineering Summit,\" has become a must-go-to event for German leaders. Just the day before, Germany's chancellor, Friedrich Merz, had spoken there. Before he gave his speech, Merz listened as the president of the VDMA <a href=\"https://www.bild.de/politik/inland/heftige-kritik-an-merz-maschinenbauer-sind-wuetend-und-enttaeuscht-68c9125e677ecd7137103b2d\" target=\"_blank\"><u>said</u></a> their companies are \"angry and disappointed\" over the miserable state of the German manufacturing industry.</p>   \n   <p>\"Pretty much every statistic that we have is going in the wrong direction right now,\" Richtberg told me when we met up at the conference. Exports are nose-diving. Job cuts and furloughs are mounting. In the past six months alone, production is <a href=\"https://www.vdma.eu/en-GB/viewer/-/v2article/render/148241520\" target=\"_blank\"><u>down 4.5 percent</u></a>. It's part of a multi-year slump. The VDMA is now ringing the alarm bells that something big needs to change.</p>   <p>Germany is facing an economic crisis.</p>   <p>Economic growth has sputtered for more than five years, and its world-famous manufacturing sector is in deep trouble. There are several causes of the crisis, including the higher price of energy in the wake of Russia's 2022 invasion of Ukraine and the effects of U.S. tariffs.</p>   <p>But there's an even bigger shock beginning to hit the German economy, and it's one that may be familiar to Americans who lived through the early 2000s. Only this time, the threat Europe's largest economy faces is even scarier than anything the United States faced back then.</p>   <p>Economists are calling this threat \"the second China Shock.\" The first China Shock happened in the early 2000s. That's when exports from China began surging and manufacturers around the world found themselves unable to compete. In America, this first China Shock led to over a million manufacturing workers losing their jobs and many industrial towns falling into doomspirals. In the view of numerous <a href=\"https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/aer.20170011\" target=\"_blank\"><u>analysts</u></a>, it contributed to a populist backlash that is still upending American politics (we've written about the first China Shock <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2025/02/11/g-s1-47352/why-economists-got-free-trade-with-china-so-wrong\" target=\"_blank\"><u>several times</u></a> in <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/newsletter/money\" target=\"_blank\"><u>the </u><em><u>Planet Money</u></em><u> newsletter</u></a>).</p>   \n   <p>Germany was largely spared from the first China Shock. However, economists are now warning that the second China Shock amounts to an earthquake that is shaking the very foundations of Germany's export-led industrial economy.</p>   <p>\"It's an existential shock for Germany,\" says Dalia Marin, an economist at the Technical University of Munich. Marin sees the second China Shock as potentially leading to a \"deindustrialization\" that is \"much worse than the United States experienced during the first China Shock.\"</p>   <p>So why was Germany one of the few industrial nations to see their manufacturing sector thrive in the face of the first China Shock? What exactly is this second China Shock? And why is it potentially so cataclysmic for the German economy?</p>   <div>\n            <div>\n        <picture>\n            <source srcset=\"https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/6000x3000+0+0/resize/400/quality/85/format/webp/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F3e%2F98%2F85a028714dcfb577869fc1a261ad%2Fgettyimages-1053769156.jpg 400w, https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/6000x3000+0+0/resize/600/quality/85/format/webp/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F3e%2F98%2F85a028714dcfb577869fc1a261ad%2Fgettyimages-1053769156.jpg 600w, https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/6000x3000+0+0/resize/800/quality/85/format/webp/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F3e%2F98%2F85a028714dcfb577869fc1a261ad%2Fgettyimages-1053769156.jpg 800w, https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/6000x3000+0+0/resize/900/quality/85/format/webp/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F3e%2F98%2F85a028714dcfb577869fc1a261ad%2Fgettyimages-1053769156.jpg 900w, https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/6000x3000+0+0/resize/1200/quality/85/format/webp/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F3e%2F98%2F85a028714dcfb577869fc1a261ad%2Fgettyimages-1053769156.jpg 1200w, https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/6000x3000+0+0/resize/1600/quality/85/format/webp/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F3e%2F98%2F85a028714dcfb577869fc1a261ad%2Fgettyimages-1053769156.jpg 1600w, https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/6000x3000+0+0/resize/1800/quality/85/format/webp/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F3e%2F98%2F85a028714dcfb577869fc1a261ad%2Fgettyimages-1053769156.jpg 1800w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1025px) 650px, calc(100vw - 30px)\" type=\"image/webp\"></source>\n            <source srcset=\"https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/6000x3000+0+0/resize/400/quality/85/format/jpeg/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F3e%2F98%2F85a028714dcfb577869fc1a261ad%2Fgettyimages-1053769156.jpg 400w, https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/6000x3000+0+0/resize/600/quality/85/format/jpeg/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F3e%2F98%2F85a028714dcfb577869fc1a261ad%2Fgettyimages-1053769156.jpg 600w, https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/6000x3000+0+0/resize/800/quality/85/format/jpeg/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F3e%2F98%2F85a028714dcfb577869fc1a261ad%2Fgettyimages-1053769156.jpg 800w, https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/6000x3000+0+0/resize/900/quality/85/format/jpeg/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F3e%2F98%2F85a028714dcfb577869fc1a261ad%2Fgettyimages-1053769156.jpg 900w, https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/6000x3000+0+0/resize/1200/quality/85/format/jpeg/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F3e%2F98%2F85a028714dcfb577869fc1a261ad%2Fgettyimages-1053769156.jpg 1200w, https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/6000x3000+0+0/resize/1600/quality/85/format/jpeg/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F3e%2F98%2F85a028714dcfb577869fc1a261ad%2Fgettyimages-1053769156.jpg 1600w, https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/6000x3000+0+0/resize/1800/quality/85/format/jpeg/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F3e%2F98%2F85a028714dcfb577869fc1a261ad%2Fgettyimages-1053769156.jpg 1800w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1025px) 650px, calc(100vw - 30px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\"></source>\n            <img src=\"https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/6000x3000+0+0/resize/1100/quality/50/format/jpeg/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F3e%2F98%2F85a028714dcfb577869fc1a261ad%2Fgettyimages-1053769156.jpg\" alt=\"GettyImages-1053769156.jpg\" />\n        </picture>\n</div>\n<div>\n    <p><span>\n        Rawf8/Getty Images\n    </span>\n</p></div>\n   </div>\n   <h3>Why Germany was insulated from the first China Shock</h3>   <p>After China joined the World Trade Organization in 2001, it kicked its industrialization into high gear and flooded global markets with cheap manufactured goods. The economists David Autor, David Dorn, and Gordon Hanson later <a href=\"https://www.ddorn.net/papers/Autor-Dorn-Hanson-ChinaShock.pdf\" target=\"_blank\"><u>dubbed</u></a> this \"the China Shock.\" This shock vaporized chunks of the industrial bases of nations around the world, including the United States.</p>   <p>Germany, however, was largely insulated from the first China Shock.</p>   <p>Sander Tordoir, an economist at the Centre for European Reform, a think tank, says a big reason was that China's export boom back then was in low-end manufactured products like textiles, toys, consumer electronics, and furniture, \"not in the industries that are the hallmark of the German economy, namely autos, chemicals, and machines.\"</p>   <p>Jens Südekum, a professor of economics at Düsseldorf University who is <a href=\"https://www.hhu.de/en/news/jens-suedekum-wird-persoenlicher-berater-von-finanzminister-klingbeil\" target=\"_blank\"><u>currently advising</u></a> the German finance minister, <a href=\"https://academic.oup.com/jeea/article-abstract/12/6/1643/2319741?redirectedFrom=fulltext\" target=\"_blank\"><u>published influential research</u></a> on the first China Shock in Germany. He says it did disrupt some low-end manufacturing sectors in Germany, including their shoemaking industry. \"But those were small sectors,\" he says.</p>   <p>In fact, Südekum says, the German manufacturing sector actually flourished thanks to trade with China. As China constructed sprawling new factories, they needed industrial machines and equipment that German companies (including VDMA members) specialize in making.</p>   \n   <p>\"After China joined the WTO in 2001, the German machinery sector and China, we had the perfect complimentary relationship,\" Richtberg says. \"We made a lot of money in China.\"</p>   <p>And China's newly prosperous middle and upper classes increasingly wanted German-made cars manufactured by the likes of Volkswagen, Mercedes-Benz, and BMW. \"The Chinese were crazy about German cars, so the German car industry made a fortune in the Chinese market,\" Südekum says.</p>   <p>Meanwhile, in the early 2000s, Germany pursued important labor market reforms that helped reduce unemployment and keep its manufacturing sector competitive. And the integration of post-communist nations into the European Union trading bloc proved to be a huge boon for German manufacturers, who were able to find new customers and establish more efficient supply chains with access to cheaper labor and resources across the former Iron Curtain.</p>   <p>And, at least during certain periods, exchange rates may have helped too. At the turn of the millennium, Germany joined together with other European nations in a monetary union and adopted the euro. Many of the nations in that union have tended to have weaker economies. And, as Germany ran large trade surpluses — something that tends to push up the value of a currency — German exports may have benefited from <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/article/markets/currencies/german-conservative-merz-says-germany-benefits-from-weak-euro-idUSS8N1UL00Q/\" target=\"_blank\"><u>a weaker currency</u></a> than the country otherwise would have had. This was especially the case <a href=\"https://www.spiegel.de/international/europe/profiting-from-pain-europe-s-crisis-is-germany-s-blessing-a-808248.html\" target=\"_blank\"><u>during periods like</u></a> the European debt crisis. This lower value for their currency meant that German exports were relatively cheaper for Chinese consumers (although many other European nations also use the euro, and none of them seem to have benefited as much from trade with China).</p>   <p>Compared to the manufacturing sectors of other Western nations, which shriveled in the face of Chinese competition, \"Germany was really an outlier,\" Tordoir says. He says a good part of that was luck: German manufacturers happened to make the stuff that China needed to industrialize and wanted to consume.</p>   \n   <p>By 2012, German exports of goods to China reached almost 3% of its GDP. \"That's a very big export business to one country,\" Tordoir says. By comparison, the value of U.S. exports of goods to China has never surpassed <a href=\"https://www.cer.eu/sites/default/files/pbrief_ST_BS_china_shock_16.1.25.pdf\" target=\"_blank\"><u>one percent</u></a> of its GDP.</p>   <h3>Why the second China Shock is different</h3>   <p>Many economists are now warning the world about the onslaught of \"a second China Shock.\" Tordoir says the one crucial driver of this shock is that, essentially, China has been trying to export its way out of a domestic slump ever since its real-estate bubble burst around 2021. Chinese exports have exploded since then.</p>   <p>But, unlike the first China Shock, the sequel is striking the core of Germany's economy. Chinese companies have leapfrogged to become worthy competitors in a slew of advanced manufacturing sectors, from machinery and equipment to electronics to automobiles, and China's homegrown competitors are now beginning to eat the lunch of German manufacturers. Demand for German-made products is in free fall, both in China and in export markets around the world.</p>   <p>For a long time, China was one of Germany's biggest — if not biggest — customers. Now the country has emerged as one of Germany's biggest competitors.</p>   <p>The numbers on this reversal are stunning. For example, in 2019, China <a href=\"https://www.cer.eu/sites/default/files/pbrief_ST_BS_china_shock_16.1.25.pdf\" target=\"_blank\"><u>was a net importer</u></a> of passenger vehicles, importing about a million more cars than they exported. With its advances in making electric vehicles, by 2023, it emerged as the world's largest exporter of cars, exporting around five million more than it imported.</p>   <p>An important part of China's metamorphosis can be tracked back to 2015, when Chinese political leaders unveiled \"Made in China 2025,\" a ten-year plan aimed at making China an advanced manufacturing powerhouse. Since then, China has invested heavily in research and development and pursued a range of industrial policies aimed at upgrading their technological and production prowess and reducing their dependence on foreign competitors. A 2024 analysis from <em>The South China Morning Post</em> found that China had achieved <a href=\"https://www.scmp.com/news/china/science/article/3260307/made-china-2025-china-meets-most-targets-manufacturing-plan-proving-us-tariffs-and-sanctions\" target=\"_blank\"><u>86%</u></a> of the 260 goals set out in the plan.</p>   \n   <p>Chinese companies are now making — and designing — smartphones as technologically sophisticated as iPhones. China leads the world in lithium-ion battery and solar panel production. It has AI and robotics companies that are putting many European ones to shame. It's making rapid progress in manufacturing airplanes and ships. And, potentially devastating for Germany's economy, it's now producing world-class electric cars and competing head to head in making industrial machines and equipment.</p>   <p>\"What's really special about China is they have those long-term strategic plans — and they actually execute them,\" Südekum says. He says the best example is the car industry. \"China has orchestrated this transformation of their own domestic car market towards electric vehicles. They became the major exporter for electric vehicles, and now they don't need the imports from Germany anymore.\"</p>   <p>Richtberg, who serves as the head of the Foreign Trade Department at the VDMA, told me their manufacturers began noticing something big had changed in their business relationship with China around 2022 or 2023, in the waning days of the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>   <p>Their executives and workers had stopped making trips to China during the pandemic. \" And then when they got back to China after two or three years,\" Richtberg says, \"our machine makers said, 'Wow, they've developed a lot.'\"</p>   <p>Richtberg says that Chinese manufacturers now offer machine products that are, on average, around 30 percent cheaper than German-made ones. These products may be lower quality, he says, but customers often seem to believe they're \"good enough\" for their purposes.</p>   <p>A crucial question regarding the second China Shock is how much of China's competitive edge is the result of unfair competition? Richtberg suggested that Chinese competitors have a ton of natural advantages over them, whether it's the economies of scale they have from operating in a massive market, their incredible supply chains, the long hours they work, their willingness to work for relatively meager pay, their investments in innovation, lower taxes and a lack of onerous regulations.</p>   \n   <p>However, Richtberg says, there are plenty of non-legitimate aspects to Chinese competition that make it an uneven playing field. For one, he says, their Chinese competitors tend to skirt regulations.</p>   <p>For example, he says, European companies <a href=\"https://europa.eu/youreurope/business/product-requirements/labels-markings/ce-marking/index_en.htm\" target=\"_blank\"><u>mark their products</u></a> with a symbol, \"CE,\" when their products comply with European regulatory standards and meet <a href=\"https://single-market-economy.ec.europa.eu/single-market/goods/ce-marking_en\" target=\"_blank\"><u>health, safety, and environmental protection requirements</u></a>.</p>   <p>\"And when European companies put it on their machine, we believe them,\" Richtberg says. \"What Chinese companies are doing, they're putting a logo on their products — <a href=\"https://www.kimuagroup.com/news/differences-between-ce-and-china-export-markings/\" target=\"_blank\"><u>which looks pretty much exactly the same</u></a> — but it means exported from China.\"</p>   <p>Besides some differences in spacing, the symbols look almost identical. It's almost as if Chinese manufacturers are messing with their Western competitors. \"It would be funny if it weren't so sad for our industry,\" Richtberg says.</p>   <div>\n            <div>\n        <picture>\n            <source srcset=\"https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/1422x936+0+0/resize/400/quality/85/format/webp/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Ff8%2Ff1%2Faca6b05640b78fa3d2e7cd8538ca%2Fscreenshot-2025-09-25-at-2-08-38-pm.png 400w, https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/1422x936+0+0/resize/600/quality/85/format/webp/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Ff8%2Ff1%2Faca6b05640b78fa3d2e7cd8538ca%2Fscreenshot-2025-09-25-at-2-08-38-pm.png 600w, https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/1422x936+0+0/resize/800/quality/85/format/webp/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Ff8%2Ff1%2Faca6b05640b78fa3d2e7cd8538ca%2Fscreenshot-2025-09-25-at-2-08-38-pm.png 800w, https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/1422x936+0+0/resize/900/quality/85/format/webp/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Ff8%2Ff1%2Faca6b05640b78fa3d2e7cd8538ca%2Fscreenshot-2025-09-25-at-2-08-38-pm.png 900w, https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/1422x936+0+0/resize/1200/quality/85/format/webp/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Ff8%2Ff1%2Faca6b05640b78fa3d2e7cd8538ca%2Fscreenshot-2025-09-25-at-2-08-38-pm.png 1200w, https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/1422x936+0+0/resize/1600/quality/85/format/webp/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Ff8%2Ff1%2Faca6b05640b78fa3d2e7cd8538ca%2Fscreenshot-2025-09-25-at-2-08-38-pm.png 1600w, https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/1422x936+0+0/resize/1800/quality/85/format/webp/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Ff8%2Ff1%2Faca6b05640b78fa3d2e7cd8538ca%2Fscreenshot-2025-09-25-at-2-08-38-pm.png 1800w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1025px) 650px, calc(100vw - 30px)\" type=\"image/webp\"></source>\n            <source srcset=\"https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/1422x936+0+0/resize/400/quality/85/format/png/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Ff8%2Ff1%2Faca6b05640b78fa3d2e7cd8538ca%2Fscreenshot-2025-09-25-at-2-08-38-pm.png 400w, https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/1422x936+0+0/resize/600/quality/85/format/png/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Ff8%2Ff1%2Faca6b05640b78fa3d2e7cd8538ca%2Fscreenshot-2025-09-25-at-2-08-38-pm.png 600w, https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/1422x936+0+0/resize/800/quality/85/format/png/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Ff8%2Ff1%2Faca6b05640b78fa3d2e7cd8538ca%2Fscreenshot-2025-09-25-at-2-08-38-pm.png 800w, https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/1422x936+0+0/resize/900/quality/85/format/png/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Ff8%2Ff1%2Faca6b05640b78fa3d2e7cd8538ca%2Fscreenshot-2025-09-25-at-2-08-38-pm.png 900w, https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/1422x936+0+0/resize/1200/quality/85/format/png/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Ff8%2Ff1%2Faca6b05640b78fa3d2e7cd8538ca%2Fscreenshot-2025-09-25-at-2-08-38-pm.png 1200w, https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/1422x936+0+0/resize/1600/quality/85/format/png/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Ff8%2Ff1%2Faca6b05640b78fa3d2e7cd8538ca%2Fscreenshot-2025-09-25-at-2-08-38-pm.png 1600w, https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/1422x936+0+0/resize/1800/quality/85/format/png/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Ff8%2Ff1%2Faca6b05640b78fa3d2e7cd8538ca%2Fscreenshot-2025-09-25-at-2-08-38-pm.png 1800w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1025px) 650px, calc(100vw - 30px)\" type=\"image/png\"></source>\n            <img src=\"https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/1422x936+0+0/resize/1100/quality/50/format/png/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Ff8%2Ff1%2Faca6b05640b78fa3d2e7cd8538ca%2Fscreenshot-2025-09-25-at-2-08-38-pm.png\" alt=\"Screenshot 2025-09-25 at 2.08.38 PM.png\" />\n        </picture>\n</div>\n<div>\n    <p><span>\n        Kimua Group\n    </span>\n</p></div>\n   </div>\n   <p>An even bigger issue that could make this unfair competition is that the Chinese government has been showering their country's manufacturers with subsidies. Chinese manufacturers are coddled by the government by, for example, being given free or cheap land, access to cheap credit, and support even when they fail to become profitable. A <a href=\"https://www.imf.org/en/Publications/WP/Issues/2025/08/07/Industrial-Policy-in-China-Quantification-and-Impact-on-Misallocation-568888#:~:text=Summary,policy%20and%20increase%20its%20transparency.\" target=\"_blank\"><u>recent IMF study</u></a> estimated that annual Chinese subsidies to their industries amount to a staggering 4 percent of their GDP.</p>   <h3>How Germany should respond</h3>   <p>For years, Richtberg says, the VDMA has been urging Germany and the EU to get China to play by the rules, follow regulations, and end subsidies that make global competition unfair. But, he says, China hasn't been listening. The VDMA is calling on the German government to lower taxes and reduce regulations so their companies can be more competitive. And, in a break with the past, the VDMA is now expressing support for erecting countervailing tariffs when foreign products are found to be made with the support of government subsidies. Most of the economists we spoke to also expressed support for countervailing tariffs.</p>   \n   <p>However, European Union tariffs will only protect German companies within Europe. A crucial problem for Germany is that its economy has been incredibly dependent on exports. According to <a href=\"https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/NE.EXP.GNFS.ZS?locations=DE-US\" target=\"_blank\"><u>data from the World Bank</u></a>, in 2024, German exports accounted for more than 42 percent of its GDP. Compare that to the United States, where exports accounted for less than 11 percent of GDP. How will Germany compete with China in export markets outside the EU?</p>   <p>This gets to why the second China Shock in Germany could prove much more devastating than the first one proved to be in the United States. For one thing, the first China Shock centered on the imports of low-end manufacturing goods. Even then, it killed more than a million manufacturing jobs in the US and workers and communities struggled to adapt.</p>   <p>And the US has long been less reliant on manufacturing than Germany. When the China Shock was hitting the US economy in the early 2000s, manufacturing (value-added) accounted for about 13 percent of US GDP. Today it accounts for only about 10 percent of U.S. GDP. Manufacturing accounts <a href=\"https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/NV.IND.MANF.ZS?locations=DE-US\" target=\"_blank\"><u>for about 18 percent</u></a> of Germany's GDP, according to the World Bank.</p>   <p>The export-led industrial model that Germany has pursued for decades is now at a crossroads. In addition to the China Shock, there's the retreat of the United States behind a tariff wall. That means Germany is struggling to sell products in what were long its two biggest export markets.</p>   <p>And, Tordoir says, high U.S. tariffs against Chinese goods are hurting Germany through another channel: \"Chinese products are bouncing off the U.S. tariff wall and are being rerouted.\" So, Tordoir says, Chinese exporters are looking to sell more in Europe, where there are much lower tariffs.</p>   <p>Tordoir says one core issue in all of this is that Chinese consumers don't consume enough, and he hopes that one win-win solution for everyone will be convincing China to pursue policy reforms that increase their domestic consumption and stop their export onslaught.</p>   \n   <p>Germany — which itself long pursued an export-led growth model and ran huge trade surpluses, sometimes to the chagrin of other nations — has recently begun working to increase domestic spending. The country, under Chancellor Friedrich Merz, has passed constitutional reforms that allow the government to spend more, and the government has begun to do so on things like defense and infrastructure.</p>   <p>\"The only way out that I can see is that we need to rely on internal demand, demand from the European Union really,\" Südekum says. He thinks that Germany's recent spending reforms, which he was involved in, are an important first step. As a next step, he and Tordoir both expressed support for the idea that the European Union should develop incentive schemes to encourage European consumers to \"Buy European.\"</p>   <p>As far as other policies to help Germany overcome its current struggles, some of the economists we spoke with, ironically, pointed to China as worthy of some emulation.</p>   <p>Tordoir said it's worth studying how the Chinese government made strategic investments and pursued far-sighted industrial policies that are now paying incredible dividends. It may be harder to wrangle a diverse group of liberal democracies with different interests, but he hopes that Germany will join other EU nations to develop EU-wide industrial policies to boost their own strategic sectors.</p>   <p>Marin worries that Germany has been failing to innovate in crucial technological sectors, including electric vehicles and batteries. A new book titled <a href=\"https://swiftpress.com/book/kaput/\" target=\"_blank\"><em><u>Kaput: The End of the German Miracle</u></em></a><em>, </em>by German business journalist Wolfgang Münchau, offers a rather harsh critique of German leaders in recent decades for clinging to an old industrial model and being unwilling to make important investments and policy changes in the face of epic technological changes. Germany lacks a vibrant digital sector and a significant venture capital industry — and even its world-famous automakers have been slow to pivot to electric vehicles and the integration of cutting-edge software into their cars.</p>   <p>Marin says a big reason for China's technological leapfrogging was due to a particular model in which it got Western companies to form joint ventures with Chinese companies, thereby transferring technology and know-how to their workers and entrepreneurs. She <a href=\"https://cepr.org/voxeu/columns/china-shock-hits-germany\" target=\"_blank\"><u>argues</u></a> that Germany should \"reverse-engineer\" this model, and get foreign companies — including from China — to now help German workers and companies advance technologically since they've fallen behind in crucial areas.</p>\n</div>"

No, they got robbed.\"</p>   <h3>A deal offered to nearly the entire federal workforce</h3>   <p>It was just eight days after the presidential inauguration when the Office of Personnel Management sent an email <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2025/01/28/nx-s1-5278604/federal-workers-resign-september-telework\" target=\"_blank\">inviting nearly the entire federal workforce, more than 2 million people, to resign</a>. The deferred resignation program, as the Trump administration called it, was modeled on a deal that Elon Musk — who was then leading the Department of Government Efficiency — had fashioned for <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2025/02/05/nx-s1-5286477/fork-in-the-road-twitter-federal-workers\" target=\"_blank\">employees at Twitter</a>. Initially, employees had just over a week to decide whether to accept. Questions abounded over <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2025/01/31/nx-s1-5282075/trump-federal-employees-resignation-offer-legal-questions\" target=\"_blank\">whether the deal was even legal</a>.</p>   \n   <p>In late March and April, a number of federal agencies <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2025/04/08/nx-s1-5343631/trump-federal-employees-resign-layoffs\" target=\"_blank\">reopened the offer</a>. Doubts over the legality of the deal had eased. Uptake was far swifter.</p>   <p>Now, with months of paid administrative leave coming to an end, those formally separating from the government are confronting a mix of emotions, including regret, resentment and resignation.</p>   <p>Many say they would never have left their posts had they felt staying was an option.</p>   <div>\n            <div>\n        <picture>\n            <source srcset=\"https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/5663x3775+0+0/resize/400/quality/85/format/webp/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fcb%2Fb7%2F06e70822454a8f1db497221f658d%2Fgettyimages-2208340278.jpg 400w, https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/5663x3775+0+0/resize/600/quality/85/format/webp/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fcb%2Fb7%2F06e70822454a8f1db497221f658d%2Fgettyimages-2208340278.jpg 600w, https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/5663x3775+0+0/resize/800/quality/85/format/webp/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fcb%2Fb7%2F06e70822454a8f1db497221f658d%2Fgettyimages-2208340278.jpg 800w, https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/5663x3775+0+0/resize/900/quality/85/format/webp/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fcb%2Fb7%2F06e70822454a8f1db497221f658d%2Fgettyimages-2208340278.jpg 900w, https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/5663x3775+0+0/resize/1200/quality/85/format/webp/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fcb%2Fb7%2F06e70822454a8f1db497221f658d%2Fgettyimages-2208340278.jpg 1200w, https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/5663x3775+0+0/resize/1600/quality/85/format/webp/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fcb%2Fb7%2F06e70822454a8f1db497221f658d%2Fgettyimages-2208340278.jpg 1600w, https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/5663x3775+0+0/resize/1800/quality/85/format/webp/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fcb%2Fb7%2F06e70822454a8f1db497221f658d%2Fgettyimages-2208340278.jpg 1800w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1025px) 650px, calc(100vw - 30px)\" type=\"image/webp\"></source>\n            <source srcset=\"https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/5663x3775+0+0/resize/400/quality/85/format/jpeg/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fcb%2Fb7%2F06e70822454a8f1db497221f658d%2Fgettyimages-2208340278.jpg 400w, https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/5663x3775+0+0/resize/600/quality/85/format/jpeg/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fcb%2Fb7%2F06e70822454a8f1db497221f658d%2Fgettyimages-2208340278.jpg 600w, https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/5663x3775+0+0/resize/800/quality/85/format/jpeg/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fcb%2Fb7%2F06e70822454a8f1db497221f658d%2Fgettyimages-2208340278.jpg 800w, https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/5663x3775+0+0/resize/900/quality/85/format/jpeg/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fcb%2Fb7%2F06e70822454a8f1db497221f658d%2Fgettyimages-2208340278.jpg 900w, https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/5663x3775+0+0/resize/1200/quality/85/format/jpeg/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fcb%2Fb7%2F06e70822454a8f1db497221f658d%2Fgettyimages-2208340278.jpg 1200w, https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/5663x3775+0+0/resize/1600/quality/85/format/jpeg/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fcb%2Fb7%2F06e70822454a8f1db497221f658d%2Fgettyimages-2208340278.jpg 1600w, https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/5663x3775+0+0/resize/1800/quality/85/format/jpeg/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fcb%2Fb7%2F06e70822454a8f1db497221f658d%2Fgettyimages-2208340278.jpg 1800w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1025px) 650px, calc(100vw - 30px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\"></source>\n            <img src=\"https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/5663x3775+0+0/resize/1100/quality/50/format/jpeg/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fcb%2Fb7%2F06e70822454a8f1db497221f658d%2Fgettyimages-2208340278.jpg\" alt=\"Scott Kupor speaks during a Senate committee hearing on April 3.

She had heard him rail about waste and bloat in the government. She feared training would be among the first things to go.</p>   \n   <h3>After passing on the first buyout offer, things changed</h3>   <p>Cherkaoui did not take the Trump administration's first buyout offer, in late January. She thought it looked shady.</p>   <p>But in the weeks that followed, managers at the USDA sent memos foreshadowing big changes ahead — mass layoffs, relocations and more. Rumors also ran rampant.</p>   <p>\"'It might be that we're moving people out. It might be that you could be busted down by two [pay] grades,'\" Cherkaoui recalls hearing.</p>   <p>During Trump's first term, some USDA staff members were relocated to Kansas City, Missouri. A move to the middle of the country was a nonstarter for Cherkaoui, given that her entire extended family lives in the Washington, D.C., area.</p>   <p>So when she got the email from the USDA offering a second round of buyouts, in April, she took it.</p>   <p>\"It was the hardest button click I've ever clicked in my life,\" she says. \"I went back and forth on it for a couple of days, but I knew ultimately that that was going to be the right choice.\"</p>   <h3>A data analyst in the Midwest regrets leaving</h3>   <p>In the Midwest, a data analyst for the Transportation Department was wrestling with the same decision.</p>   <p>\"I might have had a minor anxiety attack in the lobby of my building as I was pacing around, considering it,\" says J., who analyzed crash statistics, road quality, bridge quality and other trends for the government. NPR agreed to identify him by only his first initial because he fears professional repercussions for speaking publicly about a past employer.</p>   <p>Like Cherkaoui, J. did not consider the buyout when it was first offered in January. But within weeks, Trump's Department of Government Efficiency had terminated the lease for his office as <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2025/03/08/nx-s1-5321323/trump-doge-gsa-federal-buildings\" target=\"_blank\">part of its broader downsizing efforts</a>.</p>   <p>\"Within the calendar year of 2025, we were going to be out on the street,\" he says. \"I really had no idea how that was going to pan out.\"</p>   \n   <p>Adding to the uncertainty, Trump issued an executive order outlining a consolidation of some IT-related work. J. worried his job could be moved from the Midwest to Washington, D.C.</p>   <p>Given this environment, he had started applying for jobs in the private sector, and by April, he had gotten a couple of offers. So right before the deadline for the second round of buyouts, he accepted the Trump administration's offer, went on paid leave from the government and soon started a new job.</p>   <p>In the months since, things have not unfolded as he had expected. His agency's office lease was restored. His old team has not been slated for a move. Looking back, he feels he was forced into an impossible decision, threatened with changes that never came to fruition.</p>   <p>Meanwhile, he says, his new job is not nearly as fulfilling as his work for the government.

Fearing her agency would fire her again at the first opportunity, she opted to resign during the second round of buyouts, giving up on her longtime goal of working on energy policy at the national level.</p>   \n   <p>The Energy Department did not end up firing its reinstated probationary employees when the court order was lifted, nor did it conduct mass layoffs of other workers, as many had feared. A department spokesperson told NPR that approximately 3,000 employees participated in the deferred resignation program, roughly 20% of its workforce.</p>   <p>Marie's search for a new job started slowly, despite her years of experience in the private sector. She believes one factor was the economic uncertainty caused by Trump's tariffs. She worried about stalling out her career. Between her onboarding, her firing and her administrative leave, she had not done any substantial work in almost a year.</p>   <p>\"I did some part-time research work over the summer, basically for free, because I just wanted to work and use my brain for things,\" she says.</p>   <p>She was still getting her federal paycheck and benefits, for which she was thankful.</p>   <p>\"But as a taxpayer, I feel that it's a long time to pay someone not to work,\" she says.</p>   <p>Finally, just in the last month, she got not one but three job offers. She accepted a position at a local utility and thinks it could turn into a long career. She hesitates when asked whether she'd ever want to work for the federal government again.</p>   <p>\"I don't think it would be something I'd be hurrying back to do,\" she says.</p>   <h3>Hundreds of applications end in \"No, thank you\"</h3>   <p>Cherkaoui, the former USDA training specialist, hasn't been so fortunate on the job front.</p>   <p>It's not for lack of trying. The market in the Washington, D.C., area is saturated with former feds. The state of Maryland, home to several large federal agencies, lost 15,100 federal jobs between January and August, according to the <a href=\"https://www.labor.maryland.gov/whatsnews/mlraug2025.shtml\" target=\"_blank\">Maryland Department of Labor</a>.</p>   <p>At 40, Cherkaoui has gotten very few interviews, despite her skills and even though she has been applying to jobs nonstop.</p>   \n   <p>\"Literally hundreds of jobs,\" she says. \"It's just 'No, thank you;

Being critical of my country — that's showing love. If I didn't love and didn't care, I would let you act like a damn fool,\" she says. \"You have to be able to say something, and if you can't say anything, you're lost.\"</p>   <p>Cherkaoui says her former office at the USDA has been disbanded. She estimates that about half of her colleagues left voluntarily, while the rest have scattered to different parts of the agency. These days, she finds herself thinking often of those who remain in government and everything they're enduring.</p>   <p>\"It is much more than anything that they've ever had to endure before,\" she says.</p>\n</div>"
