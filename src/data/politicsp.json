This, in effect, will leave an <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2025/09/08/nx-s1-5529364/new-snap-rules-could-result-in-2-4-million-people-losing-benefits-each-month\" target=\"_blank\">estimated 2.4 million Americans</a> without food aid.</p>   \n   <p>\"The national food insecurity survey is a critical, reliable data source that shows how many families in America struggle to put food on the table,\" Crystal FitzSimons, president of the Food Research and Action Center (FRAC) told NPR. FRAC is an anti-hunger organization that advocates for food security in the U.S.</p>   <p>FitzSimons said that without the annual report, advocates and policymakers won't have a clear lens on the scale of hunger in America, and how to prevent it.</p>   <p>\"Without that data, we are flying blind, and we don't know the impact,\" FitzSimons said.</p>   <p>According <a href=\"https://www.ers.usda.gov/topics/food-nutrition-assistance/food-security-in-the-us/key-statistics-graphics\" target=\"_blank\">to the USDA</a>, 47.4 million people lived in food insecure households in 2023. This means that at certain times, \"these households were uncertain of having or unable to acquire enough food to meet the needs of all their members.\" Among those, nearly 14 million were children.</p>   <p>In the announcement, the Agriculture Department stated, \"trends in the prevalence of food insecurity have remained virtually unchanged.\"</p>   <p>Experts are saying that's not true.</p>   <p>\"Last year's report for 2023 showed an increase in food insecurity,\" Kyle Ross, a policy analyst with the progressive research group the Center for American Progress, told NPR. \"At that point, it has been the largest rate of food insecurity that the country has seen since 2014 and substantially larger than just two years prior.\"</p>   \n   <p>The 2023 report revealed that the number of food-insecure children in the United States increased by 3.2% compared to 2022's annual report, <a href=\"https://frac.org/hunger-poverty-america\" target=\"_blank\">according to the FRAC</a>.</p>   <p>Ross also said the Agriculture Department's claim that the annual report on food and nutrition insecurity in America might be politicized is not accurate.</p>   <p>\"That has no bearing in reality whatsoever,\" Ross said.</p>   <p>Created during the Clinton administration, the Household Food Security Report has been a yearly fixture in understanding food insecurity and policy for vulnerable Americans. The survey has been published annually for 30 years, throughout both Republican and Democratic administrations.</p>   \n   <p>Ross thinks that the higher job requirements people have to meet to access SNAP benefits, and the resulting rise in food insecurity, is the likely motive behind the Trump administration scrapping the report.</p>   <p>\"This will substantially increase food insecurity, and unfortunately, that will make itself clear in the data of food insecurity reports in the next couple of years,\" Ross said.</p>   <p>The USDA did not respond to questions from NPR about the reasons behind the report's cancellation.</p>   <p>The last report will be released on Oct. 22, according to <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/trump-ending-america-hunger-report-snap-cuts-750f90757f50ab2d8bc97dfca5a917dd\" target=\"_blank\">The Associated Press</a>.

    "body": "<div>\n      <p>NPR's Ayesha Rascoe asks Minnesota lawmakers Lisa Demuth and Erin Murphy about prospects for gun violence legislation in a special session.</p>   \n</div><div>\n    <p>AYESHA RASCOE, HOST: </p><p> Students returned to classrooms at Annunciation Catholic School in Minneapolis on Tuesday for the first time since a gunman killed two children and injured 21 other students and parishioners at a mass there. Tuesday was also the day voters filled the seat left vacant by the murder of Minnesota lawmaker Melissa Hortman. Speaker Emerita Hortman was shot in her home earlier this summer, the same night state Senator John Hoffman was also shot and injured in his home. Now Governor Tim Walz says he wants a special session of the legislature to address the state's gun laws. Republican Lisa Demuth is Minnesota's current House speaker, and she joins us now. Welcome.</p><p>LISA DEMUTH: Thank you, Ayesha. Good to talk with you.</p><p>RASCOE: And on the other side of the Capitol and the aisle is state Senator Erin Murphy, a Democrat. Welcome to you, as well.</p><p>ERIN MURPHY: It's good to be with you.</p><p>RASCOE: So for both of you, I mean, so much has happened in your state in the last few months, how are you both doing?</p><p>DEMUTH: In Minnesota, that is such a common question that we get, and I fail to come up with the correct answer. I don't know that there is a right answer, but I think as we continue to heal, we are resilient, but it is a very painful time.</p><p>RASCOE: And Senator Murphy?</p><p>MURPHY: I think the best answer I can give is I'm doing well enough today. And I'd served with Speaker Emerita Hortman for all of my career, and she was well known and deeply loved. The recovery for all of us is going to take some time.</p><p>RASCOE: Speaker Demuth, I know you had a special and a close relationship with Melissa Hortman, as well.</p><p>DEMUTH: I did. When I first came into the legislature in 2019, Speaker Emerita Hortman was the speaker then. She is the only one that I served under until we came back this year in the tie, and I became speaker of the House. But our working relationship really developed in 2023, when my party was in the minority. Speaker Hortman, at the time, they were in the full majority in the state. And yet as a new minority leader, she reached out to me and said, I want to meet weekly with you.</p><p>And she didn't need my votes, but it was important to her that we would develop a working relationship. Even though we didn't agree politically, we found common ground what could we get done or kind of where we were both at on issues, but also things outside of that. Her love for gardening. Her love for dogs. Common things - talking about just being parents. And so that relationship and the way she led as a leader has really formed the way I do my work as speaker of the House now.</p><p>RASCOE: Talking about working across the aisles, like, if Governor Walz does call a special session on gun violence, what realistically could be accomplished?</p><p>DEMUTH: The way that we are looking at it in the House, specifically House Republicans, is it's broader than that. We have to look at mental health. We also have to look at keeping our schools safe and then punishing criminals. There was a tragedy in my community, in my schools, in 2003, and I had children in the building. And so I don't just say this as an elected official or speaker of the House. It is a much broader issue of mental health and how we treat each other.</p><p>RASCOE: And just to follow up on that. So your own children were affected by a school shooting, and it was in Cold Spring, Minnesota, in 2003?</p><p>DEMUTH: That is correct. I had two high school students in the building at the time, and then I had two elementary students that were just across the parking lot. And so as a family and as a community, we've lived that. So I understand it from a little bit different perspective, and that's what I bring into the work that we do in the legislature also.</p><p>RASCOE: Did someone die in that shooting?</p><p>DEMUTH: There were two students that lost their lives. One that day and one just a short two weeks later.</p><p>RASCOE: Well, Senator Murphy, what do you think the approach should be?</p><p>MURPHY: I'm - my background, I'm a nurse and come to this discussion through a lens of prevention and well-being and health. And with Speaker Demuth and the governor, went to the funeral for Fletcher, one of the children killed in Annunciation. And then went to the funeral for Harper, a little girl who was killed in Annunciation. And feel the presence of their stories and their grief and their loss as I think about the work in front of us. We can't go into a special session and not talk about assault weapons. They are weapons of war, intended to harm, destroy and kill in rapid fire.</p><p>And what we saw happen at Annunciation to those families and to those kids was someone standing outside with a high-powered weapon, shoot and harm so many people in a short amount of time. And those children will tell you the story of what they knew. They knew because they'd been through drills that they needed to lay on top of the youngest kids to protect them. They knew what to do. And that by itself, to me, says our politics - something I believe so deeply in our ability in a self-governing America to solve our hard problems. Our politics are failing right now on this issue.</p><p>RASCOE: I do feel like what we're seeing in the conversation we're having right now is what happens, seems to happen over and over again after shootings. Republicans saying, harden the schools, focus on mental health. And then you have Democrats saying, focus on the type of weaponry. Like, how does anything get done?</p><p>MURPHY: We don't agree necessarily on this issue, but I do believe that it is possible for us to find a path forward. As we negotiated probably one of the hardest budgets that I ever have back in June, that was a hard-fought compromise, and we all gave things up. But we got our job done because we all agreed that we shouldn't fail Minnesota.</p><p>DEMUTH: In the House, right now, we are tied 67-67. And what that has done this year is it has required that we work together in a bipartisan fashion. And what that meant is we have co-chairs in every single one of our committees. So Democrats and Republicans have already proven this year that through deliberative legislative action, we can get things done. They're not fast conversations. They're not do this and hope it works but really, really deliberative.</p><p>RASCOE: I want to talk about the heated and divisive political climate we're in right now. I mean, each side is calling the other side evil. We have to be honest about that.</p><p>MURPHY: What I feel alarmed about, Ayesha, is the thing that I watched happen on the day that Melissa and Mark were assassinated and John was wounded. And again, on the day of the school shooting, and again, on the day that Charlie Kirk was killed. There were efforts in social media to drive a narrative and ascribe blame for what happened from a partisan perspective. And it feels like the extremism that is experienced around the world, it's finding its way into the day-to-day work of legislating.</p><p>A number of my colleagues, but one in particular, has experienced over the course of this last weekend a number of death threats coming not just from Minnesota but from other parts of the country, and they are crude and violent in writing threats. That doesn't serve Democratic governing at all. We can't lead in America if we are operating under that kind of fear. Yes, we disagree, and we should be able to say that. Yes, we have free speech rights, and we should speak what we believe. But we shouldn't turn it into such a personal attack that it becomes weaponized.</p><p>RASCOE: Speaker Demuth, do you feel that partisanship has blinded people to others' humanity?</p><p>DEMUTH: In Minnesota, with the hard things that have happened, one of the things that we have talked about with some of my colleagues is people express their grief differently, and we need to give grace in grief. As far as the partisanship of politics, we have to work together and get things done for the greater good. And it takes each one of us individually to try to tone down the way we speak or speak more with kindness, even while there's a strength in getting things done.</p><p>MURPHY: I think Americans need to start looking up and seeing each other again because the path forward for our country, every time we've been in a bad corner like this, is with each other. And I have faith that when we see each other for who we are as people, we will find our way forward.</p><p>RASCOE: That's state Senator Erin Murphy. Also, we heard from Lisa Demuth, speaker of the Minnesota House. Thanks to you both.</p><p>MURPHY: Thank you.</p><p>DEMUTH: Thank you.</p>\n    <p>Copyright © 2025 NPR.  All rights reserved.

    "body": "<div>\n      <p>We look at conservative activist Charlie Kirk's faith, and how it helped form him political beliefs.</p>   \n</div><div>\n    <p>AYESHA RASCOE, HOST: </p><p> Charlie Kirk's Christian faith was central to his life and his political views. NPR political correspondent Sarah McCammon has been listening to some of Kirk's own words about his views on religion and politics, and she joins me now. Good morning.</p><p>SARAH MCCAMMON, BYLINE: Good morning, Ayesha.</p><p>RASCOE: So what do we know about Charlie Kirk's religious beliefs?</p><p>MCCAMMON: Well, Charlie Kirk often talked about his Christian faith. He spoke publicly about growing up attending Christian school and, like many evangelicals, said he made a decision at a young age to give his life to Jesus. In an interview six years ago with David Brody of the Christian Broadcasting Network, Kirk said that his faith had deepened around the time he got out of high school and founded Turning Point USA, his organization for young conservatives.</p><p>(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)</p><p>CHARLIE KIRK: I started to experience real adversity. I started to come in a much closer relationship with Jesus Christ and reading my Bible more and becoming more essentially unapologetic about my Christianity 'cause I was given a choice. I could try to descend more into this kind of secular world or reaffirm my faith. And, you know, that's exactly what I did.</p><p>MCCAMMON: Now, Turning Point USA is a political organization that describes itself as training young people to promote ideas like free markets and limited government. But later, Kirk founded a spin-off group called TPUSA Faith whose mission is to, quote, \"eliminate wokeism from the American pulpit.\" That was more focused on churches. And while Kirk had friendly relationships with like-minded people of other faith traditions - including some politically conservative Jews and Roman Catholics, among others - he was himself a Protestant and specifically an Evangelical.</p><p>RASCOE: And how did his beliefs show up in politics?</p><p>MCCAMMON: Well, Kirk often referenced his Christian faith when he talked about political issues. For example, his belief that when it comes to helping the needy, churches - not the government - should be responsible. He also cited his faith in connection with some of his most controversial ideas. He described DEI - diversity, equity and inclusion - as unbiblical. He argued against abortion by saying that an embryo is, quote, \"a baby made in the image of God deserving of protection.\" And he described being transgender as, quote, \"a throbbing middle finger to God.\"</p><p>RASCOE: Critics have described Charlie Kirk as promoting Christian nationalism, or the belief that the American system of government should be based on Christianity. How did he talk about the connection between religion and politics?</p><p>MCCAMMON: You know, this is interesting, Ayesha. Earlier in his career, he expressed the view that Christian conservatives had, at times, gone too far in trying to impose their religious beliefs on the rest of society through politics. Back in 2018, while talking with the conservative podcaster David Rubin, Kirk said that had been a big mistake.</p><p>(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)</p><p>KIRK: Because it created this kind of counter revolution, which is, I don't want to have to live the way some Christian in Alabama wants me to live. Does that make sense?</p><p>DAVID RUBIN: Yeah, yeah.</p><p>KIRK: So it's the imposition of those values through legislation and government, which is something I don't necessarily support, right?</p><p>RUBIN: Yeah.</p><p>KIRK: So I try to always advocate for every one of my political positions through a secular world view.</p><p>MCCAMMON: And at that point, Kirk said he believed in the separation of church and state, but he later reversed that and described that idea as a fabrication. Here he is last year, arguing that the U.S. was set up by and for not just Christians, but specifically Protestant Christians. And Kirk said he did not think the country could function well any other way.</p><p>(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)</p><p>KIRK: The body politic of America was so Christian and was so Protestant that our form and structure of government was built for the people that believed in Christ, our Lord. One of the reasons we're living through a constitutional crisis is that we no longer have a Christian nation, but we have a Christian form of government, and they're incompatible. So you cannot have liberty if you do not have a Christian population.</p><p>MCCAMMON: So clearly, he went through a shift in his thinking about the proper role of religion in politics.</p><p>RASCOE: How is Kirk's faith shaping the way he's remembered?</p><p>MCCAMMON: Well, he was a polarizing figure in life and in his death. Some of his supporters are describing him as a martyr for the Christian faith. Here's Cissie Graham Lynch - the granddaughter of the late Reverend Billy Graham - comparing Kirk to Stephen, who's recognized as Christianity's first martyr.</p><p>CISSIE GRAHAM LYNCH: Charlie was a modern-day Stephen. His life, and now his death, testify that the gospel is worth everything.</p><p>MCCAMMON: Now, others worry about this framing. I spoke recently with a scholar of Christian nationalism, Matthew Bodie, at the University of North Georgia, who warns that this kind of talk can lead to escalation of both rhetoric and sometimes of violence. And he said that can ultimately be dangerous for everyone.</p><p>RASCOE: That's NPR's Sarah McCammon. Thank you so much.</p><p>MCCAMMON: Thank you.</p>\n    <p>Copyright © 2025 NPR.

The answer we know from the gospel is love and always love. Love for our enemies and love for those who persecute us.\"</p>   <p>Last week prosecutors <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2025/09/16/nx-s1-5542545/utah-files-murder-charges-against-tyler-robinson\" target=\"_blank\">filed murder charges</a> against <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2025/09/18/nx-s1-5544446/charlie-kirk-suspect-shooter-motive\" target=\"_blank\">22-year-old Tyler Robinson</a>. Officials said Robinson had admitted to shooting Kirk to his roommate, saying in a text message, \"I had enough of his hatred.\"</p>   \n   <p>Erika Kirk, who is 36 and the mother of two young children, tearfully described the moment she saw her husband's body at the hospital in Utah, hours after he was shot in the neck while debating college students at Utah Valley University.</p>   <p>\"I saw the wound that ended his life … I felt shock, I felt horror and a level of heartache that I didn't even know existed,\" Kirk said. \"But even in death, I could see the man that I loved. I saw the single gray hair on the side of his head, which I never told him about. I also saw in his lips the faintest smile. It revealed to me a great mercy from God in this tragedy. When I saw that, it told me Charlie didn't suffer.\"</p>   <p>Speaking to tens of thousands of people at the stadium, Kirk said she had found comfort in prayer and also in the way people had responded to her husband's death.</p>   <p>\"We didn't see violence, we didn't see riots. We didn't see revolution. Instead we saw what my husband always prayed he would see in this country: We saw revival. We saw people open a Bible for the first time in a decade,\" she said, urging people to continue doing so.</p>   \n   <p>\"Pray again, read the Bible again, go to church next Sunday, and the Sunday after that and break free from the temptations and shackles of this world,\" Kirk said.</p>   \n   <p>Her remarks came in striking contrast to both <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2025/09/21/nx-s1-5545613/charlie-kirk-funeral\" target=\"_blank\">the vice president and president</a>, who bookended her speech. Vice President Vance said that \"evil still walks among us\" and that society \"shouldn't ignore it for a fake kumbaya moment.\" President Trump said: \"I hate my opponents and I don't want the best for them.\"</p>   <h3>Emphasis on the family</h3>   <p>Kirk had another message for the crowd, saying that the \"greatest cause in Charlie's life was trying to revive the American family.\"</p>   <p>\"When he spoke to young people, he was always eager to tell them about God's vision for marriage and how if they could just dare to live it out, it would enrich every part of their life in the same way that it enriched ours,\" she said.</p>   <p>She told the men in the audience to follow her husband's example in a Christian marriage where they are the spiritual heads of the family, who love and lead their wives and protect their children.</p>   <p>\"Please be a leader worth following,\" Kirk said. \"Your wife is not your servant. Your wife is not your employee. Your wife is not your slave. She is your helper. You are not rivals. You are one flesh, working together for the glory of God.\"</p>   <p>Kirk compared her husband to a martyr who died doing the will of God. She said, while her husband had died far too early, \"he was ready to die, he left this world without regrets\" because he had done \"100% of what he wanted to do every day.\"</p>   <p>\"He died with incomplete work but not with unfinished business,\" Kirk said.</p>   <p>Last week, Kirk was named the new <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2025/09/19/nx-s1-5546856/erika-kirk-ceo-turning-point-usa-charlie-kirk-death\" target=\"_blank\">CEO of Turning Point USA</a>, the right-wing youth organization that her late husband founded.</p>\n</div>"

Kennedy Jr. Shortly after taking office, he pledged to swiftly identify the cause \"by September,\" and has cited the use of everything from synthetic food dyes, childhood vaccines, and painkiller use as potential culprits.</p>   <p>But while autism diagnoses have tripled in the past two decades, the use of acetaminophen has not — remaining largely steady over that time.</p>   \n   <p>In addition, scientists agree that genetics play a central role in a child's risk of developing autism. The disorder runs in families, and if one identical twin is on the spectrum, most of the time the other will be too.</p>   <p>A few small<a href=\"https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamapsychiatry/fullarticle/2753512\" target=\"_blank\"> studies</a> have suggested an association between fetal exposure to acetaminophen and the subsequent risk of diagnosis with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). But the<a href=\"https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2817406\" target=\"_blank\"> largest study to date</a>, an NIH-funded collaboration between U.S. and Swedish scientists, found no increased risk.</p>   \n   <p>Even before that study was published in 2024, a U.S. District Court had reached a similar<a href=\"https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.nysd.587481/gov.uscourts.nysd.587481.1381.0.pdf\" target=\"_blank\"> conclusion</a> in a product liability case.</p>   <p>Meanwhile, groups like the Society for Maternal-Fetal Medicine have stood by recommendations to use acetaminophen to treat fever and pain in pregnant women. The group argues that untreated fever, for example, can cause grave harms such as miscarriage, birth defects or premature birth, especially early in a pregnancy.</p>   <p>The administration is also expected to say in its report that leucovorin or folinic acid — a form of vitamin B that is sometimes used to treat deficiencies caused by chemotherapy — could prevent or treat the disorder. The use of leucovorin is based on<a href=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1071909120300462\" target=\"_blank\"> research</a> suggesting that many people with autism have a metabolic difference that could reduce the amount of folate that reaches the brain. Leucovorin appears to offer a way around that metabolic roadblock.</p>   \n   <p>And although leucovorin affects a system that is important for brain and nervous system development and is sometimes prescribed off-label as a treatment for autism, the evidence that it works is scant.</p>   <p>The Autism Science Foundation said in a statement last week that there are four studies suggesting low folate levels in pregnant women could increase the risk of autism, but it said \"this science is still in very early stages, and more studies are necessary before a definitive conclusion can be reached.\"</p>\n</div>"

I forgive him because it's what Christ did. And it's what Charlie would do.\"</p>   \n   <p>Kirk went on to say that \"the answer to hate is not hate. The answer — we know from the Gospel — is love.\" </p>   <p>For most of the memorial, Kirk's friends, allies and supporters spoke about the growth of his conservative operation from an idea in 2012 into one of the most influential organizations in modern politics, emphasizing his personal character and a vision rooted in their shared faith for carrying on his work.</p>   <p>While President Trump described Kirk as a \"missionary with a noble spirit,\" he said he disagreed with his views on those with different opinions.</p>   <p>\"He did not hate his opponents, he wanted the best for them,\" Trump said. \"That's where I disagreed with Charlie. I hate my opponent. I don't want the best for them.\"</p>   <p>In the days since Kirk was shot and killed on the campus of Utah Valley University, Kirk's <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2025/09/10/nx-s1-5537045/charlie-kirk-shot-utah\" target=\"_blank\">legacy as a youth organizer</a> and evangelizer of conservative politics and conservative Christianity has taken on a new life, with tens of thousands of new requests to create chapters of his Turning Point group on high school and college campuses, the organization says.</p>   <p>Erika Kirk is taking over as the leader of Turning Point, and prominent Republican figures like Vice President Vance and broadcaster Tucker Carlson have stepped in to host <em>The Charlie Kirk Show</em>, remembering their friend and vowing to advance his causes.</p>   \n   <h3>Some see Kirk's death as Democrats' fault</h3>   <p>Kirk's killing has also led to an escalation of rhetoric and action from the Trump administration and Republican lawmakers who have painted their ideological opponents as radical forces of evil who have harmed the country.</p>   <p>On Kirk's podcast last week, Vance said political violence is \"not a both-sides problem\" and blamed the \"incredibly destructive movement of left-wing extremism\" for the attack allegedly carried out by a lone shooter.</p>   <p>Deputy Chief of Staff Stephen Miller suggested that the federal government would \"identify, disrupt, dismantle and destroy\" left-wing networks that he blamed without evidence for fomenting violence, and Trump vowed to label the <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2025/09/19/nx-s1-5545764/trump-says-he-plans-to-designate-antifa-as-a-terrorist-organization\" target=\"_blank\">nebulous left-wing \"antifa\" ideological movement</a> a \"major terrorist organization.\"</p>   \n   <p>On Sunday night, President Trump hailed Kirk as a \"martyr,\" which others like onetime Trump adviser Steve Bannon have echoed. Pro-Trump influencer Chaya Raichik, who runs the \"Libs of TikTok\" social media account, wrote \"THIS IS WAR.\" And lawmakers like Wisconsin GOP Rep. Derrick Van Orden compared Kirk's killing as a catalyst similar to Sept. 11 and that he would \"not allow these leftist scumbags to take my country.\" </p>   <p>Prominent <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2025/09/13/nx-s1-5538476/charlie-kirk-jobs-target-social-media-critics-resign\" target=\"_blank\">online voices</a> on the right have called for people who have made social media posts criticizing Kirk or mocking his death to lose their jobs or face investigation, including the vice president telling people to \"call them out and, hell, call their employer.\"</p>   <p>The president and Federal Communications Chairman Brendan Carr are facing questions about freedom of speech protections after Carr threatened ABC over remarks made by late night host Jimmy Kimmel in a monologue last week about Kirk's killing. ABC took Kimmel's show off the air in a move some legal <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2025/09/18/nx-s1-5545720/kimmel-abc-carr-fcc-jawboning\" target=\"_blank\">experts say is illegal \"jawboning,\"</a> when government officials pressure private companies to suppress speech. </p>   \n   <p>Beyond specific feelings of spiritual resolve or political retribution, Republicans have begun to sour on America's future.</p>   <p>A <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/poll-republicans-direction-country-kirk-violence-economy-66e5a964a807a5a1412ef0596f37ec39\" target=\"_blank\">new poll</a> from The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research conducted Sept. 11-15 finds a sharp decline in Republican optimism in the direction of the country, especially among women and young conservatives.</p>   <p>Overall, only half of those in the GOP say the country is heading in the right direction, a seismic shift eight months into Trump's return to office, as concerns about political violence, immigration and the economy weigh over Republican-controlled Washington.</p>\n</div>"

The signers also include Selena Gomez and Olivia Rodrigo, who both had early success as Disney actors.</p>   \n   <p>Other signers include Tom Hanks, Jennifer Aniston, Robert DeNiro, Jason Bateman, Natalie Portman and Maya Rudolph.</p>   \n   <p>In part, the letter reads: \"Last week, Jimmy Kimmel was taken off the air after the government threatened a private company with retaliation, marking a dark moment for freedom of speech in our nation. In an attempt to silence its critics, our government has resorted to threatening the livelihoods of journalists, talk show hosts, artists, creatives, and entertainers across the board. This runs counter to the values our nation was built upon, and our Constitution guarantees … Regardless of our political affiliation, or whether we engage in politics or not, we all love our country. We also share the belief that our voices should never be silenced by those in power – because if it happens to one of us, it happens to all of us.\"</p>   <p>In his opening monologue last Monday, Kimmel had criticized the conservative response to the assassination of conservative activist and close Trump ally Charlie Kirk. \"We hit some new lows over the weekend with the MAGA gang desperately trying to characterize this kid who murdered Charlie Kirk as anything other than one of them and doing everything they can to score political points from it,\" Kimmel said.</p>   \n   <p>Last Wednesday, Brendan Carr, the chairman of the Federal Communications Commission (FCC), <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2025/09/19/nx-s1-5546764/fcc-brendan-carr-kimmel-trump-free-speech\" target=\"_blank\">told</a> conservative podcaster Benny Johnson: \"We can do this the easy way or the hard way. These companies can find ways to change conduct to take action on Kimmel or, you know, there's going to be additional work for the FCC ahead.\"</p>   <p>Within <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2025/09/18/nx-s1-5545671/kimmel-suspension-charlie-kirk-death-free-speech-censorship\" target=\"_blank\">hours</a>, ABC announced it would suspend Kimmel's show indefinitely. On the Fox News program <em>Saturday in America</em>, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt <a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/media/karoline-leavitt-says-obama-has-no-idea-what-hes-talking-about-after-kimmel-comments.amp\" target=\"_blank\">said</a>, \"The decision to fire Jimmy Kimmel and to cancel his show came from executives at ABC.\" Kimmel has not been fired, nor has his show been canceled.</p>   \n   <p>The executive director of the ACLU, Anthony D. Romero, told NPR in a written statement on Monday: \"We now find ourselves in a modern McCarthy era, facing exactly the type of heavy-handed government censorship our Constitution rightfully forbids. The silencing of Jimmy Kimmel and jawboning of media outlets through lawsuits and threats to their licenses evoke dark memories of the 1950s. We must remember, however, that Senator McCarthy was ultimately disgraced and neutralized once Americans mobilized and stood up to him. We must do the same today because, together, our voices are louder and, together, we will fight to be heard.\"</p>   \n   <p>Other entertainers have taken separate actions to make their feelings known – including some who also have ties to Disney properties.</p>   <p>On Monday morning, hosts of the popular ABC morning show <em>The View</em> also <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxcGIHLUcRM\" target=\"_blank\">criticized</a> the Trump administration and their own corporate bosses. Host Whoopi Goldberg said that her show had waited several days to see if Kimmel would make any sort of public statement. \"The government cannot — cannot — apply pressure to force someone to be silenced,\" she said. Her co-host Alyssa Farah Griffin added, \"The First Amendment is the first for a reason, because you need to be able to hold those in power accountable.\"</p>   <p>On Sunday evening, musician Sarah McLachlan, one of the founders of the Lilith Fair music festival, and fellow artist Jewel declined to perform at the premiere of the Hulu documentary <em>Lilith Fair: Building a Mystery</em>. (Hulu is also owned by Disney.)</p>   <p>In comments made from the stage before the documentary's screening in Los Angeles, McLachlan — who appears in the film — announced the decision to cancel the live performances. She <a href=\"https://x.com/chrissgardner/status/1969995307355431388\" target=\"_blank\">said</a>: \"I've grappled with being here tonight and around what to say about the present situation that we are all faced with, the stark contraction to the many advances we've made watching the insidious erosion of women's rights, of trans and queer rights, the muzzling of free speech. I think we're all fearful for what comes next, and none of us know.\"</p>   \n   <p>Another, <a href=\"https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/tv/tv-news/jimmy-kimmel-suspension-reactions-marvel-disney-stars-1236376120/\" target=\"_blank\">currently circulating</a> open letter signed by some <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1-vhY9XHKjmqUJ50imhEn4UPXTTYgxY9XlZ83hhA2k_o/edit?tab=t.0\" target=\"_blank\">600 comedians</a> including Jimmy Fallon, Chelsea Handler, Margaret Cho, David Cross and W. Kamau Bell reads in part: \"Every culture needs humor. It's how we heal and how we connect with each other. Take it away, and what's left is fear, silence, and a bleak existence. When the government targets one of us, they target all of us. They strike at the heart of our shared humanity. They strip away the basic right every person deserves: to speak freely, question boldly, and laugh loudly… We will not be silenced.\"</p>   \n   <p>Some prominent conservative lawmakers and commentators have also weighed in on the issue of free speech.</p>   <p>Last week, former Fox News host Tucker Carlson, during an episode of his podcast dedicated to Kirk's murder and its aftermath, addressed Attorney General Pam Bondi and her declaration that the Department of Justice would \"target\" those who used \"<a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2025/09/19/nx-s1-5544346/where-does-free-speech-go-from-here\" target=\"_blank\">hate speech</a>.\" Carlson <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5iCxIu7Syw\" target=\"_blank\">said</a>: \"Consider what it means if you don't respect free speech, which is another way of saying free conscience. The right of other people to make up their own minds about the basic questions of what is right and wrong, and to express their views on those issues. If you don't acknowledge the right of other people to do that, and if you take steps to prevent them from doing that, what are you really saying? You're saying, 'I don't think you have a soul. I think you're a meat puppet I can control.'\"</p>   <p>On Friday, Republican Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas criticized Carr and the FCC on his own podcast, calling the situation \"dangerous as hell.\"</p>   <p>\"I gotta say, that's right out of <em>GoodFellas</em>,\" Cruz <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l6KYixCBTJc&list=PL5V1QY3MemiGElRzUH3Zea8yGBkMwYMHb&index=3\" target=\"_blank\">said</a>. \"That's right out of a mafioso coming into a bar going, 'Nice bar you got here. It'd be a shame if something happened to it.'\"</p>\n</div>"

Bunch III a <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2025/08/12/nx-s1-5500550/smithsonian-trump-review\" target=\"_blank\">letter</a> requiring a \"comprehensive internal review\" of eight Smithsonian museums including American History, American Art Museum, Natural History and Air & Space.</p>   <p>Now, historians and citizens concerned about the Trump administration's approach to, and involvement in, the Smithsonian have come together to document how the museums look today. Their goal is to produce a record before any changes that might be made.</p>   \n   <p>Two historians in particular put out the call for help. One, Georgetown University professor Jim Millward, said the Trump administration's pressure on the Smithsonian has him alarmed. \"I'm a historian of China, and so I'm really used to when governments are stepping in trying to whitewash history and censor history like that,\" he said. \"And it really upset me to see this being threatened in the United States as well.\"</p>   <p>Millward's colleague, historian Chandra Manning, was equally concerned, so the two of them got together to hatch a plan. \"As citizens, we wanted to find a way to step forward and steward this national treasure for now and for the future,\" said Manning.</p>   <p>Manning said they took inspiration from \"<a href=\"https://sites.google.com/umn.edu/save-our-signs/home\" target=\"_blank\">Save Our Signs</a>,\" which was created in response to the Trump administration's <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2025/09/17/nx-s1-5540117/government-moves-to-national-scrub-park-sites-of-negative-history\" target=\"_blank\">call</a> for visitors to report signs in National Parks that are \"negative about either past or living Americans.\" Hundreds of visitors photographed signs to help create an archive of what the signs said before any changes were made.</p>   <p>\"<a href=\"https://www.citizenhistorians.org/\" target=\"_blank\">Citizen Historians</a>\" aims to do the same for the Smithsonian, said Millward.</p>   <p>\"So<strong> </strong>we came up with this idea to call for volunteers to go out and, in a systematic way, go exhibit by exhibit, room by room, hall by hall, museum by museum, and take pictures simply of what's up there now and what's being said now,\" he said.</p>   \n   <h3>A vast \"repository of human wisdom\"</h3>   <p>This is a massive undertaking. There are millions of artifacts, objects, specimens and artworks on view at the Smithsonian's 21 museums.</p>   \n   <p>\"The range is really quite breathtaking,\" said Manning, \"from Jackie Robinson's jersey to prehistoric skeletons to Ming vases. It really is a repository of human wisdom right here in Washington, D.C.\"</p>   <p>The historians sent their request for volunteers to friends, neighbors and colleagues. The only requirement was a smartphone and a desire \"to join us to help save our history,\" according to the letter, which was shared with NPR.</p>   <p>Millward said hundreds of people responded.</p>   <p>\"The volunteers run the gamut. Young and old people from all over D.C., Maryland and Virginia,\" he said. \"Some had worked at the Smithsonian before, maybe as docents or even as employees, but many had not. They'd simply visited the Smithsonian themselves over the years and had a real feeling of how important it was.\"</p>   <h3>\"Citizen historians\" with smartphones</h3>   <p>Volunteer Shelley Smith, a retired public health professional, was assigned the gallery \"Forces for Change: Mary McLeod Bethune and Black Women's Activism\" at National Museum of African American History and Culture</p>   \n   <p>In 1904, Bethune started a school for Black girls in Daytona Beach, Fla. She went on to become a prominent civil rights activist and the first African American to have a state-commissioned statue in the U.S. Capitol, of which a replica is in the gallery. Among the other influential Black women honored are Mamie Till-Mobley, Shirley Chisholm, Lena Horne, Oprah Winfrey and poet Amanda Gorman.</p>   <p>Smith photographed everything: a small diary Bethune kept when she visited Europe in 1927, the historic images, the wall text.</p>   <p>\"You see history in a different light,\" she said, \"They tell the story from a lot of different angles. And so it was just so important to document what the people that initiated this museum and project wanted to be out there and wanted to be said.\"</p>   \n   <p>Millward said he believes museums should change with the times based on scholarly research and historic oversights, not with political pressure.</p>   <p>\"We don't want a museum that doesn't deal with sensitive issues. We want one that's honest and can talk about the whole range of our history and culture,\" he said.</p>   <p>According to Millward, volunteers have so far uploaded more than 25,000 photographs and videos from Smithsonian museums to a temporary storage site. He and his colleagues are looking for a permanent home for the images.
