    "body": "<div>\n      <p>The government is just days away from shutting down if Congress can't reach a deal. President Trump upped the stakes, threatening large-scale layoffs if Democrats don't provide the necessary votes.</p>   \n</div><div>\n    <p>STEVE INSKEEP, HOST: </p><p> We are four days away from a government shutdown.</p><p>A MARTÍNEZ, HOST: </p><p> And a memo from the White House promises to punish federal workers if that happens. The Trump administration is threatening large-scale layoffs if Democrats don't provide the necessary votes to avoid a shutdown. We don't know exactly which jobs would be targeted or how many federal workers could lose their jobs, but the deadline to come up with a solution is fast approaching.</p><p>INSKEEP: And NPR congressional correspondent Barbara Sprunt will be covering whatever happens. Barbara, good morning.</p><p>BARBARA SPRUNT, BYLINE: Hey. Good morning, Steve.</p><p>INSKEEP: OK. So this is kind of a departure from the normal shutdown scenario where the government says, we're going to increase the pain. What prompted this?</p><p>SPRUNT: Well, there's a line in the memo that I think is telling here, essentially saying, we're hopeful that Democrats in Congress don't trigger a shutdown, and then this won't be necessary. So I think this is partly aimed at making any funding lapse as difficult as possible for Democrats.</p><p>INSKEEP: Got it.</p><p>SPRUNT: Normally in a shutdown, you know, agencies furlough federal workers temporarily until a deal is brokered and a stopgap funding bill is passed. This is next-level. It's instructing agencies to look for workers to fire permanently, people whose work is not consistent with the president's priorities.</p><p>INSKEEP: How are Democrats responding?</p><p>SPRUNT: Well, they view it as an intimidation tactic to get them to accept the continuing resolution that House Republicans passed that would fund the government through November 21. I spoke with Maryland Senator Chris Van Hollen, a Democrat, about this yesterday. Here's what he had to say.</p><p>CHRIS VAN HOLLEN: This is nothing less than Mafia-style blackmail. Essentially, the president is threatening to fire dedicated federal employees who have nothing to do with the ongoing political and policy dispute.</p><p>SPRUNT: Meanwhile, Senate minority leader Chuck Schumer says that if these firings do go forward, he suspects they'll eventually be overturned in court.</p><p>INSKEEP: Although we've learned when the president fires someone, even if a court finds illegality, it's difficult to reverse the firing, so we'll see. Is anybody talking about getting a deal out of this?</p><p>SPRUNT: Well, top congressional Democrats were supposed to meet with President Trump yesterday at the White House, but the president canceled that meeting, saying it would be pointless to meet because Democrats, in his view, are making unreasonable demands.</p><p>INSKEEP: Which are what?</p><p>SPRUNT: Well, Democrats want to roll back some Medicaid changes that were part of the big tax and spending bill that the president signed earlier this summer, and they want to extend tax credits from the Affordable Care Act that are set to expire at the end of the year. House Democratic leader Hakeem Jeffries has said a verbal agreement that comes in any sort of negotiation isn't enough. Democrats want to address these issues in written legislation. Here he is yesterday.</p><p>(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)</p><p>HAKEEM JEFFRIES: We're able to sit down any time, any place with anyone, not hard to find. I'm here in the Capitol, willing to go to the White House at any time in order to have that conversation.</p><p>SPRUNT: But, you know, Steve, yes, this is about the shutdown. It's a very real possibility, and it would have very real consequences for people who rely on certain services and workers who might find themselves without a job permanently. But this is also about an ongoing conflict between the White House and Democrats in Congress who feel the administration has continued to overreach in its authority and diminish the legislative branch's power of the purse. So yes, this memo is unprecedented, but it also very much follows the administration's philosophy that we've seen play out again and again this year.</p><p>INSKEEP: Well, Barbara, I hope you're ready for a busy few days here.</p><p>SPRUNT: Looking forward to it. Thanks, Steve.</p><p>INSKEEP: NPR congressional correspondent Barbara Sprunt.</p>\n    <p>Copyright © 2025 NPR.  All rights reserved.

    "body": "<div>\n      <p>Maryland Gov. Wes Moore has committed to being a bipartisan bridgebuilder. But he's also under pressure to redistrict the state's one GOP congressman out of his House seat.</p>   \n</div><div>\n    <p>ARI SHAPIRO, HOST: </p><p> Democratic Governor Wes Moore of Maryland campaigned on the slogan, leave no one behind. It references both his time in the military and his openness to working with both parties. Now, Moore is facing pressure to set aside bipartisanship. President Trump wants Republican states to break with tradition and redraw their voting lines before the midterm elections, and Democrats are pressing Moore to make a partisan countermove in deep blue Maryland. WAMU's Jenny Abamu talked with him about it.</p><p>JENNY ABAMU, BYLINE: When asked whether Governor Moore considers himself a progressive or moderate, he bucks at the idea of being labeled. Here he is in our one-on-one interview last week.</p><p>(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)</p><p>WES MOORE: What is the Democratic platform? What is the Republican platform? I don't know. I can tell you my beliefs. I can tell you what we're trying to do in Maryland.</p><p>ABAMU: Moore frequently reminds the public that he's not a career politician, having lived several lives, including as a soldier, investment banker, author and CEO of a philanthropic organization before winning the governorship in 2022. And he's worked with Republicans. Here's Ed Rothstein, a Republican who served as county commissioner in conservative Carroll County, Maryland. He serves in Moore's Cabinet as the secretary of the Department of Veterans and Military Families.</p><p>ED ROTHSTEIN: We speak the same language when it comes to loyalty, responsibility, respect, honor, personal courage. You know, these are not just words, but they're ways of life.</p><p>ABAMU: Now, Moore's promises of bipartisanship are being tested. As President Trump has criticized Baltimore and threatened to send the National Guard, Moore has pushed back. He denied Trump's claim that Moore praised him in private, tweeting, LOL, you keep telling yourself that.</p><p>Then there's a big question of redistricting. Trump's urging Republican states to redistrict to help the GOP hold Congress. States usually just redistrict early in each decade after the census. And while Moore didn't commit to doing it, he told me states can't get hung up on, quote, \"principle\" if Trump's rewriting the rules.</p><p>MOORE: I believe deeply that all options need to be on the table in the state of Maryland because if we are going to have specific states - Trump-picked states - saying we should have a process to decide, do we have fair maps, then you know what? So should Maryland.</p><p>ABAMU: Already, only one of Maryland's eight House seats is held by a Republican, so drawing new maps could leave Maryland with no Republicans in Congress even though they make up about 24% of the voters. Brigitta Mullican, the Montgomery County GOP treasurer and a Republican organizer, says the state already gerrymanders to silence Republican voices.</p><p>BRIGITTA MULLICAN: I'm not happy about it, but you know what? I personally can't change any of that. But very disappointing.</p><p>ABAMU: In 2022, the court struck down the Democratic legislature's map for extreme partisan gerrymandering, making it draw a new one then. Mullican wants all politicians to play fair.</p><p>MULLICAN: And, you know, they play games on both sides. And my thing is do the right thing. You know, I want our districts to be properly redistricted right, you know?</p><p>ABAMU: Many progressive voters, though, like to see their governor taking on the president. Here's activist Dee Clarkin (ph) from Montgomery County.</p><p>DEE CLARKIN: I mean, Trump is a bully, and Governor Moore seems to instinctively understand that, and he is pushing back appropriately. And I have been pleased with that so far.</p><p>ABAMU: Clarkin says she sees redistricting in Maryland as a necessary evil. And Democrats around the county are looking toward the midterms as a way to stop Trump's agenda, which would make it hard for Wes Moore's leave no one behind motto to survive.</p><p>For NPR News, I'm Jenny Abamu.</p><p>(SOUNDBITE OF COMMON & JOHN LEGEND SONG, \"THEY SAY\")</p>\n    <p>Copyright © 2025 NPR.

Some wore suits, others high heels, and nearly all carried small binders with resumes, certificates and diplomas.</p>   <p>They were veterans, current law enforcement officials, college graduates and fired federal workers.</p>   <p>They came from California, Texas, Georgia, Arkansas and Utah.</p>   <p>And they want to be deportation officers, or work for other parts of the Department of Homeland Security, the agency leading President Trump's mass deportation policy.</p>   <p>The Trump administration wants to recruit 10,000 people for Immigration and Customs Enforcement, a branch of DHS, using congressional funds approved this summer. The administration's goal is to deport 1 million people a year. But that target is unlikely to be easy to hit: The lack of personnel to conduct arrests, investigate and litigate cases has been among the biggest challenges to increasing the pace of arrests, detentions and deportations.</p>   \n   <p>NPR spoke with more than 30 people at the DHS career expo held in Provo last week. This was the first agencywide career fair after Congress approved funds to recruit candidates for positions beyond immigration enforcement, including for the Secret Service, Federal Protective Police and the Transportation Security Administration, which like ICE are all part of DHS. Interviews conducted by NPR suggest many of the people who had traveled across state lines to Utah wanted to work in immigration enforcement.</p>   <p>More than 1,500 people registered for the event, DHS Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin told NPR in a statement. DHS extended 500 tentative job offers, with 370 for ICE Enforcement and Removal Operations.</p>   <p>\"Many of the candidates who attended the expo had started the application process before attending and were completing things on their to-do list, such as drug tests, finger printing, and more,\" McLaughlin said. \"Attending the in-person career expo helped candidates expedite their hiring process with a one-stop shop to complete their applications.\"</p>   <p>ICE had <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2025/02/05/nx-s1-5259788/homeland-security-immigration-trump-workforce\" target=\"_blank\">about 20,000 people</a> at the start of the year, 6,000 of them in roles directly conducting deportations. Last week, <a href=\"https://www.dhs.gov/news/2025/09/16/ice-receives-more-150000-applications-join-ice-law-enforcement-help-remove-worst\" target=\"_blank\">ICE boasted receiving </a>more than 150,000 applications nationwide and extending 18,000 tentative job offers, though it is unclear how many will ultimately see a first day on the job.</p>   \n   <p>DHS officials have raised concerns over what they said is a 1,000% increase in threats to their officers. Officials reiterated that statistic after a <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2025/09/24/nx-s1-5552151/ice-dallas-detention-facility-shooting\" target=\"_blank\">fatal shooting at the Dallas ICE field</a> office this week killed one person and injured two others — all immigrants detained there — and bullets were found with the words \"ANTI-ICE.\"</p>   <p>Acting Director Todd Lyons <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2025/09/24/us/video/ice-director-dallas-shooting-cnc-digvid\" target=\"_blank\">told CNN after the shooting</a> that the threats have not negatively affected recruitment efforts.</p>   <p>\"There's really excitement for people that want to serve, not just necessarily ICE but want to serve in a federal law enforcement capacity, especially at a time when assaults and attacks on law enforcement are increasing,\" Lyons said. \"We are seeing a great uptick in our recruitment, so people definitely want to do the job.\"</p>   <h3>The recruits</h3>   <p>As part of its recruitment campaign, DHS offered signing bonuses, <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2025/08/07/nx-s1-5494724/ice-is-recruiting-federal-workers-offering-bonuses-to-hire-thousands-of-workers\" target=\"_blank\">lifted age restrictions</a> and roped in celebrities like <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2025/08/07/nx-s1-5495436/superman-tv-actor-dean-cain-joins-ice-recruit-immigration\" target=\"_blank\">actor Dean Cain, who played Clark Kent/Superman in <em>Lois and Clark</em></a>, to encourage more people to apply.</p>   <p>Ana Maria Vargas, 52, a correctional officer in Arizona, applied to be a deportation officer.</p>   \n   <p>\"I saw … the guy that played Superman on the TV series so many years ago,\" Vargas said. \"A lot of us still have the desire and want to serve our country, yet we don't know how to get into it because of the age restrictions.\"</p>   <p>Vargas said she wants to \"take out the bad guys,\" though she acknowledged \"there are a lot of good people that are here. However, they are here illegally.\"</p>   <p>Andrea Alexander, an attorney living in Utah, came to apply for the Office of the Principal Legal Advisor, the branch of ICE that argues immigration cases in immigration court. She learned of ICE's recruitment efforts from White House Deputy Chief of Staff Stephen Miller's social media.</p>   <p>\"I love Trump. I love his administration. I think he's going to save our country,\" Alexander said, adding that those applying to be deportation officers should likely believe in the mission as well. \"They probably have to be true believers for the front line because they have to be ready to catch a lot of flak right now.\"</p>   \n   <p>Still, Alexander said she wanted to see efforts to increase legal migration and visa reform.</p>   <p>\"We've made it almost impossible for people to immigrate legally. It's very difficult and they should be able to come over,\" she added.</p>   <p>Another applicant, Peter, who did not want to disclose his last name since he is applying to be a deportation officer, flew to Utah from Arkansas.</p>   <p>He said he was on the right of the political spectrum and that the hiring bonuses and increased media attention on the agency drew his attention.</p>   <p>\"I think there's way too many illegal immigrants here,\" he said, noting that if he gets the job, he hopes he gets to deport people. </p>   <h3>Former federal employees seek a second chance</h3>   <p>Sherrell Pyatt was one of several DHS employees laid off as part of a broader effort to reduce the size of the federal government. <a href=\"http://google.com/search?q=Sherrell+Pyatt+npr&rlz=1C1GCFQ_enUS1132US1132&oq=Sherrell+Pyatt+npr&gs_lcrp=EgZjaHJvbWUyBggAEEUYOTIKCAEQABiiBBiJBTIKCAIQABiiBBiJBTIHCAMQABjvBTIKCAQQABiABBiiBNIBCDIyMDVqMGo5qAIFsAIB8QUxiCo-BAwJwA&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8\" target=\"_blank\">NPR reported her story in April</a>. But months later, she flew from Georgia to Utah with the hopes of being rehired at the agency that let her go.</p>   <p><strong>\"</strong>I want to be judged on my qualifications, my credentials, and I don't feel like I've been given that opportunity,\" Pyatt said, noting that her severance had ended in August.</p>   <p>She wanted to apply for a role with the fraud investigations unit of U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services. After working in the federal government for 10 years, Pyatt said that she wants to continue her service and believes she should have priority to be rehired, since she was a part of a reduction in force, but is competing with external candidates.</p>   <div>\n            <div>\n        <picture>\n            <source srcset=\"https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/7659x5106+0+0/resize/400/quality/85/format/webp/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fcc%2F46%2F53f325de4fc593cd94600fa8b559%2Fgettyimages-2235696135.jpg 400w, https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/7659x5106+0+0/resize/600/quality/85/format/webp/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fcc%2F46%2F53f325de4fc593cd94600fa8b559%2Fgettyimages-2235696135.jpg 600w, https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/7659x5106+0+0/resize/800/quality/85/format/webp/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fcc%2F46%2F53f325de4fc593cd94600fa8b559%2Fgettyimages-2235696135.jpg 800w, https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/7659x5106+0+0/resize/900/quality/85/format/webp/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fcc%2F46%2F53f325de4fc593cd94600fa8b559%2Fgettyimages-2235696135.jpg 900w, https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/7659x5106+0+0/resize/1200/quality/85/format/webp/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fcc%2F46%2F53f325de4fc593cd94600fa8b559%2Fgettyimages-2235696135.jpg 1200w, https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/7659x5106+0+0/resize/1600/quality/85/format/webp/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fcc%2F46%2F53f325de4fc593cd94600fa8b559%2Fgettyimages-2235696135.jpg 1600w, https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/7659x5106+0+0/resize/1800/quality/85/format/webp/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fcc%2F46%2F53f325de4fc593cd94600fa8b559%2Fgettyimages-2235696135.jpg 1800w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1025px) 650px, calc(100vw -

So I firsthand see the benefits of it,\" he said.</p>   <h3>Concerns over DHS' widespread recruitment comes from all sides</h3>   <p>The numbers at the recruitment events notwithstanding, ICE's recruitment strategies have not all been well received.</p>   <p>Utah County Sheriff Mike Smith, who has an agreement to assist ICE in the Provo area, called an initial call to recruit local law enforcement \"unprofessional\" in an interview with NPR. The recruitment fair in Provo, as well as an <a href=\"https://www.texasstandard.org/stories/immigration-customs-enforcement-recruitment-event-ice-arlington-texas/\" target=\"_blank\">ICE-specific fair in Texas</a>, were met with scattered protests.</p>   <p>RJ Hauman, a visiting fellow at the conservative Heritage Foundation, said he supports the administration's immigration enforcement goals, but said he is skeptical about the recruitment campaign.</p>   \n   <p>\"When you're recruiting large numbers of qualified candidates, you got to consider how you get them to the finish line,\" Hauman said. \"Rather than doing ads that ICE is hiring, all these on-site job fairs, let's start hammering out more facilities to train these potential agents and streamline the vetting, the background check, make sure you get the right people and you don't make a mistake.\"</p>   <p>Critics say the modification of requirements, including a reduced training period, could result in hiring candidates with less experience. <a href=\"https://www.dhs.gov/news/2025/08/06/secretary-noem-unveils-no-age-limit-patriotic-americans-join-ice-law-enforcement\" target=\"_blank\">The agency</a> insists standards aren't being lowered: ICE law enforcement recruits will still be required to go through medical screening, drug screening and a physical fitness test. </p>   <h3>Just another job</h3>   <p>ICE's enforcement efforts have made the agency the focus of negative attention, protests and lawsuits. But like for many who work in the federal government, the politics of the moments are irrelevant.</p>   \n   <p>John Heubert, who expects to retire from the Army next summer, came from Georgia to apply to be a deportation officer.</p>   <p>\"I feel like I could do good in that realm. I've been military for 23 years. I've worked in detainee operations for a long time,\" Heubert said. \"So I feel like leveraging my skills, and deployments, and everything would help kind of transition me easier into the civilian life, doing kind of the same thing I've been doing.\"</p>   <p>He said everything has been politicized, so the controversy surrounding the agency did not deter him.</p>   <p>\"I'm the guy that just executes at this point. So whatever they want, they tell me to do it, I go do,\" Heubert said.</p>   <p>Alan Richardson, who came to the expo from Utah, is another veteran. He learned of the expo from a friend's post on LinkedIn.</p>   <p>\"I want to go back into federal service … and retire earlier than have to start a whole another career with a state or county agency,\" he said, noting he is interested in Border Patrol, Secret Service and ICE.</p>   <p>\"As a law enforcement officer, you don't get to pick and choose which laws to enforce. You enforce them as they are on the books,\" Heubert said. \"There is no politics behind it. If you want to change laws, you have to go to Congress.

    "body": "<div>\n      <p>House Democratic Caucus Chair Pete Aguilar, D-Calif., talks about the Trump administration's threat to terminate federal workers if the government shuts down Oct. 1.</p>   \n</div><div>\n    <p>A MARTÍNEZ, HOST: </p><p> For more on how far Democrats are willing to take the shutdown fight, we've got Congressman Pete Aguilar of California on the line. He's chair of the House Democratic Caucus. [inaudible] Congressman. So do you think the Trump administration is bluffing?</p><p>PETE AGUILAR: Well, I think what the Trump administration is trying to do is to use federal workers as political pawns. We saw what they did and how ineffective DOGE was, firing people only to hire them back. It's unfair to use these workers to get caught up in the political fight, and it just shows the length to which Donald Trump and his Republican henchmen will carry out their priorities and that they always want to put themselves over the American public.</p><p>MARTÍNEZ: But they did fire people once. So do you think that they would not do it again this time around?</p><p>AGUILAR: I think they'll do whatever they can to scare people, to impose harm on our communities. These are federal workers who are, around the country, providing essential services to people, providing services to the public. These firings have nothing to do with government funding, and we're going to continue to push back against attempts to undermine the federal civil workforce, just as we always have. Nothing prevents Donald Trump from carrying out firings, as he has done over the last nine months. And nothing prevents him from doing that. Today, he's going to continue to do that if it meets his agenda and harms the American public.</p><p>MARTÍNEZ: Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer has said that any firings are likely to be overturned in court and ultimately reversed by the administration. If - Congressman, if indeed that is the case, does that strengthen the Democratic Party's position to not give in to Republican demands?</p><p>AGUILAR: Well, we're not concerned about strengthening in position or, I mean, it - this isn't about gamesmanship. This is about, you know, that type of decision. If the president moves forward to fire people, that hurts the American public. That hurts people. And even, you know, winning in court six months from now doesn't do much to help that family, you know, in the short term. And so, you know, we hope it doesn't get to that point. But just as we've seen, the Republican chaos machine and the Donald Trump chaos machine, you know, firing folks over the last nine months, we can't stop that. And the Supreme Court has had Donald Trump's back in these firings over the last few months, and so there isn't anything that anybody can do to stop that. What we can do is to speak clearly and honestly about the importance of protecting health care in this country and the importance of meeting that need for the American public.</p><p>MARTÍNEZ: But isn't it easier, then - and so to speak - to toe the line to just stand firm if you don't believe that No. 1, these firings are going to happen, and No. 2, that these firings wouldn't be reversed? Wouldn't it be easier if you truly believe that, that you can kind of keep your position the way it is?</p><p>AGUILAR: We're keeping our position the way it is because it's the best thing for the American public. Republicans have manufactured a health care crisis in this country with their big, ugly law that they passed in July that has only added to the affordability crisis that Americans were facing because of Donald Trump's tariffs. So we're going to continue to hold that line because it's the right thing to do, and it's what - it's in the best interest of the health and safety of the American people.</p><p>MARTÍNEZ: As far as you know, Congressman, are your Republican colleagues completely and 100% united in their support for the administration carrying out mass firings?</p><p>AGUILAR: Well, specific to mass firings, you know what, we just don't know, A, because Speaker Johnson has canceled the legislative session that is coming up. We have not been around our Republican colleagues. There have not been negotiations among the leaders. We've made it clear for months that we're willing to work with anyone who wants to come to the table to talk about government funding, and Republicans have not met with us, and Donald Trump canceled a meeting with legislative leaders. That's not something that you would do if you wanted to solve a crisis.</p><p>MARTÍNEZ: Yeah. Mike Lawler of New York said he doesn't support mass firings, but he says, quote, \"there's a simple way to avoid it - pass the continuing resolution.\" I mean, is it that simple? A simple way to avoid it?</p><p>AGUILAR: Well, I don't think so. I mean, there's - what we need to do, it's a - it's simple, as my colleague from New York said. It's legislative leaders coming together and having conversations to avoid that action. But that's only done if - in a bipartisan way, if we solve this government funding crisis. But Republicans refuse to meet with Democrats even if they need our votes. So what we are saying is very clearly, if you need our votes to fund the government, then you need to meet with us. And that's going to mean we have to address important health care issues for the American public. Until then, Republicans must have a plan to fund government if they aren't meeting with Democrats.</p><p>MARTÍNEZ: Congressman Pete Aguilar of California is chair of the House Democratic Caucus. Congressman, thank you.</p><p>AGUILAR: Thank you.</p>\n    <p>Copyright © 2025 NPR.  All rights reserved.

In the case of TikTok, the administration is seeking a fee for service. With Intel, the federal government is acquiring an equity stake. For chipmakers Nvidia and AMD, meanwhile, the demand was for a slice of future profits. And with the network television settlements, the payouts arose after personal legal disputes.</p>   \n   <p>\"There is no consistent principle at play, just the exercise of Trump's personal power over other people's money,\" said Dael Norwood, associate professor of history at the University of Delaware, who notes that the winners and losers are clear.</p>   <p>\"All Americans — taxpayers, investors, customers, and workers — lose with crony capitalism,\" he said. \"It increases everyone's costs, makes everyone more vulnerable to extortion (or worse), and profoundly degrades our expectations for honesty and fair dealing, society-wide.\"</p>   <p>In public, corporate executives show support to the president and appear to back such deals, but behind closed doors, <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2025/08/14/nx-s1-5501591/trump-corporate-america-capitalism\" target=\"_blank\">some business leaders are expressing deep concern</a>.</p>   \n   <p>Yale School of Management professor Jeffrey Sonnenfeld recently helped organize a gathering of more than 100 top CEOs, and he said there was near-unanimous consensus in surveys conducted at the event that Trump's interventions in private business are undermining America's free market principles.</p>   <p>\"These are shakedown schemes. It's a gross violation of what capitalism is supposed to stand for. I'd even call it extortion,\" Sonnenfeld said. \"Privately, CEOs are horrified.\"</p>   <p>But Sonnenfeld said executives are not banding together to push back on Trump, as top business leaders <a href=\"https://insights.som.yale.edu/insights/ceos-urge-respect-for-election-integrity\" target=\"_blank\">did</a> following Trump's election denialism in November 2020.</p>   <p>\"CEOs need to speak up, like they did then, but they aren't doing it publicly,\" Sonnenfeld said. \"Fear of retaliation is motivating the silence, but there has got to be a trigger line to stop this. We just don't know what that is yet.\"</p>   <p>Talks with American investors for a potential acquisition of TikTok's U.S. enterprise have been moving in fits and starts for the past five years, starting back when the Trump administration <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2020/09/26/917134452/new-doj-filing-tiktoks-owner-is-a-mouthpiece-of-chinese-communist-party\" target=\"_blank\">declared</a> the Chinese-owned hit video app to be a national security threat and sought to have it banned.</p>   <p>Since Trump's about-face and embrace of TikTok, it has been clear that software and cloud-computing company Oracle would be a major player in the bid to take over the app's American presence.</p>   \n   <p>Oracle co-founder Larry Ellison is a close confidante of Trump and the president has said both publicly and in private that he'd like to see TikTok controlled by Oracle.</p>   <p>According to the source with direct knowledge of the talks, many of the deal's provisions have been under discussion for months, including that Oracle will host and oversee all of Americans' TikTok data. Beijing-based ByteDance <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2025/04/02/nx-s1-5349592/tiktok-oracle-trump-china-deal\" target=\"_blank\">will license</a> its algorithm to the U.S. entity to be retrained based only on the 170 million U.S. users of the app and ByteDance will keep a minority stake in the company.</p>   <p>The one part of the agreement that caught investors by surprise? The multibillion-dollar fee request.</p>   <p>\"They were taken aback when they were told they'd have to kick in,\" the source said. \"But I think they see it as just the price of doing business right now.\"</p>\n</div>"

And education researchers warn that two of those three proposals — from the White House and House Republicans — would impose steep cuts on some of the United States' most vulnerable students and disadvantaged school communities.</p>   <h3>The three proposals on the table</h3>   <p>First up, <a href=\"https://www.ed.gov/media/document/fy-2026-presidents-budget-request-110152.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">President Trump's proposed budget</a> would cut U.S. Department of Education funding by 15%. It would eliminate all funding ($1.3 billion) for English language learners and migrant students. It would also combine 18 funding streams — including help for rural schools, civics education, at-risk youth and students experiencing homelessness — and cut them from roughly $6.5 billion down to $2 billion.</p>   \n   <p>The White House has <a href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Fiscal-Year-2026-Discretionary-Budget-Request.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">defended this consolidation</a>, saying it \"requires fewer Federal staff and empowers States and districts to make spending decisions based on their needs.\"</p>   <p>The <a href=\"https://appropriations.house.gov/sites/evo-subsites/republicans-appropriations.house.gov/files/evo-media-document/fy26-labor-health-and-human-services-education-and-related-agencies-subcommittee-mark.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">second proposal, from House Republicans</a>, would push for even deeper K-12 cuts, notably a $4.7 billion reduction in funding that supports schools in low-income communities. This funding stream, known as Title I, has enjoyed bipartisan support for decades and currently sends roughly <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2025/03/21/nx-s1-5330917/trump-schools-education-department-cuts-low-income\" target=\"_blank\">$18 billion to schools</a> in disadvantaged communities all over the United States.</p>   <p>In a <a href=\"https://appropriations.house.gov/news/press-releases/committee-approves-fy26-labor-health-and-human-services-education-and-related\" target=\"_blank\">news release</a> heralding the legislation, the chairman of the House Appropriations Committee, Republican Tom Cole of Oklahoma, said, \"Change doesn't come from keeping the status quo—it comes from making bold, disciplined choices.\"</p>   <p>And the<strong> </strong><a href=\"https://www.appropriations.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/fy26_lhhs_bill_text.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">third proposal, from the Senate</a>, would make minor cuts but largely maintain funding.</p>   <p>A quick reminder: Federal funding makes up a relatively small share of school budgets, roughly 11%, though cuts in low-income districts can still be painful and disruptive.</p>   <h3>Schools in blue congressional districts could lose more money</h3>   <p>Researchers at the liberal-leaning think tank New America <a href=\"https://www.newamerica.org/education-policy/edcentral/congressional-districts-losing-the-most-k12-funding-under-trump-and-house-budgets/\" target=\"_blank\">wanted to know</a> how the impact of these proposals might vary depending on the politics of the congressional district receiving the money. They found that the Trump budget would subtract an average of about $35 million from each district's K-12 schools, with those led by Democrats losing slightly more than those led by Republicans.</p>   \n   <p>The House proposal would make deeper, more partisan cuts, with districts represented by Democrats losing an average of about $46 million and Republican-led districts losing about $36 million.</p>   <p>Republican leadership of the House Appropriations Committee, which is responsible for this budget proposal, did not respond to an NPR request for comment on this partisan divide.</p>   <p>\"In several cases, we've had to make some very hard choices,\" Rep. Robert Aderholt, R-Ala., a top Republican on the appropriations committee, said during the full-committee markup of the bill. \"Americans must make priorities as they sit around their kitchen tables about the resources they have within their family. And we should be doing the same thing.\"</p>   \n   <p>The Senate proposal is more moderate and would leave the status quo largely intact.</p>   <p>In addition to the work of New America, the liberal-leaning Learning Policy Institute created <a href=\"https://learningpolicyinstitute.org/blog/5-billion-federal-k-12-formula-funding-hangs-balance-between-white-house-and-senate-proposals\" target=\"_blank\">this tool</a> to compare the potential impact of the Senate bill with the president's proposal.</p>   <h3>High-poverty schools could lose more than low-poverty schools</h3>   <p>The Trump and House proposals would disproportionately hurt high-poverty school districts, according to an <a href=\"https://edtrust.org/rti/fy26-federal-funding-at-risk-for-americas-schools/\" target=\"_blank\">analysis by the liberal-leaning EdTrust</a>.</p>   \n   <p>In Kentucky, for example, EdTrust estimates that the president's budget could cost the state's highest-poverty school districts $359 per student, nearly three times what it would cost its wealthiest districts.</p>   <p>The cuts are even steeper in<strong> </strong>the House proposal: Kentucky's highest-poverty schools could lose $372 per student, while its lowest-poverty schools could lose $143 per child.</p>   <p>The Senate bill would cut far less: $37 per child in the state's highest-poverty school districts versus $12 per student in its lowest-poverty districts.</p>   <p>New America researchers arrived at similar conclusions when studying congressional districts.</p>   <p>\"The lowest-income congressional districts would lose one and a half times as much funding as the richest congressional districts under the Trump budget,\" says New America's Zahava Stadler.</p>   <p>The House proposal, Stadler says, would go further, imposing a cut the Trump budget does not on Title I.</p>   <p>\"The House budget does something new and scary,\" Stadler says, \"which is it openly targets funding for students in poverty. This is not something that we see <em>ever</em>.\"</p>   <p>Republican leaders of the House Appropriations Committee did not respond to NPR requests for comment on their proposal's outsize impact on low-income communities.</p>   <p>The Senate has proposed a modest increase to Title I for next year.</p>   <h3>Majority-minority schools could lose more than mostly white schools</h3>   <p>Just as the president's budget would hit high-poverty schools hard, New America found that it would also have an outsize impact on congressional districts where schools serve predominantly children of color. These districts would lose nearly twice as much funding as predominantly white districts, in what Stadler calls \"a huge, huge disparity<em>.\"</em></p>   \n   <p>One of several drivers of that disparity is the White House's decision to end all funding for English language learners and <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2018/08/29/640862283/in-one-generation-a-farmworker-family-grows-college-ambitions\" target=\"_blank\">migrant students</a>. In <a href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Fiscal-Year-2026-Discretionary-Budget-Request.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">one budget document</a>, the White House justified cutting the former by arguing the program \"deemphasizes English primacy. ... The historically low reading scores for all students mean States and communities need to unite—not divide—classrooms.\"</p>   <p>Under the House proposal, according to New America, congressional districts that serve predominantly white students would lose roughly $27 million on average, while districts with schools that serve mostly children of color would lose more than twice as much: nearly $58 million.</p>   \n   <p>EdTrust's data tool tells a similar story, state by state. For example, under the president's budget, Pennsylvania school districts that serve the most students of color would lose $413 per student. Districts that serve the fewest students of color would lose just $101 per child.</p>   <p>The findings were similar for the House proposal: a $499-per-student cut in Pennsylvania districts that serve the most students of color versus a $128 cut per child in predominantly white districts.</p>   <p>\"That was most surprising to me,\" says EdTrust's Ivy Morgan. \"Overall, the House proposal really is worse [than the Trump budget] for high-poverty districts, districts with high percentages of students of color, city and rural districts. And we were not expecting to see that.\"</p>   <p>The Trump and House proposals do share one common denominator: the belief that the federal government should be spending less on the nation's schools.</p>   <p>When Trump <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSbBNm5Pms0\" target=\"_blank\">pledged</a>, \"We're going to be returning education very simply back to the states where it belongs,\" that apparently included scaling back some of the federal role in funding schools, too.</p>   <p>The challenge for states, communities and families, if one of these budgets becomes a reality, will be filling that funding void, especially since the federal government has always focused its dollars on helping students and schools that need it the most.</p>\n</div>"
