The president <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2025/06/26/nx-s1-5446114/trump-wealth-business-crypto-brand-golf-course\" target=\"_blank\">reported income</a> of more than $630 million last year, including $57 million from cryptocurrency sales, before launching a<a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2025/01/20/nx-s1-5268759/donald-trump-melania-cryptocurrency-meme-coins\" target=\"_blank\"> \"meme coin\"</a> earlier this year.

This is much more fun. You don't even have to get out of bed in the morning,\" says Ross Delston, a lawyer and former banking regulator at the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp.</p>   <p>\"You can invest in this [cryptocurrency], and now he's your friend,\" he adds. \"And that could be anybody — somebody who's sketchy, or who's been convicted of something, or acting on behalf of a [foreign] state actor. \"</p>   <p>Democratic Senator Elizabeth Warren was even more blunt. \"It's corruption, plain and simple,\" she <a href=\"https://x.com/SenWarren/status/1962998997251227752\" target=\"_blank\">wrote on X</a> on Tuesday, linking to a <em>Wall Street Journal</em> <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/finance/currencies/trump-family-amasses-6-billion-fortune-after-crypto-launch-567faec5\" target=\"_blank\">story </a>about the Trump family's $5 billion on-paper windfall.</p>   <p>The White House<a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2025/05/22/nx-s1-5407411/white-house-denies-conflicts-of-interest-as-trump-joins-dinner-for-meme-coin-investors\" target=\"_blank\"> has repeatedly</a> dismissed such criticisms over Trump's efforts to personally profit from the crypto industry.</p>   <p>\"Neither the President nor his family have ever engaged, or will ever engage, in conflicts of interest,\" White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt told NPR in an emailed statement this week.</p>   <h3><strong>From calling crypto a \"scam\" to appointing pro-crypto financial cops</strong></h3>   <p>World Liberty's public launch didn't exactly set the crypto world on fire. Its tokens were priced at about <a href=\"https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/world-liberty-financial-wlfi/\" target=\"_blank\">22 cents each</a> by Wednesday afternoon, down from their high of 32 cents shortly after their debut.</p>   \n   <p>And so far, the Trumps have limited ability to actually cash in their holdings: World Liberty Financial <a href=\"https://medium.com/@wlfi/understanding-the-wlfi-circulating-supply-at-launch-061f904e6923\" target=\"_blank\">says</a> that its \"team,\" including the Trumps, were barred from selling their own tokens when they started trading publicly.</p>   <p>But even without an immediate payday, the token's debut creates more pathways for the Trump family to profit from the crypto industry that helped <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2024/11/11/nx-s1-5184152/the-crypto-industry-won-big-this-election-it-has-several-implications\" target=\"_blank\">put him back in office</a>.</p>   <p>Just a few years ago, Trump<a href=\"https://www.foxbusiness.com/politics/crypto-potentially-a-disaster-waiting-to-happen-trump.amp\" target=\"_blank\"> called crypto a scam</a>. But now he's <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/transcripts/1254874796\" target=\"_blank\">embraced it</a>. Last year he courted deep-pocketed crypto investors, by<a href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/fact-sheets/2025/07/fact-sheet-president-donald-j-trump-signs-genius-act-into-law/\" target=\"_blank\"> vowing to make</a> the United States the crypto capital of the world. And once he won re-election, Trump started appointing <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2024/11/19/nx-s1-5189643/commerce-treasury-secretary-howard-lutnick-trump-cantor-fitzgerald\" target=\"_blank\">crypto-friendly</a> officials to his <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2024/12/06/g-s1-37097/up-first-newsletter-donald-trump-crypto-syrian-rebels-gift-ideas\" target=\"_blank\">administration </a>— including at the financial regulatory agencies that once heavily policed the crypto industry.</p>   <p>Under President Biden, the Securities and Exchange Commission in particular <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2024/11/21/g-s1-35233/sec-gary-gensler-resigns-crypto\" target=\"_blank\">cracked down heavily</a> on crypto companies, suing many for fraud and money laundering. That gave Trump an opportunity to court the vote of frustrated crypto investors, <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2024/09/30/nx-s1-5130919/crypto-companies-are-spending-big-on-the-election\" target=\"_blank\">who poured money</a> into the 2024 federal elections. Last year, Trump appointed Paul Atkins, <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2024/12/04/g-s1-36803/trump-crypto-paul-atkins-sec-chair\" target=\"_blank\">a crypto supporter</a>, to head the SEC.</p>   <p>At the same time, the crypto ventures that Trump and his family have started have put them in a position to profit from the more relaxed rules coming out of his administration.</p>   <p>Now there are few guardrails for how Trump is co-mingling his personal and presidential crypto interests. As Delston says: \"What exists now is virtually nothing.\"<br /></p>\n</div>"

President Trump falsely declared early that Wednesday that he had won reelection against Joe Biden and said he would ask the Supreme Court to intervene, even as several battleground states continued to count votes.\n                <b>\n                    Bloomberg/via Getty Images\n                </b>\n                <b><b>hide caption</b></b>\n            </p>\n            <p><b><b>toggle caption</b></b>\n    </p></div>\n    <p><span>\n        Bloomberg/via Getty Images\n    </span>\n</p></div>\n   </div>\n   <p>Both Fox and Smartmatic have each submitted lengthy court filings arguing why the judge should rule in its favor before trial. These filings include collections of what each asserts to be undisputed facts, including quotations from conversations, text messages and depositions from Fox News hosts and executives.</p>   <p>The <a href=\"https://iapps.courts.state.ny.us/fbem/DocumentDisplayServlet?documentId=olzwemuCPi6hRO6vLFAOVQ==&amp;system=prod\" target=\"_blank\">legal documents Smartmatic filed</a> indicate that network executives privately agreed that Trump had lost. But as the network rushed to stem the bleeding, Pirro became one of the most prominent Fox stars to embrace and amplify Trump's repeated claims that he had been cheated of victory, even as evidence publicly amassed that this was untrue.</p>   <h3>A complicated lawsuit </h3>   <p>Fox declined comment for this story.</p>   <p>Its executives have testified in sworn depositions that they had no concerns about what Pirro said on the air and considered her a source of reliable information. They assert Pirro took steps to investigate the claims and was careful to feature the denials she was aware of. The network's legal team notes that Pirro had couched things as allegations.</p>   <p>Fox argues that its journalists didn't know that the allegations were false. And therefore, its lawyers say, the network shouldn't be held liable for defamation, giving no credence to Smartmatic's arguments about the concerns of producers and executives.</p>   \n   <p>Fundamentally, Fox's legal team asserts the network was reporting on newsworthy claims by the president and his allies, a journalistic endeavor that it argues is protected by the First Amendment. The allegations were \"an issue that was pretty much splattered across newspapers across the country,\" Pirro said in a December 2023 deposition.</p>   <p>In filings for its defense, Fox says Smartmatic cannot prove its libel claims or that it was financially harmed.</p>   <p>The network also points to Smartmatic's own legal troubles: The Department of Justice (DOJ) recently <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2024/08/09/nx-s1-5069756/smartmatic-alleged-bribery-scheme-elections-philippines\" target=\"_blank\">charged Smartmatic executives with involvement in a bribery scheme</a> in the Philippines. Prosecutors also have raised questions about how Smartmatic spent money from its Los Angeles County contract.</p>   <p>Smartmatic told NPR that it operates ethically and in full compliance with the law wherever it does business, adding: \"The allegations in the DOJ's filing are full of misrepresentations.\"</p>   <h3>\"I don't trust her to be responsible tomorrow\"</h3>   <p>On Nov. 6, 2020, ahead of Pirro's regularly scheduled Saturday show the next day, Fox News' senior vice president for weekend programming, David Clark, texted Meade Cooper, the executive vice president over prime time, with a grim assessment. \"Bottom line, I don't trust her to be responsible tomorrow. Her guests are all going to say the election is being stolen and if she pushes back at all it will just be a token,\" he wrote.</p>   \n   <p>Cooper replied: \"Maybe she does not have a show tomorrow night.'</p>   <p>\"Honestly,\" Clark wrote back, \"that would be the wisest course of action.\"</p>   <p>The network canceled Pirro's show for that Saturday; at the time, it told NPR and other outlets that her program was simply preempted for standard election coverage.</p>   <p>Fox had done the same at least once before: In 2019, the <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/16/business/media/jeanine-pirro-fox-news-muslim.html\" target=\"_blank\">network took Pirro off the air</a> after she had attacked U.S. Rep. Ilhan Omar for wearing a hijab, suggesting the Minnesota Democrat, who is Muslim, was committed to sharia law.</p>   \n   <p>This time, however, Pirro privately complained to Fox star Sean Hannity of censorship. And conservative news outlets reported she had been silenced for supporting Trump, much to the dismay of executives, internal exchanges reproduced in court filings show.</p>   <p>Hannity, who had talked to Fox News CEO Suzanne Scott, is quoted in the court documents as texting Pirro that she'd be fine: \"You can come on and let it rip.\"</p>   <h3>A weakness for \"random conspiracy theories on weird internet sites\"</h3>   <p>Even after Trump administration officials responsible for the integrity of the election process said they had found no appreciable voting fraud, Pirro kept at it, executives said.</p>   <p>On Nov. 13, Fox Corp. Executive Chairman Lachlan Murdoch texted Scott, concerned about the backlash over the question of her show being pulled the previous week. \"Has anyone spoken to Judge Jeanine before her show this weekend?\" he asked, according to Smartmatic's filing. \"It would be good if she corrects the record and clears up the schedule change last week.\"</p>   <p>Scott told top executives to promote Pirro on the network's major shows and website, Smartmatic's legal filing says. \"I expect this to be handled well,\" she wrote. The network's top communications executive confirmed that the promotions for Pirro were airing and posted online too.</p>   <p>Even so, according to Smartmatic's filing, prime-time executive Cooper warned Scott: \"Pirro has a tendency to find random conspiracy theories on weird internet sites.\" The filing says she assigned a manager and a consultant to work with Pirro to keep her \"from saying untrue things... etc.\"</p>   <p>Pirro hosted her weekly show the next day and again the next week. Executives flagged her scripts, which were frequently contradicted by research from Fox's \"Brainroom,\" to one another, according to Smartmatic's filing.</p>   <p>\"It's rife w[ith] conspiracy theories and bs and is yet another example of why this woman should never be on live television,\" Fox News executive Jerry Andrews wrote to two other executives on Nov. 20, Smartmatic's filing says.</p>   \n   <p>The next day, Pirro opened her show by discussing two voting technology companies. The first was Dominion, which would <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2023/04/18/1170339114/fox-news-settles-blockbuster-defamation-lawsuit-with-dominion-voting-systems\" target=\"_blank\">settle a defamation case against Fox</a> in 2023 for $787.5 million. The second, Smartmatic, had only a single contract in 2020 where its technology was used: in heavily Democratic Los Angeles County, which no one doubted would go for Biden.</p>   \n   <p>\"The president's lawyers [are] alleging a company called Dominion, which they say started in Venezuela with Cuban money, and with the assistance of Smartmatic software, a back door is capable of flipping votes,\" <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/watch/?v=3424348634350374\" target=\"_blank\">Pirro told viewers</a>. (Dominion did not start in Venezuela, and no one has shown that it has a means of flipping votes.)</p>   <p>Immediately following the 2020 race, Trump and his allies, led by attorneys Sidney Powell and Rudy Giuliani, claimed that Dominion and Smartmatic had colluded with the Biden campaign to throw the election.</p>   <p>Dominion had already been blanketing the network with denials, and Fox News researchers had dismissed Giuliani as an unreliable source.</p>   <p>(Both lawyers have since faced serious consequences for their claims, including financial penalties and legal sanctions. Giuliani was subsequently disbarred in <a href=\"https://www.nycourts.gov/courts/ad1/calendar/List_Word/2024/07_Jul/02/PDF/Matter%20of%20Giuliani%20(2021-00506).pdf\" target=\"_blank\">New York state</a> and the <a href=\"https://www.dccourts.gov/sites/default/files/2024-09/In%20re%20Giuliani%20%2021-BG-0423.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">District of Columbia</a>.)</p>   <p>But Pirro said Giuliani \"made clear the Democrat cities were targeted by crooked Democrats who stole votes.\" These were cities comfortable with corruption, like Pittsburgh and Detroit, she said. And she said there was legal documentation:</p>   <p>\"The president's lawyers offered evidence by way of affidavits, which I told you last Saturday as a judge, from a legal perspective, are sworn statements of individuals signed under penalty of perjury,\" Pirro told viewers, \"meaning they know they face the penalty of prosecution and five years if they lie.\"</p>   <p>Testifying under oath in a later deposition, Pirro indicated that she had been referring to a declaration submitted in a lawsuit brought by a pro-Trump lawyer against Georgia's secretary of state.</p>   \n   <p>She acknowledged under questioning that it was not signed and that she did not know the identity of the person making the declaration, as his or her identity had been withheld from the public, according to Smartmatic's legal filing.</p>   <p>In the weeks after Election Day, Dominion sent a barrage of messages to Fox's executives and journalists flagging the false claims in the allegations being relayed — thousands of emails and warnings in all.</p>   <p>In dozens of court hearings and reviews by state and local election officials, none of the claims by the Trump teams was found to have merit.</p>   <p>Smartmatic's filing says that via text message, Fox executive Andrews told Pirro that if she brought up the issue again, she must include Dominion's denials. She replied by saying she would follow the lead of Fox stars Hannity, Tucker Carlson and Lou Dobbs. (Dobbs lost his job after Smartmatic filed its lawsuit.)</p>   <p>\"Reckless maniac,\" Andrews later wrote to a colleague, Smartmatic's filing says. He was referring to Pirro.</p>   <h3>An \"insane\" invocation of Kristallnacht </h3>   <p>Pirro would go on to be a leading voice on Fox urging a mass turnout on the National Mall on Jan. 6, 2021, the day that the U.S. Congress was to ceremonially certify Biden's election victory.</p>   <p>On Jan. 3, Pirro <a href=\"https://archive.org/details/FOXNEWSW_20210103_080000_Justice_With_Judge_Jeanine/start/438/end/540\" target=\"_blank\">compared</a> those gathering to protest in Washington with Trump to the American soldiers in the Revolutionary War, adding, \"Jan. 6 will tell us whether there are any in Congress willing to battle for the America that those soldiers fought for.\"</p>   <p>After protesters participated in a bloody siege of the Capitol, Pirro called for the most violent to be prosecuted.

    "body": "<div>\n      <p>From tariffs to the use of the National Guard in states and the Alien Enemies Act to deport Venezuelans — many of the Trump administration's policies are winding their way to the Supreme Court.</p>   \n</div><div>\n    <p>JUANA SUMMERS, HOST: </p><p> The justices of the U.S. Supreme Court aren't scheduled to meet with each other face-to-face until the end of this month, but already, there's a legal truckload of Trump administration appeals that the court will almost certainly have to decide this term, and each day seems to bring another blockbuster. NPR's legal affairs correspondent, Nina Totenberg is here in the studio with more. Hi.</p><p>NINA TOTENBERG, BYLINE: Hi there.</p><p>SUMMERS: So Nina, it's been nine months of the Trump administration, and it's an administration that has seen a number of legal challenges. What might we expect from the court this term?</p><p>TOTENBERG: You know, whatever I tell you this evening will be superseded or added to tomorrow or the next day. And that's because the Supreme Court, after dancing around most of the challenges to Trump executive orders, will soon face a bunch of cases that can't be avoided. They can't be - the can can't be kicked down the road. I say dancing around because the court, for the most part, until now, has blocked lower court decisions against Trump on a raft of issues. But these blocks, or stays, as they're called, are only temporary when the cases play out in the lower courts. But now, nearly a year into the second Trump administration, the lower courts - both district and appeals courts - have issued full-blown decisions in some of these cases - really big cases - and the court will have to deal with those lower court decisions on the merits, not on the question of a temporary stay.</p><p>SUMMERS: Got it. So tell us, Nina, what is the biggest case facing the Supreme Court at the moment?</p><p>TOTENBERG: Well, it depends a little bit on what floats your boat.</p><p>SUMMERS: (Laughter) OK.</p><p>TOTENBERG: (Laughter) In terms of the structure of modern government and the economy, it's probably two issues - tariffs and the Federal Reserve Board. First tariffs - this week, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit ruled by a 7 to 4 vote that the president exceeded his authority imposing tariffs worldwide with virtually no restraint. The circuit court stayed its ruling to allow Trump to appeal to the Supreme Court, and that means that we almost certainly will get a decision on Trump's tariff power this term.</p><p>SUMMERS: OK, so that was tariffs. What about the Federal Reserve Board?</p><p>TOTENBERG: Well, the court in recent months has all but formally overturned a nearly 100-year-old precedent that barred firing independent agency heads. But in one recent opinion, the court seemed to carve out an exception for the Federal Reserve Board members. Trump, who's made no secret of wanting to fire Jerome Powell, the head of the Fed, has now fired a different board member, Lisa Cook. She was appointed by President Biden, and her case is now kind of a test case. And that is making Trump allies in Congress and the business world very nervous because the Fed, since its creation in 1913, has been viewed as an apolitical, independent force for stability in the American economy, and all of this will undoubtedly come to a head in the coming months.</p><p>SUMMERS: Last thing, Nina, I understand that President Trump's use of the Alien Enemies Act is another major case that is likely to make its way to the court. Tell us about that one, if you can.</p><p>TOTENBERG: Yes, that's the law enacted in 1798 that allows the deportation of immigrants in times of foreign invasion. It's a law that until now has been used only three times, always in wartime - declared wartimes - including to round up Japanese Americans and put them in camps during World War II, an action that both Congress and the Supreme Court have since repudiated.</p><p>The Supreme Court earlier this year, rather than decide whether Trump's invocation of the Alien Enemies Act was legitimate, sent the case back to the very conservative 5th Circuit Court of Appeals to answer specific questions, among them, was Trump's action legal? And last night, a 5th Circuit panel found that Trump's use of the Alien Enemies Act to deport undocumented individuals was illegal. Writing for the panel majority, Judge Leslie Southwick, a Republican appointee, found that even a mass illegal immigration is not an armed and organized invasion of the kind contemplated by the Alien Enemies Act.</p><p>SUMMERS: Right.</p><p>TOTENBERG: There's also the deployment of the National Guard and Marines in California to handle protests against immigration enforcement activities. A federal judge ruled just a few days ago that the president didn't have the authority to do that...</p><p>SUMMERS: All right.</p><p>TOTENBERG: ...At least not without the consent of the state's governor, which he definitely didn't have.</p><p>SUMMERS: All right. We have to leave it there. We are out of time. NPR legal affairs correspondent Nina Totenberg, thank you.</p><p>TOTENBERG: Thank you.</p>\n    <p>Copyright © 2025 NPR.  All rights reserved.

David Ake/Getty Images\n    </span>\n</p></div>\n   </div>\n   <p>In April, the U.S. Department of Education used a landmark law intended, in part, to end racial discrimination <a href=\"https://www.ed.gov/about/news/press-release/us-department-of-educations-office-civil-rights-launches-title-vi-investigation-chicago-public-schools\" target=\"_blank\">to investigate</a> Chicago Public Schools over a \"Black Students Success Plan,\" after a complaint that the program discriminated against students of other races.</p>   <p>In July, the department ruled five Virginia school districts had violated another civil rights law, intended to protect women and girls from sex discrimination and harassment, by allowing transgender students to use school facilities based on gender identity, not biological sex.</p>   \n   <p>And just last week, the Trump administration <a href=\"https://www.ed.gov/about/news/press-release/us-department-of-educations-office-civil-rights-finds-denver-public-schools-violated-title-ix\" target=\"_blank\">announced a similar finding</a> against Denver Public Schools, warning the district to, among other things, \"adopt biology-based definitions for the words 'male' and 'female'\" within 10 days or risk losing federal funding.</p>   <p>The country's federal civil rights laws, written to protect marginalized groups from discrimination, have become an unlikely tool in the Trump administration's efforts to end targeted support for students of color and protections for transgender students.</p>   <p>Of this new campaign, the Trump administration insists it is enforcing decades-old civil rights laws as they were intended.</p>   <p>Julie Hartman, an Education Department spokeswoman, told NPR in a statement that the administration has a legal obligation \"to ensure that federal funds are not sponsoring discrimination against students.\"</p>   <p>Democrats decry the moves as a cynical misreading of federal law and the height of hypocrisy after President Trump pledged to respect states' rights to manage their own public schools.</p>   <p>The stakes for K-12 schools are high, as districts that choose to resist the Trump administration could lose funding that helps them support some of their most vulnerable students, including children with disabilities and those living in poverty.</p>   <h3>Battling interpretations of Title IX</h3>   <p>Title IX was intended to prevent sex discrimination and harassment in any educational setting that receives federal funding. The Obama and Biden administrations also used the law to <a href=\"https://www.justice.gov/opa/file/850986/dl?inline=\" target=\"_blank\">protect the rights</a> of transgender students to use bathrooms and locker rooms consistent with their gender identity.</p>   \n   <p>The Trump administration argues that interpretation violates the rights of women and girls. Instead, the Education Department's Office for Civil Rights (OCR), the department's enforcer of civil rights laws, is focused on \"Getting Men Out of Women's Sports\" – the title of an <a href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/02/keeping-men-out-of-womens-sports/\" target=\"_blank\">executive action</a> issued in February that says allowing athletes to compete on sports teams based on gender identity \"is demeaning, unfair, and dangerous to women and girls.\"</p>   <p>\"This interpretation [of the law] doesn't bear any relationship to the actual charge of Title IX,\" says Catherine Lhamon, who oversaw OCR during both the Obama and Biden administrations.</p>   \n   <p>But conservative legal scholars say it's Democrats who strayed from the law.</p>   <p>\"The Biden administration did a lot to more or less bastardize the civil rights laws and schools' compliance with them,\" says Leigh Ann O'Neill, senior legal strategy attorney at the conservative-leaning America First Policy Institute.</p>   <p>The truth of Title IX is that the law makes no mention of gender identity. And so, just as the Biden administration <em>interpreted</em> it to include protections for transgender students, the Trump administration is now interpreting the same law to do the opposite.</p>   <p>\"I thought that the Obama administration was wrong to mandate doing things on the basis of gender identity. I think the Trump administration is wrong to do the opposite,\" says R. Shep Melnick, a political science professor at Boston College and author of <em>The Transformation of Title IX</em>. \"I think it should be up to the states, localities and school districts.\"</p>   <p>Some states have codified protections for transgender students, including <a href=\"https://legacylis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?201+ful+SB868ER+pdf\" target=\"_blank\">the Virginia Values Act</a>, which prohibits discrimination based on a list of traits, including gender identity. But this is also locking many districts in a federal-state battle of wills with the Trump administration.</p>   <p><strong>\"</strong>What I find curious is that an administration that campaigned on eliminating [the Education Department] to return rights back to the states is now saying states don't have the right to decide whether or not they want to actually protect their most vulnerable students,\" says Sheria Smith, a former civil rights attorney in OCR's Dallas office and president of the AFGE Local 252, a union that represents many department employees.</p>   <p>Smith was terminated and the Dallas office closed as part of recent, dramatic cuts to OCR.</p>   <h3>How the Title IX fight is playing out in districts and states</h3>   <p>In a <a href=\"https://www.ed.gov/about/news/press-release/us-department-of-education-places-five-northern-virginia-school-districts-high-risk-status-and-reimbursement-payment-status-violating-title-ix\" target=\"_blank\">press release</a>, U.S. Education Secretary Linda McMahon said the five Virginia districts the department was investigating were following \"woke gender ideology in place of federal law\" and \"have stubbornly refused to provide a safe environment for young women in their schools.\"</p>   \n   <p>In a <a href=\"https://www.fcps.edu/news/update-regarding-fcps-gender-identity-policies-and-regulations\" target=\"_blank\">public letter</a>, Michelle Reid, the superintendent of Fairfax County Public Schools, one of those five districts, pushed back, assuring families \"our policies and regulations are consistent with controlling state and federal law,\" and she said a joint request from the districts entreating the department \"to engage in thoughtful discourse was denied.\"</p>   <p>The Education Department has also joined with the Justice Department to create a new <a href=\"https://www.ed.gov/about/news/press-release/us-department-of-education-and-us-department-of-justice-announce-title-ix-special-investigations-team\" target=\"_blank\">Title IX Special Investigations Team</a>. In an April release, McMahon warned schools, \"There's a new sheriff in town. We will not allow you to get away with denying women's civil rights any longer.\"</p>   \n   <p>Denver Public Schools superintendent Alex Marrero said the department is using its investigation into his district to pursue an \"anti-trans agenda through the weaponization of Title IX.\"</p>   <p>In a statement, Marrero said of this investigation: \"Make no mistake: there was no on-site review, not a single witness interview was ever conducted, and not one substantive conversation with any OCR attorney ever occurred. The District's requests for conversation, clarification, mediation, and discussion of remedies all went unanswered. This is unprecedented behavior from an OCR we no longer recognize.\"</p>   <p>The administration isn't just taking its Title IX fight to individual districts, either. In March, the department <a href=\"https://www.ed.gov/about/news/press-release/us-department-of-educations-office-civil-rights-concludes-maine-department-of-education-violating-title-ix\" target=\"_blank\">notified Maine's</a> state department of education that its policies supporting transgender students violated Title IX and, a month later, the Justice Department <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2025/04/16/nx-s1-5366648/trump-justice-department-maine-transgender-athletes-lawsuit\" target=\"_blank\">sued the state</a>.</p>   <p>\"It is very, very rare, outside of early school desegregation, to refer cases to the Department of Justice. The idea of referring entire states – if it's not literally unprecedented, it is extremely unusual,\" says Melnick.</p>   <p><a href=\"https://www.ed.gov/about/news/press-release/us-department-of-education-finds-california-department-of-education-and-california-interscholastic-federation-violation-of-title-ix\" target=\"_blank\">California</a> and other Democratic strongholds, including <a href=\"https://www.ed.gov/about/news/press-release/ocr-launches-investigations-illinois-doe-chicago-public-school-district-299-and-deerfield-public-schools-district-109-over-reported-title-ix\" target=\"_blank\">Illinois</a>, <a href=\"https://www.ed.gov/about/news/press-release/us-department-of-educations-office-civil-rights-opens-title-ix-investigation-oregon-department-of-education\" target=\"_blank\">Oregon</a> and <a href=\"https://www.ed.gov/about/news/press-release/title-ix-special-investigations-team-launches-directed-investigation-washington-state-superintendents-office-0\" target=\"_blank\">Washington</a>, are or have been under investigation and could potentially lose billions of dollars in federal funding.</p>   \n   <p>Julie Hartman, the Education Department spokeswoman, told NPR that the administration has given California and Maine \"every opportunity to voluntarily come into compliance with the law and repeatedly, they have rejected those opportunities to do so.\"</p>   <h3>Other Title IX cases are at a standstill</h3>   <p>Some legal advocates also worry that, with the administration so focused on rolling back rights for transgender students, it is pulling back on one of its signature responsibilities under Title IX.</p>   <p>Amanda Walsh, an attorney with the Victim Rights Law Center (VRLC), a group that provides legal services to sexual assault survivors in Massachusetts, says the VRLC has a handful of outstanding sexual assault and harassment complaints with the department and no idea where they stand after it closed seven of OCR's 12 regional offices, including in Boston, where Walsh and her colleagues had been working with OCR attorneys.</p>   \n   <p>\"When the office closed, we received no outreach from OCR about the status of those complaints, where those complaints would be transferred, who would be the right point person to contact if we had questions about those complaints,\" Walsh says. \"Still to this day, we have no information about our pending OCR complaints on behalf of our clients.\"</p>   <p>VRLC is <a href=\"https://clearinghouse.net/doc/159205/\" target=\"_blank\">now suing</a> the Education Department, arguing that the closure of OCR offices and the termination of more than half of its investigators has left OCR \"hobbled\" and \"incapable of addressing the vast majority of OCR complaints.\"</p>   <p>Walsh says, for now, she would hesitate to recommend that clients who have experienced sexual assault try to seek a remedy through the Education Department and OCR.</p>   <p>\"My sense is that OCR has truly come to a grinding halt, except for cases that I think push the administration's agenda forward.\"</p>   <p>In a statement, Julie Hartman said, \"The Trump Administration's OCR has taken unprecedented action to reverse the damage of the previous Administration and combat discrimination in our nation's schools and campuses. … OCR is vigorously upholding Americans' civil rights, and will continue to meet its statutory responsibilities while driving to improve efficiency.\"</p>   <h3>Title VI: A new interpretation of racial discrimination</h3>   <p><a href=\"https://uscode.house.gov/view.xhtml?req=(title:42%20section:2000d%20edition:prelim)%20OR%20(granuleid:USC-prelim-title42-section2000d)&amp;f=treesort&amp;num=0&amp;edition=prelim\" target=\"_blank\">Title VI</a> of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 prohibits any institution that receives federal funding – including K-12 schools, colleges and universities – from discriminating based on race, color or national origin. Moments before President Lyndon Johnson signed the law with Martin Luther King Jr. standing behind him, <a href=\"https://www.lbjlibrary.org/object/video/signing-civil-rights-act-1964\" target=\"_blank\">he told the country</a> that \"its purpose is not to punish. Its purpose is not to divide but to end divisions – divisions which have lasted all too long.\"</p>   <p>While Title VI has been used by Democratic and Republican administrations alike to safeguard the rights of Black Americans and other historically marginalized groups, the Trump administration is using it to go after both K-12 schools and colleges for preferencing minority students in access to programs and admissions.</p>   \n   <p>In February, the Education Department's acting assistant secretary for civil rights, Craig Trainor, <a href=\"https://www.ed.gov/media/document/dear-colleague-letter-sffa-v-harvard-109506.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">issued a letter</a> to schools opining that \"educational institutions have toxically indoctrinated students with the false premise that the United States is built upon 'systemic and structural racism' and advanced discriminatory policies and practices. Proponents of these discriminatory practices have attempted to further justify them—particularly during the last four years—under the banner of 'diversity, equity, and inclusion' ('DEI'), smuggling racial stereotypes and explicit race-consciousness into everyday training, programming, and discipline.\"</p>   <p>Trainor's implicit warning: The Trump administration would be using Title VI to crack down on what it considers discrimination against white and Asian American students.</p>   \n   <p>Trainor and OCR also told school districts they would <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2025/04/17/nx-s1-5361196/trump-dei-school-leaders-response\" target=\"_blank\">be required to sign a new form</a>, re-certifying their compliance with Title VI or risk losing their federal funding. Federal judges <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2025/04/26/nx-s1-5375904/trump-dei-schools-education-courts\" target=\"_blank\">later blocked the effort</a> saying the department hadn't followed proper procedure.</p>   <h3>Title VI cases against schools and colleges</h3>   <p>In May, OCR launched a Title VI investigation into one Illinois school district for, among other things, sponsoring \"affinity groups\" that were restricted by race and, according to a department <a href=\"https://www.ed.gov/about/news/press-release/us-department-of-educations-office-civil-rights-launches-title-vi-investigation-evanston-skokie-school-district-65\" target=\"_blank\">press release</a>, \"pressuring educators to 'acknowledge white skin privilege.'\"</p>   \n   <p>In June, the Trump administration <a href=\"https://www.ed.gov/about/news/press-release/us-department-of-education-refers-massapequa-mascot-case-us-department-of-justice\" target=\"_blank\">escalated a fight</a> with New York's education leaders, claiming the state's ban on school mascots and logos that use Native American imagery was silencing the voices of Native Americans and was itself discriminatory because schools would not be compelled to stop using other culturally-specific mascots or logos like Dutchmen or Huguenots.</p>   <p>\"What we see now is an Office for Civil Rights that is not neutral,\" says former OCR head Catherine Lhamon, \"that is not there for every student, and that is picking and choosing both which laws that it's interested in and which students' rights it's interested to protect.\"</p>   \n   <p>The Trump administration's biggest Title VI cases have so far come not against K-12 school districts but elite colleges and universities, including Columbia, Harvard and Brown, for allowing the spread of antisemitism on their campuses. These investigations are remarkable not only because of the schools' high profile but because the Trump administration cut or froze billions of dollars in federal funding without following a process clearly laid out in law.</p>   <p>Lhamon says, \"This administration hasn't investigated, has a suspicion something may be wrong, withholds millions, sometimes billions of dollars in federal funds, and then insists on a set of prescriptive, very detailed changes that are well afield of the topic that the administration claims to be investigating.\"</p>   <p>In the <a href=\"https://www.brown.edu/sites/default/files/brown-and-united-states-resolution-agreement_July-30-2025.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">agreement Brown University signed</a> with the Trump administration in response to its <a href=\"https://ocrcas.ed.gov/sites/default/files/ocr-letters-and-agreements/01242116-a.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">Title VI investigation into antisemitism</a>, Lhamon points out that the first changes Brown committed to weren't about antisemitism at all but gender, including a commitment to define \"male\" and \"female\" consistent with the Trump executive order titled \"Defending Women from Gender Ideology Extremism and restoring Biological Truth to the Federal Government.\"</p>   <p>\"Certainly many of these universities had a problem of not cracking down on some pretty serious harassment of Jewish students,\" says Melnick, who has spent decades studying civil rights enforcement. \"But then the administration has seized on that to say, 'OK, this is going to be the mechanism for doing all of these other things that we care about.'\"</p>   <p>Christopher Schorr, who runs the Higher Education Reform Initiative at the America First Policy Institute, takes no issue with this broad approach. \"Obviously, the campus antisemitism crisis in many ways was the doorway through which a lot of this is happening and through which the administration can now get a handle on the larger pattern of abuse of civil rights law.\"</p>   \n   <p>If the administration was serious about stopping antisemitism, says Sheria Smith, the former OCR attorney, it would not have closed seven of OCR's regional offices. \"I can't help but think that that's all lip service when the very office that was handling the majority of our antisemitism cases, the Philadelphia office, was closed with no plan on what happened to those complaints.\"</p>   <h3>Federal funding is on the line</h3>   <p>For institutions of higher education, the stakes are clear: The administration has no reservations about stopping vital federal funding before the legal process has played out.</p>   <p>For K-12 schools, the administration has only just begun to move toward funding cuts. In the case of those five Virginia districts that the Education Department says are violating Title IX, the department <a href=\"https://www.ed.gov/about/news/press-release/us-department-of-education-places-five-northern-virginia-school-districts-high-risk-status-and-reimbursement-payment-status-violating-title-ix\" target=\"_blank\">recently announced</a> it is taking next steps toward a full funding cut – a move so unusual the department hasn't done it in decades, <a href=\"https://www.edweek.org/policy-politics/will-trump-follow-through-on-his-threats-to-cut-school-funding/2025/02\" target=\"_blank\">according to Education Week</a>.</p>   <p>In her letter to families, Reid, the Fairfax County Public Schools superintendent, said up to $160 million in federal funding could be at risk.</p>   <p>Melnick points out, during the Obama and Biden administrations, \"conservatives were very angry at the Office for Civil Rights\" for using its leverage over schools to force them to embrace the administration's policy priorities.</p>   <p>Now, Melnick says, \"all the things they criticized, they're doing on steroids.\"</p>   <p>Though federal funding to K-12 schools makes up a small share of district budgets, <a href=\"https://nces.ed.gov/programs/coe/indicator/cma/public-school-revenue\" target=\"_blank\">around 11%</a>, that money plays an outsized role in helping their most vulnerable students, including children with disabilities and those living in poverty.</p>   <p>That financial reality means many districts, and potentially entire states, must now weigh the possibility that fighting the administration on one civil rights front – say, to support transgender students – could mean losing money to help other vulnerable children.<br /></p>\n</div>"

But Secretary Kennedy is facing questions about CDC leadership in disarray, and his moves to overhaul federal vaccine policy, amid growing calls for his resignation, including from more than a thousand <a href=\"http://savehhs.org/\" target=\"_blank\">current and former HHS staff</a> and numerous medical groups.</p>   <p>Here are three things to know going into the hearing.</p>   <h3>1. Kennedy's anti-vaccine activism is alive and well</h3>   <p>Kennedy built his reputation on anti-vaccine advocacy. That made some senators wary of confirming him, so he spent time leading up to his confirmation vote in February reassuring them:</p>   <p>\"If confirmed, I will do nothing as HHS secretary that makes it difficult or discourages people from taking vaccines,\" <a href=\"https://www.finance.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/responses_to_questions_for_the_record_to_robert_f_kennedy_jrpart2.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">he wrote repeatedly</a> in answer to written questions from members of the Senate Finance Committee.</p>   \n   <p>He also said that he would accept \"unprecedented\" input from Republican Sen. Bill Cassidy, a physician and vaccine supporter who chairs the Senate committee that oversees HHS and is a member of the finance committee.</p>   <p>Kennedy has broken many of the <a href=\"https://www.cassidy.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/cassidy-delivers-floor-speech-in-support-of-rfk-jr-to-be-hhs-secretary/\" target=\"_blank\">specific promises</a> he made to Cassidy. He moved to dramatically transform the federal government's approach to vaccines, from investment in biomedical research to the FDA approval process, to access. Already, some who want the new COVID-19 booster are <a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/delayed-vaccine-meeting-shifting-policies-make-difficult-people-get-co-rcna228055\" target=\"_blank\">finding they can't get it</a>.</p>   <p>Access to other vaccines could be limited next. Kennedy fired all the members of a key vaccine advisory panel in June and <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/sections/shots-health-news/2025/06/11/nx-s1-5430870/cdc-vaccine-experts-rfk-jr\" target=\"_blank\">replaced them</a> with his own roster of people who have a history of anti-vaccine activism. Later this month, they're set to consider recommendations for COVID-19 vaccines as well as more routine vaccines, including the respiratory virus RSV and measles.</p>   <p>Changes to those recommendations would have huge implications for public health, insurance coverage and availability across the country.</p>   <h3>2. He doesn't seem bothered by departures from the CDC</h3>   <p>Kennedy wrote an <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/opinion/robert-f-kennedy-jr-were-restoring-public-trust-in-the-cdc-6f26c176?gaa_at=eafs&amp;gaa_n=ASWzDAjqj4aZMecrBVMCXBibHzwGmXxe4yD5aWiQyMcHPqNpSIQjPdpTa_UDCpKbnAU%3D&amp;gaa_ts=68b87851&amp;gaa_sig=WufMl93o-lN9jNtVCjcb2Smy3SWrjf_mom7Xy-_XoIs1YCukEU5BSWdqYHB_p4LIOeSqwHPi14p81wk6BCrAzQ%3D%3D\" target=\"_blank\">op-ed in <em>The Wall Street Journal</em></a> defending his handling of the CDC over the weekend.</p>   <p>\"Over the decades, bureaucratic inertia, politicized science and mission creep have corroded [the CDC's] purpose and squandered public trust,\" he wrote. \"The path forward is clear: Restore the CDC's focus on infectious disease, invest in innovation, and rebuild trust through integrity and transparency.\"</p>   \n   <p>In an <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cCnf8mIg5A\" target=\"_blank\">interview on Fox News</a> last week, Kennedy said he wasn't surprised by the three top CDC scientists resigning. \"The agency is in trouble and we need to fix it and we are fixing it, and it may be that some people should not be working there anymore,\" he said.</p>   <p>It's not just high-profile leaders who have left HHS in recent days. Approximately <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/sections/shots-health-news/2025/04/05/g-s1-58312/hhs-layoffs-rif-cdc-fda-nih\" target=\"_blank\">20,000 HHS staff</a> — roughly one-quarter of the agency's workforce — have been fired or taken offers to leave voluntarily since Kennedy took over as secretary. The exodus was partly driven by the Elon Musk-led effort to shrink the federal workforce, but Kennedy <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ArVor4oGPhc\" target=\"_blank\">has also said</a> in April that cutting so many staff was necessary to streamline the agency and to capitalize on the \"political momentum.\"</p>   <p>HHS Communications Director Andrew Nixon echoed that idea in response to the letter from HHS staff calling for Kennedy to resign: </p>   <p>\"Secretary Kennedy has been clear: the CDC has been broken for a long time. Restoring it as the world's most trusted guardian of public health will take sustained reform and more personnel changes,\" Nixon wrote in a statement shared with NPR.</p>   <h3>3. Kennedy and his allies want to talk about healthy food</h3>   <p>As public health groups have grown increasingly alarmed by what's happening at HHS, Kennedy has been traveling around the country promoting state efforts to cut out certain dyes and limit ultra-processed products in the food supply.</p>   <p>Kennedy held <a href=\"https://www.hhs.gov/press-room/secretary-kennedy-maha-tour-austin-tx.html\" target=\"_blank\">a press conference</a> with Texas Gov. Greg Abbott last week as he signed several bills, including one that limits additives in school lunches and another that prevents people from using food benefits for sugary drinks and candy.</p>   <p>These efforts in Texas and similar bills in other states will help right the health of the American people, Kennedy said. \"We have more chronic disease than we can treat and we know what it is and we know it is the food we are eating,\" he said.<br /></p>\n</div>"

A Harvard-educated economist, Miran has been critical of the Federal Reserve's independence and advocated for more direct presidential control — views that have raised concerns about his nomination.</p>   <p>Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren, the committee's highest-ranking Democrat, has pledged to address those concerns directly during the hearing.</p>   <p>NPR's <em>Morning Edition</em> host Steve Inskeep spoke with Warren ahead of the hearing to discuss Trump's approach to the Fed and its current chairman, Jerome Powell.</p>   <p><em>This interview has been lightly edited for length and clarity.</em></p>      \n   <h3>Interview highlights</h3>   <p><strong>Steve Inskeep</strong>: Miran gives the impression that he does not necessarily believe in the full independence of the Federal Reserve.</p>   <p><strong>Sen. Elizabeth Warren:</strong> That's kind of a warning sign, right there. Today, there will be a hearing about his nomination, but that is not the right hearing for the banking committee to have. Over the last few months, Donald Trump has launched three huge attacks on the independence of the Fed: first, threatening to fire Jerome Powell; then, deciding that Powell had spent too much money on renovations of the Federal Reserve building and he could fire him for cause; and when that failed, now trying to fire Lisa Cook, another member of the Fed board — all of them [are] direct attacks on the independence of the Fed. </p>   <p>Right now, the banking committee should be investigating the president's direct attacks on that independence, not pretending that it's business as usual.</p>   \n   <p><strong>Inskeep:</strong> Given that the president has challenged the independence of the Fed and many other federal agencies in a way that nobody has seen for a long time, why does the independence of the Fed matter that much?</p>   <p><strong>Warren: </strong>If we have a totally politicized Fed, not a Fed that's making decisions about interest rates, for example, based on the best data they've got, but a Fed that says, 'What do you want us to do, Mr. President?' then what happens is everyone loses confidence in the Fed, in our central bank, and in the decisions they make. And that ultimately drives up the cost of mortgages and car loans and credit cards for Americans across this country. And this isn't a theoretical argument here. We've actually seen this happen before. Countries where authoritarians take control of the central bank suffer from higher inflation. And who does it hit hardest? It hits working people across that country.</p>   \n   <p><strong>Inskeep:</strong> Some people will know that you have been sharply critical of Jerome Powell, the Fed chairman, from time to time. How would you rate his performance now?</p>   <p><strong>Warren:</strong> I completely disagreed with Chair Powell since he was first nominated by Donald Trump, that's how far back he goes. I have disagreed with him on regulatory policy. I think he's way too easy on the banks. And I have disagreed with him on interest rate policy. I thought he should have lowered interest rates two years ago, and I have said so quite vocally and done my best to persuade him. But I have never, ever questioned the independence of the Fed and the Fed's ultimate power to make those decisions based on their best judgment of what's good for the United States of America.</p>   <p><strong>Inskeep: </strong>So you, like the President, are hoping for an interest rate cut this month, it sounds like, but you're saying your methods are different?</p>   <p><strong>Warren:</strong> Yes. But what I don't want to see is that Donald Trump has squeezed out the independence of the Fed, and that he's managed to get his own lackeys in there, that he's managed to fire someone at the Fed. Because as soon as that happens, the value that the United States has built up, literally for more than a century, by having an independent Fed, we lose the gold standard. And ultimately that costs the American economy. And it also, most importantly, costs American workers.</p>   <p><strong>Inskeep: </strong>Do you believe that your Republican colleagues are concerned?</p>   <p><strong>Warren:</strong> I think some of them are, because they understand the value of this independent Fed. And that's true whether we've got a Democrat in the White House or a Republican in the White House that we need independence, really, across the board, for our financial regulators. Because as soon as the politicians can grab them by the throat and say, for political reasons, 'Here's the economic decision I want you to make,' people start to understand that the whole game is being played on a political playing field, not an economic playing field. That doesn't make for a stronger economy, that doesn't build our GDP, and it sure doesn't make life better for American workers.</p>   \n   <p><em>The broadcast version of this interview was produced by Ana Perez and edited by HJ Mai.</em></p>\n</div>"

She was one of eight survivors who spoke Wednesday, sharing painful memories of abuse they suffered, and the emotional scars it left them with.</p>   <p>Another woman, Marina Lacerda, said she was speaking publicly for the first time.

We're here not as partisans, we're here as patriots,\" Khanna said, standing alongside the survivors. \"We begin the work of bringing this country together: progressives, independents, moderates, and, yes, MAGA supporters to demand truth and justice.\"</p>   <p>The survivors spoke as lawmakers in Congress are confronting how much information from the government's investigation into Epstein should be made public. The House Oversight Committee has already <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2025/08/05/nx-s1-5493371/house-oversight-committee-epstein-subpoenas-justice-department\" target=\"_blank\">subpoenaed the Justice Department</a> for records related to the investigation, and on Tuesday released an initial tranche of more than 30,000 documents.</p>   \n   <p>But the panel's work has drawn criticism from Democrats — as well as some Republicans, including Massie — who've expressed concern that any information shared by the committee wouldn't be extensive enough.</p>   <p>\"They're allowing the DOJ to curate all of the information that the DOJ is giving them. If you've looked at the pages they've released so far, they're heavily redacted. Some pages are entirely redacted, and 97% of this is already in the public domain,\" Massie argued, while urging additional Republicans to support his effort.</p>   \n   <p>To get their plan passed, Massie and Khanna have turned to a rarely used legislative maneuver known as a discharge petition. The tool allows any member to force a vote, but they first have to gather 218 signatures from the House.</p>   \n   <p>Three Republicans have already signed onto the petition: Reps. Marjorie Taylor Green, Lauren Boebert and Nancy Mace. If every House Democrat joins in, Massie and Khanna would need just two more Republican signatures.</p>   <p>In remarks, Greene, long known as a staunch Trump ally and conservative firebrand, expressed frustration over how the issue has divided factions of the GOP in recent months.</p>   <p>\"It's grieved me to watch the arguments and debates take place among my colleagues and even the administration,\" she said. \"I think this is something that is worth fighting for.\"</p>   <p>The Epstein issue has caused a rare split between President Trump and many of his most loyal supporters. On the campaign trail, Trump called for the release of more files, but the administration has faced blowback in recent weeks, stemming from <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2025/07/07/g-s1-76367/doj-jeffrey-epstein-memo\" target=\"_blank\">a DOJ memo</a> issued in July saying there was no evidence Epstein had possessed an alleged \"client list.\"</p>   \n   <p>Democrats have sought to spotlight Trump's past friendship with Epstein — though Trump has repeatedly said <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2025/07/29/nx-s1-5484136/trump-jeffrey-epstein-mar-a-lago-ghislaine-maxwell\" target=\"_blank\">their relationship ended</a> before Epstein was indicted for soliciting prostitution in 2006.</p>   <p>That relationship was highlighted during the press conference by Epstein survivor, Chauntae Davies, who said that Epstein surrounded himself \"with the most powerful leaders of our country and the world.\"</p>   <p>\"The truth is, Epstein had a free pass. He bragged about his powerful friends, including our current president, Donald Trump. It was his biggest brag, actually,\" she said.</p>   \n   <p>Speaking to reporters from the Oval Office on Wednesday, Trump sought to sidestep a question about the survivors, describing the Epstein issue as a \"Democrat hoax that never ends.\"</p>   <p>Throughout the press conference, multiple survivors also called on the president to take action. Asked about his remark earlier that morning, Epstein survivor, Haley Robsen, urged the president to \"humanize\" the survivors and their stories.</p>   <p>\"Mr. President, Donald J. Trump, I am a registered Republican – not that that matters because this is not political – however, I cordially invite you to the Capitol to meet me in person so you can understand this is not a hoax,\" she said. \"We are real human beings. This is real trauma.\"</p>\n</div>"
