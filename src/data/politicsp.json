This month, an international UN commission concluded Israel has committed genocide in Gaza, an accusation Israeli officials reject.</p>   <p>Some Democratic leaders have also distanced themselves from Mamdani <a href=\"https://www.zohranfornyc.com/platform\" target=\"_blank\">because of his progressive stance on economic policies</a>, including a call for a rent freeze, free childcare, and higher taxes for the wealthy and corporations.</p>   <p>\"Socialism does not work and his proposed plans would make New York a less competitive city and state,' <a href=\"https://x.com/Tom_Suozzi/status/1967543930846650392\" target=\"_blank\">said Rep. Tom Suozzi</a>, a moderate Democratic congressman from Long Island who announced he won't back Mamdani.</p>   <p>New York's Democratic Governor Kathy Hochul <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/09/14/opinion/hochul-endorsement-mamdani.html\" target=\"_blank\">endorsed Mamdani in an editorial in the New York Times</a> earlier this month, describing him as \"a leader who is focused on making New York City affordable — a goal I enthusiastically support.\"</p>   <p>Mamdani has also won strong backing from progressive leaders, including Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, a Democrat who represents parts of the Bronx and Queens, and Sen. Bernie Sanders, an independent from Vermont.</p>   \n   <p>But two of the country's most powerful Democrats, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer and House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, both from New York, have so far declined to back Mamdani's bid to lead the nation's largest city.</p>   <p>The chair of New York's state Democratic Party, <a href=\"https://x.com/npfandos/status/1968730967943581877\" target=\"_blank\">Jay Jacobs, also released a statement</a> earlier this month saying he would refuse to back Mamdani because of their sharply differing views on Israel and other policy issues. </p>   <p>\"I reject the platform of the so-called 'Democratic Socialists of America' and do not believe that it represents the principles, values or policies of the Democratic Party,\" Jacobs wrote.</p>   <p>Polls show Mamdani holds a commanding lead in the mayor's race against a packed field that includes current Mayor Eric Adams, former Democratic Governor Andrew Cuomo and Republican Curtis Sliwa.  </p>   <p><a href=\"https://sri.siena.edu/2025/09/09/new-york-times-siena-poll-new-york-city-mayoral-race/?_gl=1*1l734sv*_ga*MTU5MzUxNTA5Mi4xNzU4NjMyNDgx*_ga_XN3VDZ9ZYZ*czE3NTg2MzI0ODAkbzEkZzAkdDE3NTg2MzI0ODAkajYwJGwwJGgw\" target=\"_blank\">A Sept. 9 survey by the Siena Research Institute</a> found Mamdani at 46 percent in a four-way race,  with Cuomo in second place at 24 percent, Sliwa at 15 percent and Adams with 9 percent. </p>   <p>Some Democrats who back Mamdani have been fiercely critical of party leaders who've stayed on the sidelines. After Jacobs announced that he wouldn't endorse his party's candidate, state Senator Mike Gianaris called the decision \"disgraceful.\"</p>   <p>\"The chair of the Democratic Party refusing to support the candidate clearly selected by the voters of the Democratic Party,\" <a href=\"https://x.com/SenGianaris/status/1968734432602227150\" target=\"_blank\">Gianaris wrote on the social media platform X</a>. \"If he won't perform that most basic responsibility of a party leader, what exactly is he doing over there?\"</p>\n</div>"

House leaders cancelled planned votes for next Monday and Tuesday and the chamber isn't scheduled to return until late next week.</p>   \n   <p>GOP leaders insist Democrats would bear the blame if there is any interruption in funding, and have dubbed the dynamic \"the Schumer shutdown.\"</p>   <p>In a letter to House Democrats, Jeffries said he would hold a virtual meeting with members on Friday afternoon to talk about the next steps. He noted that House GOP leaders change the schedule for next week but that he scheduled a caucus meeting for all House Democrats on Monday evening. \"Democrats will be in town and prepared to get the job done.\"</p>\n</div>"

It said that in order to secure seats for High Holidays services — the holiest days of the Jewish year — you must show proof of voter registration.</p>   <p>The synagogue's letter comes weeks before New York City's mayoral election on November 4. It reads in part, \"We believe we must put in our best effort to try to avoid a very serious danger that can affect all of us.\"</p>   \n   <p>The letter does not mention any candidate by name. Nor does it tell congregants what party to register with, or who to vote for or against. But it does warn that the outcome of the election could result in \"very serious problems\" for the Jewish community, and that as a result the synagogue had no choice but to make this requirement.</p>   <p>Shaare Zion is the largest Syrian synagogue in New York City, and an important and influential part of the Sephardic Jewish community. That includes Jews with roots in the Iberian Peninsula, and sometimes Mizrahi Jews from the Middle East and North Africa.</p>   <h3>Synagogue-state relations</h3>   <p>Scholars who study church-state relations say they cannot recall another house of worship ever taking this kind of step.</p>   <p>\"Asking a congregant to register with the implications that it's for the mayoral election in a Jewish congregation implies very much a divine sanction for voting and perhaps leaning one way or the other,\" said <a href=\"https://religiousstudies.wustl.edu/people/mark-valeri\" target=\"_blank\">Mark Valeri</a>, professor of religion and politics at Washington University in St. Louis.</p>   <p>\"My surmise is there is fear of [Zohran] Mamdani being elected,\" said Valeri.</p>   <p>Mark Treyger is CEO of the Jewish Community Relations Council and a former city councilmember who represented the south Brooklyn district that includes Shaare Zion. He says the concerns raised in the letter are ones he's heard elsewhere about Mamdani, who <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2025/06/25/nx-s1-5444734/zohran-mamdani-set-to-defeat-cuomo-in-nyc-mayoral-primary-upset\" target=\"_blank\">won the Democratic primary in June</a>.</p>   \n   <p>\"Given his victory, it has compounded existing concerns that were raised before this primary occurred about public safety and the future of policing and how to handle protests and how to protect shuls [synagogues] and schools,\" said Treyger.</p>   <h3>Is it religiously permissible?</h3>   <p>Even with these concerns in mind, there are lingering questions about a synagogue's ability to require voter registration.</p>   <p>Valeri says because of the letter's careful wording — it doesn't name a candidate or tell people how to vote — there's no obvious legal issue with it.</p>   <p>Religiously, the question is different.</p>   <p>\"It is terribly unusual,\" said <a href=\"https://www.yu.edu/faculty/pages/bleich-j\" target=\"_blank\">Rabbi David Bleich</a>, a high ranking and respected rabbinical authority at Yeshiva University in New York. \"The question isn't whether it's unusual — it's whether it's permissible.\"</p>   <p>By \"permissible,\" Bleich means according to Jewish law.</p>   <p>\"On what grounds would a religious organization impose all sorts of conditions that have nothing to do with religion or spirituality?\" said Bleich.</p>   <p>Rabbi Bleich says synagogues often have membership requirements. And — he thinks people <em>should </em>vote. But combining the two – having requirements in order to attend services? It doesn't sit well with him.</p>   <p>\"The only way they can even work under any kind of color of religious right is by claiming that these people are in violation of a religious duty,\" said Bleich. \"And I respond by asking — do you require that any Jew entering be a Sabbath observer also? It's a little bit ludicrous.\"</p>\n</div>"

    "body": "<div>\n      <p>A handful of states led by Democrats could have attempted mid-decade redistricting to counter President Trump's push in GOP-led states, but aside from California, they have been slow to act.</p>   \n</div><div>\n    <p>AILSA CHANG, HOST: </p><p> President Trump has repeatedly called for Republican-led states to redraw their congressional districts before next year's midterms. Texas did so, Missouri's new map awaits the governor's signature, and leaders in Florida and Indiana are openly discussing it. Democratic-led states have mostly been slow to act in response. Colorado Public Radio's Bente Birkeland reports from her state.</p><p>BENTE BIRKELAND, BYLINE: California voters will decide this November whether to temporarily bypass their independent redistricting commission to draw five more blue seats. And in August, Governor Gavin Newsom made a plea. He asked blue states to join California's fight against GOP gerrymandering.</p><p>(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)</p><p>GAVIN NEWSOM: We need to stand up. Not just California. Other blue states need to stand up.</p><p>(CHEERING)</p><p>NEWSOM: We need to be firm. And I resolve...</p><p>BIRKELAND: But that hasn't happened. Democratic governors in already-gerrymandered states like Illinois and Maryland have said everything's on the table, but haven't made any moves. Then there's Colorado. Like California, it has an independent redistricting commission. Multimillionaire businessman Kent Thiry helped spearhead the movement in those two states. He says this national partisan battle is like his worst nightmare coming true.</p><p>KENT THIRY: Anyone who treasures representative democracy and the fragility of representative democracy has to be just horrified at what is happening right now.</p><p>BIRKELAND: Thiry says even though he doesn't want Colorado to follow California's lead...</p><p>THIRY: I am not critical of those who have decided that right now they're in a gunfight and you can't unilaterally disarm. I respect that logic, I just won't be an active part of it.</p><p>BIRKELAND: In Colorado, Democrats control state government and hold both U.S. Senate seats, but the House delegation is four Democrats and four Republicans. Some political observers say, in theory, it wouldn't be that hard to draw two more seats favorable to Democrats. However, Colorado Governor Jared Polis told progressive podcaster Brian Tyler Cohen that it's impossible to change how the state draws congressional lines before the midterm election.</p><p>(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)</p><p>JARED POLIS: Our state constitution has a process. That cannot be amended in an off year. So there is no mechanism to go to the ballot this year, like California is doing.</p><p>BIRKELAND: That means 2026 is the earliest something could get on the ballot. But changing how Colorado redistricts to make it partisan isn't an idea Polis seems to support. And he doesn't think voters would, either.</p><p>(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)</p><p>POLIS: They see through this. And swing voters, unaffiliated voters really don't like this kind of sheer arrogance.</p><p>BIRKELAND: Polis says he thinks Democrats can flip seats by focusing on other things, like the impact of Trump's massive tax and spending bill.</p><p>(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)</p><p>POLIS: This is going to be an albatross around the neck of all the Republicans that voted for it.</p><p>BIRKELAND: But outside of Colorado's political establishment, some on the left do want to fight back. Jorge Rodriguez is an accountant from the northern part of the state. He's trying to put a question on the 2026 ballot to allow Colorado to draw more blue seats. Rodriguez says his idea gained traction after he posted about it on Reddit.</p><p>JORGE RODRIGUEZ: Kind of frustrated why Democratic leaders in Colorado are not trying to do anything. They're just playing it silent.</p><p>BIRKELAND: Rodriguez's idea still faces hurdles. The ballot title hasn't been approved, and then backers would need to raise money to get enough signatures to put it before voters and launch a statewide campaign. Rodriguez himself voted for Colorado's independent commission back in 2018.</p><p>RODRIGUEZ: I don't regret it, but in light of what's going on right now nationally, I - you know, things can change. And things have changed.</p><p>BIRKELAND: But if change happens in Colorado - and that's a big if - the state will have to wait until after 2026.</p><p>For NPR News, I'm Bente Birkeland in Colorado.</p><p>(SOUNDBITE OF HERMANOS GUTIERREZ'S \"AMAR Y VIVIR\")</p>\n    <p>Copyright © 2025 NPR.

The network could also likely be used for espionage.</p>   \n   <p>According to the Secret Service, there were over 300 SIM servers, 100,000 SIM cards, and other illicit materials found in multiple sites in the tristate area surrounding New York City. Secret Service agents are working alongside the New York Police Department and other law enforcement agencies including Homeland Security Investigations to conduct forensic analysis on the devices. Matt McCool, the special agent in charge of the U.S. Secret Service Washington field office, said forensic investigation has already revealed the involvement of at least one foreign nation, as well as several bad actors already known to law enforcement.</p>   <p>McCool said the investigation is ongoing and that the agency made the decision to share information about the threat with the public in the early stages \"to safeguard critical infrastructure.\"</p>   <p>The investigation comes at a time when U.S. national security officials and private sector experts are<a href=\"https://2021-2025.state.gov/office-of-the-spokesperson/releases/2025/01/u-s-takes-action-against-prc-linked-cyber-actors-for-treasury-hack-and-salt-typhoon/\" target=\"_blank\"> tracking ongoing breaches</a> of telecommunications companies, aiming to steal private communications of senior U.S. government officials including President Trump. The group responsible, often referred to as Salt Typhoon, has been linked to the Chinese government. The campaign was first disclosed last year.</p>   <p>The U.S. Secret Service did not say whether the devices uncovered in New York had any connection to Salt Typhoon operations. However, McCool insisted the investigation of this cache was kicked off after picking up on earlier, specific telecommunications-related threats.</p>   \n   <p>\"Following multiple telecommunications-related imminent threats directed towards senior U.S. government officials this spring, the Secret Service began a protective intelligence investigation to determine the extent and impact these threats could have on protective operations,\" McCool said.</p>   <p>If the network of devices was intended to disrupt or spy on the U.N. General Assembly, it wouldn't be the first time that the diplomatic gathering, which attracts more than 100 foreign officials and their staffs, has been targeted. Former intelligence officials <a href=\"https://codeanddagger.com/news/2017/9/19/un-general-assembly-is-superbowl-of-espionage-ex-spy-says\" target=\"_blank\">have described the occasion</a> as \"the Super Bowl of espionage.\" If the massive cache of devices was used to shut down cellphone networks and potentially impair emergency communications, that would go beyond what might be an expected level of monitoring and spying.</p>   <p>However, it's unclear how long the network of devices was in operation around New York City, and whether its operators were hoping to disrupt the geopolitical gathering, rather than spying or organizing criminal activity in the area.<br /></p>\n</div>"

Kennedy Jr. and Centers for Medicare and Medicaid chief Dr. Mehmet Oz, said Monday that autism rates are up <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/sections/shots-health-news/2025/09/22/nx-s1-5550153/trump-rfk-autism-tylenol-leucovorin-pregnancy\" target=\"_blank\">because pregnant women are taking the medicine</a> that is often used to treat pain and fever.</p>   <p>\"Taking Tylenol is not good,\" Trump said during an announcement in which he also discouraged giving the medicine to young children. Tylenol's maker, Kenvue, told NPR in a statement that \"independent, sound science clearly shows that taking acetaminophen does not cause autism. We strongly disagree with any suggestion otherwise and are deeply concerned about the health risks and confusion this poses for expecting mothers and parents.\"</p>   \n   <p>Helen Tager-Flusberg, director of the Center for Autism Research Excellence (CARE) at Boston University and founder of the Coalition of Autism Scientists, called the administration's announcement \"appalling.\" She said it was \"a very significant distortion\" of what science says about any possible links between acetaminophen and autism.</p>   <p>The message \"is likely to impact millions of lives of pregnant women right now. Mothers of autistic children who are going to be so fearful that this is what they did to cause their child's autism, which is absolutely not the case,\" Tager-Flusberg said.</p>   <p>Speaking to NPR's Michel Martin, Tager-Flusberg, who has studied autism for decades, responded to claims Trump made about autism, acetaminophen and vaccines, and the FDA's move to label leucovorin as a treatment option for autism.</p>   <h3><strong>Genetics play a larger role in autism</strong></h3>   <p>At the White House Monday, Trump said pregnant patients should \"fight like hell not to take [acetaminophen].\" He continued saying: \"There may be a point where you have to and that – you'll have to work out with yourself. So don't take Tylenol.\"</p>   <p>A study <a href=\"https://ehjournal.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12940-025-01208-0\" target=\"_blank\">released in August by Harvard University</a> found that women who said they took acetaminophen while pregnant seemed more likely to have a child diagnosed with autism. Ann Bauer, an epidemiologist who worked on that study, told NPR she worried it was too soon for the federal government to offer guidance and that the research community needed to see more evidence.</p>   \n   <p>Tager-Flusberg said that if there is an association between acetaminophen and autism, it is \"small\" and \"limited\" and \"interacts most likely with the genetics, which is the main contribution to what causes autism.\"</p>   <p>She added, \"There's absolutely no evidence out there to support the kind of strong statement that we heard from President Trump.\"</p>   <h3><strong>There is no link between the autism and the measles, mumps and rubella vaccine  </strong></h3>   <p>Tager-Flusberg said the combination MMR vaccine (measles, mumps and rubella) — which Trump also took aim at Monday — is \"perfectly safe\" and that research has completely debunked any links between it and autism. Study after study <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2025/02/13/1231104444/the-anti-vaccine-movement\" target=\"_blank\">have found no link between autism and the vaccine</a>, which is typically administered to children after their first birthday and again between ages 4 and 6, <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/hcp/imz-schedules/child-adolescent-age.html\" target=\"_blank\">according to the CDC</a>.</p>   \n   <p>On Monday, Trump suggested splitting the MMR vaccine's administration into multiple visits.</p>   <p>\"Don't let them pump your baby up with the largest pile of stuff you've ever seen in your life, going into the delicate little body of a baby, even if it's two years, three years, four years, you just break it up into, I would say five, but let's say four, four visits to the doctor instead of one.\"</p>   \n   <p>Tager-Flusberg said Trump raising the concern is \"likely to raise fear among mothers, confusion and chaos for pediatricians.\"</p>   <p>\"This is really not what our society needs right now,\" she added.</p>   <h3><strong>Is leucovorin a valid treatment for speech deficiencies caused by autism?</strong></h3>   <p>The Food and Drug Administration <a href=\"https://www.fda.gov/news-events/press-announcements/fda-takes-action-make-treatment-available-autism-symptoms\" target=\"_blank\">also announced Monday that it would label leucovorin</a>, a form of vitamin B typically used along with cancer medicines, as a treatment for speech-related deficits associated with autism.</p>   <p>Tager-Flusberg said that while a \"promising\" small-scale study showed language improvement for a group of children who were administered leucovorin, the treatment has — at best — \"weak evidence in support of it.\"</p>   <p>She added that researchers need to build on early studies with a large-scale, randomized controlled trial and that they need to know what outcomes can be expected, dosage levels and which children to observe.</p>   <p>\"We need a study to investigate this right now, far before the FDA … should be approving this medication,\" Tager-Flusberg said. \"They haven't done this for a single other medication in the history of autism.\"<br /></p>   <p><em>This digital story was edited by Majd Al-Waheidi.

General Assembly, even suggesting that Ukraine could \"maybe even go further than that!\"</p>   \n   <p>The reversal is the latest example of how Trump has swung between deference, frustration and indirect threats against Russia. Early in his second term, Trump boasted that his close relationship with Russian President Vladimir Putin would help him broker a quick resolution to the conflict.</p>   <p>But as the war dragged on, Trump has grown increasingly frustrated with Putin. In July, during a meeting with the NATO Secretary General, Trump lashed out at Putin and announced that he was sending Patriot air defense missiles to Ukraine.</p>   \n   <p>As recently as last month – when Trump met Putin in Alaska to try to broker an end to the war – Trump had said he believed \"some land-swapping\" would take place. Zelenskyy <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2025/08/09/g-s1-81860/zelenskyy-rejects-ceding-ukrainian-territory\" target=\"_blank\"><u>has been resistant</u></a> to that idea.</p>   \n   <p>Afterward, Trump said the two countries needed to discuss \"the possible exchanges of territory, taking into consideration the current line of contact. That means, the war zone.\"</p>   <p>But since the Alaska talks, there have been no signs that Putin is willing to meet Zelenskyy. Russia has ramped up its strikes on Ukraine, and there have been a <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2025/09/21/nx-s1-5549406/russia-nato-plane-baltic-sea-germany-sweden\" target=\"_blank\"><u>series of incursions</u></a> by Russian military aircraft into NATO airspace in the month since the talks.</p>   <p>Trump said he thinks NATO members should shoot down Russian aircraft in such cases. \"Yes, I do,\" he said in answer to a question from a reporter.</p>   \n   <p>Asked whether he would back up NATO allies if that happened, Trump said: \"Depends on the circumstance, but you know we're very strong toward NATO.\"</p>   <p>In his social media post, Trump said Russia looks like \"a paper tiger\" because the war has dragged on for so long, and said that the United States would continue to supply weapons to NATO. \"Good luck to all!\" Trump said.</p>   <p>Trump has so far resisted calls for tougher sanctions, insisting that European leaders first need to stop buying oil from Russia, as well as apply steep tariffs for major buyers of Russian oil, like China.</p>   \n   <p>In a pointed speech to world leaders at the United Nations General Assembly on Tuesday, Trump said it was inexcusable that some NATO members were still buying Russian energy. \"Think of it: they're funding the war against themselves. Who the hell ever heard of that one?\"</p>   <p>Zelenskyy said he was hoping to see more sanctions on Russia, and said he supported <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2025/09/13/nx-s1-5540664/trump-russia-sanctions-nato-ukraine\" target=\"_blank\">Trump's push to get NATO members to stop buying Russian energy</a>.</p>   <p>Zelenskyy said he had spoken with Slovakia's prime minister who seemed open to cutting off its imports. \"I'm not sure the Hungarians are ready,\" Zelenskyy said. Trump said he hasn't spoken to Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban about it yet. \"I had a feeling if I did, he might stop,\" Trump said.</p>\n</div>"

Harris believes she was loyal to the Bidens, but says the feeling wasn't mutual</strong></h3>   <p>Loyalty is one of the underlying themes in Harris' book. It's even laid out in one of the introduction quotes before the memoir begins from Kendrick Lamar's \"DNA\": \"I got loyalty, got royalty inside my DNA.\"</p>   \n   <p>Harris writes of times that Biden, his family and his senior staff in the West Wing questioned whether Harris truly was loyal, while her own frustrations mounted from the president's staff not speaking up to defend her from outside criticism. </p>   <p>In the tumultuous weeks after Biden's disastrous debate performance last summer — when high-profile Democrats began to question his ability to beat Trump — first lady Jill Biden pulled aside Harris' husband, Second Gentleman Doug Emhoff, to ask if they were standing by the Bidens. Harris says that irked Emhoff. </p>   <p>In another instance, two months into Harris' bid, right as she was about to get on the debate stage, Harris writes that Biden called her. He wished her luck — but then spent time on the call asking if she was bashing him to \"powerbrokers.\"</p>   <p>\"I just couldn't understand why he would call me, right now, and make it all about himself,\" she writes.</p>   <p>A spokesperson for Biden declined to comment.</p>   <h3><strong>2. She doesn't directly say that Biden shouldn't have run for a second term</strong></h3>   <p>Harris doesn't make any comment in the book on whether Biden should have run for a second term at all. She defends his mental capacity to serve as president but writes that Biden's staff mismanaged his fatigue and worsened the issue.</p>   \n   <p>By the time last summer's debate debacle came around, and questions mounted on whether Biden should stay in the race, she says, she was in the \"worst position\" to tell Biden to drop out.</p>   <p>\"He would see it as naked ambition, perhaps as poisonous disloyalty, even if my only message was: Don't let the other guy win,\" Harris writes.</p>   \n   <p>She writes that she perhaps should have told Biden in the aftermath of the debate to drop out, but that \"maybe he was right\" to think voters would support him in a second match-up against Trump. In the end, Harris says, it was \"Joe and Jill's decision.\"</p>   <p>But Harris acknowledges in the book that it was \"recklessness\" to leave the decision of whether Biden should drop out to the Bidens themselves. \"It should have been more than a personal decision.\"</p>   <p>In an interview on MSNBC Monday night, Harris admitted, \"I have and had a certain responsibility that I should have followed through on. … When I talk about the recklessness, as much as anything, I'm talking about myself.\"</p>   \n   <p>Harris notes that throughout her run, she struggled to distance herself from Biden and his legacy — like when she told ABC's <em>The View</em> that she wouldn't have done anything different than Biden in their years in office.</p>   <p>She says at one point, her adviser David Plouffe didn't mince words: \"People hate Joe Biden,\" he said.</p>   <h3><strong>3. Her first choice as running mate was Pete Buttigieg</strong></h3>   <p>Harris reveals that Pete Buttigieg, her former 2020 political rival who served as transportation secretary in the Biden administration, is a close friend and was her first choice for running mate. She compliments Buttigieg as a savvy communicator and says he would have been an \"ideal partner,\" but she had reservations about whether Americans would accept a ticket with a Black woman married to a Jewish man alongside a gay man.</p>   \n   <p>Buttigieg responded in a statement to <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/news/2025/09/18/buttigieg-harris-runing-mate-107-days-00571954\" target=\"_blank\"><u>Politico</u></a>, \"My experience in politics has been that the way that you earn trust with voters is based mostly on what they think you're going to do for their lives, not on categories.\"</p>   <div>\n            <div>\n        <picture>\n            <source srcset=\"https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/1024x683+0+0/resize/400/quality/85/format/webp/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F1c%2Fdc%2F65c79de64ccba2ec471c7c2949f0%2Fgettyimages-2181638838.jpg 400w, https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/1024x683+0+0/resize/600/quality/85/format/webp/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F1c%2Fdc%2F65c79de64ccba2ec471c7c2949f0%2Fgettyimages-2181638838.jpg 600w, https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/1024x683+0+0/resize/800/quality/85/format/webp/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F1c%2Fdc%2F65c79de64ccba2ec471c7c2949f0%2Fgettyimages-2181638838.jpg 800w, https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/1024x683+0+0/resize/900/quality/85/format/webp/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F1c%2Fdc%2F65c79de64ccba2ec471c7c2949f0%2Fgettyimages-2181638838.jpg 900w, https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/1024x683+0+0/resize/1200/quality/85/format/webp/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F1c%2Fdc%2F65c79de64ccba2ec471c7c2949f0%2Fgettyimages-2181638838.jpg 1200w, https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/1024x683+0+0/resize/1600/quality/85/format/webp/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F1c%2Fdc%2F65c79de64ccba2ec471c7c2949f0%2Fgettyimages-2181638838.jpg 1600w, https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/1024x683+0+0/resize/1800/quality/85/format/webp/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F1c%2Fdc%2F65c79de64ccba2ec471c7c2949f0%2Fgettyimages-2181638838.jpg 1800w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1025px) 650px, calc(100vw - 30px)\" type=\"image/webp\"></source>\n            <source srcset=\"https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/1024x683+0+0/resize/400/quality/85/format/jpeg/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F1c%2Fdc%2F65c79de64ccba2ec471c7c2949f0%2Fgettyimages-2181638838.jpg 400w, https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/1024x683+0+0/resize/600/quality/85/format/jpeg/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F1c%2Fdc%2F65c79de64ccba2ec471c7c2949f0%2Fgettyimages-2181638838.jpg 600w, https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/1024x683+0+0/resize/800/quality/85/format/jpeg/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F1c%2Fdc%2F65c79de64ccba2ec471c7c2949f0%2Fgettyimages-2181638838.jpg 800w, https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/1024x683+0+0/resize/900/quality/85/format/jpeg/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F1c%2Fdc%2F65c79de64ccba2ec471c7c2949f0%2Fgettyimages-2181638838.jpg 900w, https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/1024x683+0+0/resize/1200/quality/85/format/jpeg/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F1c%2Fdc%2F65c79de64ccba2ec471c7c2949f0%2Fgettyimages-2181638838.jpg 1200w, https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/1024x683+0+0/resize/1600/quality/85/format/jpeg/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F1c%2Fdc%2F65c79de64ccba2ec471c7c2949f0%2Fgettyimages-2181638838.jpg 1600w, https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/1024x683+0+0/resize/1800/quality/85/format/jpeg/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F1c%2Fdc%2F65c79de64ccba2ec471c7c2949f0%2Fgettyimages-2181638838.jpg 1800w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1025px) 650px, calc(100vw - 30px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\"></source>\n            <img src=\"https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/1024x683+0+0/resize/1100/quality/50/format/jpeg/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F1c%2Fdc%2F65c79de64ccba2ec471c7c2949f0%2Fgettyimages-2181638838.jpg\" alt=\"Former Vice President Kamala Harris takes the stage after being introduced by then-Democratic vice presidential nominee, Minnesota Gov.

It was a contrast to Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro, whom Harris is critical of in her book and paints as too ambitious for being a No. 2. She says Shapiro asked one of her staffers about how many rooms the VP's residence had, and on the way in for his final interview, wondered how he could get work from Pennsylvania artists sent to the house.</p>   <p>She muses that Shapiro tried to call her to withdraw himself as a contender right before she named Walz because he knew he wouldn't be her choice.</p>   <p>Shapiro's spokesperson Manuel Bonder said in a statement, \"it's simply ridiculous to suggest that Governor Shapiro was focused on anything other than defeating Donald Trump. … The conclusion of this process was a deeply personal decision for both him and the Vice President.\"</p>   \n   <h3><strong>4. She is still trying to tell her own backstory</strong></h3>   <p>Harris has typically been a buttoned-up politician, especially when it comes to sharing personal anecdotes. In the memoir, though, she's more candid and reveals some of the personal struggles and stresses of her run for president — like the toll it took on her relationship with Emhoff.</p>   <p>But in most other parts of the book, it seems Harris is still trying to tell her own story to the public — something the campaign was pressed to do in a short window of time last year after Biden dropped out. After three and a half years of being a vice president that largely left her in the shadows, Harris spent several weeks on the campaign trail trying to reintroduce herself to the country in her own words.</p>   \n   <p>The book is peppered with familiar stump speech lines from Harris, along with explanations about her decision to become a prosecutor and lessons from her mother.</p>   <p>She also recounts her time as vice president meeting with foreign leaders like Ukraine's Volodymyr Zelenskyy and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, as well as leading on issues like gun violence prevention from the White House.</p>   <h3><strong>5. What's next for Harris is still unanswered</strong></h3>   <p>In the last few pages of her book, Harris gives some vague ideas for what she sees as the path forward for Democrats, and for the country.</p>   \n   <p>\"We need to come up with our own blueprint that sets out our alternative vision for our country,\" Harris writes, adding that \"the heart\" of her vision is investing in educating Gen Z.</p>   \n   <p>While she touches on the topics of transgender athletes and Israel's war in Gaza in the book, Harris doesn't offer any suggestions for how the party should handle specific issues going forward. Besides noting that she wants to \"be with the people\" and hear their ideas, Harris also doesn't indicate what her own future in politics will look like. She does say that the answer for what's next, though, won't come from Washington.</p>   <p>Her book tour, which kicks off Wednesday in New York, will include nearly 20 stops around the country, as well as London and Toronto.</p>\n</div>"

I've always said it. It has such tremendous, tremendous potential, but it's not even coming close to living up to that potential,\" Trump said.</p>   \n   <p>In his remarks in New York, Trump also repeated his assertion that the U.S. has entered a \"golden age\" and discussed the conflicts in Ukraine and Gaza.</p>   <p>Trump is finding himself increasingly isolated at the U.N., where there is a growing push to <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2025/09/18/nx-s1-5544343/trump-starmer-press-conference\" target=\"_blank\">recognize a Palestinian state</a>.</p>   <p>Trump said those efforts, <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2025/09/21/nx-s1-5549084/uk-canada-recognize-palestinian-state-australia\" target=\"_blank\">notably by the U.K., France and Canada</a>, among others, were a mistake.</p>   <p>\"The rewards would be too great for Hamas terrorists for their atrocities. This would be a reward for these horrible atrocities,\" he said, in line with Israel's position.</p>   \n   <p>Ahead of Trump, the U.N. Secretary General António Guterres kicked off the General Assembly Tuesday by saying that nothing can justify the Oct. 7 attacks.</p>   <p>He added, \"Nothing can justify collective punishment of the Palestinian people or any form of ethnic cleansing. I call once again for a ceasefire, the release of hostages and unhindered humanitarian access.\"</p>   \n   <p>Trump plans to hold meetings later in the day with leaders of the Middle East to discuss Gaza.</p>   <p>He will also keep his attention on the conflict in Ukraine. Trump said in his speech that he will be putting pressure on European leaders to stop buying oil from Russia as punishment for its ongoing assault on Ukraine.</p>   <p>\"They're funding the war against themselves,\" he said. \"Who the hell ever heard of that one?\"</p>   <p>Trump has increasingly criticized NATO for expecting the U.S. to pressure Russia directly when they could do more themselves.</p>   <p>Meanwhile, Russia has been testing European leaders and the alliance with recent incursions into NATO airspace. Trump said he thinks NATO members should shoot down Russian aircraft in such cases. \"Yes, I do,\" he said in answer to a question from a reporter.</p>   <p>Asked whether he would back up NATO allies if that happened, Trump said: \"Depends on the circumstance, but you know we're very strong toward NATO.\"</p>   \n   <p>The questions came as Trump was meeting with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy on the sidelines of the U.N. General Assembly.</p>   <p>Trump praised Zelenskyy, calling him a \"great man\" whose country was putting up \"one hell of a fight.\" He said the Russian economy was \"crashing.\"</p>   <p>Zelenskyy said he was hoping to see more sanctions on Russia, and said he supported <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2025/09/13/nx-s1-5540664/trump-russia-sanctions-nato-ukraine\" target=\"_blank\">Trump's push to get NATO members to stop buying Russian energy</a>. </p>   <div>\n            <div>\n        <picture>\n            <source srcset=\"https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/7640x5095+0+0/resize/400/quality/85/format/webp/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F9b%2F80%2F8432deee426aa6178c8b4974124c%2Fgettyimages-2236955716.jpg 400w, https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/7640x5095+0+0/resize/600/quality/85/format/webp/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F9b%2F80%2F8432deee426aa6178c8b4974124c%2Fgettyimages-2236955716.jpg 600w, https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/7640x5095+0+0/resize/800/quality/85/format/webp/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F9b%2F80%2F8432deee426aa6178c8b4974124c%2Fgettyimages-2236955716.jpg 800w, https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/7640x5095+0+0/resize/900/quality/85/format/webp/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F9b%2F80%2F8432deee426aa6178c8b4974124c%2Fgettyimages-2236955716.jpg 900w, https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/7640x5095+0+0/resize/1200/quality/85/format/webp/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F9b%2F80%2F8432deee426aa6178c8b4974124c%2Fgettyimages-2236955716.jpg 1200w, https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/7640x5095+0+0/resize/1600/quality/85/format/webp/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F9b%2F80%2F8432deee426aa6178c8b4974124c%2Fgettyimages-2236955716.jpg 1600w, https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/7640x5095+0+0/resize/1800/quality/85/format/webp/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F9b%2F80%2F8432deee426aa6178c8b4974124c%2Fgettyimages-2236955716.jpg 1800w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1025px) 650px, calc(100vw - 30px)\" type=\"image/webp\"></source>\n            <source srcset=\"https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/7640x5095+0+0/resize/400/quality/85/format/jpeg/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F9b%2F80%2F8432deee426aa6178c8b4974124c%2Fgettyimages-2236955716.jpg 400w, https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/7640x5095+0+0/resize/600/quality/85/format/jpeg/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F9b%2F80%2F8432deee426aa6178c8b4974124c%2Fgettyimages-2236955716.jpg 600w, https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/7640x5095+0+0/resize/800/quality/85/format/jpeg/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F9b%2F80%2F8432deee426aa6178c8b4974124c%2Fgettyimages-2236955716.jpg 800w, https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/7640x5095+0+0/resize/900/quality/85/format/jpeg/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F9b%2F80%2F8432deee426aa6178c8b4974124c%2Fgettyimages-2236955716.jpg 900w, https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/7640x5095+0+0/resize/1200/quality/85/format/jpeg/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F9b%2F80%2F8432deee426aa6178c8b4974124c%2Fgettyimages-2236955716.jpg 1200w, https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/7640x5095+0+0/resize/1600/quality/85/format/jpeg/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F9b%2F80%2F8432deee426aa6178c8b4974124c%2Fgettyimages-2236955716.jpg 1600w, https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/7640x5095+0+0/resize/1800/quality/85/format/jpeg/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F9b%2F80%2F8432deee426aa6178c8b4974124c%2Fgettyimages-2236955716.jpg 1800w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1025px) 650px, calc(100vw - 30px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\"></source>\n            <img src=\"https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/7640x5095+0+0/resize/1100/quality/50/format/jpeg/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F9b%2F80%2F8432deee426aa6178c8b4974124c%2Fgettyimages-2236955716.jpg\" alt=\"President Trump speaks during a bilateral meeting with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy at the 80th session of the U.N.
