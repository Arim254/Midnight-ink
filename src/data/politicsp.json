    "body": "<div>\n      <p>NPR's Scott Simon talks with Sen. Ron Johnson of Wisconsin about the looming government shutdown, and his proposed bill that aims to end shutdowns for good.</p>   \n</div><div>\n    <p>SCOTT SIMON, HOST: </p><p> The U.S. government is hurtling toward a shutdown unless lawmakers can reach a spending deal before midnight Tuesday. House Republicans have passed a short-term extension. But in the Senate, Democrats are holding out for more than $1 trillion in spending, primarily on health care. Senator Ron Johnson, Republican of Wisconsin, joins us now from his home state. Senator, thanks so much for being with us.</p><p>RON JOHNSON: Good morning, Scott. Hope you're doing well.</p><p>SIMON: I hope you're doing well, sir. And let's ask about the possibility of a shutdown. Would you be willing to compromise with Democrats to keep health care benefits to avoid one?</p><p>JOHNSON: Well, first of all, aren't you getting sick of reporting on this year after year? I sure am. Since I've been there, since 2011, we've had three shutdowns, 55 continuing resolutions. We've increased or suspended the debt ceiling 12 times, taking our debt from $14 trillion to $37 trillion in debt. Last year, it took us six months to finally come to agreement to finally fund government. So what I'm suggesting is passing a bill - Eliminate Shutdowns Act - that gets rid of this for all time, ends the turmoil. It's incredibly simple. All you have to do is just pass this bill, and then you'll establish 14-day rolling continuing appropriations if you haven't appropriated for these particular departments. It's just really simple, so there shouldn't be any compromise needed. Just pass this bill and then get to work on individual appropriation bills.</p><p>SIMON: Well - but with respect, sir, that - I mean, your bill hasn't passed yet. What would you be willing to do over the next few days?</p><p>JOHNSON: We can - we're going to vote on it on Monday. And so we'll also be voting on the House bill. The, you know, House passed a continuing resolution up to Thanksgiving. And by the way, that's the well-honed process by the uniparty to put pressure on the process to just pass anything, which has then resulted in us going from $14 trillion to $37 trillion. It's designed to increase spending. Everybody has to get together and compromise to spend more on everybody's programs. Again, we can't afford this. So again, let's end the dysfunction. There's no reason - this is what we do in Wisconsin. It's really why I proposed this bill. In - back in the '50s, Wisconsin said, OK, if we're so dysfunctional we can't pass appropriation bills, we don't shut down the agencies. We just fund them at last year's levels. Isn't that incredibly common sense? That's what we ought to do.</p><p>SIMON: But does the threat of a shutdown encourage the parties to compromise?</p><p>JOHNSON: Yeah, I mean, compromise to spend a whole lot more money on everybody's priorities. So again, there'll be plenty of pressure to pass appropriation bills because we've got big spenders. Last year's funding level will never be enough for a lot of the members, so it'll be plenty of pressure. We would just end the turmoil. Listen, this is politicians playing games with people's lives. We ought to end it. There's no need for it whatsoever. I come from the private sector. This is beyond absurd - how dysfunctional Congress is. But we...</p><p>SIMON: Are we in a - I didn't ask.</p><p>JOHNSON: We need to stop accepting it.</p><p>SIMON: Senator, are we in a state of affairs now, though, where politicians believe there are more points to be won by refusing to compromise, even if it results in another shutdown?</p><p>JOHNSON: Well, again, what I'm saying is, let's get rid of all of that. Again, isn't this this elegantly simple solution? By the way, this is what'll end up happening. This will be the end result. It's what the end result was last year. We - again, six months until we came to a full-year continuing resolution. That's it. Democrats - this is how reasonable they are. They'll give us four-week continuing resolution. All we have to do is spend another $1.5 trillion over the next 10 years. So they obviously don't want to compromise. Again, I don't need compromise right now. Just continue to fund the government at last year's level. Then start working on individual appropriation bills.</p><p>SIMON: Would you still want to eliminate shutdowns under a Democratic president? Because...</p><p>JOHNSON: Yes.</p><p>SIMON: ...It could...</p><p>JOHNSON: Yes. I mean, if I pass this bill, you'll never have another shutdown ever. You'll just - you - again, if you don't pass appropriation - no matter who's in power, if you don't pass an appropriation bill for the whole of government or individual departments, you just spend at last year's level. Two-week rolling continuing appropriations, and then you get back to work.</p><p>SIMON: Are you saying, essentially, pass my bill or there'll be a shutdown?</p><p>JOHNSON: No. I'll vote for the House continuing resolution. I've generally voted for continuing resolutions, as much as I hate them, because I don't want to shut down government. It's very inefficient. It hurts people. This sets up an automatic continuing appropriation. You'll never have another shutdown ever. You'll never have to have this conversation. We'll never have to do another interview like this. Won't that be great?</p><p>SIMON: Well, it's always good to talk to you. Senator Ron Johnson, thanks so much for joining us.</p><p>JOHNSON: Have a great day.</p>\n    <p>Copyright © 2025 NPR.

Jeff Merkley warned the public that Trump would try to create chaos. \"Don't take the bait,\" he said.</p>   <p>\"Our responsibility is to, yes, express our views. Yes, protest,\" Merkley said. \"But best done at a distance from these federal troops, wherever they might be and whatever they are doing, because their goal is to create an engagement, an engagement that will lead to conflict.\"</p>   <p>Trump previously threatened to send the National Guard into Chicago but has yet to follow through. A deployment in Memphis, Tennessee, is expected soon and will include only about 150 troops, far less than were sent to the District of Columbia for Trump's crackdown on crime or in Los Angeles in response to immigration protests that turned violent with the troops' arrival. Trump also sent Marines to Los Angeles.</p>   <p>Pentagon officials did not immediately respond to requests for information. Nor did the office of Oregon Gov. Tina Kotek, a Democrat.</p>   <p>Portland Mayor Keith Wilson said Friday night that the city already was seeing a sudden surge in federal agents, describing armored vehicles and agents arriving on the streets.</p>   <p>\"We did not ask for them to come,\" the Democratic mayor said. \"They are here without clear precedent or purpose.\"</p>   \n   <p>Portland, population 636,000, was the site of long-running and sometimes violent racial justice protests following George Floyd's murder by Minneapolis police in 2020. The Trump administration sent hundreds of agents, including from the U.S. Border Patrol, for the stated purpose of protecting the federal courthouse and other federal property from vandalism.</p>   <p>Recent protests have been far more muted and focused on the area around the ICE building, located outside the city's downtown that was the heart of the 2020 protests. The building's main entrance and ground-floor windows have been boarded up and tagged with graffiti.</p>   \n   <p>Some federal agents have been injured and several protesters have been charged with assault. Some demonstrators also say they've been injured. When protesters erected a guillotine earlier this month, the Department of Homeland Security described it as \"unhinged behavior.\"</p>   <p>Meantime, city groups and officials have sought to highlight the recovery of the downtown area since 2020.</p>   <p>This summer was reportedly the busiest for pedestrian traffic since before the coronavirus pandemic, and overall violent crime in Portland from January through June decreased by 17% this year compared to the same period in 2024, a recent report from the Major Cities Chiefs Association found. The downtown has seen a decrease in homeless tent encampments that defined the years immediately after the pandemic.</p>   \n   <p>Since the Sept. 10 assassination of conservative activist Charlie Kirk, Trump has escalated his efforts to confront what he calls the \"radical left,\" which he blames for the country's problems with political violence.</p>   <p>Trump, in comments Thursday in the Oval Office, suggested some kind of operation was in the works.</p>   <p>\"We're going to get out there and we're going to do a pretty big number on those people in Portland,\" he said, describing them as \"professional agitators and anarchists.\"</p>\n</div>"

    "body": "<div>\n      <p>Maryland Gov. Wes Moore has committed to being a bipartisan bridgebuilder. But he's also under pressure to redistrict the state's one GOP congressman out of his House seat.</p>   \n</div><div>\n    <p>ARI SHAPIRO, HOST: </p><p> Democratic Governor Wes Moore of Maryland campaigned on the slogan, leave no one behind. It references both his time in the military and his openness to working with both parties. Now, Moore is facing pressure to set aside bipartisanship. President Trump wants Republican states to break with tradition and redraw their voting lines before the midterm elections, and Democrats are pressing Moore to make a partisan countermove in deep blue Maryland. WAMU's Jenny Abamu talked with him about it.</p><p>JENNY ABAMU, BYLINE: When asked whether Governor Moore considers himself a progressive or moderate, he bucks at the idea of being labeled. Here he is in our one-on-one interview last week.</p><p>(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)</p><p>WES MOORE: What is the Democratic platform? What is the Republican platform? I don't know. I can tell you my beliefs. I can tell you what we're trying to do in Maryland.</p><p>ABAMU: Moore frequently reminds the public that he's not a career politician, having lived several lives, including as a soldier, investment banker, author and CEO of a philanthropic organization before winning the governorship in 2022. And he's worked with Republicans. Here's Ed Rothstein, a Republican who served as county commissioner in conservative Carroll County, Maryland. He serves in Moore's Cabinet as the secretary of the Department of Veterans and Military Families.</p><p>ED ROTHSTEIN: We speak the same language when it comes to loyalty, responsibility, respect, honor, personal courage. You know, these are not just words, but they're ways of life.</p><p>ABAMU: Now, Moore's promises of bipartisanship are being tested. As President Trump has criticized Baltimore and threatened to send the National Guard, Moore has pushed back. He denied Trump's claim that Moore praised him in private, tweeting, LOL, you keep telling yourself that.</p><p>Then there's a big question of redistricting. Trump's urging Republican states to redistrict to help the GOP hold Congress. States usually just redistrict early in each decade after the census. And while Moore didn't commit to doing it, he told me states can't get hung up on, quote, \"principle\" if Trump's rewriting the rules.</p><p>MOORE: I believe deeply that all options need to be on the table in the state of Maryland because if we are going to have specific states - Trump-picked states - saying we should have a process to decide, do we have fair maps, then you know what? So should Maryland.</p><p>ABAMU: Already, only one of Maryland's eight House seats is held by a Republican, so drawing new maps could leave Maryland with no Republicans in Congress even though they make up about 24% of the voters. Brigitta Mullican, the Montgomery County GOP treasurer and a Republican organizer, says the state already gerrymanders to silence Republican voices.</p><p>BRIGITTA MULLICAN: I'm not happy about it, but you know what? I personally can't change any of that. But very disappointing.</p><p>ABAMU: In 2022, the court struck down the Democratic legislature's map for extreme partisan gerrymandering, making it draw a new one then. Mullican wants all politicians to play fair.</p><p>MULLICAN: And, you know, they play games on both sides. And my thing is do the right thing. You know, I want our districts to be properly redistricted right, you know?</p><p>ABAMU: Many progressive voters, though, like to see their governor taking on the president. Here's activist Dee Clarkin (ph) from Montgomery County.</p><p>DEE CLARKIN: I mean, Trump is a bully, and Governor Moore seems to instinctively understand that, and he is pushing back appropriately. And I have been pleased with that so far.</p><p>ABAMU: Clarkin says she sees redistricting in Maryland as a necessary evil. And Democrats around the county are looking toward the midterms as a way to stop Trump's agenda, which would make it hard for Wes Moore's leave no one behind motto to survive.</p><p>For NPR News, I'm Jenny Abamu.</p><p>(SOUNDBITE OF COMMON & JOHN LEGEND SONG, \"THEY SAY\")</p>\n    <p>Copyright © 2025 NPR.

    "body": "<div>\n      <p>We examine the indictment of former FBI Director James Comey after President Trump called for several of his political enemies — including Comey — to be prosecuted.</p>   \n</div><div>\n    <p>SCOTT SIMON, HOST: </p><p> Justice, as in the U.S. Justice Department, can move swiftly. A week ago today, President Trump publicly called on the DOJ to prosecute his perceived political enemies, including the former FBI director James Comey. On Thursday, prosecutors followed through and secured a criminal indictment against James Comey for false statements and obstruction. NPR Justice correspondent Ryan Lucas joins us. Ryan, thanks so much for being with us.</p><p>RYAN LUCAS, BYLINE: Thanks for having me, Scott.</p><p>SIMON: What does the indictment allege?</p><p>LUCAS: Well, look, it's very much a bare-bones indictment. It's just a page and a half long, but it contains the two counts you mentioned - one for false statements, the other for obstruction of a congressional proceeding. Now, these charges stem from testimony that Comey gave to the Senate Judiciary Committee in September of 2020, so about five years ago. That hearing revolved around the FBI's investigation into Russia's interference in the 2016 election. The indictment says that Comey lied by denying that he had authorized someone at the FBI to leak information. That appears to be a reference to an exchange at that hearing between Comey and Texas Republican Ted Cruz. Cruz asked Comey whether he had authorized someone at the FBI to be an anonymous source in news reports. Comey gave only a brief reply. He told Cruz that he stood by the answer that he had given back in 2017, which was that he had not authorized any such leak.</p><p>SIMON: And what do you think we should make of the timing of this indictment, given what the president had said just a week ago?</p><p>LUCAS: I think the timing is a really important aspect here. You mentioned the demand the president made one week ago today, in essence instructing Attorney General Pam Bondi by name to investigate specific people he doesn't like. Trump named three people in that post to be prosecuted -  New York Attorney General Letitia James, California Democratic Senator Adam Schiff and James Comey.</p><p>Now, the case against Comey was being handled by the U.S. attorney's office in the Eastern District of Virginia. Last week, Trump pushed out the top federal prosecutor there, in part because that prosecutor had expressed doubts about the strength of the case against Comey. Trump then installed Lindsey Halligan to replace him. Halligan has no prosecutorial experience, but she did once serve as a personal attorney for Trump, and she had been working in the White House. Halligan then pushed through the indictment against Comey over the objections of career prosecutors in the U.S. attorney's office there, who also had concerns about the strength of the evidence in this case.</p><p>SIMON: Now that James Comey's been indicted, what did the president have to say?</p><p>LUCAS: Well, Trump was asked about it yesterday when he was leaving the White House. He was asked who would be next on his list of retribution. You can hear the helicopter in the background here, but here's a bit of what he said.</p><p>(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)</p><p>PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: It's not a list, but I think there'll be others. I mean, they're corrupt. These were corrupt, radical-left Democrats. 'Cause Comey essentially was a - he's worse than a Democrat.</p><p>LUCAS: Now, Trump has insulted Comey for years. He did it again yesterday. He called him a dirty cop. Now, after the indictment was made public, Comey also put out a video on Instagram. Here's a bit of what he said.</p><p>(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)</p><p>JAMES COMEY: My family and I have known for years that there are costs to standing up to Donald Trump, but we couldn't imagine ourselves living any other way. We will not live on our knees, and you shouldn't either.</p><p>LUCAS: Comey also declared his innocence, said he has confidence in the federal judicial system. And he said, let's have a trial.</p><p>SIMON: Finally, does this signal anything for the second Trump term?</p><p>LUCAS: Well, look, traditionally, the Justice Department has enjoyed independence from the White House, particularly when it comes to investigations and prosecutions, because you want to be sure that prosecutions and investigations aren't driven by and don't appear to be driven by politics. Here in just the past week, we have the president openly calling for the attorney general to go after people Trump doesn't like, including James Comey. Now Comey's been indicted. So for legal observers and Justice Department veterans, this sure looks like Trump using the Justice Department to enact the campaign of retribution that he promised.</p><p>SIMON: NPR's Ryan Lucas. Thanks so much.</p><p>LUCAS: Thank you.</p>\n    <p>Copyright © 2025 NPR.  All rights reserved.

And education researchers warn that two of those three proposals — from the White House and House Republicans — would impose steep cuts on some of the United States' most vulnerable students and disadvantaged school communities.</p>   <h3>The three proposals on the table</h3>   <p>First up, <a href=\"https://www.ed.gov/media/document/fy-2026-presidents-budget-request-110152.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">President Trump's proposed budget</a> would cut U.S. Department of Education funding by 15%. It would eliminate all funding ($1.3 billion) for English language learners and migrant students. It would also combine 18 funding streams — including help for rural schools, civics education, at-risk youth and students experiencing homelessness — and cut them from roughly $6.5 billion down to $2 billion.</p>   \n   <p>The White House has <a href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Fiscal-Year-2026-Discretionary-Budget-Request.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">defended this consolidation</a>, saying it \"requires fewer Federal staff and empowers States and districts to make spending decisions based on their needs.\"</p>   <p>The <a href=\"https://appropriations.house.gov/sites/evo-subsites/republicans-appropriations.house.gov/files/evo-media-document/fy26-labor-health-and-human-services-education-and-related-agencies-subcommittee-mark.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">second proposal, from House Republicans</a>, would push for even deeper K-12 cuts, notably a $4.7 billion reduction in funding that supports schools in low-income communities. This funding stream, known as Title I, has enjoyed bipartisan support for decades and currently sends roughly <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2025/03/21/nx-s1-5330917/trump-schools-education-department-cuts-low-income\" target=\"_blank\">$18 billion to schools</a> in disadvantaged communities all over the United States.</p>   <p>In a <a href=\"https://appropriations.house.gov/news/press-releases/committee-approves-fy26-labor-health-and-human-services-education-and-related\" target=\"_blank\">news release</a> heralding the legislation, the chairman of the House Appropriations Committee, Republican Tom Cole of Oklahoma, said, \"Change doesn't come from keeping the status quo—it comes from making bold, disciplined choices.\"</p>   <p>And the<strong> </strong><a href=\"https://www.appropriations.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/fy26_lhhs_bill_text.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">third proposal, from the Senate</a>, would make minor cuts but largely maintain funding.</p>   <p>A quick reminder: Federal funding makes up a relatively small share of school budgets, roughly 11%, though cuts in low-income districts can still be painful and disruptive.</p>   <h3>Schools in blue congressional districts could lose more money</h3>   <p>Researchers at the liberal-leaning think tank New America <a href=\"https://www.newamerica.org/education-policy/edcentral/congressional-districts-losing-the-most-k12-funding-under-trump-and-house-budgets/\" target=\"_blank\">wanted to know</a> how the impact of these proposals might vary depending on the politics of the congressional district receiving the money. They found that the Trump budget would subtract an average of about $35 million from each district's K-12 schools, with those led by Democrats losing slightly more than those led by Republicans.</p>   \n   <p>The House proposal would make deeper, more partisan cuts, with districts represented by Democrats losing an average of about $46 million and Republican-led districts losing about $36 million.</p>   <p>Republican leadership of the House Appropriations Committee, which is responsible for this budget proposal, did not respond to an NPR request for comment on this partisan divide.</p>   <p>\"In several cases, we've had to make some very hard choices,\" Rep. Robert Aderholt, R-Ala., a top Republican on the appropriations committee, said during the full-committee markup of the bill. \"Americans must make priorities as they sit around their kitchen tables about the resources they have within their family. And we should be doing the same thing.\"</p>   \n   <p>The Senate proposal is more moderate and would leave the status quo largely intact.</p>   <p>In addition to the work of New America, the liberal-leaning Learning Policy Institute created <a href=\"https://learningpolicyinstitute.org/blog/5-billion-federal-k-12-formula-funding-hangs-balance-between-white-house-and-senate-proposals\" target=\"_blank\">this tool</a> to compare the potential impact of the Senate bill with the president's proposal.</p>   <h3>High-poverty schools could lose more than low-poverty schools</h3>   <p>The Trump and House proposals would disproportionately hurt high-poverty school districts, according to an <a href=\"https://edtrust.org/rti/fy26-federal-funding-at-risk-for-americas-schools/\" target=\"_blank\">analysis by the liberal-leaning EdTrust</a>.</p>   \n   <p>In Kentucky, for example, EdTrust estimates that the president's budget could cost the state's highest-poverty school districts $359 per student, nearly three times what it would cost its wealthiest districts.</p>   <p>The cuts are even steeper in<strong> </strong>the House proposal: Kentucky's highest-poverty schools could lose $372 per student, while its lowest-poverty schools could lose $143 per child.</p>   <p>The Senate bill would cut far less: $37 per child in the state's highest-poverty school districts versus $12 per student in its lowest-poverty districts.</p>   <p>New America researchers arrived at similar conclusions when studying congressional districts.</p>   <p>\"The lowest-income congressional districts would lose one and a half times as much funding as the richest congressional districts under the Trump budget,\" says New America's Zahava Stadler.</p>   <p>The House proposal, Stadler says, would go further, imposing a cut the Trump budget does not on Title I.</p>   <p>\"The House budget does something new and scary,\" Stadler says, \"which is it openly targets funding for students in poverty. This is not something that we see <em>ever</em>.\"</p>   <p>Republican leaders of the House Appropriations Committee did not respond to NPR requests for comment on their proposal's outsize impact on low-income communities.</p>   <p>The Senate has proposed a modest increase to Title I for next year.</p>   <h3>Majority-minority schools could lose more than mostly white schools</h3>   <p>Just as the president's budget would hit high-poverty schools hard, New America found that it would also have an outsize impact on congressional districts where schools serve predominantly children of color. These districts would lose nearly twice as much funding as predominantly white districts, in what Stadler calls \"a huge, huge disparity<em>.\"</em></p>   \n   <p>One of several drivers of that disparity is the White House's decision to end all funding for English language learners and <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2018/08/29/640862283/in-one-generation-a-farmworker-family-grows-college-ambitions\" target=\"_blank\">migrant students</a>. In <a href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Fiscal-Year-2026-Discretionary-Budget-Request.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">one budget document</a>, the White House justified cutting the former by arguing the program \"deemphasizes English primacy. ... The historically low reading scores for all students mean States and communities need to unite—not divide—classrooms.\"</p>   <p>Under the House proposal, according to New America, congressional districts that serve predominantly white students would lose roughly $27 million on average, while districts with schools that serve mostly children of color would lose more than twice as much: nearly $58 million.</p>   \n   <p>EdTrust's data tool tells a similar story, state by state. For example, under the president's budget, Pennsylvania school districts that serve the most students of color would lose $413 per student. Districts that serve the fewest students of color would lose just $101 per child.</p>   <p>The findings were similar for the House proposal: a $499-per-student cut in Pennsylvania districts that serve the most students of color versus a $128 cut per child in predominantly white districts.</p>   <p>\"That was most surprising to me,\" says EdTrust's Ivy Morgan. \"Overall, the House proposal really is worse [than the Trump budget] for high-poverty districts, districts with high percentages of students of color, city and rural districts. And we were not expecting to see that.\"</p>   <p>The Trump and House proposals do share one common denominator: the belief that the federal government should be spending less on the nation's schools.</p>   <p>When Trump <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSbBNm5Pms0\" target=\"_blank\">pledged</a>, \"We're going to be returning education very simply back to the states where it belongs,\" that apparently included scaling back some of the federal role in funding schools, too.</p>   <p>The challenge for states, communities and families, if one of these budgets becomes a reality, will be filling that funding void, especially since the federal government has always focused its dollars on helping students and schools that need it the most.</p>\n</div>"

Ron, thanks so much for being with us.</p><p>RON ELVING, BYLINE: Good to be with you, Scott.</p><p>SIMON: How significant, do you believe, is this indictment?</p><p>ELVING: We're seeing the depth of resentment the president still seems to feel about the start of his first term. That was when Comey asserted the independence of the Justice Department, as Ryan Lucas was just telling us. You may recall how Trump suggested Comey could go easy on one of Trump's allies and early appointees. Comey pushed back, and the relationship soured quickly. Trump fired Comey, prompting many people to conclude that Trump did not understand that the DOJ was not his to order about like an in-house lawyer.</p><p>So in significance, this current indictment may say more about the Trump administration than it does about Comey. And while it may well be a personal and financial burden for the former FBI director, it is highly unlikely to lead to a conviction, and it may not even get to a trial. Now, we heard a chorus of the president's usual supporters in certain media coming out to call this indictment weak. Moreover, the prospect of a trial that brings out the facts about what Trump did and what Trump didn't do and what Comey did back 10 years ago is not likely to bathe the president in a flattering light.</p><p>SIMON: President Trump addressed the U.N. General Assembly earlier this week. Didn't hold back, did he?</p><p>ELVING: The president seemed genuinely annoyed by a bulky escalator that stopped just as he got on, and then by a teleprompter that malfunctioned. He also seemed upset about one of his companies losing out on a bid to renovate the U.N. building years ago. But of course, he also went well beyond the merely peevish and personal with his assault on other countries and their handling of immigration. Let's listen.</p><p>(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)</p><p>PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: It's time to end the failed experiment of open borders. You have to end it now. It's - I can tell you. I'm really good at this stuff. Your countries are going to hell.</p><p>ELVING: So on one hand, Trump seems to be bearding the United Nations lion right in its own den, but his real audience there may be far outside the U.N. itself. He knows that organization and other international entities are not popular with his own voters. They delight in hearing him disrespect the U.N. They believe the United States has been taken advantage of by the United Nations and many of its members, and they are glad to hear someone say so and insist on greater respect for the U.S.</p><p>SIMON: Ron, next week, can a government shutdown be averted? And if not, what might it look like?</p><p>ELVING: It's hard to see how they can avoid it now. Both sides at least seem to have decided to have the shutdown, Trump because he thinks it will empower him to do as he wishes and strengthen his standing with voters. Democrats seem resigned to a shutdown because anything more cooperative would make them look weak or, worse yet, make them look like enablers for Trump. So they've chosen to take a stand over health care spending. Now, Democrats could have shut the government down back in March. And some say they should have, that nothing was gained by going along. And that sentiment seems to be dominating right now in the opposition party.</p><p>SIMON: Politically, what implications do you think it has for both parties? Who'll get the blame if there is a shutdown?</p><p>ELVING: It's usually easier for the president to dominate the debate about a shutdown. The White House can speak with a single, authoritative voice. Meanwhile, the opposition consists of scores of different people and coalitions, and it can be nearly impossible to get all the Democrats on the same rhetorical program at the same time. That enables the president and his party to say, look, we gave this all the votes we had, but we don't have 60. And that's the magic number to cut off debate, so we need a few of you Democrats to come over and help us keep the government open.</p><p>It's easier for politicians to mischaracterize their opposition sometimes than it is to formulate a policy of their own that actually pleases swing voters. And this is happening at a time when many other issues are in the news and pulling voters in different directions, and distracting them makes it all the harder to explain a complex budget process.</p><p>SIMON: NPR's Ron Elving. Thanks so much.</p><p>ELVING: Thank you, Scott.</p>\n    <p>Copyright © 2025 NPR.  All rights reserved.

    "body": "<div>\n      <p>President Trump's most outspoken Republican critic on Capitol Hill is facing immense pressure to fold or pay the price. Now, Kentucky Congressman Thomas Massie is asking constituents to fight an effort to oust him.</p>   \n</div><div>\n    <p>SCOTT SIMON, HOST: </p><p> President Trump's most outspoken Republican critic on Capitol Hill is facing enormous pressure to fold or pay the price. And now Kentucky Congressman Thomas Massie, a 12-year incumbent, is asking his constituents to fight an effort to oust him.</p><p>(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)</p><p>THOMAS MASSIE: We need to have a second opinion on everything. Our founders set up a balance of government, and the balance of government is gone if you don't have a counterbalance within your own party.</p><p>SIMON: That's Representative Massie, joined by Kentucky Senator Rand Paul to rally voters during a blitz of campaign stops in their state. NPR congressional correspondent Claudia Grisales traveled to northern Kentucky, but she's here in our studios now. Claudia, thanks so much for being with us.</p><p>CLAUDIA GRISALES, BYLINE: Good to see you, Scott.</p><p>SIMON: Congressman Massie and Senator Paul, who has been another prominent Trump critic on many issues, visited more than half a dozen communities. What did you hear?</p><p>GRISALES: Visit after visit, they told constituents that President Trump is one of the best presidents of their lifetimes. But they argued they're also part of the same Republican Party, and there should be room for disagreement. Paul defended Massie, who is a longtime friend, as the last member of the Tea Party, fighting for conservative values. I asked Paul to expand on what that means.</p><p>RAND PAUL: There'll be no more Tea Party. It's about the idea of limited government. But I'm all in for Thomas Massie.</p><p>GRISALES: And we should note Trump has also taken aim at Paul, but he's not up for reelection until 2028. However, in Massie's case, his seat will be contested, like all House seats, in next year's midterms.</p><p>SIMON: Now, President Trump has repeatedly publicly attacked Massie and Paul for voting against his agenda. Why don't they fall in line like their colleagues?</p><p>GRISALES: Both Massie and Paul are cut from the same kind of Tea Party, libertarian cloth, which is a contrast from the president - especially at this moment, when the Republican-led Congress has shown great fealty to the president. So they're often on the opposite ends of the president when it comes to spending, tariffs, the First Amendment. And in Massie's case, he's leading a charge to force the release of the Jeffrey Epstein records. And both are also playing to this independent, maverick Kentucky political brand and state of mind.</p><p>SIMON: How did you see constituents receive Massie and Paul's messages?</p><p>GRISALES: I saw a whole range of reactions. Some were very loyal to Massie and Paul. Others were saying they've gone too far or that Trump has gone too far. I talked to one couple who showed up to an event wearing T-shirts that read, I stand with Thomas Massie.</p><p>I talked to Diane Olberding. She voted for Trump in the last election, and she feels betrayed.</p><p>DIANE OLBERDING: These two guys here don't change their convictions. You know, talk is cheap, and we all know Mr. - President Trump loves to talk. But he needs to continue what he was voted in on - MAGA.</p><p>SIMON: Now, of course, President Trump has won Kentucky three elections in a row by double-digit margins. In fact, his highest percentage was in 2024. How big of a challenge could Massie face in his reelection campaign?</p><p>GRISALES: Well, it's unusual to launch a campaign for a congressional seat more than a year out this aggressively and with this level of spending, all for a primary race in a solidly red district. Massie thinks it's the most ever spent on a congressional race this early on. And the war chest amassed against him, which has been fueled by the president - Massie says it's raised millions. He also has repeatedly referenced these television ads that are already airing in those markets, accusing Massie of flag burning, which he said was a complete lie. But we should note Massie ran unopposed in 2024, so it will be hard to find a candidate who will be strong enough and have that kind of name ID to turn away voters from Massie.</p><p>SIMON: NPR's Claudia Grisales, thanks so much.</p><p>GRISALES: Thank you.</p><p>(SOUNDBITE OF ROB LEVIT'S \"THE TRAVELER\")</p><p>SIMON: This is NPR News.</p>\n    <p>Copyright © 2025 NPR.

Some wore suits, others high heels, and nearly all carried small binders with resumes, certificates and diplomas.</p>   <p>They were veterans, current law enforcement officials, college graduates and fired federal workers.</p>   <p>They came from California, Texas, Georgia, Arkansas and Utah.</p>   <p>And they want to be deportation officers, or work for other parts of the Department of Homeland Security, the agency leading President Trump's mass deportation policy.</p>   <p>The Trump administration wants to recruit 10,000 people for Immigration and Customs Enforcement, a branch of DHS, using congressional funds approved this summer. The administration's goal is to deport 1 million people a year. But that target is unlikely to be easy to hit: The lack of personnel to conduct arrests, investigate and litigate cases has been among the biggest challenges to increasing the pace of arrests, detentions and deportations.</p>   \n   <p>NPR spoke with more than 30 people at the DHS career expo held in Provo last week. This was the first agencywide career fair after Congress approved funds to recruit candidates for positions beyond immigration enforcement, including for the Secret Service, Federal Protective Police and the Transportation Security Administration, which like ICE are all part of DHS. Interviews conducted by NPR suggest many of the people who had traveled across state lines to Utah wanted to work in immigration enforcement.</p>   <p>More than 1,500 people registered for the event, DHS Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin told NPR in a statement. DHS extended 500 tentative job offers, with 370 for ICE Enforcement and Removal Operations.</p>   <p>\"Many of the candidates who attended the expo had started the application process before attending and were completing things on their to-do list, such as drug tests, finger printing, and more,\" McLaughlin said. \"Attending the in-person career expo helped candidates expedite their hiring process with a one-stop shop to complete their applications.\"</p>   <p>ICE had <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2025/02/05/nx-s1-5259788/homeland-security-immigration-trump-workforce\" target=\"_blank\">about 20,000 people</a> at the start of the year, 6,000 of them in roles directly conducting deportations. Last week, <a href=\"https://www.dhs.gov/news/2025/09/16/ice-receives-more-150000-applications-join-ice-law-enforcement-help-remove-worst\" target=\"_blank\">ICE boasted receiving </a>more than 150,000 applications nationwide and extending 18,000 tentative job offers, though it is unclear how many will ultimately see a first day on the job.</p>   \n   <p>DHS officials have raised concerns over what they said is a 1,000% increase in threats to their officers. Officials reiterated that statistic after a <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2025/09/24/nx-s1-5552151/ice-dallas-detention-facility-shooting\" target=\"_blank\">fatal shooting at the Dallas ICE field</a> office this week killed one person and injured two others — all immigrants detained there — and bullets were found with the words \"ANTI-ICE.\"</p>   <p>Acting Director Todd Lyons <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2025/09/24/us/video/ice-director-dallas-shooting-cnc-digvid\" target=\"_blank\">told CNN after the shooting</a> that the threats have not negatively affected recruitment efforts.</p>   <p>\"There's really excitement for people that want to serve, not just necessarily ICE but want to serve in a federal law enforcement capacity, especially at a time when assaults and attacks on law enforcement are increasing,\" Lyons said. \"We are seeing a great uptick in our recruitment, so people definitely want to do the job.\"</p>   <h3>The recruits</h3>   <p>As part of its recruitment campaign, DHS offered signing bonuses, <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2025/08/07/nx-s1-5494724/ice-is-recruiting-federal-workers-offering-bonuses-to-hire-thousands-of-workers\" target=\"_blank\">lifted age restrictions</a> and roped in celebrities like <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2025/08/07/nx-s1-5495436/superman-tv-actor-dean-cain-joins-ice-recruit-immigration\" target=\"_blank\">actor Dean Cain, who played Clark Kent/Superman in <em>Lois and Clark</em></a>, to encourage more people to apply.</p>   <p>Ana Maria Vargas, 52, a correctional officer in Arizona, applied to be a deportation officer.</p>   \n   <p>\"I saw … the guy that played Superman on the TV series so many years ago,\" Vargas said. \"A lot of us still have the desire and want to serve our country, yet we don't know how to get into it because of the age restrictions.\"</p>   <p>Vargas said she wants to \"take out the bad guys,\" though she acknowledged \"there are a lot of good people that are here. However, they are here illegally.\"</p>   <p>Andrea Alexander, an attorney living in Utah, came to apply for the Office of the Principal Legal Advisor, the branch of ICE that argues immigration cases in immigration court. She learned of ICE's recruitment efforts from White House Deputy Chief of Staff Stephen Miller's social media.</p>   <p>\"I love Trump. I love his administration. I think he's going to save our country,\" Alexander said, adding that those applying to be deportation officers should likely believe in the mission as well. \"They probably have to be true believers for the front line because they have to be ready to catch a lot of flak right now.\"</p>   \n   <p>Still, Alexander said she wanted to see efforts to increase legal migration and visa reform.</p>   <p>\"We've made it almost impossible for people to immigrate legally. It's very difficult and they should be able to come over,\" she added.</p>   <p>Another applicant, Peter, who did not want to disclose his last name since he is applying to be a deportation officer, flew to Utah from Arkansas.</p>   <p>He said he was on the right of the political spectrum and that the hiring bonuses and increased media attention on the agency drew his attention.</p>   <p>\"I think there's way too many illegal immigrants here,\" he said, noting that if he gets the job, he hopes he gets to deport people. </p>   <h3>Former federal employees seek a second chance</h3>   <p>Sherrell Pyatt was one of several DHS employees laid off as part of a broader effort to reduce the size of the federal government. <a href=\"http://google.com/search?q=Sherrell+Pyatt+npr&rlz=1C1GCFQ_enUS1132US1132&oq=Sherrell+Pyatt+npr&gs_lcrp=EgZjaHJvbWUyBggAEEUYOTIKCAEQABiiBBiJBTIKCAIQABiiBBiJBTIHCAMQABjvBTIKCAQQABiABBiiBNIBCDIyMDVqMGo5qAIFsAIB8QUxiCo-BAwJwA&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8\" target=\"_blank\">NPR reported her story in April</a>. But months later, she flew from Georgia to Utah with the hopes of being rehired at the agency that let her go.</p>   <p><strong>\"</strong>I want to be judged on my qualifications, my credentials, and I don't feel like I've been given that opportunity,\" Pyatt said, noting that her severance had ended in August.</p>   <p>She wanted to apply for a role with the fraud investigations unit of U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services. After working in the federal government for 10 years, Pyatt said that she wants to continue her service and believes she should have priority to be rehired, since she was a part of a reduction in force, but is competing with external candidates.</p>   <div>\n            <div>\n        <picture>\n            <source srcset=\"https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/7659x5106+0+0/resize/400/quality/85/format/webp/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fcc%2F46%2F53f325de4fc593cd94600fa8b559%2Fgettyimages-2235696135.jpg 400w, https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/7659x5106+0+0/resize/600/quality/85/format/webp/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fcc%2F46%2F53f325de4fc593cd94600fa8b559%2Fgettyimages-2235696135.jpg 600w, https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/7659x5106+0+0/resize/800/quality/85/format/webp/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fcc%2F46%2F53f325de4fc593cd94600fa8b559%2Fgettyimages-2235696135.jpg 800w, https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/7659x5106+0+0/resize/900/quality/85/format/webp/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fcc%2F46%2F53f325de4fc593cd94600fa8b559%2Fgettyimages-2235696135.jpg 900w, https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/7659x5106+0+0/resize/1200/quality/85/format/webp/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fcc%2F46%2F53f325de4fc593cd94600fa8b559%2Fgettyimages-2235696135.jpg 1200w, https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/7659x5106+0+0/resize/1600/quality/85/format/webp/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fcc%2F46%2F53f325de4fc593cd94600fa8b559%2Fgettyimages-2235696135.jpg 1600w, https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/7659x5106+0+0/resize/1800/quality/85/format/webp/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fcc%2F46%2F53f325de4fc593cd94600fa8b559%2Fgettyimages-2235696135.jpg 1800w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1025px) 650px, calc(100vw -

So I firsthand see the benefits of it,\" he said.</p>   <h3>Concerns over DHS' widespread recruitment comes from all sides</h3>   <p>The numbers at the recruitment events notwithstanding, ICE's recruitment strategies have not all been well received.</p>   <p>Utah County Sheriff Mike Smith, who has an agreement to assist ICE in the Provo area, called an initial call to recruit local law enforcement \"unprofessional\" in an interview with NPR. The recruitment fair in Provo, as well as an <a href=\"https://www.texasstandard.org/stories/immigration-customs-enforcement-recruitment-event-ice-arlington-texas/\" target=\"_blank\">ICE-specific fair in Texas</a>, were met with scattered protests.</p>   <p>RJ Hauman, a visiting fellow at the conservative Heritage Foundation, said he supports the administration's immigration enforcement goals, but said he is skeptical about the recruitment campaign.</p>   \n   <p>\"When you're recruiting large numbers of qualified candidates, you got to consider how you get them to the finish line,\" Hauman said. \"Rather than doing ads that ICE is hiring, all these on-site job fairs, let's start hammering out more facilities to train these potential agents and streamline the vetting, the background check, make sure you get the right people and you don't make a mistake.\"</p>   <p>Critics say the modification of requirements, including a reduced training period, could result in hiring candidates with less experience. <a href=\"https://www.dhs.gov/news/2025/08/06/secretary-noem-unveils-no-age-limit-patriotic-americans-join-ice-law-enforcement\" target=\"_blank\">The agency</a> insists standards aren't being lowered: ICE law enforcement recruits will still be required to go through medical screening, drug screening and a physical fitness test. </p>   <h3>Just another job</h3>   <p>ICE's enforcement efforts have made the agency the focus of negative attention, protests and lawsuits. But like for many who work in the federal government, the politics of the moments are irrelevant.</p>   \n   <p>John Heubert, who expects to retire from the Army next summer, came from Georgia to apply to be a deportation officer.</p>   <p>\"I feel like I could do good in that realm. I've been military for 23 years. I've worked in detainee operations for a long time,\" Heubert said. \"So I feel like leveraging my skills, and deployments, and everything would help kind of transition me easier into the civilian life, doing kind of the same thing I've been doing.\"</p>   <p>He said everything has been politicized, so the controversy surrounding the agency did not deter him.</p>   <p>\"I'm the guy that just executes at this point. So whatever they want, they tell me to do it, I go do,\" Heubert said.</p>   <p>Alan Richardson, who came to the expo from Utah, is another veteran. He learned of the expo from a friend's post on LinkedIn.</p>   <p>\"I want to go back into federal service … and retire earlier than have to start a whole another career with a state or county agency,\" he said, noting he is interested in Border Patrol, Secret Service and ICE.</p>   <p>\"As a law enforcement officer, you don't get to pick and choose which laws to enforce. You enforce them as they are on the books,\" Heubert said. \"There is no politics behind it. If you want to change laws, you have to go to Congress. That's simply all it is.\"</p>   <p>Richardson said that he supports the effort to arrest and deport criminals.</p>   <p>\"If your employer says you have to do something, you've got to go do it. That's any business in the country. Everyone can have an opinion,\" Richardson said. \"But I think going after the criminals is the goal here. There's no way you're going to deport how many millions of people that are here illegally.\"</p>   <p>Eric Garibay, an immigration detention officer, said he drove over 12 hours from El Paso, Texas, to attend the fair. Speaking to NPR in Spanish, he said it has always been his goal to be a Border Patrol agent.</p>   \n   <p>\"It's a job and a career that I chose, so you have to move forward,\" he said.</p>   <p>As for the people he'd be detaining, he said: \"It hurts to see. They're human, but a job is a job.\"</p>\n</div>"

In the case of TikTok, the administration is seeking a fee for service. With Intel, the federal government is acquiring an equity stake. For chipmakers Nvidia and AMD, meanwhile, the demand was for a slice of future profits. And with the network television settlements, the payouts arose after personal legal disputes.</p>   \n   <p>\"There is no consistent principle at play, just the exercise of Trump's personal power over other people's money,\" said Dael Norwood, associate professor of history at the University of Delaware, who notes that the winners and losers are clear.</p>   <p>\"All Americans — taxpayers, investors, customers, and workers — lose with crony capitalism,\" he said. \"It increases everyone's costs, makes everyone more vulnerable to extortion (or worse), and profoundly degrades our expectations for honesty and fair dealing, society-wide.\"</p>   <p>In public, corporate executives show support to the president and appear to back such deals, but behind closed doors, <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2025/08/14/nx-s1-5501591/trump-corporate-america-capitalism\" target=\"_blank\">some business leaders are expressing deep concern</a>.</p>   \n   <p>Yale School of Management professor Jeffrey Sonnenfeld recently helped organize a gathering of more than 100 top CEOs, and he said there was near-unanimous consensus in surveys conducted at the event that Trump's interventions in private business are undermining America's free market principles.</p>   <p>\"These are shakedown schemes. It's a gross violation of what capitalism is supposed to stand for. I'd even call it extortion,\" Sonnenfeld said. \"Privately, CEOs are horrified.\"</p>   <p>But Sonnenfeld said executives are not banding together to push back on Trump, as top business leaders <a href=\"https://insights.som.yale.edu/insights/ceos-urge-respect-for-election-integrity\" target=\"_blank\">did</a> following Trump's election denialism in November 2020.</p>   <p>\"CEOs need to speak up, like they did then, but they aren't doing it publicly,\" Sonnenfeld said. \"Fear of retaliation is motivating the silence, but there has got to be a trigger line to stop this. We just don't know what that is yet.\"</p>   <p>Talks with American investors for a potential acquisition of TikTok's U.S. enterprise have been moving in fits and starts for the past five years, starting back when the Trump administration <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2020/09/26/917134452/new-doj-filing-tiktoks-owner-is-a-mouthpiece-of-chinese-communist-party\" target=\"_blank\">declared</a> the Chinese-owned hit video app to be a national security threat and sought to have it banned.</p>   <p>Since Trump's about-face and embrace of TikTok, it has been clear that software and cloud-computing company Oracle would be a major player in the bid to take over the app's American presence.</p>   \n   <p>Oracle co-founder Larry Ellison is a close confidante of Trump and the president has said both publicly and in private that he'd like to see TikTok controlled by Oracle.</p>   <p>According to the source with direct knowledge of the talks, many of the deal's provisions have been under discussion for months, including that Oracle will host and oversee all of Americans' TikTok data. Beijing-based ByteDance <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2025/04/02/nx-s1-5349592/tiktok-oracle-trump-china-deal\" target=\"_blank\">will license</a> its algorithm to the U.S. entity to be retrained based only on the 170 million U.S. users of the app and ByteDance will keep a minority stake in the company.</p>   <p>The one part of the agreement that caught investors by surprise? The multibillion-dollar fee request.</p>   <p>\"They were taken aback when they were told they'd have to kick in,\" the source said. \"But I think they see it as just the price of doing business right now.\"</p>\n</div>"

    "body": "<div>\n      <p>The government is just days away from shutting down if Congress can't reach a deal. President Trump upped the stakes, threatening large-scale layoffs if Democrats don't provide the necessary votes.</p>   \n</div><div>\n    <p>STEVE INSKEEP, HOST: </p><p> We are four days away from a government shutdown.</p><p>A MARTÍNEZ, HOST: </p><p> And a memo from the White House promises to punish federal workers if that happens. The Trump administration is threatening large-scale layoffs if Democrats don't provide the necessary votes to avoid a shutdown. We don't know exactly which jobs would be targeted or how many federal workers could lose their jobs, but the deadline to come up with a solution is fast approaching.</p><p>INSKEEP: And NPR congressional correspondent Barbara Sprunt will be covering whatever happens. Barbara, good morning.</p><p>BARBARA SPRUNT, BYLINE: Hey. Good morning, Steve.</p><p>INSKEEP: OK. So this is kind of a departure from the normal shutdown scenario where the government says, we're going to increase the pain. What prompted this?</p><p>SPRUNT: Well, there's a line in the memo that I think is telling here, essentially saying, we're hopeful that Democrats in Congress don't trigger a shutdown, and then this won't be necessary. So I think this is partly aimed at making any funding lapse as difficult as possible for Democrats.</p><p>INSKEEP: Got it.</p><p>SPRUNT: Normally in a shutdown, you know, agencies furlough federal workers temporarily until a deal is brokered and a stopgap funding bill is passed. This is next-level. It's instructing agencies to look for workers to fire permanently, people whose work is not consistent with the president's priorities.</p><p>INSKEEP: How are Democrats responding?</p><p>SPRUNT: Well, they view it as an intimidation tactic to get them to accept the continuing resolution that House Republicans passed that would fund the government through November 21. I spoke with Maryland Senator Chris Van Hollen, a Democrat, about this yesterday. Here's what he had to say.</p><p>CHRIS VAN HOLLEN: This is nothing less than Mafia-style blackmail. Essentially, the president is threatening to fire dedicated federal employees who have nothing to do with the ongoing political and policy dispute.</p><p>SPRUNT: Meanwhile, Senate minority leader Chuck Schumer says that if these firings do go forward, he suspects they'll eventually be overturned in court.</p><p>INSKEEP: Although we've learned when the president fires someone, even if a court finds illegality, it's difficult to reverse the firing, so we'll see. Is anybody talking about getting a deal out of this?</p><p>SPRUNT: Well, top congressional Democrats were supposed to meet with President Trump yesterday at the White House, but the president canceled that meeting, saying it would be pointless to meet because Democrats, in his view, are making unreasonable demands.</p><p>INSKEEP: Which are what?</p><p>SPRUNT: Well, Democrats want to roll back some Medicaid changes that were part of the big tax and spending bill that the president signed earlier this summer, and they want to extend tax credits from the Affordable Care Act that are set to expire at the end of the year. House Democratic leader Hakeem Jeffries has said a verbal agreement that comes in any sort of negotiation isn't enough. Democrats want to address these issues in written legislation. Here he is yesterday.</p><p>(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)</p><p>HAKEEM JEFFRIES: We're able to sit down any time, any place with anyone, not hard to find. I'm here in the Capitol, willing to go to the White House at any time in order to have that conversation.</p><p>SPRUNT: But, you know, Steve, yes, this is about the shutdown. It's a very real possibility, and it would have very real consequences for people who rely on certain services and workers who might find themselves without a job permanently. But this is also about an ongoing conflict between the White House and Democrats in Congress who feel the administration has continued to overreach in its authority and diminish the legislative branch's power of the purse. So yes, this memo is unprecedented, but it also very much follows the administration's philosophy that we've seen play out again and again this year.</p><p>INSKEEP: Well, Barbara, I hope you're ready for a busy few days here.</p><p>SPRUNT: Looking forward to it.
