Joe Flacco will be under center for Cleveland, and the 40-year-old has lost three straight starts to Cincinnati. Meanwhile, Joe Burrow led the league in both passing yards (4,918) and passing touchdowns (43) a year ago as he became the third player in NFL history to have at least 4,500 yards, 40 touchdowns and fewer than 10 interceptions. After signing both Ja'Marr Chase and Tee Higgins to extensions this offseason, the league's No. 1 passing offense from a year ago returns intact.</p><p>Cincy's passing game, alone, may put more points on the game than Cleveland, which ranked dead-last in scoring in 2024. Cleveland struggled in all facets, with the last-ranked third-down offense, committing the second-most turnovers, and having bottom-five rankings in both rushing offense and redzone scoring. Plus, the Browns' defense slipped considerably from the unit which led the NFL in yards allowed in 2023 as Cleveland ranked 27th in points allowed in 2024. The model projects Cincy (-5.5) to win by more than a touchdown and cover well over 50% of the time. <a href=\"https://www.sportsline.com/insiders/nfl-odds-lines-spreads-2025-week-1-picks-predictions-from-proven-model/#ttag=07102025_agg_cbssports_picks_football_nfl_model_Week1NFLodds\" target=\"_blank\">See which other teams to pick here</a>.</p>\n<p>Another one of its Week 1 NFL predictions: the Packers (-2.5, 47.5), fresh off acquiring Micah Parsons, cover at home versus the Lions. The line has moved one point in favor of Green Bay since the Parsons trade news broke The <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/WAS/washington-commanders/\">Commanders</a> may have revealed the blueprint to exploiting Detroit, courtesy of Washington's road playoff win last season. Jared Goff was often pressured, which led to him turning the ball over four times, and few teams apply pressure or create takeaways quite like Green Bay. It ranked fourth in turnovers created a year ago, and just seven teams racked up more sacks, despite the Packers blitzing at the second-lowest rate in the league.</p><p>One also can't forget the offseason attrition for Detroit, which lost both of its coordinators, as well as three-time All-Pro center Frank Ragnow. The Packers, meanwhile, added the one thing it was missing in a No. 1 wideout by drafting Matthew Golden in the first round. The model projects him to make an immediate impact by leading the Packers in receiving in Week 1, while Green Bay's defense has both more sacks and more takeaways than Detroit on defense. With that, the Packers (-2.5) cover nearly 60% of the time, with the Over (47.5) hitting in well over 50% of simulations. <a href=\"https://www.sportsline.com/insiders/nfl-odds-lines-spreads-2025-week-1-picks-predictions-from-proven-model/#ttag=07102025_agg_cbssports_picks_football_nfl_model_Week1NFLodds\" target=\"_blank\">See which other teams to pick here</a>.</p>\n<h3>How to make Week 1 NFL picks</h3><p>The model has also made the call on who wins and covers in every other game on the Week 1 NFL schedule and just revealed three underdogs that outright win, potentially giving you a huge payday. <a href=\"https://www.sportsline.com/insiders/nfl-odds-lines-spreads-2025-week-1-picks-predictions-from-proven-model/#ttag=07102025_agg_cbssports_picks_football_nfl_model_Week1NFLodds\" target=\"_blank\">You can only get every pick for every game at SportsLine</a>.</p><p><strong>So what NFL picks can you make with confidence, and which three teams should you lock in now?

    "body": "<div>\n<p>On Labor Day, first-year <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/DAL/dallas-cowboys/\">Dallas Cowboys</a> head coach Brian Schottenheimer gathered his players. With just three days remaining until his team's season opener against the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/PHI/philadelphia-eagles/\">Philadelphia Eagles</a>, the coach, as he recalled, gave a fiery and excited speech about playing the reigning <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://cbssports.com/nfl/superbowl/\">Super Bowl</a> champions in primetime on Thursday in the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://cbssports.com/nfl/\">NFL</a> Kickoff Game.</p><p>He immediately regretted it.</p><p>\"I went to bed that night,\" Schottenheimer recalled Tuesday. \"I was like, 'What are you doing? You know better than that.' Every game we play is just another championship opportunity. It's just another championship opportunity. We get a chance to go out there against the Eagles. You don't get extra credit for beating the Eagles in Philly on primetime than you do for beating the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/NYG/new-york-giants/\">Giants</a> at noon in AT&amp;T Stadium.\"</p><p>While what Schottenheimer said is technically true, the numbers say that no <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://cbssports.com/nfl/teams/\">NFL team</a> can benefit more from a victory in Week 1 than Dallas.</p>\n<p>The SportsLine Projection Model, which simulates every NFL game 10,000 times and went 31-15 on top-rated picks in 2024, has already crunched the numbers on the 2025 season. According to the model, the Cowboys, who went 7-10 a year ago and missed the playoffs, enter the season with a 17.9% chance of making the playoffs. However if Dallas, which is a 8.5-point underdog against Philadelphia, can pull off an upset against the champs, the Cowboys' chances of making the postseason would jump to 28.5%. That's the biggest leap any team in the league could make, based on the model's projections.</p><table><tbody><tr><td><br /></td><td>CHANCES OF MAKING THE PLAYOFFS</td><td><br /></td><td><br /></td></tr><tr><td>TEAM</td><td>CURRENT</td><td>AFTER WIN</td><td>DIFFERENCE</td></tr><tr><td>Dallas Cowboys</td><td>17.9%</td><td>28.5%</td><td>10.6%</td></tr><tr><td>Atlanta Falcons</td><td>17.0%</td><td>27.1%</td><td>10.1%</td></tr><tr><td>San Francisco 49ers</td><td>62.0%</td><td>72.1%</td><td>10.1%</td></tr><tr><td>New York Jets</td><td>18.9%</td><td>28.5%</td><td>9.6%</td></tr><tr><td>Miami Dolphins</td><td>36.4%</td><td>45.7%</td><td>9.3%</td></tr></tbody></table><p>By contrast, the model does not think a win by the Eagles would affect their playoff chances significantly. Philadelphia already has a 91.0% chance to reach the postseason, and that number would move to 91.9% with a victory over Dallas. The 0.9% differential is tied for the lowest of any team in Week 1.</p><p>In short, the Cowboys have significantly more to gain on Thursday night than the Eagles do.</p><p>Of course Dallas has a tall task against the defending champs. Philadelphia has won the last 14 games started and finished by quarterback <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/2240246/jalen-hurts/\">Jalen Hurts</a>, including the playoffs. Last season, the Eagles blew out the Cowboys twice, 34-6 and 41-7. </p><p>Philadelphia running back <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/2185957/saquon-barkley/\">Saquon Barkley</a> is coming off a season in which he led the league in rushing (2,005 yards) while running for 13 touchdowns. On Thursday, he will face a Dallas defense that allowed 137.1 rushing yards per game last season, the fourth most in the NFL.</p><p>But Schottenheimer doesn't want his players to put more emphasis on this game than any other.</p><p>\"What I don't these guys to do, and I think the coaches are a big part of this, is go in there and try so hard,\" he said. \"'We're playing the Eagles. I'm going to do so hard.' They're going to make mistakes if they do that. Play free. It's football. Fly around. Love be around your brothers. Just run to the football. Celebrate. Have fun.\"</p>\n            </div>"

    "body": "<div>\n        <p>The season isn't quite over yet. I have your attention still. Whatever is left for you to wring out of the waiver wire is well spoken for already, so how about a change of pace? Let's start talking 2026. </p><p>And let's do it in the most reckless way imaginable, by predicting a bunch of things that ... eh, probably won't be correct. </p><p>But they'll at least be <em>directionally</em> correct. I'm exaggerating to drive home a point, in other words, but with the important caveat that the exaggeration is at least within the realm of possibility. That's what makes for a <strong>bold</strong> prediction, and that's the most enjoyable kind of prediction this far out. </p><p>You wanna get nuts? Let's get nuts! </p><h2> \t<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/players/29426033/nick-kurtz/fantasy/\">Nick Kurtz</a> is the top first baseman drafted and <em>still</em> goes too low </h2><p>This one won't seem so bold by the time we're actually drafting, but sitting here in early September, it may not have occurred to you just how well the rookie rates at one of the most star-studded positions. Kurtz is a distant No. 1 in Head-to-Head points per game and is No. 1 outright in Rotisserie since reaching the majors on April 23 --  and that's in spite of a miserable first month in which he hit .208 with a .558 OPS. We've seen high draft picks with collegiate experience steamroll the minors only to meet with a harsh dose of reality upon reaching the majors (looking at you, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/players/29153543/wyatt-langford/fantasy/\">Wyatt Langford</a>), but Kurtz has thrived in a way that seems almost effortless. Detractors will point to his high strikeout rate and say correction is coming to his batting average, but I think the correction will be to the strikeout rate itself, making Kurtz a possible Triple Crown threat. </p>\n<h2> \t<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/players/2507333/shane-bieber/fantasy/\">Shane Bieber</a> places in the top five in Cy Young voting </h2><p>Part of me wants to say top three, but since I'm already penciling <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/players/3126008/tarik-skubal/fantasy/\">Tarik Skubal</a> and <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/players/2836763/garrett-crochet/fantasy/\">Garrett Crochet</a> into two of those spots, I want to leave myself a little wiggle room. Top five should be <strong>bold</strong> enough for a pitcher in his first full year back from Tommy John surgery, particularly one who only had a 3.80 ERA in his last meaningful sample. It's the meaningless sample in between that has me so bullish. That 3.80 ERA led to Bieber working with Driveline Baseball prior to 2024 to regain some of the velocity he had lost since winning a Cy Young in 2020, and it seemed to translate, seeing him strike out 20 in 12 innings prior to succumbing to Tommy John surgery. The velocity bump has held post-surgery, and the results have been sparkling as well. Bieber will be on an expiring contract for the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/teams/TOR/toronto-blue-jays/\">Blue Jays</a> in 2026, so I doubt they'd blink at him taking on a full workload, even so soon after surgery. </p><h2> The <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/teams/BAL/baltimore-orioles/\">Orioles</a> reach the postseason </h2><p>Despite being one of the most disappointing teams this year, the Orioles still have ample reason for optimism, beginning with their strong offensive nucleus. <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/players/3152104/gunnar-henderson/fantasy/\">Gunnar Henderson</a>, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/players/3117469/adley-rutschman/fantasy/\">Adley Rutschman</a>, and <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/players/28920005/jackson-holliday/fantasy/\">Jackson Holliday</a> all endured some growing pains while <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/players/26615346/jordan-westburg/fantasy/\">Jordan Westburg</a> struggled to stay on the field, but I don't think anyone is counting them out from reaching their full offensive potential. And now <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/players/26912463/samuel-basallo/fantasy/\">Samuel Basallo</a> and <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/players/29075533/dylan-beavers/fantasy/\">Dylan Beavers</a> are part of the equation. I would have said coming into the year that the Orioles didn't have the pitching to compete, but they've since seen <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/players/2835065/trevor-rogers/fantasy/\">Trevor Rogers</a> return to form and <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/players/2932284/kyle-bradish/fantasy/\">Kyle Bradish</a> return to health. They'll presumably go hard after a front-line starter in the offseason, having been humbled by this lost season. </p><h2> And so do the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/teams/ATL/atlanta-braves/\">Braves</a> </h2><p>Unlike the Orioles, the Braves had all the pitching they needed at the start of the year, but were operating with four automatic outs in their lineup. They knowingly punted at shortstop with <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/players/2836533/nick-allen/fantasy/\">Nick Allen</a>, but then had to replace a suspended <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/players/1796123/jurickson-profar/fantasy/\">Jurickson Profar</a> with table scraps while <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/players/3167984/michael-harris/fantasy/\">Michael Harris</a> and <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/players/2167464/ozzie-albies/fantasy/\">Ozzie Albies</a> fought through debilitating slumps. The second half has shown what their offense can be with everyone up to their usual form -- and that was true even before they replaced Allen with <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/players/26608279/ha-seong-kim/fantasy/\">Ha-seong Kim</a>. Unfortunately, by the time the offense got going, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/players/1762602/chris-sale/fantasy/\">Chris Sale</a>, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/players/26911687/spencer-schwellenbach/fantasy/\">Spencer Schwellenbach</a>, and <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/players/2135253/grant-holmes/fantasy/\">Grant Holmes</a> were lost to injury. Sale has since returned, and Schwellenbach should be fine for 2026. How much the Braves get from <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/players/2837573/spencer-strider/fantasy/\">Spencer Strider</a> and <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/players/2165932/reynaldo-lopez/fantasy/\">Reynaldo Lopez</a> moving forward is anybody's guess, but I think, like the Orioles, they'll look to add an arm in the offseason, having more funds to work with after resetting their luxury tax penalty this year. </p>\n<h2> Ozzie Albies bounces back as a top five second baseman </h2><p>Here's one of the many ways 2026 figures to be better than 2025 for the Braves. Ozzie Albies was one of their four automatic outs in the first half, going that whole time without a single homer from the right side of the plate. Historically, he's only needed to tread water from the left side. It's his dominance from the right side that would bring his numbers in line. Seeing his platoon splits that far out of whack makes me more hopeful it's something he can correct, like a mechanical flaw, when before I worried he may be a casualty of a shifting league environment. Already, we're seeing evidence of that with his two homers from the right side in the second half. Hitting coach Tim Hyers has also suggested that Albies was <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/athletic/6583330/2025/08/28/braves-hitting-coach-tim-hyers-progress/\" target=\"_blank\">still afflicted by last year's fractured wrist</a> until recently, offering more reason to believe that his sudden turnaround is a more permanent return to form. </p><h2> \t<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/players/3077711/noelvi-marte/fantasy/\">Noelvi Marte</a> has more Head-to-Head points than <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/players/26912505/elly-de-la-cruz/fantasy/\">Elly De La Cruz</a> </h2><p>Go <strong>bold</strong> or go home, right? This isn't meant as a knock on De La Cruz, who's still firmly part of the first-round discussion, and I wouldn't dare suggest that Marte could finish ahead of him in a 5x5 categories league (such as Rotisserie), where his stolen bases are more impactful and his strikeouts are of no consequence. In Head-to-Head points, though, where strikeouts do count for something, the gap may be enough to tip the scales in Marte's favor, but that's only if he's a masher in his own right. I think he can be. He has the exit velocities for it and makes contact at a nice rate for a player who can hit the ball in excess of 115 mph.  He's also a capable base-stealer, his sprint speed measuring in the 88th percentile. The fact is that Marte is capable of impacting the game in more ways than De La Cruz (if not to the same extent), and while it may never quite elevate him to first-round status, it could bring him pretty close. </p><h2> \t<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/players/2942981/brice-turang/fantasy/\">Brice Turang</a> hits 25 home runs </h2><p>This prediction would seem <strong>bolder</strong> if Brice Turang hadn't just hit 10 home runs in August. If he does that again in September, well, he's at 27 for 2025, putting him past the threshold that I'm <strong>boldly</strong> predicting here. But of course, no one is thinking he'll do that. It was a stretch to think he might hit 10 home runs <em>in an entire season</em> prior to him doing it in that one month, and lightning doesn't strike twice. One development that may have gone unnoticed prior to Turang's big August, though, is how much harder he's hitting the ball this year. His average and max exit velocities are both up more than 3 mph from last year, which is a huge leap. It wasn't translating to power because his swing was geared for hitting line drives the other way, but that's what changed in August. His pull-air rate exploded, and if that remains his approach going forward, his new exit velocities will make power inevitable. A 25-homer season for a former 50-steal guy? Just how high does the upside go here? </p>\n<h2> \t<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/players/29086560/ben-rice/fantasy/\">Ben Rice</a> hits over .290 with an OPS over .900 </h2><p>All I'm doing here is saying that Rice is exactly who Statcast makes him out to be. His Baseball Savant page is lit up by bright red bars that read 94th percentile or better in all the major hitting metrics, such as xBA (.293) and xSLG (.576). If he just lives up to those, he meets this prediction easily. </p><figure><p><img alt=\"ben-rice-stats.jpg\" src=\"https://sportshub.cbsistatic.com/i/r/2025/09/04/5dcc934b-d2de-421d-b669-c6f6b7210da6/resize/670x377/b60ff20b5e632eab279b62d926be8e6f/ben-rice-stats.jpg\" /></p><figcaption><span>\n                                                                    via Baseball Savant\n                                                            </span></figcaption></figure><p>Of course, he wouldn't be the first hitter to routinely fall short of Statcat's expectations, but we've learned this year that a low pull-air rate can usually explain such shortfalls. Rice excels there, too, his 26.5 percent rate placing him in the 93rd percentile. The 26-year-old is everything you could want a hitter to be, right down to him batting left-handed at Yankee Stadium, and as a full-time first baseman next year (one with catcher eligibility, no less), he should achieve his final form. </p><h2> At least five catchers score more Head-to-Head points than <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/players/1947839/j-t-realmuto/fantasy/\">J.T. Realmuto</a> had in his best season </h2><p>I'm using Realmuto as a frame of reference because he was long considered the gold standard at catcher, routinely drafted No. 1 at the position. The most Head-to-Head points he ever scored in a season were 441.5 in 2019. <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/players/2933037/cal-raleigh/fantasy/\">Cal Raleigh</a> has already topped that number this year, and <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/players/2822087/william-contreras/fantasy/\">William Contreras</a> is on pace to thanks to his second-half surge. Let's pencil them in for 2026 as well, but who else? </p>\n<p>Well, Ben Rice would easily meet the mark if he meets my bold prediction for him (see above). <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/players/26911639/hunter-goodman/fantasy/\">Hunter Goodman</a> probably doesn't have the plate discipline for it, projecting for 412 points (along with 32 homers and 95 RBI) even in a year when everything has gone right. <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/players/29075524/drake-baldwin/fantasy/\">Drake Baldwin</a>, though, presents a near flawless hitting profile and will presumably take on a bigger portion of catching responsibilities next year. <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/players/29085042/agustin-ramirez/fantasy/\">Agustin Ramirez</a> and Samuel Basallo both offer massive upside and project to take a big step forward. <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/players/29155728/kyle-teel/fantasy/\">Kyle Teel</a> has begun to flash real potential of his own, and I'm not ruling out a return to form for Adley Rutschman, who scored 463.5 points in 2023. That's not even mentioning standbys like <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/players/1666825/will-smith/fantasy/\">Will Smith</a>, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/players/3117480/shea-langeliers/fantasy/\">Shea Langeliers</a>, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/players/1793168/salvador-perez/fantasy/\">Salvador Perez</a>, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/players/2829012/yainer-diaz/fantasy/\">Yainer Diaz</a>, and, yes, Realmuto. Bottom line is that the position has so much to offer than in those days when Realmuto stood atop the rankings, and I only see it getting better. </p><h2> Spencer Strider bounces back with 200-plus strikeouts </h2><p>The bloom is fully off the rose now. Only once in his past six starts has Strider struck out more than three batters, putting together an 8.16 ERA during that time and marking his return from elbow surgery as a big enough dud that he may never recover from it. </p><p>But I think he will. It's easy to forget that he had a seven-start stretch earlier this year with a 2.53 ERA, 1.08 WHIP, and 12.2 K/9. Things were looking up then, mostly on the strength of a slider that still rates as one of the best of the game. The problem is that he has nothing to go with it but a fastball, which itself rated as an elite pitch before the injury. It has since lost some velocity and, more notably, its characteristic \"rising\" effect that causes hitters to swing underneath it. Strider is aware of this and, for one start on Aug. 25, seemed to recapture that shape after working with Maven Baseball Lab in Atlanta. It'll take more time in the lab this offseason for that change to stick, probably, but at least there's proof of concept. And if Strider works to expand his arsenal as another potential safeguard, even better. </p>\n<h2> \t<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/players/2211754/dylan-cease/fantasy/\">Dylan Cease</a> shaves two runs off of his ERA </h2><p>Maybe a 2.81 ERA, which is what this prediction would translate to at this particular moment, is a touch optimistic, but this is a <strong>bold</strong> prediction, after all. Cease did have a 2.20 ERA in 2022, so a 2.81 mark is in the realm of the reasonable. The bottom line is that I don't think anything is actually wrong with him. His strikeout rate is still fourth-best among qualifiers. His walk rate, while not good, is in line with career norms. What we've seen from Cease this year is the typical variance that accompanies a pitcher with good stuff but bad control. You could basically sum up his whole career this way. It's why his past four seasons have alternated between Cy Young-caliber and not so good. Just playing the odds, then, you'd bet on his ERA settling back into the mid-threes, where it was last year and where all the estimators say it should be now. Getting to the high twos from there isn't a big leap. </p><h2> \t<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/players/29075759/roman-anthony/fantasy/\">Roman Anthony</a> leads the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/teams/BOS/boston-red-sox/\">Red Sox</a> in home runs </h2><p>This is a bet on talent as much as anything. We know Anthony impacts the ball like an elite slugger, placing behind only <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/players/2822182/oneil-cruz/fantasy/\">Oneil Cruz</a>, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/players/2071264/aaron-judge/fantasy/\">Aaron Judge</a>, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/players/2901324/shohei-ohtani/fantasy/\">Shohei Ohtani</a>, and <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/players/2135243/kyle-schwarber/fantasy/\">Kyle Schwarber</a> in average exit velocity. It's just a matter of him actualizing that power by angling the ball off the bat properly. This was the read on him in the minors as well, and it didn't stop him from being the consensus top prospect at the time of his promotion. Already, we were seeing him make strides with six homers in his final 21 games before suffering a season-ending oblique injury, and looking over the Red Sox's roster, he seems like the most reasonable bet for 30-plus homers next year, regardless of his pace this year. </p><h2> \t<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/players/2449444/bryan-reynolds/fantasy/\">Bryan Reynolds</a> gets traded and goes on to deliver his best OPS in five years </h2><p>Reynolds is the hitter version of Dylan Cease in that there's little in the underlying data to explain why he's been so much worse this year, which inclines me to believe it's just one of those things. \"Variance\" would be the more sophisticated way of putting it. If you want to harp on his strikeout rate being his highest since 2020, fair enough, but his expected stats, which take strikeout rate into account, are virtually identical to last year. In short, Statcast thinks he should be hitting .272 and slugging .474, which is more or less the player we've always known him to be. The reason I'm saying \"best in five years\" is because his .912 OPS in 2021 (incidentally, the year after his other high-strikeout season) is unlikely to be repeated. Then again, we've never seen him play for a team with something to play for, so a trade could propel him to new heights. </p>\n<h2> \t<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/players/2173411/matthew-boyd/fantasy/\">Matthew Boyd</a>, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/players/2836515/andrew-abbott/fantasy/\">Andrew Abbott</a> both have an ERA over 4.00 </h2><p>I have to go negative with one of these predictions, don't I? A certain pitcher phenotype has excelled in a way that's unique to 2025. I'd define it as a left-hander who doesn't throw especially hard, doesn't miss bats at an above-average rate, and doesn't put the ball on the ground nearly as much as you'd want given those shortcomings. But he does throw a lot of strikes and induces mostly weak contact. Normally, I'd say such a pitcher could be serviceable in Fantasy, but with pronounced ERA concerns. Something about the league environment this year, though, has allowed that phenotype to play beyond its capabilities, with Boyd (2.94 ERA) and Abbott (2.65 ERA) being the most prominent examples. </p><p>The biggest lesson I've learned in the past four years is that the way the ball is playing one year won't necessarily be the way it plays the next, so identifying those one-off environmental darlings and fading them in drafts would seem to be the wisest course of action. </p><h2> \t<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/players/29085946/jakob-marsee/fantasy/\">Jakob Marsee</a> has more combined home runs and stolen bases than <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/players/2932710/jarren-duran/fantasy/\">Jarren Duran</a> </h2><p>This prediction is performing double duty. On the one hand, it's acknowledging that Duran is much more beatable in this metric than he might have seemed a year ago. A combined 40 homers and steals may be all it takes, and frankly, that's more believable than the combined 55 he had in 2024, a year that wrung out every last bit of the production he has to offer. But this prediction is also expressing confidence in Marsee, a top minor-league performer who never rated as much of a prospect because of subpar exit velocity readings but who has continued to do the same things that got him called to the majors in the first place, namely working the count, running with reckless abandon, and directing the ball to the shortest part of right field. He's capable of impacting the game in so many ways that even if he falls short in one area, he's likely to be of value still. </p>\n<h2> \t<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/players/29321958/luke-keaschall/fantasy/\">Luke Keaschall</a> leads all second basemen in OPS </h2><p>Before I address Keaschall specifically, let me remind you that a certain fellow named <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/players/1963334/ketel-marte/fantasy/\">Ketel Marte</a> still plays second base, and Marte is presently enjoying his second straight year (and fourth overall) with an OPS over .900. I don't think Keaschall is as good of a hitter as Marte. He simply doesn't impact the ball the same way.  But what may put him slightly ahead is the O in OPS, on-base percentage. It's going to be tough because Marte himself is great at drawing walks, but Keaschall has a chance to be even better. He reached base at a .420 clip in the minors last year and is so far at .404 in the majors. </p><p>So is this prediction a technicality? What about leagues where walks don't matter? Fortunately, Keaschall has also shown himself to be a prolific base-stealer, as was also true in the minors. And to be clear, he has the ability to put the ball in the bleachers, too. He just relies more on hitting it at the proper angles than Marte does. </p><h2> \t<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/players/2835064/shane-baz/fantasy/\">Shane Baz</a> blossoms into an ace </h2><p>Even though the full-season line for Baz is sorely lacking, there have been flashes this year, from the two double-digit strikeout efforts in April to the four-start stretch with a 2.30 ERA, 1.02 WHIP, and 9.9 K/9 in June and July. They serve as little reminders of the potential that made him arguably the top pitching prospect in baseball prior to needing Tommy John surgery in 2022. Unfortunately, he's still searching for the put-away pitch he lost with the procedure. He's shelved his once dominant slider almost completely in 2025, finding occasional success with a curveball and cutter instead, and that willingness to tinker, combined with his peak velocities and pedigree, is why I remain hopeful. With the way this season has gone, I suspect he'll redouble his efforts to rediscover his slider in the offseason. </p>\n<h2> \t<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/players/29644503/payton-tolle/fantasy/\">Payton Tolle</a> wins AL Rookie of the Year </h2><p>I'm planting my flag in this one early. One start is all it took to convince me Tolle will join with Garrett Crochet to form maybe the fiercest 1-2 punch in all of the American League. His fastball looks like it's on a ramp, inducing feeble swings as it soars through the top of the zone at 98 mph. He has no trouble locating it either, throwing 67 percent of his pitches for strikes in the minors this year. He also stands an intimidating 6-feet-6 and flashes a menacing stare every time he notches a strikeout. </p>\n<p>It's everything I could hope for in a young pitcher, and seeing as he stormed through three levels of the minors this year -- compiling a 3.04 ERA, 0.99 WHIP, and 13.1 K/9 along the way -- I don't feel like I'm speaking too soon here. Rookie of the Year is harder to win for pitchers than hitters, given that their reps are often limited, but Tolle's sheer dominance may be enough to vault him ahead of the defensively challenged Samuel Basallo. </p><h2> \t<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/players/2821278/jonathan-aranda/fantasy/\">Jonathan Aranda</a> doubles his home run total </h2><p>Another year, another Jonathan Aranda bold prediction. What makes the tradition different this year is that there can be no denying he's good anymore. He made the All-Star team and is likely to finish 2025 with a batting average north of .300 and an OPS north of .850. The one area where he still has ground to gain is home runs, and while I don't yet know the exact number that I'm asking him to double, the point is that I'm comfortable projecting him to be in the 25-30 range, which is how he was pacing his last few years in the minors. He has the exit velocities for it. He has the pull-air rate for it. Statcast right now has him as one of the biggest underachievers in slugging percentage, with his actual mark trailing his expected mark by nearly 50 points. </p>\n<h2> \t<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/players/26912475/jacob-lopez/fantasy/\">Jacob Lopez</a> outperforms <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/players/2933069/joe-ryan/fantasy/\">Joe Ryan</a> </h2><p>This isn't meant as a slight to Ryan, who has emerged as a borderline Cy Young candidate this year by rounding out his usual low WHIP and high strikeout rate with a solid ERA. The reason for the comparison is that I think Lopez has a lot in common. Both were passed over as prospects because of marginal velocities, even as they racked up high strikeout totals in the minors. The key for both has been a similar arm angle and low induced vertical break. In short, the unfamiliar shape of the fastball helps it play beyond its velocity. Only when Ryan was promoted to the majors at age 25 did he convince evaluators it was no fluke, and Lopez's rookie season (at age 27) has played out similarly, seeing him strike out nine or more five times in just 17 starts. </p>\n            </div>"

The 23-year-old right-hander is coming off back-to-back victories in which he registered 13 strikeouts over 13 innings and was superb against the Dodgers earlier this season, scattering five hits while fanning nine batters across 6 1/3 frames en route to victory.</p><p><span><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/betting/news/best-betting-apps/\">Top sportsbooks</a></span> have set the total strikeouts props for both Snell (Over -156, Under +119) and Skenes (Over -118, Under -112) at 6.5. The SportsLine Projection Model, which simulates every <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://cbssports.com/mlb/\">MLB</a> game 10,000 times, rates Skenes' Over 6.5 strikeouts prop as a 3-star play on its 5-star scale and Snell's Over 6.5 as a 2.5-star play.</p><p>However, the model has found better value <a href=\"https://www.sportsline.com/mlb/\" target=\"_blank\">on Thursday's six-game schedule</a>, as there are two pitcher strikeout player props that it has rated at 4.5 stars, including one that returns plus money, and one at 4 stars. Here they are:</p>\n<h3>Kyle Hendricks Over 2.5 strikeouts (+110) vs. Royals (7:40 p.m. ET)</h3><p>Rating: 4.5 stars<br /><a href=\"https://www.sportsline.com/mlb/game-forecast/MLB_20250904_LAA@KC/prop-picks/\" target=\"_blank\">Model projection: 3.5 strikeouts</a></p>\n<p>Hendricks has fanned only two batters in each of his last two starts but has posted his best strikeout numbers this year on the road. The 35-year-old righty recorded a season-high nine strikeouts against the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/teams/NYY/new-york-yankees/\">Yankees</a> in New York and struck out six at both Cleveland and Detroit. Kansas City enters Thursday with the lowest strikeout total in the majors (945) this campaign but whiffed eight times in Wednesday's loss to the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/teams/LAA/los-angeles-angels/\">Angels</a>. Hendricks has gone Over this projected total in each of his four career starts against the Royals and fanned four over five innings in his turn against them last year.</p>\n<h3>Ranger Suarez Over 4.5 strikeouts (-135) vs. Brewers (4:10 p.m. ET)</h3><p>Rating: 4 stars<br /><a href=\"https://www.sportsline.com/mlb/game-forecast/MLB_20250904_PHI@MIL/prop-picks/\" target=\"_blank\">Model projection: 5.4 strikeouts</a></p>\n<p>Suarez is looking to bounce back from an outing against the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/teams/ATL/atlanta-braves/\">Atlanta Braves</a> in which he recorded only two strikeouts over five innings. The 30-year-old Venezuelan left-hander reached double digits in each of his previous two turns, fanning 10 across 6 2/3 frames versus the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/teams/SEA/seattle-mariners/\">Seattle Mariners</a> and 11 over seven innings against the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/teams/WAS/washington-nationals/\">Washington Nationals</a>. Suarez has registered five or more strikeouts in eight of his nine starts on the road this season, averaging 6.1 in those contests.</p>\n<h3>Carlos Rodon Over 5.5 strikeouts (-101) vs. Astros (7:40 p.m. ET)</h3><p>Rating: 4.5 stars<br /><a href=\"https://www.sportsline.com/mlb/game-forecast/MLB_20250904_NYY@HOU/prop-picks/\" target=\"_blank\">Model projection: 6.3 strikeouts</a></p>\n<p>Rodon hasn't recorded more than five strikeouts in any of his last five starts but has had good success against the Astros over his career. The 32-year-old southpaw has fanned 64 batters across 64 2/3 innings in 11 outings versus Houston and struck out 11 over 10 2/3 frames in two meetings last season. The Astros have the third-fewest amount of strikeouts in the American League this year but have whiffed at least eight times in each of their last four games.</p>\n            </div>"

    "body": "<div>\n        <p>After a thrilling opening weekend, the Week 2 college football schedule features just one Top 25 showdown. The No. 18 Oklahoma Sooners host the No. 15 Michigan Wolverines at OU Memorial Stadium on Saturday at 7:30 p.m. ET. The Sooners opened the season with a 35-3 victory over Illinois State, while Michigan cruised to a 34-17 win over New Mexico. According to the latest Week 2 college football odds, the Sooners are favored by 5.5 points, while the over/under for total points scored is 45, down 8.5 points from the opening line. SportsLine's model is backing Michigan, which is 12-3 in its last 15 games on the road, to cover the spread in over 60% of simulations on Saturday. </p><p>The model is also backing Duke (+3) to cover at home against Illinois, while the Over (47.5) hits more than 60% of the time in Vanderbilt vs. Virginia Tech.

Oklahoma, meanwhile, is 2-4 against the spread in its last six games when playing as the favorite. The Wolverines will look to control the clock by imposing their dominant ground game, which was on full display in last week's win over Nex Mexico. Running back Justice Haynes recorded 16 carries for 159 yards and three scores against the Lobos, and SportsLine's model expects he'll average 6.1 yards per carry against the Sooners. The model is projecting Michigan to cover the spread in over 60% of simulations, providing clear value on the spread.    </p><h2>Duke +3 vs. Illinois</h2><p>Duke has the opportunity to make a statement with an early-season victory over a Fighting Illini team that many think can make an appearance in the College Football Playoff. The Blue Devils notched a 45-17 win over Elon in Week 1, strengthening their impressive home record. Duke enters Saturday's showdown having won nine of its last 10 games at home, and the Blue Devils are 6-0 against the spread in their past six meetings against an opponent from the Big Ten. SportsLine's model is backing Duke to cover the spread in 58% of simulations, targeting the Blue Devils as one of its top Week 2 college football picks. </p><h2>Over 47.5 points in Vanderbilt vs. Virginia Tech</h2><p>The Commodores racked up 45 points in last week's win over Charleston Southern behind a strong showing from quarterback Diego Pavio, who completed 20 of 25 passes for 275 yards and three touchdowns. Pavio's production is a big reason why the total has gone Over in five of Vanderbilt's last five games played in September. The Over has also hit in eight of Vanderbilt's past nine meetings against an opponent from the ACC. Vanderbilt secured a 34-27 win over Virginia Tech last season, and SportsLine's model is projecting these two teams will combine for 55 points on Saturday, helping the Over hit in more than 60% of simulations. </p><h2>Want more Week 2 college football picks?</h2><p><strong>You've seen the model's Week 2 college football best bets for Sunday.

    "body": "<div>\n        <p>Sometimes, all it takes is a two-week September hot streak to give a team hope in the postseason race, and no team is hotter than the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/teams/SF/san-francisco-giants/\">San Francisco Giants</a> right now. On Wednesday night, the Giants survived a ninth-inning push by the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/teams/COL/colorado-rockies/\">Colorado Rockies</a> in a classic Coors Field chaos game (<a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/boxscore/recap/MLB_20250903_SF@COL/\" target=\"_blank\">SF 10, COL 8</a>) and won their fourth straight game. It was their 10th win in the last 11 games.</p><p>\"It's  better late than never, I guess,\" <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/players/2135256/matt-chapman/\">Matt Chapman</a> told reporters, including <a href=\"https://www.mlb.com/giants/news/matt-chapman-s-two-homers-power-giants-to-10th-win-in-11-games\" target=\"_blank\">MLB.com</a>, about the team's recent hot streak.  \"It's been a lot of fun. We obviously hit a rough patch (earlier this year) but I feel like  we're really coming into our own right now and playing good baseball.  We're really just trying to keep it rolling.\"</p><p>At 71-69, the Giants have jumped the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/teams/CIN/cincinnati-reds/\">Cincinnati Reds</a> in the standings and are now the first team on the outside of the wild card picture looking in. Here are the NL wild card standings:</p><ol><li><strong><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/teams/CHC/chicago-cubs/\">Chicago Cubs</a>:</strong> 80-60 (+5 GB)</li><li><strong><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/teams/SD/san-diego-padres/\">San Diego Padres</a>:</strong> 76-64 (+1 GB)</li><li><strong><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/teams/NYM/new-york-mets/\">New York Mets</a>:</strong> 75-65<br />----------------------------------------------------<br /></li><li><strong>San Francisco Giants:</strong> 71-69 (4 GB)</li><li><strong>Cincinnati Reds:</strong> 70-70 (5 GB)</li></ol><p>The Giants lost the season series to the Mets, so the Mets have the tiebreaker. That four-game deficit is really a five-game deficit. The Giants have to pass the Mets. A tie does them no good. Still, four games is the closest the Giants have been to a postseason spot since Aug. 10. They haven't been closer than four games since July 27, when they were three games back.   </p>\n<p>This is the first time the Giants have won 10 times in an 11-game span since a 10-1 stretch in June 2023. How have the Giants done it? Can they keep doing it and actually reach the postseason? Here's what's going on in San Francisco and a look at their road ahead.</p><h2>The offense is red hot</h2><p>The Giants haven't been an offense-first team in a long time. Oracle Park, their pitcher-friendly and homer-hating home ballpark, doesn't really allow for building a team around bats. <span><a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/news/mlb-trends-juan-soto-and-shohei-ohtani-add-new-tricks-plus-giants-vying-for-a-first-since-barry-bonds/\" target=\"_blank\">There's a reason they haven't had a 30-homer guy since 2004</a></span>. The Giants are averaging 4.32 runs per game, 19th in baseball, and their 150 home runs are 20th in baseball. It's a mediocre offense at best.</p><p>Lately though, the offense has been firing on every cylinder. The Giants have outscored their opponents 86-47 during the 10-1 stretch and four times in the 11 games they scored at least 10 runs. Seven times, they scored at least seven runs. This is the first time the Giants have scored at least 86 runs in an 11-game span since September 2021, the year they won 107 games.</p>\n<p><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/players/2165929/rafael-devers/\">Rafael Devers</a> has 11 home runs in his last 29 games and is in the middle of his best stretch as a Giant, though he's not the only one tearing the covering off the ball. Look at these numbers in the last 11 games:</p><table><tbody><tr><th><br /></th><th>PA</th><th>AVG/OBP/SLG</th><th>HR</th><th>RBI</th></tr><tr><td><p><strong><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/players/2165933/willy-adames/\">Willy Adames</a></strong></p></td><td><p>48</p></td><td><p>.308/.375/.615</p></td><td><p>4</p></td><td><p>11</p></td></tr><tr><td><p><strong>Matt Chapman</strong></p></td><td><p>44</p></td><td><p>.289/.409/.686</p></td><td><p>4</p></td><td><p>10</p></td></tr><tr><td><p><strong>Rafael Devers</strong></p></td><td><p>48</p></td><td><p>.381/.458/.786</p></td><td><p>5</p></td><td><p>14</p></td></tr><tr><td><p><strong><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/players/26615364/luis-matos/\">Luis Matos</a></strong></p></td><td><p>41</p></td><td><p>.368/.390/.553</p></td><td><p>2</p></td><td><p>7</p></td></tr><tr><td><p><strong><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/players/2835071/heliot-ramos/\">Heliot Ramos</a></strong></p></td><td><p>43</p></td><td><p>.368/.442/.474</p></td><td><p>1</p></td><td><p>6</p></td></tr></tbody></table><p><span><a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/news/matt-chapman-suspended-kyle-freeland-others-fined-over-giants-rockies-brawl-following-rafael-devers-home-run/\" target=\"_blank\">Chapman received a one-game suspension for Tuesday's benches-clearing incident with the Rockies</a></span>, appealed it, then hit two home runs Wednesday. The Giants as a team have hit .311/.375/.533 with 24 home runs during the 10-1 stretch. They've hit a home run in 17 straight games, a team record for the San Francisco era (since 1958). The franchise record is 19 straight games, set in 1947.</p><p>The guys the Giants need to be their best players have been their best players. It's Adames, Chapman, and Devers leading the way offensively, with help from Matos, Ramos, and others. The Giants dug a deep enough hole that there's no climbing out of it without those guys putting on their Superman capes, and they've done just that over the last few weeks. The offense is the single biggest reason the Giants have won 10 of their last 11 and given themselves some hope in the wild card race.</p><h2>They've gotten surprise contributions</h2><p>Chapman was ejected from Tuesday's game after the benches-clearing incident. That forced utility infielder <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/players/26615334/casey-schmitt/\">Casey Schmitt</a> into the game even though he was held out of the lineup with a sore elbow after being hit by a pitch Monday. Naturally, Schmitt went deep a few innings later. A guy who wasn't supposed to be in the lineup hit a home run. That's when you know things are going well.</p><p>Rookie outfielder <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/players/28920031/drew-gilbert/\">Drew Gilbert</a>, acquired from the Mets in the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/players/2170031/tyler-rogers/\">Tyler Rogers</a> trade at the deadline, was called up last month and is starting to settle in at the big-league level. He is 10 for 19 with three doubles, a triple, two home runs, one walk, and no strikeouts in his last six games. Gilbert has also injected some energy into the dugout with what we'll call over-the-top home run celebrations.</p>\n<p>Light-hitting backup catcher <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/players/2699270/andrew-knizner/\">Andrew Knizner</a> is 4 for 8 with a walk during the 10-1 stretch. Righty reliever <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/players/2824943/joel-peguero/\">Joel Peguero</a>, who spent nine years in the minors before making his <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://cbssports.com/mlb/\">MLB</a> debut on Aug. 21, has thrown nine scoreless innings for the Giants and assumed a high-leverage role. Up/down spot starter <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/players/26615437/kai-wei-teng/\">Kai-Wei Teng</a> allowed two runs in 5 ⅓ innings Monday. At Coors Field, no less.</p><p>Then there's future Hall of Famer <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/players/530362/justin-verlander/\">Justin Verlander</a>, who, at age 42, spent much of the season looking like he was near the end of the line. He missed a month with a pectoral strain earlier this year and was sitting on a 4.99 ERA as recently as July 18. In eight starts since, Verlander has allowed two or fewer runs six times. That includes a 10-strikeout, 121-pitch (!) effort this past Sunday.</p><p>\"You  just turn the page after each single pitch,\" Verlander told reporters (via <a href=\"https://www.mlb.com/news/justin-verlander-has-first-10-strikeout-outing-with-giants\" target=\"_blank\">MLB.com</a>), after that Sunday start against the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/teams/BAL/baltimore-orioles/\">Baltimore Orioles</a>. \"Absorb as much information  as you can from it and move onto the next pitch. Rinse and repeat.\"</p><p>The Giants have won 10 times in 11 games because Adames, Chapman, Devers, and ace <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/players/3055542/logan-webb/\">Logan Webb</a> are driving the bus. They've also done it because Verlander has turned back the clock, Schmitt hit a home run in a game he wasn't supposed to play, Teng gave them a great spot start, and others have stepped up unexpectedly. That's what it takes to win 10 times in 11 games in this league. Your best players have to perform and others have to chip in too.</p><h2>The road ahead</h2><p>The Giants have 22 games remaining and, right now, the Mets are on pace for 87 wins. Figure that's what it'll take to get the third wild card spot. The Giants must go 16-6 in their final 22 games to get to 87 wins, and sure, that's doable, but it won't be easy. Case in point: San Francisco is 12-10 in their last 22 games even with this 10-1 hot streak.</p><p>Here is their remaining schedule:</p><ul><li>Sept. 5-7 at <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/teams/STL/st-louis-cardinals/\">St. Louis Cardinals</a> (3 games)</li><li>Sept. 8-10 vs. <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/teams/ARI/arizona-diamondbacks/\">Arizona Diamondbacks</a> (3 games)</li><li>Sept. 12-14 vs. <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/teams/LAD/los-angeles-dodgers/\">Los Angeles Dodgers</a> (3 games)</li><li>Sept. 15-17 at Arizona Diamondbacks (3 games)</li><li>Sept. 18-21 at Los Angeles Dodgers (4 games)</li><li>Sept. 22-24 vs. St. Louis Cardinals (3 games)</li><li>Sept. 26-28 vs. Colorado Rockies (3 games)</li></ul><p>That is a lot of games (15 of 22, to be precise) against non-contenders playing out the string. The Dodgers aren't playing especially well either (1-4 in last five games and 22-29 in last 51 games), though those Dodgers/Giants games are always a grind. Plus it's not like the Dodgers have the NL West locked up. The Padres are only 2 ½ games back. The Dodgers need wins too.</p><p>Despite those 15 games against non-contenders, San Francisco's remaining schedule is the toughest among the top four teams in the NL wild card race, <a href=\"https://www.fangraphs.com/standings/playoff-odds\" target=\"_blank\">per FanGraphs</a>. It is significantly tougher than the Mets' remaining schedule, the team the Giants have to run down. No head-to-head games with the Mets (or Padres) really hurts the Giants. They don't control their own destiny. They need other teams to beat the Mets (and Padres) to get in.</p><h2>Can they actually reach the postseason?</h2><p>Can they? I mean, sure, of course they can. Stranger things have happened in this game. This 10-1 heater does feel too little, too late though. If the Giants manage to go 16-6 in their final 22 games to get to 87 wins, the Mets only need to go 11-11 in their final 22 games to beat them out for a wild card spot. The Padres, who also hold the tiebreaker over the Giants, need to go 10-22 in their final 22 games to reach 87 wins. The Giants have very little margin of error.</p><p><a href=\"https://www.fangraphs.com/standings/playoff-odds\" target=\"_blank\">FanGraphs</a> puts San Francisco's postseason odds at 4.4%. <a href=\"https://www.sportsline.com/\" target=\"_blank\">SportsLine</a> is more generous at 10.3%, while <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/betting/news/caesars-promo-code/\">Caesars</a> puts them at +900 to make the playoffs. The Giants can't get caught up in that though. It's cliche, but they just need to win tonight's game (well, tomorrow night's game since Thursday is an off-day). Control what you can control. Win your games, handle your business, and hope you get help against whoever is playing the Mets (and Padres) on any given night. Reaching the postseason is a long shot, for sure. Their odds aren't zero though.</p>\n            </div>"

They have won three of the last four games between these schools. Rebels quarterback Austin Simmons threw for 341 yards with three passing touchdowns last week. Kewan Lacy added 108 rushing yards and three touchdowns on the road. They also had four players log 50-plus receiving yards last week. The Wildcats beat Toledo 24-16 last week but didn't cover the spread after opening up as 9.5-point favorites. Despite getting the win, they only mustered up 85 passing yards. SportsLine's model is calling for the Rebels to cover the spread on the road in 60% of simulations. </p><h2>Oklahoma vs. Michigan betting preview, picks</h2><p><strong>Michigan vs. Oklahoma Over 45.5 total points</strong></p><p>Both teams have new quarterbacks under center, and they balled out in Week 1. Freshman Bryce Underwood made his debut versus New Mexico, tossing 251 yards with one passing touchdown. Michigan recorded 452 total yards of offense and scored 34 points. John Mateer transferred over from Washington State and dominated in his Sooners' debut. Against Illinois State, Mateer went 30-of-37 for 392 yards and three touchdowns. The offense had 495 total yards and poured in 35 points. The model is projecting 48 total points and has the over cashing in more than 50% of simulations. </p><h2>Responsible gaming</h2><p>Responsible gaming is a serious topic, and all sportsbooks take steps to ensure users play responsibly.

    "body": "<div>\n<p>Week 1 of the 2025 <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://cbssports.com/college-football/\">college football</a> season featured three matchups between ranked teams, and all three higher-ranked clubs were defeated. Overall, five ranked teams wound up in the loss column last week, four of which were No. 8 or higher.</p><p>Three of those clubs get a chance to redeem themselves during Week 2 of the FBS schedule, which begins Friday with four contests. The only game involving a pair of ranked teams takes place Saturday, when No. 15 <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/teams/MICH/michigan-wolverines/\">Michigan</a> visits 18th-ranked <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/teams/OKLA/oklahoma-sooners/\">Oklahoma</a> at 7:30 p.m. ET.

Redshirt junior <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/players/28877490/rocco-becht/\">Rocco Becht</a> set a pair of school records in the rout, completing 95% of his pass attempts (19-of-20) while throwing a touchdown pass in his 20th consecutive game.</p><p>Becht finished with three TD tosses against South Dakota, including a pair to tight end <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/players/29133273/benjamin-brahmer/\">Benjamin Brahmer</a>. It marked the second time in as many games this season that Becht has accounted for three scores, as he threw for two touchdowns and ran for another versus Kansas State.</p><p>Iowa State also scored four times on the ground in Week 1, making it one of 10 teams in the nation with at least five rushing scores in 2025. The Hawkeyes (1-0) cruised past <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/teams/ALBANY/albany-great-danes/\">Albany</a> 34-7 last week to give head coach Kirk Ferentz his 205th win with the program, tying him with <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/teams/OHIOST/ohio-state-buckeyes/\">Ohio State's</a> Woody Hayes for first place on the Big Ten's all-time list.</p><p>Iowa owns a 47-24 record in the all-time series and has won six straight on the road against Iowa State but has lost its last nine contests against AP-ranked opponents. SportsLine expert Micah Roberts likes the Cyclones to extend that streak and break the one of five consecutive victories by the road team in the rivalry, as he grabbed Iowa State -142 on the money line at <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/betting/news/draftkings-promo-code/\">DraftKings Sportsbook</a>. Roberts, who is +130 on his last four ML picks involving the Cyclones, was not impressed with last week's performance by Iowa quarterback <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/players/26719097/mark-gronowski/\">Mark Gronowski</a>, who completed 8-of-15 pass attempts for a mere 44 yards.</p><h2>Kansas vs. Missouri pick</h2>\n<p>Both teams have had easy starts to the season, as Missouri (1-0) demolished <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/teams/CAR/central-arkansas-bears/\">Central Arkansas</a> 61-6 in its opener and Kansas (2-0) outscored <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/teams/FRESNO/fresno-state-bulldogs/\">Fresno State</a> and <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/teams/WAG/wagner-seahawks/\">Wagner</a> 77-14 in its two victories. Now they prepare for the 121st edition of the Border Showdown, which is one of the oldest rivalries in college football, but their first meeting since 2011.</p><p>Missouri owns a slight edge in the all-time series, as it enters Saturday's meeting with a 56-55-9 record after having won each of the last three clashes. The Tigers will look to make it four in a row behind quarterback <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/players/28874546/beau-pribula/\">Beau Pribula</a>, who threw for a pair of touchdowns and ran for two others against Central Arkansas in his first collegiate start. Kansas counterpart <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/players/3166688/jalon-daniels/\">Jalon Daniels</a> also has been impressive out of the gate, recording three TD passes in the season-opening rout of Fresno State and four last week versus Wagner.</p><p>The SportsLine Projection Model sees Missouri winning in 79% of its simulations, while expert Roberts feels they will cover the spread as 6-point favorites at <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/betting/news/caesars-promo-code/\">Caesars Sportsbook</a>. Roberts, who is 5-2 (+280) in his last seven against-the-spread picks involving the Tigers, believes their defense will be the reason they come up with their seventh straight cover dating back to last season.</p><h2>Memphis vs. Georgia State pick</h2>\n<p>The Tigers (1-0) kicked off the 2025 season with a comfortable victory as they rolled past <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/teams/TNCHAT/chattanooga-mocs/\">Chattanooga</a> 45-10 last Saturday. It marked the 41st consecutive game in which Memphis scored at least 20 points, the longest active streak in the nation.</p><p>Quarterback <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/players/3162731/brendon-lewis/\">Brendon Lewis</a> was the offensive star for the Tigers as he completed 22-of-28 pass attempts for 199 yards and a touchdown while also running for 81 yards and a score. The redshirt senior hopes to be a force again versus Georgia State (0-1), which was blasted 63-7 by then-No. 21 <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/teams/MISS/ole-miss-rebels/\">Ole Miss</a> in its season opener. Wideout <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/players/29173424/javon-robinson/\">Javon Robinson</a> was one of the few bright spots for the Panthers, making three catches for 52 yards and a TD.</p><p>Memphis won the only previous meeting between the teams, posting a 59-22 victory in 2018. The SportsLine Projection Model sees the Tigers dominating this time as well, as it is predicting a 45-22 triumph. Football expert Emory Hunt (+164 in his last 11 ATS picks involving Memphis) also likes the club to win big, as he has the Tigers covering as 13.5-point favorites at DraftKings. Hunt feels Lewis and the rest of Memphis' offense weren't playing at their highest level last week and will be even better against the Panthers.</p><h2><strong>Money-line underdog parlay for Week 2</strong></h2>\n<h2>Illinois vs. Duke pick</h2>\n<p>Illinois (1-0) climbed one spot in the rankings to No. 11 after steamrolling <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/teams/WIL/western-illinois-leathernecks/\">Western Illinois</a> 52-3 in its season opener. This is the highest the Fighting Illini have been ranked by AP since 2001, when they were No. 7 in the final poll. <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/players/28915401/hank-beatty/\">Hank Beatty</a> ran back a punt 69 yards for a touchdown and finished with 133 yards on punt returns, breaking the program's single-game record of 125 set by the legendary Red Grange in 1923 against <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/teams/NEB/nebraska-cornhuskers/\">Nebraska</a>.</p><p>The Fighting Illini will be in a difficult spot for them Saturday, however, as they have nine of their last 10 road games against non-conference opponents. Meanwhile, Duke (1-0) has been superb of late on its own field, where it trounced <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/teams/ELON/elon-phoenix/\">Elon</a> 45-17 last week. The Blue Devils have won nine of their last 10 at home and are 17-3 there since 2022. </p><p>Illinois and Duke split their previous two all-time meetings but haven't squared off since 1965. Even though the Fighting Illini are in the midst of a five-game winning streak and the Blue Devils have lost seven consecutive matchups against ranked teams, the SportsLine Projection Model is leaning toward Duke pulling off the upset. It has the Blue Devils winning in 54% of its simulations and is calling for a 26-24 victory behind redshirt sophomore quarterback <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/players/29123277/darian-mensah/\">Darian Mensah</a>, who threw for 389 yards and three TDs in his team debut last week.</p><h2>West Virginia vs. Ohio pick</h2>\n<p>West Virginia (1-0) had no trouble in its season opener as it routed <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/teams/ROB/robert-morris-colonials/\">Robert Morris</a> 45-3. The Mountaineers' ground attack was on full display, racking up 393 yards and registering five touchdowns, including a pair by <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/players/29121939/jahiem-white/\">Jahiem White</a>.</p><p>Ohio (0-1) was not as fortunate in its first game, as it dropped a 34-31 decision to <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/teams/RUT/rutgers-scarlet-knights/\">Rutgers</a> on the road. Quarterback <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/players/3170121/parker-navarro/\">Parker Navarro</a> did his part for the Bobcats, however, throwing for 239 yards and three TDs while rushing for 93 yards and a score.</p><p>The Mountaineers are 13-4 all-time against the Bobcats, but the teams haven't met since West Virginia posted a 20-3 home victory in 2001. Ohio won the only two previous matchups in Athens, however, and SportsLine expert Eric Cohen likes the team to remain perfect at home in the series. Cohen feels that since West Virginia had a problem with turnovers last week (four lost fumbles) and the Bobcats pulled off an upset the last time they hosted a Big 12 team (10-7 win against Iowa State in 2023), Ohio will even its record.</p><p>The model also is leaning toward the Bobcats, who win 51% of the time in its simulations. It is predicting a 28-27 triumph by Ohio.</p><h2>UCLA vs. UNLV pick</h2>\n<p>Things did not go as planned in Week 1 for UCLA (0-1), which was dominated by <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/teams/UTAH/utah-utes/\">Utah</a> 43-10. It was the largest margin of defeat in a season opener for the Bruins since they lost 38-3 to Oklahoma in 1986.</p><p>The year couldn't have started much better for UNLV, however, as the club has begun the campaign with victories against <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/teams/IDST/idaho-state-bengals/\">Idaho State</a> and <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/players/29443591/sam-houston/\">Sam Houston</a>. The Rebels scored 38 points in each triumph, while junior running back <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/players/29151868/jaiden-thomas/\">Jai'Den Thomas</a> has rushed for 212 yards and four touchdowns thus far in 2025.</p><p>UCLA won its only two previous meetings with UNLV, but the SportsLine Projection Model thinks the Rebels have a strong chance to come out on top this time around, as it sees them winning in 71% of its simulations. The model is calling for a 31-21 victory for UNLV, which is looking to get off to a 3-0 start for the second straight season.</p>\n            </div>"

Kickoff at Lincoln Financial Field is scheduled for 8:20 p.m. ET, and the Eagles are now up to 8.5-point favorites at FanDuel, with the over/under at 47.5. There will be millions of dollars on the line in NFL DFS tournaments, cash games and 50-50s on FanDuel and DraftKings, so finding DFS sleepers and building lineup variance will be critical for this single-game slate. </p><p>George Pickens is set to make his Cowboys debut. Is he a reliable option for your NFL DFS strategy, or should you target another wide receiver like DeVonta Smith, A.J. Brown or CeeDee Lamb? Others like Javonte Williams, Miles Sanders and Jaydon Blue are also new Cowboys in a made-over backfield and could warrant consideration for daily Fantasy football lineups. Before locking in any NFL DFS picks on sites like DraftKings and FanDuel for Cowboys vs. Eagles in the 2025 NFL Kickoff Game, be sure to <a href=\"https://www.sportsline.com/insiders/nfl-dfs-week-1-cowboys-vs-eagles-optimal-fanduel-draftkings-lineups-from-a-daily-fantasy-pro/#ttag=08252025_agg_cbssports_dfs_football_nfl_McClure_CowboysEaglesDFS\" target=\"_blank\">check out the NFL DFS advice, strategy, and stacks from SportsLine daily Fantasy expert Mike McClure</a>. </p><p>McClure is a legendary professional DFS player with more than $2 million in career winnings.

Barkley had a stellar season for the Eagles in 2024, becoming just the ninth player in NFL history to rush for 2,000 or more yards in a single season. The former Penn State standout finished the 2024 season with 2,005 yards and 13 touchdowns on the ground, and 33 catches for 278 yards and two scores through the air. </p><p>Barkley had plenty of success against the Dallas defense in 2024. He was held out of the end zone in both games, but he did rush for 233 yards and caught three passes for 15 yards. For this matchup his Vegas rushing line is 93.5. The Cowboys were among the worst teams in stopping the run last year as they ranked 29th in yards allowed, 30th in yards per carry given up and dead last in rushing scores allowed. <a href=\"https://www.sportsline.com/insiders/nfl-dfs-week-1-cowboys-vs-eagles-optimal-fanduel-draftkings-lineups-from-a-daily-fantasy-pro/#ttag=08252025_agg_cbssports_dfs_football_nfl_McClure_CowboysEaglesDFS\" target=\"_blank\">See who else to roster here</a>. </p><p>Part of McClure's optimal NFL DFS strategy also includes rostering Eagles quarterback Jalen Hurts. In 2024, Hurts threw for 2,903 yards with 18 touchdowns and just 5 interceptions, finishing with a 103.7 passer rating across 15 regular-season games. He carried that strong play into the postseason, winning Super Bowl MVP after throwing for 221 yards and two touchdowns, adding a rushing score, and setting a Super Bowl record for most rushing yards by a quarterback (72).</p><p>Hurts' dual-threat ability also increases his value dramatically. The former second round pick has scored double-digit rushing touchdowns in four straight seasons, including 14 in 2024. In his lone appearance against the Cowboys last season, Hurts threw for 202 yards and two touchdowns, and rushed 56 yards and two scores. His over/under for carries is 10.5, so you can expect him to be a big part of the rushing attack on Thursday. <a href=\"https://www.sportsline.com/insiders/nfl-dfs-week-1-cowboys-vs-eagles-optimal-fanduel-draftkings-lineups-from-a-daily-fantasy-pro/#ttag=08252025_agg_cbssports_dfs_football_nfl_McClure_CowboysEaglesDFS\" target=\"_blank\">See who else to roster here</a>, and new users can see the latest <span><a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/betting/news/fanduel-promo-code/\" target=\"_blank\">FanDuel promo code</a></span> to <a href=\"https://martech.cbssports.com/bt/redirect/prod?b=fanduel&amp;c=sport\" target=\"_blank\">get $300 in bonus bets at FanDuel if your $5 bet wins</a>:</p><h2>How to set NFL DFS lineups for Cowboys vs. Eagles in the 2025 NFL Kickoff Game</h2><p>McClure is targeting another undervalued player who could explode for huge numbers in the 2025 NFL Kickoff Game.

    "body": "<div>\n<p>History has proven that elite quarterbacks can make or break your fantasy football championship run. One big-name quarterback drawing mixed fantasy football reviews once again is Patrick Mahomes of the Kansas City Chiefs. Known for his uncanny ability to extend plays and deliver in clutch moments, Mahomes remains arguably the best player in the NFL today. That said, Mahomes' fantasy production dipped in 2024, and the two-time NFL MVP doesn't have the same dual-threat ability as players like Lamar Jackson, Jalen Hurts, and Josh Allen.</p><p>Should Mahomes be a part of your 2025 NFL fantasy football draft strategy? Or should you look at other options like Jackson, Hurts, Allen, or Joe Burrow for your last-minute Fantasy football drafts? Before setting your 2025 Fantasy football draft strategy, <a href=\"https://www.sportsline.com/nfl/cheat-sheets-and-rankings/#ttag=05042025_agg_cbssports_fantasy_football_nfl_model_cheatsheetscombined\" target=\"_blank\">be sure to check out the 2025 Fantasy football rankings and cheat sheets from the proven computer model at SportsLine</a>.</p><p>Last year, the model accurately predicted that Texans quarterback C.J. Stroud might take a step back in his second season. He finished as QB18 and anybody who avoided drafting him early dodged a major headache in their Fantasy football lineups. </p><p>The same model has a proven track record providing Fantasy football tips, identifying A.J. Brown as a sleeper in 2020, nailing Jonathan Taylor's monstrous season in 2021 and calling Rachaad White's breakout in 2023. Additionally, it has called past Fantasy football sleepers like Derrick Henry in 2019, Christian McCaffrey and Alvin Kamara in 2018, and Davante Adams in 2017. </p><p>Now, SportsLine has simulated the entire NFL season 10,000 times and released its latest 2025 Fantasy football rankings for PPR and non-PPR leagues, along with plenty of sleepers, breakouts and busts. <a href=\"https://www.sportsline.com/nfl/cheat-sheets-and-rankings/#ttag=05042025_agg_cbssports_fantasy_football_nfl_model_cheatsheetscombined\" target=\"_blank\">Head to SportsLine now to see them</a>. </p><h2>Top 2025 Fantasy football sleepers</h2><p>One of the 2025 Fantasy football sleepers the model is predicting: Seahawks running back Zach Charbonnet. A second-round pick in the 2023 NFL Draft, Charbonnet has shared backfield duties with Kenneth Walker III during his first two seasons -- and that split is expected to continue in 2025. However, durability could tilt the workload in Charbonnet's favor. While Walker has missed 10 games over three years (including six last season), Charbonnet has only missed one game in his career.</p><p>Charbonnet also emerged as Seattle's preferred goal-line option in 2024, rushing 135 times for 532 yards and eight touchdowns, along with 42 catches for 340 yards and another score. Notably, he's yet to fumble in 318 career NFL touches, a testament to his reliability. The model sees that dependability paying off, ranking Charbonnet ahead of Jaylen Warren and Tyrone Tracy Jr., both of whom are being drafted at least 35 picks earlier in early 2025 Fantasy drafts. <a href=\"https://www.sportsline.com/nfl/cheat-sheets-and-rankings/#ttag=05042025_agg_cbssports_fantasy_football_nfl_model_cheatsheetscombined\" target=\"_blank\">See more Fantasy football sleepers 2025 here</a>.</p><h2>Top 2025 Fantasy football breakouts</h2><p>One of the 2025 Fantasy football breakouts the model is predicting: Chargers running back Omarion Hampton. With Jim Harbaugh taking over as head coach, Los Angeles is expected to emphasize the running game -- a hallmark of Harbaugh's coaching style. The Chargers revamped their backfield this offseason by signing Najee Harris and selecting Hampton in the first round of the NFL Draft. However, Harris missed all of training camp due to an eye injury, so with him being at less than peak conditioning, Hampton should see the lion's share of touches early on, and perhaps, throughout the season.</p><p>Hampton, a standout at North Carolina, racked up 3,164 rushing yards and 30 touchdowns over his final two college seasons. He turned heads at the NFL Combine, clocking a 4.46-second 40-yard dash at 221 pounds, along with a 38-inch vertical and a 10-foot-10 broad jump -- showcasing his elite explosiveness. With an ideal blend of size, speed, and power, Hampton is a strong fit for Harbaugh's system and enters the season ranked as a top-25 fantasy back by the model. <a href=\"https://www.sportsline.com/nfl/cheat-sheets-and-rankings/#ttag=05042025_agg_cbssports_fantasy_football_nfl_model_cheatsheetscombined\" target=\"_blank\">See more Fantasy football breakouts 2025 here</a>.</p><h2>Top 2025 Fantasy football busts</h2><p>As for players to avoid, the model identifies Buffalo running back James Cook as one of its biggest 2025 Fantasy football busts. Cook was certainly a breakout last year, recording a whopping 16 touchdowns on the ground compared to two the prior season. Cook got paid this preseason, agreeing to a four-year, $48 million extension.</p><p>Can Cook replicate those numbers, however? His rushing yards actually went down in 2024 compared to 2023, and after scoring a combined four touchdowns in the 2022-23, getting to a number close to 16 against feels like a stretch, especially given Josh Allen's running ability. The latest 2025 Fantasy football ADP shows Cook going off in the second round, but SportsLine's model projects fourth-rounders James Conner and Alvin Kamara to produce more Fantasy points this season, making Cook one of the top 2025 Fantasy football busts to avoid. <a href=\"https://www.sportsline.com/nfl/cheat-sheets-and-rankings/#ttag=05042025_agg_cbssports_fantasy_football_nfl_model_cheatsheetscombined\" target=\"_blank\">See more Fantasy football busts 2025 here</a>.</p><h2>How to find proven 2025 Fantasy football rankings</h2><p>SportsLine is also extremely high on a surprising wide receiver you aren't even thinking about being taken in the early rounds of 2025 Fantasy football drafts. This wide receiver is listed as a shocking top-15 option ahead of stars like A.J. Brown and Tyreek Hill. <a href=\"https://www.sportsline.com/nfl/cheat-sheets-and-rankings/#ttag=05042025_agg_cbssports_fantasy_football_nfl_model_cheatsheetscombined\" target=\"_blank\">You can only see who it is, and the 2025 Fantasy football rankings for every player, at SportsLine</a>.</p><p><strong>So which 2025 Fantasy Football sleepers, breakouts and busts should you target and fade, and which WR shocks the NFL with a top-15 performance? <a href=\"https://www.sportsline.com/nfl/cheat-sheets-and-rankings/#ttag=05042025_agg_cbssports_fantasy_football_nfl_model_cheatsheetscombined\" target=\"_blank\">Visit SportsLine now to get 2025 Fantasy Football cheat sheets for every single position, all from the model that called C.J.
