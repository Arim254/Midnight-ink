    "body": "<div>\n        <p>For the second straight year, the NFL schedule has a Week 1 Friday night contest in Brazil. The three-time defending AFC champion Kansas City Chiefs are the road team while their AFC West division rivals, the Los Angeles Chargers, are at \"home\" in Brazil. The Chiefs have won each of the last seven meetings dating back to 2021, though six of the seven have been via one possession. The featured matchup is between the quarterbacks: Justin Herbert leads an improved Los Angeles team, while Patrick Mahomes continues his ascent among the greatest of all-time for Kansas City. The latest <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/odds/\">NFL odds</a> list Herbert's over/under for total passing attempts at 33.5, while Mahomes' over/under for his longest completion is 35.5 yards. </p><p>Kickoff for Chiefs vs. Chargers on Friday Night Football is set for 8 p.m. ET at Neo Quimica Arena in São Paulo, Brazil.

Also consider that the Chiefs' star quarterback has topped this total in six of his last eight games against the Chargers. Considering that Kansas City may struggle to run against Los Angeles' defensive line, it's conceivable to think that Mahomes may be asked to carry a heavier load in the passing game in Week 1. </p><h2>Ladd McConkey, Chargers, Over 71.5 receiving yards (-114)</h2><p>In his rookie season, McConkey topped 71 yards in six of his last seven games, including an impressive 9-197-1 performance in the Chargers loss to Houston in the AFC Wild Card playoff game. In his one appearance against the Chiefs in 2024, the 6'0\" receiver posted a 5-67-1 line but should see double-digit targets on Friday night. The model projects him at 92.9 yards, which is more than 20 yards above the oddsmakers' yardage line.</p><h2>Isiah Pacheco, Chiefs, Under 50.5 rushing yards (-114)</h2><p>The Chiefs were held below four yards per carry in their two games against Los Angeles last season. The model is projecting Kansas City's No. 1 running back to rush for 38.6 yards, well below his sportsbook total. With Kareem Hunt as the primary pass catching back, any second half deficit could keep Pacheco on the bench for long stretches and limit his chance to top 50 yards rushing.</p><h2>Want more Week 1 NFL picks?</h2><p><strong>You've seen the model's NFL picks for Chiefs vs. Chargers player props for Week 1.

The second-year LSU starter and reigning SEC completions leader went 28-for-38 for 230 yards and a touchdown against Clemson and capped off his night with what proved to be the decisive score: an 8-yard touchdown pass to <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/players/29390367/treydez-green/\">Trey'Dez Green</a>.</p><p>Nussmeier entered the Tigers vs. Tigers clash tied with Clemson's Cade Klubnik on the odds board and gained meaningful separation from him with a noticeably better performance. Stacking up ranked wins like that one would not only keep the potential first-round pick in front of the Heisman pack, but it would also finally cement LSU as a real national championship contender in Year 4 of the Brian Kelly era.</p><p>The early stages of the season allow for big leaps up the odds board, and it was a good week to be a victorious quarterback. Utah dazzled in a rout of <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/teams/UCLA/ucla-bruins/\">UCLA</a>, and dual-threat transfer Devon Dampier looked the part of a quarterback who could lead his team to a Big 12 title. He misfired just four times on 25 pass attempts, ran for 87 yards and found the end zone three times -- twice through the air and once on the ground. The market loved what it saw. Dampier's Heisman odds improved twofold from +5000 to +2500 in the matter of just one game.</p>\n<p>Dampier was the most dramatic riser, but a bevy of other quarterbacks made leaps worthy of recognition, too. Georgia's Gunner Stockton passed for two touchdowns and ran for two more to become the second-steepest climber behind Dampier. John Mateer, Carson Beck and Jackson Arnold all lived up to their transfer hype at their respective schools. LaNorris Sellers looked like a certified playmaker for South Carolina. And the Dante Moore era is off and running at Oregon in style.</p><h2>Stock down: Defensive battle hurts Manning, Ohio State</h2><p>The Manning hype dwindled quickly. He and the Texas offense are far, far away from being a lost cause, though. One bad game against what may very well be the best defense in <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://cbssports.com/college-football/\">college football</a> <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/news/resetting-arch-mannings-expectations-at-texas-in-2025-after-steve-sarkisian-says-hype-was-out-of-control/\">should not be cause for massive concern</a>, particularly because it came on the road in Manning's first outing as a full-time starter. His poor timing and head-scratching overthrows and underthrows do not have to define his season.</p><p>On the other side of that No. 1 vs. No. 3 showdown, it was not as though Ohio State's individual standouts got off to a hot start, either. Julian Sayin looked very much like a redshirt freshman making his first career start against an equally formidable defense, and for the second time in as many years, Jeremiah Smith was only a modest factor against the Longhorns. Neither bolstered their Heisman candidacy despite what was a gargantuan team result.</p>\n<p>Heisman voters will want to see more from Cade Klubnik the rest of the year, too. While he seemed down the stretch of the 2024 season to assuage the concerns surrounding his performance against top competition, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/news/clemsons-dabo-swinney-calls-out-cade-klubnik-says-biggest-problem-vs-lsu-was-best-player-didnt-play-well/\">he faltered in his first test of 2025</a>. The 50% completion rate and interception he logged against LSU were reminiscent of his struggles against Georgia a year ago and <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/teams/ND/notre-dame-fighting-irish/\">Notre Dame</a> the season prior.</p><figure><p><img alt=\"Texas v Ohio State\" src=\"https://sportshub.cbsistatic.com/i/r/2025/09/03/9d1dd8df-62de-4707-b613-ddfea5d58f60/resize/670x377/3d798bad3e7496115e9579737954ddfb/arch.jpg\" /></p><figcaption><span>Texas quarterback Arch Manning is no longer the Heisman favorite after last week's loss to Caleb Downs and Ohio State. </span><span>\n                                                                    Getty Images\n                                                            </span></figcaption></figure><h2>Week 2 performances to watch</h2><p>Last week was a treat with its flock of top-25 matchups. Week 2 is, um, a bit lighter on big-time showdowns. No. 15 <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/teams/MICH/michigan-wolverines/\">Michigan</a> and No. 18 Oklahoma will take center stage in a game that carries significant Heisman implications, though.</p><h3>John Mateer vs. Michigan</h3><p>Okay, John Mateer, you ripped an FCS defense to shreds. Now show us what you have against almighty Michigan. Mateer's Oklahoma debut was historic. He set the school record for most passing yards in a debut with 392 against <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/teams/ILST/illinois-state-redbirds/\">Illinois State</a> to go with three touchdowns, 24 rushing yards and another score on the ground. But the looming Wolverines are about as different of a beast as there is in college football. This is exactly the kind of game that Brent Venables brought Mateer in from <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/teams/WASHST/washington-state-cougars/\">Washington State</a> for, and it is precisely the type of all-eyes-on-me opportunity he needs to make a statement in front of Heisman voters.</p>\n<h3>Dante Moore vs. <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/teams/OKLAST/oklahoma-state-cowboys/\">Oklahoma State</a></h3><p>Dante Moore's last start against a Power Four opponent came in Nov. 2023, and he threw two interceptions in that game. This week will show how much growth he made in his developmental year at Oregon. Another good outing to open his starting stint with the Ducks would be a solid first step in proving he is a different player from the one that began his career at UCLA as an underwhelming five-star freshman. Oklahoma State's is a nice, soft defense to help him ease into Power Four action.</p><h3>Sam Leavitt vs. <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/teams/MISSST/mississippi-state-bulldogs/\">Mississippi State</a></h3><p>Arizona State heads to SEC country for the second leg of a home-and-home with Mississippi State -- the one opponent that truly had Sam Leavitt's number in 2024. The Bulldogs were the only team to hold the breakout star to fewer than 150 yards and one of just three to keep him out of the end zone through the air. Now, he did set a career high with two rushing scores in the win, but 69 passing yards against Mississippi State? <em>That</em> Mississippi State? The trendy Heisman dark horse needs a better effort in the rematch.</p>\n            </div>"

Most notably, leading scorer <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/wnba/players/26678082/kayla-thornton/\">Kayla Thornton</a> went down with a season-ending knee injury shortly after becoming the first All-Star in franchise history. </p>\n<h2>WNBA expansion teams' inaugural seasons</h2><table><tbody><tr><th>Season</th><th>Team</th><th>Record</th><th>Playoffs?</th></tr><tr><td><p><strong>2025</strong></p></td><td><p><strong>Valkyries</strong></p></td><td><p><strong>23-18</strong></p></td><td><p><strong>Yes</strong></p></td></tr><tr><td><p>1998 </p></td><td><p><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/wnba/teams/TLS/tulsa-shock/\">Shock</a></p></td><td><p>17-13</p></td><td><p>No</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>1999 </p></td><td><p>Miracle</p></td><td><p>15-17</p></td><td><p>No</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>1999</p></td><td><p><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/wnba/teams/MIN/minnesota-lynx/\">Lynx</a></p></td><td><p>15-17</p></td><td><p>No</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>2000</p></td><td><p>Sol</p></td><td><p>13-19</p></td><td><p>No</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>2003</p></td><td><p><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/wnba/teams/SA/san-antonio-silver-stars/\">Silver Stars</a></p></td><td><p>12-22</p></td><td><p>No</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>2000</p></td><td><p>Fire</p></td><td><p>10-22</p></td><td><p>No</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>2000</p></td><td><p><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/wnba/teams/IND/indiana-fever/\">Fever</a></p></td><td><p>9-23</p></td><td><p>No</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>2000</p></td><td><p><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/wnba/teams/SEA/seattle-storm/\">Storm</a></p></td><td><p>6-26</p></td><td><p>No</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>2006</p></td><td><p><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/wnba/teams/CHI/chicago-sky/\">Sky</a></p></td><td><p>5-29</p></td><td><p>No</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>2008</p></td><td><p>Dream</p></td><td><p>4-30</p></td><td><p>No</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>1999</p></td><td><p><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/wnba/teams/WAS/washington-mystics/\">Mystics</a></p></td><td><p>3-27</p></td><td><p>No</p></td></tr></tbody></table><p>As expected, the Valkyries' offense has been a major issue at times this season.

They lead the league in field goal defense, and are holding opponents to just 40.4% from the field, which would be the be lowest opponent field goal percentage since the 2020 Seattle Storm (40.1%).

    "body": "<div>\n        <p>Entering this summer, Amanda Anisimova had never been to a slam final. Now, she's heading to her second in three months. The 24-year-old American is into the US Open women's singles final with a 6-7(4), 7-6(3), 6-3 win over No. 23 Naomi Osaka.</p><p>Anisimova will face No. 1 seed Aryna Sabalenka in Saturday's final.</p><p>\"This has been a dream of mine, like, forever is to be in the US Open final,\" Anisimova told ESPN on her on-court interview. \"Obviously the hope is to be the champion, but I'm in the final now, and I'm gonna try to get ready, but I'm just excited. It's really special.\"</p><p>Osaka broke Anisimova in the first game of the match. After Anisimova took a 30-0 lead, she committed four straight unforced errors, including a double fault.</p><p>Down 0-40 on her second service game and in danger of letting things get out of control early, Anisimova fought off three break points to remain just one break down, and she promptly broke Osaka back to get on serve. Osaka would break right back, though, as both players had issues with their serve.</p>\n<p>Serving for the set up 5-4, Osaka fell down 0-40, and Anisimova converted her second break point opportunity of the game, jumping all over an Osaka second serve.</p><p>The momentum quickly swung the other way in the tiebreaker, though: down 2-1, Anisimova double faulted and then put a relatively straightforward forehand into the net. That was more than enough room for Osaka to win the tiebreaker comfortably, 7-4.</p><p>The second set began with a pair of breaks and then a pair of holds before Anisimova got up a break when Osaka sent a shot long. The No. 23 seed slammed a tennis ball onto the court in frustration.</p>\n<p>Osaka's frustration continued to simmer -- she slammed her racket into the ground a couple of times -- during the next game, but she ended up breaking back anyway. Again, it wasn't the most beautiful tennis Arthur Ashe Stadium has ever seen.</p><p>The seesaw match tilted back in Anisimova's favor in the ninth game of the second set. Down 40-0, she ripped off six straight points, the last one featuring some marvelous defense, to go up a break, 5-4.</p><p>This time, though, it was Anisimova's turn to fail to serve out the set, another double fault allowing Osaka to get back on serve.</p>\n<p>In the second-set tiebreak, Anisimova was the one taking control with a quick 4-0 lead. She closed out the set on an Osaka unforced error.</p><p>Osaka headed back to the locker room between the second and third set and appeared to be dealing with a foot issue -- a trainer came out early in the third set -- as Anisimova went up an early break.</p><p>This time, Anisimova would not give her hard-earned break back. Serving for the match, Anisimova unleashed big serves and the crisp, powerful ground strokes that have fueled her rise. After failing to convert two match points -- and even facing two break points herself -- Anisimova unleashed a pair of strong forehand winners to close things out.</p>\n<p>Anisimova will be looking to improve on her first performance in a slam final; at the Wimbledon final in July, she lost 6-0, 6-0 to Iga Swiatek. Anisimova, who beat Swiatek in the US Open quarters Wednesday, is the first woman to reach a slam final after losing the previous slam's final 6-0, 6-0.</p><p>She needed all that resilience, and then some, against Osaka, who has been plenty resilient herself throughout this tournament, her deepest slam run since winning the 2021 Australian Open.</p><p>\"Naomi is playing amazing tennis,\" Anisimova said. \"She's back where she belongs. I just told her I'm so proud of her after having a baby and playing at this level. It's insane.\"</p>\n<p>Anisimova is 6-3 against Sabalenka, including a three-set win over her at Wimbledon.</p>\n            </div>"

Wait, nope. I stand corrected. The Browns still haven't won a division title since 1989, the Cowboys still haven't been to a Super Bowl since 1995 and the Jets are still in the middle of a playoff drought. </p><p>Time is a flat circle. </p><p><em>Bet NFL Week 1 games at <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/betting/news/draftkings-promo-code/\">DraftKings</a>, where new users get $300 in bonus bets and over $200 off NFL Sunday Ticket. <a href=\"https://martech.cbssports.com/bt/redirect/prod?b=draftkings&amp;c=sport\" target=\"_blank\">Click here to get started</a>:</em></p><p>The good news for the Browns is that this surely is going to be the year where their drought ends and I'm basing my entire theory on the fact that a guy from Cleveland (<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/1725130/travis-kelce/\">Travis Kelce</a>) just got engaged to the most famous singer on the planet (Taylor Swift). </p>\n<p>Everything is coming up Cleveland this year. </p><p>Is this actually going to be the year of the Browns? </p><p>That's a great question, and you <span><a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/news/2024-nfl-predictions-final-record-for-all-32-teams-super-bowl-lix-pick-playoff-matchups-and-mvp-winner/\" target=\"_blank\">can find the answer by clicking here to see my predictions</a></span> for the entire 2025 <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://cbssports.com/nfl/\">NFL</a> season.

Spoiler alert: I'm not taking the Browns.  </p>\n<p>For those you clicking over to read my predictions, we'll wait here until you get back. </p><p>All right, welcome back. Let's get to the Week 1 picks. </p><h2>NFL Week 1 picks</h2><h2>Cowboys at <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/PHI/philadelphia-eagles/\">Eagles</a> </h2><p><strong>Thursday, 8:20 p.m. ET (NBC, Stream: </strong><a href=\"https://www.fubo.tv/welcome/leagues/191277?irad=356362&amp;irmp=416484&amp;sharedid=HTW\" target=\"_blank\">Fubo</a>, try for free<strong>)</strong></p>\n<p>If there's one rule in the NFL that every team should always follow, it's NEVER TRADE AWAY YOUR BEST DEFENSIVE PLAYER ONE WEEK BEFORE THE START OF THE SEASON. Jerry Jones broke that rule. </p>\n<p>Great question, Micah. No one knows. </p><p>I'm not saying Jerry Jones is trying to run the team into the ground, but I'm also not not saying that. I would say that sending Parsons to Green Bay was the worst trade that anyone in Dallas has ever made, but that would be a lie because the Mavericks exist. </p>\n<p>So how will the loss of Parsons impact this game? The Cowboys gave up the fourth-most rushing yards in the NFL last year and I can't imagine that number is going to improve after the loss of Parsons. The first test for the Cowboys defense will be <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/2185957/saquon-barkley/\">Saquon Barkley</a> and an Eagles rushing attack that averaged 179.3 yards per game last season, which ranked first in the NFC and second in the NFL. </p><p>If the Eagles are smart, they'll just give Barkley 49 carries in this game and call it a night. The only chance the Cowboys have to win is if <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/1824864/dak-prescott/\">Dak Prescott</a> throws for 500 yards, which actually might happen. Not only will Dak be throwing to <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/2865251/ceedee-lamb/\">CeeDee Lamb</a>, but the Cowboys also have <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/3123212/george-pickens/\">George Pickens</a>, who came to Dallas in a trade back in March (Someone in the Cowboys' front office should have taken Jerry's phone away after that trade so he couldn't make any more deals). </p><p>The Eagles secondary is still a massive question mark, so Lamb and Pickens could both have big games. </p>\n<p>One other thing working in the Cowboys' advantage is the fact that Prescott is 4-1 in his past five starts against Eagles. On paper, the Eagles are definitely the better team heading into Thursday, but I stopped using paper three years ago, so I'm not going to pretend like the Cowboys can't pull off the upset here. </p><p>The Eagles will be raising their Super Bowl banner on Thursday night and if the Cowboys somehow pull off the upset just seven days after Jerry gave away <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/2967590/micah-parsons/\">Micah Parsons</a>, we will never hear the end of it. Jerry Jones will look like a genius and I'm not sure we're ready to live in a world where Jerry looks like a genius. For the good of America, the Eagles need to take down America's Team. </p><p><strong>THE PICK:</strong> Eagles 34-24 over Cowboys | <strong>Odds via </strong><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/betting/news/caesars-promo-code/\"><strong>Caesars Sportsbook</strong></a><strong>, where you can <a href=\"https://martech.cbssports.com/bt/redirect/prod?b=caesars&amp;c=sport\" target=\"_blank\">get 20 100% profit boosts with the promo code CBS20X</a>.

I normally only watch cat videos and old episodes of \"Saved by the Bell\" on YouTube, so this will be a nice change of pace for me.  </p><p>Anyway, the best part about the NFL now playing an annual game in Brazil is that I get to remind you every year about the fact that I played an extra in a movie that took place in Brazil. I was a train passenger in \"Fast Five\" and I was so good that the Academy actually thought about introducing a new category for \"Best train passenger,\" which I would have been a lock to win because no one has ever played a train passenger better, except maybe Brad Pitt in \"Bullet Train.\"</p>\n<p>I'm not sure if being in that movie makes me an expert on all things Brazil, but I'm going to assume it does. And when it comes to <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://cbssports.com/nfl/scoreboard/\">NFL games</a> in Brazil, I'm also en expert there: I'm 1-0 with my Brazilian picks. </p>\n<p>This feels like a game that's going to come down to the play of each team's left tackle. For the Chargers, they used to have one of the best left tackles in the NFL in <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/2835704/rashawn-slater/\">Rashawn Slater</a>, but he suffered a <span><a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/news/chargers-star-lt-rashawn-slater-to-miss-2025-season-after-suffering-torn-patellar-tendon-in-practice/\" target=\"_blank\">season-ending injury in August when he tore his Patellar tendon</a></span>. So now, the Chargers will be moving their right tackle from last season, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/26713136/joe-alt/\">Joe Alt</a>, over to left tackle. And to fill Alt's spot, they're moving their right guard from last season, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/3116462/trey-pipkins/\">Trey Pipkins</a>, to right tackle. </p><p>As for the Chiefs, the last time we saw them on the field came in Super Bowl LIX in a game where <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/2142052/patrick-mahomes/\">Patrick Mahomes</a> got destroyed. He was sacked six times and a big reason that happened is because the Chief offensive line couldn't stop anyone. The Chiefs used four different left tackles last season, which isn't ideal, because that's not a position where you want to be using four different players. To fix the problem, the Chiefs used a first-round pick on <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/3116779/josh-simmons/\">Josh Simmons</a>, who will be making the first start of his career on Friday. </p><p>I fully expect that both quarterbacks will be facing constant pressure in this game, and in that situation, I trust Mahomes slightly more than I trust <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/2221960/justin-herbert/\">Justin Herbert</a>. OK, a lot more. </p>\n<p>Every team that has ever won in Brazil has gone on to win the Super Bowl that year, so that seems like a good thing for the Chiefs. </p><p><strong>THE PICK:</strong> Chiefs 23-20 over Chargers | <strong>Odds via <span><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/betting/news/draftkings-promo-code/\">DraftKings Sportsbook</a></span> (</strong><em><strong>where new users <a href=\"https://martech.cbssports.com/bt/redirect/prod?b=draftkings&amp;c=sport\" target=\"_blank\">get $300 in bonus bets and over $200 off NFL Sunday Ticket</a>):</strong></em></p><h2><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/DET/detroit-lions/\">Lions</a> at <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/GB/green-bay-packers/\">Packers</a></h2><p><strong>4:25 p.m. ET (CBS, Stream on <a href=\"https://www.paramountplus.com/shows/nfl-on-cbs/?ftag=PPM-22-10bdd6c\" target=\"_blank\">Paramount+</a>)</strong></p>\n<p>For the first time in 25 years, the Packers are opening their season with a game on CBS. Does that make us the biggest winner of the Micah Parsons trade? Yes. I think you could say that because it means that we'll be televising Micah Parsons' first game with the Packers. But that's only if he plays. </p>\n<p>The weird thing about the Parsons trade is that I'm not sure Parsons is actually going to help the Packers his week. For one, he's not in football shape because he hasn't practiced in nearly three months. The only way to get into football shape is to play football and by the time this game rolls around, Parsons will only have four days of practice under his belt. Also, Parsons still has to learn Green Bay's entire defensive playbook. And he has to do all that while battling a bad back. </p>\n<p>Um, did Jerry Jones win this trade? I might have to take back everything about Jerry Jones earlier. Give that man the GM of the year award. </p><p>Based on Parsons' back situation, I'll be shocked if he's on the field for even a quarter of the Packers' defensive plays in this game, so basically, for at least this week, I don't think Parsons is going to have a huge impact. </p>\n<p>Last season, the Packers were either the best bad team or the worst good team. I've had nine months to think about it and I'm still not sure. They went 11-1 against teams that finished with 10 wins or less, but 0-6 against teams that won 11 games or more. They also went just 1-5 in the NFC North. </p><p>One problem for the Packers is that Matt LaFleur hasn't been able to figure out how to beat the Lions with Detroit winning six of the past seven games in this series.</p><p>The Lions definitely have some question marks -- they have to replace both coordinators, they have a rookie at right guard (<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/3163956/tate-ratledge/\">Tate Ratledge</a>) and their starting center retired -- but they will have <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/2968514/aidan-hutchinson/\">Aidan Hutchinson</a> back and I feel like his return will push Detroit to the win. </p>\n<p>The Lions have won three straight in Green Bay and if they win this game, they might as well change the name of the stadium to \"Lionbeau field.\" And yes, I'm already working to trademark that. </p><p><strong>THE PICK: </strong>Lions 20-16 over Packers | <strong>Odds via <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/betting/news/fanduel-promo-code/\">FanDuel Sportsbook</a>, where new users <a href=\"https://martech.cbssports.com/bt/redirect/prod?b=fanduel&amp;c=sport\" target=\"_blank\">get $300 in bonus bets after a winning $5 wager</a>:</strong></p><h2><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/HOU/houston-texans/\">Texans</a> at <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/LAR/los-angeles-rams/\">Rams</a> </h2><p><strong>4:25 p.m. ET (CBS, Stream on <a href=\"https://www.paramountplus.com/shows/nfl-on-cbs/?ftag=PPM-22-10bdd6c\" target=\"_blank\">Paramount+</a>)</strong></p>\n<p>Back in July, I was thinking about picking the Rams to win the Super Bowl this year, but then I found out that <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/1114942/matthew-stafford/\">Matthew Stafford</a> currently has the back of an 87-year-old man, which might actually be insulting to 87-year-old men. I feel like this game -- and the Rams' entire season -- is going to come down to whether Matthew Stafford's back can survive the beating it's going to take. </p><p>What is wrong with Matthew Stafford's back you ask? Everything. At least, that's what it seems like. The Rams held their first practice of training camp on July 23, but Stafford wasn't there due to his back. As a matter of fact, Stafford didn't take part in a single practice with the team in training camp until Aug. 18. Not only that, but before he started practicing, he was spending half his time hanging out in a giant camper that was spotted at the Rams' practice facility. </p>\n<p>I'm not sure what you were told Matt, but that looks like a souped up Airstream trailer and I've slept in enough Airstream trailers to know that they won't fix your back problems. If anything, they only make them worse. </p><p>So Stafford has a bad back and oh yea, he still hasn't TAKEN A HIT this year, so we have no idea how his back is going to handle that. </p><p>If you have a bad back, the Texans are probably the last team you want to be facing in Week 1. There were only 11 players in the NFL last season who totaled 11 sacks or more and two of those guys are on Houston's defense (<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/3161880/will-anderson-jr/\">Will Anderson Jr</a>. and <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/1984262/danielle-hunter/\">Danielle Hunter</a>).</p><p>The Texans also have one of the few secondaries in the NFL that should be able to go toe-to-toe with <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/1893167/davante-adams/\">Davante Adams</a> and <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/3121687/puka-nacua/\">Puka Nacua</a>, so even if Stafford's back holds up, don't expect him to put up big numbers. The other thing to like about the Texans is that head coach <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/420098/demeco-ryans/\">DeMeco Ryans</a> is very familar with Sean McVay's offense. Ryans spent two seasons as the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/SF/san-francisco-49ers/\">49ers</a>' defensive coordinator and during those two years, the 49ers had a 4-0 regular-season record against the Rams while holding McVay's offense to just 14.25 points per game.</p><p><strong>THE PICK: </strong>Texans 19-17 over Rams | <strong>Odds via <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/betting/news/betmgm-promo-code/\">BetMGM</a>, where you can <a href=\"https://martech.cbssports.com/bt/redirect/prod?b=betmgm&amp;c=sport\" target=\"_blank\">get up to $1,500 back in bonus bets if your first football wager loses</a>:</strong></p><h2><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/BAL/baltimore-ravens/\">Ravens</a> at <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/BUF/buffalo-bills/\">Bills</a></h2><p><strong>8:20 p.m. ET (NBC, Stream: </strong><a href=\"https://www.fubo.tv/welcome/leagues/191277?irad=356362&amp;irmp=416484&amp;sharedid=HTW\" target=\"_blank\">Fubo</a>, try for free<strong>) </strong></p>\n<p>I love both of these teams this year and I don't want to pick this game because I don't want to be forced to pick either one of them to lose.

If you haven't checked out my season preview, <span><a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/news/2025-nfl-predictions-final-record-for-all-32-teams-super-bowl-lx-pick-playoff-matchups-and-mvp-winner/\" target=\"_blank\">you can do that here</a></span>. </p><p>The last time we saw these two teams on the field together came in January in the divisional round of the playoffs in a game that Buffalo ended up winning because <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/2131121/mark-andrews/\">Mark Andrews</a> forgot how to catch a football. </p>\n<p>Ouch. That's painful. Sorry I made you watch that again Ravens' fans. </p><p>Now, even if Andrews had caught that pass, the Bills still would have had 1:33 to drive down for a game-winning field goal, so there's no guarantee that Baltimore would have won, so let's not blame Andrews for the loss. Instead, I'm going to credit Bills' coach Sean McDermott for the win. </p><p>Before taking the Bills' head coaching job, McDermott spent eight years as an NFL defensive coordinator and it certainly shows whenever the Bills face <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/2239671/lamar-jackson/\">Lamar Jackson</a>. Over the past five years, Jackson has gone 1-3 against the Bills. In those four games, he's turned the ball over a total of six times (four interceptions, two lost fumbles) while averaging just 179 yards passing per game (He's also rushed for an average of 50 yards per game). </p><p>In the Bills' three wins, the Ravens have averaged just 16 points per game. There is no stopping Lamar Jackson, but McDermott has certainly figured out how to slow him down. On the flip side, the Ravens have also done a good job of slowing down <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/2181054/josh-allen/\">Josh Allen</a>. The Bills QB had one of his worst games of the season last year in a 35-10 regular-season loss to the Ravens, but that game was in Baltimore. </p><p>The one thing about Allen, who's the reigning NFL MVP, is that he's been nearly unbeatable in Buffalo: He's won 11 straight home starts in the regular season and I feel like he's going to push that streak to 12 on Sunday night. </p><p><strong>THE PICK:</strong> Bills 30-23 over Ravens | <strong>Odds via <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/betting/news/fanduel-promo-code/\">FanDuel Sportsbook</a></strong></p><h2>NFL Week 1 picks: All the rest</h2><p><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/TB/tampa-bay-buccaneers/\">Buccaneers</a> 27-24 over <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/ATL/atlanta-falcons/\">Falcons</a><br /><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/CIN/cincinnati-bengals/\">Bengals</a> 20-17 over Browns<br /><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/IND/indianapolis-colts/\">Colts</a> 19-16 over <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/MIA/miami-dolphins/\">Dolphins</a><br /><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/NE/new-england-patriots/\">Patriots</a> 23-16 over <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/LV/las-vegas-raiders/\">Raiders</a><br /><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/ARI/arizona-cardinals/\">Cardinals</a> 31-13 over <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/NO/new-orleans-saints/\">Saints</a><br /><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/PIT/pittsburgh-steelers/\">Steelers</a> 24-13 over Jets<br /><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/WAS/washington-commanders/\">Commanders</a> 26-23 over <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/NYG/new-york-giants/\">Giants</a><br /><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/JAC/jacksonville-jaguars/\">Jaguars</a> 27-20 over <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/CAR/carolina-panthers/\">Panthers</a><br /><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/DEN/denver-broncos/\">Broncos</a> 30-10 over <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/TEN/tennessee-titans/\">Titans</a><br />49ers 24-16 over <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/SEA/seattle-seahawks/\">Seahawks</a><br /><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/CHI/chicago-bears/\">Bears</a> 22-19 over <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/MIN/minnesota-vikings/\">Vikings</a></p><h2>Last Week </h2><p><strong>Best pick:</strong>  If you just read through all of my picks and you're now thinking, \"Wow, I wish I could read this guy every day,\" you're in luck, because you can!

    "body": "<div>\n        <p>FRISCO, Texas -- New <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/DAL/dallas-cowboys/\">Dallas Cowboys</a> head coach Brian Schottenheimer has operated like a poker player this offseason when it comes to giving away insight about his offense in 2025.</p><p>He's spoken about using a \"seven iron\" and maintaining a \"vanilla\" offense in the preseason, keeping his cards close to the vest. Just a short time away from the Cowboys kicking off the 2025 <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://cbssports.com/nfl/\">NFL</a> season on Thursday at the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://cbssports.com/nfl/superbowl/\">Super Bowl</a> LIX champion <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/PHI/philadelphia-eagles/\">Philadelphia Eagles</a>, some of those cards are coming down on the table, particularly regarding his starting running back position. </p><p>Free agent acquisition <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/2961719/javonte-williams/\">Javonte Williams</a>, the 25-year-old former second-round pick of the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/DEN/denver-broncos/\">Denver Broncos</a> in 2021, lined up with the Cowboys first-team offense in organized team activities, mandatory minicamp, training camp and in warmups out at practice in the past week taking handoffs from quarterback <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/1824864/dak-prescott/\">Dak Prescott</a>. Williams is also the only running back on the roster Dallas held out of the preseason entirely. </p><p>That's why Schottenheimer all but confirmed Williams' status as the team's RB1 when CBS Sports asked the head coach on Tuesday about Williams' ability to handle a lead running back role. Williams was the Broncos' leading rusher in 2024 with 513 yards and four rushing touchdowns on 139 carries (3.7 yards per carry), but it wasn't individually a eyepopping year for a Denver team that broke through to reach the postseason for the first time since winning <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://cbssports.com/nfl/superbowl/\">Super Bowl</a> 50 in 2015. The question is also worth asking because he got thrown off course by an ACL and MCL tear in 2022. Williams' 4.4 yards per touch through the last four years is the third-fewest in the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://cbssports.com/nfl/\">NFL</a> (minimum 750 touches) and ahead of only <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/2060769/ezekiel-elliotts/\">Ezekiel Elliott's</a> 4.1 yards per touch and <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/2741200/najee-harris/\">Najee Harris</a>' 4.3 yards per touch in that span. </p>\n<p>\"I have no questions about it [Williams' ability to carry a lead running back workload],\" Schottenheimer said. \"He's played plenty of football. We practice very physically when we have pads on. On Wednesday [last week], we were running an inside run and safety <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/26694904/alijah-clark/\">Alijah Clark</a> came running down, and Alijah had gotten him a couple plays earlier. Tae got a little high, and Alijah got him. Tae got a little lower [the second time], and Alijah felt it. So I don't worry about Javonte. He plays the game one way. He's physical, and he plays it with passion and really good pad level.\"</p><p>\"He's as advertised,\" Cowboys offensive coordinator Klayton Adams said on Monday.</p><a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/news/priscos-week-1-nfl-picks-bills-outlast-ravens-jets-beat-aaron-rodgers-and-bears-ruin-j-j-mccarthys-debut/\" target=\"_blank\">\n        <div>\n            <div>\n                <p>Prisco's Week 1 NFL picks: Bills outlast Ravens, Jets beat Aaron Rodgers and Bears ruin J.J.

The<a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/fantasy/football/stats/RB/2025/tp/projections/ppr/\" target=\"_blank\"> latest projections </a>have Williams listed as the NFL's RB43 in terms of projected fantasy points per game with an average of 7.5 PPR points per game.</p>\n<p>\"I just expect to make plays when I'm out there,\" Williams said of what to expect from him in Week 1. \"It kind of caught me by surprise [being held out of the preseason]. I didn't expect it, but whatever the coaches do,  I respect it. They know I'm going to go out there and give it my all whenever my number is called, so it was cool. ... It just shows the confidence and trust that they have in me. I just got to repay them for it.\"  </p><p>Williams earned the confidence of both Prescott and the Cowboys coaching staff thanks to his swift pick up of Schottenheimer's playbook. He has always been a quick study dating all the way back to high school where he graduated as his class' valedictorian at Wallace-Rose Hill High School in Teachey, North Carolina back in 2018. He posted a 4.6 GPA.   </p><p>\"Just a true pro. Another guy that, whether it be in the locker room or in meetings or on the field, doesn't say a lot, but is always doing the right thing and finishing the right way. Seeing him at camp, when he gets the ball and when he can, he's going to finish to the 30, 40 yards, whatever it is, just in practice and doing everything the right way,\" Prescott said of Williams on Sunday. \"He's super, super smart. I call him valedictorian-Tae. That's what he is. That's not just a saying. He was a valedictorian. The guy's smart at running back and can make plays and [I'm] super excited for him to play. Super excited, can't you tell?\"</p>\n<p>Prescott first unveiled that nickname for Williams in front of Schottenheimer back in mandatory minicamp. The 25-year-old running back's ability to pick up the finer points of Schottenheimer's offense quickly, specifically in pass protection, has had the first-year head coach amped up all offseason, dating back to the end of mandatory minicamp in June. </p><p>\"It's funny,\" Schottenheimer said on June 12. \"I was talking, I was calling a play to Dak, and I was telling [him] to remind Javonte [about something]. I said, 'Hey remind Javonte,' and [Prescott] kind of looked at me and said, 'He's a valedictorian.' Javonte looked back and smiled.\"</p><p>Williams lit up when CBS Sports asked him about the minicamp exchange. It's little moments like that exchange that highlight why Williams is set to be entrusted to be Dallas' starting running back. </p>\n<p>\"It just showed the confidence that they have in me,\" Williams said. \"I got the same type of confidence in them. Being a new guy, it means a lot coming from someone [Prescott] like that and Coach Schotty. People that have a reputation around the league. I like it here. I'm comfortable, and I'm just ready to play.\"</p><p>A similar occurrence went down in practice within the last few weeks following the team's return to The Star, the team's facility, after their regular training camp stay in Oxnard, California.  </p><p>\"It's funny, I'll tell you a quick story about Javonte,\" Schottenheimer said. \"We were doing a move the ball drill period a week ago, I think one of the Frisco practices [open to fans at night on Aug. 19 and 20], and I kind of pulled a play we hadn't run in a while. I was kind of staying back behind the huddle and I said, 'Hey, Javonte, you have this,' and he looked back and said, 'Schotty, I got you. I got it.' He gives you confidence, and I think he gives Dak [Prescott] confidence. And I think that's what you love about the guy. His preparation is top notch.\"</p>\n<p>After not playing a single snap in the preseason and now being three years removed from his gruesome knee injury, he's ready to show his body is just as sharp as mind Thursday night in Philadelphia. </p><p>\"I feel good, healthy. I feel like this is as good as I'm going to get,\" he said. \"I'm just ready to go and ready to get out there.\"  </p>\n            </div>"

Dallas, therefore, enters this game with a new-look defense that will try to slow down an offense featuring last season's NFL Offensive Player of the Year and other stars who line up all across both sides of the team -- from the offensive line to the receiving corps and the quarterback.</p><p><em>Bet NFL Week 1 games and <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/odds/\" target=\"_blank\">NFL odds</a> at <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/betting/news/draftkings-promo-code/\">DraftKings</a>, where new users get $300 in bonus bets and over $200 off NFL Sunday Ticket. <a href=\"https://martech.cbssports.com/bt/redirect/prod?b=draftkings&amp;c=sport&amp;sid=2bbe9060-429f-4d9c-ab9a-d1890a32c673--c943\" target=\"_blank\">Click here to get started</a>:</em></p><p>The Eagles lost several players from their championship defense but return a significant portion of their core. They'll be taking on a Cowboys offense that has a bunch of new faces -- led by wide receiver George Pickens -- as well, one that should look significantly different than it did a year ago. Beyond the personnel changes, Brian Schottenheimer steps in for ousted coach Mike McCarthy as the former offensive coordinator now gets to hold the primary whistle for America's Team.</p>\n<p>Before we break down the matchup, here's a look at how you can watch the game.</p><h2>Where to watch Cowboys vs. Eagles</h2><ul><li><strong>Date: </strong>Thursday, Sept. 4 | <strong>Time:</strong> 8:20 p.m. ET</li><li><strong>Location: </strong>Lincoln Financial Field (Philadelphia)</li><li><strong>TV: </strong>NBC | <strong>Stream: </strong><a href=\"https://www.fubo.tv/welcome/leagues/191277?irad=356362&amp;irmp=416484&amp;sharedid=HTW\" target=\"_blank\">Fubo</a><strong> </strong>(Try for free) </li><li><strong>Follow: </strong><a href=\"https://apps.apple.com/us/app/cbs-sports-app-scores-news/id307184892\" target=\"_blank\">CBS Sports App</a></li><li><strong>Odds:</strong> Eagles -7.5; O/U 47.5 (via <span><a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/betting/news/draftkings-promo-code/\" target=\"_blank\">DraftKings Sportsbook</a></span>)</li></ul><h2>When the Cowboys have the ball</h2><p><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/1824864/dak-prescott/\">Dak Prescott</a> was injured for both games against the Eagles last year, so we didn't get to see what he looked like against this version of Vic Fangio's defense. He's faced a Fangio defense three times in his career, per Tru Media, going 58 of 95 for 733 yards, five touchdowns and an interception. He didn't do well at all against the Fangio-led <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/DEN/denver-broncos/\">Broncos</a> in 2021, but performed very well against the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/CHI/chicago-bears/\">Bears</a> in 2016 and the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/MIA/miami-dolphins/\">Dolphins</a> in 2023. </p><p>It'll be fascinating to see them square off here, simply because Fangio's style of defense seems so well constructed to play against this particular version of the Cowboys offense. Fangio tends to play light boxes and invite the opposing offense to run the football, confident that his front can handle that aspect of things, and then overload the deeper zones of the field with coverage defenders. </p><p>This should work perfectly against Dallas, which essentially threw away the running back position again this year by rolling with <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/2961719/javonte-williams/\">Javonte Williams</a>, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/2251305/miles-sanders/\">Miles Sanders</a> and fifth-round pick <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/28875227/jaydon-blue/\">Jaydon Blue</a>.

And despite Schottenheimer's offseason proclamations, it should be one of the highest-volume passing games as well. (Again, they are not going to run the ball very well. And their defense is going to be ... not good. They're going to have to throw the ball a ton.)

Lamb does a lot of work in the slot, but will Dallas kick him outside, where the Eagles have a question mark across from <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/3163404/quinyon-mitchell/\">Quinyon Mitchell</a>, rather than having him work most often against <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/26699677/cooper-dejean/\">Cooper DeJean</a>?

As we wrote <span><a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/news/cowboys-wont-learn-from-the-micah-parsons-debacle-because-jerry-jones-doesnt-want-to-learn-from-it/\" target=\"_blank\">last week</a></span>: The Cowboys were, by EPA per play, the NFL's single-best defense in the snaps where Parsons was on the field during his four-year run in Dallas. In the snaps where he was off the field during that same span, Dallas ranked dead last in EPA per play.</p>\n<p>The Eagles, meanwhile, are an offensive machine designed to ram the ball down their opponents' throats. While Kenny Clark may improve the Dallas run defense, he is certainly not going to fix it single-handedly. There are minus run defenders elsewhere on the field, and Clark's presence for something like 60-80% of the snaps is not going to alleviate the issues entirely. Philly's offensive line is a group of maulers that should be expected to maul Dallas up front, clearing the way for <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/2185957/saquon-barkley/\">Saquon Barkley</a> and <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/2240246/jalen-hurts/\">Jalen Hurts</a> to do their thing.</p><p>Barkley had a muted performance in his first game against the Cowboys last year (14 carries for 66 yards in a blowout win), but torched them in the latter game (31 carries for 167 yards). Combined, he ran 45 times for 233 yards, which is about 5.2 yards a pop. If he comes close to that efficiency on Thursday night, it's going to be a long evening for the Cowboys. </p><p>Hurts found tremendous rushing success in that first game against the Cowboys (he didn't play in the latter contest), with seven carries for 56 yards and two touchdowns. It's notable that the Cowboys generally struggled to contain the quarterback run game over the last few years, yielding 4.6 yards per designed rush and 7.9 yards per scramble, via Tru Media. Matt Eberflus' Bears defenses did a better job in that area (3.9 and 6.6 yards, respectively), but he now has Dallas' personnel to work with. </p>\n<p><em>Bet Eagles vs. Cowboys at BetMGM, where you can get up to $1,500 in bonus bets if you don't win. <a href=\"https://martech.cbssports.com/bt/redirect/prod?b=betmgm&amp;c=sport\" target=\"_blank\">Get started here</a>:</em></p><p>The Cowboys will also need their suddenly-depleted front to come up with a pass rush, and that will be <span><a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/news/will-the-cowboys-still-be-able-to-rush-the-passer-after-dealing-micah-parsons/\" target=\"_blank\">easier said than done</a></span>. Without Parsons, the edge-rush group consists of Dante Fowler Jr., <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/3126828/marshawn-kneeland/\">Marshawn Kneeland</a>, Sam Williams, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/26701231/donovan-ezeiruaku/\">Donovan Ezeiruaku</a> and <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/2767485/james-houston/\">James Houston</a>. One way to generate more pass rush is by blitzing, but new defensive coordinator Matt Eberflus runs a system that sends blitzes at a below-average rate. During his three years in Chicago, the Bears blitzed at only the 23rd-highest rate in the NFL, and during his four-year stint as the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/IND/indianapolis-colts/\">Colts</a>' defensive coordinator, they blitzed at the third-lowest rate in the league. So the idea that the Cowboys are going to send extra rushers to make up for Parsons' absence doesn't really pass the smell test. </p><p>All of these factors point to it being wildly unlikely that the Cowboys will get much pressure on Hurts on Thursday night. The offensive line was going to be difficult to penetrate to begin with, and now Dallas is shorthanded compared with where we thought the defense would be heading into the matchup. </p>\n<p>And if Hurts has time to sit in the pocket and throw, things are not going to go well for Dallas, because the secondary is going to be heavily tested -- and it isn't in the best shape at the moment. <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/2252834/trevon-diggs/\">Trevon Diggs</a> is <span><a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/news/week-1-nfl-injury-report-cowboys-get-good-news-on-trevon-diggs-for-season-opener-eagles-without-backup-qb/\" target=\"_blank\">surprisingly going to play</a></span> after spending the offseason rehabbing a serious knee injury, but he'll likely be joined at outside corner by <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/BUF/buffalo-bills/\">Bills</a> cast-off <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/3125782/kaiir-elam/\">Kaiir Elam</a>. </p><p>Those two will be the primary guys defending <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/2258303/a-j-brown/\">A.J. Brown</a> and <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/2866975/devonta-smith/\">DeVonta Smith</a>, because $92 million man <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/2830003/daron-bland/\">DaRon Bland</a> is probably going to play the slot when the Cowboys are in nickel looks. (Brown went for eight receptions, 145 yards and a score against Dallas last year, while Smith ripped off eight catches for 134 and two trips to the end zone.) If and when they're in base, then Bland will join Diggs on the outside. Eberflus often had his No. 1 corner in Chicago, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/2827532/jaylon-johnson/\">Jaylon Johnson</a>, shadow opposing No. 1s, but it would be a lot to ask for Diggs to do the same in his first game back, while having Bland do it would mean using someone else in the slot, where neither Diggs nor Elam has spent much time in their careers. </p><a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/news/can-the-eagles-repeat-as-super-bowl-champs-the-keys-to-philadelphias-2025-title-defense/\" target=\"_blank\">\n        <div>\n            <div>\n                <p>Can the Eagles repeat as Super Bowl champs?

Kansas City won't have its full complement of playmakers, however, with wide receiver <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/3124978/rashee-rice/\">Rashee Rice</a> opening the 2025 NFL season with a six-game suspension. The Chiefs are coming off an 18-point loss in the Super Bowl last season, and since 2000, Super Bowl losers are 11-14 straight-up and 6-19 against the spread in their season opener. Since 1990, 11 teams have lost in the Super Bowl by more than 14 points, and they went 4-7 straight-up and 2-9 ATS in their season openers, showing some form of a Super Bowl hangover. This bodes well for the Chargers, who are returning stars like <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/2221960/justin-herbert/\">Justin Herbert</a> and <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/3163962/ladd-mcconkey/\">Ladd McConkey</a>, as underdogs. The model projects the Chargers to cover in 50% of simulations. </p><h3>Under 45.5 total points</h3><p>The Chiefs and Chargers went Under this total in each of their contests last season, combining for 27 points and 36 points in their divisional matchups. Both teams had one of the best defenses in the NFL last season, and that's not expected to change this fall. The Chargers ranked second at 18.5 points per game allowed, and the Chiefs were sixth at 20.5 ppg allowed. The Chargers held Patrick Mahomes to fewer than 250 passing yards in both games, and without Rice at receiver, the Los Angeles secondary could challenge Mahomes again. The model projects the Under to hit in 60% of simulations.</p><h2>Responsible gaming</h2><p>Responsible gaming is a serious topic, and all sportsbooks take steps to ensure users play responsibly.

    "body": "<div>\n        <p>The Week 1 NFL schedule has arrived, and several teams will be looking to make a statement with an early-season victory. The Green Bay Packers made the playoffs in 2024 but were ousted by the Philadelphia Eagles in the Wild Card Round. Green Bay opens the 2025 NFL season with an NFC North showdown against the Detroit Lions on Sunday at 4:25 p.m. ET. Detroit is 8-0 in its last eight games on the road, but the Lions are 2.5-point underdogs, according to the latest Week 1 NFL odds. SportsLine's model is backing Green Bay, which is 10-4 in its last 14 games at home, to handle business at Lambeau Field and cover the spread in well over 50% of simulations. </p><p>The model is also backing the Jaguars (-3.5) to cover at home against the Panthers, while the Over (45.5) hits in nearly 70% of simulations in Giants vs. Commanders.

Green Bay's offense is led by running back Josh Jacobs, who rushed for 1,329 yards and 15 touchdowns last season. Jacobs finished with 18 carries for 66 yards and three rushing scores in Green Bay's 34-31 loss at Detroit last season. SportsLine's model is expecting Jacobs to be effective again against a Detroit defense that gave up 342.4 yards per game last season, helping Green Bay cover the spread in well over 50% of simulations. </p><h2>Giants vs. Commanders: Over 45.5 points</h2><p>The Giants added veteran quarterback Russell Wilson to their offense during the offseason, hoping the veteran signal caller will provide stability to a unit that features explosive playmakers on the outside. Wide receiver Malik Nabers was electric during his rookie campaign, hauling in 109 receptions for 1,204 yards and seven touchdowns. On the other side of the ball, the Commanders feature a plethora of playmakers capable of making explosive plays, including Jayden Daniels, Terry McLaurin and Deebo Samuel. In addition, the total has gone Over in five of Washington's last five games at home and four of Washington's previous six games played in Week 1. SportsLine's model projects these teams to score 53 points on average, aiding the Over to hit in 67% of simulations.</p><h2>Jaguars -3.5 vs. Panthers</h2><p>The Panthers have struggled mightily on the road in recent years, winning just two of their last 17 away games. Carolina is also 1-5 ATS in its last six games played in Week 1. These two teams last met in 2023, a game in which Jacksonville won 26-0 at home. Panthers quarterback Bryce Young threw for just 112 yards and an interception in that matchup, and SportsLine's model is projecting Jacksonville's defense will disrupt Carolina's signal caller again on Sunday. Jacksonville covers the spread in well over 50% of simulations, according to SportsLine's computer model, identifying the Jaguars as one of its Week 1 NFL best bets. </p><h2>Want more Week 1 NFL picks?</h2><p><strong>You've seen the model's Week 1 NFL best bets.

While the Chiefs have won seven straight games in the rivalry, six of them have been decided by seven points or fewer, and another close game is expected in the opener.

He is not only Kansas City's No. 1 wide receiver with Rashee Rice out for the first six weeks (suspension), but the speedster adds a rushing threat. In last year's opener against the Ravens, Worthy scored one touchdown rushing and one receiving. He had three total rushing scores in 2024 and could be used for a few gadget plays on the ground in the season opener. The model predicts he scores 0.44 receiving touchdowns on average, making him a solid value at this price from DraftKings.</p><h2>Ladd McConkey, Chargers (+170, Caesars)</h2><p>McConkey caught seven touchdown passes in his rookie season, including one against Kansas City, the only time he faced them in 2024. In Los Angeles' postseason loss to Houston, the Chargers' slot receiver posted a 9-197-1 line, including an 86-yard touchdown. The Chiefs' secondary can be susceptible to big plays, and it's likely that Justin Herbert will pepper his top wide receiver with targets. The model predicts that McConkey scores 0.43 touchdowns on average, making this a good value.</p><h2>Quentin Johnston, Chargers (+350, FanDuel)</h2><p>This one is a bit of a surprise as the model projects Los Angeles' deep threat to score 0.38 times on average. Though he's returning from a concussion suffered in a preseason game, Johnston should be ready to go in Brazil on Friday night. Last season, he scored eight times, including once against Kansas City. He is a top red zone weapon for the Chargers, and there's great value on his prop from FanDuel. </p><h2>Want more Week 1 NFL picks?</h2><p><strong>You've seen the model's NFL picks for Chiefs vs. Chargers anytime TD props for Week 1.

The Los Angeles Chargers, in their second season under coach Jim Harbaugh, are the \"home\" team against the three-time reigning AFC champion Kansas City Chiefs on Friday night. The game features an exciting matchup of top NFL quarterbacks: the future Hall of Famer Patrick Mahomes and his rival, Justin Herbert. Kansas City has won each of the last seven matchups, though six of them have been within one score. The latest <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/odds/\">NFL odds</a> list Herbert's over/under for total passing yards as high as 227.5, while Mahomes' tops out at 243.5, but there are also alternate NFL player props you can play to enhance your payout or take out some of the risk.</p><p>Herbert's alternate line for 300 or more passing yards is +515 (risk $100 to win $515), which he's accomplished five times combined over the last two seasons.

Patrick Mahomes has topped 300 yards passing seven times in the regular season over the last two seasons combined. While only Cincinnati's Joe Burrow eclipsed this total against Los Angeles in 2024, Mahomes has the weapons around him to give the Chargers' secondary fits. His over/under for total passing yards is 243.5 yards, but the model is confident that the future Hall of Fame quarterback will exceed that total. You can find Mahomes priced at +350 to record 300 or more passing yards at FanDuel, where you can also <a href=\"https://martech.cbssports.com/bt/redirect/prod?b=fanduel&amp;c=sport\" target=\"_blank\">get $300 in bonus bets if your first wager of $5 or more wins</a>.</p><h2>Xavier Worthy, Chiefs, 100+ receiving yards (+425)</h2><p>Worthy topped this number only once last season, but it was an impressive eight reception, 157 yard, two touchdown performance in Kansas City's Super Bowl loss to Philadelphia. With Rashee Rice suspended, Worthy is Kansas City's top wide receiver for at least the first six weeks of the 2025 season. With his big play ability, the Chiefs' speedster is fully capable of surpassing this number on two or three catches. His over/under for receiving yards is 59.5, but there's excellent value from this <a href=\"https://martech.cbssports.com/bt/redirect/prod?b=bet365&amp;c=sport\" target=\"_blank\">alt line at bet365</a>.</p><h2>Keenan Allen, Chargers, 50+ receiving yards (+155)</h2><p>The Chargers brought the dependable Allen back after a one season stint in Chicago, where he registered 70 catches for 744 yards and seven scores last season. In 2023, he posted 1,243 yards receiving for Los Angeles, including surpassing 50 yards in 12 of 13 games. Justin Herbert already trusts the veteran receiver, and while he may not play a full complement of snaps due to the presence of second-year receiver Ladd McConkey, Allen should get enough volume to exceed this total.

In spite of her personal setback, Clark called on the Fever to continue their playoff push without her in the lineup.</p><p>\"I had hoped to share a better update, but I will not be returning to play this season,\" Clark wrote. \"I spent hours in the gym every day with the singular goal of getting back out there, disappointed isn't a big enough word to describe how I am feeling. I want to thank everyone who had my back through all the uncertainty.</p><p>\"This has been incredibly frustrating, but even in the bad, there is good. The way the fans continued to show up for me, and for the Fever, brought me so much joy and important perspective. I am so proud of how this team has only gotten stronger through adversity this year. Now it's time to close out the season and claim our spot in the Playoffs.\"</p>\n<p>After a historic Rookie of the Year campaign, Clark's sophomore season was derailed by injuries. </p><p>She only played 13 times due to a left quad strain that kept her out for three weeks, a left groin injury that sidelined her for two weeks and now a right groin injury. Clark also suffered a left ankle bone bruise while rehabbing her current groin issue. </p><p>In 13 games, she averaged 16.5 points and 8.8 assists per game. Clark, however, shot just 27.9%from 3-point range on eight attempts per game. She was named an All-Star, but Clark missed out on the Commissioner's Cup championship and All-Star weekend in her adopted home city of Indianapolis. </p>\n<h2>Second-year setback</h2><table><tbody><tr><th><br /></th><th>2025 Caitlin Clark</th><th>2024 Caitlin Clark</th></tr><tr><td><p>Games</p></td><td><p>13</p></td><td><p>40</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>PPG</p></td><td><p>16.5</p></td><td><p>19.2</p></td></tr><tr><td>APG</td><td>8.8</td><td>8.4</td></tr><tr><td>3-PT%</td><td>27.9%</td><td>34.4%</td></tr></tbody></table><p>With less than a week before the Fever's regular season ends and less than two weeks until the playoffs begin, Clark was still not a full participant in practice this week.</p><p>\"She hasn't been able to do a whole lot of contact,\" Fever coach Stephanie White said. \"She's been able to get up-and-down 5-on-0, been able to do shooting, but hasn't been able to get a whole lot of contact.\"</p><p>Earlier this month, White said that she wants to see Clark participate in \"multiple practices\" before she returns to game action. She clarified that because the team will have limited practice time down the stretch, that doesn't necessarily mean team practices, but could include 3-on-3 or 4-on-4 work. </p><p>\"I want to see her in practice, live in practice,\" White said. \"I want to see her to continue to work to not just build endurance, but to be able to handle contact 94 feet as it's going to be in game, and to be able to do that and sustain from an endurance standpoint, and that's going to take multiple practices to make sure that there's no regression. As most of us know, when we get fatigued, we look different. [We need to see] how she plays through fatigue.\"</p><p>The Fever were 8-5 with Clark in the lineup and 13-15 without her. At 21-20, they currently hold the eighth and final playoff spot, but are just 1½ games up on the ninth-place <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/wnba/teams/LAS/los-angeles-sparks/\">Sparks</a>, who own the tiebreaker between the two teams. </p>\n            </div>"

The Wildcats stunned the Rebels as heavy underdogs, and the defeat continues to linger for Kiffin ahead of Saturday's return trip to Lexington. </p><p>\"It was really hard to deal with,\" Kiffin said Monday, noting that last year's early — and sleepy — kickoff didn't help. \"I just didn't think we played that well either. ...

Kentucky, picked near the bottom of the SEC this fall, survived a 24-16 scare against <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/teams/TOLEDO/toledo-rockets/\">Toledo</a>. </p><h2> Ole Miss vs. Kentucky: Need to know  </h2><p><strong>Battle of transfer backs:</strong> Kentucky's <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/players/29122137/dante-dowdell/\">Dante Dowdell</a> and Ole Miss' <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/players/29387514/kewan-lacy/\">Kewan Lacy</a> both cleared the 100-yard mark in successful openers. Dowdell, who spent time at <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/teams/OREG/oregon-ducks/\">Oregon</a> and <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/teams/NEB/nebraska-cornhuskers/\">Nebraska</a>, posted the first 100-yard game of his career with 129 yards against Toledo, punctuated by a 79-yard touchdown run in the fourth quarter. Lacy, a <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/teams/MIZZOU/missouri-tigers/\">Missouri</a> transfer, scored three times and rumbled for 108 yards in his Rebels debut. </p><p><strong>Rebels' poll streak:</strong> Dating back to the 2023 opener, Ole Miss has appeared in every AP Top 25 with 22 wins over that span. Kentucky, meanwhile, is 3-7 against ranked foes in that same stretch under Mark Stoops  including last year's upset of the Rebels in Oxford. </p>\n<p><strong>Yards per play:</strong> Ole Miss averaged 8.9 yards per play and racked up 33 first downs in its opener, compared to Kentucky's slower, grind-it-out pace. The Wildcats averaged just 4.6 yards per play with only three explosive gains: Dowdell's long run and chain-moving receptions from <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/players/28901524/josh-kattus/\">Josh Kattus</a> and <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/players/29417673/willie-rodriguez/\">Willie Rodriguez</a>. Transfer quarterback <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/players/3121158/zach-calzada/\">Zach Calzada</a> struggled in his debut, finishing with 85 yards and an interception. </p><h2> Where to watch Ole Miss vs. Kentucky live </h2><p><strong>Date</strong>: Saturday, Sept. 6 | <strong>Time</strong>: 3:30 p.m. ET<br /> <strong>Location</strong>: Kroger Field -- Lexington, Kentucky<br /> <strong>TV: </strong>ABC | <strong>Live stream: </strong><a href=\"https://www.fubo.tv/welcome/leagues/191261?irad=399332&amp;irmp=416484&amp;sharedid=HTW\" target=\"_blank\">Fubo</a> (Try for free) </p><h2> Ole Miss vs. Kentucky prediction, picks </h2>\n<p>The last four matchups in this SEC series have all been decided by three points or less, including a pair of shootouts in the Bluegrass. There's not an analytical edge here, but Stoops' program seems to get up for this matchup more than a few others in the conference and coming off last season's victory over the Rebels, already knows a double-digit spread doesn't mean much. Simmons had two giveaways in the opener, so he'll need to trim those mistakes to win on the road. Ole Miss wins this one, but Kentucky covers. </p>\n<div><table><thead><tr><th><br /></th><th><div>\n                    <div>\n    <figure><img alt=\"player headshot\"
