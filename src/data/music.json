    "body": "<div><p><span>F</span>rom highly competitive dog shows to night-time stories read in a woodland, there’s a sense of character to Krankenhaus that is unlike most festivals. With fewer than 1,500 people, the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk/lake-district\">Lake District</a> event – created and curated by the art-rock outfit Sea Power – is intimate almost to the point of being familial. Set primarily in a barn with the faint linger of animal dung still in the air, within the stunning grounds of Muncaster Castle, it’s essentially an extended party for the band and their friends.</p><p>The Lovely Eggs make a glorious racket as they hammer out a stomping set of psychedelic garage pop before <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/british-sea-power\">Sea Power</a> team up with Dean Wareham to deliver an immaculate performance of Galaxie 500 songs in a set that is both gentle and sprawling at the same time. The Moonlandingz finish the evening with a wonderfully raucous set that ends with frontman Lias Saoudi screaming his lungs out in the audience over a relentless and filthy gabber beat.</p><figure><div><picture><source srcset=\"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/88f2c6cbd25d033a9fd159e6988c53da94dcaa21/0_0_5566_3711/master/5566.jpg?width=620&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none\" media=\"(min-width: 660px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 660px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)\"></source><source srcset=\"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/88f2c6cbd25d033a9fd159e6988c53da94dcaa21/0_0_5566_3711/master/5566.jpg?width=620&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none\" media=\"(min-width: 660px)\"></source><source srcset=\"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/88f2c6cbd25d033a9fd159e6988c53da94dcaa21/0_0_5566_3711/master/5566.jpg?width=605&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none\" media=\"(min-width: 480px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 480px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)\"></source><source srcset=\"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/88f2c6cbd25d033a9fd159e6988c53da94dcaa21/0_0_5566_3711/master/5566.jpg?width=605&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none\" media=\"(min-width: 480px)\"></source><source srcset=\"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/88f2c6cbd25d033a9fd159e6988c53da94dcaa21/0_0_5566_3711/master/5566.jpg?width=445&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none\" media=\"(min-width: 320px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 320px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)\"></source><source srcset=\"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/88f2c6cbd25d033a9fd159e6988c53da94dcaa21/0_0_5566_3711/master/5566.jpg?width=445&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none\" media=\"(min-width: 320px)\"></source><img alt=\"The crowd watching Sea Power at Krankenhaus festival.\" src=\"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/88f2c6cbd25d033a9fd159e6988c53da94dcaa21/0_0_5566_3711/master/5566.jpg?width=445&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none\" /></picture></div><figcaption><span><svg width=\"18\" height=\"13\"></svg></span><span>An extended party … the crowd watching Sea Power at Krankenhaus festival.</span> Photograph: Paul Hudson</figcaption></figure><p>A community choir singing Sea Power’s Blackout ends up being one of the most quietly moving things all weekend, while Gnod – who have a current setup of four guitarists – play a set so loud and punishing that it will have likely traumatised the numerous dogs present. This is something that Stewart Lee jokes about during a brief and expertly executed standup set the following day, while characterising the audience, with affection, as a bunch of “sandal-wearing” indie-folkers. Sea Power put in a herculean effort to play their third gig of the weekend on Sunday, despite some members being up until eight o’clock that morning, resulting in a chill and woozy set that feels custom-built for fragile brains.</p><figure></figure><p>While Krankenhaus is endearingly back to basics, it’s also deceptively vast. Steam train trips and guided walks in sublime mountainous settings open up its cosiness into even more beautiful terrain. While so many festivals feel like the equivalent of an airport experience – trapped in a space and rinsed for all you’ve got while stuck there – Krankenhaus really leans into its location and encourages festival-goers to do the same. It’s genuinely unique.</p></div>"

    "body": "<div><p><span>‘Y</span>ou’re at the start of what might be the best weekend of your life,” Manchester’s dance-grooved “pop poet” <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2025/feb/22/one-to-watch-antony-szmierek-service-station-at-the-end-of-the-universe\">Antony Szmierek</a> tells a cheering audience, capturing the buzz which brings tens of thousands of teenagers (and older) to Leeds festival (and its Reading counterpart). The former rock festival is a post-GCSE rite of passage, a place for many to don a daft hat, wear as little as possible, toast results or drown sorrows. Two years ago, Szmeriek – imagine the Streets’ Mike Skinner with a ’tache and trackies – was a special needs teacher before becoming a dazzling wordsmith, so draws on his backstory (and gets another cheer) when he tells the kid in the front row who failed all his exams: “It doesn’t matter. You will be someone.”</p><p>Other hits include Skye Newman’s raw soul, dance producer <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2025/aug/24/optimism-is-very-important-especially-now-why-sammy-virjis-joyful-dance-tracks-are-conquering-the-world\">Sammy Virji</a> and besuited, sunglasses-wearing New York one-man electronic band <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXXbck3y5C8\">Harrison Smith</a> AKA the Dare, whose brilliantly jerky set is like watching Jarvis Cocker fronting LCD Soundsystem. Kids waiting for rap at the main stage look bewildered by Amy Taylor’s raucous, shouty Aussie punks Amyl and the Sniffers. Trippie Redd’s affecting blend of the plaintive and unsettling is beautifully illustrated when a father plays football with his toddlers as the American raps about putting someone in their casket. Otherwise, with fewer stages and big names than previous years, the first day feels somewhat undersold and underpowered. US rap superstar Travis Scott’s headlining set builds in intensity as pyro and fireworks erupt around him, but ends abruptly 35 minutes early, without explanation, to a smattering of boos.</p><p>Saturday is visibly busier and while co-headliner <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2024/sep/21/chappell-roan-3olympia-theatre-dublin-live-review-the-rise-and-fall-of-a-midwest-princess\">Chappell Roan</a> is second on the bill here (she topped it in Reading on Sunday, alternating with Hozier) she pulls by far the biggest crowd all weekend, a sea of pink cowboy hats.

With a fantasy castle stage set, outfit like an Andy Warhol take on Elizabethan England and female musicians reminiscent of Prince’s band, subjects from LGBTQ+ issues to feminism to meltdowns are channelled into joyous, stylish, era-defining anthems. Few artists have owned the field so effectively in years. Irish singer-songwriter Hozier has to follow that, but the crowd stay put and his cosier vibe explodes into fire when he speaks up for Kneecap, Palestine and equality, and closes with a blazing Take Me to Church.</p><figure><div><picture><source srcset=\"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/57d8634b60708971f95482a1a63f3167b1dcef1e/0_0_4113_2435/master/4113.jpg?width=620&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none\" media=\"(min-width: 660px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 660px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)\"></source><source srcset=\"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/57d8634b60708971f95482a1a63f3167b1dcef1e/0_0_4113_2435/master/4113.jpg?width=620&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none\" media=\"(min-width: 660px)\"></source><source srcset=\"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/57d8634b60708971f95482a1a63f3167b1dcef1e/0_0_4113_2435/master/4113.jpg?width=605&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none\" media=\"(min-width: 480px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 480px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)\"></source><source srcset=\"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/57d8634b60708971f95482a1a63f3167b1dcef1e/0_0_4113_2435/master/4113.jpg?width=605&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none\" media=\"(min-width: 480px)\"></source><source srcset=\"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/57d8634b60708971f95482a1a63f3167b1dcef1e/0_0_4113_2435/master/4113.jpg?width=445&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none\" media=\"(min-width: 320px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 320px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)\"></source><source srcset=\"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/57d8634b60708971f95482a1a63f3167b1dcef1e/0_0_4113_2435/master/4113.jpg?width=445&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none\" media=\"(min-width: 320px)\"></source><img alt=\"The demonic commander … Oli Sykes of Bring Me the Horizon performing at Leeds festival.\" src=\"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/57d8634b60708971f95482a1a63f3167b1dcef1e/0_0_4113_2435/master/4113.jpg?width=445&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none\" /></picture></div><figcaption><span><svg width=\"18\" height=\"13\"></svg></span><span>The demonic commander … Oli Sykes of Bring Me the Horizon performing at Leeds festival.</span> Photograph: Katja Ogrin/Redferns for ABA</figcaption></figure><p>Sunday is rock day, and Sheffield pop-metal kings <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/bring-me-the-horizon\">Bring Me the Horizon</a> deliver a postmodern eye- and ear-melter of a headline set where the band are stars in their own gigantic video game. Singer Oli Sykes is the demonic commander and the arm-swaying crowd and circle pits become part of the spectacle. Overall, though, it bodes well to see so many triumphs from newer artists, particularly Wunderhorse, who have gone off like a rocket since playing the BBC Introducing stage here last year and pack the hi-tech, usually dance-focused Chevron stage. For all the obvious echoes of Nirvana and REM, the Cornwall-based band’s undefinable edge – not least in wiry frontman Jacob Slater – makes them utterly compelling, and they enrapture an audience of all ages.</p></div>"

The Leipzig Gewandhaus and the Melbourne Symphony are among this week’s arrivals. But the past weekend belonged to the Royal Concertgebouw Orchestra. No visit by Amsterdam’s finest is to be missed, but these two Proms in less than 24 hours brought something more – the starry presence of <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://klausmakela.com/\">Klaus Mäkelä</a>, who becomes the RCO’s chief conductor in 2027 and who currently has the musical world at his feet.</p><p>The obvious challenge in judging whether the two will become a perfect fit is that the RCO are simply so good. The warmth and precision of the Amsterdam string sound is legendary, while the RCO offers listeners wind playing to die for.

Still only 29, he brought two big works – Mahler’s fifth symphony in the first concert and Bartok’s Concerto for Orchestra in the second – not forgetting a truly thrilling Kodály encore to close with. The big pieces were fabulously played, of course, but it was the instrumental details rather than the overall conception that made the biggest mark. There was too little sense of symphonic architecture in Mäkelä’s approach to the Mahler, while his Bartók emphasised the work’s showpiece qualities at the expense of the sense of distance and loneliness that haunts the score.</p><p>Mahler, though, is in the RCO’s blood. The composer himself conducted this orchestra. Decades later, Bernard Haitink’s Amsterdam Mahler performances became legendary. Mäkelä’s relentless approach had little in common with Haitink’s more measured tread, nor with <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/article/2024/jul/22/prom-6-halle-orchestra-and-choirs-mark-elder-review\">Mark Elder’s cerebral take</a> on the same symphony in last year’s Proms. From the expertly phrased funeral march trumpet call onwards, wind playing was exceptional, as were quieter passages more generally. The strings caressed the Adagietto’s lingering phrases and Mäkelä brought fine swagger and propulsion to the rondo-finale. As an interpretation, though, it never quite established itself.</p><p>Unexpectedly, Luciano Berio’s Rendering, which preceded the Mahler, fared better. This substantial three-movement piece feeds some of Schubert’s late symphonic sketches through Berio’s fertile and ingenious late 20th-century sensibility. The result, especially when it is as well done as it was here, is fresh and exploratory, as Schubertian melodies modulate into Berio’s mysterious fragments and colours. If the test of a good performance is that it stays in the head, then this one did just that.</p><p>The same was true of <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.janinejansen.com/\">Janine Jansen</a>’s account of Prokofiev’s first violin concerto on the following day. Jansen commanded the performance, her playing technically dazzling and musically intense, with Mäkelä and the RCO providing impeccably unobtrusive accompaniment.</p><p>Finally, hats off to Mäkelä for opening the second concert with an elegantly played example of something that has become too much of a <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/proms\">Proms</a> rarity in recent years – a Mozart symphony, in this case the D major “Paris”.</p></div>"

    "description": "Victorious festival organisers apologised for cutting off the Irish band after they led chants to ‘free Palestine’, and said they would donate to humanitarian relief efforts",
    "body": "<div><p>The Last Dinner Party pulled out of their set at Portsmouth’s Victorious festival at the weekend after Irish band the Mary Wallopers saw their set cut short after saying “free Palestine and fuck Israel”.</p><p>On Friday, the Mary Wallopers walked onstage and unveiled a Palestinian flag alongside their opening remarks. Video appeared to show a crew member confronting the band about the flag, which was draped on the stage, and then removing it. After calls from the band and the crowd of “free, free Palestine”, the sound was cut. The band briefly retrieved the flag to cheers.</p><p>A representative for the festival initially said that the show was cut short after the band used “a chant which is widely understood to have a discriminatory context”.</p><p>On Instagram, the Mary Wallopers disputed this, posting footage of the incident. “The festival have released a misleading statement to the press claiming they cut our sound because of a discriminatory chant and not the band’s call to Free Palestine. Our video clearly shows a Victorious crew member coming on stage, interfering with our show, removing the flag from the stage and then the sound being cut following a chant of ‘Free Palestine’. The same crew member is later heard in the video saying ‘you aren’t playing until the flag is removed’.</p><p>“We completely reject Victorious’ portrayal of today’s events and request that they retract their statement immediately.”</p><p>Victorious put out a subsequent statement apologising for the situation. “We are in the business of putting on great shows, not cutting them off and this is the last thing we wanted, for the band, their fans and ourselves. We didn’t handle the explanation of our policies sensitively or far enough in advance to allow a sensible conclusion to be reached. This put the band and our own team in a difficult situation which never should have arisen. We would like to sincerely apologise to all involved.</p><p>“We absolutely support the right of artists to freely express their views from the stage, within the law and the inclusive nature of the event. Our policy of not allowing flags of any kind, which has been in place for many years for wider event management and safety reasons, is not meant to compromise that right.”</p><p>The organisers accepted the band’s version of the events and said they would be making “a substantial donation to humanitarian relief efforts for the Palestinian people”.</p><p>In response to the Mary Walloper’s set being pulled, British band the Last Dinner Party cancelled their scheduled Saturday performance at the festival. “We are outraged by the decision made to silence the Mary Wallopers yesterday at Victorious,” they posted on Instagram. “As a band we cannot cosign political censorship and will therefore be boycotting the festival today.”</p><figure></figure><p>The decision also drew condemnation from US band <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/vampire-weekend\">Vampire Weekend</a>, who went ahead with their performance at Victorious on Saturday night. Frontman Ezra Koenig told the crowd: “If someone was punished for flying a flag, that is wrong and they deserve an apology. The terrible suffering of the Palestinian people deserves all of our sympathy.”</p><p>Additionally this weekend, the BBC explained that it had “mutually agreed” with Reading and Leeds headliner Hozier ahead of the festivals that it would not broadcast his set.
