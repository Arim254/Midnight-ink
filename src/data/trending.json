Public transport or walking is not presented as an option.</p><p>This can result in some unusually long journeys and others that are unusually short.</p><p>For instance, when migrants move between hotels, they sometimes keep the same NHS doctors - especially for GP referrals.</p><p>Work and Pensions Secretary Pat McFadden told BBC Radio 4's Today programme he agreed that there should be an investigation into how the system works. </p><p>\"I'm not surprised that this was a feature that caught people's eye\", he said. </p><p>On Tuesday, housing minister Matthew Pennycook told the Today programme it was \"questionable\" that asylum seekers needed to take such long taxi journeys and said the government would \"look into those cases\". </p><p>He added that asylum seekers were not \"ordinary citizens just jumping on a bus\".</p></div><div><p>Shadow home secretary Chris Philp, said: \"Every £600 taxi ride for migrants is money that should be paying for British patients to see their GP or for ambulances to turn up on time. This is why people feel the system is rigged against them.</p><p>\"Labour are writing a blank cheque for illegal immigration while services for hard-working families are strained.\"</p><p>Reform UK MP Lee Anderson said: \"This is likely just the tip of the iceberg and yet another example of how the Tories and Labour have spent billions supporting migrants at the expense of our own people.\"</p><p>A spokesperson for the Liberal Democrats called the taxi costs \"a ridiculous waste of taxpayer money and shows exactly why the government must take the asylum crisis seriously and end hotel use\".<b> </b></p><p>The report, however, highlights \"the poor living conditions, profiteering and exploitation which characterise our for-profit asylum system\", Labour MP Bell Ribeiro-Addy said. </p><p>\"We are setting people up to fail while the companies providing asylum accommodation make huge profits on taxpayers' money and asylum seekers' misery,\" she added.</p><p>The BBC went into four hotels housing asylum seekers, as part of its investigation, uncovering cramped living conditions, illegal working, and fire alarms covered with plastic bags, as residents secretly cooked meals over electric hobs in bathrooms. </p><p>The BBC found: </p><ul><li>Smoke alarms covered with plastic bags as residents cooking meals used electric hobs in bathrooms</li><li>A 12-year-old girl living in a hotel who had spent three-quarters of her life in the asylum system. \"Once we get settled in a place, then they move us,\" she said</li><li>Some asylum seekers saying they had no choice but to work illegally for as little as £20 a day to pay off debts to people smugglers</li></ul><p>The issue of asylum seekers in hotels has become a heated political issue attracting protests and a <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/ckgy7p29y4ko\">legal challenge by an Essex council</a> attempting to close a hotel in its district.</p><p>The government plans to end the use of hotels for housing asylum seekers.</p><p>In August, asylum seekers told the BBC that protests outside hotels left them feeling isolated and anxious. </p><p>They emphasised that they did not choose to live in hotels and <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c17np7r02pgo\">struggled in \"damp and dirty\" conditions. </a></p></div>"

After the British monarch, she was the richest woman in Britain and Ireland at the time. </p><p>The actress says she loved researching her character and understanding what she was really like. </p><p>\"She's such a firecracker in the series and then I actually found out she was also a very solitary and silent woman who painted lots of watercolours,\" Galligan explains.</p><p>\"She was a woman who had everything and yet was still looking for something. Learning about her gave me a sense of her lack of fulfilment and added another layer to her.\" </p><p>Galligan says it was very special to tell an Irish story and \"to do it on a global scale is a once-in-a-lifetime kind of experience\". </p><p>Joining Galligan is Niamh McCormack, whose character is part of the rebellious Fenian Brotherhood, and Jack Gleeson, who is best known for playing Joffrey Baratheon in Game of Thrones.</p></div><figure><div><p><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20250905-110137-f27f908f49-web-2.29.1-3/grey-placeholder.png\" /><img srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/86ad/live/154c80d0-993f-11f0-869a-3fa4ad43e8ee.jpg.webp 240w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/86ad/live/154c80d0-993f-11f0-869a-3fa4ad43e8ee.jpg.webp 320w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/86ad/live/154c80d0-993f-11f0-869a-3fa4ad43e8ee.jpg.webp 480w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/86ad/live/154c80d0-993f-11f0-869a-3fa4ad43e8ee.jpg.webp 640w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/86ad/live/154c80d0-993f-11f0-869a-3fa4ad43e8ee.jpg.webp 800w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/86ad/live/154c80d0-993f-11f0-869a-3fa4ad43e8ee.jpg.webp 1024w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/86ad/live/154c80d0-993f-11f0-869a-3fa4ad43e8ee.jpg.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/86ad/live/154c80d0-993f-11f0-869a-3fa4ad43e8ee.jpg.webp\" alt=\"Netflix Jack Gleeson as Byron Hedges wearing a yellow coat and brown cap holding two bags and running in the street\" /><span>Netflix</span></p></div><p></p><figcaption>Gleeson took a break from acting after Game of Thrones but now stars as Byron Hedges in House of Guinness </figcaption><p></p></figure><div><p>McCormack and Gleeson say they are proud to be part of a series that puts Ireland on the map, but admit that with pride comes pressure over how it will be received by audiences at home. </p><p>\"It's always a factor but I tried not to think about it too much,\" Gleeson says. \"You want things to be represented well but also hopefully people know not to take it too seriously as a historical document.\"</p><p>Knight was less worried about what audiences would think, admitting: \"I should care but I don't - if you worry what people are going to think you can't really do anything as you'd be trying to please too many different people.\" </p><p>House of Guinness has already been compared to the likes of Succession, The Crown and Peaky Blinders but Knight is indifferent about how people compare it. </p><p>\"People say every project is a cross between stuff and I don't take that too seriously, I'm confident that this is its own thing,\" he says. </p></div><figure><div><p><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20250905-110137-f27f908f49-web-2.29.1-3/grey-placeholder.png\" /><img srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/91b8/live/5c824500-9950-11f0-9ab8-fd188b933226.jpg.webp 240w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/91b8/live/5c824500-9950-11f0-9ab8-fd188b933226.jpg.webp 320w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/91b8/live/5c824500-9950-11f0-9ab8-fd188b933226.jpg.webp 480w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/91b8/live/5c824500-9950-11f0-9ab8-fd188b933226.jpg.webp 640w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/91b8/live/5c824500-9950-11f0-9ab8-fd188b933226.jpg.webp 800w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/91b8/live/5c824500-9950-11f0-9ab8-fd188b933226.jpg.webp 1024w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/91b8/live/5c824500-9950-11f0-9ab8-fd188b933226.jpg.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/91b8/live/5c824500-9950-11f0-9ab8-fd188b933226.jpg.webp\" alt=\"Getty Images Screenwriter Steven Knight poses during a photocall to promote the dance theatre adaptation 'Peaky Blinders: The Redemption Of Thomas Shelby,' on June 10, 2025 in Birmingham, England. \" /><span>Getty Images</span></p></div><p></p><figcaption>Knight says there are some similarities between House of Guinness and Peaky Blinders</figcaption><p></p></figure><div><p>For Norton, who is also currently starring in BBC's historical drama King & Conqueror, to be compared to such successful shows is a positive.</p><p>\"To be in the same breath as those dynasty shows is great and I'm happy if we're included among that group,\" he says.
