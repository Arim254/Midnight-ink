Predictable. Disillusioned. Out with a whimper. No belief. Ran out of ideas.</b></p><p>Those disparaging words tumbled out of the mouths of several former Rangers players inside Ibrox on Thursday after the Europa League defeat by Genk - a fourth in their past seven games under Russell Martin.</p><p>There was no relish within what they said. Not even much anger. Just sadness, regret and frustration. </p><p>Even the ever-ebullient Ally McCoist was subdued.</p><p>\"The manager is in big trouble,\" the club's legendary former striker and manager said on TNT Sports in the aftermath of the 1-0 loss.</p><p>\"Something has to change, and change dramatically. This can't go on for long. If people around the stadium don't support you, there's no point.</p><p>\"I'm desperate for Russell Martin to turn things around but it looks miles off it.\"</p></div><p></p><h2 id=\"Martins-unconvincing-message-wearing-thin\"><span>Martin's unconvincing message wearing thin</span></h2><p></p><div><p>When he fielded questions after the defeat, it sounded for the first time that Martin perhaps doubted his repeated insistence that better days lie ahead.</p><p>His \"we're not far away\" mantra was there, but it wasn't delivered in the usual bullish  tone. Instead, the Rangers head coach was was short, snippy and sombre.</p><p>Despite his ability to pick out positive individual performances - which left pundits and punters perplexed - there was a hint that he knew things were slipping away.</p><p>This was another night when Rangers caused their own problems. A reckless red card. Scant creativity. A lack of impetus. Poor defending. </p><p>Had it not been for Jack Butland, the scoreline might have read something more similar to <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/live/cn92pyrg08jt\">when they last faced a Belgian side.</a></p><p>Martin had insisted Rangers would \"attack\" this competition. But his side registered just two shots on target and had 13 touches in their visitors' penalty area. </p><p>He claimed they were \"in Genk's box a lot, had good control and were aggressive\" - a statement that took aback former Rangers midfielder Andy Halliday.</p><p>\"I'm surprised he said Rangers were aggressive,\" the Motherwell midfielder said on Sportsound. \"I didn't see aggression and I certainly didn't see them create chances.\"</p><p>Steven Thompson, who was alongside Halliday at Ibrox, admitted there was a tone of \"acceptance\" in Martin's unconvincing message.</p><p>\"There was a lack of energy in his press conference,\" the former Ibrox striker said. \"You could feel that it was getting to him. </p><p>\"There was an acceptance there, he knows he's under pressure. How long are we going to keep hearing 'we're going to get there' for?\"</p></div><div><figure><figcaption><span>Media caption, </span><p>Martin feels 'nothing but support' from Rangers hierarchy</p></figcaption></figure></div><p></p><h2 id=\"Its-as-if-Rangers-players-dont-believe\"><span>'It's as if Rangers players don't believe'</span></h2><p></p><div><p>Martin is not being helped by some of his players, either.</p><p>Against Genk, it was Mohamed Diomande, whose \"sheer stupidity\" - in the words of former Rangers midfielder Derek Ferguson - hampered his side's hopes of building any sort of momentum from their weekend win against Hibs.</p><p>The midfielder's needless first-half red card - a third in Martin's first 14 games - knocked the stuffing out of an already struggling Rangers. </p><p>But, in truth, they were huffing and puffing before that moment of madness made life even more difficult.</p><p>Martin said his side were in control early on, but many would argue otherwise given Genk's quick start and the penetrative runs of Zakaria El Ouahdi, in particular.</p><p>What left former Ibrox players amid the punditocracy most troubled was Rangers' apparent lack of belief in themselves.</p><p>There was no fast start. There was no rolling up of the sleeves when their team-mate trotted off. There was no final push for a point. It was all just... meh.</p><p>\"It's a struggle,\" Ferguson said on Sportsound during the game. \"I know they're down to 10 men but with 10, you can still always find a way.</p><p>\"It's as if Rangers players don't believe there is a way back into this game.\"</p><p>In the final five minutes, Rangers had a few near things, but nothing that troubled Genk goalkeeper Hendrik Van Crombrugge.</p><p>\"Players are looking at each other asking, 'what do we do?',\" added Thompson. \"It looks like they've run out of ideas. Everything is so laborious and predictable. </p><p>\"It frustrates the life out of the supporters and they don't enjoy what they're watching.\"</p></div><div><p><strong>'Someone at Rangers needs to take the bull by the horns'</strong></p><p>26/09/25</p></div><p></p><h2 id=\"Pack-your-bags-what-are-the-fans-saying\"><span>'Pack your bags' - what are the fans saying?</span></h2><p></p><div><p>Europa League nights have so often brought solace and soothed any domestic difficulties suffered by Rangers in recent seasons.</p><p>But Thursday never felt like it was going to be one of those explosive evenings.</p><p>Instead of excitement and electricity there was apathy and angst. Instead of being greeted by a bellowing sea of blue, swathes of empty seats greeted the players as they emerged from the tunnel.</p><p>Martin concedes only positive results will bring about change. Fans who have made their minds up were given nothing to persuade them to think again.</p><p>When BBC Scotland, asked fans for their views, very few were complimentary of the head coach.</p><p><b>Sam: </b>Watching Martin's interview. He never apologised to the fans that paid good money, he shrugged off questions and started waffling. His excuses are running dry and we don't want to hear them anymore. Do the decent thing and pack your bags.</p><p><b>Robert: </b>Martin has been given chance after chance, but the football is absolutely terrible and if there isn't a change the support will walk away.</p><p><b>Seb: </b>Insipid stuff. Lack of belief, no clear plan, possession for possession sake, open to almost every counter attack and no cutting edge up front. Best way to sum up the team and management is anaemic. Bereft of anything positive.</p><p><b>Mark: </b>Until the new owners face facts and realise they made a mistake hiring Martin, I'll refuse to follow or watch Rangers. We used to be a club feared - not anymore. I wouldn't be surprised if we were relegated, that's how shocking we are.</p><p><b>Sally: </b>The players are there. They are not being managed. Possession is only of value if it is played to forwards. Tavernier needs to realise other players can take corners and free-kicks. He consistently left the defence exposed.</p><p><b>Duncan: </b>Another overall poor performance by what can only be described as a mediocre Rangers team. Lack of any bite, cohesion and, it appears. any plan. Martin surely cannot be allowed to continue to embarrass a club that demands much more.</p></div><div><h2>Get in touch</h2><div><p>Send us your views on Rangers</p></div></div><section><p></p><h2>More on this story</h2><p></p><ul><li></li><li></li></ul></section></article></div>"

Or more accurately, what she called them.</p><p>\"Keighley Queens\" is her best guess.</p><p>Kildunne had turned up at a trial for Yorkshire's under-15s side. She hadn't been invited, but her mother spotted the date and took her along.</p><p>Asked which team she played for, a club-less Kildunne had to improvise. The Keighley Queens, or something similar, were born.</p><p>Kildunne had previously had two clubs. </p><p>Having tagged along with her neighbours' two boys at the age of six, she would cross town and codes to play both league for Keighley Albion and union for Keighley on weekends.</p><p>The only girl on the pitch, she would scorch past once-scornful boys.</p><p>\"I just loved the pressure of proving myself,\" she remembers.</p><p>\"I wanted to make a statement. 'You are looking over your shoulder and laughing, but just wait...'\"</p><p>She had overturned similar preconceptions at secondary school. Arriving as an 11-year-old, she told the PE staff she would be playing rugby, not netball.</p><p>She was shoved out on the wing for the B team. By the end of the season, she was named back of the year.</p><p>But her progress hit a familiar roadblock. Puberty hit, genders split, teams expanded to 15 players and rugby options for young women grew sparse.</p><p>\"I didn't know that women's rugby was a big thing at that point,\" says Kildunne.</p><p>\"Instead I wanted to be the next Steven Gerrard.\"</p></div><div><figure><figcaption><span>Media caption, </span><p>England's Kildunne 'proved why she's world's best player'</p></figcaption></figure></div><div><p>By the time Kildunne arrived at that Yorkshire trial, she had moved on to football.</p><p>A childhood Liverpool fan, she used to run around the house in a replica shirt, her curly hair slicked back to resemble Spanish striker Fernando Torres.</p><p>It provided the team environment she relished.</p><p>She was part of a Farsley Celtic team who travelled to Manchester City's Etihad training campus and beat the Premier League giant's academy side 7-1.</p><p>But Kildunne still hungered for rugby.</p><p>\"When you've got that feeling inside you that you're meant to do something special, you have to have that dedication and drive to overcome barriers,\" she said.</p><p>\"There's always another route. If it's not A, B or C, it's probably X, Y, Z.\"</p><p>For Kildunne, it was Yorkshire. Having been accepted to represent her county, she thought she had better find a real club to replace 'Keighley Queens'.</p><p>She joined West Park Leeds. Soon after she played Castleford. On the opposite team was Carla Middleton, the daughter of future Red Roses coach Simon Middleton.</p><p>\"I'd never seen anything like it,\" said Middleton Sr.</p><p>\"Her team went 30 points down and she kept them in it, almost on her own, running in tries and kicking goals from the touchline. You don't see that from many 15-year-olds.\"</p><p>Three years later, Middleton gave a raft of youngsters their England debuts in a match against Canada in Barnet.</p><p>Hannah Botterman, Zoe Harrison, Abby Dow and Jess Breach all won their first caps, along with an 18-year-old Kildunne who scored a try during her 27-minute cameo in a 79-5 win.</p></div><p></p><h2 id=\"From-fangirling-in-Monaco-to-Englands-home-hero\"><span>From 'fangirling' in Monaco to England's home hero</span></h2><p></p><div><figure><p><span><picture><source srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/240/cpsprodpb/ce85/live/83d5ea70-9960-11f0-80b9-69e2e45f1309.jpg.webp 240w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/320/cpsprodpb/ce85/live/83d5ea70-9960-11f0-80b9-69e2e45f1309.jpg.webp 320w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/480/cpsprodpb/ce85/live/83d5ea70-9960-11f0-80b9-69e2e45f1309.jpg.webp 480w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/624/cpsprodpb/ce85/live/83d5ea70-9960-11f0-80b9-69e2e45f1309.jpg.webp 624w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/800/cpsprodpb/ce85/live/83d5ea70-9960-11f0-80b9-69e2e45f1309.jpg.webp 800w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/976/cpsprodpb/ce85/live/83d5ea70-9960-11f0-80b9-69e2e45f1309.jpg.webp 976w\" type=\"image/webp\"></source><img alt=\"Ellie Kildunne runs with the ball in her left hand\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/1024/cpsprodpb/ce85/live/83d5ea70-9960-11f0-80b9-69e2e45f1309.jpg\" srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/240/cpsprodpb/ce85/live/83d5ea70-9960-11f0-80b9-69e2e45f1309.jpg 240w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/320/cpsprodpb/ce85/live/83d5ea70-9960-11f0-80b9-69e2e45f1309.jpg 320w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/480/cpsprodpb/ce85/live/83d5ea70-9960-11f0-80b9-69e2e45f1309.jpg 480w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/624/cpsprodpb/ce85/live/83d5ea70-9960-11f0-80b9-69e2e45f1309.jpg 624w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/800/cpsprodpb/ce85/live/83d5ea70-9960-11f0-80b9-69e2e45f1309.jpg 800w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/976/cpsprodpb/ce85/live/83d5ea70-9960-11f0-80b9-69e2e45f1309.jpg 976w\" /></picture></span><span><span>Image source, </span>Getty Images</span></p><figcaption><span>Image caption, </span><p>Kildunne runs in a try on her England debut in November 2017.

I fancy United here, but it is going to be close. 0-1</p><p><b>Blanco's prediction:</b> Brentford have not been great so far but I am not a fan of United's full-backs, especially Patrick Dorgu. Everything travels through their wide players. 2-2</p><p><b>AI's prediction:</b> 1-1</p></div><div><div><ul><li><p> Stamford Bridge, 15:00 BST</p></li></ul></div><p>This is quite a big game for Chelsea boss Enzo Maresca after his side lost to Bayern Munich and Manchester United. </p><p>I was at their Carabao Cup tie with Lincoln City in midweek and they were expected to win that tie, which they did, but the Imps caused them all sorts of problems and Chelsea are just not very convincing at the moment.</p><p>It hardly helps that Cole Palmer must be a big doubt to play after he came off injured against United, and they will miss him badly if he is ruled out.</p><p>When I think of Brighton, I always think they will score goals but they can be quite inconsistent.</p><p>There are that many of their former players at Chelsea, this is like Brighton versus Brighton Old Boys - and I don't think either side will do enough to win it.</p><p><b>Sutton's prediction:</b> 1-1</p><p><b>Kidwild's prediction:</b> A lot depends on if Palmer is fit for Chelsea. Brighton were decent against Spurs too, so I am not sure... maybe Chelsea will nick it. 2-1</p><p><b>Blanco's prediction:</b> I am also thinking Chelsea to edge it. They have got enough depth to cope if Palmer isn't fit. 2-1</p><p><b>AI's prediction:</b> 2-1</p></div><div><div><ul><li><p> Selhurst Park, 15:00 BST</p></li></ul></div><p>Part of me is thinking that Liverpool are going to click soon and just absolutely annihilate someone.</p><p>At the same time, I just don't think that is what will happen against Palace.</p><p>Palace got the better of them on penalties in the Community Shield and while I am not sure you can read too much into that, I am going for another draw this time.</p><p><b>Sutton's prediction:</b> 0-0</p><p><b>Kidwild's prediction:</b> Liverpool are just doing what they always do - not playing that well but still winning. I don't think Palace will beat them but I can see them getting something, because Liverpool do concede a few. 1-1</p><p><b>Blanco's prediction:</b> I went draw as well. 1-1</p><p><b>AI's prediction:</b> 1-2</p></div><div><div><ul><li><p> Elland Road, 15:00 BST</p></li></ul></div><p>I've been told I absolutely cannot go for 10 draws this week, which is shame because this game has got draw written all over it.</p><p>Being serious, I was very impressed by Leeds' win over Wolves last time out - it really surprised me, but it was a brilliant result that showed what they have got to offer under Daniel Farke, and that they are going to give it a real go this season.</p><p>Even so, I am backing Bournemouth here. The Cherries were a bit flat against Newcastle last week but they usually create loads of chances and that's what I am expecting them to do at Elland Road.</p><p><b>Sutton's prediction:</b> 1-2</p><p><b>Blanco's prediction:</b> I don't know if it will be comfortable, but Bournemouth have got this. Their squad is just better than Leeds'. 0-2</p><p><b>Kidwild's prediction:</b> Agreed. I know Leeds got a good win against Wolves last week but you have to remember how terrible Wolves have been. 0-2</p><p><b>AI's prediction:</b> 0-2</p></div><div><div><ul><li><p> Etihad Stadium, 15:00 BST</p></li></ul></div><p>Pep Guardiola parks the bus - or at least he did against Arsenal last week - but it is going to be Burnley who try to do that this time.</p><p>The Clarets almost held out against Liverpool and they ran Manchester United close too, but I don't see them keeping City quiet.</p><p><b>Sutton's prediction:</b> 3-0</p><p><b>Kidwild's prediction:</b> I am not sure how good Burnley are. They never really seem to want to score and it will be the same here, with 90 minutes of defending. I don't think that they can hold out against City though - eventually the goal will come. 1-0</p><p><b>Blanco on City's season:</b> A top-three finish is the most likely outcome, we are probably the third-best team in the Premier League at the moment. </p><p>I like the new system we saw in the Arsenal and Manchester United games where we kind of sat back, let them have the ball, then we counter-attack. I feel like that suits us more than trying to press from the front because people like Haaland and Jeremy Doku are not really great at it.</p><p>If we keep playing like that, I am confident we will do well in Europe too. I don't think we will win the Champions League, but we will go far.</p><p><b>Blanco's prediction:</b> I am so confident, I can even tell you the goalscorers - Foden is getting two, plus Doku and Haaland. 4-0</p><p><b>AI's prediction:</b> 2-1</p></div><div><div><ul><li><p>City Ground, 17:30 BST</p></li></ul></div><p>A lot has been made of how new Nottingham Forest boss Ange Postecoglou is still waiting for his first win, and he has got another tough game on his hands here.</p><p>I was so impressed by Sunderland's display with 10 men in last weekend's draw with Aston Villa. They were superbly organised.</p><p>The Black Cats are without injured midfielder Habib Diarra but they will still be difficult to break down and will fancy their chances of extending their four-game unbeaten run.</p><p>Based on form, they should probably get something from this but I am going against the grain here, and I am going to say Big Ange will get over the line and get the result he wants.</p><p><b>Sutton's prediction:</b> 2-1</p><p><b>Kidwild's prediction:</b> I was going to go for a Forest win, but I just have a feeling Sunderland will take it. 1-2</p><p><b>Blanco's prediction:</b> Sunderland did well with 10 men against Aston Villa but then Villa have been really bad this season. 3-1</p><p><b>AI's prediction:</b> 0-1</p></div><div><div><ul><li><p> Tottenham Hotspur Stadium, 20:00 BST</p></li></ul></div><p>Things are getting desperate for Wolves after five straight defeats in the league, but it is hard to make a case for them getting anything here.</p><p>Tottenham showed great resilience to come back late on to rescue a point at Brighton last week. They have got that side to them now where you feel they can get something from games, even when things go wrong for them.</p><p>I was at their Champions League win over Villarreal when they huffed and puffed but still got the job done. This game might not be entirely straightforward for them either, but I am expecting the same outcome.</p><p><b>Sutton's prediction:</b> 1-0</p><p><b>Kidwild on Tottenham's season:</b> Top four in the Premier League is the aim and it looks like it can happen this season. Every game it feels like Thomas Frank can set us up differently, based on who we are playing, and we have got strength in depth too. </p><p>I don't think we need to have a 'best' team because everyone is decent, whether they start the game or not. Djed Spence and Destiny Udogie at left-back are a great example of that - they are just as good as each other, but they are a bit different, depending on what is needed and they all fit into the team.</p><p>We've got the Champions League too but because of how we got there, and also because it has been a couple of years since we were last in there, I don't know what to expect at all - especially under a new manager. I do think we will make the last-16 but then anything could happen.</p><p><b>Blanco's prediction:</b> As I said before, Wolves are terrible! 2-0</p><p><b>Kidwild's prediction:</b> There will be more goals than that - and we are at home as well. 3-0</p><p><b>AI's prediction:</b> 1-0</p></div><p></p><h2 id=\"Sunday-28-September\"><span>Sunday, 28 September</span></h2><p></p><div><div><ul><li><p> Villa Park, 14:00 BST</p></li></ul></div><p>I know Aston Villa beat Bologna in the Europa League on Thursday but they were poor against Sunderland on Sunday.</p><p>The biggest worry for me was that they just didn't seem to connect, even though they were playing against 10 men. It looked like their forwards had never played together before.</p><p>Fulham come into this after winning two league games in a row, against Leeds and Brentford, and they will definitely see this as winnable too.</p><p>Most people have probably been looking at Villa and thinking they have made a poor start and will turn things round, but I've not seen anything to suggest that will happen. </p><p>They will have to create far more than they have been doing if they are going to get their first win of the season. I have given them a goal and a point here, but I am not entirely sure why.</p><p><b>Sutton's prediction:</b> 1-1</p><p><b>Kidwild's prediction:</b> Villa's lack of goals in the league is amazing, so I am going with Fulham. 0-2</p><p><b>Blanco's prediction:</b> I literally put down the same score too - I was talking about this in the barbershop! 0-2</p><p><b>AI's prediction:</b> 1-1</p></div><div><div><ul><li><p> St James' Park, 15:00 BST</p></li></ul></div><p>This has become a bit of a grudge match since Newcastle's <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/67247519\">controversial win</a> at St James' Park in 2023.</p><p>Arsenal have lost on their past three visits but even a draw might not help them much this time, because they cannot afford to fall any further behind Liverpool at the top of the table.</p><p>So, Mikel Arteta really needs a win, but how will he approach this? Does he regard Newcastle as a top side and, if so, will he play his robust midfield trio again in the middle of the park?</p><p>He seems to be quite negative and defensive in games like this, and I think it is a legitimate question to ask if Arsenal can win the Premier League by being that cautious.</p><p>Arteta really needs to go for it more. I am finding Newcastle difficult to predict because they do not score many goals, but they are still hard to beat.</p><p>There are a few reasons why I am backing Arsenal - Bukayo Saka is fit again and, if Eze starts as well, they will carry a real threat. They have got Gabriel Martinelli too - but what happens here is really down to Arteta.</p><p><b>Sutton's prediction:</b> 1-2</p><p><b>Blanco's prediction:</b> Arsenal are getting better every year and they have got such a solid midfield. Eze is flying and Bukayo Saka is coming back, and they will have too much for Newcastle. 1-2</p><p><b>Kidwild's prediction:</b> I agree, but I don't think Newcastle will score. I am not going to be watching, but Arsenal will win. 0-2</p><p><b>AI's prediction:</b> 0-1</p></div><p></p><h2 id=\"Monday-29-September\"><span>Monday, 29 September</span></h2><p></p><div><div><ul><li><p> Hill Dickinson Stadium, 20:00 BST</p></li></ul></div><p>The irony here is that a win for former West Ham boss David Moyes, who their fans wanted to get rid of, could end Graham Potter's time in charge of the Hammers.</p><p>It's hard to see any other outcome, to be honest. Everton are still short of a goalscoring striker but they have stacks of creativity and should have more than enough chances.</p><p>My 606 co-host Roman Kemp described the Hill Dickinson Stadium as a fortress last week. I feel like he went a bit early there, but they should still be too strong for West Ham - I am not sure the Hammers have the stomach for a fight.</p><p><b>Sutton's prediction:</b> 2-0</p><p><b>Blanco's prediction:</b> Everton all the way. Jack Grealish will definitely get an assist - he has been sick all season! 2-0</p><p><b>Kidwild's prediction:</b> Grealish has been good, but I've gone with West Ham to get something. 1-1</p><p><b>AI's prediction:</b> 1-0</p></div><p></p><h2 id=\"How-did-Sutton-do-last-week\"><span>How did Sutton do last week?</span></h2><p></p><div><p>Week five was billed as a battle between Chris Sutton and AI, but it was BBC Sport readers who ended up getting their first win of the season. </p><p>Chris got three correct results with no exact scores from the 10 games, giving him <b>30 points </b>- his lowest tally so far in 2025-26.</p><p>AI did better than him for the first time - also getting three correct results but with two exact scores, for a total of <b>90 points </b>-<b> </b>but that was not enough for overall victory.</p><p>There were three guests, all supporters of Liverpool or Everton - The Coral's James Skelly, Picture Parlour's Katherine Parlour and Starsailor's James Walsh.</p><p>Skelly did the best out of anyone, with seven correct results, including four exact scores, for an impressive total of 190 points, while Walsh (four correct results, three exact scores) and Parlour (one correct result, no exact scores) ended up with 130 and 10 points respectively - giving the guests an average of <b>110 points.</b></p><p>That meant it was the readers who ended up on top, with five correct results and four exact scores, for a total of <b>170 points.</b></p></div><div><div><h2>Weekly wins, ties and total points after week five</h2><div><table><thead><tr><th></th><th>Wins</th><th>Ties</th><th>Points</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Chris</td><td>3</td><td>0</td><td>370</td></tr><tr><td>You</td><td>1</td><td>0</td><td>410</td></tr><tr><td>Guests</td><td>1</td><td>0</td><td>320</td></tr><tr><td>AI</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>320</td></tr></tbody></table></div><p><span><span><p>Source: BBC</p><svg height=\"15\" width=\"45\"></svg></span></span></p></div><p><img alt=\"Weekly wins, ties and total points after week five. .  .\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/920/idt2/idt2/1ba7121e-ffea-48f1-aaa5-1699b0f40861/image/460\" srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/920/idt2/idt2/1ba7121e-ffea-48f1-aaa5-1699b0f40861/image/460 920w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1280/idt2/idt2/1ba7121e-ffea-48f1-aaa5-1699b0f40861/image/640 1280w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1632/idt2/idt2/1ba7121e-ffea-48f1-aaa5-1699b0f40861/image/816 1632w\" /></p></div><div><div><h2>Guest leaderboard 2025-26</h2><div><table><thead><tr><th></th><th>Points</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>James Skelly</td><td>190</td></tr><tr><td>James Walsh</td><td>110</td></tr><tr><td>You *</td><td>82</td></tr><tr><td>Chris Sutton *</td><td>74</td></tr><tr><td>AI *</td><td>62</td></tr><tr><td>Tommy Longhurst</td><td>60</td></tr><tr><td>Orlando Bloom, Theo Ellis</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>& Tom Grennan</td><td>50</td></tr><tr><td>Katherine Parlour</td><td>10</td></tr></tbody></table></div><p><span>* Average after five weeks</span><span><span><p>Source: BBC</p><svg height=\"15\" width=\"45\"></svg></span></span></p></div><p><img alt=\"Guest leaderboard 2025-26. .  * Average after five weeks.\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/920/idt2/idt2/b612ae73-ba19-467b-a49f-7588e5f67d86/image/460\" srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/920/idt2/idt2/b612ae73-ba19-467b-a49f-7588e5f67d86/image/460 920w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1280/idt2/idt2/b612ae73-ba19-467b-a49f-7588e5f67d86/image/640 1280w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1632/idt2/idt2/b612ae73-ba19-467b-a49f-7588e5f67d86/image/816 1632w\" /></p></div><section><p></p><h2>More on this story</h2><p></p></section></article>"

Prosecutors allege he lied to Congress about whether he authorised the leak of classified information to members of the media.</p><p>It doesn't take much to connect the dots, even if Trump's Justice Department insists there is a solid case against the former FBI director and that this is an example of the powerful being held to account.</p><p>\"Today's indictment reflects this Department of Justice's commitment to holding those who abuse positions of power accountable for misleading the American people,\" Bondi posted on X as word of the indictment spread.</p><p>Her assertions aside, if there had been anything left of the once-strong firewall between the department and the White House – long considered sacrosanct by presidents of both parties – it is now gone.</p><p>Laurie Levinson, a former federal prosecutor and law professor at Loyola Marymount University told BBC News that the firewall had \"completely collapsed\" with this case.</p><p>\"This is unprecedented, to have the president basically direct his people to indict a specific individual because he's angry at that person,\" Ms Levinson said, referring to Mr Comey.</p><p>Last week, Trump took to his Truth Social platform to urge Bondi to bring charges against his political foes. He complained the Justice Department was slow to charge Mr Comey, Democrat and California Senator Adam Schiff and New York Attorney General Letitia James - vocal critics who have long been in Trump's crosshairs.</p><p>Ms Levinson said Trump has gone further than former President Richard Nixon - who famously assembled an enemies list - by replacing prosecutors who have resisted his retribution agenda with ones who are willing to execute it.</p><p>Days after the US attorney for the Eastern District of Virginia, Erik Siebert, resigned over fears he would be fired for failing to prosecute James for alleged mortgage fraud, Trump appointed a White House aide to the role.</p><p>Lindsey Halligan, one of Trump's former personal lawyers who has no experience as a federal prosecutor, swiftly brought the Mr Comey case to a grand jury, which agreed there was enough evidence to prosecute.</p><p>\"Everything about this smacks of vindictive prosecution,\" Ms Levinson said.</p><p>To secure an indictment, 12 members of a grand jury only need to vote for probable cause - not proof beyond reasonable doubt. In addition, the grand jury considers the case based solely on evidence by prosecutors, with no defence attorneys present.</p></div><div><p>Annemarie McAvoy, a legal expert and Columbia University professor, notes that prosecutors may have testimony and documentary evidence that supports their case against Mr Comey – evidence that was presented to the grand jury and could be used to build the case against the former director during trial.</p><p>\"There have been questions all along as to whether he was being honest when he said he didn't leak information,\" she said. \"And you know if there are others who are willing to come forward and say, yes, I got the information from James Comey, then potentially they certainly have a case.\"</p><p>In a short statement provided to the media, Mr Comey's attorney said that he denies the charges and that he looks forward to vindication in the courtroom.</p><p>If this case does, in fact, go to trial, it is poised to unearth long-buried drama from the Russian election-meddling investigation of Trump's first term, even though the perjury and obstruction charges are quite tangential and small-bore.</p><p>Trump and his supporters are already treating the prosecution of Mr Comey as an avenue to undermine the credibility of the entire Russia investigation. While that probe found ample evidence of attempts to meddle in the 2016 presidential election, it produced no concrete evidence tying Trump directly to those efforts.</p><p>Kash Patel, Trump's FBI director, called the investigation a \"disgraceful chapter in history\" in a post on X after the indictment was announced. He accused what he said was the \"previous corrupt leadership\" of weaponising the bureau's investigatory power.</p><p>Those same accusations are now being directed at Patel, Bondi and the rest of the Trump team. And perhaps the biggest question hanging over all of this is whether the Mr Comey indictment is just an individual event – a move that might placate a clearly angry president – or a sign of more prosecutions to come.</p></div>"

MPs were in touch with me.\"</p><p>Burnham was at pains to stress that challenging the prime minister was not a decision for him but for the parliamentary party as he is not an MP.</p><p>This need not be a barrier for long, however, should an ally decide to step down to make way for him in a by-election - assuming, of course, that he could get elected standing with a red rosette with Reform UK riding high in the polls.</p><p>If he were to win a Westminster seat, this would be Burnham's third tilt at No 10, having previously lost out to Ed Miliband and Jeremy Corbyn, and he would need the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/live/cgq4zd0lx12t\">backing of at least 80 MPs</a>.</p><p>There does seem to be a supportive cohort of disgruntled Labour MPs, particularly among the 130-strong group who rebelled over welfare reforms and forced Downing Street into a humiliating 11th-hour U-turn.</p><p>But a majority of Labour MPs who replied after being contacted by the BBC said they were against seeing Burnham mount a challenge.</p><p>BBC Radio 5 Live's Matt Chorley asked 320 out of the 399 Labour MPs currently sitting in Parliament for comment.

Millions of people coming to this country, initially temporarily, but then ending up here forever.\"</p><p>Kruger insisted the changes were necessary due to the \"scale and speed\" of immigration from Muslim countries because he said the faith did not easily allow for cultural integration with the \"traditional habits of life of the UK\".</p><p>Politicians like Donald Trump and Boris Johnson should be allowed to speak the \"democratic language\" of \"ordinary people\", he added, rather than \"highfalutin or professional\" words - even when that extends to claiming there is an \"invasion\" of immigrants. </p><p>He said: \"My concern is when whole cities essentially become Muslim, then we've got change that I don't think people voted for and is not consistent with the best interests of our country as a whole.</p><p>\"We are getting a segregated society. We're seeing people living, not just as there's always been in this country, sad to say, class divisions and some cultural divisions, but whole communities living an entirely un-British life.\"</p><p>Kruger claimed present day immigration was unlike previous waves that had seen Jewish and Catholic immigrants come to the UK and successfully integrated because the \"rate of immigration is simply too great and too swift\". </p><p>When asked whether his statements were likely to incite division, the Reform MP claimed these were \"legitimate concerns\" that were causing \"such distress and disquiet in so many communities around the UK\". </p></div><p><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/newsletters/z7hc239\">Sign up for our Politics Essential newsletter</a> to read top political analysis, gain insight from across the UK and stay up to speed with the big moments.

The goal, according to authorities, is to \"rectify negative emotions\" and \"create a more civilised and rational online environment\".</p><p>In the crosshairs are narratives like \"studying is useless\" and \"hard work is useless\", as well as stories that promote \"world-weariness\".</p><p>China has been grappling with an economic slowdown in the wake of a property crisis, high youth unemployment and cut-throat competition for admission to colleges and jobs - all of which have given rise to a sense of disillusionment among its younger generation.</p><p>Young people in China \"have serious questions about future prospects of their lives\" and \"must confront the fact that their livelihood is very likely going to be worse than their parents' generation,\" Simon Sihang Luo, an assistant professor of social sciences at Singapore's Nanyang Technological University, tells the BBC.</p><p>And Beijing's anxiety over the bubbling frustration has shown itself in a wave of sanctions hitting the country's influencers and social media platforms.</p></div><p></p><h2>'Android people'</h2><p></p><div><p>Last week, well-known content creator Hu Chenfeng had his social media accounts scrubbed of all posts. No-one knows why because Chinese officials gave no explanation. But it's widely believed that this was in response to a viral comment that he had recently made, classifying people and items as either \"Apple\" or \"Android\" - with the latter used to describe things that are inferior to the former.</p><p>\"Yours is a typical Android logic, Android person, Android qualification,\" he rattled off during a livestream that has since been widely shared online.</p><p>While the gag was quickly embraced by many Chinese social media users, others accused Hu of sowing social divisions.</p><p>Such obvious jokes about inequality, it seems, have become tricky territory - because they reinforce the divides that the Chinese Communist Party would rather people not dwell on.</p><p>Censorship is not new to the Chinese internet. Anything that suggests criticism of the Party, its leaders, or touches on controversial topics that have political implications, quickly disappears.</p><p>What is unusual about this campaign against pessimism is that it seems to target a range of online behaviour that could create or add to a sense of negativity.</p></div><figure><div><p><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20250919-090805-05e5ba0164-web-2.30.1-2/grey-placeholder.png\" /><img srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/f45e/live/65a6d760-9a66-11f0-a24a-c712ded530dc.jpg.webp 240w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/f45e/live/65a6d760-9a66-11f0-a24a-c712ded530dc.jpg.webp 320w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/f45e/live/65a6d760-9a66-11f0-a24a-c712ded530dc.jpg.webp 480w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/f45e/live/65a6d760-9a66-11f0-a24a-c712ded530dc.jpg.webp 640w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/f45e/live/65a6d760-9a66-11f0-a24a-c712ded530dc.jpg.webp 800w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/f45e/live/65a6d760-9a66-11f0-a24a-c712ded530dc.jpg.webp 1024w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/f45e/live/65a6d760-9a66-11f0-a24a-c712ded530dc.jpg.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/f45e/live/65a6d760-9a66-11f0-a24a-c712ded530dc.jpg.webp\" alt=\"Getty Images The picture shows two women reading instructions on a mobile phone while at a job fair in China's Lianyungang City. \" /><span>Getty Images</span></p></div><p></p><figcaption>China is grappling with a range of economic challenges, including youth unemployment</figcaption><p></p></figure><div><p>Zhang Xuefeng, a famous online tutor known for his fiery rhetoric on education and social issues, sparked controversy earlier this month when he pledged to donate at least 100 million Chinese yuan ($14m; £10.4m) if Beijing decided to invade Taiwan. But it wasn't until this week that he became the target of Chinese censors.</p><p>His social media accounts - which have millions of followers - have been blocked from gaining new followers, local media reported on Wednesday.</p><p>When asked about this, one of Mr Zhang's employees told state-owned news outlet The Paper that he was \"reflecting\" on it.</p><p>Again, it's hard to know why he is being reprimanded but some have wondered if it's the underlying message in his broadcasts - in an unfair world, you must make only practical choices. And many students and parents follow him for his brutally honest advice - instead of telling young people to follow their dreams, he often told them they must face the reality their exam scores and financial pressures dictated. His was a platform that may well have been ideal for despondency.</p></div><p></p><h2>Always sunny on the Chinese internet</h2><p></p><div><p>It's not just individuals though. China wants social media platforms to play a part too in its massive internet clean-up.</p><p>This month, the Cyberspace Administration said it would mete out \"strict punishments\" against social media apps Xiaohongshu, Kuaishou and Weibo for failing to rein in \"negative\" content, such as \"sensationalising celebrities' personal updates\" and other \"trivial information\".</p><p>\"A clear and healthy cyberspace is in the interests of the people,\" said the Cyberspace Administration.</p><p>But any attempts to keep China's cyberspace unnaturally sunny is sure to come at a cost.</p><p>\"The expression of pessimist sentiments doesn't necessarily mean a fundamental rejection of participating in the labour market and society at large,\" says Dr Luo.</p><p>But being deprived of \"relief after venting these sentiments\", he says, \"might make it even worse for their collective mental status\".</p><p>Yet the pressures - the ones that are pushing more Chinese youth to quit the rat race, \"lie flat\" and take their frustrations out online - remain. Many of them have been moving back into their parents' homes, unable to find work, or craving a break from exhausting jobs - it's happening enough that they call themselves \"full-time\" children. </p><p>And <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c3e95lny0x9o\">recent research shows that there indeed is growing pessimism about future prospects</a> in China. Experts say the Party is well-aware of it, which is why it is trying to crack down on the evidence. But will that work?</p><p>\"If anything, contemporary Chinese history has repeatedly demonstrated that top-down ideological campaigns can hardly eradicate the social roots of problems,\" says Dr Luo.</p><p>\"Even with a powerful government like the Chinese one, it is hard to arrest pessimist sentiments when the economy looks bleak, the job market is cruelly competitive, and birth rate hits rock bottom.\"</p></div></article>"
