He has seen off Liverpool's Mohamed Salah, who recorded more goal involvements than any other player in Europe's top five leagues last season, Real Madrid's Kylian Mbappe, who scored more goals, and the brilliance of Barcelona's Lamine Yamal and Raphinha.</p><p>Dembele's transformation began at Barcelona a couple of years before he joined PSG as he started to see things differently. But he loved the idea of being a star and he was invited to be ambitious at PSG.</p><p>Mbappe's exit from the French club to join Real Madrid - ironically a move many predicted would cement his place as the world's best player - proved the final piece in the much-puzzled-over jigsaw for Dembele as manager Luis Enrique told him, we now want goals from you and we want you to be egotistical.</p><p>The coaching staff just kept saying to him 'Ballon d'Or, Ballon d'Or, Ballon d'Or'.</p></div><div><figure><p><span><picture><source srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/240/cpsprodpb/c4b2/live/a1358970-9863-11f0-b567-dbb771c68d85.jpg.webp 240w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/320/cpsprodpb/c4b2/live/a1358970-9863-11f0-b567-dbb771c68d85.jpg.webp 320w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/480/cpsprodpb/c4b2/live/a1358970-9863-11f0-b567-dbb771c68d85.jpg.webp 480w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/624/cpsprodpb/c4b2/live/a1358970-9863-11f0-b567-dbb771c68d85.jpg.webp 624w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/800/cpsprodpb/c4b2/live/a1358970-9863-11f0-b567-dbb771c68d85.jpg.webp 800w\" type=\"image/webp\"></source><img alt=\"Ousmane Dembele\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/819/cpsprodpb/c4b2/live/a1358970-9863-11f0-b567-dbb771c68d85.jpg\" srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/240/cpsprodpb/c4b2/live/a1358970-9863-11f0-b567-dbb771c68d85.jpg 240w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/320/cpsprodpb/c4b2/live/a1358970-9863-11f0-b567-dbb771c68d85.jpg 320w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/480/cpsprodpb/c4b2/live/a1358970-9863-11f0-b567-dbb771c68d85.jpg 480w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/624/cpsprodpb/c4b2/live/a1358970-9863-11f0-b567-dbb771c68d85.jpg 624w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/800/cpsprodpb/c4b2/live/a1358970-9863-11f0-b567-dbb771c68d85.jpg 800w\" /></picture></span><span><span>Image source, </span>Getty Images</span></p><figcaption><span>Image caption, </span><p>Ousmane Dembele helped PSG to a treble last season</p></figcaption></figure></div><p></p><h2 id=\"How-Dembele-thrived-from-Mbappes-exit\"><span>How Dembele thrived from Mbappe's exit</span></h2><p></p><div><p>In August 2023, PSG bought the France international for just £43.5m, and he scored six goals and made 14 assists as PSG won the league and cup double.</p><p>He was far from the main man though with the club's record scorer Mbappe netting 44 in all competitions in the best of his seven seasons for PSG. It turned out to be his last as Real Madrid came calling.</p><p>A new-look PSG needed a new leader and talisman. Step forward Dembele.</p><p>And step forward he certainly did. His 51 goal involvements was more than twice his best in a single campaign in his whole career, while his 35 goals was 21 more than he'd managed before.</p><p>Last summer, manager Luis Enrique told Dembele that without Mbappe in the team he needed more goals from him to go with his large number of assists - carte blanche for the player to show a more selfish approach with less passing and a bigger desire to score.</p><p>In private, the coaching staff have frequently told him that if he managed to convert a decent percentage of the chances he creates, it could lead to collective success and then individual honours.</p><p>Dembele took it all on board and has relished playing in his new tactical role.</p><p>In 2023-24, he was mostly played on the right. There was no way of dislodging Mbappe from the central role.</p><p>Now he mostly operates as a false nine, inside, where he touches the ball more, enjoys a greater freedom to receive passes and participates in the build-up but with more chances to finish.</p><p>A new role and a new man.</p></div><p></p><h2 id=\"Injuries-attitude-inconsistency-what-changed\"><span>Injuries, attitude & inconsistency - what changed?</span></h2><p></p><div><p>To put Dembele's transformation solely down to Mbappe's Real move would be wrong. That was simply the final step.</p><p>Despite being largely injury free at Rennes and Dortmund, he sustained 14 muscle injuries in his time at the Nou Camp, spending 784 days sidelined.</p><p>Concerns over discipline and professionalism led the club to assign private chefs to him, while late nights because of gaming affected his training punctuality, making him the club's most-fined player in recent years.</p><p>Still, when fit, his explosive pace and dribbling made him a game-changer, as he showed glimpses of the talent Barcelona invested in.</p><p>So what changed him?</p><p>Those that know Dembele best - and few do - say he changed after marrying his girlfriend Rima in Morocco in December 2021, and soon after he had a child.</p><p>The wedding came as a surprise to many of his team-mates, not least because they did not even know he had a partner.</p><p>So the big changes to his life occurred in his last two seasons at Barcelona when, essentially, he grew up.</p><p>Dembele worked at home with a physiotherapist and frequently went to France to receive specialised preventative treatments. With the eyes and mind of a father, he began to see things differently.</p><p>He finally took on board the importance of good nutrition and, for the past few seasons, has employed a French nutritionist who has helped him maintain a healthier lifestyle.</p><p>For some time many believed that a Champions League triumph for PSG would be dependent on the on-field achievements of one of France's heroes. They also believed that French hero would go on to become the world's best.</p><p>They were right - just not with Mbappe, but a rejuvenated Dembele.</p></div><section><p></p><h2>More on this story</h2><p></p></section></article></div>"

And that is why she has been crowned women's Ballon d'Or winner for an unprecedented third time.</p><p>While Spain were unable to add to their World Cup triumph two years earlier, it was still another spectacular season for the Barcelona midfielder, who won a domestic treble with her club and also reached the Champions League final.</p><p>The 2024-25 campaign was one without either of the biggest prizes for club or country with Bonmati, yet it was successful nevertheless.</p><p>She was once again vital to Barcelona, netting 12 times and assisting a further six goals in the league.</p><p>It may not have been an unblemished season in the league for her club, but they still finished eight points ahead of second-placed Real Madrid.</p><p>In the Champions League she shone - despite Barcelona being unable to retain their title and losing the final to Arsenal.</p><p>Bonmati was named the competition's player of the season by Uefa, registering nine goal contributions in her 11 appearances and scoring in their 4-1 semi-final second-leg win at Chelsea.</p><p>Once again, her world-class quality was evident.</p></div><p></p><h2 id=\"Coming-back-to-make-history-at-Euros\"><span>Coming back to make history at Euros</span></h2><p></p><div><p>Understandably, suffering from a bout of viral meningitis just days before the tournament began meant it was not a perfect Euros for Bonmati.</p><p>Yet, after returning, she helped make history.</p><p>Bonmati had almost missed the tournament, but came back and scored the winner in extra time as Spain beat Germany to reach the final.</p><p>\"Scoring in a game like this one is super special. If I can help the team write history, it's very special,\" she said.</p><p>Sometimes, it takes a player of Bonmati's calibre to make the difference in the pivotal moments - and that is what she did, getting the all-important goal in a knockout stage which was otherwise somewhat muted.</p><p>Despite winning the World Cup in 2023, Spain had never made it to a final of a Euros. Having arrived as favourites, losing on penalties to England meant it was far from ideal for her country, but that does not detract from the incredible story of her comeback.</p></div><p></p><h2 id=\"Barca-legends-starstudded-career\"><span>Barca legend's star-studded career</span></h2><p></p><div><figure><p><span><picture><source srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/240/cpsprodpb/c695/live/45ba6950-97fd-11f0-bbd1-054b8823316c.jpg.webp 240w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/320/cpsprodpb/c695/live/45ba6950-97fd-11f0-bbd1-054b8823316c.jpg.webp 320w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/480/cpsprodpb/c695/live/45ba6950-97fd-11f0-bbd1-054b8823316c.jpg.webp 480w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/624/cpsprodpb/c695/live/45ba6950-97fd-11f0-bbd1-054b8823316c.jpg.webp 624w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/800/cpsprodpb/c695/live/45ba6950-97fd-11f0-bbd1-054b8823316c.jpg.webp 800w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/976/cpsprodpb/c695/live/45ba6950-97fd-11f0-bbd1-054b8823316c.jpg.webp 976w\" type=\"image/webp\"></source><img alt=\"Aitana Bonmati with Barcelona fans\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/1024/cpsprodpb/c695/live/45ba6950-97fd-11f0-bbd1-054b8823316c.jpg\" srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/240/cpsprodpb/c695/live/45ba6950-97fd-11f0-bbd1-054b8823316c.jpg 240w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/320/cpsprodpb/c695/live/45ba6950-97fd-11f0-bbd1-054b8823316c.jpg 320w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/480/cpsprodpb/c695/live/45ba6950-97fd-11f0-bbd1-054b8823316c.jpg 480w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/624/cpsprodpb/c695/live/45ba6950-97fd-11f0-bbd1-054b8823316c.jpg 624w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/800/cpsprodpb/c695/live/45ba6950-97fd-11f0-bbd1-054b8823316c.jpg 800w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/976/cpsprodpb/c695/live/45ba6950-97fd-11f0-bbd1-054b8823316c.jpg 976w\" /></picture></span><span><span>Image source, </span>Getty Images</span></p><figcaption><span>Image caption, </span><p>Aitana Bonmati has helped Barcelona become Spanish champions on three occasions and European champions three times, although they lost to Arsenal in the 2024-25 Champions League final</p></figcaption></figure></div><div><p>Bonmati's list of accolades is a lengthy one.</p><p>She has now won the Ballon d'Or in 2023, 2024 and 2025, and was the Fifa Best women's player in 2023 and 2024.</p><p>She has been crowned the Champions League player of the season three times and won the competition as many times.</p><p>Her trophy haul with Barcelona is impressive - seven league titles, three European crowns, nine Copas de la Reina and five Spanish Super Cups.</p><p>The La Masia graduate is undoubtedly one of the best to play the game.</p></div><p></p><h2 id=\"Ballon-dOr-Feminin-top-10-and-selected-others\"><span>Ballon d'Or Feminin top 10 and selected others</span></h2><p></p><div><p>1: Aitana Bonmati (Barcelona, Spain)</p><p>2: Mariona Caldentey (Arsenal, Spain)</p><p>3: Alessia Russo (Arsenal, England)</p><p>4: Alexia Putellas (Barcelona, Spain)</p><p>5: Chloe Kelly (Manchester City, Arsenal, England)</p><p>6: Patricia Guijarro (Barcelona, Spain)</p><p>7: Leah Williamson (Arsenal, England)</p><p>8: Ewa Pajor (Barcelona, Poland)</p><p>9: Lucy Bronze (Chelsea, England)</p><p>10: Hannah Hampton (Chelsea, England)</p><p>15: Sandy Baltimore (Chelsea, France)</p><p>20: Pernille Harder (Bayern Munich, Denmark)</p><p>23: Johanna Rytting Kaneryd (Chelsea, Sweden)</p><p>25: Emily Fox (Arsenal, USA)</p><p>27: Frida Maanum (Arsenal, Norway)</p><p>29: Steph Catley (Arsenal, Australia)</p><p>30: Caroline Weir (Real Madrid, Scotland)</p></div><section><p></p><h2>More on this story</h2><p></p></section></article></div>"

Long throws must be used. If a player's not comfortable, you don't use it. But if they are, you do,\" says Allardyce. </p><p>Excluding penalties, no team scored more than Sunderland's 14 goals from dead-ball situations that season. They avoided relegation by two points.</p><p>\"In my time, the overall targets with our players would be trying to be greater than what the average stats in the Premier League were,\" Allardyce explains.</p><p>\"Defensively we had to be better than the rest of the bottom eight and scoring more, if not in open play but with set-pieces.\"</p><p>So far this season, 27.7% of non-penalty goals in the Premier League have come from set-pieces, more than any campaign in the past 15 years.</p><p>With Arsenal the most potent Premier League side in this regard in the past two seasons, their set-piece coach Nicolas Jover was even celebrated with a fan-painted mural near Emirates Stadium.</p><p>Allardyce believes the Frenchman, and his fellow dead-ball trainers, are trendsetters.</p><p>\"There's more and more set-play coaches than ever before,\" the 70-year-old continues.</p><p>\"Arsenal have done very well on that. They've changed slightly this year because everybody's had to spend a lot of time trying to stop them against that particular corner.\"</p><p>How do you best utilise a corner though?</p><p>\"The beauty is who puts the ball in the box. Arsenal's players put the ball in the right areas nearly all of the time,\" Allardyce explains.</p><p>\"If you haven't got that player, your set-pieces fail.\"</p></div><div><figure><p><span><picture><source srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/240/cpsprodpb/dded/live/3cc75000-965f-11f0-937e-e53bdd730b8c.jpg.webp 240w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/320/cpsprodpb/dded/live/3cc75000-965f-11f0-937e-e53bdd730b8c.jpg.webp 320w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/480/cpsprodpb/dded/live/3cc75000-965f-11f0-937e-e53bdd730b8c.jpg.webp 480w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/624/cpsprodpb/dded/live/3cc75000-965f-11f0-937e-e53bdd730b8c.jpg.webp 624w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/800/cpsprodpb/dded/live/3cc75000-965f-11f0-937e-e53bdd730b8c.jpg.webp 800w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/976/cpsprodpb/dded/live/3cc75000-965f-11f0-937e-e53bdd730b8c.jpg.webp 976w\" type=\"image/webp\"></source><img alt=\"Arsenal set-piece coach Nicolas Jover watches their Carabao Cup quarter-final against Crystal Palace\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/2560/cpsprodpb/dded/live/3cc75000-965f-11f0-937e-e53bdd730b8c.jpg\" srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/240/cpsprodpb/dded/live/3cc75000-965f-11f0-937e-e53bdd730b8c.jpg 240w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/320/cpsprodpb/dded/live/3cc75000-965f-11f0-937e-e53bdd730b8c.jpg 320w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/480/cpsprodpb/dded/live/3cc75000-965f-11f0-937e-e53bdd730b8c.jpg 480w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/624/cpsprodpb/dded/live/3cc75000-965f-11f0-937e-e53bdd730b8c.jpg 624w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/800/cpsprodpb/dded/live/3cc75000-965f-11f0-937e-e53bdd730b8c.jpg 800w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/976/cpsprodpb/dded/live/3cc75000-965f-11f0-937e-e53bdd730b8c.jpg 976w\" /></picture></span><span><span>Image source, </span>Getty Images</span></p><figcaption><span>Image caption, </span><p>Set-piece coaches like Arsenal's Nicolas Jover are becoming increasingly influential</p></figcaption></figure></div><p></p><h2 id=\"Play-4-Have-an-element-of-surprise\"><span>Play #4: Have an element of surprise</span></h2><p></p><div><p>Allardyce was never afraid of trying something new, and his advice is clear for any young coach hesitant about testing their own tactical innovation - be different.</p><p>\"The continuing brainwashing of 'you can only play in this way', up until recently scared the living daylights out of coaches, particularly young coaches,\" he says.</p><p>\"Coaches are fearful of bringing in a great tool because of the criticism, not only from the fans, but maybe certain journalists.\"</p><p>So could teams mixing things up, employing long throws or lumping the ball straight out from the kick-off - another tactic adapted from rugby - be the new normal?</p><p>\"After a few weeks go by, everybody else all over the pitch knows what's coming.

    "body": "<div><p><b>In 1983 the Ryder Cup was in danger of dying. </b></p><p>Decades of American dominance had sucked the jeopardy and therefore the interest out of the biennial contest between the United States and Great Britain. </p><p>The addition of Irish players in 1973 had made minimal impact. Emphatic defeats continued. </p><p>At the request of American great Jack Nicklaus, GB&I had morphed into Europe by 1979. But still the US were romping home. By six points in '79. By nine in '81.</p><p>\"It wouldn't have lasted another two matches,\" said Tony Jacklin, the most important captain in Ryder Cup history.</p><p>The now 81-year-old will be at Bethpage for this week's latest instalment as he marks a \"scarcely believable\" 40 years since being Europe's defibrillator, at The Belfry in 1985. </p><p>Jacklin backed up that first win by masterminding a first away triumph by any team from this side of the Atlantic in 1987. It was an incredible reversal in fortunes. From one win in 40 years, to two in two.</p><p>That the two-time major winner was even involved was remarkable in itself.</p><p>The Englishman, who blazed a trail as the best player from these shores throughout the 1960s and '70s, played in seven Ryder Cups during that period before eventually declaring himself \"done\" after being left out of the 1981 side.</p><p>He knew something had to change but was \"frustrated and angry\" with the approach of some of his peers. From being a central figure, suddenly \"the Ryder Cup meant nothing\" to him.</p><p>Then, in early 1983, six months out from what was expected to be another shellacking in the US, Jacklin was asked to captain the side.</p><p>\"I was in shock,\" Jacklin told BBC Sport. \"I was so in shock that I said I needed to sleep on it.\"</p><p>From vanquished to visionary, player to pioneer, this is how Jacklin resurrected the Ryder Cup.</p></div><div><p></p><h2 id=\"Nothing-changes-as-Europeans-come-on-board\"><span>'Nothing changes as Europeans come on board'</span></h2><p></p></div><div><figure><p><span><picture><source srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/240/cpsprodpb/00a9/live/4d38acc0-92d3-11f0-8331-8bf79809c794.jpg.webp 240w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/320/cpsprodpb/00a9/live/4d38acc0-92d3-11f0-8331-8bf79809c794.jpg.webp 320w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/480/cpsprodpb/00a9/live/4d38acc0-92d3-11f0-8331-8bf79809c794.jpg.webp 480w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/624/cpsprodpb/00a9/live/4d38acc0-92d3-11f0-8331-8bf79809c794.jpg.webp 624w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/800/cpsprodpb/00a9/live/4d38acc0-92d3-11f0-8331-8bf79809c794.jpg.webp 800w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/976/cpsprodpb/00a9/live/4d38acc0-92d3-11f0-8331-8bf79809c794.jpg.webp 976w\" type=\"image/webp\"></source><img alt=\"Tom Watson and Jack Nicklaus in conversation during the 1981 Ryder Cup at Walton Heath\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/2560/cpsprodpb/00a9/live/4d38acc0-92d3-11f0-8331-8bf79809c794.jpg\" srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/240/cpsprodpb/00a9/live/4d38acc0-92d3-11f0-8331-8bf79809c794.jpg 240w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/320/cpsprodpb/00a9/live/4d38acc0-92d3-11f0-8331-8bf79809c794.jpg 320w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/480/cpsprodpb/00a9/live/4d38acc0-92d3-11f0-8331-8bf79809c794.jpg 480w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/624/cpsprodpb/00a9/live/4d38acc0-92d3-11f0-8331-8bf79809c794.jpg 624w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/800/cpsprodpb/00a9/live/4d38acc0-92d3-11f0-8331-8bf79809c794.jpg 800w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/976/cpsprodpb/00a9/live/4d38acc0-92d3-11f0-8331-8bf79809c794.jpg 976w\" /></picture></span><span><span>Image source, </span>Getty Images</span></p><figcaption><span>Image caption, </span><p>Tom Watson and Jack Nicklaus won three matches together as the US domination continued at Walton Heath in 1981</p></figcaption></figure></div><div><p>Jacklin considered himself a winner, always striving for improvements. In 1969 he became the first Englishman in 18 years to win The Open. He followed that in 1970 by clinching the US Open. The only other Englishman to win both is Jim Barnes, in the 1920s.</p><p>But six of his seven Ryder Cup appearances ended in heavy losses. </p><p>The outlier was the 16-16 draw at Royal Birkdale in 1969, which was secured when Nicklaus conceded Jacklin's three-foot putt on the last hole in what has gone down as one of sport's great moments.</p><p>The margin of defeat was 15 points on his debut in 1967, and throughout the 1970s the gap was never fewer than five.</p><p>In 1977, the final match as GB&I, the number of matches was reduced.</p><p>Sir Nick Faldo, who won all three of his rubbers on his debut in that edition at Royal Lytham and St Anne's, told BBC Sport: \"We played only one session per day because they didn't want the thought that America would be so far ahead that the singles would be obsolete.\"</p><p>The US still won 12½-7½.</p><p>In came the European blood for 1979. Newly crowned Open champion Severiano Ballesteros and his fellow Spaniard Antonio Garrido bolstered the dozen heading to West Virginia. But little changed.</p><p>\"We went to The Greenbrier and they didn't know who we were or what to call it,\" recalled Faldo. \"I've got a little plate which has the International Ryder Cup on it.\"</p><p>A sense of frustration was palpable in Jacklin as he recalled what turned out to be his final appearance as a player.</p><p>\"It was all done on a shoestring budget,\" he said. \"It was all too similar to what I'd experienced before, when you couldn't take your own caddie, the players wore anything they were given and thought their only job was to turn up.</p><p>\"But the Americans were treated like kings. First-class travel, nice clothes.\"</p><p>Jacklin also still rails against the \"disruptive\" behaviour of Mark James and Ken Brown at that Ryder Cup.</p><p>\"They did every bloody thing they could to jeopardise our chances,\" he said. \"They were like spoilt children. They didn't turn up to meetings at the right time, they wore the wrong clothes.</p><p>\"They were a total disgrace, and I would have sent them home if I'd have been the captain.\"</p><p>European skipper John Jacobs was also unimpressed, saying they turned up \"dressed as though they were going on a camping holiday\".</p><p>James, who would go on to captain Europe to a narrow defeat at Brookline in 1999, received a £1,500 fine for \"unprofessional conduct\".</p><p>Brown, who has forged a career as a successful TV commentator, later admitted \"it wasn't the greatest moment of my career\". He was fined £1,000 and given a one-year ban from international duty.</p><p>A US team that featured eight rookies and was without leading players Nicklaus, who failed to qualify, and Tom Watson - absent for the birth of his first child - still pulled away in the singles to win 17-11.</p><p>The 1981 edition was even more lopsided. Generally regarded as the best dozen ever assembled, with 11 players having won major titles, the US rampaged to an 18½-9½ victory at Walton Heath in Surrey.</p><p>Jacklin was left out of the side, with Jacobs preferring the \"disgraced\" James. Also on the sidelines, incredibly, was Ballesteros.</p><p>The mercurial Spaniard had become the first European to win the Masters in 1980, adding to his 1979 Open triumph, but was at loggerheads with the tour over appearance fees.</p><p>It was the final straw for Jacklin. \"After that happened, I was done with the Ryder Cup,\" he said.</p><p>\"Seve was at his absolute zenith. He was Tiger Woods before Tiger Woods existed.</p><p>\"I didn't think they were interested in winning. I thought they were only interested in having a team that could get beaten up.\"</p></div><div><p></p><h2 id=\"Seve-you-are-his-father-here\"><span>'Seve, you are his father here'</span></h2><p></p></div><div><figure><p><span><picture><source srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/240/cpsprodpb/f9ca/live/678d6290-92cf-11f0-a72d-3fad567a173a.jpg.webp 240w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/320/cpsprodpb/f9ca/live/678d6290-92cf-11f0-a72d-3fad567a173a.jpg.webp 320w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/480/cpsprodpb/f9ca/live/678d6290-92cf-11f0-a72d-3fad567a173a.jpg.webp 480w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/624/cpsprodpb/f9ca/live/678d6290-92cf-11f0-a72d-3fad567a173a.jpg.webp 624w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/800/cpsprodpb/f9ca/live/678d6290-92cf-11f0-a72d-3fad567a173a.jpg.webp 800w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/976/cpsprodpb/f9ca/live/678d6290-92cf-11f0-a72d-3fad567a173a.jpg.webp 976w\" type=\"image/webp\"></source><img alt=\"Seve Ballesteros at the 1983 Ryder Cup\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/2560/cpsprodpb/f9ca/live/678d6290-92cf-11f0-a72d-3fad567a173a.jpg\" srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/240/cpsprodpb/f9ca/live/678d6290-92cf-11f0-a72d-3fad567a173a.jpg 240w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/320/cpsprodpb/f9ca/live/678d6290-92cf-11f0-a72d-3fad567a173a.jpg 320w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/480/cpsprodpb/f9ca/live/678d6290-92cf-11f0-a72d-3fad567a173a.jpg 480w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/624/cpsprodpb/f9ca/live/678d6290-92cf-11f0-a72d-3fad567a173a.jpg 624w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/800/cpsprodpb/f9ca/live/678d6290-92cf-11f0-a72d-3fad567a173a.jpg 800w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/976/cpsprodpb/f9ca/live/678d6290-92cf-11f0-a72d-3fad567a173a.jpg 976w\" /></picture></span><span><span>Image source, </span>Getty Images</span></p><figcaption><span>Image caption, </span><p>Ballesteros hit a 3-wood from a bunker on the 18th that helped him secure a half point in the singles at the 1983 Ryder Cup - which Nicklaus has described as the \"greatest shot I ever saw\"</p></figcaption></figure></div><div><p>Six months before the 1983 contest, Europe had no captain for the matches at PGA National in Florida.</p><p>They turned to Jacklin. Having got over the shock of being asked to step in, he went to the European Tour's hierarchy with a list of demands.</p><p>\"I saw it as an opportunity to make a difference,\" he said. \"So I started reeling off six or seven things that I wanted. First-class tickets on Concorde, the best clothes, a team room, our caddies to travel with us. They said yes to everything.</p><p>\"And then I said 'what about Seve?'. I knew he was as mad as I was.</p><p>\"I was told 'well you've accepted the job so he's your problem now'.\"</p><p>The new skipper summoned Ballesteros to the Prince of Wales hotel in Southport -  a coastal town steeped in Ryder Cup history having hosted three editions of the contest - and over breakfast sold him the dream.</p><p>Jacklin needed the fiery Spaniard on board if he was to breathe new life into the competition.</p><p>Ballesteros, who won the third of his five majors at that year's Masters, \"was venting about everything\" but he also listened.</p><p>\"I told him the things that I had insisted upon. And I told him I couldn't do it without him. He said 'OK, I'll help you'.\"</p><p>Jacklin then went to Palm Beach Gardens and met with US skipper Nicklaus to discuss accommodation options and the all-important team room. Time was short though. And the qualification criteria had been set.</p><p>The top 12 would qualify, Jacklin would have no say in the team.</p><p>But he had an incredible crop of talent breaking through, with future major champions Faldo, Bernhard Langer, Sandy Lyle and Ian Woosnam joining Ballesteros in providing a spine that would dominate the rest of the decade.</p><p>The match was level at 8-8 after the opening two days. It was the first time there had been parity going into the singles.</p><p>Faldo and Langer were paired together four times and won three of their matches. Ballesteros, who had made an inauspicious debut in 1979, winning one and losing four of his matches, secured 2½ points from four outings with 20-year-old rookie Paul Way.</p><p>Ballesteros, who was himself only 26, initially complained about how much he had to help the Englishman. But it had been an inspired move by the skipper.</p><p>\"He said, 'I feel like his father',\" recalled Jacklin. \"I said, 'Seve, you are his father in here, with your experience, that's why you're playing with him'. And then the penny dropped.</p><p>\"It might sound silly but Seve was difficult to partner, because he had such an incredible presence. But Paul had his own self-confidence and didn't fear him.\"</p><p>Jacklin stacked the top of his singles with his strongest players. Nicklaus put his strongest players out last.</p><p>Ballesteros went three holes up on Fuzzy Zoeller but was pegged back and needed a miraculous 245-yard 3-wood out of a bunker to pick up a half point in the top match. Langer and Faldo delivered wins. Way and Brown also secured full points and it was 13-13 with two matches on the course.</p><p>A sensational Lanny Wadkins chip on the 18th rescued what would turn out to be a crucial half point for the home side before Watson beat Bernard Gallacher on the 17th to clinch a narrow 14½-13½ triumph.</p><p>\"We did everything but win,\" was Jacklin's verdict. \"But there was a different vibe to the whole thing. All of a sudden, this is what it's about.</p><p>\"It went right down to the wire and we were all gutted.</p><p>\"But Seve was saying this is something to be happy about. This is the best we've ever done in America. We should not be so sad.\"</p></div><div><p></p><h2 id=\"The-missed-putt-that-saved-the-Ryder-Cup\"><span>The missed putt that saved the Ryder Cup?</span></h2><p></p></div><div><p>Given the strides made on and off the course, Jacklin was the natural choice to continue as captain. He returned home and spent time looking back on the defeat, \"wondering if there was anything I had overlooked\".</p><p>\"Nothing jumped out at me,\" he said. \"There were no complaints from the players, so we went with the same strategy for 1985.\"</p><p>Expectation levels had been raised in Europe, but as close as they had got in Florida, the competition was in dire need of a different winner. </p><p>Reports suggest about 16,000 fans watched the walloping at Walton Heath. Four years later around 90,000 were at The Belfry, just outside Birmingham.</p><p>But Europe got off to a slow start. They trailed 3-1 after Friday's opening foursomes. Faldo, who had been one of Jacklin's three captain's picks, asked to be rested after barely contributing as he and Langer were beaten.</p><p>\"It's the worst feeling in the world trying to play for a team and you can't do it,\" said Faldo, who was going through a swing change at the time.</p><p>\"I said to Tony 'don't play me for the rest of the week'. I had a rotten week and I didn't feel part of it. It's why I stayed in my room for the celebrations.\"</p><p>Jacklin was not surprised by Faldo's call and left him out until Sunday's singles.</p><p>\"He wanted the best for the team,\" he said. \"We all did. The team came first. This is the most selfless thing we do, whether as a captain or player.</p><p>\"Your own individual achievements and ego, leave them outside, they don't go into that team room.\"</p><p>But there was no panic from Jacklin. \"You don't start jumping around, changing,\" he said.</p><p>\"It's patience, self-belief, and knowing that you've prepared.\"</p><p>Europe edged the afternoon fourballs to trail 3½-4½ overnight and then the momentum flipped on an 18-inch putt on the Saturday morning.</p><p>Craig Stadler inexplicably stabbed the ball wide of the hole to allow Open champion Lyle and Langer to snatch a half point from a match in which they had been two down with two to play. </p><p>It left the overall score 6-6 with two sessions remaining. It was only a half point, but it felt much bigger than that.</p><p>Was it the miss that saved the Ryder Cup? </p><p>As Stadler pointed out, there was still a lot of golf to play. But the statistics show that of the 16 matches played after that putt, Europe claimed 10½ points to the US' 5½. They have since won 11 of 17 editions.</p><p>Europe won the afternoon session 3-1 to take a 9-7 lead into the 12 singles, which historically had been dominated by the US.</p><p>But European blue flooded the top of the scoreboard. Manuel Pinero, Way, Lyle and Langer all won, while Ballesteros added a half point. In the top eight matches, only Woosnam was beaten.</p><p>It left a platform for Sam Torrance to clinch victory with a famous putt and an iconic celebration against Andy North.</p><p>It took Europe over the winning line, and the hosts were eventually comfortable 16½-11½ winners as they ended a 28-year unbeaten run by the US. </p><p>\"I can't believe it's 40 years since we stood on that roof celebrating,\" smiled Jacklin, who would lead the side to two wins, one tie and one defeat as captain.</p><p>\"It was fantastic, but it was just really the beginning.

They buy their season tickets for home matches, and travel the country following their team away, too.</b></p><p>For others, going to a game in England's top tier is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity which they save up and take extended time away from their regular lives for.</p><p>Last weekend, James from South Korea travelled 5,500 miles to Brighton to watch his beloved Tottenham play for the first time, paying £900 for a ticket from an unauthorised resale website. When he tried to enter the stadium, he was turned away.</p><p>After the BBC exposed the industrial-scale black market in Premier League tickets last week, Brighton invited us along to demonstrate how widespread the problem is, and how they are trying to combat it.</p></div><div><p>The ticket James bought had already been deactivated when he tried to scan it to enter the Amex stadium. He was advised to go to the ticket office, where Brighton staff informed him his ticket had been purchased illegitimately.</p><p>\"I'm disappointed. I didn't understand this rule,\" he said outside the stadium, visibly upset.</p><p>\"I have been told I should try and get a refund for the ticket.\"</p><p>More than 200 more like James also had their tickets for the match cancelled in the same way.</p><p>Reselling is against UK law but many websites continue to operate by being based outside the country.</p><p>The BBC's investigation found that resellers often use bot software and fake identities to hoover up hundreds of tickets to be sold on for higher prices, and can leave fans paying extortionate prices or completely out of pocket after buying tickets that don't work.</p><p>\"Long-term supporters are finding it impossible to get tickets because of the way they are made available through secondary agencies,\" says Tom Greatrex, chair of the Football Supporters' Association.</p><p>\"This is becoming endemic across the game.\"</p></div><div><figure><p><span><picture><source srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/240/cpsprodpb/5e6f/live/89bc9e70-97da-11f0-b48d-eb3b631c9a51.jpg.webp 240w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/320/cpsprodpb/5e6f/live/89bc9e70-97da-11f0-b48d-eb3b631c9a51.jpg.webp 320w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/480/cpsprodpb/5e6f/live/89bc9e70-97da-11f0-b48d-eb3b631c9a51.jpg.webp 480w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/624/cpsprodpb/5e6f/live/89bc9e70-97da-11f0-b48d-eb3b631c9a51.jpg.webp 624w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/800/cpsprodpb/5e6f/live/89bc9e70-97da-11f0-b48d-eb3b631c9a51.jpg.webp 800w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/976/cpsprodpb/5e6f/live/89bc9e70-97da-11f0-b48d-eb3b631c9a51.jpg.webp 976w\" type=\"image/webp\"></source><img alt=\"Staff sit behind desks in the Brighton ticket office at the Amex Stadium before the Premier League match against Tottenham as fans queue with ticket queries\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/3840/cpsprodpb/5e6f/live/89bc9e70-97da-11f0-b48d-eb3b631c9a51.jpg\" srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/240/cpsprodpb/5e6f/live/89bc9e70-97da-11f0-b48d-eb3b631c9a51.jpg 240w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/320/cpsprodpb/5e6f/live/89bc9e70-97da-11f0-b48d-eb3b631c9a51.jpg 320w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/480/cpsprodpb/5e6f/live/89bc9e70-97da-11f0-b48d-eb3b631c9a51.jpg 480w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/624/cpsprodpb/5e6f/live/89bc9e70-97da-11f0-b48d-eb3b631c9a51.jpg 624w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/800/cpsprodpb/5e6f/live/89bc9e70-97da-11f0-b48d-eb3b631c9a51.jpg 800w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/976/cpsprodpb/5e6f/live/89bc9e70-97da-11f0-b48d-eb3b631c9a51.jpg 976w\" /></picture></span><span><span>Image source, </span>Getty Images</span></p><figcaption><span>Image caption, </span><p>Staff in the Brighton ticket office can face hundreds of queries per game from fans whose touted tickets flag as unauthorised when they try to enter the stadium</p></figcaption></figure></div><div><p>Brighton say they are using new technologies to try and crack down on the reselling of tickets for vastly inflated prices by unauthorised websites.</p><p>To try and get a grip of the problem, this season they hired Joseph Sells into a new staff position as tickets investigation officer, and he was on duty for the Tottenham fixture.</p><p>\"We've found hundreds [of unauthorised resale tickets] today, and going at the black market rate, we've prevented around £100,000 of transactions that would have been going to touts,\" Sells said.</p><p>\"We're investing heavily in stopping the problem at the core, using the latest tech we can, and we're on top of it.</p><p>\"A family came with six tickets to watch the Manchester City match a fortnight ago, which they had paid a total of £6,000 for.</p><p>\"That's very upsetting of course. It's a sad story, but that's why we're reiterating - if you want to come and see a game, buy directly from the club.\"</p><p>Brighton later told the BBC that 285 touted tickets were blocked at the match, and that 12 individual season ticket accounts were also identified as being used by touts and have had their tickets for future matches cancelled.</p><p>One of the tout accounts used the name Tony Montana - the lead character in '80s gangster film Scarface - to try and bulk purchase tickets.</p></div><div><figure><figcaption><span>Media caption, </span><p>Are black market tickets out of control?</p></figcaption></figure></div><div><p>The Premier League is already introducing new rules for digital ticketing which include the introduction of encrypted barcodes, which they say will make touting more difficult.</p><p>Sells explains that, while he shares resources with other clubs, the software is bespoke to Brighton and searches for suspicious transactions and scours resale sites for any tickets listed with seat numbers.</p><p>\"We're essentially training a model to spot tout behaviour before it can come into the club,\" he says. \"It applies a risk score to each transaction.</p><p>\"Let's say someone in Estonia is shopping with a prepaid card issued in the United Arab Emirates - that is going to flag the system.</p><p>\"The model learns every day how to spot more anomalies.\"</p><p>At Brighton, fans presenting an unauthorised ticket to staff are given a letter which explains what has happened and concludes with the sentence: \"To obtain a refund you should contract your card issuers who will assist you as a victim of fraud in reclaiming monies you have paid to the seller.\"</p><p>The club also offers any remaining seats in the stadium - either from season ticket holders unable to attend or in hospitality sections - for sale to fans whose tickets are blocked on entry.</p><p>For some of those like James who believe that resale websites are helping them fulfil their dream of attending a game, matchday can turn into a nightmare.</p></div><div><figure><p><span><picture><source srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/240/cpsprodpb/e9f5/live/a3a49670-97db-11f0-b48d-eb3b631c9a51.jpg.webp 240w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/320/cpsprodpb/e9f5/live/a3a49670-97db-11f0-b48d-eb3b631c9a51.jpg.webp 320w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/480/cpsprodpb/e9f5/live/a3a49670-97db-11f0-b48d-eb3b631c9a51.jpg.webp 480w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/624/cpsprodpb/e9f5/live/a3a49670-97db-11f0-b48d-eb3b631c9a51.jpg.webp 624w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/800/cpsprodpb/e9f5/live/a3a49670-97db-11f0-b48d-eb3b631c9a51.jpg.webp 800w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/976/cpsprodpb/e9f5/live/a3a49670-97db-11f0-b48d-eb3b631c9a51.jpg.webp 976w\" type=\"image/webp\"></source><img alt=\"Mohamed Kudus and Yasin Ayari battle for the ball during Brighton's 2-2 draw with Tottenham at the Amex Stadium in the Premier League\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/1008/cpsprodpb/e9f5/live/a3a49670-97db-11f0-b48d-eb3b631c9a51.jpg\" srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/240/cpsprodpb/e9f5/live/a3a49670-97db-11f0-b48d-eb3b631c9a51.jpg 240w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/320/cpsprodpb/e9f5/live/a3a49670-97db-11f0-b48d-eb3b631c9a51.jpg 320w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/480/cpsprodpb/e9f5/live/a3a49670-97db-11f0-b48d-eb3b631c9a51.jpg 480w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/624/cpsprodpb/e9f5/live/a3a49670-97db-11f0-b48d-eb3b631c9a51.jpg 624w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/800/cpsprodpb/e9f5/live/a3a49670-97db-11f0-b48d-eb3b631c9a51.jpg 800w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/976/cpsprodpb/e9f5/live/a3a49670-97db-11f0-b48d-eb3b631c9a51.jpg 976w\" /></picture></span><span><span>Image source, </span>Getty Images</span></p><figcaption><span>Image caption, </span><p>Brighton's match against Spurs ended in a 2-2 draw</p></figcaption></figure></div></article></div>"

indicating either higher taxes or lower government spending - as well as increased trade costs and uncertainty.</p><p>Responding to the OECD's forecast, Reeves said the figures \"confirm that the British economy is stronger than forecast - it has been the fastest growing of any G7 economy in the first half of the year\".</p><p>\"But I know there is more to do to build an economy that works for working people – and rewards working people.\"</p><p>Shadow chancellor Sir Mel Stride said the OECD confirmed \"what hard-working families already feel -

Some changes are being phased in over time, it said, while some companies are accepting smaller profit margins for now.</p><p>However, it said the impact was \"becoming increasingly visible in spending choices, labour markets and consumer prices\".</p><p>\"Growth is expected to soften noticeably in the second half of this year, as front-loading activity unwinds and higher effective tariff rates on imports to the United States and China dampen investment and trade growth,\" it said.</p></div></article>"

    "body": "<div><div><p>1 hour ago</p></div><p><span><p><span>Sean Coughlan</span><span>Royal correspondent</span></p></span></p></div><div><p>The Duchess of York has so far been the great survivor of the royal world, bouncing back from embarrassments that would have sunk many others.</p><p>But she is now mired in a deep scandal about her connection with sex offender Jeffrey Epstein that seems much harder to resolve.</p><p>Charity patronages are falling off her like autumn leaves, with seven charities no longer wanting to be associated with her as their patron or ambassador.</p><p>She's an author of Mills and Boon books now, in one of her many entrepreneurial ventures, but she will struggle to write herself a happy ending. And the efforts she's made to return to the royal fold could now go into reverse.</p></div><div><p>This latest PR disaster for Sarah Ferguson follows the publication of an email she sent to Epstein in 2011, in which she called him her \"supreme friend\" and said she wanted to \"humbly apologise\" for publicly rejecting him and knew Epstein would \"feel hellaciously let down by me\".</p><p>Her apology was because a few weeks before she had denounced him in an interview, saying it had been a \"gigantic error of judgement\" to have had dealings with him and vowed to \"have nothing ever to do with Jeffrey Epstein ever again\".</p><p>It's not a good look, even with her spokesperson's explanation that she was trying to \"assuage\" Epstein after he threatened to sue her for defamation. Heading off the lawyers wouldn't usually mean such an emotional appeal to \"you and your heart\".</p><p>It was serious enough for a charity that had been associated with her for 35 years, the Teenage Cancer Trust, to sever its connections.</p><p>During that time, she had separated from her husband Prince Andrew, been photographed having her toes sucked by a US financial adviser and caught in a tabloid sting offering access to her ex-husband for an alleged £500,000.</p><p>More recently a damning book by Andrew Lownie, Entitled, had painted her in a brutally unflattering light as someone caught up in a loop of debt, excessive spending and then risky attempts to raise money.</p></div><div><p>But Sarah Ferguson - invariably known as Fergie - has survived all that. Her fallibility has been part of her likeability. She is good with people, with an outgoing friendliness and sense of fun, which is why charities have previously wanted her as an ally.</p><p>Like that famously terrible It's a Royal Knockout game show from 1987, she seemed to have a knack of being unceremoniously knocked off life's ladders but still being able to climb back up again.</p><p>She didn't get an invitation to the coronation of her ex-brother-in-law, but didn't moan about it. Then she appeared to be back in the fold, when in 2023 she was invited for a royal Christmas at Sandringham, her first time there in decades.</p><p>The following Christmas there was more royal approval for her, with grateful murmurings from the Palace that she had helped persuade Prince Andrew to stay away from family events, in the wake of his involvement in a Chinese spy scandal.</p><p>She had also gained public respect for her energetic efforts encouraging women to get checks, after her own breast cancer diagnosis and operation.</p><p>But now this latest revelation is causing profound problems. There couldn't be a more toxic connection than with Epstein and it is going to be particularly difficult when so much of her charity work was associated with children.</p><p>As a children's author, there must be a risk her brand will be badly damaged by the Epstein link.</p><p>The whole Epstein story is like a spreading oil spill, and both the Duke and Duchess of York must be wondering what might appear next.</p><p>There have already been claims that the King and the Royal Family will exclude the duchess from even more public gatherings. </p><p>But Prince Andrew and Sarah Ferguson are already not allowed to attend official royal events - and there doesn't seem to be any suggestion they would be barred from family moments, such as funerals or church services.</p><p>Both were there as mourners at Westminster Cathedral for last week's funeral of the Duchess of Kent, although there seemed to be some icy moments between Prince Andrew and his royal relatives on the steps of the church.</p><p>What seems to be one certainty is that Prince Andrew and Sarah will stay together, living in some style in Royal Lodge, Prince Andrew's Windsor home, no longer married, but holding hands as they sink in the reputational quicksand.</p></div>"
