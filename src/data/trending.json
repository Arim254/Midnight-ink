We brought things that covered it,\" Donald said.</p><p>\"We put different shampoos that had a better smell. We changed the bedding because the beds weren't very good.</p><p>\"We created much nicer beds so guys could sleep. They could have more energy.</p><p>\"Those are just little things. It's taking the time to do everything you can to give these guys the best opportunity.\"</p></div><p></p><h2 id=\"Analysis\"><span>Analysis</span></h2><p></p><div><p>Golf is no different to any other top-level sport in terms of the deep analysis which it relies on.</p><p>Donald wanted to take the number-crunching to another level. He headed into Moneyball territory.</p><p>That's why he appointed Edoardo Molinari, a team-mate in Europe's 2010 win at Celtic Manor, as one of his vice-captains.</p><p>The 44-year-old Italian is known throughout the game for his approach to analytics and has been heavily leaned on by Donald.</p><p>\"I'm going to give a lot of props to Edoardo,\" Donald said in his team's winning news conference on Sunday.</p><p>\"Edoardo and I sit down and we chat for many, many hours about all the kind of different stats and the pairings and the personalities and the course fits.\"</p><p>Molinari graduated from a five-year engineering degree before turning professional and founded a statistic-based company in 2020.</p><p>The firm describes its database as \"golf's most advanced analytics for tour players\", a claim supported by many of the European Ryder Cup players using it.</p><p>The depth of Molinari's work is illustrated by his team's analysis of driving statistics.</p></div><div><figure><figcaption><span>Media caption, </span><p>We've shut up a lot of people - McIlroy</p></figcaption></figure></div><div><p>The PGA Tour takes two drives from every player's round from holes faced in opposite directions to counteract the effect of wind. Molinari's team analyse every shot taken with a driver.</p><p>\"If you look at the PGA Tour stats, they say the US team is longer off the tee. But Edoardo's stats present a more accurate representation of both teams - they say the European team is longer,\" said Wilson.</p><p>\"So you look at the Bethpage course and the US have cut the rough down – that completely plays into the European hands. </p><p>\"The US team are better on approach play but they are losing the advantage because Europe were hitting it further and can still play from the rough. </p><p>\"Using Scottie Scheffler as an example, he was hamstrung to a degree because his strength is getting the ball in play off the tee. </p><p>\"He's getting the ball in play but he's not getting the advantage because the European team can play from the rough.\"</p></div><p></p><h2 id=\"Attention-to-detail\"><span>Attention to detail</span></h2><p></p><div><p>Has any great leader ever referenced hotel shampoo when asked for details about their leadership strategy? They have now.</p><p>Donald is famous for his attention to detail and provided fascinating insight into how he leaves no stone unturned.</p><p>When the team arrived at their hotel in Garden City, a salubrious Long Island village 12 miles to the west of Bethpage, things were not quite up to scratch.</p><p>A crack in the doors to each room let in too much light. The bedding was not as comfortable as hoped. And the shampoo did not smell fragrant enough.</p><p>Tyrrell Hatton and Shane Lowry, two of the more follicly-challenged players, rubbed their heads in agreement.</p><p>\"My job is literally to give these guys a better chance to win. It can be as simple as some very small things,\" said Donald, who arranged for European sporting greats including Roger Federer and former NBA basketball player Pau Gasol to provide motivational messages to the team.</p><p>\"It's just taking the time and having the care that you want to do everything you can to kind of give these guys the best opportunity.</p><p>\"You want to create an environment where they can succeed. These are 12 amazing players, we know that. </p><p>\"You're just trying to put them in a position where they feel comfortable.\"</p></div><p></p><h2 id=\"Another-stint\"><span>Another stint?</span></h2><p></p><div><p>When Donald and his players stood on the victory podium with the Ryder Cup, a familiar chant returned.</p><p>Thousands of European fans gathered behind the stage pleaded for Donald to serve another term at Adare Manor in 2027 and were joined by the jubilant players.</p><p>A coy Donald shook his head.</p><p>\"I'm not sure my heart can take it,\" he smiled.</p><p>Given the amount of time and effort he has put into the job, you have to wonder if he does have enough energy to devote to another tilt.</p><p>Unsurprisingly, his future cropped up in the post-match news conference.</p><p>With his surrounding players restarting the chant, Donald was asked what his response would be if the question was posed from the European tour.</p><p>\"My answer is I'm going to enjoy tonight,\" he said.</p><p>Maybe Kinnings should collar Donald when he has sunk a few celebratory beers. Two more years?</p></div></article>"

Built for a housing association, it was known to taxi drivers as the sardine can, and both architects and their families took flats there.</p><p>But while Grimshaw remained true to the hi-tech minimalist creed, Farrell increasingly felt pulled in a different direction. In 1980 they parted and Farrell established his own practice.</p><p>His breakthrough came in 1982 with <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.royalacademy.org.uk/article/architecture-why-tvam-was-most-maverick\">the headquarters for TV-am</a> in a repurposed canalside warehouse in north London's Camden.</p><p>It was colourful and over-the-top, full of witty references to the architecture of the past, like a pastiche of a Japanese temple, a Mesopotamian ziggurat (temple tower) and a massive cartoon cutout keystone, suspended in a skeletal arch of brightly coloured tubular steel over the entrance.</p><p>But what caught the popular imagination were the giant breakfast eggcups on the roof overlooking the canal.</p><p>Sir Terry later described the project as a \"tremendous release\", and the Royal Academy called it a \"pop building, through its sheer abundance of metaphor\".</p></div><p></p><h2>Striking</h2><p></p><div><p>But arguably his most famous building was the MI6 headquarters next to Vauxhall Bridge in London, which has featured in several James Bond films.</p><p>Completed in 1994, Farrell later claimed that when the building was being designed he was told only that it was for a government client.</p><p>He guessed (wrongly) that it might be for the Department of the Environment, which is why this towering edifice of mirrored green glass and Italian marble, part-1930s Art Deco factory, part-Aztec temple, has conical fir trees half way up the facade.</p><p>He gained a reputation for making big buildings fun, adding Lego-like decorative touches to developments like the Edinburgh International Conference Centre and Embankment Place above Charing Cross Station in London.</p><p>\"The modernism that was around before the 1980s was very grey, restrictive, utilitarian and quite doctrinaire really,\" Farrell said. </p><p>\"For me personally the split from Grimshaw was an opportunity to completely start again. I saw it as a great release to establish a new identity any way I saw fit.\"</p></div><figure><div><p><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20250919-090805-05e5ba0164-web-2.30.1-2/grey-placeholder.png\" /><img srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/defd/live/4e037a20-3912-11ef-bdc5-41d7421c2adf.jpg.webp 240w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/defd/live/4e037a20-3912-11ef-bdc5-41d7421c2adf.jpg.webp 320w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/defd/live/4e037a20-3912-11ef-bdc5-41d7421c2adf.jpg.webp 480w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/defd/live/4e037a20-3912-11ef-bdc5-41d7421c2adf.jpg.webp 640w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/defd/live/4e037a20-3912-11ef-bdc5-41d7421c2adf.jpg.webp 800w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/defd/live/4e037a20-3912-11ef-bdc5-41d7421c2adf.jpg.webp 1024w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/defd/live/4e037a20-3912-11ef-bdc5-41d7421c2adf.jpg.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/defd/live/4e037a20-3912-11ef-bdc5-41d7421c2adf.jpg.webp\" alt=\"Hull's aquarium, The Deep\" /></p></div><p></p><figcaption>Hull's striking aquarium was designed to resemble the prow of a ship</figcaption><p></p></figure><div><p>He was also keen on innovation and environmental awareness, including <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-65346052\">the £4.6m Farrell Centre, which opened in Newcastle in 2023</a>. </p><p>It held an exhibition showing how we might soon be able to grow buildings from fungus, and other innovative ways to reduce cities' environmental impact.</p><p>Partly funded by Sir Terry, the exhibition showed four architecture studios offering visions for making buildings more sustainable.</p><p>They included a structure grown from mycelium, the root network of fungus.</p><p>Outside London, Sir Terry also built Hull's striking aquarium, The Deep, jutting out over the Humber like a strangely angular boat; and the eclectic collection of buildings known as The Centre for Life in Newcastle.</p><p>He also developed a substantial practice overseas, especially in China, where he designed buildings that managed to be both gargantuan and frisky.</p><p>One of the earliest was the Peak Tower in Hong Kong in 1997, an upturned crescent perched atop four concrete legs (since glassed in to provide additional space).

It's for those who came before me and ran countless yards so I could come in and score a touchdown. This is for my people, my culture, and our history.\"</p><p>It comes after the star recently said <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://i-d.co/article/bad-bunny-puerto-rico-residency-issue-375-cover/\">in an interview with i-D magazine</a> he is avoiding the US on his current world tour out of concerns that Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents might conduct raids on fans at his concerts.</p></div><div><p>He will now make a trip to the US for Super Bowl night in Santa Clara on 8 February.</p><p>He will follow in the footsteps of other recent half-time performers including <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cz0l5m5m943o\">Kendrick Lamar</a>, Usher, Rihanna and The Weeknd.</p><p>Lamar was the musical attraction at this year's Super Bowl, which was watched by a record 127 million viewers in the US.</p><p>Switching into his native Spanish, Bad Bunny - whose real name is Benito Antonio Martinez Ocasio - added in his statement: \"Ve y dile a tu abuela, que seremos el halftime show del Super Bowl\" - which roughly translates as: \"Go tell your grandma we're going to be the Super Bowl half-time show.\"</p><p>Jay-Z, whose Roc Nation company chooses the half-time performer and produces their show, said what Bad Bunny has \"done and continues to do for Puerto Rico is truly inspiring\".</p><p>\"We are honoured to have him on the world's biggest stage,\" he added.</p></div><div><p>In 2022, Bad Bunny Un Verano Sin Ti (A Summer Without You), became the first all-Spanish language album to reach number one in the US.</p><p>The 31-year-old was the third most-streamed artist in the world last year, behind Taylor Swift and The Weeknd.</p><p>He released his latest album, Debí Tirar Más Fotos (I Should Have Taken More Photos), earlier this year.</p><p>He has won three Grammy Awards, and earlier this month was revealed as the leading nominee at this year's Latin Grammy Awards.</p><p>Earlier this month, he concluded a residency in his native Puerto Rico, which drew more than 500,000 fans. Puerto Rico is a US territory but which exercises substantial internal self-govenance.</p><p>His tour is due to start in the Dominican Republic in November, before travelling across Central and South America, then to Australia, Japan and Europe, including two nights at Tottenham Hotspur Stadium in London next summer.</p><p>\"There were many reasons why I didn't show up in the US, and none of them were out of hate - I've performed there many times,\" the star explained to i-D about the absence of US dates.</p><p>\"All of [the shows] have been successful. All of them have been magnificent. I've enjoyed connecting with Latinos who have been living in the US.\"</p><p>He continued: \"But there was the issue of... ICE could be outside [my concerts]. And it's something that we were talking about and very concerned about.\"</p><p>His Super Bowl performance will take place at the Levi's Stadium in Santa Clara, in the San Francisco Bay Area.</p><p>Bad Bunny is also an actor, appearing in films like Bullet Train and the recent Happy Gilmore 2.</p><p>And he will return to host Saturday Night Live for a second time next month.</p></div>"

This could lead to a \"work to rule\" situation, similar to what was introduced in a previous dispute during which GPs limited patient appointments to the minimum required under their contract.</p></div><p></p><h2>'NHS should not be held back'</h2><p></p><div><p>But ministers argue that the BMA had agreed to the introduction of online booking as part of a new negotiated contract in England. They point out that many GPs already offer the service.</p><p>Wes Streeting, Secretary of State for Health and Social Care, said it was \"absurd\" that in 2025 many patients can't request appointments online. </p><p>\"If you can book a hair appointment online, you should be able to book an NHS appointment too. We have agreed clear safeguards, where patients will be directed to phone up or attend in person for urgent appointments. The BMA knows this. This government will always put the interests of patients first, and we will not stand for our NHS being held back in the analogue age.\"</p><p>Dr Katie Bramall-Stainer, chair of the BMA GP committee, said the changes were agreed to \"on the condition that 'necessary safeguards' would be put in place\" before Wednesday 1 October. </p><p>\"This was agreed – in writing – with government… and NHSE in February this year. Now almost eight months later, it is deeply disappointing to see promises broken,\" she added.</p><p>She said ministers had been warned that the changes would lead to \"hospital-style waiting lists in general practice\" which could \"reduce face-to-face GP appointments\".</p><p>Mr Streeting said that that 2,000 extra GPs had already been hired across England and that patient satisfaction with their GPs was on the up. </p><p>Officials said that surgeries which had implemented the changes had reported reduced waiting times for appointments.</p></div></article>"

The idea is as ludicrous as me checking with the boss I had when I was twenty-one for what opinions I should hold these days.\"</p><p>She said it had been, however, \"hard to shake a certain protectiveness\" after knowing someone since they were 10.</p><p>\"Until quite recently, I hadn't managed to throw off the memory of children who needed to be gently coaxed through their dialogue in a big scary film studio.\"</p><p>The author said the \"turning point\" in her feelings came in 2022 when Watson appeared to aim a subtle dig at Rowling on stage at the Bafta Awards.</p><p>Host Rebel Wilson introduced Watson by saying: \"She's proud to call herself a feminist, but we all know she's a witch.\" <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TD-vioiM2BU\">Watson responded</a> that she was \"here for ALL of the witches\".</p><p>Rowling said that moment had \"a postscript that hurt far more than the speech itself\", when Watson sent a note, despite having her phone number. The note had a single line saying, \"I'm so sorry for what you're going through\", Rowling said.</p><p>\"This was back when the death, rape and torture threats against me were at their peak, at a time when my personal security measures had had to be tightened considerably and I was constantly worried for my family's safety,\" the author said.</p><p>\"Emma had just publicly poured more petrol on the flames, yet thought a one line expression of concern from her would reassure me of her fundamental sympathy and kindness.\"</p></div><div><p>Rowling went on to suggest that Watson was \"never likely to need\" to use the types of single-sex spaces she has campaigned against trans people having access to, such as changing rooms and public toilets.</p><p>\"I wasn't a multimillionaire at fourteen. I lived in poverty while writing the book that made Emma famous,\" she added.</p><p>\"I therefore understand from my own life experience what the trashing of women's rights in which Emma has so enthusiastically participated means to women and girls without her privileges.\"</p><p>The writer added that Watson's recent declaratons of love marked a \"change of tack I suspect she's adopted because she's noticed full-throated condemnation of me is no longer quite as fashionable as it was\".</p><p>Rowling concluded: \"Adults can't expect to cosy up to an activist movement that regularly calls for a friend's assassination, then assert their right to the former friend's love, as though the friend was in fact their mother.</p><p>\"Emma is rightly free to disagree with me and indeed to discuss her feelings about me in public - but I have the same right, and I've finally decided to exercise it.\"</p><p>BBC News has approached Watson's representatives for comment.</p></div><p></p><h2>'I can love her, I can know she loved me'</h2><p></p><div><p>Watson was one of several stars of the Potter films who spoke out against Rowling's views in 2020, posting on social media at the time: \"Trans people are who they say they are and deserve to live their lives without being constantly questioned or told they aren't who they say they are.\"</p><p>In last week's interview, Watson said her previous relationship with Rowling meant she was still able to \"treasure Jo\".</p><p>The actress also praised Rowling for the \"kindness and words of encouragement\" she gave when she was growing up, and for the opportunity to play a character like Hermione.</p><p>\"There's just no world in which I could ever cancel her out, or cancel that out, for anything,\" Watson said. \"It has to remain true. It is true.</p><p>\"I just don't know what else to do other than hold these two seemingly incompatible things together at the same time and just hope maybe they will one day resolve or co-join themselves, and maybe accept that they never will, but that they can both still be true.\"</p></div></article>"
