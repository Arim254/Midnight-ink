Others were allowed to return, but the gas to the building has been shut off as authorities investigate.</p><p>That investigation will determine whether a gas leak caused the explosion, Mayor Eric Adams said. Utility provider ConEd has not returned a request for comment from BBC.</p><p>The New York City Housing Authority, which manages the complex, said in a statement that it is investigating the incident and still determining the extent of the damage. The building has a few open violations against it. </p></div><div><p>NYC Department of Buildings issued a partial stop work order, which is still active, on the building in June, according to public records. The order was related to a violation on plumbing that may have been defective, not working, or poorly maintained.</p><p>Two other violations on the property are still active, public records show. One from February 2024 concerns the building's failure to file a report on facade safety and inspection. </p><p>The other active violation deals with a NYCHA inspection report that found the building's facade to be unsafe.</p><p>The DOB's commissioner, James Oddo, said there are three open violations against the property that deal with non-safety issues on boilers. It's not clear how the violations he's referencing are related, if at all, to the active violations described in public records.</p><p>The partial collapse comes just a week after a fire in the same building left a teenage girl comatose and in critical condition, though her father told local outlet News 12 Long Island that she is now recovering.</p><p>\"We were lucky that this emergency didn't result in a loss of life, that it didn't turn into a tragedy,\" Amanda Septimo, an assembly member who represents the building's district, said at the news conference. </p><p>\"But we can't be relying on luck to keep our community safe.\"</p></div>"

    "body": "<div><div><p>3 hours ago</p></div><p><span><p><span>Joe Tidy</span><span>Cyber Correspondent, BBC World Service</span></p></span></p></div><div><p>Hackers who attempted to extort a nursery chain by posting stolen images and data about children on the darknet have removed the posts and claim to have deleted the information.</p><p>The criminals <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c62ldyvpwv9o\">began posting profiles</a> of the children to their website last Thursday, adding another 10 children days later and <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c07vxv8v89lo\">vowing to continue </a>until Kido Schools paid a ransom in Bitcoin.</p><p>The criminals also contacted parents directly with threatening phone calls whilst trying to get their ransom paid.</p><p>But public revulsion at their attack appears to have forced the criminals to backtrack.</p></div><div><p>First they blurred the images but kept the data up - now they have taken all the information offline, and apologised for their actions.</p><p>Their apparent change of heart has been met with scepticism by experts, who had previously condemned the targeting of nurseries as a \"new low\" for cyber-criminals.</p><p>\"This is more about pragmatism than morality,\" said cyber-security expert Jen Ellis.</p><p>\"These criminals are clearly shocked and worried by the attention their hack has caused and they are trying to protect themselves or their brand.\"</p></div><div><p>The hackers claim to have deleted everything they took - which included the private details and pictures of around 8,000 children as well as contact information for parents and carers.</p><p>\"All child data is now being deleted. No more remains and this can comfort parents,\" one of the cyber-criminals involved told the BBC.</p><p>It's understood Kido have not paid the hackers a ransom which was thought to be around £100,000.</p><p>Past cases have shown that hackers often say they have deleted stolen data and been found to have kept it or sold it on.</p><p>When the UK's National Crime Agency <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-68344987\">took down the cyber crime gang LockBit</a> they discovered troves of data still on the criminal's servers that victims had paid to be deleted.</p><p>The nursery hackers, calling themselves Radiant, appear to be concerned that their hack has crossed an undefined moral line since the public outcry began against them.</p><p>\"We are sorry for hurting kids,\" the cyber-criminals told BBC News.</p><p>It's not known who the hackers or hacker are but they appear to be a new and possibly inexperienced group. </p><p>Their darknet site is newly created but they claim to have carried out other hacks in the past.</p><p>This isn't the first time that cyber-criminals have backtracked on an attack.</p><p>In 2020 a gang using Dopplepaymer ransomware gifted their encryption key to a German hospital after the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-54204356\">chaos contributed to the death</a> of an emergency care patient.</p><p>When <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-57184977\">Conti hackers attacked the Irish Health Service</a> in 2021 they too gave their antidote away for free claiming not to have deliberately targeted hospitals.</p><p>Months before, criminals from the Darkside group took the strange decision to post proof that they had <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-54591761\">donated some of their ill-gotten bitcoin</a> to charities.</p><p>The nursery hackers claimed they broke into the nursery's systems by buying access to one of Kido's staff computers which was compromised by a separate hacker.</p><p>In a common process, the \"initial access broker\" sold the Kido access to Radiant, which went on to further infiltrate Kido's systems and steal the data.</p><p>The majority of the downloaded material including the pictures of children was taken from Kido's account with Famly - a popular early years education platform . </p><p>Famly has rejected Kido's message to parents that the breach happened as a result of Famly being compromised.</p><p>It has stressed to the BBC that neither the security or infrastructure of the platform has been compromised at any point.</p><p>Kido did not respond to a request for comment about the way the hackers stole the data. </p><p>A spokesperson said only that: \"We recently identified and responded to a cyber incident. We are working with external specialists to investigate and determine what happened in more detail. </p><p>\"We swiftly informed both our families and the relevant authorities and continue to liaise closely with them.\"</p><p>Radiant says it paid the initial access broker money for access to Kido's system. </p><p>So with Kido refusing to pay and the hackers giving up their extortion attempt the criminals appear to have actually lost money in this cyber-attack.</p></div>"
