    "body": "<div><div><p>1 hour ago</p></div><p><span><p><span>George Wright</span><span></span><span> and</span></p><p><span>Hugh Schofield</span><span>Paris</span></p></span></p></div><div><p>Former French president Nicolas Sarkozy has been sentenced to five years in jail after being found guilty of criminal conspiracy in a case related to millions of euros of illicit funds from the late Libyan leader Col Muammar Gaddafi.</p><p>The Paris criminal court acquitted him of all other charges, including passive corruption and illegal campaign financing. </p><p>The ruling means he will spend time in jail even if he launches an appeal, which Sarkozy says he intends to do.</p><p>Speaking after Thursday's hearing, the 70-year-old, who was president from 2007-12, said the verdict was \"extremely serious for rule of law\".</p></div><div><p>Sarkozy, who claims the case is politically motivated, was accused of using the funds from Gaddafi to finance his 2007 election campaign.</p><p>In exchange, the prosecution alleged Sarkozy promised to help Gaddafi combat his reputation as a pariah with Western countries.</p><p>Judge Nathalie Gavarino said Sarkozy had allowed close aides to contact Libyan officials with a view to obtaining financial support for his campaign.</p><p>But the court ruled that there was not enough evidence to find Sarkozy was the beneficiary of the illegal campaign financing.</p><p>He was also ordered to pay a fine of €100,000 ($117,000, £87,000).</p><p>There was a shocked intake of breath in court when the judge read out her sentence. </p><p>Sarkozy could be sent to prison in Paris in the coming days – a first for a former French president and a humiliating blow for a man who has always protested his innocence in this trial and the other legal cases against him.</p><p>\"What happened today... is of extreme gravity in regard to the rule of law, and for the trust one can have in the justice system,\" Sarkozy said outside the court building.</p><p>\"If they absolutely want me to sleep in jail, I will sleep in jail, but with my head held high,\" he said.</p><p>The investigation was opened in 2013, two years after Saif al-Islam, son of the then-Libyan leader, first accused Sarkozy of taking millions of his father's money for campaign funding.</p><p>The following year, Lebanese businessman Ziad Takieddine - who for a long time acted as a middleman between France and the Middle East - said he had written proof that Sarkozy's campaign bid was \"abundantly\" financed by Tripoli, and that the €50m (£43m) worth of payments continued after he became president.</p><p>Among the others accused in the trial were former interior ministers, Claude Gueant and Brice Hortefeux. The court found Gueant guilty of corruption, among other charges, and Hortefeux was found guilty of criminal conspiracy.</p><p>Sarkozy's wife, Italian-born former supermodel and singer Carla Bruni-Sarkozy, was <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cd1xv3xewdno\">charged last year with hiding evidence linked to the Gaddafi case</a> and associating with wrongdoers to commit fraud, both of which she denies.</p><p>Since losing his re-election bid in 2012, Sarkozy has been targeted by several criminal investigations.</p><p>He also appealed against a February 2024 ruling which found him <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-68293760\">guilty of overspending on his 2012 re-election campaign</a>, then hiring a PR firm to cover it up. He was handed a one-year sentence, of which six months were suspended.</p><p>In 2021, he was found guilty of trying to bribe a judge in 2014 and became the first former French president to get a custodial sentence. In December, the Paris appeals court ruled that he could serve his time at home wearing a tag instead of going to jail.</p></div>"

It did not provide a reason.</p><p>The closure has stranded many Palestinians in the West Bank, who are unable to go on planned trips abroad. Those who are abroad have been unable to travel home.</p><p>It comes days after <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cr5qv0qmgmjo\">two Israeli military personnel were shot dead</a> near the crossing by a Jordanian gunman, who was killed at the scene.</p></div><div><p>It was briefly shut following that incident but had since reopened. </p><p>Prominent Palestinian politician Mustafa Barghouti told the BBC the closure was a \"dangerous move\" that meant \"imprisoning\" people in the West Bank and \"depriving them from the only passage out\".</p><p>The crossing - also known as the King Hussein Bridge - lies about halfway between Amman and Jerusalem and is the only official crossing point between the West Bank and Jordan. It is also the only entry point to the West Bank that does not go through Israel.</p></div><div><p>Most Palestinians in the West Bank are not allowed to travel through Israeli airports or other Israeli border crossings, meaning the bridge is an essential connection to the outside world.</p><p>\"You're talking here about disrupting the relationship between hundreds of thousands of families who are usually connected through Jordan,\" Barghouti said.</p><p>\"Thousands of people who are stuck in Jordan, they don't have resources to go and pay for hotels. They cannot stay outside. There are mothers who live with their children in the West Bank who need to come back,\" he added.</p><p>Jordan is home to more than 2m registered Palestinian refugees, while more than half of its population of more than 11m are of Palestinian descent. It has maintained security, trade and diplomatic ties with Israel since a 1994 peace treaty - but is a vocal critic of Israel's actions towards Palestinians.</p><p>Maxim Giacaman, 23, a medical student from Bethlehem, told the BBC he was unable to travel abroad for a key elective in his medical studies.</p><p>\"I have a rotation for one month in Germany for cardiac surgery,\" he said. \"And it was a big opportunity for me and for my future, my medical future.\"</p><p>\"My plane is on Saturday and I was planning to go to Amman, Jordan today,\" he says. \"So it's miserable.\"</p></div><div><p>The Allenby bridge is a key trade route for goods and medical supplies to enter the West Bank. Israeli authorities say about 9% of humanitarian aid sent by truck to Gaza passes through it. </p><p>Palestinians fear its indefinite closure forms part of an Israeli response to moves announced this week by <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c1wggrdn9dno\">the UK, France, Australia, Canada</a> and other countries to recognise the State of Palestine.</p><p>The Israeli government has labelled the moves a \"reward for terrorism\". Ultranationalist ministers have called for Israel to annex the West Bank outright as a response. </p><p>Since <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/clyv7w3gdy2o\">the Hamas-led attack on southern Israel that killed about 1,200 people</a> and saw 251 taken hostage, triggering the war in Gaza, Israel has significantly tightened its control over the West Bank. </p><p>It has introduced hundreds of new checkpoints across the territory, launched a large-scale Jewish <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cvg30l6myj3o\">settlement push</a>, and carried out <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c5ype8w6ynwo\">major military operations</a> against Palestinian resistance groups. Attacks by <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cj4wwxz12jko\">Israeli settlers</a> against Palestinians have also ramped up significantly. </p><p>\"It shows you that the world community has failed drastically in deterring Israel from expanding its oppressive policies,\" said Barghouti. \"Israel will not be restrained unless there are serious punitive acts.\"</p><p>The Allenby bridge was named after British general Edmund Allenby, who defeated the Ottoman empire to gain control of Palestine in 1917. It was built in the following year.</p><p>Israel has controlled its side of the bridge since the 1967 Six Day War, during which Israel defeated several Arab states, and in the past has temporarily closed it during religious holidays or for security reasons.</p></div><div><p><span>More on this story</span></p></div></article>"

    "body": "<div><p>An Australian film that was digitally altered to change a same-sex couple to a heterosexual one has drawn backlash from moviegoers in China.</p><p>Together, a horror film starring Dave Franco and Alison Brie, was shown in selected Chinese cinemas in advance screenings on 12 September. Cinemagoers later realised some scenes had been modified after screenshots showing the original scenes went viral online.</p><p>The film was due to be publicly released on 19 September - but as of Thursday has yet to be aired in cinemas. </p><p>The film's global distributor, Neon, later condemned the edit, saying they did not \"approve of [this] unauthorised edit... and demand they ceased distribution\", according to reports. </p></div><div><p>The supernatural body horror film, written and directed by Australian Michael Shanks, follows a couple who move to the countryside and find themselves encountering a mysterious force that impacts their bodies, lives and relationship.</p><p>The film, which first premiered at the Sundance Film Festival in January and released in US and Australia in July, has received largely positive reviews from critics, earning a 90% freshness score on film review site Rotten Tomatoes.</p><p>But as soon as the advance screenings began in China this month, viewers noticed that some sex and nudity scenes had been modified after screenshots showing scenes from the original version circulated online. </p><p>In one scene which pictured the male lead in the shower, they noticed that the Chinese version had added steam to obscure the lead's nude body.</p><p>Most complaints, however, were about an image featuring a gay couple which had been digitally altered, with a man's face replaced by a woman's. Several references to the same-sex relationship in the film were also removed.</p><p>It's not uncommon for China - where same-sex marriage isn't recognised and LGBT topics remain largely taboo - to censor LGBT content. But this time, the use of what appeared to be AI-generated alterations struck a nerve.</p><p>\"This is no longer just a matter of cuts - it's a matter of distortion and misrepresentation,\" reads one post on popular Chinese film critic platform Douban, where the movie has a rating of 6.9 out of 10.</p><p>\"Not only did they alter the plot, but they also disrespected the actor's sexual orientation.

    "body": "<div><div><p>4 hours ago</p></div><p><span><p><span>Henry Zeffman</span><span>Chief political correspondent</span></p></span></p></div><div><p>Location: party conference.</p><p>A fairly new prime minister is struggling for popularity with his party and the country at large, against a backdrop of grim economic choices.</p><p>A popular, plain-speaking mayor enters the week talked up as a future leader  — and is doing little to dampen that speculation himself.</p><p>The year is 2012, the prime minister is David Cameron and the mayor is Boris Johnson.</p><p>But it could just as well be 2025, Sir Keir Starmer and Andy Burnham.</p><p>Sometimes politicians of all parties flirt with the possibility of one day becoming leader in suggestive, coy, almost deniable ways. </p><p>This is not an example of that. Burnham is being more overt.</p><p>To the Telegraph, the Manchester mayor gave a straight answer to a straight question: yes, he had been contacted by Labour MPs \"throughout the summer\" about the prospect of him returning to Westminster, where he was an MP for 16 years, to lead Labour and replace Starmer as prime minister.</p><p>Burnham said this was \"more a decision for those people than it is for me\". He repeated that line in an interview with BBC Manchester.</p><p>Well, up to a point. </p></div><div><p>Burnham is not an MP. He would have to decide to become one if he wants to be Labour leader and prime minister. </p><p>Labour's rule book dictates that the party leader must be an MP, so when the party is in government that means the prime minister must also be an MP, meaning they have to be elected to Parliament rather than made a member of the Lords.</p><p>This means that his path to Downing Street is extremely complicated. </p><p>First, a Labour MP would need to resign their seat so there is a by-election - unless a contest happened to arise through an MP dying or similar. </p><p>Because of Burnham's distinctive regional pitch, the constituency would surely have to be in Greater Manchester or at least the north-west of England. </p><p>Two Manchester Labour MPs, Andrew Gwynne and Graham Stringer, have already ruled out standing down for Burnham. </p><p>Then, Burnham would have to be selected as Labour's candidate. </p><p>This would require the approval of Labour's national executive committee, which for most purposes is controlled by allies of Starmer, although at least some of those would probably support Burnham's return to Westminster.</p><p>Then, he would have to win the by-election in a difficult national political environment for the Labour Party. </p><p>And then, finally, Burnham would have to secure the backing of 80 Labour MPs to challenge Starmer  - at which point presumably other candidates would enter the fray. </p><p>There are a lot of difficulties along that path.</p><p>Still, it is clearly a path that he is willing, at the very least, to publicly entertain.</p><p>The mere existence of the Telegraph interview, alongside a long profile in the New Statesman, the bible of left-liberals, is pretty provocative. </p><p>Burnham knew that he would be asked questions about his national ambitions, and that they would create a stir in the days before a crucial party conference for Starmer.</p><p>Perhaps most notable, though, is that Burnham used both interviews to spell out a policy prospectus: higher council tax on expensive homes, borrowing to invest in council housing, cutting income tax for lower earners and increasing it for higher earners.</p><p>In the New Statesman, he said: \"We've got to get beyond this thing of being in hock to the bond markets\". </p><p>That is a direct challenge not just to Starmer but to Chancellor Rachel Reeves and her view  - her supporters and plenty of experts would say the economic reality  - that the government cannot borrow much more money.</p><p>It is an argument that quite a few Labour MPs make, mostly in private: that this government has allowed itself to become too constrained by Treasury orthodoxy.</p><p>To have Burnham joining that argument publicly, whether his leadership challenge is plausible or not, is unwelcome for Starmer and Reeves.</p><p>In government, there is frustration and no small amount of bafflement that Burnham has decided to make these interventions now. </p><p>One senior source said he was: \"A Boris-sized ego, but without the strategic thought.\"</p><p>Speaking from <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-19883045\">the main stage of Conservative conference back in 2012</a> (an honour not being afforded to Burnham at Labour's conference next week), Boris Johnson ended up rallying the members behind David Cameron. </p><p>It took him seven years to get to No 10.</p><p>It's hard to see the Starmer and Burnham story taking quite so long to play out, whatever the ultimate conclusion.</p></div>"

    "body": "<div><p>The BBC and three international news agencies have released a short film calling on Israel to allow foreign journalists into Gaza.</p><p>The film, launched by the corporation with Agence France-Presse (AFP), the Associated Press (AP) and Reuters, is narrated by veteran BBC journalist David Dimbleby.</p><p>He said:<b> </b>\"International journalists must now be allowed into Gaza to share the burden with the Palestinian reporters there so we can all bring the facts to the world.\"</p><p>Foreign journalists have been banned from entering Gaza independently since Israel launched its 2023 offensive following the Hamas 7 October attacks. A small number have been taken into the Strip by Israeli troops under controlled access.</p></div><div><p>The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) has previously said that to \"allow journalists to report safely\" in Gaza the military \"accompanies them when in the battlefield\".</p><p>The BBC has contacted the Israeli foreign ministry and the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) for comment. </p><p>Last year Israel's High Court of Justice ruled that restrictions on entry to Gaza were justified on security grounds. </p><p>Deborah Turness, CEO of BBC News, said: \"It is almost two years since October 7th when the world witnessed Hamas' atrocities. Since then, a war has been raging in Gaza but international journalists are not allowed in. </p><p>\"We must now be let into Gaza. To work alongside local journalists, so we can all bring the facts to the world.\"</p><p>The film premieres in New York on Wednesday night at an event hosted by the Committee to Protect Journalists, to coincide with the United Nations General Assembly. It features footage of historic events and atrocities captured by journalists.</p><p>They include scenes of the D-Day landings during World War Two, the Vietnam War, Ethiopia's 1984 famine, China's Tiananmen Square protests, the Rwandan genocide, the Syrian refugee crisis and the war in Ukraine.</p><p>\"In Ukraine, journalists from around the world risk their lives every day to report the suffering of the people,\" says Dimbleby in the film. </p><p>\"But when it comes to Gaza the job of reporting falls solely to Palestinian journalists, who are paying a terrible cost, leaving fewer to bear witness.\"</p></div><div><p>This is not the first time news organisations have called on Israeli authorities to allow journalists into the territory. </p><p>In July, BBC News, AFP, AP and Reuters issued a statement expressing \"desperate concern\" for journalists in Gaza experiencing dire circumstances including hunger and displacement. </p><p>In August, 27 countries including the UK backed a statement calling for Israel to allow immediate foreign media access to Gaza and condemned attacks on journalists there.</p><p>According to the UN Human Rights Office, at least 248 Palestinian journalists have been killed in Israeli attacks in Gaza.</p><p>Israel has repeatedly denied that its forces target journalists. </p><p>The Israeli military launched a campaign in Gaza in response to the Hamas-led attack on southern Israel on 7 October 2023, in which about 1,200 people were killed and 251 others were taken hostage.</p><p>At least 65,419 people have been killed in Gaza since then, according to the territory's Hamas-run health ministry. The ministry's figures are quoted by the UN and others as the most reliable source of statistics available on casualties.</p></div>"
