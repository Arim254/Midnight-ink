    "body": "<div><div><p>5 hours ago</p></div><p><span><p><span>Imogen Foulkes</span><span>Geneva correspondent</span></p></span></p></div><div><p>Swiss voters have narrowly approved a plan to introduce voluntary electronic identity cards. </p><p>With all votes counted, 50.4% of those who voted said yes to the proposal, while 49.6% rejected it.</p><p>The closeness of the ballot is a surprise. Opinion polls had suggested up to 60% backed digital IDs, which also had the approval of the Swiss government, and both houses of parliament. </p><p>It was Switzerland's second vote on digital IDs. An earlier proposal was rejected in 2021, amid concerns the data would be held centrally, and controlled largely by private providers. </p></div><div><p>Sunday's revised proposal keeps the system in government hands.  Data will be stored only on the smartphones of individual users, and digital IDs will be optional. </p><p>Citizens can continue to use national identity card if they choose, which has been standard for decades in Switzerland.</p><p>To further ease privacy concerns, a particular authority seeking information on a person – such as proof of age or nationality, for example – will only be able to check for those specific details.</p><p>It comes after the UK government announced plans earlier this week to introduce its own digital ID - which would be mandatory for employment - as part of efforts to curb the number of illegal migrants living and working in the country.</p><p>The proposed British digital ID would have fewer intended uses than the Swiss version, but has still raised concerns about privacy and data security. </p><p>Supporters of the Swiss system say it will make life much easier for everyone, allowing a range of bureaucratic procedures - from getting a telephone contract to proving you are old enough to buy a bottle of wine - to happen quickly online.</p><p>Opponents of digital ID cards, who gathered enough signatures to force another referendum on the issue, argue that the measure could still undermine individual privacy.</p><p>They also fear that, despite the new restrictions on how data is collected and stored, it could still be used to track people and for marketing purposes.</p><p>Switzerland has a long tradition of protecting its citizens' privacy. The banking secrecy laws, now much diluted, were designed to shield an individual's personal finances from the prying eyes of the state.</p><p>For years, Google Street View was controversial in Switzerland - and even today, following a ruling by the Swiss Federal Court, images taken close to schools, women's refuges, hospitals or prisons must be automatically blurred before going online.</p></div>"

    "body": "<div><p>Greta Thunberg has pushed back on criticism that a Gaza-bound flotilla she is a part of is a publicity stunt, saying no one would imperil themselves purely for attention.</p><p>The Swedish activist is aboard one of 52 boats that form the Global Sumud Flotilla (GSF), which is travelling toward Gaza with the aim of delivering humanitarian aid to Palestinians there.</p><p>Israeli authorities have ridiculed the GSF flotilla and similar seaborne attempts to reach the territory, calling the boat Thunberg travelled on in June a \"selfie yacht\".</p><p>Asked about these criticisms of the flotilla by the BBC's Laura Kuenssberg, the activist said: \"I don't think anyone would risk their life for a publicity stunt.\"</p></div><div><p>Speaking while sailing off the Greek coast, she said the flotilla was not just a humanitarian mission but was also sending a message to people in Gaza that \"when our governments fail to step up, the people will step up\".</p><p>International aid agencies have been attempting to get food and medicine into the Palestinian territory - but note Israel is restricting the flow of supplies. Israel claims it is attempting to stop those supplies falling into the hands of Hamas, and has approved a US-backed aid agency.</p><p>Last month, a UN-backed body confirmed that there was famine in Gaza and the UN's humanitarian chief said it was the direct result of Israel's \"systematic obstruction\" of aid entering the territory. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has called this an \"outright lie\".</p><p>Thunberg said the purpose of the flotilla was to \"break Israel's illegal and inhumane siege on Gaza by sea\". The Israeli military has long controlled the waters that border Gaza.</p><p>Earlier this month, the flotilla organisers reported that <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cly67g7pdlko\">two vessels came under attack by suspected drones</a> outside the Tunisian port of Sidi Bou Said. Tunisian authorities disputed their claims. </p><p>Another suspected drone attack on Wednesday, off the coast of Crete, led Spain and Italy to <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/ce3yz939qnpo\">deploy naval ships to assist the flotilla</a>.</p><p>Addressing the incidents, Thunberg accused Israeli officials of making \"baseless threats\" that violate international law, and asked: \"Why would they attack a peaceful humanitarian mission aiming to bring humanitarian aid to a starving population?\"</p><p>Israel has not commented on the drone attack, but has previously said it would not let the flotilla reach its destination.</p><p>Thunberg and 11 other activists were detained by Israeli authorities in June after they intercepted another boat heading for Gaza with a token amount of aid in the Mediterranean.</p><p>She was held in Tel Aviv for a day before being deported to France. </p><p>Thunberg accused Israel of illegally kidnapping her and the other activists while they were in international waters. Israel said it had prevented a breach of the maritime blockade around Gaza.</p></div>"
