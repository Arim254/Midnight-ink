health.</p><p>The party says the move would protect youngsters from \"addictive algorithms\", citing concerns over excessive phone usage.</p><p>It also wants a two-hour \"doomscrolling cap\" limiting how long under-18s can access TikTok-style video clips.</p><p>The party says its own research has shown excessive social media use can lead to anxiety, sleep disruption and shortened attention spans.</p></div><div><p>Announcing the plan at the party's autumn conference in Bournemouth, technology spokesperson Victoria Collins said excessive social media use brings well-documented risks, \"just like cigarettes or alcohol\".</p><p>Adding that the issue was a public heath \"crisis,\" she said social media apps had become \"more and more addictive\" for children.</p><p>She added that mandatory health alerts would not prevent teenagers using social media or connecting with friends online, but would \"ensure they go into the experience with their eyes open to the risks\".</p><p>\"When we pick up a pack of cigarettes or a bottle of wine, we expect to be told about the harm those products will pose to our health,\" she argued.</p><p>\"So why is social media, the key driver of a crisis in young people's mental health, any different?\"</p></div><div><p>Graphic pictures to illustrate the dangers of smoking have been mandatory on cigarette packets in the UK since 2008.</p><p>Alcoholic drinks must display the volume of alcohol, whilst the units and warnings against drinking while pregnant are often displayed under a series of voluntary industry schemes.</p><p>The government is considering making these mandatory as part of its <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cjd2y7dkjpxo\">10-year NHS plan</a>, along with dedicated alcohol \"health warning messages\".</p><p>The Liberal Democrats are pointing to proposals for social media <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c98821dn27lo\">suggested last year</a> by Vivek Murthy, who was the most senior health adviser in the Biden administration.</p><p>He had suggested that under-18s accessing social media platforms should be referred to research on the mental health impact of using the apps. </p></div><p></p><h2>Smartphone ban</h2><p></p><div><p>Children aged eight to 17 spend between two and five hours online per day, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.ofcom.org.uk/media-use-and-attitudes/media-habits-children/a-window-into-young-childrens-online-worlds\">according to Ofcom research</a>.</p><p>Children have to be at least 13 to create their own social media profile, with stricter rules on age checks coming into force in July. </p><p>The new regulations also introduced new rules requiring platforms to change the algorithms which determine what is shown in children's feeds.</p><p>The Liberal Democrats have previously pushed unsuccessfully to raise the age at which tech companies can collect children's data from 13 to 16. </p><p>The Labour government is currently <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c3d4349gdx4o\">considering</a> a two-hour cap on the use of individual social media apps for children, along with a 22:00 curfew.</p><p>But in her speech, Collins said that ministers \"make noise\" about online safety but had yet failed to deliver on promises of stronger time curbs.</p><p>Ministers have also previously faced pressure from the Conservatives to legislate for an England-wide ban on smartphones in schools.</p><p>Labour has so far stopped short of legislating for such a ban, although it has said it is reviewing guidance that allows individual headteachers to ban the devices. </p></div></article>"

Welfare reform is happening all the time. Anyone who looks at the current system shouldn't conclude that the thing to do is to circle the wagons around it,'' he said.</p><p>He also did not rule out tightening up eligibility for universal credit or removing entitlement for health-related universal credit payments to those under the age of 22.</p><p>''Look, I'm not ruling anything out. Welfare reform is really important. At the moment this system is unhealthy for people and in the long run is pushing up the benefits bill because we're not getting the help to people who could work,\" he added.</p></div><div><p>The scale of the challenge is daunting. About 3.7 million people of working age receive health-related benefits. The independent Office for Budget Responsibility forecasts that the bill for health and disability benefits will reach £100bn by 2030.</p><p>McFadden spoke to the BBC from a Job Centre Plus in Barking, East London. There he met four women who spoke movingly about how traumatic events in their lives had led to ill health and several years on sickness benefits. All had been assigned a specialist work coach who they said had helped give them confidence.</p><p>Faiza described how domestic violence had led to depression and anxiety and a feeling she was \"finished\". Hana, who trembled as she spoke, said that her body had \"shutdown\" after the collapse of her marriage and several surgeries.</p><p>The women's names have been changed to protect their identities. </p><p>All said they wanted to work, but under the current system they are under no obligation to engage with a job centre.</p><p>McFadden said the system had created a \"binary divide\" which separated people into fit for work and not fit for work in an \"unhealthy\" way. </p><p>He said 1,000 specially trained job centre staff would offer voluntary support to those on sickness benefits.</p><p>The government says that work coaches – known as Pathways to Work advisers – are now based in every job centre in England, Wales, and Scotland.</p><p>\"We've reallocated support to people who've been away from the labour market for a long time, who've been, frankly, signed off, paid benefits and untouched for years.

    "body": "<div><p>Trump officials are expected to link the use of pain reliever Tylenol in pregnant women to autism, according to US media reports. </p><p>At an Oval Office event on Monday, the US president will reportedly advise pregnant women in the US to only take Tylenol, known as paracetamol elsewhere, to relieve high fevers.</p><p>At the Charlie Kirk memorial service on Sunday, Trump said he had an \"amazing\" announcement coming on autism, saying it was \"out of control\" but they might now have a reason why.</p><p>Some studies have shown a link between pregnant women taking Tylenol and autism, but these findings are inconsistent and do not prove the drug causes autism. </p></div><div><p>Tylenol is a popular brand of pain relief medication sold in the United States, Canada and some other countries. Its active ingredient is acetaminophen, which is called paracetamol outside North America.</p><p>Tylenol maker Kenvue has defended the use of the drug in pregnant women.</p><p>In a statement to the BBC, it said: \"We believe independent, sound science clearly shows that taking acetaminophen does not cause autism. We strongly disagree with any suggestion otherwise and are deeply concerned with the health risk this poses for expecting mothers.\"</p><p>Acetaminophen is the safest pain reliever option for pregnant women, it added, and without it, women face a dangerous choice between suffering through conditions like fever or use riskier alternatives.</p><p>The BBC has contacted the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) for comment. </p><p>In April, the leader of HHS, Robert F Kennedy Jr, pledged \"a massive testing and research effort\" to determine the cause of autism in five months.</p><p>But experts have cautioned that finding the causes of autism - a complex syndrome that has been researched for decades - would not be simple. </p><p>The widely held view of researchers is that there is no single cause of autism, which is thought to be the result of a complex mix of genetic and environmental factors.</p><ul><li><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cx25l92q9xgo\">Tylenol-maker shares hit after report of autism link</a></li></ul><p>The American College of Obstetrics and Gynecology said doctors across the country have consistently identified Tylenol as one of the only safe pain relievers for pregnant women.</p><p>\"[S]tudies that have been conducted in the past, show no clear evidence that proves a direct relationship between the prudent use of acetaminophen during any trimester and fetal developmental issues,\" the group has said. </p><p>The drug is recommended by other major medical groups as well as other governments around the world. </p><p>In August, a <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://hsph.harvard.edu/news/using-acetaminophen-during-pregnancy-may-increase-childrens-autism-and-adhd-risk/\">review of research</a> led by the dean of Harvard University's Chan School of Public Health found that children may be more likely to develop autism and other neurodevelopmental disorders when exposed to Tylenol during pregnancy. </p><p>The researchers argued some steps should be taken to limit use of the drug, but said the pain reliever was still important for treating maternal fever and pain, which can also have negative effects for children. </p><p>But another <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38592388/\">study, published in 2024,</a> found no relationship between exposure to Tylenol and autism. </p><p>\"There is no robust evidence or convincing studies to suggest there is any causal relationship,\" said Monique Botha, a professor in social and developmental psychology at Durham University. </p><p>Dr Botha added that pain relief for pregnant women was \"woefully lacking\", with Tylenol being one of the only safe options for the population. </p><p>Autism diagnoses have increased sharply since 2000, and by 2020 the rate among 8-year-olds reached 2.77%, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).</p><p>Scientists attribute at least part of the rise to increased awareness of autism and an expanding definition of the disorder. Researchers have also been investigating environmental factors.</p><p>In the past, Kennedy has offered debunked theories about the rising rates of autism, blaming vaccines despite a lack of evidence. </p></div>"

Paris has said Belgium, Luxembourg and Malta are also set to announce formal recognition, along with the tiny states of Andorra and San Marino. Portugal made its own declaration late on Sunday.</p><p>A number of other European countries have already recognised a Palestinian state, including Spain and Norway last year, but Macron's move is seen as a gamble by some domestic commentators which might make little difference on the ground.</p></div><div><p>Ahead of Macron's announcement, the Palestinian and Israeli flags were displayed on the Eiffel Tower on Sunday night. A number of town halls in France also flew Palestinian flags on Monday, despite a government order to local prefects to maintain neutrality.</p><p>Pro-Palestinian protests also took place in Italy, in some 80 towns and cities in Italy, where Giorgia Meloni's government said recently it could be \"counter-productive\" to recognise a state that did not exist.</p><p>Public transport and ports were disrupted in a day of action organised by some trade unions. A key metro line in Milan was shut down, while university students in Turin and Bologna blocked access top lecture halls.</p><p>In Germany, the government says Palestinian statehood is not currently up for debate, and Foreign Minister Johann Wadephul explained as he left for New York on Monday that \"for Germany, recognition of a Palestinian state comes more at the end of the process. But this process must begin now\".</p><p>Although Germany is one of Israel's closest allies in Europe, its chancellor, Friedrich Merz, has become increasingly critical of Israel's military response in Gaza.</p><p>European Union officials have also toughened their language against Israel in recent weeks. European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen called for an end last week to \"the horrific events taking place in Gaza on a daily basis\".</p><p>In a CBS News interview late on Sunday, President Macron spoke of a phased plan that would be geared towards isolating Hamas.</p><p>The first stage would involve a ceasefire, a release of all hostages and then the stabilisation of Gaza, he explained. The second would involve governance and reconstruction of Gaza, and the \"third package, the perspective of two states\".</p><p>Opening a French embassy would be conditional on the release of hostages still held by Hamas, he stressed.</p><p>But Macron's high-profile move in United Nations has met with criticism from some of his political opponents.</p><p>Jordan Bardella, of the far-right National Rally, said it was a \"mistake, while Hamas still holds Israeli hostages\", and he pointed out that it amounted to \"rewarding the atrocities committed on 7 October [2023], during the deadliest attack ever known by the state of Israel\".</p></div>"

Law enforcement is involved to investigate,\" the agency said in a statement to news agency Reuters.</p></div><div><p>It's not known who is behind the attack, but criminal gangs often use ransomware to seriously disrupt their victims' systems and demand a ransom in bitcoin to reverse the damage.</p><p>The BBC has seen internal crisis communications from staff inside Heathrow Airport which urges airlines to continue to use manual workarounds to board and check in passengers as the recovery is ongoing.</p><p>Heathrow said on Sunday it was still working to resolve the issue, and apologised to customers who had faced delayed travel. </p><p>It stressed \"the vast majority of flights have continued to operate\" and urged passengers to check their flight status before travelling to the airport.</p><p>The BBC understands about half of the airlines flying from Heathrow were back online in some form by Sunday - including British Airways, which has been using a back-up system since Saturday.</p></div><p></p><h2>Continued disruption</h2><p></p><div><p>The attack against US software maker Collins Aerospace was discovered on Friday night and resulted in disruption across several airports on Saturday.</p><p>While this had eased significantly in Berlin and London Heathrow by Sunday, delays and flight cancellations remained.</p><p>Brussels Airport, also affected, said the \"service provider is actively working on the issue\" but it was still \"unclear\" when the issue would be resolved.</p><p>They have asked airlines to cancel nearly 140 of their 276 scheduled outbound flights for Monday, according to the AP news agency.</p><p>Meanwhile, a Berlin Airport spokesperson told the BBC some airlines were still boarding passengers manually and it had no indication on how long the electronic outage would last.</p></div><div><p>It is understood that hackers behind the attack targeted a popular checking software called Muse.</p><p>Collins Aerospace has not explained what happened or told the public how long things will take to be resolved. The company is still referring to it as a 'cyber incident'.</p><p>In a statement on Monday morning, the software provider said it was in the final stages of completing necessary software updates.</p><p>The internal memo sent to Heathrow staff, seen by the BBC, says more than a thousand computers may have been \"corrupted\" and most of the work to bring them back online is having to be done in person and not remotely.</p><p>The note also says that Collins rebuilt its systems and relaunched them only to realise the hackers were still inside the system.</p><p>In separate advice to airlines, Collins told staff not to turn off computers or log out of the Muse software if they were logged in.</p><p>The company declined to comment on the memo and its contents.</p><p>Ransomware attacks are a prolific problem for organisations around the country, with organised cyber crime gangs earning hundreds of millions of dollars from ransoms every year.</p><p>In April, UK retailer Marks and Spencer was hit by ransomware <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cvg81m2mdmjo\">that cost it at least £400m to recover from and months of disruption</a>.
