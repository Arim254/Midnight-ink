In more ways than one.</b></p><p>For the first time in his career, the 6ft 6in forward realised he was not the tallest player in the dressing room after completing his club-record move from Stuttgart last month.</p><p>Alongside Dan Burn (6ft 7in), the German now finds himself surrounded by other imposing figures, including Malick Thiaw, Sven Botman, Joelinton and William Osula.</p><p>These players do not all start for Newcastle at any one given time, but this towering side still have all the ingredients to carry a threat at set-plays.</p><p>But as yet, it has not quite happened for Eddie Howe's giants in front of goal this season.</p><p>\"We have the players, we have the height and we have the delivery,\" the Newcastle head coach said before facing set-piece masters Arsenal on Sunday. \"But something is not quite clicking, and that's not a criticism of any coach. That's a criticism of me.</p><p>\"I'm ultimately responsible for it. We can do better in that respect and we will do the work to try and be better.\"</p></div><p></p><h2 id=\"We-should-be-the-best-in-the-world\"><span>'We should be the best in the world'</span></h2><p></p><div><p>It is instructive to note that Howe was fielding similar questions nearly a year ago.</p><p>Newcastle had just gone a whopping 50 corners without scoring in the Premier League - but they eventually started firing again.</p><p>By the time Newcastle contested last season's Carabao Cup final in March, Howe  even sensed an opportunity as he stressed to his staff that \"a set-play could win us the game... let's go into the detail that could swing it for us\".</p><p>Newcastle spent the next couple of weeks working on free-kicks and corners after spotting Liverpool's vulnerabilities in deeper areas inside the box.</p><p>The routines were not necessarily coming off on the training ground, but one did when it mattered most at Wembley as the Magpies went on to end a 70-year wait for a major domestic trophy.</p><p>Burn's opener that day neatly illustrated the work of assistant manager Jason Tindall and set-play analyst Kieran Taylor, who played their part in Newcastle scoring a respectable 13 goals from free-kicks and corners in the Premier League last season.</p><p>However, given the huge amount of work involved, Howe had been looking to bring in an additional set-play coach to help share the load for some time.</p><p>And Martin Mark's record at set-piece innovators Midtjylland certainly stood up when he joined Newcastle in June.</p><p>Midtjylland scored more goals from set-plays (19) than any other side in the Danish top flight last season - even after excluding penalties - and maximising dead-ball situations proved crucial to their title win the previous year.</p><p>Kristian Bak, who is Midtjylland's head of sport, said Mark's \"hunger really shone through\" during his time at the MCH Arena.</p><p>\"Martin stood up for the idea that we should be the best in the world in that discipline,\" he said of the 32-year-old. \"For him, every single day had to involve set-pieces and having a person like that is a gift.</p><p>\"His hunger and his nerdy attention to detail rubbed off on several departments, and he was very good at spreading the importance of set-pieces across the whole organisation. He took that part to the next level.\"</p></div><div><figure><figcaption><span>Media caption, </span><p>Newcastle 'a must win game for Arsenal' - Keown</p></figcaption></figure></div><p></p><h2 id=\"Long-throws-return\"><span>Long throws return</span></h2><p></p><div><p>There has certainly been a shift in Newcastle's approach this season.</p><p>The Magpies only launched a single long throw into the box in the Premier League last year. However, according to Opta, Howe's side have already flung 13 long throws into the penalty area in the opening five games of the new campaign.</p><p>Just as Newcastle's rugby-style restarts follow a wider trend in the game – they have taken to booting the ball into touch from kick-off in an attempt to put the opposition under pressure deep in their own half - so, too, do the black-and-whites' use of long throws.</p><p>It is admittedly a small sample size, but there has been an average of 3.4 long throws into the penalty area per match in the Premier League this year. For context, in the whole of the 2020-21 campaign, that number was 0.9 per game.</p><p>No wonder England manager Thomas Tuchel remarked that \"the long throw is back\".</p><p>Liverpool found that out when the champions came to St James' Park last month on a night boss Arne Slot admitted \"you cannot control a game of football if every single ball is thrown into your 18-yard box\".</p><p>Newcastle's first goal actually came from such a situation. Tino Livramento's long throw was headed back to him out on the left and, with his team-mates still forward, the full-back was able to pick out the head of Bruno Guimaraes at the far post.</p><p>Then for Newcastle's second, goalkeeper Nick Pope stepped forward to take a free-kick and his long ball forward was flicked on by Burn and knocked in by substitute Osula.</p><p>Two goals from two dead-ball situations dragged 10-man Newcastle level as the game became increasingly chaotic. </p><p>Though Newcastle went on to lose the game, it was a timely reminder of the power of set-plays.</p></div><p></p><h2 id=\"A-really-talented-guy\"><span>'A really talented guy'</span></h2><p></p><div><p>Finding a way to cause such mayhem on a consistent basis is the challenge for Newcastle.</p><p>Only four Premier League sides have had more shots from set-pieces than Howe's team (five) this season, but Newcastle have found the back of the net on just one occasion from a corner or a free-kick in all competitions.</p><p>When it comes to expected goals from dead-ball situations, Newcastle (1.56) are currently a long way off Arsenal (3.55), who top the table in this field in the top-flight.</p><p>Newcastle have yet to concede from a set-piece, but Howe was the first to recognise that his side have \"work to do\" at the other end.</p><p>So will it take time?</p><p>\"I hope not,\" he said. \"That's not the plan. The plan is to make the difference from set-plays. I think we have been really good in that respect for a long time.</p><p>\"When you look at games like the Bournemouth game [a goalless draw], if you play as we did, defend as we did and nick the game 1-0 on a set-play, it's the perfect away performance - but we didn't.\"</p><p>Sunday's opponents Arsenal have certainly exploited such situations.</p><p>Half of Arsenal's goals in the Premier League this season have come from set-pieces, including what proved to be a winner at Manchester United and openers against Nottingham Forest and Leeds United.</p><p>Arsenal remain the team to beat in that respect.</p><p>But freelance throw-in specialist Thomas Gronnemark, who worked with Mark at Midtjylland last season, has no doubt that Newcastle will eventually click from set-plays.</p><p>\"Martin is a really talented guy,\" he said. \"Yes, he's very young but I don't care if someone is 15 years old or 80 years old.</p><p>\"If they are good enough for the job and you can see the perspective, you should hire people and Martin is a fantastic guy to work with. I think he will be a big plus for Newcastle.\"</p></div><section><p></p><h2>More on this story</h2><p></p><ul><li></li><li></li></ul></section></article></div>"

The banking secrecy laws, now much diluted, were designed to shield an individual's personal finances from the prying eyes of the state.</p><p>For years, Google Street View was controversial in Switzerland - and even today, following a ruling by the Swiss Federal Court, images taken close to schools, women's refuges, hospitals or prisons must be automatically blurred before going online. </p><p>There are also far fewer CCTV cameras in Switzerland than in many of its European neighbours.</p><p>Opponents of digital ID cards, who gathered enough signatures to force another referendum on the issue, argue that this measure could still undermine individual privacy.</p><p>They also fear that, despite the new restrictions on how data is collected and stored, it could still be used to track people and for marketing purposes.</p><p>The latest opinion polls, however, show that this time, voters may be ready to give electronic IDs a chance. </p><p>They have already had experience of the government's Covid ID, which was used during the pandemic to show vaccination status and was mandatory to enter restaurants and bars. </p><p>Initial scepticism turned to satisfaction when people realised it allowed them, finally, to get out and about again.</p><p>As for the concerns about marketing of personal data, most Swiss have smartphones and are keen users of social media. </p><p>Tech giants are already harvesting their likes and dislikes, many voters realise, so believe that allowing the Swiss authorities to check on a few details from time to time will not make a big difference.</p></div>"

The initial idea was simple: why not design a sleek, aesthetic shoe rack for students? But as they dug deeper, the real culprit emerged - it wasn't clutter but the foul smell that was driving the footwear outdoors.</p><p>\"It wasn't about space or a lack of shoe racks - there was plenty of room. The problem was frequent sweating and the constant use of shoes that made them smelly,\" says Mr Mittal, who now works for a software company.</p><p>So the two embarked on a survey in the university hostels asking a truly human question: if our sneakers reek, doesn't that ruin the entire experience of using a shoe rack?</p></div><figure><div><p><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20250919-090805-05e5ba0164-web-2.30.1-2/grey-placeholder.png\" /><img srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/efc8/live/08c23e40-9926-11f0-9a4d-cda90a899290.jpg.webp 240w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/efc8/live/08c23e40-9926-11f0-9a4d-cda90a899290.jpg.webp 320w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/efc8/live/08c23e40-9926-11f0-9a4d-cda90a899290.jpg.webp 480w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/efc8/live/08c23e40-9926-11f0-9a4d-cda90a899290.jpg.webp 640w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/efc8/live/08c23e40-9926-11f0-9a4d-cda90a899290.jpg.webp 800w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/efc8/live/08c23e40-9926-11f0-9a4d-cda90a899290.jpg.webp 1024w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/efc8/live/08c23e40-9926-11f0-9a4d-cda90a899290.jpg.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/efc8/live/08c23e40-9926-11f0-9a4d-cda90a899290.jpg.webp\" alt=\"Vikash Kumar (left) and his former student Sarthak Mittal\" /></p></div><p></p><figcaption>Vikash Kumar (left) and his former student Sarthak Mittal won the deep dive into stinky shoes</figcaption><p></p></figure><div><p>Their survey of 149 university students - 80% of them male - confirmed what most of us already know but rarely admit: more than half had felt embarrassed by their own shoes or someone else's stink, nearly all kept their footwear in racks at home, and hardly anyone had heard of existing deodorising products. Homegrown hacks - tea bags in shoes, sprinkling baking soda, spraying deodorant - weren't cutting it.</p><p>The two researchers then turned to science. The culprit, they knew from existing research, was Kytococcus sedentarius, a bacterium that thrives in sweaty shoes. Their experiments showed that a short blast of ultraviolet light killed the microbes and banished the stink.</p><p>\"In India, almost every household has a shoe rack of one type or the other, and having a rack which keeps the shoes smell free would give a great experience,\" the authors noted in their paper.</p><p>They saw \"smelly shoes as an opportunity for re-designing the traditional shoe rack for a better user experience\".</p><p>The result? Not your average ergonomics paper - and just the kind of delightfully oddball idea: a prototype for a UVC light-equipped shoe rack that doesn't just store shoes but sterilises them. (UV covers a spectrum, but only the C band has germicidal properties.)</p><p>For the experiment, the researchers used shoes worn by university athletes, which had a pronounced odour. Because bacterial build-up is greatest near the toe, the UVC light was focused there.</p><p>The study measured odour levels against exposure time, and found that just 2–3 minutes of UVC treatment was sufficient to kill the bacteria and eliminate the foul smell. It was not simple: too much light meant too much heat which ended up burning the shoe rubber.</p></div><figure><div><p><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20250919-090805-05e5ba0164-web-2.30.1-2/grey-placeholder.png\" /><img srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/d84f/live/1041cc80-9926-11f0-9a4d-cda90a899290.jpg.webp 240w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/d84f/live/1041cc80-9926-11f0-9a4d-cda90a899290.jpg.webp 320w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/d84f/live/1041cc80-9926-11f0-9a4d-cda90a899290.jpg.webp 480w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/d84f/live/1041cc80-9926-11f0-9a4d-cda90a899290.jpg.webp 640w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/d84f/live/1041cc80-9926-11f0-9a4d-cda90a899290.jpg.webp 800w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/d84f/live/1041cc80-9926-11f0-9a4d-cda90a899290.jpg.webp 1024w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/d84f/live/1041cc80-9926-11f0-9a4d-cda90a899290.jpg.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/d84f/live/1041cc80-9926-11f0-9a4d-cda90a899290.jpg.webp\" alt=\"Hindustan Times via Getty Images Shoe racks with lots of sneakers\" /><span>Hindustan Times via Getty Images</span></p></div><p></p><figcaption>Most shoe racks store shoes - and dont fight odour, say the researchers</figcaption><p></p></figure><div><p>The researchers didn't just point a UVC tube light at the shoes and hope for the best - they measured every whiff.</p><p>At the start, the odour was described as \"strong, pungent, rotten-cheese-like\".

Its parish council chairman David Sutton said residents had been kept in the dark about the potential plans, including how many new homes could be built.</p><p>\"The biggest problem we've got at the moment is that even today, as an announcement's being made, we've been given no idea whatsoever of the scale of what we're being asked to live amongst,\" he told the PA news agency.</p><p>\"Nobody's come to talk to us at all.\"</p><p>The promise of a \"new generation of new towns\" was included in Labour's election manifesto last year.</p><p>The 12 proposed developments range from large-scale standalone new communities, to expansions of existing towns and regeneration schemes within cities.</p><p>Sites in Cheshire, South Gloucestershire, East Devon, Plymouth and Manchester are among those which have been recommended for development.</p><p>The chosen sites will be subject to environmental assessments and consultation, with the government confirming the final locations and funding next spring.</p><p>Labour said each new town would have at least 10,000 homes and they could collectively result in 300,000 homes being built across England over the coming decades.</p><p>The government has welcomed a recommendation from the New Towns Taskforce that at least 40% of these new homes should be classed as affordable housing.</p><p>A New Towns Unit will be tasked with bringing in millions of pounds of public and private sector funding to invest in GP surgeries, schools, green spaces, libraries and transport for the new developments.</p><p>The taskforce has recommended new towns are delivered by development corporations, which could have special planning powers to compulsory purchase land, invest in local services, and grant planning permission.</p><p>This follows the model of the regeneration of Stratford in east London during and after the 2012 Olympic and Paralympic Games.</p><p>Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer said: \"For so many families, homeownership is a distant dream.</p><p>\"My Labour government will sweep aside the blockers to get homes built, building the next generation of new towns.\"</p><p>In his speech, the housing secretary will promise to \"build baby build\", while \"taking lessons from the post-war Labour government housing boom\".</p><p>\"This party built new towns after the war to meet our promise of homes fit for heroes. Now, with the worst economic inheritance since that war, we will once again build cutting-edge communities to provide homes fit for families of all shapes and sizes,\" Reed is expected to say.</p><p>After World War Two Clement Attlee's government planned the first wave of new towns, including in Stevenage, Crawley and Welwyn Garden City, to relocate people from poor or bombed-out housing, with development corporations assigned responsibility for building them.</p></div><div><p>The announcement comes as Labour members gather in Liverpool for the party's annual conference.</p><p>It will be Reed's first major speech since he took over from Angela Rayner as housing secretary, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c80gr5emk43o\">after she resigned for failing to pay enough tax on a flat purchase</a>.</p><p>It has been a bruising few weeks for Sir Keir, who is facing questions over his leadership and the direction of his party.</p><p>With Labour trailing behind Reform UK in the polls, the prime minister has stepped up his attacks on Nigel Farage's party.</p><p>Arriving in Liverpool on Saturday, he warned Reform would \"tear this country apart\" and said the conference would be an opportunity to set out his alternative to the \"toxic divide and decline\" offered by the party.</p></div><div><p>The New Towns Taskforce has recommended 12 locations are taken forward by the government:</p><ul><li>A standalone settlement in Adlington, Cheshire East</li><li>A corridor of development in South Gloucestershire, across Brabazon and the West Innovation Arc</li><li>A development bringing together Chase Park and Crews Hill in Enfield, north London</li><li>Redevelopment of the former airbase at Heyford Park in Cherwell, Oxfordshire</li><li>An urban development in the South Bank area of Leeds</li><li>New homes in Victoria North, on the edge of Manchester city centre</li><li>A standalone settlement in Marlcombe, East Devon</li><li>A renewal of Milton Keynes city centre and an expansion of its periphery, alongside a new mass transit system</li><li>Densified development in Plymouth</li><li>A new settlement in Tempsford, Bedfordshire</li><li>A riverside settlement in Thamesmead, south-east London</li><li>Expanded development around Worcestershire Parkway train station</li></ul></div>"
