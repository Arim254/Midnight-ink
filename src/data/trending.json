Or more accurately, what she called them.</p><p>\"Keighley Queens\" is her best guess.</p><p>Kildunne had turned up at a trial for Yorkshire's under-15s side. She hadn't been invited, but her mother spotted the date and took her along.</p><p>Asked which team she played for, a club-less Kildunne had to improvise. The Keighley Queens, or something similar, were born.</p><p>Kildunne had previously had two clubs. </p><p>Having tagged along with her neighbours' two boys at the age of six, she would cross town and codes to play both league for Keighley Albion and union for Keighley on weekends.</p><p>The only girl on the pitch, she would scorch past once-scornful boys.</p><p>\"I just loved the pressure of proving myself,\" she remembers.</p><p>\"I wanted to make a statement. 'You are looking over your shoulder and laughing, but just wait...'\"</p><p>She had overturned similar preconceptions at secondary school. Arriving as an 11-year-old, she told the PE staff she would be playing rugby, not netball.</p><p>She was shoved out on the wing for the B team. By the end of the season, she was named back of the year.</p><p>But her progress hit a familiar roadblock. Puberty hit, genders split, teams expanded to 15 players and rugby options for young women grew sparse.</p><p>\"I didn't know that women's rugby was a big thing at that point,\" says Kildunne.</p><p>\"Instead I wanted to be the next Steven Gerrard.\"</p></div><div><figure><figcaption><span>Media caption, </span><p>England's Kildunne 'proved why she's world's best player'</p></figcaption></figure></div><div><p>By the time Kildunne arrived at that Yorkshire trial, she had moved on to football.</p><p>A childhood Liverpool fan, she used to run around the house in a replica shirt, her curly hair slicked back to resemble Spanish striker Fernando Torres.</p><p>It provided the team environment she relished.</p><p>She was part of a Farsley Celtic team who travelled to Manchester City's Etihad training campus and beat the Premier League giant's academy side 7-1.</p><p>But Kildunne still hungered for rugby.</p><p>\"When you've got that feeling inside you that you're meant to do something special, you have to have that dedication and drive to overcome barriers,\" she said.</p><p>\"There's always another route. If it's not A, B or C, it's probably X, Y, Z.\"</p><p>For Kildunne, it was Yorkshire. Having been accepted to represent her county, she thought she had better find a real club to replace 'Keighley Queens'.</p><p>She joined West Park Leeds. Soon after she played Castleford. On the opposite team was Carla Middleton, the daughter of future Red Roses coach Simon Middleton.</p><p>\"I'd never seen anything like it,\" said Middleton Sr.</p><p>\"Her team went 30 points down and she kept them in it, almost on her own, running in tries and kicking goals from the touchline. You don't see that from many 15-year-olds.\"</p><p>Three years later, Middleton gave a raft of youngsters their England debuts in a match against Canada in Barnet.</p><p>Hannah Botterman, Zoe Harrison, Abby Dow and Jess Breach all won their first caps, along with an 18-year-old Kildunne who scored a try during her 27-minute cameo in a 79-5 win.</p></div><p></p><h2 id=\"From-fangirling-in-Monaco-to-Englands-home-hero\"><span>From 'fangirling' in Monaco to England's home hero</span></h2><p></p><div><figure><p><span><picture><source srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/240/cpsprodpb/ce85/live/83d5ea70-9960-11f0-80b9-69e2e45f1309.jpg.webp 240w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/320/cpsprodpb/ce85/live/83d5ea70-9960-11f0-80b9-69e2e45f1309.jpg.webp 320w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/480/cpsprodpb/ce85/live/83d5ea70-9960-11f0-80b9-69e2e45f1309.jpg.webp 480w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/624/cpsprodpb/ce85/live/83d5ea70-9960-11f0-80b9-69e2e45f1309.jpg.webp 624w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/800/cpsprodpb/ce85/live/83d5ea70-9960-11f0-80b9-69e2e45f1309.jpg.webp 800w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/976/cpsprodpb/ce85/live/83d5ea70-9960-11f0-80b9-69e2e45f1309.jpg.webp 976w\" type=\"image/webp\"></source><img alt=\"Ellie Kildunne runs with the ball in her left hand\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/1024/cpsprodpb/ce85/live/83d5ea70-9960-11f0-80b9-69e2e45f1309.jpg\" srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/240/cpsprodpb/ce85/live/83d5ea70-9960-11f0-80b9-69e2e45f1309.jpg 240w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/320/cpsprodpb/ce85/live/83d5ea70-9960-11f0-80b9-69e2e45f1309.jpg 320w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/480/cpsprodpb/ce85/live/83d5ea70-9960-11f0-80b9-69e2e45f1309.jpg 480w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/624/cpsprodpb/ce85/live/83d5ea70-9960-11f0-80b9-69e2e45f1309.jpg 624w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/800/cpsprodpb/ce85/live/83d5ea70-9960-11f0-80b9-69e2e45f1309.jpg 800w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/976/cpsprodpb/ce85/live/83d5ea70-9960-11f0-80b9-69e2e45f1309.jpg 976w\" /></picture></span><span><span>Image source, </span>Getty Images</span></p><figcaption><span>Image caption, </span><p>Kildunne runs in a try on her England debut in November 2017.

    "body": "<div><div><p>7 hours ago</p></div><p><span><p><span>Daniel Sandford</span><span>UK correspondent</span></p></span></p></div><div><p>ID cards have always been viewed with suspicion in the UK. For some people they can conjure up images of authoritarian states like Germany in the 1930s, and men in jackboots barking \"May we see your papers please?\"</p><p>There were two periods when we had compulsory ID cards here in Britain. The first was during World War One. The second was from the beginning of World War Two until the early 1950s.  </p><p>When the system was abandoned in 1952, an editorial in the Guardian said: \"In this country we do not like this sort of thing. Better a little evasion and inefficiency than too much petty bureaucratic interference with the individual.\"</p></div><div><p>The last attempt to introduce an ID scheme, in 2006, was born through familiar concerns about immigration and illegal working, as well as worries about benefit fraud and terrorism. It was scrapped by the coalition government when they came to power in 2010.</p><p>Fifteen years on, Sir Keir Starmer is proposing something slightly different. Not an ID card, but a digital ID scheme. It is a way of proving your identity, and your right to work in the UK, using modern smartphone technology. </p><p>Though the government also says it \"will ensure that it works for those who aren't able to use a smartphone, with inclusion at the heart of its design\". How that would be achieved is not yet clear, though it might mean people without a smartphone have to use a physical ID card.</p><ul><li><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/clyl3lzzed2o\">What is the plan for digital IDs and will they be mandatory?</a></li></ul><p>Digital ID is being sold by Downing Street as a way of reducing illegal working by migrants who do not have the right to earn wages in Britain. </p><p>The rules are already - in theory - quite tough. Employers can be fined £60,000 per illegal employee if they have not done the correct checks.</p></div><div><p>The government says the proposed new digital ID - which will cost the user nothing - \"will be the authoritative proof of who someone is and their residency status in this country\".</p><p>It will include the holder's name, date of birth, photograph, and information on nationality or residency status. </p><p>Instead of involving a physical card linked to a National Identity Register, this new proposal is more a proof of identity scheme. As well as proving a person's right to work the government promise that it will in future \"make it simpler to apply for services like driving licences, childcare and welfare.\"</p><p>Ministers say that \"by the end of the parliament\" digital ID will be compulsory when checking someone's right to work. They claim that this will in turn reduce on of the \"key pull factors\" for people arriving in the UK in small boats.</p><p>\"You will not be able to work in the United Kingdom if you do not have digital ID\", the prime minister said. \"It is as simple as that.\"</p><p>A more secure way of people proving their identity might reduce illegal working, and avoid the proliferation of fake documents in circulation. </p><p>At the moment, it is quite easy to borrow, steal or use someone else's National Insurance number and that is part of the problem in the shadow economy - but the idea is a picture would make it - in theory - harder to abuse that system.</p><p>But former Home Office official David Rennie said he did not believe the plan would have \"any bearing on people coming to this country illegally\". </p><p>\"It's the black economy - by its nature, they're not performing right to work checks,\" he told BBC Radio 4's the World at One.</p><p>Mr Rennie, who now works at Orchestrating Identity - a company that performs these checks - acknowledged the system had \"gaps\" and could be improved, with some people finding it difficult to prove they could work in the UK.</p><p>\"But that doesn't mean that you have to implement, at great expense to the taxpayer, a digital identity system for the whole country. They should really focus on improving what they've already put in place.\"</p><p>Jill Rutter, of the Institute for Government, has meanwhile emphasised the need for \"stronger Labour market enforcement\" alongside the scheme.</p><p>\"People are paying cash, people are working in what the prime minister calls the 'shadow economy',\" she said.</p><p>\"It means people won't have an excuse for not checking, saying 'I thought they were British', and people won't be able to use fake ID so easily. </p><p>\"So it will help, but I don't think it's an absolute panacea.\"</p><p>The scheme will also take time. The phrase \"by the end of the parliament\" is shorthand for 2028, when the next general election is most likely to take place. This is not something that can be done in a year.</p><p>Most EU countries have some sort of ID scheme. One of the most modern ones is in Estonia where the focus is less on preventing illegal working, and more on easy access to things like benefits and health records.</p><p>But in countries like France and Germany, which both have long-running ID schemes, illegal working is still a problem. Though the French have long-complained that one of the pull factors to the UK for people crossing the channel in small boats is that it is even easier to work illegally in Britain than it is in France.</p></div>"

Much love Ruth & Mike\".</p><p>Ms Linden, a close friend of Mrs Posner, paid tribute to her as \"the most vibrant, amazing woman\" and Mr Posner as a \"remarkable, clever, intellectual man\".</p><p>Speaking to the PA news agency, she said of Mrs Posner: \"She felt increasingly, every time I visited her over the last year, she said 'we've had enough, we're ready to go, we don't want to just exist. And that's what we're doing, we're just existing at the moment'.\"</p><p>Much of Mrs Posner's family were murdered in the Holocaust, including her parents, uncles, aunts and cousins - only she and one of her aunts survived.</p><p>The family were sent to the Radom Ghetto after the Nazis invaded Poland - but with the help of her father, Mrs Posner managed to escape onto the non-Jewish side, later hiding with a Catholic family. While living under a false identity, she was imprisoned as a Polish Catholic after the Warsaw Uprising of 1944.</p><p>She then managed to hide on a local farm near Essen until the end of World War Two, allowing her to flee to the UK aged 16.</p><p>She went on to become a member of the London Contemporary Dance Theatre and joined the Royal Shakespeare Company.</p><p>Mr Posner, a chemist, worked for United Nations aid agency Unicef and after travelling the world, the couple settled in London. They lived in Belsize Park at the time of their deaths. </p><p>Ms Linden told PA that while she was \"very sad\" at the couple's deaths, she \"completely endorses\" their decision and understands why they took it. </p><p>She said Mrs Posner had been in favour of legalising assisted dying in England: \"She wouldn't have had to make those arrangements, had to travel, she could've said goodbye more publicly.\"</p><p>Parliament is currently considering whether to change the law to allow assisted dying in England and Wales, which would apply to certain terminally ill patients reasonably expected to die within six months. Reports suggest neither of the Posners were terminally ill.</p><p>The Holocaust Memorial Trust paid tribute to Mrs Posner, describing her as \"an extraordinary woman\". </p><p>\"Although then in her 80s, she made it her mission to speak to as many young people as possible about her experiences during the Holocaust. She hoped that the leaders of tomorrow would learn the lessons of the past,\" its chief executive Karen Pollock said in a statement.</p><p>\"Ruth was one of a kind. Full of charisma and warmth, she left an impression on everyone she met. We will miss her.\"</p><p>The Campaign Against Antisemitism said she was influential in \"educating future generations and never shying away from taking part in the fight against antisemitism\".</p></div>"

Prostitution is illegal in Dubai.</p><p>At least one of Mwesigwa's clients regularly asked to defecate on the women, according to \"Mia\", whose name we have changed to protect her identity, and who said she was trapped by Mwesigwa's network.</p><p>Mwesigwa has denied all the allegations made in the BBC's investigation. He said he helped women find accommodation through landlords, and added that women followed him to parties because of his wealthy Dubai contacts.</p><p>\"I told you I am just a party person who invites big spenders on my tables, hence making many girls flock [to] my table. That makes me know many girls and that's it,\" he said.</p><p>The investigation by the BBC also found that two women linked to Mwesigwa, Monic Karungi and Kayla Birungi, died after falling from high-rise apartments. </p></div><div><p>Although their deaths were ruled as suicides, their friends and family feel the police should have investigated further.</p><p>Mwesigwa said the incidents were investigated by the Dubai police and asked us to contact them for information. They did not reply to the BBC's request.</p><p>Numerous discussions about the investigation took place in the Ugandan parliament last week, with ministers calling it \"disturbing\" and pledging to work with Interpol to ensure justice. </p><p><i>Additional reporting by Jack Burgess</i></p><ul><li>If you have any information to add to this investigation please contact runako@bbc.co.uk</li><li>Details of organisations offering information about or support after sexual abuse or with feelings of despair are available at <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/actionline\">bbc.co.uk/actionline</a>.</li></ul></div>"

    "body": "<div><div><p>5 hours ago</p></div><p><span><p><span>Harry Farley</span><span>Political correspondent</span></p></span></p></div><div><p>It is less than a year since the prime minister <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cn9gxvppxqpo\">set out his \"six milestones\"</a> - goals against which he wanted to be judged come the next election.</p><p>At the time, immigration did not feature as a priority. </p><p>Now, it is front and centre.</p><p>That shift is largely due to the rise of Nigel Farage, highlighted again today in a <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://yougov.co.uk/politics/articles/53059-yougov-mrp-shows-a-reform-uk-government-a-near-certainty-if-an-election-were-held-tomorrow\">major new poll from YouGov</a> that suggested a Reform government would be a near-certainty if a general election was held tomorrow.</p><p>There is - of course - not an election tomorrow. Sir Keir Starmer is expected to have another few years for his attempt to stop that from happening.</p></div><div><p>That fight was, he told a conference of left-wing world leaders today, a \"battle for the soul of this country\". </p><p>He said the \"defining political choice of our times\" was between those who want a \"patriotic national renewal\" and the \"politics of predatory grievance\".</p><p>This was Sir Keir at his punchiest attack, primarily against Reform UK and Nigel Farage. </p><p>Perhaps more unusually, Sir Keir also hit back against US President Donald Trump. </p><p>He appeared to mock the president when he said London was not \"the wasteland of anarchy\" it was sometimes portrayed. </p><p>Trump, of course, is among several politicians to have criticised the capital recently, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cp3qxrgl05lo\">telling the UN London had \"totally changed\" and under Mayor Sadiq Khan</a> wants \"to go to Sharia law\".</p><p>Sir Keir said social media had created \"a sort of industrialised culture of grievance, and entire world - not just a world view - created through our devices\" that was \"demonstrably untrue\".</p></div><div><p>His subversive reflection was that centre-left parties had been \"squeamish\" about saying things that were \"clearly true\" about controlling borders.</p><p>The solution was <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cn832y43ql5o\">digital ID</a> - long hinted at by government, now confirmed. </p><p>The justification is twofold. One, that it will make it easier to crackdown on illegal working, reducing the attractiveness of the UK to those crossing the Channel in small boats.</p><p>And two, that it will make everyday life easier, from proving your address when you go the council skip, to registering for benefits.</p><p>Other parties are united in their opposition. The Conservatives and Reform say it will not stop illegal working. </p><p>The Liberal Democrats and others raise concerns about privacy and civil liberties.</p><p>There is already confusion about what exactly the primary motivation is. </p><p>The former Labour Home Secretary Lord Blunkett criticised the reforms for not being strong enough.</p><p>\"I'm mystified because we are living in an era of conviction, high-profile, shake-the-tree politics, and this looks like a whimper,\" he told BBC Radio 4's, World At One. </p><p>\"Why aren't our people coming out and arguing this case full on? We need conviction politics now and we need it urgently.\"</p><p>None of this will be quick. There will be an official government consultation now, before legislation is brought to parliament. Then if it eventually becomes law, there will be a period of implementation.</p><p>Despite those calls for extra toughness, this has the potential to be a dividing line for Labour on something it believes the public support, despite more than a million people signing a petition against the idea.</p><p>But also – if it eventually becomes law – this could be a defining legacy for Sir Keir and this Labour government.</p></div>"
