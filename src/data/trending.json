Israel, it says, has never provided evidence of the allegations of systematic theft, despite repeated UN requests.</p></div><div><ul><li><b>Outside of the UK, you can </b><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IA8YL_Datm0\"><b>watch on YouTube</b></a></li></ul></div><div><p>Famine is why Palestinians in Gaza, many of them young men like Abdullah, are prepared to risk their lives at the GHF sites to get food.</p><p>It is nearly two years since Hamas killed 1,195 people in southern Israel and took 251 hostages. Forty-eight Israelis are still in Gaza. Perhaps 20 of them are thought to be alive. It remains Israel's biggest trauma since its independence in 1948.</p><p>Israel's response has been to inflict the biggest trauma Palestinians have suffered in the same nearly eight decades. The Israelis continue to argue they are acting in self defence in Gaza - a narrow strip of land that is now in ruins, and has seen the killing by Israel of at least 65,000 people, according to the Hamas-run health ministry, including more than 18,000 children. Israel rejects these figures but they are generally considered reliable by international organisations.</p><p>Abdullah was a bright young man. Sticky notes above his desk display reminders to himself to aim for 95% in his exams. Judging by the photos his father provides, he dressed smartly, with a sharp haircut and an expectant smile. He must have seen possibilities ahead in his life, even in Gaza, a place where life was hard even before the war. Now it is reduced to a struggle to survive Israeli attacks and the famine.</p></div><figure><div><p><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20250905-110137-f27f908f49-web-2.29.1-3/grey-placeholder.png\" /><img srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/61af/live/81db2590-9894-11f0-af62-91486a511a31.jpg.webp 240w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/61af/live/81db2590-9894-11f0-af62-91486a511a31.jpg.webp 320w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/61af/live/81db2590-9894-11f0-af62-91486a511a31.jpg.webp 480w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/61af/live/81db2590-9894-11f0-af62-91486a511a31.jpg.webp 640w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/61af/live/81db2590-9894-11f0-af62-91486a511a31.jpg.webp 800w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/61af/live/81db2590-9894-11f0-af62-91486a511a31.jpg.webp 1024w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/61af/live/81db2590-9894-11f0-af62-91486a511a31.jpg.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/61af/live/81db2590-9894-11f0-af62-91486a511a31.jpg.webp\" alt=\"Aerial image of where Abdullah was shot and killed in Gaza, showing where shots were fired from the direction of an IDF position, and also where aid seekers came under fire.

They went together to GHF site 4, the only one in the centre of Gaza, following the instructions of IDF soldiers about the correct route to take. To get ahead in the deadly race for food, many Palestinians arrive at the GHF sites long before dawn. Moaaz and Abdullah were waiting near a ruined house less than 500 metres from the site.</p><p>Then Abdullah said he had to deal with a call of nature, and moved, Moaaz says, about 30 metres away. That was when he was shot dead. Moaaz said he ran through heavy fire to get to his friend. He lived around 10 more minutes.</p><p>Diaa told us about his son, and how hard it is to live and stay alive in Gaza.</p><p>\"In Gaza we are a peaceful people. Abdullah was a young man like any other. May God have mercy on him. He didn't get the chance to fulfil any of his dreams.\"</p></div><p></p><figcaption>Abdullah's friend describes the moment the 19-year-old was shot dead</figcaption><p></p><div><p>We asked the IDF specifically about the death of Abdullah. It did not respond but told us it \"does not deliberately fire at innocent civilians\". GHF's lawyers say its security contractors do not open fire either. They say they are not aware of any credibly documented instance of their ever doing so - and that no-one has been shot dead at a GHF site, or within sight of one.</p><p>Abdullah's story comes from the film that we have just broadcast, called Gaza: Dying for Food, produced by Panorama and BBC Eye.  It is an investigation into hunger in Gaza, and the killing around the food distribution sites run by the GHF. Dying for Food looks at just one part of Gaza's humanitarian catastrophe. We have established how so many Palestinians are being killed seeking aid. It is a worthy subject for a half-hour television film. A comprehensive account from every angle would need a series.</p><p>Reporting and producing the film has been a considerable challenge. That is because Israel does not permit the BBC, or any other news organisation, to send teams into Gaza to report freely. Palestinian journalists inside Gaza have done heroic work, without which we would know much less about what has been happening there in the past two years. According to the UN Human Rights Office, at least 248 of them have been killed by Israel.</p><p>On Dying for Food I was the reporter, the public face of a big team of journalists. I wrote the script, but I did not interview Diaa or Moaaz about the killing of Abdullah. I wasn't present when the filming took place of the dead and dying in hospital emergency departments, of miles of rubble and Palestinians desperate to grab some food while the IDF and armed American security men working for GHF were said to have opened fire. I was able to talk to the interviewees who weren't in Gaza, either face to face or via video.</p><p>It is not the way the BBC, or any other group of journalists and film makers would choose to work. A fundamental rule of journalism is to narrow the distance between the reporter and the story. It was drummed into me when I was a BBC trainee journalist assigned to the Belfast newsroom during the Troubles in the winter of 1984-85. An acerbic news editor, using a tone that might get him into trouble these days, told me to leave the building to use my own eyes and ears, and to talk to people.</p></div><figure><div><p><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20250905-110137-f27f908f49-web-2.29.1-3/grey-placeholder.png\" /><img srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/b91e/live/fa1900d0-989f-11f0-af62-91486a511a31.jpg.webp 240w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/b91e/live/fa1900d0-989f-11f0-af62-91486a511a31.jpg.webp 320w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/b91e/live/fa1900d0-989f-11f0-af62-91486a511a31.jpg.webp 480w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/b91e/live/fa1900d0-989f-11f0-af62-91486a511a31.jpg.webp 640w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/b91e/live/fa1900d0-989f-11f0-af62-91486a511a31.jpg.webp 800w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/b91e/live/fa1900d0-989f-11f0-af62-91486a511a31.jpg.webp 1024w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/b91e/live/fa1900d0-989f-11f0-af62-91486a511a31.jpg.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/b91e/live/fa1900d0-989f-11f0-af62-91486a511a31.jpg.webp\" alt=\"Tawfik pictured sitting down.

The IDF allows some news teams short and heavily supervised visits. I have done one, for about three or four hours, in the first month of the war. It let me see the destruction first hand, and to talk to soldiers. </p><p>One IDF officer started by telling me that they worked hard to safeguard the lives of noncombatants. Even in the first few weeks of the war, Israel was being accused of ignoring its legal obligations to protect civilians. Then the officer trailed off, and in disgust told me that all the Palestinians were guilty, not just the Hamas units that had led the 7 October attacks. If they weren't guilty, he said, they would have found a way to overthrow Hamas.</p><p>To get round Israel's ban on our entry into Gaza, we commission local freelancers who are still able to operate on the ground. Our team had long conversations with them about where to film, who to interview and what to ask. We needed to know about the backgrounds and relevance to the story of potential interviewees and where filming would be an acceptable risk to take in a warzone where nowhere is safe.</p><p>From a distance, BBC journalists directed the teams we used in Gaza. We reviewed and verified the material we received, examining closely the data embedded in videos that shows when and where it was shot. Just communicating with people in Gaza is hard. Digital connections are patchy. It took several days for the story of Abdullah to be sent to London after it was filmed. </p><p>Connectivity out of Gaza is often weak or non-existent, as Israel has bombed mobile phone masts and internet hubs. The current Israeli offensive in Gaza made movement difficult and highly dangerous. One of the filmmakers we worked with in Gaza City went quiet for a few days while they moved their family somewhere they hoped might be safer.</p><p>We also asked for permission to film at the GHF sites but were refused.</p><p>Reporting from a distance is not the way we want to work. But given the constraints imposed by Israel, we believe we have found the best obtainable way to tell the story of how Gazans live and die.</p></div><figure><div><p><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20250905-110137-f27f908f49-web-2.29.1-3/grey-placeholder.png\" /><img srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/be06/live/b1716bb0-9863-11f0-858a-a904eacbef23.jpg.webp 240w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/be06/live/b1716bb0-9863-11f0-858a-a904eacbef23.jpg.webp 320w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/be06/live/b1716bb0-9863-11f0-858a-a904eacbef23.jpg.webp 480w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/be06/live/b1716bb0-9863-11f0-858a-a904eacbef23.jpg.webp 640w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/be06/live/b1716bb0-9863-11f0-858a-a904eacbef23.jpg.webp 800w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/be06/live/b1716bb0-9863-11f0-858a-a904eacbef23.jpg.webp 1024w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/be06/live/b1716bb0-9863-11f0-858a-a904eacbef23.jpg.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/be06/live/b1716bb0-9863-11f0-858a-a904eacbef23.jpg.webp\" alt=\"Picture of Reem, who is looking to the side of the camera.

He was also looking for food, more plentiful then but still dangerous to venture out to get it as Israel invaded and pummelled Gaza. </p><p>She was interviewed in a tent in Gaza City. We have not been able to contact her in the past week or so. We believe Reem might have taken her two children south from Gaza City to escape the ferocious offensive Israel has launched to capture the area. If so, it would be the sixth time they have been displaced. Most of Gaza's more than two million civilians have been displaced many times.</p><p>One way of getting information when physically you are not there to see it for yourself is to talk to witnesses. I interviewed an NHS doctor just back from Gaza called Tawfik Omar, who is a vascular surgeon in Coventry. Tawfik is from Egypt and spoke at length to patients and their families in Gaza. Vascular surgeons see a lot of blood. Tawfik was shocked in Gaza by an overpowering smell of blood in hospitals packed with the dead and dying who had been shot near aid sites.</p><p>\"The local people coming from the GHF points,\" he told me, \"are saying clearly that we can see the GHF security guards or the IDF personnel shooting directly at the crowds.\"</p><p>Dying for Food features two whistleblowers, who didn't want to be identified. One was a lorry driver for a GHF logistics subcontractor. We called him \"John\" and hid his identity because he is worried that his safety might be compromised if it was known that he had spoken out. He told me that another potential whistleblower had been silenced by threats from former colleagues.</p><p>There are only three GHF aid points, compared to 400 that existed when the UN was distributing aid. John told us they felt like military bases on the front line, not places where humanitarian aid was given to those who need it. He told us that every night he did his work, it was with the background of heavy gunfire. John was so shocked by what he saw that he secretly recorded videos with his mobile.</p></div><p></p><figcaption>Watch: Whistleblower's secret recordings of gunfire near GHF aid sites</figcaption><p></p><div><p>His videos were part of the material we used to establish a pattern of the IDF's use of live fire to control crowds, an intrinsically lethal technique. On a day when more than 20 people were killed near the single GHF aid site in central Gaza, we were able to use John's video taken that night to help establish what was happening.</p><p>It shows heavy fire coming from an IDF position just behind site four. The bullets were hitting an area where we established that hungry people, in their thousands, would often gather near a bridge over a dried-up river bed that leads to the entrance of the site.</p><p>Even though we were not physically in Gaza, our team analysed John's videos (and many others) using open-source intelligence, a way to check events and corroborate testimony by using the latest techniques and software to sort through the wealth of data and video that is available online. We spoke to five ballistics experts, and used software that analyses the sound of shooting on videos, to help establish the trajectory of bullets.</p><p>We used satellite pictures, which are no longer the sole preserve of intelligence agencies, and matched the detail they showed with the videos. Satellite pictures are available commercially and are especially valuable in the Gaza Strip, which straddles a 40-km (25-mile) stretch of the eastern Mediterranean coast where clouds are rare.</p><p>Videos shot on mobiles carry metadata, which includes the digital record of the time, date and place where they were shot. We know the dates of our whistleblower's videos, but we have not revealed them to help John stay anonymous.</p><p>The data on the number of deaths at GHF sites comes from a body called Armed Conflict Location and Event Data (ACLED). It collects and analyses data from warzones and is funded, among others, by the United Nations, the European Union, the US and European countries including the UK.</p><p>ACLED's data shows that since the GHF began its operations, at least 1,300 Palestinians have been killed at, or around, its sites, mostly by IDF fire. Across Gaza, Palestinians were being killed seeking aid in the year before GHF arrived at an average rate of 30 per month. Since its sites opened, that has risen to 500.</p><p>The IDF denies the killing. It told us that it is \"not aware of hundreds of fatalities caused by… [its] …forces at distribution points.\" It says these figures are \"inflated and false\".</p></div><figure><div><p><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20250905-110137-f27f908f49-web-2.29.1-3/grey-placeholder.png\" /><img srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/1ad8/live/02913500-98a2-11f0-af62-91486a511a31.jpg.webp 240w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/1ad8/live/02913500-98a2-11f0-af62-91486a511a31.jpg.webp 320w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/1ad8/live/02913500-98a2-11f0-af62-91486a511a31.jpg.webp 480w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/1ad8/live/02913500-98a2-11f0-af62-91486a511a31.jpg.webp 640w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/1ad8/live/02913500-98a2-11f0-af62-91486a511a31.jpg.webp 800w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/1ad8/live/02913500-98a2-11f0-af62-91486a511a31.jpg.webp 1024w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/1ad8/live/02913500-98a2-11f0-af62-91486a511a31.jpg.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/1ad8/live/02913500-98a2-11f0-af62-91486a511a31.jpg.webp\" alt=\"Reuters Picture showing people carrying aid away from a GHF food distribution site in Gaza.

The embassy directed us to the IDF, which also declined to be interviewed but provided written responses which we included in this programme and in this article.</p></div><figure><div><p><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20250905-110137-f27f908f49-web-2.29.1-3/grey-placeholder.png\" /><img srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/d643/live/0782d850-9895-11f0-858a-a904eacbef23.jpg.webp 240w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/d643/live/0782d850-9895-11f0-858a-a904eacbef23.jpg.webp 320w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/d643/live/0782d850-9895-11f0-858a-a904eacbef23.jpg.webp 480w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/d643/live/0782d850-9895-11f0-858a-a904eacbef23.jpg.webp 640w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/d643/live/0782d850-9895-11f0-858a-a904eacbef23.jpg.webp 800w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/d643/live/0782d850-9895-11f0-858a-a904eacbef23.jpg.webp 1024w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/d643/live/0782d850-9895-11f0-858a-a904eacbef23.jpg.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/d643/live/0782d850-9895-11f0-858a-a904eacbef23.jpg.webp\" alt=\"Reuters Image showing a road running next to a sandy beach, showing the sea.

Peace is not even a distant dream. The war that started with the attacks led by Hamas on 7 October 2023 is as significant a moment in the history of the conflict as the ones in 1948, when Israel fought and won its independence, and 1967, when it captured and occupied the West Bank, including East Jerusalem and the Gaza Strip, giving it full control of the land.</p><p>The Gaza war has stripped the conflict to its essentials. European allies that gave Israel strong support after 7 October 2023, have decided that the only way to try to offer a better way ahead than perpetual war is to recognise an independent Palestine, which the UK, France and others have done this week at the UN General Assembly in New York.</p><p>Israel and its supporters, led by the US, have condemned the move as a reward for Hamas terrorism. The counter argument to that is that the best way of ending armed attacks on Israelis is to create the conditions for Palestinian independence and allow Palestinians to set up a state in Gaza, the West Bank, including a capital in East Jerusalem. The occupation of Palestinian land is illegal under international law according to the International Court of Justice.</p><p>The determined opposition of Israel, backed by the US, makes the vision of a Palestinian state remote. So does the presence of more than 700,000 Jewish settlers in the West Bank, including East Jerusalem, on land the UK and others now call the state of Palestine. But Britain's Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer and France's President Emmanuel Macron argue they have to act now to try to keep alive the hope of peace through the two-state solution. If Israel does not accept Palestinian independence, it will find itself even more isolated for ruling over millions of people and denying them political rights.</p><p>The current offensive is aimed at forcing up to one million people out of Gaza City. It suits the plan pushed by Benjamin Netanyahu's hardline allies to seize the Gaza Strip for Jewish settlers - and force Palestinians out.  One extremist leader in the Israeli cabinet predicted a real estate bonanza.</p><p>There is strong evidence of war crimes on both sides.  Hamas committed war crimes when it broke through Israel's border defences two years ago, and in the months that followed when it still had the capacity to fire barrages of missiles at Israeli towns. Holding hostages in appalling conditions and threatening their lives is also a crime.</p><p>Israel faces accusations of a genocidal attack on Gaza's Palestinians, not just with bullets and high explosive, but by using food as a weapon of war. The IPC, the world body that assesses food emergencies, says famine caused by the Israeli blockade of Gaza is present and spreading. If it is proved that Israel is committing acts with the intent to destroy Gaza's Palestinians as a group, in whole or in part, then genocide will be added to the list of war crimes that the whistleblower John - and many others - say that they have witnessed.</p><p>Israel says it has the most moral army in the world, has not committed war crimes, and is fighting a just war in the defence of its citizens. Benjamin Netanyahu insists the current offensive aimed at capturing Gaza City will deliver the elusive total victory over Hamas that he has promised repeatedly. He also insists it will rescue the Israeli hostages still in Gaza.</p><p>The UK says the IDF assault on Gaza is utterly reckless and appalling. The Foreign Secretary, Yvette Cooper, posted: \"It will only bring more bloodshed, kill more innocent civilians and endanger the remaining hostages. We need an immediate ceasefire, all hostages released, unrestricted humanitarian aid and a path to lasting peace.\"</p><p>When, in August, the IPC published its report saying that famine had spread to Gaza City, Israel was planning one of the biggest offensives of the war to capture the city and force about a million civilians to flee south.</p><p>Israel was open about its plans, which prompted a warning about the prospects for September from the IPC. It said that intensified military action, and the forced relocation of already fragile civilian populations would make the famine in Gaza \"significantly more severe\".</p><p>That is now the risk.</p></div></article>"

    "body": "<div><p>Australia's national broadcaster has been ordered to pay A$150,000 (£73,435;  $99,200) in penalties for unfairly sacking a presenter over a social media post about the war in Gaza.</p><p>The Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC) took fill-in radio host Antoinette Lattouf off air in December 2023 due to her political views and after lobbying from pro-Israel groups, the Federal Court found earlier this year.</p><p>Lattouf has already been awarded A$70,000 in damages, but on Wednesday Justice Darryl Rangiah said the \"substantial\" extra sum was needed to ensure the ABC learned its lesson.</p><p>The broadcaster has publicly apologised to Lattouf, saying it also failed its staff and audiences.</p></div><div><p>Lattouf's dismissal triggered a wave of public outrage and created turmoil at the ABC - raising questions over its independence and reviving concerns over how it supports employees, particularly those who are culturally diverse.</p><p>\"The ABC let down the Australian public badly when it abjectly surrendered the rights of its employee... to appease a lobby group,\" Justice Rangiah said on Wednesday.</p><p>\"The public scrutiny the ABC has faced must surely have brought home to the ABC the unacceptability of its contravening conduct. Nevertheless, I consider that substantial penalties are necessary to ensure that the message is received and heeded.\"</p><p>Lattouf has been a regular contributor in Australian media for years, but also made a name for herself as an activist on issues like racism, discrimination in media and mental health.</p><p>She was hired for a week-long stint on ABC Radio Sydney's Mornings show, but after three shifts was told to pack up her things. The decision to remove her from the airwaves was promptly leaked to the media. </p><p>Hours earlier, Lattouf had shared a post from Human Rights Watch (HRW) that accused Israel of using starvation as a tool of war, an allegation that Israel denies but which <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cx88l499vero\">the International Criminal Court now says it has \"reasonable grounds\" to believe</a>.</p><p>The ABC argued at trial that Lattouf had been instructed not to talk about the war on social media, and that her post breached the broadcaster's editorial policy.</p><p>But in his initial judgement Justice Rangiah found that she was never given a direction not to post. While her Instagram story was \"ill-advised\", he said, Lattouf was fired with \"no more than a suspicion\" that she \"may\" have breached some policy or guideline and given no opportunity to defend herself. </p><p>There was a clear \"orchestrated\" campaign by pro-Israel lobbyists to have Lattouf taken off air right from the outset of her employment,<b> </b>and she was \"sacrificed\" by ABC management in a bid to mitigate the criticism, Justice Rangiah said on Wednesday.</p><p>\"The ABC and others cannot be allowed to regard a penalty as an acceptable price to pay for staving off criticism.\"</p><p>He said while the ABC has displayed some contrition - including through the public apology - their failure to investigate who leaked Lattouf's sacking to the media detracts from that.</p><p>The saga had caused \"very significant consequences\" for Lattouf, he said, ordering that the sum be paid to her within 28 days.</p></div>"

I just don't think it's fair.\"</p><p>But she felt she had no choice: \"Being able to afford running a home, it's just insane,\" she says.</p><p>\"When I first moved in I did have some savings ready, by the time we'd moved out they'd gone.\"</p><p>\"I'd say the main problems were the utilities, council tax, and rent,\" she says.</p></div><p></p><h2>Adults living with parents</h2><p></p><div><p>In 2011, there were 4.2m adults living with parents while not in education or caring for a relative. By 2021 that figure had risen to 4.9m, according to the Office for National Statistics.</p><p>Skipton Group commissioned research for its biannual<b> </b>Home Affordability Index, compiled by Oxford Economics. </p><p>It uses Office for National Statistics and house price data alongside a survey of 2,000 adults who are living with their parents to help understand why.</p></div><div><p>The data shared exclusively with the BBC suggested nearly 98% of adults living with their parents could not afford to pay what the average first-time buyer pays for a house in their area. </p><p>Even if they could afford a deposit, nine in 10 would face mortgage or rent payments, council tax, utility bills, insurance and maintenance costs that would use up nearly half of their income. If they bought a flat, that figure falls to eight in 10.</p><p>These calculations are based on one person buying alone and in the same local authority as their parents.</p><p>Stuart Haire,<b> </b>chief executive of the Skipton Group, says many young people move out nearby to stay close to their workplaces and friendship networks.</p><p>\"My heart goes out to them. I think it's a lost opportunity, and one that we really need to address,\" he says.</p><p>The report also highlights the financial impact for parents, as there can be a significant loss of income if parents can't move to a smaller property because older children are still living at home. </p></div><p></p><h2>Same costs on lower wages</h2><p></p><div><p>The trade body representing estate agents - Propertymark - said that rising living costs are \"becoming financially testing for many people, especially those working out their finances to step onto the housing ladder for the first time.\"</p><p>It said society needed to \"recognise that the costs associated with the first few years of home ownership come at a greater cost compared to those who run an existing home.\"</p><p>This group are facing the same jumps in utility, insurance, mortgage, rent and maintenance costs, but trying to cover them on significantly lower wages.</p></div><div><p>Right now, Leoni says she and her boyfriend will be living at home for the foreseeable future. They are saving again - but this time for a deposit to buy their own place - as well as enough to cover costs.</p><p>\"I'm saving for the money that I'll need to do the place up. I'm saving for furniture. I'm saving for bills, and I'm saving for an emergency fund,\" she says.</p><p>Dan Wilson Craw, deputy chief executive, of Generation Rent, says while many people would enjoy living with parents a lack of housing options can make starting a career or a relationship more difficult.</p><p>\"To fix this we need to build more social homes to allow people on lower incomes to fly the nest, and homes of all kinds in the places where jobs are being created,\" he says.</p><p>The government says increasing the minimum wage is helping, but that \"a generation of young people are locked out of homeownership... we're turning this crisis around by... building the 1.5 million homes this country needs.\"</p></div><figure><div><p><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20250905-110137-f27f908f49-web-2.29.1-3/grey-placeholder.png\" /><img srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/7e50/live/a7710080-98c7-11f0-928c-71dbb8619e94.png.webp 240w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/7e50/live/a7710080-98c7-11f0-928c-71dbb8619e94.png.webp 320w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/7e50/live/a7710080-98c7-11f0-928c-71dbb8619e94.png.webp 480w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/7e50/live/a7710080-98c7-11f0-928c-71dbb8619e94.png.webp 640w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/7e50/live/a7710080-98c7-11f0-928c-71dbb8619e94.png.webp 800w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/7e50/live/a7710080-98c7-11f0-928c-71dbb8619e94.png.webp 1024w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/7e50/live/a7710080-98c7-11f0-928c-71dbb8619e94.png.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/7e50/live/a7710080-98c7-11f0-928c-71dbb8619e94.png.webp\" alt=\"A red, black and white graphic reading Cost of Living Tackling It Together with a woman filling a mug from a kettle \" /></p></div></figure><p></p><h2>Ways to afford your own place</h2><p></p><div><ul><li>Consider buying with a sibling or friend rather than just a partner.</li><li>Some lenders have products that mean you don't pay anything on your mortgage for the first couple of months to help you over the rest of your moving costs.</li><li>If you open a Lifetime ISA before you're 40, you can use it to save for a deposit.

There had been calls to cancel streaming subscriptions over Kimmel's brief suspension. </p><p>The comedian's comeback was praised by celebrity supporters, including actor Ben Stiller, who lauded his \"brilliant monologue\".</p><p>But Kimmel's return was not universally applauded. About an hour before showtime, Trump said on his social media platform that he could not believe that ABC had reinstated the comedian, saying the White House was told the show was cancelled.</p><p>\"Something happened between then and now because his audience is GONE, and his 'talent' was never there,\" Trump wrote.</p><p>Trump also threatened to \"test ABC out on this\".</p><p>Kimmel's Tuesday night guests were Twisters and Chad Powers actor Glen Powell  and musical guest Sarah McLachlan.</p><p>He was also joined by Hollywood legend and notable Trump critic Robert De Niro, who appeared in a skit in which he portrayed Carr. \"Speech, it ain't free no more,\" De Niro quipped.</p></div><div><p>The comedian's show was pulled after his 15 September monologue about the shooting of Kirk caused uproar. </p><p>He said that Trump and his allies were \"desperately trying to characterise this kid who murdered Charlie Kirk as anything other than one of them\" and trying to \"score political points from it\".</p><p>He also likened Trump's reaction to the influencer's murder to \"how a four-year-old mourns a goldfish\".</p><p>The jokes raised the ire of Carr, who said Kimmel was \"appearing to directly mislead the American public\" with his comments about Kirk's killer.</p><p>The FCC regulates radio, TV and satellite airwaves, giving it power over a range of matters, including mergers and decency complaints.</p><p>His remarks, coupled with concerns from local broadcasters that run ABC affiliates, prompted the network to \"indefinitely\" suspend Kimmel's show. </p><p>The show's suspension prompted strong backlash from lawmakers, labour unions, and free speech proponents. <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c62le8q959yo\">Celebrity campaigns and boycotts</a> targeted Disney, ABC's parent company. </p><p>Kimmel was also backed by his colleagues in late night, including CBS host Stephen Colbert - whose show will end in May - Jon Stewart and Seth Meyers.</p><p>Disney made its announcement on Monday that <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c701jr01dj2o\">it would bring back the show</a> after \"having thoughtful conversations with Jimmy\".</p><p>Still, Nexstar, one of the biggest owners of TV stations in the US, said on Tuesday that it would continue to pre-empt Kimmel's show \"pending assurance that all parties are committed to fostering an environment of respectful, constructive dialogue in the markets we serve\".</p><p>The media company is currently trying to close a $6.2bn (£4.86bn) deal to acquire its rival Tegna that needs FCC approval.</p><p>Sinclair, the largest ABC affiliate group in the US, also said it would air alternate programming. </p><p>Nexstar and Sinclair together control more than 20% of ABC's affiliated television stations, according to the New York Times.</p></div>"

Even Donald is expecting a \"bear pit\" at Bethpage and the skipper has handed out virtual reality headsets to the players to replicate the abuse they are expecting.</p><p>Raucous home crowds have become a staple of Ryder Cups and while most of the partisan support is good natured, it can, occasionally cross the line.</p><p>\"It's not going to come as a shock,\" Sir Nick Faldo, a stalwart of 11 Ryder Cups, told BBC Sport. \"You're going to have to be mentally prepared for it. </p><p>\"It's going to be down to discipline - something's going to go on, something's going to be said and we're saying to Luke, could you make it a rule that nobody will crack, or over-react.</p><p>\"I think you have a secret word between you and your caddie. You turn and look and say something, have a little laugh and then he says 'right job at hand, get on with it'. Get the golfer to click back in. This is a great golf course, we've got to play a great shot, that will keep you 100% focused.\"</p><p>It's not easy to block out though.</p><p>Colin Montgomerie was subjected to such bad abuse at Brookline in 1999 that his late father was forced to walk away from his singles match against then US Open champion Payne Stewart.</p><p>The Scot was leading by three holes when \"things changed on the ninth tee\".</p><p>\"It got ugly, somebody shouted out and didn't allow me to hit my tee shot,\" he recalled.</p><p>\"I turned round to the crowd and said if this happens again, or I'm not allowed to play, then unfortunately I'll have to walk in. </p><p>\"I was shaking at the time, I'm feeling it now talking about it. This is a game of golf.\"</p><p>Despite his own reaction, Montgomerie echoed Faldo's thoughts on focusing on the task ahead and how crucial a fast start could be.</p><p>\"Friday is massive for Europe,\" he said. \"If we can get ahead and stay ahead, you'll probably find the American hostility could be directed at their own players.\"</p><p>Justin Rose, who will make his seventh appearance for Europe this week, has direct experience of that from 2012, when Europe mounted an epic final-day comeback at Medinah.</p><p>\"The crowd in Chicago were rough and tough but for the most part the Americans had the upper hand,\" he said.</p><p>\"But as soon as we were able to flip the script, the crowd did change, they did go quiet. They didn't like it and that's going to be our goal, to pacify the crowd. </p><p>\"I don't think it's going to be easy. I don't think we should expect to pacify the crowd, that might not be possible. We've just got to be resilient as a team. </p><p>\"But Medinah proves it's possible.\"</p><p>And he believes the pressure and expectation from the home fans might be as tough for the US players to deal with.</p><p>\"It's about not letting the environment affect us,\" he said. </p><p>\"But none of us, even the Americans, will have played in that before. Obviously it will be more pro for them but at the same time it's going to be different - so if we can deal with it we've got an awesome chance to win.\"</p></div><div><figure><p><span><picture><source srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/240/cpsprodpb/228d/live/b3ab61f0-9549-11f0-9cf6-cbf3e73ce2b9.jpg.webp 240w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/320/cpsprodpb/228d/live/b3ab61f0-9549-11f0-9cf6-cbf3e73ce2b9.jpg.webp 320w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/480/cpsprodpb/228d/live/b3ab61f0-9549-11f0-9cf6-cbf3e73ce2b9.jpg.webp 480w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/624/cpsprodpb/228d/live/b3ab61f0-9549-11f0-9cf6-cbf3e73ce2b9.jpg.webp 624w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/800/cpsprodpb/228d/live/b3ab61f0-9549-11f0-9cf6-cbf3e73ce2b9.jpg.webp 800w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/976/cpsprodpb/228d/live/b3ab61f0-9549-11f0-9cf6-cbf3e73ce2b9.jpg.webp 976w\" type=\"image/webp\"></source><img alt=\"European Ryder Cup fans in among US supporters at Whistling Straits in 2021\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/1920/cpsprodpb/228d/live/b3ab61f0-9549-11f0-9cf6-cbf3e73ce2b9.jpg\" srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/240/cpsprodpb/228d/live/b3ab61f0-9549-11f0-9cf6-cbf3e73ce2b9.jpg 240w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/320/cpsprodpb/228d/live/b3ab61f0-9549-11f0-9cf6-cbf3e73ce2b9.jpg 320w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/480/cpsprodpb/228d/live/b3ab61f0-9549-11f0-9cf6-cbf3e73ce2b9.jpg 480w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/624/cpsprodpb/228d/live/b3ab61f0-9549-11f0-9cf6-cbf3e73ce2b9.jpg 624w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/800/cpsprodpb/228d/live/b3ab61f0-9549-11f0-9cf6-cbf3e73ce2b9.jpg 800w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/976/cpsprodpb/228d/live/b3ab61f0-9549-11f0-9cf6-cbf3e73ce2b9.jpg 976w\" /></picture></span><span><span>Image source, </span>Getty Images</span></p><figcaption><span>Image caption, </span><p>Nick Faldo says the players will be relying on the European fans at Bethpage to make themselves heard among the Americans</p></figcaption></figure></div><p></p><h2 id=\"Keeping-Donald-as-captain\"><span>Keeping Donald as captain</span></h2><p></p><div><p>The fans chanting \"two more years\" towards Donald at Marco Simone in Rome was one thing, but the players joining in was the rubber stamp he needed to continue.</p><p>Not since the days of Tony Jacklin through the 1980s and Bernard Gallacher in the early 1990s has the European captaincy been anything more than a one and out deal.</p><p>But Donald has the continent's golden touch. Four wins out of four as a player - with two of those on American soil. One out of one as skipper.</p><p>Crucially, he was on the last team to win away, and set the tone for Sunday's singles in 2012 by going out first and defeating Bubba Watson to spark the record turnaround from 10-6 down.</p><p>And that experience and nous will be needed to deal with some of the feistiest fans in American sport and home players desperate to regain the trophy.</p><p>\"This is a different challenge,\" he said. \"I am aware we have lost three of the past four away Ryder Cups by significant margins. Some of our advantages from Rome are certainly not advantages anymore.</p><p>\"A lot of my thinking revolves around crowd management and how we react as a team.</p><p>\"In terms of communication, to get my messaging across, that process started 15 months ago. Hopefully they will see some good results.\"</p><p>Rose, who is seeking a fifth Ryder Cup win, was a team-mate of Donald's in 2012. </p><p>The Englishman told BBC South: \"Luke has a plan. The messaging has been consistent. He's not adding to the noise and keeping it as simple as possible for us. </p><p>\"I haven't felt like anything going differently and that's probably the genius of what Luke's been doing.\"</p></div><p></p><h2 id=\"Stability-is-key\"><span>Stability is key</span></h2><p></p><div><p>This is the 45th edition of the biennial contest and the visitors have made fewer alterations to their team than in any previous contest in the 98-year history of the event.</p><p>As Europe, the next fewest number of changes was three in 1985, 1987 and 2006 - and all three ended in victories.</p><p>Dane Rasmus Hojgaard, who was embedded with the team in Rome, is the solitary change, replacing his twin brother Nicolai, having qualified for his debut through the ranking system.</p><p>Montgomerie, who led the side to victory in 2010 and won five out of eight as a player, joked on BBC Radio 5 Live's Ryder Cup preview programme: \"With all due respect Rasmus and Nicolai are the same person really. They shared the same egg, so we have the same team and that's huge.\"</p><p>With Donald looking to emulate Jacklin as the only captain to win home and away matches and cement his place alongside Europe's greats, he opted not to include any rookies in his six selections.</p><p>\"If I was coming into a home Ryder Cup I'd be comfortable with a few rookies, next generation coming through, which is what happened in Rome,\" said Rose.</p><p>\"There is still tons of pressure, don't get me wrong, but I'm really happy the boys have experienced a Ryder Cup and they know what to expect in terms of the rhythm and flow of the week and the emotion.\"</p><p>And you can understand Donald's thinking, of seeking to take a settled community into what Montgomerie has called a \"cauldron\".</p><p>\"It's important we have a good amount of experience in that team room with people that have dealt with it,\" said Donald.</p><p>Faldo, who amassed 25 points from 11 appearances, second only to Sergio Garcia's 28.5 - added: \"Your big guys have got to do the heavy lifting. </p><p>\"You need half the team playing great, winning the point and hope one or two others have a great period. If you can get close to 10 points out of the first two days, you only need four out of 12 in the singles. That's the gameplan.\"</p><p>Faldo was talking about the likes of Rory McIlroy, Tommy Fleetwood, Jon Rahm, Tyrrell Hatton and Rose, who have all won more than 50% of the points they have contested.</p><p>Major winners McIlroy (18 points) and Rose (15.5) also bring seasoned know-how, having been in the victorious 2012 side alongside Donald.</p><p>Fleetwood broke his PGA Tour duck by winning the season-ending Tour Championship last month, while Rahm was crowned LIV Golf's individual player of the year for a second time. </p><p>Hatton's major performances meant he claimed an automatic place despite also playing on the Saudi circuit and having limited qualification opportunities.</p><p>Robert MacIntyre, an inspired wildcard pick in Rome who has qualified this time round, could be added to that quintet given his performances since then.</p><p>After going unbeaten on his Ryder Cup debut, he has won the Scottish and Canadian Open titles - as well as finishing runner-up at the US Open in June.</p><p>Rahm needed a wildcard pick, as did Viktor Hovland and Ludvig Aberg, who impressed as a pairing in Rome with two wins from three matches.</p><p>Donald has also put his faith in Shane Lowry and Sepp Straka - who won one and lost one of their two outings together in 2023 - and Matt Fitzpatrick, despite his poor record of one point in three appearances, two of which were heavy away defeats in 2016 and 2021. </p><p>\"They've had a dry run and made it work, they know the pairings,\" said Europe's first Ryder Cup-winning captain Jacklin.</p><p>\"You don't go in there complacent. The antennae is up and you're looking for weakness but I can't see anything other than a European win.\"</p></div><p></p><h2 id=\"Scheffler-aside-there-is-nobody-to-fear\"><span>'Scheffler aside, there is nobody to fear'</span></h2><p></p><div><figure><p><span><picture><source srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/240/cpsprodpb/9129/live/614bb940-9545-11f0-a49e-490ea541d65b.jpg.webp 240w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/320/cpsprodpb/9129/live/614bb940-9545-11f0-a49e-490ea541d65b.jpg.webp 320w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/480/cpsprodpb/9129/live/614bb940-9545-11f0-a49e-490ea541d65b.jpg.webp 480w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/624/cpsprodpb/9129/live/614bb940-9545-11f0-a49e-490ea541d65b.jpg.webp 624w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/800/cpsprodpb/9129/live/614bb940-9545-11f0-a49e-490ea541d65b.jpg.webp 800w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/976/cpsprodpb/9129/live/614bb940-9545-11f0-a49e-490ea541d65b.jpg.webp 976w\" type=\"image/webp\"></source><img alt=\"Bryson DeChambeau and Scottie Scheffler chest bump during their victory over Tommy Fleetwood and Viktor Hovland at Whistling Straits in 2021.\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/3840/cpsprodpb/9129/live/614bb940-9545-11f0-a49e-490ea541d65b.jpg\" srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/240/cpsprodpb/9129/live/614bb940-9545-11f0-a49e-490ea541d65b.jpg 240w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/320/cpsprodpb/9129/live/614bb940-9545-11f0-a49e-490ea541d65b.jpg 320w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/480/cpsprodpb/9129/live/614bb940-9545-11f0-a49e-490ea541d65b.jpg 480w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/624/cpsprodpb/9129/live/614bb940-9545-11f0-a49e-490ea541d65b.jpg 624w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/800/cpsprodpb/9129/live/614bb940-9545-11f0-a49e-490ea541d65b.jpg 800w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/976/cpsprodpb/9129/live/614bb940-9545-11f0-a49e-490ea541d65b.jpg 976w\" /></picture></span><span><span>Image source, </span>Getty Images</span></p><figcaption><span>Image caption, </span><p>DeChambeau and Scheffler each won 2½ points in 2021 at Whistling Straits</p></figcaption></figure></div><div><p>The American team is headed by the game's standout talent in Scottie Scheffler.

There's nobody in the team that any of our guys will look at [and fear].\"</p><p>A rib injury meant Schauffele had a slow start to the year and while the winner of two majors in 2024 had top-10 finishes at the Masters and Open Championship, an inconsistent season meant he missed the Tour Championship for the first time in nine years.</p><p>Justin Thomas and Patrick Cantlay may have something to say about Faldo's comments though, given they have the best Ryder Cup records on the US team.</p><p>Thomas, who has eight points from 13 matches, was chief cheerleader in 2021, firing up the fans by downing a celebratory beer before slamming the can on the first tee at Whistling Straits - and that was on the Saturday after just three of the five playing sessions.</p><p>Cantlay was the pantomime villain in Rome with 'cap-gate' and his caddie's spat with McIlroy. But he has won five of his eight matches and ground out a gnarly singles win over Rose. </p><p>Both were given wildcard picks by captain Keegan Bradley, as was two-time major winner Collin Morikawa, who has been out of sorts since two early-season runners-up finishes.</p><p>The skipper also selected newcomers Ben Griffin and Cameron Young - both won on the PGA Tour in 2025 - as he opted to leave himself out.</p><p>Bradley's 'will he, won't he' be a playing captain dilemma dominated the build-up and the world number 12 would likely have been in the team had he not been skipper.</p><p>Like Europe two years ago, the home side is blooding four rookies, with US Open champion JJ Spaun - who was beaten to the prestigious Players Championship in March by McIlroy - and Tour Championship runner-up Russell Henley having qualified. </p><p>Harris English and Sam Burns, who have both played in just one Ryder Cup, complete a relatively inexperienced US line-up with just 15 appearances between them, compared to Europe's 32.</p></div><p></p><h2 id=\"Europe-due-an-away-win\"><span>Europe due an away win</span></h2><p></p><div><figure><p><span><picture><source srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/240/cpsprodpb/ef5a/live/443fec00-9544-11f0-a49e-490ea541d65b.jpg.webp 240w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/320/cpsprodpb/ef5a/live/443fec00-9544-11f0-a49e-490ea541d65b.jpg.webp 320w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/480/cpsprodpb/ef5a/live/443fec00-9544-11f0-a49e-490ea541d65b.jpg.webp 480w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/624/cpsprodpb/ef5a/live/443fec00-9544-11f0-a49e-490ea541d65b.jpg.webp 624w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/800/cpsprodpb/ef5a/live/443fec00-9544-11f0-a49e-490ea541d65b.jpg.webp 800w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/976/cpsprodpb/ef5a/live/443fec00-9544-11f0-a49e-490ea541d65b.jpg.webp 976w\" type=\"image/webp\"></source><img alt=\"Justin Rose and Rory McIlroy shake hands during the 2012 Ryder Cup at Medinah that Europe came from 10-6 down on the final day to win.\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/3840/cpsprodpb/ef5a/live/443fec00-9544-11f0-a49e-490ea541d65b.jpg\" srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/240/cpsprodpb/ef5a/live/443fec00-9544-11f0-a49e-490ea541d65b.jpg 240w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/320/cpsprodpb/ef5a/live/443fec00-9544-11f0-a49e-490ea541d65b.jpg 320w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/480/cpsprodpb/ef5a/live/443fec00-9544-11f0-a49e-490ea541d65b.jpg 480w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/624/cpsprodpb/ef5a/live/443fec00-9544-11f0-a49e-490ea541d65b.jpg 624w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/800/cpsprodpb/ef5a/live/443fec00-9544-11f0-a49e-490ea541d65b.jpg 800w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/976/cpsprodpb/ef5a/live/443fec00-9544-11f0-a49e-490ea541d65b.jpg 976w\" /></picture></span><span><span>Image source, </span>Getty Images</span></p><figcaption><span>Image caption, </span><p>Rose and McIlroy both won their singles matches at Medinah in 2012 and are the only two Europeans to be in this year's side as well</p></figcaption></figure></div><div><p>Since Jacklin's dozen sneaked home in Ohio 38 years ago, Europe have won away once in every decade - 2012, 2004, 1995 and that all-important first one in 1987.</p><p>The US have only beaten Europe away in 1981 and 1993.

In North Wales and Merseyside, the cost will be nearly 70p a day for electricity, for example.</p><p>Ofgem has been considering how to change the bill payments system after widespread concern from households.</p><p>When bills were at a peak in the winter of 2022, many people slashed their energy use but still had to pay the standing charge element of the bill, regardless of how much gas or electricity was used.</p><p>While Ofgem's plans will enable customers to take up a deal where standing charges are lower, the savings are likely to be limited due to such tariffs having higher rates for energy usage.</p><p>\"Plans to offer a lower standing charge may provide more choice to consumers, but won't bring down people's bills,\" said Gillian Cooper, director of energy at Citizens Advice.</p><p>Ofgem said costs covered by standing charges must be paid somehow, and so has said it could only move them to another part of the bill. </p><p>The announcement of the plans comes as energy bills for millions of people on tariffs which vary with Ofgem's price cap are rising by 2% in October.</p><p>Rising standing charges are part of that, with the fees typically rising by 4% for electricity and 14% for gas.</p></div><p></p><h2>'More choice'</h2><p></p><div><p>\"We have carefully considered how we can offer more choice on how they pay these fixed costs, however we have taken care to ensure we don't make some customers worse off,\" said Tim Jarvis, from Ofgem.</p><p>The regulator's latest proposals are less radical than previously considered, and it  would also require tariffs to have a minimum usage level.</p><p>Under its plans, now subject to consultation:</p><ul><li>All suppliers in England, Scotland and Wales must offer a low standing charge tariff to customers. Some providers already offer this as an option, but it would be universal</li><li>All billpayers will have the choice to move to such a tariff by the end of January </li><li>The new tariffs will be available to customers irrespective of how they pay their bill, such as by direct debit or quarterly on demand</li></ul><p>\"The costs covered by the standing charge ultimately must be paid. We cannot remove these charges, we can only move costs around,\" added Mr Jarvis. </p><p>\"These changes would give households the choice they have asked for, but it's important that everyone carefully considers what's right for them as these tariffs are unlikely to reduce bills on their own.\"</p><p>People who cut their energy use should see a bigger reduction in bills than would be the case without these changes, he said.</p><p>Suppliers will be able to decide whether to also offer zero standing charge tariffs, with much higher unit rates.</p></div><p></p><h2>Rising cost</h2><p></p><div><p>Many charities say that rather than shifting the fee onto another part of the bill, more should be done to help those struggling to pay.</p><p>\"With October's price hike just around the corner, lower standing charge tariffs will not help the millions of households bracing themselves for yet another winter of unaffordable energy bills,\" said Ms Copper, of Citizen Advice.</p><p>Campaigners are also concerned that more tariffs could create greater confusion. </p><p>Dhara Vyas, from Energy UK, which represents suppliers, said it was hard to see how the move warranted the potential cost and disruption.</p><p>\"Ofgem admits [this] will only be temporary and merely move costs around on the bill, so delivering a limited benefit to customers,\" she said.</p><p>The plans will now go to consultation before a final decision is made.</p></div></article>"

    "body": "<article><div><div><p>13 hours ago</p></div><p><span><p><span>James Landale</span><span>Diplomatic correspondent, New York</span></p></span></p></div><p></p><figcaption>From escalators to teleprompters, Trump piles on criticism at the UN</figcaption><p></p><div><p>Donald Trump's speech to the United Nations was one of the clearest expositions of the way he sees the world, his ideology in its rawest form. </p><p>To his supporters, it will be seen as Trumpism unplugged - to his critics, Trumpism unhinged.</p><p>Over almost an hour, he took aim at his opponents and their ideas, picking them off one by one as he toured the world. He began at home, praising the United States and himself. He said the US was living through a golden age and repeated his much-disputed claim that he had personally ended seven wars, something he argued merited a Nobel Peace Prize.</p><p>But then the president laid into his hosts. The UN, he said, had not helped his peace-making. He questioned the organisation's purpose, saying it had tremendous potential but was not living up to that. All it did, he claimed, was write strongly-worded letters that it did not follow up. Empty words, he said, did not end wars. </p><p>He also attacked the UN for the aid it gave to asylum seekers hoping to enter the US, saying: \"The UN is supposed to stop invasions, not create them and not finance them.\" The president even attacked the UN for a broken escalator and teleprompter that disrupted his visit and speech.</p><p>On one level, he has a point. Many analysts question the effectiveness of the UN in resolving conflict these days, pointing in particular to gridlock in the Security Council and the body's unresponsive bureaucracy. </p></div><div><p>But on another level, Trump can himself be seen as both a cause and symptom of the UN's lack of effectiveness - for he believes global crises are best resolved by powerful men like him getting together and hammering out a deal, not using multilateral bodies like the UN to work out collective solutions. Under Trump, the US has withdrawn much of its UN funding, leaving the body forced to cut its humanitarian work around the world.</p><p>Trump saved perhaps his biggest criticism for his European allies, attacking the continent for investing in renewable energy, and opening its borders to migration. </p><p>\"Europe is in serious trouble. They have been invaded by a force of illegal aliens like nobody has ever seen before… Both the immigration and suicidal energy ideas will be the death of Western Europe,\" he said.</p><p>Climate change, he claimed to audible gasps, was \"the greatest con job ever perpetrated on the world\" and was lumbering European countries with expensive energy costs compared to fossil fuels. He criticised in particular the UK government for imposing new taxes on North Sea oil.</p><p>\"If you don't get away from the green energy scam, your country is going to fail,\" he said.</p><p>\"I love Europe. I love the people of Europe. And I hate to see it being devastated by energy and immigration. This double-tailed monster destroys everything in its wake… you want to be politically correct and you are destroying your heritage.\"</p><p>Note that last point. It echoes what the president said during his state visit to the UK last week when he spoke of the importance of defending the values of what he called \"the English-speaking world\". </p></div><p></p><figcaption>Watch: How Trump lashed out at Europe in his UN speech</figcaption><p></p><div><p>There is a cultural edge to Trump's criticism of Europe, a sense that he believes uncontrolled immigration is threatening what he sees as Europe's Judeo-Christian heritage. Not for nothing is Trump the leader of an administration that wears its religion firmly on its sleeve. \"Let us protect religious liberty,\" he told the UN, \"including for the most persecuted religion on the planet today – it's called Christianity.\"</p><p>On a specific point of policy, the most substantive warning Trump gave related to Russia's war on Ukraine. He said President Putin's refusal to end the conflict was \"not making Russia look good\". He said the US was prepared \"to impose a very strong round of powerful tariffs\" to end the bloodshed. But he said European nations had to stop buying Russian energy, claiming he only found out two weeks ago that some were doing so. </p><p>In practice, Hungary and Slovakia are the only substantive European buyers of Russian oil. Diplomats say Trump is hiding behind this so he does not have to impose secondary sanctions on India and China which are both buying huge amounts of cheap Russian energy, both of whom were cited by Trump.</p><p>Perhaps more important than his speech was Trump's social media post a short while later, in which he asserted for the first time that Ukraine could be in a position to <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c07vm35rryeo\">win back all of its territory</a>. </p><p>His dismissal of Russia as a \"paper tiger\" and not a \"real military power\" will hurt President Putin, who is sensitive to any suggestion his country is not a global player. Diplomats said this was the latest example of Trump's journey towards a position that is more critical of Russia.</p><p>But one should always treat Trump's words with a pinch of salt. He was being optimistic only moments after meeting Ukraine's President Zelensky at the UN. </p><p>And he said Ukraine could win back territory with EU and Nato support - there was no mention of US involvement. All the evidence of the last few years is that this is a war of slow attrition, and Ukraine would not retake land from Russia without massive US military support.</p><p>So this was undiluted Trump - a defence of America and the nation state, an assault on multilateralism and globalism, a stream of consciousness with questionable assertions. </p><p>Six years ago, Trump's audience at the UN laughed at his at times non-factual assertions; this year they listened largely in silence. </p><p>\"I am really good at this stuff,\" he told world leaders. \"Your countries are going to hell.\"</p></div></article>"

Russia launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022.</p><p>Trump said his position had changed \"after getting to know and fully understand the Ukraine/Russia military and economic situation\".</p><p>\"Putin and Russia are in BIG Economic trouble, and this is the time for Ukraine to act,\" he added, labelling Russia as a \"paper tiger\".</p><p>Zelensky hailed the \"big shift\" in Trump's position, and speaking to reporters in the UN building, said he understood the US was willing to give Ukraine security guarantees \"after the war is finished\".</p><p>Pressed on what this would look like, he added: \"I don't want to lie, we don't have specific details,\" but broached the possibility of more weapons, air defences and drones.</p></div><div><p>Speaking later on Fox News, Zelensky said that Trump's Truth Social post about Ukraine's positioning surprised him but he took it as a \"positive signal\" that Trump and the US \"will be with us to the end of the war\". </p><p>\"I think the fact that Putin was lying to President Trump so many times also made a difference between us,\" he told Fox host Bret Baier.</p></div><div><p>Earlier on Tuesday, following his speech to the UN, Trump also said Nato nations should shoot down Russian planes breaching their airspace, following a series of recent incursions by Russian fighter jets and drones.</p><p>Last week, Estonia and Poland requested a consultation with other Nato members after Russia violated its airspace in separate incidents. Romania, another Nato member, also said Russian drones breached its airspace.</p><p>After meeting on Tuesday, Nato issued a statement condemning Russia's actions and warned that it would use \"all necessary military and non-military tools\" to defend itself.</p><p>\"Russia bears full responsibility for these actions, which are escalatory, risk miscalculation and endanger lives. They must stop,\" it said.</p><p>The alliance added that Moscow's actions were part of a \"pattern of increasingly irresponsible\" behaviour.</p><p>Nato's secretary general Mark Rutte said: \"We are a defensive alliance, yes, but we are not naive, so we see what is happening.\"</p><p>Speaking at the UN, Poland's president Karol Nawrocki echoed those comments, saying his country was prepared to \"defend its territory\" and \"react adequately\".</p><p>\"Polish people, as well as countries of Central and Eastern Europe, will not be scared of Russian drones,\" he said.</p><p>Russia denied violating Estonia's airspace, while it insisted the Polish incursion was not deliberate and did not comment on the Romania incident.</p><p>Asked if the US would support its Nato allies if they shot down Russian aircraft, Trump said it \"depends on the circumstance\" and praised the military alliance for increasing defence spending.</p><p>\"Nato has stepped up,\" he said, referring to an agreement by leaders to <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cj4en8djwyko\">ramp up defence spending</a> to 5% of their countries' economic output by 2035.</p><p>In his speech hours earlier, Trump criticised some Nato members for not ceasing the purchase of Russian energy, saying they were \"funding a war against themselves\".</p></div><figure><div><p><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20250905-110137-f27f908f49-web-2.29.1-3/grey-placeholder.png\" /><img srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/c343/live/b52eca20-9919-11f0-928c-71dbb8619e94.png.webp 240w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/c343/live/b52eca20-9919-11f0-928c-71dbb8619e94.png.webp 320w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/c343/live/b52eca20-9919-11f0-928c-71dbb8619e94.png.webp 480w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/c343/live/b52eca20-9919-11f0-928c-71dbb8619e94.png.webp 640w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/c343/live/b52eca20-9919-11f0-928c-71dbb8619e94.png.webp 800w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/c343/live/b52eca20-9919-11f0-928c-71dbb8619e94.png.webp 1024w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/c343/live/b52eca20-9919-11f0-928c-71dbb8619e94.png.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/c343/live/b52eca20-9919-11f0-928c-71dbb8619e94.png.webp\" alt=\"Map of Ukraine showing regions under Russian military control shaded red, limited control in red stripes, and claimed control shaded yellow as of 23 September.
