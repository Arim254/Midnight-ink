You've got to figure them out,\" one officer said.</p><p>After the BBC sent a detailed list of allegations to the Met, it suspended eight officers and one staff member, and took two more officers off front-line duties. Commissioner Sir Mark Rowley said the behaviour outlined by Panorama was, \"disgraceful, totally unacceptable and contrary to the values and standards\" of the force.</p><p><i><b>Warning: This story contains repeated use of highly offensive and discriminatory language</b></i></p><p>Among the officers filmed by our undercover reporter were:</p></div><div><ul><li>Sgt Joe McIlvenny, an officer with nearly 20 years' service in the Met, who was dismissive about a pregnant woman's allegations of rape and domestic violence, after a colleague raised concerns about the decision to release the accused man on bail. He replied: \"That's what she says.\"</li><li>PC Martin Borg, who enthusiastically described how he saw another officer, Sgt Steve Stamp, stomp on a suspect's leg. PC Borg laughed when he described how he had offered to make a statement saying the suspect had tried to kick the sergeant first. It was unclear from CCTV footage if the claim was true.</li><li>PC Phil Neilson, who told our reporter in the pub that a detainee who had overstayed his visa should have \"a bullet through his head\" and \"ones that shag, rape women, you'd do the cock and let them bleed out\".</li></ul></div><p>BBC Panorama's undercover reporter, Rory Bibb, spent seven months up to January this year as a designated detention officer (DDO) in the custody suite of Charing Cross police station in central London. It is a civilian role which involves working closely with sergeants and constables, but not taking part in arrests.</p><div><ul><li><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cvgn0rjyn2jo\">Why BBC sent undercover reporter into a busy London police station</a></li></ul></div><p>Charing Cross has one of the Met's 22 custody suites where people are held after arrest and before they are charged or released. It is often a volatile environment where officers deal with violent people and vulnerable individuals, including young people and those with mental health issues.</p><p></p><figcaption>Off-duty, PC Phil Neilson called immigrants \"scum\"</figcaption><p></p><div><p>The station had been the focus of <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-london-60215575\">an investigation by the police watchdog, the Independent Office for Police Conduct (IOPC)</a>, into bullying and discrimination nearly four years ago. It found that some officers had discussed hitting their girlfriends, shared offensive and discriminatory comments and joked about rape in private group chats.</p><p>Whistleblowers told Panorama that officers with racist and misogynistic attitudes still worked at the station despite the Met's promise to root out \"rogue officers\" and \"cultural failings\".</p></div><p></p><h2>'Terrifying' misogyny</h2><p></p><div><p>Sergeants are in charge of the custody suite day-to-day and are responsible for upholding the Met's values and ethical standards.</p><p>One of them at Charing Cross was Sgt McIlvenny, who was repeatedly filmed while on duty displaying misogynistic attitudes.</p><p>He talked to colleagues in graphic terms about his sex life, telling the undercover reporter and a female colleague about a woman he said he met online: \"She fucking fills the door, almost like monstrous.\" He added that she was \"so fat she had two pussies. There's the real one and then the fat one round it.\"</p><p>He talked about how he got sexual pleasure from having his nipples played with, despite the objections of some female colleagues in earshot.</p><p>Discussing having his nipples pierced, he said: \"My pain tolerance goes up massively if I'm aroused at the same time. So, I'm going to ask them if I can have a wank...\"</p><p>As custody sergeant, Sgt McIlvenny is responsible for making decisions about whether a suspect is remanded in custody or given bail after being charged.</p></div><p></p><figcaption>Sgt McIlvenny described sexual encounters to colleagues</figcaption><p></p><div><p>When a female DDO questioned a decision to release on bail a man alleged to have raped his girlfriend, she pointed out he had also been accused of kicking the pregnant woman in the stomach. Sgt McIlvenny responded: \"That's what she says.\" Panorama does not have the full details of the case.</p><p>The female DDO later told the undercover reporter about her anger at the sergeant's response. \"The way he went, 'Yeah, it's what she says.' He fucking stamped on her stomach when she was pregnant,\" she said.</p><p>\"I'd like to turn round and go, 'You wanker. You're a wanker.' But, unfortunately, I can't.

Under her leadership, in 2016 Nottinghamshire Police became the first force to record misogyny as a hate crime.</p></div><div><p>In January this year, while the BBC's undercover reporter was working in the station, Sgt McIlvenny was told he was being investigated for inappropriate comments he had allegedly made to a woman in custody.</p><p>Custody staff told our undercover reporter that the woman was Asian and that Sgt McIlvenny had said to her that she should be in the \"massage business\". British Transport Police officers had reported him, the custody staff said.</p><p>But last month, before Panorama informed the Met of its findings, the sergeant told the BBC's reporter that he was back working in the custody suite.</p></div><p></p><h2>'Red mist'</h2><p></p><div><p>The BBC's undercover reporter repeatedly filmed officers revelling in the use of force, revealing a culture of confidence and trust that colleagues would not blow the whistle on them.</p><p>Police officers can use force, but only when it is \"proportionate and reasonable in all the circumstances\", according to their Standards of Professional Behaviour.</p><p>Over a few drinks in a nearby pub while off duty, PC Martin Borg described how a man arrested for impersonating a police officer and attempted kidnap, and who was judged to be a suicide risk, had been restrained.</p><p>PC Borg said the man had spat at officers and urinated on the door of the cell, so officers pinned him down on the floor. While he was \"kicking out\", Sgt Steve Stamp, nicknamed \"Stampy\", brought his boot down on the man's leg, the constable said.</p><p>The undercover reporter was able to examine footage from CCTV cameras in the custody suite, which showed the sergeant stamping down twice.</p></div><p></p><figcaption>PC Martin Borg described seeing a colleague stamp on a detainee</figcaption><p></p><div><p>\"This guy's fucking screamed,\" said PC Borg. \"He had a lump on his foot that looked like a fucking tumour mate, afterwards.\" Recalling that the detainee had protested that the sergeant stamped on his leg, he remembered saying: \"Yeah he fucking did, you cunt.\"</p><p>PC Borg said the sergeant had told him afterwards that the suspect had tried to kick him. \"Absolutely Sarge,\" he recalled saying. \"I'll put that in the MG11 if you like Sarge?\"</p><p>An MG11 is a witness statement. Ms Fish, the former chief constable, said if PC Borg  had put fabricated information in it, which could be shown to be false, that would be \"perverting the course of justice or conspiracy to pervert the course of justice\".</p><p>It is not clear in the CCTV footage if the man had tried to kick Sgt Stamp. The man had bare feet and four officers were restraining him at the time.</p><p>One officer described how, if suspects refuse to have their fingerprints taken, he could pull two of their fingers hard to snap the tendons. \"I love taking fingerprints by force,\" he said.</p></div><figure><div><p><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20250919-090805-05e5ba0164-web-2.30.1-2/grey-placeholder.png\" /><img srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/4388/live/bc0908f0-9e01-11f0-b741-177e3e2c2fc7.jpg.webp 240w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/4388/live/bc0908f0-9e01-11f0-b741-177e3e2c2fc7.jpg.webp 320w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/4388/live/bc0908f0-9e01-11f0-b741-177e3e2c2fc7.jpg.webp 480w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/4388/live/bc0908f0-9e01-11f0-b741-177e3e2c2fc7.jpg.webp 640w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/4388/live/bc0908f0-9e01-11f0-b741-177e3e2c2fc7.jpg.webp 800w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/4388/live/bc0908f0-9e01-11f0-b741-177e3e2c2fc7.jpg.webp 1024w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/4388/live/bc0908f0-9e01-11f0-b741-177e3e2c2fc7.jpg.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/4388/live/bc0908f0-9e01-11f0-b741-177e3e2c2fc7.jpg.webp\" alt=\"A hidden camera shot, taken slightly from below and at an angle, of an officer in police uniform, a white man with brown hair in a side-parting and a with a cleft chin, standing in front of a police van in the courtyard of Charing Cross police station, with windows of the station all around.

In May, it was handed a £122.7m fine, the biggest ever issued by the water industry regulator, for breaching rules on sewage spills and shareholder payouts.</p></div><div><p>London and Valley Water said on Thursday that its plan was the \"fastest and most reliable route\" to turn around Thames, clean up waterways and rebuild public trust.</p><p>Investors said they would inject an initial £5.4bn into the company to shore up its finances and support future investment, but they suggested the cash injection needed to be set against \"stretching but achievable and realistic performance targets\".</p><p>They said no dividends would be paid out to shareholders over the duration of the turnaround plan and that new shareholders would commit not to sell the business prior to March 2030.</p><p>Outstanding fines would also be paid, the lenders added.</p><p>London & Valley Water said it aimed to reach an agreement with Thames and water industry regulator Ofwat \"as quickly as possible this autumn given the urgent need to stabilise Thames Water\".</p><p>Mike McTighe, the proposed future chair of Thames Water under the terms of plan, said \"from day one, we will inject billions in new investment\".</p><p>He added that under a new company board, there would be a focus on \"reducing pollution and rebuilding public trust so that by the end of this decade Thames Water can once again be a reliable, resilient, and responsible company\".</p><p>Ofwat said it would review the latest plans.</p><p>In response to the plans, Chris Weston, chief executive of Thames Water, said the announcement marked an \"important milestone\" in the company's work to resolve its debt problems and secure its finances to \"support the investment and performance improvements our customers expect\".</p><p>The revised turnaround proposals come after Thames suffered a major blow in its attempt to secure its future this summer when US private equity firm KKR pulled out of a £4bn deal.</p><p>In July, the boss of Thames Water, Chris Weston, said the company was <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/czxw2edxen9o\">\"extremely stressed\" and that it would take \"at least a decade to turn around\".</a></p><p>Water bills for households in England and Wales have risen by £10 per month on average this year, although costs vary depending on suppliers. The bills for Thames Water's customer have gone up from £488 to £639 a year on average.</p></div>"

The trial is due to take place in January and could last up to nine weeks.</p></div><div><p>It <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-63164654\">emerged in 2022</a> that the prince and others were taking ANL to court, with some of the allegations dating back decades.</p><p>The publisher failed to get the case thrown out in 2023 by arguing the claims had been brought \"far too late\". </p><p>Lawyers for the claimants successfully argued that new evidence had come to light, and they did not know how information was being covertly acquired at the time.</p><p>ANL's lawyers have staunchly denied the allegations, previously calling the case \"without foundation\" and an \"affront\" to hard-working journalists whose reputations had been disparaged.</p><p>A spokesperson for ANL has previously said it had \"denied under oath that its journalists had commissioned or obtained information derived from phone hacking, phone tapping, bugging, computer or email hacking or burglary to order\".</p><p>The statement added: \"The stories concerned, many of which were published 20 or more years ago, and not subject to any complaint at the time, were the product of responsible journalism based on legitimate sources\".</p><p>This is the latest newspaper publisher against which Harry has brought legal action over information gathering.</p></div></article>"

No more remains and this can comfort parents,\" one of the cyber-criminals involved told the BBC.</p><p>It's understood Kido have not paid the hackers a ransom which was thought to be around £600,000.</p><p>Past cases have shown that hackers often say they have deleted stolen data and been found to have kept it or sold it on.</p><p>When the UK's National Crime Agency <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-68344987\">took down the cyber crime gang LockBit</a> they discovered troves of data still on the criminal's servers that victims had paid to be deleted.</p><p>The nursery hackers, calling themselves Radiant, appear to be concerned that their hack has crossed an undefined moral line since the public outcry began against them.</p><p>\"We are sorry for hurting kids,\" the cyber-criminals told BBC News.</p><p>It's not known who the hackers or hacker are but they appear to be a new and possibly inexperienced group. </p><p>Their darknet site is newly created but they claim to have carried out other hacks in the past.</p><p>This isn't the first time that cyber-criminals have backtracked on an attack.</p><p>In 2020 a gang using Dopplepaymer ransomware gifted their encryption key to a German hospital after the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-54204356\">chaos contributed to the death</a> of an emergency care patient.</p><p>When <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-57184977\">Conti hackers attacked the Irish Health Service</a> in 2021 they too gave their antidote away for free claiming not to have deliberately targeted hospitals.</p><p>Months before, criminals from the Darkside group took the strange decision to post proof that they had <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-54591761\">donated some of their ill-gotten bitcoin</a> to charities.</p><p>The nursery hackers claimed they broke into the nursery's systems by buying access to one of Kido's staff computers which was compromised by a separate hacker.</p><p>In a common process, the \"initial access broker\" sold the Kido access to Radiant, which went on to further infiltrate Kido's systems and steal the data.</p><p>The majority of the downloaded material including the pictures of children was taken from Kido's account with Famly - a popular early years education platform . </p><p>Famly has rejected Kido's message to parents that the breach happened as a result of Famly being compromised.</p><p>It has stressed to the BBC that neither the security or infrastructure of the platform has been compromised at any point.</p><p>Kido did not respond to a request for comment about the way the hackers stole the data. </p><p>A spokesperson said only that: \"We recently identified and responded to a cyber incident. We are working with external specialists to investigate and determine what happened in more detail. </p><p>\"We swiftly informed both our families and the relevant authorities and continue to liaise closely with them.\"</p><p>Radiant says it paid the initial access broker money for access to Kido's system. </p><p>So with Kido refusing to pay and the hackers giving up their extortion attempt the criminals appear to have actually lost money in this cyber-attack.</p></div>"

which was <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c626p66d6jxo\">temporarily suspended</a> in September - will be permanently scrapped.</p><p>Details of the new conditions refugees will have to meet in order to settle in the UK and be accompanied by family members will be set out later in the autumn. </p><p>It comes as Sir Keir Starmer meets leaders at the European Political Community summit in Copenhagen where he will be discussing ways to tackle illegal migration. </p></div><div><p>Ahead of that meeting, the prime minister said \"fundamental changes\" were being made to the asylum system to show that \"settlement must be earned by contributing to the country\".</p><p>The changes are similar to those already being planned for people coming on legal visas, such as for work, many of whom will have to wait 10 years to settle here. </p><p>A government source said the UK had been \"overly generous\" towards asylum seekers and wanted to show \"we get it, we will reduce the pull factors.\"</p><p>Shadow home secretary Chris Philp said: \"Tweaking family rules is another Starmer gimmick that will make no difference whatsoever.\"</p><p>The Refugee Council said the government's approach would not deter people trying to get to the UK but would instead push \"more desperate people into the arms of smugglers in an effort to reunite with loved ones\". </p><p>The government has been trying to reduce the numbers of people arriving in the UK on small boats crossing the Channel.</p><p>On coming to power in July 2024, Labour promised to \"stop the chaos\" of the \"small boat crisis\" but numbers remain at high levels. </p></div><div><p>Currently refugees can apply to settle in the UK - also called indefinite leave to remain - after five years, giving them the right to live, work and study in the country for as long as they want provided they meet <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.gov.uk/guidance/indefinite-leave-to-remain-in-the-uk#can-my-indefinite-leave-to-enter-or-remain-be-taken-away\">certain conditions</a>. </p><p>Under the forthcoming rules, the government says refugees will be offered a \"package of core protection\" but will face \"a new, longer route to settlement requiring them to contribute, replacing the current five years\". </p><p>Earlier this week, Home Secretary Shabana Mahmood <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c0m4g3zvy02o\">set out her plans</a> to make it similarly harder for migrants to qualify for indefinite leave to remain.</p><p>Under the proposals, legal migrants will have to learn English to a high standard, have a clean criminal record and volunteer in their community to be granted permanent settlement status.</p><p>Reform UK <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c0m4g3zvy02o\">has announced</a> it would replace indefinite leave to remain with visas requiring migrants - including non-EU nationals who already have the status - to reapply every five years.</p><p>The Migration Observatory estimates there are about 4.5 million people who hold indefinite leave to remain, including roughly 430,000 non-EU citizens.</p><p>The expected changes to settlement rules for refugees will be accompanied by alterations to family reunion conditions. </p><p>In September, the then home secretary Yvette Cooper announced that she was pausing the scheme which allowed refugees to bring their family to the UK with \"no conditions\" attached.</p><p>She said new rules would be announced in the coming months but until then refugees would have to face the same restrictions as other migrants - for example earning at least £29,000 and being able to provide the relative with suitable accommodation. </p><p>Arguing that the change was needed, Cooper said it was \"not fair\" that refugees should face a lower bar than others. </p><p>She also said the levels were \"not sustainable\" and that some councils were \"finding that more than a quarter of family homelessness applications are linked to refugee family reunion\". </p></div><div><p>During Thursday's summit in Copenhagen, Sir Keir will meet Danish Prime Minister Mette Fredriksen. </p><p>The two leaders are expected to announce £3m to encourage people from Western Balkan countries to stay in the region rather than migrate. </p><p>The UK government is also contributing up to £5.75m - up from £4m this time last year - to Italy's Rome Process, a scheme aimed at reducing the number of migrants crossing from Africa to Europe. </p><p>The government has said the prime minister will also discuss \"how to go further\" on changing the European Convention on Human Rights. </p><p>On Wednesday, Sir Keir <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cd72p30v574o\">told the BBC</a> he did not want to \"tear down\" human rights laws but was ready to look again at article three of the European Convention on Human Rights, which protects against torture and degrading treatment.</p><p>Sir Keir's comments come after a Labour Party conference dominated by efforts to confront Reform UK, which has been leading opinion polls in recent months. </p><p>The Conservative Party's conference in Manchester is due to start on Sunday.</p></div></article>"

They have said efforts to negotiate with Republicans over these benefits have so far been unsuccessful.</p><p>“Why are they boycotting negotiations?

And [Democrats] have taken the American people hostage in a way that they think benefits them politically.\"</p><p>Republicans have also argued the healthcare extensions Democrats are looking for will cost American taxpayers more money and were instituted to manage Covid-era complexities that no longer exist.</p><p>Essential workers such as border agents and the military may be forced to work without pay for the time being - but government employees deemed non-essential are temporarily put on unpaid leave.

Both regions have been hit by drone strikes in recent weeks, with two of the three plants in Samara region taken offline.</p></div><figure><div><p><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20250919-090805-05e5ba0164-web-2.30.1-2/grey-placeholder.png\" /><img srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/2184/live/58e5a6f0-9eda-11f0-92db-77261a15b9d2.png.webp 240w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/2184/live/58e5a6f0-9eda-11f0-92db-77261a15b9d2.png.webp 320w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/2184/live/58e5a6f0-9eda-11f0-92db-77261a15b9d2.png.webp 480w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/2184/live/58e5a6f0-9eda-11f0-92db-77261a15b9d2.png.webp 640w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/2184/live/58e5a6f0-9eda-11f0-92db-77261a15b9d2.png.webp 800w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/2184/live/58e5a6f0-9eda-11f0-92db-77261a15b9d2.png.webp 1024w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/2184/live/58e5a6f0-9eda-11f0-92db-77261a15b9d2.png.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/2184/live/58e5a6f0-9eda-11f0-92db-77261a15b9d2.png.webp\" alt=\"A BBC graphic showing the locations of the refinery strikes marked on a map of Russia. \" /></p></div></figure><div><p>Justin Crump, an ex-British army officer and CEO of the risk consultancy Sibylline, told BBC Verify that Ukraine had long targeted Russia's oil and gas industry.

Videos confirmed by BBC Verify have shown long queues at petrol stations in the far east and on a highway between St Petersburg and Moscow, while Kremlin-installed officials have introduced rationing of gasoline in occupied Crimea.</p><p>Owners of small and independent petrol stations in Siberia have told Russian media they have had to shut down due to ongoing issues with fuel supply. A manager in the Novosibirsk region compared the situation to the hyperinflation experienced by post-Soviet Russia.</p><p>\"In my opinion we haven't had a crisis like this since 1993-1994,\" he told local outlet Precedent TV. \"Many petrol stations have now suspended their operations. Perhaps it is better to wait out the crisis than make a loss.\"</p><p>While Russia has traditionally seen price increases spurred on by summer travelling and oil refinery maintenance, the drone strikes are exacerbating it.</p><p>Retail petrol prices have surged, while wholesale prices - the cost at which retailers buy from producers - have risen even faster, growing by 40% since January.</p><p>The tightly controlled domestic media has hinted that drone strikes are a key factor for the shortages, with the daily business newspaper Kommersant attributing the shortfall to \"unscheduled refinery shutdowns\".</p><p>But civilians in western Russia - including the Moscow and Krasnodar regions - appear to be largely unaffected. Some of those who spoke to the BBC said they were unaware of the shortages elsewhere in the country.</p><ul><li><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cly6r1mg34yo\">Trump considering supplying Ukraine with long-range missiles, Vance says</a></li><li><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c0l0k4389g2o\">Ukraine in maps: Tracking the war with Russia</a></li><li><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c8jm3lr7vkyo\">Trump urges Turkey to stop buying Russian oil as Erdogan chases deal on F-35s</a></li></ul><p>Russian officials have insisted that the situation remains under control. Last month Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said that the government had taken \"active measures to ensure that the price level for energy and petrol remains stable\".</p><p>But Deputy Prime Minister Alexander Novak announced last week that a partial ban on petrol exports had been extended to the end of 2025. Opposition politician Mr Milov noted that the export suspension was relatively small and \"won't save the domestic market\".</p><p>The extent to which the strikes are impacting Moscow's ability to use oil revenues to fund its war in Ukraine is also unclear.</p><p>The vast majority of Russia's oil exports are in the form of unrefined crude oil, which do not appear to have been impacted by the strikes. An analysis carried out by Bloomberg at the end of September showed that crude oil exports - while less profitable than petrol and diesel - had reached a record high.</p><p>Mr Crump observed that the impact of the strikes could be strengthened if \"further measures\" and sanctions targeting oil exports were adopted by the West, but emphasised that the attacks were undermining Moscow's ability to fight the war.</p><p>\"This campaign alone will not bring Russia to its knees, but is definitely increasing the pain of the protracted conflict.\"</p><p><i>Additional reporting by Christine Jeavans. </i></p></div><figure><div><p><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20250919-090805-05e5ba0164-web-2.30.1-2/grey-placeholder.png\" /><img srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/6c2a/live/b35f4090-9ec7-11f0-92db-77261a15b9d2.png.webp 240w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/6c2a/live/b35f4090-9ec7-11f0-92db-77261a15b9d2.png.webp 320w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/6c2a/live/b35f4090-9ec7-11f0-92db-77261a15b9d2.png.webp 480w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/6c2a/live/b35f4090-9ec7-11f0-92db-77261a15b9d2.png.webp 640w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/6c2a/live/b35f4090-9ec7-11f0-92db-77261a15b9d2.png.webp 800w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/6c2a/live/b35f4090-9ec7-11f0-92db-77261a15b9d2.png.webp 1024w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/6c2a/live/b35f4090-9ec7-11f0-92db-77261a15b9d2.png.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/6c2a/live/b35f4090-9ec7-11f0-92db-77261a15b9d2.png.webp\" alt=\"The BBC Verify logo\" /></p></div></figure></article>"
