    "body": "<div><p>A French murder trial that opened Monday has transfixed the public because of the mystery at its core: where is the victim's body?</p><p>Cédric Jubillar, a 38 year-old painter-decorator, is accused of killing his wife Delphine nearly five years ago in a fit of jealous rage. </p><p>He has always denied the charges and, other than circumstantial evidence, investigators have struggled to build a case. There is no body, no blood, no confession, and no witness.</p><p>With its unexplained central fact and its cast of characters from small-town southern France, the affair has become a social media sensation.</p></div><div><p>Self-declared investigators have set up countless chat groups where they swap theories and share testimony – much to the irritation of police and families.</p><p>\"These groups are the equivalent of the bistro counter – but with more people,\" said psychoanalyst Patrick Avrane, author of a book on attitudes to crime.</p><p>\"Everyone constructs the theory that suits him or her the best.\"</p><p>The Jubillar mystery began at the height of Covid lockdown when – in the early hours on 16 December 2020 – Cédric Jubillar contacted the gendarmes to report that his wife had gone missing.</p><p>Delphine, who was 33 at the time, was a night nurse in a clinic not far from their home in Cagnac-les-Mines in the south-western Occitania region. The couple had two children, aged six and 18 months.</p><p>Police came to understand that the Jubillars did not have a happy relationship. </p><p>Cédric Jubillar was a habitual cannabis user and barely held down a job. Delphine was in a relationship with a man she had met over the Internet. She and Cédric were talking about divorce.</p><p>Police and locals conducted extensive searches in the surrounding countryside – with potholers descending into some of the disused mineshafts with which the area is dotted.</p><p>Delphine's body was never found, but a case was gradually built against her husband and in mid-2021 he was placed under investigation and detained.</p><p>The prosecution at the trial in the town of Albi will tell the court that Cédric Jubillar had a clear motivation to kill his wife, because of their impending split.</p><p>Lawyers will raise other points: certain odd actions by Cédric on the night of the disappearance; signs of a fight, including a pair of broken glasses; a neighbour who heard a woman screaming.</p><p>Cédric Jubillar's own character will be brought under the spotlight, with witnesses expected who will speak of his threatening language to Delphine before she disappeared, and his apparent lack of concern after.</p><p>Two of his acquaintances – a former cellmate and a former girlfriend – will also repeat what they told police: that Cédric confessed to the murder and told them where her body was.</p><p>But after more digging no body has been found, and the defence is expected to raise doubts about the veracity of the pair's accounts.</p><p>Indeed the heart of Cédric Jubillar's case is that there is nothing – beyond the popular view that he is the ideal culprit – to prove that he did away with his wife. He himself has always protested his innocence.</p><p>The trial is expected to last four weeks, with 65 witnesses called and 11 experts. More than 16,000 pages of evidence have been compiled.</p><p>Explaining the case's grip on the public mind, writer Thibault de Montaigu said in Le Figaro newspaper it was like \"a novel by Georges Simenon\" – creator of the fictional detective Inspector Maigret.</p><p>In a long analysis of the case, he said that for all the circumstantial evidence against Cédric Jubillar, the central question was this: how a \"red-eyed, fuzzy-brained guy who smoked ten joints a day could have carried out the perfect crime?</p><p>\"Killing his wife without leaving the slightest trace; secretly transporting her body, burying her in an unfindable location, then coming back to tell the police – all while his two children slept quietly in their bedrooms.</p><p>\"And this was a guy who greeted the cops in panda pyjamas and then played Game of Thrones on his phone the very morning of the disappearance.</p><p>\"So: genius bluffer; lucky fool; or poor innocent?\"</p><p>The court will decide.</p></div>"

His sister Mona Seif wrote on X: \"My heart will explode.\"</p><p>The 43-year-old blogger and pro-democracy activist is one of Egypt's best known political prisoners.</p><p>He was arrested in 2019, months after finishing a previous five-year sentence, and convicted two years later of \"spreading false news\" for sharing a Facebook post about a prisoner dying after torture.</p></div><div><p>His family said he should have been released in September 2024. However, Egyptian authorities refused to count the two years he spent in pre-trial detention as time served.</p><p>Although he acquired British citizenship in 2021, Egypt has never allowed him a consular visit by British diplomats.</p></div><div><p>Abdel Fattah's lawyer, Khaled Ali, confirmed in a Facebook post on Monday afternoon that he had been pardoned.</p><p>He would be released from Wadi al-Natrun prison, north-west of Cairo, once the pardon was published in the official gazette, he added.</p><p>Abdel Fattah's other sister Sanaa Seif also wrote on X: \"President Sisi has pardoned my brother!\"</p><p>\"Mum & I are heading to the prison now to inquire from where Alaa will be released and when... OMG I can't believe we get our lives back!\"</p><p>The National Council for Human Rights welcomed the pardons, saying the decision was \"a step that underscores a growing commitment to reinforcing the principles of swift justice and upholding fundamental rights and freedoms\".</p><p>Two weeks ago, Sisi had ordered authorities to study the NCHR's petitions for the release of Abdel Fattah and six others, which the institution said it had submitted \"in light of the humanitarian and health conditions experienced by [their] families\".</p><p>In July, Abdel Fattah's 68-year-old mother, Leila Soueif, who is also a British citizen, ended a nine-month-long hunger strike after receiving assurances from the UK government that it was doing everything it could to secure his release.</p><p>She lost more than 40% of her original body weight and was twice admitted to hospital in London during the strike, which saw her consume only tea, coffee and rehydration salts.</p><p>Abdel Fattah has also staged a number of hunger strikes himself. One in 2022, as Egypt hosted the UN climate conference, led to international pressure for his release and an improvement in his conditions in jail.</p><p>He first rose to prominence during the 2011 uprising in Egypt that forced long-time President Hosni Mubarak to resign.</p><p>Since Sisi came to power in 2014 after leading the military's overthrow of Mubarak's democratically elected successor, he has spent most of the time in prison or police detention.</p><p>In May, UN Working Group on Arbitrary Detention - a panel of independent human rights experts – found that Abdel Fattah was arbitrarily arrested for exercising his right to freedom of expression, was not given a fair trial, and continued to be detained for his political opinions.</p><p>According to the panel, the Egyptian government said he was afforded \"all fair trial rights\" and that his sentence would be completed in January 2027.</p></div>"

Welfare reform is happening all the time. Anyone who looks at the current system shouldn't conclude that the thing to do is to circle the wagons around it,'' he said.</p><p>He also did not rule out tightening up eligibility for universal credit or removing entitlement for health-related universal credit payments to those under the age of 22.</p><p>''Look, I'm not ruling anything out. Welfare reform is really important. At the moment this system is unhealthy for people and in the long run is pushing up the benefits bill because we're not getting the help to people who could work,\" he added.</p></div><div><p>The scale of the challenge is daunting. About 3.7 million people of working age receive health-related benefits. The independent Office for Budget Responsibility forecasts that the bill for health and disability benefits will reach £100bn by 2030.</p><p>McFadden spoke to the BBC from a Job Centre Plus in Barking, East London. There he met four women who spoke movingly about how traumatic events in their lives had led to ill health and several years on sickness benefits. All had been assigned a specialist work coach who they said had helped give them confidence.</p><p>Faiza described how domestic violence had led to depression and anxiety and a feeling she was \"finished\". Hana, who trembled as she spoke, said that her body had \"shutdown\" after the collapse of her marriage and several surgeries.</p><p>The women's names have been changed to protect their identities. </p><p>All said they wanted to work, but under the current system they are under no obligation to engage with a job centre.</p><p>McFadden said the system had created a \"binary divide\" which separated people into fit for work and not fit for work in an \"unhealthy\" way. </p><p>He said 1,000 specially trained job centre staff would offer voluntary support to those on sickness benefits.</p><p>The government says that work coaches – known as Pathways to Work advisers – are now based in every job centre in England, Wales, and Scotland.</p><p>\"We've reallocated support to people who've been away from the labour market for a long time, who've been, frankly, signed off, paid benefits and untouched for years. That's wrong,\" he said.</p></div></article><hr /></div>"

The BBC has since contacted them for further comment.</p></div><div><p>Food allergy charity the Natasha Allergy Research Foundation and the Children's Literacy Charity - which helps disadvantaged children to improve their literacy skills - likewise said it was \"inappropriate\" for her to continue, but thanked her for her past support.</p><p>Prevent Breast Cancer also said<b> </b>the duchess was no longer a patron.</p><p>Another charity, the Teenage Cancer Trust, for which the duchess has been a patron for 35 years, said it had ended its relationship with her.</p><p>The charities' severing of links with the duchess follows the publication of an email from her to Epstein in 2011, which appears to have been sent after she had publicly claimed to have broken off contact with him.</p><p>The email appeared to privately apologise for her public rejection of Epstein, saying: \"You have always been a steadfast, generous and supreme friend to me and my family.\"</p><p>That seemed to contradict her public denunciation of Epstein in an interview earlier that year, in which she had said her involvement with him had been a \"gigantic error of judgement\" and that: \"What he did was wrong and for which he was rightly jailed.\"</p><p>A spokesperson for the duchess said her subsequent email to Epstein, describing him as a friend, had been sent because she was trying to counter a threat from him to sue her for defamation - and that she still really regretted any association with him.</p><p>\"This email was sent in the context of advice the duchess was given to try to assuage Epstein and his threats,\" said a statement from her spokesman at the weekend, when the email to Epstein had been published.</p><p>The email exchange was several years after Epstein's jailing for sex offences in 2008.</p><p>The duchess became patron of Julia's House charity - which serves families in Dorset and Wiltshire - in 2018 and had visited one of its hospices.</p><p>The Natasha Allergy Research Foundation, launched after teenager Natasha Ednan-Laperouse died from a severe allergic reaction to eating a baguette, asked the duchess to become a patron when it was founded in 2019.</p><p><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cnvd8j39qv5o\">She joined forces with Prevent Breast Cancer in 2024</a> following her own breast cancer treatment the year before.</p><p>Prince Andrew, the Duke of York and ex-husband of the duchess, stood down as a working royal and lost his royal patronages after challenges over his association with Epstein, including in a BBC Newsnight interview in 2019.</p><p>The contact with Epstein had continued after he had been released from jail - with Prince Andrew being photographed with Epstein in New York's Central Park in 2010.</p><p>There has been increasing pressure in the US for the release of any information about Epstein and his famous connections, which has seen more details emerging, including messages sent to him in alleged <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cr5q68j2169o\">\"birthday book\"</a>.</p><p>Epstein died by suicide in jail in New York in 2019, while awaiting trial on sex trafficking charges.</p></div>"

    "body": "<div><p>Trump officials are expected to make a disputed link between autism and the use of pain reliever Tylenol in pregnant women, according to US media reports. </p><p>At an Oval Office event on Monday, the US president will reportedly advise pregnant women in the US to only take Tylenol, known as paracetamol elsewhere, to relieve high fevers.</p><p>On Sunday, Trump said he had an \"amazing\" announcement coming on autism, saying it was \"out of control\", but they might now have a reason why.</p><p>Some studies have shown a link between pregnant women taking Tylenol and autism, but these findings are inconsistent and inconclusive. Tylenol maker Kenvue has defended the use of the drug in pregnant women.</p></div><div><p>In a statement to the BBC, it said: \"We believe independent, sound science clearly shows that taking acetaminophen does not cause autism. We strongly disagree with any suggestion otherwise and are deeply concerned with the health risk this poses for expecting mothers.\"</p><p>Tylenol is a popular brand of pain relief medication sold in the United States, Canada and some other countries. Its active ingredient is acetaminophen, which is called paracetamol outside North America.</p><p>Acetaminophen is the safest pain reliever option for pregnant women, it added, and without it, women face a dangerous choice between suffering through conditions like fever or use riskier alternatives.</p><p>The BBC has contacted the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) for comment. </p><p>In April, the leader of HHS, Robert F Kennedy Jr, pledged \"a massive testing and research effort\" to determine the cause of autism in five months.</p><p>But experts have cautioned that finding the causes of autism - a complex syndrome that has been researched for decades - would not be simple. </p><p>The widely held view of researchers is that there is no single cause of autism, which is thought to be the result of a complex mix of genetic and environmental factors.</p><ul><li><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cx25l92q9xgo\">Tylenol-maker shares hit after report of autism link</a></li></ul><p>The American College of Obstetrics and Gynecology said doctors across the country have consistently identified Tylenol as one of the only safe pain relievers for pregnant women.</p><p>\"Studies that have been conducted in the past, show no clear evidence that proves a direct relationship between the prudent use of acetaminophen during any trimester and fetal developmental issues,\" the group has said. </p><p>The drug is recommended by other major medical groups as well as other governments around the world. </p><p>In August, a <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://hsph.harvard.edu/news/using-acetaminophen-during-pregnancy-may-increase-childrens-autism-and-adhd-risk/\">review of research</a> led by the dean of Harvard University's Chan School of Public Health found that children may be more likely to develop autism and other neurodevelopmental disorders when exposed to Tylenol during pregnancy. </p><p>The researchers argued some steps should be taken to limit use of the drug, but said the pain reliever was still important for treating maternal fever and pain, which can also have negative effects for children. </p><p>But another <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38592388/\">study, published in 2024,</a> found no relationship between exposure to Tylenol and autism. </p><p>\"There is no robust evidence or convincing studies to suggest there is any causal relationship,\" said Monique Botha, a professor in social and developmental psychology at Durham University. </p><p>Dr Botha added that pain relief for pregnant women was \"woefully lacking\", with Tylenol being one of the only safe options for the population. </p><p>Autism diagnoses have increased sharply since 2000, and by 2020 the rate among 8-year-olds reached 2.77%, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).</p><p>Scientists attribute at least part of the rise to increased awareness of autism and an expanding definition of the disorder. Researchers have also been investigating environmental factors.</p><p>In the past, Kennedy has offered debunked theories about the rising rates of autism, blaming vaccines despite a lack of evidence. </p></div>"
