There is no body, no blood, no confession, and no witness.</p><p>With its unexplained central fact and its cast of characters from small-town southern France, the affair has become a social media sensation.</p></div><div><p>Self-declared investigators have set up countless chat groups where they swap theories and share testimony – much to the irritation of police and families.</p><p>\"These groups are the equivalent of the bistro counter – but with more people,\" said psychoanalyst Patrick Avrane, author of a book on attitudes to crime.</p><p>\"Everyone constructs the theory that suits him or her the best.\"</p><p>The Jubillar mystery began at the height of Covid lockdown when – in the early hours on 16 December 2020 – Cédric Jubillar contacted the gendarmes to report that his wife had gone missing.</p><p>Delphine, who was 33 at the time, was a night nurse in a clinic not far from their home in Cagnac-les-Mines in the south-western Occitania region. The couple had two children, aged six and 18 months.</p><p>Police came to understand that the Jubillars did not have a happy relationship. </p><p>Cédric Jubillar was a habitual cannabis user and barely held down a job. Delphine was in a relationship with a man she had met over the Internet. She and Cédric were talking about divorce.</p><p>Police and locals conducted extensive searches in the surrounding countryside – with potholers descending into some of the disused mineshafts with which the area is dotted.</p><p>Delphine's body was never found, but a case was gradually built against her husband and in mid-2021 he was placed under investigation and detained.</p><p>The prosecution at the trial in the town of Albi will tell the court that Cédric Jubillar had a clear motivation to kill his wife, because of their impending split.</p><p>Lawyers will raise other points: certain odd actions by Cédric on the night of the disappearance; signs of a fight, including a pair of broken glasses; a neighbour who heard a woman screaming.</p><p>Cédric Jubillar's own character will be brought under the spotlight, with witnesses expected who will speak of his threatening language to Delphine before she disappeared, and his apparent lack of concern after.</p><p>Two of his acquaintances – a former cellmate and a former girlfriend – will also repeat what they told police: that Cédric confessed to the murder and told them where her body was.</p><p>But after more digging no body has been found, and the defence is expected to raise doubts about the veracity of the pair's accounts.</p><p>Indeed the heart of Cédric Jubillar's case is that there is nothing – beyond the popular view that he is the ideal culprit – to prove that he did away with his wife. He himself has always protested his innocence.</p><p>The trial is expected to last four weeks, with 65 witnesses called and 11 experts. More than 16,000 pages of evidence have been compiled.</p><p>Explaining the case's grip on the public mind, writer Thibault de Montaigu said in Le Figaro newspaper it was like \"a novel by Georges Simenon\" – creator of the fictional detective Inspector Maigret.</p><p>In a long analysis of the case, he said that for all the circumstantial evidence against Cédric Jubillar, the central question was this: how a \"red-eyed, fuzzy-brained guy who smoked ten joints a day could have carried out the perfect crime?</p><p>\"Killing his wife without leaving the slightest trace; secretly transporting her body, burying her in an unfindable location, then coming back to tell the police – all while his two children slept quietly in their bedrooms.</p><p>\"And this was a guy who greeted the cops in panda pyjamas and then played Game of Thrones on his phone the very morning of the disappearance.</p><p>\"So: genius bluffer; lucky fool; or poor innocent?\"</p><p>The court will decide.</p></div>"

Welfare reform is happening all the time. Anyone who looks at the current system shouldn't conclude that the thing to do is to circle the wagons around it,'' he said.</p><p>He also did not rule out tightening up eligibility for universal credit or removing entitlement for health-related universal credit payments to those under the age of 22.</p><p>''Look, I'm not ruling anything out. Welfare reform is really important. At the moment this system is unhealthy for people and in the long run is pushing up the benefits bill because we're not getting the help to people who could work,\" he added.</p></div><div><p>The scale of the challenge is daunting. About 3.7 million people of working age receive health-related benefits. The independent Office for Budget Responsibility forecasts that the bill for health and disability benefits will reach £100bn by 2030.</p><p>McFadden spoke to the BBC from a Job Centre Plus in Barking, East London. There he met four women who spoke movingly about how traumatic events in their lives had led to ill health and several years on sickness benefits. All had been assigned a specialist work coach who they said had helped give them confidence.</p><p>Faiza described how domestic violence had led to depression and anxiety and a feeling she was \"finished\". Hana, who trembled as she spoke, said that her body had \"shutdown\" after the collapse of her marriage and several surgeries.</p><p>The women's names have been changed to protect their identities. </p><p>All said they wanted to work, but under the current system they are under no obligation to engage with a job centre.</p><p>McFadden said the system had created a \"binary divide\" which separated people into fit for work and not fit for work in an \"unhealthy\" way. </p><p>He said 1,000 specially trained job centre staff would offer voluntary support to those on sickness benefits.</p><p>The government says that work coaches – known as Pathways to Work advisers – are now based in every job centre in England, Wales, and Scotland.</p><p>\"We've reallocated support to people who've been away from the labour market for a long time, who've been, frankly, signed off, paid benefits and untouched for years.

    "body": "<div><p><b>Born with a serious eye condition, England goalkeeper Hannah Hampton was told by doctors she should not play football.</b></p><p>The 24-year-old has had multiple operations to try to correct her vision but it is not perfect and she still has depth perception issues.</p><p>It is remarkable she has defied the odds.</p><p>After playing a big part in Chelsea's domestic treble in 2024-25, followed by her penalty shootout heroics to help England win Euro 2025, Hampton was <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/articles/c5yv9e105eno\">named the best female goalkeeper in the world</a> at the Ballon d'Or ceremony on Monday.</p><p>\"I've always gone through life trying to prove people wrong,\" she said before the Euros.</p><p>\"I was told from a young age that I couldn't play football, that it wouldn't be a profession I could pursue. But here I am.\"</p><p>Hampton has been used to setbacks and her career has been far from smooth.</p><p>She was dropped by England months after being part of the winning Euro 2022 squad.</p><p>She was forced to prove herself again and has bounced back and risen to the top. This is the story of her journey.</p></div><div><p></p><h2 id=\"She-was-born-to-be-a-footballer\"><span>'She was born to be a footballer'</span></h2><p></p></div><div><p>When Carla Ward arrived at Birmingham City as their new manager in 2020 she had already heard about teenager Hampton.</p><p>\"We spoke on the first day. I wanted to know where she wanted to be,\" Ward told BBC Sport. </p><p>\"She was an endearing character, as well as being a livewire, like most goalkeepers. But she articulated things in a way that was far more mature than her age. </p><p>\"It was on day two that I really saw what everyone was talking about. She was one of the most talented individuals I've ever worked with. </p><p>\"Everyone has different talents but she was born to be a footballer.\"</p><p>Hampton's love for football developed in Spain, where she moved with her family at the age of five and learned to speak the language fluently during her five years living there.</p><p>She was scouted by Villarreal's academy after former Argentine defender Fabio Fuentes recommended Hampton go to a club trial. </p><p>On her return to England, she joined Stoke City's academy before eventually breaking into the first team at Birmingham City at the age of 16 - switching positions from a striker to a goalkeeper.</p><p>She was already well known in England's youth team set-ups and her international manager at the time, Rehanne Skinner, had seen her talent up close.</p><p>\"She played with both feet. There are very few people in the game who can play off their weaker foot and hit it 60 yards with pinpoint accuracy,\" said Skinner.</p><p>During an England Under-19s game against Sweden, Skinner instructed Hampton to do one thing - hit it long.</p><p>\"Hannah got an assist within the first 10 minutes of the game. We won 4-0. Not a lot of goalkeepers have those tools,\" said Skinner.</p><p>\"As time has gone on, with maturity, being in the right settings and doing a lot of work behind the scenes, she has grown and put her attention into using those strengths to the best of her ability.\"</p><p>Ask anyone about Hampton and they all say the same thing - that she is technically gifted and excellent with the ball at her feet. </p><p>Former Birmingham and England team-mate Ellen White said Hampton would get involved in <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.englandfootball.com/articles/2023/Jan/17/what-is-rondo-england-players-20230117\">'rondos'<span>, external</span></a> in training and playing outfield \"wasn't alien\" to her.</p><p>But when Hampton revealed the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/59416582\">extent of her eye condition</a> - called strabismus - in the media, White admitted it was \"probably a shock to a lot of people\".</p><p>\"She probably has to adapt a bit to combat it, but you wouldn't ever know if you saw her training. She is crazy and would throw herself at anything,\" added White.</p><p>\"Her passing range is second to none, the way she moves and dives, and controls the ball. She's up there as one of the most exciting young goalkeepers in world football. </p><p>\"Maybe she helped influence other people who thought they couldn't be a goalkeeper.\"</p></div><div><p></p><h2 id=\"Ive-proven-people-wrong\"><span>'I've proven people wrong'</span></h2><p></p></div><div><p>Like all young players thrust into the limelight, White admitted Hampton was a \"little immature\" when they first played together at Birmingham.</p><p>\"Her emotions would take hold of her a lot, which they would do for any 16-year-old, and it was about dealing with the ups and downs,\" she said.</p><p>\"You won't save a goal every time. Managing her emotions needed time, experience and understanding. </p><p>\"I tried to take her under my wing a little bit and give her that guidance. I felt at that time she would be a very good goalkeeper but she needed some help.\"</p><p>Hampton rose through England's ranks, making her senior debut against future world champions Spain in 2022. </p><p>She made the squad for Euro 2022 but months after celebrating victory - often seen dancing with White during laps of honour - her career hit a stumbling block. </p><p>Reports suggested she was dropped from the England squad because of her behaviour and she had to wait until March 2023 for a recall, when manager Sarina Wiegman said Hampton had \"sorted out personal issues\".</p><p>Speaking about that time, Hampton said the stories were \"hurtful\" and she <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://open.spotify.com/episode/1KqTj92oEc37kuKIb2d2Us\">revealed on the Fozcast podcast<span>, external</span></a> that she had considered quitting football.</p><p>\"I was a very young girl when all the stories came out and you're not really prepared for that. You don't expect it,\" she said.</p><p>\"There have been moments when everyone [in the squad] has probably thought they were in a tough position, but you get each other out of it.</p><p>\"You can't let all the media scrutiny win. If you do that it just adds fuel to the fire and I wasn't willing to accept that. </p><p>\"I wanted to show who I am as a person and show that wasn't always true. I thought 'just dig in'. I think I can say that I've proven people wrong.\"</p><p>Ward managed Hampton at Aston Villa at the time, having brought her with her from Birmingham.</p><p>She fielded questions about Hampton's situation in news conferences and left the goalkeeper out of the squad against Chelsea for the \"best interests\" of the team.</p><p>\"We had an aligned agreement between Sarina, myself and Hannah on how we would help her with it,\" said Ward, reflecting on the time. </p><p>\"It was a difficult time for Hannah but it was probably a moment that really helped her. It was the moment she realised she had good support around her. </p><p>\"She was a young kid that just really needed support.\"</p><p>White, who captained England for Hampton's debut, retired from international football just before she was dropped from the squad.</p><p>But White believed Hampton \"just needed time\" to mature and felt she did that under former Chelsea manager Emma Hayes when she joined them in 2023. </p><p>Having \"an arm around her shoulders\" helped, said White, as well as the drive to become Chelsea's number one and get another shot on the international stage.</p><p>\"It's obviously not ideal not being selected for England. A lot of things transpired. Fair play to her because she did just get her head down and work hard,\" said White.</p><p>\"She just had to rebuild some of those relationships and gain them back in the England squad. I feel like she let her football do the talking.</p><p>\"Everyone goes through ups and downs, rollercoaster emotions and going in and out of the squads. I am really proud of her.\"</p></div>"

He was believed to have entered the country from Poland.</p><p>Since then, Emil has become a social media sensation, with hundreds of photos and videos posted online. There are at least three Facebook groups devoted to him, with a combined total approaching 50,000 members.</p><p>According to Czech Radio's online news portal iRozhlas, he has wandered through 60 towns and villages in four countries – Poland, the Czech Republic, Slovakia and Austria – in a journey approaching 500 kilometres.</p><p>He has picked his way across roads and railways, forded local streams and swum across the River Danube. He has been spotted on the fringes of two cultural events, including a heavy metal festival in South Moravia.</p><p>Elk were once native to Czech forests but were hunted to extinction in the Middle Ages. There have been several attempts to reintroduce them over the centuries, but they remained unsuccessful until the 1970s.</p><p>The Czech Republic's elk population is believed to be around fifty animals, far fewer than Emil's presumed homeland of Poland, which has tens of thousands.</p></div>"
