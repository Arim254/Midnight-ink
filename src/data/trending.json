The very fact the teenager was even a candidate is revolutionary. He seems destined to create an era.</p><p>Lamine Yamal, who did <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/articles/c9v71gxp02ro\">win the young player of the year award on Monday</a>, is not simply a footballer, he is a mirror for his generation.</p></div><p></p><h2 id=\"Closer-to-a-pop-star-than-a-traditional-footballer\"><span>'Closer to a pop star than a traditional footballer'</span></h2><p></p><div><p>For decades, football sold us the idea that greatness came through sacrifice and humility. </p><p>Lionel Messi spoke of the Ballon d'Or as a \"consequence of the team's work\". Cristiano Ronaldo turned discipline into theatre, sculpting his body into a monument of effort.</p><p>Lamine Yamal, by contrast, represents something new. He embodies a youth culture that does not hide its ambition. He has previously declared: \"I don't dream of one Ballon d'Or, I dream of many. If I don't get them, it will be my fault.\"</p><p>That is neither Messi's humility nor Ronaldo's warrior mentality. It is something else: call it self-ownership, where destiny is assumed as a personal responsibility. </p><p>It is a philosophy that resonates with generations Z and Alpha. These are young people shaped by crisis - financial collapse, pandemic, climate anxiety - who  distrust institutions. For them, success is not obedience to the system but independence from it. </p><p>Sacrifice is no longer the highest virtue; freedom is. Money is not taboo, but neither is it sacred: it is a tool for autonomy. Fun and visibility are not distractions - they are part of success.</p></div><div><figure><figcaption><span>Media caption, </span><p>Lamine Yamal - The Boy King</p></figcaption></figure></div><div><p>That is why Lamine Yamal's summer in Monaco, his gangster-themed birthday party, or even his moments alongside Neymar - a player who fell out of love with the game long ago yet remains an icon for young people - are not moral slip-ups. They say: as long as you perform, no-one can tell you how to live.</p><p>In this sense, Lamine Yamal is closer to a pop star than a traditional footballer. He belongs to the same generational universe as American singer-songwriter Sombr, who went from bedroom recordings to chart hits when TikTok propelled his songs around the world. </p><p>Sombr's rise is less about vocal technique than about attitude, presence and identity.

Lamine Yamal is fiercely self-aware. </p><p>He knows he is a prodigy and does not pretend otherwise. He embraces responsibility, already taking free-kicks, penalties and wearing Barca's number 10 shirt. \"Having character helps me survive,\" he says.</p><p>That resilience comes not only from talent but from life itself. He grew up in Rocafonda, a working-class neighbourhood of Mataro, the son of immigrants from Morocco and Guinea. His grandmother once sneaked on to a bus to cross into Spain and his mother raised him while working multiple jobs.</p><p>When his father was stabbed, Lamine Yamal was just 16. At La Masia he struggled at first with social displacement, moving from humble surroundings into an elite environment. All of this toughened him.</p><p>He is now intent on giving back. The first thing he did with his earnings was buy his mother the house she wanted. \"For me, she is my queen,\" he says. He recalls how, despite the late shifts, she still came home to cook him dinner.</p><p>And despite the scrutiny, he treats fame with detachment. When his birthday party made headlines, he laughed it off: \"Do you know any 18-year-old who goes out and it's news?\" Criticism washes away as long as he performs. His real fear is not living up to his own ambition.</p><p>Football, though, has a way of humbling. </p><p>He played only eight minutes at the old Nou Camp before its renovation, a reminder of how much still lies ahead.</p><p>And crucially, Barcelona are showing they can win while he is out injured. The \"Laminedependencia\" that once haunted them is fading; Marcus Rashford, Pedri and others are carrying the team when needed in recent games.</p><p>That is good news for both club and player. It allows Lamine Yamal to grow inside a collective, not under the suffocating expectation of being saviour. </p><p>On the pitch, he is evolving. His defensive work, his intensity, his duels all show growth. Both Hansi Flick and Luis de la Fuente are moulding him into a total footballer.</p></div><p></p><h2 id=\"Redefining-what-it-means-to-be-a-star\"><span>'Redefining what it means to be a star'</span></h2><p></p><div><figure><p><span><picture><source srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/240/cpsprodpb/58ca/live/dbf0f460-97bd-11f0-a84a-b1e2efa36bf3.jpg.webp 240w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/320/cpsprodpb/58ca/live/dbf0f460-97bd-11f0-a84a-b1e2efa36bf3.jpg.webp 320w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/480/cpsprodpb/58ca/live/dbf0f460-97bd-11f0-a84a-b1e2efa36bf3.jpg.webp 480w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/624/cpsprodpb/58ca/live/dbf0f460-97bd-11f0-a84a-b1e2efa36bf3.jpg.webp 624w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/800/cpsprodpb/58ca/live/dbf0f460-97bd-11f0-a84a-b1e2efa36bf3.jpg.webp 800w\" type=\"image/webp\"></source><img alt=\"Lamine Yamal speaks to the audience after being awarded the Kopa trophy\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/947/cpsprodpb/58ca/live/dbf0f460-97bd-11f0-a84a-b1e2efa36bf3.jpg\" srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/240/cpsprodpb/58ca/live/dbf0f460-97bd-11f0-a84a-b1e2efa36bf3.jpg 240w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/320/cpsprodpb/58ca/live/dbf0f460-97bd-11f0-a84a-b1e2efa36bf3.jpg 320w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/480/cpsprodpb/58ca/live/dbf0f460-97bd-11f0-a84a-b1e2efa36bf3.jpg 480w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/624/cpsprodpb/58ca/live/dbf0f460-97bd-11f0-a84a-b1e2efa36bf3.jpg 624w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/800/cpsprodpb/58ca/live/dbf0f460-97bd-11f0-a84a-b1e2efa36bf3.jpg 800w\" /></picture></span><span><span>Image source, </span>Getty Images</span></p><figcaption><span>Image caption, </span><p>Lamine Yamal won the Kopa Trophy for the best player aged 21 and under at the 2024 Ballon d'Or awards, aged just 17</p></figcaption></figure></div><div><p>So what comes next?

The only time that aid agencies and commercial shippers were able to get in adequate supplies was during the ceasefire that started on 19 January this year. That stopped abruptly when Israel imposed a total blockade on 2 March and two weeks later went back to war.</p><p>The global body that assesses food emergencies, the IPC, said in its most recent report in August that the famine had reached Gaza City. Israel's prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu says there is no famine in Gaza, rejecting the overwhelming evidence presented by the IPC as an \"outright lie\". The IPC is globally respected as an impartial and expert body. Netanyahu says Israel is not responsible for any \"shortages\".</p><p>He blames ineptitude at UN agencies in Gaza and has repeatedly accused the UN of doing nothing about the systematic theft of food by Hamas. The UN denies his allegations, arguing that its consignments are bar-coded and traceable. Israel, it says, has never provided evidence of the allegations of systematic theft, despite repeated UN requests.</p></div><div><ul><li><b>Outside of the UK, you can </b><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IA8YL_Datm0\"><b>watch on YouTube</b></a></li></ul></div><div><p>Famine is why Palestinians in Gaza, many of them young men like Abdullah, are prepared to risk their lives at the GHF sites to get food.</p><p>It is nearly two years since Hamas killed 1,195 people in southern Israel and took 251 hostages. Forty-eight Israelis are still in Gaza. Perhaps 20 of them are thought to be alive. It remains Israel's biggest trauma since its independence in 1948.</p><p>Israel's response has been to inflict the biggest trauma Palestinians have suffered in the same nearly eight decades. The Israelis continue to argue they are acting in self defence in Gaza - a narrow strip of land that is now in ruins, and has seen the killing by Israel of at least 65,000 people, according to the Hamas-run health ministry, including more than 18,000 children. Israel rejects these figures but they are generally considered reliable by international organisations.</p><p>Abdullah was a bright young man. Sticky notes above his desk display reminders to himself to aim for 95% in his exams. Judging by the photos his father provides, he dressed smartly, with a sharp haircut and an expectant smile. He must have seen possibilities ahead in his life, even in Gaza, a place where life was hard even before the war. Now it is reduced to a struggle to survive Israeli attacks and the famine.</p></div><figure><div><p><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20250905-110137-f27f908f49-web-2.29.1-3/grey-placeholder.png\" /><img srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/61af/live/81db2590-9894-11f0-af62-91486a511a31.jpg.webp 240w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/61af/live/81db2590-9894-11f0-af62-91486a511a31.jpg.webp 320w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/61af/live/81db2590-9894-11f0-af62-91486a511a31.jpg.webp 480w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/61af/live/81db2590-9894-11f0-af62-91486a511a31.jpg.webp 640w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/61af/live/81db2590-9894-11f0-af62-91486a511a31.jpg.webp 800w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/61af/live/81db2590-9894-11f0-af62-91486a511a31.jpg.webp 1024w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/61af/live/81db2590-9894-11f0-af62-91486a511a31.jpg.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/61af/live/81db2590-9894-11f0-af62-91486a511a31.jpg.webp\" alt=\"Aerial image of where Abdullah was shot and killed in Gaza, showing where shots were fired from the direction of an IDF position, and also where aid seekers came under fire.

That was when he was shot dead. Moaaz said he ran through heavy fire to get to his friend. He lived around 10 more minutes.</p><p>Diaa told us about his son, and how hard it is to live and stay alive in Gaza.</p><p>\"In Gaza we are a peaceful people.

It is an investigation into hunger in Gaza, and the killing around the food distribution sites run by the GHF. Dying for Food looks at just one part of Gaza's humanitarian catastrophe. We have established how so many Palestinians are being killed seeking aid. It is a worthy subject for a half-hour television film. A comprehensive account from every angle would need a series.</p><p>Reporting and producing the film has been a considerable challenge. That is because Israel does not permit the BBC, or any other news organisation, to send teams into Gaza to report freely. Palestinian journalists inside Gaza have done heroic work, without which we would know much less about what has been happening there in the past two years. According to the UN Human Rights Office, at least 248 of them have been killed by Israel.</p><p>On Dying for Food I was the reporter, the public face of a big team of journalists. I wrote the script, but I did not interview Diaa or Moaaz about the killing of Abdullah. I wasn't present when the filming took place of the dead and dying in hospital emergency departments, of miles of rubble and Palestinians desperate to grab some food while the IDF and armed American security men working for GHF were said to have opened fire. I was able to talk to the interviewees who weren't in Gaza, either face to face or via video.</p><p>It is not the way the BBC, or any other group of journalists and film makers would choose to work. A fundamental rule of journalism is to narrow the distance between the reporter and the story. It was drummed into me when I was a BBC trainee journalist assigned to the Belfast newsroom during the Troubles in the winter of 1984-85. An acerbic news editor, using a tone that might get him into trouble these days, told me to leave the building to use my own eyes and ears, and to talk to people.</p></div><figure><div><p><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20250905-110137-f27f908f49-web-2.29.1-3/grey-placeholder.png\" /><img srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/b91e/live/fa1900d0-989f-11f0-af62-91486a511a31.jpg.webp 240w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/b91e/live/fa1900d0-989f-11f0-af62-91486a511a31.jpg.webp 320w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/b91e/live/fa1900d0-989f-11f0-af62-91486a511a31.jpg.webp 480w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/b91e/live/fa1900d0-989f-11f0-af62-91486a511a31.jpg.webp 640w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/b91e/live/fa1900d0-989f-11f0-af62-91486a511a31.jpg.webp 800w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/b91e/live/fa1900d0-989f-11f0-af62-91486a511a31.jpg.webp 1024w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/b91e/live/fa1900d0-989f-11f0-af62-91486a511a31.jpg.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/b91e/live/fa1900d0-989f-11f0-af62-91486a511a31.jpg.webp\" alt=\"Tawfik pictured sitting down.

The IDF allows some news teams short and heavily supervised visits. I have done one, for about three or four hours, in the first month of the war. It let me see the destruction first hand, and to talk to soldiers. </p><p>One IDF officer started by telling me that they worked hard to safeguard the lives of noncombatants. Even in the first few weeks of the war, Israel was being accused of ignoring its legal obligations to protect civilians. Then the officer trailed off, and in disgust told me that all the Palestinians were guilty, not just the Hamas units that had led the 7 October attacks. If they weren't guilty, he said, they would have found a way to overthrow Hamas.</p><p>To get round Israel's ban on our entry into Gaza, we commission local freelancers who are still able to operate on the ground. Our team had long conversations with them about where to film, who to interview and what to ask. We needed to know about the backgrounds and relevance to the story of potential interviewees and where filming would be an acceptable risk to take in a warzone where nowhere is safe.</p><p>From a distance, BBC journalists directed the teams we used in Gaza. We reviewed and verified the material we received, examining closely the data embedded in videos that shows when and where it was shot. Just communicating with people in Gaza is hard. Digital connections are patchy. It took several days for the story of Abdullah to be sent to London after it was filmed. </p><p>Connectivity out of Gaza is often weak or non-existent, as Israel has bombed mobile phone masts and internet hubs. The current Israeli offensive in Gaza made movement difficult and highly dangerous. One of the filmmakers we worked with in Gaza City went quiet for a few days while they moved their family somewhere they hoped might be safer.</p><p>We also asked for permission to film at the GHF sites but were refused.</p><p>Reporting from a distance is not the way we want to work. But given the constraints imposed by Israel, we believe we have found the best obtainable way to tell the story of how Gazans live and die.</p></div><figure><div><p><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20250905-110137-f27f908f49-web-2.29.1-3/grey-placeholder.png\" /><img srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/be06/live/b1716bb0-9863-11f0-858a-a904eacbef23.jpg.webp 240w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/be06/live/b1716bb0-9863-11f0-858a-a904eacbef23.jpg.webp 320w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/be06/live/b1716bb0-9863-11f0-858a-a904eacbef23.jpg.webp 480w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/be06/live/b1716bb0-9863-11f0-858a-a904eacbef23.jpg.webp 640w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/be06/live/b1716bb0-9863-11f0-858a-a904eacbef23.jpg.webp 800w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/be06/live/b1716bb0-9863-11f0-858a-a904eacbef23.jpg.webp 1024w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/be06/live/b1716bb0-9863-11f0-858a-a904eacbef23.jpg.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/be06/live/b1716bb0-9863-11f0-858a-a904eacbef23.jpg.webp\" alt=\"Picture of Reem, who is looking to the side of the camera.

He was also looking for food, more plentiful then but still dangerous to venture out to get it as Israel invaded and pummelled Gaza. </p><p>She was interviewed in a tent in Gaza City. We have not been able to contact her in the past week or so. We believe Reem might have taken her two children south from Gaza City to escape the ferocious offensive Israel has launched to capture the area. If so, it would be the sixth time they have been displaced. Most of Gaza's more than two million civilians have been displaced many times.</p><p>One way of getting information when physically you are not there to see it for yourself is to talk to witnesses. I interviewed an NHS doctor just back from Gaza called Tawfik Omar, who is a vascular surgeon in Coventry. Tawfik is from Egypt and spoke at length to patients and their families in Gaza. Vascular surgeons see a lot of blood. Tawfik was shocked in Gaza by an overpowering smell of blood in hospitals packed with the dead and dying who had been shot near aid sites.</p><p>\"The local people coming from the GHF points,\" he told me, \"are saying clearly that we can see the GHF security guards or the IDF personnel shooting directly at the crowds.\"</p><p>Dying for Food features two whistleblowers, who didn't want to be identified. One was a lorry driver for a GHF logistics subcontractor. We called him \"John\" and hid his identity because he is worried that his safety might be compromised if it was known that he had spoken out. He told me that another potential whistleblower had been silenced by threats from former colleagues.</p><p>There are only three GHF aid points, compared to 400 that existed when the UN was distributing aid. John told us they felt like military bases on the front line, not places where humanitarian aid was given to those who need it. He told us that every night he did his work, it was with the background of heavy gunfire. John was so shocked by what he saw that he secretly recorded videos with his mobile.</p></div><p></p><figcaption>Watch: Whistleblower's secret recordings of gunfire near GHF aid sites</figcaption><p></p><div><p>His videos were part of the material we used to establish a pattern of the IDF's use of live fire to control crowds, an intrinsically lethal technique. On a day when more than 20 people were killed near the single GHF aid site in central Gaza, we were able to use John's video taken that night to help establish what was happening.</p><p>It shows heavy fire coming from an IDF position just behind site four. The bullets were hitting an area where we established that hungry people, in their thousands, would often gather near a bridge over a dried-up river bed that leads to the entrance of the site.</p><p>Even though we were not physically in Gaza, our team analysed John's videos (and many others) using open-source intelligence, a way to check events and corroborate testimony by using the latest techniques and software to sort through the wealth of data and video that is available online. We spoke to five ballistics experts, and used software that analyses the sound of shooting on videos, to help establish the trajectory of bullets.</p><p>We used satellite pictures, which are no longer the sole preserve of intelligence agencies, and matched the detail they showed with the videos. Satellite pictures are available commercially and are especially valuable in the Gaza Strip, which straddles a 40-km (25-mile) stretch of the eastern Mediterranean coast where clouds are rare.</p><p>Videos shot on mobiles carry metadata, which includes the digital record of the time, date and place where they were shot. We know the dates of our whistleblower's videos, but we have not revealed them to help John stay anonymous.</p><p>The data on the number of deaths at GHF sites comes from a body called Armed Conflict Location and Event Data (ACLED). It collects and analyses data from warzones and is funded, among others, by the United Nations, the European Union, the US and European countries including the UK.</p><p>ACLED's data shows that since the GHF began its operations, at least 1,300 Palestinians have been killed at, or around, its sites, mostly by IDF fire. Across Gaza, Palestinians were being killed seeking aid in the year before GHF arrived at an average rate of 30 per month. Since its sites opened, that has risen to 500.</p><p>The IDF denies the killing. It told us that it is \"not aware of hundreds of fatalities caused by… [its] …forces at distribution points.\" It says these figures are \"inflated and false\".</p></div><figure><div><p><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20250905-110137-f27f908f49-web-2.29.1-3/grey-placeholder.png\" /><img srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/1ad8/live/02913500-98a2-11f0-af62-91486a511a31.jpg.webp 240w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/1ad8/live/02913500-98a2-11f0-af62-91486a511a31.jpg.webp 320w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/1ad8/live/02913500-98a2-11f0-af62-91486a511a31.jpg.webp 480w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/1ad8/live/02913500-98a2-11f0-af62-91486a511a31.jpg.webp 640w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/1ad8/live/02913500-98a2-11f0-af62-91486a511a31.jpg.webp 800w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/1ad8/live/02913500-98a2-11f0-af62-91486a511a31.jpg.webp 1024w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/1ad8/live/02913500-98a2-11f0-af62-91486a511a31.jpg.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/1ad8/live/02913500-98a2-11f0-af62-91486a511a31.jpg.webp\" alt=\"Reuters Picture showing people carrying aid away from a GHF food distribution site in Gaza.

He came forward through the Israeli group, Breaking the Silence, which opposes the occupation of Palestinian territory and supports IDF soldiers who want to talk about their experiences enforcing it. Michael was shocked by the desperation and hunger he saw in Gaza.</p><p>\"It's hard to understand how low we degraded common, regular people to a state of that much hunger and frenzy about food.\"</p><p>He said they were ordered to fire warning shots when they wanted to hold back the crowds. They opened fire when the crowd crossed imaginary lines in the area. The system was not shared with Palestinians.</p><p>\"You have a green one, you have a red one. In the green one you shoot a warning shot.  So they will understand that this is a no-go zone and they need to turn back. In the red one, it's too close, it is too dangerous, and then you use lethal force.\"</p><p>Michael told me how concerned he was that IDF soldiers communicated their wishes to thousands of Palestinians by firing live bullets.</p><p>\"Yes, it concerned me a lot. Because the moment they won't listen to the shots, they'll start running at us, and then we need to decide what we're doing with a thousand people on their way to the base.\"</p><p>Michael said the GHF aid operation was chaotic and badly planned.

Peace is not even a distant dream. The war that started with the attacks led by Hamas on 7 October 2023 is as significant a moment in the history of the conflict as the ones in 1948, when Israel fought and won its independence, and 1967, when it captured and occupied the West Bank, including East Jerusalem and the Gaza Strip, giving it full control of the land.</p><p>The Gaza war has stripped the conflict to its essentials. European allies that gave Israel strong support after 7 October 2023, have decided that the only way to try to offer a better way ahead than perpetual war is to recognise an independent Palestine, which the UK, France and others have done this week at the UN General Assembly in New York.</p><p>Israel and its supporters, led by the US, have condemned the move as a reward for Hamas terrorism. The counter argument to that is that the best way of ending armed attacks on Israelis is to create the conditions for Palestinian independence and allow Palestinians to set up a state in Gaza, the West Bank, including a capital in East Jerusalem. The occupation of Palestinian land is illegal under international law according to the International Court of Justice.</p><p>The determined opposition of Israel, backed by the US, makes the vision of a Palestinian state remote. So does the presence of more than 700,000 Jewish settlers in the West Bank, including East Jerusalem, on land the UK and others now call the state of Palestine. But Britain's Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer and France's President Emmanuel Macron argue they have to act now to try to keep alive the hope of peace through the two-state solution. If Israel does not accept Palestinian independence, it will find itself even more isolated for ruling over millions of people and denying them political rights.</p><p>The current offensive is aimed at forcing up to one million people out of Gaza City. It suits the plan pushed by Benjamin Netanyahu's hardline allies to seize the Gaza Strip for Jewish settlers - and force Palestinians out.  One extremist leader in the Israeli cabinet predicted a real estate bonanza.</p><p>There is strong evidence of war crimes on both sides.  Hamas committed war crimes when it broke through Israel's border defences two years ago, and in the months that followed when it still had the capacity to fire barrages of missiles at Israeli towns. Holding hostages in appalling conditions and threatening their lives is also a crime.</p><p>Israel faces accusations of a genocidal attack on Gaza's Palestinians, not just with bullets and high explosive, but by using food as a weapon of war. The IPC, the world body that assesses food emergencies, says famine caused by the Israeli blockade of Gaza is present and spreading. If it is proved that Israel is committing acts with the intent to destroy Gaza's Palestinians as a group, in whole or in part, then genocide will be added to the list of war crimes that the whistleblower John - and many others - say that they have witnessed.</p><p>Israel says it has the most moral army in the world, has not committed war crimes, and is fighting a just war in the defence of its citizens. Benjamin Netanyahu insists the current offensive aimed at capturing Gaza City will deliver the elusive total victory over Hamas that he has promised repeatedly. He also insists it will rescue the Israeli hostages still in Gaza.</p><p>The UK says the IDF assault on Gaza is utterly reckless and appalling. The Foreign Secretary, Yvette Cooper, posted: \"It will only bring more bloodshed, kill more innocent civilians and endanger the remaining hostages. We need an immediate ceasefire, all hostages released, unrestricted humanitarian aid and a path to lasting peace.\"</p><p>When, in August, the IPC published its report saying that famine had spread to Gaza City, Israel was planning one of the biggest offensives of the war to capture the city and force about a million civilians to flee south.</p><p>Israel was open about its plans, which prompted a warning about the prospects for September from the IPC. It said that intensified military action, and the forced relocation of already fragile civilian populations would make the famine in Gaza \"significantly more severe\".</p><p>That is now the risk.</p></div></article>"

Even Donald is expecting a \"bear pit\" at Bethpage and the skipper has handed out virtual reality headsets to the players to replicate the abuse they are expecting.</p><p>Raucous home crowds have become a staple of Ryder Cups and while most of the partisan support is good natured, it can, occasionally cross the line.</p><p>\"It's not going to come as a shock,\" Sir Nick Faldo, a stalwart of 11 Ryder Cups, told BBC Sport. \"You're going to have to be mentally prepared for it. </p><p>\"It's going to be down to discipline - something's going to go on, something's going to be said and we're saying to Luke, could you make it a rule that nobody will crack, or over-react.</p><p>\"I think you have a secret word between you and your caddie. You turn and look and say something, have a little laugh and then he says 'right job at hand, get on with it'. Get the golfer to click back in. This is a great golf course, we've got to play a great shot, that will keep you 100% focused.\"</p><p>It's not easy to block out though.</p><p>Colin Montgomerie was subjected to such bad abuse at Brookline in 1999 that his late father was forced to walk away from his singles match against then US Open champion Payne Stewart.</p><p>The Scot was leading by three holes when \"things changed on the ninth tee\".</p><p>\"It got ugly, somebody shouted out and didn't allow me to hit my tee shot,\" he recalled.</p><p>\"I turned round to the crowd and said if this happens again, or I'm not allowed to play, then unfortunately I'll have to walk in. </p><p>\"I was shaking at the time, I'm feeling it now talking about it. This is a game of golf.\"</p><p>Despite his own reaction, Montgomerie echoed Faldo's thoughts on focusing on the task ahead and how crucial a fast start could be.</p><p>\"Friday is massive for Europe,\" he said. \"If we can get ahead and stay ahead, you'll probably find the American hostility could be directed at their own players.\"</p><p>Justin Rose, who will make his seventh appearance for Europe this week, has direct experience of that from 2012, when Europe mounted an epic final-day comeback at Medinah.</p><p>\"The crowd in Chicago were rough and tough but for the most part the Americans had the upper hand,\" he said.</p><p>\"But as soon as we were able to flip the script, the crowd did change, they did go quiet. They didn't like it and that's going to be our goal, to pacify the crowd. </p><p>\"I don't think it's going to be easy. I don't think we should expect to pacify the crowd, that might not be possible. We've just got to be resilient as a team. </p><p>\"But Medinah proves it's possible.\"</p><p>And he believes the pressure and expectation from the home fans might be as tough for the US players to deal with.</p><p>\"It's about not letting the environment affect us,\" he said. </p><p>\"But none of us, even the Americans, will have played in that before. Obviously it will be more pro for them but at the same time it's going to be different - so if we can deal with it we've got an awesome chance to win.\"</p></div><div><figure><p><span><picture><source srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/240/cpsprodpb/228d/live/b3ab61f0-9549-11f0-9cf6-cbf3e73ce2b9.jpg.webp 240w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/320/cpsprodpb/228d/live/b3ab61f0-9549-11f0-9cf6-cbf3e73ce2b9.jpg.webp 320w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/480/cpsprodpb/228d/live/b3ab61f0-9549-11f0-9cf6-cbf3e73ce2b9.jpg.webp 480w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/624/cpsprodpb/228d/live/b3ab61f0-9549-11f0-9cf6-cbf3e73ce2b9.jpg.webp 624w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/800/cpsprodpb/228d/live/b3ab61f0-9549-11f0-9cf6-cbf3e73ce2b9.jpg.webp 800w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/976/cpsprodpb/228d/live/b3ab61f0-9549-11f0-9cf6-cbf3e73ce2b9.jpg.webp 976w\" type=\"image/webp\"></source><img alt=\"European Ryder Cup fans in among US supporters at Whistling Straits in 2021\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/1920/cpsprodpb/228d/live/b3ab61f0-9549-11f0-9cf6-cbf3e73ce2b9.jpg\" srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/240/cpsprodpb/228d/live/b3ab61f0-9549-11f0-9cf6-cbf3e73ce2b9.jpg 240w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/320/cpsprodpb/228d/live/b3ab61f0-9549-11f0-9cf6-cbf3e73ce2b9.jpg 320w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/480/cpsprodpb/228d/live/b3ab61f0-9549-11f0-9cf6-cbf3e73ce2b9.jpg 480w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/624/cpsprodpb/228d/live/b3ab61f0-9549-11f0-9cf6-cbf3e73ce2b9.jpg 624w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/800/cpsprodpb/228d/live/b3ab61f0-9549-11f0-9cf6-cbf3e73ce2b9.jpg 800w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/976/cpsprodpb/228d/live/b3ab61f0-9549-11f0-9cf6-cbf3e73ce2b9.jpg 976w\" /></picture></span><span><span>Image source, </span>Getty Images</span></p><figcaption><span>Image caption, </span><p>Nick Faldo says the players will be relying on the European fans at Bethpage to make themselves heard among the Americans</p></figcaption></figure></div><p></p><h2 id=\"Keeping-Donald-as-captain\"><span>Keeping Donald as captain</span></h2><p></p><div><p>The fans chanting \"two more years\" towards Donald at Marco Simone in Rome was one thing, but the players joining in was the rubber stamp he needed to continue.</p><p>Not since the days of Tony Jacklin through the 1980s and Bernard Gallacher in the early 1990s has the European captaincy been anything more than a one and out deal.</p><p>But Donald has the continent's golden touch. Four wins out of four as a player - with two of those on American soil. One out of one as skipper.</p><p>Crucially, he was on the last team to win away, and set the tone for Sunday's singles in 2012 by going out first and defeating Bubba Watson to spark the record turnaround from 10-6 down.</p><p>And that experience and nous will be needed to deal with some of the feistiest fans in American sport and home players desperate to regain the trophy.</p><p>\"This is a different challenge,\" he said. \"I am aware we have lost three of the past four away Ryder Cups by significant margins. Some of our advantages from Rome are certainly not advantages anymore.</p><p>\"A lot of my thinking revolves around crowd management and how we react as a team.</p><p>\"In terms of communication, to get my messaging across, that process started 15 months ago. Hopefully they will see some good results.\"</p><p>Rose, who is seeking a fifth Ryder Cup win, was a team-mate of Donald's in 2012. </p><p>The Englishman told BBC South: \"Luke has a plan. The messaging has been consistent. He's not adding to the noise and keeping it as simple as possible for us. </p><p>\"I haven't felt like anything going differently and that's probably the genius of what Luke's been doing.\"</p></div><p></p><h2 id=\"Stability-is-key\"><span>Stability is key</span></h2><p></p><div><p>This is the 45th edition of the biennial contest and the visitors have made fewer alterations to their team than in any previous contest in the 98-year history of the event.</p><p>As Europe, the next fewest number of changes was three in 1985, 1987 and 2006 - and all three ended in victories.</p><p>Dane Rasmus Hojgaard, who was embedded with the team in Rome, is the solitary change, replacing his twin brother Nicolai, having qualified for his debut through the ranking system.</p><p>Montgomerie, who led the side to victory in 2010 and won five out of eight as a player, joked on BBC Radio 5 Live's Ryder Cup preview programme: \"With all due respect Rasmus and Nicolai are the same person really. They shared the same egg, so we have the same team and that's huge.\"</p><p>With Donald looking to emulate Jacklin as the only captain to win home and away matches and cement his place alongside Europe's greats, he opted not to include any rookies in his six selections.</p><p>\"If I was coming into a home Ryder Cup I'd be comfortable with a few rookies, next generation coming through, which is what happened in Rome,\" said Rose.</p><p>\"There is still tons of pressure, don't get me wrong, but I'm really happy the boys have experienced a Ryder Cup and they know what to expect in terms of the rhythm and flow of the week and the emotion.\"</p><p>And you can understand Donald's thinking, of seeking to take a settled community into what Montgomerie has called a \"cauldron\".</p><p>\"It's important we have a good amount of experience in that team room with people that have dealt with it,\" said Donald.</p><p>Faldo, who amassed 25 points from 11 appearances, second only to Sergio Garcia's 28.5 - added: \"Your big guys have got to do the heavy lifting. </p><p>\"You need half the team playing great, winning the point and hope one or two others have a great period. If you can get close to 10 points out of the first two days, you only need four out of 12 in the singles. That's the gameplan.\"</p><p>Faldo was talking about the likes of Rory McIlroy, Tommy Fleetwood, Jon Rahm, Tyrrell Hatton and Rose, who have all won more than 50% of the points they have contested.</p><p>Major winners McIlroy (18 points) and Rose (15.5) also bring seasoned know-how, having been in the victorious 2012 side alongside Donald.</p><p>Fleetwood broke his PGA Tour duck by winning the season-ending Tour Championship last month, while Rahm was crowned LIV Golf's individual player of the year for a second time. </p><p>Hatton's major performances meant he claimed an automatic place despite also playing on the Saudi circuit and having limited qualification opportunities.</p><p>Robert MacIntyre, an inspired wildcard pick in Rome who has qualified this time round, could be added to that quintet given his performances since then.</p><p>After going unbeaten on his Ryder Cup debut, he has won the Scottish and Canadian Open titles - as well as finishing runner-up at the US Open in June.</p><p>Rahm needed a wildcard pick, as did Viktor Hovland and Ludvig Aberg, who impressed as a pairing in Rome with two wins from three matches.</p><p>Donald has also put his faith in Shane Lowry and Sepp Straka - who won one and lost one of their two outings together in 2023 - and Matt Fitzpatrick, despite his poor record of one point in three appearances, two of which were heavy away defeats in 2016 and 2021. </p><p>\"They've had a dry run and made it work, they know the pairings,\" said Europe's first Ryder Cup-winning captain Jacklin.</p><p>\"You don't go in there complacent. The antennae is up and you're looking for weakness but I can't see anything other than a European win.\"</p></div><p></p><h2 id=\"Scheffler-aside-there-is-nobody-to-fear\"><span>'Scheffler aside, there is nobody to fear'</span></h2><p></p><div><figure><p><span><picture><source srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/240/cpsprodpb/9129/live/614bb940-9545-11f0-a49e-490ea541d65b.jpg.webp 240w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/320/cpsprodpb/9129/live/614bb940-9545-11f0-a49e-490ea541d65b.jpg.webp 320w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/480/cpsprodpb/9129/live/614bb940-9545-11f0-a49e-490ea541d65b.jpg.webp 480w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/624/cpsprodpb/9129/live/614bb940-9545-11f0-a49e-490ea541d65b.jpg.webp 624w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/800/cpsprodpb/9129/live/614bb940-9545-11f0-a49e-490ea541d65b.jpg.webp 800w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/976/cpsprodpb/9129/live/614bb940-9545-11f0-a49e-490ea541d65b.jpg.webp 976w\" type=\"image/webp\"></source><img alt=\"Bryson DeChambeau and Scottie Scheffler chest bump during their victory over Tommy Fleetwood and Viktor Hovland at Whistling Straits in 2021.\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/3840/cpsprodpb/9129/live/614bb940-9545-11f0-a49e-490ea541d65b.jpg\" srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/240/cpsprodpb/9129/live/614bb940-9545-11f0-a49e-490ea541d65b.jpg 240w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/320/cpsprodpb/9129/live/614bb940-9545-11f0-a49e-490ea541d65b.jpg 320w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/480/cpsprodpb/9129/live/614bb940-9545-11f0-a49e-490ea541d65b.jpg 480w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/624/cpsprodpb/9129/live/614bb940-9545-11f0-a49e-490ea541d65b.jpg 624w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/800/cpsprodpb/9129/live/614bb940-9545-11f0-a49e-490ea541d65b.jpg 800w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/976/cpsprodpb/9129/live/614bb940-9545-11f0-a49e-490ea541d65b.jpg 976w\" /></picture></span><span><span>Image source, </span>Getty Images</span></p><figcaption><span>Image caption, </span><p>DeChambeau and Scheffler each won 2½ points in 2021 at Whistling Straits</p></figcaption></figure></div><div><p>The American team is headed by the game's standout talent in Scottie Scheffler.

Public transport or walking is not presented as an option.</p><p>This can result in some unusually long journeys and others that are unusually short.</p><p>For instance, when migrants move between hotels, they sometimes keep the same NHS doctors - especially for GP referrals.</p><p>Work and Pensions Secretary Pat McFadden told BBC Radio 4's Today programme he agreed that there should be an investigation into how the system works. </p><p>\"I'm not surprised that this was a feature that caught people's eye\", he said. </p><p>On Tuesday, housing minister Matthew Pennycook told the Today programme it was \"questionable\" that asylum seekers needed to take such long taxi journeys and said the government would \"look into those cases\". </p><p>He added that asylum seekers were not \"ordinary citizens just jumping on a bus\".</p></div><div><p>Shadow home secretary Chris Philp, said: \"Every £600 taxi ride for migrants is money that should be paying for British patients to see their GP or for ambulances to turn up on time. This is why people feel the system is rigged against them.</p><p>\"Labour are writing a blank cheque for illegal immigration while services for hard-working families are strained.\"</p><p>Reform UK MP Lee Anderson said: \"This is likely just the tip of the iceberg and yet another example of how the Tories and Labour have spent billions supporting migrants at the expense of our own people.\"</p><p>A spokesperson for the Liberal Democrats called the taxi costs \"a ridiculous waste of taxpayer money and shows exactly why the government must take the asylum crisis seriously and end hotel use\".<b> </b></p><p>The BBC went into four hotels housing asylum seekers, as part of its investigation, uncovering cramped living conditions, illegal working, and fire alarms covered with plastic bags, as residents secretly cooked meals over electric hobs in bathrooms. </p><p>The BBC found: </p><ul><li>Smoke alarms covered with plastic bags as residents cooking meals used electric hobs in bathrooms</li><li>A 12-year-old girl living in a hotel who had spent three-quarters of her life in the asylum system. \"Once we get settled in a place, then they move us,\" she said</li><li>Some asylum seekers saying they had no choice but to work illegally for as little as £20 a day to pay off debts to people smugglers</li></ul><p>The issue of asylum seekers in hotels has become a heated political issue attracting protests and a <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/ckgy7p29y4ko\">legal challenge by an Essex council</a> attempting to close a hotel in its district.</p><p>The government plans to end the use of hotels for housing asylum seekers.</p><p>In August, asylum seekers told the BBC that protests outside hotels left them feeling isolated and anxious. </p><p>They emphasised that they did not choose to live in hotels and <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c17np7r02pgo\">struggled in \"damp and dirty\" conditions. </a></p></div></article><hr /></div>"

terminal \" /><span>Getty Images</span></p></div></figure><div><p>A person has been arrested in connection with a cyber-attack which has caused days of disruption at several European airports including Heathrow.</p><p>The National Crime Agency (NCA) said a man in his forties was arrested in West Sussex \"as part of an investigation into a cyber incident impacting Collins Aerospace\".</p><p>There have been hundreds of flight delays after Collins Aerospace baggage and check-in software used by several airlines failed, with some boarding passengers using pen and paper.</p><p>\"Although this arrest is a positive step, the investigation into this incident is in its early stages and remains ongoing,\" said Paul Foster, head of the NCA's national cyber crime unit.</p></div><div><p>The man was arrested on Tuesday evening on suspicion of Computer Misuse Act offences and has been released on bail.</p><p>The BBC has seen an internal memo sent to airport staff at Heathrow about the difficulties software provider Collins Aerospace is having bringing their check-in software back online. </p><p>The US company appears to be rebuilding the system again after trying to relaunch it on Monday.</p><p>Collins Aerospace's parent company RTX Corporation told the BBC it appreciated the NCA's \"ongoing assistance in this matter\". </p><p>The US firm has not put a timeline on when it will be ready and is urging ground handlers and airlines to plan for at least another week of using manual workarounds. </p><p>At Heathrow, extra staff have been deployed in terminals to help passengers and check-in operators but flights are still experiencing delays.</p><p>On Monday, the EU's cyber-security agency said <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cqjeej85452o\">ransomware had been deployed</a> in the attack. </p><p>Ransomware is often used to seriously disrupt victims' systems and a ransom is demanded

As she tries to piece together what happened, the story jumps across generations and locations, from Japan to America and North Korea.</p><p>The judges said it's \"a family drama and geopolitical thriller about a fascinating episode from history\", adding: \"This is one of those books that completely dominates your thoughts.\"</p><p><b>Kiran Desai - The Loneliness of Sonia and Sunny</b></p><p>Desai won the Booker for The Inheritance of Loss in 2006, and is back with its long-awaited follow-up. Its 650 pages deliver an epic tale about love, ambition, family and belonging after two Indian writers who have settled in the US reconnect on an overnight train.</p><p>The judges called it \"an intimate and expansive epic about two people finding a pathway to love and each other\", adding: \"Rich in meditations about class, race and nationhood, this book has it all.\"</p><p><b>Katie Kitamura - Audition</b></p><p>The fifth novel by Kitamura is narrated by an actress who meets a man claiming to be her son, with overlapping narratives that blur the lines of the characters we play and reality. Barack and Michelle Obama's production company are making a film version starring Lucy Liu.</p><p>The judges said it's \"a brilliantly tense, taut novel that sees an actress's life turned inside out and leaves a lot open to interpretation\", adding: \"What's real? Audition makes existential detectives of us all.\"</p><p><b>Ben Markovits - The Rest of Our Lives</b></p><p>A middle-aged man leaves his home and marriage and goes on a road trip after dropping off his daughter at university. It's the 12th novel by the UK-based American writer, who was once a professional basketball player in Germany.</p><p>The judges said: \"A road trip chronicle, a book about sickness, a basketball novel, a family saga, and a story about how we say goodbye, with a ridiculously relatable narrator.\"</p><p><b>Andrew Miller - The Land in Winter</b></p><p>Miller, from Bristol, was last nominated for Oxygen in 2001, and is shortlisted again for this novel about two couples, with two pregnant women, whose lives unravel during a ferocious winter storm in the West Country in 1962.</p><p>The judges said: \"A novel about how to live, and about the tensions within marriages, set against the most dramatic winter in living memory. It's a joy to read, a nerve-shredding pleasure.\"</p><p><b>David Szalay - Flesh</b></p><p>The British-Hungarian writer's sixth novel follows the twists and turns as a shy 15-year-old boy from a Hungarian housing estate becomes a driver and security guard for London's ultra-rich. Szalay was previously nominated for All That Man Is in 2016.</p><p>The judges said: \"A novel about class ascension and a man who is remarkably detached from his desires, and a disquisition on the art of being alive. It is also an absolute page-turner.\"</p></div><div><p>Seven books from the longlist missed the cut. They were by Claire Adam, Tash Aw, Natasha Brown, Jonathan Buckley, Maria Reva, Benjamin Wood and Ledia Xhoga.</p><p>Parker said there were tough decisions about which books to lose from the longlist. \"I think it's real agony. There's nothing casual about letting a book go,\" she said. \"I think we all had a couple of books that our heart was broken [to lose].\"</p><p>The judges used a traffic light system to rate all 153 books they read over eight months - green, amber and red, depending on what they thought of them.</p><p>\"It's the most exciting day of the year every single time you get to the traffic lights,\" Parker said. \"It's like, you can't sleep the night before. It's so exciting.\"</p><p>She added that it was a privilege to have early access to so many new novels. \"I can't even describe adequately what it feels like to have an author's book in your hand, sometimes a very highly regarded established author whose book is not out yet.</p><p>\"And you know that you would be the envy of everybody if they knew that you were holding this book. And you got to read it early, and you got to talk about it with people who are so learned and themselves such extraordinary writers.\"</p><p>The jury is chaired by former Booker winner Roddy Doyle and also includes writers Kiley Reid, Chris Power and Ayọ̀bámi Adébáyọ̀.</p><p>The winner will be announced at a ceremony in London on 10 November.</p></div>"
