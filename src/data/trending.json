    "body": "<div><p>A French murder trial that opened Monday has transfixed the public because of the mystery at its core: where is the victim's body?</p><p>Cédric Jubillar, a 38 year-old painter-decorator, is accused of killing his wife Delphine nearly five years ago in a fit of jealous rage. </p><p>He has always denied the charges and, other than circumstantial evidence, investigators have struggled to build a case. There is no body, no blood, no confession, and no witness.</p><p>With its unexplained central fact and its cast of characters from small-town southern France, the affair has become a social media sensation.</p></div><div><p>Self-declared investigators have set up countless chat groups where they swap theories and share testimony – much to the irritation of police and families.</p><p>\"These groups are the equivalent of the bistro counter – but with more people,\" said psychoanalyst Patrick Avrane, author of a book on attitudes to crime.</p><p>\"Everyone constructs the theory that suits him or her the best.\"</p><p>The Jubillar mystery began at the height of Covid lockdown when – in the early hours on 16 December 2020 – Cédric Jubillar contacted the gendarmes to report that his wife had gone missing.</p><p>Delphine, who was 33 at the time, was a night nurse in a clinic not far from their home in Cagnac-les-Mines in the south-western Occitania region. The couple had two children, aged six and 18 months.</p><p>Police came to understand that the Jubillars did not have a happy relationship. </p><p>Cédric Jubillar was a habitual cannabis user and barely held down a job. Delphine was in a relationship with a man she had met over the Internet. She and Cédric were talking about divorce.</p><p>Police and locals conducted extensive searches in the surrounding countryside – with potholers descending into some of the disused mineshafts with which the area is dotted.</p><p>Delphine's body was never found, but a case was gradually built against her husband and in mid-2021 he was placed under investigation and detained.</p><p>The prosecution at the trial in the town of Albi will tell the court that Cédric Jubillar had a clear motivation to kill his wife, because of their impending split.</p><p>Lawyers will raise other points: certain odd actions by Cédric on the night of the disappearance; signs of a fight, including a pair of broken glasses; a neighbour who heard a woman screaming.</p><p>Cédric Jubillar's own character will be brought under the spotlight, with witnesses expected who will speak of his threatening language to Delphine before she disappeared, and his apparent lack of concern after.</p><p>Two of his acquaintances – a former cellmate and a former girlfriend – will also repeat what they told police: that Cédric confessed to the murder and told them where her body was.</p><p>But after more digging no body has been found, and the defence is expected to raise doubts about the veracity of the pair's accounts.</p><p>Indeed the heart of Cédric Jubillar's case is that there is nothing – beyond the popular view that he is the ideal culprit – to prove that he did away with his wife. He himself has always protested his innocence.</p><p>The trial is expected to last four weeks, with 65 witnesses called and 11 experts. More than 16,000 pages of evidence have been compiled.</p><p>Explaining the case's grip on the public mind, writer Thibault de Montaigu said in Le Figaro newspaper it was like \"a novel by Georges Simenon\" – creator of the fictional detective Inspector Maigret.</p><p>In a long analysis of the case, he said that for all the circumstantial evidence against Cédric Jubillar, the central question was this: how a \"red-eyed, fuzzy-brained guy who smoked ten joints a day could have carried out the perfect crime?</p><p>\"Killing his wife without leaving the slightest trace; secretly transporting her body, burying her in an unfindable location, then coming back to tell the police – all while his two children slept quietly in their bedrooms.</p><p>\"And this was a guy who greeted the cops in panda pyjamas and then played Game of Thrones on his phone the very morning of the disappearance.</p><p>\"So: genius bluffer; lucky fool; or poor innocent?\"</p><p>The court will decide.</p></div>"

    "body": "<div><p>The US Supreme Court has ruled President Donald Trump can dismiss a top official on the Federal Trade Commission. </p><p>In the 6-3 ruling, the justices sided with Trump, allowing him to fire Democratic Commissioner Rebecca Slaughter from her post while legal challenges continue.</p><p>It has also agreed to revisit a nearly century-old legal precedent that shields independent agencies set up by Congress from presidential interference.</p><p>Justice Elena Kagan, writing for the dissenting liberal justices, warned that the ruling allows the president to take charge of institutions Congress had intended to protect from partisanship.</p></div><div><p>\"Congress, as everyone agrees, prohibited each of those presidential removals,\" Justice Elena Kagan wrote in her dissent. \"Yet the majority, stay order by stay order, has handed full control of all those agencies to the President.\"</p><p>\"He may now remove - so says the majority, though Congress said differently - any member he wishes, for any reason or no reason at all. And he may thereby extinguish the agencies' bipartisanship and independence, \" Justice Kagan added.</p><p>The Supreme Court's Monday ruling said the justices would hear arguments in December on overturning a 1935 decision that allowed Congress to set up independent agencies insulated from political interference.</p><p>In the 90-year-old ruling known as Humphrey's Executor, the court sided with another FTC commissioner who was fired by Franklin D Roosevelt. The justices then ruled that commissioners could be removed only for misconduct or neglect of duty.</p><p>The FTC, which enforces consumer protection, typically has five commissioners - three from the president's party and two from the opposing party.</p><p>Slaughter and Alvaro Bedoya, two Democratic members of the FTC, were fired by Trump in March. </p><p>A federal judge ruled in July in favour of Slaughter, declaring her dismissal \"unlawful\" under the longstanding precedent. Bedoya later resigned, but Slaughter continued her legal battle.</p><p>Earlier this month, the Supreme Court issued a temporary order permitting Trump to proceed with the dismissal as the justices considered whether to take up the case - a move now confirmed by Monday's decision.</p><p>Separately, the court is also considering the Trump administration's request to remove Lisa Cook as a Federal Reserve governor. </p><p>Cook was fired in August after the administration accused her of committing mortgage fraud. </p><p>The governor has denied any wrongdoing, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c0ezqr7l774o\">and a federal court sided with her</a> stating the president did not have the power to remove her.</p></div>"

Costs to purchase a visa can exceed £1,000.</p><p>In his conference speech, Sir Ed will argue that the UK should be \"stepping into the vacuum left by Trump's anti-science agenda - leading the world in the fight against cancer\".</p><p>The Liberal Democrat leader is also expected to criticise Reform UK party members for applauding a US decision <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c74dzdddvmjo\">to cut research for mRNA vaccines. </a></p><p>Twenty-two projects had been examining how the vaccine technology could counter viruses such as bird flu. </p><p>Sir Ed will say: \"It is hard to express the cruelty and stupidity of cutting off research into medicine that has the power to save so many lives.\"</p></div><div><p>In addition to criticising Trump, Sir Ed has also been increasingly vocal in his attacks on the billionaire and former Trump ally Elon Musk.</p><p>On Sunday, he called on the UK's communications regulator Ofcom to \"go after\" Musk over \"crimes\" he claims are being committed on the tech mogul's social media platform X.</p><p>Sir Ed has also accused Musk of \"inciting violence\" when he addressed a rally in London via video link. In response, the X owner called the Liberal Democrat leader a \"craven coward\".</p><p>Asked by Sky News if he was worried about legal threats from Musk, Sir Ed said: \"If he ... sues me, let's see how he fares, because I don't think he'll win.\"</p><p>The Lib Dems have become well known for their political stunts alongside a policy offer focused on social care and other priorities under Sir Ed's leadership.</p><p>It brought them success at last year's general election, with the party winning 72 seats in the House of Commons - its highest ever share.</p><p>But the Lib Dems have struck a more serious tone at this year's conference, as the party considers it's next move ahead of local elections next year.</p><p>On the opening night of the conference, former Lib Dem leader Tim Farron draped himself in a flag and called on members to \"reclaim patriotism\" from the far right.</p><p>Farron told a hall full of activists to \"stop being so flaming squeamish and English\" and reclaim the UK's flags from groups who seek to \"divide and destroy\".</p><p>Unusually for the Lib Dems, they have gone out of their way to claim that they are the true patriots, in contrast to Farage, who they have dubbed a \"plastic patriot\".</p><p>In <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c33rp46nr1jo\">an interview with the BBC</a>, Sir Ed said his party has a moral duty to keep Farage and his Reform UK party out of power.</p></div>"

The crowd then praises Hamas's armed wing, the Qassam Brigades.</p><p>A Palestinian security official from the Hamas-run Gaza government told Reuters that the executions were carried out by the \"Joint Operations Room of the Palestinian resistance\".</p><p>This is a rare instance in which a public execution in Gaza has been captured on video. There have been previous reports of Hamas using violence on those who dissent. In May, Hamas-led groups reportedly executed four Palestinians for looting aid trucks.</p><p>In Sunday's footage, one armed man singles out Yasser Abu Shabab as a \"major collaborator\" who they seek to kill.</p><p>Abu Shabab is major figurehead of a clan which has reportedly been armed by the Israeli government. It has been operating in Rafah, in an area under Israeli military control. The group has presented itself as an opposition force to Hamas.</p><p>In July Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu confirmed that Israel was arming clans in Gaza that he said were opposed to Hamas. However, Yasser Abu Shabab posted online to \"categorically reject\" that Israel had supplied his group's weapons.</p><p>That same month, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c4gk79xlzwjo\">a senior officer in Hamas's security forces told the BBC</a> that the Palestinian armed group had lost much of its control over the Gaza Strip and that armed clans were filling the void.</p><p>Abu Shabab's armed group has been advertising for recruits on social media, Reuters reported. The news agency quoted residents and sources close to Hamas as saying that other groups opposed to Hamas had also emerged in parts of northern Gaza and near Khan Younis in southern Gaza.</p></div><div><p>Israeli troops meanwhile have continued to operate in Gaza City. The Israeli military said troops had \"dismantled military infrastructure used by Hamas\" and killed a Hamas cell that had attacked Israeli soldiers, wounding an officer.</p><p>It has said its objectives are to free the hostages still held by Hamas and defeat up to 3,000 fighters in what it has described as the group's \"main stronghold\".</p><p>However, the offensive on Gaza's biggest urban area, where one million people were living and a famine was confirmed last month, has drawn widespread international condemnation.</p><p>Last week a spokeswoman for the UN's humanitarian office said she had seen a constant stream of Palestinians heading south during a recent visit to the city, but that hundreds of thousands remained in the city. She described <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c5y8l46m5evo\">the situation in the city as \"cataclysmic\"</a>.</p><p>The Israeli military launched a campaign in Gaza in response to the Hamas-led attack on southern Israel on 7 October 2023, in which about 1,200 people were killed and 251 others were taken hostage.</p><p>At least 65,344 people have been killed in Israeli attacks in Gaza since then, according to the territory's Hamas-run health ministry.</p></div>"

    "body": "<div><p><b>Born with a serious eye condition, England goalkeeper Hannah Hampton was told by doctors she should not play football.</b></p><p>The 24-year-old has had multiple operations to try to correct her vision but it is not perfect and she still has depth perception issues.</p><p>It is remarkable she has defied the odds.</p><p>Having played a big part in Chelsea's domestic treble in 2024-25, followed by her penalty shootout heroics to help England win Euro 2025, Hampton was <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/articles/c5yv9e105eno\">named the best female keeper of the year</a> at Monday's Ballon d'Or ceremony.</p><p>\"I've always gone through life trying to prove people wrong,\" she said before the Euros.</p><p>\"I was told from a young age that I couldn't play football, that it wouldn't be a profession I could pursue. But here I am.\"</p><p>Collecting the Yashin Trophy, Hampton said: \"I stand on the shoulders of so many great goalkeepers of the past.</p><p>\"Sitting alongside my fellow nominees, I'm proud to be a part of such an incredible group and inspiring future generations of goalkeepers coming through and training so hard.\"</p><p>Hampton has been used to setbacks and her career has been far from smooth.</p><p>She was dropped by England months after being part of the winning Euro 2022 squad.</p><p>She was forced to prove herself again and has bounced back and risen to the top. This is the story of her journey.</p></div><div><p></p><h2 id=\"She-was-born-to-be-a-footballer\"><span>'She was born to be a footballer'</span></h2><p></p></div><div><p>When Carla Ward arrived at Birmingham City as their new manager in 2020 she had already heard about teenager Hampton.</p><p>\"We spoke on the first day. I wanted to know where she wanted to be,\" Ward told BBC Sport. </p><p>\"She was an endearing character, as well as being a livewire, like most goalkeepers. But she articulated things in a way that was far more mature than her age. </p><p>\"It was on day two that I really saw what everyone was talking about. She was one of the most talented individuals I've ever worked with. </p><p>\"Everyone has different talents but she was born to be a footballer.\"</p><p>Hampton's love for football developed in Spain, where she moved with her family at the age of five and learned to speak the language fluently during her five years living there.</p><p>She was scouted by Villarreal's academy after former Argentine defender Fabio Fuentes recommended Hampton go to a club trial. </p><p>On her return to England, she joined Stoke City's academy before eventually breaking into the first team at Birmingham City at the age of 16 - switching positions from a striker to a goalkeeper.</p><p>She was already well known in England's youth team set-ups and her international manager at the time, Rehanne Skinner, had seen her talent up close.</p><p>\"She played with both feet. There are very few people in the game who can play off their weaker foot and hit it 60 yards with pinpoint accuracy,\" said Skinner.</p><p>During an England Under-19s game against Sweden, Skinner instructed Hampton to do one thing - hit it long.</p><p>\"Hannah got an assist within the first 10 minutes of the game. We won 4-0. Not a lot of goalkeepers have those tools,\" said Skinner.</p><p>\"As time has gone on, with maturity, being in the right settings and doing a lot of work behind the scenes, she has grown and put her attention into using those strengths to the best of her ability.\"</p><p>Ask anyone about Hampton and they all say the same thing - that she is technically gifted and excellent with the ball at her feet. </p><p>Former Birmingham and England team-mate Ellen White said Hampton would get involved in <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.englandfootball.com/articles/2023/Jan/17/what-is-rondo-england-players-20230117\">'rondos'<span>, external</span></a> in training and playing outfield \"wasn't alien\" to her.</p><p>But when Hampton revealed the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/59416582\">extent of her eye condition</a> - called strabismus - in the media, White admitted it was \"probably a shock to a lot of people\".</p><p>\"She probably has to adapt a bit to combat it, but you wouldn't ever know if you saw her training. She is crazy and would throw herself at anything,\" added White.</p><p>\"Her passing range is second to none, the way she moves and dives, and controls the ball. She's up there as one of the most exciting young goalkeepers in world football. </p><p>\"Maybe she helped influence other people who thought they couldn't be a goalkeeper.\"</p></div><div><p></p><h2 id=\"Ive-proven-people-wrong\"><span>'I've proven people wrong'</span></h2><p></p></div><div><p>Like all young players thrust into the limelight, White admitted Hampton was a \"little immature\" when they first played together at Birmingham.</p><p>\"Her emotions would take hold of her a lot, which they would do for any 16-year-old, and it was about dealing with the ups and downs,\" she said.</p><p>\"You won't save a goal every time. Managing her emotions needed time, experience and understanding. </p><p>\"I tried to take her under my wing a little bit and give her that guidance. I felt at that time she would be a very good goalkeeper but she needed some help.\"</p><p>Hampton rose through England's ranks, making her senior debut against future world champions Spain in 2022. </p><p>She made the squad for Euro 2022 but months after celebrating victory - often seen dancing with White during laps of honour - her career hit a stumbling block. </p><p>Reports suggested she was dropped from the England squad because of her behaviour and she had to wait until March 2023 for a recall, when manager Sarina Wiegman said Hampton had \"sorted out personal issues\".</p><p>Speaking about that time, Hampton said the stories were \"hurtful\" and she <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://open.spotify.com/episode/1KqTj92oEc37kuKIb2d2Us\">revealed on the Fozcast podcast<span>, external</span></a> that she had considered quitting football.</p><p>\"I was a very young girl when all the stories came out and you're not really prepared for that. You don't expect it,\" she said.</p><p>\"There have been moments when everyone [in the squad] has probably thought they were in a tough position, but you get each other out of it.</p><p>\"You can't let all the media scrutiny win. If you do that it just adds fuel to the fire and I wasn't willing to accept that. </p><p>\"I wanted to show who I am as a person and show that wasn't always true. I thought 'just dig in'. I think I can say that I've proven people wrong.\"</p><p>Ward managed Hampton at Aston Villa at the time, having brought her with her from Birmingham.</p><p>She fielded questions about Hampton's situation in news conferences and left the goalkeeper out of the squad against Chelsea for the \"best interests\" of the team.</p><p>\"We had an aligned agreement between Sarina, myself and Hannah on how we would help her with it,\" said Ward, reflecting on the time. </p><p>\"It was a difficult time for Hannah but it was probably a moment that really helped her. It was the moment she realised she had good support around her. </p><p>\"She was a young kid that just really needed support.\"</p><p>White, who captained England for Hampton's debut, retired from international football just before she was dropped from the squad.</p><p>But White believed Hampton \"just needed time\" to mature and felt she did that under former Chelsea manager Emma Hayes when she joined them in 2023. </p><p>Having \"an arm around her shoulders\" helped, said White, as well as the drive to become Chelsea's number one and get another shot on the international stage.</p><p>\"It's obviously not ideal not being selected for England. A lot of things transpired. Fair play to her because she did just get her head down and work hard,\" said White.</p><p>\"She just had to rebuild some of those relationships and gain them back in the England squad. I feel like she let her football do the talking.</p><p>\"Everyone goes through ups and downs, rollercoaster emotions and going in and out of the squads. I am really proud of her.\"</p></div>"

It has not yet commented on Kimmel's reinstatement. </p><p>Critics and First Amendment advocates railed against ABC's decision last week as censorship and a violation of free speech. </p><p>Kimmel, who has hosted the late-night programme since 2003 and hosted four Oscars ceremonies, has not yet publicly addressed the suspension or the fallout. </p><p>The row started after Kimmel said in his monologue on 15 September that the \"Maga gang\" were \"desperately trying to characterise this kid who murdered Charlie Kirk as anything other than one of them\" and trying to \"score political points from it\".</p><p>He also made fun of Trump's reaction to the influencer's murder, showing a clip of the president responding to a question about how he was mourning the death by changing the subject to construction of a new White House ballroom.  </p><p>Kimmel compared the response to \"how a four-year-old mourns a goldfish\".</p><p>Brendan Carr, the Trump-appointed chair of broadcast regulator the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c87yel3wgqgo\">Federal Communications Commission (FCC</a>), threatened to act against ABC and its parent company Disney over Kimmel's remarks. </p><p>The spat comes as Vice President JD Vance and other White House allies have been pushing a national campaign to punish anyone who has criticised Kirk in the wake of his death. </p><p>Hours after Mr Carr made his initial remarks about Kimmel's monologue, Nexstar said it would not air Kimmel's show \"for the foreseeable future\".</p><p>Sinclair followed suit and ABC announced that it would \"indefinitely\" suspend the programme <b>and demanded an apology from Kimmel, as well as a donation to Kirk's non-profit organization Turning Point USA.</b></p><p>Mr Carr thanked Nexstar \"for doing the right thing\" and said he hoped other broadcasters would follow its lead. Nexstar is currently seeking FCC approval for its planned $6.2bn (£4.5bn) merger with Tegna.</p><p>Anna Gomez, the sole Democrat on the FCC, said on Monday that she was \"glad to see Disney find its courage in the face of clear government intimidation\".</p><p>Ms Gomez also thanked Americans across the ideological spectrum who protested \"this blatant attempt to silence free speech\" and vowed to \"combat these efforts to stifle free expression\".</p><p><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c203n52x1y9o\">ABC's decision</a> to suspend Kimmel<b> </b>was met with protests in California and lambasted by the writers and actors guilds, lawmakers and the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) alike, who argued that the suspension violates free speech rights and spurs a chilling effect.</p><p>Kimmel's late-night colleagues, including Jon Stewart, John Oliver and outgoing CBS host Stephen Colbert, rallied behind him and hundreds of celebrities and Hollywood creatives <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c62le8q959yo\">signed on to a letter</a> backing Kimmel. </p><p>Ben Stiller, Jennifer Aniston, Meryl Streep and Robert DeNiro are among those who called Kimmel's suspension a \"dark moment for freedom of speech in our nation\".</p><p>Critics have also called for the cancellation of Disney+, Hulu and other Disney-owned subscription services to cut into the entertainment conglomerate's bottom line over it decision to suspend Kimmel.</p></div>"
