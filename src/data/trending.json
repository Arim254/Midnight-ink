Picture date: Tuesday September 23, 2025. PA Photo.\" /><span>PA Media</span></p></div></figure><div><p>Sir Ed Davey's speech to close the Liberal Democrat conference was punchy.</p><p>Here was a leader knowingly painting in primary colours and determined to be heard in our noisy politics.</p><p>This was a gathering of a party willing to double down on being more aggressive in making its arguments - in particular, its focus on the Reform leader Nigel Farage.</p><p>By my count there were at least 30 references to Farage – far, far more than to the prime minister or the Conservatives.</p><p>Senior Liberal Democrats spot an opportunity right now: a willingness to take on Reform and Donald Trump in a way Labour and the Tories either can't or won't.</p><p>And the party is using the Reform leader as a funding and recruiting sergeant.</p></div><div><p>They hope the prospect of a Farage premiership will motivate their activists, in efforts and donations, in a way a prospective Labour or Conservative victory might not do.</p><p>But the Lib Dems realise too that Reform's rise has a cost when it comes to a squeeze on the attention paid to Sir Ed Davey and his team, hence their noisy protests and allegations - repeated again by Sir Ed in his speech - about the relative coverage and scrutiny different parties receive from the BBC and others.</p><p>The corporation, incidentally, said \"these continuing attacks on BBC journalism are completely groundless – it is simply false to say that we give any political party any less scrutiny than any other\".</p><p>The Lib Dems also didn't remove a reference to the prospect of the UK's gun laws changing under a Reform government, despite Reform making it clear before the speech was delivered, but after the script had been shared with reporters, that they had no intention of changing the law.</p><p>When I asked if it was irresponsible or scaremongering to suggest schools might have to \"teach our children what to do in case of a mass shooting,\" they argued it is about holding Nigel Farage to account for remarks he made 11 years ago.</p><p>Reform accused him of \"spouting total madness\".</p><p>I'd say the mood of the Liberal Democrats felt chipper, but business-like.</p><p>This time last year, just after a stonkingly good general election result for them, their conference felt like a non-stop party.</p><p>Not so now. The political landscape has changed and changed quickly.</p></div><p></p><h2>Ed Davey's pitch</h2><p></p><div><p>The Lib Dems are far from the only ones seeking to adjust and adjust quickly.</p><p>Part of their strategy is to extend their appeal towards recent Conservative voters unattracted by both Reform and Kemi Badenoch's leadership of the Tories.</p><p>Sir Ed Davey's pitch was both direct - \"my message to you is this: come and talk to us\" - and also packaged in the language of a former Conservative prime minister.</p><p>The Lib Dem leader talked of \"male voice choirs and Hogmanay, county shows and school fairs, fish and chips, village greens and cricket pavilions\".</p><p>It reminded me of Sir John Major's words more than three decades ago:</p><p>\"Fifty years from now Britain will still be the country of long shadows on county grounds, warm beer, invincible green suburbs, dog lovers and pools fillers and - as George Orwell said - 'old maids bicycling to Holy Communion through the morning mist' - and if we get our way, Shakespeare still read even in school.\"</p><p>Both men, today and in 1993, are attempting to portray a pride in what they see as an understated patriotism and respect for traditions, a small c conservatism.</p><p>The Liberal Democrats hope they can be seen to represent the clearest and most authentic big party antidote to Reform.</p><p>And they are buoyed by internal polling suggesting more people are at least open to voting Lib Dem than for any other party right now.</p><p>But their challenge is they face a new and noisy rival in Reform for the protest votes of those put off by both the Conservatives and Labour.</p><p>They have grounds to hope and to worry in this increasingly competitive, noisy and fluid politics – and a determination not to be squeezed out of the conversation.</p></div></article>"

The subsequent review found not all safety standards had been met, forcing the trust to repay all the money it had received.</p><p>\"The repayment of the award is long overdue and should be going back even further,\" said Fiona Winser-Ramm, who lost her daughter Aliona in 2020 after what an inquest found to be a number of \"gross failures\" in the care they received.</p><p>\"This provides yet further evidence for the need for a full, independent inquiry into the Leeds trust,\" she said, believing this should be led by senior midwife Donna Ockenden.</p><p>Mrs Winser-Ramm was among a group of parents who met Health Secretary Wes Streeting last week and demanded an investigation into maternity services at the trust. </p><p>Streeting has so far refused to order such an inquiry but the families, who have all experienced poor maternity care, said they remained hopeful. </p><p>Over the past few months, dozens of families have told the BBC they received inadequate care at the trust.</p></div><div><p>The Maternity Incentive Scheme has been beset by problems since it was set up in 2018 by the then health secretary, Jeremy Hunt. </p><p>NHS trusts with poor maternity safety records, including Shrewsbury and Telford, Morecambe Bay, East Kent and Nottingham have all claimed to have met the 10 standards and been paid millions of pounds only to later have to repay it. </p><p>An analysis published by NHS Resolution in July found 24 trusts have had to repay premiums over the first four years of the scheme, with 18 of them having to do so more than once.</p><p>\"Nationally, families have long raised concerns about the huge flaws of the self- assessment involved by individual trusts in the maternity incentive scheme,\" said Mrs Winser-Ramm.  </p><p>\"Serious questions need to be asked about how, if trusts are unable to accurately self-report compliance, how satisfied can we be that similar misreporting is not commonplace in other areas of self-reporting.\"</p><p>After the review found Leeds had to repay the money it had received, the trust applied to a separate fund run by NHS Resolution for maternity improvement support and was allocated £2.1m.</p><p>In a statement to the BBC, the Leeds Teaching Hospitals NHS Trust did not explain how it had erroneously self-reported that it was compliant with all the standards of the scheme.</p><p>\"We identified that we were not fully compliant with the MIS scheme,\" said Magnus Harrison, the trust's chief medical officer. </p><p>\"We have now been allocated £2.1m to support our action plan to achieve compliance, which forms part of our Maternity and Neonatal Improvement Programme.\"</p></div>"

The 21-year-old is now sharing a bedroom with her 10-year-old sister.</p><p>Leoni is one of a growing number of young people who now say it is the rising cost of running a home that means they can't afford to buy or rent their own place, industry experts warn.</p><p>Nine out of 10 young adults living with parents in the UK would face costs of nearly half their income if they moved out, figures from property and finance firm the Skipton Group suggest.</p></div><div><p>While she gets on well with her mum and her sister Leoni says \"it just doesn't feel like it's my place.\"</p><p>\"It's not great in terms of not being able to see my partner, not having the life that we had, having to take that massive step back from the independence that I had. I just don't think it's fair.\"</p><p>But she felt she had no choice: \"Being able to afford running a home, it's just insane,\" she says.</p><p>\"When I first moved in I did have some savings ready, by the time we'd moved out they'd gone.\"</p><p>\"I'd say the main problems were the utilities, council tax, and rent,\" she says.</p></div><p></p><h2>Adults living with parents</h2><p></p><div><p>In 2011, there were 4.2m adults living with parents while not in education or caring for a relative. By 2021 that figure had risen to 4.9m, according to the Office for National Statistics.</p><p>Skipton Group commissioned research for its biannual<b> </b>Home Affordability Index, compiled by Oxford Economics. </p><p>It uses Office for National Statistics and house price data alongside a survey of 2,000 adults who are living with their parents to help understand why.</p></div><div><p>The data shared exclusively with the BBC suggested nearly 98% of adults living with their parents could not afford to pay what the average first-time buyer pays for a house in their area. </p><p>Even if they could afford a deposit, nine in 10 would face mortgage or rent payments, council tax, utility bills, insurance and maintenance costs that would use up nearly half of their income. If they bought a flat, that figure falls to eight in 10.</p><p>These calculations are based on one person buying alone and in the same local authority as their parents.</p><p>Stuart Haire,<b> </b>chief executive of the Skipton Group, says many young people move out nearby to stay close to their workplaces and friendship networks.</p><p>\"My heart goes out to them.

After 23 months of war, it now lies in ruins, pockmarked by craters, with burned-out wards and bullet holes.</p><p>But inside medics are working beyond full stretch. Many of the beds do not even have mattresses, medicines are in short supply and the casualties are endless.</p><p>\"It's just a mass murder, a killing, a torture, a nightmare,\" Dr Nada Abu Alrub, an emergency specialist from Australia volunteering at the hospital, told the BBC in a video call on Tuesday.</p><p>She said they were operating on severely wounded patients with \"minimal to hardly no anaesthesia\".</p><p>\"No painkillers as well, with their limbs hanging with a piece of skin and the tendon. Brain matter out. Organs are out. It's horrific,\" she added.</p><p>Last week, she said, doctors had to conduct an emergency Caesarean on a nine-month pregnant woman whose head had been blown off. They managed to save her daughter.</p><p>\"The baby was a bit bradycardic, so her heart rate was low,\" she recalled. \"She was transferred to another hospital.\"</p><p>Dr Saya Aziz, an Australian anaesthetist, described how a six-year-old boy with a fractured arm and leg had been waiting for three days for an operation to place external fixators on them because the hospital's only orthopaedic surgeon had to prioritise more serious cases.</p><p>\"Every couple of hours there are multiple amputation cases with massive resuscitation. It's life or limb, literally,\" she told the BBC.</p><p>\"And you go in and you're trying to anaesthetise them [while] they're swatting flies in theatre.</p><p>\"There's blood over the beds. There's no equipment. There's no replacements. And you can see the sorrow and the sadness of the healthcare workers.\"</p></div><div><p>Outside the hospital, Israel's tanks are advancing, as the ground offensive against Hamas in Gaza City continues.</p><p>One video posted on social media showed a tank at Hamid junction in the Rimal neighbourhood, which is less than 500m from al-Shifa.</p><p>Another video showed troops to the south, only 700m from the city centre.</p><p>Palestinian journalist Fathi Sabah, who lives in southern Gaza but owns an apartment in the city's southern Tal al-Hawa neighbourhood, said members of his family had narrowly escaped an Israeli incursion.</p><p>\"My wife and son went to our flat to collect some belongings. They suddenly found themselves trapped as tanks surrounded the area,\" he said.</p><p>\"They lived through the hardest night of their lives before escaping through a back door. It's unbelievable how quickly the tanks reached the heart of the city.\"</p><p>Around one million Palestinians were estimated to be living in Gaza City before Israel announced its plans for the offensive last month.</p><p>The UN says more than 320,000 have fled southwards since then, while the Israeli military puts the figure at 640,000.</p><p>The Israeli military has told people to head south for their safety to a designated \"humanitarian area\" in al-Mawasi, where it has said medical care, water and food will be provided.</p><p>However, witnesses say the coastal al-Rashid road is severely congested and that families are struggling for hours to complete the journey.</p><p>The cost of evacuation has also reportedly soared to more than $3,000 (£2,200) per family - far beyond the reach of most residents.</p><p>The UN has also said the tent camps in al-Mawasi are overcrowded and unsafe, and that southern hospitals are operating at several times their capacity.</p><p>\"The tanks are only a few metres from my house but I cannot afford the cost of fleeing,\" Sultan Nassar, a 62-year-old father of five from the Sabra neighbourhood, told the BBC. \"Death is everywhere, in the north and in the south.\"</p><p>The Palestine Red Crescent Society said the oxygen station at al-Quds hospital in Tal al-Hawa had ceased operating after being struck by gunfire from Israeli forces, and that it only had enough pre-filled oxygen cylinders to last three days.</p><p>Israeli military vehicles were currently positioned at the southern gate of the hospital, preventing anyone from entering or leaving, it added.</p><p>On Monday, Gaza's Hamas-run health ministry said the Israeli advance and bombardment had forced al-Rantisi children's hospital and the nearby St John Eye hospital in the northern Nasr neighbourhood to evacuate patients and shut down.</p><p>The Jordanian armed forces also decided to close their field hospital in Tal al-Hawa and relocate it to southern Gaza, with Jordan's state news agency reporting that shelling and other intense explosions in the vicinity had damaged the facility and some medical equipment.</p><p>The Palestinian Medical Relief Society's primary healthcare centre in Gaza City was destroyed in an Israeli air strike which reportedly injured two health workers, the World Health Organization said. The centre was providing blood services, trauma care, cancer medications, and chronic disease treatment.</p><p>The Israeli military launched a campaign in Gaza in response to the Hamas-led attack on southern Israel on 7 October 2023, in which about 1,200 people were killed and 251 others were taken hostage.</p><p>At least 65,382 people have been killed in Israeli attacks in Gaza since then, according to the territory's health ministry.</p></div>"

    "body": "<article><div><div><p>6 hours ago</p></div><p><span><p><span>James Landale</span><span>Diplomatic correspondent, New York</span></p></span></p></div><p></p><figcaption>From escalators to teleprompters, Trump piles on criticism at the UN</figcaption><p></p><div><p>Donald Trump's speech to the United Nations was one of the clearest expositions of the way he sees the world, his ideology in its rawest form. </p><p>To his supporters, it will be seen as Trumpism unplugged; to his critics, Trumpism unhinged.</p><p>Over almost an hour, he took aim at his opponents and their ideas, picking them off one by one as he toured the world. He began at home, praising the United States and himself. He said the US was living through a golden age and repeated his much-disputed claim that he had personally ended seven wars, something he argued merited a Nobel Peace Prize.</p><p>But then the president laid into his hosts. The UN, he said, had not helped his peace-making. He questioned the organisation's purpose, saying it had tremendous potential but was not living up to that. All it did, he claimed, was write strongly worded letters that it did not follow up. Empty words, he said, did not end wars. </p><p>He also attacked the UN for the aid it gave to asylum seekers hoping to enter the US, saying \"The UN is supposed to stop invasions, not create them and not finance them.\" The president even attacked the UN for a broken escalator and teleprompter that disrupted his visit and speech.</p><p>On one level, he has a point. Many analysts question the effectiveness of the UN in resolving conflict these days, pointing in particular to gridlock in the Security Council and the body's unresponsive bureaucracy. </p></div><div><p>But on another level Trump can be seen himself a cause and symptom of the UN's lack of effectiveness; for he believes global crises are best resolved by powerful men like him getting together and hammering out a deal, not using multilateral bodies like the UN to work out collective solutions. Under Trump, the US has withdrawn much of its UN funding, leaving the body forced to cut its humanitarian work around the world.</p><p>Trump saved perhaps his biggest criticism for his European allies, attacking the continent for investing in renewable energy, and opening its borders to migration. </p><p>\"Europe is in serious trouble. They have been invaded by a force of illegal aliens like nobody has ever seen before… Both the immigration and suicidal energy ideas will be the death of Western Europe,\" he said.</p><p>Climate change, he claimed to audible gasps, was \"the greatest con job ever perpetrated on the world\" and was lumbering European countries with expensive energy costs compared to fossil fuels. He criticised in particular the UK government for imposing new taxes on North Sea oil.</p><p>\"If you don't get away from the green energy scam, your country is going to fail,\" he said.</p><p>\"I love Europe. I love the people of Europe. And I hate to see it being devastated by energy and immigration. This double-tailed monster destroys everything in its wake… you want to be politically correct and you are destroying your heritage.\"</p><p>Note that last point. It echoes what the president said during his state visit to the UK last week when he spoke of the importance of defending the values of what he called \"the English-speaking world\". </p></div><p></p><figcaption>Watch: How Trump lashed out at Europe in his UN speech</figcaption><p></p><div><p>There is a cultural edge to Mr Trump's criticism of Europe, a sense that he believes uncontrolled immigration is threatening what he sees as Europe's Judeo Christian heritage. Not for nothing is Trump the leader of an administration that wears its religion firmly on its sleeve. \"Let us protect religious liberty,\" he told the UN, \"including for the most persecuted religion on the planet today – it's called Christianity.\"</p><p>On a specific point of policy, the most substantive warning Trump gave related to Russia's war on Ukraine. He said President Putin's refusal to end the conflict was \"not making Russia look good\". He said the US was prepared \"to impose a very strong round of powerful tariffs\" to end the bloodshed. But he said European nations had to stop buying Russian energy, claiming he only found out two weeks ago that some were doing so. </p><p>In practice, Hungary and Slovakia are the only substantive European buyers of Russian oil. Diplomats say Mr Trump is hiding behind this so he does not have to impose secondary sanctions on India and China which are both buying huge amounts of cheap Russian energy, both of whom were cited by Trump.</p><p>Perhaps more important than his speech was Trump's social media post a short while later where he asserted for the first time Ukraine could be in a position to <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c07vm35rryeo\">win back all of its territory</a>. </p><p>His dismissal of Russia as a \"paper tiger\" and not a \"real military power\" will hurt President Putin, who is sensitive to any suggestion his country is not a global player. Diplomats said this was the latest example of Mr Trump's journey towards a position that is more critical of Russia.</p><p>But one should always treat Trump's words with a pinch of salt. He was being optimistic only moments after meeting Ukraine's President Zelensky at the UN. </p><p>And he said Ukraine could win back territory with EU and Nato support; there was no mention of the US involvement. All the evidence of the last few years is that this is a war of slow attrition and Ukraine would not retake land from Russia without massive US military support.</p><p>So this was undiluted Trump; a defence of America and the nation state, an assault on multilateralism and globalism, a stream of consciousness with questionable assertions. </p><p>Six years ago Trump's audience at the UN laughed at his at times unfactual assertions; this year they listened largely in silence. </p><p>\"I am really good at this stuff,\" he told world leaders. \"Your countries are going to hell.\"</p></div></article>"

Romania, another Nato member, also said Russian drones breached its airspace.</p><p>After meeting on Tuesday, Nato issued a statement condemning Russia's actions and warned that it would use \"all necessary military and non-military tools\" to defend itself.</p><p>\"Russia bears full responsibility for these actions, which are escalatory, risk miscalculation and endanger lives.

    "body": "<div><div><p>7 hours ago</p></div><p><span><p><span>Ian Youngs</span><span>Culture reporter</span></p></span></p></div><div><p>Actress Sarah Jessica Parker has said she and the other judges of this year's Booker Prize had \"real agony\" deciding which novels to include on the shortlist, but taking part in the process has been a \"privilege\".</p><p>The Sex and the City star is among the five judges who have whittled down the 13-strong longlist to the six books that will compete for the prestigious literary award.</p><p>The shortlist includes Indian-born author Kiran Desai, 19 years after she won the prize, as well as past nominees Andrew Miller and David Szalay.</p><p>A trio of US writers - Susan Choi, Katie Kitamura and Ben Markovits - will also be up for the prize when the winner is announced in November.</p></div><div><p><b>Susan Choi - Flashlight</b></p><p>Choi's sixth novel starts with a 10-year-old girl taking a walk on a beach with her father, then waking up alone on the shore, with her dad presumed drowned. As she tries to piece together what happened, the story jumps across generations and locations, from Japan to America and North Korea.</p><p>The judges said it's \"a family drama and geopolitical thriller about a fascinating episode from history\", adding: \"This is one of those books that completely dominates your thoughts.\"</p><p><b>Kiran Desai - The Loneliness of Sonia and Sunny</b></p><p>Desai won the Booker for The Inheritance of Loss in 2006, and is back with its long-awaited follow-up. Its 650 pages deliver an epic tale about love, ambition, family and belonging after two Indian writers who have settled in the US reconnect on an overnight train.</p><p>The judges called it \"an intimate and expansive epic about two people finding a pathway to love and each other\", adding: \"Rich in meditations about class, race and nationhood, this book has it all.\"</p><p><b>Katie Kitamura - Audition</b></p><p>The fifth novel by Kitamura is narrated by an actress who meets a man claiming to be her son, with overlapping narratives that blur the lines of the characters we play and reality. Barack and Michelle Obama's production company are making a film version starring Lucy Liu.</p><p>The judges said it's \"a brilliantly tense, taut novel that sees an actress's life turned inside out and leaves a lot open to interpretation\", adding: \"What's real? Audition makes existential detectives of us all.\"</p><p><b>Ben Markovits - The Rest of Our Lives</b></p><p>A middle-aged man leaves his home and marriage and goes on a road trip after dropping off his daughter at university. It's the 12th novel by the UK-based American writer, who was once a professional basketball player in Germany.</p><p>The judges said: \"A road trip chronicle, a book about sickness, a basketball novel, a family saga, and a story about how we say goodbye, with a ridiculously relatable narrator.\"</p><p><b>Andrew Miller - The Land in Winter</b></p><p>Miller, from Bristol, was last nominated for Oxygen in 2001, and is shortlisted again for this novel about two couples, with two pregnant women, whose lives unravel during a ferocious winter storm in the West Country in 1962.</p><p>The judges said: \"A novel about how to live, and about the tensions within marriages, set against the most dramatic winter in living memory. It's a joy to read, a nerve-shredding pleasure.\"</p><p><b>David Szalay - Flesh</b></p><p>The British-Hungarian writer's sixth novel follows the twists and turns as a shy 15-year-old boy from a Hungarian housing estate becomes a driver and security guard for London's ultra-rich. Szalay was previously nominated for All That Man Is in 2016.</p><p>The judges said: \"A novel about class ascension and a man who is remarkably detached from his desires, and a disquisition on the art of being alive. It is also an absolute page-turner.\"</p></div><div><p>Seven books from the longlist missed the cut. They were by Claire Adam, Tash Aw, Natasha Brown, Jonathan Buckley, Maria Reva, Benjamin Wood and Ledia Xhoga.</p><p>Parker said there were tough decisions about which books to lose from the longlist. \"I think it's real agony. There's nothing casual about letting a book go,\" she said. \"I think we all had a couple of books that our heart was broken [to lose].\"</p><p>The judges used a traffic light system to rate all 153 books they read over eight months - green, amber and red, depending on what they thought of them.</p><p>\"It's the most exciting day of the year every single time you get to the traffic lights,\" Parker said. \"It's like, you can't sleep the night before. It's so exciting.\"</p><p>She added that it was a privilege to have early access to so many new novels. \"I can't even describe adequately what it feels like to have an author's book in your hand, sometimes a very highly regarded established author whose book is not out yet.</p><p>\"And you know that you would be the envy of everybody if they knew that you were holding this book. And you got to read it early, and you got to talk about it with people who are so learned and themselves such extraordinary writers.\"</p><p>The jury is chaired by former Booker winner Roddy Doyle and also includes writers Kiley Reid, Chris Power and Ayọ̀bámi Adébáyọ̀.</p><p>The winner will be announced at a ceremony in London on 10 November.</p></div>"
