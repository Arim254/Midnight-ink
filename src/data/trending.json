He was arrested nearby.</p></div><div><p>Routh attempted to harm himself after the verdict was read out and the jury had left the room, according to the BBC's US partner, CBS News. </p><p>Media inside the room reported that US Marshals then intervened.  </p><p>In a social media post immediately after the verdict, Trump thanked law enforcement and a witness who provided information that led to Routh's arrest. </p><p>Trump said of Routh: \"This was an evil man with an evil intention, and they caught him. A very big moment for JUSTICE IN AMERICA!\".</p><p>Attorney General Pamela Bondi said: \"This attempted assassination was not only an attack on our president, but an affront to our very nation itself.\"</p><p>Routh pleaded not guilty and made the unusual decision to defend himself during the trial, which began on 8 September and played out at the federal courthouse in Fort Pierce, Florida.</p><p>A North Carolina native who lived in Hawaii prior to the Florida incident, Routh made a series of bizarre steps and statements throughout the proceedings. </p><p>Those included challenging Trump to a game of golf; requesting access to a putting green; and delivering an opening statement that touched on the history of human evolution, the \"need to be kind to one another\", and references to Adolf Hitler and Vladimir Putin. The judge cut his opening remarks short. </p></div><div><p>The court heard that during the assassination attempt, Routh hid in bushes behind a perimeter fence at the Trump International Golf Club.</p><p>He is not believed to have had a clear line of sight to Trump at any point, but agents with the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) said they found a semiautomatic rifle with a scope and extended magazine where he was hiding.</p><p>The court also heard that Routh left behind a list of places where Trump was expected to appear, and a note for a friend stating \"this was an assassination attempt on Donald Trump\". </p><p>It was the second high-profile attempt on Trump's life that year, after a gunman opened fire during a political rally in Butler, Pennsylvania in July 2024. </p><p>That shooting left one person dead and injured multiple others, including Trump. The shooter was also killed at the scene. </p></div>"

    "body": "<div><div><p>35 minutes ago</p></div><p><span><p><span>James Landale</span><span>Diplomatic correspondent, New York</span></p></span></p></div><div><p>Donald Trump's speech to the United Nations was one of the clearest expositions of the way he sees the world, his ideology in its rawest form. </p><p>To his supporters, it will be seen as Trumpism unplugged; to his critics, Trumpism unhinged.</p><p>Over almost an hour, he took aim at his opponents and their ideas, picking them off one by one as he toured the world. He began at home, praising the United States and himself. He said the US was living through a golden age and repeated his much-disputed claim that he had personally ended seven wars, something he argued merited a Nobel Peace Prize.</p><p>But then the president laid into his hosts. The UN, he said, had not helped his peace-making. He questioned the organisation's purpose, saying it had tremendous potential but was not living up to that. All it did, he claimed, was write strongly worded letters that it did not follow up. Empty words, he said, did not end wars. </p><p>He also attacked the UN for the aid it gave to asylum seekers hoping to enter the US, saying \"The UN is supposed to stop invasions, not create them and not finance them.\" The president even attacked the UN for a broken escalator and teleprompter that disrupted his visit and speech.</p><p>On one level, he has a point. Many analysts question the effectiveness of the UN in resolving conflict these days, pointing in particular to gridlock in the Security Council and the body's unresponsive bureaucracy. </p></div><div><p>But on another level Trump can be seen himself a cause and symptom of the UN's lack of effectiveness; for he believes global crises are best resolved by powerful men like him getting together and hammering out a deal, not using multilateral bodies like the UN to work out collective solutions. Under Trump, the US has withdrawn much of its UN funding, leaving the body forced to cut its humanitarian work around the world.</p><p>Trump saved perhaps his biggest criticism for his European allies, attacking the continent for investing in renewable energy, and opening its borders to migration. </p><p>\"Europe is in serious trouble. They have been invaded by a force of illegal aliens like nobody has ever seen before… Both the immigration and suicidal energy ideas will be the death of Western Europe,\" he said.</p><p>Climate change, he claimed to audible gasps, was \"the greatest con job ever perpetrated on the world\" and was lumbering European countries with expensive energy costs compared to fossil fuels. He criticised in particular the UK government for imposing new taxes on North Sea oil.</p><p>\"If you don't get away from the green energy scam, your country is going to fail,\" he said.</p><p>\"I love Europe. I love the people of Europe. And I hate to see it being devastated by energy and immigration. This double-tailed monster destroys everything in its wake… you want to be politically correct and you are destroying your heritage.\"</p><p>Note that last point. It echoes what the president said during his state visit to the UK last week when he spoke of the importance of defending the values of what he called \"the English-speaking world\". </p><p>There is a cultural edge to Mr Trump's criticism of Europe, a sense that he believes uncontrolled immigration is threatening Europe's heritage. Not for nothing is Trump the leader of an administration that wears its religion firmly on its sleeve. \"Let us protect religious liberty,\" he told the UN, \"including for the most persecuted religion on the planet today – it's called Christianity.\"</p><p>On a specific point of policy, the most substantive warning Trump gave related to Russia's war on Ukraine. He said President Putin's refusal to end the conflict was \"not making Russia look good\". He said the US was prepared \"to impose a very strong round of powerful tariffs\" to end the bloodshed. But he said European nations had to stop buying Russian energy, claiming he only found out two weeks ago that some were doing so. </p><p>In practice, Hungary and Slovakia are the only substantive European buyers of Russian oil. Diplomats say Mr Trump is hiding behind this so he does not have to impose secondary sanctions on India and China which are both buying huge amounts of cheap Russian energy, both of whom were cited by Trump.</p><p>Perhaps more important than his speech was Trump's social media post a short while later where he asserted for the first time Ukraine could be in a position to win back all of its territory. </p><p>His dismissal of Russia as a \"paper tiger\" and not a \"real military power\" will hurt President Putin, who is sensitive to any suggestion his country is not a global player. Diplomats said this was the latest example of Mr Trump's journey towards a position that is more critical of Russia.</p><p>But one should always treat Trump's words with a pinch of salt. He was being optimistic only moments after meeting Ukraine's President Zelensky at the UN. </p><p>And he said Ukraine could win back territory with EU and Nato support; there was no mention of the US involvement. All the evidence of the last few years is that this is a war of slow attrition and Ukraine would not retake land from Russia without massive US military support.</p><p>So this was undiluted Trump; a defence of America and the nation state, an assault on multilateralism and globalism, a stream of consciousness with questionable assertions. </p><p>Six years ago Trump's audience at the UN laughed at his at times unfactual assertions; this year they listened largely in silence. </p><p>\"I am really good at this stuff,\" he told world leaders. \"Your countries are going to hell.\"</p></div>"

If you are committed to the team and him as a coach then he'll give you everything back,\" former England full-back Matt Perry recalled.</p><p>\"Being a proud Kiwi coaching England, the drills were challenging and brutal and you had to have the right mindset.</p><p>\"With defence you don't have to be angry but on your mettle at all times and really want to make tackles.

Don't let it become Farage's Britain,\" he told the conference.</p><p>He also stepped up his attacks on tech mogul Elon Musk, the owner of X, whom he said wanted to see a \"Wild West on social media\" and would benefit from Reform's plans to repeal online safety laws passed two years ago.</p><p>And in a striking image, he claimed Farage would relax British gun laws, forcing schools to teach children \"what to do in case of a mass shooting\".</p><p>A spokesman for Sir Ed said it was a reference to remarks Farage made in 2014, as leader of UKIP, when he had criticised \"kneejerk\" restrictions on handguns imposed after the 1996 Dunblane massacre.</p><p>But a Reform source accused the Lib Dem leader of \"spouting total madness\" and said the party had no plans to change gun laws in the UK should it win power. </p></div><p></p><h2>'Battle of ideas'</h2><p></p><div><p>Following his party's success at last year's election, when it won 72 MPs after picking up a swathe of Tory-held seats, Sir Ed set out a target to overtake the Conservatives at the next general election, which must take place by 2029.</p><p>The speech was light on policy detail, with Sir Ed instead trying to frame the next election as a \"battle of ideas for the future of our country\".</p><p>Evoking a land of \"county shows and school fairs; fish and chips; village greens and cricket pavilions\", he depicted the Lib Dems as the natural home for \"One Nation conservatives\" who rejected the \"divisive\" direction Kemi Badenoch has taken as Tory leader.</p><p>He lauded Britain as \"the place Hollywood comes to make Barbie, Spider-Man and Mission Impossible, the land of the Lionesses and the home of Formula One\", and the land of \"Windermere and Loch Ness, male voice choirs and Hogmanay\".</p><p>Attacking Reform's recently-announced plans to <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c5yk4r5e514o\">deport hundreds of thousands</a> of migrants as unpatriotic, he argued that sending Afghan asylum seekers back to face the Taliban \"isn't who we are\". </p><p>Repeatedly referring to Britain as a \"caring country\", he added: \"We are a nation that believes in tolerance, decency, and respect for both individual freedom and the rule of law.\" </p><p>He also called on the UK government to offer discounted visas to US cancer scientists who had lost funding under the Trump administration's \"anti-science agenda\".</p></div><p></p><h2>Gaza 'genocide'</h2><p></p><div><p>Sir Ed devoted a section of his speech to attacking Labour, telling the conference the party was \"looking more and more like Continuity Sunak\" - a reference to the Tory leader defeated at last year's election.</p><p>Sir Ed said his party would do a better job of growing the economy by negotiating a \"new customs union\" with the European Union.</p><p>He also welcomed Sir Keir Starmer's decision over the weekend to <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c1wggrdn9dno\">recognise a Palestinian state</a>, adding his party had \"led the charge\" in urging the diplomatic move for almost a decade.</p><p>He accused Israel of committing genocide in Gaza, adding it was important to \"call it by its name\". Israel has strongly denied genocide allegations, which are also being examined by the International Court of Justice.</p><p>He also complained that Farage gets an \"easy ride from the media\" and too much coverage on the BBC. </p><p>In response, the corporation said Sir Ed's \"continuing attacks on BBC journalism are completely groundless\".</p><p>\"It is simply false to say that we give any political party any less scrutiny than another,\" the corporation added.  </p></div></article>"

Moscow denied it had been trying to target facilities on Polish soil. </p><p>A similar incident occurred in <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c80g7g5rmlno\">Romania only a few days later</a> when a drone flew into Romanian airspace before disappearing from the radar.</p><p>And on Saturday three Russian MiG-31 fighter jets entered Estonian skies and remained there for 12 minutes, leading Nato jets to be scrambled. The incursions were part of a \"wider pattern of increasingly irresponsible Russian behaviour,\" Nato said in a statement on Tuesday. </p><p>In recent days Poland stated it would shoot down any objects that violated its airspace, while Sweden promised to do the same if it spotted any Russian aircraft in its skies.</p><p>In response to Russia's incursions into Poland and Romania, Nato has pledged to move troops and fighter jets eastwards.</p><p>Planes from the UK, France, Germany and Denmark are taking part in air defence missions over Poland in a bid to bolster the alliance's eastern flank.</p></div>"

More than 65,000 Palestinians have been killed during Israel's military campaign, according to the territory's Hamas-run health ministry, and most of the 2.1 million population has been displaced.</p><p>The UN estimates 92% of housing units have been damaged or destroyed, 91% of schools will require full reconstruction or major rehabilitation, and 86% of cropland is damaged. It is thought reconstruction of the territory would cost more than £45bn over the next 10 years.</p><p>\"Everyone is tired, everyone is exhausted, everyone is losing hope that the international community is going to be influential in solidifying the recognition,\" says Sabri Saidam, a senior member of Fatah, the PA's largest faction.</p><p>But does he still believe a Palestinian state can come into existence?</p><p>\"If I did not believe that, we would not have put so much energy into the recognition,\" he says. \"It is time to convince the American administration that history has changed.\"</p><p>That may be difficult. The US state department <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cjdym32z9v7o\">barred more than 80 Palestinian officials</a> - including President Abbas - from attending this week's UN General Assembly, accusing them of \"undermining prospects for peace\" by seeking \"the unilateral recognition of a conjectural Palestinian state\".</p><p>For ordinary Palestinians like Diaa, the situation feels increasingly bleak. \"People feel that the national dream is almost impossible,\" he says.</p></div><div><p><span>More on this story</span></p></div></article>"
