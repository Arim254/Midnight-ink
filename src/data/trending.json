It could still get even uglier.</p><p>Dallas faces the Eagles in only 10 days. Parsons has yet to practice during training camp, citing a back problem. Owner and G.M. Jerry Jones has dismissed his “hurt back” (and Micah’s trade request) as a negotiating tactic. In other words, Jerry doesn’t think it’s real.</p><p>The MRI of Parsons’s back was, according to coach Brian Schottenheimer, “pretty clean.” If the team thinks it’s clean enough for Parsons to play, the team could take things up a notch.</p><p>As one league source with knowledge of the procedures explained it to PFT, the Cowboys can send a letter to Parsons, explaining that he’s cleared to practice and reminding him that failure to do so constitutes conduct detrimental to the team.</p><p>If he persists in refusing to practice (and, eventually, to play), the Cowboys can take action. They can fine him for conduct detrimental to the team. Eventually, he can be suspended, for up to four games without pay.</p>\n<p>During his recent interview with Hall of Fame receiver Michael Irvin, Jones explained the Parsons is under contract for 2025, and that the Cowboys can string the situation out after that, through a couple of franchise tags. Which is what they did with quarterback Dak Prescott.</p><p>\"[T]he precedent is handling it like Dak,” Jones said. “If he doesn’t, <span><a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/story/_/id/46043382/jerry-jones-cowboys-offer-parsons-was-richest-non-qb\" target=\"_blank\">it’s very costly</a></span>. It’s very costly for everybody.”</p><p>For Micah, it’s eventually costly to the tune of $5.33 million. Which is the cost of a four-game unpaid suspension, based on his fifth-year option of $24 million.</p><p>And that could be where things are heading, if the Cowboys decide to take the current ugliness to the next level.</p>\n                                </div>"

    "description": "The streamer has launched a new tool it claims can predict which film or show you’re going to love based on astrology",
    "body": "<div><p><span>A</span>s you will already be aware, one of the downsides of the streaming era is decision paralysis. In times gone by, people would watch television by simply turning their television on, watching whatever was showing at that precise moment and then complaining about it. But now, as you find yourself forced to pick from every single film and series ever made, you feel overwhelmed. You spend entire evenings scrolling through submenu after submenu, glazing over as your inability to find something to watch ossifies into dissociative panic.</p><figure></figure><p>The challenge for the streamers is how to effectively curate this infinite content. In the past they have done this by prioritising new releases, or showing you what everyone else is watching, or sharpening their algorithms to second-guess what you want to watch based on what you have already watched. But finally – finally – <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/netflix\">Netflix</a> has cracked it. And it has achieved this with science.</p><p>Sorry, not science, <em>bullshit</em>. Because this weekend Netflix officially launched its <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.netflix.com/browse/genre/82115657\">Astrology Hub</a>. Now, after all these years, subscribers can at last pick something to watch based on a loose collection of personality quirks determined by the position of the planets at the time of their birth. Doesn’t that sound great?</p><p>So, for instance, I am a Leo. And this means that, when I enter the Netflix Astrology Hub and scroll down a bit, I am informed that “Leos have main character energy”. And as such, it means I should watch The Crown, or The King, or Queen Charlotte: A Bridgerton Story, or Emily in Paris, or The Kissing Booth 2, or that Cilla Black biopic that ITV made a few years ago. And I think that, as a heterosexual 45-year-old man, Netflix has absolutely cracked it.</p><p>Sure, I have already watched most of these for work, and I flat-out disliked almost all of them. But if Netflix says that every single person born within a specific window has the exact same personality, then sure. Tonight, after flopping down on to my sofa at the end of another long day trying to locate the right balance between quality family time and the financial imperative to work, I will watch Emily in bloody Paris. And I will like it, because Netflix told me that I would.</p><figure><div><picture><source srcset=\"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0a785b737badec37ebe1627421d4a7a718986708/0_0_1372_792/master/1372.jpg?width=620&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none\" media=\"(min-width: 660px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 660px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)\"></source><source srcset=\"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0a785b737badec37ebe1627421d4a7a718986708/0_0_1372_792/master/1372.jpg?width=620&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none\" media=\"(min-width: 660px)\"></source><source srcset=\"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0a785b737badec37ebe1627421d4a7a718986708/0_0_1372_792/master/1372.jpg?width=605&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none\" media=\"(min-width: 480px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 480px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)\"></source><source srcset=\"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0a785b737badec37ebe1627421d4a7a718986708/0_0_1372_792/master/1372.jpg?width=605&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none\" media=\"(min-width: 480px)\"></source><source srcset=\"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0a785b737badec37ebe1627421d4a7a718986708/0_0_1372_792/master/1372.jpg?width=445&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none\" media=\"(min-width: 320px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 320px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)\"></source><source srcset=\"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0a785b737badec37ebe1627421d4a7a718986708/0_0_1372_792/master/1372.jpg?width=445&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none\" media=\"(min-width: 320px)\"></source><img alt=\"Netflix’s astrology hub\" src=\"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0a785b737badec37ebe1627421d4a7a718986708/0_0_1372_792/master/1372.jpg?width=445&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none\" /></picture></div><figcaption><span><svg width=\"18\" height=\"13\"></svg></span><span>Netflix’s astrology hub.</span> Photograph: Netflix</figcaption></figure><p>Now, the naysayers among you will point out that all these choices seem geared to appeal to young girls, because young girls are statistically the demographic most likely to believe in the zodiac, and so the Netflix Astrology Hub is essentially just a bit of a grift designed to push content at one specific group. And you might even go further, by pointing out that astrology is a pseudoscience that has repeatedly proved itself to have no scientific validity whatsoever. To which I respond: of course you think that, you’re a Virgo.</p><p>And anyway, if there is any message at all behind the Netflix Astrology Hub, it is this: just be grateful that you’re not an Aquarius. Because while the other signs get off relatively lightly – Sagittarians (“bring adventure”) get Indiana Jones and the Spider-Verse, Capricorns (“activate boss mode”) get Hostage and Blackberry, and Virgos (“always hustling”) get Beef and Oppenheimer, the Aquarians are left to mournfully sift through the scraps.</p><p>Aquarians, according to Netflix, are “otherworldly” and that means their recommendations include the worst Men in Black film, the terrible Battleship film, a bizarre South Korean drama about a gynaecologist who falls in love on a space station and, of course, Rebel Moon: Part One – A Child of Fire. Does this seem like a deliberate decision on the part of Netflix to alienate a full 12th of its subscriber base? Probably, but maybe Aquarians lap this stuff up. I’m not a scientist, so I don’t know.</p><p>But, still, here we are. Netflix has access to an almost unparalleled set of highly tailored data points about every single one of its subscribers. It knows what you watch, when you watch it and for how long. It knows, with granular precision, more about your viewing habits than you ever will. It changes the image for each piece of content it has, based on your specific desires, to better maximise clicks. By harnessing this universe of data, Netflix is able to individually drip-feed shows and films to you with such dead-on accuracy that it feels like magic. But, in a way, isn’t it better to just blankly state that all Libras like Peaky Blinders and be done with it? I am willing to say yes it is.</p></div>"

Wall Street forecasts revenue of about $45.9 billion, up 53% from last year, while earnings per share are projected to be near $1.00. Investors will be watching for both headline numbers and forward guidance, as the stock remains central to the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/compare-stocks/artificial-intelligence\">artificial intelligence</a> trade.</p><h3>Elevate Your Investing Strategy:</h3><ul><li> Take advantage of <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://lp.tipranks.com/july-2025-50off/?llf=rss&amp;timer=on&amp;coupon=INTRO50P\"> TipRanks Premium at 50% off! </a> Unlock powerful investing tools, advanced data, and expert analyst insights to help you invest with confidence.\n</li></ul>\n<p>However, the mood in the market is cautious. Nvidia shares have been volatile this week, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/nvda\">sliding 3.5% last Tuesday</a> after comments from OpenAI’s CEO raised concerns about an <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/compare-stocks/artificial-intelligence\">AI</a> bubble. Adding to pressure, an MIT report <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/news/tech-stocks-fall-as-investors-begin-to-question-the-ai-hype\">suggested that most companies investing in generative AI</a> have yet to see returns. That has weighed on tech broadly, with the Nasdaq down more than 7% in recent sessions.</p>\n<figure><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/nvda\"><img src=\"https://blog.tipranks.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/image-1750.png\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://blog.tipranks.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/image-1750.png 772w, https://blog.tipranks.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/image-1750-300x159.png 300w, https://blog.tipranks.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/image-1750-768x408.png 768w\" /></a></figure>\n<h2><strong>Nvidia Balances Supply Strains and Export Rules</strong></h2>\n<p>At the same time, Nvidia is working through its own operational challenges. The company’s new <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/news/nvidia-falls-amid-blackwell-delays-and-potential-export-rules\">Blackwell-based GPUs have faced production delays</a> tied to partner Taiwan <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/compare-stocks/chips-stocks\">Semiconductor</a> Manufacturing Co. <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/tsm\">(TSM)</a>, and some analysts warn that full-scale shipments may not land until later next year. These supply constraints could influence the company’s ability to meet rising demand.</p>\n<p>Geopolitical issues are also in play. CEO Jensen Huang confirmed last week that Nvidia is in talks with the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/djt\">Trump</a> administration <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/news/nvidia-nvda-unveils-cloud-gaming-boost-and-china-only-chip\">about a next-generation AI chip for the Chinese market.</a> The proposed B30A chip would deliver roughly half the computing power of the flagship B300 to comply with export rules. This comes as the company and <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/news/new-15-tariff-stuns-nvidia-and-amd-as-analysts-wonder-whos-next\">Advanced Micro Devices </a><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/amd\">(AMD)</a> face a 15% revenue-sharing requirement on advanced chip sales to China, adding another layer of complexity to growth plans.</p>\n<h2><strong><strong>Is Nvidia Stock a Buy, Sell, or Hold?</strong></strong></h2>\n<p>Despite these hurdles, analysts remain broadly positive. Out of 39 ratings, 35 analysts rate NVDA shares a Buy, culminating in a Strong Buy consensus. The <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/nvda/forecast\">average NVDA stock price target stands at $198.57,</a> about 11.5% above the current price of $177.99. </p>\n<figure><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/nvda/forecast\"><img src=\"https://blog.tipranks.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/image-1751.png\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://blog.tipranks.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/image-1751.png 967w, https://blog.tipranks.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/image-1751-300x224.png 300w, https://blog.tipranks.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/image-1751-768x574.png 768w\" /></a></figure>\n<p><strong><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/nvda/forecast\">See more NVDA analyst ratings</a></strong></p>\n<p>Still, with high expectations and sensitive headlines, the upcoming earnings call will be pivotal.
