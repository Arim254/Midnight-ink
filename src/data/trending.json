Or more accurately, what she called them.</p><p>\"Keighley Queens\" is her best guess.</p><p>Kildunne had turned up at a trial for Yorkshire's under-15s side. She hadn't been invited, but her mother spotted the date and took her along.</p><p>Asked which team she played for, a club-less Kildunne had to improvise. The Keighley Queens, or something similar, were born.</p><p>Kildunne had previously had two clubs. </p><p>Having tagged along with her neighbours' two boys at the age of six, she would cross town and codes to play both league for Keighley Albion and union for Keighley on weekends.</p><p>The only girl on the pitch, she would scorch past once-scornful boys.</p><p>\"I just loved the pressure of proving myself,\" she remembers.</p><p>\"I wanted to make a statement. 'You are looking over your shoulder and laughing, but just wait...'\"</p><p>She had overturned similar preconceptions at secondary school. Arriving as an 11-year-old, she told the PE staff she would be playing rugby, not netball.</p><p>She was shoved out on the wing for the B team. By the end of the season, she was named back of the year.</p><p>But her progress hit a familiar roadblock. Puberty hit, genders split, teams expanded to 15 players and rugby options for young women grew sparse.</p><p>\"I didn't know that women's rugby was a big thing at that point,\" says Kildunne.</p><p>\"Instead I wanted to be the next Steven Gerrard.\"</p></div><div><figure><figcaption><span>Media caption, </span><p>England's Kildunne 'proved why she's world's best player'</p></figcaption></figure></div><div><p>By the time Kildunne arrived at that Yorkshire trial, she had moved on to football.</p><p>A childhood Liverpool fan, she used to run around the house in a replica shirt, her curly hair slicked back to resemble Spanish striker Fernando Torres.</p><p>It provided the team environment she relished.</p><p>She was part of a Farsley Celtic team who travelled to Manchester City's Etihad training campus and beat the Premier League giant's academy side 7-1.</p><p>But Kildunne still hungered for rugby.</p><p>\"When you've got that feeling inside you that you're meant to do something special, you have to have that dedication and drive to overcome barriers,\" she said.</p><p>\"There's always another route. If it's not A, B or C, it's probably X, Y, Z.\"</p><p>For Kildunne, it was Yorkshire. Having been accepted to represent her county, she thought she had better find a real club to replace 'Keighley Queens'.</p><p>She joined West Park Leeds. Soon after she played Castleford. On the opposite team was Carla Middleton, the daughter of future Red Roses coach Simon Middleton.</p><p>\"I'd never seen anything like it,\" said Middleton Sr.</p><p>\"Her team went 30 points down and she kept them in it, almost on her own, running in tries and kicking goals from the touchline. You don't see that from many 15-year-olds.\"</p><p>Three years later, Middleton gave a raft of youngsters their England debuts in a match against Canada in Barnet.</p><p>Hannah Botterman, Zoe Harrison, Abby Dow and Jess Breach all won their first caps, along with an 18-year-old Kildunne who scored a try during her 27-minute cameo in a 79-5 win.</p></div><p></p><h2 id=\"From-fangirling-in-Monaco-to-Englands-home-hero\"><span>From 'fangirling' in Monaco to England's home hero</span></h2><p></p><div><figure><p><span><picture><source srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/240/cpsprodpb/ce85/live/83d5ea70-9960-11f0-80b9-69e2e45f1309.jpg.webp 240w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/320/cpsprodpb/ce85/live/83d5ea70-9960-11f0-80b9-69e2e45f1309.jpg.webp 320w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/480/cpsprodpb/ce85/live/83d5ea70-9960-11f0-80b9-69e2e45f1309.jpg.webp 480w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/624/cpsprodpb/ce85/live/83d5ea70-9960-11f0-80b9-69e2e45f1309.jpg.webp 624w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/800/cpsprodpb/ce85/live/83d5ea70-9960-11f0-80b9-69e2e45f1309.jpg.webp 800w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/976/cpsprodpb/ce85/live/83d5ea70-9960-11f0-80b9-69e2e45f1309.jpg.webp 976w\" type=\"image/webp\"></source><img alt=\"Ellie Kildunne runs with the ball in her left hand\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/1024/cpsprodpb/ce85/live/83d5ea70-9960-11f0-80b9-69e2e45f1309.jpg\" srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/240/cpsprodpb/ce85/live/83d5ea70-9960-11f0-80b9-69e2e45f1309.jpg 240w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/320/cpsprodpb/ce85/live/83d5ea70-9960-11f0-80b9-69e2e45f1309.jpg 320w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/480/cpsprodpb/ce85/live/83d5ea70-9960-11f0-80b9-69e2e45f1309.jpg 480w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/624/cpsprodpb/ce85/live/83d5ea70-9960-11f0-80b9-69e2e45f1309.jpg 624w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/800/cpsprodpb/ce85/live/83d5ea70-9960-11f0-80b9-69e2e45f1309.jpg 800w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/976/cpsprodpb/ce85/live/83d5ea70-9960-11f0-80b9-69e2e45f1309.jpg 976w\" /></picture></span><span><span>Image source, </span>Getty Images</span></p><figcaption><span>Image caption, </span><p>Kildunne runs in a try on her England debut in November 2017.

Every game it feels like Thomas Frank can set us up differently, based on who we are playing, and we have got strength in depth too. </p><p>I don't think we need to have a 'best' team because everyone is decent, whether they start the game or not. Djed Spence and Destiny Udogie at left-back are a great example of that - they are just as good as each other, but they are a bit different, depending on what is needed and they all fit into the team.</p><p>We've got the Champions League too but because of how we got there, and also because it has been a couple of years since we were last in there, I don't know what to expect at all - especially under a new manager.

Does he regard Newcastle as a top side and, if so, will he play his robust midfield trio again in the middle of the park?</p><p>He seems to be quite negative and defensive in games like this, and I think it is a legitimate question to ask if Arsenal can win the Premier League by being that cautious.</p><p>Arteta really needs to go for it more. I am finding Newcastle difficult to predict because they do not score many goals, but they are still hard to beat.</p><p>There are a few reasons why I am backing Arsenal - Bukayo Saka is fit again and, if Eze starts as well, they will carry a real threat.

    "body": "<div><div><p>13 minutes ago</p></div><p><span><p><span>Daniel Sandford</span><span>UK correspondent</span></p></span></p></div><div><p>ID cards have always been viewed with suspicion in the UK. For some people they can conjure up images of authoritarian states like Germany in the 1930s, and men in jackboots barking \"May we see your papers please?\"</p><p>There were two periods when we had compulsory ID cards here in Britain. The first was during World War One. The second was from the beginning of World War Two until the early 1950s.  </p><p>When the system was abandoned in 1952, an editorial in the Guardian said: \"In this country we do not like this sort of thing. Better a little evasion and inefficiency than too much petty bureaucratic interference with the individual.\"</p></div><div><p>The last attempt to introduce an ID scheme, in 2006, was born through familiar concerns about immigration and illegal working, as well as worries about benefit fraud and terrorism. It was scrapped by the coalition government when they came to power in 2010.</p><p>Fifteen years on, Sir Keir Starmer is proposing something slightly different. Not an ID card, but a digital ID scheme. It is a way of proving your identity, and your right to work in the UK, using modern smartphone technology. </p><p>Though the government also says it \"will ensure that it works for those who aren't able to use a smartphone, with inclusion at the heart of its design\". How that would be achieved is not yet clear, though it might mean people without a smartphone have to use a physical ID card.</p><ul><li><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/clyl3lzzed2o\">What is the plan for digital IDs and will they be mandatory?</a></li></ul><p>Digital ID is being sold by Downing Street as a way of reducing illegal working by migrants who do not have the right to earn wages in Britain. </p><p>The rules are already - in theory - quite tough. Employers can be fined £60,000 per illegal employee if they have not done the correct checks.</p></div><div><p>The government says the proposed new digital ID - which will cost the user nothing - \"will be the authoritative proof of who someone is and their residency status in this country\".</p><p>It will include the holder's name, date of birth, photograph, and information on nationality or residency status. </p><p>Instead of involving a physical card linked to a National Identity Register, this new proposal is more a proof of identity scheme. As well as proving a person's right to work the government promise that it will in future \"make it simpler to apply for services like driving licences, childcare and welfare.\"</p><p>Ministers say that \"by the end of the parliament\" digital ID will be compulsory when checking someone's right to work. They claim that this will in turn reduce on of the \"key pull factors\" for people arriving in the UK in small boats.</p><p>\"You will not be able to work in the United Kingdom if you do not have digital ID\", the prime minister said. \"It is as simple as that.\"</p><p>A more secure way of people proving their identity might reduce illegal working, and avoid the proliferation of fake documents in circulation. </p><p>At the moment, it is quite easy to borrow, steal or use someone else's National Insurance number and that is part of the problem in the shadow economy - but the idea is a picture would make it - in theory - harder to abuse that system.</p><p>However, Jill Rutter, of the Institute for Government, has emphasised the need for \"stronger Labour market enforcement\" alongside the scheme.</p><p>\"People are paying cash, people are working in what the prime minister calls the 'shadow economy',\" she said.</p><p>\"It means people won't have an excuse for not checking, saying 'I thought they were British', and people won't be able to use fake ID so easily. </p><p>\"So it will help, but I don't think it's an absolute panacea.\"</p><p>The scheme will also take time. The phrase \"by the end of the parliament\" is shorthand for 2028, when the next general election is most likely to take place. This is not something that can be done in a year.</p><p>Most EU countries have some sort of ID scheme. One of the most modern ones is in Estonia where the focus is less on preventing illegal working, and more on easy access to things like benefits and health records.</p><p>But in countries like France and Germany, which both have long-running ID schemes, illegal working is still a problem. Though the French have long-complained that one of the pull factors to the UK for people crossing the channel in small boats is that it is even easier to work illegally in Britain than it is in France.</p></div>"

Prosecutors allege he lied to Congress about whether he authorised the leak of classified information to members of the media.</p><p>It doesn't take much to connect the dots, even if Trump's Justice Department insists there is a solid case against the former FBI director and that this is an example of the powerful being held to account.</p><ul><li><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cy50ggv35zpo\">Former FBI director Comey indicted on two charges</a></li></ul><p>\"Today's indictment reflects this Department of Justice's commitment to holding those who abuse positions of power accountable for misleading the American people,\" Bondi posted on X as word of the indictment spread.</p><p>Her assertions aside, if there had been anything left of the once-strong firewall between the department and the White House – long considered sacrosanct by presidents of both parties – it is now gone.</p><p>Laurie Levinson, a former federal prosecutor and law professor at Loyola Marymount University told BBC News that the firewall had \"completely collapsed\" with this case.</p><p>\"This is unprecedented, to have the president basically direct his people to indict a specific individual because he's angry at that person,\" Ms Levinson said, referring to Mr Comey.</p><p>Last week, Trump took to his Truth Social platform to urge Bondi to bring charges against his political foes. He complained the Justice Department was slow to charge Mr Comey, Democrat and California Senator Adam Schiff and New York Attorney General Letitia James - vocal critics who have long been in Trump's crosshairs.</p><p>Ms Levinson said Trump has gone further than former President Richard Nixon - who famously assembled an enemies list - by replacing prosecutors who have resisted his retribution agenda with ones who are willing to execute it.</p><p>Days after the US attorney for the Eastern District of Virginia, Erik Siebert, resigned over fears he would be fired for failing to prosecute James for alleged mortgage fraud, Trump appointed a White House aide to the role.</p><p>Lindsey Halligan, one of Trump's former personal lawyers who has no experience as a federal prosecutor, swiftly brought the Mr Comey case to a grand jury, which agreed there was enough evidence to prosecute.</p><p>\"Everything about this smacks of vindictive prosecution,\" Ms Levinson said.</p><p>To secure an indictment, 12 members of a grand jury only need to vote for probable cause - not proof beyond reasonable doubt. In addition, the grand jury considers the case based solely on evidence by prosecutors, with no defence attorneys present.</p></div><div><p>Annemarie McAvoy, a legal expert and Columbia University professor, notes that prosecutors may have testimony and documentary evidence that supports their case against Mr Comey – evidence that was presented to the grand jury and could be used to build the case against the former director during trial.</p><p>\"There have been questions all along as to whether he was being honest when he said he didn't leak information,\" she said. \"And you know if there are others who are willing to come forward and say, yes, I got the information from James Comey, then potentially they certainly have a case.\"</p><p>In a short statement provided to the media, Mr Comey's attorney said that he denies the charges and that he looks forward to vindication in the courtroom.</p><p>If this case does, in fact, go to trial, it is poised to unearth long-buried drama from the Russian election-meddling investigation of Trump's first term, even though the perjury and obstruction charges are quite tangential and small-bore.</p><p>Trump and his supporters are already treating the prosecution of Mr Comey as an avenue to undermine the credibility of the entire Russia investigation. While that probe found ample evidence of attempts to meddle in the 2016 presidential election, it produced no concrete evidence tying Trump directly to those efforts.</p><p>Kash Patel, Trump's FBI director, called the investigation a \"disgraceful chapter in history\" in a post on X after the indictment was announced. He accused what he said was the \"previous corrupt leadership\" of weaponising the bureau's investigatory power.</p><p>Those same accusations are now being directed at Patel, Bondi and the rest of the Trump team. And perhaps the biggest question hanging over all of this is whether the Mr Comey indictment is just an individual event – a move that might placate a clearly angry president – or a sign of more prosecutions to come.</p></div>"

It would seek a UN mandate to be Gaza's \"supreme political and legal authority\" for five years.</p><p>The plan would be modelled on the international administrations that oversaw East Timor and Kosovo's transitions to statehood. It would initially be based in Egypt, near Gaza's southern border, before entering Gaza once the Strip is stable, alongside a multinational force. </p><p>As PM, Blair took the decision to commit British forces to the 2003 Iraq War that was heavily criticised in the official inquiry into the conflict, which found he had acted on flawed intelligence without certainty about the production of weapons of mass destruction there.</p><p>After leaving office in 2007, Blair served as Middle East envoy for the Quartet of international powers (the US, EU, Russia and the UN). He focused on bringing economic development to Palestine and creating the conditions for a two state-solution.</p><p>Reports of discussions about his involvement in a transitional authority for Gaza come after Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas said on Thursday that he was ready to work with Trump and other world leaders to implement a two-state peace plan.</p><p>Abbas stressed his rejection of a future governing role for Hamas in Gaza and demanded it disarm.</p><p>Throughout the conflict, varying proposals for the future of Gaza have been tabled by multiple parties. </p><p>In February, Donald Trump floated plans - which since appear to have been dropped - for the US to take \"a long-term ownership position\" over Gaza, saying it could be the \"Riviera of the Middle East\". </p><p>The idea would have involved the forced displacement of Palestinians in the territory and be in violation of international law. The US and Israel said it would involve \"voluntary\" emigration.</p><p>In March, the US and Israel rejected an Arab plan for the post-war reconstruction of the Gaza Strip that would allow the 2.1 million Palestinians living there to stay in place. The Palestinian Authority and Hamas welcomed the Arab plan, which called for Gaza to be governed temporarily by a committee of independent experts and for international peacekeepers to be deployed there.</p><p>In July, a French and Saudi-led international conference in New York proposed a  \"transitional administrative committee\" for Gaza which would operate \"under the umbrella of the Palestinian Authority\". Neither the US nor Israel attended. The so-called New York Declaration was backed by a majority of the UN General Assembly in a resolution earlier this month.</p><p>Earlier this week, the UK formally recognised the State of Palestine, alongside France, Canada, Australia, and several other countries.<b> </b></p><p>The UK and others reiterated calls for a two-state solution, which would see the creation of an independent Palestine in the West Bank and Gaza Strip, with East Jerusalem as its capital, alongside Israel.</p><p>Israel and the US criticised the move as a \"reward for Hamas\".</p><p>The Israeli military launched a campaign in Gaza in response to the Hamas-led attack on southern Israel on 7 October 2023, in which about 1,200 people were killed and 251 others were taken hostage.</p><p>At least 65,502 people have been killed in Israeli attacks in Gaza since then, according to the territory's Hamas-run health ministry. A UN commission of inquiry has said Israel has committed genocide against Palestinians in Gaza, which Israel denies.</p></div>"

It's as simple as that.\"</p><p>The government says the scheme is designed to curb illegal immigration by making it harder for people without status to find jobs. Ministers argue this is one of the key pull factors for migrants entering the UK illegally.</p><p>Employers will no longer be able to rely on a National Insurance number - which is currently used as part of proof of right to work - or paper-based checks.</p><p>At the moment, it is quite easy to borrow, steal or use someone else's National Insurance number and that is part of the problem in the shadow economy - people sharing National Insurance numbers for example. The idea is that having a picture attached would make it - in theory - harder to abuse that system.</p><p>However, Conservative leader Kemi Badenoch said that while there are arguments \"for and against\" digital ID, making it mandatory \"requires a proper national debate\".</p><p>In a post on X she said: \"Can we really trust [Labour] to implement an expensive national programme that will impact all of our lives and put additional burdens on law abiding people? I doubt it.\"</p><p>Liberal Democrats' Shadow Attorney General Ben Maguire told the BBC the party was \"struggling\" to see how the policy would have a meaningful impact on illegal migration.</p></div><p></p><h2>Will digital ID be compulsory and what else could it be used for?</h2><p></p><div><p>Digital ID will be available to all UK citizens and legal residents, and mandatory in order to work.</p><p>However, for students, pensioners or others not seeking work, having a digital ID will be optional.</p><p>Officials also stress it will not function like a traditional identity card: people will not be required to carry it in public.</p><p>Ministers have ruled out requiring the ID for access to healthcare or welfare payments. </p><p>However, the system is being designed to integrate with some government services, to make applications simpler and reduce fraud.</p><p>The government said that, in time, digital IDs would make it easier to apply for services such as driving licences, childcare and welfare. It said it would also simplify access to tax records.</p></div><p></p><h2>Will people who don't have a smartphone need a digital ID card?</h2><p></p><div><p>The government has promised the system will be \"inclusive\" and work for those without smartphones, passports or reliable internet access.</p><p>A public consultation expected to be launched later this year will include looking at alternatives - potentially including physical documents or face-to-face support - for groups such as older people or the homeless.</p></div><p></p><h2>Which other countries already have ID cards?</h2><p></p><div><p>The UK government has said it will \"take the best aspects\" of digital ID systems used elsewhere around the world, including Estonia, Australia, Denmark and India.</p><p>Each of these countries has its own unique system, but all use it as a way for people to prove who they are when accessing certain government or banking services.</p><ul><li>Estonia introduced its mandatory digital ID system in 2002, and people use it to access medical records, voting, banking and digital signatures. It's primarily stored on peoples' smartphones as a digital version of an ID card</li><li>Australia and Denmark have digital ID apps that people can download and use to log into government and private services. Neither require citizens to have it</li><li>India has a system through which people can obtain a unique 12-digit reference number to use as proof of residence and identity</li></ul><p>Many other countries also use digital ID of one kind or another, including Singapore, Greece, France, Bosnia and Herzegovina, the United Arab Emirates, China, Costa Rica, South Korea and Afghanistan.</p></div><p></p><h2>Has the UK tried to introduce ID cards before?</h2><p></p><div><p>Yes. Tony Blair's Labour government legislated for voluntary ID cards in the early 2000s.</p><p>However, the scheme was scrapped in 2011 by the Conservative-led coalition, which argued it was too costly and intrusive.</p><p>The UK has only had compulsory ID cards during wartime. Although they stayed in place for several years after World War Two, Winston Churchill's government scrapped them in 1952 following criticism over costs and police use.</p></div><p></p><h2>Why are some people against digital ID?</h2><p></p><div><p>Civil liberties groups argue that even a limited digital ID could pave the way for a more intrusive system, raising concerns about privacy, data security and government overreach.</p><p>Big Brother Watch, alongside seven other organisations, has written to the prime minister urging him to abandon the plan, saying it will \"push unauthorised migrants further into the shadows\". </p><p>More than 900,000 people have signed a petition against introducing digital ID cards, on the UK Parliament website. Petitions that get more than 100,000 signatures are considered for a debate in Parliament.</p><p>Other prominent critics include the former Conservative cabinet minister David Davis - who campaigned against Labour's ID card scheme in the 2000s.</p><p>He said \"no system is immune to failure\" and warned governments and tech companies have repeatedly failed to protect people's data.</p></div></article>"
