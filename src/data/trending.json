    "body": "<article><div><div><p>12 hours ago</p></div><p><span><p><span>Anthony Zurcher</span><span>North America correspondent, Washington</span></p></span></p></div><p></p><figcaption>Watch: Closed parks and empty buildings as US government shuts down</figcaption><p></p><div><p>Welcome to the shutdown, 2025 edition. On Tuesday evening, the US Senate was unable to pass a spending bill that would have kept the US government funded, and for the first time in nearly seven years, federal operations have been drastically curtailed.</p><p>At some point, this shutdown – like all the ones before it - will end. It may take days; it may take weeks, but eventually, as public pressure and political pain grows, one side or the other will yield.</p><p>Here are four scenarios for how that might play out.</p></div><p></p><h2>Democrats quickly break ranks</h2><p></p><div><p>Senate Democrats shot down a Republican spending bill that would have kept the government operating until November, but that vote may have contained the seeds of their defeat.</p><p>While forty four Democrats (and Republican iconoclast Rand Paul) voted no, two Democrats and one Democrat-allied independent sided with the Republican majority.</p><p>Independent Angus King of Maine is always a bit of a wildcard. John Fetterman of Pennsylvania has been charting his own path for nearly a year. But Catherine Cortez Masto of Nevada, while not a liberal firebrand, is not your typical political maverick.</p><p>She is, however, up for re-election next year in a state that Donald Trump carried in 2024 and which has been slowly trending Republican for years. </p><p>In her statement explaining her vote, she expressed concern about the economic toll government closure would have on Nevada. She might also be worried about the toll it could take on her political prospects as an incumbent on the ballot when voters turn angry.</p><ul><li><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/live/clylje0rmp2t\">Follow the latest development in the US shutdown </a></li><li><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cgj1p485p0no\">Jobs, travel, national parks - what impact will US shutdown have?</a></li><li><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/crrj1znp0pyo\">Why the US government has shut down and what happens now</a></li></ul><p>She's not the only member of her party from a battleground state who will be on the ballot in 2026, either. Democrats in Georgia, Virginia and Colorado could also start feeling the heat. </p><p>And while incumbents from Minnesota, Michigan and New Hampshire have chosen to retire rather than run for re-election, they might worry that a shutdown puts Democratic control of their seats at risk, too.</p><p>Republican Senate leader John Thune says that he is already hearing from some Democrats who are uneasy with the way the shutdown is playing out. He's planning a series of funding votes in the coming days to keep the pressure on.</p><p>There were no new defections during the vote on Wednesday, but if five more Democrats break ranks, the shutdown will end – whether the rest of the Democratic Party wants it to or not.</p></div><p></p><figcaption>Watch: What could happen during the US government shutdown?</figcaption><p></p><p></p><h2>Democrats back down</h2><p></p><div><p>Even if the Democrats stay (relatively) united, the pressure on them to abandon the fight is likely to increase as the shutdown drags on. </p><p>Government employees are a key constituency in the party, and they will be the ones feeling the pain most immediately from delayed paycheques and the possibility that the Trump administration will use the shutdown to further slash programmes and turn their furloughs into permanent unemployment.</p><p>The American public as a whole will also start feeling the bite through curtailed government services and economic disruption. </p><p>Typically the party that triggers a shutdown and is making the policy demands – in this case, the Democrats - is the one that accrues the public's blame. If that's how this plays out, the party may conclude that they've made as much of a point as they can and cut their losses.</p><p>Even without tangible gains, they may even be able to take comfort in the fact that they have put a spotlight on the expiring health insurance subsidies and Republican-approved government healthcare cuts for the poor that will be kicking in for tens of millions of Americans in the coming months.</p><p>When that blame game starts, such thinking goes, they could be better positioned to reap the political benefits.</p><p>The Democratic base that has been demanding their party dig in and fight the Trump administration won't be fully satisfied, but it's the kind of off-ramp the party leadership might be able to live with.</p></div><figure><div><p><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20250919-090805-05e5ba0164-web-2.30.1-2/grey-placeholder.png\" /><img srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/f297/live/4e1c3b80-9ef3-11f0-928c-71dbb8619e94.jpg.webp 240w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/f297/live/4e1c3b80-9ef3-11f0-928c-71dbb8619e94.jpg.webp 320w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/f297/live/4e1c3b80-9ef3-11f0-928c-71dbb8619e94.jpg.webp 480w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/f297/live/4e1c3b80-9ef3-11f0-928c-71dbb8619e94.jpg.webp 640w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/f297/live/4e1c3b80-9ef3-11f0-928c-71dbb8619e94.jpg.webp 800w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/f297/live/4e1c3b80-9ef3-11f0-928c-71dbb8619e94.jpg.webp 1024w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/f297/live/4e1c3b80-9ef3-11f0-928c-71dbb8619e94.jpg.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/f297/live/4e1c3b80-9ef3-11f0-928c-71dbb8619e94.jpg.webp\" alt=\"EPA Republican leaders of the US House and Senate, including Speaker of the House Mike Johnson and Senate Majority Leader John Thune, flank a podium with a sign that reads 'The Democrat Shutdown'. They are outside and the National Mall stretches out behind them. \" /><span>EPA</span></p></div></figure><p></p><h2>Republicans make concessions</h2><p></p><div><p>At the moment, Republicans feel like they are in a position of strength - and are contemplating new ways to increase the pain felt by Democrats. But it is possible that they could be miscalculating, and they end up the ones who back away from the void. </p><p>They've been behind most of the government shutdowns in the past, and the public could hold them responsible this time, too. Maybe it's out of habit or maybe because, in their zeal to slash government services and worker rolls, Republicans overplay their hand.</p><p>In this scenario, the Republicans provide some kind of sufficient guarantee to Democrats that they will help to extend the health-insurance subsidies.</p><p>It's not an entirely unthinkable scenario, given that Republicans are currently divided over whether those subsidies – which help their own low-income voters as well as Democrats – should be continued. That would be a concession that could, in the end, boost their own electoral prospects and defuse an obvious line of Democratic attack in next year's midterm elections.</p><p>Republicans have said they won't negotiate with political hostage-takers, but it is possible to see ground for compromise underneath the overheated rhetoric and acrimony.</p></div><p></p><h2>The shutdown stretches on (and both sides lose)</h2><p></p><div><p>At the moment, of course, overheated rhetoric and acrimony is pretty much all there is. Trump is sharing derisive, obscenity-laced AI generated videos of his opponents. Democrats have responded with Trump-Epstein photos and promises that they are in this fight for the long haul.</p><p>The last government shutdown stretched on for a record-setting 35 days, ending only after US air travel was on the verge of massive disruption. And that was only a partial shutdown, as some government funding had been approved. This time around, the consequences could be more severe.</p><p>If this stretches on long enough, it may not matter who \"wins\" by forcing the other side to fold. There will be more than enough blame to go around.</p><p>In such a \"pox on both houses\" scenario, incumbents from both parties suffer the consequences at the ballot box next year and the public becomes even more dissatisfied with the state of the affairs. That then sets the stage for the next wave of politicians promising to bring a wrecking ball to the status quo.</p><p>Rinse and repeat.</p></div></article>"

Then, a month later, a baby.</b></p><p>Each arrival, in its own way, marked a sharp swerve in the fortunes of a grief-bludgeoned Iraqi family that has spent the past 15 years darting around Europe in a state of legal limbo. Unable to secure asylum, or to work legally, or to call anywhere home.</p><p>The Alhashemi family scraped the depths of misery in April 2024. Threatened with imminent deportation from Belgium to Iraq, they attempted to cross the English Channel in a small boat. <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-68930088\">Their seven-year-old daughter, Sara, died</a> in a suffocating crush onboard – an incident we witnessed from a French beach.</p><p>A little more than a year later, a life-changing email from an official French refugee agency reached the family at their temporary accommodation in Rouvroy. It is a quiet town surrounded by World War One memorials and by the tall coal slag heaps that litter this stretch of northern France. The far-right French politician, Marine Le Pen, is a local MP.</p></div><div><p>\"We know our path now,\" says Ahmed Alhashemi, 42, scrolling through the email, a small smile breaking across his careworn face.</p><p>Across the hallway, in her bedroom, his oldest daughter, Rahaf, 14, writes in a neat notebook, carefully practising her fourth language, French.</p><p>\"It's pretty hard. I can understand more than I can speak,\" she says in fluent English, her third language after Swedish and Arabic.</p></div><p></p><h2>Asylum repeatedly denied</h2><p></p><div><p>Ahmed and his wife, Nour, 35, met in Belgium when they were in their 20s, having both fled Iraq. Nour says she and her brothers and sisters had to leave because of their family's ties to Saddam Hussein's deposed regime. Ahmed fled because of alleged death threats from a local militia.</p><p>Nour's siblings quickly moved to Sweden, where they were all granted asylum. But Nour stayed back because she had met Ahmed at a relative's home in Antwerp, and was immediately struck by his calm, considerate demeanour.</p><p>\"It was love,\" she acknowledges with a sad smile, that stopped her from following her siblings to Sweden.</p><p>\"If I'd gone with them, my entire life would have changed. It might be my fate, or destiny,\" she says.</p><p>Instead, a different life unfolded. The couple applied for asylum in Belgium, were married there and went on to have three children – daughters Rahaf and Sara, and a son called Hussam.</p></div><figure><div><p><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20250919-090805-05e5ba0164-web-2.30.1-2/grey-placeholder.png\" /><img srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/500e/live/45e1df10-9dfe-11f0-92db-77261a15b9d2.png.webp 240w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/500e/live/45e1df10-9dfe-11f0-92db-77261a15b9d2.png.webp 320w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/500e/live/45e1df10-9dfe-11f0-92db-77261a15b9d2.png.webp 480w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/500e/live/45e1df10-9dfe-11f0-92db-77261a15b9d2.png.webp 640w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/500e/live/45e1df10-9dfe-11f0-92db-77261a15b9d2.png.webp 800w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/500e/live/45e1df10-9dfe-11f0-92db-77261a15b9d2.png.webp 1024w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/500e/live/45e1df10-9dfe-11f0-92db-77261a15b9d2.png.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/500e/live/45e1df10-9dfe-11f0-92db-77261a15b9d2.png.webp\" alt=\"Three siblings stand together posing for a photo - Hussam on the left, Rahaf in the middle with her arms around her brother and Sara, on the right.

There were no shops and little public transport. Other migrants spent only a night or two at the centre before leaving - often to head back to the coast to attempt another crossing.

She had stayed in touch with school friends from Sweden where she had flourished, winning prizes for ice-skating.</p><p>As the months began to slip by, it appeared that the Alhashemi family had become trapped in the eddies of a bureaucratic whirlpool, struggling to get the children into a local school, to receive any sort of financial support or to leave the crowded hostel.</p><p>Weighed down by grief, Nour struggled to leave her bed.</p><p>\"I ate there.

I'm clear about what the evidence tells us. And I'm clear about what we need to do.\"</p><p>She added: \"There's a real urgency about this because every year that passes, as children are born, as they move into that system, the numbers go up, child poverty rates increase. So we have to tackle it.\"</p><p>The education secretary argued that children should not be \"punished\" for events beyond their control, for example if a parent loses their job and has to rely on benefits.</p><p>\"This was a Tory policy that's had a devastating impact on children and we'll sort it,\" she said. </p></div><div><p>Sir Keir Starmer has previously spoken of his desire to ditch the two-child cap when economic conditions allow, without specifying exact circumstances.</p><p><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2025/sep/30/rachel-reeves-lift-two-child-benefit-cap-november-budget\">According to the Guardian newspaper</a>, officials are considering whether there could be a tapered rate, so parents receive the most benefits for their first child and less for subsequent children.</p><p>Other options under consideration include limiting additional benefits to three or four children, the newspaper reported. </p><p>Asked whether the cap needed to be scrapped completely or if it could instead be amended, Phillipson told the BBC: \"Through the work of the taskforce I see all the evidence, I look at the numbers, I look at the impact of different policies. </p><p>\"This isn't the only way we'll take action, to be clear, because there are other steps we need to take, whether on skills, rights at work, much more besides, childcare. But I know what the evidence tells me.\"</p><p>The Resolution Foundation think tank says axing the cap would cost an estimated £3.5bn and would lift 470,000 children out of poverty.</p><p>Campaigners have called for it to be abolished in full, arguing this would be the most cost-effective way to reduce child poverty.</p></div><p></p><h2>'In the room'</h2><p></p><div><p>Phillipson said tackling child poverty would be her \"number one priority\" if she was elected Labour's next deputy leader, to replace Angela Rayner after her resignation last month.</p><p>\"It really is personal to me. I know what it's like to not grow up with very much,\" she said.</p><p>Phillipson's rival in the contest, her former cabinet colleague Lucy Powell, has also criticised the cap and said scrapping it would be the \"single biggest policy we could do to address child poverty\".</p><p>Powell was sacked from her role as Commons leader in a reshuffle last month.</p><p>Phillipson rejected the idea that as a cabinet minister she would have less freedom to challenge the prime minister over government policy.</p><p>\"What I'll bring as deputy leader is the ability to unite our party and our movement,\" she told the BBC.</p><p>\"But alongside that I'll be a strong voice at the cabinet table for members. So I'll be in the room when those decisions are being made, able to push for the things that members want to see.\"</p><p>Highlighting her record as education secretary, Phillipson said she had fought \"tooth and nail\" for policies like the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cdr5mr5l2d1o\">expansion of free school meals</a>.</p><p>She added that \"there's a limit to what you can do\" from outside cabinet and \"what I don't think members want is for us to be airing our dirty linen in public\".</p><p>In her pitch to Labour members at a hustings on Wednesday, Powell said she would be a \"full-time deputy\" and \"a strong independent voice\".</p><p>If elected, she pledged to have \"difficult conversations\" with the leadership, while refusing to \"snipe from the sidelines\".</p><p>Although Phillipson gained more nominations to be deputy leader from her fellow MPs, published polling of party members has suggested Powell is the frontrunner in the contest. </p><p>However, Phillipson's campaign have pointed to her greater number of nominations from the trade union movement. </p><p>Voting in a ballot of Labour members and affiliated supporters is open from 8 October to 23 October, with the result of the contest announced on 25 October. </p></div><figure><div><p><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20250919-090805-05e5ba0164-web-2.30.1-2/grey-placeholder.png\" /><img srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/6133/live/2bce6ee0-0b00-11f0-97d3-37df2b293ed1.png.webp 240w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/6133/live/2bce6ee0-0b00-11f0-97d3-37df2b293ed1.png.webp 320w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/6133/live/2bce6ee0-0b00-11f0-97d3-37df2b293ed1.png.webp 480w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/6133/live/2bce6ee0-0b00-11f0-97d3-37df2b293ed1.png.webp 640w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/6133/live/2bce6ee0-0b00-11f0-97d3-37df2b293ed1.png.webp 800w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/6133/live/2bce6ee0-0b00-11f0-97d3-37df2b293ed1.png.webp 1024w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/6133/live/2bce6ee0-0b00-11f0-97d3-37df2b293ed1.png.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/6133/live/2bce6ee0-0b00-11f0-97d3-37df2b293ed1.png.webp\" alt=\"Thin, red banner promoting the Politics Essential newsletter with text saying, “Top political analysis in your inbox every day”.

After the 2016 referendum, arrivals started to outpace removals. </p><p>Migration experts say other Brexit factors, like the ending of fingerprint database access, have also made a difference.</p><p>In response, Reform UK accused the PM of \"spreading complete misinformation\".</p></div><p></p><h2>'Farage boats'</h2><p></p><div><p>Starmer said the UK had a \"returns agreement\" with every country in the EU before Brexit.</p><p>The PM was apparently referring to the Dublin III regulation - which the UK formally exited on 1 January 2021.</p><p>\"He [Farage] told the country it will make no difference if we left,\" Sir Keir told GB News. \"Well, he was wrong about that - these are Farage boats, in many senses, that are coming across the Channel.\"</p><p>The regulation allowed some asylum seekers to be returned to the first country in the EU that they had entered, although other factors like family reunion were taken into account. Under the scheme, some people could be sent to the UK too.</p><p>Responding to Sir Keir's claim, Reform UK told BBC Verify that the Dublin regulation \"made us a net recipient of asylum seekers\" and \"did nothing to make it easier to return asylum seekers\".</p><p>However, the UK only became a net recipient in the period between the 2016 Brexit vote and leaving the scheme at the end of 2020.</p><p>As the chart below shows, in the years leading up the referendum the UK transferred more people to other EU countries under the regulation than it received in return.</p></div><div><p>The UK-France scheme - which is being run as a pilot - <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cwywv34w00ro\">has seen just three people returned and three arrive since August</a>. </p><p>BBC Verify spoke to Dr Peter Walsh from the independent Migration Observatory based at the University of Oxford.</p><p>He told us that there was evidence that migrants were aware that the UK had left the Dublin agreement, which had previously made them feel at risk of being returned to the EU.</p><p>\"The impact of Brexit… makes migrants more likely to choose to come to the UK. This was a notable theme that came from migrants or charity workers, lawyers and so on.\"</p><p>While it is not entirely clear why the UK was a net recipient of asylum seekers in the years after the Brexit vote, Dr Walsh added that \"some legal experts suggested that it was because of dysfunction of the special Dublin returns unit at the Home Office\".</p><p>When it comes to why some migrants decide to make the crossing, Dr Walsh said there were a number of pull factors.</p><p>\"Family is a very important factor... members of the community, friends, diaspora, network – that's the biggest. </p><p>\"Number two would be English language and then three and four Brexit and perceptions of the UK as being more tolerant\". </p></div><figure><div><p><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20250919-090805-05e5ba0164-web-2.30.1-2/grey-placeholder.png\" /><img srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/0576/live/c866d020-9ed1-11f0-b741-177e3e2c2fc7.png.webp 240w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/0576/live/c866d020-9ed1-11f0-b741-177e3e2c2fc7.png.webp 320w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/0576/live/c866d020-9ed1-11f0-b741-177e3e2c2fc7.png.webp 480w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/0576/live/c866d020-9ed1-11f0-b741-177e3e2c2fc7.png.webp 640w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/0576/live/c866d020-9ed1-11f0-b741-177e3e2c2fc7.png.webp 800w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/0576/live/c866d020-9ed1-11f0-b741-177e3e2c2fc7.png.webp 1024w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/0576/live/c866d020-9ed1-11f0-b741-177e3e2c2fc7.png.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/0576/live/c866d020-9ed1-11f0-b741-177e3e2c2fc7.png.webp\" alt=\"A chart showing the cumulative number of small boat crossings in the years 2021 to 2025.

They have said efforts to negotiate with Republicans over these benefits have so far been unsuccessful.</p><p>“Why are they boycotting negotiations? I've never witnessed this in my life,\" Senator Chris Murphy, a Democrat from Connecticut, said of Republicans. “The matter is the government will open when Republicans get serious about it talking to Democrats.”</p></div><p></p><figcaption>Watch: Closed parks and empty buildings as US government shuts down</figcaption><p></p><div><p>Meanwhile, Republicans - who control both chambers of Congress but do not have the 60 votes needed to pass a funding bill - have said these healthcare benefits are not the priority, keeping the government open is. </p><p>\"It's not about who wins or who loses or who gets blamed and all this,” Senate Majority Leader John Thune said. “It's about the American people. And [Democrats] have taken the American people hostage in a way that they think benefits them politically.\"</p><p>Republicans have also argued the healthcare extensions Democrats are looking for will cost American taxpayers more money and were instituted to manage Covid-era complexities that no longer exist.</p><p>Essential workers such as border agents and the military may be forced to work without pay for the time being - but government employees deemed non-essential are temporarily put on unpaid leave. In the past, these workers have then been paid retrospectively.</p><p>Analysts expect this shutdown to be bigger than the last one in 2018, when Congress had passed some funding bills. They expect roughly 40% of federal workers - around 750,000 people - to be put on temporary leave.</p></div><p></p><figcaption>Watch: Vance makes rare appearance at White House briefing</figcaption><p></p><div><p>Some workers were furloughed on Wednesday. But the Trump administration has also threatened permanent layoffs of federal workers as well.</p><p>\"Let's be honest, if this thing drags on,\" Vance said during the briefing on Wednesday, \"we are going to have to lay people off.\"</p><p>Vance also made the claim - repeatedly denied by Democrats - that the shutdown is a result of senior Democrats advocating for healthcare benefits to be extended to undocumented migrants.</p><p>US law already prohibits undocumented migrants from gaining any federally subsidised healthcare coverage. \"Nowhere have Democrats suggested that we're interested in changing federal law,\" House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries said.</p><p>Russell Vought, the White House's budget chief, briefed Republicans behind closed doors on what the impending layoffs could look like, although public details of those plans are sparse. </p><p>On Capitol Hill, there was little appetite for a deal to end the standoff on Wednesday. </p><p>\"There's nothing to negotiate. There's nothing we can pull out of this bill to make it any leaner or cleaner than it is,\" Republican Speaker of the House Mike Johnson said.</p><p>Another vote on the short-term funding bill proposed by Republicans is expected on Friday.</p><p><i>With additional reporting from Bernd Debusmann Jr at the White House</i></p></div></article>"

This time last year she wouldn't have been stepping up to take that free-kick.\"</p><p>Bompastor is more than aware of Beever-Jones' goalscoring prowess, having seen her end last season as Chelsea's top scorer in all competitions with 13 goals - coming from 22 starts and 13 substitute appearances.</p><p>But she was quick to praise her again on Sunday, describing her as \"great for the team\".</p><p>The Frenchwoman does not usually select two out-and-out strikers so will have a big decision to make when Kerr is ready to start.</p><p>\"At the moment with Aggie, you would not take her off,\" said White. \"It is more a case of adding to her, to help the team improve.\"</p></div><p></p><h2 id=\"Not-a-straightforward-journey\"><span>'Not a straightforward journey'</span></h2><p></p><div><p>Chelsea have broken their transfer record multiple times in recent seasons, most recently on USA forward Alyssa Thompson, but Beever-Jones is one of their few academy products in the first-team squad.</p><p>Having made her senior Chelsea debut in January 2021, she signed her first professional contract on her 18th birthday in July 2021 but was loaned out to Championship side Bristol City the following season.</p><p>She spent the 2022-23 campaign on loan again, this time at fellow WSL club Everton, but on her return to Chelsea then manager Emma Hayes said she had come back a first-team player.</p><p>\"It's not been straightforward for her at Chelsea. That shows her resilience and the desire she has of wanting to be the best,\" said White.</p><p>\"What she is doing is really exciting. She is English, she is a homegrown talent and, when you think about the amount being spent on transfers and million-pound signings coming into our league, it is great to see a young English talent that is thriving in this Chelsea team. It is really exciting for our national team as well.\"</p></div><div><figure><p><span><picture><source srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/240/cpsprodpb/b256/live/d2aec070-9ec1-11f0-85b6-27ff7e482819.jpg.webp 240w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/320/cpsprodpb/b256/live/d2aec070-9ec1-11f0-85b6-27ff7e482819.jpg.webp 320w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/480/cpsprodpb/b256/live/d2aec070-9ec1-11f0-85b6-27ff7e482819.jpg.webp 480w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/624/cpsprodpb/b256/live/d2aec070-9ec1-11f0-85b6-27ff7e482819.jpg.webp 624w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/800/cpsprodpb/b256/live/d2aec070-9ec1-11f0-85b6-27ff7e482819.jpg.webp 800w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/976/cpsprodpb/b256/live/d2aec070-9ec1-11f0-85b6-27ff7e482819.jpg.webp 976w\" type=\"image/webp\"></source><img alt=\"Aggie Beever-Jones completes her hat-trick against Portugal at Wembley\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/3840/cpsprodpb/b256/live/d2aec070-9ec1-11f0-85b6-27ff7e482819.jpg\" srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/240/cpsprodpb/b256/live/d2aec070-9ec1-11f0-85b6-27ff7e482819.jpg 240w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/320/cpsprodpb/b256/live/d2aec070-9ec1-11f0-85b6-27ff7e482819.jpg 320w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/480/cpsprodpb/b256/live/d2aec070-9ec1-11f0-85b6-27ff7e482819.jpg 480w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/624/cpsprodpb/b256/live/d2aec070-9ec1-11f0-85b6-27ff7e482819.jpg 624w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/800/cpsprodpb/b256/live/d2aec070-9ec1-11f0-85b6-27ff7e482819.jpg 800w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/976/cpsprodpb/b256/live/d2aec070-9ec1-11f0-85b6-27ff7e482819.jpg 976w\" /></picture></span><span><span>Image source, </span>Getty Images</span></p><figcaption><span>Image caption, </span><p>Aggie Beever-Jones is the second woman to score a hat-trick at Wembley for England after Beth Mead</p></figcaption></figure></div><p></p><h2 id=\"Can-she-break-into-England-starting-XI\"><span>Can she break into England starting XI?</span></h2><p></p><div><p>There was one substitute England striker on the name of everyone's lips after Euro 2025 and it wasn't Beever-Jones, who saw herself slip down the pecking order behind teenager Michelle Agyemang as the go-to danger weapon from the bench.</p><p>But White said she does not think Beever-Jones had a point to prove after the Euros, adding: \"She seems like the type of character where she wants to just improve, develop and learn.</p><p>\"Ultimately I can imagine that she wants to become Chelsea's number nine, which she is at the moment, and she wants to gain more caps and more opportunities with England.\"</p><p>Beever-Jones has hardly been slow to impress on the international stage either, with six goals in 11 appearances.</p></div><div><p>On her first start for the Lionesses she scored a <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/live/cgeg229pgv4t\">30-minute hat-trick</a> against Portugal at Wembley in May, while she made three substitute appearances during England's triumphant Euros campaign in the summer, scoring once and setting up one goal - both against Wales.</p><p>Beever-Jones, who has scored two more league goals than Alessia Russo and three more than Agyemang this season, could get her next chance this month when England face Brazil and Australia in friendlies.</p><p>\"If she is scoring the way she is, she will get those opportunities and she is going to be pushing Alessia Russo, and Agyemang too,\" said White.</p><p>\"Maybe it will be Aggie Beever-Jones who will be first to come on now.

But Rosie says that when Mr Elvidge declared Motorflix Media Ltd had no assets, he wasn't pursued further.</p><p>The company is still registered, but has yet to file any accounts. </p></div><p></p><h2>'The life I was making I no longer have'</h2><p></p><div><p>As well as the stress of going through the tribunal, Rosie says not getting the money \"tipped things over the edge\" for her finances, and she moved back in with her mum.</p><p>\"I feel like I've gone back five years,\" she says. \"The life I was making for myself I no longer have.\"</p><p>Rosie applied to have her employer named online too – but hasn't been successful. </p><p>She now wishes she \"hadn't bothered\" with the tribunal system.</p><p>\"I thought the justice system would step in and make sure I received that money,\" she says.</p><p>Christian Elvidge was contacted for comment, but did not respond.</p></div><p></p><h2>'Completely broken' system</h2><p></p><div><p>Tens of thousands of employment tribunal cases are launched every year – although the vast majority are settled, withdrawn or resolved before it gets to a hearing.</p><p>491,000 claims were open in March 2025, according to the Ministry of Justice.</p><p>Citizens Advice said the employment tribunal system was \"completely broken\".</p><p>\"To have jumped through all of those hoops and then have a tribunal award that never gets paid is frankly scandalous,\" said policy manager Emer Sheehy. </p><p>The Federation of Small Businesses is among those calling for the system to be \"overhauled\".</p><p>Tribunals can be costly for businesses as well as employees, said policy director Tina McKenzie.</p><p>\"There's currently more than a year's waiting list, and if the government brings in the reforms its proposing, it's going to get a lot worse,\" she says.</p><p>She said the most common reason an award from an employment tribunal isn't paid is that the company becomes insolvent – something she says has been a particular issue in the post-pandemic years covered by the data.</p></div><div><p>People who run limited companies are not personally liable for that company's debts.</p><p>The FSB's Tina McKenzie says it's \"not ok\" that some people miss out on their awards – but argues that she isn't surprised when \"500,000 business have closed over the last four to five years\".</p><p>She thinks there could be a case for a \"central UK pot\" that pays out those who are owed a tribunal award when a company becomes insolvent.</p><p>A government spokesperson said: \"We recognise it requires improvement as we intend to strengthen enforcement of unpaid awards as part of the Plan for Change.\"</p></div></article>"

    "body": "<div><div><p>8 hours ago</p></div><p><span><p><span>Joe Tidy</span><span>Cyber Correspondent, BBC World Service</span></p></span></p></div><div><p>Hackers who attempted to extort a nursery chain by posting stolen images and data about children on the darknet have removed the posts and claim to have deleted the information.</p><p>The criminals <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c62ldyvpwv9o\">began posting profiles</a> of the children to their website last Thursday, adding another 10 children days later and <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c07vxv8v89lo\">vowing to continue </a>until Kido Schools paid a ransom in Bitcoin.</p><p>The criminals also contacted parents directly with threatening phone calls whilst trying to get their ransom paid.</p><p>But public revulsion at their attack appears to have forced the criminals to backtrack.</p></div><div><p>First they blurred the images but kept the data up - now they have taken all the information offline, and apologised for their actions.</p><p>Their apparent change of heart has been met with scepticism by experts, who had previously condemned the targeting of nurseries as a \"new low\" for cyber-criminals.</p><p>\"This is more about pragmatism than morality,\" said cyber-security expert Jen Ellis.</p><p>\"These criminals are clearly shocked and worried by the attention their hack has caused and they are trying to protect themselves or their brand.\"</p></div><div><p>The hackers claim to have deleted everything they took - which included the private details and pictures of around 8,000 children as well as contact information for parents and carers.</p><p>\"All child data is now being deleted. No more remains and this can comfort parents,\" one of the cyber-criminals involved told the BBC.</p><p>It's understood Kido have not paid the hackers a ransom which was thought to be around £600,000.</p><p>Past cases have shown that hackers often say they have deleted stolen data and been found to have kept it or sold it on.</p><p>When the UK's National Crime Agency <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-68344987\">took down the cyber crime gang LockBit</a> they discovered troves of data still on the criminal's servers that victims had paid to be deleted.</p><p>The nursery hackers, calling themselves Radiant, appear to be concerned that their hack has crossed an undefined moral line since the public outcry began against them.</p><p>\"We are sorry for hurting kids,\" the cyber-criminals told BBC News.</p><p>It's not known who the hackers or hacker are but they appear to be a new and possibly inexperienced group. </p><p>Their darknet site is newly created but they claim to have carried out other hacks in the past.</p><p>This isn't the first time that cyber-criminals have backtracked on an attack.</p><p>In 2020 a gang using Dopplepaymer ransomware gifted their encryption key to a German hospital after the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-54204356\">chaos contributed to the death</a> of an emergency care patient.</p><p>When <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-57184977\">Conti hackers attacked the Irish Health Service</a> in 2021 they too gave their antidote away for free claiming not to have deliberately targeted hospitals.</p><p>Months before, criminals from the Darkside group took the strange decision to post proof that they had <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-54591761\">donated some of their ill-gotten bitcoin</a> to charities.</p><p>The nursery hackers claimed they broke into the nursery's systems by buying access to one of Kido's staff computers which was compromised by a separate hacker.</p><p>In a common process, the \"initial access broker\" sold the Kido access to Radiant, which went on to further infiltrate Kido's systems and steal the data.</p><p>The majority of the downloaded material including the pictures of children was taken from Kido's account with Famly - a popular early years education platform . </p><p>Famly has rejected Kido's message to parents that the breach happened as a result of Famly being compromised.</p><p>It has stressed to the BBC that neither the security or infrastructure of the platform has been compromised at any point.</p><p>Kido did not respond to a request for comment about the way the hackers stole the data. </p><p>A spokesperson said only that: \"We recently identified and responded to a cyber incident. We are working with external specialists to investigate and determine what happened in more detail. </p><p>\"We swiftly informed both our families and the relevant authorities and continue to liaise closely with them.\"</p><p>Radiant says it paid the initial access broker money for access to Kido's system. </p><p>So with Kido refusing to pay and the hackers giving up their extortion attempt the criminals appear to have actually lost money in this cyber-attack.</p></div>"
