When the changes become significantly different, the new virus types are known as variants.</p><p><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://health.stonybrookmedicine.edu/understanding-covid-19-variant-stratus-what-you-need-to-know/\">According to some reports</a>, there may be tell-tale symptoms with the latest ones - a hoarse voice or a \"razor blade\" sore throat.</p><p>Covid can still cause a wide range of symptoms, including headache, coughing, a blocked or running nose and exhaustion, making it difficult to distinguish from a cold or flu. </p><p>If you think you have Covid you should avoid contact with vulnerable people and stay at home if possible. </p><p>If you have symptoms and need to leave the house, advice remains that you should wear a face covering. Washing hands regularly and using and disposing tissues in bins can reduce the spread of this and other respiratory illnesses.</p><p>For a sore throat, drinking plenty of fluids and having a <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/covid-19/covid-19-symptoms-and-what-to-do/\">teaspoon of honey</a> may help, the NHS says. </p><p>According to the Royal College of GPs, rates of Covid are now <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.rcgp.org.uk/getmedia/b616af10-1640-474a-b457-b0dbd2a1ed1f/WeeklyReport-wk38-2025-Wednesday.pdf\">increasing across the UK</a>, especially in the very young and elderly.</p><p><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://ukhsa-dashboard.data.gov.uk/respiratory-viruses/covid-19\">Hospital admissions</a> linked to Covid are also going up. </p></div><p></p><h2>Can I still get a Covid test or vaccine?</h2><p></p><div><p>People over 75 can get a free vaccine against Covid on the NHS. This can offer good protection, even against the new variants, says the UK Health Security Agency  (UKHSA). </p><p>It is urging people to book their vaccinations against flu and another common winter virus called RSV (respiratory syncytial virus) as cases start to increase ahead of winter. </p><p>\"It's normal for viruses to mutate and change, and as more data becomes available on these variants,  we'll have a better understanding of how they interact with our immune systems and how to optimise our protection, as well as actions we can take to keep the most vulnerable safe and live our lives as normally as possible,\" says the UKHSA.</p><p>\"The most important thing is for those eligible to get their vaccination when it is due.\"</p><p>It's possible to catch Covid again even if you have had it very recently, or have been vaccinated. Reinfections are usually mild, but you can feel unwell and still spread the virus to others. </p><p>Covid tests are no longer widely available for free, but pharmacies still sell them. </p><p>A number of High Street chemists and private clinics sell Covid vaccines too. The cost varies, with some charging around £99 for a single dose.</p></div></article>"

ago.</p><p>\"The original project came about because of a piece we did with BBC Look North about a client of ours and her son who was injured and ended up in hospital having an operation because of a splinter in his big toe,\" he says.</p><p>\"That was a thing at the time that shocked me because the mum was paying £14 weekly for a carpet for her lounge but couldn't afford anything else anywhere else in the property.\"</p><p>As Andrew drives back and forth, collecting and unloading carpets, he tells me that he rented a warehouse and created a community interest company, Carpets Like a Boss, after receiving a big donation of flooring.</p><p>John Clark from Mercado Flooring is watching the delivery being unloaded.</p><p>\"We get quite a lot of end of lines, distressed stock and it devalues over time so we utilise that stock in a better way,\" he explains.</p><p>\"Giving a bit back to the local community is the best use of our resources, I would say.\"</p><p>Since 2023 Noah's Ark Centre and, later the Carpets Like a Boss project, have carpeted more than 600 homes in Calderdale, and there are still around 80 people on the waiting list.</p></div><figure><div><p><img

    "body": "<div><div><p>43 minutes ago</p></div><p><span><p><span>Lucy Williamson</span><span>Middle East Correspondent, Jerusalem</span></p></span></p></div><div><p>He promised total victory for Israel, but standing next to Donald Trump at the White House on Monday, it was Benjamin Netanyahu who looked defeated.</p><p>Israel's prime minister was saying all the right things about the peace deal he had just agreed to, but he seemed deflated, his voice hoarse and his energy dimmed, as he praised Trump as \"the greatest friend Israel has ever had in the White House\".</p><p>It is a friendship that could cost him his government.</p><p>Netanyahu's far-right allies have threatened to leave – and possibly collapse – his government if he makes too many concessions in ending the war. Coalition partners like Bezalel Smotrich and Itamar Ben-Gvir have made little secret of their desire to annex Gaza, drive out Palestinians and re-establish Jewish settlements there. </p><p>They – and Netanyahu – have been implacably opposed to any role for the Palestinian Authority in Gaza, and any pathway to a Palestinian State. The deal Netanyahu has now agreed to outlines both, though with heavy caveats.</p><p>Trump knows that by pushing the Israeli prime minister into this deal, he is asking him to risk his government. In return, he is dangling the prospect of a historic legacy – a new, more peaceful future for the region, and new ties between Israel and its Arab neighbours.</p></div><div><p>There were signs, even before Netanyahu left for Washington, that he knew this choice was coming.</p><p>Israel's president, Isaac Herzog, told an Israeli radio station that he was considering pardoning Netanyahu in the corruption cases he is currently facing in court. These trials are one reason, his critics allege, that he is reluctant to leave office and face the judges without the shield of his national duties, power and profile.</p><p>But the political exit being offered to him in this moment – a regional legacy in return for giving up his government, and possibly his political career – does not seem to have entirely won him over.</p><p>His first response to his countrymen today has been to publicly emphasise that he did not, in fact, agree to a Palestinian state.</p><p>\"Absolutely not. It's not even written in the agreement,\" he said in response to a question on camera. \"But we did say one thing – that we would forcibly resist a Palestinian state.\"</p><p>Reports in the Israeli media this morning also suggest that Israel's cabinet will not get to vote on the full terms of the deal – but only on the exchange of Israeli hostages for Palestinian prisoners.</p><p>The question is what these actions signify about his political calculation: whether Netanyahu is trying to hold his government together long enough to work his political magic on the polls, which currently predict he would lose an election, or whether he is banking on Hamas rejecting this deal – or being unable to control its commanders on the ground in Gaza – and that the war will not stop at all.</p><p>The potential continuation of the war was something he emphasised in that uncomfortable press conference in Washington, underlining – with Trump's backing – that Israel would have free reign to \"finish the job\" if Hamas failed to deliver on its side of the deal. Seen in that light, this uncomfortable moment could be the price of continuing American support for his war.</p><p>Netanyahu is known as a master of political manoeuvres, threading a path between political roadblocks to buy time. He has shifted position through previous rounds of negotiations, and has ridden through previous ceasefire deals, only to back out when a permanent end to the war is up for discussion.</p><p>Many believe he has never wanted to negotiate an end to this war, but to force Hamas into a surrender on Israel's terms. But it is hard to maintain that uncompromising image of \"total victory\" when you have publicly conceded to the very things you have spent a career preventing, and when you are waiting for your enemy's response.</p><p>For the first time since the war began, it seems that the consequences of avoiding this deal were worse than the consequences of agreeing to it. And if Trump really did force him to choose between his ally in Washington and his allies at home, why didn't Joe Biden do the same when a similar deal was on the table nine months ago – and some 30,000 more Gazans were still alive?</p></div>"

    "body": "<div><div><p>6 hours ago</p></div><p><span><p><span>Mahfouz Zubaide</span><span>Afghanistan producer</span></p></span></p></div><div><p>Fahima Noori had big dreams when she graduated from university in Afghanistan. </p><p>She had studied law, graduated from a midwifery programme and even worked in a mental health clinic.</p><p>But all that was taken away when the Taliban swept into power in 2021. They banned girls over the age of 12 from getting an education, severely restricted job options for women and recently removed books written by women from universities.</p><p>For Fahima, the internet was her last lifeline to the outside world. </p><p>\"I recently enrolled in an online university [and] I had hoped to finish my studies and find an online job,\" she said. </p><p>On Tuesday, that lifeline was cut off when the Taliban imposed a nationwide internet shutdown that is set to last indefinitely. </p><p>\"Our last hope was online learning. Now [even] that dream has been destroyed,\" said Fahima.</p><p>Her real name has been changed to protect her identity, as have the names of all others interviewed for this article.</p></div><div><p>Over the past few weeks, the Taliban government began severing fibre-optic internet connections across several provinces, saying this was part of an effort to prevent immorality. </p><p>For many, they feared this might be the first step towards an entire internet shutdown.</p><p>And on Tuesday, their worst fears came true. The country is currently experiencing a \"total internet blackout\" according to internet watchdog Netblocks - a move that has paralysed the country's essential services. </p><p>International news agencies say they have lost contact with offices in the capital Kabul. Mobile internet and satellite TV has also been severely disrupted across Afghanistan. Flights from Kabul airport have also been disrupted, according to local media reports.</p><ul><li><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cdxqdy5nrlqo\">Flights in Afghanistan grounded after internet shutdown</a></li></ul><p>Ahead of the nationwide shutdown, the BBC spoke to some people in Afghanistan who detailed how the internet outages in their provinces had derailed their lives.</p><p>\"Before this, I studied midwifery, but unfortunately that programme was banned for women... the only hope left for us was the internet and online learning,\" said Shakiba, who lives in the northern province of Tahkar. </p><p>\"We want to study. We want to be educated. We want to be able to help people in our future. When I heard that the internet had been cut, the world felt dark to me.\"</p><p>It's a similar tale for Fahima, who says she now feels \"helpless\".</p><p>\"My two sisters [and I] were studying online. We used to stay updated on news and technology through the internet, but now we cannot keep up or learn new skills,\" said the student, who lives in an eastern province of Afghanistan. </p><p>\"We dreamed of finishing our education and helping our father financially, but now... we all sit at home doing nothing.\"</p><p>Since seizing power in 2021, the Taliban have imposed numerous restrictions in accordance with their interpretation of Islamic Sharia law.</p><p>Earlier this month they removed books written by women from the country's university teaching system as part of a new ban which has also outlawed the teaching of human rights and sexual harassment.</p><p>Around 140 books by women - including titles like \"Safety in the Chemical Laboratory\" - were found to be of \"concern\" due to \"anti-Sharia and Taliban policies\", said the Taliban. </p><p>The Taliban government has said it respects women's rights in accordance with their interpretation of Afghan culture and Islamic law.</p></div><div><p>But it's not just female students that have been affected - teachers like Zabi, who used to make a living through online teaching, have been similarly hit by the ban.</p><p>Zabi says he had previously worked as a journalist in Pakistan, but found no opportunities in the field when he returned to Afghanistan. He decided to open an English teaching centre - but was forced to take this online when authorities imposed restrictions on educational institutes, he says.</p><p>\"I had men and women in my classes - up to 70 or 80 students at a time. My students were happy and our lessons went smoothly,\" he said. \"They were all preparing for the IELTS [a standardised English test] and all their learning depended on the internet. The research, the practice tests, the official exams, everything.\"</p><p>Zabi, who also lives in the east of the country, adds that there is no IELTS centre in Afghanistan, so the only option for students is to take one online. </p><p>\"Two days ago, about 45 of my students were in the middle of an exam when the internet was cut off. They had been preparing for it for months, but they missed the opportunity. It was heartbreaking for them - and for me as their teacher.\"</p><p>He adds that he constantly gets calls from his students who don't know what to do. </p><p>\"They keep calling me asking 'Teacher, what should we do?' For the boys, there are still some English  centres open, but for my female students, this was their last chance. And now even that is gone.\"</p><p>Prior to Monday's shutdown, many of the interviewees say that there is still the option of being connected to mobile data - but that this is far too expensive for most, and that connectivity is patchy. A monthly plan with 100GB of data costs 3,500 Afghani, or around $50 (£37). In contrast, Wifi used to cost around 1,000 Afghani a month - which could be further split between a few students. </p><p>According to an earlier UNDP report, Afghanistan's per capita income stood at $306 in 2024. </p><p>Zabi says he will need to leave the country if the internet is not restored soon - saying he has no other way of earning a living. </p><p>The Taliban have yet to give an official reason for the shutdown. They had earlier said an alternative route for internet access would be created, but did not give any more details. </p><p>Anas, a money changer in Takhar province, says his business has faced \"enormous problems\" since the internet shutdown, saying that much of his work depends on the internet. </p><p>\"Our business has been affected by about 90%,\" he says. \"Yesterday, my brother who is also my business partner tried to send an email to a client. He couldn't get it through.\"</p><p>But his main concern are his three daughters - all of whom used to take online classes. </p><p>\"The night before, we heard the Taliban had cut internet access in Mazar, and my eldest daughter came to me with tears in her eyes and said she feared the same would happen here. </p><p>\"Their last opportunity to study is now gone. Seeing my children so helpless... [that was] the hardest for me. Only God knows what will happen to them and to me.\"</p></div>"
