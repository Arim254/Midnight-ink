They currently house <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/migobs/viz/Asylumaccommodation-March2025/10\">about 32,000 people across the UK</a>, down from 51,000 in 2023.</p><p>Asylum hotels - including two of those I visited - have become a focus for vocal and sometimes violent protests this summer, after a resident of one hotel in Epping, Essex, sexually assaulted a 14-year-old girl.</p><p>Journalists aren't normally allowed inside the hotels, but I gained access through migrant contacts who had made the journey across the English Channel from France.</p><p>The hotels were never intended to be used like this. The rooms look smart on review sites on the internet - with sofas, televisions, double beds, ensuite bathrooms. Everything is there, and you would be pleased if one was yours for a couple of nights.</p><p>What the pictures don't show is the wear-and-tear and the build-up of possessions that come from continuous occupancy over months and years.</p><p>Where reception once was, there are now security desks. Outside, there are bollards and warnings that the public aren't allowed in.</p></div><div><p>At the hotels housing families, I am struck by the number of prams in the reception areas, and by how many babies and toddlers there are. With little or no communal space, younger children are left to play in empty corridors.</p><p>In one of the hotels, a friendly security guard, Curtis, shows me a makeshift running track he has set up for the children in an unused car park - and the bikes in the storeroom he has found and repaired.</p><p>When I ask the Home Office how many children have been born in asylum hotels, it tells me there are no figures available.</p><p>One of the first babies I meet is proudly held aloft by his father - they arrived from Somalia just weeks earlier and he tells me this is a \"British baby\", born on \"British soil\", who will, one day he believes, hold a British passport.</p><p>This is not, in fact, the case. The Home Office can still deport asylum seekers who have babies in the UK, although, according to Jon Featonby of the Refugee Council, there are extra safeguards which make it harder to forcibly remove them.</p></div><div><p>Kadir and Mira - the couple who cooked me a meal - have also had a baby since being in the UK. Kadir says he, his wife and their two older children were forced to flee Iraq. In his home country, Kadir says he had worked as a translator but was targeted by criminals.</p><p>The family has been moved between different hotels all over the UK since they arrived nine years ago. The Home Office initially rejected Kadir's case because of what it said was lack of proof. Two unsuccessful appeals followed. A third is currently under way.</p><p>The family occupies two adjoining hotel rooms - one for Kadir, Mira and their baby, and the other for their 12-year-old daughter, Shayan, and 14-year-old son, Roman.</p></div><figure><div><p><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20250905-110137-f27f908f49-web-2.29.1-3/grey-placeholder.png\" /><img srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/8d84/live/c71e2710-97cc-11f0-af62-91486a511a31.jpg.webp 240w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/8d84/live/c71e2710-97cc-11f0-af62-91486a511a31.jpg.webp 320w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/8d84/live/c71e2710-97cc-11f0-af62-91486a511a31.jpg.webp 480w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/8d84/live/c71e2710-97cc-11f0-af62-91486a511a31.jpg.webp 640w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/8d84/live/c71e2710-97cc-11f0-af62-91486a511a31.jpg.webp 800w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/8d84/live/c71e2710-97cc-11f0-af62-91486a511a31.jpg.webp 1024w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/8d84/live/c71e2710-97cc-11f0-af62-91486a511a31.jpg.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/8d84/live/c71e2710-97cc-11f0-af62-91486a511a31.jpg.webp\" alt=\"Joe Dixie/BBC Two women with faces covered and a small child sit on a carpeted floor in a softly lit room with a large window.

It's crazy.\"</p><p>I accompany Mira and Shayan as they go for a walk to a local chemist to pick up a prescription. It means braving a line of protesters shouting \"Go home!\" at them. They keep their heads down as police escort them through.</p></div><div><p>Later, I ask 12-year-old Shayan how she feels about the protests.</p><p>She says she wants to engage with the protesters and is frustrated the hotel staff won't allow her: \"Me and my friends have always wanted to go up to them and speak to them face-to-face. What is their problem with the kids as well?\"</p><p>Shayan and her brother say they are often reluctant to take the school bus that comes to collect them each weekday. \"You never know what [the protesters] will do to the bus,\" she says, adding that she is afraid one of them might try to board it.</p><p>She wants to stay in the UK, she says, but her life so far has been spent in uncertain circumstances: \"Once we get settled in a place, then they move us, and then we've got to learn where we come from, like, learn that area, go to a new school, make new friends, and then once we've done that, they move us again.\"</p><p>The Home Office says it is identifying more suitable relocation sites for asylum seekers, such as disused buildings and former military facilities.</p><p>In the meantime, \"we expect all providers to uphold the highest standards in preserving the safety, security, and wellbeing of those in their care\", said a spokesperson.</p><p>Since talking to me at the asylum hotel, Kadir and his family have been told they are to be moved on once more - to two hotels in different cities. Kadir and his baby daughter have been offered accommodation in one hotel, and Mira, Shayan and Roman in another, nearly 200 miles away.</p><p>But they are refusing to go. Kadir has already been told he has lost his weekly benefit and there is a chance the family will be deemed to have made themselves intentionally homeless.</p><p>The future for the family - like many other asylum seekers - remains anything but certain.</p></div></article>"

He made over 100 appearances across 10 years for New Zealand provincial side Waikato but never reached Test level.</p><p>During his time at Waikato, Mitchell also played a season in the All-Ireland League for Limerick-based Garryowen.</p><p>His return to Ireland in 1996, to work under fellow New Zealander Murray Kidd, who had coached at Garryowen, marked the beginning of his coaching ascent.</p><p>An opportunity arose the following season to take charge of Sale Sharks and he moved to England for the first time.</p><p>By 1997 Mitchell was in the England camp, specialising in defence under the leadership of Sir Clive Woodward.</p><p>\"He is a man that expects commitment. If you are committed to the team and him as a coach then he'll give you everything back,\" former England full-back Matt Perry recalled.</p><p>\"Being a proud Kiwi coaching England, the drills were challenging and brutal and you had to have the right mindset.</p><p>\"With defence you don't have to be angry but on your mettle at all times and really want to make tackles.

Don't let it become Farage's Britain,\" he told the conference.</p><p>He also stepped up his attacks on tech mogul Elon Musk, the owner of X, whom he said wanted to see a \"Wild West on social media\" and would benefit from Reform's plans to repeal online safety laws passed two years ago.</p><p>And in a striking image, he claimed Farage would relax British gun laws, forcing schools to teach children \"what to do in case of a mass shooting\".</p><p>A spokesman for Sir Ed said it was a reference to remarks Farage made in 2014, as leader of UKIP, when he had criticised \"kneejerk\" restrictions on handguns imposed after the 1996 Dunblane massacre.</p><p>But a Reform source accused the Lib Dem leader of \"spouting total madness\" and said the party had no plans to change gun laws in the UK should it win power. </p></div><p></p><h2>'Battle of ideas'</h2><p></p><div><p>Following his party's success at last year's election, when it won 72 MPs after picking up a swathe of Tory-held seats, Sir Ed set out a target to overtake the Conservatives at the next general election, which must take place by 2029.</p><p>The speech was light on policy detail, with Sir Ed instead trying to frame the next election as a \"battle of ideas for the future of our country\".</p><p>Evoking a land of \"county shows and school fairs; fish and chips; village greens and cricket pavilions\", he depicted the Lib Dems as the natural home for \"One Nation conservatives\" who rejected the \"divisive\" direction Kemi Badenoch has taken as Tory leader.</p><p>He lauded Britain as \"the place Hollywood comes to make Barbie, Spider-Man and Mission Impossible, the land of the Lionesses and the home of Formula One\", and the land of \"Windermere and Loch Ness, male voice choirs and Hogmanay\".</p><p>Attacking Reform's recently-announced plans to <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c5yk4r5e514o\">deport hundreds of thousands</a> of migrants as unpatriotic, he argued that sending Afghan asylum seekers back to face the Taliban \"isn't who we are\". </p><p>Repeatedly referring to Britain as a \"caring country\", he added: \"We are a nation that believes in tolerance, decency, and respect for both individual freedom and the rule of law.\" </p><p>He also called on the UK government to offer discounted visas to US cancer scientists who had lost funding under the Trump administration's \"anti-science agenda\".</p></div><p></p><h2>Gaza 'genocide'</h2><p></p><div><p>Sir Ed devoted a section of his speech to attacking Labour, telling the conference the party was \"looking more and more like Continuity Sunak\" - a reference to the Tory leader defeated at last year's election.</p><p>Sir Ed said his party would do a better job of growing the economy by negotiating a \"new customs union\" with the European Union.</p><p>He also welcomed Sir Keir Starmer's decision over the weekend to <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c1wggrdn9dno\">recognise a Palestinian state</a>, adding his party had \"led the charge\" in urging the diplomatic move for almost a decade.</p><p>He accused Israel of committing genocide in Gaza, adding it was important to \"call it by its name\". Israel has strongly denied genocide allegations, which are also being examined by the International Court of Justice.</p><p>He also complained that Farage gets an \"easy ride from the media\" and too much coverage on the BBC. </p><p>In response, the corporation said Sir Ed's \"continuing attacks on BBC journalism are completely groundless\".</p><p>\"It is simply false to say that we give any political party any less scrutiny than another,\" the corporation added.  </p></div></article>"

Such dangerous pseudo-science is putting pregnant women and children at risk and devaluing autistic people.</p><p>\"Let's be clear – painkillers do not cause autism and vaccines do not cause autism.\"</p><p>But it was on vaccines where the president made perhaps his most alarming comments without any recourse to science or statistics. </p><p>He said fragile babies were being pumped full of liquid like they were \"horses\" and that combination vaccines were harmful. </p><p>He singled out the MMR (measles, mumps and rubella) vaccine as one that should be given in single doses rather than a combined shot, and that he had heard a lot of bad things about it over the years. </p><p>This has echoes of the totally discredited claims of Andrew Wakefield - the British doctor who was struck off the UK's medical register for his unethical research and his debunked claims that linked the MMR jab to autism. </p><p>President Trump's comments on vaccines will be roundly rejected and condemned by UK policy makers, but they can't be ignored. This is because they risk further undermining trust in immunisation - one of the great health success stories of the  past century. </p><p>If parents refrain from getting their children vaccinated as a result of his unfounded claims, it risks the re-emergence of diseases like measles, whooping cough and polio which are already beginning to make a worrying comeback.  </p><p>Combination vaccines are the mainstay of childhood immunisation. They spare children from dozens of repeat visits to be injected. </p><p>President Trump suggested vaccines should be given in single doses, but this means children would be left unprotected for long periods while waiting for the next dose. </p><p>Health policy deserves hard facts. </p><p>What we saw last night at the White House was comment and the potential for huge confusion. </p></div>"

    "body": "<div><p>The drone incursion that stopped flights at Copenhagen airport on Monday night was \"the most severe attack on Danish infrastructure so far\", Denmark's Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen said. </p><p>Kastrup airport in Copenhagen was forced to shut for several hours from around 20:30 (18:30 GMT) on Monday following the sighting of a number of drones. </p><p>\"It says something about the times we live in and what we as a society must be prepared to deal with,\" Frederiksen told reporters.</p><p>Russian involvement could not be ruled out, Frederiksen added - although Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov called the allegations \"unfounded\". </p></div><div><p>The Danish PM made a link between last night's events in Denmark and the recent Russian drone incursions in Poland and Romania, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/czrp6p5mj3zo\">as well as the violation of Estonian airspace by Russian fighter jets</a>.</p><p>Frederiksen said that the motive for the incursion in Copenhagen had likely been to \"disrupt, create unrest... to see how far you can go and test the limits.\"</p><p>Danish intelligence mirrored this assessment, saying the country was facing a \"high threat of sabotage\".</p><p>\"Someone may not necessarily want to attack us, but rather stress us out and see how we react,\" said Flemming Drejer, director of operations at Denmark's intelligence service PET.</p><p>In nearby Norway, Oslo airport too was closed for a period after possible drone sightings. </p><p>Around 20,000 passengers were <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cn4lj1yvgvgo\">impacted by the closure of Copenhagen airport</a>, which resumed operations after midnight local time.</p><p>Earlier on Tuesday Danish police stated they did not know who was behind the drones, but that evidence suggested it was a \"capable actor.\"</p><p>A number of large drones which had come from different directions \"quite a long way away\" had been observed at Copenhagen airport, said police Inspector Jens Jespersen. </p><p>He added the drones, which turned their lights on and off as they approached the airport, had been operated by someone who had the \"will and tools to show off... perhaps also to practice.\"</p><p>Police did not shoot down the drones because the airport is located in a densely built-up area and because there were planes in the air, Insp Jespersen told reporters. </p><p>In a post on social media Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky referenced \"Russia's violation\" of Nato airspace in Copenhagen on 22 September.  </p><p>Insp Jespersen refused to comment on Zelensky's allegations. </p><p>\"It's not because I don't want to, it's because I simply don't know,\" he said.</p><p>The Norwegian Police Security Service said it was working to clarify whether the  unconfirmed drone sighting at Oslo airport could be related to the drones observed in Denmark.</p><p>Oslo airport was closed between 00:30 and 03:30 and fourteen flights had to be diverted. </p><p>Norway's government said Russia has violated Norwegian airspace three times in 2025 - in April, July and August - adding that it was unclear if this was deliberate or the result of navigation errors. </p><p>\"Regardless of the cause, this is not acceptable,\" Prime Minister Jonas Gahr Store said.</p><p>Tensions have been escalating recently after Russian drones and aircraft ventured into central and eastern European airspace, three and a half years after Moscow launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine.</p><p>Earlier in September <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/clydk8821nro\">at least three Russian drones were shot down by Polish and other Nato aircraft in Poland's airspace</a>. Moscow denied it had been trying to target facilities on Polish soil. </p><p>A similar incident occurred in <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c80g7g5rmlno\">Romania only a few days later</a> when a drone flew into Romanian airspace before disappearing from the radar.</p><p>And on Saturday three Russian MiG-31 fighter jets entered Estonian skies and remained there for 12 minutes, leading Nato jets to be scrambled. The incursions were part of a \"wider pattern of increasingly irresponsible Russian behaviour,\" Nato said in a statement on Tuesday. </p><p>In recent days Poland stated it would shoot down any objects that violated its airspace, while Sweden promised to do the same if it spotted any Russian aircraft in its skies.</p><p>In response to Russia's incursions into Poland and Romania, Nato has pledged to move troops and fighter jets eastwards.</p><p>Planes from the UK, France, Germany and Denmark are taking part in air defence missions over Poland in a bid to bolster the alliance's eastern flank.</p></div>"
