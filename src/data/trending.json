And he may thereby extinguish the agencies' bipartisanship and independence, \" Justice Kagan added.</p><p>The Supreme Court's Monday ruling said the justices would hear arguments in December on overturning a 1935 decision that allowed Congress to set up independent agencies insulated from political interference.</p><p>In the 90-year-old ruling known as Humphrey's Executor, the court sided with another FTC commissioner who was fired by Franklin D Roosevelt. The justices then ruled that commissioners could be removed only for misconduct or neglect of duty.</p><p>The FTC, which enforces consumer protection, typically has five commissioners - three from the president's party and two from the opposing party.</p><p>Slaughter and Alvaro Bedoya, two Democratic members of the FTC, were fired by Trump in March. </p><p>A federal judge ruled in July in favour of Slaughter, declaring her dismissal \"unlawful\" under the longstanding precedent. Bedoya later resigned, but Slaughter continued her legal battle.</p><p>Earlier this month, the Supreme Court issued a temporary order permitting Trump to proceed with the dismissal as the justices considered whether to take up the case - a move now confirmed by Monday's decision.</p><p>Separately, the court is also considering the Trump administration's request to remove Lisa Cook as a Federal Reserve governor. </p><p>Cook was fired in August after the administration accused her of committing mortgage fraud. </p><p>The governor has denied any wrongdoing, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c0ezqr7l774o\">and a federal court sided with her</a> stating the president did not have the power to remove her.</p></div>"

Costs to purchase a visa can exceed £1,000.</p><p>In his conference speech, Sir Ed will argue that the UK should be \"stepping into the vacuum left by Trump's anti-science agenda - leading the world in the fight against cancer\".</p><p>The Liberal Democrat leader is also expected to criticise Reform UK party members for applauding a US decision <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c74dzdddvmjo\">to cut research for mRNA vaccines. </a></p><p>Twenty-two projects had been examining how the vaccine technology could counter viruses such as bird flu. </p><p>Sir Ed will say: \"It is hard to express the cruelty and stupidity of cutting off research into medicine that has the power to save so many lives.\"</p></div><div><p>In addition to criticising Trump, Sir Ed has also been increasingly vocal in his attacks on the billionaire and former Trump ally Elon Musk.</p><p>On Sunday, he called on the UK's communications regulator Ofcom to \"go after\" Musk over \"crimes\" he claims are being committed on the tech mogul's social media platform X.</p><p>Sir Ed has also accused Musk of \"inciting violence\" when he addressed a rally in London via video link. In response, the X owner called the Liberal Democrat leader a \"craven coward\".</p><p>Asked by Sky News if he was worried about legal threats from Musk, Sir Ed said: \"If he ... sues me, let's see how he fares, because I don't think he'll win.\"</p><p>The Lib Dems have become well known for their political stunts alongside a policy offer focused on social care and other priorities under Sir Ed's leadership.</p><p>It brought them success at last year's general election, with the party winning 72 seats in the House of Commons - its highest ever share.</p><p>But the Lib Dems have struck a more serious tone at this year's conference, as the party considers it's next move ahead of local elections next year.</p><p>On the opening night of the conference, former Lib Dem leader Tim Farron draped himself in a flag and called on members to \"reclaim patriotism\" from the far right.</p><p>Farron told a hall full of activists to \"stop being so flaming squeamish and English\" and reclaim the UK's flags from groups who seek to \"divide and destroy\".</p><p>Unusually for the Lib Dems, they have gone out of their way to claim that they are the true patriots, in contrast to Farage, who they have dubbed a \"plastic patriot\".</p><p>In <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c33rp46nr1jo\">an interview with the BBC</a>, Sir Ed said his party has a moral duty to keep Farage and his Reform UK party out of power.</p></div>"
