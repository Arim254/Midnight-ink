But for some, a loss of libido is common after life-changing events, such as pregnancy and childbirth, according to the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.nhsinform.scot/illnesses-and-conditions/sexual-and-reproductive/loss-of-libido/#:~:text=Loss%20of%20libido%20(sex%20drive,as%20pregnancy%2C%20childbirth%20or%20breastfeeding.\">NHS</a>. </p><p>Reality TV star and fitness coach Holly Hagan-Blyth says this happened to her after having her son.</p><p>\"I could have said, 'listen, if you don't touch me ever again, I'm not even bothered' because that's just how I felt at the time,\"  she said when co-hosting the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p0ly6bkg\">CBeebies Parenting Helpline</a>. </p><p>Sex and relationship therapist Rachel Gold said mothers often expect to become intimate again after their six-week postnatal check.</p><p>\"I think that really fools people into believing that this must be the time to have sex again, but it isn't true.\" </p></div><div><p>Holly said her sex drive dipped after the arrival of her son Alpha-Jax in 2023 and she started to avoid any sort of intimacy.</p><p>\"Whenever I would give him [her husband Jacob] any type of affection, like a touch or a cuddle, I felt it was going to lead to the full thing, to sex, and I didn't want that.\"</p><p>\"I started having a negative connotation doing anything towards him.\"</p><p>Being open with her husband helped, she says.</p><p>\"As soon as I said, this is how I'm feeling, 'whenever I'm cuddling you and touching, can we just not make it lead to the next thing? Because it's just making me not want to do that', and all of a sudden everything was so much better because that pressure was taken off.\"</p></div><div><p>Her husband Jacob was worried she no longer fancied him.</p><p>\"I was like, 'you need to realise this has nothing to do with you. I am feeling this way at the moment, but I don't think any differently of you.'\"</p><p>\"I don't really feel like having sex right now, or even maybe in the next few months. This is my issue that I'm going through, and I just need to work through it.\"</p><p>Holly hopes that couples experiencing the same issues can be more open.</p><p>\"People do say the relationship changes after having a child, but I don't think that until you're in it, you really, truly, realise how much it changes.\"</p></div><div><p>Dr Jennifer Lincoln, a specialist in obstetrics and gynaecology, says there are many reasons why women may not want to have sex after giving birth. </p><p>\"There's a lot of healing that happens. It takes about six weeks for the uterus to return to its pre-pregnancy size. Any tears in the vagina or perineum are also healing.\"</p><p>There are also big hormonal changes for women which can impact their libido. </p><p>\"Levels of estrogen and progesterone drop drastically.

Its active ingredient is acetaminophen, better known as paracetamol outside of North America.</p><p>In a statement to the BBC, Tylenol maker Kenvue said the science clearly shows that taking acetaminophen does not cause autism. </p><p>\"We strongly disagree with any suggestion otherwise and are deeply concerned with the health risk this poses for expecting mothers.\"</p><p>Acetaminophen is the safest pain reliever option for pregnant women, it added, and without it, women face a dangerous choice between suffering through conditions like fever or using riskier alternatives.</p><p>Trump made the announcement in the Oval Office alongside Health Secretary Robert F Kennedy Jr who said the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) will issue a physicians notice about what he described as the potential risk of taking Tylenol during pregnancy.</p><p>He said the FDA will also begin the process of initiating a safety label change on the medication and launch a public health campaign to spread awareness.</p><p>Kennedy added that the FDA will soon approve leucovorin, a decades-old drug traditionally used to protect cancer patients against toxicity from chemotherapy, to be used as treatment for children with autism.</p><p>FDA Commissioner Marty Makary said the approval will be based on research that he said suggests the drug may help children with autism who are deficient in folate, a form of vitamin B,<b> </b>improve their verbal communication.</p><p>But researchers have cautioned that the science is still in the very early stages, and more work is needed before any firm conclusions can be reached.</p></div><div><p>The Autism Science Foundation, a US charity, said low folate levels during early pregnancy have been linked in some studies to an increased risk of autism in children, though the findings are not consistent.</p><p>Studies in Norway, the US and Israel found that mothers who took folic acid supplements around conception had children with a 30-70% lower likelihood of autism. But other studies did not find a significant association.</p><p>The charity said the suggestion folate may improve some symptoms comes from trials of leucovorin, also known as folinic acid.</p><p>Some research has shown that unlike regular folic acid, folinic acid can more easily cross the blood brain barrier and address a deficiency of the vitamin.</p><p>Four small, randomised trials, all using different doses and measurements of success, have been carried out.

That will be the case because the frontman loves being brought into the game to hold it up or run down the channel.\"</p><p>So as Manchester United and Manchester City discard goalkeepers brought in as much for their ability with their feet as their hands, are we seeing the end to what Allardyce refers to as a 'pandemic' of playing out from the back?</p><p>\"It's changing again,\" he says. \"The damaging stats are that giving the ball away in your own half leads to a goal against you more often than the opposition building up from their own defence and scoring.</p><p>\"So perhaps the trend is going back to being more sensible about using the skills that you've got within your team to their maximum.

Long throws must be used. If a player's not comfortable, you don't use it. But if they are, you do,\" says Allardyce. </p><p>Excluding penalties, no team scored more than Sunderland's 14 goals from dead-ball situations that season.

They've changed slightly this year because everybody's had to spend a lot of time trying to stop them against that particular corner.\"</p><p>How do you best utilise a corner though?</p><p>\"The beauty is who puts the ball in the box.
