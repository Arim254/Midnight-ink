Fitful at the back, wasteful in possession, headless chickens in too many areas. Again.  </p><p>Even before the red, it looked likely that Martin's period of calm after Saturday's League Cup win over Hibernian was about to come to a shuddering and noisy end.</p><p>In losing the plot, Diomande more or less ensured that Rangers were losing this Europa League opener against Genk, currently Belgium's 14th best team.</p><p>In lunging in on Zakaria El Ouahdi, Diomande left his team-mates in a terrible lurch, already struggling with 11 and now sitting ducks with 10. </p><p>The lack of self-control was unforgivable, the look of confused innocence on his face in the aftermath a complete nonsense. </p><p>Diomande, who on his very best days looks like a player worthy of the jersey, has been nowhere near it this season. Too often he's been lazy in his work and now he was ridiculous in his discipline.</p></div><p></p><h2 id=\"Rangers-engulfed-in-deepening-apathy\"><span>'Rangers engulfed in deepening apathy'</span></h2><p></p><div><p>And so Martin was left, once again, to reap the whirlwind of those Rangers supporters who remained until the end. </p><p>Around 12,000 tickets went unsold - a reflection of a deepening apathy. The boos, now as much a part of the match-day experience as Broxi Bear, were heard again.</p><p>The chants demanding the manager's head were cranked up for the umpteenth time. It was grim. The cameras panned to the directors' box, where chairman Andrew Cavenagh and chief executive Patrick Stewart stood stony-faced.</p><p>A penny for Cavenagh's thoughts. The Rangers fans would cough up a lot more than that for an audience with the man, for a chance to air their views by way of a venting of the spleen.</p><p>Cavenagh has made it known that he's behind his manager, but it's just not credible to think that he has no doubts about what he's seeing. And it's unimaginable that he has no concerns about the way his - and other people's - money has been spent. </p><p>Is any single part of Rangers' operation working? Not really. Quality of play, results, recruitment, relationship with supporters - nothing is functioning. </p></div><div><figure><figcaption><span>Media caption, </span><p>Martin feels 'nothing but support' from Rangers hierarchy</p></figcaption></figure></div><div><p>Rangers were, and are, a hard, hard watch. They were, and are, pedestrian and predictable. Laborious. Tiresome. Everything looked so slow, so difficult, so unthreatening, save for the odd moment of energy from Djeidi Gassama on the left.</p><p>Genk missed a sitter at 0-0, then hit a post, then missed a penalty, or rather had it saved by Jack Butland. All of those moments happened before the break when the score was level.</p><p>Diomande's act of foolishness just put the tin hat on it. It gave Martin an excuse, and in his news conference later he took it. </p><p>But there was not a lot of positivity in Rangers' performance before that and there was no reason to believe that it would have been any better had Diomande not taken himself out of the game.</p><p>Genk are in the midst of a poor run themselves, with one win in five coming into this. This was their first clean sheet in 11 games, which is the kind of thing that happens when your goalkeeper doesn't have a save to make.</p><p>Like Rangers, they were under pressure. Like Rangers, they had cause to be anxious and negative, playing it tight and hoping for the best.</p><p>But they weren't. They were ambitious on the ball. They attacked the game, while Rangers flailed wildly. Their intensity, away from home, was impressive. </p><p>Whatever their coach Thorsten Fink said to them beforehand, they looked full of belief, a stark contrast to their hosts.</p></div><div><p><strong>'Someone at Rangers needs to take the bull by the horns'</strong></p><p>26/09/25</p></div><p></p><h2 id=\"Diomande-just-latest-to-let-Martin-down\"><span>'Diomande just latest to let Martin down'</span></h2><p></p><div><p>The lack of incisiveness in Martin's team is remarkable for a set of players put together for a relative king's ransom. </p><p>We're told that Rangers' net spend this summer has been £21m, including transfer fees and loan payments. You could put a dot between the 2 and the 1 and still wonder if they've got value.</p><p>They had Youssef Chermiti up front, a 21-year-old brought in from Everton at a cost of £8m. </p><p>It's easy to bash the young striker, but he didn't lack hunger or work-rate. What he lacked was a modicum of a chance, a sniff at goal. Just one. </p><p>The life of a Rangers centre-forward is a lonely existence right now. Isolated and joyless. They're on their own up there. Sink or sink would appear to be the range of their options.</p><p>Diomande's moment of madness was the last thing Martin needed, but it was Martin who picked him and it was Martin who picked others who struggled to make passes. </p><p>It was Martin, again, whose management of this team produced very little threat while giving up big chances even when it was 11 versus 11.</p><p>His midfielder let him down on Thursday, and on other days and nights it was others who let him down, didn't show enough leadership, failed to make a difference. </p><p>The cast of characters on that front is long and thunderously unimpressive. </p><p>Martin gets filleted but the Rangers players can't escape censure here. A lot of this mess is down to the manager, but not all of it.</p><p>He said the red changed the game and he was correct, but there's always something - players being anxious, a red card, a penalty not given, another decision given in error. There's a fatalism about all of this. </p><p>And on Sunday they have a trip to Livingston. Plastic pitch, canny manager, physical team motivated to the high heavens. A gauntlet awaits this meek Rangers outfit.</p></div><div><h2>Get in touch</h2><div><p>Send us your views on Rangers</p></div></div></article></div>"

Not only did they send a 70 year-old man to five years in jail, it was a shocking 20 years after the offence.</p><p>They also stipulated that the sentence was not \"suspensive\" – in other words they said he would go to jail even if he lodged an appeal, even though in French law pending an appeal he is in theory still innocent.</p><p>Just when you thought the old passions for and against the man were beginning to fade, suddenly they are back with a vengeance.</p><p>Many will feel some sympathy with Sarkozy – not necessarily that he is entirely guiltless in this matter of seeking Libyan campaign money.</p></div><div><p>But they will see some truth in his claims of victimisation: that there are indeed some in the Paris \"politico-mediatic-judicial\" establishment who loathe the former president and rejoice in bringing him down.</p><p>Look through another lens, though, and Sarkozy is not some hard-done-by ex-head of state, but an egotistical and highly influential political operator who has consistently pushed the law to its limits in order to get his way.</p><p>Why else would there be such a litany of lawsuits against him? Why else would Sarkozy already have been convicted on two other charges of corruption – once for trying to suborn a judge, and another time for illegal campaign funding?</p><p>And if the court has now decided to throw the book at him in the Libya affair,  maybe it is because the charge of trying to elicit election funds from a foreign dictator is actually a rather serious one.</p><p>It is all relevant today because even though Sarkozy is no longer the influential figure that some make him out to be, the arguments about this case echo through the hall of ruins that are French politics.</p><p>The right and far-right take up his cause, crying foul about left-wing judicial over-reach. Marine Le Pen – herself banned from running for the presidency because of a \"no-suspension\" clause in her own conviction early this year – was first to denounce the \"injustice\".</p><p>And the left sees it all as more evidence of rich men's privilege – the powerful getting more powerful by blithely ignoring the law.</p><p>Nicolas Sarkozy has long since left office, and there is no prospect of his returning.  He is a figure of the past.  But his case lays bare the divisions in a very divided country.</p></div>"

It's not going to happen.\"</p><p>Trump, who will meet Netanyahu on Monday, also said a Gaza deal was \"pretty close\". </p><p>Israel is facing increasing global pressure to end the war in Gaza and occupation of the West Bank as a wave of Western states formally recognise an independent Palestinian state. Far-right Israelis see annexation as a way to stop this prospect.</p></div><div><p>Ultranationalists in Netanyahu's governing coalition have repeated calls for Israel to annex the West Bank, part of the Palestinian territories, outright.</p><p>The UK and Germany say they have warned Israel against annexation, while UN Secretary General António Guterres said at the UN on Monday it would be \"morally, legally and politically intolerable\".</p><p>On Thursday, Trump told reporters in the Oval Office that he had spoken to Netanyahu as well as other Middle Eastern leaders. </p><p>\"We're getting pretty close to having a deal on Gaza, and maybe even peace,\" Trump said.</p><p>Addressing the UN General Assembly via video link on Thursday, Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas said he was ready to work with world leaders to <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/czdjgdnjnlgo\">implement a peace plan</a> for Israel and the Palestinians announced by France on Monday. </p><p>Abbas, 89, was barred by the US from travelling to New York to appear in person. </p><p>He thanked those countries which had recently recognised a Palestinian state in a wave of declarations that started with Canada, Australia, the UK and Portugal on Sunday, followed by France, Belgium, Luxembourg, Malta, Monaco, San Marino, Andorra, and Denmark. </p><p>The US is currently opposed to recognising Palestine, saying such a move is a reward for Hamas.</p><p>\"Hamas will not have a role to play in governance,\" Abbas said in his speech. He also called for a Palestinian state to assume \"full responsibilities\" for the Gaza Strip following an Israeli withdrawal and connect it with the Israeli-occupied West Bank.</p><p>Trump met on Tuesday at the United Nations with the leaders of key Arab and Muslim nations who warned him of consequences if Israel moved ahead with annexation.</p><p>\"I think the president of the US understands very well the risks and dangers of annexation in the West Bank,\" Saudi Arabia's Foreign Minister Prince Faisal bin Farhan told reporters.</p></div><div><p>On Wednesday morning Israel closed the only crossing between the Israeli-occupied West Bank and neighbouring Jordan, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c9wd74r0qdvo\">stopping more than two million Palestinians from accessing the outside world</a>.</p><p>The closure came days after two Israeli military personnel were shot dead near the crossing by a Jordanian gunman, who was killed at the scene.</p><p>In Gaza, more than 80 Palestinians, including women and children, were killed by Israeli fire on Wednesday, most of them in Gaza City, local hospitals said.</p><p>The Israeli military launched a campaign in Gaza in response to the Hamas-led attack on southern Israel on 7 October 2023, in which about 1,200 people were killed and 251 others were taken hostage.</p><p>At least 65,419 people have been killed in Israeli attacks in Gaza since then, according to the territory's Hama-run health ministry, including <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c75qr0gk0yqo\">more than 18,000 children</a>. </p><p>In August, the Integrated Food Security Phase Classification (IPC), a UN-backed body, said more than half a million people across Gaza were facing \"catastrophic\" conditions characterised by \"starvation, destitution and death\". Netanyahu has repeatedly denied starvation is taking place in Gaza.</p><p>A United Nations commission of inquiry found Israel <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c8641wv0n4go\">has committed genocide against Palestinians</a> in Gaza, in a report Israel's foreign ministry categorically rejected as \"distorted and false\".</p><p>Israel is under increasing pressure to end the war and occupation. </p><p>In addition to more countries recognising a Palestinian state, the European Commission <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cvgr4nj7405o\">has unveiled plans to restrict trade with Israel and impose sanctions</a> on extremist ministers in its government, which - if adopted - would be the EU's toughest response to the war in Gaza. </p><p>This week Microsoft cut off some services to a unit of Israel's Ministry of Defence after an investigation found <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cvgjx0zve2no\">its technology had been used to conduct mass surveillance</a> on people in Gaza.</p><p>But Netanyahu has called for Israel to embrace increased self-sufficiency. </p></div>"

It is clear from these notes that he was targeting ICE agents and ICE personnel.\"</p><p>The victims have not yet been identified. </p><p>But Mexico's foreign ministry has said one injured detainee is a Mexican national. </p><p>Officials had previously said that no law enforcement officers were injured or killed during the incident.</p><p>FBI director Kash Patel said in a post on social media earlier that evidence \"to this point indicates a high degree of pre-attack planning\".</p><p>Patel said one of the handwritten notes found said: \"Hopefully this will give ICE agents real terror, to think, 'is there a sniper with AP rounds on that roof?\"</p></div><div><p>At the news conference on Thursday, Larson said the shooter \"very likely acted alone\".</p><p>\"That morning gunshots sprayed the length of the building, the windows, and law enforcement vans that were in the sallyport area,\" she said, adding detainees were hit.</p><p>The notes were found at the shooter's residence, and included a \"gameplan of the attack\", she said. </p><p>The suspected shooter described ICE employees as \"people showing up to collect a dirty pay check\" according to Ms Larson. </p><p>She said the shooter had hoped his actions would \"terrorise ICE employees and interfere with their work\".</p><p>\"What he did is the very definition of terrorism,\" she added.</p><p>No evidence was found of membership of any specific group, and the shooter did not mention any specific government agency other than ICE, she said, but the man did express his hatred of the federal government.</p><p>She also praised ICE and other federal agents she said worked under fire to remove detainees from vans and get them to safety.</p><p>FBI special agent Joe Rothrock said it was a \"targeted, ambush-style attack on law enforcement\" that followed months of planning.</p><p>The shooter \"specifically intended to kill ICE agents\" and fired at transport vehicles carrying ICE personnel, federal and detainees, he said.</p><p>\"Jahn also acknowledged the potential for other casualties. He knew with a high likelihood ICE detainees would be transported that morning in the exact location where he was facing from his perch on a nearby rooftop,\" he said.</p><p>\"The clearest motivations at this point are the harm he wanted to cause to ICE. We're not aware of any specific relationships he had with anybody in detention,\" Mr Rothrock said, but noted the investigation was ongoing.</p><p>Jahn's hand-written notes indicate \"he did not expect to survive this event\", the agent said. </p><p>Marcos Charles,  ICE field office director of enforcement and removal operations, said \"violent rhetoric\" against ICE has to stop.</p><p>\"In contrast to those who would demonise our men and women, yesterday our brave officers ran back into danger,\" he said, alongside other federal agents, \"to save the detainees while shots were still being fired.\"</p><p>He said the shooter used apps designed to track ICE officers, and said those producing and distributing them are \"well aware of the dangers that they are exposing to law enforcement\".</p><p>Tensions have escalated at ICE facilities in recent months amid the Trump administration's efforts to significantly increase deportations as part of a wider crackdown on illegal immigration. </p></div>"

spaces.</p><p>Under its Pride in Place programme, the government has also said it will give communities help to save pubs and libraries from closure and encourage councils to block \"fake\" barbers, as well as \"unwanted\" betting and vape shops.</p><p>Sir Keir Starmer said it represented a \"huge investment\", and that those who \"know their communities best\" would decide how the money would be spent.</p><p>Conservative shadow communities secretary Sir James Cleverly said the money would be \"dwarfed\" by tax rises. </p></div><p>The announcement is part of Labour's attempt to tackle the electoral threat posed to them by the rising popularity of Reform UK, which some in government believe is partly driven by a loss of pride in local areas. </p><div><p>The investment will see 169 areas get £2m every year for a decade, while a further 95 places will get a one-off payment of £1.5m.</p><p>The money will be targeted at improvements backed by the local community and could include projects to tackle littering and graffiti or building a new sports ground.</p><p>The government has said spending would only be approved if community groups, local organisations and social clubs have been involved in deciding how the money will be spent. </p><p>Unlike the levelling up funding scheme introduced under Boris Johnson's Conservative government, councils would not put in bids to get the money.</p><p>The locations were selected <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/pride-in-place-impact-fund-place-selection-methodology-note/pride-in-place-impact-fund-methodology-note\">based on a ranking of neighbourhoods</a> using the Index of Multiple Deprivation (IMD) and Community Needs Index.</p><p>The money includes spending <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c0563g12npgo\">announced earlier this year,</a> which saw £1.5bn pledged to 75 of the \"most deprived\" areas in the UK.</p><p>The government said that since the announcement, areas had been discussing how to spend the money.</p><p>It said that in Peterhead people were \"ramping up CCTV to tackle anti-social behaviour\", in Blyth residents were putting on a cultural festival and investing in vacant properties and in Torbay there were discussions about funding an Agatha Christie heritage trail. </p></div><div><p>In addition to the money, councils in England and Wales will be encouraged to use powers to buy up \"assets and eyesores\" such as boarded-up shops and derelict abandoned businesses, allowing them to be used for projects such as local start-ups.</p><p>Disused department stores or empty office blocks could be repurposed into new health centres or housing, the government has suggested. </p><p>Communities already have a \"right to buy\", making it simpler for them to acquire local assets such as village shops, pubs or children's centres.</p><p>Under its devolution bill, currently going through Parliament, the government is doubling the amount of time local groups have to raise the money to make a purchase from six months to 12.</p><p>It also wants to include sports grounds in the list of assets covered by the new community \"right to buy\". </p><p>As part of the Pride in Place programme, the government says it wants to encourage councils to block \"unwanted\" new betting and vaping shops, along with \"fake\" barbers.</p><p>The National Crime Agency has recently <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c3677xzk56no\">launched a crackdown</a> on barber shops which it suspects of being fronts for international crime gangs.</p><p>The agency says it has growing intelligence that gangs use barber shops for money laundering by falsely presenting the proceeds of criminal operations as if they were earnings from legitimate businesses.</p><p>A government source told the BBC: \"At the moment, the Tobacco and Vapes Bill already allows vape stores to be blocked. </p><p>\"We want to potentially extend that to betting shops and fake barbers on high streets and we are looking for a legislative vehicle to do that as soon as possible.\"</p></div><div><p>Cathy Parker is a professor of place management at Manchester Metropolitan University, and was the research lead on the high streets taskforce launched in 2019.</p><p>She told the BBC's World At One that the \"horse had bolted\" in terms of high streets trying to compete with out-of-town retail park.</p><p>Town centres have to \"invent themselves into things that matter to people, that they can't get online and they can't get out of town\", she added.</p><p>She said the government's plan had \"real potential\" but the new funding and powers needed to be accompanied with \"training and support\" for local leadership.</p><p>\"I'm not talking about political leadership. Local authorities are responsible for eight town centres on average. You need leadership to come directly from the town.\"</p><p>Setting out the spending, Sir Keir said: \"For too long, people have watched their towns and streets decline – powerless to stop boarded-up shops and neglected parks. That ends now.</p><p>\"We're investing in the UK's future, by backing the true patriots that build our communities up in neighbourhoods across every corner of the country. Because it's people who bring pride, hope and life to our communities.\"</p><p>Conservative shadow communities secretary Sir James Cleverly said \"Labour have been forced into this announcement to try to distract from the immense damage they are doing to businesses and communities by hiking taxes.\"</p><p>A spokesperson for the Betting and Gaming Council (BGC) said betting shops \"are far more than just places to have a flutter: they are community hubs, economic drivers, and a vital part of the high street's future\".</p><p>Jamie Strachan, operations director at The Vaping Specialist, said: \"We are concerned by suggestions that specialist vape stores could be unfairly grouped alongside 'unwanted' businesses\" adding: \"Vape stores like ours play a vital role in public health.\"</p></div></article>"
