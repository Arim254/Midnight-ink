The best team this year versus the best team this month. The heirs apparent versus the emerging pretenders.</b></p><p>Add a record 82,000 crowd, some recent past – England's last world title came in 2014 against Canada – and two centuries of shared history and Saturday's Rugby World Cup final has the gravity of a small moon.</p><p>But, for some, there is another, even more important dimension.</p><p>For them, the game is not only a contest for silverware, pride and glory.</p><p>It is also about the vindication of an idea, with millions of pounds and the shape of women's Test rugby for years to come at stake.</p><p>It is a big claim for an already big match. This is the context.</p><p>England are the best-funded women's rugby team on Earth. They have 32 players on full-time contracts. Their highest earners in the squad are reportedly on nearly £50,000 a year, with bonuses for victories and titles on top, and cutting-edge analysis, preparation and coaching at England's high performance centre to help them achieve success.</p><p>They invariably find that success. Since full-time contracts were introduced in 2019, the Red Roses have won 73 of the 75 matches they have played.</p><p>England also has the best league in the world.</p><p>The nine-team PWR attracts talent from around the globe, creating a quality and quantity of rugby unrivalled in any other domestic competition and a production line of future Red Roses.</p><p>Canada have none of this.</p></div><div><p><strong>Women's Rugby World Cup final: England v Canada</strong></p><div><p>Saturday, 27 September at 16:00 BST</p><p>Allianz Stadium, Twickenham</p></div><p>Live on BBC One, BBC Radio 5 Live and the BBC Sport website and app</p></div><div><p>This week, Rugby Canada <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbc.ca/sports/rugby/women-rugby-world-cup-canada-surprise-final-cep-1.7641120\">chief executive Nathan Bombrys estimated<span>, external</span></a> that if his women's players \"did everything this calendar year\", they could expect to earn 12,000 Canadian dollars (£6,420) from the national body.</p><p>The Rugby Football Union committed a combined £28.7m to its national teams - men and women - in its most recent annual report. Rugby Canada's equivalent figure was less than a sixth of that at £4.5m.</p><p>Canada's domestic rugby scene is tiny compared to England's, limited to a university scene and disparate clubs across a vast nation.</p><p>Including kids, coaches and officials, there are only 41,202 registered participants in Canadian rugby - enough to fill only half of Allianz Stadium.</p><p>The team's World Cup preparation plans - nothing too fancy, mainly more time together in a centralised camp - were beyond the federation's finances.</p><p>Rugby Canada's C$2.6m (£1.4m) backing had to be supplemented by a million-dollar fundraising drive, titled Mission: Win Rugby World Cup, to cover the costs.</p><p>Donations have come in from community rugby clubs, former players, new supporters, and big backers. The Tragically Hip - long-standing alt-rock legends in Canada - raised C$30,000 (£16,000) through sales of a special T-shirt.</p><p>It is inspiring underdog stuff. But the funding gap still yawns wide.</p><p>On the pitch though, the difference is marginal.</p></div><div><p>No other team at the Rugby World Cup - Red Roses or otherwise - have touched the heights than Canada hit in their first-half bombardment of New Zealand in the semi-finals. Their 46-5 demolition of Australia in the last eight wasn't far behind either.</p><p>They are playing with flair and tempo, recycling ball at speed, and puncturing defences, either out wide with the pace of Asia Hogan-Rochester, Florence Symonds and the rest, or with smart darts around the fringes from Sophie de Goede, Justine Pelletier and Karen Paquin.</p><p>At the last Rugby World Cup, Canada were within four points of England in the last 10 minutes of their semi-final.</p><p>In their last meeting, at WXV in October, Canada <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.bbc.com/sport/rugby-union/articles/ce3zel504n3o\">led by five going into the last 15 minutes.</a></p><p>On neither occasion could they steer a promising performance home to victory. But they are better prepared than ever to do so on Saturday.</p></div><div><figure><p><span><picture><source srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/240/cpsprodpb/36f7/live/278ec2e0-9a1a-11f0-97f5-bd38218a3641.jpg.webp 240w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/320/cpsprodpb/36f7/live/278ec2e0-9a1a-11f0-97f5-bd38218a3641.jpg.webp 320w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/480/cpsprodpb/36f7/live/278ec2e0-9a1a-11f0-97f5-bd38218a3641.jpg.webp 480w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/624/cpsprodpb/36f7/live/278ec2e0-9a1a-11f0-97f5-bd38218a3641.jpg.webp 624w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/800/cpsprodpb/36f7/live/278ec2e0-9a1a-11f0-97f5-bd38218a3641.jpg.webp 800w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/976/cpsprodpb/36f7/live/278ec2e0-9a1a-11f0-97f5-bd38218a3641.jpg.webp 976w\" type=\"image/webp\"></source><img alt=\"Alex Tessier and Zoe Aldcroft, Canada and England's captains, in a composite image\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/1600/cpsprodpb/36f7/live/278ec2e0-9a1a-11f0-97f5-bd38218a3641.jpg\" srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/240/cpsprodpb/36f7/live/278ec2e0-9a1a-11f0-97f5-bd38218a3641.jpg 240w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/320/cpsprodpb/36f7/live/278ec2e0-9a1a-11f0-97f5-bd38218a3641.jpg 320w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/480/cpsprodpb/36f7/live/278ec2e0-9a1a-11f0-97f5-bd38218a3641.jpg 480w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/624/cpsprodpb/36f7/live/278ec2e0-9a1a-11f0-97f5-bd38218a3641.jpg 624w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/800/cpsprodpb/36f7/live/278ec2e0-9a1a-11f0-97f5-bd38218a3641.jpg 800w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/976/cpsprodpb/36f7/live/278ec2e0-9a1a-11f0-97f5-bd38218a3641.jpg 976w\" /></picture></span><span><span>Image source, </span>Getty Images</span></p><figcaption><span>Image caption, </span><p>Canada's Alex Tessier or England's Zoe Aldcroft will lift the Women's Rugby World Cup trophy on Saturday</p></figcaption></figure></div><div><p>England may have a landslide of money behind them, but Canada have cut their cloth with care and cunning.</p><p>Eighteen of their 32-strong squad, including world player of the year nominee De Goede and captain Alex Tessier, play for PWR clubs, getting them crucial high-quality game time.</p><p>There is a cluster of eight players together at Saracens, another six at Exeter, while Ealing Trailfinders, Gloucester-Hartpury and Leicester are also represented.</p><p>Canada have also hired Alex Austerberry, Saracens' director of women's rugby, as an assistant coach to pull together the knowledge the players have gained at club level and then add his own.</p><p>As part of their extended preparations, Canada played four warm-up matches, twice the number England played. Two of them came away to fast-improving South Africa, as part of a mutually beneficial arrangement struck between the two unions.</p><p>After <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.bbc.com/sport/rugby-union/61174978\">New Zealand invested heavily and late </a>in the last cycle to turn around a faltering Black Ferns side and lift the trophy, is there a template emerging?</p><p>If Canada win, how many cash-strapped unions will invest in full-time women's professionalism, instead pointing to a record that suggests nimble, clever, targeted preparation, along with piggy-backing on England's investment, can deliver similar results on a fraction of the budget?</p><p>England have dominated between Rugby World Cups. But if they fail to win the big one, will it be a big loss for women players everywhere?</p></div><div><p>To take those lessons from a Canada win, however, would be to ignore what their own players and coach are saying. And what the numbers show.</p><p>Canada have dug deep for their women's team. It is just their pockets are comparatively shallow.</p><p>Rugby Canada funds its men's and women's teams equally - something few, if any, other unions around the world can say.</p><p>Head coach Kevin Rouet explained the rest of their philosophy, with a caveat.</p><p>\"We try to be that creative because when you don't have money you have to be creative in the way you prepare,\" he said.</p><p>\"I think it allows us to do a lot of stuff that we wouldn't be able to do if we had too much money.</p><p>\"I know it's crazy to say that, but sometimes it allows us to be to find the best of everything and try to just be efficient with everything.</p><p>\"But I want more money, if that wasn't clear!\"</p><p>Pamphinette Buisa, who was selected in Rouet's squad but withdrew after suffering an injury in their final warm-up match against Ireland, says similar.</p><p>\"We want the support, we want the resources,\" <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.instagram.com/reel/DO523J8jjfL/\">she said in a social media post.<span>, external</span></a></p><p>\"A win wouldn't prove that professionalism doesn't matter. It would prove how much this team gives without the systems it deserves.\"</p><p>Canada have a good chance on Saturday. With more money, and the subsequent increased depth, cohesion and conditioning, they would have a great chance.</p><p>If Australia, New Zealand, South Africa, United States, France or Ireland want to be England's primary rival in a growing game, stalling on cycle-wide spending is only going to make that goal less likely.</p><p>And to reduce England's return on investment to the number of shiny pots in the cabinet also seems short-sighted.</p><p>A Rugby World Cup victory would be huge, super-charging the growth of the sport.</p><p>But the success or failure of a policy can't be entirely decided by a match that may turn on the bounce of a ball or, as in the last Rugby World Cup final, a first-half clash of heads.</p><p>England's money has delivered a dominant, excellent team, that draws crowds, sponsors, spectators, players and attention to the game like no other.</p><p>The Red Roses will go into the next World Cup in Australia in 2029 as one of, if not the, favourites.</p><p>While the Rugby Football Union has invested financially, England have thousands of fans invested emotionally.</p><p>That investment doesn't glitter like a World Cup, but it is just as rare a commodity. And just as valuable.</p></div><div><figure><figcaption><span>Media caption, </span><p>'We're loving it!'

    "body": "<div><p>Holocaust survivor Ruth Posner and her husband Michael, both aged in their 90s, have died at a suicide clinic in Switzerland.</p><p>The Polish-born actress, 96, who escaped a Nazi ghetto as a child and forged a successful career in dance and drama, is thought to have died last weekend at the Pegasos clinic near Basel. </p><p>She and 97-year-old Michael sent an email to family and friends on Tuesday informing them of their decision to die, according to playwright Sonja Linden who told BBC News she had received it.</p><p>In the note, first reported by The Times, the couple said they were \"sorry not to have mentioned it, but when you receive this email we will have shuffled off this mortal coil\".</p></div><div><p>\"The decision was mutual and without any outside pressure. We had lived a long life and together for almost 75 years. There came a point when failing senses, of sight and hearing and lack of energy was not living but existing that no care would improve,\" they wrote. </p><p>\"We had an interesting and varied life and except for the sorrow of losing Jeremy, our son. We enjoyed our time together, we tried not to regret the past, live in the present and not to expect too much from the future. Much love Ruth & Mike\".</p><p>Ms Linden, a close friend of Mrs Posner, paid tribute to her as \"the most vibrant, amazing woman\" and Mr Posner as a \"remarkable, clever, intellectual man\".</p><p>Speaking to the PA news agency, she said of Mrs Posner: \"She felt increasingly, every time I visited her over the last year, she said 'we've had enough, we're ready to go, we don't want to just exist. And that's what we're doing, we're just existing at the moment'.\"</p><p>Much of Mrs Posner's family were murdered in the Holocaust, including her parents, uncles, aunts and cousins - only she and one of her aunts survived.</p><p>The family were sent to the Radom Ghetto after the Nazis invaded Poland - but with the help of her father, Mrs Posner managed to escape onto the non-Jewish side, later hiding with a Catholic family. While living under a false identity, she was imprisoned as a Polish Catholic after the Warsaw Uprising of 1944.</p><p>She then managed to hide on a local farm near Essen until the end of World War Two, allowing her to flee to the UK aged 16.</p><p>She went on to become a member of the London Contemporary Dance Theatre and joined the Royal Shakespeare Company.</p><p>Mr Posner, a chemist, worked for United Nations aid agency Unicef and after travelling the world, the couple settled in London. They lived in Belsize Park at the time of their deaths. </p><p>Ms Linden told PA that while she was \"very sad\" at the couple's deaths, she \"completely endorses\" their decision and understands why they took it. </p><p>She said Mrs Posner had been in favour of legalising assisted dying in England: \"She wouldn't have had to make those arrangements, had to travel, she could've said goodbye more publicly.\"</p><p>Parliament is currently considering whether to change the law to allow assisted dying in England and Wales, which would apply to certain terminally ill patients reasonably expected to die within six months. Reports suggest neither of the Posners were terminally ill.</p><p>The Holocaust Memorial Trust paid tribute to Mrs Posner, describing her as \"an extraordinary woman\". </p><p>\"Although then in her 80s, she made it her mission to speak to as many young people as possible about her experiences during the Holocaust. She hoped that the leaders of tomorrow would learn the lessons of the past,\" its chief executive Karen Pollock said in a statement.</p><p>\"Ruth was one of a kind. Full of charisma and warmth, she left an impression on everyone she met. We will miss her.\"</p><p>The Campaign Against Antisemitism said she was influential in \"educating future generations and never shying away from taking part in the fight against antisemitism\".</p></div>"

We have to win this battle.\"</p><p>Expect more in the coming days at the Labour Party Conference in Liverpool, including in the prime minister's speech on Tuesday.</p></div><div><p>He heads to the north west of England after a day in the company of fellow left-wing leaders at a conference in London.</p><p>I was standing at the back of Methodist Central Hall in Westminster listening to a quartet of prime ministers. Sir Keir was joined by his opposite numbers from Canada, Australia and Iceland.</p><p>And here's the thing: while they are all winners, they had the demeanour of those with pensive worry.</p><p>The rise of Reform here in the UK is far from unique.</p><p>There was a confessional vibe at times to the conversation, borne of a fear the left can exude a piety and loftiness off-putting to many.</p><p>Sir Keir's take on this was that Labour took far too long to recognise the deep-seated concerns from many about illegal immigration.</p><p>It was an observation some within Labour are weary of hearing about again, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/election-2015-32114331\">recalling the fuss a decade ago</a> when Labour had mugs printed with the promise of \"controls on immigration\".</p><p>Others say Labour cannot highlight its instinct to be tough too much, given the instinct of many, fairly or otherwise, is to assume they might be the opposite.</p></div><div><p>Amid the noise of this debate <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cn832y43ql5o\">comes the plan for digital ID</a>.</p><p>After two decades of rapid digitalisation, from the smartphone's invention to its near ubiquity, the prime minister reckons the centre of gravity around the whole issue of state-mandated ID - and our collective willingness to embrace it - has shifted.</p><p>Twenty years ago, Tony Blair was making the case for ID cards. The \"card\" bit of the idea feels rather vintage, but the ID bit is back as an idea.</p><p>It is an idea still lacking in key detail, but one Sir Keir wants to enthusiastically embrace.</p><p>He told me a few weeks ago, as he began to publicly toy with it, that plenty of us are now much more used to handing bits of personal data to all sorts of institutions and companies we deal with online.</p><p>So, the logic goes, plenty will be comfortable doing the same thing with the government.</p><p>Let's see.</p></div><div><p>What is undoubtedly the case is that there is, again, noisy opposition to the idea.</p><p>A petition on Parliament's website has reached well over a million signatures. Only a handful have cleared that threshold in the last decade.</p><p>The prime minister will hope a quieter majority are won over by the idea – and he already has his political dividing line with Reform. And with the Conservatives, Liberal Democrats and Scottish National Party, as it happens.</p><p>His challenge, against the toughest of backdrops - economic, political and international - is to prove he can deliver incremental, or better, improvements for voters, and convince enough that the embrace of Reform would be a big mistake.</p><p>Sir Keir is now unflinching and explicit, talking of what he calls the \"open fight\" he wants with Reform - a \"battle for the soul of this country\".</p><p>On that characterisation of the tussle ahead, at least, Reform agree that is precisely what it amounts to.</p></div></article>"

Musk has previously been quoted as saying that Epstein had invited him to the island but he had declined.</p><p>The partial records are from the third batch of documents produced by the Jeffrey Epstein Estate. Democrats on the House Oversight Committee say they include phone message logs, copies of flight logs and manifests for aircrafts, copies of financial ledgers and Epstein's daily schedule.</p><p>In addition to Musk and Prince Andrew, the files released publicly also contain the names of other prominent figures including internet entrepreneur Peter Thiel and Steve Bannon, a former advisor to Donald Trump</p><p>One line in the records dated 6 December 2014 reads: \"Reminder: Elon Musk to island Dec. 6 (is this still happening?)\"</p><p>A flight manifest records that Prince Andrew was on a flight with Epstein and his associate Ghislaine Maxwell from Teterboro, New Jersey, to West Palm Beach, Florida, on 12 May 2000. Maxwell was convicted in 2021 of conspiring with Epstein to traffic girls for sex.</p><p>One heavily redacted ledger records two references of payments for massages for an 'Andrew' in February and May 2000. While Palace records, photographs and press reports from the time indicate Prince Andrew had travelled to the US around the time of the dates recorded in the newly released document, it is not clear who the 'Andrew' referred to in the ledger is.</p><p>On 11 May 2000, Buckingham Palace said on its website that Prince Andrew had flown to New York to attend a reception in New York for the National Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children. Andrew returned to the UK on 15 May, a later entry said.</p></div><div><p>In the files, there is also an entry referring to a planned lunch with Peter Thiel in November 2017. </p><p>There is also an entry referring to a planned breakfast with Steve Bannon 17 February 2019.</p><p>The files also mention tentative plans for a breakfast party with Microsoft founder Bill Gates in December 2014. In 2022 Gates told the BBC that meeting Jeffrey Epstein had been a \"mistake\".</p><p>It is not suggested that those mentioned in the files were aware of the alleged criminal activity for which Epstein was later arrested.</p><p>Epstein died by suicide in a New York jail cell in August 2019 while awaiting trial on sex trafficking charges.</p><p>In 2008, he reached a plea deal with prosecutors after the parents of a 14-year-old girl told police in Florida that Epstein had molested their daughter at his Palm Beach home. </p><p>He was arrested again in July 2019 on sex trafficking charges.</p><p>Sara Guerrero, a spokesperson for the Democrats on the committee, urged Attorney General Pam Bondi to release more files related to Epstein.</p><p>\"It should be clear to every American that Jeffrey Epstein was friends with some of the most powerful and wealthiest men in the world.

We also want the OBR to score that.\" </p><p>The OBR will send its first economic forecast to the treasury on Friday, which will include the gap the chancellor will need to make up in her 26 November Budget. </p><p>Much is depending on the OBR's expected downgrade to the underlying long-term performance of the economy, or productivity. The gap could be £20 or £30 billion per year.</p><p>In response, the chancellor has stressed a series of measures aimed to help the economy grow faster, including further trade deals.</p><p>If accepted by the independent forecasters, the inclusion of the proposed EU youth mobility scheme into its calculations could theoretically limit the extent of any new tax rises. </p><p>The OBR has scored policy moves on house building and childcare as helpful to the economy in recent years.</p><p>Speculation has been rife that the chancellor will be forced to raise taxes or cut spending in order to fill the fiscal hole, despite Labour's election promise not to increase income tax, National Insurance or VAT for working people.</p></div>"

Cathy is somebody who just pushes to see how far she can go.</p><p>\"So it needed somebody like Margot, who's a star, not just an incredible actress – which she is – but somebody who has a power, an otherworldly power, a Godlike power, that means people lose their minds.\"</p><p>Despite taking some liberties, Fennell said she had retained much of Brontë's original dialogue.</p><p>\"I was really determined to preserve as much of her dialogue [as possible] because her dialogue is the best dialogue ever,\" she said. \"I couldn't better it, and who could?\"</p><p>Fennell's Wuthering Heights will be released in cinemas on 14 February - Valentine's Day - next year.</p></div></article>"

Scheme.</p><p>The National Association of Head Teachers (NAHT) said there was a litany of problems with the scheme, which has two million members, including payment delays that have left many in financial disarray.</p><p>The union told BBC Radio 4's Money Box it was \"shocked\" at the number of members contacting it for help.</p><p>The DfE said it understood the problems had caused frustration and it was continuing to work closely with the scheme to resolve the issues as soon as possible.</p></div><p></p><h2>'Deeply dissatisfied'</h2><p></p><div><p>With members across England and Wales, the Teachers' Pension Scheme is one of the largest retirement schemes in the UK.</p><p>Although day-to-day operations are outsourced to Capita, the DfE has overall responsibility for the scheme.</p><p>But in a letter seen by Money Box the NAHT said it had \"serious concerns\" about how it was being run, including significant delays for members being paid their pensions.</p><p>The letter also cited excessive waiting times for members trying to get through on the phone, poor communication from pension scheme staff, and unanswered and unresolved queries and complaints.</p><p>Describing its members as \"deeply dissatisfied\", the union's assistant general secretary James Bowen said it was clear the Teachers' Pension Scheme was failing teachers and school leaders.</p><p>\"It's just frankly not good enough,\" he said, adding that the department and the pension scheme needed to \"get to grips\" with the problems and accelerate resolving some of the queries.</p><p>\"I think we need to see some strong leadership within the Department for Education and within the Teachers' Pension Scheme,\" he said.</p><p>\"Probably the only other solution is to put some more capacity into that team so it can cope with the demand that appears, at the moment, to be overwhelming them.\"</p></div><figure><div><p><img
