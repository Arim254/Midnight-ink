Built for a housing association, it was known to taxi drivers as the sardine can, and both architects and their families took flats there.</p><p>But while Grimshaw remained true to the hi-tech minimalist creed, Farrell increasingly felt pulled in a different direction. In 1980 they parted and Farrell established his own practice.</p><p>His breakthrough came in 1982 with <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.royalacademy.org.uk/article/architecture-why-tvam-was-most-maverick\">the headquarters for TV-am</a> in a repurposed canalside warehouse in north London's Camden.</p><p>It was colourful and over-the-top, full of witty references to the architecture of the past, like a pastiche of a Japanese temple, a Mesopotamian ziggurat (temple tower) and a massive cartoon cutout keystone, suspended in a skeletal arch of brightly coloured tubular steel over the entrance.</p><p>But what caught the popular imagination were the giant breakfast eggcups on the roof overlooking the canal.</p><p>Sir Terry later described the project as a \"tremendous release\", and the Royal Academy called it a \"pop building, through its sheer abundance of metaphor\".</p></div><p></p><h2>Decorative touches</h2><p></p><div><p>But arguably his most famous building was the MI6 headquarters next to Vauxhall Bridge in London, which has featured in several James Bond films.</p><p>Completed in 1994, Farrell later claimed that when the building was being designed he was told only that it was for a government client.</p><p>He guessed (wrongly) that it might be for the Department of the Environment, which is why this towering edifice of mirrored green glass and Italian marble, part-1930s Art Deco factory, part-Aztec temple, has conical fir trees half way up the facade.</p><p>He gained a reputation for making big buildings fun, adding Lego-like decorative touches to developments like the Edinburgh International Conference Centre and Embankment Place above Charing Cross Station in London.</p><p>\"The modernism that was around before the 1980s was very grey, restrictive, utilitarian and quite doctrinaire really,\" Farrell said. </p><p>\"For me personally the split from Grimshaw was an opportunity to completely start again. I saw it as a great release to establish a new identity any way I saw fit.\"</p></div><figure><div><p><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20250919-090805-05e5ba0164-web-2.30.1-2/grey-placeholder.png\" /><img srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/defd/live/4e037a20-3912-11ef-bdc5-41d7421c2adf.jpg.webp 240w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/defd/live/4e037a20-3912-11ef-bdc5-41d7421c2adf.jpg.webp 320w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/defd/live/4e037a20-3912-11ef-bdc5-41d7421c2adf.jpg.webp 480w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/defd/live/4e037a20-3912-11ef-bdc5-41d7421c2adf.jpg.webp 640w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/defd/live/4e037a20-3912-11ef-bdc5-41d7421c2adf.jpg.webp 800w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/defd/live/4e037a20-3912-11ef-bdc5-41d7421c2adf.jpg.webp 1024w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/defd/live/4e037a20-3912-11ef-bdc5-41d7421c2adf.jpg.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/defd/live/4e037a20-3912-11ef-bdc5-41d7421c2adf.jpg.webp\" alt=\"Hull's aquarium, The Deep\" /></p></div><p></p><figcaption>Hull's striking aquarium was designed to resemble the prow of a ship</figcaption><p></p></figure><div><p>He was also keen on innovation and environmental awareness, including <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-65346052\">the £4.6m Farrell Centre, which opened in Newcastle in 2023</a>. </p><p>It held an exhibition showing how we might soon be able to grow buildings from fungus, and other innovative ways to reduce cities' environmental impact.</p><p>Partly funded by Sir Terry, the exhibition showed four architecture studios offering visions for making buildings more sustainable.</p><p>They included a structure grown from mycelium, the root network of fungus.</p><p>Outside London, Sir Terry also built Hull's striking aquarium, The Deep, jutting out over the Humber like a strangely angular boat; and the eclectic collection of buildings known as The Centre for Life in Newcastle.</p><p>He also developed a substantial practice overseas, especially in China, where he designed buildings that managed to be both gargantuan and frisky.</p><p>One of the earliest was the Peak Tower in Hong Kong in 1997, an upturned crescent perched atop four concrete legs (since glassed in to provide additional space).

This could lead to a \"work to rule\" situation, similar to what was introduced in a previous dispute during which GPs limited patient appointments to the minimum required under their contract.</p></div><p></p><h2>'NHS should not be held back'</h2><p></p><div><p>But ministers argue that the BMA had agreed to the introduction of online booking as part of a new negotiated contract in England. They point out that many GPs already offer the service.</p><p>Wes Streeting, Secretary of State for Health and Social Care, said it was \"absurd\" that in 2025 many patients can't request appointments online. </p><p>\"If you can book a hair appointment online, you should be able to book an NHS appointment too. We have agreed clear safeguards, where patients will be directed to phone up or attend in person for urgent appointments. The BMA knows this. This government will always put the interests of patients first, and we will not stand for our NHS being held back in the analogue age.\"</p><p>Dr Katie Bramall-Stainer, chair of the BMA GP committee, said the changes were agreed to \"on the condition that 'necessary safeguards' would be put in place\" before Wednesday 1 October. </p><p>\"This was agreed – in writing – with government… and NHSE in February this year. Now almost eight months later, it is deeply disappointing to see promises broken,\" she added.</p><p>She said ministers had been warned that the changes would lead to \"hospital-style waiting lists in general practice\" which could \"reduce face-to-face GP appointments\".</p><p>Mr Streeting said that that 2,000 extra GPs had already been hired across England and that patient satisfaction with their GPs was on the up. </p><p>Officials said that surgeries which had implemented the changes had reported reduced waiting times for appointments.</p></div></article>"

like maintenance loans, which students in England can still receive - the amount will be means-tested, meaning it depends how much a student's family earns.</p><p>It comes as a <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cly68e6r621o\">growing number of students</a> are having to take on part-time work to fund their time at university, as the gap continues to increase between the rising cost of living and the money available from maintenance loans.</p><p>Recent research from the Higher Education Policy Institute (Hepi) suggests students in England need £61,000 over a three-year degree \"to have a minimum socially acceptable standard of living\".</p><p>The think tank found the maximum annual maintenance loan covers \"just half the costs faced by freshers\".</p><p>And a recent <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.savethestudent.org/money/surveys/student-money-survey-2025-results.html\">Save the Student survey</a> suggested that, on average, maintenance loans have been falling £502-a-month short of living costs.</p><p>Tom Allingham, student money expert at Save the Student, welcomed the announcement, but said the government should \"think bigger\" by making all students eligible, rather than just those on \"priority courses\".</p><p>\"Simply replacing a chunk of the loan with a grant will make no difference to the intense financial struggles students face, and the number one thing they need right now is more money in their pockets,\" he said.</p><p>\"We eagerly await more details on the new funding, and hope the government will listen to the needs of students when fine-tuning their plans.\"</p><p>Alex Stanley, from the National Union of Students, said the reintroduction of grants \"has to be the beginning of wholesale change in our broken education system\".</p><p>Although they \"do not welcome the introduction of a levy on international students\", he said they were \"ecstatic that maintenance grant funding is back on the table\".</p><p>Hepi's Nick Hillman similarly said the return of grants was \"long overdue\", but that the tax on international student fees was \"not the right way to do it\".</p><p>\"We should not be charging international students, who often come from countries much poorer than the UK, to cover the living costs of our own home students,\" he said.</p><p>When it comes to maintenance loans, the maximum yearly amount students from England can receive if they are living away from their parents, outside of London, is £10,544.</p><p>Students from Wales studying away from home can borrow up to £11,345, and some Welsh students are already entitled to maintenance grants.</p><p>In Scotland, the maximum annual maintenance loan is £9,400 for under-25s, and there is a number of bursaries and grants students there can apply for too.</p></div>"

Its football titles, now known as EA FC, have sold 325 million copies since the first release in 1993.</p><p>The Sims has sold more than 200 million copies, and Need For Speed more than 150 million.</p><p>But it has also been the publisher of many other popular titles - often being the partner of choice for games in the Harry Potter and James Bond series in the past.</p><p>The purchase will be a big gaming feather in the cap of Saudi Arabia, which has been increasing its presence in the industry in recent years.</p><p>In March 2025, the nation's investment fund paid $3.5bn to purchase the gaming division of Niantic - giving it control of the hit mobile game Pokémon Go.</p><p>The purchase became part of Scopely Inc - makers of Monopoly Go - which itself was bought by PIF subsidiary Savvy Games Group for $4.9bn in 2023.</p><p>Saudi Arabia has made waves in the eSports industry, hosting major tournaments including the eSports World Cup, and it will also host 2027's planned Olympic esports Games.</p><p>The country already has stakes in other big gaming firms such as Nintendo and Take-Two Interactive, but the EA purchase marks a significant extension of its reach.</p><p>Its PIF has hundreds of billions in assets due to its oil wealth, and it is controlled by the country's prince Mohammed bin Salman, whose government has been accused of human rights violations.</p><p>A 2019 UN report stated \"the state of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia is responsible\" for the death of Jamal Khashoggi, a journalist who was critical of the country's government.</p><p>Saudi Arabia has always denied this.</p></div><figure><div><p><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20250919-090805-05e5ba0164-web-2.30.1-2/grey-placeholder.png\" /><img srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/41d3/live/348b21e0-26a8-11f0-8f57-b7237f6a66e6.png.webp 240w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/41d3/live/348b21e0-26a8-11f0-8f57-b7237f6a66e6.png.webp 320w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/41d3/live/348b21e0-26a8-11f0-8f57-b7237f6a66e6.png.webp 480w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/41d3/live/348b21e0-26a8-11f0-8f57-b7237f6a66e6.png.webp 640w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/41d3/live/348b21e0-26a8-11f0-8f57-b7237f6a66e6.png.webp 800w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/41d3/live/348b21e0-26a8-11f0-8f57-b7237f6a66e6.png.webp 1024w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/41d3/live/348b21e0-26a8-11f0-8f57-b7237f6a66e6.png.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/41d3/live/348b21e0-26a8-11f0-8f57-b7237f6a66e6.png.webp\" alt=\"A green promotional banner with black squares and rectangles forming pixels, moving in from the right.

The idea is as ludicrous as me checking with the boss I had when I was twenty-one for what opinions I should hold these days.\"</p><p>She said it had been, however, \"hard to shake a certain protectiveness\" after knowing someone since they were 10.</p><p>\"Until quite recently, I hadn't managed to throw off the memory of children who needed to be gently coaxed through their dialogue in a big scary film studio.\"</p><p>The author said the \"turning point\" in her feelings came in 2022 when Watson appeared to aim a subtle dig at Rowling on stage at the Bafta Awards.</p><p>Host Rebel Wilson introduced Watson by saying: \"She's proud to call herself a feminist, but we all know she's a witch.\" <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TD-vioiM2BU\">Watson responded</a> that she was \"here for ALL of the witches\", which was widely interpreted as a statement of support for the trans community.</p><p>Rowling said that moment had \"a postscript that hurt far more than the speech itself\", when Watson sent a note, despite having her phone number. The note had a single line saying, \"I'm so sorry for what you're going through\", Rowling said.</p><p>\"This was back when the death, rape and torture threats against me were at their peak, at a time when my personal security measures had had to be tightened considerably and I was constantly worried for my family's safety,\" the author said.</p><p>\"Emma had just publicly poured more petrol on the flames, yet thought a one line expression of concern from her would reassure me of her fundamental sympathy and kindness.\"</p></div><div><p>Rowling went on to suggest that Watson was \"never likely to need\" to use the types of single-sex spaces she has campaigned against trans people having access to, such as changing rooms and public toilets.</p><p>\"I wasn't a multimillionaire at fourteen. I lived in poverty while writing the book that made Emma famous,\" she added.</p><p>\"I therefore understand from my own life experience what the trashing of women's rights in which Emma has so enthusiastically participated means to women and girls without her privileges.\"</p><p>The writer added that Watson's recent declaratons of love marked a \"change of tack I suspect she's adopted because she's noticed full-throated condemnation of me is no longer quite as fashionable as it was\".</p><p>Rowling concluded: \"Adults can't expect to cosy up to an activist movement that regularly calls for a friend's assassination, then assert their right to the former friend's love, as though the friend was in fact their mother.</p><p>\"Emma is rightly free to disagree with me and indeed to discuss her feelings about me in public - but I have the same right, and I've finally decided to exercise it.\"</p><p>BBC News has approached Watson's representatives for comment.</p></div><p></p><h2>'I can love her, I can know she loved me'</h2><p></p><div><p>Watson was one of several stars of the Potter films who spoke out against Rowling's views in 2020, posting on social media at the time: \"Trans people are who they say they are and deserve to live their lives without being constantly questioned or told they aren't who they say they are.\"</p><p>In last week's interview, Watson said her previous relationship with Rowling meant she was still able to \"treasure Jo\".</p><p>The actress also praised Rowling for the \"kindness and words of encouragement\" she gave when she was growing up, and for the opportunity to play a character like Hermione.</p><p>\"There's just no world in which I could ever cancel her out, or cancel that out, for anything,\" Watson said. \"It has to remain true. It is true.</p><p>\"I just don't know what else to do other than hold these two seemingly incompatible things together at the same time and just hope maybe they will one day resolve or co-join themselves, and maybe accept that they never will, but that they can both still be true.\"</p></div></article>"
