I support Palestine Action'.\"</p><p>It is calling for the proscription of Palestine Action as a terrorist group by the UK government to be scrapped. </p><p>Keith Hackett, 71, said he was risking arrest because he was \"deeply ashamed\" of Labour's actions.</p><p>\"If they want to start turning the party around and win back the support they have lost, they need to stop their complicity in this genocide and end the ban on Palestine Action.\"</p><p>Fellow protestor Tayo Aluko, 63, said: \"This is a time for bravery, as was shown by people who went before us, so that we can enjoy the freedoms we have today, which are now under threat.\"</p><p>A group of about two hundred protestors, waving the union jack and St George's flags and carrying placards opposing the government's digital ID plans, had to be separated from the pro-Palestinian demonstrators by police.</p></div><div><p>Former Home Secretary Yvette Cooper banned the group under terrorism laws after <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cx24nppdx0lo\">paint was daubed on jets at RAF Brize Norton</a>. Police said the act caused £7m of damage.</p><p>Earlier this month, the Home Office was <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/ckgejwx3grlo\">given permission to challenge a ruling </a>which allowed Palestine Action to appeal against its ban under terror legislation.</p><p>The group's co-founder, Huda Ammori, was granted permission to appeal in July after her lawyers argued the ban breached the right to free speech.</p><p>The judge refused an appeal to temporarily lift the ban and it remains proscribed before a full review at the High Court in November.</p><p>Cooper has previously defended the proscription by saying some supporters of Palestine Action \"don't know the full nature\" of the group.</p><p>Earlier this month, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c62qrmpd7l5o\">more than 425 people were arrested</a> at a demonstration against the ban in Parliament Square in central London. </p></div>"

Opinion polls had suggested up to 60% backed digital IDs, which also had the approval of the Swiss government, and both houses of parliament. </p><p>It was Switzerland's second vote on digital IDs. An earlier proposal was rejected in 2021, amid concerns the data would be held centrally, and controlled largely by private providers. </p></div><div><p>Sunday's revised proposal keeps the system in government hands.  Data will be stored only on the smartphones of individual users, and digital IDs will be optional. </p><p>Citizens can continue to use national identity card if they choose, which has been standard for decades in Switzerland.</p><p>To further ease privacy concerns, a particular authority seeking information on a person – such as proof of age or nationality, for example – will only be able to check for those specific details.</p><p>It comes after the UK government announced plans earlier this week to introduce its own digital ID - which would be mandatory for employment - as part of efforts to curb the number of illegal migrants living and working in the country.</p><p>The proposed British digital ID would have fewer intended uses than the Swiss version, but has still raised concerns about privacy and data security. </p><p>Supporters of the Swiss system say it will make life much easier for everyone, allowing a range of bureaucratic procedures - from getting a telephone contract to proving you are old enough to buy a bottle of wine - to happen quickly online.</p><p>Opponents of digital ID cards, who gathered enough signatures to force another referendum on the issue, argue that the measure could still undermine individual privacy.</p><p>They also fear that, despite the new restrictions on how data is collected and stored, it could still be used to track people and for marketing purposes.</p><p>Switzerland has a long tradition of protecting its citizens' privacy. The banking secrecy laws, now much diluted, were designed to shield an individual's personal finances from the prying eyes of the state.</p><p>For years, Google Street View was controversial in Switzerland - and even today, following a ruling by the Swiss Federal Court, images taken close to schools, women's refuges, hospitals or prisons must be automatically blurred before going online.</p></div>"
