The BBC's source confirmed that reporting. </p></div><div><p>The reasoning for their split is unclear. </p><p>Kidman and Urban, who both grew up in Australia, have weathered ups and downs over their nearly two decades together. </p><p>They experienced highs with both stars winning and being nominated for top honours in their respective industries. Over the years, they have supported and cheered on one another, routinely appearing together at award shows and Hollywood premiers for the other. </p><p>And lows: months after their wedding, Urban checked himself into rehab for drug and alcohol addiction. Both he and Kidman have said his struggles with addiction made their bond stronger. </p><p>Kidman and several of his close friends staged an intervention that Urban said changed his life. </p><p>\"Everything was just designed, I believe, for that moment to fuse us together,\" he said in 2010 appearance on The Oprah Winfrey Show.</p><p>\"I look back now and realize Nic has taught me so much and brought so much into my life and opened my eyes in so many ways,\" he said. \"[This is] the best place I've ever been.\"</p><p>The pair were spotted together over the summer in June watching a FIFA Club World Cup match in Nashville, Tennessee. </p><p>They also appeared together in May when Urban was honoured at the Academy of Country Music Awards with the ACM Triple Crown Award. They were photographed in their seats appearing happily in love, kissing and holding hands. </p><p>The Babygirl actress was previously married to actor Tom Cruise. The pair were together for more than 10 years and also have two children together. They ended their marriage in 2001. </p></div>"

The case is now the focus of intense diplomatic activity, according to the paper.</p></div><figure><div><p><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20250919-090805-05e5ba0164-web-2.30.1-2/grey-placeholder.png\" /><img srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/822b/live/90dc9080-0e19-11ef-82e8-cd354766a224.png.webp 240w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/822b/live/90dc9080-0e19-11ef-82e8-cd354766a224.png.webp 320w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/822b/live/90dc9080-0e19-11ef-82e8-cd354766a224.png.webp 480w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/822b/live/90dc9080-0e19-11ef-82e8-cd354766a224.png.webp 640w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/822b/live/90dc9080-0e19-11ef-82e8-cd354766a224.png.webp 800w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/822b/live/90dc9080-0e19-11ef-82e8-cd354766a224.png.webp 1024w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/822b/live/90dc9080-0e19-11ef-82e8-cd354766a224.png.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/822b/live/90dc9080-0e19-11ef-82e8-cd354766a224.png.webp\" alt=\"News Daily banner\" /></p></div></figure><figure><div><p><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20250919-090805-05e5ba0164-web-2.30.1-2/grey-placeholder.png\" /><img srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/1e82/live/a6307d40-0e21-11ef-b9d8-4f52aebe147d.png.webp 240w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/1e82/live/a6307d40-0e21-11ef-b9d8-4f52aebe147d.png.webp 320w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/1e82/live/a6307d40-0e21-11ef-b9d8-4f52aebe147d.png.webp 480w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/1e82/live/a6307d40-0e21-11ef-b9d8-4f52aebe147d.png.webp 640w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/1e82/live/a6307d40-0e21-11ef-b9d8-4f52aebe147d.png.webp 800w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/1e82/live/a6307d40-0e21-11ef-b9d8-4f52aebe147d.png.webp 1024w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/1e82/live/a6307d40-0e21-11ef-b9d8-4f52aebe147d.png.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/1e82/live/a6307d40-0e21-11ef-b9d8-4f52aebe147d.png.webp\" alt=\"News Daily banner\" /></p></div></figure><div><p><span>Related Internet Links</span></p></div></article>"

A fight for the soul of our country, every bit as big as rebuilding Britain after the war, and we must all rise to this challenge,\" he will say, warning that the goal will not be achieved without a cost.</p><p>\"We need to be clear that our path, the path of renewal, it's long, it's difficult, it requires decisions that are not cost-free or easy,\" he is expected to say.</p><p>\"Decisions - that will not always be comfortable for our party. Yet at the end of this hard road there will be a new country, a fairer country, a land of dignity and respect.\"</p><p>He will also talk about rebuilding, in a nod to Labour Prime Minister Clement Attlee's postwar government's programme of new towns, which fixed the devastation wreaked by bombs as well as poverty.</p><p>The party promised at the weekend to start <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cly1geen679o\">building three new towns</a> in England before the end of the decade.</p><p>The prime minister will urge the country to \"unite around a common good\" aiming to improve living standards, grow the economy \"from the grassroots\" and put \"money in the pockets of working people\".</p><p>\"We can all see our country faces a choice, a defining choice,\" he will say.</p><p>\"Britain stands at a fork in the road. We can choose decency, or we can choose division. Renewal or decline.</p><p>\"A country - proud of its values, in control of its future or one that succumbs, against the grain of our history, to the politics of grievance.\"</p><p>Sir Keir is trying to build a foundation for his party to continue to back him through what could be deep and painful losses to Reform UK in May's Welsh, Scottish and English local elections.</p><p>He knows that plenty in his party, from the cabinet down, are privately pondering whether this could be his last Labour Party conference as prime minister.</p></div><div><p>Reform UK's <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cj6xdw1dg4zo\">Zia Yusuf earlier rejected suggestions that the party's deportation policy was racist</a>, saying: \"Labour's message to the country is clear: pay hundreds of billions for foreign nationals to live off the state forever, or Labour will call you racist.</p><p>\"Reform's plan will ensure only British people can access welfare and that migrants contribute to society.\"</p><p>Responding to the speech, Conservative Party chairman Kevin Hollinrake said: \"Keir Starmer calls this a fork in the road, but he's already driven Britain into a cul-de-sac of chaos.\"</p><p>\"Families are fighting to cope with higher bills, higher taxes on their jobs and higher mortgage rates whilst his doom loop Chancellor is secretly plotting to pile tax upon tax, debt upon debt, which will further grind the economy down and shatter the public's trust.\"</p><p>\"And while Britain pays the price, Labour descend into a race to the bottom in their own ranks, led by a weak, visionless Prime Minister,\" the Conservative Party chairman added.</p></div><p><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/newsletters/z7hc239\">Sign up for our Politics Essential newsletter</a> to read top political analysis, gain insight from across the UK and stay up to speed with the big moments.

    "body": "<div><div><p>6 hours ago</p></div><p><span><p><span>Anthony Zurcher</span><span>North America correspondent</span></p></span></p></div><div><p>The US is hurtling towards a government shutdown on Tuesday night, and there appears to be little appetite on either side of the partisan divide to avoid it.</p><p>A last-ditch meeting between President Donald Trump and Democratic leaders in Congress made little progress. If anything, both sides have been digging deeper into their positions.</p><p>\"I think we're headed to a shutdown because the Democrats won't do the right thing,\" Vice President JD Vance told reporters after the meeting at the White House. \"You don't put a gun to the American people's head and say, 'Unless you do exactly what Senate and House Democrats want you to do, we're going to shut down your government'.\"</p><p>Democratic Senate leader Chuck Schumer said there were still \"very large differences\" between his party and the White House.</p><p>No one sounded optimistic.</p><p>Republicans want a short-term extension of current spending levels – essentially kicking the legislative can a bit farther down the road. </p><p>They're happy with the way things are going, particularly since the Trump administration has been implementing spending cuts on its own, without the help of congressional budget-setters.</p><p>Democrats want that practice to end. </p><p>What's the point, they wonder, with negotiating spending-level agreements if Trump will just ignore them? </p><p>They also want a firm agreement to renew the government health-insurance subsidies for low-income individuals that expire at the end of the year – something Republicans have been reluctant to do so far.</p></div><div><ul><li><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/crrj1znp0pyo\">Why the US government might shut down and what to know</a></li></ul><p>Those are the negotiating positions of both sides, but government shutdown fights are about more than policy – they're about politics.</p><p>Republicans think they have the political high ground. </p><p>The party that makes demands in exchange for keeping the government open – in this case the Democrats – typically gets the lion's share of the blame when a shutdown happens.</p><p>Trump and Republican congressional leaders are already claiming that they are the reasonable ones. </p><p>They're the ones, they say, who simply want to buy more time to negotiate without the adverse consequences of a shutdown.</p><p>Of course, Democrats don't see it that way. </p><p>They believe healthcare is a winning issue for them, so they want the debate to be on whether millions of Americans will lose the ability to afford medical insurance. </p><p>Temporarily funding the government for seven weeks, in their view, just moves that subsidy deadline closer without any appreciable progress.</p><p>Complicating all this for Democrats is the reality that many Republicans seem at peace with an extended government closure.</p><p>White House budget chief Russ Vought recently circulated a memorandum explaining how the Trump administration would use a shutdown to make new, long-term reductions in federal spending and employment rolls.</p><p>Positions and government programmes deemed \"nonessential\" during the closure will be permanently shuttered – an expansion of the Department of Government Efficiency (Doge) cuts from earlier this year.</p><p>But Democratic leaders seem to believe the threats are a bluff or a negotiating tactic. </p><p>Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer called it \"an attempt at intimidation\".</p><p>\"Donald Trump has been firing federal workers since day one - not to govern, but to scare,\" Schumer said. \"This is nothing new and has nothing to do with funding the government.\"</p><p>Schumer and his fellow Democratic congressional leaders are also  under intense pressure from their political base to hold fast in the face of Republican attacks. </p><p>In March, Senate Democrats faced withering criticism from within their own party for reaching a six-month spending agreement with Republicans even as Trump was in the midst of his Doge budget-slashing campaign.</p><p>This time around, Democrats may feel compelled to trigger a shutdown to demonstrate their resolve.</p><p>In the end, however, a shutdown fight is a test of wills. It's a test of which side is best able to tolerate political pain.</p><p>Democrats may see a benefit to fighting Republicans, but will they be willing to stand aside as cherished federal programmes and government services – including those for low-income Americans – are shuttered?</p><p>Republicans may talk tough about slashing government, but as the incumbent party they could have the most to lose if the public mood dramatically sours.</p><p>The most recent government shutdown, during Trump's first term, lasted 35 days, setting a record as the longest in American history. </p><p>Although the fight was over spending on the president's proposed US-Mexico border wall, it ended because federal air traffic controllers – who were working without pay – began staying home, threatening massive disruption to US air travel.</p><p>Shutdowns can be unpredictable. And while both sides seem to be itching for a fight, there's no telling when, or how, this fight will end.</p></div>"

Indian airlines have placed orders for some 1,900 new aircraft, a thousand of which are expected to be delivered in the next five years, making such infrastructure critically important to accommodate this new fleet.</p><p>Adani says NMIA will be India's first fully digital airport that's been \"designed and developed specifically to become a hub airport\" with advanced technology for check-in, security, baggage and boarding drastically reducing turnaround times and facilitating easy transfers.</p><p>It has already announced a partnership with India's largest and newest carriers, Indigo and Akasa Airlines, who are launching new routes. And Air India has committed to flying to 15 cities from the airport, gradually scaling up operations, including flights to international destinations.</p><p>Given how starved Mumbai's current airport is for capacity, analysts expect strong uptake for NMIA's parking slots from airlines looking to launch new routes.</p><p>But major challenges are expected as operations commence in the coming months.</p></div><figure><div><p><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20250919-090805-05e5ba0164-web-2.30.1-2/grey-placeholder.png\" /><img srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/1f98/live/162766a0-9ae3-11f0-8ee5-3b441e09ef17.jpg.webp 240w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/1f98/live/162766a0-9ae3-11f0-8ee5-3b441e09ef17.jpg.webp 320w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/1f98/live/162766a0-9ae3-11f0-8ee5-3b441e09ef17.jpg.webp 480w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/1f98/live/162766a0-9ae3-11f0-8ee5-3b441e09ef17.jpg.webp 640w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/1f98/live/162766a0-9ae3-11f0-8ee5-3b441e09ef17.jpg.webp 800w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/1f98/live/162766a0-9ae3-11f0-8ee5-3b441e09ef17.jpg.webp 1024w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/1f98/live/162766a0-9ae3-11f0-8ee5-3b441e09ef17.jpg.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/1f98/live/162766a0-9ae3-11f0-8ee5-3b441e09ef17.jpg.webp\" alt=\"Adani Airport Holdings Limited The image shows the newly constructed runways at NMIA on an overcast, slightly cloudy day. \" /><span>Adani Airport Holdings Limited</span></p></div><p></p><figcaption>NMIA will operate two parallel runways </figcaption><p></p></figure><div><p>Given how far the airport is, its location could be a significant inconvenience to passengers - both when taking flights to and from NMIA, and especially when using it for connecting flights.</p><p>It can easily take between two and three hours to reach the airport from certain suburbs of Mumbai. </p><p>A direct 20-minute metro line between the old and the new airports is likely to become a reality only after a few years.

Our contact frisking at the airport takes significantly more time than other airports, which have transitioned to body scanners,\" Mr Awtaney adds.</p><p>Mr Bansal agrees that a lot of this will need to fall in place before Mumbai's aviation profile is raised to global standards. </p><p>A change in regulation, he says, will also need to be accompanied by airlines' willingness to expand their choice of long-haul destinations. Carriers will also have to optimise their fleet strategy and connections to be able to leverage the city's strategic location advantage between Europe, the US and Asia.</p><p>For now, NMIA solves the city's immediate problem - acute air traffic congestion.</p><p>It will also serve as a larger catchment area, which could extend all the way to the neighbouring Pune city, a major IT and education hub.</p><p>\"Some of the major cities around the globe, such as New York, London, Dubai, and Tokyo, all operate with two to three airports. Mumbai will join this select club,\" says Mr Awtaney.</p><p>And so will Delhi, where a third airport - Jewar - is all set to open in the coming months, to serve the capital's satellite areas.</p><p> <i>Follow BBC News India on </i><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.instagram.com/bbcnewsindia/\"><i>Instagram</i></a><i>, </i><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.youtube.com/@bbcnewsindia/featured\"><i>YouTube,</i></a><i> </i><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://x.com/BBCIndia\"><i>X</i></a><i> and </i><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.facebook.com/bbcindia/\"><i>Facebook</i></a><i>.</i></p></div></article>"

A multinational stabilisation force would deploy to support security and train local police. Israeli forces would withdraw in stages.</p><p>According to the text of the plan, \"Gaza will be governed under the temporary transitional governance of a technocratic, apolitical Palestinian committee, responsible for delivering the day-to-day running of public services and municipalities for the people in Gaza. </p><p>\"This committee will be made up of qualified Palestinians and international experts, with oversight and supervision by a new international transitional body, the 'Board of Peace,' which will be headed and chaired by President Donald J.
