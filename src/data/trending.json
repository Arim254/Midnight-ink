consider any proposals from its council members.</p><p>The Fifa council would make the ultimate decision, but there are no signs it is something expected to be made imminently.</p><p>How dramatic would this expansion actually be?</p><p>Fairly seismic is the obvious answer.</p><p>The pace of change has been remarkable, since the long-standing 16-team format increased to 24 teams in 1982.</p><p>It became a 32-team event in 1998 before being expanded to 48 teams for next summer's showpiece.</p><p>Adding another 16 teams for 2030 would mean the World Cup had doubled in size in eight years and would mean more than 30% of Fifa's current 211 members would participate.</p></div><div><h2>Get in touch</h2><div><p>Send us your questions</p></div></div><p></p><h2

disagrees</p></figcaption></figure></div><div><p>Fifa president Gianni Infantino said \"every idea is a good idea\", but the proposal for a 64-team tournament has divided opinion among the six Fifa confederations and national associations.</p><p>Conmebol president Alejandro Dominguez said expanding the World Cup for its centenary would ensure \"nobody on the planet is left out of the party\".</p><p>Uefa president Aleksander Ceferin is among those to have dismissed the proposals, with the Slovenian saying it is a \"bad idea\" for both the tournament itself and the qualifying process.</p><p>Victor Montagliani, president of the governing body for football in North and Central America and the Caribbean (Concacaf), said the suggestion \"doesn't feel right\" and believes the expansion would damage <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/articles/cj68ydgeweko\">\"the broader football ecosystem\".</a></p><p>Asian Football Confederation (AFC) president Sheikh Salman bin Ibrahim Al Khalifa agreed, saying further expansion would bring \"chaos\".</p><p>While there has been limited further public discussion, there are a few obvious reasons why people would be in favour and against the proposal.</p><p>Financially, more games would surely mean bigger TV deals and sponsorship possibilities.</p><p>The expanded 2026 format is already predicted to be generating more money than any previous World Cup through sponsorships, merchandising, ticket sales and broadcast revenues, with Fifa expecting to earn $11bn (£8.2bn) over the four-year cycle to December 2026.</p><p>By flinging its doors open wider than ever before, the tournament would be more inclusive and the change would probably result in a host of nations reaching the World Cup for the first time.</p><p>At the 2022 World Cup, hosts Qatar were the only team making their tournament debut.</p><p>Cape Verde are only one win away from joining already-qualified Jordan and Uzbekistan as debutants at the 2026 competition, while New Caledonia and Suriname could add to the growing number of debutants already in next summer's World Cup.</p><p>A 64-team tournament would also increase the likelihood of all the world's top players competing.</p><p>On the flip side, the competitive nature of the event would be brought into question. The potential for one-sided matches would increase, while qualifying would become even more a foregone conclusion for many nations than it is already.</p><p>Questions will be asked about the added amount of travel that players and fans will have to make, with sustainability likely to be an important issue with the increased number of flights needed to transport teams, fans and media.</p><p>Peter Crisp from fan climate campaign group Fossil Free Football said the move \"would dilute the World Cup's prestige, kill off jeopardy in qualifying and worsen the extreme weather already harming football by producing more planet-warming pollution than ever\".</p></div><p></p><h2 id=\"What-might-it-look-like\"><span>What might it look like?</span></h2><p></p><div><figure><p><span><picture><source srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/240/cpsprodpb/cbd7/live/0ed796a0-9a01-11f0-88dc-4bebfe637e18.jpg.webp 240w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/320/cpsprodpb/cbd7/live/0ed796a0-9a01-11f0-88dc-4bebfe637e18.jpg.webp 320w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/480/cpsprodpb/cbd7/live/0ed796a0-9a01-11f0-88dc-4bebfe637e18.jpg.webp 480w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/624/cpsprodpb/cbd7/live/0ed796a0-9a01-11f0-88dc-4bebfe637e18.jpg.webp 624w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/800/cpsprodpb/cbd7/live/0ed796a0-9a01-11f0-88dc-4bebfe637e18.jpg.webp 800w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/976/cpsprodpb/cbd7/live/0ed796a0-9a01-11f0-88dc-4bebfe637e18.jpg.webp 976w\" type=\"image/webp\"></source><img alt=\"Gianni Infantino announces Morocco, Portugal and Spain will co-host the 2030 World Cup\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/2560/cpsprodpb/cbd7/live/0ed796a0-9a01-11f0-88dc-4bebfe637e18.jpg\" srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/240/cpsprodpb/cbd7/live/0ed796a0-9a01-11f0-88dc-4bebfe637e18.jpg 240w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/320/cpsprodpb/cbd7/live/0ed796a0-9a01-11f0-88dc-4bebfe637e18.jpg 320w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/480/cpsprodpb/cbd7/live/0ed796a0-9a01-11f0-88dc-4bebfe637e18.jpg 480w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/624/cpsprodpb/cbd7/live/0ed796a0-9a01-11f0-88dc-4bebfe637e18.jpg 624w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/800/cpsprodpb/cbd7/live/0ed796a0-9a01-11f0-88dc-4bebfe637e18.jpg 800w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/976/cpsprodpb/cbd7/live/0ed796a0-9a01-11f0-88dc-4bebfe637e18.jpg 976w\" /></picture></span><span><span>Image source, </span>Getty Images</span></p><figcaption><span>Image caption, </span><p>Spain, Portugal and Morocco will co-host the 2030 World Cup - but the opening matches will be held in South America</p></figcaption></figure></div><div><p>This is a difficult question to answer.</p><p>The notion of a 64-team tournament is almost unprecedented in top-level international sport, so it is difficult to cite any examples.</p><p>Next summer's expanded format is complicated enough, with the top two and best eight third-place finishers from 12 groups of four qualifying for the last 32.</p><p>The obvious structure for a 64-team World Cup in 2030 would be for the top two from 16 groups of four to qualify for the last 32. Perhaps a bit tidier than next years?</p><p>Should the proposal eventually be accepted, the 2030 edition would include 128 matches - up from the 64-game format played between 1998 and 2022.</p><p>Next year's World Cup will have 104 matches and will take 72 games – eight games more than an entire 32-team World Cup – just to get down to 32 teams.</p><p>From the start of the 2026 tournament until the end of the last 16 there will be 96 games across 27 days, with no rest day.</p><p>Just one of those days will feature a single match, and just two days will have only two matches. The remaining 24 days will feature three, four or even six matches.</p><p>Therefore, the impact of another 16 teams joining the fray is rather mind-boggling.</p><p>How would they fit in the extra matches?</p><p>Fifa has already stated the 2030 finals will run from 8 June, with the final on 21 July, and the possibility of making the tournament longer would seem unlikely with the footballing calendar already more tightly packed than many would like.</p><p>This would mean the need for more games per day in the group stages and thus extra stadiums would have to be considered.</p><p>There have been suggestions Argentina, Uruguay and Paraguay could host more games during these group stages.</p><p>And what would the impact be on qualifying?</p><p>For starters, it would be almost inconceivable that the world's top football nations would not qualify for the World Cup.</p><p>While Italy are currently preparing to sit out a third consecutive World Cup, such shock scenarios, which are all part of the drama, are hard to envisage should a 64-team tournament become a reality.</p><p>Conmebol could already see a maximum of seven teams qualify for next summer's event, and they would clearly want more members qualifying for an expanded tournament.</p><p>All other continents would also be expected to have more qualifying spots, but the logistics around this are purely guesswork for now.</p><p>The mere potential of a 64-team World Cup has raised plenty of questions - as well as eyebrows. Whether it gets off the ground or not remains to be seen, a matter for sporting and political power-brokers to figure out.</p><p>This article is the latest from BBC Sport's <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.bbc.com/sport/ask-me-anything\"><i>Ask Me Anything</i></a> team.</p></div><p></p><h2 id=\"What-is-Ask-Me-Anything\"><span>What is Ask Me Anything?</span></h2><p></p><div><p>Ask Me Anything is a service dedicated to answering your questions.</p><p>We want to reward your time by telling you things you do not know and reminding you of things you do.</p><p>The team will find out everything you need to know and be able to call upon a network of contacts including our experts and pundits.</p><p>We will be answering your questions from the heart of the BBC Sport newsroom, and going behind the scenes at some of the world's biggest sporting events.</p><p>Our coverage will span the BBC Sport website, app, social media and YouTube accounts, plus BBC TV and radio.</p></div><section><p></p><h2>More on this story</h2><p></p></section></article></div>"

The court found Gueant guilty of corruption, among other charges, and Hortefeux was found guilty of criminal conspiracy.</p><p>Sarkozy's wife, Italian-born former supermodel and singer Carla Bruni-Sarkozy, was <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cd1xv3xewdno\">charged last year with hiding evidence linked to the Gaddafi case</a> and associating with wrongdoers to commit fraud, both of which she denies.</p><p>Since losing his re-election bid in 2012, Sarkozy has been targeted by several criminal investigations.</p><p>He also appealed against a February 2024 ruling which found him <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-68293760\">guilty of overspending on his 2012 re-election campaign</a>, then hiring a PR firm to cover it up. He was handed a one-year sentence, of which six months were suspended.</p><p>In 2021, he was found guilty of trying to bribe a judge in 2014 and became the first former French president to get a custodial sentence. In December, the Paris appeals court ruled that he could serve his time at home wearing a tag instead of going to jail.</p></div>"

    "body": "<div><p>Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas has said he is ready to work with world leaders to implement a peace plan for Israel and the Palestinians announced by France on Monday.</p><p>Speaking via video at the UN General Assembly, Abbas reiterated his rejection of a future governing role for Hamas in Gaza and demanded it disarm.</p><p>He also called on countries which had not yet recognised a Palestinian state to do so, and for the UN to grant it full membership.</p><p>Abbas denounced Israel's military offensive in Gaza, accusing it of committing \"one of the most horrific humanitarian tragedies of the 20th and 21st Centuries\". But he said he \"rejected\" the actions of Hamas in its attack on Israel on 7 October 2023.</p></div><div><p>That attack, in which about 1,200 people - mostly civilians - were killed and 251 taken hostage, triggered the war in Gaza. At least 65,502 Palestinians, about half of them women and children, have been killed by Israeli military action in Gaza since then, according to Gaza's Hamas-run health ministry.</p><p>Abbas, 89, was barred from travelling to New York to appear in person when he and 80 other Palestinian officials had their visas revoked by the US state department last month.</p><p>US Secretary of State Marco Rubio blamed them for undermining peace efforts and for seeking \"the unilateral recognition of a conjectural Palestinian state\".</p><p>In his speech, Abbas thanked those countries which had recently recognised a Palestinian state in a wave of declarations which began with Canada, Australia, the UK and Portugal on Sunday.</p><p>France, Belgium, Luxembourg, Malta, Monaco, San Marino, Andorra, and Denmark followed. </p><p>The US is currently opposed to recognising Palestine, saying such a move is a reward for Hamas.</p><p>Abbas endorsed the peace plan announced by French President Emmanuel Macron at Monday's summit, which was co-chaired by Saudi Arabia.</p><p>The plan calls for the simultaneous release of the 48 remaining hostages held by Hamas with an end to Israeli military operations across Gaza. </p><p>That would be followed by a transitional administration - including Abbas's Palestinian Authority (PA) and excluding Hamas - to run Gaza, paving the way for a \"sovereign, independent, and demilitarised State of Palestine\".</p><p>Neither the US nor Israel have supported the plan. </p><p>Abbas though said he was \"read[y] to work with President Donald Trump, the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, France, the United Nations, and all partners to implement the peace plan... paving the way toward a just peace and comprehensive regional co-operation\".</p><p>He also called for a Palestinian state to assume \"full responsibilities\" for the Gaza Strip following an Israeli withdrawal and connect it with the Israeli-occupied West Bank. He said this would be done with Arab and international support. </p><p>Israel has previously rejected any future post-war role for the PA in Gaza.</p><p>The Palestinian president also said there would be \"national efforts toward reform, including holding presidential and parliamentary elections within one year of the war's end\". </p><p>\"We want a democratic, modern state committed to international law, rule of law, pluralism, peaceful transfer of power, and the empowerment of women and youth.\"</p><p>The last national Palestinian elections were held in 2006 and were won by Hamas.</p><p>The group violently ejected Abbas's Fatah faction - their political rivals - from Gaza the following year, leaving it in sole power there.</p></div>"

Its factories remain closed until next month at the earliest.</p><p>The prime minister said the government was \"working 24/7\" on a support package for suppliers amid growing concerns that some, mostly small businesses, could go bust due to the prolonged shutdown of operations.</p></div><div><p>Sir Keir Starmer said the situation faced by suppliers was \"urgent\", but admitted no support plan had yet been finalised.</p><p>\"I am acutely aware of the urgency of the situation and the difficulties that many of these companies are inevitably finding themselves, through no fault of course of their own,\" he told the BBC.</p><p>Various ideas have been put forward over how the government could step in to support suppliers of JLR until car production is restarted.</p><p>The company said on Thursday that its recovery programme was \"firmly under way\" and that its global parts logistics centre, which supplies spare parts that service customers' vehicles, \"returning to full operations\".</p><p>\"The financial system we use to process the wholesales of vehicles has been brought back online and we are able to sell and register vehicles for our clients faster, delivering important cash flow,\" the company added.</p><p>The carmaker said it recognised that the situation was a \"difficult time for all connected with JLR\", with no new cars being built and staff being sent home from work.</p><p>The manufacturer, which is owned by India's Tata Motors, typically builds about 1,000 cars a day at its three factories in Solihull and Wolverhampton in West Midlands, and Halewood in Merseyside.</p><p>Workers have been told to stay home since 1 September, with no firm return date.</p><p>About 30,000 people are directly employed at the company's plants with about 100,000 working for firms in the supply chain. Some of these firms supply parts exclusively to JLR, while others sell components to other carmakers as well.</p></div><div><p>Calls have been made to support suppliers, whose businesses are under threat as a result of the knock-on impact of the cyber attack.</p><p>One idea being explored is the government buying the component parts the suppliers build, with the aim of keeping the companies in JLR's supply chain in business until production lines are up and running again.</p><p>However, firms have told the BBC they are sceptical about the success of such a scheme.</p><p>The government \"simply don't understand the complexity of what they're dealing with\", said one supplier.</p><p>\"We don't need promises, we need help.\"</p><p>The prime minister said the business secretary, Peter Kyle, was \"working 24/7 with those businesses to come up with a viable way of solving this and supporting them in this crucial period\".</p><p>Meanwhile, Industry Minister Chris McDonald said the move towards restarting production was \"welcome progress towards JLR's recovery\" and a step in supporting cash flow across JLR's supply chains, adding that the government would continue its dialogue with the beleaguered firm.</p><p>Unions have called for a Covid-style furlough scheme, but ministers have ruled this out given its likely cost, sources have told the BBC.</p><p>Following a private meeting between JLR's suppliers and the Business and Trade Select Committee on Thursday afternoon, chair of the committee Liam Byrne MP has written to Chancellor Rachel Reeves warning some firms had only \"weeks left\" before the financial impact seriously disrupts elements of the car supply chain.</p><p>While the purchase and stockpiling of car parts by the government is an option on the table, this would present considerable logistical challenges.</p><p>JLR's manufacturing process relies on the right part arriving at the right place, at the right time.</p><p>Another option being considered is government-backed loans to suppliers, though this is understood to be unpopular with suppliers.</p></div>"

    "body": "<div><p>The Israeli military says its air force has carried out its \"most powerful strike\" in Yemen in response to the Houthi movement's repeated drone and missile attacks on Israel.</p><p>The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said dozens of its aircraft bombed targets belonging to the Houthis' security and intelligence services, and military in the capital Sanaa.</p><p>The Houthi-run government's health ministry denounced what it called Israel's \"brutal crime\", saying civilian facilities and residential buildings were hit and that eight people were killed.</p><p>It comes a day after 22 people were injured, two of them seriously, in a Houthi drone attack in the Israeli Red Sea resort of Eilat.</p></div><div><p>The Houthis have controlled much of north-western Yemen since they ousted the country's internationally recognised government from there 10 years ago, sparking a civil war.</p><p>They began attacking Israel and international shipping in the southern Red Sea and the Gulf of Aden shortly after the start of the war between Israel and Hamas in Gaza in October 2023, saying they were acting in support of the Palestinians.</p><p>Israel has carried out many rounds of air strikes in Yemen in retaliation for the hundreds of missiles and drones that have been launched at the country by the Houthis.</p></div><div><p>Videos from Sanaa showed large plumes of black smoke rising from at least three locations in the city following the Israeli strikes on Thursday afternoon.</p><p>The attack took place moments before Houthi-run Al-Masirah TV began broadcasting a speech by the movement's leader, Abdul Malik al-Houthi.</p><p>Al-Masirah reported that the strikes targeted residential areas in the Maain and Sabaeen districts, as well as the Dhahban power station. It posted photographs showing several destroyed and damaged buildings.</p><p>Health ministry spokesman Dr Anees al-Asbahi accused the IDF of the \"deliberate and systematic targeting of civilian, service, and residential facilities\", which he said was \"a war crime in every sense of the word.</p><p>He reported that eight people were killed and 142 injured, and that civilians were among them. He added that first responders were still searching under rubble for casualties.</p></div><div><p>Israeli Defence Minister Israel Katz wrote on X that his country had \"delivered a powerful strike on numerous terror targets of the Houthi terror organisation in Sanaa\".</p><p>The IDF said in a statement that the targets included the Houthi military's General Staff Command Headquarters, security and intelligence compounds, the Houthis' \"military public relations headquarters\", and military camps used to store weapons.</p><p>\"The IDF will operate against the ongoing and repeated attacks of the Houthi terrorist regime against the State of Israel, will conduct additional offensive operations against the Houthi regime in the near future,\" it added.</p><p>A separate statement from the Israeli military said an inquiry into Wednesday's Houthi attack on Eilat had suggested that the drone launched from Yemen was \"detected relatively late, and that warning sirens were activated in accordance with protocol.</p><p>\"Interception attempts were made using the Iron Dome [air defence system], but were unsuccessful. The cause for that has been identified, and corrective measures were implemented.\"</p><p>Since the beginning of the war in Gaza, Israeli forces have intercepted more than 98% of the drones launched towards Israel by the Houthis, according to the IDF.</p><p>The Houthis' military spokesman said the attack was a \"response to the crimes of genocide and the dangerous escalation carried out by the Israeli enemy against our people in the Gaza Strip\".</p><p>On 10 September, four days after a Houthi drone attack on Eilat's Ramon airport wounded one person, the Israeli military carried out a series of strikes in Sanaa and al-Jawf province that killed 35 people, according to the Houthi-run health ministry.</p><p>The Committee to Protect Journalists (CPJ) said last week that 31 journalists and media support workers were among those killed in Sanaa and that the incident constituted the deadliest single attack on the press worldwide in 16 years.</p><p>Yemen's September 26 newspaper said all but one of them had worked in its office or the headquarters of the government's Moral Guidance Directorate, which were both bombed.</p><p>The IDF said at the time that it had targeted the \"Houthi Public Relations Department\".</p></div>"

He was convicted in July on two counts of prostitution. </p><p>Combs' lawyers argue his convictions were a misuse of the Mann Act - a federal law that was passed to combat human trafficking and sexual exploitation of women. </p><p>Combs is due to be sentenced on 3 October. </p></div><div><p>The rapper and music mogul faces up to 10 years in prison for each count. </p><p>But his legal team have proposed that he receive no more than a 14-month sentence. Since the rapper has remained in federal custody<b> </b>since September 2024, he would have already served most of his sentence. </p><p>Prosecutors, however, are seeking several more years.</p><p>Combs' lawyers have also argued that he was unjustly convicted under the Mann Act and applying it is \"unprecedented\" because prostitution should apply when someone pays for sex - not to someone who watches, just as Combs is said to have done during his so-called freak-offs.</p><p>During Thursday's hearing, Combs' defence attorney Alexandra Shapiro portrayed him as a voyeur who enjoyed producing and watching amateur pornography, according to CBS News, the BBC's US media partner.</p><p>The judge asked the defence lawyer multiple times what that has to do with the Mann Act charges of transporting people prostitution.</p><p>They said that Combs had \"no commercial motive\" and that prosecutors on the case \"have lost all perspective\" by advocating for an enhanced sentence that is \"wildly out of proportion\".</p><p>In a court filing, they said that Combs, 55, has been punished enough and \"his life outside of jail has been systematically dismantled\".</p><p>\"Mr Combs's celebrity status in the realms of music, fashion, spirits, media, and finance has been shattered and Mr Combs's legacy has been destroyed,\" his lawyers said, adding that his seven children \"desperately await his return to their lives\".</p><p>The Bad Boy Records co- founder waved to his supporters as he appeared in court again on Thursday. </p><p>If the court declines to grant an acquittal, his attorneys argued that a new trial is required due to \"severe spillover prejudice from reams of inflammatory evidence\".</p><p><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cx20303kz53o\">Combs was acquitted</a> in July of the more severe racketeering conspiracy and sex trafficking charges relating to his ex-partner Casandra Ventura and another woman referred to as \"Jane\". </p><p>He was <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c0qz32wzeego\">convicted on two lesser charges </a>of arranging interstate travel for people engaged in prostitution. </p><p>Prosecutors said during the trial that Combs had arranged for paid sexual encounters between male sex workers and his girlfriends, some of whom testified about being beaten, kicked and choked by him.</p><p>The music mogul pleaded not guilty to all of the charges brought against him.</p><p>The judge has already twice refused to grant bail to the Grammy-winning artist.</p></div>"

Not only did they send a 70 year-old man to five years in jail, it was a shocking 20 years after the offence.</p><p>They also stipulated that the sentence was not \"suspensive\" – in other words they said he would go to jail even if he lodged an appeal, even though in French law pending an appeal he is in theory still innocent.</p><p>Just when you thought the old passions for and against the man were beginning to fade, suddenly they are back with a vengeance.</p><p>Many will feel some sympathy with Sarkozy – not necessarily that he is entirely guiltless in this matter of seeking Libyan campaign money.</p></div><div><p>But they will see some truth in his claims of victimisation: that there are indeed some in the Paris \"politico-mediatic-judicial\" establishment who loathe the former president and rejoice in bringing him down.</p><p>Look through another lens, though, and Sarkozy is not some hard-done-by ex-head of state, but an egotistical and highly influential political operator who has consistently pushed the law to its limits in order to get his way.</p><p>Why else would there be such a litany of lawsuits against him? Why else would Sarkozy already have been convicted on two other charges of corruption – once for trying to suborn a judge, and another time for illegal campaign funding?</p><p>And if the court has now decided to throw the book at him in the Libya affair,  maybe it is because the charge of trying to elicit election funds from a foreign dictator is actually a rather serious one.</p><p>It is all relevant today because even though Sarkozy is no longer the influential figure that some make him out to be, the arguments about this case echo through the hall of ruins that are French politics.</p><p>The right and far-right take up his cause, crying foul about left-wing judicial over-reach. Marine Le Pen – herself banned from running for the presidency because of a \"no-suspension\" clause in her own conviction early this year – was first to denounce the \"injustice\".</p><p>And the left sees it all as more evidence of rich men's privilege – the powerful getting more powerful by blithely ignoring the law.</p><p>Nicolas Sarkozy has long since left office, and there is no prospect of his returning.  He is a figure of the past.  But his case lays bare the divisions in a very divided country.</p></div>"
