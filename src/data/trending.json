Israel, it says, has never provided evidence of the allegations of systematic theft, despite repeated UN requests.</p></div><div><ul><li><b>Outside of the UK, you can </b><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IA8YL_Datm0\"><b>watch on YouTube</b></a></li></ul></div><div><p>Famine is why Palestinians in Gaza, many of them young men like Abdullah, are prepared to risk their lives at the GHF sites to get food.</p><p>It is nearly two years since Hamas killed 1,195 people in southern Israel and took 251 hostages. Forty-eight Israelis are still in Gaza. Perhaps 20 of them are thought to be alive. It remains Israel's biggest trauma since its independence in 1948.</p><p>Israel's response has been to inflict the biggest trauma Palestinians have suffered in the same nearly eight decades. The Israelis continue to argue they are acting in self defence in Gaza - a narrow strip of land that is now in ruins, and has seen the killing by Israel of at least 65,000 people, according to the Hamas-run health ministry, including more than 18,000 children. Israel rejects these figures but they are generally considered reliable by international organisations.</p><p>Abdullah was a bright young man. Sticky notes above his desk display reminders to himself to aim for 95% in his exams. Judging by the photos his father provides, he dressed smartly, with a sharp haircut and an expectant smile. He must have seen possibilities ahead in his life, even in Gaza, a place where life was hard even before the war. Now it is reduced to a struggle to survive Israeli attacks and the famine.</p></div><figure><div><p><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20250905-110137-f27f908f49-web-2.29.1-3/grey-placeholder.png\" /><img srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/61af/live/81db2590-9894-11f0-af62-91486a511a31.jpg.webp 240w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/61af/live/81db2590-9894-11f0-af62-91486a511a31.jpg.webp 320w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/61af/live/81db2590-9894-11f0-af62-91486a511a31.jpg.webp 480w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/61af/live/81db2590-9894-11f0-af62-91486a511a31.jpg.webp 640w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/61af/live/81db2590-9894-11f0-af62-91486a511a31.jpg.webp 800w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/61af/live/81db2590-9894-11f0-af62-91486a511a31.jpg.webp 1024w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/61af/live/81db2590-9894-11f0-af62-91486a511a31.jpg.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/61af/live/81db2590-9894-11f0-af62-91486a511a31.jpg.webp\" alt=\"Aerial image of where Abdullah was shot and killed in Gaza, showing where shots were fired from the direction of an IDF position, and also where aid seekers came under fire. Image copyright: Planet Labs PLC, 3 Aug 2025\" /></p></div></figure><div><p>Abdullah's neighbour, Moaaz, a friend since childhood took up the story of what happened the day he died. They went together to GHF site 4, the only one in the centre of Gaza, following the instructions of IDF soldiers about the correct route to take. To get ahead in the deadly race for food, many Palestinians arrive at the GHF sites long before dawn. Moaaz and Abdullah were waiting near a ruined house less than 500 metres from the site.</p><p>Then Abdullah said he had to deal with a call of nature, and moved, Moaaz says, about 30 metres away. That was when he was shot dead. Moaaz said he ran through heavy fire to get to his friend. He lived around 10 more minutes.</p><p>Diaa told us about his son, and how hard it is to live and stay alive in Gaza.</p><p>\"In Gaza we are a peaceful people. Abdullah was a young man like any other. May God have mercy on him. He didn't get the chance to fulfil any of his dreams.\"</p></div><div><p>We asked the IDF specifically about the death of Abdullah. It did not respond but told us it \"does not deliberately fire at innocent civilians\". GHF's lawyers say its security contractors do not open fire either. They say they are not aware of any credibly documented instance of their ever doing so - and that no-one has been shot dead at a GHF site, or within sight of one.</p><p>Abdullah's story comes from the film that we have just broadcast, called Gaza: Dying for Food, produced by Panorama and BBC Eye.  It is an investigation into hunger in Gaza, and the killing around the food distribution sites run by the GHF. Dying for Food looks at just one part of Gaza's humanitarian catastrophe. We have established how so many Palestinians are being killed seeking aid. It is a worthy subject for a half-hour television film. A comprehensive account from every angle would need a series.</p><p>Reporting and producing the film has been a considerable challenge. That is because Israel does not permit the BBC, or any other news organisation, to send teams into Gaza to report freely. Palestinian journalists inside Gaza have done heroic work, without which we would know much less about what has been happening there in the past two years. According to the UN Human Rights Office, at least 248 of them have been killed by Israel.</p><p>On Dying for Food I was the reporter, the public face of a big team of journalists. I wrote the script, but I did not interview Diaa or Moaaz about the killing of Abdullah. I wasn't present when the filming took place of the dead and dying in hospital emergency departments, of miles of rubble and Palestinians desperate to grab some food while the IDF and armed American security men working for GHF were said to have opened fire. I was able to talk to the interviewees who weren't in Gaza, either face to face or via video.</p><p>It is not the way the BBC, or any other group of journalists and film makers would choose to work. A fundamental rule of journalism is to narrow the distance between the reporter and the story. It was drummed into me when I was a BBC trainee journalist assigned to the Belfast newsroom during the Troubles in the winter of 1984-85. An acerbic news editor, using a tone that might get him into trouble these days, told me to leave the building to use my own eyes and ears, and to talk to people.</p></div><figure><div><p><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20250905-110137-f27f908f49-web-2.29.1-3/grey-placeholder.png\" /><img srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/b91e/live/fa1900d0-989f-11f0-af62-91486a511a31.jpg.webp 240w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/b91e/live/fa1900d0-989f-11f0-af62-91486a511a31.jpg.webp 320w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/b91e/live/fa1900d0-989f-11f0-af62-91486a511a31.jpg.webp 480w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/b91e/live/fa1900d0-989f-11f0-af62-91486a511a31.jpg.webp 640w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/b91e/live/fa1900d0-989f-11f0-af62-91486a511a31.jpg.webp 800w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/b91e/live/fa1900d0-989f-11f0-af62-91486a511a31.jpg.webp 1024w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/b91e/live/fa1900d0-989f-11f0-af62-91486a511a31.jpg.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/b91e/live/fa1900d0-989f-11f0-af62-91486a511a31.jpg.webp\" alt=\"Tawfik pictured sitting down.

The IDF allows some news teams short and heavily supervised visits. I have done one, for about three or four hours, in the first month of the war. It let me see the destruction first hand, and to talk to soldiers. </p><p>One IDF officer started by telling me that they worked hard to safeguard the lives of noncombatants. Even in the first few weeks of the war, Israel was being accused of ignoring its legal obligations to protect civilians. Then the officer trailed off, and in disgust told me that all the Palestinians were guilty, not just the Hamas units that had led the 7 October attacks. If they weren't guilty, he said, they would have found a way to overthrow Hamas.</p><p>To get round Israel's ban on our entry into Gaza, we commission local freelancers who are still able to operate on the ground. Our team had long conversations with them about where to film, who to interview and what to ask. We needed to know about the backgrounds and relevance to the story of potential interviewees and where filming would be an acceptable risk to take in a warzone where nowhere is safe.</p><p>From a distance, BBC journalists directed the teams we used in Gaza. We reviewed and verified the material we received, examining closely the data embedded in videos that shows when and where it was shot. Just communicating with people in Gaza is hard. Digital connections are patchy. It took several days for the story of Abdullah to be sent to London after it was filmed. </p><p>Connectivity out of Gaza is often weak or non-existent, as Israel has bombed mobile phone masts and internet hubs. The current Israeli offensive in Gaza made movement difficult and highly dangerous. One of the filmmakers we worked with in Gaza City went quiet for a few days while they moved their family somewhere they hoped might be safer.</p><p>We also asked for permission to film at the GHF sites but were refused.</p><p>Reporting from a distance is not the way we want to work. But given the constraints imposed by Israel, we believe we have found the best obtainable way to tell the story of how Gazans live and die.</p></div><figure><div><p><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20250905-110137-f27f908f49-web-2.29.1-3/grey-placeholder.png\" /><img srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/be06/live/b1716bb0-9863-11f0-858a-a904eacbef23.jpg.webp 240w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/be06/live/b1716bb0-9863-11f0-858a-a904eacbef23.jpg.webp 320w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/be06/live/b1716bb0-9863-11f0-858a-a904eacbef23.jpg.webp 480w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/be06/live/b1716bb0-9863-11f0-858a-a904eacbef23.jpg.webp 640w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/be06/live/b1716bb0-9863-11f0-858a-a904eacbef23.jpg.webp 800w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/be06/live/b1716bb0-9863-11f0-858a-a904eacbef23.jpg.webp 1024w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/be06/live/b1716bb0-9863-11f0-858a-a904eacbef23.jpg.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/be06/live/b1716bb0-9863-11f0-858a-a904eacbef23.jpg.webp\" alt=\"Picture of Reem, who is looking to the side of the camera.

He was also looking for food, more plentiful then but still dangerous to venture out to get it as Israel invaded and pummelled Gaza. </p><p>She was interviewed in a tent in Gaza City. We have not been able to contact her in the past week or so. We believe Reem might have taken her two children south from Gaza City to escape the ferocious offensive Israel has launched to capture the area. If so, it would be the sixth time they have been displaced. Most of Gaza's more than two million civilians have been displaced many times.</p><p>One way of getting information when physically you are not there to see it for yourself is to talk to witnesses. I interviewed an NHS doctor just back from Gaza called Tawfik Omar, who is a vascular surgeon in Coventry. Tawfik is from Egypt and spoke at length to patients and their families in Gaza. Vascular surgeons see a lot of blood. Tawfik was shocked in Gaza by an overpowering smell of blood in hospitals packed with the dead and dying who had been shot near aid sites.</p><p>\"The local people coming from the GHF points,\" he told me, \"are saying clearly that we can see the GHF security guards or the IDF personnel shooting directly at the crowds.\"</p><p>Dying for Food features two whistleblowers, who didn't want to be identified. One was a lorry driver for a GHF logistics subcontractor. We called him \"John\" and hid his identity because he is worried that his safety might be compromised if it was known that he had spoken out. He told me that another potential whistleblower had been silenced by threats from former colleagues.</p><p>There are only three GHF aid points, compared to 400 that existed when the UN was distributing aid. John told us they felt like military bases on the front line, not places where humanitarian aid was given to those who need it. He told us that every night he did his work, it was with the background of heavy gunfire. John was so shocked by what he saw that he secretly recorded videos with his mobile.</p></div><p></p><figcaption>Watch: Whistleblower's secret recordings of gunfire near GHF aid sites</figcaption><p></p><div><p>His videos were part of the material we used to establish a pattern of the IDF's use of live fire to control crowds, an intrinsically lethal technique. On a day when more than 20 people were killed near the single GHF aid site in central Gaza, we were able to use John's video taken that night to help establish what was happening.</p><p>It shows heavy fire coming from an IDF position just behind site four. The bullets were hitting an area where we established that hungry people, in their thousands, would often gather near a bridge over a dried-up river bed that leads to the entrance of the site.</p><p>Even though we were not physically in Gaza, our team analysed John's videos (and many others) using open-source intelligence, a way to check events and corroborate testimony by using the latest techniques and software to sort through the wealth of data and video that is available online. We spoke to five ballistics experts, and used software that analyses the sound of shooting on videos, to help establish the trajectory of bullets.</p><p>We used satellite pictures, which are no longer the sole preserve of intelligence agencies, and matched the detail they showed with the videos. Satellite pictures are available commercially and are especially valuable in the Gaza Strip, which straddles a 40-km (25-mile) stretch of the eastern Mediterranean coast where clouds are rare.</p><p>Videos shot on mobiles carry metadata, which includes the digital record of the time, date and place where they were shot. We know the dates of our whistleblower's videos, but we have not revealed them to help John stay anonymous.</p><p>The data on the number of deaths at GHF sites comes from a body called Armed Conflict Location and Event Data (ACLED). It collects and analyses data from warzones and is funded, among others, by the United Nations, the European Union, the US and European countries including the UK.</p><p>ACLED's data shows that since the GHF began its operations, at least 1,300 Palestinians have been killed at, or around, its sites, mostly by IDF fire. Across Gaza, Palestinians were being killed seeking aid in the year before GHF arrived at an average rate of 30 per month. Since its sites opened, that has risen to 500.</p><p>The IDF denies the killing. It told us that it is \"not aware of hundreds of fatalities caused by… [its] …forces at distribution points.\" It says these figures are \"inflated and false\".</p></div><figure><div><p><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20250905-110137-f27f908f49-web-2.29.1-3/grey-placeholder.png\" /><img srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/1ad8/live/02913500-98a2-11f0-af62-91486a511a31.jpg.webp 240w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/1ad8/live/02913500-98a2-11f0-af62-91486a511a31.jpg.webp 320w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/1ad8/live/02913500-98a2-11f0-af62-91486a511a31.jpg.webp 480w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/1ad8/live/02913500-98a2-11f0-af62-91486a511a31.jpg.webp 640w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/1ad8/live/02913500-98a2-11f0-af62-91486a511a31.jpg.webp 800w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/1ad8/live/02913500-98a2-11f0-af62-91486a511a31.jpg.webp 1024w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/1ad8/live/02913500-98a2-11f0-af62-91486a511a31.jpg.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/1ad8/live/02913500-98a2-11f0-af62-91486a511a31.jpg.webp\" alt=\"Reuters Picture showing people carrying aid away from a GHF food distribution site in Gaza.

Peace is not even a distant dream. The war that started with the attacks led by Hamas on 7 October 2023 is as significant a moment in the history of the conflict as the ones in 1948, when Israel fought and won its independence, and 1967, when it captured and occupied the West Bank, including East Jerusalem and the Gaza Strip, giving it full control of the land.</p><p>The Gaza war has stripped the conflict to its essentials. European allies that gave Israel strong support after 7 October 2023, have decided that the only way to try to offer a better way ahead than perpetual war is to recognise an independent Palestine, which the UK, France and others have done this week at the UN General Assembly in New York.</p><p>Israel and its supporters, led by the US, have condemned the move as a reward for Hamas terrorism. The counter argument to that is that the best way of ending armed attacks on Israelis is to create the conditions for Palestinian independence and allow Palestinians to set up a state in Gaza, the West Bank, including a capital in East Jerusalem. The occupation of Palestinian land is illegal under international law according to the International Court of Justice.</p><p>The determined opposition of Israel, backed by the US, makes the vision of a Palestinian state remote. So does the presence of more than 700,000 Jewish settlers in the West Bank, including East Jerusalem, on land the UK and others now call the state of Palestine. But Britain's Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer and France's President Emmanuel Macron argue they have to act now to try to keep alive the hope of peace through the two-state solution. If Israel does not accept Palestinian independence, it will find itself even more isolated for ruling over millions of people and denying them political rights.</p><p>The current offensive is aimed at forcing up to one million people out of Gaza City. It suits the plan pushed by Benjamin Netanyahu's hardline allies to seize the Gaza Strip for Jewish settlers - and force Palestinians out.  One extremist leader in the Israeli cabinet predicted a real estate bonanza.</p><p>There is strong evidence of war crimes on both sides.  Hamas committed war crimes when it broke through Israel's border defences two years ago, and in the months that followed when it still had the capacity to fire barrages of missiles at Israeli towns. Holding hostages in appalling conditions and threatening their lives is also a crime.</p><p>Israel faces accusations of a genocidal attack on Gaza's Palestinians, not just with bullets and high explosive, but by using food as a weapon of war. The IPC, the world body that assesses food emergencies, says famine caused by the Israeli blockade of Gaza is present and spreading. If it is proved that Israel is committing acts with the intent to destroy Gaza's Palestinians as a group, in whole or in part, then genocide will be added to the list of war crimes that the whistleblower John - and many others - say that they have witnessed.</p><p>Israel says it has the most moral army in the world, has not committed war crimes, and is fighting a just war in the defence of its citizens. Benjamin Netanyahu insists the current offensive aimed at capturing Gaza City will deliver the elusive total victory over Hamas that he has promised repeatedly. He also insists it will rescue the Israeli hostages still in Gaza.</p><p>The UK says the IDF assault on Gaza is utterly reckless and appalling. The Foreign Secretary, Yvette Cooper, posted: \"It will only bring more bloodshed, kill more innocent civilians and endanger the remaining hostages. We need an immediate ceasefire, all hostages released, unrestricted humanitarian aid and a path to lasting peace.\"</p><p>When, in August, the IPC published its report saying that famine had spread to Gaza City, Israel was planning one of the biggest offensives of the war to capture the city and force about a million civilians to flee south.</p><p>Israel was open about its plans, which prompted a warning about the prospects for September from the IPC. It said that intensified military action, and the forced relocation of already fragile civilian populations would make the famine in Gaza \"significantly more severe\".</p><p>That is now the risk.</p></div></article>"

He made over 100 appearances across 10 years for New Zealand provincial side Waikato but never reached Test level.</p><p>During his time at Waikato, Mitchell also played a season in the All-Ireland League for Limerick-based Garryowen.</p><p>His return to Ireland in 1996, to work under fellow New Zealander Murray Kidd, who had coached at Garryowen, marked the beginning of his coaching ascent.</p><p>An opportunity arose the following season to take charge of Sale Sharks and he moved to England for the first time.</p><p>By 1997 Mitchell was in the England camp, specialising in defence under the leadership of Sir Clive Woodward.</p><p>\"He is a man that expects commitment. If you are committed to the team and him as a coach then he'll give you everything back,\" former England full-back Matt Perry recalled.</p><p>\"Being a proud Kiwi coaching England, the drills were challenging and brutal and you had to have the right mindset.</p><p>\"With defence you don't have to be angry but on your mettle at all times and really want to make tackles.

a decision he did not agree with, but accepted.</p><p>\"John Mitchell was a massive part of why England won the World Cup without a doubt,\" said Perry, who won the last of his international caps in 2006.</p><p>\"He created a steel within the side that you saw shone through.\"</p></div><div><figure><p><span><picture><source srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/240/cpsprodpb/8592/live/ee44bf40-986f-11f0-8ac5-61a603230ddd.jpg.webp 240w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/320/cpsprodpb/8592/live/ee44bf40-986f-11f0-8ac5-61a603230ddd.jpg.webp 320w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/480/cpsprodpb/8592/live/ee44bf40-986f-11f0-8ac5-61a603230ddd.jpg.webp 480w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/624/cpsprodpb/8592/live/ee44bf40-986f-11f0-8ac5-61a603230ddd.jpg.webp 624w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/800/cpsprodpb/8592/live/ee44bf40-986f-11f0-8ac5-61a603230ddd.jpg.webp 800w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/976/cpsprodpb/8592/live/ee44bf40-986f-11f0-8ac5-61a603230ddd.jpg.webp 976w\" type=\"image/webp\"></source><img alt=\"John Mitchell \" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/1024/cpsprodpb/8592/live/ee44bf40-986f-11f0-8ac5-61a603230ddd.jpg\" srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/240/cpsprodpb/8592/live/ee44bf40-986f-11f0-8ac5-61a603230ddd.jpg 240w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/320/cpsprodpb/8592/live/ee44bf40-986f-11f0-8ac5-61a603230ddd.jpg 320w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/480/cpsprodpb/8592/live/ee44bf40-986f-11f0-8ac5-61a603230ddd.jpg 480w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/624/cpsprodpb/8592/live/ee44bf40-986f-11f0-8ac5-61a603230ddd.jpg 624w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/800/cpsprodpb/8592/live/ee44bf40-986f-11f0-8ac5-61a603230ddd.jpg 800w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/976/cpsprodpb/8592/live/ee44bf40-986f-11f0-8ac5-61a603230ddd.jpg 976w\" /></picture></span><span><span>Image source, </span>Getty Images</span></p><figcaption><span>Image caption, </span><p>Mitchell featured for a New Zealand XV against a Scotland Development XV in 1993</p></figcaption></figure></div><div><p>A move back to New Zealand to coach Super Rugby side the Chiefs followed, before the All Blacks appointed a then 37-year-old Mitchell as head coach in 2001.</p><p>He won back-to-back Tri Nations titles (now known as The Rugby Championship) and chose to take a young squad to the 2003 World Cup, with centre Tana Umaga and scrum-half Justin Marshall the only players with more than 50 caps.</p><p>A disappointing semi-final exit to hosts Australia increased the pressure on Mitchell, who was later replaced as head coach.</p><p>But, as with his time in England, greats of New Zealand rugby -

Picture date: Tuesday September 23, 2025. PA Photo.\" /><span>PA Media</span></p></div></figure><div><p>Sir Ed Davey's speech to close the Liberal Democrat conference was punchy.</p><p>Here was a leader knowingly painting in primary colours and determined to be heard in our noisy politics.</p><p>This was a gathering of a party willing to double down on being more aggressive in making its arguments - in particular, its focus on the Reform leader Nigel Farage.</p><p>By my count there were at least 30 references to Farage – far, far more than to the prime minister or the Conservatives.</p><p>Senior Liberal Democrats spot an opportunity right now: a willingness to take on Reform and Donald Trump in a way Labour and the Tories either can't or won't.</p><p>And the party is using the Reform leader as a funding and recruiting sergeant.</p></div><div><p>They hope the prospect of a Farage premiership will motivate their activists, in efforts and donations, in a way a prospective Labour or Conservative victory might not do.</p><p>But the Lib Dems realise too that Reform's rise has a cost when it comes to a squeeze on the attention paid to Sir Ed Davey and his team, hence their noisy protests and allegations - repeated again by Sir Ed in his speech - about the relative coverage and scrutiny different parties receive from the BBC and others.</p><p>The corporation, incidentally, said \"these continuing attacks on BBC journalism are completely groundless – it is simply false to say that we give any political party any less scrutiny than any other\".</p><p>The Lib Dems also didn't remove a reference to the prospect of the UK's gun laws changing under a Reform government, despite Reform making it clear before the speech was delivered, but after the script had been shared with reporters, that they had no intention of changing the law.</p><p>When I asked if it was irresponsible or scaremongering to suggest schools might have to \"teach our children what to do in case of a mass shooting,\" they argued it is about holding Nigel Farage to account for remarks he made 11 years ago.</p><p>Reform accused him of \"spouting total madness\".</p><p>I'd say the mood of the Liberal Democrats felt chipper, but business-like.</p><p>This time last year, just after a stonkingly good general election result for them, their conference felt like a non-stop party.</p><p>Not so now. The political landscape has changed and changed quickly.</p></div><p></p><h2>Ed Davey's pitch</h2><p></p><div><p>The Lib Dems are far from the only ones seeking to adjust and adjust quickly.</p><p>Part of their strategy is to extend their appeal towards recent Conservative voters unattracted by both Reform and Kemi Badenoch's leadership of the Tories.</p><p>Sir Ed Davey's pitch was both direct - \"my message to you is this: come and talk to us\" - and also packaged in the language of a former Conservative prime minister.</p><p>The Lib Dem leader talked of \"male voice choirs and Hogmanay, county shows and school fairs, fish and chips, village greens and cricket pavilions\".</p><p>It reminded me of Sir John Major's words more than three decades ago:</p><p>\"Fifty years from now Britain will still be the country of long shadows on county grounds, warm beer, invincible green suburbs, dog lovers and pools fillers and - as George Orwell said - 'old maids bicycling to Holy Communion through the morning mist' - and if we get our way, Shakespeare still read even in school.\"</p><p>Both men, today and in 1993, are attempting to portray a pride in what they see as an understated patriotism and respect for traditions, a small c conservatism.</p><p>The Liberal Democrats hope they can be seen to represent the clearest and most authentic big party antidote to Reform.</p><p>And they are buoyed by internal polling suggesting more people are at least open to voting Lib Dem than for any other party right now.</p><p>But their challenge is they face a new and noisy rival in Reform for the protest votes of those put off by both the Conservatives and Labour.</p><p>They have grounds to hope and to worry in this increasingly competitive, noisy and fluid politics – and a determination not to be squeezed out of the conversation.</p></div></article>"

The 21-year-old is now sharing a bedroom with her 10-year-old sister.</p><p>Leoni is one of a growing number of young people who now say it is the rising cost of running a home that means they can't afford to buy or rent their own place, industry experts warn.</p><p>Nine out of 10 young adults living with parents in the UK would face costs of nearly half their income if they moved out, figures from property and finance firm the Skipton Group suggest.</p></div><div><p>While she gets on well with her mum and her sister Leoni says \"it just doesn't feel like it's my place.\"</p><p>\"It's not great in terms of not being able to see my partner, not having the life that we had, having to take that massive step back from the independence that I had. I just don't think it's fair.\"</p><p>But she felt she had no choice: \"Being able to afford running a home, it's just insane,\" she says.</p><p>\"When I first moved in I did have some savings ready, by the time we'd moved out they'd gone.\"</p><p>\"I'd say the main problems were the utilities, council tax, and rent,\" she says.</p></div><p></p><h2>Adults living with parents</h2><p></p><div><p>In 2011, there were 4.2m adults living with parents while not in education or caring for a relative. By 2021 that figure had risen to 4.9m, according to the Office for National Statistics.</p><p>Skipton Group commissioned research for its biannual<b> </b>Home Affordability Index, compiled by Oxford Economics. </p><p>It uses Office for National Statistics and house price data alongside a survey of 2,000 adults who are living with their parents to help understand why.</p></div><div><p>The data shared exclusively with the BBC suggested nearly 98% of adults living with their parents could not afford to pay what the average first-time buyer pays for a house in their area. </p><p>Even if they could afford a deposit, nine in 10 would face mortgage or rent payments, council tax, utility bills, insurance and maintenance costs that would use up nearly half of their income. If they bought a flat, that figure falls to eight in 10.</p><p>These calculations are based on one person buying alone and in the same local authority as their parents.</p><p>Stuart Haire,<b> </b>chief executive of the Skipton Group, says many young people move out nearby to stay close to their workplaces and friendship networks.</p><p>\"My heart goes out to them. I think it's a lost opportunity, and one that we really need to address,\" he says.</p><p>The report also highlights the financial impact for parents, as there can be a significant loss of income if parents can't move to a smaller property because older children are still living at home. </p></div><p></p><h2>Same costs on lower wages</h2><p></p><div><p>The trade body representing estate agents - Propertymark - said that rising living costs are \"becoming financially testing for many people, especially those working out their finances to step onto the housing ladder for the first time.\"</p><p>It said society needed to \"recognise that the costs associated with the first few years of home ownership come at a greater cost compared to those who run an existing home.\"</p><p>This group are facing the same jumps in utility, insurance, mortgage, rent and maintenance costs, but trying to cover them on significantly lower wages.</p></div><div><p>Right now, Leoni says she and her boyfriend will be living at home for the foreseeable future. They are saving again - but this time for a deposit to buy their own place - as well as enough to cover costs.</p><p>\"I'm saving for the money that I'll need to do the place up. I'm saving for furniture. I'm saving for bills, and I'm saving for an emergency fund,\" she says.</p><p>Dan Wilson Craw, deputy chief executive, of Generation Rent, says while many people would enjoy living with parents a lack of housing options can make starting a career or a relationship more difficult.</p><p>\"To fix this we need to build more social homes to allow people on lower incomes to fly the nest, and homes of all kinds in the places where jobs are being created,\" he says.</p><p>The government says increasing the minimum wage is helping, but that \"a generation of young people are locked out of homeownership... we're turning this crisis around by... building the 1.5 million homes this country needs.\"</p></div><figure><div><p><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20250905-110137-f27f908f49-web-2.29.1-3/grey-placeholder.png\" /><img srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/7e50/live/a7710080-98c7-11f0-928c-71dbb8619e94.png.webp 240w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/7e50/live/a7710080-98c7-11f0-928c-71dbb8619e94.png.webp 320w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/7e50/live/a7710080-98c7-11f0-928c-71dbb8619e94.png.webp 480w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/7e50/live/a7710080-98c7-11f0-928c-71dbb8619e94.png.webp 640w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/7e50/live/a7710080-98c7-11f0-928c-71dbb8619e94.png.webp 800w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/7e50/live/a7710080-98c7-11f0-928c-71dbb8619e94.png.webp 1024w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/7e50/live/a7710080-98c7-11f0-928c-71dbb8619e94.png.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/7e50/live/a7710080-98c7-11f0-928c-71dbb8619e94.png.webp\" alt=\"A red, black and white graphic reading Cost of Living Tackling It Together with a woman filling a mug from a kettle \" /></p></div></figure><p></p><h2>Ways to afford your own place</h2><p></p><div><ul><li>Consider buying with a sibling or friend rather than just a partner.</li><li>Some lenders have products that mean you don't pay anything on your mortgage for the first couple of months to help you over the rest of your moving costs.</li><li>If you open a Lifetime ISA before you're 40, you can use it to save for a deposit.

The subsequent review found not all safety standards had been met, forcing the trust to repay all the money it had received.</p><p>\"The repayment of the award is long overdue and should be going back even further,\" said Fiona Winser-Ramm, who lost her daughter Aliona in 2020 after what an inquest found to be a number of \"gross failures\" in the care they received.</p><p>\"This provides yet further evidence for the need for a full, independent inquiry into the Leeds trust,\" she said, believing this should be led by senior midwife Donna Ockenden.</p><p>Mrs Winser-Ramm was among a group of parents who met Health Secretary Wes Streeting last week and demanded an investigation into maternity services at the trust. </p><p>Streeting has so far refused to order such an inquiry but the families, who have all experienced poor maternity care, said they remained hopeful. </p><p>Over the past few months, dozens of families have told the BBC they received inadequate care at the trust.</p></div><div><p>The Maternity Incentive Scheme has been beset by problems since it was set up in 2018 by the then health secretary, Jeremy Hunt. </p><p>NHS trusts with poor maternity safety records, including Shrewsbury and Telford, Morecambe Bay, East Kent and Nottingham have all claimed to have met the 10 standards and been paid millions of pounds only to later have to repay it. </p><p>An analysis published by NHS Resolution in July found 24 trusts have had to repay premiums over the first four years of the scheme, with 18 of them having to do so more than once.</p><p>\"Nationally, families have long raised concerns about the huge flaws of the self- assessment involved by individual trusts in the maternity incentive scheme,\" said Mrs Winser-Ramm.  </p><p>\"Serious questions need to be asked about how, if trusts are unable to accurately self-report compliance, how satisfied can we be that similar misreporting is not commonplace in other areas of self-reporting.\"</p><p>After the review found Leeds had to repay the money it had received, the trust applied to a separate fund run by NHS Resolution for maternity improvement support and was allocated £2.1m.</p><p>In a statement to the BBC, the Leeds Teaching Hospitals NHS Trust did not explain how it had erroneously self-reported that it was compliant with all the standards of the scheme.</p><p>\"We identified that we were not fully compliant with the MIS scheme,\" said Magnus Harrison, the trust's chief medical officer. </p><p>\"We have now been allocated £2.1m to support our action plan to achieve compliance, which forms part of our Maternity and Neonatal Improvement Programme.\"</p></div>"

The head of EYP, Panagiotis Kontoleon, resigned, as did the prime minister's top aide and nephew, Grigoris Dimitriadis, who was the liaison between EYP and the PM's office.</p><p>Predator had been used in attempts to entrap at least 87 people, according to the Hellenic Data Protection Authority. Twenty seven of those put under surveillance were simultaneously monitored by EYP, including serving ministers and senior military officers.</p><p>Despite criticism that the common targets by EYP and Predator implied a common strategy of surveillance, the government insisted that this was a coincidence and that no law enforcement agency had ever used Predator, the use of which was illegal in Greece at that time. A new law passed in 2022 has since legalised state security use of surveillance software under strict conditions.</p><p>But the government did not answer why the secret services had spied on the Chief of National Defence General Staff, Lieutenant General Konstantinos Floros, and Kostis Hatzidakis, then cabinet member and today vice president of the government.</p></div><figure><div><p><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20250905-110137-f27f908f49-web-2.29.1-3/grey-placeholder.png\" /><img srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/0965/live/867d19b0-9870-11f0-8ac5-61a603230ddd.jpg.webp 240w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/0965/live/867d19b0-9870-11f0-8ac5-61a603230ddd.jpg.webp 320w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/0965/live/867d19b0-9870-11f0-8ac5-61a603230ddd.jpg.webp 480w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/0965/live/867d19b0-9870-11f0-8ac5-61a603230ddd.jpg.webp 640w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/0965/live/867d19b0-9870-11f0-8ac5-61a603230ddd.jpg.webp 800w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/0965/live/867d19b0-9870-11f0-8ac5-61a603230ddd.jpg.webp 1024w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/0965/live/867d19b0-9870-11f0-8ac5-61a603230ddd.jpg.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/0965/live/867d19b0-9870-11f0-8ac5-61a603230ddd.jpg.webp\" alt=\"Getty Images The president of PASOK Greek party, Nikos Androulakis, attending the memorial service in Nicosia, Cyprus, on July 20, 2024\" /><span>Getty Images</span></p></div><p></p><figcaption>IT experts told Nikos Androulakis that his phone had been infected with spyware in 2022</figcaption><p></p></figure><div><p>In July 2024 a report by the Greek Supreme Court, seen by the BBC, concluded there was \"clearly no connection\" between Predator and government officials.</p><p>\"There is a prosecutor's report and the answers are clear. Justice has spoken. There is no doubt in what it said\", government spokesperson Pavlos Marinakis told reporters.</p><p>The BBC has repeatedly contacted Mr Marinakis for comment on this, but at time of publication has not received a response.</p><p>The four private individuals on trial in Athens on Wednesday are all facing misdemeanor charges - allegedly connected with the marketing of Predator. Two of the accused are said to have ties with state officials, but it was never seriously investigated, opposition and watchdogs said.</p><p>\"What began as a political scandal has now evolved into an institutional scandal, tainting both the judiciary and the independent authorities,\" says Thanasis Koukakis, a financial reporter who investigates corruption, and among the targets of dual surveillance – both by Predator and the secret services \"for national security reasons\".</p><p>Eliza Trintafyllou, journalist for Inside Story, has reported on the scandal since its very beginning. </p><p>\"If someone has not followed the wiretapping scandal, they would think that four individuals, on their own initiative and for their own personal reasons, tapped the phones of 87 people in Greece, using advanced spyware that is otherwise marketed exclusively to state intelligence services and law enforcement authorities worldwide.\"</p><p>\"No serving minister, judge, or military officer filed a complaint about being targeted with Predator so far. Nor were any of them called to testify as a witness,\" she said.</p></div><p></p><h2>Was the government involved?</h2><p></p><div><p>After the scandal broke out, the Greek government introduced a new law on the confidentiality of communications. </p><p>There are now more safeguards for law enforcement authorities, but at the same time the new legislation has been criticised because it effectively deprives citizens of the right to learn if they had previously been under surveillance.</p><p>In addition, the Greek government received criticism for its lack of willingness to find out who was spying on its ministers and members of the army - criticism that only mounted after authorities raided the offices of Intellexa in Athens, months after the wiretapping scandal broke out. They left empty handed.</p><p>Christos Rammos, a former senior judge and president of the Hellenic Authority for Communication Security and Privacy (ADAE) at the time the scandal broke out was a key figure in uncovering the facts behind the wiretapping. It was not an easy task and faced many obstacles on the way.</p><p>\"In Greece the political system cannot tolerate independent authorities, the so-called checks and balances on power. The wiretapping affair was a traumatic experience for our democracy,\" Rammos told the BBC. \"I was subjected to personal attacks. It was an open war.\"</p><p>The wiretapping scandal received international attention and scrutiny since one of the first victims, Nikos Androulakis, was an MEP. The European Parliament set up a special Committee of Inquiry to investigate the use of Pegasus and equivalent surveillance spyware (PEGA). </p><p>Its Rapporteur, former MEP Sophie in 't Veld, told the BBC that the Greek government had made \"every possible attempt to conceal the truth. They have, at every turn, refused cooperation.\"</p><p>\"The whole spyware thing is not something that you can see in isolation. It's not taking place in a vacuum. It's used to silence critical voices. It's used to stifle scrutiny. But, the damage has been done; it's had a chilling effect.</p><p>\"I was just now coming back from a coffee with a friend of mine who was also looking into spyware and she said, 'I cannot be sure that my phone is safe from the Greek government' - quite literally.'\"</p></div></article>"
