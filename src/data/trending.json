The BBC's source confirmed that reporting. </p></div><div><p>The reasoning for their split is unclear. </p><p>Kidman and Urban, who both grew up in Australia, have weathered ups and downs over their nearly two decades together. </p><p>They experienced highs with both stars winning and being nominated for top honours in their respective industries. Over the years, they have supported and cheered on one another, routinely appearing together at award shows and Hollywood premiers for the other. </p><p>And lows: months after their wedding, Urban checked himself into rehab for drug and alcohol addiction. Both he and Kidman have said his struggles with addiction made their bond stronger. </p><p>Kidman and several of his close friends staged an intervention that Urban said changed his life. </p><p>\"Everything was just designed, I believe, for that moment to fuse us together,\" he said in 2010 appearance on The Oprah Winfrey Show.</p><p>\"I look back now and realize Nic has taught me so much and brought so much into my life and opened my eyes in so many ways,\" he said. \"[This is] the best place I've ever been.\"</p><p>The pair were spotted together over the summer in June watching a FIFA Club World Cup match in Nashville, Tennessee. </p><p>They also appeared together in May when Urban was honoured at the Academy of Country Music Awards with the ACM Triple Crown Award. They were photographed in their seats appearing happily in love, kissing and holding hands. </p><p>The Babygirl actress was previously married to actor Tom Cruise. The pair were together for more than 10 years and also have two children together. They ended their marriage in 2001. </p></div>"

They also found the suspect's makeshift explosive devices, said James Deir, an agent of the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives.</p><p>Less than 10 minutes after the shooting, the gunman died in a shootout with police, officials said. </p><p>Investigators said on Monday that they had interviewed over 100 victims and witnesses as a part of the investigation and spent the whole night processing the scene of the crime. </p></div><p></p><h2>What do we know about the suspect? </h2><p></p><div><p>Though officials have not given a motive, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt told Fox News that Sanford was \"an individual who hated people of the Mormon faith\".</p><p>Officials have said the suspect was a former Marine who was once deployed to Iraq. </p><p>Sanford told local outlet Clarkston News that he was a sergeant in the Marines and was deployed to Fallujah in Iraq in 2007. </p><p>\"I'm excited to go,\" he told the newspaper. \"There are many changes we are making in the Middle East, we are making progress.\"</p><p>Sanford had previous arrests for a burglary and operating a vehicle while intoxicated, officials said on Monday. </p><p>Not much information is available about the suspect's political beliefs, but his Facebook profile features a photo of him in 2019 wearing what appears to be a shirt promoting the re-election of Donald Trump in 2020. </p><p>A Google Street View image of a property linked to Sanford also appears to show a pro-Trump sign outside of the house. </p><p>Sanford also appeared to be a father of a son who had serious health issues, according to posts from his family and a fundraising page. </p><p>Sanford is from a suburb of Flint of about 30,000 people, just a few miles away from Grand Blanc Township. </p></div></article>"

We couldn't really see those children.\" </p><p>Many children are still living with long Covid, or the lifelong consequences of not being able to access the right support, the inquiry heard.</p><p>Grace, from Wales, said she struggled to get medical help for her newborn son for multiple ear infections during the pandemic. </p><p>He was only able to meet a hearing specialist years later, by which point Grace was told that he was partially deaf as a result.</p><p>\"He's now four-and-a-half and it was only a year ago that we managed to get him a hearing appointment,\" she said. </p><p>\"That could've been picked up a lot earlier if it was easier to get seen.\"</p><p>The government has said it is committed to learning lessons from the inquiry. The session looking into the impact on children and young people is expected to last four weeks. </p><p><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/sounds/brand/p0g0q1f6\"><b>The Covid Inquiry Podcast is available on BBC Sounds</b></a></p></div>"

    "body": "<div><div><p>9 hours ago</p></div><p><span><p><span>Faisal Islam</span><span>Economics editor</span></p></span></p></div><div><p>In Liverpool Rachel Reeves seemed to be floating a pre-emptive argument ahead of possible tax rises in her November Budget.</p><p>The key line in the chancellor's speech in relation to the Budget was her linking of tough decisions \"in coming months\" to global headwinds and a critical reassessment of the long-term productivity performance of the UK economy, about to be delivered by the Office for Budget Responsibility.</p><p>\"We will face further tests, with choices to come, made all the harder by harsh global headwinds and long-term damage to the economy, which is becoming ever clearer,\" she said.</p><p>This prepares the government's argument if there does need to be further tax rises, even significant ones at the Budget. </p><p>Firstly, they will blame the broad global economic backdrop, of trade wars, actual wars and rising government interest rates. \"The world has changed,\" the chancellor told the Today programme.</p><p>Secondly, the OBR's reassessment of the UK's long-term economic trends is revealing \"ever clearer\" evidence of \"long-term damage\" which she will blame on the record of her predecessors.</p><ul><li><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cy041perldwo\">Reeves warns of harder choices to come as she hints at tax rises</a></li><li><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cj4w44w42j5o\">When is the Budget and what might be in it?</a></li></ul><p>The other notable call was for \"responsible management of public finances\" against opposition voices and those in her own party.</p><p>Other than that, this was relatively light on policies. The policies that most of the country are the most interested in - what is in the Budget - have not been nailed down, and depend on the ping pong about to start with the OBR over its forecasting process.</p><p>It is on that, where we did get new news today. The chancellor confirmed publicly that she agreed with the International Monetary Fund about changing the fiscal dance that has created non-stop speculation about tax changes. </p><p>The OBR forecast by law has to happen twice a year, but that could now only happen in full once a year. There are various options. This is a tacit admission that after whatever emerges from the Budget, everyone would benefit from a period of stability, and that has not been the case over the past year.</p><p>Elsewhere she repeated the idea that the election promises not to increase the main tax rates were still in place. When asked if VAT could rise, she said: \"The manifesto commitments stand.\" </p><p>This appears to connect the commitments to a state of the world that could change. As the Chief Secretary to the PM Darren Jones said: \"The manifesto commitments stand today.\"</p><p>Those manifesto commitments are clearly under pressure, if the OBR's calculations go against the Treasury. Her interpretation of how flexible they are was revealing. </p><p>She wants to protect pay packets and \"not put up the prices in shops\". That would appear to rule out a straightforward rise in the rate of VAT, which would directly raise bills. </p><p>There are many other options, depending on the size of the gap - to be revealed to her by the OBR this week - from scrapping some tax breaks and allowances, especially on housing and pensions, to extending the freeze on tax thresholds.</p><p>The changes made by the OBR to the UK's underlying rate of growth could add considerably to the gap in the public finances Reeves has to bridge in the Budget. The draft details will be presented to her on Friday.</p><p>It is then and only then that the real work of translating a series of tax proposals into a Budget starts in earnest. </p><p>The government will also seek to persuade the OBR that its policy moves, from infrastructure plans, to closer ties with Europe, can help long-term growth. </p><p>Today was about leaving some options open, at a tricky time. The extent of tax rises, and who gets hit, is still very much up for grabs.</p></div>"

Indian airlines have placed orders for some 1,900 new aircraft, a thousand of which are expected to be delivered in the next five years, making such infrastructure critically important to accommodate this new fleet.</p><p>Adani says NMIA will be India's first fully digital airport that's been \"designed and developed specifically to become a hub airport\" with advanced technology for check-in, security, baggage and boarding drastically reducing turnaround times and facilitating easy transfers.</p><p>It has already announced a partnership with India's largest and newest carriers, Indigo and Akasa Airlines, who are launching new routes. And Air India has committed to flying to 15 cities from the airport, gradually scaling up operations, including flights to international destinations.</p><p>Given how starved Mumbai's current airport is for capacity, analysts expect strong uptake for NMIA's parking slots from airlines looking to launch new routes.</p><p>But major challenges are expected as operations commence in the coming months.</p></div><figure><div><p><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20250919-090805-05e5ba0164-web-2.30.1-2/grey-placeholder.png\" /><img srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/1f98/live/162766a0-9ae3-11f0-8ee5-3b441e09ef17.jpg.webp 240w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/1f98/live/162766a0-9ae3-11f0-8ee5-3b441e09ef17.jpg.webp 320w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/1f98/live/162766a0-9ae3-11f0-8ee5-3b441e09ef17.jpg.webp 480w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/1f98/live/162766a0-9ae3-11f0-8ee5-3b441e09ef17.jpg.webp 640w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/1f98/live/162766a0-9ae3-11f0-8ee5-3b441e09ef17.jpg.webp 800w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/1f98/live/162766a0-9ae3-11f0-8ee5-3b441e09ef17.jpg.webp 1024w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/1f98/live/162766a0-9ae3-11f0-8ee5-3b441e09ef17.jpg.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/1f98/live/162766a0-9ae3-11f0-8ee5-3b441e09ef17.jpg.webp\" alt=\"Adani Airport Holdings Limited The image shows the newly constructed runways at NMIA on an overcast, slightly cloudy day. \" /><span>Adani Airport Holdings Limited</span></p></div><p></p><figcaption>NMIA will operate two parallel runways </figcaption><p></p></figure><div><p>Given how far the airport is, its location could be a significant inconvenience to passengers - both when taking flights to and from NMIA, and especially when using it for connecting flights.</p><p>It can easily take between two and three hours to reach the airport from certain suburbs of Mumbai. </p><p>A direct 20-minute metro line between the old and the new airports is likely to become a reality only after a few years.

Our contact frisking at the airport takes significantly more time than other airports, which have transitioned to body scanners,\" Mr Awtaney adds.</p><p>Mr Bansal agrees that a lot of this will need to fall in place before Mumbai's aviation profile is raised to global standards. </p><p>A change in regulation, he says, will also need to be accompanied by airlines' willingness to expand their choice of long-haul destinations. Carriers will also have to optimise their fleet strategy and connections to be able to leverage the city's strategic location advantage between Europe, the US and Asia.</p><p>For now, NMIA solves the city's immediate problem - acute air traffic congestion.</p><p>It will also serve as a larger catchment area, which could extend all the way to the neighbouring Pune city, a major IT and education hub.</p><p>\"Some of the major cities around the globe, such as New York, London, Dubai, and Tokyo, all operate with two to three airports. Mumbai will join this select club,\" says Mr Awtaney.</p><p>And so will Delhi, where a third airport - Jewar - is all set to open in the coming months, to serve the capital's satellite areas.</p><p> <i>Follow BBC News India on </i><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.instagram.com/bbcnewsindia/\"><i>Instagram</i></a><i>, </i><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.youtube.com/@bbcnewsindia/featured\"><i>YouTube,</i></a><i> </i><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://x.com/BBCIndia\"><i>X</i></a><i> and </i><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.facebook.com/bbcindia/\"><i>Facebook</i></a><i>.</i></p></div></article>"

The idea is as ludicrous as me checking with the boss I had when I was twenty-one for what opinions I should hold these days.\"</p><p>She said it had been, however, \"hard to shake a certain protectiveness\" after knowing someone since they were 10.</p><p>\"Until quite recently, I hadn't managed to throw off the memory of children who needed to be gently coaxed through their dialogue in a big scary film studio.\"</p><p>The author said the \"turning point\" in her feelings came in 2022 when Watson appeared to aim a subtle dig at Rowling on stage at the Bafta Awards.</p><p>Host Rebel Wilson introduced Watson by saying: \"She's proud to call herself a feminist, but we all know she's a witch.\" <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TD-vioiM2BU\">Watson responded</a> that she was \"here for ALL of the witches\", which was widely interpreted as a statement of support for the trans community. Many interpreted her as then mouthing \"bar one\", although it's not clear, and she may have actually said \"by the way\".</p><p>Rowling said that moment had \"a postscript that hurt far more than the speech itself\", when Watson sent a note, despite having her phone number. The note had a single line saying, \"I'm so sorry for what you're going through\", Rowling said.</p><p>\"This was back when the death, rape and torture threats against me were at their peak, at a time when my personal security measures had had to be tightened considerably and I was constantly worried for my family's safety,\" the author said.</p><p>\"Emma had just publicly poured more petrol on the flames, yet thought a one line expression of concern from her would reassure me of her fundamental sympathy and kindness.\"</p></div><div><p>Rowling went on to suggest that Watson was \"never likely to need\" to use the types of single-sex spaces she has campaigned against trans people having access to, such as changing rooms and public toilets.</p><p>\"I wasn't a multimillionaire at fourteen. I lived in poverty while writing the book that made Emma famous,\" she added.</p><p>\"I therefore understand from my own life experience what the trashing of women's rights in which Emma has so enthusiastically participated means to women and girls without her privileges.\"</p><p>The writer added that Watson's recent declaratons of love marked a \"change of tack I suspect she's adopted because she's noticed full-throated condemnation of me is no longer quite as fashionable as it was\".</p><p>Rowling concluded: \"Adults can't expect to cosy up to an activist movement that regularly calls for a friend's assassination, then assert their right to the former friend's love, as though the friend was in fact their mother.</p><p>\"Emma is rightly free to disagree with me and indeed to discuss her feelings about me in public - but I have the same right, and I've finally decided to exercise it.\"</p><p>BBC News has approached Watson's representatives for comment.</p></div><p></p><h2>'I can love her, I can know she loved me'</h2><p></p><div><p>Watson was one of several stars of the Potter films who spoke out against Rowling's views in 2020, posting on social media at the time: \"Trans people are who they say they are and deserve to live their lives without being constantly questioned or told they aren't who they say they are.\"</p><p>In last week's interview, Watson said her previous relationship with Rowling meant she was still able to \"treasure Jo\".</p><p>The actress also praised Rowling for the \"kindness and words of encouragement\" she gave when she was growing up, and for the opportunity to play a character like Hermione.</p><p>\"There's just no world in which I could ever cancel her out, or cancel that out, for anything,\" Watson said. \"It has to remain true. It is true.</p><p>\"I just don't know what else to do other than hold these two seemingly incompatible things together at the same time and just hope maybe they will one day resolve or co-join themselves, and maybe accept that they never will, but that they can both still be true.\"</p></div></article>"
