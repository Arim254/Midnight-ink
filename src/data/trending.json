They didn't like it and that's going to be our goal, to pacify the crowd. </p><p>\"I don't think it's going to be easy. I don't think we should expect to pacify the crowd, that might not be possible. We've just got to be resilient as a team. </p><p>\"But Medinah proves it's possible.\"</p><p>And he believes the pressure and expectation from the home fans might be as tough for the US players to deal with.</p><p>\"It's about not letting the environment affect us,\" he said. </p><p>\"But none of us, even the Americans, will have played in that before. Obviously it will be more pro for them but at the same time it's going to be different - so if we can deal with it we've got an awesome chance to win.\"</p></div><div><figure><p><span><picture><source srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/240/cpsprodpb/228d/live/b3ab61f0-9549-11f0-9cf6-cbf3e73ce2b9.jpg.webp 240w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/320/cpsprodpb/228d/live/b3ab61f0-9549-11f0-9cf6-cbf3e73ce2b9.jpg.webp 320w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/480/cpsprodpb/228d/live/b3ab61f0-9549-11f0-9cf6-cbf3e73ce2b9.jpg.webp 480w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/624/cpsprodpb/228d/live/b3ab61f0-9549-11f0-9cf6-cbf3e73ce2b9.jpg.webp 624w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/800/cpsprodpb/228d/live/b3ab61f0-9549-11f0-9cf6-cbf3e73ce2b9.jpg.webp 800w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/976/cpsprodpb/228d/live/b3ab61f0-9549-11f0-9cf6-cbf3e73ce2b9.jpg.webp 976w\" type=\"image/webp\"></source><img alt=\"European Ryder Cup fans in among US supporters at Whistling Straits in 2021\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/1920/cpsprodpb/228d/live/b3ab61f0-9549-11f0-9cf6-cbf3e73ce2b9.jpg\" srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/240/cpsprodpb/228d/live/b3ab61f0-9549-11f0-9cf6-cbf3e73ce2b9.jpg 240w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/320/cpsprodpb/228d/live/b3ab61f0-9549-11f0-9cf6-cbf3e73ce2b9.jpg 320w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/480/cpsprodpb/228d/live/b3ab61f0-9549-11f0-9cf6-cbf3e73ce2b9.jpg 480w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/624/cpsprodpb/228d/live/b3ab61f0-9549-11f0-9cf6-cbf3e73ce2b9.jpg 624w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/800/cpsprodpb/228d/live/b3ab61f0-9549-11f0-9cf6-cbf3e73ce2b9.jpg 800w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/976/cpsprodpb/228d/live/b3ab61f0-9549-11f0-9cf6-cbf3e73ce2b9.jpg 976w\" /></picture></span><span><span>Image source, </span>Getty Images</span></p><figcaption><span>Image caption, </span><p>Nick Faldo says the players will be relying on the European fans at Bethpage to make themselves heard among the Americans</p></figcaption></figure></div><p></p><h2 id=\"Keeping-Donald-as-captain\"><span>Keeping Donald as captain</span></h2><p></p><div><p>The fans chanting \"two more years\" towards Donald at Marco Simone in Rome was one thing, but the players joining in was the rubber stamp he needed to continue.</p><p>Not since the days of Tony Jacklin through the 1980s and Bernard Gallacher in the early 1990s has the European captaincy been anything more than a one and out deal.</p><p>But Donald has the continent's golden touch. Four wins out of four as a player - with two of those on American soil. One out of one as skipper.</p><p>Crucially, he was on the last team to win away, and set the tone for Sunday's singles in 2012 by going out first and defeating Bubba Watson to spark the record turnaround from 10-6 down.</p><p>And that experience and nous will be needed to deal with some of the feistiest fans in American sport and home players desperate to regain the trophy.</p><p>\"This is a different challenge,\" he said. \"I am aware we have lost three of the past four away Ryder Cups by significant margins. Some of our advantages from Rome are certainly not advantages anymore.</p><p>\"A lot of my thinking revolves around crowd management and how we react as a team.</p><p>\"In terms of communication, to get my messaging across, that process started 15 months ago. Hopefully they will see some good results.\"</p><p>Rose, who is seeking a fifth Ryder Cup win, was a team-mate of Donald's in 2012. </p><p>The Englishman told BBC South: \"Luke has a plan. The messaging has been consistent. He's not adding to the noise and keeping it as simple as possible for us. </p><p>\"I haven't felt like anything going differently and that's probably the genius of what Luke's been doing.\"</p></div><p></p><h2 id=\"Stability-is-key\"><span>Stability is key</span></h2><p></p><div><p>This is the 45th edition of the biennial contest and the visitors have made fewer alterations to their team than in any previous contest in the 98-year history of the event.</p><p>As Europe, the next fewest number of changes was three in 1985, 1987 and 2006 - and all three ended in victories.</p><p>Dane Rasmus Hojgaard, who was embedded with the team in Rome, is the solitary change, replacing his twin brother Nicolai, having qualified for his debut through the ranking system.</p><p>Montgomerie, who led the side to victory in 2010 and won five out of eight as a player, joked on BBC Radio 5 Live's Ryder Cup preview programme: \"With all due respect Rasmus and Nicolai are the same person really. They shared the same egg, so we have the same team and that's huge.\"</p><p>With Donald looking to emulate Jacklin as the only captain to win home and away matches and cement his place alongside Europe's greats, he opted not to include any rookies in his six selections.</p><p>\"If I was coming into a home Ryder Cup I'd be comfortable with a few rookies, next generation coming through, which is what happened in Rome,\" said Rose.</p><p>\"There is still tons of pressure, don't get me wrong, but I'm really happy the boys have experienced a Ryder Cup and they know what to expect in terms of the rhythm and flow of the week and the emotion.\"</p><p>And you can understand Donald's thinking, of seeking to take a settled community into what Montgomerie has called a \"cauldron\".</p><p>\"It's important we have a good amount of experience in that team room with people that have dealt with it,\" said Donald.</p><p>Faldo, who amassed 25 points from 11 appearances, second only to Sergio Garcia's 28.5 - added: \"Your big guys have got to do the heavy lifting. </p><p>\"You need half the team playing great, winning the point and hope one or two others have a great period. If you can get close to 10 points out of the first two days, you only need four out of 12 in the singles. That's the gameplan.\"</p><p>Faldo was talking about the likes of Rory McIlroy, Tommy Fleetwood, Jon Rahm, Tyrrell Hatton and Rose, who have all won more than 50% of the points they have contested.</p><p>Major winners McIlroy (18 points) and Rose (15.5) also bring seasoned know-how, having been in the victorious 2012 side alongside Donald.</p><p>Fleetwood broke his PGA Tour duck by winning the season-ending Tour Championship last month, while Rahm was crowned LIV Golf's individual player of the year for a second time. </p><p>Hatton's major performances meant he claimed an automatic place despite also playing on the Saudi circuit and having limited qualification opportunities.</p><p>Robert MacIntyre, an inspired wildcard pick in Rome who has qualified this time round, could be added to that quintet given his performances since then.</p><p>After going unbeaten on his Ryder Cup debut, he has won the Scottish and Canadian Open titles - as well as finishing runner-up at the US Open in June.</p><p>Rahm needed a wildcard pick, as did Viktor Hovland and Ludvig Aberg, who impressed as a pairing in Rome with two wins from three matches.</p><p>Donald has also put his faith in Shane Lowry and Sepp Straka - who won one and lost one of their two outings together in 2023 - and Matt Fitzpatrick, despite his poor record of one point in three appearances, two of which were heavy away defeats in 2016 and 2021. </p><p>\"They've had a dry run and made it work, they know the pairings,\" said Europe's first Ryder Cup-winning captain Jacklin.</p><p>\"You don't go in there complacent. The antennae is up and you're looking for weakness but I can't see anything other than a European win.\"</p></div><p></p><h2 id=\"Scheffler-aside-there-is-nobody-to-fear\"><span>'Scheffler aside, there is nobody to fear'</span></h2><p></p><div><figure><p><span><picture><source srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/240/cpsprodpb/9129/live/614bb940-9545-11f0-a49e-490ea541d65b.jpg.webp 240w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/320/cpsprodpb/9129/live/614bb940-9545-11f0-a49e-490ea541d65b.jpg.webp 320w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/480/cpsprodpb/9129/live/614bb940-9545-11f0-a49e-490ea541d65b.jpg.webp 480w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/624/cpsprodpb/9129/live/614bb940-9545-11f0-a49e-490ea541d65b.jpg.webp 624w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/800/cpsprodpb/9129/live/614bb940-9545-11f0-a49e-490ea541d65b.jpg.webp 800w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/976/cpsprodpb/9129/live/614bb940-9545-11f0-a49e-490ea541d65b.jpg.webp 976w\" type=\"image/webp\"></source><img alt=\"Bryson DeChambeau and Scottie Scheffler chest bump during their victory over Tommy Fleetwood and Viktor Hovland at Whistling Straits in 2021.\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/3840/cpsprodpb/9129/live/614bb940-9545-11f0-a49e-490ea541d65b.jpg\" srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/240/cpsprodpb/9129/live/614bb940-9545-11f0-a49e-490ea541d65b.jpg 240w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/320/cpsprodpb/9129/live/614bb940-9545-11f0-a49e-490ea541d65b.jpg 320w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/480/cpsprodpb/9129/live/614bb940-9545-11f0-a49e-490ea541d65b.jpg 480w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/624/cpsprodpb/9129/live/614bb940-9545-11f0-a49e-490ea541d65b.jpg 624w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/800/cpsprodpb/9129/live/614bb940-9545-11f0-a49e-490ea541d65b.jpg 800w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/976/cpsprodpb/9129/live/614bb940-9545-11f0-a49e-490ea541d65b.jpg 976w\" /></picture></span><span><span>Image source, </span>Getty Images</span></p><figcaption><span>Image caption, </span><p>DeChambeau and Scheffler each won 2½ points in 2021 at Whistling Straits</p></figcaption></figure></div><div><p>The American team is headed by the game's standout talent in Scottie Scheffler.

The only time that aid agencies and commercial shippers were able to get in adequate supplies was during the ceasefire that started on 19 January this year. That stopped abruptly when Israel imposed a total blockade on 2 March and two weeks later went back to war.</p><p>The global body that assesses food emergencies, the IPC, said in its most recent report in August that the famine had reached Gaza City. Israel's prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu says there is no famine in Gaza, rejecting the overwhelming evidence presented by the IPC as an \"outright lie\". The IPC is globally respected as an impartial and expert body. Netanyahu says Israel is not responsible for any \"shortages\".</p><p>He blames ineptitude at UN agencies in Gaza and has repeatedly accused the UN of doing nothing about the systematic theft of food by Hamas. The UN denies his allegations, arguing that its consignments are bar-coded and traceable. Israel, it says, has never provided evidence of the allegations of systematic theft, despite repeated UN requests.</p></div><div><ul><li><b>Outside of the UK, you can </b><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IA8YL_Datm0\"><b>watch on YouTube</b></a></li></ul></div><div><p>Famine is why Palestinians in Gaza, many of them young men like Abdullah, are prepared to risk their lives at the GHF sites to get food.</p><p>It is nearly two years since Hamas killed 1,195 people in southern Israel and took 251 hostages. Forty-eight Israelis are still in Gaza. Perhaps 20 of them are thought to be alive. It remains Israel's biggest trauma since its independence in 1948.</p><p>Israel's response has been to inflict the biggest trauma Palestinians have suffered in the same nearly eight decades. The Israelis continue to argue they are acting in self defence in Gaza - a narrow strip of land that is now in ruins, and has seen the killing by Israel of at least 65,000 people, according to the Hamas-run health ministry, including more than 18,000 children. Israel rejects these figures but they are generally considered reliable by international organisations.</p><p>Abdullah was a bright young man. Sticky notes above his desk display reminders to himself to aim for 95% in his exams. Judging by the photos his father provides, he dressed smartly, with a sharp haircut and an expectant smile. He must have seen possibilities ahead in his life, even in Gaza, a place where life was hard even before the war. Now it is reduced to a struggle to survive Israeli attacks and the famine.</p></div><figure><div><p><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20250905-110137-f27f908f49-web-2.29.1-3/grey-placeholder.png\" /><img srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/61af/live/81db2590-9894-11f0-af62-91486a511a31.jpg.webp 240w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/61af/live/81db2590-9894-11f0-af62-91486a511a31.jpg.webp 320w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/61af/live/81db2590-9894-11f0-af62-91486a511a31.jpg.webp 480w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/61af/live/81db2590-9894-11f0-af62-91486a511a31.jpg.webp 640w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/61af/live/81db2590-9894-11f0-af62-91486a511a31.jpg.webp 800w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/61af/live/81db2590-9894-11f0-af62-91486a511a31.jpg.webp 1024w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/61af/live/81db2590-9894-11f0-af62-91486a511a31.jpg.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/61af/live/81db2590-9894-11f0-af62-91486a511a31.jpg.webp\" alt=\"Aerial image of where Abdullah was shot and killed in Gaza, showing where shots were fired from the direction of an IDF position, and also where aid seekers came under fire. Image copyright: Planet Labs PLC, 3 Aug 2025\" /></p></div></figure><div><p>Abdullah's neighbour, Moaaz, a friend since childhood took up the story of what happened the day he died. They went together to GHF site 4, the only one in the centre of Gaza, following the instructions of IDF soldiers about the correct route to take. To get ahead in the deadly race for food, many Palestinians arrive at the GHF sites long before dawn. Moaaz and Abdullah were waiting near a ruined house less than 500 metres from the site.</p><p>Then Abdullah said he had to deal with a call of nature, and moved, Moaaz says, about 30 metres away. That was when he was shot dead. Moaaz said he ran through heavy fire to get to his friend. He lived around 10 more minutes.</p><p>Diaa told us about his son, and how hard it is to live and stay alive in Gaza.</p><p>\"In Gaza we are a peaceful people. Abdullah was a young man like any other. May God have mercy on him. He didn't get the chance to fulfil any of his dreams.\"</p></div><p></p><figcaption>Abdullah's friend describes the moment the 19-year-old was shot dead</figcaption><p></p><div><p>We asked the IDF specifically about the death of Abdullah. It did not respond but told us it \"does not deliberately fire at innocent civilians\". GHF's lawyers say its security contractors do not open fire either. They say they are not aware of any credibly documented instance of their ever doing so - and that no-one has been shot dead at a GHF site, or within sight of one.</p><p>Abdullah's story comes from the film that we have just broadcast, called Gaza: Dying for Food, produced by Panorama and BBC Eye.  It is an investigation into hunger in Gaza, and the killing around the food distribution sites run by the GHF. Dying for Food looks at just one part of Gaza's humanitarian catastrophe. We have established how so many Palestinians are being killed seeking aid. It is a worthy subject for a half-hour television film. A comprehensive account from every angle would need a series.</p><p>Reporting and producing the film has been a considerable challenge. That is because Israel does not permit the BBC, or any other news organisation, to send teams into Gaza to report freely. Palestinian journalists inside Gaza have done heroic work, without which we would know much less about what has been happening there in the past two years. According to the UN Human Rights Office, at least 248 of them have been killed by Israel.</p><p>On Dying for Food I was the reporter, the public face of a big team of journalists. I wrote the script, but I did not interview Diaa or Moaaz about the killing of Abdullah. I wasn't present when the filming took place of the dead and dying in hospital emergency departments, of miles of rubble and Palestinians desperate to grab some food while the IDF and armed American security men working for GHF were said to have opened fire. I was able to talk to the interviewees who weren't in Gaza, either face to face or via video.</p><p>It is not the way the BBC, or any other group of journalists and film makers would choose to work. A fundamental rule of journalism is to narrow the distance between the reporter and the story. It was drummed into me when I was a BBC trainee journalist assigned to the Belfast newsroom during the Troubles in the winter of 1984-85. An acerbic news editor, using a tone that might get him into trouble these days, told me to leave the building to use my own eyes and ears, and to talk to people.</p></div><figure><div><p><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20250905-110137-f27f908f49-web-2.29.1-3/grey-placeholder.png\" /><img srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/b91e/live/fa1900d0-989f-11f0-af62-91486a511a31.jpg.webp 240w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/b91e/live/fa1900d0-989f-11f0-af62-91486a511a31.jpg.webp 320w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/b91e/live/fa1900d0-989f-11f0-af62-91486a511a31.jpg.webp 480w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/b91e/live/fa1900d0-989f-11f0-af62-91486a511a31.jpg.webp 640w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/b91e/live/fa1900d0-989f-11f0-af62-91486a511a31.jpg.webp 800w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/b91e/live/fa1900d0-989f-11f0-af62-91486a511a31.jpg.webp 1024w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/b91e/live/fa1900d0-989f-11f0-af62-91486a511a31.jpg.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/b91e/live/fa1900d0-989f-11f0-af62-91486a511a31.jpg.webp\" alt=\"Tawfik pictured sitting down.

The IDF allows some news teams short and heavily supervised visits. I have done one, for about three or four hours, in the first month of the war. It let me see the destruction first hand, and to talk to soldiers. </p><p>One IDF officer started by telling me that they worked hard to safeguard the lives of noncombatants. Even in the first few weeks of the war, Israel was being accused of ignoring its legal obligations to protect civilians. Then the officer trailed off, and in disgust told me that all the Palestinians were guilty, not just the Hamas units that had led the 7 October attacks. If they weren't guilty, he said, they would have found a way to overthrow Hamas.</p><p>To get round Israel's ban on our entry into Gaza, we commission local freelancers who are still able to operate on the ground. Our team had long conversations with them about where to film, who to interview and what to ask. We needed to know about the backgrounds and relevance to the story of potential interviewees and where filming would be an acceptable risk to take in a warzone where nowhere is safe.</p><p>From a distance, BBC journalists directed the teams we used in Gaza. We reviewed and verified the material we received, examining closely the data embedded in videos that shows when and where it was shot. Just communicating with people in Gaza is hard. Digital connections are patchy. It took several days for the story of Abdullah to be sent to London after it was filmed. </p><p>Connectivity out of Gaza is often weak or non-existent, as Israel has bombed mobile phone masts and internet hubs. The current Israeli offensive in Gaza made movement difficult and highly dangerous. One of the filmmakers we worked with in Gaza City went quiet for a few days while they moved their family somewhere they hoped might be safer.</p><p>We also asked for permission to film at the GHF sites but were refused.</p><p>Reporting from a distance is not the way we want to work. But given the constraints imposed by Israel, we believe we have found the best obtainable way to tell the story of how Gazans live and die.</p></div><figure><div><p><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20250905-110137-f27f908f49-web-2.29.1-3/grey-placeholder.png\" /><img srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/be06/live/b1716bb0-9863-11f0-858a-a904eacbef23.jpg.webp 240w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/be06/live/b1716bb0-9863-11f0-858a-a904eacbef23.jpg.webp 320w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/be06/live/b1716bb0-9863-11f0-858a-a904eacbef23.jpg.webp 480w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/be06/live/b1716bb0-9863-11f0-858a-a904eacbef23.jpg.webp 640w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/be06/live/b1716bb0-9863-11f0-858a-a904eacbef23.jpg.webp 800w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/be06/live/b1716bb0-9863-11f0-858a-a904eacbef23.jpg.webp 1024w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/be06/live/b1716bb0-9863-11f0-858a-a904eacbef23.jpg.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/be06/live/b1716bb0-9863-11f0-858a-a904eacbef23.jpg.webp\" alt=\"Picture of Reem, who is looking to the side of the camera.

He was also looking for food, more plentiful then but still dangerous to venture out to get it as Israel invaded and pummelled Gaza. </p><p>She was interviewed in a tent in Gaza City. We have not been able to contact her in the past week or so. We believe Reem might have taken her two children south from Gaza City to escape the ferocious offensive Israel has launched to capture the area. If so, it would be the sixth time they have been displaced. Most of Gaza's more than two million civilians have been displaced many times.</p><p>One way of getting information when physically you are not there to see it for yourself is to talk to witnesses. I interviewed an NHS doctor just back from Gaza called Tawfik Omar, who is a vascular surgeon in Coventry. Tawfik is from Egypt and spoke at length to patients and their families in Gaza. Vascular surgeons see a lot of blood. Tawfik was shocked in Gaza by an overpowering smell of blood in hospitals packed with the dead and dying who had been shot near aid sites.</p><p>\"The local people coming from the GHF points,\" he told me, \"are saying clearly that we can see the GHF security guards or the IDF personnel shooting directly at the crowds.\"</p><p>Dying for Food features two whistleblowers, who didn't want to be identified. One was a lorry driver for a GHF logistics subcontractor. We called him \"John\" and hid his identity because he is worried that his safety might be compromised if it was known that he had spoken out. He told me that another potential whistleblower had been silenced by threats from former colleagues.</p><p>There are only three GHF aid points, compared to 400 that existed when the UN was distributing aid. John told us they felt like military bases on the front line, not places where humanitarian aid was given to those who need it. He told us that every night he did his work, it was with the background of heavy gunfire. John was so shocked by what he saw that he secretly recorded videos with his mobile.</p></div><p></p><figcaption>Watch: Whistleblower's secret recordings of gunfire near GHF aid sites</figcaption><p></p><div><p>His videos were part of the material we used to establish a pattern of the IDF's use of live fire to control crowds, an intrinsically lethal technique. On a day when more than 20 people were killed near the single GHF aid site in central Gaza, we were able to use John's video taken that night to help establish what was happening.</p><p>It shows heavy fire coming from an IDF position just behind site four. The bullets were hitting an area where we established that hungry people, in their thousands, would often gather near a bridge over a dried-up river bed that leads to the entrance of the site.</p><p>Even though we were not physically in Gaza, our team analysed John's videos (and many others) using open-source intelligence, a way to check events and corroborate testimony by using the latest techniques and software to sort through the wealth of data and video that is available online. We spoke to five ballistics experts, and used software that analyses the sound of shooting on videos, to help establish the trajectory of bullets.</p><p>We used satellite pictures, which are no longer the sole preserve of intelligence agencies, and matched the detail they showed with the videos. Satellite pictures are available commercially and are especially valuable in the Gaza Strip, which straddles a 40-km (25-mile) stretch of the eastern Mediterranean coast where clouds are rare.</p><p>Videos shot on mobiles carry metadata, which includes the digital record of the time, date and place where they were shot. We know the dates of our whistleblower's videos, but we have not revealed them to help John stay anonymous.</p><p>The data on the number of deaths at GHF sites comes from a body called Armed Conflict Location and Event Data (ACLED). It collects and analyses data from warzones and is funded, among others, by the United Nations, the European Union, the US and European countries including the UK.</p><p>ACLED's data shows that since the GHF began its operations, at least 1,300 Palestinians have been killed at, or around, its sites, mostly by IDF fire. Across Gaza, Palestinians were being killed seeking aid in the year before GHF arrived at an average rate of 30 per month. Since its sites opened, that has risen to 500.</p><p>The IDF denies the killing. It told us that it is \"not aware of hundreds of fatalities caused by… [its] …forces at distribution points.\" It says these figures are \"inflated and false\".</p></div><figure><div><p><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20250905-110137-f27f908f49-web-2.29.1-3/grey-placeholder.png\" /><img srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/1ad8/live/02913500-98a2-11f0-af62-91486a511a31.jpg.webp 240w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/1ad8/live/02913500-98a2-11f0-af62-91486a511a31.jpg.webp 320w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/1ad8/live/02913500-98a2-11f0-af62-91486a511a31.jpg.webp 480w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/1ad8/live/02913500-98a2-11f0-af62-91486a511a31.jpg.webp 640w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/1ad8/live/02913500-98a2-11f0-af62-91486a511a31.jpg.webp 800w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/1ad8/live/02913500-98a2-11f0-af62-91486a511a31.jpg.webp 1024w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/1ad8/live/02913500-98a2-11f0-af62-91486a511a31.jpg.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/1ad8/live/02913500-98a2-11f0-af62-91486a511a31.jpg.webp\" alt=\"Reuters Picture showing people carrying aid away from a GHF food distribution site in Gaza.

In the red one, it's too close, it is too dangerous, and then you use lethal force.\"</p><p>Michael told me how concerned he was that IDF soldiers communicated their wishes to thousands of Palestinians by firing live bullets.</p><p>\"Yes, it concerned me a lot. Because the moment they won't listen to the shots, they'll start running at us, and then we need to decide what we're doing with a thousand people on their way to the base.\"</p><p>Michael said the GHF aid operation was chaotic and badly planned.

Peace is not even a distant dream. The war that started with the attacks led by Hamas on 7 October 2023 is as significant a moment in the history of the conflict as the ones in 1948, when Israel fought and won its independence, and 1967, when it captured and occupied the West Bank, including East Jerusalem and the Gaza Strip, giving it full control of the land.</p><p>The Gaza war has stripped the conflict to its essentials. European allies that gave Israel strong support after 7 October 2023, have decided that the only way to try to offer a better way ahead than perpetual war is to recognise an independent Palestine, which the UK, France and others have done this week at the UN General Assembly in New York.</p><p>Israel and its supporters, led by the US, have condemned the move as a reward for Hamas terrorism. The counter argument to that is that the best way of ending armed attacks on Israelis is to create the conditions for Palestinian independence and allow Palestinians to set up a state in Gaza, the West Bank, including a capital in East Jerusalem. The occupation of Palestinian land is illegal under international law according to the International Court of Justice.</p><p>The determined opposition of Israel, backed by the US, makes the vision of a Palestinian state remote. So does the presence of more than 700,000 Jewish settlers in the West Bank, including East Jerusalem, on land the UK and others now call the state of Palestine. But Britain's Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer and France's President Emmanuel Macron argue they have to act now to try to keep alive the hope of peace through the two-state solution. If Israel does not accept Palestinian independence, it will find itself even more isolated for ruling over millions of people and denying them political rights.</p><p>The current offensive is aimed at forcing up to one million people out of Gaza City. It suits the plan pushed by Benjamin Netanyahu's hardline allies to seize the Gaza Strip for Jewish settlers - and force Palestinians out.  One extremist leader in the Israeli cabinet predicted a real estate bonanza.</p><p>There is strong evidence of war crimes on both sides.  Hamas committed war crimes when it broke through Israel's border defences two years ago, and in the months that followed when it still had the capacity to fire barrages of missiles at Israeli towns. Holding hostages in appalling conditions and threatening their lives is also a crime.</p><p>Israel faces accusations of a genocidal attack on Gaza's Palestinians, not just with bullets and high explosive, but by using food as a weapon of war. The IPC, the world body that assesses food emergencies, says famine caused by the Israeli blockade of Gaza is present and spreading. If it is proved that Israel is committing acts with the intent to destroy Gaza's Palestinians as a group, in whole or in part, then genocide will be added to the list of war crimes that the whistleblower John - and many others - say that they have witnessed.</p><p>Israel says it has the most moral army in the world, has not committed war crimes, and is fighting a just war in the defence of its citizens. Benjamin Netanyahu insists the current offensive aimed at capturing Gaza City will deliver the elusive total victory over Hamas that he has promised repeatedly. He also insists it will rescue the Israeli hostages still in Gaza.</p><p>The UK says the IDF assault on Gaza is utterly reckless and appalling. The Foreign Secretary, Yvette Cooper, posted: \"It will only bring more bloodshed, kill more innocent civilians and endanger the remaining hostages. We need an immediate ceasefire, all hostages released, unrestricted humanitarian aid and a path to lasting peace.\"</p><p>When, in August, the IPC published its report saying that famine had spread to Gaza City, Israel was planning one of the biggest offensives of the war to capture the city and force about a million civilians to flee south.</p><p>Israel was open about its plans, which prompted a warning about the prospects for September from the IPC. It said that intensified military action, and the forced relocation of already fragile civilian populations would make the famine in Gaza \"significantly more severe\".</p><p>That is now the risk.</p></div></article>"

Israeli armoured vehicles were also reportedly seen close to the main UN compound in southern Gaza City, about 700m (2297ft) from the centre.</p></div><div><p>The BBC has spoken to a Hamas figure who claims the militant group is willing to call thousands of fighters into the city, raising the fear of intense fighting in dense urban areas where thousands of civilians remain.</p><p>He said that Izz al-Din al-Haddad, the group's military commander, has ordered all available fighters across the Strip to converge on the city, telling them to prepare for a \"final, decisive battle\".</p></div><div><p>The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) estimated last week that up to 3,000 Hamas fighters were in the city. The Hamas figure claimed they had 5,000 fighters and threatened suicide attacks, though that has not been a tactic Hamas has used widely in this recent conflict. The BBC cannot independently verify these figures and Hamas has not officially commented.</p><p>International journalists have been banned by Israel from entering the Gaza Strip independently since the start of the war nearly two years ago, making verifying claims from both sides difficult. Some journalists have been taken into Gaza by the IDF under controlled access.</p><p>Israel has been trying to destroy the tunnels in Gaza to stop the militants using them for surprise attacks. But the Hamas militant claimed that some remained intact and that the group had learned from Israel's successes in destroying militant units that have attempted to hold ground in a fight.</p><p>Before he was killed by Israel, the group's previous military chief, Mohammed Deif, issued orders that the militant group should adopt a move towards guerrilla tactics and ambushes to mitigate their catastrophic losses.</p><p>According to residents in Gaza City, Israel has reacted to this by conducting rapid thrusts into urban areas, before pulling back within hours.</p><p>The Israeli media has also reported that the IDF has used damaged armoured vehicles, packed with explosives, and fitted with remote control capabilities, to attack Hamas positions or destroy buildings being used to hide fighters.</p><p>Small quadcopter drones equipped with loudspeakers have also been deployed by Israel to warn civilians to leave, spreading panic in several districts.</p><p>Thousands of Palestinian families have continued to flee south along the coastal al-Rashid road, the only route currently permitted by the Israeli military. The UN estimated on Tuesday that at least 321,000 people have fled south since mid-August. The IDF puts the total figure at 640,000.</p><p>The journey has become prohibitively expensive, with families paying more than $3,000 (£2,450) for transport, far beyond the means of most Gaza residents. Many have been forced to abandon belongings they could not carry on foot.</p><p>Those remaining in Gaza City - thought to be hundreds of thousands - face the constant threat of bombardment, collapsing hospitals and dwindling food and water. A <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c05ed5rgld3o\">UN-backed agency confirmed a famine</a> in the area in late August.</p><p>The Israeli military launched a campaign in Gaza in response to the Hamas-led attack on southern Israel on 7 October 2023, in which about 1,200 people were killed and 251 others were taken hostage.</p><p>At least 65,419 people have been killed in Israeli attacks in Gaza since then, according to the territory's Hamas-run health ministry.</p></div>"

Aerospace\".</p><p>There have been hundreds of flight delays after Collins Aerospace baggage and check-in software used by several airlines failed, with some boarding passengers using pen and

trying to relaunch it on Monday.</p><p>Collins Aerospace's parent company RTX Corporation told the BBC it appreciated the NCA's \"ongoing assistance in this matter\". </p><p>The US firm has not put a timeline on when it will be ready and is urging ground handlers and airlines to plan for at least another week of using manual workarounds. </p><p>At Heathrow, extra staff have been deployed in

ransoms every year.</p></div><p></p><h2>Days of disruption</h2><p></p><div><p>The attack against US software maker Collins Aerospace was discovered on Friday night and resulted in disruption across

said in a statement on its website.</p><p>Berlin Airport said on Wednesday morning \"check-in and boarding are still largely manual\", which would result in \"longer processing times, delays, and cancellations by airlines\".</p><p>While Brussels Airport advised passengers to check in online before arriving at the airport.</p><p>Cyber-attacks in the aviation sector have increased by 600% over
