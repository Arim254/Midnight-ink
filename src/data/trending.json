    "body": "<div><p>Greta Thunberg has pushed back on criticism that a Gaza-bound flotilla she is a part of is a publicity stunt, saying no one would imperil themselves purely for attention.</p><p>The Swedish activist is aboard one of 52 boats that form the Global Sumud Flotilla (GSF), which is travelling toward Gaza with the aim of delivering humanitarian aid to Palestinians there.</p><p>Israeli authorities have ridiculed the GSF flotilla and similar seaborne attempts to reach the territory, calling the boat Thunberg travelled on in June a \"selfie yacht\".</p><p>Asked about these criticisms of the flotilla by the BBC's Laura Kuenssberg, the activist said: \"I don't think anyone would risk their life for a publicity stunt.\"</p></div><div><p>Speaking while sailing off the Greek coast, she said the flotilla was not just a humanitarian mission but was also sending a message to people in Gaza that \"when our governments fail to step up, the people will step up\".</p><p>International aid agencies have been attempting to get food and medicine into the Palestinian territory - but note Israel is restricting the flow of supplies. Israel claims it is attempting to stop those supplies falling into the hands of Hamas, and has approved a US-backed aid agency.</p><p>Last month, a UN-backed body confirmed that there was famine in Gaza and the UN's humanitarian chief said it was the direct result of Israel's \"systematic obstruction\" of aid entering the territory. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has called this an \"outright lie\".</p><p>Thunberg said the purpose of the flotilla was to \"break Israel's illegal and inhumane siege on Gaza by sea\". The Israeli military has long controlled the waters that border Gaza.</p><p>Earlier this month, the flotilla came under attack by drones which dropped unidentified objects onto boats outside the Tunisian port of Sidi Bou Said.</p><p>Another suspected drone attack on Wednesday, off the coast of Crete, led Spain and Italy to <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/ce3yz939qnpo\">deploy naval ships to assist the flotilla</a>.</p><p>Addressing the incidents, Thunberg accused Israeli officials of making \"baseless threats\" that violate international law, and asked: \"Why would they attack a peaceful humanitarian mission aiming to bring humanitarian aid to a starving population?\"</p><p>Israel has not commented on the drone attack, but has previously said it would not let the flotilla reach its destination.</p><p>Thunberg and 11 other activists were detained by Israeli authorities in June after they intercepted another boat heading for Gaza with a token amount of aid in the Mediterranean.</p><p>She was held in Tel Aviv for a day before being deported to France. </p><p>Thunberg accused Israel of illegally kidnapping her and the other activists while they were in international waters. Israel said it had prevented a breach of the maritime blockade around Gaza.</p></div>"

Russia said it struck military facilities and industrial enterprises supporting Ukraine's armed forces.</p></div><div><p>For Ukrainians, aerial bombardments can be both random and routine. </p><p>They tend to occur late on Saturday evenings - in this case, the first sirens were heard at 22:00 GMT. </p><p>The sound of anti-aircraft fire was punctuated with occasional explosions - presumably either from the sound of an intercepted drone or one hitting its target.</p><p>In Kyiv, the country's air alert app urged people to head to shelters and stay there. They were followed by pings warning of an increased aerial threat as hundreds of drones descended on the city. </p><p>Ukraine's Defence Minister Igor Klymenko said that at least 100 civilian sites had been damaged across the country by the attack, with entire neighbourhoods lefts in ruins. </p><p>Emergency services said an attack on Kyiv's Institute of Cardiology had killed a nurse and a patient. </p><p>A large bakery, an automobile rubber factory, as well as apartment buildings and civilian infrastructure were also targeted, Zelensky said. </p></div><div><p>He added that Zaporizhzhia, Khmelnytskyi, Sumy, Mykolaiv, Chernihiv and Odesa regions were also hit.</p><p>Zaporizhzhia's Governor Ivan Fedorov said 34 people had been injured in the region, including three children - two boys, aged 11 and 12, and a nine-year-old girl. </p><p>One boy was caught in an explosion while the other had suffered carbon monoxide poisoning, he said. Both are in a serious condition.</p><p>Sumy's regional governor said a 59-year-old man had died in strikes in the past day.</p><p>Zelensky vowed that Ukraine \"will strike back\" in a bid to \"force diplomacy\" from Russia, and said he was counting on a \"strong reaction\" from Europe and the US. </p><p>\"This dastardly attack took place in fact as the end of the week of the UN General Assembly, and this is how Russia declares its real position,\" he said.</p><p>Zelensky reiterated his support of US President Donald Trump's threat of harsher sanctions on Russia, as well as his call for European allies to curb their Russian oil and gas imports.</p><p>Trump has recently shifted his position on the war, saying for the first time last week that he thought Ukraine could retake the land it had lost from Moscow as the Russian economy flagged under the strain of a prolonged war.</p><p>The US president has so far desisted from imposing further sanctions on Russia, but has appeared increasingly frustrated with the lack of eagerness from the Kremlin to begin peace talks.</p></div><figure><div><p><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20250919-090805-05e5ba0164-web-2.30.1-2/grey-placeholder.png\" /><img srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/67be/live/c6722380-9c49-11f0-82b3-31d97f4e1ffa.jpg.webp 240w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/67be/live/c6722380-9c49-11f0-82b3-31d97f4e1ffa.jpg.webp 320w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/67be/live/c6722380-9c49-11f0-82b3-31d97f4e1ffa.jpg.webp 480w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/67be/live/c6722380-9c49-11f0-82b3-31d97f4e1ffa.jpg.webp 640w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/67be/live/c6722380-9c49-11f0-82b3-31d97f4e1ffa.jpg.webp 800w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/67be/live/c6722380-9c49-11f0-82b3-31d97f4e1ffa.jpg.webp 1024w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/67be/live/c6722380-9c49-11f0-82b3-31d97f4e1ffa.jpg.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/67be/live/c6722380-9c49-11f0-82b3-31d97f4e1ffa.jpg.webp\" alt=\"Reuters An explosion of a missile in the sky over the city during a Russian missile and drone strike\" /><span>Reuters</span></p></div><p></p><figcaption>Many of the projectiles were aimed at Kyiv, where the Institute of Cardiology was hit</figcaption><p></p></figure><div><p>Zelensky said on Saturday that Russia would not stop its aggression with Ukraine - which is why it was testing European air defences with the recent incursions in several countries belonging to the Nato military alliance.</p><p>Meanwhile, jets were scrambled in neighbouring Poland early on Sunday as Russia hit western Ukraine, the nation's armed forces said. </p><p>The Polish military described the actions - which have become routine since Polish and Nato aircraft <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c147065pzdzo\">shot down three Russian drones</a> in Poland's airspace on 10 September - as preventative.</p><p>Denmark's Defence Ministry confirmed on Sunday that it had observed drones over military sites for a <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c3rvzdq93yro\">second night in a row</a>.</p><p>Nato has now said it will upgrade its mission in the Baltic Sea in response, including enhanced surveillance and stationing at least one air defence frigate there. </p><p>It follows a series of incidents in which drones appeared over Danish airports, causing disruption to air traffic.

It was at the university that the two first hit upon the idea of studying smelly shoes.</p><p>Mr Mittal says he often noticed his hostel corridors were lined with shoes, often left outside twin-sharing rooms. The initial idea was simple: why not design a sleek, aesthetic shoe rack for students? But as they dug deeper, the real culprit emerged - it wasn't clutter but the foul smell that was driving the footwear outdoors.</p><p>\"It wasn't about space or a lack of shoe racks - there was plenty of room. The problem was frequent sweating and the constant use of shoes that made them smelly,\" says Mr Mittal, who now works for a software company.</p><p>So the two embarked on a survey in the university hostels asking a truly human question: if our sneakers reek, doesn't that ruin the entire experience of using a shoe rack?</p></div><figure><div><p><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20250919-090805-05e5ba0164-web-2.30.1-2/grey-placeholder.png\" /><img srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/efc8/live/08c23e40-9926-11f0-9a4d-cda90a899290.jpg.webp 240w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/efc8/live/08c23e40-9926-11f0-9a4d-cda90a899290.jpg.webp 320w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/efc8/live/08c23e40-9926-11f0-9a4d-cda90a899290.jpg.webp 480w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/efc8/live/08c23e40-9926-11f0-9a4d-cda90a899290.jpg.webp 640w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/efc8/live/08c23e40-9926-11f0-9a4d-cda90a899290.jpg.webp 800w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/efc8/live/08c23e40-9926-11f0-9a4d-cda90a899290.jpg.webp 1024w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/efc8/live/08c23e40-9926-11f0-9a4d-cda90a899290.jpg.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/efc8/live/08c23e40-9926-11f0-9a4d-cda90a899290.jpg.webp\" alt=\"Vikash Kumar (left) and his former student Sarthak Mittal\" /></p></div><p></p><figcaption>Vikash Kumar (left) and his former student Sarthak Mittal won the deep dive into stinky shoes</figcaption><p></p></figure><div><p>Their survey of 149 university students - 80% of them male - confirmed what most of us already know but rarely admit: more than half had felt embarrassed by their own shoes or someone else's stink, nearly all kept their footwear in racks at home, and hardly anyone had heard of existing deodorising products. Homegrown hacks - tea bags in shoes, sprinkling baking soda, spraying deodorant - weren't cutting it.</p><p>The two researchers then turned to science. The culprit, they knew from existing research, was Kytococcus sedentarius, a bacterium that thrives in sweaty shoes. Their experiments showed that a short blast of ultraviolet light killed the microbes and banished the stink.</p><p>\"In India, almost every household has a shoe rack of one type or the other, and having a rack which keeps the shoes smell free would give a great experience,\" the authors noted in their paper.</p><p>They saw \"smelly shoes as an opportunity for re-designing the traditional shoe rack for a better user experience\".</p><p>The result? Not your average ergonomics paper - and just the kind of delightfully oddball idea: a prototype for a UVC light-equipped shoe rack that doesn't just store shoes but sterilises them. (UV covers a spectrum, but only the C band has germicidal properties.)</p><p>For the experiment, the researchers used shoes worn by university athletes, which had a pronounced odour. Because bacterial build-up is greatest near the toe, the UVC light was focused there.</p><p>The study measured odour levels against exposure time, and found that just 2–3 minutes of UVC treatment was sufficient to kill the bacteria and eliminate the foul smell. It was not simple: too much light meant too much heat which ended up burning the shoe rubber.</p></div><figure><div><p><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20250919-090805-05e5ba0164-web-2.30.1-2/grey-placeholder.png\" /><img srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/d84f/live/1041cc80-9926-11f0-9a4d-cda90a899290.jpg.webp 240w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/d84f/live/1041cc80-9926-11f0-9a4d-cda90a899290.jpg.webp 320w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/d84f/live/1041cc80-9926-11f0-9a4d-cda90a899290.jpg.webp 480w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/d84f/live/1041cc80-9926-11f0-9a4d-cda90a899290.jpg.webp 640w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/d84f/live/1041cc80-9926-11f0-9a4d-cda90a899290.jpg.webp 800w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/d84f/live/1041cc80-9926-11f0-9a4d-cda90a899290.jpg.webp 1024w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/d84f/live/1041cc80-9926-11f0-9a4d-cda90a899290.jpg.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/d84f/live/1041cc80-9926-11f0-9a4d-cda90a899290.jpg.webp\" alt=\"Hindustan Times via Getty Images Shoe racks with lots of sneakers\" /><span>Hindustan Times via Getty Images</span></p></div><p></p><figcaption>Most shoe racks store shoes - and dont fight odour, say the researchers</figcaption><p></p></figure><div><p>The researchers didn't just point a UVC tube light at the shoes and hope for the best - they measured every whiff.</p><p>At the start, the odour was described as \"strong, pungent, rotten-cheese-like\".

local people appeared not to know details including how many new homes could be built.</p><p>David Sutton, the parish council chair of Tempsford, which is currently home to 600 people living in about 300 houses, said residents had been kept in the dark about the potential plans.</p><p>\"The biggest problem we've got at the moment is that even today, as an announcement's being made, we've been given no idea whatsoever of the scale of what we're being asked to live amongst,\" he told the PA news agency.</p><p>\"Nobody's come to talk to us at all.\"</p></div><div><p>Sir Keir is keen to use the party conference to highlight his Labour government's achievements in its first year in Downing Street, including progress on housebuilding.</p><p>The 12 proposed developments range from large-scale standalone new communities, to expansions of existing towns and regeneration schemes within cities.</p><p>Sites in Cheshire, South Gloucestershire, East Devon, Plymouth and Manchester are among those which have been recommended for development.</p><p>The chosen sites will be subject to environmental assessments and consultation, with the government confirming the final locations and funding next spring.</p><p>Labour said each new town would have at least 10,000 homes and they could collectively result in 300,000 homes being built across England over the coming decades.</p><p>The government has welcomed a recommendation from the New Towns Taskforce that at least 40% of these new homes should be classed as affordable housing.</p><p>A New Towns Unit will be tasked with bringing in millions of pounds of public and private sector funding to invest in GP surgeries, schools, green spaces, libraries and transport for the new developments.</p><p>The taskforce has recommended new towns are delivered by development corporations, which could have special planning powers to compulsory purchase land, invest in local services, and grant planning permission.</p><p>This follows the

It will rip this country apart.\"</p><p>Challenged on whether he thought Reform was trying to appeal to racists, Sir Keir said: \"No. I think there are plenty of people who either vote Reform or are thinking of voting Reform who are frustrated.</p><p>\"They had 14 years of failure under the Conservatives, they want us to change things - they may have voted Labour a year ago - but they want things to change more quickly.</p><p>\"I actually totally do understand that, if after 14 years your living standards haven't got any better and your public services have declined then of course you want change.\"</p><p>Responding to Sir Keir's comments, Reform UK's Zia Yusuf said: \"Labour's message to the country is clear: pay hundreds of billions for foreign nationals to live off the state forever, or Labour will call you racist.</p><p>\"Reform's plan will ensure only British people can access welfare and that migrants contribute to society.\"</p><p>According to a YouGov poll published on Saturday, abolishing indefinite leave to remain divides the public, with 58% of Britons opposed to removing it from those who already hold it.</p><p>But more than 44% say they support ending ILR as a policy, while 43% are opposed to the idea.</p><p>In an <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/politics/36850728/shabana-mahmood-immigration-home-office/\">interview with the Sun on Sunday</a>, Home Secretary Shabana Mahmood suggested she wanted to look at changing the law to tighten rules around claiming ILR.</p><p>She said legal migration was a \"good thing\" and the UK had \"always welcomed people who want to come and work here\" - but that migrants should make a \"contribution to their wider community\".</p></div><div><p>As Labour members gather for the annual conference, the prime minister has a chance in the next few days to spell out to his party, and to the public, where he stands and what Labour wants to achieve in government.</p><p>It follows a difficult few weeks, with the loss of deputy prime minister Angela Rayner and US ambassador Lord Mandelson, and a <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c7v1m873mjyo\">challenge from Greater Manchester mayor Andy Burnham about his leadership</a>.</p><p>The PM will be using his time at conference to build on the arguments he has been making about patriotism in politics, trying to reclaim some of the territory Reform has been trying to grab.</p></div><p></p><figcaption>Watch: How Labour's popularity has plummeted in the polls</figcaption><p></p><div><p>Pressed on voters' frustration with the party, with Labour consistently behind Reform in the polls, the prime minister said he had told voters it would \"take more than 12 months to turn around 14 years of failure\".</p><p>\"I can't sit here and say this can all be turned around on a flick of a switch, it's going to take time...I just need the space to get on and do what we need to do,\" he said.</p><p>With speculation swirling about a leadership challenge, Sir Keir also appealed for unity, saying the UK has not faced \"a proposition like Reform before\" and needed to fight for \"the soul of this country\".</p><p>\"I'm not sticking my fingers in my ears,\" he said, when asked if the problem was him.</p><p>\"We've got the fight of our lives ahead of us because we've got to take on Reform and we've got to beat them,\" he added. \"So now is not the time for introspection or navel-gazing.</p><p>\"There is a fight that we're all in together, and every single member of our party and our movement, actually everyone who cares about what this country is, whether they vote Labour or otherwise.</p><p>\"It's the fight of our lives for who we are as a country, and we need to be in that fight, united not navel-gazing.\"</p><p>However, it is the threat from Reform has accelerated the fears and jitters of Labour MPs and activists, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/live/cgj1wndne9vt?post=asset%3A7195c840-aaf3-4cbf-9ae4-77844bb51f24#post\">the BBC's political editor Chris Mason writes</a>.</p><p>Labour MPs are not blind to opinion polls and they point to the cavernous depths of Sir Keir's unpopularity, he says, with one backbencher saying: \"He makes [former leader Jeremy] Corbyn look loved.\"</p></div><figure><div><p><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20250919-090805-05e5ba0164-web-2.30.1-2/grey-placeholder.png\" /><img srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/6fad/live/133a6af0-dc98-11ef-bc01-8f2c83dad217.png.webp 240w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/6fad/live/133a6af0-dc98-11ef-bc01-8f2c83dad217.png.webp 320w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/6fad/live/133a6af0-dc98-11ef-bc01-8f2c83dad217.png.webp 480w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/6fad/live/133a6af0-dc98-11ef-bc01-8f2c83dad217.png.webp 640w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/6fad/live/133a6af0-dc98-11ef-bc01-8f2c83dad217.png.webp 800w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/6fad/live/133a6af0-dc98-11ef-bc01-8f2c83dad217.png.webp 1024w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/6fad/live/133a6af0-dc98-11ef-bc01-8f2c83dad217.png.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/6fad/live/133a6af0-dc98-11ef-bc01-8f2c83dad217.png.webp\" alt=\"Thin, red banner promoting the Politics Essential newsletter with text saying, “Get the latest political analysis and big moments, delivered straight to your inbox every weekday”.

And given their closeness to the Trump regime, that seems to be the point,\" the media watch group FAIR warned recently. </p></div><div><p>Senator Elizabeth Warren has called for any Paramount-Warner Brother tie-up to be blocked, as a \"dangerous concentration of power\". Other groups have criticised the TikTok deal as a giveaway to allies of the president.</p><p>House Democrats last month also said they were launching an investigation to see if Paramount-Skydance had made any commitments to Trump to secure approval, a potential violation of anti-bribery laws.</p><p>They noted that just weeks before the deal was approved, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c3w4n8778q2o\">Paramount agreed to pay $16m to settle a lawsuit with Trump</a>, who had accused CBS of deceptively editing a Kamala Harris interview to help Democrats. </p><p>Trump has also <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/posts/114898229237459086\">said</a> \"the new owners\" had promised him billions worth of free advertising or programming.</p><p>David Ellison has said Skydance was not involved in the Paramount settlement and his firm is in compliance with anti-bribery laws. But he has ducked questions about a side deal, telling reporters last month: \"We're not going to politicise anything today.\" </p><p>He has also already made some changes at CBS, some of which were conditions announced by the FCC when it signed off on the deal.  </p><p>Those have included appointing a conservative watchdog to review complaints of bias. The company has also said CBS's political show, 'Face the Nation' will only air live or unedited interviews, a break with long established journalistic practice. </p><p>\"These actions are in line with what the White House has made clear that they want so I think this is really concerning,\" said Rodney Benson, a media professor at New York University and lead author of the book How Media Ownership Matters.</p></div><div><p>Speaking to reporters after the merger, David Ellison,<b> </b>whose track record of political giving shows contributions to Democrats last year,<b> </b>said he wanted to avoid being associated with either the left or the right.</p><p>\"We're an entertainment company first, and I genuinely believe if you're breathing, you're our audience,\" he said, according to the LA Times. \"We want to be in the business of speaking to everybody.\"</p><p>Other executives pushed back on the notion the firm's owners would seek to sway news coverage, with Gerry Cardinale, one of Skydance's partners and the other major investor in the deal with Paramount, calling the idea \"bad business\".</p><p>\"The kernel of the entire investment thesis is independence and objectivity. If you can't get your head around that, don't buy it,\" he said, according to Variety. </p><p>\"There's no way we're going to try to influence it.\"</p></div><div><p>On Wall Street, Paramount's potential tie-up with Warner Brothers Discovery has plenty of fans, as investors see an opportunity to create a studio with the distribution power and library to rival Disney and Netflix. </p><p>Analysts noted that David Ellison's background in movie-making and role as chief executive sets him apart from some other tech titans, like Jeff Bezos, who have purchased media publications as a kind of hobby. </p><p>But while Ellison has expressed love for the movies -<b> </b>holding onto his mother's collection of VHS tapes as recently as 2022 - he has said little about the news industry.</p><p>Analysts said they would be surprised if it were a priority, given its relatively small financial contribution to the overall business. Ellison has also said he is looking to make $2bn in cuts at Paramount.</p><p> \"I don't view this as something that says 'I want to get bigger into news',\" said Ric Prentiss, managing director at Raymond James. \"I think this is something that says 'I want to create content'... I don't think news is a strong part of it.\"</p><p>Paul Hardart, director of the entertainment, media and technology programme at New York University's Stern School of Business, said the push to grow suggested the Ellisons were looking to seize the moment.</p><p>\"Who knows how long they will have the administration's ear?\" he said. </p><p>After all, when Elon Musk, another mega billionaire and would-be media mogul, tied himself to the Trump administration, that relationship ended up going up in flames. </p></div></article>"

The banking secrecy laws, now much diluted, were designed to shield an individual's personal finances from the prying eyes of the state.</p><p>For years, Google Street View was controversial in Switzerland - and even today, following a ruling by the Swiss Federal Court, images taken close to schools, women's refuges, hospitals or prisons must be automatically blurred before going online. </p><p>There are also far fewer CCTV cameras in Switzerland than in many of its European neighbours.</p><p>Opponents of digital ID cards, who gathered enough signatures to force another referendum on the issue, argue that this measure could still undermine individual privacy.</p><p>They also fear that, despite the new restrictions on how data is collected and stored, it could still be used to track people and for marketing purposes.</p><p>An early projection while voting continues suggests a 50-50 split over the issue, making the final result - expected late on Sunday - too close to call.</p><p>Opinion polls heading into the referendum suggested voters may be ready to give electronic IDs a chance.</p><p>They have already had experience of the government's Covid ID, which was used during the pandemic to show vaccination status and was mandatory to enter restaurants and bars.</p><p>And as for the concerns about marketing of personal data, most Swiss have smartphones and are keen users of social media. </p><p>Tech giants are already harvesting their likes and dislikes, so many voters believe that allowing the Swiss authorities to check on a few details from time to time will not make a big difference.</p></div>"
