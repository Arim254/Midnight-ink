I got you. “My man!” This is the moment in the film where Isaiah White, played by Marlon Wayans, is going to teach Cameron Cade, played by Tyriq Withers a lesson in how to be a great quarterback. In this lesson, I did a lot of research about quarterback drills that hone in on specific skills. For example, in a pro game, you want to be able to get the ball out of your hands under two seconds. So that’s why we have two seconds on the clock and to work on that speed that’s required of decision making. That’s why he’s turned away from the actual receivers. He has his eyes closed. So that you’re forced into a panic-like situation, and you have to throw the ball as quickly as possible. So what I really wanted to communicate in this scene specifically, was that there’s going to be a big tonal shift from something’s off to something’s very wrong, and it’s the first time we’re going to introduce violence and a dynamic between the two characters that becomes much more like a narcissistic, abusive relationship than a mentor-mentee “Too slow.” But seed it and bury that under the guise of hazing and just being a rookie. And what I landed on was this idea of using this JUGS machine to be that conduit of punishment. I also didn’t want him to have time to process anything. That’s why I kind of try to get music and a rhythm going in the edit. And even the sound design is rhythmic. That vibration and metallic clanking, it escalates and grows and grows over this entire sequence. And then we have these really tight, extreme close-ups of Cameron Cade’s eyes. And that was just a creative choice I made to rely on the language of horror, where there’s a classic peekaboo.</p></dd></dl></div></div></div>"

Utah Governor Spencer Cox also said Robinson had a \"leftist ideology\".</p><p>After Kimmel's suspension, US President Donald Trump, who appointed Carr at the beginning of his second term, praised the decison. </p><p>Trump later said broadcast TV networks do not treat him fairly and could have their licences \"taken away\".</p><p>\"Efforts by leaders to pressure artists, journalists, and companies with retaliation for their speech strike at the heart of what it means to live in a free country,\" the celebrities' letter says. \"This is the moment to defend free speech across our nation.\"</p><p>Actors Alan Cumming and Florence Pugh also signed the letter spearheaded by the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU).</p><p>They say many others are facing \"direct attacks on their freedom of expression\", including teachers, government employees, researchers and students, and are adding their voices to defend free speech.</p><p>Kimmel's fellow late-night US hosts lashed out at his suspension last week amid Trump's escalating threats to broadcast networks. </p><p>CBS announced in July that it is cancelling The Late Show hosted by Stephen Colbert, something it called \"purely a financial decision\", though some linked the move to a looming merger involving CBS's parent company that requires US regulatory approval.</p><p>Kimmel, who is among the top talk show personalities in the US, emceed the Oscars four times and has hosted Jimmy Kimmel Live! since 2003. </p><p>ABC pulled the plug after Nexstar Media, one of the biggest owners of TV stations in the US, said its stations would not air the show \"for the foreseeable future\".</p></div>"

    "body": "<p></p><h2>'Why does China prefer war?' The K-drama line that infuriated the Chinese internet</h2><p></p><div><p>In the spy romance series Tempest, Jun Ji-hyun, one of South Korea's biggest stars, plays a diplomat trying to uncover the truth behind a deadly assassination.</p><p>\"Why does China prefer war? A nuclear bomb could fall near the border,\" her character says in one episode of the new Disney+ series. </p><p>This fictional scene led to real consequences over the weekend, with many Chinese social media users taking it to be a malicious mischaracterisation of China as belligerent.<b> </b>Many are now calling for brands to sever ties with the Korean actress. </p><p>The uproar has also reignited debate over an unofficial Chinese ban on South Korean entertainment, which has been in place for nearly a decade.</p></div><div><p>While China has never admitted to a ban, the abrupt dearth of K-content since 2016 is widely believed to be a protest against South Korea's decision to deploy a US anti-missile system in 2016, which China sees as a threat to its military operations in the region.</p><p>Things had appeared to be easing in recent months, with a few South Korean performers holding concerts in China. But the controversy over Tempest has triggered a fresh wave of support for the ban.</p><p>\"Keep the K-drama ban to the death, thank you,\" reads one Weibo comment liked by 10,000 users.</p><p>While much of the anger has coalesced around Jun's line about China, social media users have also dug up other examples from the series which they view as offensive.</p><p>For example, scenes meant to portray China's Dalian city feature a bunch of dilapidated buildings, believed to be shot in Hong Kong, which some people say paints China in a bad light.</p><p>In another scene, a group of people are seated at a table set on a red carpet with yellow stars, which social media users say resembles the Chinese flag. </p><p>When Jun recited an ancient Chinese poem in another instance, viewers criticised what they viewed as her wonky accent.</p><p>All this has led to a concerted effort against Jun on Weibo, where users are pressuring brands to punish her. </p></div><div><p>According to sharp-eyed Weibo users, American skincare brand La Mer, French luxury brand Louis Vuitton and Swiss watchmaker Piaget have all scrubbed Jun from their social media accounts. </p><p>\"Besides removing Jun Ji-hyun advertisements, quickly terminate her contracts globally. Otherwise we'll boycott LV forever,\" reads one comment on Louis Vuitton's Weibo account.</p><p>Jun's agency told local news outlet MBC on Tuesday that the actress's brand campaigns were \"unrelated\" to Tempest and had ended before the show's release. </p><p>Chinese consumers are known to harness their massive spending power in pressure campaigns when they perceive insults to Chinese national pride.</p><p>Brands from Swedish fashion giant H&M to Japanese clothing chain Uniqlo and most recently Swatch - <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cn02k9ykej5o\">for an ad featuring an a</a><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cn02k9ykej5o\">llegedly</a><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cn02k9ykej5o\"> racist gesture</a> - have all found themselves the target of such boycott campaigns.</p><p>Some people have come to Jun's defence, arguing that she was not the one who wrote the controversial line.</p><p>\"Jun Ji-hyun is just an actor. It is impossible for her to understand the history of a country, the emotions of the people, and the intricate relationships between countries before making a movie,\" one Weibo user wrote, blaming the incident on the \"ignorance\" of the show's crew and writers.</p><p>But such sentiments have been drowned out by heated opposition. \"Even a washing machine can't whitewash something as well as you,\" reads a comment to the post. </p><p>\"She isn't a small-time actor. She has a choice of script, she can read the script! Who can force a popular star to do this?\" another wrote.</p><p>Jun swept to stardom with the 2001 rom-com My Sassy Girl, which took Asia by storm and established her as a noughties 'it girl'. Since then, she has found enduring success with her roles, from the 2013 fantasy romance series My Love from the Star, to the 2021 Netflix thriller Kingdom.</p><p>But like many other South Korean celebrities, she has been conspicuously missing from China's entertainment scene since the 2016 ban. </p><p>Optimism had surrounded a lifting of the ban earlier this year, as bilateral ties appeared to be warming.</p><p>In March, South Korea's foreign ministry said that the two countries' foreign ministers agreed to work on restoring cultural exchanges. The following month, South Korean hip-hop band Homies became the first all-Korean group to perform in mainland China in nearly a decade.</p><p>But it's hard to say how much K-pop and K-dramas will be let back into what was once its biggest market.</p><p>In May, K-pop boy band Epex was slated to perform in Fuzhou, in what would have been a landmark concert for K-pop in China. But their show was cancelled weeks before the event, with their management agency citing \"local circumstances\".</p><p>Last week, when asked about the postponement of another concert in Hainan province that was set to feature multiple K-pop groups, Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson Lin Jian said that China did not oppose \"beneficial cultural exchanges\" with South Korea.</p><p>Over the last decade, China has proven to be a <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/videos/c78082v5jplo\">pop culture juggernaut</a> in its own right, capable of keeping its population of 1.3 billion entertained with homegrown media. And for many Chinese viewers, the ongoing controversy surrounding Tempest has given them another reason to steer away from K-content.</p><p>\"It's already 2025 and you're still watching K-dramas, how tacky!\" wrote a Weibo user.</p></div>"

It has not yet commented on Kimmel's reinstatement. </p><p>Critics and First Amendment advocates railed against ABC's decision last week as censorship and a violation of free speech. </p><p>Kimmel, who has hosted the late-night programme since 2003 and hosted four Oscars ceremonies, has not yet publicly addressed the suspension or the fallout. </p><p>The row started after Kimmel said in his monologue on 15 September that the \"Maga gang\" were \"desperately trying to characterise this kid who murdered Charlie Kirk as anything other than one of them\" and trying to \"score political points from it\".</p><p>He also made fun of Trump's reaction to the influencer's murder, showing a clip of the president responding to a question about how he was mourning the death by changing the subject to construction of a new White House ballroom.  </p><p>Kimmel compared the response to \"how a four-year-old mourns a goldfish\".</p><p>Brendan Carr, the Trump-appointed chair of broadcast regulator the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c87yel3wgqgo\">Federal Communications Commission (FCC</a>), threatened to act against ABC and its parent company Disney over Kimmel's remarks. </p><p>The spat comes as Vice President JD Vance and other White House allies have been pushing a national campaign to punish anyone who has criticised Kirk in the wake of his death. </p><p>Hours after Mr Carr made his initial remarks about Kimmel's monologue, Nexstar said it would not air Kimmel's show \"for the foreseeable future\".</p><p>Sinclair followed suit and ABC announced that it would \"indefinitely\" suspend the programme and demanded an apology from Kimmel, as well as a donation to Kirk's non-profit organization Turning Point USA.</p><p>Mr Carr thanked Nexstar \"for doing the right thing\" and said he hoped other broadcasters would follow its lead. Nexstar is currently seeking FCC approval for its planned $6.2bn (£4.5bn) merger with Tegna.</p><p>Anna Gomez, the sole Democrat on the FCC, said on Monday that she was \"glad to see Disney find its courage in the face of clear government intimidation\".</p><p>Ms Gomez also thanked Americans across the ideological spectrum who protested \"this blatant attempt to silence free speech\" and vowed to \"combat these efforts to stifle free expression\".</p><p><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c203n52x1y9o\">ABC's decision</a> to suspend Kimmel<b> </b>was met with protests in California and lambasted by the writers and actors guilds, lawmakers and the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) alike, who argued that the suspension violates free speech rights and spurs a chilling effect.</p><p>Kimmel's late-night colleagues, including Jon Stewart, John Oliver and outgoing CBS host Stephen Colbert, rallied behind him and hundreds of celebrities and Hollywood creatives <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c62le8q959yo\">signed on to a letter</a> backing Kimmel. </p><p>Ben Stiller, Jennifer Aniston, Meryl Streep and Robert DeNiro are among those who called Kimmel's suspension a \"dark moment for freedom of speech in our nation\".</p><p>Critics have also called for the cancellation of Disney+, Hulu and other Disney-owned subscription services to cut into the entertainment conglomerate's bottom line over it decision to suspend Kimmel.</p></div>"
