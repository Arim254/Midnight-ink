We tend, there­fore, to regard it less as some­thing cre­at­ed than as some­thing for all intents and pur­pos­es eter­nal, but there was a time when pub­lish­ers had to active­ly adopt it. The first Amer­i­can firm to start using Times New Roman was the Mer­ry­mount Press, which had already made a high­ly pres­ti­gious name for itself with pub­li­ca­tions like the ele­gant <em>Book of Com­mon Prayer </em>financed by no less a cap­tain of indus­try than J. Pier­pont Mor­gan. But oth­er print­ers knew Mer­ry­mount for a book that would have inspired in them an equal­ly wor­ship­ful impulse.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://cdn8.openculture.com/2025/09/23222828/OC-Printing-Types-2.jpg\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://cdn8.openculture.com/2025/09/23222828/OC-Printing-Types-2.jpg 1739w, https://cdn8.openculture.com/2025/09/23222828/OC-Printing-Types-2-360x246.jpg 360w, https://cdn8.openculture.com/2025/09/23222828/OC-Printing-Types-2-1024x699.jpg 1024w, https://cdn8.openculture.com/2025/09/23222828/OC-Printing-Types-2-240x164.jpg 240w, https://cdn8.openculture.com/2025/09/23222828/OC-Printing-Types-2-768x524.jpg 768w, https://cdn8.openculture.com/2025/09/23222828/OC-Printing-Types-2-1536x1048.jpg 1536w\" /></p>\n<p>“Released in 1922 with a lat­er revi­sion in 1937,” <em>Print­ing Types: Their His­to­ry, Forms and Use</em> “became known as the stan­dard work on the his­to­ry of [print­ing and typog­ra­phy] and a basic book for all inter­est­ed in the graph­ic arts.

    "body": "<section>\n<article>\n\t<div>\n<p>Why can plants be considered native to more than one nation while people can’t? This line of inquiry grounds a large-scale exhibition by <a href=\"https://www.rauldelara.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Raul De Lara</a> in which he presents his surreal sculptures that merge flora and furnishings. </p>\n<p><em>HOST</em>, on view now at <a href=\"https://thecontemporaryaustin.org/\" target=\"_blank\">The Contemporary Austin</a>, brings together a collection of works that call into question belonging and identity and rejects the idea that state borders are fixed and natural. Using wood endemic to Texas and Mexico, De Lara sculpts potted monsteras sprouting from chains, a schooldesk covered in long spines, and a cactus disguised as a child’s rocking horse. </p>\n<p>The resulting pieces translate what should be a common object—a shovel, for example, or an enormous cluster of daisies in a vase—into the strange and uncanny. Many works are also rendered unusable, including a spiked ladder even the bravest among us would hesitate to climb.</p>\n<figure><img src=\"https://www.thisiscolossal.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Wilt-detail.jpg\" alt=\"a wooden monstera leaf by raul de lara that's browning at the edges\" srcset=\"https://www.thisiscolossal.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Wilt-detail.jpg 2000w, https://www.thisiscolossal.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Wilt-detail-640x960.jpg 640w, https://www.thisiscolossal.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Wilt-detail-960x1440.jpg 960w, https://www.thisiscolossal.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Wilt-detail-768x1152.jpg 768w, https://www.thisiscolossal.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Wilt-detail-1024x1536.jpg 1024w, https://www.thisiscolossal.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Wilt-detail-1365x2048.jpg 1365w\" /><figcaption>Detail of “Wilt” (2022), walnut, pine, red oak, urethane, pigment, and polyurethane, 125 x 25 1/4 x 45 inches</figcaption></figure>\n<p>Now based in Ridgewood, Queens, De Lara grew up near Austin as a child of Mexican immigrants. He first learned woodoworking in his family’s shop, which he describes as “a world where each tool has its own language, each piece of wood shows the passing of time on its skin, and where one is able to communicate through their hands.” A strong belief in animism, luck, and the paranormal pervaded this sacred space and taught the budding artist that he could harness the energy of a particular material to create beautiful objects. </p>\n<p>Today, he sees woodworking as a mode of storytelling, one in which magical realism flourishes. “I welcome the idea that artworks can hold their own spark of life and extend it to us,” De Lara says, adding: </p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>When I make my work, I remember childhood memories of when I would see local carvers turn branches into saints. I always wondered at what point in<br />the carving process does the ghost enters that piece of wood. I strive to make works that invite a certain kind of trust and acceptance from the viewer, that let them live without our realm.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>As global concerns about immigration and human rights intensify, De Lara’s work is all the more relevant. The artist has DACA status and knows firsthand the precarity and swift change that comes with a new administration. </p>\n<figure><img src=\"https://www.thisiscolossal.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Lotion-in-your-lungs-2019.jpg\" alt=\"a cacti on a rocking base by Raul De Lara\" srcset=\"https://www.thisiscolossal.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Lotion-in-your-lungs-2019.jpg 2000w, https://www.thisiscolossal.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Lotion-in-your-lungs-2019-640x593.jpg 640w, https://www.thisiscolossal.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Lotion-in-your-lungs-2019-960x889.jpg 960w, https://www.thisiscolossal.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Lotion-in-your-lungs-2019-768x711.jpg 768w, https://www.thisiscolossal.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Lotion-in-your-lungs-2019-1536x1422.jpg 1536w\" /><figcaption>“Lotion In Your Lungs” (2019), pine, oak, wood glue, sand from Mexico/US border, acrylic, and<br />lacquer, 72 x 24 x 50 inches</figcaption></figure>\n<p>His sculptures capture a sense of whimsy and play that might seem in opposition to this reality, but for De Lara, woodworking, and traditional craft more broadly, is a superpower. “It cannot be taken away from you as it is not tied to location, politics, or laws. You carry it with you and can practice anywhere, with anyone, and oftentimes, it disarms differences amongst us,” he says.</p>\n<p>See <em>HOST</em> through January 11, 2026.

Based in Australia, he delves into urban foraging on his <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/@BeauMiles\" target=\"_blank\">YouTube channel</a>, wrote a book called <em>The Backyard Adventurer, </em>and has made numerous films about everything from building a tiny cabin to exploring Sydney’s most polluted river. Miles also happened to plant a small, flourishing forest in one day.</p>\n<p>“Without being dramatic, it was easily the hardest thing I’ve ever done in a single day,” he says. “But it was also fun—and the kind of thing that shifted how I intend to use my ideas and my body as a force for good. It was practical, hard, and an outcomes-driven use of time and energy.”</p>\n<figure><p>\n<iframe width=\"500\" height=\"281\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/vVLxMJD232A?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\"></iframe>\n</p></figure>\n<p>Miles planted one tree per minute for 24 hours—that’s 1,440 in total—and when he made the <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbA-hoIuHM4\" target=\"_blank\">initial video</a>, he promised to return every two years to report on its progress. In a recent update, he revisits the 2021 marathon project, documenting the wildlife that has moved in, wandering beneath healthy, young trees, and building a small fire from scrounged wood.</p>\n<p>“This was a special day because I really felt like the project had landed,” Miles says. “I had a cup of tea in the new forest, from water boiled on a fire made from the forest itself. It’s perhaps the most profound cup of tea I’ve ever had.”</p>\n<p>Another video that Miles posted in July set a virtual one-month timer on an endeavor to turn his streaming channel into a force for good. With funds from advertising, he aims to purchase and plant even more trees.

    "body": "<section>\n<article>\n\t<div>\n<p>Harnessing the power of empathy, <a href=\"http://www.bisabutler.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Bisa Butler</a> presents a tender, evocative suite of new works in her current exhibition, <em>Hold Me Close</em> at <a href=\"https://deitch.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Jeffrey Deitch</a>. The artist is known for her chromatic, multi-patterned <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.thisiscolossal.com/tags/bisa-butler\">quilted artworks</a> exploring Black history, identity, and craft traditions. Her elaborate pieces combine materials like printed cotton, silk, sequins, beads, and velvet to create both large-scale tapestries and intimate vignettes.</p>\n<p>The work in <em>Hold Me Close </em>centers around the need for mutual respect, love, and togetherness in a society that has become increasingly factious. “This body of work is a visual response to how I am feeling as an African American woman living in 2025,” Butler says in a statement for the show. Deeply moved by our current era of division and violence, in which hard-won civil rights are being challenged and overturned, she taps in the past to shed light on our current moment.</p>\n<figure><img src=\"https://www.thisiscolossal.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/butler-9.jpg\" alt=\"a quilted artwork by Bisa Butler featuring two young Black girls playing in front of a window, with numerous stretches of patterned fabric\" srcset=\"https://www.thisiscolossal.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/butler-9.jpg 2000w, https://www.thisiscolossal.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/butler-9-640x658.jpg 640w, https://www.thisiscolossal.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/butler-9-960x986.jpg 960w, https://www.thisiscolossal.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/butler-9-768x789.jpg 768w, https://www.thisiscolossal.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/butler-9-1495x1536.jpg 1495w, https://www.thisiscolossal.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/butler-9-1993x2048.jpg 1993w\" /><figcaption>“Down, down baby” (2024), after Gorden Parks, “Girls Playing in Water” (1956), cotton, silk, vinyl, velvet, lace netting, and polyester, quilted and appliquéd, 107 x 105 inches</figcaption></figure>\n<p><em>Hold Me Close </em>draws on imagery from trailblazing Black photographers like Gordon Parks, Jean Depara, and Gerald Cyrus, who captured street scenes depicting Black figures going about their daily lives and enjoying one another’s company. Parks, for example, was a staunch civil rights advocate who documented racial segregation and oppression of Black people to boldly illustrate the societal disparities in the 1940s and 1950s.</p>\n<p>In his two-decade role at <em>Life </em>magazine, Parks captured some of his most significant work, ranging from celebrity portraits to the iconic <a href=\"https://www.gordonparksfoundation.org/gordon-parks/photography-archive/march-on-washington-august-28-1963\" target=\"_blank\">March on Washington</a> in 1963. Along with numerous other photographers—and acclaimed artists like <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.thisiscolossal.com/tags/faith-ringgold\">Faith Ringgold</a> and <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.thisiscolossal.com/tags/kerry-james-marshall\">Kerry James Marshall</a>—that Butler turns to for reference imagery, Parks’ images elucidate the evolving diversity of American culture and experience.</p>\n<p>Butler renders her figures in brilliant, mixed-media textures and vivid patterns that draw attention to expressions and interactions. The artist describes her recent work as a “visual diary,” which she turns to for solace. “Protections and programs for non-white Americans, women, queer people, poor people, and people with disabilities are under attack, and it has left me feeling destabilized,” she says.</p>\n<p>In the face of uncertainty, the artist summons affection and care. “Les Amoureux du Kinshasa,” after a photo titled “Amoureux Au Nightclub” by Jean Depara, celebrates young love by depicting a couple on a night out. More works like “Be Mine” and “My Cherie Amour” capture tender portraits of people who lean close together.</p>\n<figure><img src=\"https://www.thisiscolossal.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/butler-3.jpg\" alt=\"a quilted artwork by Bisa Butler featuring two young Black people standing affectionately together, inspired by a photograph by Jean Depara\" srcset=\"https://www.thisiscolossal.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/butler-3.jpg 2000w, https://www.thisiscolossal.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/butler-3-640x1008.jpg 640w, https://www.thisiscolossal.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/butler-3-960x1512.jpg 960w, https://www.thisiscolossal.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/butler-3-768x1210.jpg 768w, https://www.thisiscolossal.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/butler-3-975x1536.jpg 975w, https://www.thisiscolossal.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/butler-3-1300x2048.jpg 1300w\" /><figcaption>“Les Amoureux du Kinshasa” (2025), after Jean Depara, “Amoureux Au Nightclub” (1951-1975), cotton, silk, lace, sequins, netting, vinyl, glass rhinestones, plastic beads, and velvet, quilted and appliquéd, 95 x 59 inches</figcaption></figure>\n<p>Butler’s compositions also explore familial endearment and the innocence and ease of children at play together. In “The Guardian,” a father warms his daughter inside of his large coat, and in “Down, down baby,” two young girls have an impromptu tea party in a puddle.</p>\n<p>Most of Butler’s new works start with a base of jet black cotton or black velvet, onto which she layers colors and textures. “Using a dark base pushed me to incorporate more fabrics with shimmer and reflective qualities,” she says. Three-dimensional textures like beads and rhinestones create the illusion of depth, encouraging us to look beyond the immediate surface. This poetically parallels how, in order to identify and connect with others in our daily lives, we must do the same. Butler says, “This collection is my visual declaration that we need love over hate.”</p>\n<p><em>Hold Me Close </em>continues at Jeffrey Deitch’s Los Angeles location through November 1.

Observing the architecture and flora around his home in the Nizhny Novgorod region of Russia, he taught himself how to draw and eventually began assembling small sculptures.</p>\n<p>The hobby quickly morphed into a passion for creating miniature realms in which diminutive structures jumble, float, and balance on one another, sometimes complemented by moss and slender coniferous trees. Inspired by the vernacular of northern climes, his houses resemble the small, stilted structures one might encounter in coastal villages in Greenland, for example, or the traditional <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Izba\" target=\"_blank\">timber dwellings</a> of Russian farmsteads.</p>\n<figure><img src=\"https://www.thisiscolossal.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/davydov-7.jpeg\" alt=\"a miniature sculpture by Michael Davydov of a stack of tiny houses inside of a glass dome\" srcset=\"https://www.thisiscolossal.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/davydov-7.jpeg 2000w, https://www.thisiscolossal.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/davydov-7-640x854.jpeg 640w, https://www.thisiscolossal.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/davydov-7-960x1282.jpeg 960w, https://www.thisiscolossal.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/davydov-7-768x1025.jpeg 768w, https://www.thisiscolossal.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/davydov-7-1151x1536.jpeg 1151w, https://www.thisiscolossal.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/davydov-7-1534x2048.jpeg 1534w\" /></figure>\n<p>Davydov often encases his scenes in glass, using domes or vials that lend the impression of delicate specimens being collected and preserved.
