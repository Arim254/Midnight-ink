Run by the Vic­to­ria and Albert Muse­um, to which Bowie left an archive of about 90,000 of his pos­ses­sions, this new insti­tu­tion will show a few hun­dred of those arti­facts at a time, and even make a range of them avail­able on request to vis­i­tors. As for what exact­ly is in there, Jes­si­ca the Muse­um Guide makes a brief sur­vey of the Bowieana cur­rent­ly on dis­play in <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aWOw884dPW4\">the video above</a>.</p>\n<p>Some of the fea­tured objects, like the suits Bowie wore in his videos for “Life on Mars?” and “Let’s Dance” or the crys­tal ball he held aloft as Jareth the Gob­lin King in <em>Labyrinth</em>, may well be rec­og­niz­able even to casu­al Bowie appre­ci­a­tors. Longer-term fans will sure­ly rec­og­nize the out­landish but ele­gant Kan­sai Yamamo­to-designed cos­tumes that visu­al­ly defined per­son­ae like <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.openculture.com/2022/06/ziggy-stardust-turns-50.html\">Zig­gy Star­dust</a> and <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.openculture.com/2022/03/how-aladdin-sane-became-the-most-expensive-album-cover-ever-and-david-bowies-defining-image.html\">Aladdin Sane</a>, the Alexan­der McQueen-designed Union Jack frock from the cov­er of <em>Earth­ling</em>, and per­haps even the met­al angel wings Bowie donned onstage dur­ing the high­ly ambi­tious but much-derid­ed Glass Spi­der Tour of the late nine­teen-eight­ies.</p>\n<p>Going deep­er, there’s also the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stylophone\">Sty­lo­phone</a>, a kind of toy elec­tron­ic instru­ment from the late six­ties, that Bowie used on “Space Odd­i­ty” (and had to repur­chase on eBay); the much more pro­fes­sion­al-grade EMS suit­case syn­the­siz­er giv­en to him by Bri­an Eno, which he used on the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.openculture.com/2014/09/david-bowie-brian-enos-collaboration-on-warszawa-reimagined-in-comic-animation.html\">“Berlin tril­o­gy”</a> albums they made togeth­er; the per­son­al deck of <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.openculture.com/2018/12/behold-original-deck-oblique-strategies-cards-handwritten-brian-eno.html\">Oblique Strate­gies</a>, co-cre­at­ed by Eno, that shows signs of inten­sive use in Bowie’s own cre­ative process; his cor­re­spon­dence with <em>Let’s Dance</em> pro­duc­er Nile Rodgers (a cura­tor of the Bowie Cen­ter’s cur­rent exhi­bi­tion), about their sec­ond album <em>Black Tie White Noise</em>; and mate­ri­als from <em>Omikron: The Nomad Soul</em>, the com­put­er game to which he con­tributed music as well as a dig­i­tized per­for­mance in the late nineties.</p>\n<p>The col­lec­tion that Bowie donat­ed to the V&A already came care­ful­ly orga­nized and cat­a­loged, which shows a metic­u­lous­ness uncom­mon to rock stars, and a delib­er­ate­ness about not just cul­ti­vat­ing his pub­lic image at any giv­en cul­tur­al moment, but also active­ly curat­ing the mate­ri­als of his own his­tor­i­cal nar­ra­tive. It seems Bowie always had one eye on the past: his own, of course, but also more dis­tant eras, rich with dis­used aes­thet­ics to revive and make his own. The oth­er eye he kept on the future, espe­cial­ly as <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.openculture.com/2024/07/david-bowie-predicts-the-good-bad-of-the-internet-1999.html\">the inter­net</a> was grow­ing into a cul­tur­al force.

These are all fea­tures of Amer­i­can life in 2025. But our nation has also seen this movie play before, most notably back in the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gilded_Age\">Gild­ed Age</a>, which ran from the 1870s through the late 1890s. Above, we have a free two-hour doc­u­men­tary on the Gild­ed Age cre­at­ed by PBS. They <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/americanexperience/films/gilded-age/\">write</a>:</p>\n<blockquote><p>In the clos­ing decades of the nine­teenth cen­tu­ry, dur­ing what has become known as the Gild­ed Age, the pop­u­la­tion of the Unit­ed States dou­bled in the span of a sin­gle gen­er­a­tion. The nation became the world’s lead­ing pro­duc­er of food, coal, oil, and steel, attract­ed vast amounts of for­eign invest­ment, and pushed into mar­kets in Europe and the Far East. As nation­al wealth expand­ed, two class­es rose simul­ta­ne­ous­ly, sep­a­rat­ed by a gulf of expe­ri­ence and cir­cum­stance that was unprece­dent­ed in Amer­i­can life. These dis­par­i­ties sparked pas­sion­ate and vio­lent debate over ques­tions still being asked in our own times: How is wealth best dis­trib­uted, and by what process? Does gov­ern­ment exist to pro­tect pri­vate prop­er­ty or pro­vide balm to the inevitable casu­al­ties of a churn­ing indus­tri­al sys­tem? Should the gov­ern­ment con­cern itself chiefly with eco­nom­ic growth or eco­nom­ic jus­tice? The bat­tles over these ques­tions were fought in Con­gress, the courts, the polling place, the work­place and the streets. The out­come of these dis­putes was both uncer­tain and momen­tous, and marked by a pas­sion­ate vit­ri­ol and lev­el of vio­lence that would shock the con­science of many Amer­i­cans today. The Gild­ed Age presents a com­pelling and com­plex sto­ry of one of the most con­vul­sive and trans­for­ma­tive eras in Amer­i­can his­to­ry.</p></blockquote>\n<p>To a cer­tain degree, this doc­u­men­tary will help you make bet­ter sense of our own fraught times and per­haps feel more opti­mistic about where we might end up. (It’s worth keep­ing in mind that the dis­rup­tions of the Gild­ed Age even­tu­al­ly gave way to the reforms of the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Progressive_Era\">Pro­gres­sive Era</a>.)

    "body": "<section>\n<article>\n\t<div>\n<p>In many parts of rural America, the population keeps <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2023/07/07/1186531913/fighting-population-loss-in-the-shrinking-rural-u-s\" target=\"_blank\">shrinking</a>. Low birth rates, aging residents, and evolving or shuttering industries pair with a trend of younger people migrating to metro areas for jobs and more diverse cultural amenities. As of 2022, the U.S. Census Bureau estimated that there are more than 15 million abandoned houses around the country, which have been left for myriad reasons ranging from foreclosures to structural issues to the death of inhabitants with no one else able or willing to shoulder the responsibility of a home and its furnishings.</p>\n<p>Photographer <a href=\"https://www.bryansansivero.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Bryan Sansivero</a> feels a strong pull to document and explore forgotten dwellings. His new book forthcoming from Artisan, <em>America the Abandoned</em>, explores deserted homes around the country in 200 striking images. From interiors strewn with garments, toys, knick-knacks, and decor to empty farmhouses gradually sagging into the prairie, he captures a spectral phenomenon ripe for storytelling.</p>\n<figure><img src=\"https://www.thisiscolossal.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/abandoned-9.jpg\" alt=\"a photo of an abandoned house by Bryan Sansivero\" srcset=\"https://www.thisiscolossal.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/abandoned-9.jpg 2000w, https://www.thisiscolossal.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/abandoned-9-640x628.jpg 640w, https://www.thisiscolossal.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/abandoned-9-960x942.jpg 960w, https://www.thisiscolossal.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/abandoned-9-768x754.jpg 768w, https://www.thisiscolossal.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/abandoned-9-1536x1508.jpg 1536w\" /><figcaption>“The House at the End of the Street”</figcaption></figure>\n<p>Sansivero’s practice also revolves around portraiture, which lends itself to his approach of capturing these once-occupied houses. Although devoid of people, their enigmatic stories and vernacular personalities resonate through aged clapboard walls, overgrown shrubs, and forsaken belongings.</p>\n<p>The images range from misty, haunting facades to everyday interiors. “These spaces are often littered with dust, mold, and creepy crawlies, and occasionally, they house one-of-a-kind relics: a tiger skin rug, a commemorative bicentennial piano, or a collection of mannequins,” the publisher says. “Taken together, this photographic collection serves as a time capsule—as an eerie reminder that everything we own is temporary and will eventually be forgotten.”</p>\n<p><em>America the Abandoned </em>is slated for release on October 14.

    "body": "<section>\n<article>\n\t<div>\n<p><a href=\"https://beaumiles.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Beau Miles</a> is a nature-lover, adventurer, and a self-described oddball who makes stuff from other people’s junk. Based in Australia, he delves into urban foraging on his <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/@BeauMiles\" target=\"_blank\">YouTube channel</a>, wrote a book called <em>The Backyard Adventurer, </em>and has made numerous films about everything from building a tiny cabin to exploring Sydney’s most polluted river. Miles also happened to plant a small, flourishing forest in one day.</p>\n<p>“Without being dramatic, it was easily the hardest thing I’ve ever done in a single day,” he says. “But it was also fun—and the kind of thing that shifted how I intend to use my ideas and my body as a force for good. It was practical, hard, and an outcomes-driven use of time and energy.”</p>\n<figure><p>\n<iframe width=\"500\" height=\"281\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/vVLxMJD232A?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\"></iframe>\n</p></figure>\n<p>Miles planted one tree per minute for 24 hours—that’s 1,440 in total—and when he made the <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbA-hoIuHM4\" target=\"_blank\">initial video</a>, he promised to return every two years to report on its progress. In a recent update, he revisits the 2021 marathon project, documenting the wildlife that has moved in, wandering beneath healthy, young trees, and building a small fire from scrounged wood.</p>\n<p>“This was a special day because I really felt like the project had landed,” Miles says. “I had a cup of tea in the new forest, from water boiled on a fire made from the forest itself. It’s perhaps the most profound cup of tea I’ve ever had.”</p>\n<p>Another video that Miles posted in July set a virtual one-month timer on an endeavor to turn his streaming channel into a force for good. With funds from advertising, he aims to purchase and plant even more trees.

    "body": "<section>\n<article>\n\t<div>\n<p>Just outside Brussels, an ancient woodland known as the <a href=\"https://www.sonianforest.be/\" target=\"_blank\">Sonian Forest</a> spans almost 11,000 acres and includes some of the world’s most impressive beech groves. For photographer <a href=\"https://www.fredericdemeuse.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Frédéric Demeuse</a>, who grew up in Belgium’s capital, it’s a familiar yet perpetually alluring place. “This is where I made my first naturalist observations,” he tells Colossal, spotting squirrels, amphibians, and birds that sparked his childhood fascination.</p>\n<p>In dreamy photographs, Demeuse explores increasingly rare, remote pockets of nature in his ongoing series <em>Forgotten Places.</em> He documents these areas to create a visual record of forests and landscapes that require careful preservation, not only for the flora and fauna that reside there but for human health and mental wellness, too. Over the past 200 years, our connection to nature has dwindled by a mind-boggling <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2025/aug/09/human-connection-to-nature-has-declined-60-in-200-years-study-finds\" target=\"_blank\">60 percent</a> overall, risking what University of Derby professor Miles Richardson calls an “extinction of experience.”</p>\n<figure><img src=\"https://www.thisiscolossal.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/demeuse-3.jpg\" alt=\"a photograph by Frédéric Demeuse of moss-covered fallen trees in a dense forest\" srcset=\"https://www.thisiscolossal.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/demeuse-3.jpg 2048w, https://www.thisiscolossal.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/demeuse-3-640x427.jpg 640w, https://www.thisiscolossal.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/demeuse-3-960x640.jpg 960w, https://www.thisiscolossal.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/demeuse-3-768x512.jpg 768w, https://www.thisiscolossal.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/demeuse-3-1536x1024.jpg 1536w\" /></figure>\n<p>Exploring beautiful environments and communing with green spaces helps Demeuse feel connected to the land he traverses and encourages him to be more intentional about how he approaches relationships and daily life. Focusing on essential and deceptively simple views of trees and plants is a means to “inspire respect for the extraordinary complexity of the living world and remind us to stay humble,” he says.</p>\n<p>While Demeuse enjoys returning to familiar locations to see how they organically transform and go through seasonal cycles, he has also explored landscapes in other parts of the world. “There is nothing that reconnects you more to wilderness than contact with a real forest,” he says, especially immersing oneself amid old-growth trees that have witnessed centuries of change, yet seem to exist in a state of timelessness. </p>\n<p>No matter the place, the goal is always the same: to connect with the primordial sense of wonder at nature. He says, “The outside world is constantly calling us—you’d have to be crazy to miss that!”</p>\n<p>Explore much more on Demeuse’s <a href=\"https://www.fredericdemeuse.com/\" target=\"_blank\">website</a> and <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/fredericdemeuse/\" target=\"_blank\">Instagram</a>.</p>\n<figure><img src=\"https://www.thisiscolossal.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/demeuse-7.jpg\" alt=\"a photograph by Frédéric Demeuse of a misty hillside wooded area in the Scottish Highlands\" srcset=\"https://www.thisiscolossal.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/demeuse-7.jpg 2048w, https://www.thisiscolossal.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/demeuse-7-640x427.jpg 640w, https://www.thisiscolossal.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/demeuse-7-960x640.jpg 960w, https://www.thisiscolossal.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/demeuse-7-768x512.jpg 768w, https://www.thisiscolossal.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/demeuse-7-1536x1024.jpg 1536w\" /></figure>\n<figure><img src=\"https://www.thisiscolossal.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/demeuse-8.jpg\" alt=\"a photograph by Frédéric Demeuse of bumpy, moss-covered ground\" srcset=\"https://www.thisiscolossal.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/demeuse-8.jpg 2048w, https://www.thisiscolossal.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/demeuse-8-640x427.jpg 640w, https://www.thisiscolossal.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/demeuse-8-960x640.jpg 960w, https://www.thisiscolossal.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/demeuse-8-768x512.jpg 768w, https://www.thisiscolossal.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/demeuse-8-1536x1024.jpg 1536w\" /></figure>\n<figure><img src=\"https://www.thisiscolossal.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/demeuse-2.jpg\" alt=\"a photograph by Frédéric Demeuse of moss-covered trees in a dense forest\" srcset=\"https://www.thisiscolossal.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/demeuse-2.jpg 2048w, https://www.thisiscolossal.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/demeuse-2-640x427.jpg 640w, https://www.thisiscolossal.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/demeuse-2-960x640.jpg 960w, https://www.thisiscolossal.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/demeuse-2-768x512.jpg 768w, https://www.thisiscolossal.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/demeuse-2-1536x1024.jpg 1536w\" /></figure>\n<figure><img src=\"https://www.thisiscolossal.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/demeuse-6.jpg\" alt=\"a photograph by Frédéric Demeuse of moss-covered trees in a dense forest\" srcset=\"https://www.thisiscolossal.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/demeuse-6.jpg 2048w, https://www.thisiscolossal.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/demeuse-6-640x427.jpg 640w, https://www.thisiscolossal.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/demeuse-6-960x641.jpg 960w, https://www.thisiscolossal.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/demeuse-6-768x513.jpg 768w, https://www.thisiscolossal.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/demeuse-6-1536x1025.jpg 1536w\" /></figure>\n<figure><img src=\"https://www.thisiscolossal.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/demeuse-1.jpg\" alt=\"a photograph by Frédéric Demeuse of moss-covered trees in a dense forest\" srcset=\"https://www.thisiscolossal.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/demeuse-1.jpg 2048w, https://www.thisiscolossal.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/demeuse-1-640x427.jpg 640w, https://www.thisiscolossal.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/demeuse-1-960x640.jpg 960w, https://www.thisiscolossal.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/demeuse-1-768x512.jpg 768w, https://www.thisiscolossal.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/demeuse-1-1536x1024.jpg 1536w\" /></figure>\n<figure><img src=\"https://www.thisiscolossal.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/demeuse-5.jpg\" alt=\"a photograph by Frédéric Demeuse of moss-covered trees in a dense forest\" srcset=\"https://www.thisiscolossal.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/demeuse-5.jpg 2048w, https://www.thisiscolossal.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/demeuse-5-640x427.jpg 640w, https://www.thisiscolossal.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/demeuse-5-960x640.jpg 960w, https://www.thisiscolossal.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/demeuse-5-768x512.jpg 768w, https://www.thisiscolossal.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/demeuse-5-1536x1024.jpg 1536w\" /></figure>\n\t</div>\n\t</article>\n\t</section>"
