And most of them were artists too of one kind or anoth­er. Sci­en­tists had to learn to draw in order to illus­trate their find­ings before mass-pro­duced pho­tog­ra­phy and com­put­er imag­ing could do it for them.

Oh, and check out his art—his bril­liant­ly col­ored, ele­gant­ly ren­dered, high­ly styl­ized depic­tions of “far flung flo­ra and fau­na,” of microbes and nat­ur­al pat­terns, in designs that inspired the Art Nou­veau move­ment. “Each organ­ism Haeck­el drew has an almost abstract form,” notes Kather­ine Schwab at <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.fastcompany.com/90152188/these-gorgeous-19th-century-drawings-of-microbes-are-science-and-art\">Fast Co.

These are all fea­tures of Amer­i­can life in 2025. But our nation has also seen this movie play before, most notably back in the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gilded_Age\">Gild­ed Age</a>, which ran from the 1870s through the late 1890s. Above, we have a free two-hour doc­u­men­tary on the Gild­ed Age cre­at­ed by PBS. They <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/americanexperience/films/gilded-age/\">write</a>:</p>\n<blockquote><p>In the clos­ing decades of the nine­teenth cen­tu­ry, dur­ing what has become known as the Gild­ed Age, the pop­u­la­tion of the Unit­ed States dou­bled in the span of a sin­gle gen­er­a­tion. The nation became the world’s lead­ing pro­duc­er of food, coal, oil, and steel, attract­ed vast amounts of for­eign invest­ment, and pushed into mar­kets in Europe and the Far East. As nation­al wealth expand­ed, two class­es rose simul­ta­ne­ous­ly, sep­a­rat­ed by a gulf of expe­ri­ence and cir­cum­stance that was unprece­dent­ed in Amer­i­can life. These dis­par­i­ties sparked pas­sion­ate and vio­lent debate over ques­tions still being asked in our own times: How is wealth best dis­trib­uted, and by what process? Does gov­ern­ment exist to pro­tect pri­vate prop­er­ty or pro­vide balm to the inevitable casu­al­ties of a churn­ing indus­tri­al sys­tem? Should the gov­ern­ment con­cern itself chiefly with eco­nom­ic growth or eco­nom­ic jus­tice? The bat­tles over these ques­tions were fought in Con­gress, the courts, the polling place, the work­place and the streets. The out­come of these dis­putes was both uncer­tain and momen­tous, and marked by a pas­sion­ate vit­ri­ol and lev­el of vio­lence that would shock the con­science of many Amer­i­cans today. The Gild­ed Age presents a com­pelling and com­plex sto­ry of one of the most con­vul­sive and trans­for­ma­tive eras in Amer­i­can his­to­ry.</p></blockquote>\n<p>To a cer­tain degree, this doc­u­men­tary will help you make bet­ter sense of our own fraught times and per­haps feel more opti­mistic about where we might end up. (It’s worth keep­ing in mind that the dis­rup­tions of the Gild­ed Age even­tu­al­ly gave way to the reforms of the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Progressive_Era\">Pro­gres­sive Era</a>.)

Run by the Vic­to­ria and Albert Muse­um, to which Bowie left an archive of about 90,000 of his pos­ses­sions, this new insti­tu­tion will show a few hun­dred of those arti­facts at a time, and even make a range of them avail­able on request to vis­i­tors.

It seems Bowie always had one eye on the past: his own, of course, but also more dis­tant eras, rich with dis­used aes­thet­ics to revive and make his own.

    "body": "<section>\n<article>\n\t<div>\n<p>In many parts of rural America, the population keeps <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2023/07/07/1186531913/fighting-population-loss-in-the-shrinking-rural-u-s\" target=\"_blank\">shrinking</a>. Low birth rates, aging residents, and evolving or shuttering industries pair with a trend of younger people migrating to metro areas for jobs and more diverse cultural amenities. As of 2022, the U.S. Census bureau estimates there are more than 15 million abandoned houses around the country, which have been left for myriad reasons ranging from foreclosures to structural issues to the death of inhabitants with no one else able or willing to shoulder the responsibility of a home and its furnishings.</p>\n<p>Photographer <a href=\"https://www.bryansansivero.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Bryan Sansivero</a> feels a strong pull to document and explore forgotten dwellings. His new book forthcoming from Artisan, <em>America the Abandoned</em>, explores deserted homes around the country in 200 striking images. From interiors strewn with garments, toys, knick-knacks, and decor to empty farmhouses gradually sagging into the prairie, he captures a spectral phenomenon ripe for storytelling.</p>\n<figure><img src=\"https://www.thisiscolossal.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/abandoned-9.jpg\" alt=\"a photo of an abandoned house by Bryan Sansivero\" srcset=\"https://www.thisiscolossal.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/abandoned-9.jpg 2000w, https://www.thisiscolossal.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/abandoned-9-640x628.jpg 640w, https://www.thisiscolossal.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/abandoned-9-960x942.jpg 960w, https://www.thisiscolossal.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/abandoned-9-768x754.jpg 768w, https://www.thisiscolossal.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/abandoned-9-1536x1508.jpg 1536w\" /><figcaption>“The House at the End of the Street”</figcaption></figure>\n<p>Sansivero’s practice also revolves around portraiture, which lends itself to his approach of capturing these once-occupied houses. Although devoid of people, their enigmatic stories and vernacular personalities resonate through aged clapboard walls, overgrown shrubs, and forsaken belongings.</p>\n<p>The images range from misty, haunting facades to everyday interiors. “These spaces are often littered with dust, mold, and creepy crawlies, and occasionally, they house one-of-a-kind relics: a tiger skin rug, a commemorative bicentennial piano, or a collection of mannequins,” the publisher says. “Taken together, this photographic collection serves as a time capsule—as an eerie reminder that everything we own is temporary and will eventually be forgotten.”</p>\n<p><em>America the Abandoned </em>is slated for release on October 14.

    "body": "<section>\n<article>\n\t<div>\n<p>Just outside Brussels, an ancient woodland known as the <a href=\"https://www.sonianforest.be/\" target=\"_blank\">Sonian Forest</a> spans almost 11,000 acres and includes some of the world’s most impressive beech groves. For photographer <a href=\"https://www.fredericdemeuse.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Frédéric Demeuse</a>, who grew up in Belgium’s capital, it’s a familiar yet perpetually alluring place. “This is where I made my first naturalist observations,” he tells Colossal, spotting squirrels, amphibians, and birds that sparked his childhood fascination.</p>\n<p>In dreamy photographs, Demeuse explores increasingly rare, remote pockets of nature in his ongoing series <em>Forgotten Places.</em> He documents these areas to create a visual record of forests and landscapes that require careful preservation, not only for the flora and fauna that reside there but for human health and mental wellness, too. Over the past 200 years, our connection to nature has dwindled by a mind-boggling <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2025/aug/09/human-connection-to-nature-has-declined-60-in-200-years-study-finds\" target=\"_blank\">60 percent</a> overall, risking what University of Derby professor Miles Richardson calls an “extinction of experience.”</p>\n<figure><img src=\"https://www.thisiscolossal.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/demeuse-3.jpg\" alt=\"a photograph by Frédéric Demeuse of moss-covered fallen trees in a dense forest\" srcset=\"https://www.thisiscolossal.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/demeuse-3.jpg 2048w, https://www.thisiscolossal.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/demeuse-3-640x427.jpg 640w, https://www.thisiscolossal.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/demeuse-3-960x640.jpg 960w, https://www.thisiscolossal.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/demeuse-3-768x512.jpg 768w, https://www.thisiscolossal.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/demeuse-3-1536x1024.jpg 1536w\" /></figure>\n<p>Exploring beautiful environments and communing with green spaces helps Demeuse feel connected to the land he traverses and encourages him to be more intentional about how he approaches relationships and daily life. Focusing on essential and deceptively simple views of trees and plants is a means to “inspire respect for the extraordinary complexity of the living world and remind us to stay humble,” he says.</p>\n<p>While Demeuse enjoys returning to familiar locations to see how they organically transform and go through seasonal cycles, he has also explored landscapes in other parts of the world. “There is nothing that reconnects you more to wilderness than contact with a real forest,” he says, especially immersing oneself amid old-growth trees that have witnessed centuries of change, yet seem to exist in a state of timelessness. </p>\n<p>No matter the place, the goal is always the same: to connect with the primordial sense of wonder at nature. He says, “The outside world is constantly calling us—you’d have to be crazy to miss that!”</p>\n<p>Explore much more on Demeuse’s <a href=\"https://www.fredericdemeuse.com/\" target=\"_blank\">website</a> and <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/fredericdemeuse/\" target=\"_blank\">Instagram</a>.</p>\n<figure><img src=\"https://www.thisiscolossal.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/demeuse-7.jpg\" alt=\"a photograph by Frédéric Demeuse of a misty hillside wooded area in the Scottish Highlands\" srcset=\"https://www.thisiscolossal.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/demeuse-7.jpg 2048w, https://www.thisiscolossal.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/demeuse-7-640x427.jpg 640w, https://www.thisiscolossal.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/demeuse-7-960x640.jpg 960w, https://www.thisiscolossal.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/demeuse-7-768x512.jpg 768w, https://www.thisiscolossal.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/demeuse-7-1536x1024.jpg 1536w\" /></figure>\n<figure><img src=\"https://www.thisiscolossal.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/demeuse-8.jpg\" alt=\"a photograph by Frédéric Demeuse of bumpy, moss-covered ground\" srcset=\"https://www.thisiscolossal.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/demeuse-8.jpg 2048w, https://www.thisiscolossal.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/demeuse-8-640x427.jpg 640w, https://www.thisiscolossal.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/demeuse-8-960x640.jpg 960w, https://www.thisiscolossal.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/demeuse-8-768x512.jpg 768w, https://www.thisiscolossal.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/demeuse-8-1536x1024.jpg 1536w\" /></figure>\n<figure><img src=\"https://www.thisiscolossal.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/demeuse-2.jpg\" alt=\"a photograph by Frédéric Demeuse of moss-covered trees in a dense forest\" srcset=\"https://www.thisiscolossal.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/demeuse-2.jpg 2048w, https://www.thisiscolossal.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/demeuse-2-640x427.jpg 640w, https://www.thisiscolossal.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/demeuse-2-960x640.jpg 960w, https://www.thisiscolossal.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/demeuse-2-768x512.jpg 768w, https://www.thisiscolossal.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/demeuse-2-1536x1024.jpg 1536w\" /></figure>\n<figure><img src=\"https://www.thisiscolossal.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/demeuse-6.jpg\" alt=\"a photograph by Frédéric Demeuse of moss-covered trees in a dense forest\" srcset=\"https://www.thisiscolossal.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/demeuse-6.jpg 2048w, https://www.thisiscolossal.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/demeuse-6-640x427.jpg 640w, https://www.thisiscolossal.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/demeuse-6-960x641.jpg 960w, https://www.thisiscolossal.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/demeuse-6-768x513.jpg 768w, https://www.thisiscolossal.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/demeuse-6-1536x1025.jpg 1536w\" /></figure>\n<figure><img src=\"https://www.thisiscolossal.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/demeuse-1.jpg\" alt=\"a photograph by Frédéric Demeuse of moss-covered trees in a dense forest\" srcset=\"https://www.thisiscolossal.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/demeuse-1.jpg 2048w, https://www.thisiscolossal.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/demeuse-1-640x427.jpg 640w, https://www.thisiscolossal.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/demeuse-1-960x640.jpg 960w, https://www.thisiscolossal.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/demeuse-1-768x512.jpg 768w, https://www.thisiscolossal.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/demeuse-1-1536x1024.jpg 1536w\" /></figure>\n<figure><img src=\"https://www.thisiscolossal.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/demeuse-5.jpg\" alt=\"a photograph by Frédéric Demeuse of moss-covered trees in a dense forest\" srcset=\"https://www.thisiscolossal.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/demeuse-5.jpg 2048w, https://www.thisiscolossal.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/demeuse-5-640x427.jpg 640w, https://www.thisiscolossal.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/demeuse-5-960x640.jpg 960w, https://www.thisiscolossal.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/demeuse-5-768x512.jpg 768w, https://www.thisiscolossal.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/demeuse-5-1536x1024.jpg 1536w\" /></figure>\n\t</div>\n\t</article>\n\t</section>"

This line of inquiry grounds a large-scale exhibition by <a href=\"https://www.rauldelara.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Raul De Lara</a> in which he presents his surreal sculptures that merge flora and furnishings. </p>\n<p><em>HOST</em>, on view now at <a href=\"https://thecontemporaryaustin.org/\" target=\"_blank\">The Contemporary Austin</a>, brings together a collection of works that call into question belonging and identity and rejects the idea that state borders are fixed and natural. Using wood endemic to Texas and Mexico, De Lara sculpts potted monsteras sprouting from chains, a schooldesk covered in long spines, and a cactus disguised as a child’s rocking horse. </p>\n<p>The resulting pieces translate what should be a common object—a shovel, for example, or an enormous cluster of daisies in a vase—into the strange and uncanny. Many works are also rendered unusable, including a spiked ladder even the bravest among us would hesitate to climb.</p>\n<figure><img src=\"https://www.thisiscolossal.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Wilt-detail.jpg\" alt=\"a wooden monstera leaf by raul de lara that's browning at the edges\" srcset=\"https://www.thisiscolossal.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Wilt-detail.jpg 2000w, https://www.thisiscolossal.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Wilt-detail-640x960.jpg 640w, https://www.thisiscolossal.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Wilt-detail-960x1440.jpg 960w, https://www.thisiscolossal.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Wilt-detail-768x1152.jpg 768w, https://www.thisiscolossal.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Wilt-detail-1024x1536.jpg 1024w, https://www.thisiscolossal.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Wilt-detail-1365x2048.jpg 1365w\" /><figcaption>Detail of “Wilt” (2022), walnut, pine, red oak, urethane, pigment, and polyurethane, 125 x 25 1/4 x 45 inches</figcaption></figure>\n<p>Now based in Ridgewood, Queens, De Lara grew up near Austin as a child of Mexican immigrants. He first learned woodoworking in his family’s shop, which he describes as “a world where each tool has its own language, each piece of wood shows the passing of time on its skin, and where one is able to communicate through their hands.” A strong belief in animism, luck, and the paranormal pervaded this sacred space and taught the budding artist that he could harness the energy of a particular material to create beautiful objects. </p>\n<p>Today, he sees woodworking as a mode of storytelling, one in which magical realism flourishes. “I welcome the idea that artworks can hold their own spark of life and extend it to us,” De Lara says, adding: </p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>When I make my work, I remember childhood memories of when I would see local carvers turn branches into saints. I always wondered at what point in<br />the carving process does the ghost enters that piece of wood. I strive to make works that invite a certain kind of trust and acceptance from the viewer, that let them live without our realm.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>As global concerns about immigration and human rights intensify, De Lara’s work is all the more relevant. The artist has DACA status and knows firsthand the precarity and swift change that comes with a new administration. </p>\n<figure><img src=\"https://www.thisiscolossal.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Lotion-in-your-lungs-2019.jpg\" alt=\"a cacti on a rocking base by Raul De Lara\" srcset=\"https://www.thisiscolossal.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Lotion-in-your-lungs-2019.jpg 2000w, https://www.thisiscolossal.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Lotion-in-your-lungs-2019-640x593.jpg 640w, https://www.thisiscolossal.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Lotion-in-your-lungs-2019-960x889.jpg 960w, https://www.thisiscolossal.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Lotion-in-your-lungs-2019-768x711.jpg 768w, https://www.thisiscolossal.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Lotion-in-your-lungs-2019-1536x1422.jpg 1536w\" /><figcaption>“Lotion In Your Lungs” (2019), pine, oak, wood glue, sand from Mexico/US border, acrylic, and<br />lacquer, 72 x 24 x 50 inches</figcaption></figure>\n<p>His sculptures capture a sense of whimsy and play that might seem in opposition to this reality, but for De Lara, woodworking, and traditional craft more broadly, is a superpower. “It cannot be taken away from you as it is not tied to location, politics, or laws. You carry it with you and can practice anywhere, with anyone, and oftentimes, it disarms differences amongst us,” he says.</p>\n<p>See <em>HOST</em> through January 11, 2026.
