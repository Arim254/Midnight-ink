But before that sem­i­nal film’s release, Fear was dis­cov­ered by John Belushi, who first caught the band on a local L.A. music show called <em><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://dangerousminds.net/comments/all_25_episodes_of_new_wave_theatre_are_online\">New Wave The­atre</a></em> in 1980. He tracked down Ving, who <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/inside-john-belushis-long-lost-punk-song-with-fear-20150910\">tells <em>Rolling Stone</em></a>, “we had a cou­ple of beers and became fast friends.” At the time, Belushi was at work on his com­e­dy <em><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://screencrush.com/the-other-neighbors-belushi-aykroyd/\">Neigh­bors</a></em> with Dan Aykroyd and con­tract­ed the band to record a song for the film (his last before his death in 1982).</p>\n<p>The film’s pro­duc­ers, <em>Rolling Stone</em> writes, “were appalled” by the song “and refused to use it,” so to make it up to Ving and com­pa­ny, Belushi pushed to have the band booked on <em>Sat­ur­day Night Live</em> on Hal­loween, 1981. The result­ing per­for­mance has become leg­endary for what hap­pened, and what didn’t, and led to Fear becom­ing, says Ving, “one of the esteemed mem­bers of the per­ma­nent­ly banned.” You can watch a clip above of the band play­ing “Beef Boloney” and “New York’s Alright if You Like Sax­o­phones” (intro­duced by Don­ald Pleas­ance), and just below see Ving in a clip from an inter­view show dis­cussing the ill-fat­ed gig.</p>\n<div>\n<p><span><iframe width=\"640\" height=\"505\" src=\"//www.youtube.com/embed/UqCxyC5QQBA?wmode=transparent&fs=1&hl=en&showsearch=0&rel=0&theme=dark\" frameborder=\"0\"></iframe></span>\n\t</p>\n</div>\n<p>Belushi stage-man­aged the band’s appear­ance, striv­ing for authen­tic­i­ty by bring­ing into the stu­dio what Ving calls “an actu­al punk rock audi­ence rather than just Mr. and Mrs. Mis­souri.” (That audi­ence includ­ed now-leg­ends Ian MacK­aye of Minor Threat and Fugazi, mem­bers of New York hard­core band the Cro-Mags, and Tesco Vee of the Meat­men.)  The result­ing mosh pit was noth­ing out of the ordi­nary for the typ­i­cal punk show. But, unsur­pris­ing­ly, “the real audi­ence at <em>Sat­ur­day Night Live</em> was scared to death,” says Ving, “They didn’t know what was hap­pen­ing with all the may­hem.”</p>\n<p>Dur­ing the riotous pro­ceed­ings, <em>SNL</em> pro­duc­er Dick Eber­sol “got hit in the chest with a pump­kin,” some equip­ment was dam­aged, and dur­ing the final song, “Let’s Have a War,” an audi­ence mem­ber grabbed the micro­phone and yelled out “F*ck New York!” The pro­fan­i­ty freaked out NBC, who cut the broad­cast short and shelved the footage for sev­er­al years. The <em>New York Post</em> lat­er quot­ed an unnamed NBC tech­ni­cian as say­ing, “This was a life-threat­en­ing sit­u­a­tion. They went crazy. It’s amaz­ing no one got killed.” The paper also quot­ed a fig­ure of $400,000 for dam­ages to the Rock­e­feller Cen­ter set.</p>\n<p>But as <em><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://books.google.com/books?id=9yQEAAAAMBAJ&lpg=PT14&ots=n8hOHBJ1Mg&dq=NY%20Post%20SNL%20Riot%20Fear&pg=PT14#v=onepage&q&f=false\">Bill­board </a></em><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://books.google.com/books?id=9yQEAAAAMBAJ&lpg=PT14&ots=n8hOHBJ1Mg&dq=NY%20Post%20SNL%20Riot%20Fear&pg=PT14#v=onepage&q&f=false\">report­ed two weeks lat­er</a>, the fig­ure was total­ly erro­neous (sup­plied to the <em>Post</em> by Ving as a prac­ti­cal joke, as he says above). “We had to pay $40 in labor penal­ties. That was the extent of it,” said <em>SNL</em> spokesman Peter Hamil­ton. As for the shock to view­ers, it seems the net­work received “all of 12 com­plaints” after the broad­cast. Ving him­self found the over­re­ac­tion ridicu­lous, and NBC’s long shelv­ing of the footage—only recent­ly made avail­able in a trun­cat­ed version—a humor­less mis­take. “They seem to be… los­ing the sense of humor about the whole idea,” he told <em>Rolling Stone</em>, “I had a sense of humor at the whole idea of start­ing Fear. It was extreme­ly humor­ous to me, and I think John saw that humor.”</p>\n<p>Indeed he did, but Belushi’s appre­ci­a­tion for Fear’s antics was ahead of its time. Now we can see, at least in part, what all the fuss was about. And we can also final­ly hear the long-shelved sin­gle for <em>Neigh­bors</em> that Belushi record­ed with the band.</p>\n<div>\n<p><span><iframe width=\"640\" height=\"505\" src=\"//www.youtube.com/embed/q55wNcD-Haw?wmode=transparent&fs=1&hl=en&showsearch=0&rel=0&theme=dark\" frameborder=\"0\"></iframe></span>\n\t</p>\n</div>\n<p>Note: An ear­li­er ver­sion of this post appeared on our site in 2016.</p>\n<p><strong>Relat­ed Con­tent:</strong></p>\n<p><a target=\"_blank\" title=\"Permanent Link to The Stunt That Got Elvis Costello Banned From <i>Saturday Night Live</i> (1977)\" href=\"https://www.openculture.com/2013/09/the-stunt-that-got-elvis-costello-banned-from-saturday-night-live.html\">The Stunt That Got Elvis Costel­lo Banned From <i>Sat­ur­day Night Live</i> (1977)</a></p>\n<p><a target=\"_blank\" title=\"Permanent Link to The Birth of the Blues Brothers: How Dan Aykroyd & John Belushi Started Introducing a New Generation to the Blues\" href=\"https://www.openculture.com/2022/04/the-birth-of-the-blues-brothers.html\">The Birth of the Blues Broth­ers: How Dan Aykroyd & John Belushi Start­ed Intro­duc­ing a New Gen­er­a­tion to the Blues</a></p>\n<p><a target=\"_blank\" title=\"Permanent Link to <i>Saturday Night Live</i>’s Very First Sketch: Watch John Belushi Launch SNL in October, 1975\" href=\"https://www.openculture.com/2021/03/saturday-night-lives-very-first-sketch.html\"><i>Sat­ur­day Night Live</i>’s Very First Sketch: Watch John Belushi Launch SNL in Octo­ber, 1975</a></p>\n<p><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://about.me/jonesjoshua\"><em>Josh Jones</em></a><em> is a writer and musi­cian based in Durham, NC. </em></p>\n<br />\t\t</div>"

Grant­ed, you may nev­er have read a page of it, to say noth­ing of an entire graph­ic nov­el­’s worth, but even so, you’ve absorbed it indi­rect­ly through gen­er­a­tions of inter­na­tion­al pop­u­lar cul­ture. If you enjoy <em>Blade Run­ner</em>, <em>Aki­ra</em>, the man­ga and ani­me of Hayao Miyaza­ki, and even the Star Wars movies, you must, on some lev­el, enjoy Moe­bius, so deeply did his com­ic art shape the look and feel of those major works, to say noth­ing of all it has inspired at fur­ther remove.</p>\n<p><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QWaCsteIYig\">The new video above by Youtu­ber matttt</a> goes in depth on the bio­graph­i­cal, cul­tur­al, and psy­cho­log­i­cal force that shaped the artist’s vision on the page, whose sheer imag­i­na­tive force and per­sis­tent­ly strange sub­lim­i­ty looked like noth­ing else in comics when he hit his stride in the nine­teen-sev­en­ties. It helped that he was French, and thus an inher­i­tor of the grand Fran­coph­o­ne tra­di­tion of the <em>bande dess­inée</em>, an art form tak­en much more seri­ous­ly than com­ic strips and books in Amer­i­ca. Bel­gian comics like <em>Spirou</em> and <em>Tintin </em>caught his atten­tion ear­ly on, and time spent as a teenag­er amid the vast desert land­scapes of Mex­i­co instilled him with a taste for spir­i­tu­al grandeur.</p>\n<p>An appren­tice­ship under the Bel­gian com­ic artist Joseph “Jijé” Gillain, whom he idol­ized, helped Giraud — who had not yet become Moe­bius — to refine his style.

Elec­tric gui­tars and feed­back gave way to clas­si­cal acoustics, vio­lin, piano, accor­dion, and even a saw. It was an inter­est­ing cul­tur­al jux­ta­po­si­tion in an evening of cul­tur­al jux­ta­po­si­tions. The sports and music did­n’t gel, but an odd sym­me­try emerged from the two bands’ con­trast­ing styles, to a degree. The instru­ment above, on the oth­er hand, would have fit right in with the sec­ond act, whose old world charm would sure­ly find a place for a 1679 guitar—one craft­ed by the leg­endary mas­ter luthi­er <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antonio_Stradivari\">Anto­nio Stradi­vari</a>, no less.</p>\n<p>If you know noth­ing at all about music or musi­cal instru­ments, you know the name Stradi­vari and the vio­lins that bear his name. They are such <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.openculture.com/2021/09/why-scientists-cant-recreate-the-sound-of-stradivarius-violins.html\">cov­et­ed, valu­able objects</a> they some­times appear as the tar­get of crime capers in the movies and on tele­vi­sion. This Stradi­var­ius gui­tar, called the “Sabionari,” is even rar­er than the vio­lins. The Stradi­vari fam­i­ly, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://forgottenguitar.com/2016/02/04/the-only-playable-stradivarius-guitar-left-in-the-world-the-sabionari-made-in-1679-video/\">writes For­got­ten Gui­tar</a>, “pro­duced over 1000 instru­ments, of which 960 were vio­lins.” Yet, “a small num­ber of gui­tars were also craft­ed, and as of today only one remains playable.” High­ly playable, you’ll observe in these videos, thanks to the restora­tion by luthiers Daniel Sinier, Fran­coise de Rid­der, and Loren­zo Frig­nani.</p>\n<p>In the clip just above, Baroque con­cert gui­tarist Rolf Lisl­e­vand plays San­ti­a­go de Mur­ci­a’s “Taran­tela” on the restored gui­tar, whose sonorous ring­ing tim­bre recalls anoth­er Baroque instru­ment, the harp­si­chord.</p>\n<div>\n<p><span><iframe width=\"640\" height=\"505\" src=\"//www.youtube.com/embed/YzyMcoltMwE?wmode=transparent&fs=1&hl=en&showsearch=0&rel=0&theme=dark\" frameborder=\"0\"></iframe></span>\n\t</p>\n</div>\n<p>So unique and unusu­al is the ten-string Stradi­var­ius Sabionari that it has <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://sabionari.com/\">its own web­site</a>, where you’ll find many detailed, close-up pho­tos of the ele­gant design as well as more music, like the piece above, Ange­lo Michele Bar­tolot­ti’s Suite in G Minor as per­formed by clas­si­cal gui­tarist Krish­na­sol Jiménez, who, along with Lisl­e­vand, has been entrust­ed with the instru­ment for many live per­for­mances. Owned by a pri­vate col­lec­tor, the Sabionari very often appears at lec­tures on restora­tion and con­ser­va­tion of clas­si­cal instru­ments, as well as in per­for­mances around Europe.

While Craig is based in New York, and Karl is based in London, the two collaborate across the pond—and around the world—to produce multimedia installations that revitalize urban spaces and celebrate the power of play.</p>\n<p>As part of the 2025 <a href=\"https://www.brisbanefestival.com.au/\" target=\"_blank\">Brisbane Festival</a>, Craig & Karl created a pair of large-scale inflatable interventions on two of the city’s bridges, both riffing on the idea of the arch as passageway. Additionally, numerous illustrations, interactive sculptures, and inflatable “Mateys” — a series of quirky characters with expressive faces — pop up on buildings and sidewalks to enable joyful encounters as part of the expansive, city-wide exhibition titled <em>Rear Vision.</em></p>\n<figure><img src=\"https://www.thisiscolossal.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/craig-karl-1.jpg\" alt=\"colorful, inflatable arches by Craig & Karl are installed on a long bridge in Bisbrane, illuminated at night\" srcset=\"https://www.thisiscolossal.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/craig-karl-1.jpg 1920w, https://www.thisiscolossal.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/craig-karl-1-640x427.jpg 640w, https://www.thisiscolossal.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/craig-karl-1-960x640.jpg 960w, https://www.thisiscolossal.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/craig-karl-1-768x512.jpg 768w, https://www.thisiscolossal.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/craig-karl-1-1536x1024.jpg 1536w\" /><figcaption>“Walk This Way” (2025), Kangaroo Point Bridge, Brisbane.

The expressive, flexible characters are also immanently relatable for viewers of all ages. “The Mateys serve as companions that help foster community and shared experiences, welcoming us into different corners of the city,” says a festival statement.</p>\n<p>Craig & Karl are known for their vivid participatory projects, which range from mini-golf courses to playgrounds to murals. The artists initially met 30 years ago while studying at Griffith University in Brisbane, and since, their collaborative practice has included partnerships with global brands and publications like Adidas, Nike, Apple, Chanel, <em>The New Yorker, Variety, </em>and more.</p>\n<p>While the bridge installations came to a close at the end of September, you can still stroll along the <em>Public Art Trail</em> through October 20 to spot Craig & Karl’s sculptures and installations in unexpected places. Then, drop by the exhibition <em>Double Vision </em>at the Griffith University Art Museum, which continues through January 7.</p>\n<p>Plot your course on the Brisbane Festival <a href=\"https://www.brisbanefestival.com.au/\" target=\"_blank\">website</a>, and see more of the artists’ projects on <a href=\"https://www.craigandkarl.com/\" target=\"_blank\">their site</a> and <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/craigandkarl\" target=\"_blank\">Instagram</a>.</p>\n<figure><img src=\"https://www.thisiscolossal.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/craig-karl-7-e1759328500449.jpg\" alt=\"a woman stands in front of an inflatable sculpture by Craig & Karl of abstract, worm-like forms with smiley faces\" srcset=\"https://www.thisiscolossal.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/craig-karl-7-e1759328500449.jpg 2000w, https://www.thisiscolossal.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/craig-karl-7-e1759328500449-640x823.jpg 640w, https://www.thisiscolossal.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/craig-karl-7-e1759328500449-960x1235.jpg 960w, https://www.thisiscolossal.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/craig-karl-7-e1759328500449-768x988.jpg 768w, https://www.thisiscolossal.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/craig-karl-7-e1759328500449-1194x1536.jpg 1194w, https://www.thisiscolossal.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/craig-karl-7-e1759328500449-1592x2048.jpg 1592w\" /><figcaption>“Mateys” (2025), part of ‘Rear Vision’ Public Art Trail, Brisbane.
