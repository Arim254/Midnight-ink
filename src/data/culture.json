I got you. “My man!” This is the moment in the film where Isaiah White, played by Marlon Wayans, is going to teach Cameron Cade, played by Tyriq Withers a lesson in how to be a great quarterback. In this lesson, I did a lot of research about quarterback drills that hone in on specific skills. For example, in a pro game, you want to be able to get the ball out of your hands under two seconds. So that’s why we have two seconds on the clock and to work on that speed that’s required of decision making. That’s why he’s turned away from the actual receivers. He has his eyes closed. So that you’re forced into a panic-like situation, and you have to throw the ball as quickly as possible. So what I really wanted to communicate in this scene specifically, was that there’s going to be a big tonal shift from something’s off to something’s very wrong, and it’s the first time we’re going to introduce violence and a dynamic between the two characters that becomes much more like a narcissistic, abusive relationship than a mentor-mentee “Too slow.” But seed it and bury that under the guise of hazing and just being a rookie. And what I landed on was this idea of using this JUGS machine to be that conduit of punishment. I also didn’t want him to have time to process anything. That’s why I kind of try to get music and a rhythm going in the edit. And even the sound design is rhythmic. That vibration and metallic clanking, it escalates and grows and grows over this entire sequence. And then we have these really tight, extreme close-ups of Cameron Cade’s eyes. And that was just a creative choice I made to rely on the language of horror, where there’s a classic peekaboo.</p></dd></dl></div></div></div>"

    "body": "<div><p>A court in South Korea has ordered a social media user to pay 500,000 won ($360; £265) for defaming a K-pop boyband - whose members are virtual characters.</p><p>The five members of K-pop group Plave are voiced and animated through motion-capture technology by real, anonymous performers.</p><p>Last year, Plave's agency filed a civil suit against against a social media user for making derogatory remarks about the group online.</p><p>The ruling by the court, handed down in May and made public on the court's website this month, is among the first to deal with virtual K-pop idols - an increasingly popular breed in South Korea's entertainment industry.</p></div><div><p>Plave, which debuted in 2023, is one of K-pop's most successful virtual stars, with more than one million followers on its YouTube channel where they regularly post music videos and vlogs.</p><p>They are also a regular at the country's biggest music awards. Their song Way 4 Luv was nominated for best vocal performance and song of the year at the 2024 MAMA Awards. This year, they won a major prize at the Seoul Music Awards.</p><p>In July 2024, the defendant targeted Plave in a series of posts - some containing profanity. Among them were comments that the people behind the avatars \"could be ugly in real life\" and gave off a \"typical Korean man vibe\", Korea Times reported.</p><p>The defendant claimed that the comments were aimed at the fictional characters and not the real people behind them.</p><p>But the court rejected the argument, saying that if an avatar was widely recognised to represent someone real, then attacks on the avatar also extended to the real person.</p><p>Plave's agency, Vlast, had asked for 6.5 million won for each of the five performers behind the group, saying that the comments had caused them emotional distress.</p><p>What the court granted them instead was a fraction of that: 100,000 won per person. The court said it had decided on the amount after considering the severity of the offending comments and the circumstances surrounding the incident, local media reported.</p><p>Vlast has appealed the damages stated by the court, arguing that the case set an important precedent for defamation of virtual avatars.</p><p>Advocates of virtual K-pop idols say the avatars can alleviate pressure from human idols, who face intense scrutiny over their personal lives.</p></div><p><i>Hosu Lee contributed reporting.</i></p>"
