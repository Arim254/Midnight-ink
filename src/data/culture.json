Elec­tric gui­tars and feed­back gave way to clas­si­cal acoustics, vio­lin, piano, accor­dion, and even a saw. It was an inter­est­ing cul­tur­al jux­ta­po­si­tion in an evening of cul­tur­al jux­ta­po­si­tions. The sports and music did­n’t gel, but an odd sym­me­try emerged from the two bands’ con­trast­ing styles, to a degree. The instru­ment above, on the oth­er hand, would have fit right in with the sec­ond act, whose old world charm would sure­ly find a place for a 1679 guitar—one craft­ed by the leg­endary mas­ter luthi­er <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antonio_Stradivari\">Anto­nio Stradi­vari</a>, no less.</p>\n<p>If you know noth­ing at all about music or musi­cal instru­ments, you know the name Stradi­vari and the vio­lins that bear his name.

This Stradi­var­ius gui­tar, called the “Sabionari,” is even rar­er than the vio­lins. The Stradi­vari fam­i­ly, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://forgottenguitar.com/2016/02/04/the-only-playable-stradivarius-guitar-left-in-the-world-the-sabionari-made-in-1679-video/\">writes For­got­ten Gui­tar</a>, “pro­duced over 1000 instru­ments, of which 960 were vio­lins.” Yet, “a small num­ber of gui­tars were also craft­ed, and as of today only one remains playable.” High­ly playable, you’ll observe in these videos, thanks to the restora­tion by luthiers Daniel Sinier, Fran­coise de Rid­der, and Loren­zo Frig­nani.</p>\n<p>In the clip just above, Baroque con­cert gui­tarist Rolf Lisl­e­vand plays San­ti­a­go de Mur­ci­a’s “Taran­tela” on the restored gui­tar, whose sonorous ring­ing tim­bre recalls anoth­er Baroque instru­ment, the harp­si­chord.</p>\n<div>\n<p><span><iframe width=\"640\" height=\"505\" src=\"//www.youtube.com/embed/YzyMcoltMwE?wmode=transparent&fs=1&hl=en&showsearch=0&rel=0&theme=dark\" frameborder=\"0\"></iframe></span>\n\t</p>\n</div>\n<p>So unique and unusu­al is the ten-string Stradi­var­ius Sabionari that it has <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://sabionari.com/\">its own web­site</a>, where you’ll find many detailed, close-up pho­tos of the ele­gant design as well as more music, like the piece above, Ange­lo Michele Bar­tolot­ti’s Suite in G Minor as per­formed by clas­si­cal gui­tarist Krish­na­sol Jiménez, who, along with Lisl­e­vand, has been entrust­ed with the instru­ment for many live per­for­mances.

Half a cen­tu­ry ago, she was just anoth­er young stage actress in New York, albeit one rapid­ly ascend­ing the rungs of the­atri­cal pres­tige, doing three Shake­speare plays and then star­ring in Weill, Haupt­mann, and Brecht’s <em>Hap­py End</em> on Broad­way. <em>The Deer Hunter</em>, <em>Kramer vs. Kramer</em>, <em>Out of Africa</em>,<em> Post­cards from the Edge</em>, <em>The Bridges of Madi­son Coun­ty</em>: all this lay in her future in 1976, the year of her fea­ture debut.</p>\n<p>Streep made that debut in <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AO5SixiWjZ4\"><em>Every­body Rides the Carousel</em></a>, a now-obscure ani­mat­ed film that dra­ma­tizes post-Freudi­an psy­chol­o­gist <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erik_Erikson\">Erik Erik­son</a>’s <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erikson%27s_stages_of_psychosocial_development\">eight stages of psy­choso­cial devel­op­ment</a>.

She acts out that age’s con­test of inti­ma­cy and iso­la­tion with Charles Levin, anoth­er up-and-com­er who would go on to achieve wide recog­ni­tion on tele­vi­sion shows like <em>Alice</em>, <em>Hill Street Blues</em>, and (<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rw4qZjkiV_A\">just once, but mem­o­rably</a>) <em>Sein­feld</em>.

Of those books, none is more wide­ly known to the pub­lic — or, still, more wide­ly read by the pub­lic — than <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://amzn.to/3KqONID\"><em>Cos­mos</em></a>, accom­pa­nied as it was by <em>Cos­mos: A Per­son­al Voy­age</em>, a com­pan­ion tele­vi­sion series on PBS. Sagan’s oth­er pop­u­lar books, like <em>Shad­ows of For­got­ten Ances­tors</em> or <em>Con­tact</em> (the basis of the 1997 Hol­ly­wood movie) are also well worth read­ing, but we per­haps ignore at our great­est per­il <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://amzn.to/4nrc8sg\"><em>The Demon-Haunt­ed World: Sci­ence as a Can­dle in the Dark</em></a>. Pub­lished in 1995, the year before Sagan’s death, it stands as his tes­ta­ment to the impor­tance of crit­i­cal, sci­en­tif­ic think­ing for all of us.</p>\n<p><em><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://amzn.to/4nrc8sg\">The Demon-Haunt­ed World</a> </em>is the sub­ject of the <em>Genet­i­cal­ly Mod­i­fied Skep­tic</em> video above, whose host Drew McCoy describes it as his favorite book. He pays spe­cial atten­tion to its chap­ter in which Sagan lays out what he calls his “baloney detec­tion kit.” This assem­bled metaphor­i­cal box of tools for diag­nos­ing fraud­u­lent argu­ments and con­struct­ing rea­soned ones involves these nine prin­ci­ples:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Wher­ev­er pos­si­ble there must be inde­pen­dent con­fir­ma­tion of the “facts.”</li>\n<li>Encour­age sub­stan­tive debate on the evi­dence by knowl­edge­able pro­po­nents of all points of view.</li>\n<li>Argu­ments from author­i­ty car­ry lit­tle weight — “author­i­ties” have made mis­takes in the past. They will do so again in the future. Per­haps a bet­ter way to say it is that in sci­ence there are no author­i­ties; at most, there are experts.</li>\n<li>Spin more than one hypoth­e­sis. If there’s some­thing to be explained, think of all the dif­fer­ent ways in which it could be explained. Then think of tests by which you might sys­tem­at­i­cal­ly dis­prove each of the alter­na­tives.</li>\n<li>Try not to get over­ly attached to a hypoth­e­sis just because it’s yours. It’s only a way sta­tion in the pur­suit of knowl­edge. Ask your­self why you like the idea. Com­pare it fair­ly with the alter­na­tives.</li>\n<li>See if you can find rea­sons for reject­ing it. If you don’t, oth­ers will.</li>\n<li>If what­ev­er it is you’re explain­ing has some mea­sure, some numer­i­cal quan­ti­ty attached to it, you’ll be much bet­ter able to dis­crim­i­nate among com­pet­ing hypothe­ses. What is vague and qual­i­ta­tive is open to many expla­na­tions.</li>\n<li>If there’s a chain of argu­ment, every link in the chain must work (includ­ing the premise) — not just most of them.</li>\n<li>Occam’s Razor. This con­ve­nient rule-of-thumb urges us when faced with two hypothe­ses that explain the data equal­ly well to choose the sim­pler. Always ask whether the hypoth­e­sis can be, at least in prin­ci­ple, fal­si­fied…. You must be able to check asser­tions out. Invet­er­ate skep­tics must be giv­en the chance to fol­low your rea­son­ing, to dupli­cate your exper­i­ments and see if they get the same result.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>As McCoy points out, these tech­niques of mind have to do with can­cel­ing out the man­i­fold bias­es present in our think­ing, those nat­ur­al human ten­den­cies that incline us to accept ideas that may or may not coin­cide with real­i­ty as it is. If we take no trou­ble to cor­rect for these bias­es, Sagan came to believe, we’ll become easy marks for all the trick­sters and char­la­tans who hap­pen to come our way. And that’s just on the micro lev­el: on the macro lev­el, vul­ner­a­bil­i­ty to delu­sion can <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.openculture.com/2025/02/carl-sagan-predicts-the-decline-of-america-unable-to-know-whats-true.html\">bring down entire civ­i­liza­tions</a>.</p>\n<p>“Like all tools, the baloney detec­tion kit can be mis­used, applied out of con­text, or even employed as a rote alter­na­tive to think­ing,” Sagan cau­tions. “But applied judi­cious­ly, it can make all the dif­fer­ence in the world — not least in eval­u­at­ing our own argu­ments before we present them to oth­ers.” McCoy urges us to heed these words, adding that “this kit is not some per­fect solu­tion to the world’s prob­lems, but as it’s been uti­lized over the last few cen­turies” — for its basic pre­cepts long pre­date Sagan’s par­tic­u­lar artic­u­la­tion — “it has enabled us to cre­ate tech­no­log­i­cal inno­va­tions and use­ful explana­to­ry mod­els of our world more quick­ly and effec­tive­ly than ever before.” The walls of baloney may always be clos­ing in on human­i­ty, but if you fol­low Sagan’s advice, you can at least give your­self some breath­ing room.</p>\n<p><strong>Relat­ed con­tent:</strong></p>\n<p><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.openculture.com/2020/12/carl-sagan-on-the-importance-of-choosing-wisely-what-you-read.html\">Carl Sagan on the Impor­tance of Choos­ing Wise­ly What You Read (Even If You Read a Book a Week)</a></p>\n<p><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.openculture.com/2018/01/carl-sagans-syllabus-final-exam-for-his-course-on-critical-thinking-cornell-1986.html\">Carl Sagan’s Syl­labus & Final Exam for His Course on Crit­i­cal Think­ing (Cor­nell, 1986)</a></p>\n<p><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.openculture.com/2025/02/carl-sagan-predicts-the-decline-of-america-unable-to-know-whats-true.html\">Carl Sagan Pre­dicts the Decline of Amer­i­ca: Unable to Know “What’s True,” We Will Slide, “With­out Notic­ing, Back into Super­sti­tion & Dark­ness” (1995)</a></p>\n<p><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.openculture.com/2024/08/richard-feynman-creates-a-simple-method-for-telling-science-from-pseudoscience.html\">Richard Feyn­man Cre­ates a Sim­ple Method for Telling Sci­ence From Pseu­do­science (1966)</a></p>\n<p><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.openculture.com/2023/07/how-to-spot-bullshit-a-manual-by-princeton-philosopher-harry-frankfurt-rip.html\">How to Spot Bull­shit: A Man­u­al by Prince­ton Philoso­pher Har­ry Frank­furt (RIP)</a></p>\n<p><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.openculture.com/critical-thinking-a-free-course\">Crit­i­cal Think­ing: A Free Course</a></p>\n<p><em>Based in Seoul, </em><em><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://blog.colinmarshall.org/\">Col­in</a></em><em><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://blog.colinmarshall.org/\"> M</a></em><em><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://blog.colinmarshall.org/\">a</a></em><em><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://blog.colinmarshall.org/\">rshall</a> writes and broad­cas</em><em>ts on cities, lan­guage, and cul­ture.

Grant­ed, you may nev­er have read a page of it, to say noth­ing of an entire graph­ic nov­el­’s worth, but even so, you’ve absorbed it indi­rect­ly through gen­er­a­tions of inter­na­tion­al pop­u­lar cul­ture. If you enjoy <em>Blade Run­ner</em>, <em>Aki­ra</em>, the man­ga and ani­me of Hayao Miyaza­ki, and even the Star Wars movies, you must, on some lev­el, enjoy Moe­bius, so deeply did his com­ic art shape the look and feel of those major works, to say noth­ing of all it has inspired at fur­ther remove.</p>\n<p><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QWaCsteIYig\">The new video above by Youtu­ber matttt</a> goes in depth on the bio­graph­i­cal, cul­tur­al, and psy­cho­log­i­cal force that shaped the artist’s vision on the page, whose sheer imag­i­na­tive force and per­sis­tent­ly strange sub­lim­i­ty looked like noth­ing else in comics when he hit his stride in the nine­teen-sev­en­ties. It helped that he was French, and thus an inher­i­tor of the grand Fran­coph­o­ne tra­di­tion of the <em>bande dess­inée</em>, an art form tak­en much more seri­ous­ly than com­ic strips and books in Amer­i­ca. Bel­gian comics like <em>Spirou</em> and <em>Tintin </em>caught his atten­tion ear­ly on, and time spent as a teenag­er amid the vast desert land­scapes of Mex­i­co instilled him with a taste for spir­i­tu­al grandeur.</p>\n<p>An appren­tice­ship under the Bel­gian com­ic artist Joseph “Jijé” Gillain, whom he idol­ized, helped Giraud — who had not yet become Moe­bius — to refine his style. His cre­ation of the Jean Paul Bel­mon­do-look­ing cow­boy Blue­ber­ry in the ear­ly nine­teen-six­ties pro­duced what turned out to be his most lucra­tive fran­chise.  But it was­n’t until his encounter with taboo-break­ing Amer­i­can “under­ground” comics that flour­ished lat­er in that decade, and espe­cial­ly the work of <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.openculture.com/2020/01/how-cartoons-saved-r-crumbs-life-and-how-r-crumb-turned-cartoons-into-an-art-form-nsfw.html\">Robert Crumb</a>, that he found it with­in him­self to let loose, explor­ing tech­no­log­i­cal, mytho­log­i­cal, and psy­cho­sex­u­al realms hith­er­to unknown in his medi­um.</p>\n<p>It was with the launch of the comics-anthol­o­gy mag­a­zine <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.openculture.com/2017/08/metal-hurlant.html\"><em>Métal Hurlant</em></a> in 1974, lat­er repack­aged in the Unit­ed States as <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.openculture.com/2018/03/a-digital-archive-of-heavy-metal.html\"><em>Heavy Met­al</em></a>, that Moe­bius’ work found its way to a much wider pub­lic. Notable read­ers includ­ed William Gib­son, Rid­ley Scott, Luc Besson, George Lucas, Ale­jan­dro Jodor­owsky, and the Wachowskis: some imi­tat­ed Moe­bius, and oth­ers hired him. Through the Japan­ese edi­tion of <em>Star­log</em> mag­a­zine in the late sev­en­ties, his art re-shaped the aes­thet­ics of <em>man­ga­ka</em> like <em>Aki­ra</em> cre­ator Kat­suhi­ro Oto­mo and Stu­dio Ghi­b­li co-founder Hayao Miyaza­ki. Moe­bius him­self lat­er took on Oto­mo as one of his own influ­ences, and in trib­ute to Miyaza­ki, named his daugh­ter Nau­si­caa. For Jean Giraud, inspi­ra­tion was­n’t a one-way street; it was more like a <span>Möbius strip</span>.</p>\n<p><strong>Relat­ed con­tent:</strong></p>\n<p><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.openculture.com/2015/12/watch-groundbreaking-comic-artist-moebius-draw-his-characters-in-real-time.html\">Watch Ground­break­ing Com­ic Artist Mœbius Draw His Char­ac­ters in Real Time</a></p>\n<p><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.openculture.com/2015/11/moebius-jodorowskys-sci-fi-masterpiece-the-incal-brought-to-life-in-a-tantalizing-animation.html#google_vignette\">Mœbius & Jodorowsky’s Sci-Fi Mas­ter­piece <em>The Incal</em> Brought to Life in a Tan­ta­liz­ing Ani­ma­tion</a></p>\n<p><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.openculture.com/2018/09/long-tomorrow-discover-moebius-hard-boiled-detective-comic-inspired-blade-runner-1975.html\"><em>The Long Tomor­row</em>: Dis­cov­er Mœbius’ Hard-Boiled Detec­tive Com­ic That Inspired <em>Blade Run­ner</em> (1975)</a></p>\n<p><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.openculture.com/2016/11/watch-moebius-and-miyazaki-two-of-the-most-imaginative-artists-in-conversation-2004.html\">Watch Moe­bius and Miyaza­ki, Two of the Most Imag­i­na­tive Artists, in Con­ver­sa­tion (2004)</a></p>\n<p><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.openculture.com/2024/09/moebius-gives-18-tips-to-aspiring-artists.html\">Moe­bius Gives 18 Wis­dom-Filled Tips to Aspir­ing Artists</a></p>\n<p><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.openculture.com/2024/02/the-disney-artist-who-developed-donald-duck-remained-anonymous-for-years.html\">The Dis­ney Artist Who Devel­oped Don­ald Duck & Remained Anony­mous for Years, Despite Being “the Most Pop­u­lar and Wide­ly Read Artist-Writer in the World”</a></p>\n<p><em>Based in Seoul, </em><em><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://blog.colinmarshall.org/\">Col­in</a></em><em><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://blog.colinmarshall.org/\"> M</a></em><em><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://blog.colinmarshall.org/\">a</a></em><em><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://blog.colinmarshall.org/\">rshall</a> writes and broad­cas</em><em>ts on cities, lan­guage, and cul­ture.

    "body": "<section>\n<article>\n\t<div>\n<p>Say you visit a highly anticipated exhibition one Saturday afternoon and find yourself in a crowded gallery, shoulder-to-shoulder with a pack of rabid art goers. As you stealthily maneuver toward your viewing target, an over-stimulated (or, depending on the show, perhaps under-stimulated) child begins to melt down. You suddenly overhear an unreasonably heated conversation about brunch plans. Your heartbeat quickens, and soon, art gallery panic sets in. How do you return to the piece in front of you while also reclaiming your peace of mind?</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://vimeo.com/1120735582?fl=pl&fe=sh\" target=\"_blank\">A collaborative film</a> by animator Gaia Alari and therapist Emily Price visualizes how art can help us get in tune with our senses and emotions. Paired with Alari’s dynamic drawings, Price guides viewers through an exercise designed to focus our attention even in the most anxious or gloomy of situations. Put your hands on your heart and stomach, she suggests, or imagine yourself protected in a cloche or invisibility cape, allowing yourself to feel calm and safe.</p>\n<figure><p>\n<iframe src=\"https://player.vimeo.com/video/1120735582?dnt=1&app_id=122963\" width=\"500\" height=\"281\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"autoplay; fullscreen; picture-in-picture; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; web-share\"></iframe>\n</p></figure>\n<p>“How does your body react to art?” is produced by MoMA, which also released <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.moma.org/magazine/articles/1221\">a long-form interview</a> with Price that dives into the psychology of a museum visit. For more from Alari, visit <a href=\"https://vimeo.com/user168730875\" target=\"_blank\">Vimeo</a>.</p>\n<p>You also might enjoy <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.thisiscolossal.com/2025/09/no-one-knows-all-it-takes-community-programs/\">a similarly meditative project</a> by Bryana Bibbs, which invites viewers to contribute to a collective weaving as a response to an exhibition about mental health and wellness.</p>\n<figure><img src=\"https://www.thisiscolossal.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/alari-2.gif\" alt=\"black crows cover a persons face and rotate to flowers in a gif\" /></figure>\n\t</div>\n\t</article>\n\t</section>"
