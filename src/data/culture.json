I got you. “My man!” This is the moment in the film where Isaiah White, played by Marlon Wayans, is going to teach Cameron Cade, played by Tyriq Withers a lesson in how to be a great quarterback. In this lesson, I did a lot of research about quarterback drills that hone in on specific skills. For example, in a pro game, you want to be able to get the ball out of your hands under two seconds. So that’s why we have two seconds on the clock and to work on that speed that’s required of decision making. That’s why he’s turned away from the actual receivers. He has his eyes closed. So that you’re forced into a panic-like situation, and you have to throw the ball as quickly as possible. So what I really wanted to communicate in this scene specifically, was that there’s going to be a big tonal shift from something’s off to something’s very wrong, and it’s the first time we’re going to introduce violence and a dynamic between the two characters that becomes much more like a narcissistic, abusive relationship than a mentor-mentee “Too slow.” But seed it and bury that under the guise of hazing and just being a rookie. And what I landed on was this idea of using this JUGS machine to be that conduit of punishment. I also didn’t want him to have time to process anything. That’s why I kind of try to get music and a rhythm going in the edit. And even the sound design is rhythmic. That vibration and metallic clanking, it escalates and grows and grows over this entire sequence. And then we have these really tight, extreme close-ups of Cameron Cade’s eyes. And that was just a creative choice I made to rely on the language of horror, where there’s a classic peekaboo.</p></dd></dl></div></div></div>"

It has not yet commented on Kimmel's reinstatement. </p><p>Critics and First Amendment advocates railed against ABC's decision last week as censorship and a violation of free speech. </p><p>Kimmel, who has hosted the late-night programme since 2003 and hosted four Oscars ceremonies, has not yet publicly addressed the suspension or the fallout. </p><p>The row started after Kimmel said in his monologue on 15 September that the \"Maga gang\" were \"desperately trying to characterise this kid who murdered Charlie Kirk as anything other than one of them\" and trying to \"score political points from it\".</p><p>He also made fun of Trump's reaction to the influencer's murder, showing a clip of the president responding to a question about how he was mourning the death by changing the subject to construction of a new White House ballroom.  </p><p>Kimmel compared the response to \"how a four-year-old mourns a goldfish\".</p><p>Brendan Carr, the Trump-appointed chair of broadcast regulator the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c87yel3wgqgo\">Federal Communications Commission (FCC</a>), threatened to act against ABC and its parent company Disney over Kimmel's remarks. </p><p>The spat comes as Vice President JD Vance and other White House allies have been pushing a national campaign to punish anyone who has criticised Kirk in the wake of his death. </p><p>Hours after Mr Carr made his initial remarks about Kimmel's monologue, Nexstar said it would not air Kimmel's show \"for the foreseeable future\".</p><p>Sinclair followed suit and ABC announced that it would \"indefinitely\" suspend the programme <b>and demanded an apology from Kimmel, as well as a donation to Kirk's non-profit organization Turning Point USA.</b></p><p>Mr Carr thanked Nexstar \"for doing the right thing\" and said he hoped other broadcasters would follow its lead. Nexstar is currently seeking FCC approval for its planned $6.2bn (£4.5bn) merger with Tegna.</p><p>Anna Gomez, the sole Democrat on the FCC, said on Monday that she was \"glad to see Disney find its courage in the face of clear government intimidation\".</p><p>Ms Gomez also thanked Americans across the ideological spectrum who protested \"this blatant attempt to silence free speech\" and vowed to \"combat these efforts to stifle free expression\".</p><p><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c203n52x1y9o\">ABC's decision</a> to suspend Kimmel<b> </b>was met with protests in California and lambasted by the writers and actors guilds, lawmakers and the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) alike, who argued that the suspension violates free speech rights and spurs a chilling effect.</p><p>Kimmel's late-night colleagues, including Jon Stewart, John Oliver and outgoing CBS host Stephen Colbert, rallied behind him and hundreds of celebrities and Hollywood creatives <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c62le8q959yo\">signed on to a letter</a> backing Kimmel. </p><p>Ben Stiller, Jennifer Aniston, Meryl Streep and Robert DeNiro are among those who called Kimmel's suspension a \"dark moment for freedom of speech in our nation\".</p><p>Critics have also called for the cancellation of Disney+, Hulu and other Disney-owned subscription services to cut into the entertainment conglomerate's bottom line over it decision to suspend Kimmel.</p></div>"
