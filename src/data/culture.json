Of those books, none is more wide­ly known to the pub­lic — or, still, more wide­ly read by the pub­lic — than <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://amzn.to/3KqONID\"><em>Cos­mos</em></a>, accom­pa­nied as it was by <em>Cos­mos: A Per­son­al Voy­age</em>, a com­pan­ion tele­vi­sion series on PBS. Sagan’s oth­er pop­u­lar books, like <em>Shad­ows of For­got­ten Ances­tors</em> or <em>Con­tact</em> (the basis of the 1997 Hol­ly­wood movie) are also well worth read­ing, but we per­haps ignore at our great­est per­il <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://amzn.to/4nrc8sg\"><em>The Demon-Haunt­ed World: Sci­ence as a Can­dle in the Dark</em></a>. Pub­lished in 1995, the year before Sagan’s death, it stands as his tes­ta­ment to the impor­tance of crit­i­cal, sci­en­tif­ic think­ing for all of us.</p>\n<p><em><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://amzn.to/4nrc8sg\">The Demon-Haunt­ed World</a> </em>is the sub­ject of the <em>Genet­i­cal­ly Mod­i­fied Skep­tic</em> video above, whose host Drew McCoy describes it as his favorite book. He pays spe­cial atten­tion to its chap­ter in which Sagan lays out what he calls his “baloney detec­tion kit.” This assem­bled metaphor­i­cal box of tools for diag­nos­ing fraud­u­lent argu­ments and con­struct­ing rea­soned ones involves these nine prin­ci­ples:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Wher­ev­er pos­si­ble there must be inde­pen­dent con­fir­ma­tion of the “facts.”</li>\n<li>Encour­age sub­stan­tive debate on the evi­dence by knowl­edge­able pro­po­nents of all points of view.</li>\n<li>Argu­ments from author­i­ty car­ry lit­tle weight — “author­i­ties” have made mis­takes in the past. They will do so again in the future. Per­haps a bet­ter way to say it is that in sci­ence there are no author­i­ties; at most, there are experts.</li>\n<li>Spin more than one hypoth­e­sis. If there’s some­thing to be explained, think of all the dif­fer­ent ways in which it could be explained. Then think of tests by which you might sys­tem­at­i­cal­ly dis­prove each of the alter­na­tives.</li>\n<li>Try not to get over­ly attached to a hypoth­e­sis just because it’s yours. It’s only a way sta­tion in the pur­suit of knowl­edge. Ask your­self why you like the idea. Com­pare it fair­ly with the alter­na­tives.</li>\n<li>See if you can find rea­sons for reject­ing it. If you don’t, oth­ers will.</li>\n<li>If what­ev­er it is you’re explain­ing has some mea­sure, some numer­i­cal quan­ti­ty attached to it, you’ll be much bet­ter able to dis­crim­i­nate among com­pet­ing hypothe­ses. What is vague and qual­i­ta­tive is open to many expla­na­tions.</li>\n<li>If there’s a chain of argu­ment, every link in the chain must work (includ­ing the premise) — not just most of them.</li>\n<li>Occam’s Razor. This con­ve­nient rule-of-thumb urges us when faced with two hypothe­ses that explain the data equal­ly well to choose the sim­pler. Always ask whether the hypoth­e­sis can be, at least in prin­ci­ple, fal­si­fied…. You must be able to check asser­tions out. Invet­er­ate skep­tics must be giv­en the chance to fol­low your rea­son­ing, to dupli­cate your exper­i­ments and see if they get the same result.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>As McCoy points out, these tech­niques of mind have to do with can­cel­ing out the man­i­fold bias­es present in our think­ing, those nat­ur­al human ten­den­cies that incline us to accept ideas that may or may not coin­cide with real­i­ty as it is. If we take no trou­ble to cor­rect for these bias­es, Sagan came to believe, we’ll become easy marks for all the trick­sters and char­la­tans who hap­pen to come our way. And that’s just on the micro lev­el: on the macro lev­el, vul­ner­a­bil­i­ty to delu­sion can <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.openculture.com/2025/02/carl-sagan-predicts-the-decline-of-america-unable-to-know-whats-true.html\">bring down entire civ­i­liza­tions</a>.</p>\n<p>“Like all tools, the baloney detec­tion kit can be mis­used, applied out of con­text, or even employed as a rote alter­na­tive to think­ing,” Sagan cau­tions. “But applied judi­cious­ly, it can make all the dif­fer­ence in the world — not least in eval­u­at­ing our own argu­ments before we present them to oth­ers.” McCoy urges us to heed these words, adding that “this kit is not some per­fect solu­tion to the world’s prob­lems, but as it’s been uti­lized over the last few cen­turies” — for its basic pre­cepts long pre­date Sagan’s par­tic­u­lar artic­u­la­tion — “it has enabled us to cre­ate tech­no­log­i­cal inno­va­tions and use­ful explana­to­ry mod­els of our world more quick­ly and effec­tive­ly than ever before.” The walls of baloney may always be clos­ing in on human­i­ty, but if you fol­low Sagan’s advice, you can at least give your­self some breath­ing room.</p>\n<p><strong>Relat­ed con­tent:</strong></p>\n<p><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.openculture.com/2020/12/carl-sagan-on-the-importance-of-choosing-wisely-what-you-read.html\">Carl Sagan on the Impor­tance of Choos­ing Wise­ly What You Read (Even If You Read a Book a Week)</a></p>\n<p><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.openculture.com/2018/01/carl-sagans-syllabus-final-exam-for-his-course-on-critical-thinking-cornell-1986.html\">Carl Sagan’s Syl­labus & Final Exam for His Course on Crit­i­cal Think­ing (Cor­nell, 1986)</a></p>\n<p><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.openculture.com/2025/02/carl-sagan-predicts-the-decline-of-america-unable-to-know-whats-true.html\">Carl Sagan Pre­dicts the Decline of Amer­i­ca: Unable to Know “What’s True,” We Will Slide, “With­out Notic­ing, Back into Super­sti­tion & Dark­ness” (1995)</a></p>\n<p><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.openculture.com/2024/08/richard-feynman-creates-a-simple-method-for-telling-science-from-pseudoscience.html\">Richard Feyn­man Cre­ates a Sim­ple Method for Telling Sci­ence From Pseu­do­science (1966)</a></p>\n<p><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.openculture.com/2023/07/how-to-spot-bullshit-a-manual-by-princeton-philosopher-harry-frankfurt-rip.html\">How to Spot Bull­shit: A Man­u­al by Prince­ton Philoso­pher Har­ry Frank­furt (RIP)</a></p>\n<p><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.openculture.com/critical-thinking-a-free-course\">Crit­i­cal Think­ing: A Free Course</a></p>\n<p><em>Based in Seoul, </em><em><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://blog.colinmarshall.org/\">Col­in</a></em><em><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://blog.colinmarshall.org/\"> M</a></em><em><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://blog.colinmarshall.org/\">a</a></em><em><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://blog.colinmarshall.org/\">rshall</a> writes and broad­cas</em><em>ts on cities, lan­guage, and cul­ture.

Half a cen­tu­ry ago, she was just anoth­er young stage actress in New York, albeit one rapid­ly ascend­ing the rungs of the­atri­cal pres­tige, doing three Shake­speare plays and then star­ring in Weill, Haupt­mann, and Brecht’s <em>Hap­py End</em> on Broad­way. <em>The Deer Hunter</em>, <em>Kramer vs. Kramer</em>, <em>Out of Africa</em>,<em> Post­cards from the Edge</em>, <em>The Bridges of Madi­son Coun­ty</em>: all this lay in her future in 1976, the year of her fea­ture debut.</p>\n<p>Streep made that debut in <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AO5SixiWjZ4\"><em>Every­body Rides the Carousel</em></a>, a now-obscure ani­mat­ed film that dra­ma­tizes post-Freudi­an psy­chol­o­gist <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erik_Erikson\">Erik Erik­son</a>’s <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erikson%27s_stages_of_psychosocial_development\">eight stages of psy­choso­cial devel­op­ment</a>.

Prior to this transitional period, which archaeologists refer to as the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neolithic_Revolution\" target=\"_blank\">Neolithic Revolution</a>—the final phase of the Stone Age—small societies were organized around hunting and gathering for sustenance. During the Neolithic period, the gradual adoption of agricultural practices forever changed the way we live.</p>\n<p>Over the next few thousand years, humans began domesticating plants and practicing animal husbandry in different parts of the world. And with less time needed for farming than for nomadically searching for food, ancient people could enjoy other activities that led to economic, political, religious, and artistic developments.</p>\n<figure><img src=\"https://www.thisiscolossal.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/earthworks-3.jpg\" alt=\"people working on a grassy earthwork\" srcset=\"https://www.thisiscolossal.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/earthworks-3.jpg 2000w, https://www.thisiscolossal.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/earthworks-3-640x480.jpg 640w, https://www.thisiscolossal.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/earthworks-3-960x720.jpg 960w, https://www.thisiscolossal.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/earthworks-3-768x576.jpg 768w, https://www.thisiscolossal.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/earthworks-3-1536x1152.jpg 1536w\" /><figcaption>The excavation follows the future layout of the walking path in the park, which will lead from the visitor pavilion to the circular ditch.

It’s also when iconically old structures like Ireland’s Newgrange passage tomb and England’s Stonehenge complex were built, the latter of which was begun around 3100 B.C.E. and finished around 600 years later. For context, when Stonehenge was in its final phase, construction of the Pyramids of Giza was likely in progress. Recently, a series of circular earthworks dating to the 5th millennium B.C.E. (5000 to 4001 B.C.E.) in Burgenland, Austria, may predate much of Stonehenge by a remarkable 2,000 years.</p>\n<p>At the newly excavated site, three monumental structures sit in close proximity to one another near the town of Rechnitz. The earthworks were initially discovered via aerial and geomagnetic surveys between 2011 and 2017. A total of four were found, three of which are ring-shaped structures that were previously invisible to the naked eye. </p>\n<p>Known as circular ditch systems, the structures were built in the Middle Neolithic period—sometime between 4850 and 4500 B.C.E.—making them at least 6,500 years old.</p>\n<p>“The Rechnitz site can be considered a supra-regional center of the Middle Neolithic period,” says Nikolaus Franz, the director of Burgenland Archaeology, in a <a href=\"https://www-burgenland-at.translate.goog/news-detail/fenster-in-die-steinzeit-grabungen-in-rechnitz-bringen-neue-erkenntnisse-ueber-die-neolithische-besiedelung-des-suedburgenlandes?_x_tr_sl=auto&_x_tr_tl=en&_x_tr_hl=en&_x_tr_pto=wapp\" target=\"_blank\">statement</a>. In the ditches measuring as much as 340 feet across, archaeologists have documented pits containing ceramic finds and post holes that indicate where timber beams in the ground once supported shelters.</p>\n<figure><img src=\"https://www.thisiscolossal.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/earthworks-4.jpg\" alt=\"a drawing and excavation of a grassy earthwork\" srcset=\"https://www.thisiscolossal.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/earthworks-4.jpg 2000w, https://www.thisiscolossal.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/earthworks-4-640x853.jpg 640w, https://www.thisiscolossal.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/earthworks-4-960x1280.jpg 960w, https://www.thisiscolossal.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/earthworks-4-768x1024.jpg 768w, https://www.thisiscolossal.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/earthworks-4-1152x1536.jpg 1152w, https://www.thisiscolossal.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/earthworks-4-1536x2048.jpg 1536w\" /></figure>\n<p>Circular ditch monuments of this type, known as <em><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neolithic_circular_enclosures_in_Central_Europe\" target=\"_blank\">Kreisgrabenanlagen</a></em> in German, are consistently found throughout Central Europe. While their intended function remains unknown, researchers generally believe they held an ancient religious, or cultic, purpose. Similar to Stonehenge, their orientation includes openings that align with the solstices and seem to correspond to an astronomical calendar.</p>\n<p>“The excavations open a veritable window into the Stone Age,” Franz says. “We are learning a great deal about the Neolithic settler clans who found this a favorable location to establish the cultural techniques of agriculture and livestock farming in what is now Burgenland…After centuries of hunting and gathering, the gradual settlement of humans was truly revolutionary.”</p>\n<p>You might also enjoy exploring the phenomenal complex of more than <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.thisiscolossal.com/2023/10/amazon-earthworks/\">10,000 earthworks</a> made by prehistoric Indigenous societies in the Amazon basin.</p>\n<figure><img src=\"https://www.thisiscolossal.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/earthworks-1.jpg\" alt=\"an aerial view of a round earthwork\" srcset=\"https://www.thisiscolossal.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/earthworks-1.jpg 2000w, https://www.thisiscolossal.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/earthworks-1-640x480.jpg 640w, https://www.thisiscolossal.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/earthworks-1-960x720.jpg 960w, https://www.thisiscolossal.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/earthworks-1-768x576.jpg 768w, https://www.thisiscolossal.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/earthworks-1-1536x1152.jpg 1536w\" /></figure>\n\t</div>\n\t</article>\n\t</section>"

Born in India, he moved to the United States with his family when he was 13. He is acutely aware that he is neither at home nor a complete stranger to two complex cultures and histories. It is that unstable, in-between space that he continues to explore in the 13 oil paintings and one wall drawing, dating from 2022 to 2025, on view in <em><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://nathaliekarg.com/exhibitions/94-the-sleep-of-reason-sangram-majumdar/press_release_text/\">The Sleep of Reason</a></em>, at Natalie Karg Gallery. </p>\n<p>For much of his career, Majumdar, an artist I’ve long known and covered, and included in a show I curated, was an observational painter with a broad formal range, encompassing everything from highly accomplished representational paintings to abstract images grounded in direct observation. These pieces, created through layers and fragments, invited prolonged looking while resisting interpretation. Their inchoateness mirrored his inner state of vulnerability, and the desire to be seen rather than projected upon. </p>\n<div>\n<figure><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/09/Sangram-Majumdar-_monstermash-3_--1200x1435.jpg?resize=1200%2C1435&quality=90&ssl=1\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/09/Sangram-Majumdar-_monstermash-3_-.jpg?resize=1200%2C1435&quality=90&ssl=1 1200w, https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/09/Sangram-Majumdar-_monstermash-3_-.jpg?resize=720%2C861&quality=90&ssl=1 720w, https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/09/Sangram-Majumdar-_monstermash-3_-.jpg?resize=768%2C919&quality=90&ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/09/Sangram-Majumdar-_monstermash-3_-.jpg?resize=856%2C1024&quality=90&ssl=1 856w, https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/09/Sangram-Majumdar-_monstermash-3_-.jpg?resize=780%2C933&quality=90&ssl=1 780w, https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/09/Sangram-Majumdar-_monstermash-3_-.jpg?resize=400%2C478&quality=90&ssl=1 400w, https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/09/Sangram-Majumdar-_monstermash-3_-.jpg?resize=706%2C844&quality=90&ssl=1 706w, https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/09/Sangram-Majumdar-_monstermash-3_-.jpg?w=1254&quality=90&ssl=1 1254w, https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/09/Sangram-Majumdar-_monstermash-3_--1200x1435.jpg?w=370&quality=90&ssl=1 370w\" /><figcaption>Sangram Majumdar, “monstermash 4” (2025), oil on canvas</figcaption></figure></div>\n<p>Building upon the work in the 2024 show, his current pieces are a dense bricolage of diverse sources, including images derived from using strips of different colored tape to convey the awkwardness of his child learning to walk, as well as gestures found in Western art, Persian miniatures, Indian folk art, and mass media. By studying images from different cultures and epochs, he has discovered a coherence of meaning assigned to particular expressions across many cultures, and has isolated others that are specific to geographic areas and tradition, such as Hindu art. </p>\n<p>By bringing together varied full and partial images and painterly passages, Majumdar has created layered and fractured spaces in which his figures exist. Depending on what he is pursuing, his work has featured abstraction, cartoon-like imagery, figures, and decorative patterning, sometimes in a single composition. His approach seems to be driven by the desire to hold together the many different aspects of his dual Indian-American identity, along with his recognition that it is difficult to separate the personal from the political. Can he inhabit both identities? What does it mean to do so? </p>\n<div>\n<figure><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/09/Sangram-Majumdar-_the-meeting._--1200x1432.jpg?resize=1200%2C1432&quality=90&ssl=1\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/09/Sangram-Majumdar-_the-meeting._-.jpg?resize=1200%2C1432&quality=90&ssl=1 1200w, https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/09/Sangram-Majumdar-_the-meeting._-.jpg?resize=720%2C859&quality=90&ssl=1 720w, https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/09/Sangram-Majumdar-_the-meeting._-.jpg?resize=768%2C916&quality=90&ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/09/Sangram-Majumdar-_the-meeting._-.jpg?resize=858%2C1024&quality=90&ssl=1 858w, https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/09/Sangram-Majumdar-_the-meeting._-.jpg?resize=780%2C931&quality=90&ssl=1 780w, https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/09/Sangram-Majumdar-_the-meeting._-.jpg?resize=400%2C477&quality=90&ssl=1 400w, https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/09/Sangram-Majumdar-_the-meeting._-.jpg?resize=706%2C842&quality=90&ssl=1 706w, https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/09/Sangram-Majumdar-_the-meeting._-.jpg?w=1257&quality=90&ssl=1 1257w, https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/09/Sangram-Majumdar-_the-meeting._--1200x1432.jpg?w=370&quality=90&ssl=1 370w\" /><figcaption>Sangram Majumdar, “The Meeting” (2022), oil on canvas</figcaption></figure></div>\n<p>“The Meeting” (2022), which Majumdar made in response to Gustave Courbet’s “The Meeting, or Bonjour Monsieur Courbet” (1854), centers on a shirtless brown-skinned man wearing pink shorts, Majumdar’s self-portrait. Courbet’s piece depicts a chance encounter between the artist, his dog, Breton, his servant, Calas, and his friend and most important patron, Alfred Bruyas. Until Courbet’s innovative work, group portraits in the European tradition were largely composed of figures posing in a room. Nothing was spontaneous or improvised. When I first saw Majumdar’s painting in 2023, I interpreted it solely through the lens of the 1854 painting. I later realized that my reading was too narrow and that it has little to do with patronage, which was Courbet’s subject. </p>\n<p>In “The Meeting,” Majumdar’s left hand extends forward from his chest, about heart height, greeted by an abstract, semi-transparent yellow shape that I saw as a gloved hand. Is it coming from a composite figure that we cannot identify? The artist, seen in profile, directs his gaze toward an unknowable space between the viewer and the compounded, abstract figure. Stuck between two disparate cultures, he does not know what to look at or take in; his mouth is open, bewildered. </p>\n<div>\n<figure><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/09/Sangram-Majumdar-the-collaborators-I_.jpg?resize=1000%2C1512&quality=90&ssl=1\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/09/Sangram-Majumdar-the-collaborators-I_.jpg?w=1000&quality=90&ssl=1 1000w, https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/09/Sangram-Majumdar-the-collaborators-I_.jpg?resize=720%2C1089&quality=90&ssl=1 720w, https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/09/Sangram-Majumdar-the-collaborators-I_.jpg?resize=768%2C1161&quality=90&ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/09/Sangram-Majumdar-the-collaborators-I_.jpg?resize=677%2C1024&quality=90&ssl=1 677w, https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/09/Sangram-Majumdar-the-collaborators-I_.jpg?resize=780%2C1179&quality=90&ssl=1 780w, https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/09/Sangram-Majumdar-the-collaborators-I_.jpg?resize=400%2C605&quality=90&ssl=1 400w, https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/09/Sangram-Majumdar-the-collaborators-I_.jpg?resize=706%2C1067&quality=90&ssl=1 706w, https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/09/Sangram-Majumdar-the-collaborators-I_.jpg?w=370&quality=90&ssl=1 370w\" /><figcaption>Sangram Majumdar, “Collaborators I” (2025), oil on canvas</figcaption></figure></div>\n<p>Majumdar wants viewers to feel some of his conflicted position in ways that seem fresh. In “Collaborators I” (2025), he depicts a woman in a jungle-like setting, among tropical leaves. She wears what looks like a gray skirt that reaches to the painting’s bottom edge and a flowery pink and violet blouse. Is she standing or kneeling. What does the upward gesture of arms and hands signify?  </p>\n<p>What I find most engrossing about the work is that the woman’s head is all black, and Majumdar has painted a small blue dot near the center of it. Is her face turned away from us, revealing her dark hair? Or is she always hidden to us? The issue of visibility, and what it means, becomes the painting’s subject. Similarly mysterious are several pairs of disembodied eyes peering out at us in “Voice Over” (2025). Are they benign or dangerous? Seemingly aimed in all directions, at what are they actually looking? How and what do we and they see, and why are they staring? </p>\n<p>As he explores his identity from multiple perspectives, what roads can Majumdar travel down and what territory can he explore? These questions are central to his ambitious project. </p>\n<div>\n<figure><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/09/Sangram-Majumdar-_Voice-Over_--1200x997.jpg?resize=1200%2C997&quality=90&ssl=1\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/09/Sangram-Majumdar-_Voice-Over_-.jpg?resize=1200%2C997&quality=90&ssl=1 1200w, https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/09/Sangram-Majumdar-_Voice-Over_-.jpg?resize=720%2C598&quality=90&ssl=1 720w, https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/09/Sangram-Majumdar-_Voice-Over_-.jpg?resize=768%2C638&quality=90&ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/09/Sangram-Majumdar-_Voice-Over_-.jpg?resize=1024%2C851&quality=90&ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/09/Sangram-Majumdar-_Voice-Over_-.jpg?resize=780%2C648&quality=90&ssl=1 780w, https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/09/Sangram-Majumdar-_Voice-Over_-.jpg?resize=400%2C332&quality=90&ssl=1 400w, https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/09/Sangram-Majumdar-_Voice-Over_-.jpg?resize=706%2C586&quality=90&ssl=1 706w, https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/09/Sangram-Majumdar-_Voice-Over_-.jpg?w=1500&quality=90&ssl=1 1500w, https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/09/Sangram-Majumdar-_Voice-Over_--1200x997.jpg?w=370&quality=90&ssl=1 370w\" /><figcaption>Sangram Majumdar, “Voice Over” (2025), oil on canvas</figcaption></figure></div>\n<p><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://nathaliekarg.com/exhibitions/94-the-sleep-of-reason-sangram-majumdar/press_release_text/\">Sangram Majumdar: The Sleep of Reason</a> <em>continues at Nathalie Karg Gallery (127 Elizabeth Street, Lower East Side, Manhattan) though October 6.

There, a video and introductory texts frame the exhibition as a collaborative endeavor between the museum and community members, as well as a celebration of the still-thriving cultures of peoples indigenous to Africa and North America.

Carved from tree trunks with fire and water, “dugout” canoes are a shared tradition from Pequot territories to African shores, where they are used to navigate rivers and oceans, sustaining communities through fishing and maintaining connections. Nearby is the oldest object on view, an Aboriginal cooking pot from 500 BCE made from shell-tempering technology utilized in global Indigenous and African ceramics, another example of ancestral science that sustains everyday life.</p>\n<p>After walking through two galleries of maritime material culture made by skilled Black and Indigenous craftspeople, visitors arrive at an unlikely space evoking historic domestic dwellings. The external structure is modeled after a traditional Wampanoag<em> wetu</em>, a dome-shaped home made from local materials like cedar saplings. Though it is presented here at ground level, the interior of the wetu is designed to look and feel like the attic of a colonial-era New England home, where enslaved Africans and Indigenous indentured workers were often forced to live. The dimly lit display evokes the captivity and loneliness of the attic, while the fragmented pieces of a sacred historic bundle on display allude to the space as a site for privacy and spiritual practice. The “Nkisi Bundle” (18th century) is a spirited assemblage of cowrie shells, beads, buttons, fabric scraps, and other objects utilized as a vessel to connect Africans to their ancestors. The likely owner, enslaved man Cardardo Wanton, would have prayed with his <em>nkisi</em> bundle in private to protect him, hiding it underneath an attic floorboard in the meantime. <em>Minkisi</em>, the plural of nkisi<em>, </em>are vessels instilled with energy and ancestral spirit in West and Central African traditions. As sacred assemblages, they promote spiritual harmony on the African continent and in diasporic rituals. </p>\n<figure><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/09/alylm-1200x746.jpeg?resize=1200%2C746&quality=90&ssl=1\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/09/alylm.jpeg?resize=1200%2C746&quality=90&ssl=1 1200w, https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/09/alylm.jpeg?resize=720%2C447&quality=90&ssl=1 720w, https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/09/alylm.jpeg?resize=768%2C477&quality=90&ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/09/alylm.jpeg?resize=1536%2C954&quality=90&ssl=1 1536w, https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/09/alylm.jpeg?resize=2048%2C1272&quality=90&ssl=1 2048w, https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/09/alylm.jpeg?resize=1024%2C636&quality=90&ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/09/alylm.jpeg?resize=2000%2C1243&quality=90&ssl=1 2000w, https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/09/alylm.jpeg?resize=780%2C485&quality=90&ssl=1 780w, https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/09/alylm.jpeg?resize=400%2C249&quality=90&ssl=1 400w, https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/09/alylm.jpeg?resize=706%2C439&quality=90&ssl=1 706w, https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/09/alylm-1200x746.jpeg?w=370&quality=90&ssl=1 370w\" /><figcaption>Installation view of <em>Entwined: Freedom, Sovereignty, and the Sea</em> (photo by Joe Michael, courtesy Mystic Seaport Museum)</figcaption></figure>\n<p>Leaving the intimacy of the provisional attic, the gallery opens up to a wide display of contemporary art. The Indigenous fashion on view is resplendent: “The Rainbow Regalia” (2016) of Sherenté Mishitashin Harris (Narragansett), Two-Spirit activist and champion powwow dancer, is colorful and vibrant, with intricate beadwork, shimmering fringe, and designs that honor the Fancy Shawl tradition. Nearby, “Maushop’s Earrings” and “Squant’s Gorget Necklace” were created from Quahog shells in 2023 by Elizabeth James-Perry (Aquinnah Wampanoag) as a delightful ode to Maushop and Squant, the powerful duo in Wampanoag folklore known for shaping the coastline and protecting their people. James-Perry’s “Constellation Wampum Belt” (2023) is made from shells woven into the shape of the Bear constellation, symbolizing the connection between the earth and the sky. It sits at the contemporary end of a millennia-old tradition in which coastal Indigenous communities in New England and elsewhere in the North create purple and white beaded bodily adornments from Quahog shells. </p>\n<p>Other contemporary beaded and woven works celebrate the beauty and resilience of Black and Indigenous lifeways. Felandus Thames’s “Wail on Whalers, a Portrait of Amos Haskins” (2024) is a stunning beaded portrait honoring fugitive slaves who joined the whaling industry. In the 19th century, Amos Haskins (Wampanoag Tribe of Gay Head) achieved captain status in the whaling industry, where he worked with a diverse crowd of sailors, including escaped enslaved people and other people of color. He married an African-American woman, Elizabeth P. Farmer, in 1844 and raised mixed-race children with her. Tragically, he was lost at sea in 1861, but his legacy lives on as an example of the 19th-century whaling industry, where Black and Indigenous peoples found kinship and financial autonomy. Adjacent is Nafis M. White’s “TideLine” (2023–24), a wall sculpture made from colorful hair woven into different forms, such as braids, twists, and knots that cascade and coil across the work like tidal currents. The work’s medium line includes “hair, embodied knowledge, ancestral recall, audacity of survival, Swarovski crystals, the artist’s sequined gowns, hair baubles, gold gilded oyster shells, bobby pins” — a delightful framing of her artistic practice that mirrors the themes of the exhibition, as hair is an ancestral, sacred, creative process in both Black and Indigenous communities. </p>\n<p><em>Entwined </em>takes us in countless directions across hundreds of years of Black-Indigenous survival under colonialism and slavery. We witness the visual and material culture through which Africans, Natives, and their descendants adorn themselves and express their cultural traditions, feed their bodies and spirits, and thrive. That this exhibition takes place in Connecticut and centers Dawnland (New England) narratives is incredibly special. The state likely conjures images of White, wealthy businessmen who work on Wall Street and live in suburban Southern Connecticut mansions. <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.ctinsider.com/news/education/article/uconn-native-american-history-morill-acts-19831265.php?utm_source=chatgpt.com\">Indigeneity has often been rendered invisible in Connecticut,</a> even as the state hosts the world’s largest museum of Native American history and culture, the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.pequotmuseum.org/\">Mashantucket Pequot Museum and Research Center, </a>less than a 30-minute drive from the Mystic Seaport Museum and from which several works were loaned. <em>Entwined </em>is a profound statement: Black and Indigenous histories matter here, too. Globally and locally, their traditions are sacred, everlasting, and entwined. </p>\n<div>\n<figure><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/09/J90XU-1200x957.jpeg?resize=1200%2C957&quality=90&ssl=1\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/09/J90XU.jpeg?resize=1200%2C957&quality=90&ssl=1 1200w, https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/09/J90XU.jpeg?resize=720%2C574&quality=90&ssl=1 720w, https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/09/J90XU.jpeg?resize=768%2C612&quality=90&ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/09/J90XU.jpeg?resize=1536%2C1224&quality=90&ssl=1 1536w, https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/09/J90XU.jpeg?resize=2048%2C1632&quality=90&ssl=1 2048w, https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/09/J90XU.jpeg?resize=1024%2C816&quality=90&ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/09/J90XU.jpeg?resize=2000%2C1594&quality=90&ssl=1 2000w, https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/09/J90XU.jpeg?resize=780%2C622&quality=90&ssl=1 780w, https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/09/J90XU.jpeg?resize=400%2C319&quality=90&ssl=1 400w, https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/09/J90XU.jpeg?resize=706%2C563&quality=90&ssl=1 706w, https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/09/J90XU-1200x957.jpeg?w=370&quality=90&ssl=1 370w\" /><figcaption>Unrecorded maker, Aboriginal cooking pot (c. 500 BCE) (photo Alexandra M.
