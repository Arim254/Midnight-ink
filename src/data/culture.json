    "body": "<section>\n<article>\n\t<div>\n<p>Street artists Francesco Camillo Giorgino and Julien Malland (a.k.a. <a href=\"https://www.millo.biz/\" target=\"_blank\">Millo</a> and <a href=\"https://seth.fr/en/\" target=\"_blank\">Seth Globepainter</a>) have painted in more than fifty countries combined. In a new exhibition titled <em>Beyond</em>, the pair takes their expansive mural practice indoors with thirty new works and their first collaborative canvas installation.</p>\n<p><em>Beyond</em> is grounded by a vast map at the entrance of the show, charting the far-reaching and meandering paths both artists have taken across the globe. Though they’ve crossed paths before, the exhibition emphasizes their convergence once again at Goldman Global Arts Gallery, where their monumental works have been reimagined within the context of gallery walls.</p>\n<figure><img src=\"https://www.thisiscolossal.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/millo_seth-8-960x1201.jpg\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://www.thisiscolossal.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/millo_seth-8-960x1201.jpg 960w, https://www.thisiscolossal.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/millo_seth-8-640x801.jpg 640w, https://www.thisiscolossal.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/millo_seth-8-768x961.jpg 768w, https://www.thisiscolossal.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/millo_seth-8-1227x1536.jpg 1227w, https://www.thisiscolossal.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/millo_seth-8-1636x2048.jpg 1636w, https://www.thisiscolossal.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/millo_seth-8.jpg 2000w\" /></figure>\n<p>Both Millo and Seth radiate a childlike wonder within their works, evoking a sense of joy and curiosity. While Millo’s compositions <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.thisiscolossal.com/tags/millo/\">usually feature</a> monochromatic figures and architectural components expressed with robust line work and bold pops of color, Seth’s pieces illustrate his <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.thisiscolossal.com/tags/seth-globepainter/\">signature</a> optical illusion perspectives, executed with vibrant yet soft palettes.</p>\n<p>Installed together, the works visually complement each other and amplify overlapping themes of surreal dreamscapes, everyday whimsy, and the power of imagination.</p>\n<p><em>Beyond</em> continues through November 16 in Miami.

    "body": "<section>\n<article>\n\t<div>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.jasonboydkinsella.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Jason Boyd Kinsella</a> refers to himself as “a collector of things at heart.” The manner in which the Toronto-born, Oslo-based artist (<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.thisiscolossal.com/tags/jason-boyd-kinsella/\">previously</a>) assembles shapes and colors appears to emerge from this lineage, his impeccable ability to capture a particular human emotion through abstract forms on full display.</p>\n<p><em>Alchemy of the Eternal Self </em>is Kinsella’s most recent body of work and continues his bold portraiture focused on the building blocks of our inner lives. Standing several feet tall, the geometric figures loom larger than most viewers, their bold personalities inviting an encounter.</p>\n<figure><img src=\"https://www.thisiscolossal.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/kinsella-1.jpg\" alt=\"an abstract portrait of a figure painted with chunky, colorful shapes\" srcset=\"https://www.thisiscolossal.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/kinsella-1.jpg 2000w, https://www.thisiscolossal.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/kinsella-1-640x536.jpg 640w, https://www.thisiscolossal.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/kinsella-1-960x804.jpg 960w, https://www.thisiscolossal.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/kinsella-1-768x643.jpg 768w, https://www.thisiscolossal.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/kinsella-1-1536x1286.jpg 1536w\" /><figcaption>“Luna” (2025), oil on canvas, 104 x 124 centimeters</figcaption></figure>\n<p>Kinsella zooms out in some of the pieces in the series, including “Luna” and its titular hunched character. With a sleek, white bob and perpetual frown, the figure’s long fingers reach for the ground as she turns to look out of frame. Exploring body language in addition to facial expressions, the artist also turns to art history, drawing the woman’s bent posture from Jean-François Millet’s “<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Gleaners\" target=\"_blank\">The Gleaners</a>.” The large-scale painting, completed in 1857, garnered sympathy for the lowest classes and showed their essential labor.</p>\n<p>In this way, Kinsella puzzles together both the timely and enduring, prompting connections through his Cubist paintings in which pure feeling and expression show that no matter how different we appear, we’re all made of the same emotional DNA.</p>\n<p><em>Alchemy of the Eternal Self</em> is on view through October 24 at <a href=\"https://www.perrotin.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Perrotin</a> in Shanghai.

Extracting dyes from organic sources is an art in and of itself, deeply rooted in various cultures across the historical Mesoamerican region. Although many traditional practices—like pigment harvesting—have been threatened by external factors such as colonialism, artists continue to keep these processes alive today.</p>\n<p>Mexico City-based artist <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/omr.mz\" target=\"_blank\">Omar Mendoza</a> taps into the persistence of ancestral knowledge for his newest series of paintings in <em>Serpiente Solar 〰 Noche Obsidiana</em>, or <em>Solar Serpent 〰 Obsidian Night</em>, at <a href=\"https://povoschicago.com/exhibitions/35-serpiente-solar-noche-obsidiana-solo-show-omar-mendoza-curated-by-victoria-rivers/\" target=\"_blank\">Povos</a>. Conjuring hues from native plants, tree bark, and flowers collected from his father’s hometown, supplemented with pigments sourced from local markets, the existence of Mendoza’s works are themselves a symbolic form of resistance.</p>\n<figure><img src=\"https://www.thisiscolossal.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/mendoza-3-960x640.jpg\" alt=\"detail of a natural pigment painting by Omar Mendoza, featuring cosmic symbols and visual motifs evoking Mesoamerican ancestry\" srcset=\"https://www.thisiscolossal.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/mendoza-3-960x640.jpg 960w, https://www.thisiscolossal.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/mendoza-3-640x427.jpg 640w, https://www.thisiscolossal.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/mendoza-3-768x512.jpg 768w, https://www.thisiscolossal.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/mendoza-3-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://www.thisiscolossal.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/mendoza-3.jpg 2000w\" /><figcaption>Detail of “Lluvia florida”</figcaption></figure>\n<p>Visually, the artist’s compositions evoke cosmic power and sacred rhythm. As Mendoza reaches toward the sanctity of time-honored cultural wisdom, he connects both celestial and earthly forces, depicting multitudes of intuition and insight through motifs such as stars, planetary objects, snakes, eagles, vines, and more.</p>\n<p>Victoria Rivers’ curatorial text shares:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Omar Mendoza creates these works from a cosmovision in which everything is alive and in relationship: water, stone, plants, fire, night. In that web of sacred correspondences, painting becomes an act of reciprocity with the earth and its cycles.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Symmetry flows through several of Mendoza’s paintings, calling to the mirroring of two worlds. Nonetheless, tactile washes of pink, blue, violet, and yellow atop hand-prepared canvases sumptuously intertwine, presenting a transcendent sense of harmony across Mendoza’s series of works, calling once more to the cyclical energy that courses through them.</p>\n<p><em>Serpiente Solar 〰 Noche Obsidiana</em> opens on October 4 in Chicago.

According to the museum’s announcement, the search for its next director will begin this month.</p>\n<p>Phillips told <em>Hyperallergic</em> in a statement that her departure was “not an easy decision,” but comes at a “natural transition point” following the museum’s reopening.</p>\n<p>“After much thought and consideration, I have decided that it will then be the right time for me to step down after 26 years at the helm and pass the baton to the next generation of leaders who will chart the course of this next chapter,” Phillips said.</p>\n<p>Phillips’s tenure has been marked by significant transformation and bitter labor controversy at the storied contemporary arts institution. Her leadership began in 1999 when she left her longtime curatorial role at the Whitney Museum of American Art to take the reins from the New Museum’s late founder, Marcia Tucker. Under her direction, the institution grew from an experimental arts organization with temporary locations and a staff of 25 people into a monolithic museum in the Lower East Side’s Bowery with approximately 450,000 visitors a year and a 150-person staff. Over the last two and a half decades, Phillips has overseen more than 200 exhibitions, including solo shows for <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://hyperallergic.com/322742/reflections-from-black-women-artists-for-black-lives-matter/\">Simone Leigh</a>, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.newmuseum.org/exhibition/jeffrey-gibson-the-anthropophagic-effect-2/\">Jeffrey Gibson</a>, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.newmuseum.org/exhibition/faith-ringgold-american-people/\">Faith Ringgold</a>, and <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://hyperallergic.com/825474/wangechi-mutu-corporeal-archaeology-new-museum/\">Wangechi Mutu</a>, and launched the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://hyperallergic.com/426674/new-museum-triennial-2018-songs-for-sabotage/\">New Museum Triennial</a>, dedicated to international early-career artists.</p>\n<p>Phillips’s leadership has also been marked by a series of labor controversies, particularly in recent years, as unionized staff accused management of poor working conditions, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://hyperallergic.com/581922/new-museum-faces-charges-of-unfair-labor-practices-in-a-union-complaint/\">unfair labor practices</a>, and <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://hyperallergic.com/507015/new-museum-union-rallies-against-stalled-contract-negotiations-during-summer-exhibition-openings/\">stalled contract negotiations</a>.</p>\n<p>Workers have also <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://hyperallergic.com/581180/new-museum-recalls-some-furloughed-workers-union-calls-for-greater-reform/\">scrutinized the pay disparities</a> between staff and executive leadership. (According to the museum’s 2024 tax filings, Phillips’s compensation totaled nearly $900,000.) The dispute peaked during the 2020 pandemic, when the museum <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://hyperallergic.com/574854/brooklyn-museum-new-museum-layoffs/\">laid off 18 full- and part-time staff</a>, including members of the union’s bargaining unit, citing revenue losses despite <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://hyperallergic.com/575406/nyc-art-museums-galleries-ppp-loans/\">receiving</a> a Paycheck Protection Program loan of $1–2 million. In response, the union <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://hyperallergic.com/581922/new-museum-faces-charges-of-unfair-labor-practices-in-a-union-complaint/\">filed a complaint</a> with the National Labor Relations Board alleging that the museum had deliberately targeted union supporters in its staff reductions. (The New Museum refuted the claim at the time, telling <em>Hyperallergic</em> that they “[did not] believe this charge has merit.”)</p>\n<p>In response to <em>Hyperallergic</em>’s inquiry about Phillips’s departure and the museum’s search for a new director, a spokesperson for Local 2110 UAW, which represents the New Museum Union, said that they “look forward to developing a good collective bargaining relationship with the new Museum leadership and to negotiating further improvements to the union membership’s working conditions and economic status.” </p>\n<p>The announcement of Phillips’s forthcoming departure comes amid leadership changes at major museums in the city. This month, Shamim M. Momin, co-founder of the nonprofit Los Angeles Nomadic Division (LAND), began her new post as <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://hyperallergic.com/1027302/shamim-momin-bronx-museum-new-director/\">director of the Bronx Museum</a>. Meanwhile, Christophe Cherix, the previous chief curator of drawings and prints at the Museum of Modern Art, has <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://hyperallergic.com/999529/christophe-cherix-named-moma-new-director/\">started his new role</a> as the institution’s seventh director after Glenn Lowry’s <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://hyperallergic.com/949551/moma-director-glenn-lowry-steps-down-after-30-years/\">departure</a> last year.</p>\n\t</div>\n\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://hyperallergic.com/author/maya-pontone/\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img alt=\"Avatar photo\" src=\"https://hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2024/11/cropped-IMG_8942-scaled-1.jpg\" srcset=\"https://hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2024/11/cropped-IMG_8942-scaled-1.jpg 2x\" />\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</a></p><div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMaya Pontone (she/her) is a Staff News Writer at Hyperallergic.

The risk of leaving artworks so exposed is the tradeoff of letting everyone appreciate them, rather than putting them in a vault or a wealthy person’s compound. That tension is at the heart of <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://hyperallergic.com/736803/showing-up-kelly-reichardt-review/\">Kelly Reichardt</a>’s new highly idiosyncratic art heist film <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.filmlinc.org/films/the-mastermind/\"><em>The Mastermind</em></a> (2025), soon screening as part of this year’s New York Film Festival before opening in theaters on October 17.</p>\n<p>The thing about art theft is that, contra its sexy, intrigue-heavy portrayal in films like <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0155267/\"><em>The Thomas Crown Affair</em></a><em> </em>or <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.imdb.com/find/?q=Entrapment&ref_=tt_nv_srb_sm\"><em>Entrapment</em></a><em> </em>(both 1999), it actually tends to not be that complicated. A lot of the time, you can just yoink a painting off the wall and run. (My editor advised me to stress that this is in no way a suggestion.) In 1972, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.telegram.com/picture-gallery/news/2022/05/04/photos-50-years-after-worcester-art-museum-heist/9648241002/\">some guys held up the Worcester Art Museum</a> and made off with a Picasso, two Gauguins, and a piece from Rembrandt’s studio. The pinnacle of such crimes is, of course, the 1990 <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://hyperallergic.com/381275/gardner-museum-doubles-reward-to-10m-for-return-of-art-stolen-in-1990/\">Isabella Stewart Gardner Museum heist</a>, which two dudes pulled off not by dodging laser alarms or cracking complex locks, but simply tricking the guards by posing as cops. The tradition continues to this day; Reichardt teaches at Bard, and just last year, a biology student there <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.timesunion.com/hudsonvalley/news/article/bard-college-art-heist-drone-edith-neumann-19871203.php\">tried to make off with two paintings</a> before being hunted down with a police drone. (He was banned from campus but “allowed to finish his coursework remotely.”)</p>\n<figure><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/09/fsb3P-1200x800.jpeg?resize=1200%2C800&quality=90&ssl=1\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/09/fsb3P.jpeg?resize=1200%2C800&quality=90&ssl=1 1200w, https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/09/fsb3P.jpeg?resize=720%2C480&quality=90&ssl=1 720w, https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/09/fsb3P.jpeg?resize=768%2C512&quality=90&ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/09/fsb3P.jpeg?resize=1024%2C683&quality=90&ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/09/fsb3P.jpeg?resize=780%2C520&quality=90&ssl=1 780w, https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/09/fsb3P.jpeg?resize=400%2C267&quality=90&ssl=1 400w, https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/09/fsb3P.jpeg?resize=706%2C471&quality=90&ssl=1 706w, https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/09/fsb3P.jpeg?w=1500&quality=90&ssl=1 1500w, https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/09/fsb3P-1200x800.jpeg?w=370&quality=90&ssl=1 370w\" /><figcaption>Film still of <em>The Mastermind</em> (2025), directed by Kelly Reichardt</figcaption></figure>\n<p>These kinds of blue-collar art thefts were Reichardt’s inspiration for the plot of the film. When JB (Josh O’Connor, playing an art criminal <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://hyperallergic.com/903260/alice-rohrwacher-la-chimera-film-suggests-we-call-indiana-jones-what-he-is-grave-robber/\">for the second time in as many years</a>) and some compatriots decide to rob their local museum, they don’t plot anything terribly elaborate — they’ll nab a few Arthur Dove paintings, run past the always-asleep guard, and drive off in a waiting stolen car. Yet even this simple crime in the sleepy Massachusetts town of Framingham in the early 1970s runs into unforeseen snags and consequences. Reichardt has <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movies/movie-news/kelly-reichardt-the-mastermind-josh-oconnor-cannes-1236227650/\">described</a> <em>The Mastermind </em>as “an aftermath film, an unraveling film,” and the way JB spirals — embarking on one of the more pathetic fugitive runs I’ve ever seen in the heist genre — makes the title increasingly ironic.</p>\n<p>Reichardt is one of the cannier cinematic chroniclers of United States history, with each of her period pieces in some way undermining myths, like the masculine frontiersman in <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1518812/?ref_=fn_all_ttl_1\"><em>Meek’s Cutoff</em></a> (2011) or <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://hyperallergic.com/546493/kelly-reichardt-on-first-cow-and-poking-fun-at-masculinity/\"><em>First Cow</em></a> (2019). <em>The Mastermind </em>is not situated in the ’70s as mere affectation. This was just after the golden age of <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.britannica.com/art/Western-architecture/After-World-War-II\">municipal institutions amid postwar economic prosperity</a>. Innumerable smaller cities and towns got beautiful new libraries, city halls, and museums. In real life, Framingham didn’t yet have an art museum at the time, so the production used a perfect example of such architecture — the I. M. Pei-designed <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://columbus.in.us/pei-library/\">Cleo Rogers Memorial Library</a> in Columbus, Indiana, with its beautiful brickwork — as its exterior stand-in. </p>\n<figure><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/09/r2ym4-1200x675.jpeg?resize=1200%2C675&quality=90&ssl=1\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/09/r2ym4.jpeg?resize=1200%2C675&quality=90&ssl=1 1200w, https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/09/r2ym4.jpeg?resize=720%2C405&quality=90&ssl=1 720w, https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/09/r2ym4.jpeg?resize=768%2C432&quality=90&ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/09/r2ym4.jpeg?resize=1536%2C864&quality=90&ssl=1 1536w, https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/09/r2ym4.jpeg?resize=1024%2C576&quality=90&ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/09/r2ym4.jpeg?resize=780%2C439&quality=90&ssl=1 780w, https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/09/r2ym4.jpeg?resize=400%2C225&quality=90&ssl=1 400w, https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/09/r2ym4.jpeg?resize=706%2C397&quality=90&ssl=1 706w, https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/09/r2ym4.jpeg?w=1777&quality=90&ssl=1 1777w, https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/09/r2ym4-1200x675.jpeg?w=370&quality=90&ssl=1 370w\" /><figcaption>Film still of <em>The Mastermind</em> (2025), directed by Kelly Reichardt</figcaption></figure>\n<p>The choice of art to target — Dove’s “Tree Forms” (1932), “Willow Tree” (1937), “Tanks & Snowbanks” (1938), and “Yellow Blue Green Brown” (1941) — is also deliberate. Dove was a modernist and is sometimes called the first American abstract painter. When news of the heist breaks, JB’s father expresses befuddlement at all the fuss, because he can’t see why anyone cared about these drawings in the first place. That’s a signpost of the conservative turn of the era, and the movie only deepens in post-’60s malaise as it goes.</p>\n<p>Reichardt often follows protagonists unmoored from society, whether they’re the settlers of <em>Meek’s Cutoff</em> and <em>First Cow </em>or<em> </em>the drifter in <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1152850/?ref_=fn_all_ttl_1\"><em>Wendy and Lucy</em></a><em> </em>(2008). In <em>The Mastermind, </em>JB becomes lost in something much scarier than the wilderness: Nixon’s America. Conversations with other characters reveal that he’s a former art student dissatisfied with his everyday suburban existence, the kind of stultifying middle-class lifestyle constructed for millions after World War II. But it turns out there are worse things than a spiritually empty family life. Amid crackdowns on antiwar protests, and friends and comrades who either have no time for him or sell him out in a heartbeat, JB learns the hard way that, with the spirit of the ’60s well and truly dead, the establishment ethos that’s replaced it is far more hostile and alienating.</p>\n<p><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.filmlinc.org/films/the-mastermind/\">The Mastermind</a><em>, directed by Kelly Reichardt, will be showing in the </em><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.filmlinc.org/nyff/\"><em>New York Film Festival</em></a><em> from September 27 to October 23, and the film opens in theaters on October 17</em>.</p>\n\t</div>\n\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://hyperallergic.com/author/dan-schindel/\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img alt=\"Avatar photo\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2022/08/Dan-smaller.jpg?fit=200%2C200&quality=100&ssl=1\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2022/08/Dan-smaller.jpg?fit=200%2C200&quality=100&ssl=1 2x\" />\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</a></p><div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tDan Schindel is a freelance writer and copy editor living in Brooklyn, and a former associate editor at Hyperallergic.

(all photos Isa Farfan/<i>Hyperallergic</i>)</span></figcaption>\n\t\t\t</figure>\n\t\t\t\t<div>\n<article>\n\t<div>\n<p>Thousands of demonstrators calling for an end to Israel’s mass killings of Palestinians gathered in New York City’s Times Square on Friday morning, September 26, as Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu took to the podium to address the United Nations (UN) General Assembly at around 9am.</p>\n<p>About an hour later, the demonstrators marched toward the UN headquarters on the east side of Midtown Manhattan, where they were met with a heavy police presence and kettled across First Avenue. Protesters carried signs calling for Netanyahu to be arrested for perpetrating genocide, as characterized in a <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.ohchr.org/en/press-releases/2025/09/israel-has-committed-genocide-gaza-strip-un-commission-finds\">UN special report</a> earlier this month, and drawing attention to the plight of children in Gaza. They chanted “Free Palestine!” and “Up with revolution, down with occupation,” and called for an international arms embargo on Israel. Among the most striking protest art and placards were hand-painted signs, a small baby doll splattered in red paint, and a mirror written with the words “This is what you did during genocide.”</p>\n<p>William Chan, a New York City-based photographer and United States Army veteran, attended the demonstration in his military fatigues and stood alongside other veterans calling for the end of US participation in Israel’s assault on Gaza.</p>\n<p>“I love my country,” Chan told <em>Hyperallergic. </em>“We are crumbling right now between imperialism and fascism … But we can change it by being better.”</p>\n<p>Netanyahu’s highly criticized visit comes as the death toll in Gaza surpasses <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.pbs.org/newshour/world/palestinian-death-toll-in-gaza-passes-64000-officials-say-after-ceasefire-talks-break-down\">65,000 people</a> since October 2023.</p>\n<p>“We are helping Israel with genocide, and that is a moral crime,” Chan said.</p>\n<p>Inside the UN this morning, dozens of ambassadors <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cderxxylpzdo\">reportedly</a> walked out during Netanyahu’s speech. In recent months, several nations, including France, Canada, and Britain, have declared their recognition of an independent Palestinian state, which Netanyahu emphatically rejected during his General Assembly speech. Netanyahu’s address follows President Donald Trump’s <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2025/09/23/politics/united-nations-trump-speech-annotated\">remarks</a> to the assembly earlier this week, in which he stated that nations open to immigration were “going to hell.”</p>\n<p>This year’s session is the 80th convening of the UN General Assembly, which <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://press.un.org/en/2025/ga12708.doc.htm\">voted overwhelmingly</a> last week to let the Palestinian officials participate in the conference after Trump’s government denied them visas to enter the US. (Only five countries voted against Palestinian participation in the diplomatic event, including Israel and the United States.)</p>\n<p>Below is a selection of photographs from today’s protest captured
