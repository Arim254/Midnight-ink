Of those books, none is more wide­ly known to the pub­lic — or, still, more wide­ly read by the pub­lic — than <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://amzn.to/3KqONID\"><em>Cos­mos</em></a>, accom­pa­nied as it was by <em>Cos­mos: A Per­son­al Voy­age</em>, a com­pan­ion tele­vi­sion series on PBS. Sagan’s oth­er pop­u­lar books, like <em>Shad­ows of For­got­ten Ances­tors</em> or <em>Con­tact</em> (the basis of the 1997 Hol­ly­wood movie) are also well worth read­ing, but we per­haps ignore at our great­est per­il <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://amzn.to/4nrc8sg\"><em>The Demon-Haunt­ed World: Sci­ence as a Can­dle in the Dark</em></a>. Pub­lished in 1995, the year before Sagan’s death, it stands as his tes­ta­ment to the impor­tance of crit­i­cal, sci­en­tif­ic think­ing for all of us.</p>\n<p><em><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://amzn.to/4nrc8sg\">The Demon-Haunt­ed World</a> </em>is the sub­ject of the <em>Genet­i­cal­ly Mod­i­fied Skep­tic</em> video above, whose host Drew McCoy describes it as his favorite book. He pays spe­cial atten­tion to its chap­ter in which Sagan lays out what he calls his “baloney detec­tion kit.” This assem­bled metaphor­i­cal box of tools for diag­nos­ing fraud­u­lent argu­ments and con­struct­ing rea­soned ones involves these nine prin­ci­ples:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Wher­ev­er pos­si­ble there must be inde­pen­dent con­fir­ma­tion of the “facts.”</li>\n<li>Encour­age sub­stan­tive debate on the evi­dence by knowl­edge­able pro­po­nents of all points of view.</li>\n<li>Argu­ments from author­i­ty car­ry lit­tle weight — “author­i­ties” have made mis­takes in the past. They will do so again in the future. Per­haps a bet­ter way to say it is that in sci­ence there are no author­i­ties; at most, there are experts.</li>\n<li>Spin more than one hypoth­e­sis. If there’s some­thing to be explained, think of all the dif­fer­ent ways in which it could be explained. Then think of tests by which you might sys­tem­at­i­cal­ly dis­prove each of the alter­na­tives.</li>\n<li>Try not to get over­ly attached to a hypoth­e­sis just because it’s yours. It’s only a way sta­tion in the pur­suit of knowl­edge. Ask your­self why you like the idea. Com­pare it fair­ly with the alter­na­tives.</li>\n<li>See if you can find rea­sons for reject­ing it. If you don’t, oth­ers will.</li>\n<li>If what­ev­er it is you’re explain­ing has some mea­sure, some numer­i­cal quan­ti­ty attached to it, you’ll be much bet­ter able to dis­crim­i­nate among com­pet­ing hypothe­ses. What is vague and qual­i­ta­tive is open to many expla­na­tions.</li>\n<li>If there’s a chain of argu­ment, every link in the chain must work (includ­ing the premise) — not just most of them.</li>\n<li>Occam’s Razor. This con­ve­nient rule-of-thumb urges us when faced with two hypothe­ses that explain the data equal­ly well to choose the sim­pler. Always ask whether the hypoth­e­sis can be, at least in prin­ci­ple, fal­si­fied…. You must be able to check asser­tions out. Invet­er­ate skep­tics must be giv­en the chance to fol­low your rea­son­ing, to dupli­cate your exper­i­ments and see if they get the same result.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>As McCoy points out, these tech­niques of mind have to do with can­cel­ing out the man­i­fold bias­es present in our think­ing, those nat­ur­al human ten­den­cies that incline us to accept ideas that may or may not coin­cide with real­i­ty as it is. If we take no trou­ble to cor­rect for these bias­es, Sagan came to believe, we’ll become easy marks for all the trick­sters and char­la­tans who hap­pen to come our way. And that’s just on the micro lev­el: on the macro lev­el, vul­ner­a­bil­i­ty to delu­sion can <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.openculture.com/2025/02/carl-sagan-predicts-the-decline-of-america-unable-to-know-whats-true.html\">bring down entire civ­i­liza­tions</a>.</p>\n<p>“Like all tools, the baloney detec­tion kit can be mis­used, applied out of con­text, or even employed as a rote alter­na­tive to think­ing,” Sagan cau­tions. “But applied judi­cious­ly, it can make all the dif­fer­ence in the world — not least in eval­u­at­ing our own argu­ments before we present them to oth­ers.” McCoy urges us to heed these words, adding that “this kit is not some per­fect solu­tion to the world’s prob­lems, but as it’s been uti­lized over the last few cen­turies” — for its basic pre­cepts long pre­date Sagan’s par­tic­u­lar artic­u­la­tion — “it has enabled us to cre­ate tech­no­log­i­cal inno­va­tions and use­ful explana­to­ry mod­els of our world more quick­ly and effec­tive­ly than ever before.” The walls of baloney may always be clos­ing in on human­i­ty, but if you fol­low Sagan’s advice, you can at least give your­self some breath­ing room.</p>\n<p><strong>Relat­ed con­tent:</strong></p>\n<p><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.openculture.com/2020/12/carl-sagan-on-the-importance-of-choosing-wisely-what-you-read.html\">Carl Sagan on the Impor­tance of Choos­ing Wise­ly What You Read (Even If You Read a Book a Week)</a></p>\n<p><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.openculture.com/2018/01/carl-sagans-syllabus-final-exam-for-his-course-on-critical-thinking-cornell-1986.html\">Carl Sagan’s Syl­labus & Final Exam for His Course on Crit­i­cal Think­ing (Cor­nell, 1986)</a></p>\n<p><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.openculture.com/2025/02/carl-sagan-predicts-the-decline-of-america-unable-to-know-whats-true.html\">Carl Sagan Pre­dicts the Decline of Amer­i­ca: Unable to Know “What’s True,” We Will Slide, “With­out Notic­ing, Back into Super­sti­tion & Dark­ness” (1995)</a></p>\n<p><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.openculture.com/2024/08/richard-feynman-creates-a-simple-method-for-telling-science-from-pseudoscience.html\">Richard Feyn­man Cre­ates a Sim­ple Method for Telling Sci­ence From Pseu­do­science (1966)</a></p>\n<p><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.openculture.com/2023/07/how-to-spot-bullshit-a-manual-by-princeton-philosopher-harry-frankfurt-rip.html\">How to Spot Bull­shit: A Man­u­al by Prince­ton Philoso­pher Har­ry Frank­furt (RIP)</a></p>\n<p><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.openculture.com/critical-thinking-a-free-course\">Crit­i­cal Think­ing: A Free Course</a></p>\n<p><em>Based in Seoul, </em><em><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://blog.colinmarshall.org/\">Col­in</a></em><em><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://blog.colinmarshall.org/\"> M</a></em><em><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://blog.colinmarshall.org/\">a</a></em><em><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://blog.colinmarshall.org/\">rshall</a> writes and broad­cas</em><em>ts on cities, lan­guage, and cul­ture.

Half a cen­tu­ry ago, she was just anoth­er young stage actress in New York, albeit one rapid­ly ascend­ing the rungs of the­atri­cal pres­tige, doing three Shake­speare plays and then star­ring in Weill, Haupt­mann, and Brecht’s <em>Hap­py End</em> on Broad­way. <em>The Deer Hunter</em>, <em>Kramer vs. Kramer</em>, <em>Out of Africa</em>,<em> Post­cards from the Edge</em>, <em>The Bridges of Madi­son Coun­ty</em>: all this lay in her future in 1976, the year of her fea­ture debut.</p>\n<p>Streep made that debut in <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AO5SixiWjZ4\"><em>Every­body Rides the Carousel</em></a>, a now-obscure ani­mat­ed film that dra­ma­tizes post-Freudi­an psy­chol­o­gist <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erik_Erikson\">Erik Erik­son</a>’s <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erikson%27s_stages_of_psychosocial_development\">eight stages of psy­choso­cial devel­op­ment</a>.

Prior to this transitional period, which archaeologists refer to as the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neolithic_Revolution\" target=\"_blank\">Neolithic Revolution</a>—the final phase of the Stone Age—small societies were organized around hunting and gathering for sustenance. During the Neolithic period, the gradual adoption of agricultural practices forever changed the way we live.</p>\n<p>Over the next few thousand years, humans began domesticating plants and practicing animal husbandry in different parts of the world. And with less time needed for farming than for nomadically searching for food, ancient people could enjoy other activities that led to economic, political, religious, and artistic developments.</p>\n<figure><img src=\"https://www.thisiscolossal.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/earthworks-3.jpg\" alt=\"people working on a grassy earthwork\" srcset=\"https://www.thisiscolossal.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/earthworks-3.jpg 2000w, https://www.thisiscolossal.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/earthworks-3-640x480.jpg 640w, https://www.thisiscolossal.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/earthworks-3-960x720.jpg 960w, https://www.thisiscolossal.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/earthworks-3-768x576.jpg 768w, https://www.thisiscolossal.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/earthworks-3-1536x1152.jpg 1536w\" /><figcaption>The excavation follows the future layout of the walking path in the park, which will lead from the visitor pavilion to the circular ditch.

It’s also when iconically old structures like Ireland’s Newgrange passage tomb and England’s Stonehenge complex were built, the latter of which was begun around 3100 B.C.E. and finished around 600 years later. For context, when Stonehenge was in its final phase, construction of the Pyramids of Giza was likely in progress. Recently, a series of circular earthworks dating to the 5th millennium B.C.E. (5000 to 4001 B.C.E.) in Burgenland, Austria, may predate much of Stonehenge by a remarkable 2,000 years.</p>\n<p>At the newly excavated site, three monumental structures sit in close proximity to one another near the town of Rechnitz. The earthworks were initially discovered via aerial and geomagnetic surveys between 2011 and 2017. A total of four were found, three of which are ring-shaped structures that were previously invisible to the naked eye. </p>\n<p>Known as circular ditch systems, the structures were built in the Middle Neolithic period—sometime between 4850 and 4500 B.C.E.—making them at least 6,500 years old.</p>\n<p>“The Rechnitz site can be considered a supra-regional center of the Middle Neolithic period,” says Nikolaus Franz, the director of Burgenland Archaeology, in a <a href=\"https://www-burgenland-at.translate.goog/news-detail/fenster-in-die-steinzeit-grabungen-in-rechnitz-bringen-neue-erkenntnisse-ueber-die-neolithische-besiedelung-des-suedburgenlandes?_x_tr_sl=auto&_x_tr_tl=en&_x_tr_hl=en&_x_tr_pto=wapp\" target=\"_blank\">statement</a>. In the ditches measuring as much as 340 feet across, archaeologists have documented pits containing ceramic finds and post holes that indicate where timber beams in the ground once supported shelters.</p>\n<figure><img src=\"https://www.thisiscolossal.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/earthworks-4.jpg\" alt=\"a drawing and excavation of a grassy earthwork\" srcset=\"https://www.thisiscolossal.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/earthworks-4.jpg 2000w, https://www.thisiscolossal.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/earthworks-4-640x853.jpg 640w, https://www.thisiscolossal.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/earthworks-4-960x1280.jpg 960w, https://www.thisiscolossal.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/earthworks-4-768x1024.jpg 768w, https://www.thisiscolossal.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/earthworks-4-1152x1536.jpg 1152w, https://www.thisiscolossal.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/earthworks-4-1536x2048.jpg 1536w\" /></figure>\n<p>Circular ditch monuments of this type, known as <em><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neolithic_circular_enclosures_in_Central_Europe\" target=\"_blank\">Kreisgrabenanlagen</a></em> in German, are consistently found throughout Central Europe. While their intended function remains unknown, researchers generally believe they held an ancient religious, or cultic, purpose. Similar to Stonehenge, their orientation includes openings that align with the solstices and seem to correspond to an astronomical calendar.</p>\n<p>“The excavations open a veritable window into the Stone Age,” Franz says. “We are learning a great deal about the Neolithic settler clans who found this a favorable location to establish the cultural techniques of agriculture and livestock farming in what is now Burgenland…After centuries of hunting and gathering, the gradual settlement of humans was truly revolutionary.”</p>\n<p>You might also enjoy exploring the phenomenal complex of more than <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.thisiscolossal.com/2023/10/amazon-earthworks/\">10,000 earthworks</a> made by prehistoric Indigenous societies in the Amazon basin.</p>\n<figure><img src=\"https://www.thisiscolossal.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/earthworks-1.jpg\" alt=\"an aerial view of a round earthwork\" srcset=\"https://www.thisiscolossal.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/earthworks-1.jpg 2000w, https://www.thisiscolossal.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/earthworks-1-640x480.jpg 640w, https://www.thisiscolossal.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/earthworks-1-960x720.jpg 960w, https://www.thisiscolossal.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/earthworks-1-768x576.jpg 768w, https://www.thisiscolossal.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/earthworks-1-1536x1152.jpg 1536w\" /></figure>\n\t</div>\n\t</article>\n\t</section>"

    "body": "<section>\n<article>\n\t<div>\n<p>If you were to have visited the 3600 Block of Heidelberg Street in Detroit around 1986, you would have likely encountered a young artist beginning the project of a lifetime. Found object assemblages and painted patterns were quickly transforming a neighborhood that had experienced mass disinvestment, turning grassy lots and abandoned homes into an enclave of creativity.</p>\n<p>Soon, an immersive, vernacular art environment emerged and was at once an amalgamation of everyday materials and what seemed to be a mystical translation from another realm. The creator behind the sprawling installation—which continues today—is artist Tyree Guyton, who dubbed what would become his most famous work in his home neighborhood of McDougall Hunt, <a href=\"https://www.heidelberg.org/\" target=\"_blank\"><em>The Heidelberg Project</em></a>.</p>\n<figure><img src=\"https://www.thisiscolossal.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/heidelberg-4.jpg\" alt=\"The Heidelberg Project outdoor art environment in Detroit\" srcset=\"https://www.thisiscolossal.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/heidelberg-4.jpg 2000w, https://www.thisiscolossal.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/heidelberg-4-640x423.jpg 640w, https://www.thisiscolossal.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/heidelberg-4-960x635.jpg 960w, https://www.thisiscolossal.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/heidelberg-4-768x508.jpg 768w, https://www.thisiscolossal.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/heidelberg-4-1536x1016.jpg 1536w\" /><figcaption>Site view of ‘The Heidelberg Project’ (1986–ongoing)</figcaption></figure>\n<p>Spanning nearly four decades and several blocks, the ever-evolving environment has become a destination for tourists and locals alike as Guyton’s spiritual philosophies reach every inch of the property. There’s the iconic polka-dot house, another covered in long paintings of shoes, a collection of portraits on car hoods, and countless sculptures and assemblages that seem to take on a life of their own. Because the works are exposed to the elements, maintenance and upcycling occur regularly at the project, as the artist adds to an existing piece or transforms materials anew.</p>\n<p>Several of Guyton’s standalone works are on view at the <a href=\"https://www.jmkac.org/\" target=\"_blank\">John Michael Kohler Arts Center</a> in Sheboygan, Wisconsin. A large-scale presentation of the artist’s decades-long outdoor and studio projects, <em>Heidelbergology: Is It Art Now? </em>is rooted in what the museum describes as “the study of discarded material incorporated into the fabric and structure of a community and the effects on the community.” </p>\n<p>Guyton, on the other hand, is much more abstract, offering the following in a phone conversation from Detroit. “That’s what this show is about, magic. Two plus two equals eight, Heidelbergology…There are people there that have not been here, and I came there to give them a reason to come. It’s an invitation.”</p>\n<p>While exhibiting in a traditional white-cube gallery space, Guyton brings his community focus to Sheboygan. He invited locals to paint his beloved polka dots on the walls, providing a vivid and expressive backdrop for his expansive works. Looming in the entrance is Guyton’s version of Noah’s Ark, composed of crowd-sourced stuffed animals and children’s toys piled high atop a painted fishing boat.</p>\n<figure><img src=\"https://www.thisiscolossal.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/heidelberg-10.jpg\" alt=\"an installation of car doors by Tyree Guyton against polka dotted walls\" srcset=\"https://www.thisiscolossal.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/heidelberg-10.jpg 2000w, https://www.thisiscolossal.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/heidelberg-10-640x427.jpg 640w, https://www.thisiscolossal.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/heidelberg-10-960x640.jpg 960w, https://www.thisiscolossal.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/heidelberg-10-768x512.jpg 768w, https://www.thisiscolossal.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/heidelberg-10-1536x1025.jpg 1536w\" /><figcaption>“Auto World” (1998), mixed media and paint</figcaption></figure>\n<p>Guyton makes an explicit connection to the divine—and Yahweh, in particular—throughout the exhibition and his work, more broadly. He considers <em>The Heidelberg Project</em> to be both a mirror to society and also a conduit to a higher power, one whose messages he translates and shares with anyone who might encounter the work.</p>\n<p>“What I see happening in the world? I put it on those TV sets, put it in a museum, turn it into works of art, to give it back to the public and to say to them, look at what’s happening,” he says. “Like, can we see it? I see it through me.”</p>\n<p>The exhibition also nods to the artist’s own history and his grandfather, Sam Mackey, who first introduced Guyton to art as a child. A collection of Mackey’s drawings made at the end of his life is suspended in a house-shaped structure at the center of the museum. These familial works aren’t typically on view in Detroit and offer special, often-unseen insight into the artist’s background.</p>\n<p>As Guyton and the project’s team prepare for the future, they intend to transfer <em>The Heidelberg Project</em> to the community, who they hope will steward the enormous effort and further invest in the neighborhood. “I’m here to do something that when I die, it’s going to live on,” the artist says. “I believe that what I have done here is so philosophical, it’s teaching me, and I love making mistakes.” </p>\n<figure><img src=\"https://www.thisiscolossal.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/heidelberg-1.jpg\" alt=\"The Heidelberg Project outdoor art environment in Detroit\" srcset=\"https://www.thisiscolossal.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/heidelberg-1.jpg 2000w, https://www.thisiscolossal.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/heidelberg-1-640x423.jpg 640w, https://www.thisiscolossal.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/heidelberg-1-960x635.jpg 960w, https://www.thisiscolossal.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/heidelberg-1-768x508.jpg 768w, https://www.thisiscolossal.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/heidelberg-1-1536x1016.jpg 1536w\" /><figcaption>Site view of ‘The Heidelberg Project’ (1986–ongoing)</figcaption></figure>\n<p>While hoping to secure support for the project, Guyton isn’t precious about his work and easily embraces change. When the exhibition in Sheboygan wraps, for example, the sculptures and paintings that have been so meticulously cared for in a museum setting will be returned outdoors, although they might find themselves in a new spot if the artist filled the previous location with something new.</p>\n<p>In this way, <em>The Heidelberg Project</em> is always in motion, presenting new messages for Guyton to learn and share through a graffiti-covered television set or a collaged work on panel. When asked how he feels a piece is complete, he answers clearly: “My work is finished when I’m dead.”</p>\n<p>See <em>Heidelbergology: Is It Art Now? </em>through February 15, 2026.
