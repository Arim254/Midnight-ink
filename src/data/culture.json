I got you. “My man!” This is the moment in the film where Isaiah White, played by Marlon Wayans, is going to teach Cameron Cade, played by Tyriq Withers a lesson in how to be a great quarterback. In this lesson, I did a lot of research about quarterback drills that hone in on specific skills. For example, in a pro game, you want to be able to get the ball out of your hands under two seconds. So that’s why we have two seconds on the clock and to work on that speed that’s required of decision making. That’s why he’s turned away from the actual receivers. He has his eyes closed. So that you’re forced into a panic-like situation, and you have to throw the ball as quickly as possible. So what I really wanted to communicate in this scene specifically, was that there’s going to be a big tonal shift from something’s off to something’s very wrong, and it’s the first time we’re going to introduce violence and a dynamic between the two characters that becomes much more like a narcissistic, abusive relationship than a mentor-mentee “Too slow.” But seed it and bury that under the guise of hazing and just being a rookie. And what I landed on was this idea of using this JUGS machine to be that conduit of punishment. I also didn’t want him to have time to process anything. That’s why I kind of try to get music and a rhythm going in the edit. And even the sound design is rhythmic. That vibration and metallic clanking, it escalates and grows and grows over this entire sequence. And then we have these really tight, extreme close-ups of Cameron Cade’s eyes. And that was just a creative choice I made to rely on the language of horror, where there’s a classic peekaboo.</p></dd></dl></div></div></div>"

    "body": "<p></p><h2>'Why does China prefer war?' The K-drama line that infuriated the Chinese internet</h2><p></p><div><p>In the spy romance series Tempest, Jun Ji-hyun, one of South Korea's biggest stars, plays a diplomat trying to uncover the truth behind a deadly assassination.</p><p>\"Why does China prefer war? A nuclear bomb could fall near the border,\" her character says in one episode of the new Disney+ series. </p><p>This fictional scene led to real consequences over the weekend, with many Chinese social media users taking it to be a malicious mischaracterisation of China as belligerent.<b> </b>Many are now calling for brands to sever ties with the Korean actress. </p><p>The uproar has also reignited debate over an unofficial Chinese ban on South Korean entertainment, which has been in place for nearly a decade.</p></div><div><p>While China has never admitted to a ban, the abrupt dearth of K-content since 2016 is widely believed to be a protest against South Korea's decision to deploy a US anti-missile system in 2016, which China sees as a threat to its military operations in the region.</p><p>Things had appeared to be easing in recent months, with a few South Korean performers holding concerts in China. But the controversy over Tempest has triggered a fresh wave of support for the ban.</p><p>\"Keep the K-drama ban to the death, thank you,\" reads one Weibo comment liked by 10,000 users.</p><p>While much of the anger has coalesced around Jun's line about China, social media users have also dug up other examples from the series which they view as offensive.</p><p>For example, scenes meant to portray China's Dalian city feature a bunch of dilapidated buildings, believed to be shot in Hong Kong, which some people say paints China in a bad light.</p><p>In another scene, a group of people are seated at a table set on a red carpet with yellow stars, which social media users say resembles the Chinese flag. </p><p>When Jun recited an ancient Chinese poem in another instance, viewers criticised what they viewed as her wonky accent.</p><p>All this has led to a concerted effort against Jun on Weibo, where users are pressuring brands to punish her. </p></div><div><p>According to sharp-eyed Weibo users, American skincare brand La Mer, French luxury brand Louis Vuitton and Swiss watchmaker Piaget have all scrubbed Jun from their social media accounts. </p><p>\"Besides removing Jun Ji-hyun advertisements, quickly terminate her contracts globally. Otherwise we'll boycott LV forever,\" reads one comment on Louis Vuitton's Weibo account.</p><p>Jun's agency told local news outlet MBC on Tuesday that the actress's brand campaigns were \"unrelated\" to Tempest and had ended before the show's release. </p><p>Chinese consumers are known to harness their massive spending power in pressure campaigns when they perceive insults to Chinese national pride.</p><p>Brands from Swedish fashion giant H&M to Japanese clothing chain Uniqlo and most recently Swatch - <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cn02k9ykej5o\">for an ad featuring an a</a><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cn02k9ykej5o\">llegedly</a><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cn02k9ykej5o\"> racist gesture</a> - have all found themselves the target of such boycott campaigns.</p><p>Some people have come to Jun's defence, arguing that she was not the one who wrote the controversial line.</p><p>\"Jun Ji-hyun is just an actor. It is impossible for her to understand the history of a country, the emotions of the people, and the intricate relationships between countries before making a movie,\" one Weibo user wrote, blaming the incident on the \"ignorance\" of the show's crew and writers.</p><p>But such sentiments have been drowned out by heated opposition. \"Even a washing machine can't whitewash something as well as you,\" reads a comment to the post. </p><p>\"She isn't a small-time actor. She has a choice of script, she can read the script! Who can force a popular star to do this?\" another wrote.</p><p>Jun swept to stardom with the 2001 rom-com My Sassy Girl, which took Asia by storm and established her as a noughties 'it girl'. Since then, she has found enduring success with her roles, from the 2013 fantasy romance series My Love from the Star, to the 2021 Netflix thriller Kingdom.</p><p>But like many other South Korean celebrities, she has been conspicuously missing from China's entertainment scene since the 2016 ban. </p><p>Optimism had surrounded a lifting of the ban earlier this year, as bilateral ties appeared to be warming.</p><p>In March, South Korea's foreign ministry said that the two countries' foreign ministers agreed to work on restoring cultural exchanges. The following month, South Korean hip-hop band Homies became the first all-Korean group to perform in mainland China in nearly a decade.</p><p>But it's hard to say how much K-pop and K-dramas will be let back into what was once its biggest market.</p><p>In May, K-pop boy band Epex was slated to perform in Fuzhou, in what would have been a landmark concert for K-pop in China. But their show was cancelled weeks before the event, with their management agency citing \"local circumstances\".</p><p>Last week, when asked about the postponement of another concert in Hainan province that was set to feature multiple K-pop groups, Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson Lin Jian said that China did not oppose \"beneficial cultural exchanges\" with South Korea.</p><p>Over the last decade, China has proven to be a <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/videos/c78082v5jplo\">pop culture juggernaut</a> in its own right, capable of keeping its population of 1.3 billion entertained with homegrown media. And for many Chinese viewers, the ongoing controversy surrounding Tempest has given them another reason to steer away from K-content.</p><p>\"It's already 2025 and you're still watching K-dramas, how tacky!\" wrote a Weibo user.</p></div>"

His first music album, Anamika, released in 1992, became an instant chartbuster.</p><p>His rise to stardom coincided with a period of violence linked to separatist groups in Assam. His lively melodies about love, hope and despair - embellished with catchy riffs - brought a breath of fresh air to an otherwise tense social milieu.  </p><p>By 2000, when Garg made his acting and directorial debut with an Assamese movie Tumi Mor Matho Mor, his popularity had touched new heights. </p><p>His face was regularly splashed on big billboards and his songs could be heard in markets and buses, and at college events and social gatherings.</p><p>He was a fashion icon among Assam's youth and built a larger-than-life persona with his sartorial choices, which included trendy sunglasses and ripped jeans. </p><p>Garg was also the most sought-after artist during Bihu – a cultural festival celebrated in Assam in mid-April every year. Throughout the month, he would travel around the state singing in live concerts, which were attended by thousands of people. </p><p>Large sections of Garg's fans identify him as an \"emotion\" - a pop culture figure akin to no one. </p><p>He could sing a rock song with the same ease as regional folk music and spiritual sub-genres such as Borgeet, Bihu and Zikir. This versatility broadened his fan base across generations and communities.</p></div><figure><div><p><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20250905-110137-f27f908f49-web-2.29.1-3/grey-placeholder.png\" /><img srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/b1ec/live/b88e08f0-97e0-11f0-8f46-6b3a3352ef22.jpg.webp 240w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/b1ec/live/b88e08f0-97e0-11f0-8f46-6b3a3352ef22.jpg.webp 320w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/b1ec/live/b88e08f0-97e0-11f0-8f46-6b3a3352ef22.jpg.webp 480w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/b1ec/live/b88e08f0-97e0-11f0-8f46-6b3a3352ef22.jpg.webp 640w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/b1ec/live/b88e08f0-97e0-11f0-8f46-6b3a3352ef22.jpg.webp 800w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/b1ec/live/b88e08f0-97e0-11f0-8f46-6b3a3352ef22.jpg.webp 1024w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/b1ec/live/b88e08f0-97e0-11f0-8f46-6b3a3352ef22.jpg.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/b1ec/live/b88e08f0-97e0-11f0-8f46-6b3a3352ef22.jpg.webp\" alt=\"Getty Images Fans gather to pay tribute to the portrait of singer-composer Zubeen Garg in Nagaon District of Assam\" /><span>Getty Images</span></p></div><p></p><figcaption>Zubeen Garg's versatility broadened his fan base </figcaption><p></p></figure><p></p><h2>Beyond music</h2><p></p><div><p>Beyond music, Garg was also known for his activism, even though he never associated himself with a political party.</p><p>He regularly condemned violence by separatist groups in the region, despite receiving threats.</p><p>In 2019, he played a significant role in mobilising people against a controversial new citizenship law that offered citizenship to non-Muslim religious minorities from Pakistan, Bangladesh and Afghanistan.</p><p>In 2024, Garg joined Guwahati residents protesting against the Himanta Biswa Sarma-led government for cutting trees to build a new flyover.</p><p>Garg's admirers saw him as someone who never thought twice before ruffling feathers.</p><p>\"He feared nobody.
