I got you. “My man!” This is the moment in the film where Isaiah White, played by Marlon Wayans, is going to teach Cameron Cade, played by Tyriq Withers a lesson in how to be a great quarterback. In this lesson, I did a lot of research about quarterback drills that hone in on specific skills. For example, in a pro game, you want to be able to get the ball out of your hands under two seconds. So that’s why we have two seconds on the clock and to work on that speed that’s required of decision making. That’s why he’s turned away from the actual receivers. He has his eyes closed. So that you’re forced into a panic-like situation, and you have to throw the ball as quickly as possible. So what I really wanted to communicate in this scene specifically, was that there’s going to be a big tonal shift from something’s off to something’s very wrong, and it’s the first time we’re going to introduce violence and a dynamic between the two characters that becomes much more like a narcissistic, abusive relationship than a mentor-mentee “Too slow.” But seed it and bury that under the guise of hazing and just being a rookie. And what I landed on was this idea of using this JUGS machine to be that conduit of punishment. I also didn’t want him to have time to process anything. That’s why I kind of try to get music and a rhythm going in the edit. And even the sound design is rhythmic. That vibration and metallic clanking, it escalates and grows and grows over this entire sequence. And then we have these really tight, extreme close-ups of Cameron Cade’s eyes. And that was just a creative choice I made to rely on the language of horror, where there’s a classic peekaboo.</p></dd></dl></div></div></div>"

    "body": "<div><p>Australia's national broadcaster has been ordered to pay A$150,000 (£73,435;  $99,200) in penalties for unfairly sacking a presenter over a social media post about the war in Gaza.</p><p>The Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC) took fill-in radio host Antoinette Lattouf off air in December 2023 due to her political views and after lobbying from pro-Israel groups, the Federal Court found earlier this year.</p><p>Lattouf has already been awarded A$70,000 in damages, but on Wednesday Justice Darryl Rangiah said the \"substantial\" extra sum was needed to ensure the ABC learned its lesson.</p><p>The broadcaster has publicly apologised to Lattouf, saying it also failed its staff and audiences.</p></div><div><p>Lattouf's dismissal triggered a wave of public outrage and created turmoil at the ABC - raising questions over its independence and reviving concerns over how it supports employees, particularly those who are culturally diverse.</p><p>\"The ABC let down the Australian public badly when it abjectly surrendered the rights of its employee... to appease a lobby group,\" Justice Rangiah said on Wednesday.</p><p>\"The public scrutiny the ABC has faced must surely have brought home to the ABC the unacceptability of its contravening conduct. Nevertheless, I consider that substantial penalties are necessary to ensure that the message is received and heeded.\"</p><p>Lattouf has been a regular contributor in Australian media for years, but also made a name for herself as an activist on issues like racism, discrimination in media and mental health.</p><p>She was hired for a week-long stint on ABC Radio Sydney's Mornings show, but after three shifts was told to pack up her things. The decision to remove her from the airwaves was promptly leaked to the media. </p><p>Hours earlier, Lattouf had shared a post from Human Rights Watch (HRW) that accused Israel of using starvation as a tool of war, an allegation that Israel denies but which <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cx88l499vero\">the International Criminal Court now says it has \"reasonable grounds\" to believe</a>.</p><p>The ABC argued at trial that Lattouf had been instructed not to talk about the war on social media, and that her post breached the broadcaster's editorial policy.</p><p>But in his initial judgement Justice Rangiah found that she was never given a direction not to post. While her Instagram story was \"ill-advised\", he said, Lattouf was fired with \"no more than a suspicion\" that she \"may\" have breached some policy or guideline and given no opportunity to defend herself. </p><p>There was a clear \"orchestrated\" campaign by pro-Israel lobbyists to have Lattouf taken off air right from the outset of her employment,<b> </b>and she was \"sacrificed\" by ABC management in a bid to mitigate the criticism, Justice Rangiah said on Wednesday.</p><p>\"The ABC and others cannot be allowed to regard a penalty as an acceptable price to pay for staving off criticism.\"</p><p>He said while the ABC has displayed some contrition - including through the public apology - their failure to investigate who leaked Lattouf's sacking to the media detracts from that.</p><p>The saga had caused \"very significant consequences\" for Lattouf, he said, ordering that the sum be paid to her within 28 days.</p></div>"
