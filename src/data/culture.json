Half a cen­tu­ry ago, she was just anoth­er young stage actress in New York, albeit one rapid­ly ascend­ing the rungs of the­atri­cal pres­tige, doing three Shake­speare plays and then star­ring in Weill, Haupt­mann, and Brecht’s <em>Hap­py End</em> on Broad­way. <em>The Deer Hunter</em>, <em>Kramer vs. Kramer</em>, <em>Out of Africa</em>,<em> Post­cards from the Edge</em>, <em>The Bridges of Madi­son Coun­ty</em>: all this lay in her future in 1976, the year of her fea­ture debut.</p>\n<p>Streep made that debut in <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AO5SixiWjZ4\"><em>Every­body Rides the Carousel</em></a>, a now-obscure ani­mat­ed film that dra­ma­tizes post-Freudi­an psy­chol­o­gist <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erik_Erikson\">Erik Erik­son</a>’s <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erikson%27s_stages_of_psychosocial_development\">eight stages of psy­choso­cial devel­op­ment</a>.

Grant­ed, you may nev­er have read a page of it, to say noth­ing of an entire graph­ic nov­el­’s worth, but even so, you’ve absorbed it indi­rect­ly through gen­er­a­tions of inter­na­tion­al pop­u­lar cul­ture. If you enjoy <em>Blade Run­ner</em>, <em>Aki­ra</em>, the man­ga and ani­me of Hayao Miyaza­ki, and even the Star Wars movies, you must, on some lev­el, enjoy Moe­bius, so deeply did his com­ic art shape the look and feel of those major works, to say noth­ing of all it has inspired at fur­ther remove.</p>\n<p><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QWaCsteIYig\">The new video above by Youtu­ber matttt</a> goes in depth on the bio­graph­i­cal, cul­tur­al, and psy­cho­log­i­cal force that shaped the artist’s vision on the page, whose sheer imag­i­na­tive force and per­sis­tent­ly strange sub­lim­i­ty looked like noth­ing else in comics when he hit his stride in the nine­teen-sev­en­ties. It helped that he was French, and thus an inher­i­tor of the grand Fran­coph­o­ne tra­di­tion of the <em>bande dess­inée</em>, an art form tak­en much more seri­ous­ly than com­ic strips and books in Amer­i­ca. Bel­gian comics like <em>Spirou</em> and <em>Tintin </em>caught his atten­tion ear­ly on, and time spent as a teenag­er amid the vast desert land­scapes of Mex­i­co instilled him with a taste for spir­i­tu­al grandeur.</p>\n<p>An appren­tice­ship under the Bel­gian com­ic artist Joseph “Jijé” Gillain, whom he idol­ized, helped Giraud — who had not yet become Moe­bius — to refine his style. His cre­ation of the Jean Paul Bel­mon­do-look­ing cow­boy Blue­ber­ry in the ear­ly nine­teen-six­ties pro­duced what turned out to be his most lucra­tive fran­chise.  But it was­n’t until his encounter with taboo-break­ing Amer­i­can “under­ground” comics that flour­ished lat­er in that decade, and espe­cial­ly the work of <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.openculture.com/2020/01/how-cartoons-saved-r-crumbs-life-and-how-r-crumb-turned-cartoons-into-an-art-form-nsfw.html\">Robert Crumb</a>, that he found it with­in him­self to let loose, explor­ing tech­no­log­i­cal, mytho­log­i­cal, and psy­cho­sex­u­al realms hith­er­to unknown in his medi­um.</p>\n<p>It was with the launch of the comics-anthol­o­gy mag­a­zine <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.openculture.com/2017/08/metal-hurlant.html\"><em>Métal Hurlant</em></a> in 1974, lat­er repack­aged in the Unit­ed States as <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.openculture.com/2018/03/a-digital-archive-of-heavy-metal.html\"><em>Heavy Met­al</em></a>, that Moe­bius’ work found its way to a much wider pub­lic. Notable read­ers includ­ed William Gib­son, Rid­ley Scott, Luc Besson, George Lucas, Ale­jan­dro Jodor­owsky, and the Wachowskis: some imi­tat­ed Moe­bius, and oth­ers hired him. Through the Japan­ese edi­tion of <em>Star­log</em> mag­a­zine in the late sev­en­ties, his art re-shaped the aes­thet­ics of <em>man­ga­ka</em> like <em>Aki­ra</em> cre­ator Kat­suhi­ro Oto­mo and Stu­dio Ghi­b­li co-founder Hayao Miyaza­ki. Moe­bius him­self lat­er took on Oto­mo as one of his own influ­ences, and in trib­ute to Miyaza­ki, named his daugh­ter Nau­si­caa.

He pays spe­cial atten­tion to its chap­ter in which Sagan lays out what he calls his “baloney detec­tion kit.” This assem­bled metaphor­i­cal box of tools for diag­nos­ing fraud­u­lent argu­ments and con­struct­ing rea­soned ones involves these nine prin­ci­ples:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Wher­ev­er pos­si­ble there must be inde­pen­dent con­fir­ma­tion of the “facts.”</li>\n<li>Encour­age sub­stan­tive debate on the evi­dence by knowl­edge­able pro­po­nents of all points of view.</li>\n<li>Argu­ments from author­i­ty car­ry lit­tle weight — “author­i­ties” have made mis­takes in the past. They will do so again in the future. Per­haps a bet­ter way to say it is that in sci­ence there are no author­i­ties; at most, there are experts.</li>\n<li>Spin more than one hypoth­e­sis. If there’s some­thing to be explained, think of all the dif­fer­ent ways in which it could be explained. Then think of tests by which you might sys­tem­at­i­cal­ly dis­prove each of the alter­na­tives.</li>\n<li>Try not to get over­ly attached to a hypoth­e­sis just because it’s yours. It’s only a way sta­tion in the pur­suit of knowl­edge. Ask your­self why you like the idea. Com­pare it fair­ly with the alter­na­tives.</li>\n<li>See if you can find rea­sons for reject­ing it. If you don’t, oth­ers will.</li>\n<li>If what­ev­er it is you’re explain­ing has some mea­sure, some numer­i­cal quan­ti­ty attached to it, you’ll be much bet­ter able to dis­crim­i­nate among com­pet­ing hypothe­ses. What is vague and qual­i­ta­tive is open to many expla­na­tions.</li>\n<li>If there’s a chain of argu­ment, every link in the chain must work (includ­ing the premise) — not just most of them.</li>\n<li>Occam’s Razor. This con­ve­nient rule-of-thumb urges us when faced with two hypothe­ses that explain the data equal­ly well to choose the sim­pler. Always ask whether the hypoth­e­sis can be, at least in prin­ci­ple, fal­si­fied…. You must be able to check asser­tions out. Invet­er­ate skep­tics must be giv­en the chance to fol­low your rea­son­ing, to dupli­cate your exper­i­ments and see if they get the same result.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>As McCoy points out, these tech­niques of mind have to do with can­cel­ing out the man­i­fold bias­es present in our think­ing, those nat­ur­al human ten­den­cies that incline us to accept ideas that may or may not coin­cide with real­i­ty as it is. If we take no trou­ble to cor­rect for these bias­es, Sagan came to believe, we’ll become easy marks for all the trick­sters and char­la­tans who hap­pen to come our way. And that’s just on the micro lev­el: on the macro lev­el, vul­ner­a­bil­i­ty to delu­sion can <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.openculture.com/2025/02/carl-sagan-predicts-the-decline-of-america-unable-to-know-whats-true.html\">bring down entire civ­i­liza­tions</a>.</p>\n<p>“Like all tools, the baloney detec­tion kit can be mis­used, applied out of con­text, or even employed as a rote alter­na­tive to think­ing,” Sagan cau­tions. “But applied judi­cious­ly, it can make all the dif­fer­ence in the world — not least in eval­u­at­ing our own argu­ments before we present them to oth­ers.” McCoy urges us to heed these words, adding that “this kit is not some per­fect solu­tion to the world’s prob­lems, but as it’s been uti­lized over the last few cen­turies” — for its basic pre­cepts long pre­date Sagan’s par­tic­u­lar artic­u­la­tion — “it has enabled us to cre­ate tech­no­log­i­cal inno­va­tions and use­ful explana­to­ry mod­els of our world more quick­ly and effec­tive­ly than ever before.” The walls of baloney may always be clos­ing in on human­i­ty, but if you fol­low Sagan’s advice, you can at least give your­self some breath­ing room.</p>\n<p><strong>Relat­ed con­tent:</strong></p>\n<p><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.openculture.com/2020/12/carl-sagan-on-the-importance-of-choosing-wisely-what-you-read.html\">Carl Sagan on the Impor­tance of Choos­ing Wise­ly What You Read (Even If You Read a Book a Week)</a></p>\n<p><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.openculture.com/2018/01/carl-sagans-syllabus-final-exam-for-his-course-on-critical-thinking-cornell-1986.html\">Carl Sagan’s Syl­labus & Final Exam for His Course on Crit­i­cal Think­ing (Cor­nell, 1986)</a></p>\n<p><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.openculture.com/2025/02/carl-sagan-predicts-the-decline-of-america-unable-to-know-whats-true.html\">Carl Sagan Pre­dicts the Decline of Amer­i­ca: Unable to Know “What’s True,” We Will Slide, “With­out Notic­ing, Back into Super­sti­tion & Dark­ness” (1995)</a></p>\n<p><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.openculture.com/2024/08/richard-feynman-creates-a-simple-method-for-telling-science-from-pseudoscience.html\">Richard Feyn­man Cre­ates a Sim­ple Method for Telling Sci­ence From Pseu­do­science (1966)</a></p>\n<p><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.openculture.com/2023/07/how-to-spot-bullshit-a-manual-by-princeton-philosopher-harry-frankfurt-rip.html\">How to Spot Bull­shit: A Man­u­al by Prince­ton Philoso­pher Har­ry Frank­furt (RIP)</a></p>\n<p><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.openculture.com/critical-thinking-a-free-course\">Crit­i­cal Think­ing: A Free Course</a></p>\n<p><em>Based in Seoul, </em><em><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://blog.colinmarshall.org/\">Col­in</a></em><em><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://blog.colinmarshall.org/\"> M</a></em><em><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://blog.colinmarshall.org/\">a</a></em><em><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://blog.colinmarshall.org/\">rshall</a> writes and broad­cas</em><em>ts on cities, lan­guage, and cul­ture.

Prior to this transitional period, which archaeologists refer to as the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neolithic_Revolution\" target=\"_blank\">Neolithic Revolution</a>—the final phase of the Stone Age—small societies were organized around hunting and gathering for sustenance. During the Neolithic period, the gradual adoption of agricultural practices forever changed the way we live.</p>\n<p>Over the next few thousand years, humans began domesticating plants and practicing animal husbandry in different parts of the world. And with less time needed for farming than for nomadically searching for food, ancient people could enjoy other activities that led to economic, political, religious, and artistic developments.</p>\n<figure><img src=\"https://www.thisiscolossal.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/earthworks-3.jpg\" alt=\"people working on a grassy earthwork\" srcset=\"https://www.thisiscolossal.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/earthworks-3.jpg 2000w, https://www.thisiscolossal.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/earthworks-3-640x480.jpg 640w, https://www.thisiscolossal.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/earthworks-3-960x720.jpg 960w, https://www.thisiscolossal.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/earthworks-3-768x576.jpg 768w, https://www.thisiscolossal.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/earthworks-3-1536x1152.jpg 1536w\" /><figcaption>The excavation follows the future layout of the walking path in the park, which will lead from the visitor pavilion to the circular ditch. The excavations are based on geomagnetic ground surveys by GeoSphere Austria</figcaption></figure>\n<p>The Neolithic period saw the very <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sumer\" target=\"_blank\">first civilizations</a>. It’s also when iconically old structures like Ireland’s Newgrange passage tomb and England’s Stonehenge complex were built, the latter of which was begun around 3100 B.C.E. and finished around 600 years later. For context, when Stonehenge was in its final phase, construction of the Pyramids of Giza was likely in progress. Recently, a series of circular earthworks dating to the 5th millennium B.C.E. (5000 to 4001 B.C.E.) in Burgenland, Austria, may predate much of Stonehenge by a remarkable 2,000 years.</p>\n<p>At the newly excavated site, three monumental structures sit in close proximity to one another near the town of Rechnitz. The earthworks were initially discovered via aerial and geomagnetic surveys between 2011 and 2017. A total of four were found, three of which are ring-shaped structures that were previously invisible to the naked eye. </p>\n<p>Known as circular ditch systems, the structures were built in the Middle Neolithic period—sometime between 4850 and 4500 B.C.E.—making them at least 6,500 years old.</p>\n<p>“The Rechnitz site can be considered a supra-regional center of the Middle Neolithic period,” says Nikolaus Franz, the director of Burgenland Archaeology, in a <a href=\"https://www-burgenland-at.translate.goog/news-detail/fenster-in-die-steinzeit-grabungen-in-rechnitz-bringen-neue-erkenntnisse-ueber-die-neolithische-besiedelung-des-suedburgenlandes?_x_tr_sl=auto&_x_tr_tl=en&_x_tr_hl=en&_x_tr_pto=wapp\" target=\"_blank\">statement</a>. In the ditches measuring as much as 340 feet across, archaeologists have documented pits containing ceramic finds and post holes that indicate where timber beams in the ground once supported shelters.</p>\n<figure><img src=\"https://www.thisiscolossal.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/earthworks-4.jpg\" alt=\"a drawing and excavation of a grassy earthwork\" srcset=\"https://www.thisiscolossal.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/earthworks-4.jpg 2000w, https://www.thisiscolossal.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/earthworks-4-640x853.jpg 640w, https://www.thisiscolossal.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/earthworks-4-960x1280.jpg 960w, https://www.thisiscolossal.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/earthworks-4-768x1024.jpg 768w, https://www.thisiscolossal.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/earthworks-4-1152x1536.jpg 1152w, https://www.thisiscolossal.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/earthworks-4-1536x2048.jpg 1536w\" /></figure>\n<p>Circular ditch monuments of this type, known as <em><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neolithic_circular_enclosures_in_Central_Europe\" target=\"_blank\">Kreisgrabenanlagen</a></em> in German, are consistently found throughout Central Europe. While their intended function remains unknown, researchers generally believe they held an ancient religious, or cultic, purpose. Similar to Stonehenge, their orientation includes openings that align with the solstices and seem to correspond to an astronomical calendar.</p>\n<p>“The excavations open a veritable window into the Stone Age,” Franz says. “We are learning a great deal about the Neolithic settler clans who found this a favorable location to establish the cultural techniques of agriculture and livestock farming in what is now Burgenland…After centuries of hunting and gathering, the gradual settlement of humans was truly revolutionary.”</p>\n<p>You might also enjoy exploring the phenomenal complex of more than <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.thisiscolossal.com/2023/10/amazon-earthworks/\">10,000 earthworks</a> made by prehistoric Indigenous societies in the Amazon basin.</p>\n<figure><img src=\"https://www.thisiscolossal.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/earthworks-1.jpg\" alt=\"an aerial view of a round earthwork\" srcset=\"https://www.thisiscolossal.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/earthworks-1.jpg 2000w, https://www.thisiscolossal.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/earthworks-1-640x480.jpg 640w, https://www.thisiscolossal.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/earthworks-1-960x720.jpg 960w, https://www.thisiscolossal.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/earthworks-1-768x576.jpg 768w, https://www.thisiscolossal.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/earthworks-1-1536x1152.jpg 1536w\" /></figure>\n\t</div>\n\t</article>\n\t</section>"
