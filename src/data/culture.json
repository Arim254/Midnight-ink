    "body": "<section>\n<article>\n\t<div>\n<p>Street artists Francesco Camillo Giorgino and Julien Malland (a.k.a. <a href=\"https://www.millo.biz/\" target=\"_blank\">Millo</a> and <a href=\"https://seth.fr/en/\" target=\"_blank\">Seth Globepainter</a>) have painted in more than fifty countries combined. In a new exhibition titled <em>Beyond</em>, the pair takes their expansive mural practice indoors with thirty new works and their first collaborative canvas installation.</p>\n<p><em>Beyond</em> is grounded by a vast map at the entrance of the show, charting the far-reaching and meandering paths both artists have taken across the globe. Though they’ve crossed paths before, the exhibition emphasizes their convergence once again at Goldman Global Arts Gallery, where their monumental works have been reimagined within the context of gallery walls.</p>\n<figure><img src=\"https://www.thisiscolossal.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/millo_seth-8-960x1201.jpg\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://www.thisiscolossal.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/millo_seth-8-960x1201.jpg 960w, https://www.thisiscolossal.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/millo_seth-8-640x801.jpg 640w, https://www.thisiscolossal.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/millo_seth-8-768x961.jpg 768w, https://www.thisiscolossal.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/millo_seth-8-1227x1536.jpg 1227w, https://www.thisiscolossal.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/millo_seth-8-1636x2048.jpg 1636w, https://www.thisiscolossal.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/millo_seth-8.jpg 2000w\" /></figure>\n<p>Both Millo and Seth radiate a childlike wonder within their works, evoking a sense of joy and curiosity. While Millo’s compositions <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.thisiscolossal.com/tags/millo/\">usually feature</a> monochromatic figures and architectural components expressed with robust line work and bold pops of color, Seth’s pieces illustrate his <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.thisiscolossal.com/tags/seth-globepainter/\">signature</a> optical illusion perspectives, executed with vibrant yet soft palettes.</p>\n<p>Installed together, the works visually complement each other and amplify overlapping themes of surreal dreamscapes, everyday whimsy, and the power of imagination.</p>\n<p><em>Beyond</em> continues through November 16 in Miami.

    "body": "<section>\n<article>\n\t<div>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.jasonboydkinsella.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Jason Boyd Kinsella</a> refers to himself as “a collector of things at heart.” The manner in which the Toronto-born, Oslo-based artist (<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.thisiscolossal.com/tags/jason-boyd-kinsella/\">previously</a>) assembles shapes and colors appears to emerge from this lineage, his impeccable ability to capture a particular human emotion through abstract forms on full display.</p>\n<p><em>Alchemy of the Eternal Self </em>is Kinsella’s most recent body of work and continues his bold portraiture focused on the building blocks of our inner lives. Standing several feet tall, the geometric figures loom larger than most viewers, their bold personalities inviting an encounter.</p>\n<figure><img src=\"https://www.thisiscolossal.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/kinsella-1.jpg\" alt=\"an abstract portrait of a figure painted with chunky, colorful shapes\" srcset=\"https://www.thisiscolossal.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/kinsella-1.jpg 2000w, https://www.thisiscolossal.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/kinsella-1-640x536.jpg 640w, https://www.thisiscolossal.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/kinsella-1-960x804.jpg 960w, https://www.thisiscolossal.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/kinsella-1-768x643.jpg 768w, https://www.thisiscolossal.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/kinsella-1-1536x1286.jpg 1536w\" /><figcaption>“Luna” (2025), oil on canvas, 104 x 124 centimeters</figcaption></figure>\n<p>Kinsella zooms out in some of the pieces in the series, including “Luna” and its titular hunched character. With a sleek, white bob and perpetual frown, the figure’s long fingers reach for the ground as she turns to look out of frame. Exploring body language in addition to facial expressions, the artist also turns to art history, drawing the woman’s bent posture from Jean-François Millet’s “<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Gleaners\" target=\"_blank\">The Gleaners</a>.” The large-scale painting, completed in 1857, garnered sympathy for the lowest classes and showed their essential labor.</p>\n<p>In this way, Kinsella puzzles together both the timely and enduring, prompting connections through his Cubist paintings in which pure feeling and expression show that no matter how different we appear, we’re all made of the same emotional DNA.</p>\n<p><em>Alchemy of the Eternal Self</em> is on view through October 24 at <a href=\"https://www.perrotin.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Perrotin</a> in Shanghai.

Extracting dyes from organic sources is an art in and of itself, deeply rooted in various cultures across the historical Mesoamerican region. Although many traditional practices—like pigment harvesting—have been threatened by external factors such as colonialism, artists continue to keep these processes alive today.</p>\n<p>Mexico City-based artist <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/omr.mz\" target=\"_blank\">Omar Mendoza</a> taps into the persistence of ancestral knowledge for his newest series of paintings in <em>Serpiente Solar 〰 Noche Obsidiana</em>, or <em>Solar Serpent 〰 Obsidian Night</em>, at <a href=\"https://povoschicago.com/exhibitions/35-serpiente-solar-noche-obsidiana-solo-show-omar-mendoza-curated-by-victoria-rivers/\" target=\"_blank\">Povos</a>. Conjuring hues from native plants, tree bark, and flowers collected from his father’s hometown, supplemented with pigments sourced from local markets, the existence of Mendoza’s works are themselves a symbolic form of resistance.</p>\n<figure><img src=\"https://www.thisiscolossal.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/mendoza-3-960x640.jpg\" alt=\"detail of a natural pigment painting by Omar Mendoza, featuring cosmic symbols and visual motifs evoking Mesoamerican ancestry\" srcset=\"https://www.thisiscolossal.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/mendoza-3-960x640.jpg 960w, https://www.thisiscolossal.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/mendoza-3-640x427.jpg 640w, https://www.thisiscolossal.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/mendoza-3-768x512.jpg 768w, https://www.thisiscolossal.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/mendoza-3-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://www.thisiscolossal.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/mendoza-3.jpg 2000w\" /><figcaption>Detail of “Lluvia florida”</figcaption></figure>\n<p>Visually, the artist’s compositions evoke cosmic power and sacred rhythm. As Mendoza reaches toward the sanctity of time-honored cultural wisdom, he connects both celestial and earthly forces, depicting multitudes of intuition and insight through motifs such as stars, planetary objects, snakes, eagles, vines, and more.</p>\n<p>Victoria Rivers’ curatorial text shares:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Omar Mendoza creates these works from a cosmovision in which everything is alive and in relationship: water, stone, plants, fire, night. In that web of sacred correspondences, painting becomes an act of reciprocity with the earth and its cycles.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Symmetry flows through several of Mendoza’s paintings, calling to the mirroring of two worlds. Nonetheless, tactile washes of pink, blue, violet, and yellow atop hand-prepared canvases sumptuously intertwine, presenting a transcendent sense of harmony across Mendoza’s series of works, calling once more to the cyclical energy that courses through them.</p>\n<p><em>Serpiente Solar 〰 Noche Obsidiana</em> opens on October 4 in Chicago.

According to the museum’s announcement, the search for its next director will begin this month.</p>\n<p>Phillips told <em>Hyperallergic</em> in a statement that her departure was “not an easy decision,” but comes at a “natural transition point” following the museum’s reopening.</p>\n<p>“After much thought and consideration, I have decided that it will then be the right time for me to step down after 26 years at the helm and pass the baton to the next generation of leaders who will chart the course of this next chapter,” Phillips said.</p>\n<p>Phillips’s tenure has been marked by significant transformation and bitter labor controversy at the storied contemporary arts institution. Her leadership began in 1999 when she left her longtime curatorial role at the Whitney Museum of American Art to take the reins from the New Museum’s late founder, Marcia Tucker. Under her direction, the institution grew from an experimental arts organization with temporary locations and a staff of 25 people into a monolithic museum in the Lower East Side’s Bowery with approximately 450,000 visitors a year and a 150-person staff. Over the last two and a half decades, Phillips has overseen more than 200 exhibitions, including solo shows for <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://hyperallergic.com/322742/reflections-from-black-women-artists-for-black-lives-matter/\">Simone Leigh</a>, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.newmuseum.org/exhibition/jeffrey-gibson-the-anthropophagic-effect-2/\">Jeffrey Gibson</a>, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.newmuseum.org/exhibition/faith-ringgold-american-people/\">Faith Ringgold</a>, and <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://hyperallergic.com/825474/wangechi-mutu-corporeal-archaeology-new-museum/\">Wangechi Mutu</a>, and launched the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://hyperallergic.com/426674/new-museum-triennial-2018-songs-for-sabotage/\">New Museum Triennial</a>, dedicated to international early-career artists.</p>\n<p>Phillips’s leadership has also been marked by a series of labor controversies, particularly in recent years, as unionized staff accused management of poor working conditions, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://hyperallergic.com/581922/new-museum-faces-charges-of-unfair-labor-practices-in-a-union-complaint/\">unfair labor practices</a>, and <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://hyperallergic.com/507015/new-museum-union-rallies-against-stalled-contract-negotiations-during-summer-exhibition-openings/\">stalled contract negotiations</a>.</p>\n<p>Workers have also <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://hyperallergic.com/581180/new-museum-recalls-some-furloughed-workers-union-calls-for-greater-reform/\">scrutinized the pay disparities</a> between staff and executive leadership. (According to the museum’s 2024 tax filings, Phillips’s compensation totaled nearly $900,000.) The dispute peaked during the 2020 pandemic, when the museum <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://hyperallergic.com/574854/brooklyn-museum-new-museum-layoffs/\">laid off 18 full- and part-time staff</a>, including members of the union’s bargaining unit, citing revenue losses despite <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://hyperallergic.com/575406/nyc-art-museums-galleries-ppp-loans/\">receiving</a> a Paycheck Protection Program loan of $1–2 million. In response, the union <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://hyperallergic.com/581922/new-museum-faces-charges-of-unfair-labor-practices-in-a-union-complaint/\">filed a complaint</a> with the National Labor Relations Board alleging that the museum had deliberately targeted union supporters in its staff reductions. (The New Museum refuted the claim at the time, telling <em>Hyperallergic</em> that they “[did not] believe this charge has merit.”)</p>\n<p>In response to <em>Hyperallergic</em>’s inquiry about Phillips’s departure and the museum’s search for a new director, a spokesperson for Local 2110 UAW, which represents the New Museum Union, said that they “look forward to developing a good collective bargaining relationship with the new Museum leadership and to negotiating further improvements to the union membership’s working conditions and economic status.” </p>\n<p>The announcement of Phillips’s forthcoming departure comes amid leadership changes at major museums in the city. This month, Shamim M. Momin, co-founder of the nonprofit Los Angeles Nomadic Division (LAND), began her new post as <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://hyperallergic.com/1027302/shamim-momin-bronx-museum-new-director/\">director of the Bronx Museum</a>. Meanwhile, Christophe Cherix, the previous chief curator of drawings and prints at the Museum of Modern Art, has <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://hyperallergic.com/999529/christophe-cherix-named-moma-new-director/\">started his new role</a> as the institution’s seventh director after Glenn Lowry’s <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://hyperallergic.com/949551/moma-director-glenn-lowry-steps-down-after-30-years/\">departure</a> last year.</p>\n\t</div>\n\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://hyperallergic.com/author/maya-pontone/\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img alt=\"Avatar photo\" src=\"https://hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2024/11/cropped-IMG_8942-scaled-1.jpg\" srcset=\"https://hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2024/11/cropped-IMG_8942-scaled-1.jpg 2x\" />\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</a></p><div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMaya Pontone (she/her) is a Staff News Writer at Hyperallergic.

She didn’t end up using the interview, but decades later, the rediscovered transcript became the basis for her book <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://bookshop.org/a/539/9781639442676\"><em>Peter Hujar’s Day</em></a><em> </em>(2022). The book has now been adapted into a feature film that revives the New York arts scene of the 1970s, during which “no one was making any money,” as director Ira Sachs put it, starring Ben Whishaw as Hujar and Rebecca Hall as Rosenkrantz.<em> </em><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.filmlinc.org/nyff2025/films/peter-hujars-day/\"><em>Peter Hujar’s Day</em></a> (2025) is just one of several movies playing in this year’s <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.filmlinc.org/nyff/\">New York Film Festival</a> that tackle what it takes to live and work as an artist.</p>\n<p>The New York arts scene is a character in a much more literal way in “<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.filmlinc.org/nyff2025/films/new-york-shorts/\">Doomed and Famous</a>” (2025). The short film stars the Lower East Side’s <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://hyperallergic.com/tag/miguel-abreu-gallery/\">Miguel Abreu Gallery</a>, specifically its 2021 <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://miguelabreugallery.com/exhibitions/doomed-and-famous/\">exhibition of the same name</a>. The short is essentially a cinematic version of a walkthrough, with curator Adrian Dannatt guiding the viewer through works drawn from his collection, including those by Nan Goldin, Isamu Noguchi, Picasso, and many more. His musings blur artistic merits with personal meaning; curation becomes memoir. </p>\n<div>\n<figure><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/09/yn37C-1200x675.jpeg?resize=1200%2C675&quality=90&ssl=1\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/09/yn37C.jpeg?resize=1200%2C675&quality=90&ssl=1 1200w, https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/09/yn37C.jpeg?resize=720%2C405&quality=90&ssl=1 720w, https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/09/yn37C.jpeg?resize=768%2C432&quality=90&ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/09/yn37C.jpeg?resize=1536%2C864&quality=90&ssl=1 1536w, https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/09/yn37C.jpeg?resize=1024%2C576&quality=90&ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/09/yn37C.jpeg?resize=780%2C439&quality=90&ssl=1 780w, https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/09/yn37C.jpeg?resize=400%2C225&quality=90&ssl=1 400w, https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/09/yn37C.jpeg?resize=706%2C397&quality=90&ssl=1 706w, https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/09/yn37C.jpeg?w=1600&quality=90&ssl=1 1600w, https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/09/yn37C-1200x675.jpeg?w=370&quality=90&ssl=1 370w\" /><figcaption>Film still of “Doomed and Famous” (2025), directed by Bingham Bryant (courtesy Sequence Pictures)</figcaption></figure></div>\n<p>Every festival season sees a new rotation of biographies of artists and performers. This year’s NYFF brings us portraits of <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.filmlinc.org/nyff2025/films/deliver-me-from-nowhere/\">Bruce Springsteen</a><em>, </em>lyricist <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.filmlinc.org/nyff2025/films/blue-moon/\">Lorenz Hart</a>, and comedy duo <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.filmlinc.org/nyff2025/films/stiller-meara/\">Jerry Stiller and Anne Meara</a> (directed by Ben Stiller, their son), plus a whole miniseries about <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.filmlinc.org/nyff2025/films/mr-scorsese/\">Martin Scorsese</a> (all 2025). Of particular note is <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.filmlinc.org/nyff2025/films/nouvelle-vague/\"><em>Nouvelle Vague</em></a> (2025), a reconstruction of the making of <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://hyperallergic.com/tag/jean-luc-godard/\">Jean-Luc Godard</a>’s landmark lovers-on-the-run film <em>Breathless</em> (1960) and a tribute to the namesake French cinematic movement, featuring cameos from practically every one of its major figures. I doubt Godard would approve of such a sentimental and formally conventional tribute, but it does highlight how <em>Breathless </em>remains a marvel even after all these decades.</p>\n<p>One cinematic biography is coming to the festival by way of the archive. <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.filmlinc.org/nyff2025/films/robert-wilson-the-civil-wars/\"><em>Robert Wilson and the Civil Wars</em></a>, originally released in 1985 but long since lapsed into obscurity, has been restored through a painstaking 12-year process. The documentary shadows <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://hyperallergic.com/tag/robert-wilson/\">the late influential experimental theater director</a> during his (unfortunately doomed) quest to create a magnum opus opera to accompany the 1984 Summer Olympics, stymied by the logistical challenges of coordinating six different composers from as many countries. </p>\n<div>\n<figure><img src=\"https://hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/09/unnamed.avif\" alt=\"\" /><figcaption>Film still of <em>Robert Wilson and the Civil Wars</em> (1985), directed by Howard Brookner</figcaption></figure></div>\n<p>Other films are artistic in form rather than content. <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://hyperallergic.com/712501/life-death-and-the-cosmos-come-together-in-sharon-lockharts-art/\">Sharon Lockhart</a>’s latest, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.filmlinc.org/nyff2025/films/windward/\"><em>Windward</em></a> (2025), presents 12 extended outdoor tableaux captured around the shores of Fogo Island in Canada’s Maritimes region. The stillness of the images heightens the impact of weather events in these landscapes, as well as the movement of humans within them. James Benning, also known for his fixation on landscapes, opts for a more micro view with <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.filmlinc.org/nyff2025/films/little-boy/\"><em>Little Boy</em></a> (2025), which comprises close-ups of a variety of toys from after World War II being assembled and painted. Audio of political speeches like Eisenhower’s farewell address lends a sinister edge, implying that such mundane pleasures are secured by destructive power structures. </p>\n<p>Meanwhile, Kahlil Joseph debuts a film evolved from “BLKNWS” (2020), his installation project of the same name<em> </em><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://hyperallergic.com/540201/blknws-kahlil-joseph-sundance/\">imagining a sophisticated news channel by and for Black people</a> that illuminates the everyday racism of traditional news media. The piece enjoyed <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://hyperallergic.com/602876/kahlil-joseph-blknws-made-in-la/\">a celebrated run</a> in some unconventional spaces amid pandemic-era restrictions. In <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.filmlinc.org/nyff2025/films/blknws-terms-conditions/\"><em>BLKNWS: Terms and Conditions</em></a> (2025), Joseph expands the idea to feature length. Made in collaboration with artists including <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://hyperallergic.com/tag/arthur-jafa/\">Arthur Jafa</a> and <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://hyperallergic.com/tag/garrett-bradley/\">Garrett Bradley</a>, the “news segments” feature everything from a fictional future space voyage to retellings of the life of W.E.B. Du Bois.</p>\n<p>In many ways, it has become even more difficult for working artists in New York since Peter Hujar’s day half a century ago. Bringing things full circle within the NYFF slate, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.filmlinc.org/nyff2025/films/drunken-noodles/\"><em>Drunken Noodles</em></a><em> </em>(2025) follows the romantic travails of a modern-day young Argentinian art student who moves across continents to fulfill his big-city dreams. Perhaps at the 103rd edition of the festival in 50 years, that film will screen in the Revivals section while a new film will document what it’s like to be a New York artist in 2075, and the cycle will spin ever onward.</p>\n<div>\n<figure><img src=\"https://hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/09/Nouvelle-Vague_NYFF63_04.avif\" alt=\"\" /><figcaption>Film still of <em>Nouvelle Vague</em> (2025), directed by Richard Linklater (image courtesy Netflix)</figcaption></figure></div><div>\n<figure><img src=\"https://hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/09/BLKNWS_TERMSCONDITIONS_NYFF63_4.avif\" alt=\"\" /><figcaption>Film still of <em>BLKNWS: Terms & Conditions</em> (2025), directed by Kahlil Joseph  (courtesy Rich Spirit)</figcaption></figure></div>\n<p><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.filmlinc.org/nyff/\">The New York Film Festival</a><em> begins September 26 and continues through October 13 at various venues around New York City.</em></p>\n\t</div>\n\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://hyperallergic.com/author/dan-schindel/\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img alt=\"Avatar photo\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2022/08/Dan-smaller.jpg?fit=200%2C200&quality=100&ssl=1\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2022/08/Dan-smaller.jpg?fit=200%2C200&quality=100&ssl=1 2x\" />\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</a></p><div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tDan Schindel is a freelance writer and copy editor living in Brooklyn, and a former associate editor at Hyperallergic.

It’s one of the main challenges identified by the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.flushingtownhall.org/cultural-map-of-queens.php\">Queens Cultural Mapping Initiative</a>, a year-long research project exploring the strengths, needs, and barriers affecting the area’s arts and culture landscape. </p>\n<p>Led by the arts services team at Flushing Town Hall (FTH) in partnership with the New York State Council on the Arts (NYSCA), the initiative involved town hall meetings, a community survey, and more than 150 one-on-one interviews with individual artists and organizations across the borough — many of whom are spotlighted in a <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://flushingtownhall.github.io/QueensArtsMap/\">new borough-wide digital map</a> released last week.</p>\n<p>Created by map designers Nolen Phya and Oussama Ouadani, the platform pinpoints a plethora of multidisciplinary artist studios, galleries, community gardens, museums, and other cultural spaces, from the SculptureCenter in Long Island City to the Rockaway Artists Alliance, in an effort to foster cross-borough connections.</p>\n<p>Phya told <em>Hyperallergic</em> that his own experience growing up in the southwestern Queens neighborhood of Ozone Park had a big influence on his understanding of the borough’s transit inequities.</p>\n<p>“To even come to a place like Flushing Town Hall, there is no direct train line. You have to take multiple buses to even make it here,” Phya said. “So just thinking about that commute alone, my accessibility to the arts is quite limited.”</p>\n<div>\n<figure><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/09/queens-museum-day-of-the-dead-1200x1600.jpg?resize=1200%2C1600&quality=90&ssl=1\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/09/queens-museum-day-of-the-dead.jpg?resize=1200%2C1600&quality=90&ssl=1 1200w, https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/09/queens-museum-day-of-the-dead.jpg?resize=720%2C960&quality=90&ssl=1 720w, https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/09/queens-museum-day-of-the-dead.jpg?resize=768%2C1024&quality=90&ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/09/queens-museum-day-of-the-dead.jpg?resize=1152%2C1536&quality=90&ssl=1 1152w, https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/09/queens-museum-day-of-the-dead.jpg?resize=1536%2C2048&quality=90&ssl=1 1536w, https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/09/queens-museum-day-of-the-dead.jpg?resize=900%2C1200&quality=90&ssl=1 900w, https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/09/queens-museum-day-of-the-dead.jpg?resize=600%2C800&quality=90&ssl=1 600w, https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/09/queens-museum-day-of-the-dead.jpg?resize=450%2C600&quality=90&ssl=1 450w, https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/09/queens-museum-day-of-the-dead.jpg?resize=300%2C400&quality=90&ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/09/queens-museum-day-of-the-dead.jpg?resize=150%2C200&quality=90&ssl=1 150w, https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/09/queens-museum-day-of-the-dead.jpg?resize=780%2C1040&quality=90&ssl=1 780w, https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/09/queens-museum-day-of-the-dead.jpg?resize=400%2C533&quality=90&ssl=1 400w, https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/09/queens-museum-day-of-the-dead.jpg?resize=706%2C941&quality=90&ssl=1 706w, https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/09/queens-museum-day-of-the-dead.jpg?w=1800&quality=90&ssl=1 1800w, https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/09/queens-museum-day-of-the-dead-1200x1600.jpg?w=370&quality=90&ssl=1 370w\" /><figcaption>“Day of the Dead” altar at the Queens Museum </figcaption></figure></div>\n<p>Aside from connecting groups geographically, the map was also created in response to the need for a centralized arts and culture resource, sorely lacking since the Queens Council on the Arts took <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://hyperallergic.com/776352/queens-art-fund-2023-grants/\">a year-long hiatus to “restructure and rebuild”</a> in 2022, only to then <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://qns.com/2024/03/queens-council-on-the-arts-merging-variety-boys-girls-club-queens/?utm_source=licpost.com\">merge</a> with the Variety Boys and Girls Club of Queens in Astoria in 2024. </p>\n<p>“[It’s] left a big gap in advocacy,  strategic planning, and resource coordination, and having a unified voice,” said Natalie Bedon, the initiative’s project manager, during FTH’s monthly artist meet-up last week. </p>\n<p>“ The grants that the council previously administered are now handled by Flushing Town Hall and the New York Foundation for the Arts in Manhattan, which has also caused some confusion about where to apply,” Bedon said, emphasizing the need for dedicated hubs like the new digital map. </p>\n<p>In addition to the map, which users can add locations to using an online <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://airtable.com/apppBx0a9hj0Z1ciw/pagkf63IaBt2wJvFo/form\">application form</a>, FTH is slated to release a comprehensive report on its findings from the cultural mapping initiative next month.</p>\n<p>For the project, Bedon told <em>Hyperallergic</em> that she worked with collaborator Amara Thomas to prioritize areas that have not received the same attention for their arts and cultural offerings, unlike Long Island City and Jackson Heights, which have become hotspots for galleries and artist studios.</p>\n<p>“People often forget about places like the Rockaways and Southeast Queens, and that’s something we really wanted to bring attention to,” Bedon said. </p>\n<p>Among the map’s highlighted sites are the eco-centric art center <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://buenaondacollective.org/\">Buena Onda Collective</a> in Rockaway; the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.theworldsboroughbookshop.com/\">World’s Borough Bookshop</a> in Jackson Heights; community cultural organizations like <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.facebook.com/CentroCorona/\">Centro Corona</a> and <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.instagram.com/uncolectivorecuerda/\">Un Colectivo Recuerda</a>, which operate out of the same space in Corona; and <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.allureartacademy.com/kidsartclasses\">Allure Art Academy</a>, a new arts education hub in St. Albans founded by artist Amy Simon that is slated to open in mid-October. </p>\n<p>Simon told <em>Hyperallergic</em> that she hopes the map initiative will help expand job opportunities for artists in the borough. </p>\n<p>“I would love to see a section for people looking for work, looking for volunteer opportunities, looking for spaces,” Simon said. “It could be like an interchangeable thing where it’s not just you seeking out the venues, but venues also being able to seek out help.”</p>\n<p>Overall, Simon said she’s mostly looking forward to learning more about the work happening in her neighborhood. “I hope to just connect with artists who do different forms of art,” Simon said.</p>\n\t</div>\n\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://hyperallergic.com/author/maya-pontone/\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img alt=\"Avatar photo\" src=\"https://hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2024/11/cropped-IMG_8942-scaled-1.jpg\" srcset=\"https://hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2024/11/cropped-IMG_8942-scaled-1.jpg 2x\" />\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</a></p><div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMaya Pontone (she/her) is a Staff News Writer at Hyperallergic.
