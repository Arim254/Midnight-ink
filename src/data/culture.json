Standing several feet tall, the geometric figures loom larger than most viewers, their bold personalities inviting an encounter.</p>\n<figure><img src=\"https://www.thisiscolossal.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/kinsella-1.jpg\" alt=\"an abstract portrait of a figure painted with chunky, colorful shapes\" srcset=\"https://www.thisiscolossal.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/kinsella-1.jpg 2000w, https://www.thisiscolossal.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/kinsella-1-640x536.jpg 640w, https://www.thisiscolossal.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/kinsella-1-960x804.jpg 960w, https://www.thisiscolossal.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/kinsella-1-768x643.jpg 768w, https://www.thisiscolossal.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/kinsella-1-1536x1286.jpg 1536w\" /><figcaption>“Luna” (2025), oil on canvas, 104 x 124 centimeters</figcaption></figure>\n<p>Kinsella zooms out in some of the pieces in the series, including “Luna” and its titular hunched character. With a sleek, white bob and perpetual frown, the figure’s long fingers reach for the ground as she turns to look out of frame. Exploring body language in addition to facial expressions, the artist also turns to art history, drawing the woman’s bent posture from Jean-François Millet’s “<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Gleaners\" target=\"_blank\">The Gleaners</a>.” The large-scale painting, completed in 1857, garnered sympathy for the lowest classes and showed their essential labor.</p>\n<p>In this way, Kinsella puzzles together both the timely and enduring, prompting connections through his Cubist paintings in which pure feeling and expression show that no matter how different we appear, we’re all made of the same emotional DNA.</p>\n<p><em>Alchemy of the Eternal Self</em> is on view through October 24 at <a href=\"https://www.perrotin.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Perrotin</a> in Shanghai.

Born in India, he moved to the United States with his family when he was 13. He is acutely aware that he is neither at home nor a complete stranger to two complex cultures and histories. It is that unstable, in-between space that he continues to explore in the 13 oil paintings and one wall drawing, dating from 2022 to 2025, on view in <em><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://nathaliekarg.com/exhibitions/94-the-sleep-of-reason-sangram-majumdar/press_release_text/\">The Sleep of Reason</a></em>, at Natalie Karg Gallery. </p>\n<p>For much of his career, Majumdar, an artist I’ve long known and covered, and included in a show I curated, was an observational painter with a broad formal range, encompassing everything from highly accomplished representational paintings to abstract images grounded in direct observation. These pieces, created through layers and fragments, invited prolonged looking while resisting interpretation. Their inchoateness mirrored his inner state of vulnerability, and the desire to be seen rather than projected upon. </p>\n<div>\n<figure><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/09/Sangram-Majumdar-_monstermash-3_--1200x1435.jpg?resize=1200%2C1435&quality=90&ssl=1\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/09/Sangram-Majumdar-_monstermash-3_-.jpg?resize=1200%2C1435&quality=90&ssl=1 1200w, https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/09/Sangram-Majumdar-_monstermash-3_-.jpg?resize=720%2C861&quality=90&ssl=1 720w, https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/09/Sangram-Majumdar-_monstermash-3_-.jpg?resize=768%2C919&quality=90&ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/09/Sangram-Majumdar-_monstermash-3_-.jpg?resize=856%2C1024&quality=90&ssl=1 856w, https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/09/Sangram-Majumdar-_monstermash-3_-.jpg?resize=780%2C933&quality=90&ssl=1 780w, https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/09/Sangram-Majumdar-_monstermash-3_-.jpg?resize=400%2C478&quality=90&ssl=1 400w, https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/09/Sangram-Majumdar-_monstermash-3_-.jpg?resize=706%2C844&quality=90&ssl=1 706w, https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/09/Sangram-Majumdar-_monstermash-3_-.jpg?w=1254&quality=90&ssl=1 1254w, https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/09/Sangram-Majumdar-_monstermash-3_--1200x1435.jpg?w=370&quality=90&ssl=1 370w\" /><figcaption>Sangram Majumdar, “monstermash 4” (2025), oil on canvas</figcaption></figure></div>\n<p>Building upon the work in the 2024 show, his current pieces are a dense bricolage of diverse sources, including images derived from using strips of different colored tape to convey the awkwardness of his child learning to walk, as well as gestures found in Western art, Persian miniatures, Indian folk art, and mass media. By studying images from different cultures and epochs, he has discovered a coherence of meaning assigned to particular expressions across many cultures, and has isolated others that are specific to geographic areas and tradition, such as Hindu art. </p>\n<p>By bringing together varied full and partial images and painterly passages, Majumdar has created layered and fractured spaces in which his figures exist. Depending on what he is pursuing, his work has featured abstraction, cartoon-like imagery, figures, and decorative patterning, sometimes in a single composition. His approach seems to be driven by the desire to hold together the many different aspects of his dual Indian-American identity, along with his recognition that it is difficult to separate the personal from the political. Can he inhabit both identities? What does it mean to do so? </p>\n<div>\n<figure><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/09/Sangram-Majumdar-_the-meeting._--1200x1432.jpg?resize=1200%2C1432&quality=90&ssl=1\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/09/Sangram-Majumdar-_the-meeting._-.jpg?resize=1200%2C1432&quality=90&ssl=1 1200w, https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/09/Sangram-Majumdar-_the-meeting._-.jpg?resize=720%2C859&quality=90&ssl=1 720w, https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/09/Sangram-Majumdar-_the-meeting._-.jpg?resize=768%2C916&quality=90&ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/09/Sangram-Majumdar-_the-meeting._-.jpg?resize=858%2C1024&quality=90&ssl=1 858w, https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/09/Sangram-Majumdar-_the-meeting._-.jpg?resize=780%2C931&quality=90&ssl=1 780w, https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/09/Sangram-Majumdar-_the-meeting._-.jpg?resize=400%2C477&quality=90&ssl=1 400w, https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/09/Sangram-Majumdar-_the-meeting._-.jpg?resize=706%2C842&quality=90&ssl=1 706w, https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/09/Sangram-Majumdar-_the-meeting._-.jpg?w=1257&quality=90&ssl=1 1257w, https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/09/Sangram-Majumdar-_the-meeting._--1200x1432.jpg?w=370&quality=90&ssl=1 370w\" /><figcaption>Sangram Majumdar, “The Meeting” (2022), oil on canvas</figcaption></figure></div>\n<p>“The Meeting” (2022), which Majumdar made in response to Gustave Courbet’s “The Meeting, or Bonjour Monsieur Courbet” (1854), centers on a shirtless brown-skinned man wearing pink shorts, Majumdar’s self-portrait. Courbet’s piece depicts a chance encounter between the artist, his dog, Breton, his servant, Calas, and his friend and most important patron, Alfred Bruyas. Until Courbet’s innovative work, group portraits in the European tradition were largely composed of figures posing in a room. Nothing was spontaneous or improvised. When I first saw Majumdar’s painting in 2023, I interpreted it solely through the lens of the 1854 painting. I later realized that my reading was too narrow and that it has little to do with patronage, which was Courbet’s subject. </p>\n<p>In “The Meeting,” Majumdar’s left hand extends forward from his chest, about heart height, greeted by an abstract, semi-transparent yellow shape that I saw as a gloved hand. Is it coming from a composite figure that we cannot identify? The artist, seen in profile, directs his gaze toward an unknowable space between the viewer and the compounded, abstract figure. Stuck between two disparate cultures, he does not know what to look at or take in; his mouth is open, bewildered. </p>\n<div>\n<figure><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/09/Sangram-Majumdar-the-collaborators-I_.jpg?resize=1000%2C1512&quality=90&ssl=1\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/09/Sangram-Majumdar-the-collaborators-I_.jpg?w=1000&quality=90&ssl=1 1000w, https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/09/Sangram-Majumdar-the-collaborators-I_.jpg?resize=720%2C1089&quality=90&ssl=1 720w, https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/09/Sangram-Majumdar-the-collaborators-I_.jpg?resize=768%2C1161&quality=90&ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/09/Sangram-Majumdar-the-collaborators-I_.jpg?resize=677%2C1024&quality=90&ssl=1 677w, https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/09/Sangram-Majumdar-the-collaborators-I_.jpg?resize=780%2C1179&quality=90&ssl=1 780w, https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/09/Sangram-Majumdar-the-collaborators-I_.jpg?resize=400%2C605&quality=90&ssl=1 400w, https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/09/Sangram-Majumdar-the-collaborators-I_.jpg?resize=706%2C1067&quality=90&ssl=1 706w, https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/09/Sangram-Majumdar-the-collaborators-I_.jpg?w=370&quality=90&ssl=1 370w\" /><figcaption>Sangram Majumdar, “Collaborators I” (2025), oil on canvas</figcaption></figure></div>\n<p>Majumdar wants viewers to feel some of his conflicted position in ways that seem fresh. In “Collaborators I” (2025), he depicts a woman in a jungle-like setting, among tropical leaves. She wears what looks like a gray skirt that reaches to the painting’s bottom edge and a flowery pink and violet blouse. Is she standing or kneeling. What does the upward gesture of arms and hands signify?  </p>\n<p>What I find most engrossing about the work is that the woman’s head is all black, and Majumdar has painted a small blue dot near the center of it. Is her face turned away from us, revealing her dark hair? Or is she always hidden to us? The issue of visibility, and what it means, becomes the painting’s subject. Similarly mysterious are several pairs of disembodied eyes peering out at us in “Voice Over” (2025). Are they benign or dangerous? Seemingly aimed in all directions, at what are they actually looking?

Maritime narratives of ancestral and descendant voices are at the core of the curatorial team’s interpretation of the visual and material culture on display. </p>\n<div>\n<figure><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/09/pJaw3-1200x747.jpeg?resize=1200%2C747&quality=90&ssl=1\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/09/pJaw3.jpeg?resize=1200%2C747&quality=90&ssl=1 1200w, https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/09/pJaw3.jpeg?resize=720%2C448&quality=90&ssl=1 720w, https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/09/pJaw3.jpeg?resize=768%2C478&quality=90&ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/09/pJaw3.jpeg?resize=1536%2C956&quality=90&ssl=1 1536w, https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/09/pJaw3.jpeg?resize=2048%2C1274&quality=90&ssl=1 2048w, https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/09/pJaw3.jpeg?resize=1024%2C637&quality=90&ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/09/pJaw3.jpeg?resize=2000%2C1244&quality=90&ssl=1 2000w, https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/09/pJaw3.jpeg?resize=780%2C485&quality=90&ssl=1 780w, https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/09/pJaw3.jpeg?resize=400%2C249&quality=90&ssl=1 400w, https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/09/pJaw3.jpeg?resize=706%2C439&quality=90&ssl=1 706w, https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/09/pJaw3-1200x747.jpeg?w=370&quality=90&ssl=1 370w\" /><figcaption>Installation view of <em>Entwined: Freedom, Sovereignty, and the Sea</em> (photo by Joe Michael, courtesy Mystic Seaport Museum)</figcaption></figure></div>\n<p>At the center of the first gallery is “Mishoon/Aklo” (2023), a stunning canoe created as a collaboration between four artists: Sika Foyer (Togo), Alvin Ashiatey (Ghana), Hartman Deetz (Mashpee Wampanoag), and Gary Carter Jr (Mashantucket Pequot). Carved from tree trunks with fire and water, “dugout” canoes are a shared tradition from Pequot territories to African shores, where they are used to navigate rivers and oceans, sustaining communities through fishing and maintaining connections. Nearby is the oldest object on view, an Aboriginal cooking pot from 500 BCE made from shell-tempering technology utilized in global Indigenous and African ceramics, another example of ancestral science that sustains everyday life.</p>\n<p>After walking through two galleries of maritime material culture made by skilled Black and Indigenous craftspeople, visitors arrive at an unlikely space evoking historic domestic dwellings. The external structure is modeled after a traditional Wampanoag<em> wetu</em>, a dome-shaped home made from local materials like cedar saplings. Though it is presented here at ground level, the interior of the wetu is designed to look and feel like the attic of a colonial-era New England home, where enslaved Africans and Indigenous indentured workers were often forced to live. The dimly lit display evokes the captivity and loneliness of the attic, while the fragmented pieces of a sacred historic bundle on display allude to the space as a site for privacy and spiritual practice. The “Nkisi Bundle” (18th century) is a spirited assemblage of cowrie shells, beads, buttons, fabric scraps, and other objects utilized as a vessel to connect Africans to their ancestors. The likely owner, enslaved man Cardardo Wanton, would have prayed with his <em>nkisi</em> bundle in private to protect him, hiding it underneath an attic floorboard in the meantime. <em>Minkisi</em>, the plural of nkisi<em>, </em>are vessels instilled with energy and ancestral spirit in West and Central African traditions. As sacred assemblages, they promote spiritual harmony on the African continent and in diasporic rituals. </p>\n<figure><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/09/alylm-1200x746.jpeg?resize=1200%2C746&quality=90&ssl=1\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/09/alylm.jpeg?resize=1200%2C746&quality=90&ssl=1 1200w, https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/09/alylm.jpeg?resize=720%2C447&quality=90&ssl=1 720w, https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/09/alylm.jpeg?resize=768%2C477&quality=90&ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/09/alylm.jpeg?resize=1536%2C954&quality=90&ssl=1 1536w, https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/09/alylm.jpeg?resize=2048%2C1272&quality=90&ssl=1 2048w, https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/09/alylm.jpeg?resize=1024%2C636&quality=90&ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/09/alylm.jpeg?resize=2000%2C1243&quality=90&ssl=1 2000w, https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/09/alylm.jpeg?resize=780%2C485&quality=90&ssl=1 780w, https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/09/alylm.jpeg?resize=400%2C249&quality=90&ssl=1 400w, https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/09/alylm.jpeg?resize=706%2C439&quality=90&ssl=1 706w, https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/09/alylm-1200x746.jpeg?w=370&quality=90&ssl=1 370w\" /><figcaption>Installation view of <em>Entwined: Freedom, Sovereignty, and the Sea</em> (photo by Joe Michael, courtesy Mystic Seaport Museum)</figcaption></figure>\n<p>Leaving the intimacy of the provisional attic, the gallery opens up to a wide display of contemporary art. The Indigenous fashion on view is resplendent: “The Rainbow Regalia” (2016) of Sherenté Mishitashin Harris (Narragansett), Two-Spirit activist and champion powwow dancer, is colorful and vibrant, with intricate beadwork, shimmering fringe, and designs that honor the Fancy Shawl tradition. Nearby, “Maushop’s Earrings” and “Squant’s Gorget Necklace” were created from Quahog shells in 2023 by Elizabeth James-Perry (Aquinnah Wampanoag) as a delightful ode to Maushop and Squant, the powerful duo in Wampanoag folklore known for shaping the coastline and protecting their people. James-Perry’s “Constellation Wampum Belt” (2023) is made from shells woven into the shape of the Bear constellation, symbolizing the connection between the earth and the sky. It sits at the contemporary end of a millennia-old tradition in which coastal Indigenous communities in New England and elsewhere in the North create purple and white beaded bodily adornments from Quahog shells. </p>\n<p>Other contemporary beaded and woven works celebrate the beauty and resilience of Black and Indigenous lifeways. Felandus Thames’s “Wail on Whalers, a Portrait of Amos Haskins” (2024) is a stunning beaded portrait honoring fugitive slaves who joined the whaling industry. In the 19th century, Amos Haskins (Wampanoag Tribe of Gay Head) achieved captain status in the whaling industry, where he worked with a diverse crowd of sailors, including escaped enslaved people and other people of color. He married an African-American woman, Elizabeth P. Farmer, in 1844 and raised mixed-race children with her. Tragically, he was lost at sea in 1861, but his legacy lives on as an example of the 19th-century whaling industry, where Black and Indigenous peoples found kinship and financial autonomy. Adjacent is Nafis M. White’s “TideLine” (2023–24), a wall sculpture made from colorful hair woven into different forms, such as braids, twists, and knots that cascade and coil across the work like tidal currents. The work’s medium line includes “hair, embodied knowledge, ancestral recall, audacity of survival, Swarovski crystals, the artist’s sequined gowns, hair baubles, gold gilded oyster shells, bobby pins” — a delightful framing of her artistic practice that mirrors the themes of the exhibition, as hair is an ancestral, sacred, creative process in both Black and Indigenous communities. </p>\n<p><em>Entwined </em>takes us in countless directions across hundreds of years of Black-Indigenous survival under colonialism and slavery. We witness the visual and material culture through which Africans, Natives, and their descendants adorn themselves and express their cultural traditions, feed their bodies and spirits, and thrive. That this exhibition takes place in Connecticut and centers Dawnland (New England) narratives is incredibly special. The state likely conjures images of White, wealthy businessmen who work on Wall Street and live in suburban Southern Connecticut mansions. <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.ctinsider.com/news/education/article/uconn-native-american-history-morill-acts-19831265.php?utm_source=chatgpt.com\">Indigeneity has often been rendered invisible in Connecticut,</a> even as the state hosts the world’s largest museum of Native American history and culture, the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.pequotmuseum.org/\">Mashantucket Pequot Museum and Research Center, </a>less than a 30-minute drive from the Mystic Seaport Museum and from which several works were loaned. <em>Entwined </em>is a profound statement: Black and Indigenous histories matter here, too. Globally and locally, their traditions are sacred, everlasting, and entwined. </p>\n<div>\n<figure><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/09/J90XU-1200x957.jpeg?resize=1200%2C957&quality=90&ssl=1\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/09/J90XU.jpeg?resize=1200%2C957&quality=90&ssl=1 1200w, https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/09/J90XU.jpeg?resize=720%2C574&quality=90&ssl=1 720w, https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/09/J90XU.jpeg?resize=768%2C612&quality=90&ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/09/J90XU.jpeg?resize=1536%2C1224&quality=90&ssl=1 1536w, https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/09/J90XU.jpeg?resize=2048%2C1632&quality=90&ssl=1 2048w, https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/09/J90XU.jpeg?resize=1024%2C816&quality=90&ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/09/J90XU.jpeg?resize=2000%2C1594&quality=90&ssl=1 2000w, https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/09/J90XU.jpeg?resize=780%2C622&quality=90&ssl=1 780w, https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/09/J90XU.jpeg?resize=400%2C319&quality=90&ssl=1 400w, https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/09/J90XU.jpeg?resize=706%2C563&quality=90&ssl=1 706w, https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/09/J90XU-1200x957.jpeg?w=370&quality=90&ssl=1 370w\" /><figcaption>Unrecorded maker, Aboriginal cooking pot (c. 500 BCE) (photo Alexandra M.

    "body": "<div>\n<p>SÃO PAULO — At the pre-opening of the 36th São Paulo Biennial on September 5, a spiritual procession filled the austere Cecilio Matarazzo Pavilion in Parque Ibirapuera with rousing drums and smoke. With the festivities of poetry readings and live performances continuing over opening weekend, it was almost enough to forget that not far off, on Avenida Paulista, another large crowd was gathering to cheer on Brazil’s ex-president Jair Bolsonaro, whose ultra-right-wing populism is embraced by millions despite <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/sep/02/jair-bolsonaro-faces-justice-over-alleged-attempt-to-usurp-brazilian-democracy\">strong evidence that he undermined Brazil’s democratic elections</a>.</p>\n<p>The biennial itself was shadowed by the <em>bolsonarista</em> rally, despite featuring few politically incisive works. As its chief curator, Bonaventure Soh Bejeng Ndikung, said at the press conference, this year’s edition sought to address “the acceleration of dehumanization worldwide, from Gaza to Goma, from Kashmir to Khartoum,” fueled by “the belief that to make peace we must make war,” through quieter means than direct protest. Indeed, its title is inspired by a line in Conceição Evaristo’s poem “Da calma e do silêncio” (Of calm and silence, 1990): “there are submerged worlds that only the silence of poetry penetrates.” Taking this cue, the biennial features a number of outstanding works that illustrate the ways in which the senses (attentive listening, in particular) can deepen a sense of fraternity and mutual care. This attentiveness to undersung currents also extends to its forefronting of African and Black Brazilian artists and employs an elliptical exhibition model inspired by estuaries, where rivers feed into oceans. Even as it privileges quiet and reflective engagement, however, the biennial cannot fully contain the frictions and instabilities that surround and infuse it.</p>\n<div>\n<figure><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/09/Raven-Chacon-Iggor-Cavalera-Laima-Leyton-in-collaboration-with-members-of-the-Etenhiritipa-Xavante-community-2021-photo-Ela-Bittencourt-Hyperallergic-1200x856.jpg?resize=1200%2C856&quality=90&ssl=1\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/09/Raven-Chacon-Iggor-Cavalera-Laima-Leyton-in-collaboration-with-members-of-the-Etenhiritipa-Xavante-community-2021-photo-Ela-Bittencourt-Hyperallergic.jpg?resize=1200%2C856&quality=90&ssl=1 1200w, https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/09/Raven-Chacon-Iggor-Cavalera-Laima-Leyton-in-collaboration-with-members-of-the-Etenhiritipa-Xavante-community-2021-photo-Ela-Bittencourt-Hyperallergic.jpg?resize=720%2C514&quality=90&ssl=1 720w, https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/09/Raven-Chacon-Iggor-Cavalera-Laima-Leyton-in-collaboration-with-members-of-the-Etenhiritipa-Xavante-community-2021-photo-Ela-Bittencourt-Hyperallergic.jpg?resize=768%2C548&quality=90&ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/09/Raven-Chacon-Iggor-Cavalera-Laima-Leyton-in-collaboration-with-members-of-the-Etenhiritipa-Xavante-community-2021-photo-Ela-Bittencourt-Hyperallergic.jpg?resize=1536%2C1096&quality=90&ssl=1 1536w, https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/09/Raven-Chacon-Iggor-Cavalera-Laima-Leyton-in-collaboration-with-members-of-the-Etenhiritipa-Xavante-community-2021-photo-Ela-Bittencourt-Hyperallergic.jpg?resize=2048%2C1461&quality=90&ssl=1 2048w, https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/09/Raven-Chacon-Iggor-Cavalera-Laima-Leyton-in-collaboration-with-members-of-the-Etenhiritipa-Xavante-community-2021-photo-Ela-Bittencourt-Hyperallergic.jpg?resize=1024%2C730&quality=90&ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/09/Raven-Chacon-Iggor-Cavalera-Laima-Leyton-in-collaboration-with-members-of-the-Etenhiritipa-Xavante-community-2021-photo-Ela-Bittencourt-Hyperallergic.jpg?resize=2000%2C1427&quality=90&ssl=1 2000w, https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/09/Raven-Chacon-Iggor-Cavalera-Laima-Leyton-in-collaboration-with-members-of-the-Etenhiritipa-Xavante-community-2021-photo-Ela-Bittencourt-Hyperallergic.jpg?resize=780%2C556&quality=90&ssl=1 780w, https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/09/Raven-Chacon-Iggor-Cavalera-Laima-Leyton-in-collaboration-with-members-of-the-Etenhiritipa-Xavante-community-2021-photo-Ela-Bittencourt-Hyperallergic.jpg?resize=400%2C285&quality=90&ssl=1 400w, https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/09/Raven-Chacon-Iggor-Cavalera-Laima-Leyton-in-collaboration-with-members-of-the-Etenhiritipa-Xavante-community-2021-photo-Ela-Bittencourt-Hyperallergic.jpg?resize=706%2C504&quality=90&ssl=1 706w, https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/09/Raven-Chacon-Iggor-Cavalera-Laima-Leyton-in-collaboration-with-members-of-the-Etenhiritipa-Xavante-community-2021-photo-Ela-Bittencourt-Hyperallergic-1200x856.jpg?w=370&quality=90&ssl=1 370w\" /><figcaption>Raven Chacon, Iggor Cavalera & Laima Leyton, in collaboration with members of the Etenhiritipa Xavante community, “Voiceless Mass”(2021)</figcaption></figure></div>\n<p>The spare yet piercing vocal performance, “Nothing Will Remain Other Than the Thorn Lodged in the Throat of this World”<em> </em>(2025)<em> </em>by Palestinian artist Noor Abed and Lebanese artist Haig Aivazian, performed in the auditorium, set the expectation of careful listening. Reproducing everything from a bullet’s whizz to a cat’s purring — an animal method to heal pain, the artists said — the piece sees the pair singing, clapping, and syncopating back and forth to recreate a sonic landscape of war, experienced from the civilian perspective. At one point, they say to each other, “Are you okay?” “I’m okay, are you okay?” “But are you really okay?” This stuttered refrain of solidarity is whittled down to a few solicitous notes, yet effectively conveys the sense that truly listening means synchronizing one’s body with another’s. It suggested to me that the healing power of the human voice lies not just in the meaning of the words but in its resonant vibration, like the cat’s purr. </p>\n<p>By highlighting African and Black Brazilian artists, Ndikung and co-curators Alya Sebti, Anna Roberta Goetz, Thiago de Paula Souza, and Keyna Elaison continued the trajectories of two previous São Paulo biennials, which centered trans-Atlantic affinities. This year, the abstract paintings of British-Guyanese artist Frank Bowling, spread over different sections, embodied the idea of South American art as born from a complex negotiation between African and European cultures. Bowling’s painting series <em>South America </em>(c. 1960s), one of which can be seen on the ground floor of the exhibition, depicts a borderless continent in a sea of monochromatic color in a pulsating example of the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.oxfordbibliographies.com/display/document/obo-9780199913701/obo-9780199913701-0064.xml\">pan-Latin-American movement</a>, which gained particular urgency in the ’70s as artists fled local dictatorships and built networks elsewhere. In highlighting this series, the biennial seems to desire to reclaim such supra-cultural interconnections as a way to guard against growing divides. Yet to me, this legacy seems more a part of the long-foreclosed dream of a Marxist solidarity that supersedes race, nation, or class, one even more distant than the dissolution of national borders.</p>\n<figure><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/09/Leiko-Ikemura-1200x717.jpg?resize=1200%2C717&quality=90&ssl=1\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/09/Leiko-Ikemura.jpg?resize=1200%2C717&quality=90&ssl=1 1200w, https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/09/Leiko-Ikemura.jpg?resize=720%2C430&quality=90&ssl=1 720w, https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/09/Leiko-Ikemura.jpg?resize=768%2C459&quality=90&ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/09/Leiko-Ikemura.jpg?resize=1536%2C918&quality=90&ssl=1 1536w, https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/09/Leiko-Ikemura.jpg?resize=2048%2C1224&quality=90&ssl=1 2048w, https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/09/Leiko-Ikemura.jpg?resize=1024%2C612&quality=90&ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/09/Leiko-Ikemura.jpg?resize=2000%2C1195&quality=90&ssl=1 2000w, https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/09/Leiko-Ikemura.jpg?resize=780%2C466&quality=90&ssl=1 780w, https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/09/Leiko-Ikemura.jpg?resize=400%2C239&quality=90&ssl=1 400w, https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/09/Leiko-Ikemura.jpg?resize=706%2C422&quality=90&ssl=1 706w, https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/09/Leiko-Ikemura-1200x717.jpg?w=370&quality=90&ssl=1 370w\" /><figcaption>Installation of works by Leiko Ikemura</figcaption></figure>\n<p>One of the biennial’s (numerous) metaphors is that of the coastal estuary, where rivers meet ocean. These are embodied by works exploring ecological devastation, such as Forensic Architecture’s “Delta-Delta: People’s Court”<em> </em>(2025), featuring first-person accounts of mass pollution caused by Shell’s extracting oil in Nigeria, or Wolfgang Tillmans’s photographs of rivers, including the Amazon. Others center ecological grief, as in Emeka Ogboh’s sound-olfactory installation, “The Way the Earthly Things Are Going” (2025), featuring smoky odors, a choir, and cut-down tree-trunks; or hidden currents of culture, history, heritage, as in Suchitra Mattai’s “Siren Song” (2022), for which she embroidered vintage saris. Even Berenice Olmedo’s “Pnoê”<em> </em>(Breathing, 2025), comprising obsolete medical equipment, featured bulky glass torsos that looked as if filled with fluid in certain light. In a work centering disability and medical trauma, such an optical illusion underscored the shared vulnerability of all human bodies.</p>\n<p>Estuaries also inspired this biennial’s meandering exhibition design, with flowy curtains bringing out the curves of the pavilion’s monumental staircase. I couldn’t help noticing how often visitors were encouraged to wind, loop, and retrace their steps, enacting their own riverine peregrinations. From Precious Okoyomon’s “Sun of Consciousness. God Blow Thru Me” (2025), a garden installed at the ground-floor entrance whose sinuous paths are built from Northeastern Brazil’s desert dirt and plants, to Maria Magdalena Campos-Pons’s “Macuto” (2025), in which gauzy, sinewy curtains enfold a flower-statue, this biennial encouraged viewers to flow, suggesting many entry points, and multiple connections between works. One could walk from Okoyomon’s garden into Nádia Taquary’s magical one, or step inside the Certão Negro (Black Backwoods) archival section, providing context for historical Afro-Brazilian communities that also inspired Taquary. </p>\n<figure><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/09/Sao-Paulo-Biennia-Exhibition-View-with-Tanka-Fonta-22Philosophies-of-Being-Perception-and-Expressivity-of-Being22-2025-photo-Ela-Bittencourt-Hyperallergic-1200x821.jpg?resize=1200%2C821&quality=90&ssl=1\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/09/Sao-Paulo-Biennia-Exhibition-View-with-Tanka-Fonta-22Philosophies-of-Being-Perception-and-Expressivity-of-Being22-2025-photo-Ela-Bittencourt-Hyperallergic.jpg?resize=1200%2C821&quality=90&ssl=1 1200w, https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/09/Sao-Paulo-Biennia-Exhibition-View-with-Tanka-Fonta-22Philosophies-of-Being-Perception-and-Expressivity-of-Being22-2025-photo-Ela-Bittencourt-Hyperallergic.jpg?resize=720%2C493&quality=90&ssl=1 720w, https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/09/Sao-Paulo-Biennia-Exhibition-View-with-Tanka-Fonta-22Philosophies-of-Being-Perception-and-Expressivity-of-Being22-2025-photo-Ela-Bittencourt-Hyperallergic.jpg?resize=768%2C525&quality=90&ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/09/Sao-Paulo-Biennia-Exhibition-View-with-Tanka-Fonta-22Philosophies-of-Being-Perception-and-Expressivity-of-Being22-2025-photo-Ela-Bittencourt-Hyperallergic.jpg?resize=1536%2C1051&quality=90&ssl=1 1536w, https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/09/Sao-Paulo-Biennia-Exhibition-View-with-Tanka-Fonta-22Philosophies-of-Being-Perception-and-Expressivity-of-Being22-2025-photo-Ela-Bittencourt-Hyperallergic.jpg?resize=2048%2C1401&quality=90&ssl=1 2048w, https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/09/Sao-Paulo-Biennia-Exhibition-View-with-Tanka-Fonta-22Philosophies-of-Being-Perception-and-Expressivity-of-Being22-2025-photo-Ela-Bittencourt-Hyperallergic.jpg?resize=1024%2C701&quality=90&ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/09/Sao-Paulo-Biennia-Exhibition-View-with-Tanka-Fonta-22Philosophies-of-Being-Perception-and-Expressivity-of-Being22-2025-photo-Ela-Bittencourt-Hyperallergic.jpg?resize=2000%2C1368&quality=90&ssl=1 2000w, https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/09/Sao-Paulo-Biennia-Exhibition-View-with-Tanka-Fonta-22Philosophies-of-Being-Perception-and-Expressivity-of-Being22-2025-photo-Ela-Bittencourt-Hyperallergic.jpg?resize=780%2C534&quality=90&ssl=1 780w, https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/09/Sao-Paulo-Biennia-Exhibition-View-with-Tanka-Fonta-22Philosophies-of-Being-Perception-and-Expressivity-of-Being22-2025-photo-Ela-Bittencourt-Hyperallergic.jpg?resize=400%2C274&quality=90&ssl=1 400w, https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/09/Sao-Paulo-Biennia-Exhibition-View-with-Tanka-Fonta-22Philosophies-of-Being-Perception-and-Expressivity-of-Being22-2025-photo-Ela-Bittencourt-Hyperallergic.jpg?resize=706%2C483&quality=90&ssl=1 706w, https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/09/Sao-Paulo-Biennia-Exhibition-View-with-Tanka-Fonta-22Philosophies-of-Being-Perception-and-Expressivity-of-Being22-2025-photo-Ela-Bittencourt-Hyperallergic-1200x821.jpg?w=370&quality=90&ssl=1 370w\" /><figcaption>Installation view of <em>36th Bienal de São Paulo – Not All Travellers Walk Roads</em></figcaption></figure>\n<p>Not all digressions proved equally productive. In a manner reminiscent of Ndikung’s curatorial practice at Berlin’s Haus der Kulturen der Welt, visitors were offered little guidance. Labels were scattershot, some placed far from the works. The six sections titles, with bloated, portentous names like “Currents of Nurturing and Plural Cosmologies,” “Cadences of Transformation,” and “The Intractable Beauty of the World,” were listed on columns also peppered with artists’ biographies. The torrent-like texts made it hard to identify pieces, or make sense of them — an oddly lackadaisical approach that often obscured rather than clarified the team’s preparatory research. While visitors desperately searched for (not very clear) maps, some visiting curators griped about the poor display of works they loved. </p>\n<p>Some pieces, such as Laure Prouvost’s “Flow, Flower: Bloom!”<em> </em>(2025), a mobile textile sculpture draped as if a bud opening above visitors’ heads, felt like sensuous, ornate distractions. Still others — particularly sonic works, of which there were over 20 — might only shine (or hum) once the crowds have waned. In the end, some art getting lost in the flotsam underscored the spectacular reality of biennials, in which dozens of works vie for attention, and curatorial fanfare can supplant the voice of the artist. </p>\n<p>To escape the biennial Babel, I attended a live offsite performance at Casa do Povo (House of the People) — though ironically, Marcelo Evelin’s choreographic piece, “Batucada”<em> </em>(2014/25) actually involved tremendous noise, with dancers banging on metal lids and other objects while gradually stripping, sometimes huddling down, dispersing, or charging the crowd, grinding elbows and butts. Yet the cacophony didn’t feel like a diversion here, but rather a provocation: Sweaty bodies swaying dangerously between chaotic ecstasy and anarchic rage. Walking out of the theater, I was reminded of co-curator Elaison’s comment at the press conference that “improvisation can be a technology of resistance.” Indeed, “Batucada” felt like a rehearsal for rebellion — one in which not only one’s hearing but the whole body, the whole collective body, is engaged. The biennial might lean into the quiet, but I was reminded that that could be the calm before a storm. </p>\n<div>\n<figure><img

    "body": "<div><p>\n\tAt the upcoming editions of Frieze London and <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.artnews.com/t/frieze-masters/\">Frieze Masters</a>, a group of galleries will donate 10 percent of the sale price of certain artworks to benefit the London-based nonprofit <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.artnews.com/t/gallery-climate-coalition/\">Gallery Climate Coalition</a> (GCC).</p>\n<p>\n\tBilled as a “fundraising and visibility initiative” for GCC, the project, called 10% Of, will involve 22 blue-chip galleries participating in either of the fairs, or around 8 percent of the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.artnews.com/art-news/market/frieze-london-frieze-masters-2025-exhibitor-lists-1234744374/\">more than 280 exhibitors</a> at both fairs. (All the participating galleries were invited to join.)</p>\n<p>\n\tGagosian, Hauser & Wirth, Thaddaeus Ropac, Lisson Gallery, Sprüth Magers, Thomas Dane Gallery, Sadie Coles HQ, Victoria Miro, and Hollybush Gardens are among those that have committed to the project.\n\t</p>\n<section>\n\t<h2 id=\"section-heading\">\n\t\tRelated Articles\n\t</h2>\n</section>\n<p>\n\tGCC, whose main aim is to reduce carbon emissions within the art world by 50 percent by 2030, approached Frieze earlier this year with the idea of the initiative, in part to celebrate its fifth anniversary of a group of galleries coming together to combat climate change and address it in the art world.</p>\n<p>\n\t“We saw an opportunity to combine those ideas into a new model of climate-focused giving that could feel both natural to the market and powerful in its impact,” GCC director Heath Lowndes told <em>ARTnews</em> in an emailed interview.</p>\n<p>\n\tEach participating gallery has selected at least one work from their booth at the upcoming fairs to be part of 10% Of, committing to donate 10 percent of the sale price to GCC. While that figure might seem relatively small, Lowndes said that GCC is of the belief that “small actions taken together generate more meaningful impact.”</p>\n<p>\n\tThose works will be viewable ahead of the fair in a dedicated online viewing room that will go live on October 4. As of now, GCC has revealed one work that will be included in the project, <em>Eis </em>(2025) by Thomas Demand, who shows with Sprüth Magers.</p>\n<p>\n\t10% Of takes its name from the discount that galleries often offer to some of their most important collectors, as well as a comment that artist Gary Hume told dealer Thomas Dane for a <a href=\"https://news.artnet.com/art-world/galleries-sustainability-goals-1936766\" target=\"_blank\">2021 op-ed</a> detailing the goals of GCC. “I can’t claim to be an environmental activist, I’m more like a ten percent activist. But I think there are lots of us who are ten percent activists, and if you put a lot of ten percent together, it begins to add up,” Hume said at the time.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tBecause art fairs often have some of the largest carbon footprints within the art world, with works shipped in from international locales and dealers, collectors, curators, and artists traveling in from everywhere, Lowndes said that “partnering with them is essential for creating meaningful change.… When you consider the additional impacts from air travel, venue energy consumption, and single-use waste, the rationale for engagement becomes clear.”</p>\n<p>\n\tIn a statement, Romilly Stebbings, Frieze’s director of business development, said, “Frieze is proud to support GCC as they mark their fifth anniversary with the new ‘10% Of’ initiative. By raising funds and amplifying conversations around climate action, their work continues to challenge the art world to imagine and pursue a more environmentally responsible future—an imperative that feels even more pressing today than when they began.”</p>\n<p>\n\tLowndes pointed to data collected from its membership in which about one-third of a gallery’s annual carbon emissions can be attributed to their participation in art fairs, “with air freight alone making up an estimated 70% of that figure.”</p>\n<p>\n\tHe added, “‘10% Of’ is a major show of support for this aim, recognizing that art fairs, with their centralized format, are key players who can enable the effective, coordinated action needed for measurable decarbonization across the arts.”</p>\n<p>\n\tGCC has partnered with fairs before, including Frieze London, Art Basel, and MiArt in Milan, to have booths at the fairs to maintain visibility, but Lowndes said that those past experiences “highlighted the operational hurdles for a small charity dealing with logistics, shipping, and installation. ‘10% Of’ was conceived as a simpler, more scalable way for GCC to be visible and raise funds at fairs, one that could draw strength from collaboration rather than infrastructure.”</p>\n<p>\n\tThe funds will help support GCC’s work, which has included organizing a Climate Conversations Conference with the Helen Frankenthaler Foundation and Teiger Foundation at the Museum of Modern Art in New York this past May. GCC also launched the Artist Toolkit for Environmental Responsibility, which provides artists with guidelines about how to reduce the environmental impact of their respective practices.</p>\n<p>\n\tAdditionally, GCC made the Art Fair Alliance, through which 13 art fairs have committed to reducing their collective emissions. In November, during the U.N.’s COP30, it will host Art+Climate Week in London and publish the <em>GCC Stocktake Report</em>, which Lowndes said is “the first comprehensive review of climate progress in the visual arts, benchmarking achievements, exposing gaps, and setting out a roadmap for the decisive years ahead.”</p>\n<p>\n\t“At the heart of all this work,” Lowndes said, “is the same ambition: to provide the visual arts with the tools, frameworks, and cultural momentum needed to reduce environmental impacts in line with climate science.”</p>\n<div><p>\n\tThe full list of galleries participating in 10% Of follows below.</p><p>Axel Vervoordt <br />Edel Assanti <br />Frith Street Gallery <br />Gagosian <br />Hauser & Wirth <br />Hollybush Gardens <br />Kate MacGarry <br />Lisson Gallery <br />Pippy Houldsworth Gallery <br />Sadie Coles HQ <br />Soft Opening <br />Sprüth Magers <br />Thaddaeus Ropac <br />Thomas Dane Gallery <br />Victoria Miro <br />D’LAN CONTEMPORARY <br />October Gallery <br />Peter Blum Gallery <br />Berry Campbell <br />Maisterravalbuena <br />BASTIAN <br />Pedro Cera</p></div>\n</div>"
