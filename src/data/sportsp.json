    "body": "<div>\n        <p>The <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/wnba/teams/IND/indiana-fever/\">Indiana Fever's</a> Cinderella run in the WNBA playoffs came to an end at the hands of the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/wnba/teams/LVA/las-vegas-aces/\">Las Vegas Aces</a> with a 107-98 overtime loss in Game 5 of the semifinals. Although their journey is over, the Fever showed a lot of heart and determination despite adversity hitting them one more time with leading scorer <span><a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/wnba/news/wnba-semifinals-indiana-fever-guard-kelsey-mitchell-left-must-win-game-5-with-lower-body-cramping/\" target=\"_blank\">Kelsey Mitchell exiting the game in the third quarter.</a></span></p><p>The Fever were not expected to go very far in the playoffs due to multiple season-ending injuries to key players, including star shooter <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/wnba/players/29362921/caitlin-clark/\">Caitlin Clark</a>. However, they defied the odds and reached the semifinals for the first time since 2015.</p><p>\"They have been an absolute joy to coach,\" said coach Stephanie White postgame. \"It's an incredible group of women, an incredibly connected group. They're a great example to everybody what it means to just put one foot in front of the other, to persevere, to welcome people into the fold, to not give in to circumstance, to lead with grace and dignity, to sacrifice for a greater good and a common good. I'm just I'm so thankful to coach these women, and I'm just thankful for this experience with them.\"</p>\n<p>With so many setbacks, the spark had to come from multiple players at different moments of the season. <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/wnba/players/2130788/odyssey-sims/\">Odyssey Sims</a> showed her veteran experience on Tuesday with a 27-point performance. Five other Indiana players scored in double figures, including <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/wnba/players/29101293/aliyah-boston/\">Aliyah Boston</a>, who completed a double-double with 11 points and 16 rebounds, and <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/wnba/players/26677779/shey-peddy/\">Shey Peddy</a>, who scored seven of her 13 points off the bench in the third quarter.</p>\n<p>Mitchell left the game midway through the third quarter after she went down with what coach Stephanie White described as lower body cramping. At the time of the incident, the Fever were down 55-59. White gave her team a speech in the huddle about how they needed to stay locked in and fight for her, just like they have done for other teammates who suffered injuries this season. </p><p>The message was received and the team very much looked like they were ready to pull off the upset.</p><p>With 52 seconds remaining, Sims tied the game 84-84 on the free throw line. She then locked down on defense and stopped <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/wnba/players/26678025/jackie-young/\">Jackie Young</a> from scoring in the next possession. </p>\n<p>Things got even more difficult for the Fever when Aliyah Boston received her sixth foul with 26.4 seconds remaining in regulation, which took her out of the game and awarded Young two free throws. However, Sims remained locked in and came in clutch with a floating jump shot to even the score once more.</p>\n<p>Regulation saw multiple ties and lead changes, but overtime quickly became one-sided with <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/wnba/players/26677818/chelsea-gray/\">Chelsea Gray</a> making big plays for Las Vegas. By the end of the night, the Aces had too much depth for Indiana to overcome. Gray finished the night with 17 points, while <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/wnba/players/26677908/aja-wilson/\">A'ja Wilson</a> and Young became the first teammates to score over 30 points in playoffs history with 35 and 32 points, respectively.</p><p>Las Vegas coach <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/wnba/players/1105013/becky-hammon/\">Becky Hammon</a> gave credit to the Fever for their persistence and congratulated them for what they had accomplished.</p>\n<p>\"They would not go away. They just would not go away,\" Hammon said. \".... Just hats off to them. I thought they did an unbelievable job all the way around, their roster, their coaching staff. They just gas pedaled the whole time.\"</p><p>While this wasn't the desired outcome for the Fever, they still recognized they had a lot to be proud.</p><p>\"The ones who've been here from start to finish, they've had a lot of changes throughout the season, and for us to continue to fight, we never back down every game,\" Sims said. \"...Coach kept telling us we have more to give. So I'm super proud just to be a part of this group. We came a long way. We did. We beat the odds. We weren't even supposed to be here, and for us to be here, we finished out strong. It wasn't the outcome we wanted, but we still got to hold our heads high.\"</p>\n            </div>"

The Wings went 10-34 in Koclanes' lone season in charge, losing 10 of their first 11 games and then losing 10 of their <em>final</em> 11 games. </p><p>The Wings tied with the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/wnba/teams/CHI/chicago-sky/\">Chicago Sky</a> for the worst record in the WNBA, and Dallas allowed the second-most points per game (88.0) in the league, only ahead of the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/wnba/teams/LAS/los-angeles-sparks/\">Sparks</a>. Dallas missed the postseason for the second straight season and will now be looking for its third coach since 2020. Koclanes is the fifth consecutive Wings coach to fail to make it more than two seasons.</p><p>Expectations in Dallas were at least optimistic entering year after Buckers was taken first overall in 2025 WNBA Draft, pairing her with perennial All-Star <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/wnba/players/26678037/arike-ogunbowale/\">Arike Ogunbowale</a> and reigning Most Improved Player <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/wnba/players/26678040/dijonai-carrington/\">DiJonai Carrington</a>. Instead, the Wings got off to a slow start, and Bueckers' concussion didn't help. When the team got healthier, it showed signs of progress, including a 5-2 stretch from mid-June through early July. Ultimately, though, the team did not meld as envisioned. The Wings traded <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/wnba/players/28850649/nalyssa-smith/\">NaLyssa Smith</a> to the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/wnba/teams/LVA/las-vegas-aces/\">Aces</a> in late July and Carrington to the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/wnba/teams/MIN/minnesota-lynx/\">Lynx</a> in early August. The team's frontcourt especially struggled; no player recorded over six rebounds per game.</p>\n<p>The Wings do have a franchise cornerstone in Bueckers, the 2025 Rookie of the Year, and will hope to find another in the 2026 WNBA Draft. Dallas has a <span><a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/wnba/news/2026-wnba-mock-draft-wings-take-high-upside-center-to-pair-with-paige-bueckers-lauren-betts-goes-second/\" target=\"_blank\">40% chance to win the No. 1 pick</a></span>, best of any team.

Sunseri's departure brings additional change to a coaching staff already in flux after UCLA <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/news/deshaun-foster-fired-ucla-head-coach/\">fired coach DeShaun Foster</a> three games into the season and then parted ways with defensive coordinator Ikaika Malloe. Tight ends coach Jerry Neuheisel will assume offensive play-calling duties beginning this week when UCLA hosts No. 7 <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/teams/PSU/penn-state-nittany-lions/\">Penn State</a>.</p><p>UCLA said it has plans to finalize \"additional support\" on its offensive staff. The expectation is that former UCLA offensive coordinator Noel Mazzone, who served in the role from 2012-15, will return to the staff as an analyst, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.latimes.com/sports/ucla/story/2025-09-30/offensive-coordinator-tino-sunseri-leaving-ucla\">according to the Los Angeles Times</a>. </p><p>Neuheisel will be a first-time play-caller when he debuts in the role on Saturday. The former UCLA quarterback and son of ex-Bruins coach and quarterback Rick Neuheisel has been on staff since 2018 and served as a graduate assistant, wide receivers coach and most recently tight ends coach. Mazzone, meanwhile, had a prolific run as offensive coordinator and was responsible for the program's single-season team records for total offense, scoring and passing.</p>\n<p>Offensive struggles have been at the center of UCLA's broader issues this season. The Bruins rank 117th in the FBS in total offense with an average of 321.2 yards per game, and they are even worse at scoring, ranking 132nd with 14.2 points per contest -- this, despite the program landing heralded transfer quarterback <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/players/29123367/nico-iamaleava/\">Nico Iamaleava</a> in the spring, a move that injected hope into a program that showed encouraging signs of life down the stretch last year.</p><p>Sunseri was also a prized pickup in the offseason. He was part of <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/teams/IND/indiana-hoosiers/\">Indiana's</a> rise to national prominence last year as co-offensive coordinator and quarterbacks coach for a Hoosiers squad that made the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://cbssports.com/college-football/\">College Football</a> Playoff as one of the nation's top scoring teams. His UCLA unit was a massive letdown, however.</p>\n<p>The Bruins are in a fight to avoid one of the worst seasons in school history. The struggles came as somewhat of a surprise given the momentum they built in the second half of the 2024 season, but Foster <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/news/doomed-from-the-start-how-ucla-set-deshaun-foster-up-for-failure-why-bruins-must-swing-big-for-next-coach/\">was a questionable hire</a> when UCLA elevated him from his running backs coach role and seemed in over his head at times throughout a brief tenure.</p>\n            </div>\n    </div>"

Had the Yanks prevailed in the division, then they would've enjoyed a first-round bye. Instead, they'll face the dangerous Red Sox in an already dangerous best-of-three series. Last year, the Yankees barged to the pennant before falling to the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/teams/LAD/los-angeles-dodgers/\">Dodgers</a> in the World Series in five games. Over the winter, they lost generational free agent <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/players/2507367/juan-soto/\">Juan Soto</a> to the crosstown <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/teams/NYM/new-york-mets/\">Mets</a>, but high-value performances from <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/players/2184451/trent-grisham/\">Trent Grisham</a> and <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/players/2165919/cody-bellinger/\">Cody Bellinger</a> helped cushion the blow and then some. Besides the usual rotation questions that accompany almost any playoff team, the Yankees' big subplot will be whether AL MVP candidate <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/players/2071264/aaron-judge/\">Aaron Judge</a> can flip the script on his generalized postseason struggles.</p>\n<p><strong>Red Sox</strong>: Boston is in the postseason for the first time since 2021 and just the second time since 2018, when they last won the World Series. The challenge for Alex Cora and the Sox will be toppling the Yanks without the services of rookie phenom <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/players/29075759/roman-anthony/\">Roman Anthony</a>. Anthony was perhaps Boston's best player starting with his June call-up, but an oblique injury suffered in early September will keep him out for at least this opening round. In more general terms, the Red Sox are hoping regular-season trends hold. That's because they won nine of 13 head-to-head games against the Yankees and outscored them by a margin of 66-51. In games played in the Bronx -- where the entirety of this series will take place -- the Sox went 5-2. </p>\n            </div>"

Coincidentally, the Eagles' upcoming Week 5 opponent played a key role in protecting it. <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/DEN/denver-broncos/\">Denver Broncos</a> coach Sean Payton said he stood up in defense of the Tush Push during the league's offseason debate, and he must now game plan for it as he gears up to face the undefeated Eagles.</p><p>The NFL needed 24 of its owners to vote to ban the Tush Push in order for the play to be outlawed. Only 22 voted for the ban, keeping it alive for the 2025 campaign. It has been under the league's watchful eye, though, and the NFL <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/news/nfl-instructs-refs-to-keep-eagle-eye-on-tush-push-qb-sneaks-after-controversial-week-2/\">reminded its officials after Week 2</a> that players need to be aligned legally before the snap on that play and other variants of the quarterback sneak.</p><p>\"I was one that stood up in favor of it,\" <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-7rt9Cl4P4\">Payton said Tuesday</a>. \"The reason I stood up in favor of it is pretty simple. If the powers to be don't want it for aesthetic reasons or competitive reasons or it's hard to officiate, et cetera. But I've been involved in those meetings for a long time, and when all of the sudden health and safety was pulled into that -- which might be the safest play in football -- my bullshit nose kind of went up. Look, it's a quarterback sneak.\"</p><p>The Tush Push is a staple of the Philadelphia offense and makes near-weekly appearances in short-yardage situations, especially close to the goal line. It has been a source of discussion multiple times already this year.</p>\n<p>Even after the league placed an emphasis on pre-snap monitoring, the Eagles <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/news/eagles-appear-to-get-away-with-false-start-on-tush-push-against-los-angeles-rams/\">appeared to get away with a false start</a> the following week on one of their Tush Push reps. That was after two offensive linemen seemed to get a head start on a snap a week prior.</p><p>\"Credit Philadelphia,\" said Payton. \"They scored a touchdown last week. Take a peek at this past week's touchdown off the tush push look, and it was a sweep to the left. I'm one that looks at it -- as long as the line of scrimmage is clean, that it's a well-run quarterback sneak. When you really evaluate it, it's more the technique of the sneak than the push.</p><p>\"You go all the way back to Green Bay against Dallas in the Ice Bowl and freaking Bart Starr crosses the goal line with someone pushing a little bit behind him,\" he continued. \"I was one that was in favor of leaving it alone on Philly's side.\"</p>\n<p>Entering this season, the Eagles called quarterback sneaks 92 times since the 2022 campaign, significantly more than the three next-highest team totals combined.</p>\n            </div>"

    "body": "<div>\n        <p><span>CHICAGO –</span> It's probably too much to say that the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/teams/CHC/chicago-cubs/\">Chicago Cubs</a>' bullpen has been maligned this season, but there's no doubt their recent level of performance constitutes an improvement over 2025 taken in bulk. That was acutely obvious during the Cubs' 3-1 win (<a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/gametracker/recap/MLB_20250930_SD@CHC/\" target=\"_blank\">box score</a>) over the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/teams/SD/san-diego-padres/\">San Diego Padres</a> in Tuesday's National League Wild Card Series opener. </p><p>The first tell that the Cubs' bullpen is now a weapon rather than a shortcoming came in the top of the fifth. Chicago starter <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/players/2173411/matthew-boyd/\">Matthew Boyd</a> had just faced his 18th batter of the game and yielded a single, which meant he was about to get into the Padres' lineup for the third time in the game. Managers in the playoffs who have a strong and deep relief corps are typically loath to allow their non-ace starting pitchers to face the opposing lineup for a third time. But would Craig Counsell do the same? He would because his bullpen is different now. </p><p>With one on and one out, Counsell summoned <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/players/28837106/daniel-palencia/\">Daniel Palencia</a>, the right-hander with a big fastball who returned from a shoulder injury in time to make a pair of appearances in the final days of the regular season. It was the earliest Palencia had entered a game in almost exactly two years. It was also the first time he'd been called upon with traffic on the bases since before the All-Star break. With much improved control this season, Palencia has earned Counsell's trust, and he was trusted in a major way on Tuesday at Wrigley Field. The 25-year-old right-hander got <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/players/2507363/fernando-tatis-jr/\">Fernando Tatis Jr</a>. and <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/players/2821318/luis-arraez/\">Luis Arraez</a> to line out and keep the score 1-0. The next half-inning, the Cubs would take the lead for good on a pair of solo home runs.</p><a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/news/mlb-playoff-bracket-schedule-2025/\" target=\"_blank\">\n        <div>\n            <div>\n                <p>2025 MLB playoff bracket: Schedule, scores for Yankees vs. Red Sox, Cubs vs. Padres, more as postseason begins</p>\n                <p>\n                    Kate Feldman                </p>\n            </div>\n                            <div>\n    <figure><img alt=\"2025 MLB playoff bracket: Schedule, scores for Yankees vs. Red Sox, Cubs vs. Padres, more as postseason begins\" src=\"https://sportshub.cbsistatic.com/i/r/2025/09/29/83cd6b91-d783-48d2-b0e4-6742d0ed7a15/thumbnail/270x152/f6290680ccaa9feb6554ee8c4554a2ef/2025-mlb-bracket-final.jpg\" /></figure>\n                </div>\n                    </div>\n    </a>\n<p>\"Yeah, I think to me, that's the outing of the game that was critical,\" Counsell said after the game of Palencia's outing. \"You need outs from your starters in these games. You can't do that every day. But him throwing up five outs in five hitters and going through the top of their lineup, the game made sense after that to me; know what I mean? There was a real path right there.\"</p>\n<p>There was indeed a path. Palencia worked the sixth, picked up a pair of strikeouts, and registered his longest relief appearance since April. Then came venerable lefty <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/players/1765810/drew-pomeranz/\">Drew Pomeranz</a>, 11 years Palencia's senior, to face the three left-handed bats that Padres manager Mike Shildt had positioned all in a row in his lineup. Pomeranz retired them in order on 11 pitches. Then came <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/players/2228478/andrew-kittredge/\">Andrew Kittredge</a>, the right-handed deadline pickup who's swapped out some four-seamers for sinkers since being acquired from Baltimore and reached a higher plane. He worked a perfect frame with a strikeout and roughly an hour later was announced as Counsell's opener for Wednesday's Game 2. </p><p>Finally, it was <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/players/2823660/brad-keller/\">Brad Keller</a> to earn his first postseason save, which he did in spotless fashion. In all, the Cubs bullpen retired all 14 batters it faced in Game 1. </p><p>\"I've talked a lot about, you know, them helping each other and how that group has connected, and today was a great example of it,\" Counsell said after the game. \"You know, they get their outs, and they make their matchups the right matchups. And so just a brilliant job. Everybody made pitches, executed pitches. I can't say enough about what they did today.\"</p>\n<p>This was to be a Padres advantage coming into the series and, to be fair, it may yet still turn out that way. The Padres, of course, added at the deadline an elite high-leverage arm in <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/players/26911802/mason-miller/\">Mason Miller</a> to what was already an enviable crop of relievers. The Cubs, though, are not to be dismissed on this front, especially with Counsell now being able to lean into his strengths as a tactician. Just two relievers who date back to the Cubs' Opening Day roster -- Keller and <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/players/1961735/caleb-thielbar/\">Caleb Thielbar</a> -- are among the group now at the manager's disposal. Kittredge, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/players/2164751/taylor-rogers/\">Taylor Rogers</a>, and Michael Soroka came over leading up to the trade deadline. <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/players/2507332/aaron-civale/\">Aaron Civale</a>, claimed off waivers from the crosstown <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/teams/CHW/chicago-white-sox/\">White Sox</a>, has looked like a weapon since being converted to relief detail. </p><p>Specific to October, Counsell said this pre-game on Tuesday: \"I think you see both teams have starters that are active on the roster and may not start games. But we'll use Colin to get outs. At some point he will factor in, quite possibly in an important situation.\"</p><p>That would be tenured right-hander <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/players/2170141/colin-rea/\">Colin Rea</a>, who made 27 starts for the Cubs during the regular season and will work as a multi-inning volume reliever for them in October. That's another point of distinction when it comes to the Chicago bullpen as it exists in this moment in time. </p>\n<p>When it comes to playoff baseball, you don't want a bullpen with strikeout deficits. For a long time this season, the Cubs had such a thing, but the pen has been heavily remade to address, it seems, that very liability. If Game 1 and the month of September at large are reliable guides, then the Cubs are poised to suffocate the opposition when Counsell takes the ball from their starter.</p>\n            </div>"

After a heated postgame spat with Jaguars coach Liam Coen, who took clear exception to what was an apparent accusation of rules-skirting, Saleh walked back his comments.</p><p>Saleh said in the wake of the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/news/robert-saleh-and-liam-coen-have-heated-exchange-following-jaguars-upset-win-over-49ers/\">vulgar exchange with Coen</a> that he merely meant to compliment the Jaguars for their in-depth preparation and ability to identify and adjust to defensive play calls.</p><p>\"It's all good,\" <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=djIBDUbGitE\">Saleh said on Tuesday</a>. \"Whatever happened on Sunday doesn't change how I feel. In my heart, I genuinely was trying to give a compliment. I own the fact that I probably used a wrong choice of words. But however you want to word it, they're really, really good at putting their players in position to be successful.\"</p><p>In his initial comments, Saleh softened his verbiage when he noted that there is nothing illegal about the Jaguars' preparation and that it is common throughout the NFL. Teams are, in fact, allowed to use broadcast footage and All-22 film to identify opponents' signs and tendencies. They are not, however, allowed to film signals from unauthorized areas, including the sideline or press box.</p>\n<p>\"As coaches, we're always chasing leverage,\" said Saleh. \"They're trying to have winning leverage. We're trying to take leverage away. Everyone in the league is trying to find every avenue they can. As a coach watching their tape, I recognized the amount of hours that must be spent to be able to build formations and to be able to find every little indicator they can to give their players a chance to be in a successful position. That's exhausting.\" </p><p>He continued: \"Every team does it, some do it better than others, and it was my way of acknowledging that these guys are really, really, really good at it. Like I said, Sunday doesn't change that. I think Liam's doing a hell of a job. I really do. You can tell that team is really taking on his personality. I hope they came out of the game healthy, and I wish them the best of luck throughout the rest of the season. I wish I could have found a better choice of words, but my intent was always to compliment that staff.\"</p><p>Sign stealing is a sensitive subject in the football world after the scandal that occurred at Michigan, wherein the NCAA concluded the Wolverines conducted an elaborate advanced scouting scheme to illegally identify upcoming opponents' play calls.</p>\n<p>\"Obviously, I did a poor job with the word choice,\" Saleh said. \"I mean, if I said the word 'film study,' I don't think we're really talking about this. But I used 'signal stealing' and that's why I was so adamant about 'legally' -- I was just struggling for a word.\"</p><p>After the Jaguars defeated the 49ers on Sunday, Coen skirted a handshake with Saleh and engaged in a verbal altercation with the coordinator. Saleh could be heard on camera telling Coen that he intended to compliment him -- a stance he confirmed after the game.</p><p>\"The intent was to say exactly what I just said, that I think he's doing a really nice job, which I do,\" said Saleh. \"I just wanted to let him know that I appreciate the way he's going about his business with his football team.\"</p>\n<p>As for what caused him to respond to Coen in such a vulgar and aggressive manner, Saleh said, \"Everyone has a trigger, I guess.\"</p>\n            </div>"

    "body": "<div>\n        <p><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/wnba/teams/MIN/minnesota-lynx/\">Minnesota Lynx</a> star <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/wnba/players/26677824/napheesa-collier/\">Napheesa Collier</a> publicly called out WNBA commissioner Cathy Engelbert on Tuesday, saying the league has the \"worst leadership in the world\" in an opening statement during an end-of-season press conference. Collier went into detail about the issues facing players, and said the biggest issue facing the WNBA is \"the lack of accountability from the league office.\" Collier's comments come after she was controversially injured in the Lynx season-ending series loss to the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/wnba/teams/PHO/phoenix-mercury/\">Phoenix Mercury</a> and just one month before the current collective bargaining agreement expires.</p><p>Collier said that she has tried to keep her conversations with the leadership in private, but she decided to speak out because \"it's clear there's no intention of accepting there's a problem.\" </p><p>Collier's comments sent shockwaves around the league, and even prompted a response from Engelbert, who said she was \"disheartened\" by how Collier \"characterized our conversations.\"</p>\n<p>Minnesota teammate <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/wnba/players/26678013/alanna-smith/\">Alanna Smith</a> said the other Lynx players were aware of the statement Collier was going to read and backed her decision.</p>\n<p>\"Napheesa Collier is an outstanding leader and Officer of this Union,\" the Women's National Basketball Players Association said in a statement. \"When Phee speaks, people listen. We are confident that her words today speak to the feelings and experiences of many, if not most or all of our members. The leaders of the league and its teams would benefit from listening to her powerful statement. The players know their value even if the league does not. They are fighting for their legacy and the future of basketball.\"</p><p>Lynx coach Cheryl Reeve, <span><a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/wnba/news/lynx-coach-cheryl-reeve-fined-15000-for-playoff-outburst-and-critiques-of-officials-per-report/\" target=\"_blank\">who was suspended and fined for criticizing referees and WNBA leadership</a></span> after Collier suffered a foot injury in Game 3 of the semifinals, fully supported her player. </p><p>\"Phee's voice is an important one. I'm proud of Phee,\" the <a href=\"https://x.com/M_Hansen13/status/1973076884104630690\" target=\"_blank\">coach said.</a> \"…Who Phee has become as a player and person in this league is important.\"</p>\n<p>Players such as <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/wnba/players/26678040/dijonai-carrington/\">Dijonai Carrington</a> and <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/wnba/players/2130762/kayla-mcbride/\">Kayla McBride</a> amplified the message by sharing Collier's comments on their Instagram stories. The support also went far beyond Minnesota. <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/wnba/teams/LAS/los-angeles-sparks/\">Los Angeles Sparks</a> star <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/wnba/players/26677938/dearica-hamby/\">Dearica Hamby</a> thanked Collier for speaking out. </p>\n<p><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/wnba/players/29362937/angel-reese/\">Angel Reese</a> of <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/wnba/teams/CHI/chicago-sky/\">Chicago Sky</a>, posted a not so cryptic message on social media. \"10/10. No notes!\" Reese wrote. </p>\n<p>\"Phee National Holiday  today,\" wrote Seattle Storm's Erica Wheeler.</p>\n<p>\"Standing with Phee,\" said <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/wnba/teams/NYL/new-york-liberty/\">New York Liberty</a>'s Isabelle Harrison.</p>\n<p>\"Yall ard know we with Phee,\" said Natasha Cloud.</p>\n<p>Kalani Brown, whose Phoenix Mercury team eliminated the Lynx in the semifinals, did not shy away either.</p>\n<p>Another part of Collier's speech was that Engelbert lacked the \"human element.\" Elena Delle Donne, a two-time league MVP, highlighted this comment by saying on Instagram that Engelbert never reached out after she retired in 2023.</p><p>\"Heard from everyone but her,\" she wrote.</p>\n<p><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/wnba/teams/IND/indiana-fever/\">Indiana Fever</a> coach Stephanie White was fined after voicing support for Reeve after her suspension. She also backed Collier on Tuesday.</p><p>\"I have a lot of respect for Phee,\" White said ahead of Game 5 of the semifinals against the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/wnba/teams/LVA/las-vegas-aces/\">Las Vegas Aces</a>. \".... I'm thankful that we have strong women that are willing to say the things that matter and say the things that will move the needle for change.\"</p>\n<p>Fever guard <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/wnba/players/28850706/lexie-hull/\">Lexie Hull</a> showed support as well.</p><p>\"I think I agree with everything she said,\"Hull said. \"We're at a really important time in the league and changes need to be made, and so you're seeing her talk about that, and really proud of her for making that statement today.\"</p><p>Collier's statement also named dropped <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/wnba/players/29362921/caitlin-clark/\">Caitlin Clark</a>, saying that Engelgert told her in private that Clark \"should be grateful she makes $16 million off the court, because without the platform that the WNBA gives her, she wouldn't make anything.\" This caught the attention of Clark's teammate <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/wnba/players/26677770/sophie-cunningham/\">Sophie Cunningham</a>.</p><p>\"She's the most delusional leader our league has seen,\" Cunningham wrote in an instagram comment.</p>\n<p>The situation has also caught the attention from those outside of the WNBA.</p><p>\"Whew,\" said Indiana Pacer's Tyrese Haliburton, who has attended several Fever games.</p>\n            </div>"

Yes finally.           </p><p>The values assigned to the players below reflect a long-term measurement of their Fantasy value. Values are determined by expected future performance, future schedule, and, most importantly, public sentiment. <strong>Past performance isn't a major factor in the Trade Chart. </strong>          </p><p>By adding two players' values, you could determine what one player you should be able to get in return. However, <strong>Fantasy managers should take off 10% of the value in any trade where one side has <em>two or more</em> players than the other</strong>. Also, a handful of others only carry legitimate value in two-QB or full-PPR leagues (and thus have no value listed in one-QB or non-PPR leagues).          </p>\n<p>This list also works as a \"rest of season\" rankings for the 2025 season.           </p><p>Finally, any player not on the chart should be considered valued at no more than four points.

    "body": "<div>\n        <p><span>LONDON -- </span>It's the 60th minute of a match that is far from won. Play has been stopped before <span>Benfica's</span> Dodi Lukebakio can deliver a free kick from what looks to be a dangerous spot in the left channel. There is a tenuous 1-0 lead to worry about but there is only one thing Stamford Bridge wants to do. Not for the first nor last time tonight, Jose Mourinho's name is chanted to the rafters.</p><p>He obliges his adoring public with a wave. And another. And another. At four, a simple acknowledgment will no longer do, at least for the most rabid admirers of <span>Chelsea's</span> former manager. Top-knotted and summer scarves, a fan by the away dugout pleads for Mourinho to turn around and afford him the finest of selfies. </p><p>So much for the football, the real star of the show is the man prowling far beyond the confines of his technical area. When red and blue shirts vie for possession, Mourinho stands barely half a foot away. He stands imperial. All this is his, the house that Jose built. </p><p>Chelsea fans have spent the last four years pining for teams as gloriously arrogant and remorselessly competitive as a Special One's. Before Clearlake, the identity of this club was no less defined Roman Abramovich and his billions than by the atmosphere Jose Mourinho imbued from day one. Every game mattered. Chelsea players would fight with opponents, their officials, their employers. Rules might have been bent -- the Football Association certainly seems to think so -- because winning mattered above all else.</p>\n<p>And that was the rather dispiriting side to Mourinho's return. All the histrionics, the toying with the crowd, the yellow card at the death: they should be in pursuit of something. What has made Mourinho one of the game's great characters is how his qualities translate themselves onto the field. Even when his teams cost hundreds of millions to assemble, they play with the spirit of underdogs. They snap and snarl, imbuing the contest with a sense of jeopardy.</p><p>Not this time. Perhaps that is just a function of this being match two of the eight game league phase. The tame denouement of a dreary game indicated as much. Richard Rios' first half own goal won't decide whether Benfica reach the knockout stages with a top 24 finish. It might not be the decisive game in Chelsea winning a bye to the last 16. </p><p>Still the mere presence of a Mourinho at the peak of his powers would have raised the stakes significantly whatever the occasion. He will always be adored in this part of London but he should be feared too. Enzo Maresca rolling out what looked like it would pass for last season's Conference League attack might have gone punished but a heavily rotated Chelsea side were still far ahead of Benfica in talent terms. When Mourinho rocked up with Inter, <span>Manchester United</span> or Tottenham, he was afforded the same adulation he got tonight. That came with a caveat, mind. Hostilities would soon commence and Mourinho's players would offer Chelsea no quarter.</p>\n<p>If it had been anything like that tonight, this could have gone badly wrong for Maresca, who really did not need an illustrious predecessor returning at a time while his team was faltering. The performances befitting their titles were not coming before tonight and they did not come tonight either. The world champions were not very good. They didn't need to be. Their visitors worked hard and flashed danger down the flanks, particularly through Lukebakio, yet only seemed to really threaten Robert Sanchez's goal when Frederik Aursnes was in an offside position. There was no bus parking from Benfica but this team lacked the verve and motor to really test Maresca's. When Mourinho did spot the sort of opening that he would have pounced on in his prime, it was shut down in a flash.</p><p>\"I tried to change the left winger because I saw Malo Gusto was in trouble,\" he said. \"Maresca has Malo Gusto in difficulty. Maresca put on a better player than Malo Gusto [Reece James]. This is the challenge of facing Chelsea.\"</p><p>Ultimately, if the second half felt like it was building towards anything, it was the Mourinho post-match press conference, which, box office though he may be, was this subdued homecoming writ large. As he had Monday, Mourinho embraced old friends and indulged in his more reflective side. That almost seemed to be the point, cameras pointed at his conversations and pile of biscuits, the matter of what happened on the pitch rather parked to the side.</p>\n<p>When he spoke in English, he had a legacy: that familiar reminder of his sacking before he could bring a trophy to Spurs, that insistence that he is more motivated than ever to win silverware, a reaffirming of his standing at Chelsea.</p><p>\"I thank them,\" he said to those who had so welcomed him back home. \"I didn't on the pitch, I was focused on the game but you have the sound. When I'm in London, I meet them every day. I know there is going to be relation forever. </p><p>\"Hopefully I come here with my grandkids in 20 years. They belong to my history. I belong to their history.\"</p>\n<p>That is it though, isn't it? It's all history now. Mourinho might say, \"I don't feed myself with memories, I feed myself with victories and results,\" but he has long since lost the teeth and claws to take down the biggest prey. </p><p>The days when he was one of the big beasts ended when he left Tottenham, if not before. But in drifting first to Italy, then Turkey and now back to where it all began, the decline could go unconfronted. Not tonight. This was a night to celebrate what he once was. What he might yet be scarcely feels relevant on Champions League nights.</p>\n            </div>"

    "body": "<div>\n        <p>On Wednesday, history will be made in Austin when Austin FC and Nashville SC meet in the Lamar Hunt U.S. Open Cup final at Q2 Stadium, which can be seen on <a href=\"https://cbs-sports.app.link/ny3ywBQBBjb\" target=\"_blank\">CBS Sports Network</a> at 8 p.m. ET. It's the second appearance for Nashville in a cup final of any sort after losing to Inter Miami on penalties in the 2023 Leagues Cup final, while it's the first cup final in club history for Austin. Both have met four times, with Nashville holding the series lead with two wins, one draw, and one loss.</p><p>For teams that began play in 2020 (Nashville SC) and 2021 (Austin FC), this is one of the biggest moments in their history, a fact that isn't lost on Nashville defender Jack Maher. </p><p>\"It means the world to me. It's something that [coach] B.J. Callaghan has made it clear that we're striving for. In the locker room, guys are talking about it,\" Maher said on CBS Sports Golazo's Morning Footy. \"We want to be the first ever professional sports team in the state of Tennessee to bring home a trophy, and for us to be able to do that not only for the guys in the locker room but the fans and everyone in the whole state of Tennessee, I think that means the world.\"</p>\n<h2>How to watch Austin FC vs. Nashville SC, odds</h2><ul><li><strong>Date</strong>: Wednesday, Oct. 1 | <strong>Time</strong>: 8 p.m. ET</li><li><strong>Location</strong>: Q2 Stadium -- Austin, Texas</li><li><strong>TV: </strong>CBS Sports Network | <strong>Live stream: </strong><a href=\"https://www.paramountplus.com/?cbscidmt=sports&ftag=PPM-22-10agi2j\" target=\"_blank\">Paramount+</a></li><li><strong>Odds: </strong>Austin FC +165; Draw +230; Nashville SC +145</li></ul><p>Austin FC look to become the third team from Texas to lift a U.S. Open Cup title and join the Houston Dynamo and FC Dallas. They are two evenly matched sides, but what may determine this are the star attackers. Austin have had to adjust things after losing Brandon Vazquez for the season in July, and it has worked to great effect. Since then, Austin have only lost three of their nine matches due to strength in the air, scoring 11 goals this season from headers, which is the second most in MLS play.</p><p>For Nashville, not only do they have experience with four players having won this competition with different clubs, but their forwards will also be something to watch. The club have only lost one game when star striker Sam Surridge has scored this season, and it was a hat trick from the Englishman that pushed them past the Philadelphia Union to this point. Surridge has 27 goals in 33 appearances in all competitions, but if Austin focus too much on him, Hany Mukhtar will make them pay.</p>\n<p>It makes for a long night in Texas and a fascinating Open Cup final. In a tournament that has undergone changes with Champions Cup teams being pulled out due to fixture congestion, a clash of these two sides shows that the Open Cup can still be a magical experience with a club-defining trophy on the line.</p>\n            </div>"

    "body": "<div>\n        <p><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/teams/OREGST/oregon-state-beavers/\">Oregon State</a> is in the throes of a winless season, off to an 0-5 start for the first time since 1996. It is a low point for a program that has been through the wringer over the last two years. The Beavers looked rudderless across their first five games with costly special teams gaffes aplenty and an offense unable to pull its feet out of the mud. Despite all the turmoil, second-year coach Trent Bray likely still has some runway ahead of him.</p><p>This season's failures have been in the making for some time. It was just two seasons ago that Oregon State was a born-again Pac-12 contender and mainstay in the national rankings, a status it held for much of the 21st century before a period of dormancy. But then 10 schools left the Pac-12, leaving the Beavers and <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/teams/WASHST/washington-state-cougars/\">Washington State</a> in the dust. Jonathan Smith left his post atop the program to take the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/teams/MICHST/michigan-state-spartans/\">Michigan State</a> job. The transfer portal gutted the roster of its best players, including promising QB Aidan Chiles, who followed Smith to East Lansing. </p><p>Bray, an institution in Corvallis as a former star linebacker and longtime standout assistant coach, stepped up when Oregon State needed stability. His rise to the head coaching role sparked enthusiasm because of his track record as a winner, contagious energy and passion for his alma mater.</p><p>Things haven't panned out. The Beavers fell short of expectations in Bray's five-win debut season, and barring a sharp turnaround, Year 2 is on pace to be a campaign of further regression.</p>\n<p>Whether the Beavers should move on from Bray and whether they will are two different questions. A downtrodden program seeking to find its footing in the new <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://cbssports.com/college-football/\">college football</a> landscape has to have the right leader in place, and nothing the Oregon State staff showed over its first year and a half together suggested it is fit for the job. This school is historically patient, though, and Bray likely has a longer leash than his staffers given what he means to Oregon State.</p><h2>What could happen</h2><p>The chances Oregon State fires Bray are probably slimmer than one would think. The program has long been a subscriber to the \"success is not always linear\" theory, and in many instances, it paid off. Remember, Smith posted three consecutive losing seasons to open his tenure and needed until Year 5 for a full breakthrough. The Beavers stuck with <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/players/28920388/mike-riley/\">Mike Riley</a> through a few valleys in order to get back to his numerous peaks.</p><p>Truth be told, this simply is not a program that typically fires football coaches. It has had some good ones over the years, and maybe Bray is not one of them.

Offensive coordinator Ryan Gunderson and special teams coordinator Jamie Christian are on thin ice after their groups appeared hapless for much of the 0-5 start.</p><p>Christian's situation is the most dire. With long snapper <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/players/3129244/dylan-black/\">Dylan Black</a> injured, special teams errors in his absence have been the difference in two games: losses to <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/teams/FRESNO/fresno-state-bulldogs/\">Fresno State</a> and <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/teams/HOU/houston-cougars/\">Houston</a>. Poor snaps cost the Beavers on extra points, field goals and punts against the Bulldogs, and twice against the Cougars they had field goal attempts blocked -- including on what would have been a game-winning kick.</p><p>Gunderson is under the microscope, too. Despite the Beavers investing more than $1 million in quarterback <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/players/28873707/maalik-murphy/\">Maalik Murphy</a>, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/news/highest-paid-player-in-college-football-history-transfer-qb-darian-mensahs-duke-deal-is-sign-of-times/\">who was reportedly forced out</a> of <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/teams/DUKE/duke-blue-devils/\">Duke</a> after a historically successful season with the Blue Devils, they have yet to score more than 27 points in a game. A rushing attack that was supposed to be this offense's bread and butter has not panned out, either, ranking 127th nationally at 93.8 yards per contest.</p><h2>What should happen</h2><p>Oregon State has been forced into myriad tough decisions over the last two years because of realities largely out of its own control. When it comes to football leadership, however, the Beavers finally have a say in the direction of their program. They have the resources to perennially contend for Pac-12 titles in the rebuilt conference if they put the right people in charge. As unlikely as it may be for them to fire more than a couple of coordinators, they may have to include their head coach in that leadership change to ensure they enter the new-look Pac-12 next season with a shot at winning over the long haul.</p><p>If athletic director Scott Barnes -- who has taken much flak from the fanbase himself throughout the university's tumult -- cannot bring himself to fire Bray, the second-year coach could do what many of his predecessors did before him. Step down.</p><p>Bray went on the record during his run as Oregon State's defensive coordinator saying that he did not have head coaching ambitions. Ahead of this season, he retook control of defensive playcalling duties and noted that he missed that side of coaching. Bray calls defenses and coaches linebackers with the absolute best of them and built a long career across multiple power conference schools doing just that. Perhaps he should return to that role and allow a more seasoned coach to run the CEO job.</p><p>Oregon State has already fallen from power conference contender to Group of Six also-ran, and to be blunt, it cannot afford to sink further with the wrong coach at the helm. Bray could still be that guy, and the Beavers will give him a chance to prove it. But if it becomes any more clear that the issue starts with him and not his coordinators, he or Barnes have to pull the plug.</p>\n            </div>"
