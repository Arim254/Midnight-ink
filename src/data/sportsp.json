Though the sentiment was likely derived from Henry Kissinger, it's only fitting that the quote about how \"what must be done eventually should be done immediately\" is often attributed to someone who spent their career hiring and firing coaches. </p><p>More than ever, the industry appears to be taking the expression to heart. <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/teams/OKLAST/oklahoma-state-cowboys/\">Oklahoma State's</a> Mike Gundy became the third Power Four coach <span><a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/news/mike-gundy-fired-oklahoma-state-head-coach/\" target=\"_blank\">fired on Tuesday</a></span>, less than a month into the 2025 <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://cbssports.com/college-football/\">college football</a> season.</p><p>Why are schools moving so quickly to change regimes? More so than ever, there are advantages to doing immediately that which must be done eventually.</p><p>While it may not have been a primary motivating factor for the coach firings at <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/teams/VATECH/virginia-tech-hokies/\">Virginia Tech</a>, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/teams/UCLA/ucla-bruins/\">UCLA</a> and Oklahoma State, changing dynamics with the transfer portal could make in-season firings more popular.</p>\n<a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/news/oklahoma-state-coaching-candidates-gj-kinne-dana-holgorsen-among-options-on-hot-board-to-replace-mike-gundy/\" target=\"_blank\">\n        <div>\n            <div>\n                <p>Oklahoma State coaching candidates: GJ Kinne, Dana Holgorsen among options on hot board to replace Mike Gundy</p>\n                <p>\n                    Chris Hummer                </p>\n            </div>\n                            <div>\n    <figure><img alt=\"Oklahoma State coaching candidates: GJ Kinne, Dana Holgorsen among options on hot board to replace Mike Gundy\" src=\"https://sportshub.cbsistatic.com/i/r/2025/09/23/4a34844a-36da-410b-a1eb-1520d2f8ad0c/thumbnail/270x152/188aaa1fb897bb66bd8929806b8b1086/dana-holgorsen.png\" /></figure>\n                </div>\n                    </div>\n    </a>\n<p>With the sport moving to a <span><a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/news/ncaa-approves-single-transfer-portal-window-how-the-new-rule-will-impact-college-football/\" target=\"_blank\">single portal window</a></span> that is likely to land in January (exact dates will likely be determined next month), programs that move early could have an advantage on those that wait.</p><p>All players have 30 days to enter the portal after their current coach is fired or resigns. But for the three who have made September moves, there has been no mass exodus. Why? It's the middle of the season, and entering the portal could jeopardize compensation amid a record-setting year for player pay.</p><p>The 30-day portal window at UCLA, Virginia Tech and Oklahoma State will almost assuredly be over by the time coaches are hired at those three schools. Thus, the new coaches won't be conducting their introductory press conferences with rosters crumbling beneath their feet.</p>\n<p>It could look much different for programs that wait until late November to fire their coaches. At that point, the 30-day window will cover most of December. The season will be over, direct deposits will have landed, and players from those schools will be able to get a head start in the portal before it opens for everyone in January. </p><p>Retaining players from the previous regime under those circumstances will be more challenging. Make no mistake: there will be significant attrition at UCLA,  Virginia Tech and Oklahoma State. Their new coaches may not see much they like in that first team meeting.</p><p>But there won't be an immediate exit hatch for players on those teams when the new coach is introduced. The new coaches, whoever they may be, will have time to evaluate the existing rosters and pitch the players they want to keep on staying around.</p>\n<p>Depending what sort of organizational structure schools choose to build, making an early coaching change could also help in high school recruiting. Yes, getting a sitting head coach in place well in advance of the Dec. 3-5 early signing period will be tough.</p><p>But the day of programs hiring general managers to supersede the head coach in organizational hierarchy has arrived. The GM is a hire which can be made in October, and that's a person who can lay some roster groundwork before the head coach arrives.</p>\n<p>Cal and <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/teams/STNFRD/stanford-cardinal/\">Stanford</a> -- obsolete as they may be -- are two Power Four examples of programs with GMs at the top of the food chain. More are coming. Virginia Tech legend and <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://cbssports.com/nfl/superbowl/\">Super Bowl</a> winning head coach Bruce Arians suggested in an appearance on the \"Pat McAfee Show\" that the Hokies will follow that blueprint by hiring a general manager to be \"in charge of football\" before hiring a coach.</p>\n<p>Such an organizational overhaul further necessitated early action for the Hokies amid an 0-3 start.</p><p>Horrendous on-field results ultimately dictated the decisions at UCLA, Virginia Tech and Oklahoma State. But they could reap some benefits from acting quickly instead of delaying the inevitable.</p>\n            </div>"

The No. 2 overall pick in the 2025 <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://cbssports.com/nfl/draft/\">NFL Draft</a> has not played more than 68.3% of the snaps on offense or defense for Jacksonville, according to Pro Football Reference, which is a dramatic decrease from his usage at Colorado last season.</p><p>The Jaguars have been taking a patient approach to finding a role for one of the most unique draft prospects in recent memory, who can play on both sides of the ball. Even if potential injuries pop up at wide receiver or cornerback, Jaguars coach Liam Coen doesn't expect his role to change drastically immediately. </p><p>\"Right now he's one position on offense and one position on defense,\" <a href=\"https://x.com/joshnorris/status/1970889962544607733?s=46&t=2g0OABtTqzz-o27Vvt3krA\" target=\"_blank\">Coen said on Wednesday</a>. \"Now that doesn't really fully change. It's just the next guy having to go and adjust to go play some 'Z,' which happened in the game. So, I don't think [injuries] change much.</p><p>\"I don't think it's fair to go say 'hey dude, go learn Z and X and 12 and this and that.' We have to make sure he can go execute what we are asking him to do first and foremost, which is to play 'F' and corner.\"</p><p>Hunter has caught 10 passes for 76 yards on offense, while recording nine tackles with a pass breakup on defense. His lone catch during Jacksonville's 17-10 win over the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/HOU/houston-texans/\">Houston Texans</a> in Week 3 was a 21-yard catch -- which marked the longest reception of his young NFL career. </p>\n<p>\"I wouldn't say he's behind,\" Coen said. \"I think we can probably do a better job of helping him in some ways. We had a great talk with Trav after this past game, in terms of just man like, all right, 'how can we help you and put you?' Because guys, right, what is he learning? It's a lot. So we've got to, I think, be a little bit more diligent in terms of putting him in positions to maybe not have to do as many moving parts, so that we can just let him go play.\"</p><p>Coen's comments come <span><a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/news/deion-sanders-calls-on-jaguars-to-alter-travis-hunters-rookie-role-theyre-not-using-him-enough/\" target=\"_blank\">just days after Hunter's former coach at Colorado, Deion Sanders,</a></span> said on a recent <em>New Heights </em><a href=\"https://lnk.to/NewHeightsPodcast\" target=\"_blank\">podcast episode</a> that the Jaguars weren't \"using him enough.\"</p><p>\"They're not using him enough,\" <a href=\"https://lnk.to/NewHeightsPodcast\" target=\"_blank\">Sanders said</a>. \"I've seen it with my own eyes on an everyday basis for three straight years, so I know what he's capable of, and I know how you've got to take care of him.

    "body": "<div>\n        <p>BETHPAGE, N.Y. -- For as much criticism as the United States Ryder Cup team tends to receive, it has won two of the last four editions of the competition, including the last two times the event has been contested on home soil. When stateside, the red, white and blue has largely looked the part. Outside of a historic European comeback in 2012, the trophy has been raised by the home team for nearly two decades straight.</p><p>Whereas the Americans had a distinct talent advantage four years ago at Whistling Straits en route to a historic 19-9 victory, the gap has closed markedly entering the 2025 playing at Bethpage Black. The Europeans will trot out 11 of the same players they did in Rome two years ago, the likes of Rory McIlroy, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood, Viktor Hovland, Ludvig Åberg and Justin Rose reprising their roles as thorns in the side of the U.S. These are grand slam winners, major champions, FedEx Cup crown wearers and stars of not only the present but the future.</p><p>Back to the talent gap that existed in 2021. It was so vast that a correction was bound to occur; however, it has vanashed to such a significant degree that players who appeared to be long-time fixtures like Jordan Spieth, Dustin Johnson, Patrick Reed and Brooks Koepka are nowhere to be seen in New York. The experience level outside the ropes is just as fresh with captain Keegan Bradley stepping into the role against Luke Donald, a man who has already raised the Ryder Cup as a captain two years ago.</p><p>\"My main goal is to put these players in their best position to play well,\" Bradley said. \"When you do that, the guys can go out and perform at their highest level. But ultimately, the players are going to decide the Ryder Cup.</p>\n<p>\"But I definitely think the captain and the vice captains, their main goal here, their main job is to put the players in the best position to play at their best. Every day we go out, whether it's Friday of the tournament or a practice round, we want to make sure the guys are in the right state of mind with the right mindset of what we want to do during the week and get them prepared to be ready to go on Friday morning.\"</p><p>All of this leaves the U.S., meager -150 favorites per BetMGM Sportsbook, needing to find an advantage elsewhere, and ultimately, it will be a few small margins adding up to one big one if the Americans are able to discover what is needed. After all, Europe offers three of the top four players entering this Ryder Cup, while the Untied States is much stronger in the middle of its lineup -- as evidenced by CBS Sports' <span><a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/golf/news/ryder-cup-2025-predictions-team-usa-europe-roster-rankings/\" target=\"_blank\">1-24 ranking of the Ryder Cup rosters</a></span>.</p><p>Let's examine the possibilities below and break down exactly how the U.S. can defend home soil at the 45th playing of the Ryder Cup.</p>\n<h2>How the United States can win the 2025 Ryder Cup</h2><h3>Win the opening session</h3><p>The U.S. has typically fared well Friday morning of the Ryder Cup -- up until the 2023 edition in Marco Simone. Falling down 4-0 just four hours into the competition, the U.S. was immediately put behind the eight ball, and as such, the Ryder Cup was pretty much over just as it started. That cannot happen again, especially on home soil, and there is history to suggest it will not.</p><p>U.S. won opening foursomes 3-1 in 2021 and 4-0 in 2016. Other recent iterations of the competition largely started with four-ball (U.S. held leads of 3-1 in 2018, 2.5-1.5 in 2014), which tends to be a better format for the U.S. Therefore, if the Americans are able to get off to a strong start Friday it will have a snowball effect on both the atmosphere outside the ropes and the confidence inside them. </p>\n<h3>Suffocate Europeans with the home crowd</h3><p>There is a stigma around the Americans that they do not care as much as the Europeans do about the Ryder Cup -- or at least not act like it from an outward emotional standpoint. Well, one way to squash that criticism is to have thousands of New York sports fans doing the heavy lifting for you.</p>\n<p>There will be no sleepwalking off the bus like in Rome for the U.S. With the likes of Bryson DeChambeau and Justin Thomas on the team and Bradley at the helm, the key is to keep the energy up throughout the three days. Fans can grow restless if their side is sluggish and out of whack -- <span><a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/golf/news/ryder-cup-2025-europe-road-team-usa-miracle-at-medinah-2012/\" target=\"_blank\">precisely what the Europeans will hope to accomplish</a></span> -- but these are New Yorkers we're talking about. Keep them happy early and often, and Europe will be dealing with hostility from start to finish.</p><p>\"The fans are what make this event special,\" Xander Schauffele said. \"If you think about not having fans or enough of them, it would be like what we did ... [practicing] with my teammates out here in sort of peace and quiet. But when it comes to getting the juices flowing of the Ryder Cup, you need fans to be there. You need them to do their thing. </p><p>\"I don't have anything sort of -- whether it's everyone singing their songs, they're sort of like pub drinking songs in Europe or the sort of heavy 'U-S-A' chants we get here, I love all of it, to be completely honest.\"</p>\n<h3>Stalwarts must show up</h3><p>Europe has an uncanny ability throughout the years of having their go-to guys show up no matter their incoming form. If they absolutely<em> had</em> to have a match, they knew where to look. </p><p>Collin Montgomerie went 4-0-1 in 2002 as the 31st-ranked player in Data Golf, 3-1-0 as No. 91 two years later. Ian Poulter went 4-1-0 at Valhalla as No. 41 and 3-1-0 at Celtic Manor as No. 57, respectively. Of course, we all remember what he did at Medinah, flipping the competition on its head Saturday evening and going 4-0-0 on the week.</p><p>The point: Ryder Cups can hardly be won without the help of your stalwarts whether European or American, and that feels especially true this year for the U.S. Scottie Scheffler seems like a sure thing -- the world No. 1 will need to be! -- but the U.S. will also need contributions from Schauffele, DeChambeau, Thomas and Collin Morikawa -- in some capacity -- considering they are four two-time major champions who have been there and done that but may have some question marks. There is a reason experience can be a valuable commodity, so go out and show why.</p>\n<p>\"I feel like Bryson could be like the difference for us in a strange way from the standpoint of feeding into these fans, the style of golf he plays,\" Schauffele said. \"And also how -- like you'll get me, I'll make a putt, and you won't see too much of a reaction. That's just who I am. That's kind of how I operate. Maybe it might change this week, who knows. These Ryder Cups bring out the best in you at times. </p><p>\"But Bryson is like, this is his arena. If he views himself as a gladiator golfer, this is as good as it gets. He's been awesome. He's been awesome in the team room. I'm excited to sort of see what he can do, and hopefully get a lot of points up on the board because his points might hit harder than maybe my points, for example, just because of how he might celebrate and get these fans into this tournament quickly.\"</p><a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/golf/news/ryder-cup-2025-europe-road-team-usa-miracle-at-medinah-2012/\" target=\"_blank\">\n        <div>\n            <div>\n                <p>Why Europe can become first team to win Ryder Cup on road since 2012 Miracle at Medinah</p>\n                <p>\n                    Robby Kalland                </p>\n            </div>\n                            <div>\n    <figure><img alt=\"Why Europe can become first team to win Ryder Cup on road since 2012 Miracle at Medinah\" src=\"https://sportshub.cbsistatic.com/i/r/2025/09/24/15051386-726b-46fa-94ba-699c6b72be0f/thumbnail/270x152/cfaa88c1df7423cd7ae9b2c3c0b0e93c/rory-mcilroy-luke-donald-europe-ryder-cup-g.jpg\" /></figure>\n                </div>\n                    </div>\n    </a>\n<h3>Don't be afraid to run the rookies</h3><p>Not all experience is good, though! Just ask Matt Fitzpatrick from the European side and even more so when the rookies from the U.S. have been fast learners in Ryder Cups -- whether Max Homa in Rome, Thomas in Paris or much of the team in Wisconsin. Bradley's ability to balance the experience on his team and the form of his rookies is what may ultimately decide this Ryder Cup.</p>\n<p>Behind Scheffler, the four rookies on the U.S. team -- Russell Henley, J.J. Spaun, Ben Griffin and Cameron Young -- have been the most in-form players (based on total strokes gained) over the last three months. The straightforward strategy may be to let them ride with some training wheels with a veteran guiding them along, but the winning strategy may be to let them go without the governor in the golf cart.</p><p>\"I was actually talking to J.T. about it. I think … it's great to have gotten that experience, especially in a way, Presidents Cup last year, and it kind of -- the more times -- basically he said the more times you can be on a team and get that team experience, the more valuable it is,\" Henley said. \"He said he was really happy that he got to play a Presidents Cup before his first Ryder Cup.\"</p><h3>Withstand the surge</h3><p>This certainly could be a Ryder Cup with momentum swing after momentum swing, not all too dissimilar from the first couple of days at the Presidents Cup where the U.S. went up 5-0 only for the International team to tie it up at 5-5 following the second session of play. Perhaps, it won't play out to that drastic of an extent, but big putts and big moments will be had by both teams and it will be the task of the U.S. to not let things start moving faster.</p>\n<p>It will be easy for them to do so as the more inexperienced side and this is where the role of Bradley, the team leaders and the preparation will show and show if this U.S. team is capable of meeting the moment or susceptible to wilting under the Ryder Cup pressure.</p>\n            </div>"

With all of their size, defense and now elite scoring in Durant, VanVleet was the one who was going to tie it all together. <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nba/players/29005049/amen-thompson/\">Amen Thompson</a> is going to get his shot running the offense and maybe <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nba/players/29231118/reed-sheppard/\">Reed Sheppard</a> breaks out, but realistically, Houston has to be thinking about trade options to replace VanVleet. Here are 10 they should be considering.</p><a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nba/news/fred-vanvleet-injury-ripple-effects-what-it-could-mean-for-amen-thompson-reed-sheppard-and-the-rockets/\" target=\"_blank\">\n        <div>\n            <div>\n                <p>Fred VanVleet injury ripple effects: What it could mean for Amen Thompson, Reed Sheppard and the Rockets</p>\n                <p>\n                    Sam Quinn                </p>\n            </div>\n                            <div>\n    <figure><img alt=\"Fred VanVleet injury ripple effects: What it could mean for Amen Thompson, Reed Sheppard and the Rockets\" src=\"https://sportshub.cbsistatic.com/i/r/2025/09/23/a2888236-0453-4e8c-b015-99e892b953b8/thumbnail/270x152/8b2cef7113532ca835a446f414705acb/fred-vanvleet-amen-thompson-getty.png\" /></figure>\n                </div>\n                    </div>\n    </a>\n<h2>1. <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nba/players/2844730/derrick-white/\">Derrick White</a></h2><p>We're swinging for the fences right out of the gate, and so should the Rockets. Boston is in a gap year. White is a considerable upgrade from VanVleet and is locked up for the next four years, so this wouldn't, unlike a few other options we'll talk about, be a short-term solution. White is the new <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nba/players/1685257/jrue-holiday/\">Jrue Holiday</a>. A winner in every sense and the perfect fit alongside any star in any system. If you're on the cusp of contention, he's <em>the guy</em> to put you over the top. </p><p>Problem is, Boston loves him as much as everyone else. Who knows if they would seriously entertain a deal, but if they did, it would cost something major. Fortunately, the Rockets have all kinds of draft capital to dangle and good young players/prospects in Reed Sheppard, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nba/players/26776259/jabari-smith/\">Jabari Smith</a> Jr. and/or <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nba/players/3178111/tari-eason/\">Tari Eason</a>. This should have been Houston's first call upon receiving the VanVleet news, because there's an honest deal to at least discuss that could benefit both sides. </p>\n<h2>2. <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nba/players/3041935/andrew-nembhard/\">Andrew Nembhard</a></h2><p>This would be another home run for the Rockets and the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nba/teams/IND/indiana-pacers/\">Pacers</a> are basically punting on this season anyway without <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nba/players/3041074/tyrese-haliburton/\">Tyrese Haliburton</a>. Nembhard wouldn't come cheap. Indiana loves him, and rightfully so. He's in their plans well beyond this season because he's awesome. But if the Rockets believe Nembhard would put them over the top, which they should, overwhelming the Pacers with a package that could fund their future would make real sense for both sides. </p><p>Would you give up Sheppard for Nembhard? I would. But I can understand someone saying they wouldn't. Sheppard is the theoretical perfect fit next to Amen Thompson long term because of his shooting (at least what we expect his shooting to eventually be). Durant makes this a win-now situation for Houston, but they still have to consider the long-term core of Thompson, Sengun and Sheppard. This is a true two-timeline deal in Houston. </p><p>All that said, just know that Nembhard is a legit starting point guard on a championship team. He's that level of good on both ends. Reed Sheppard not becoming that level of player wouldn't be a shock. Houston should be making this call and at least seeing if they can pique Indiana's interest without including Sheppard. </p>\n<h2>3. Jrue Holiday</h2><p>Holiday would be perfect for the Rockets for all the same reasons White would be, only he's probably a lot more gettable. There's a reason for that. Holiday is an older, worse player than White and he's on a worse contract to boot. Houston might regret the deal two years or even one year from now, but with Durant about to turn 37, this is <em>right now</em> time in Houston. </p><p>Holiday's VanVleet-like value in Portland as an in-house mentor for <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nba/players/29005041/scoot-henderson/\">Scoot Henderson</a> and <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nba/players/26893318/shaedon-sharpe/\">Shaedon Sharpe</a> (which <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nba/players/1992810/damian-lillard/\">Damian Lillard</a> can now at least somewhat replace from the sideline anyway) notwithstanding, I'm still trying to figure out why the Blazers signed up to pay him $105 million over the next three years to <em>maybe </em>crack the play-in. </p><p>This deal was a mistake, just like the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nba/players/2135533/jerami-grant/\">Jerami Grant</a> contract, and they should be looking to get out of it if Houston comes calling. Holiday is on the downslope, but he would still represent a real boost to Houston's title chances as a trusted ball handler and still top-tier defender and they wouldn't have to give up nearly as much to get him as they would White. </p>\n<h2>4. C.J. McCollum</h2><p>McCollum wouldn't bring the defense that White or Holiday would, but Houston is long and defensively deep enough to insulate. The upshot is McCollum is still a bonafide playoff scorer and a 3-point sharpshooter (which the Rockets could really use) who can be trusted with lead-guard responsibilities in tense playoff possessions. </p><p>Also good news: McCollum is on an expiring contract, so he's not going to jam up Houston's books beyond this season. VanVleet and some filler salary makes the money work. Would Houston be willing to give up a future first for a 34-year-old before he potentially hits the buyout market? If so, the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nba/teams/WAS/washington-wizards/\">Wizards</a> would be insane not to do it. </p><h2>5. <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nba/players/2268374/payton-pritchard/\">Payton Pritchard</a></h2><p>This is probably my favorite target for the Rockets. Pritchard is a bonafide offensive weapon and even though he definitely has size limitations, he's an ultra competitive defender who can make an honest two-way difference -- especially with the kind of support Houston has to offer. </p>\n<p>Personally, I would personally include Sheppard in a deal with the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nba/teams/BOS/boston-celtics/\">Celtics</a> for Pritchard. I think he's that good. I actually think Pritchard is pretty close to the most realistic comp for what Sheppard can turn into anyway. The size is very similar. I have to squint to see major things Sheppard can do that Pritchard can't. Maybe Sheppard winds up being a little better in three or four years, but for the immediate value Pritchard brings to a team intent on current contention, the short-term payoff, to me, is worth the long-term risk. </p><h2>6. <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nba/players/2892395/jose-alvarado/\">Jose Alvarado</a></h2><p>Who doesn't love Alvarado off the bench? Now, could he be the starting point guard on a championship team? I think in this specific Houston situation, where he still wouldn't have to play huge minutes with Thompson and, hopefully, Sheppard in position to timeshare, the answer is probably yes. Or even if he doesn't start, it's really about sharing playoff innings if Thompson isn't ready for that full responsibility. </p><p>Alvarado is very small, but Houston is collectively very big. He can shoot, handle and pressure the ball. He's cheap at $4.5 million with a player option he will likely decline in 2026. New Orleans traded for <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nba/players/2892690/jordan-poole/\">Jordan Poole</a> (somebody still needs to explain this to me) and drafted <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nba/players/29558457/jeremiah-fears/\">Jeremiah Fears</a>, and <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nba/players/2203544/dejounte-murray/\">Dejounte Murray</a> is still around, meaning point/combo guard minutes are clogged. </p>\n<p>Houston should at least kick the tires to see if Alvarado is available for a return package that wouldn't really impact their core rotation (<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nba/players/2152731/jaesean-tate/\">Jae'Sean Tate</a> and a pick could be the crux of a friendly offer). </p><h2>7. <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nba/players/2891955/collin-sexton/\">Collin Sexton</a></h2><p>If you think Sexton was largely forgotten about in Utah, he's just entered the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://cbssports.com/nba/\">NBA's</a> witness protection program in Charlotte. He's on an expiring $19 million deal, and he can play. This is a guy who has averaged north of 18 PPG on 40% 3-point shooting in each of the last two seasons in just 27-28 minutes. High-level competitor. Will not be shy in the big moments in which the Rockets expect to be playing. </p><p>The question is: How much are you willing to give up to get Sexton, who you would then have to pay probably north of $20 million annually next season to keep? Really, this question applies to any offense-centric target. Trading Dillons Brooks and losing VanVleet meaningfully dents the defense, and now if the Rockets turn around and include Tari Eason or Jabari Smith Jr. for another player who doesn't defend (insert any potential target from <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nba/players/3042352/tyler-herro/\">Tyler Herro</a> on down), suddenly this becomes more of an offensive-based team with Amen Thompson left to lift whatever is left of the once elite perimeter defense. These are not easy decisions. </p>\n<h2>8. <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nba/players/2268642/ty-jerome/\">Ty Jerome</a></h2><p>The <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nba/teams/MEM/memphis-grizzlies/\">Grizzlies</a> just signed Jerome but they also have <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nba/players/3142395/scotty-pippen-jr/\">Scotty Pippen Jr</a>. (who we'll get to shortly) to play behind <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nba/players/2892772/ja-morant/\">Ja Morant</a>. Jerome showed with the Cavs last year that he isn't just good enough to contribute in high-leverage playoff games; he can flat out take them over. </p><p>This gets back to the pickle of the Sexton discussion where Houston is potentially shedding yet another defender for a more offensive guy, but I'm still wondering who says no to a straight-up Jerome for Tari Eason deal. </p><h2>9. Scotty Pippen Jr. </h2><p>Pippen Jr. is basically VanVleet but not as good. He's sturdy. He defends. He can shoot. He's on a rock-bottom contract at less than $3 million for the next three seasons. He's worth a future first-round pick for sure. Jae'Sean Tate works on the money. Could be interesting.</p>\n<h2>10. <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nba/players/2938080/anfernee-simons/\">Anfernee Simons</a></h2><p>Boston took on Simons because he's on an expiring deal whereas Holiday is due three more years, which is to say they probably aren't tied all that tightly to him beyond giving him something of a free season as a tryout for inclusion in their future. He's set to make $27.6 million this season. VanVleet basically makes the money work. Houston can afford to throw in a draft pick and get a damn good offensive player without compromising any defensive parts. </p>\n            </div>"

These are just a fraction of our best bets, which are all free on our <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/betting/news/cfb-nfl-college-football-week-1-mlb-best-home-run-bets-baseball-picks-golf-bets-inside-the-lines-august-25/live/\" target=\"_blank\">new blog</a>. </p><p>We will be providing our team's personal best bets for every <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://cbssports.com/nfl/\">NFL</a> game during the 2025 season. <strong>We are coming off of a 23-13 +7.5 unit Week 3 in the NFL.</strong></p><p>Here are our picks for Monday Night Football, New York Jets at Miami Dolphins.</p><h3>Miami Dolphins -2.5 (-120 Fanatics)</h3><p>It's worth it to me to pay -120 for -2.5 over -107 to cover -3. In sims, our projected score for the Jets is identical to their odds implied total of just over 21 points. The key for Miami to cover is their scoring 24+ points.</p><p>The lookahead line had Miami -5.5 and an implied team total over 25 points. That's a high opinion that oddsmakers had for the Dolphins considering most thought the Jets were an elite defense. Miami's offense has had good moments after the Colts debacle. They had 315 passing yards vs New England and averaged 5.2 yards per carry for 130 yards versus the Bills. They would have put up 27+ in back-to-back weeks if not for Tua's back breaking, puzzling interceptions.</p>\n<p>Tua's early INTs per game is up around 80% versus his career, which is unsustainably high. He is due for a clean game. The Dolphins should also be able to run the ball with combo of speed (Achane) and power (rookie Ollie Gordon) vs a Jets defense that is mediocre in yards per carry allowed (4.1), but ends up allowing a high 121 yards per game last season and 133 currently this season. </p><p>Miami's offense, if they avoid a horrific INT, has actually looked good for a couple weeks and the Jets' big named, high priced defense has not allowing 34, 30 and 29 points.</p><h3>Tua Tagovailoa Over 1.5 Passing Touchdowns (-135 BetMGM)</h3><p>Our 1.84 projected passing TDs would translate to a line closer to -160, so it's not a great value, but it is a solid lean and is correlated to our Miami ATS pick.  The Jets pass defense has allowed the 6th highest passer rating in the league this season. They spent a lot of money ($12 M avg annual salary) on Brandon Stephens who badly regressed especially in pass coverage for the Ravens from '23 to '24 and he's even worse based on PFF ranking so far with the Jets.</p><p>Stephens cannot stay with Tyreek Hill or Jaylen Waddle. If Darren Waller is able to make his Dolphins debut then that gives Tua another great receiving option which should make all of the difference in the world. Jonnu Smith had a monster year for the Dolphins last season and getting a replacement great receiving TE should make all the difference in the world.</p><h3>Props Cheat Sheet</h3><p>The table below was updated on 9/24 at around 10 am EST so the lines may not match what you see above. If you're not feeling the picks above these are the ones that have projection value vs the best line / price. The projected value is in [brackets] and the sportsbook with the best line is in (parantheses). The cover rate since the start of 2024 and the current season are displayed. Many lines have not posted yet so the current list of picks is pretty thin. Check back later in the week for a full update.</p><div><p>RUNNING BACKS <br />De`Von Achane [0.83] Yes Anytime TD -115, 53.5% (MGM)   | Last 20: 12-8 | CS: 2-1 <br />Ollie Gordon [0.47] Yes Anytime TD +295, 25.3% (FD)   | Last 3: 1-2 | CS: 1-2 </p><p> RECEIVERS <br />Nick Westbrook [0.16] Yes Anytime TD +700, 12.5% (MGM)   | Last 15: 8-7 | CS: 0-2</p></div><h3>What makes a bet an \"Inside the Lines Best Bet?\" </h3><p>These are ones where:</p><p>1) <strong>Best Projection: </strong>Our SportsLine Model's projection shows clear value versus the line <em>and </em>we love certain statistical trends, X's and O's and subjective supporting data that supports our side but isn't directly factored into the model. For example, say we love a running back to go Over 14.5 carries and his backup is projected for 5.5 carries, but the backup is questionable and there's a chance he can be ruled out, which surely will change our projection to 16.5 (third-stringer gets 3.5) and the line would likely go from 12.5 to 15.5. If we have value on a side and the only unknown factors that will change are in our favor, we'll consider it our \"Best Projection.\"</p><p>AND</p><p>2) <strong>Best Price: </strong>There is an outlier best price that we should take advantage of before it steams in \"our direction.\" In most of these cases, the best-priced book is using \"standard odds making logic\" to set the line, but our team has identified a unique situation where standard odds rules don't apply. For example, maybe a player is -110 to throw an interception, but in his last three seasons he has averaged just 0.4 interceptions on the road compared to 0.7 at home because the team plays on a fast track at home and averages 5+ more pass attempts at home.</p><p><em><strong>Step 1 provides greater accuracy and Step 2, especially when combined with a nice Profit Boost or Promotion, significantly lowers the bar for being profitable ... which is why we like to feature our best line <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/betting/news/best-betting-apps/\">sportsbooks</a> offer. </strong></em></p>\n            </div>"

Once a perennial doormat in the CAA, Rhode Island has become a consistent contender under Fleming.</p><p>Monmouth, meanwhile, boasts the best offense in the FCS and, in my opinion, the top quarterback in <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/players/3163015/derek-robertson/\">Derek Robertson</a>. Last week, the Hawks rolled past ranked <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/teams/NOVA/villanova-wildcats/\">Villanova</a> 51-33, perfect inside the red zone and racking up more than 630 total yards. Robertson completed 20 of 30 passes for 397 yards and four touchdowns, spreading the ball to 10 different receivers. With a high-powered attack like this, a deep postseason run seems entirely plausible. Offensive coordinator Jeff Gallo may also attract significant head coaching interest soon.</p>\n<p><strong>Biggest rise:</strong> Monmouth | Last week: No. 24<br /> <strong>Biggest fall:</strong> <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/teams/SCST/south-carolina-state-bulldogs/\">South Carolina State</a> | Last week: No. 23</p><a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/news/bottom-25-college-football-rankings-unc-reenters-as-clemson-florida-slip-further-amid-dreadful-starts/\" target=\"_blank\">\n        <div>\n            <div>\n                <p>Bottom 25 college football rankings: UNC reenters as Clemson, Florida slip further amid dreadful starts</p>\n                <p>\n                    David Cobb                </p>\n            </div>\n                            <div>\n    <figure><img alt=\"Bottom 25 college football rankings: UNC reenters as Clemson, Florida slip further amid dreadful starts\" src=\"https://sportshub.cbsistatic.com/i/r/2025/09/23/89a4a55a-1d30-445a-9d71-319d878b42eb/thumbnail/270x152/27cfb4fcadc15062368ed2eb793a5703/belichick.jpg\" /></figure>\n                </div>\n                    </div>\n    </a>\n<h2>FCS Top 25, Week 5</h2><ol><li><p><strong><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/teams/NDST/north-dakota-state-bison/\">North Dakota State</a> (3-0):</strong> The Bison host <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/teams/SD/south-dakota-coyotes/\">South Dakota</a>, who have been a thorn in their side the past couple of seasons.</p></li><li><p><strong>South Dakota State (3-0):</strong> This Jackrabbits squad is finding ways to win with grit, led by star tailback <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/players/26716784/julius-loughridge/\">Julius Loughridge</a>.</p></li><li><p><strong><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/teams/MT/montana-grizzlies/\">Montana</a> (3-0):</strong> QB <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/players/29136677/kealii-ah-yat/\">Keali'i Ah Yat</a> threw for 313 yards and two touchdowns in a 63-20 rout of <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/teams/INST/indiana-state-sycamores/\">Indiana State</a>.

    "body": "<div>\n        <p>The peak time for players in contract years to get new deals is typically from the beginning of July until the early part of September when the regular season begins. A flurry of such veteran signings took place during this period:</p><ul><li>The most notable signing was <strong><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/2967590/micah-parsons/\">Micah Parsons</a></strong>. The edge rusher market was massively reset with the four-year, $186 million contract extension averaging $46.5 million per year Parsons received from the Green Bay Packers in connection with his trade from the Dallas Cowboys several days before the regular season opener. His $136.007 million in overall guarantees and $123.107 million fully guaranteed at signing are non-quarterback records.</li><li>Parsons easily eclipsed the three-year, $123 million extension averaging $41 million edge rusher <strong><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/2071793/t-j-watt/\">T.J. Watt</a></strong> signed with the Pittsburgh Steelers in July to briefly become the NFL's highest-paid non-quarterback.</li><li><strong><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/2835704/rashawn-slater/\">Rashawn Slater</a></strong> marginally reset the offensive tackle market at the start of training camp in July from the $28.125 million per year Tristan Wirfs received from the Tampa Bay Buccaneers in 2024 to $28.25 million per year. His four-year, $113 million extension with the Los Angeles Chargers has an offensive lineman record $92 million in guarantees.</li><li><strong><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/2139279/terry-mclaurins/\">Terry McLaurin's</a></strong> hold-in with the Washington Commanders ended during the latter part of August. He signed a three-year, $87 million extension averaging $29 million per year with $50 million in guarantees, of which $44.65 million was fully guaranteed at signing. The deal is worth as much as $96.4 million thanks to $9.4 million in incentives and salary escalators.</li></ul><p>Ten players in a contract year are being highlighted after multiple players who would have been highly sought after in 2026 free agency, if not franchise tag recipients, were taken off the market with new deals.</p>\n<p>The <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/CIN/cincinnati-bengals/\">Bengals</a> and <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/2818165/trey-hendrickson/\">Trey Hendrickson</a> couldn't reach an agreement on a contract extension to ensure he would remain in Cincinnati beyond this season. Instead, he received an adjustment to his 2025 salary as a compromise to end his hold-in as the regular season approached.</p><p>The 2024 <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://cbssports.com/nfl/\">NFL</a> sack leader got a $13 million raise to increase his 2025 compensation from $16 million to $29 million. There's an additional $1 million for Hendrickson playing 60% or more of the defensive snaps with the Bengals making the playoffs.</p>\n<p>Hendrickson's 2025 salary cap number increased by $6.5 million to $25,166,668 because a 2026 contract year automatically voiding five days after <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://cbssports.com/nfl/superbowl/\">Super Bowl</a> LX on Feb. 13 was added in the process, so the new $13 million is being prorated.</p><p>A franchise tag in 2026 is a realistic possibility. Given the way the 120% of the prior year's salary provisions operate for franchise tags, it will cost the Bengals $30.2 million to use the designation on Hendrickson.</p>\n<p><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/1824909/mike-evans/\">Mike Evans</a> holds the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://cbssports.com/nfl/\">NFL</a> record with 11 straight 1,000-yard receiving seasons to start a career. A 12th 1,000-yard receiving season, which would break a tie with Jerry Rice for the most ever, is in jeopardy after a left hamstring strain. According to reports, Evans is expected to miss three to four weeks.</p>\n<p>Evans will return to a more crowded wide receiver corps when he is healthy. <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/2818150/chris-godwin/\">Chris Godwin</a>, who signed a three-year, $66 million contract worth a maximum of $72 million through incentives in March, should be recovered from the dislocated left ankle that sidelined him seven games into the 2024 season.</p><p>It will be interesting to see how the Buccaneers handle Evans' contract situation considering Godwin's deal and <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/26696165/emeka-egbuka/\">Emeka Egbuka</a> quickly becoming a leading candidate for NFL Offensive Rookie of the Year. Evans is in the final year of his two-year, $41 million deal averaging $20.5 million per year. Incentives and salary escalators increased the maximum value to $52 million. </p><p>Presumably, Evans will want comparable money, especially if he keeps his 1,000-yard receiving streak intact -- although he will turn 33 years old before the 2026 regular season starts.</p>\n<p>The <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/IND/indianapolis-colts/\">Colts</a>, who were 8-9 in 2024, may have made the playoffs last season with more consistent quarterback play. <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/2179245/daniel-jones/\">Daniel Jones</a> was signed to a one-year, $14 million contract worth up to $17 million through incentives in March to push 2023 fourth overall pick <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/3163263/anthony-richardson/\">Anthony Richardson</a>.</p><p>The early-season results have validated the decision to start Jones over Richardson. Jones aims to have a surprising career resurrection as a high first-round quarterback on a one-year contract like <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/2180320/sam-darnold/\">Sam Darnold</a> and <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/2080032/baker-mayfield/\">Baker Mayfield</a> have in recent years. (Both Darnold and Mayfield signed three-year contracts between $33 million and $33.5 million per year with an additional $15 million in incentives.)</p><p>If it happens, the Colts could have quarterback stability for the first time since Andrew Luck abruptly retired in 2019.</p>\n<a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/news/are-the-colts-a-mirage-or-can-their-magical-2025-run-continue-forecasting-daniel-jones-next-steps-in-indy/\" target=\"_blank\">\n        <div>\n            <div>\n                <p>Are the Colts a mirage or can their magical 2025 run continue?

According to <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/BAL/baltimore-ravens/\">Ravens</a> general manager Eric DeCosta, the intention is to retain Linderbaum long term.</p><p>Linderbaum's option-year salary was $23.402 million, which is the 2025 franchise tag for offensive linemen, because he was named to the Pro Bowl on the original ballot in each of the past two seasons (2023 and 2024). This amount doesn't reflect the center market. Since there aren't specific option-year salaries for center, guard and tackle, the cost is the same regardless of position. The NFL's highest-paid center is <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/2804136/creed-humphrey/\">Creed Humphrey</a> with the four-year, $72 million extension averaging $18 million per year he received from the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/KC/kansas-city-chiefs/\">Kansas City Chiefs</a> during the 2024 preseason.</p><p>The Ravens surely won't prevent Linderbaum from hitting the open market in 2026 with a franchise tag considering the decision about his option year. As long as Linderbaum doesn't regress significantly, he should be in a good position to reset the center market next offseason -- either staying in Baltimore or as an unrestricted free agent. Linderbaum becoming the NFL's first $20-million-per-year center isn't out of the question.</p>\n<p><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/2964514/kyle-pitts/\">Kyle Pitts</a> initially justified being the highest-drafted tight end ever (fourth overall pick in the 2021 <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://cbssports.com/nfl/draft/\">NFL Draft</a>.) He had 68 receptions for 1,026 yards in a Pro Bowl season as a rookie. Since then, Pitts hasn't come close to living up to his draft position. Pitts didn't reach 55 catches or 700 receiving yards in any of his next three seasons. The <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/ATL/atlanta-falcons/\">Falcons</a> were reportedly open to trading Pitts, who is playing under a $10.878 million fifth-year option, during the offseason but weren't aggressively shopping him.</p>\n<p>Talent wasn't why the Steelers had reservations about giving <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/3123212/george-pickens/\">George Pickens</a> a new deal. It was because of his attitude and immaturity.</p><p>Statistically, Pickens fit the profile of a player a team should want to sign long term before the expiration of his rookie contract. Pickens averaged 58 receptions, 947 receiving yards and four touchdowns during his first three NFL seasons. He led the NFL with 18.1 yards per catch in 2023 when he had his only 1,000-receiving-yard season with 1,140 yards.</p>\n<p>Pickens' days in Pittsburgh seemed numbered once the equivalent of a second-round pick was dealt to the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/SEA/seattle-seahawks/\">Seattle Seahawks</a> for wide receiver <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/2260185/dk-metcalf/\">DK Metcalf</a> in March. Metcalf received a four-year contract extension averaging nearly $33 million per year in conjunction with the trade where $60 million was fully guaranteed at signing. The Metcalf acquisition led to Pickens and a 2027 sixth-round pick being traded to the Cowboys for a 2026 third-round pick and a 2027 fifth-round pick in May.</p><p><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/2865251/ceedee-lamb/\">CeeDee Lamb</a> and Pickens should form the best wide receiver duo the Cowboys have had since the 2020 and 2021 seasons when Lamb paired with <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/1984220/amari-cooper/\">Amari Cooper</a>. If all goes well and Pickens is on his best behavior, he could be in line for a multi-year contract with Dallas or in free agency in excess of $25 million per year. As a reference point, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/3125968/jameson-williams/\">Jameson Williams</a> signed a three-year, $80 million extension averaging $26,666,667 per year to be the No. 2 wide receiver for the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/DET/detroit-lions/\">Detroit Lions</a> right before the regular season started. </p><p>An inability by Pickens to learn from his Pittsburgh experience could mean a one-year \"prove-it\" deal in 2026.</p>\n<p><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/2132551/dallas-goedert/\">Dallas Goedert</a>'s availability, not ability, has become an issue for the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/PHI/philadelphia-eagles/\">Eagles</a>. He had missed 17 games after signing a four-year, $57 million extension averaging $14.25 million per year in 2021 heading into this season. He had his worst production last season since he was a rookie in 2018 by catching 42 passes for 496 yards with two touchdowns in 10 games.</p><p>A few days after the 2025 <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://cbssports.com/nfl/draft/\">NFL Draft</a>, Goedert took a $4.25 million pay cut to $10 million in order to remain in Philadelphia for the final year of his contract. The Eagles will have $23,693,640 of dead money if Goedert, who is 30, hits the open market in 2026. It remains to be seen whether a new deal will be worked out before Goedert's 2026 through 2029 contract years void Feb. 16 with a relatively healthy 2025 season.</p><p>The injury bug has already bitten Goedert this season. He missed Week 2's contest against the Chiefs with a knee injury.</p>\n<p><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/2864940/tariq-woolen/\">Tariq Woolen</a> tied for the NFL lead with six interceptions and earned Pro Bowl honors as a rookie, but the 2022 fifth-round pick has been plagued by inconsistency since. Woolen's rare size (6-foot-4 and 210 pounds) and speed (4.26 seconds in the 40-yard dash) for a cornerback should make him an intriguing option in 2026 free agency, especially if he can overcome his early-season struggles.</p>\n<p>New <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/NYJ/new-york-jets/\">Jets</a> head coach Aaron Glenn quickly declaring his intention to go with a running back-by-committee approach suggested <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/3123469/breece-hall/\">Breece Hall</a> wouldn't be a contract extension candidate. He didn't express any frustration over the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/BUF/buffalo-bills/\">Buffalo Bills</a> and <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/LAR/los-angeles-rams/\">Los Angeles Rams</a>, respectively, giving fellow running backs from the 2022 draft class -- <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/2975698/james-cook/\">James Cook</a> and <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/3121836/kyren-williams/\">Kyren Williams</a> -- new deals during the preseason.</p><p>Hall acknowledged those two have been more productive but also have been in better situations. Cook's four-year, $46 million extension worth up to $48 million with salary escalators came several days after Williams signed a three-year, $33 million extension. In order to get in the same salary stratosphere as Cook and Williams, Hall will need to make the most of his opportunities this season as a dual-threat running back.</p>\n<p><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/2806235/jaelan-phillips/\">Jaelan Phillips</a> was emerging as one of the league's better young edge rushers when he tore his right Achilles during the 2023 season. He had 6.5 sacks in the eight games he had played in 2023. Phillips had another injury setback in 2024, tearing his right ACL four games into the season.</p><p>Phillips recovered in time for the regular season opener. The 2021 first-round pick will need to regain the form he was displaying in 2023 while consistently staying in the lineup. Otherwise, Phillips is likely destined for a one-year deal in 2026 for less than the current $13.251 million fifth-year option.</p><h3>Other players to watch</h3><ul><li><strong>Ravens:</strong> TE <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/2131121/mark-andrews/\">Mark Andrews</a>, DT <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/2961384/travis-jones/\">Travis Jones</a>, TE <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/2961906/isaiah-likely/\">Isaiah Likely</a></li><li><strong><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/CLE/cleveland-browns/\">Browns</a>:</strong> CB <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/2966771/greg-newsome-ii/\">Greg Newsome II</a>, OG <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/2071639/wyatt-teller/\">Wyatt Teller</a></li><li><strong>Bills: </strong>EDGE <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/2060764/joey-bosa/\">Joey Bosa</a></li><li><strong>Buccaneers:</strong> EDGE <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/2001828/haason-reddick/\">Haason Reddick</a></li><li><strong>Chiefs: </strong>CB <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/3176898/jaylen-watson/\">Jaylen Watson</a></li><li><strong>Colts:</strong> OT <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/2139804/braden-smith/\">Braden Smith</a></li><li><strong>Commanders: </strong>WR <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/2139735/deebo-samuel/\">Deebo Samuel</a></li><li><strong><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/LV/las-vegas-raiders/\">Raiders</a>:</strong> WR <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/2183835/jakobi-meyers/\">Jakobi Meyers</a></li><li><strong>Seahawks:</strong> RB <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/3121372/kenneth-walker-iii/\">Kenneth Walker III</a></li></ul>\n            </div>"

    "body": "<div>\n        <p>In the weeks after <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/players/29754995/trinidad-chambliss/\">Trinidad Chambliss</a> led Ferris State to a 14-1 season and a Division-II national championship, his quarterback trainer, Steve Calhoun, pitched Chambliss on an idea.</p><p>\"I said, 'I think you've accomplished everything you need to accomplish at that level,\" Calhoun, who works with <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://cbssports.com/nfl/\">NFL</a> quarterbacks like <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/players/26694052/jordan-love/\">Jordan Love</a>, said. 'I would love to see your skillset at a higher level.'</p><p>\"I truly believed he could play at a higher level.\"</p><p>Chambliss wasn't so sure. He thought he could do it. But leaving a good thing at Ferris State seemed like a risk. So, Calhoun offered to ask around.</p><p>It went well.</p><p>A few months later, Chambliss is half of an intriguing quarterback puzzle for <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/teams/MISS/ole-miss-rebels/\">Ole Miss</a> ahead of a Top 25 showdown with <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/teams/LSU/lsu-tigers/\">LSU</a> (2:30 p.m., ABC). Chambliss began the season as <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/players/29159005/austin-simmons/\">Austin Simmons</a>' backup. When Simmons suffered an ankle injury in a Week 2 win over <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/teams/UK/kentucky-wildcats/\">Kentucky</a>, Chambliss was forced into the lineup as the team's starter. Sources told CBS Sports the expectation is that Chambliss will get the start when the Rebels take on the Tigers. </p>\n<p>Chambliss led the Rebels to wins over <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/teams/ARK/arkansas-razorbacks/\">Arkansas</a> and <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/teams/TULANE/tulane-green-wave/\">Tulane</a> in Simmons' absence, emerging as one of the most dangerous dual-threat quarterbacks in the country. He threw for 660 yards and three touchdowns in those games to go along with 174 yards and two scores on the ground. The Rebels are averaging 43 points a game with him as the starter, and he ranks seventh nationally in ESPN's QBR metric.</p><p>It's production that's even taken those around Ole Miss by surprise. The Rebels thought they landed a high-level SEC backup when they nabbed Chambliss out of the portal. Instead, there may be a QB controversy brewing in Oxford even with Rebels head coach Lane Kiffin saying this week that Simmons \"at 100% was our starting quarterback.\" </p><p>Perhaps emphasis on the \"was.\"</p><p>\"We didn't know what he'd turn out to be,\" an Ole Miss source said of Chambliss. \"Obviously, we thought he was good when we took him. But to say what he is now is what we thought he'd be when we took him would be incorrect.\"</p>\n<p>Incorrect and vexing to the team that would likely have landed him if not for Ole Miss' last-minute push for Chambliss – the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/teams/TEMPLE/temple-owls/\">Temple Owls</a>.</p>\n<h2>A Temple cornerstone</h2><p>When Calhoun offered to ask around about Chambliss' prospects of playing on a higher level, he figured it'd be easy. Tape is tape, after all, and Chambliss' skillset was obvious after he threw for 2,925 yards with a five-to-one touchdown to interception ratio and ran for 1,019 yards on six yards per carry.</p><p>One problem – teams couldn't always find the tape.</p><p>\"They were like, 'Yeah, I've got to download ESPN+,\" Calhoun said. \"You can't find it on YouTube. But once they saw it, it popped.\"</p>\n<p>Calhoun presented Chambliss and his family the feedback, and Chambliss decided to test the transfer waters on April 10. Once he officially popped up in the portal, Calhoun remembers getting bombarded with calls from area codes he didn't recognize.</p><p><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/teams/NMEX/new-mexico-lobos/\">New Mexico</a>, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/teams/UTAH/utah-utes/\">Utah</a>, Temple, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/teams/WKY/western-kentucky-hilltoppers/\">Western Kentucky</a> and a few others were among the early movers. Some bigger programs were circling, too. <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/teams/OHIOST/ohio-state-buckeyes/\">Ohio State</a> and <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/teams/MINN/minnesota-golden-gophers/\">Minnesota</a> inquired but both programs were recruiting Chambliss as a backup. It's why the Buckeyes backed off.</p><p>\"We were in the market for a backup,\" an Ohio State source said. \"We didn't really see him as that. We figured he was coming from D-II to play football.\"</p>\n<p>No program was more all-in on Chambliss than Temple.</p><p>The Owls, as part of their usual scouting process, evaluate a lot of potential portal players. Chambliss was among them, and he leapt off the screen. Said one Temple source of what they remember watching on film with Chambliss: \"He would be a game changer. We were all in.\"</p><p>Chambliss entered the portal on Thursday, April 10. The Owls offered within minutes of his name showing up in the database. They booked Chambliss and his family flights for a Monday official visit, two days after Ferris State's national championship parade.</p><p>The Owls felt good. They allotted $300,000 for Chambliss, a monumental sum for a Group of Six starting quarterback. Chambliss was going to be the foundational piece of K.C. Keeler's Temple rebuild, a perfect fit for new offensive coordinator Tyler Walker's run-heavy QB scheme.</p>\n<p>But that's the thing about the portal: nothing is done until it's done.</p><h2>A late suitor </h2><p>Ole Miss had a horrible time trying to find a backup in the transfer market. They swung and missed on several experienced arms because most could see what was obvious -- Simmons was going to be QB1 in 2025.</p><p>Then Ole Miss saw Chambliss go into the portal. It was just a headline then -- Division II national champion QB enters. But good scouting departments watch everyone. And, as another source described it to CBS, \"It was a, 'Oh, I wasn't familiar with your game' moment.'</p><p>Temple had the visit scheduled for Monday, so the Rebels convinced Chambliss to visit Saturday in the hours after the parade. The Owls found out when an Ole Miss staffer called them to help set up a flight change for Chambliss and his family as the flight to Philadelphia would now come from Mississippi.</p>\n<p>It never got to that point.</p><p>Temple got a call from Chambliss on Sunday. He'd committed to the Rebels.</p><p>Ole Miss' contract offer was at least double Temple's, per a source, as the going rate for a quality Power Four backup quarterback is $500,000-plus. There was an awareness in Chambliss' camp that Simmons had the inside position for the starting job. But the Rebels sold Chambliss on the opportunity to compete.</p><p>\"The family believed and loved what they heard,\" Calhoun said. \"To play in the SEC, play for Coach Kiffin and (offensive coordinator Charlie) Weis, two innovative offensive minds that fit Trinidad's skillset, it was pretty much a no-brainer.\"</p><p>It was pretty much heartbreak for Temple.</p><p>The Owls were ready to give Chambliss the presidential treatment on campus. They'd recorded videos with Joe Flacco and ESPN's Kevin Negandhi to welcome him. It was all for naught.</p>\n<p>\"We knew what he was,\" the Temple source said. \"He was going to completely change our program. Ole Miss just sniped us.\"</p><h2><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/betting/\">Betting</a> on himself </h2><p>Calhoun has worked with first-round draft picks like Love and mid-round success stories like Russell Wilson and Nick Foles. But he's never had a quarterback go from the D-II level to potential NFL prospect like Chambliss.</p><p>Division II to FBS success stories do happen. Austin Reed went from D-II West <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/teams/FLA/florida-gators/\">Florida</a> to the nation's leading passer during the 2022 season with Western Kentucky. But you almost never see a D-II player jump up to the Power Four level with the confidence to battle with someone like Simmons, who'd long been considered Jaxson Dart's heir apparent in Oxford.</p>\n<p>But Chambliss bet on himself.</p><p>Now, the senior could make things very difficult on Kiffin once Simmons is 100%. It's a question many in <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://cbssports.com/college-football/\">college football</a> are asking this week: can you really bench someone playing as well as Chambliss?</p><p>We'll find out soon once Simmons is 100% healthy. Yet Chambliss' story might not be done even if he goes back to the bench. </p><p>Yes, he's a senior. But Chabmliss only played in two games as a freshman in 2022. Division II football didn't establish a redshirt rule until this year, so Chambliss doesn't technically have another year to use. He can, however, submit a waiver request to the NCAA for another season. Or, as Calhoun joked, he could just hire <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/players/28873851/diego-pavia/\">Diego Pavia</a> as his lawyer.</p>\n<p>Either way, Chambliss bet big on himself going from Ferris State to the SEC. </p><p>It's paying off.</p><p>\"He really believes in his skill set and him as a player and a quarterback,\" Calhoun said. \"He feels he is one of the best quarterbacks in the country. If you're not thinking that way, then something's wrong.\"</p>\n            </div>"

Not only is Brady a color commentator for Fox, but he's also a minority owner of the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/LV/las-vegas-raiders/\">Las Vegas Raiders</a>, which gives him a certain level of access to coaches, players and information. In his role as a Raiders minority owner, Brady wants to see the team succeed and can influence decisions. He was most notably in the Raiders' coaches booth wearing a headset during the Week 2 matchup against the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/LAC/los-angeles-chargers/\">Los Angeles Chargers</a>.</p><p>It has already been established that Brady speaks with Raiders coach Pete Carroll and offensive coordinator Chip Kelly. Even former Raiders coach Antonio Pierce said <span><a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/news/antonio-pierce-says-tom-bradys-unprecedented-role-was-great-asset-for-raiders-in-2024/\" target=\"_blank\">Brady was an asset during their time together</a></span>. In his <a href=\"https://tombrady.com/posts/do-your-job\" target=\"_blank\">weekly newsletter</a>, Brady addressed the speculation around his two gigs and defended himself by saying there's no \"point of conflict,\" unless you're just \"paranoid and distrustful.\"</p><p>\"I love football. At its core it is a game of principles,\" Brady wrote. \"And with all the success it has given me, I feel I have a moral and ethical duty to the sport; which is why the point where my roles in it intersect is not actually a point of conflict, despite what the paranoid and distrustful might believe. Rather, it's the place from which my ethical duty emerges: to grow, evolve, and improve the game that has given me everything.\"</p><p>As a broadcaster, Brady said he wants viewers to feel like \"they got their money's worth,\" and like every broadcaster, he wants to \"entertain and inform.\" As a minority owner, Brady said he wants to see the Raiders return to \"glory.\" He wants the team to have talented, coachable players that \"know how to do their jobs in pursuit of team success.\"</p><p>No problem here, Brady said, unless you're \"blinded by distrust.\"</p>\n<p>\"When you live through uncertain and untrusting times like we are today, it is very easy to watch a person's passions and profession intersect, and to believe you're looking at some sort of dilemma,\" Brady wrote. \"Because when you're blinded by distrust, it's hard to see anything other than self-interest.\"</p><p>Despite Brady's explanation, not everyone is going to be convinced this is a fair situation. If Brady is better at one thing than quarterbacking, it's competing. Now that he has a vested interest in seeing the Raiders succeed, how involved will he be? </p><p>Is it possible Brady is just simply giving back to the game in two different ways at the same time? Or is it fair to be on guard against someone in these positions?</p>\n<p>\"People who are like that, particularly to a chronic, pathological degree, are telling on themselves,\" Brady wrote. \"They're showing you their worldview and how they operate. They're admitting that they can only conceive of interests that are selfish; that they cannot imagine a person doing their job for reasons that are greater than themselves.\"</p>\n            </div>"
