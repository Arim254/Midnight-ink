    "body": "<div>\n        <p><span>MILAN --</span> This past August, Bluenergy Stadium, the home stadium of Udinese, hosted the 2025 UEFA Super Cup between PSG and Tottenham, an event that underlined once again how Udinese are working on and off the pitch to grow. Over the years, the Italian team established themselves as one of the most innovative around the country and abroad. Their own stadium, formerly called Stadio Friuli, set an example for the other big Italian teams through their stadium ownership (not owned by the city as most teams) and sustainability with solar panels, especially these days as both Inter and AC Milan will soon know the future of their historical San Siro, as the Milan's <a href=\"https://en.ilsole24ore.com/art/vendita-san-siro-critiche-comitato-la-legalita-rischi-speculativi-AHKtOmoC\" target=\"_blank\">city council</a> will finally vote to renovate it. </p><p>The Pozzo family, who have owned Udinese since 1986, are now working to change the culture of their team and continue their growth, making it more international off the pitch with sustainability, fashion and academies abroad. This week, the club unveiled their new third kit in Milan during the Fashion Week in, partnering with Italian designer Domenico Orefice. </p><p>CBS Sports sat down with Magda Pozzo, Udinese's Strategic Marketing Coordinator, who explained why Udinese wanted to unveil the new kit in Milan during Fashion Week.</p><p>\"For us, this has certainly become a very important moment because Milan Fashion Week represents the highest level of fashion. So, with the partnership we established three years ago, it represents a great opportunity for us. Linking this project with a new emerging designer, giving visibility to his talent through football, is very positive for us. There's always a different storytelling, and that's the beautiful part,\" Pozzo said. \"Last year, it was more focused on sustainability, and this year we took a step further: combining the modernity of the designer and fashion with the concept of territory. Domenico did a great job. He created a strong connection with our region and our territory, adding this touch of modernity.\"</p>\n<figure><p><img alt=\"udine3.jpg\" src=\"https://sportshub.cbsistatic.com/i/r/2025/09/28/56c25605-d0c8-47d7-b2e4-11315ab3180f/resize/670x377/70a83b644215aec23bfe27eb3b0f7b6e/udine3.jpg\" /></p><figcaption><span>\n                                                                    Getty Images\n                                                            </span></figcaption></figure><p>The 28-year-old, known for his \"hybrid sportswear style that blends tailoring, culture, and experimentation,\" founded his own brand at 17, creating leather goods and managing every stage of production. Udinese wanted him to become their designer for the new kit, showing how the club are working closely with young designers. The shirt itself is a distinctive golden-yellow shade and displays, both front and back in a stylized form, the eagle – one of Udine and Friuli's most important historical symbols, deeply rooted in medieval history and the Friulian cultural identity, also echoed on the inside collar. </p><p>\"On the right chest, one above the other, stand out the Macron Hero and Domenico Orefice's logo, an interlacing of his initials that conveys movement,\" the club said. \"On the left side is the Udinese Calcio crest. The back neck is customized with a label matching the jersey's color and graphics, featuring the Udinese Calcio and Domenico Orefice logos, the wording <em>\"I PRIMI BIANCONERI D'ITALIA\"</em>, the Macron logo and the claim '<em>Designed in Bologna,' c</em>ertifying that each garment is conceived, designed and developed at the Macron Campus in Valsamoggia.\"</p><h2>Being sustainable and expanding</h2><p>Pozzo, together with the board, is working to make Udinese sustainable in all aspects of the club. In March 2025, Udinese officially presented the new solar park, the photovoltaic power system located on the roof of the stadium owned by the club, is a cutting-edge construction featuring 2,409 latest-generation solar panels capable of producing an average of about 3,000 kWh/day, designed with the support of the Polytechnic University of Milan.</p>\n<p>\"Our solar park is our flagship project in terms of sustainability, one of the few of its kind in Europe, and we will be fully powered by solar energy on match days. It's a major achievement. On top of that, we have also created an energy community, and what's important is that we didn't stop there: all extra energy produced will be donated to the community, and the revenue generated will be used for charitable purposes, particularly for hospitals. We are pursuing several projects because we want to be concrete when we talk about sustainability,\" Pozzo told CBS Sports. </p><figure><p><img alt=\"udi1.jpg\" src=\"https://sportshub.cbsistatic.com/i/r/2025/09/28/852c7f58-d044-4798-9867-1ea1bd63135d/resize/670x377/f9b44e7a6922d6c9199d9f647a952a1d/udi1.jpg\" /></p><figcaption><span>\n                                                                    Stefano Trovati/Udinese\n                                                            </span></figcaption></figure><p>The club are also hoping to make a big impact in the United States, aiming to develop academies in the country as a way to further expand their brand, but also be more in touch with the American player pool with numerous players now in Italy, such as Milan's Christian Pulisic and Juventus' Weston McKennie. </p><p>\"We are also working on expanding our academies, especially in the United States and the Middle East. This is a longer-term process. One of our goals is to internationalize our brand while maintaining strong local roots and a deep sense of belonging. While we remain mindful of tradition, at the same time, we are strongly pushing innovation. It starts with scouting and then we apply it, as we say, off the pitch, in many other areas as well. For our partners too, this drive toward innovation and globalization is very important, so that thanks to these events Udinese can become an iconic club for innovation while also becoming increasingly international, even though we are a provincial team.\"</p>\n            </div>"

After six lackluster years with the Giants, Jones is averaging 9.3 yards per pass attempt and has accounted for 871 total yards and six total touchdowns while leading Indianapolis to a 3-0 start. Meanwhile, the Rams are coming off a collapse last week against the Eagles and have a divisional game (49ers) looming on Thurdsay. <strong>The model says the Colts win in 44% of simulations, but the odds imply a 38.9% win probability.</strong></p><p>Bears +1.5 vs. Raiders</p><p>It was mostly doom and gloom in Chicago after the Bears blew a double-digit fourth-quarter lead against the Vikings in Week 1 and then got blown out 52-21 by the Lions in Week 2. However, Caleb Williams turned in an NFC Offensive Player of the Week-winning performance in a 31-14 win over the Cowboys last week and suddenly things are looking up again. Meanwhile, the early trend has been the opposite for Las Vegas, which looked dynamic offensively in Week 1 but stalled out in back-to-back double-digit losses. <strong>Chicago covers the spread in 57% of the model's simulations</strong>.</p><p>Over 46.5 points: Cowboys vs. Packers</p><p>A lot of attention will be on Micah Parsons here and he's a solid bet to have a major impact, but if you're playing the total you won't want to forget how bad the Cowboys have been since shipping the star edge rusher to Green Bay. Dallas couldn't stop the Philadelphia running game when it mattered in Week 1 and then gave up 68 points and 891 yards of total offense combined in Weeks 2 and 3 against the Giants and Bears. Meanwhile, the Packers defense has been great but the Cowboys offense has moved the ball effectively against everybody they've played so far. <strong>The model says this over hits 57% of the time</strong>.</p><h2>Want more NFL picks for Sunday, September 28?</h2><p><strong>You've seen some of the model's Sunday NFL best bets.

The Colts will take their undefeated record to Hollywood to take on the Los Angeles Rams at 4:05 p.m. ET.

It enters the final weeks of the 2025 MLB regular season a profitable 34-28 on top-rated MLB money-line picks. It has excelled making home run prop picks this season, returning more than 25 units of profit. For college football, the model is a profitable 35-22 combined on money-line and over/under college football picks since the beginning of 2024. Anybody following its <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/betting/news/mlb/\" target=\"_blank\">MLB betting</a> picks or <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/betting/news/college-football/\" target=\"_blank\">college football betting</a> picks at <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/betting/news/best-betting-apps/\" target=\"_blank\">sportsbooks</a> and on <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/betting/news/best-betting-apps/\" target=\"_blank\">betting sites</a> could have seen strong returns.</p><h2>Sunday best bets at DraftKings Sportsbook</h2><ul><li>Colts (+160) vs. Rams</li><li>Chiefs (+2.5) vs. Ravens</li><li>Packers -7 vs. Cowboys</li></ul><p>Combining the model's three picks into a Sunday parlay at DraftKings would result in a payout of +915 (risk $100 to win $915). <a href=\"https://martech.cbssports.com/bt/redirect/prod?b=draftkings&c=sport\" target=\"_blank\">Bet it at DraftKings here</a>:</p><h2>Colts (+160) to defeat the Rams</h2><p>The Colts were involved in 1-point spreads in each of the first two weeks of the season before defeating the Titans, 41-20, a 6-point favorites last week to improve to 3-0 on the season. The Colts have the No. 2 scoring offense at 34.3 points per game this season behind Daniel Jones at quarterback and Jonathan Taylor at running back. Taylor leads the NFL in rushing at 338 yards this season, including back-to-back 100-yard rushing weeks. Taylor rushed for 102 yards and three touchdowns against the Titans last week after posting 165 rushing yards and 50 receiving yards with a touchdown against the Broncos the week before. The Rams rank 13th in rushing yards allowed (103 yards per game), but a runner with Taylor's talent can make even a strong rushing defense seem inferior. The model projects the Colts to win in 44% of simulations, compared to the +160 odds giving Indianapolis an implied probability of 38.46% on Sunday.</p><h2>Chiefs (+2.5) vs. Ravens</h2><p>Patrick Mahomes is 4-1 over his career, including the playoffs, against Lamar Jackson, including winning their most recent battle in the 2024 NFL Kickoff Game. Kansas City isn't fully healthy and available, but the Chiefs are getting closer with the return of Xavier Worthy (shoulder) to provide Mahomes another playmaking weapon. The Chiefs have become a more balanced team, rather than winning due to high-flying offensive success, in recent seasons. Kansas City is tied for the ninth-best scoring defense (18.7 ppg allowed) this season, and the Chiefs have had a top-six scoring defense in each of the previous two seasons. There's no debating Jackson's greatness, but Andy Reid and his staff will have a game plan to try and frustrate him. Kansas City went 8-0 at home last season, and the model projects Kansas City to cover the spread in 51% of simulations.</p><h2>Packers (-7) vs. Cowboys</h2><p>The Packers were embarrassed last week in a 13-10 loss to the Browns as 7.5-point favorites. Although the Cowboys don't have the same long-lasting negative stigma as the Cleveland Browns, the odds indicate they are about similar talent levels currently, and the model expects a Packers performance closer to what we've seen over the first two weeks, rather than last week. The Packers opened with a 27-13 win over the Lions, followed by a 27-18 victory over the Commanders with a pair of two-score victories over postseason teams from last season. The Packers have the No. 1 scoring defense (14.7 ppg), and the Cowboys will be without CeeDee Lamb (ankle). The model projects Lamb's absence to hinder the Dallas offense, projecting the Packers to cover the spread in 56% of simulations. </p><h2>Want more NFL picks for Sunday?</h2><p><strong>You've seen the model's Sunday best bets.

Mariota led a running game that has been completely rebuilt out of necessity in the last month (Brian Robinson was traded and Austin Ekeler tore his Achilles) to over 200 yards in a 41-24 beatdown of the Raiders. Meanwhile, the Falcons were just embarrassed in a 30-0 loss to the Panthers at home and Michael Penix Jr. has struggled. <strong>The model predicts that the Commanders win in 66% of simulations</strong>.</p><ul><li><strong>Game: Los Angeles Rams vs. Indianapolis Colts (Sunday, 4:05 p.m. ET)</strong></li><li><strong>The Pick: <strong><strong>Over 49.5 points (+115)</strong></strong></strong></li></ul><p>\"These two haven't been playing dull games and don't expect that to change on Sunday in Inglewood. The Colts and new QB Daniel Jones have been a revelation in their 3-0 start, the offense in such a good groove that Rigiberto Sanchez has only had to punt once in the first three games,\" legendary football handicapper Bruce Marshall said. \"Indy is scoring at a 34 ppg clip and has gone \"over\" handily in its last two. Meanwhile the Rams can certainly give chase or even set the pace with Matthew Stafford at the controls and looking good as ever, though LA might want to do something about its kicking game after Joshua Karty had a pair of FGs blocked in the 4th Q at Philadelphia last week.\"</p><p><strong>More NFL best bets</strong></p><ul><li><a href=\"https://www.sportsline.com/nfl/picks/\" target=\"_blank\">Every NFL game simulated 10,000 times</a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.sportsline.com/nfl/picks/experts/?sc=\" target=\"_blank\">NFL expert picks</a> </li></ul><h2>Sunday MLB best bets</h2><ul><li><strong>Game: Seattle Mariners vs. Los Angeles Dodgers (Sunday, 3:10 p.m. ET)</strong></li><li><strong>The Pick: Mariners +1.5 (-194)</strong></li></ul><p>Neither team has anything of note to play for in this matchup with both teams having already clinched their respective divisions, so the model is riding the hot hand here. Seattle won 17 of its last 20 games to chase the Astros down in the AL West. The Mariners should also allow Bryce Miller pitch late into the game since he won't likely be a part of the team's playoff rotation while the Dodgers might be looking to feather Clayton Kershaw with big postseason starting decisions looming. <strong>The model has Seattle covering on the run line in 75% of simulations</strong>.</p><p><strong>More MLB best bets</strong></p><ul><li><a

Entering the season as two of the top <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://cbssports.com/nfl/superbowl/\">Super Bowl</a> contenders in the AFC, the Chiefs and Ravens both have begun with 1-2 record, with Kansas City already two games behind the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/LAC/los-angeles-chargers/\">Los Angeles Chargers</a> in the AFC West.</p><p>For Sunday's matchup between the Chiefs and Ravens, top <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/betting/news/best-betting-apps/\">sportsbooks</a> have set Baltimore running back <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/2061188/derrick-henrys/\">Derrick Henry's</a> rushing yards prop at 80.5 yards. Meanwhile, Kansas City wideout <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/26730787/xavier-worthy/\">Xavier Worthy</a>, who is returning from a shoulder injury that sidelined him for two games, has his receiving yards prop set at 46.5.</p><p>Before you play a side on Henry, Worthy or any player prop for Week 4 of the NFL season, you need to see what SportsLine player prop expert PropBetGuy has to say. The SportsLine expert has gone 18-13 (+305) in his last 31 NFL player prop picks.</p><h3><strong>Christian Kirk Over 36.5 receiving yards (-114, FanDuel)</strong></h3><p>Kirk's output of 25 receiving yards in his <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/HOU/houston-texans/\">Texans</a> debut last week left a lot to be desired, but the participation stats were encouraging. The former <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/ARI/arizona-cardinals/\">Cardinals</a> and <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/JAC/jacksonville-jaguars/\">Jaguars</a> wideout was on the field for 81% of quarterback <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/3163079/c-j-strouds/\">C.J. Stroud's</a> dropbacks and was the intended target of eight of his 38 pass attempts.</p><p>The duo struggled to connect, but Stroud did throw three deep passes to the slot receiver. Kirk's average depth of target of 12.9 yards was similar to Texans' leading receiver <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/2878193/nico-collins/\">Nico Collins</a>.</p><p>Of course, this is a one-game sample, but it's evident that Kirk was brought in to complement Collins in the passing game. He'll now face a <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/TEN/tennessee-titans/\">Titans</a> defense that's allowed 164 yards per game to opposing receivers, which is the fourth-worst mark in the NFL.</p><p>I'd bet this up to Over 41.5 receiving yards, as this line is undervaluing Kirk's role in the offense.</p><h3><strong>Blake Corum Over 19.5 rushing yards (-115, bet365)</strong></h3><p>On the heels of <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/LAR/los-angeles-rams/\">Rams</a> head coach Sean McVay talking about getting Corum more touches, the second-year running back has received, well, more touches. Corum has had five and eight carries in the last two weeks and gained 44 and 53 yards, respectively.</p><p>The Michigan product has been effective as a backup to workhorse <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/3121836/kyren-williams/\">Kyren Williams</a>, and I do think he's earned a consistent 6-7 carries going forward. He gets a solid spot against the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/IND/indianapolis-colts/\">Colts</a>, who rank 23rd in DVOA against the run and third against the pass.</p><p>Betting on a backup running back to clear a yardage total can get tricky, because the concern typically revolves around the workload. Corum should clear this line with just five carries but I do have him closer to six, projected at 28 rush yards. I'd bet this up to over 21.5 yards.</p>\n<h3><strong>Kam Curl Over 6.5 tackles + assists yards (-115, DraftKings)</strong></h3><p>We're sticking with the Rams, but flipping over to the defensive side. Curl has come out of the gates on fire in the tackle department.</p><p>With 26 combined tackles so far, he's cleared this line in each of the Rams' three games while playing 100% of the defensive snaps. As <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/2874690/quentin-lake/\">Quentin Lake</a> has shifted over to full-time slot corner, it's Curl who has become the team's primary run-stopping safety.</p><p>The Indianapolis Colts have allowed 15 tackles by opposing safeties per game, which is the fifth-highest mark in the league. Curl should have ample opportunity to cash in, and I have him projected closer to eight combined tackles. I'd bet this line up to -140.</p>\n            </div>"

    "body": "<div>\n        <p>No double-digit favorites have lost yet in the 2025 NFL season, but Week 3 did bring perhaps the biggest upset of the year thus far as the Packers fell to the Browns as 7.5-point favorites. That was one of the first big hits for NFL survivor players, and now those who remain are formulating their Week 4 NFL survivor picks with the options beginning to dwindle a bit. The Bills are the biggest favorites on the board (-14.5) this week against the Saints and the biggest favorite of the 2025 NFL season, though many survivor pool players already used Buffalo as big favorites against the Dolphins in Week 3. </p><p>The latest Week 4 NFL odds show six other games with a Week 4 NFL spread of 5.5 points or more, including Browns vs. Lions (-10), Patriots (-5.5) vs. Panthers, Titans vs. Texans (-7.5), Chargers vs. Giants (+6.5), Packers vs. Cowboys (+6.5) on Sunday night and Bengals vs. Broncos (-7.5) on Monday night. Those are the games many NFL survivor players will be targeting, but among those favorites, which ones bring the most value in NFL survivor pools? </p><p><em>Before finalizing any Week 4 NFL survivor picks, </em><a href=\"https://www.sportsline.com/insiders/nfl-survivor-pool-week-4-2025-pick-from-advanced-computer-model/#ttag=09252025_agg_cbssports_picks_football_nfl_model_survivorpool\" target=\"_blank\"><em>see which team the red-hot SportsLine Projection Model just went all-in on</em></a><em>.</em></p><p>The model, which simulates every NFL game 10,000 times, is up well over $7,000 for $100 players on top-rated <a href=\"https://www.sportsline.com/nfl/picks/\" target=\"_blank\">NFL picks</a> since its inception. The model is on a sizzling 39-19 run on top-rated picks dating back to 2024. Anybody following its <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/betting/news/nfl/\" target=\"_blank\">NFL betting</a> picks at <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/betting/news/best-betting-apps/\" target=\"_blank\">sportsbooks</a> and on <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/betting/news/best-betting-apps/\" target=\"_blank\">betting sites</a> could have seen strong returns. The model can be used to crush the survivor pool format, which calls for picking one team to win each week but never using the same team twice. It survived through Week 1 by calling the Commanders over the Giants, Week 2 with the Ravens over the Browns, and Week 3 with Bills over Dolphins.</p><p>Now, it has turned its attention to the latest Week 4 NFL schedule and locked in its Week 4 survivor pool pick. <a href=\"https://www.sportsline.com/insiders/nfl-survivor-pool-week-4-2025-pick-from-advanced-computer-model/#ttag=09252025_agg_cbssports_picks_football_nfl_model_survivorpool\" target=\"_blank\">You can only see who the model is backing this week at SportsLine</a>. </p><p><em>New users can also target the </em><span><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/betting/news/draftkings-promo-code/\"><em>DraftKings promo code</em></a></span><em>, which offers </em><a href=\"https://martech.cbssports.com/bt/redirect/prod?b=draftkings&c=sport\" target=\"_blank\"><em>$200 in bonus bets instantly plus over $200 off NFL Sunday Ticket</em></a><em>:</em></p><h3>Top Week 4 NFL survivor pool predictions </h3><p>In Week 4 of the 2025 NFL season, the model is shying away from the Patriots as they take on the Carolina Panthers. The Patriots are 5.5-point and -247 money-line favorites, as one of the home favorites in the Week 4 lines, but are coming off a 21-14 loss to the Pittsburgh Steelers. The Panthers, meanwhile, got into the win column in a big way by thrashing the Falcons. Fading Carolina prior to that game was a popular NFL survivor strategy. </p><p>The model, however, projects this to be a one-score game, and only has New England winning 58% of the time, which is lower than many home teams this week. Drake Maye has had mixed results in three games and is still getting acclimated as the Patriots' starting quarterback.
