    "body": "<div>\n        <p>FARMINGDALE, N.Y. -- The Ryder Cup's greatest appeal isn't the United States competing against Europe, the wild crowds, the biennial cadence of the event or the world-famous golf tracks that host it.</p><p>The reason it stands out from the major championships, weekly PGA Tour schedule and Olympics is because golf, an individual sport -- perhaps the most individual sport of them all -- undergoes a paradigm shift into a team game under the Ryder Cup banner.</p><p>Once every two years, for three days, the rules change. The game transcends itself, requiring the collective skill and will of 12 men, not one, to enter the winner's circle.</p><p>You've heard it all before, but as the cheers of European supporters rang out across Long Island, long into Sunday night, there is no more poignant time to reiterate the lesson learned from the inherent nature of this event.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/golf/news/ryder-cup-2025-live-updates-results-scores-standings-day-3-singles/live/\" target=\"_blank\">Europe beat the United States 15 to 13</a> because it played sizzling golf, collectively, as a team. </p><p>The U.S. may have most of the best golfers on the planet, but once again, it did not have the best team.</p><p>And so, for the ninth time in the 12 renditions of this illustrious golf celebration since the turn of the century, Europe again proved to be better.</p>\n<p>The only feather in the United States' cap was that it prevented this Ryder Cup from becoming a runaway, legendary blowout.</p><p>At least there was some fight. It took until Sunday -- the fifth session and final 12 matches -- for the Ryder Cup to get interesting the Americans U.S. to approach it as if they actually wanted to win the damn thing. </p><p>Thriving across 11 one-on-one matches, the U.S. unintentionally proved the point its team has been forced to relearn every two years: The Ryder Cup is about the collective, not the individual.</p>\n<p>The Americans ultimately scored a Sunday singles record-tying 8.5 points, going 6-1-5 head-to-head on the final day of competition. The 12th match was \"enveloped\" after Europe's Viktor Hovland pulled out with a neck injury, inducing the U.S. to reveal Harris English would sit as well. Each side conceded a half point, pushing Europe ahead 12 to 5 before the first match of the day teed off. </p><hr /><p>As an aside: United States captain Keegan Bradley, who was none too pleased that his team lost an opportunity to score a full point, is correct: \"The rule has to change,\" he said Sunday night. \"It's obvious to everybody in the sports world, in this room, that rule needs to change by the next Ryder Cup.</p><hr /><p>What ensued over the five hours of singles competition alternated between being intriguing, thrilling and ... briefly ... hope-filled. Xander Schauffle took down Jon Rahm with emphasis. Scottie Scheffler finally got off the schnide by taking down Rory McIlroy. (Scheffler entered as the first world No. 1 to ever start 0-4-0 in a Ryder Cup). Bryson DeChambeau tied a record rallying from five down through seven holes square his match with Matt Fitzpatrick.</p>\n<p>Match by match, the scoreboard flipped from gray to red. The seven-point margin before the opening tee suddenly dropped to three when J.J. Spaun soared over Sepp Straka.</p><p>It was a comeback that fueled -- for just for a moment -- fleeting hope amongst the tens of thousands of U.S. fans flooding the grounds around the final four holes.</p><p>That hope vanished at 5:15 p.m. ET when Shane Lowry sunk a 6-foot, 3-inch putt to lift Europe to 14 points, clinching a Ryder Cup retention and putting the visitors a half point away from an outright win.</p>\n<p>Moments before that, just when it seemed as if the United States was threading the smallest needle in golf history, Russell Henley had the shot of his life: 128 yards out of the left fairway bunker, a blast easily at least 100 feet in the air that plopped down less than 10 feet from the pin. But Henley left his putt short, which cracked the door for Lowry, who drained his effort and exploded with glee.</p><figure><p><img alt=\"shane-lowry-jump-ryder-cup-g.jpg\" src=\"https://sportshub.cbsistatic.com/i/r/2025/09/28/2f2517cb-bccd-4ef5-a0b0-20dfea86c31d/resize/670x377/2e329b9239c815d34477a493d688478d/shane-lowry-jump-ryder-cup-g.jpg\" /></p><figcaption><span>\n                                                                    Getty Images\n                                                            </span></figcaption></figure><p>The Irishman was brought to tears. It took a team effort, but the big man finished the job. Lowry didn't even win his match; in fact, the only European to claim a full point Sunday was Ludvig Åberg, who defeated Patrick Cantlay.</p><p>Sunday was the coronation. Europe did its work Friday and Saturday. It won three of the first four sessions 3 to 1 (the other 2.5 to 1.5), becoming the first visiting team to sweep foursomes and fourballs in modern Ryder Cup history. That left almost no chance for the U.S.</p>\n<p>Europe's putting was unreal. The greens were too forgiving, to be sure, and the Bethpage Black rough was far from its typical depth and hellish coarseness. <span><a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/golf/news/keegan-bradley-cardinal-sin-usa-ryder-cup-captain-bethpage-black/\" target=\"_blank\">Those were the cardinal sins of Bradley's American captaincy.</a></span></p><p>Europe never let the United States believe it had a chance in the team competition. That psychological edge so often seen in traditional team sports proving critical Sunday when the United States finally got its act together.</p><p>\"This is no one's fault but mine,\" Bradley said. \"When you're the leader of the team, the coach, whatever you want to call it ... when you lose, you take the blame.\"</p>\n<p>There are significant questions for the United States to address: how it picks its captain, how its captain handles foursomes and fourballs, how to use modern data to make more informed decisions.</p><p>If the Ryder Cup is going to return to being an actual rivalry again, at the core of it all needs to be something of a reckoning with not only how the United States builds its team but the psychological approach it takes in the weeks and months leading up to the Ryder Cup.</p><p>The Americans' next chance comes in 2027 at Adare Manor in County Limerick, Ireland. The U.S. will enter as an even bigger -- perhaps weaker -- enemy than Europe appeared in New York over the past three days.</p>\n<p>That underdog status can only be contested through chemistry and genuine belief in one another. </p><p>Genuine teamwork is the essence of the Ryder Cup. It is a requirement. The European side understands this on a fundamental level. It's why those in blue and yellow are taking the trophy back across the Atlantic Ocean, while the United States is left watching the visitors celebrate, trying to remember what that feeling is all about.</p>\n            </div>"

The Detroit Tigers narrowly clung to their lead in the AL Central and will face off against the Cleveland Guardians, who lost out on the division on the last day but earned the third wild card berth.

    "body": "<div>\n        <p>USC star JuJu Watkins announced on social media Sunday that she will not play for the Trojans during the 2025-26 NCAA season. Watkins, who tore her ACL in her right knee during the 2025 Women's NCAA Tournament, said she wants to \"fully focus on continuing to recover.\" </p><p>Here is Watkins' statement in full:</p><blockquote><p>\"These last few months have been filled with a lot of healing, rest, and reflection. Recovering from this injury hasn't been easy, and I want to say thank you -- your love, support, and kind words have truly lifted me up during one of the most challenging times in my life. Because you've been with me every step of the way, I wanted you to hear it from me directly that following the advice of my doctors and trainers I will sit out this season and fully focus on continuing to recover so I can come back to the game I love.</p><p>\"I'm incredibly thankful for my family, teammates, coaches, the USC training personnel, Jason, Shane, and everyone who's continued to support me every day through this journey. I'm excited to keep putting the work in to come back even stronger.\"</p></blockquote><p>Watkins was around the team this summer during her rehab process, but was not on the court when the team held its first official practice on Sept. 23. USC coach Lindsay Gottlieb told reporters earlier this month that Watkins' recovery was \"going great,\" but did not elaborate on her status.</p><p>Watkins' announcement that she is sitting out of the entire season will save her teammates and coaches from having to answer constant questions about a possible return throughout the season. </p><p>\"JuJu's health and well-being are our top priority, and we fully support her decision to focus on recovery this season,\" Gottlieb <a href=\"https://usctrojans.com/news/2025/9/28/womens-basketball-uscs-juju-watkins-to-miss-2025-26-season-to-focus-on-recovery\" target=\"_blank\">said in a press release</a>. \"While we will certainly miss her impact on the court, she continues to play a vital role in our program as a leader and teammate. The strength and maturity she has shown through this process is a reflection of who she is, and we know the Trojan Family will continue to rally behind her. We look forward to the day she returns to competition stronger than ever.\"</p><p>Watkins averaged 23.9 points, 6.8 rebounds, 3.4 assists, 2.2 steals and 1.8 blocks during her sophomore season, and racked up numerous accolades, including Naismith Player of the Year, Big Ten Player of the Year and a unanimous spot on the AP All-American First Team. </p>\n<p>During USC's 96-59 win over No. 9 seed Mississippi State in the second round of the 2025 Women's NCAA Tournament, Watkins was driving to the basket in transition when her knee buckled and she collapsed to the ground. She had to be helped off the floor and was unable to play during the remainder of the Big Dance. The Trojans were ultimately eliminated in the Elite Eight by UConn, the eventual national champions. </p><p>Watkins, who is entering her junior season, is not eligible to declare for the WNBA until 2027 based on the league's current draft rules. As things stand, domestic prospects must be at least 22 years old in the calendar year in which the draft takes place to be eligible. </p><p>It is possible that the draft rules will be changed in the new collective bargaining agreement -- whenever a new deal is actually ratified. The WNBPA and the WNBA are currently embroiled in a heated labor battle that does not seem likely to be resolved any time soon. </p><p>Watkins has previously said that she hopes the age limit will be lowered. </p>\n<p>\"I want to say personally I am enjoying my experience, Coach,\" Watkins said during an <a href=\"https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/jujus-one-relatable-trait-with-juju-watkins-and/id1752100672?i=1000680797739\" target=\"_blank\">appearance on \"Good Game with Sarah Spain</a>\" last year. \"I definitely think we should have the option. There's just been such a growth in college basketball where it's like, why would you want to leave? Because you're able to have that experience and build your brand here in college as well. I would definitely say we should have the option but I think college is a way to prepare us for the pros as well. So, I don't know. It's a touchy subject, but I'm for it.\"</p>\n            </div>"

They have not won a playoff series since 2017. Chicago made a blockbuster trade for outfielder <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/players/2184352/kyle-tucker/\">Kyle Tucker</a> this past winter and has largely delivered, at least until finger and calf injuries sabotaged his second half. Tucker will be a free agent this coming offseason. A strong postseason would help the Cubbies and also serve him well come contract time. <span><a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/news/cade-horton-injury-cubs-pitcher-likely-out-of-mlb-playoffs-through-nlds-after-suffering-broken-rib/\" target=\"_blank\">The Cubs will be without rookie Cade Horton through at least the NLDS because of a rib injury</a></span>. He might have been their Game 1 starter this postseason otherwise. Chicago scored the fourth-most runs per game and allowed the eighth-fewest runs per game in 2025. The Brewers and <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/teams/PHI/philadelphia-phillies/\">Philadelphia Phillies</a> were the only other teams to rank in the top eight of each.</p>\n<p><strong>Padres: </strong>This is the fourth postseason trip in six years for the Padres, who went to the playoffs five times in their first 50 seasons. They had a 2-1 series lead over the rival <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/teams/LAD/los-angeles-dodgers/\">Los Angeles Dodgers</a> in last year's NLDS, but did not score another run in the series, and were eliminated. This year's team is built around run prevention. The Padres were middle of the pack in runs scored despite hitting the third-fewest home runs. Their bullpen, even with <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/players/1846226/jason-adam/\">Jason Adam</a> injured, is the best and deepest in the sport. Their path to success is scratching out a few runs early, then turning a lead over to <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/players/2836849/jeremiah-estrada/\">Jeremiah Estrada</a>, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/players/26911802/mason-miller/\">Mason Miller</a>, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/players/2803408/adrian-morejon/\">Adrian Morejon</a>, and closer <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/players/26861461/robert-suarez/\">Robert Suarez</a>.</p>\n            </div>\n    </div>"

In his first 20 games, of which the Titans won just three, Callahan's offense ranked last in the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://cbssports.com/nfl/\">NFL</a> in total yards per game, and bottom five in points per game, yards per play, passing yards per game and turnovers per game. </p>\n<p>While it's not a descriptor everyone would use, \"ass\" is certainly accurate when it comes to the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://cbssports.com/nfl/teams/\">NFL team</a> that plays in Tennessee. </p>\n            </div>\n    </div>"

    "body": "<div>\n        <p>This week's <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://cbssports.com/nfl/\">NFL</a> slate certainly told some truths regarding the contending teams. The Kansas City Chiefs took care of the Baltimore Ravens in the highlight game of the Sunday afternoon slate, leaving plenty of questions for the Ravens -- who were a <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://cbssports.com/nfl/superbowl/\">Super Bowl</a> contender entering the year. </p><p>The <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/LAR/los-angeles-rams/\">Los Angeles Rams</a> survived the Indianapolis Colts. The Philadelphia Eagles and <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/TB/tampa-bay-buccaneers/\">Tampa Bay Buccaneers</a> played in a 12-round slugfest, with the Eagles coming out of September unbeaten. The Pittsburgh Steelers also played a thriller in Dublin, a game that had many shaking their heads. </p><p>Who had the New York Giants beating the Los Angeles Chargers or the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/ATL/atlanta-falcons/\">Atlanta Falcons</a> defeating the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/WAS/washington-commanders/\">Washington Commanders</a>? What about the Jacksonville Jaguars beating the San Francisco 49ers?</p><p>These Sunday games had plenty of overreactions worth discussing, thanks to all the storylines that unfolded. Which ones are actually overreactions and which are reality? </p>\n<h2><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/BAL/baltimore-ravens/\">Ravens</a> won't make the playoffs, even with a healthy <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/2239671/lamar-jackson/\">Lamar Jackson</a></h2><p><strong>Overreaction or reality:</strong> Reality</p><p>This is painful to admit because Jackson is that good of a quarterback and can carry the Ravens on his back. The proof is in the pudding through four games, as the Ravens simply aren't good enough to be a playoff team right now. </p><p>The defense had no chance against the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/KC/kansas-city-chiefs/\">Chiefs</a> on Sunday, allowing the Chiefs to score on seven of their first eight possessions, reigniting the MVP play of <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/2142052/patrick-mahomes/\">Patrick Mahomes</a>. They also lost <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/2180472/roquan-smith/\">Roquan Smith</a>, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/26699779/nate-wiggins/\">Nate Wiggins</a> and <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/2139775/marlon-humphrey/\">Marlon Humphrey</a> in this game, two significant losses to a defense that has allowed 40 to the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/BUF/buffalo-bills/\">Bills</a>, 38 to the Lions, and 37 to the Chiefs. </p><p>Even if Jackson is healthy and doesn't miss a significant period of time after exiting Sunday with a hamstring injury, it may not matter. This isn't the Ravens of years past, a team with a dominant defense and an MVP quarterback. The Ravens just can't stop anyone, a sign of a team that will miss the playoffs. </p>\n<h2>Chiefs are going to win the AFC West -- again</h2><p><strong>Overreaction or reality:</strong> Reality</p><p>Let's declare it after Week 4, the Chiefs are back. Patrick Mahomes threw four touchdowns in a blowout win over the Ravens as Kansas City scored on seven of its first eight possessions. The Chiefs offense got a significant pass catcher back in <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/26730787/xavier-worthy/\">Xavier Worthy</a> and will get <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/3124978/rashee-rice/\">Rashee Rice</a> back in a few weeks. They have Andy Reid as a coach and Mahomes at quarterback, so there was little reason to worry. </p><p>The Chargers lost both their offensive tackles and were upset by the Giants, opening the door for the Chiefs. The <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/DEN/denver-broncos/\">Broncos</a> don't look as good as last year in the early going either. As for the Chiefs' two loss -- the Chargers in Brazil and the defending <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://cbssports.com/nfl/superbowl/\">Super Bowl</a> champions. </p><p>The Chiefs were always going to be fine, and they may be back too. They'll win the AFC West again. </p>\n<h2><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/JAC/jacksonville-jaguars/\">Jaguars</a> are the best team in the AFC South</h2><p><strong>Overreaction or reality:</strong> Overreaction</p><p>What a victory for the Jaguars, as they walked into Santa Clara and beat the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/SF/san-francisco-49ers/\">49ers</a> -- earning four takeaways and extending their league lead in that department. Jacksonville has the best defense in the division, as defensive coordinator Anthony Campanile has transformed that unit. <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/2809206/travis-etienne/\">Travis Etienne</a> has become their most reliable player on offense, as that side of the ball is still trying to get Brian Thomas and <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/28909849/travis-hunter/\">Travis Hunter</a> going. </p><p>Are the Jaguars better than the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/IND/indianapolis-colts/\">Colts</a>? The Colts have a strong case to be 4-0 if it wasn't for two blunder by <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/26701928/adonai-mitchell/\">Adonai Mitchell</a>, even with <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/2179245/daniel-jones/\">Daniel Jones</a> throwing two interceptions in the loss. Even though Jacksonville beat Houston, hard to keep the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/HOU/houston-texans/\">Texans</a> out of the conversation -- even at 1-3.</p><p>The Jaguars are off to a nice start and have stacked up some big wins. If the offense can get going, let's revisit this conversation. </p>\n<h2><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/3121687/puka-nacua/\">Puka Nacua</a> will lead the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://cbssports.com/nfl/\">NFL</a> in receiving yards this season</h2><p><strong>Overreaction or reality:</strong> Reality</p><p>What Nacua has done through four games deserves mentioning, especially after he finished with 13 catches for 170 yards and a touchdown in a victory over the Colts. Through four games, Nacua has 503 receiving yards -- on pace for 2,138 on the season. </p><p>While 2,000 yards will be nice for Nacua, he's going to be the high-volume wideout in Los Angeles a steh No. 1 receiver. He's thrived in Sean McVay's system and always finds his way open in the middle of the field. As long as <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/1114942/matthew-stafford/\">Matthew Stafford</a> is healthy, Nacua will get his targets. </p><p>This is the year Nacua gets his flowers as one of the best wideouts in the game, as he's set up to have an All-Pro campaign. </p>\n<h2>Eagles have an <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/2258303/a-j-brown/\">A.J. Brown</a> problem</h2><p><strong>Overreaction or reality:</strong> Overreaction</p><p>Brown <a href=\"https://x.com/1kalwaysopen_/status/1972421757308215663\" target=\"_blank\">might have shown some frustration on social media</a> after the Eagles victory to get to 4-0 today, as the star wideout finished with two catches for 7 yards (on 9 targets). This is the second game this season Brown has finished with fewer than 10 receiving yards in a game, and he has just 151 yards through four games.</p><p><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/2240246/jalen-hurts/\">Jalen Hurts</a> was 2 of 7 for nine yards targeting Brown on Sunday, having a 39.6 passer rating. That's unlike the two when Hurts targets his best receiver, but so is the Eagles offense having spurts for a half where they look like the worst offense in football. </p><p>Brown has a right to be frustrated with the offense and how he's being utilized, but a tweet or two shouldn't sound the panic alarm. He's handled things the right way and hasn't really let frustrations out in the open. The Eagles have to find ways to use Brown better, as their offense gets too cold too many teams. This group is too talented to be this inconsistent. </p>\n<h2>Brian Callahan won't be the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/TEN/tennessee-titans/\">Titans</a>' coach by November </h2><p><strong>Overreaction or reality:</strong> Reality</p>\n<p>The Titans were not expected to be a good football team, but Tennessee has simply been uncompetitive through the first four games this year. Tennessee is 0-4 to start the season and has lost 10 straight games, the longest losing streak by the franchise since moving to Tennessee.</p><p>The offense is uninspiring, not ideal for having a rookie quarterback in <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/3168422/cam-ward/\">Cam Ward</a>. While Ward is doing what he can with what little he has to work with, the Titans are last in the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://cbssports.com/nfl/\">NFL</a> in offensive points per game (12.8). They have 20 points or less in each of their four games, while Ward has completed 53.2% of his passes with just two touchdown passes and a 63.9 passer rating. </p><p>Callahan is 3-18 in his first 21 games as a head coach, an uninspiring .143 win percentage. Losing poorly isn't helping him, especially against divisional foes (the AFC South isn't great). He's certainly on the hot seat. </p>\n<h2><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/2185957/saquon-barkley/\">Saquon Barkley</a> will not rush for 1,000 yards this season</h2><p><strong>Overreaction or reality:</strong> Overreaction</p>\n<p>The <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/PHI/philadelphia-eagles/\">Eagles</a> have a problem on offense when it comes to running the football, which was evident when Barkley failed to get 50-plus rushing yards again. Barkley had just 19 carries for 43 yards and a touchdown in the win, averaging just 2.3 yards per carry. His longest run was 10 yards as the Eagles have had trouble finding ways to create lanes for him.</p><p>Through four games, Barkley has 77 carries for 237 yards and 3.1 yards per carry. The Eagles are 4-0 in spite of Barkley's struggles, but this is part of the reason why the offense has spurts like they do in the second half (26 plays for 14 yards prior to final drive).</p><p>The roots of the Eagles' problems on offense are the struggles in the run game. They'll have to turn it around at some point, even with Barkley on pace to rush for just 1,007 yards this season. This offense is too good for Barkley to barely get 1,000 yards. </p>\n<h2><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/26694019/jaxson-dart/\">Jaxson Dart</a> is better than Cameron Ward</h2><p><strong>Overreaction or reality:</strong> Reality</p>\n<p>There isn't much of a sample size here with this year's first-round quarterbacks, but Dart has impressed enough in his first start to stake this claim as the best. First, Dart did get a win in his debut -- against the undefeated <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/LAC/los-angeles-chargers/\">Chargers</a> no less. Dart is the first quarterback to win his first career start against a 3-0 or better team since 2002, bringing life into a <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/NYG/new-york-giants/\">Giants</a> team that looked dormant after the first three games.</p><p>Dart went just 13 of 20 for 111 yards, but threw for a touchdown and ran for one (96.0 rating). He also didn't have <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/26697761/malik-nabers/\">Malik Nabers</a> for a majority of the game, as Nabers left with a significant knee injury. The Giants were still able to score touchdowns.</p><p>What Dart is doing in his one start is better than anything Ward has shown, outside of an impressive across-the-field touchdown pass. This isn't Ward's fault, as he's part of an unimaginative offense. Giants head coach Daboll is on the same hot seat as Brian Callahan too, and he's gotten the most out of his rookie quarterback so far.</p>\n<h2><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/DET/detroit-lions/\">Lions</a> are the Eagles' biggest threat in the NFC</h2><p><strong>Overreaction or reality:</strong> Reality</p>\n<p>This topic of discussion will likely flip-flop all season, but it's clear the Lions are back on track as a <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://cbssports.com/nfl/superbowl/\">Super Bowl</a> contender. Detroit took care of Cleveland easily on Sunday, getting two touchdowns from <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/2967690/amon-ra-st-brown/\">Amon-Ra St. Brown</a> and forcing two interceptions from <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/1250697/joe-flacco/\">Joe Flacco</a> (the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/CLE/cleveland-browns/\">Browns</a>' offense struggled mightily). </p><p>The Lions have the look of a complete team -- one that can beat the Eagles at home if they face Philadelphia there. The Week 1 loss to Green Bay feels like an eternity ago, as Detroit has averaged 38 points per game since. The Eagles are very good and know how to win games, but the Lions may be the more complete team right now.</p><p>These two teams meet in November, which may be for the No. 1 seed. </p><h2><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/PIT/pittsburgh-steelers/\">Steelers</a>' win was in spite of Mike Tomlin</h2><p><strong>Overreaction or reality:</strong> Overreaction</p>\n<p>Let's start with the obvious. What Tomlin did on fourth-and-1 with 1:08 left in a 24-21 game is indefensible, taking a delay of game penalty to punt instead of running a play on the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/MIN/minnesota-vikings/\">Vikings</a>' 40-yard line -- a play in which a first down would have won the game. The conservative decision did work, but these are the decisions Tomlin makes that are head-scratching. </p><p>Earlier in the Steelers' win over the Vikings, Tomlin had Pittsburgh go for it on fourth-and-goal from the 3-yard line with 4:14 left in a  24-14 game, but the play call was a run to <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/2968948/kenneth-gainwell/\">Kenneth Gainwell</a> (reminder <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/419780/aaron-rodgers/\">Aaron Rodgers</a> is the quarterback). The Steelers didn't get it, allowing the Vikings to be in a game that should have been a blowout. </p><p>Despite Tomlin's flaws, the Steelers play hard for Tomlin, and their game preparation appears to still be among the best in the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://cbssports.com/nfl/\">NFL</a>. Pittsburgh was ready to play in Ireland in spite of not playing many international games, and Rodgers has been pretty efficient. </p><p>Perhaps this blows up in Tomlin's face, but it's hard to argue with non-losing seasons. There are still some good things regarding Tomlin, but his game management is questionable. </p><h2>Vikings' offensive line is why they won't make the playoffs</h2><p><strong>Overreaction or reality:</strong> Reality</p>\n<p>The Vikings quarterback play can be criticized religiously, and there's plenty to write about <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/1907522/carson-wentz/\">Carson Wentz</a>'s performance on Sunday. The offensive line does Wentz little favors, nor have they been healthy enough to help him out anyway. </p><p>With <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/2136495/brian-oneill/\">Brian O'Neill</a> leaving Sunday's loss with a knee injury, that leaves <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/2251296/will-fries/\">Will Fries</a> as the only starting lineman not to be injured this season. <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/2961174/christian-darrisaw/\">Christian Darrisaw</a> missed the first two weeks and <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/26702924/donovan-jackson/\">Donovan Jackson</a> is out due to wrist surgery. Center <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/1893142/ryan-kelly/\">Ryan Kelly</a> has also missed time due to a concussion. There just isn't any continuity among this group through four weeks, as they had zero snaps played together this season. </p><p>Wentz had his issues facing pressure (5 of 10 passing for 60 yards), but it's hard to sustain offensive continuity when the offensive linemen are injured every week. This will be the Vikings downfall. </p>\n            </div>"

It was a memorable one, with the rookie quarterback leading the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/NYG/new-york-giants/\">New York Giants</a> to 21-18 upset win over the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/LAC/los-angeles-chargers/\">Los Angeles Chargers</a>. </p><p>Dart was impressive in his debut. He didn't put up huge numbers, but he kept the Giants offense moving, especially with his legs, rushing for 54 yards and a touchdown on 10 carries. Dart also threw a touchdown pass in the win. </p><p>Thanks to the win, Dart <a href=\"https://x.com/ESPNInsights/status/1971231324720468371\" target=\"_blank\">became the first quarterback</a> in 23 years to win his first career start over a team that's 3-0 or better. The Chargers were 3-0 going into Sunday's matchup at MetLife Stadium. </p>\n<p>Before Dart came along, the last time it happened came in 2002 when Marc Bulger led the 0-5 <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/LAR/los-angeles-rams/\">Rams</a> to a stunning upset win over the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/LV/las-vegas-raiders/\">Raiders</a>, who were 4-0 and favored by seven points. Since the AFL-NFL merger in 1970, there were only five quarterbacks who pulled off the feat prior to Dart. Here's the full list: </p><ul><li><strong>1979: Giants QB Phil Simms.</strong> If Dart pulls off a win, he wouldn't even be the first Giants QB to join this rare club, because Simms was the first to do it. Back in 1979, he led the 0-5 Giants, who were six-point underdogs, to a 17-14 win over the 5-0 <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/TB/tampa-bay-buccaneers/\">Buccaneers</a>. Simms didn't have a banner day -- he only threw for 37 yards -- but he got plenty of help from running back Billy Taylor, who rushed for 148 yards and two touchdowns. The Giants defense also forced three turnovers in the win. Simms ended up going 6-5 as a rookie, which the Giants would gladly take with Dart. As a matter of fact, the team would probably love to see Dart emulate Simms' career since the Giants' legend ended up winning two Super Bowls in New York. </li><li><strong>1989: <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/BUF/buffalo-bills/\">Bills</a> QB Frank Reich.</strong> With Jim Kelly injured, the 3-2 Bills started Reich for their Week 6 game against the 5-0 Rams. Reich ended up leading Buffalo to a wild 23-20 win that saw him throw an 8-yard game-winning touchdown pass to Andre Reed in the final 20 seconds. Overall, Reich threw for 214 yards and two touchdowns for the Bills, who were 3.5-point underdogs. Reich ended up starting three games for Kelly in 1989 and went 3-0 in those games. </li><li><strong>1992: <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/GB/green-bay-packers/\">Packers</a> QB Brett Favre.</strong> After an injury to Don Majkowski in Week 3, Favre got the first start of his career in Week 4 of the 1992 season with the 1-2 Packers facing the 3-0 <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/PIT/pittsburgh-steelers/\">Steelers</a>, who were favored by 3.5 points. Favre threw for 210 yards and two touchdowns, including a 76-yard score to Sterling Sharpe, in Green Bay's 17-3 win. Favre went 8-5 in his first season as the Packers' starting quarterback, thus starting the legend of the Ol' Gunslinger.  </li><li><strong>1999: <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/SF/san-francisco-49ers/\">49ers</a> QB Jeff Garcia. </strong>In the first start of his career, Garcia had to face a 3-0 <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/TEN/tennessee-titans/\">Titans</a> team that eventually made it to the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://cbssports.com/nfl/superbowl/\">Super Bowl</a> in 1999. The 49ers quarterback was forced to start in Week 4 against Tennessee after Steve Young suffered what turned out to <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/news/1999/1026/135275.html\" target=\"_blank\">be a career-ending concussion in Week 3</a>. Garcia threw for 242 yards and two touchdowns while leading the 49ers to a 24-22 win over the Titans. Although Garcia made his first career start in 1999, he wasn't exactly a rookie. He spent five seasons in the CFL before signing with the 49ers. </li><li><strong>2002: Rams QB Marc Bulger.</strong> In a 28-13 win over the Raiders, Bulger got a lot of help from his rushing attack with Marshall Faulk going off for 158 yards on the ground. Although Bulger didn't put up eye-popping numbers -- he threw for just 186 yards -- he did throw three touchdown passes. The Rams defense also forced three very big turnovers. </li></ul><a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/news/nfl-week-4-overreactions-jaxson-dart-better-than-cameron-ward-saquon-barkley-experiencing-down-year/\" target=\"_blank\">\n        <div>\n            <div>\n                <p>NFL Week 4 overreactions: Lamar Jackson won't be able to save the Ravens?
