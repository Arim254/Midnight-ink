Sternberg will retain a minority stake in the team. The Rays are not expected to relocate as part of the purchase.</p><p>Zalupski's first major order of business will, ostensibly, be landing an agreement to build a new ballpark -- something that Sternberg repeatedly struck out on, <span><a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/news/rays-say-they-cannot-move-forward-with-new-stadium-our-commitment-is-unwavering/\" target=\"_blank\">including earlier this year, when the Rays announced they would not proceed with plans for a $1.3 billion stadium</a></span>.  </p>\n<p>Last week, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/news/rays-top-leadership-steps-down-ahead-of-team-sale-as-real-estate-developer-readies-takeover/\">two of the Rays' team presidents Matt Silverman and Brian Auld both stepped down from their positions ahead of the ownership change</a>.

    "body": "<div>\n        <p>This <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/wnba/teams/NYL/new-york-liberty/\">New York Liberty</a> season began with a 9-0 start and expectations of another championship run. Last Friday night, it ended abruptly in the first round of the WNBA playoffs when the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/wnba/teams/PHO/phoenix-mercury/\">Phoenix Mercury</a> won 79-73 in the deciding game of the best-of-three series.</p><p>New York Liberty forward <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/wnba/players/26678022/breanna-stewart/\">Breanna Stewart</a> -- who sprained her MCL in the Liberty's overtime win in Game 1 of the series and had only six points in a Game 2 loss -- scored a remarkable 30 points on Friday night in Phoenix, including 14 in the fourth quarter. Unfortunately for New York, not one other Liberty player recorded a point in the final 10 minutes.  <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/wnba/players/26678052/jonquel-jones/\">Jonquel Jones</a>, 2024 Finals MVP, was held to three points and seven rebounds all game.</p><p>\"It really, really hurts, and I think it'll continue to hurt for days, weeks, months from now,\" Stewart said after her earliest playoff exit since 2017 when she played for the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/wnba/teams/SEA/seattle-storm/\">Seattle Storm</a>.</p><p>The series was, in many ways, a microcosm of the Liberty's season -- a promising start halted by significant adversity and ultimately, not enough players stepping up when it mattered the most. Stewart, for her part, tried to focus on the positive after the loss.</p>\n<p>\"People could have thought the game was done when it was 72-64 and we still clawed back, fought back and just were a few plays off. And it's tough. I mean, it hurts, but I wouldn't want to have any season like this with anybody else. So I'm happy to be here in New York, and happy to be alongside these two fighting every day,\" she said, referring guard <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/wnba/players/26678007/sabrina-ionescu/\">Sabrina Ionescu</a> and head coach Sandy Brondello, who sat with her on the podium.</p><p>\"This team is more than resilient with all the shit that we've gone through this season, and we left it all out there.\" </p><p>But while the two-time WNBA MVP was proud of her team's effort, the Liberty as an organization have a lot of questions to answer. The offseason will not include plans for more parades and banners in Brooklyn. Instead, the team will have to take a hard look at why their best seemed ever so slightly out of reach. </p>\n<h2>Injuries derailed a strong start</h2><p>The Liberty looked invincible heading into 2025, especially after a 9-0 start to the season. But things began to unravel when Jones aggravated an ankle injury on June 19 and missed nine consecutive games. She returned on July 22, but four days later, Stewart suffered a bone bruise in her right knee and missed 13 games.</p><p>Additionally, center <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/wnba/players/28850667/nyara-sabally/\">Nyara Sabally</a> missed 21 games, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/wnba/players/26677821/kennedy-burke/\">Kennedy Burke</a> missed eight games with a calf strain and Sabrina Ionescu, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/wnba/players/26677878/natasha-cloud/\">Natasha Cloud</a> and <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/wnba/players/26677974/isabelle-harrison/\">Isabelle Harrison</a> all missed time down the stretch, too. According to <a href=\"https://www.thenexthoops.com/wnba/wnba-injury-tracker-who-gets-hurt-how-often-and-why-it-matters/\" target=\"_blank\">The Next's injury tracker</a>, Liberty players missed a combined 122 games in the regular season due to injury, the second-most in the league, and the team deployed a staggering 18 starting lineups in a 44-game season. Only one player, reserve guard Marine Johannés played in every regular-season game.</p><p>\"Obviously we didn't live up to our expectations that we set out for ourselves, being the defending champions, and it was hard to get any kind of rhythm for us ... we faced so much adversity,\" Brondello said Friday. </p>\n<p>\"I've had injuries with players before, but not like quite like this year. But, you know, proud of this players. We just hung in there. And there were games obviously, when we knew we could be better and we weren't. So that's on us finding the little bit more consistency, regardless of who's on the court.\" </p><h2>The injuries don't explain all of the Liberty's troubles, though</h2><p>Coming into the season, New York was a favorite to run it back due to their roster depth. But by the time the playoffs came around, the Liberty's depth was practically non-existent.</p><p>Among the stars expected to shine was Johannés, the longest-tenured Liberty player who missed the 2024 season due to French national team commitments. Johannés, also known as \"La Magicienne\", is known for her dazzling, one-legged perimeter shot. But while the Liberty had the second-highest 3-point percentage in the league in the regular season (35.5%), Johannés had the lowest field-goal percentage (39.7%) and 3-point percentage (34.4%) of her WNBA career. </p>\n<p>She averaged 18 minutes per game, with her numbers peaking to nearly 20 minutes in August, but by September, Johannés was averaging two points in 10.5 minutes per game. In the playoffs she was basically out of the rotation, playing only 10 minutes in garbage time of Game 2, and going 0-3 from the arc in that span. </p><p>The Liberty also signed two free agents midseason to help bolster their injury-ravaged frontcourt. But those moves fell well short of the potential they carried on paper. </p><p>Forward <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/wnba/players/26677755/stephanie-talbot/\">Stephanie Talbot</a>, who started the season with the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/wnba/teams/GS/golden-state-valkyries/\">Golden State Valkyries</a>, was picked up on July 21. The Australian Olympian was meant to add more depth at the wing, but due to Stewart's injury she spent her first month in New York playing out of position. She only provided 2.5 points per game from the bench, and like Johannés, only played in garbage time of Game 2 in the playoffs.</p>\n<p>The biggest midseason signing was <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/wnba/players/2063689/emma-meesseman/\">Emma Meesseman</a>, the 2019 WNBA Finals MVP, who joined the Liberty after an MVP-worthy performance for Belgium at EuroBasket this summer. She averaged over 19 points and nine rebounds per game in the June tournament, and her addition to the team had many pencilling the Liberty back into the Finals.</p><p>But while Meesseman had a decent regular-season for the Liberty, averaging 13.4 points, 5.1 rebounds and 3.2 assists in 26 minutes over 17 games, in the postseason she looked completely outmatched by the physicality of the Phoenix Mercury.  She only averaged 4.3 points, 5.3 rebounds, and two assists in 13.3 minutes in the playoffs, and in the deciding Game 3 she had zero points in nine minutes.</p><p>Overall, Brondello showed little faith in her bench. In a season where the Liberty were without Stewart and Jones for significant stretches, reserve players averaged the fifth-fewest minutes per game (12) in the league in the regular season. </p>\n<p>Although some challenges the Liberty encountered this season may be fixed with rest and recovery in the offseason, changes to the roster may still be in order. </p><h2>Stewart says she will return, but who will join her?</h2><p>With the status of the CBA unknown, and two expansion teams joining the league next season, it is unlikely New York can keep its roster together. The Liberty have eight players entering the offseason as unrestricted free agents, including four of their five starters -- Cloud, Jones, Ionescu and Stewart. </p><p>Stewart, for her part, was emphatic after the loss to the Mercury that she plans to try and run in back with New York.</p>\n<p>\"Well, I'm coming back,\" she said moments after the Game 3 loss. She also ardently showed her support for Brondello.</p><p>\"What the fuck,\" Stewart said just loud enough for the microphone to detect when asked what she would say to people questioning if Brondello should return.</p><p>\"I mean, to anybody that that kind of questions Sandy being here like, this is a resilient group, and she has our back, and we have hers.\"</p>\n<p>Ionescu implied that she would return, too. </p><p>\"I'm excited for next year. I think we're going to use this to continue to motivate us,\" Ionescu added. \"I think you gotta cherish those years where everything seems to be going well, like you're healthy, you got the players out there, and this year just wasn't our year with that... it just didn't fall our way with injuries.\" </p><p>Still, plenty of questions remain. </p><p>Will the Liberty opt to stick with Cloud at point guard? Will Meesseman want to return, and if she does, will the Liberty want her? How can the team sure up its depth? The Liberty need to spend the offseason taking a hard look in the mirror. Something needs to change if New York wants to maximize its championship window. </p>\n            </div>"

Wilson averaged 23.4 points, 10.2 rebounds, 3.1 assists, 1.6 steals and 2.3 blocks per game. She won her second consecutive scoring title and finished second in the league in rebounding, fourth in steals and first in blocks. Wilson is the first player in WNBA history to win the award four times and joined Cynthina Cooper-Dyke as the only players to win it in back-to-back seasons. </p><a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/wnba/news/2025-wnba-mvp-aces-aja-wilson-becomes-first-player-to-win-award-four-times-after-leading-vegas-to-playoffs/\" target=\"_blank\">\n        <div>\n            <div>\n                <p>2025 WNBA MVP: Aces' A'ja Wilson becomes first player to win award four times after leading Vegas to playoffs</p>\n                <p>\n                    Jack Maloney                </p>\n            </div>\n                            <div>\n    <figure><img alt=\"2025 WNBA MVP: Aces' A'ja Wilson becomes first player to win award four times after leading Vegas to playoffs\" src=\"https://sportshub.cbsistatic.com/i/r/2025/09/21/20ddee2b-b57c-4ab0-988c-df8d1da21b88/thumbnail/270x152/69838554a321fcbba55d1ef18df4e24c/wilson-getty.png\" /></figure>\n                </div>\n                    </div>\n    </a>\n<h2>Co-Defensive Players of the Year: Alanna Smith, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/wnba/teams/MIN/minnesota-lynx/\">Minnesota Lynx</a> and A'ja Wilson, Las Vegas Aces</h2><p>Smith and Wilson each received 29 votes for Defensive Player of the Year, and because the WNBA only collects one first-place vote for every award besides MVP, there was no tiebreaker. As a result, Smith and Wilson became the first players in league history to split the award. Smith was the stabilizing presence for the Lynx's league-leading defense, while Wilson almost single-handedly ensured the Aces remained competent defensively.

That has coincided with posts shared with increasing frequency on Pearl's own social media related to politics, the war in Gaza, his Jewish heritage and his support of President Donald Trump.</p><p>Pearl on Monday swatted down those rumors of an imminent political run, at least for now, in announcing his retirement as basketball coach. His son, Steven, will take over. The elder Pearl will transition into an ambassador's role in the athletic department as special assistant to the athletic director. </p>\n<a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-basketball/news/bruce-pearl-retires-auburn-coach-abruptly-steps-down-after-11-year-tenure-greatest-run-in-program-history/\" target=\"_blank\">\n        <div>\n            <div>\n                <p>Bruce Pearl retires: Auburn coach abruptly steps down after 11-year tenure, greatest run in program history</p>\n                <p>\n                    Matt Norlander                </p>\n            </div>\n                            <div>\n    <figure><img alt=\"Bruce Pearl retires: Auburn coach abruptly steps down after 11-year tenure, greatest run in program history\" src=\"https://sportshub.cbsistatic.com/i/r/2025/09/22/38d18c87-c5f4-4439-b57a-2bf4be4212cf/thumbnail/270x152/55c5d03e944c8cd58381be5a5766ec3d/gettyimages-2208720252-2.jpg\" /></figure>\n                </div>\n                    </div>\n    </a>\n<p>In a 14-minute long <a href=\"https://x.com/AuburnMBB/status/1970193906194112685\" target=\"_blank\">video shared by Auburn on Monday</a>, Pearl simply concluded: \"It's time.\"</p><p>\"Auburn is our home. … Many of you know that I thought and prayed about maybe running for the United States Senate maybe to be the next great senator from the state of Alabama. That would've required leaving Auburn. Instead, the university has given me an opportunity to stay here and be Auburn's senator.\"</p><h2>Political aspirations</h2><p>Sources tell CBS Sports that Pearl did indeed strongly consider running for the open senate seat in Alabama, which he has purposely chosen not to refute this summer. Had he ran, sources said, his plan was to hand the keys to Auburn's kingdom off to Steven. </p>\n<p>A report from the <span><a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-basketball/news/auburns-bruce-pearl-unlikely-to-run-for-senator-but-doesnt-see-himself-coaching-much-longer/\" target=\"_blank\">Jewish Insider earlier this month</a></span> indicated he spent the summer meeting with campaign operatives and Republicans weighing a run at the senate seat, and that he was giving himself until the end of September before deciding. At the time, the report said, he was \"leaning against it.\"</p><p>\"I have not answered the question because I've never announced I was running for senate, have I?\" Pearl said at the Mike Slive Foundation's Blue Shoe Ball, via <a href=\"https://www.al.com/auburnbasketball/2025/09/is-bruce-pearl-considering-a-run-for-the-us-senate-heres-what-he-said.html\" target=\"_blank\">AL.com</a>, earlier this month. \"So, how do you answer the question whether you are or whether you aren't because I never said I was.\"</p><p>He later added: \"It's something I thought a great deal about, but obviously I'm here today and I'm in practice and I've got practice tomorrow.\"</p>\n<p>Pearl, perhaps intentionally, did not squash the idea of a political future in his announcement Monday. He instead said his new role will allow him to be \"Auburn's senator.\"</p><h2>Why now?</h2><p>With 42 days until the season-opener, Auburn has next to no time to stage a national search should it have even wanted to find a Pearl successor not in the family's direct bloodline. And as Associate Head Coach, Steven's elevation -- especially given the timing -- is a no-brainer.</p><p>The timing seems to be strategic for the elder Pearl -- a deadline for the senate run is coming soon -- to say nothing about the season starting in less than two months. Auburn's hand is forced. This is not a unique move, either. <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-basketball/teams/UVA/virginia-cavaliers/\">Virginia</a> coach Tony Bennett last October abruptly retired, giving the program no choice but to elevate Ron Sanchez.</p>\n<p>Former <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-basketball/teams/WISC/wisconsin-badgers/\">Wisconsin</a> coach Bo Ryan also retired abruptly in 2015 in a rare mid-season decision. The move allowed for long-time Badgers assistant Greg Gard to take over.</p><p>At Auburn, this arrangement allows the best of both worlds for all parties it appears: Steven will take over and relieve Auburn of any duties to find a successor, and Bruce will remain close.</p><h2>Pearl's legacy</h2><p>Pearl steps down as the winningest coach in Auburn men's basketball history with 232 victories. He guided the program to two Final Fours (2019 and 2025), five SEC championships and six NCAA Tournament appearances since taking over in 2014. The decision ends what was a more than four-decade long run as coach accounting for assistant coaching roles. </p>\n<p>He finishes with a 706-268 record across stops at <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-basketball/teams/SOINDI/southern-indiana-screaming-eagles/\">Southern Indiana</a>, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-basketball/teams/MILW/wisconsinmilwaukee-panthers/\">Milwaukee</a>, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-basketball/teams/TENN/tennessee-volunteers/\">Tennessee</a> and Auburn. (Of those, 12 wins were vacated by the NCAA.)</p><p>The next stop? It might just be the Basketball Hall of Fame. Only 72 coaches have eclipsed 700 career wins (although, again, officially, he finishes at 694). That ranks No. 11 among active Division I head coaches in career wins and 41st all-time.</p><p>Other accolades include:</p><ul><li>Sixth-most SEC men's basketball championships in conference history</li><li>Top-five all-time among SEC coaches in overall victories behind Adolph Rupp, Billy Donovan, Dale Brown and John Calipari</li><li>Led Auburn to school-record 32 wins in 2024-25; Auburn was ranked No. 1 for eight consecutive weeks and earned NCAA Tournament's No. 1 overall seed for first time </li></ul>\n            </div>"

And he might have added reason to try pushing the rock at home, with several key players banged up in the Lions' defensive backfield, including ball-hawking safety <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/2961816/kerby-joseph/\">Kerby Joseph</a> (knee) and top cover corner <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/2261288/d-j-reed/\">D.J.

But Hopkins has already proven remarkably clutch as a deep-ball artist for Lamar Jackson, scoring twice on just four catches and securing all four of his targets. He may be best served as a situational option at age 33, but D-Hop also just looks refreshed while operating downfield. Working against a bruised Lions secondary, he could have more opportunities to serve as a sort of closer for Baltimore's passing attack, whether on third down or in the red zone.</p>\n<h2>Ravens vs. Lions prediction, pick</h2>\n<p>Two years ago, these two heavyweights met in a late-October clash in Baltimore, and the Ravens ran away with it, rolling to a 38-6 victory that had many questioning whether Dan Campbell's Lions were really on the ascent. Jackson was near-perfect in that matchup, tossing three scores and rushing for a fourth, while Goff hurled a whopping 53 passes while trying -- and failing -- to keep up.</p><p>We're not counting on that kind of lopsided affair this time around. That's mostly due to the remaining questions on Baltimore's defense, which was ill-prepared to hold a Week 1 lead against Buffalo and is now without a pair of front-seven tentpoles in Madubuike and Van Noy. Their absences alone should enable the Lions to properly establish the run and set up Goff's play-action shots to St. Brown, Williams and tight end <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/3124197/sam-laporta/\">Sam LaPorta</a>.</p><p>That said, this game is still on the Ravens' turf. Baltimore is 35-16 at home since Jackson took over as the full-timer in 2019. And Jackson remains in MVP form as the do-it-all centerpiece of his squad. Monday's matchup might require him to don his cape down the stretch, but we've seen him do it before, and we expect to see it again. <em><strong>Pick: Ravens 28, Lions 26 | Lions +4.5, Over 53.5</strong></em></p>\n            </div>"

The Ravens are 4.5-point favorites over the Lions.</p><p>Monday's matchup figures, on paper, to be a shootout. Detroit and Baltimore rank first and second, respectively, in scoring offense and total offense since the start of the 2023 season. The teams combined for 93 points, nine passing touchdowns and zero interceptions in Week 2.</p><p>Baltimore is just the 13th team in league history to have scored 40-plus points in each of its first two games. (The other 12 teams, however, were 2-0.) <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/2239671/lamar-jackson/\">Lamar Jackson</a> has had a rare start to the year. He is the fifth quarterback over the last 20 seasons to have at least seven total touchdowns and zero turnovers over the first two games. The previous four quarterbacks to have pulled off that feat won the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://cbssports.com/nfl/\">NFL</a> MVP award.</p><p>Meanwhile, Detroit is coming off a 52-21 blowout of Chicago. That was tied for the second-most points scored in a game in Lions history and was the team's third 50-point game in the last two seasons. For comparison, they had three 50-point games over the franchise's first 94 seasons. </p><p>In that game quarterback <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/2061053/jared-goff/\">Jared Goff</a> completed 23-of-28 passes for 334 yards and five touchdowns and zero interceptions.

This will be the sixth straight year without a playoff appearance for the Nationals (64-92), who haven't made the postseason since winning the World Series in 2019.

Skattebo is coming off his best game as a pro after rushing for 60 yards and a touchdown on 10 carries while also catching six passes for 61 yards.</p><p>Skattebo was one of the lone bright spots for New York during its third consecutive loss to open the 2025 season. He has also been one of the breakout stars among the running backs in this rookie class. Skattebo and  <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/WAS/washington-commanders/\">Washington Commanders</a> running back Jacory Croskey-Merritt are tied for the most rushing touchdowns (two) among rookies. He also ranks first in receiving yards (87) and third in catches (10) among running backs in his class.</p>\n<p>Ahead of the draft, there wasn't a skill position group talked about more than the running backs. Six players at the position were taken within the first 100 picks -- including two in the first round (<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/28874008/ashton-jeanty/\">Ashton Jeanty</a> to the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/LV/las-vegas-raiders/\">Las Vegas Raiders</a> and <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/28908905/omarion-hampton/\">Omarion Hampton</a> to the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/LAC/los-angeles-chargers/\">Los Angeles Chargers</a>). </p><p>Through the first three weeks of the season, both of those players have shown flashes. Hampton is coming off his best game as a pro, with 70 yards rushing and a touchdown, while Jeanty rumbled for a career-high 63 yards in a loss to the Commanders in Week 3.</p>\n<p>However, it's the player who was selected in the fourth round (No. 105 overall) who appears to be poised to take on a larger role than anyone in his class at the position moving forward. After carrying the ball just twice for -3 yards against Washington in Week 1, Skattebo has racked up 180 yards of total offense in the last two weeks.</p>\n<h2>Skattebo's journey to the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://cbssports.com/nfl/\">NFL</a> was unconventional</h2><p>Before Skattebo was scoring touchdowns and doing backflips on Sunday Night Football, <span><a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/news/how-arizona-states-cam-skattebo-rose-from-unheralded-recruit-to-nick-sabans-favorite-college-football-player/\" target=\"_blank\">he was once an unheralded high school recruit.</a></span> Skattebo played at Rio Linda High School, located just north of California's capital city of Sacramento. He had just one Division I offer -- from his hometown school of Sacramento State -- despite an electrifying career in high school. Skattebo ran for 3,550 yards and 45 touchdowns during his junior season, helping his team win a state championship in 2018.</p><p>Shortly after Skattebo's high school career ended, he committed to Sacramento State, but getting on the field right away wasn't in the cards. Sac State canceled its 2020 season amid the COVID-19 pandemic, and Skattebo started the following season buried on the two-deep depth chart.</p>\n<p>Skattebo became a household name at the FCS level the following season, rushing for 1,372 yards and seven touchdowns. He won Big Sky Offensive Player of the Year and helped Sac State finish with a program-best 12-1 record. He entered the transfer portal days after Sac State's season ended and eventually transferred to Arizona State, where his national profile grew tenfold. </p><p>During the 2024 campaign, Skattebo finished in the top five of Heisman Trophy voting and helped Arizona State reach the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://cbssports.com/college-football/\">College Football</a> Playoff for the first time in program history.</p><h2>How does Skattebo compare to other RBs in his class?</h2><p>The early returns on running backs from the 2025 draft class aren't ideal, but there is still plenty of time for that to change. With Washington running back <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/2820090/austin-ekeler/\">Austin Ekeler</a> suffering a season-ending injury earlier this month, it opened the door for Croskey-Merritt to get more touches.</p>\n<p>In his two games, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/CLE/cleveland-browns/\">Browns</a> running back <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/28878286/quinshon-judkins/\">Quinshon Judkins</a> leads all rookie running backs in yards, while Jeanty is second. <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/DEN/denver-broncos/\">Denver Broncos</a> running back <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/3121207/rj-harvey/\">RJ Harvey</a> has been splitting time in the backfield with veteran <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/2804420/j-k-dobbins/\">J.K.

Its attractiveness as a landing spot on the coaching carousel figures to pale in comparison to other schools.</p><p>For instance, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/teams/SC/south-carolina-gamecocks/\">South Carolina</a> coach Shane Beamer -- the son of Virginia Tech legend Frank Beamer -- <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/news/virginia-tech-coaching-search-shane-beamer-michael-vick-not-viewed-as-legitimate-candidates-for-hokies-job/\">is not viewed as a legitimate candidate</a>. Beamer is set to make $8.1 million annually with the Gamecocks, which is nearly 40% more than what Pry earned at Virginia Tech.</p>\n<p>\"The landscape of intercollegiate athletics nationwide has evolved dramatically over the past year,\" <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/college-sports/story/_/id/46346630/virginia-tech-proposes-adding-extra-229m-athletics-budget\" target=\"_blank\">Virginia Tech said in a statement to ESPN</a>. \"The gap between top-tier programs and all other programs has widened. Without additional investment, the university and the region risk declining revenues. Potential losses to existing university revenues such as media rights, ticket sales, and sponsorships, for example, would likely have a negative impact on non-revenue sports, brand value, and alumni connection.\"</p><p><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://knightnewhousedata.org/fbs/acc\">According to the Knight Commission</a>, Virginia Tech spent $132.8 million on athletics in 2024, which ranked seventh out of the eight publicly available budgets in the ACC. Conference blue bloods <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/teams/CLEM/clemson-tigers/\">Clemson</a> ($181.9 million) and <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/teams/FSU/florida-state-seminoles/\">Florida State</a> ($169.8 million) spent tens of millions more than the Hokies.</p><p>The Virginia Tech board estimates $156.8 million in athletic department operating expenses for fiscal year 2026 and seeks to elevate that spending to $190.1. Additional investments over the following three years project to give the Hokies an expense budget of $212.1 million by fiscal year 2029.</p>\n<p>Virginia Tech's proposal includes four funding sources: institutional support, a $100 per year increase to student fees, bridge funding and philanthropy.</p>\n            </div>"

    "body": "<div>\n        <p><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/28909849/travis-hunter/\">Travis Hunter</a> was one of the rarest and most exciting draft prospects in the recent history of the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://cbssports.com/nfl/\">NFL</a>. </p><p>An All-American and Heisman Trophy winner, Hunter caught 96 passes for 1,258 yards and 15 touchdowns during his junior season at Colorado, winning the Biletnikoff Award as the nation's best wide receiver. He also picked up 36 combined tackles, four interceptions and 11 pass breakups on his way to winning Big 12 Defensive Player of the Year and the Bednarik Award as the nation's top defender. </p><p>Hunter played an incredible 1,529 total snaps on offense and defense, splitting them with 753 on offense and 776 on defense, according to Pro Football Focus. Those figures represented 86.4% of the team's offensive snaps and 82.7% of the team's defensive snaps. It was practically unheard of, and it made him an extremely coveted prospect in the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://cbssports.com/nfl/draft/\">NFL draft</a>. So coveted, in fact, that the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/JAC/jacksonville-jaguars/\">Jacksonville Jaguars</a> traded up from No. 5 overall to No. 2, sacrificing the Nos. 5, 36 and 126 selections, along with a 2026 first-round pick, for the right to draft Hunter, as well as the 104th and 200th overall picks.</p><p>All throughout the summer, there was relentless speculation about how the Jaguars would use Hunter. How much would he play on offense? How much would he play on defense? What would his actual role be on both sides of the ball? Would they even use him on both sides? Was that actually possible? Beat writers in Jacksonville tracked his practice snaps every day to try to get an idea of what, exactly, the Jags were thinking.</p>\n<p>Through the first three weeks of the 2025 season, we actually have some idea. Thanks to Pro-Football-Reference, we know his snap rates on both sides of the ball, as well as his total statistical contributions to date.</p><table><tbody><tr><th>Week</th><th>Off %</th><th>Def %</th><th>Tgt</th><th>Rec</th><th>Yds</th><th>Tkl</th><th>PBU</th></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>63.6%</td><td>9.4%</td><td>8</td><td>6</td><td>33</td><td>1</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>2</td><td>59.2%</td><td>62.3%</td><td>6</td><td>3</td><td>22</td><td>2</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>3</td><td>52.9%</td><td>68.3%</td><td>2</td><td>1</td><td>21</td><td>6</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><th>Total</th><th>59%</th><th>47%</th><th>16</th><th>10</th><th>76</th><th>9</th><th>1</th></tr></tbody></table><p>Hunter has not played more than 68.3% of the snaps on either side of the ball, a rate that is obviously a far cry from where he was during college. His offensive snap rate has also gone down with each passing week as he has played more defensive snaps.</p><p>Some of this is explainable. Jaguars cornerback <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/3126303/jarrian-jones/\">Jarrian Jones</a> got injured in Week 2 and has played a combined 26 snaps over the last two weeks. With a cornerback out, the Jags have needed Hunter to play more often on that side of the ball. With <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/2965973/dyami-brown/\">Dyami Brown</a> and <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/3168820/parker-washington/\">Parker Washington</a> available to take more snaps offensively, they could afford to cut his snap rate on offense while using him more on defense.</p>\n<p>But the entire theory of Hunter was that he could be close to a full-time player on both offense and defense. </p><p>That's what made him so special. If he's just going to be a part-time player on both sides, or a part-time player on offense and barely a factor on defense like he was in Week 1, then the value the Jaguars gave up to go get him isn't there. They need to use him more often to justify the price they paid. </p><p>Of course, that just might not be possible -- as many people in and around the league speculated around draft time. There's a big difference between playing 80% or more of the snaps on both sides in college and doing it in the NFL. Even if Hunter has the physical stamina to do it (which, again, is harder in the NFL), the mental aspect of things is far more taxing, and so is the pure play strength aspect -- especially for a player his size.</p>\n<p>There's also been an issue to date with how the Jaguars are actually using him, particularly on offense, where he's essentially been a gadget player and not an actual wide receiver. Hunter's average depth of target, per Tru Media, is just 6.56 yards. That ranks 59th out of the 65 wide receivers who have run 75 or more routes so far this year. </p><p>His average route has had a break at 7.71 yards, which ranks 53rd among the same group of players, so it's not like he's only being targeted on his short routes. He's really only running short routes to begin with. As a result, he has just one gain of 15 or more yards on the season, and he's created a first down on only 2.5% of his routes and 12.5% of his targets -- figures that rank 62nd and 64th, respectively, out of that aforementioned group of 65 wide receivers.</p>\n<p>Of course, it's far too early to draw any conclusions about Hunter's usage, or even about the trade just yet. </p>\n<p>Hunter is only three weeks into his career, after all. The Jaguars could just be ramping him up to play more often rather than having him out there for a full complement of snaps right away. And that would probably be a smart thing. You don't want to physically tax him too much right away and have him break down before you even get a chance to use him in the way he should be used. </p><p>But the Jags do need to figure out better ways to get more out of him. The defensive usage makes sense. Hunter was an outside corner in college and he's been used that way in the pros, particularly filling in for the injured Jones as the left corner. </p><p>But the offensive usage is not conducive to getting the most out of his skill set, even when you consider that he was rawer as a receiver than as a defensive back coming out of college. You have to be able to stretch the field vertically every so often instead of using him only around the line of scrimmage. Otherwise, defenses are just going to sit on the short stuff and even start taking away some of his run-after-catch opportunities. Considering that's been the only way he's made positive contributions on offense to date, it obviously wouldn't be ideal if that stuff went away.</p>\n            </div>"

Here's all you need to know ahead of Monday's ceremony: </p><p><em>The world's best soccer players will be honored at the 2025 Ballon d'Or in Paris on Monday. Golazo Network will begin with red carpet coverage at 2 p.m. ET followed by the ceremony at 3 p.m. ET which will feature CBS Sports' own Kate Scott as a host.</em></p><h2>How to watch the 2025 Ballon d'Or ceremony </h2><ul><li><strong>Date:</strong> Monday, Sept. 22 | <strong>Time:</strong> <em>Red Carpet: </em>2 p.m. ET; <em>Ceremony</em>: 3 p.m. ET</li><li><strong>Location:</strong> Theatre du Chatelet -- Paris, France</li><li><strong>Watch:</strong> <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/watch/cbs-sports-golazo-network?ftag=CBS-03-10ade4e\" target=\"_blank\">CBS Sports Golazo Network</a> and <a href=\"https://www.paramountplus.com/?cbscidmt=sports&ftag=PPM-03-10ahh3j\" target=\"_blank\">Paramount+</a></li></ul><h2>Voting system: How does it work? </h2><p>The voting system is based on three factors: individual performances, team achievements and career. A panel of 100 sports journalists for the men's award and 50 for the women's select their top 10 picks for each award. Each spot in the top 10 earns a specific number of points that are then tallied.</p>\n<ol><li>15 points</li><li>12 points</li><li>10 points</li><li>8 points</li><li>7 points</li><li>5 points</li><li>4 points</li><li>3 points </li><li>2 points </li><li>1 point</li></ol><p>Additionally, the Kopa Trophy, awarded to the best young player, has a different voting system with a jury made up of former Ballon d'Or winners. </p><h2>All the categories </h2><p>The 2025 edition's biggest change is the total parity between men and women trophies. All the awards will be presented to both men and women with no differences. Let's take a look at all the prizes that will be awarded in Paris: </p><ul><li>Men's Ballon d'Or (best male player, 2024-25 season)</li><li>Women's Ballon d'Or (best female player, 2024-25 season)</li><li>Men's Kopa Trophy (best male U21 player)</li><li>Women's Kopa Trophy (best female young player)</li><li>Men's Yashin Trophy (best male goalkeeper)</li><li>Women's Yashin Trophy (best female goalkeeper)</li><li>Men's Gerd Müller Trophy (top male goalscorer for club/national team)</li><li>Women's Gerd Müller Trophy (top female goalscorer)</li><li>Men's Johan Cruyff Trophy (best male coach, club/national team)</li><li>Women's Johan Cruyff Trophy (best female coach)</li><li>Men's Club of the Year Trophy</li><li>Women's Club of the Year Trophy</li><li>Socrates Award </li></ul><h2>What happened in 2024?</h2><p>The 2024 edition of the Ballon d'Or was deeply affected by <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/soccer/news/ballon-dor-winners-rodri-edges-vini-jr-as-real-madrid-pull-off-no-show-aitana-bonmati-goes-back-to-back/live/\" target=\"_blank\">what happened with Real Madrid</a> as the Spanish side's delegation decided not to attend the ceremony once it emerged that Rodri would become City's first-ever Ballon d'Or winner, creating a lot of noise around the event especially as they were awarded as Team of the Year and Carlo Ancelotti was also named as Coach of the Year. The team owned by Spanish businessman Florentino Perez publicly expressed disagreements with how French Football handled the ceremony and awards, and issued a statement saying that \"if the award criteria doesn't give it to Vinicius as the winner, then those same criteria should point to Carvajal as the winner. As this was not the case, it is clear that Ballon d'Or-Uefa does not respect Real Madrid. And Real Madrid does not go where it is not respected.\"</p>\n<h2>Will Dembele attend the event?</h2><p>The likely winner of the 2025 edition might not attend the event on Monday, as PSG's away match against Olympique Marseille was <a href=\"https://x.com/PSG_inside/status/1969808655764824280\" target=\"_blank\">postponed</a> to the same day due to storms forecasted in the region on Sunday. According to multiple reports, Dembele's presence at the Theatre du Chatelet is in doubt even if he's currently injured and he's not expected to play the match against Roberto De Zerbi's side. Especially after what happened last year with Real Madrid, the nominees won't know who won the award until Monday at the awards, which would make the presence of Dembele even more crucial. Though on Monday morning CBS Sports' Guillem Balague revealed he expected them to be there.</p>\n<h2>2025 Men's Ballon d'Or nominees</h2><p>Jude Bellingham (England, Real Madrid)<br />Ousmane Dembélé

The best thing Kobe Bryant did on a basketball court was score, and LeBron, from both a raw number and especially an efficiency standpoint, is a better scorer than Kobe.  </p><table><tbody><tr><th>CAREER PPG \t\t\t\t</th><th>REGULAR SEASON \t\t\t\t</th><th>POSTSEASON \t\t\t\t</th></tr><tr><td><p>LeBron James \t\t\t\t</p></td><td><p>27.0 \t\t\t\t</p></td><td><p>28.4 \t\t\t\t</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Kobe Bryant \t\t\t\t</p></td><td><p>25.0 \t\t\t\t</p></td><td><p>25.6 \t\t\t\t</p></td></tr></tbody></table><p>Now add to this the fact that Kobe was a career 44% shooter in both the regular and postseason, while LeBron is at 50% in the regular season and 49% in the playoffs. Again, this isn't an argument even if you whittle it down to just scoring, where Kobe is at least a fellow all-time great.  </p><p>After that, it's not even close. LeBron is bigger. Stronger. Faster. He's a better rebounder, passer and defender (even if you want to make the on-ball argument on behalf of prime Kobe the difference would be slight, with the versatility and interior strength factors easily swinging the needle to LeBron's side of the ledger).  </p><p>It is not an exaggeration to say there isn't one single thing Bryant did on a basketball court better than LeBron, who, just as an aside, has also been a <em>far</em> superior performer in the biggest moment. That's right. Just because Kobe felt inclined to align himself with one of the deadliest snakes on earth doesn't mean he was actually some sort of clutch killer. Quite the contrary, in fact.  </p><p>For his career, Kobe made 34.5% of his shots to either tie or take the lead in the final two minutes of the fourth quarter or overtime, including both the regular and postseason -- not even close to LeBron's 44.8%.  </p><p>Want to take it to the final minute of playoff games?  </p><ul><li><strong>LeBron James: </strong>46%</li><li><strong>Kobe Bryant: </strong>27%</li></ul><p>How about the final 30 seconds?  </p><ul><li><strong>LeBron James:</strong> 40%</li><li><strong>Kobe Bryant: </strong>26%</li></ul><p>Nine times in his career LeBron has made a shot to give his team the lead inside the final 24 seconds of the fourth quarter or overtime of a playoff game, and he has done so at a 41% clip. Kobe, by contrast, hit five of these shots over the course of his career ... at a 29% clip.  </p><p>Get this: From the beginning of the 2003-04 season through the start of the 2009-10 season, a five-plus year sample taken smack dab from the middle of his prime, Kobe jacked up a league-high 56 potential game-winning shots (defined by <a href=\"https://82games.com/gamewinningshots.htm\" target=\"_blank\">82games.com</a> as inside of 24 seconds with a chance to give the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nba/teams/LAL/los-angeles-lakers/\">Lakers</a> the lead). He made 14 of them. That's a 25% clip. Well below league average (29%), and even farther below LeBron's 34% clip.  </p>\n<p>The fact is, Kobe's so called clutch prowess was, and is, <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/blog/truehoop/post/_/id/24200/the-truth-about-kobe-bryant-in-crunch-time\" target=\"_blank\">based much more in reputation than reality</a>, as is the idea that he's in the conversation for greatest player ever, which some people insist he is. It doesn't mean he wasn't great. Perhaps one of the 10 greatest ever, depending on your taste. But he's nowhere near LeBron's class. Save your breath for the actual reasonable arguments.  </p><h2> \t<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nba/players/1685204/stephen-curry/\">Stephen Curry</a> </h2><p>Our panel unanimously voted Curry as the second-best player of the century. Again, this one shouldn't be a real debate. The offensive impact isn't close, but you can bet there are a lot of irate Kobe stumpers screaming \"last I checked defense matters!\" at the top of their lungs right now.  </p><p>Those people, mind you, are right. Defense does matter. And this element notwithstanding, prime Curry was -- and frankly current Curry might still be -- a more impactful player than Kobe ever was.  </p><p>Consider the following: </p><ul><li>Curry's career Win Shares average -- calculated as the sum of a player's offensive and defensive value -- is higher than Kobe's in both the regular and postseason. </li></ul><ul><li>Five times Curry has posted at least a 7.0 total box plus-minus (another sum of offensive and defensive impact) over a single postseason. Kobe did it three times. </li></ul><ul><li>Curry's career playoff point differential, to this point, is plus-975. Kobe's was plus-557, and in damn near half of his playoff games (91 out of 200) he finished with a negative plus-minus. That has only happened to Curry in a third of his playoff games. </li></ul><p>This postseason distinction is important, because the perception of Kobe is that he was some sort of big-stage god while Curry has, in the distorted eyes of some, shrunk from some of these moments. None of this is true in the slightest.  </p>\n<table><tbody><tr><th>CAREER PLAYOFF AVERAGES \t\t\t\t</th><th>PPG \t\t\t\t</th><th>TS% \t\t\t\t</th></tr><tr><td><p>Stephen Curry \t\t\t\t</p></td><td><p>26.8 \t\t\t\t</p></td><td><p>60.8 \t\t\t\t</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Kobe Bryant \t\t\t\t</p></td><td><p>25.6 \t\t\t\t</p></td><td><p>54.1 \t\t\t\t</p></td></tr></tbody></table><p>As you can see, Curry has been a better raw playoff scorer, on far greater efficiency mind you, than Kobe, and the same can be said of their respective stat lines on the biggest stage. Check the tale of the Finals tape (Kobe played in seven Finals to Curry's six, so it's a similar sample): </p><table><tbody><tr><th>CAREER FINALS AVERAGES \t\t\t\t</th><th>PPG \t\t\t\t</th><th>APG \t\t\t\t</th><th>RPG \t\t\t\t</th><th>TS% \t\t\t\t</th><th>+/- \t\t\t\t</th></tr><tr><td><p>Stephen Curry \t\t\t\t</p></td><td><p>27.3 \t\t\t\t</p></td><td><p>6.0 \t\t\t\t</p></td><td><p>5.8 \t\t\t\t</p></td><td><p>59.5 \t\t\t\t</p></td><td><p>+138 \t\t\t\t</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Kobe Bryant \t\t\t\t</p></td><td><p>25.3 \t\t\t\t</p></td><td><p>5.1 \t\t\t\t</p></td><td><p>5.7 \t\t\t\t</p></td><td><p>50.7 \t\t\t\t</p></td><td><p>+36 \t\t\t\t</p></td></tr></tbody></table><p>If you want to take it to the regular-season averages, it's still a dead heat (25.0 PPG for Kobe vs. 24.7 PPG for Curry) in raw numbers with the efficiency, again, registering as a Curry blowout.  </p><p>Consider than the highest number of shots per game that Curry has attempted for any single season in his career is 21.7, which was Kobe's <em>average </em>over his 13 highest-volume campaigns. Three times Curry has put up at least 20 shots per game in his career; Kobe did it 13 times. Do not confuse shooting more with being a better scorer.  </p>\n<p>Hell, for the duration of their respective careers Curry has been a better playoff rebounder than Kobe from both a per game and percentage standpoint (for those of you who were about to argue the pace case). Curry has also accounted for more playoff assists per game. All of which is why Curry's career postseason PER and Game Score are both higher than Kobe's.  </p><p>If we go to their respective peaks, Kobe never put together a season like the one Curry did in 2015-16 when he led the league at 30.1 PPG on 50/45/91 shooting splits. The guy made an <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://cbssports.com/nba/\">NBA</a> record 402 3-pointers at a 45% clip en route to the only unanimous MVP award in history and Curry's second straight.  </p><p>Kobe, by contrast, won one MVP. They both won two scoring titles, but when Curry scored 30.1 PPG in 2015-16 he did so in a little over 34 minutes and 20 shots per game. In both of Kobe's scoring-title seasons, he played 41 minutes per game and attempted a hefty 25 shots on average. You get the point. Kobe shot A LOT. And he needed to. And he was a great scorer. Just not as great as Steph has been and truly still is.  </p><p>But to me, the most overwhelming evidence in Curry's favor as the superior player between the two is Golden State's 2022 championship. That was not a championship roster (<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nba/players/2135571/andrew-wiggins/\">Andrew Wiggins</a> was the only other All-Star and arguably the second best player).  </p><p>Yes, Kobe has five total titles to Curry's four, but he never won a title with as much responsibility as Curry had on that 2022 team. Not even close. He had Shaq for the first three and Pau Gasol -- All-NBA in 2009 and 2010 -- for the last two. This isn't to knock any of Kobe's titles. It's incredibly difficult to win it all without a second All-NBA guy. The ones that have been able to do so this century without that luxury stand out. Curry is on that list. Kobe isn't. It's the final gavel on an argument that by pretty much any unbiased standard swings in Curry's favor.  </p><h2> Tim Duncan </h2><p>This is where most people think things really start to get debatable, and at first glance I get it. Kobe and Duncan is a tough call. They're all tough calls from here on out. For starters, the bullet points of the respective resumes looking strikingly similar.  </p><table><tbody><tr><th>TALE OF THE TAPE \t\t\t\t</th><th>TITLES \t\t\t\t</th><th>MVP(s) \t\t\t\t</th><th>All-NBA \t\t\t\t</th><th>All-Defense \t\t\t\t</th></tr><tr><td><p>Tim Duncan \t\t\t\t</p></td><td><p>5 \t\t\t\t</p></td><td><p>2 \t\t\t\t</p></td><td><p>15 \t\t\t\t</p></td><td><p>15 \t\t\t\t</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Kobe Bryant \t\t\t\t</p></td><td><p>5 \t\t\t\t</p></td><td><p>1 \t\t\t\t</p></td><td><p>15 \t\t\t\t</p></td><td><p>12 \t\t\t\t</p></td></tr></tbody></table><p>In what could, on the surface, feel like a coin flip, it seems to me that Kobe's charisma both on and off the court, when measured against Duncan's relatively boring persona and game, swings this debate in Bryant's favor. But we aren't going to do the style-points thing.  </p><p>We also won't be lending even an ounce of weight to this \"<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nba/teams/SA/san-antonio-spurs/\">Spurs</a> system\" nonsense. For starters, Kobe played in arguably the single-most romanticized system in history in the Triangle and he did so alongside other superstars and the winningest coach of all time, so it's not as if he was bereft of institutional support.   </p><p>And besides that, Duncan <em>was</em> the Spurs' system. Or culture. Or however you want to phrase your euphemistic insinuation that Duncan's greatness was a product of his environment rather than the other way around. It's no different than Curry and the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nba/teams/GS/golden-state-warriors/\">Warriors</a> or Tom Brady and the Patriots. Without these guys, there is no system. </p><p>And so, with this understanding that the Spurs' dynasty was disproportionately due to Duncan, let us begin with the number 50 -- as in no Duncan team, over the course of his 19-year career, finished with fewer than 50 wins other than the 1998-99 team that went 37-13 and won the championship in a lockout-shortened season.  </p>\n<p>That is honestly mind blowing. Do you get how hard it is to win 50 games in an NBA season? It is no small feat. And Duncan literally never experienced anything less. Kobe's teams, meanwhile, finished with 45 or fewer wins seven times (not counting two shortened seasons) and 35 or fewer four times. We all understand the decline of Kobe's supporting cast over periods of his career, but if anything, it's another feather in Duncan's cap that he never ran his top running mate out of town.  </p><p>Either way, these are mid-career and end-of-career lows that Duncan, a top-12 MVP finisher in three of his last four seasons, never had. By contrast, as admirable as it was for Bryant to come back from the Achilles tear, he fell off considerably at the end. Over his final two seasons, Kobe shot 37% and 36% overall. By that point Kobe was just jacking up a lot of bad shots on even worse teams and getting courtesy fan-vote All-Star nods despite playing in just six games in 2013-14 and 35 games the year after that.  </p><p>I also want to address the defense. Yes, Kobe was a great defender in his prime, but he fell off appreciably and benefited from a number of reputation-based All-Defense nods over the latter half of his career. Moreover, you simply can't have the kind of defensive impact as a 6-foot-6 wing as you can as a seven-foot rim protector. Duncan was a defensive system unto himself. It's the same reason that Shaq was actually a more important defender than Kobe for those Lakers teams (which we'll get into shortly).</p><p>Bottom line: While the traditional markers of career accomplishment look extremely similar between Duncan and Kobe, Duncan was a more impactful defender and a more consistent winner. He was the better player early (fifth in MVP voting as a rookie) and the better player at the end of their careers (10th in MVP voting in his penultimate season). Reasonable minds can disagree here, but the most objective signs mostly point to Duncan over Kobe.  </p><h2> Shaquille O'Neal </h2><p>Another razor-thin call, but for me, it's really this simple: When Shaq and Kobe were playing on the same team, which one did opposing teams worry about more? The answer is definitively Shaq, who had teams employing lines of big men whose sole responsibility was to spend six fouls each trying, in vein, to marginally disrupt the dominance of an ultimately immovable object.  </p><p>Three times the Lakers won titles with Shaq and Kobe and Shaq was the Finals MVP all three times. The stats weren't even close.  </p><table><tbody><tr><th>2000 FINALS \t\t\t\t</th><th>PPG \t\t\t\t</th><th>RPG \t\t\t\t</th><th>TS% \t\t\t\t</th></tr><tr><td><p>Shaquille O'Neal \t\t\t\t</p></td><td><p>38.0 \t\t\t\t</p></td><td><p>16.7 \t\t\t\t</p></td><td><p>57.6 \t\t\t\t</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Kobe Bryant \t\t\t\t</p></td><td><p>15.6 \t\t\t\t</p></td><td><p>4.6 \t\t\t\t</p></td><td><p>41.1 \t\t\t\t</p></td></tr></tbody></table><table><tbody><tr><th>2001 FINALS \t\t\t\t</th><th>PPG \t\t\t\t</th><th>RPG \t\t\t\t</th><th>TS% \t\t\t\t</th></tr><tr><td><p>Shaquille O'Neal \t\t\t\t</p></td><td><p>33.8 \t\t\t\t</p></td><td><p>15.8 \t\t\t\t</p></td><td><p>57.5 \t\t\t\t</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Kobe Bryant \t\t\t\t</p></td><td><p>24.6 \t\t\t\t</p></td><td><p>7.8 \t\t\t\t</p></td><td><p>50.1 \t\t\t\t</p></td></tr></tbody></table><table><tbody><tr><th>2002 FINALS \t\t\t\t</th><th>PPG \t\t\t\t</th><th>RPG \t\t\t\t</th><th>TS% \t\t\t\t</th></tr><tr><td><p>Shaquille O'Neal \t\t\t\t</p></td><td><p>36.3 \t\t\t\t</p></td><td><p>12.3 \t\t\t\t</p></td><td><p>63.6 \t\t\t\t</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Kobe Bryant \t\t\t\t</p></td><td><p>26.8 \t\t\t\t</p></td><td><p>58 \t\t\t\t</p></td><td><p>62.3 \t\t\t\t</p></td></tr></tbody></table><p>Even in the Finals they lost to Detroit in 2004, Shaq was far better than Kobe, who was frankly abysmal, shooting 38% for the series. It wasn't just the Finals, either. During the 3-peat. O'Neal's postseason numbers far outclass Bryant's.  </p>\n<p>The evidence for Shaq as the team's alpha runs even deeper when you get into the impact stats in the three championships seasons.  </p><p>From <a href=\"https://thinkingbasketball.net/2018/03/29/backpicks-goat-5-shaquille-oneal/\" target=\"_blank\">Thinking Basketball</a>: </p><blockquote><p>From 2000-03, [the Lakers] played 32 full-strength games without Shaq and posted a +0.4 rORtg. With him, they were an exceptional +7.3. Even his floor-raising was colossal: In 29 games <em>without</em> Kobe, Shaq's 2000 and 2001 Lakers posted a +2.8 relative offense at a 54-win pace flanked by role players (and Glen Rice for half of those games). O'Neal's game-to-game impact across his career was consistently huge and, naturally, his overall WOWY results are some of the best on record. \t</p></blockquote><p>Check out the respective ratings for the Lakers from 2000-2005, counting both the regular and postseasons, when Shaq played without Kobe and vice versa, <a href=\"https://www.pbpstats.com/wowy-combos/nba?TeamId=1610612747&Season=2004-05,2003-04,2002-03,2001-02,2000-01&SeasonType=All&PlayerIds=406,977\" target=\"_blank\">per PBP Stats</a>.  </p><table><tbody><tr><th>LAKERS LINEUPS (2000-04) \t\t\t\t</th><th>O-RTG \t\t\t\t</th><th>D-RTG \t\t\t\t</th><th>NET RTG \t\t\t\t</th></tr><tr><td><p>Shaq without Kobe \t\t\t\t</p></td><td><p>106.9 \t\t\t\t</p></td><td><p>102.6 \t\t\t\t</p></td><td><p>+4.4 \t\t\t\t</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Kobe without Shaq \t\t\t\t</p></td><td><p>101.6 \t\t\t\t</p></td><td><p>104.7 \t\t\t\t</p></td><td><p>-3.1 \t\t\t\t</p></td></tr></tbody></table><p>As you can see, the Lakers were significantly better when Shaq played without Kobe than they were when Kobe had to go it alone. And it's important to note the defense getting better, too, when Shaq was on his own. Indeed, defensive metrics are not without their flaws and are total-lineup and opponent dependent, but the general story that Kobe being a great defender and Shaq being a lazy one was more perception that reality holds true. Bottom line, Shaq's size meant more. Lazy or not.  </p><p>And by the way, this trend continued when O'Neal went to Miami (the defense playing better with him on the floor than off). In fact, all told, <a href=\"https://bleacherreport.com/articles/2851450-shaquille-oneal-vs-kobe-bryant-whos-higher-on-the-all-time-ladder\" target=\"_blank\">Andy Bailey noted for Bleacher Report</a> in 2019: \"<em>From 2000-01 to the end of Shaq's career, his teams' net ratings were </em><a href=\"https://www.basketball-reference.com/players/o/onealsh01.html#pbp::none\" target=\"_blank\"><em>7.7</em></a><em> points better when he was on the floor. Kobe's career net-rating swing is </em><a href=\"https://www.basketball-reference.com/players/b/bryanko01.html#pbp::none\" target=\"_blank\"><em>plus-5.6</em></a><em>.</em>\" </p><p>At the end of the day, both Kobe and Shaq proved capable of winning at the highest level without one another. But when they were together, Shaq was the clear No. 1. That puts him higher on this list, as well.  </p><h2> \t<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nba/players/2135542/nikola-jokic/\">Nikola Jokic</a></h2><p>OK, here's where the Kobe Stans are going to officially lose their minds. Are you kidding me? This dude with one title, who has only been an elite player for a little more than half a decade, is better than Kobe Freaking Bryant? Yes, that's what I'm saying, and the case for Jokić is pure peak performance.  </p><p>No, at this point, Jokić, at 30 years old, has not had the career longevity to even be spoken of in the same conversation as Kobe, but by the same token, Bryant, for even one season, was never as dominant as Jokic has been over the past five years.  </p>\n<p>There's an argument to be made that Kobe was actually never the best player in the world. Jokic, meanwhile, is head and tails above every other player in the world and has been for some time. He should've won the last five MVPs if voter fatigue wasn't a thing. The three he did win are already three times as many as Bryant won over a 20-year career.  </p><p>A lot of Kobe backers are going to want to pull defense card in the Jokić debate the same as they want to do with Curry, but the same story is true: The catch-all numbers tell the story. Even with defense factored in, the impact of Jokic simply means more than the impact of Kobe.  </p><p>Again, Jokić hasn't played for as long as Kobe so we're only going off peak here. For Jokić, we're going to make that his last seven years. For Kobe, we're going to measure his best 11-year sample (2001-2012). Take a look at the respective teams' point differentials per 100 possessions with each player on and off the court.  </p>\n<table><tbody><tr><th>PLAYER \t\t\t\t</th><th>ON COURT \t\t\t\t</th><th>OFF COURT \t\t\t\t</th><th>DIFFERENCE \t\t\t\t</th></tr><tr><td><p>Nikola Jokić \t\t\t\t</p></td><td><p>+7.32 \t\t\t\t</p></td><td><p>-5.29 \t\t\t\t</p></td><td><p>+12.6 \t\t\t\t</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Kobe Bryant \t\t\t\t</p></td><td><p>+5.04 \t\t\t\t</p></td><td><p>-1.60 \t\t\t\t</p></td><td><p>+6.6 \t\t\t\t</p></td></tr></tbody></table><p>I want you to focus on the on-court rating. Understand that despite Kobe playing with Shaquille O'Neal and Pau Gasol during this sample, his teams still outscored opponents by fewer points per 100 possessions than Jokić's teams even though Jokić has literally never played with another All-Star.  </p><p>Another metric to consider: Jokić's average PER over the last five seasons is 31.68. Kobe's career high was 28.0. Let me repeat that: Jokić's average PER is higher than Kobe ever reached even in his best single season. That is also true of VORP, Win Shares and Box Plus-Minus. Jokić's <em>average</em> in all these catch-all metrics is better, by far in most cases, than Kobe's career high.  </p><p>Yes, I understand that Kobe has five championships to Jokić's one, but much like Curry's 2022 title, Jokić's 2023 championship speaks higher volumes than any of the titles Kobe won with All-NBA players by his side. Again, the guys who have won titles without star sidekicks are in a pretty exclusive club. It doesn't mean all those guys are better than Kobe. Dirk Nowitzki (2011) wasn't. I don't believe Giannis Antetokoumpo (2021) is. None of the 2004 Pistons have a case. Kawhi Leonard (2019) hasn't stayed healthy long enough. But in the case of 2003 Duncan, 2022 Curry and 2023 Jokić, given the full breadth of each of their respective resumes, this kind of lone-wolf title makes a difference. </p><p>Ultimately, Jokić's efficiency and overall impact are so much greater than Bryant's ever were. If he keeps this up for another five years this won't even be a debate for anyone who has the capacity to look beyond ring counts. For now, I understand if you still believe the the full weight of Bryant's career still trumps Jokić's. I just disagree. For me, it's pretty simple: Jokić is a better player than Kobe ever was. If we were talking a couple seasons, that would be different. But the sample size is now big enough to measure relative value, even if the total number of accolades are obviously going to favor Bryant.  </p>\n            </div>"

The over/under signals expectations of a high-scoring game. Historically, Baltimore has had strong success vs. NFC opponents - Lamar Jackson in particular holds a superb record against NFC teams. Meanwhile, Detroit is showing good ATS (against the spread) numbers in road games since 2023, which suggests they might be competitive even as underdogs. </p><p>Some bettors may believe Detroit could cover the spread based on their recent offensive outburst against Chicago and the idea that Baltimore's defense is vulnerable in certain areas due to injuries to players like LB Kyle Van Noy and DT Nnamdi Madubuike. </p><p>55-60% of betting tickets are on the Ravens to cover at sportsbooks with more than 70% of total tickets on the over. More than 70% of moneyline wagers are also on the Ravens. </p><h2>Pro football on Monday night betting sites and promos</h2><p>Football on Monday night is always one of the most eagerly game broadcasts of the week, so some of the <span><a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/betting/news/sportsbook-promos/\" target=\"_blank\">best promos</a></span> from online <span><a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/betting/news/best-betting-apps/\" target=\"_blank\">sportsbooks</a></span> often coincide with the matchup.

    "body": "<div>\n        <p>Back in March, months before the season began, the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/wnba/teams/GS/golden-state-valkyries/\">Golden State Valkyries</a> became the first team in WNBA history to sell 10,000 season tickets. That was the first clear sign that the first expansion team to enter the league since 2008 had something special brewing. </p><p>Over the next six months, the Valkyries set the standard for the coming wave of expansion with an incredible debut campaign, both on and off the court. They went 23-21 to earn the No. 8 seed in the playoffs, had the Coach of the Year and the Most Improved Player and sold out every single home game at Chase Center, a.k.a Ballhalla. </p><p>The Valkyries' 23 wins were the most ever by an expansion team in its inaugural season, and they became the first expansion team to make the playoffs in its inaugural season. </p><a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/wnba/news/how-the-valkyries-created-an-unmatched-wnba-home-court-advantage-and-why-expectations-are-high-in-ballhalla/\" target=\"_blank\">\n        <div>\n            <div>\n                <p>How the Valkyries created an unmatched WNBA home-court advantage and why expectations are high in 'Ballhalla'</p>\n                <p>\n                    Jack Maloney                </p>\n            </div>\n                            <div>\n    <figure><img alt=\"How the Valkyries created an unmatched WNBA home-court advantage and why expectations are high in 'Ballhalla'\" src=\"https://sportshub.cbsistatic.com/i/r/2025/08/06/000cbd92-0d5a-435c-97e6-52ab6848d8cc/thumbnail/270x152/b6873147d785021949fce6d8301791cc/valkyries-getty.png\" /></figure>\n                </div>\n                    </div>\n    </a>\n<p>Natalie Nakase, the first coach in franchise history, built an elite defense and made the Valkyries one of the most difficult teams to play against in the league despite a lack of starpower. For her efforts, she was named COY. <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/wnba/players/28850640/veronica-burton/\">Veronica Burton</a>, who arrived from the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/wnba/teams/CT/connecticut-sun/\">Connecticut Sun</a> in the expansion draft, took on the starting point guard role and put together a career year that not only garnered the MIP trophy, but may earn her an All-WNBA and/or All-Defensive honor. </p>\n<p>Ballhalla, meanwhile, became one of the team's greatest strengths. The Valkyries went 14-8 at home, compared to 9-13 on the road, and sold out every single game. Their average attendance of 18,064 and total attendance of 397,408 were both all-time records. </p><p>Though the Valkyries bowed out of the playoffs in the first round after being swept by the top-seeded <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/wnba/teams/MIN/minnesota-lynx/\">Minnesota Lynx</a>, they did so with their heads held high. </p><p>\"So proud. That's the first thing I said,\" Nakase said after the Valkyries' devastating season-ending loss in Game 2. \"No. 1, I said, 'Get your f-----g heads up'. I said, 'Get your heads up.' They were down. I said, 'I want everyone's eye contact. I want to feel every person right now. And I want your emotions, I want your heart, I want everything.' Everyone looked up and I just told them how proud I was. To have that place rocking tonight, to have that Ballhalla mentality, to be able to go toe-and-toe to the No. 1 team, I was so proud.\"</p>\n<p>After a special inaugural season, the Valkyries are well positioned to take a leap in 2026, but like every other team will have to first navigate a complex offseason. </p><h2>Season at a glance</h2><ul><li><strong>Record: </strong>23-21 (No. 8 seed)</li><li><strong>Offensive rating: </strong>101.5 (10th)</li><li><strong>Defensive rating: </strong>99.8 (3rd)</li><li><strong>Net rating: </strong>plus-1.7 (8th)</li></ul><h2>Biggest strength</h2><p><strong>Defense</strong></p><p>The Valkyries were an absolute nightmare to play against all season long. They were physical, relentless and forced teams into inefficient looks. Notably, they allowed just 12.1 attempts per game in the restricted area, which was by far the fewest this season. In fact, only the 2018 <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/wnba/teams/LVA/las-vegas-aces/\">Las Vegas Aces</a> (10.6) have ever allowed fewer over the course of a season. Overall, the Valkyries finished third in defensive rating (99.8) and first in field goal defense (40.5%). </p><h2>Biggest weakness</h2><p><strong>Shooting</strong></p><p>Nakase made it clear prior to the season that she wanted to run a modern offense predicated on getting up a lot of 3-pointers. She was not lying. The Valkyries 29.9 attempts per game and 1,314 total attempts not only led the league, but were single-season records. Unfortunately for the Valkyries, they didn't make many of them. Their 32.5% clip ranked 11th out of 13 teams. If the Valkyries want to continue playing like this, they need players who can actually knock down shots on a regular basis. </p>\n<h2>Key free agents</h2><ul><li>Veronica Burton (restricted)</li><li><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/wnba/players/29375194/temi-fagbenle/\">Temi Fagbenle</a> (unrestricted)</li><li><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/wnba/players/1981034/tiffany-hayes/\">Tiffany Hayes</a> (unrestricted)</li><li><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/wnba/players/26678082/kayla-thornton/\">Kayla Thornton</a> (unrestricted)</li><li>Iliana Rupert (reserved)</li><li>Janelle Salaün (reserved)</li><li><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/wnba/players/29375197/cecilia-zandalasini/\">Cecilia Zandalasini</a> (restricted)</li></ul><p>Every team is going to have more free agents than usual this offseason. There are only two players -- <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/wnba/players/29105418/kalani-brown/\">Kalani Brown</a> and <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/wnba/players/26678088/lexie-brown/\">Lexie Brown</a> -- in the entire league not on a rookie scale deals who are under contract for 2026. Every other veteran set up their contract to expire after the 2025 season with an eye on a big pay raise once the new collective bargaining agreement takes effect. </p><p>But even by this season's unique standards, the Valkyries have a lot of moving parts. Because they selected their inaugural roster via an expansion draft last December and didn't have multiple years of their own draft picks, they only have two players under contract for 2026: <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/wnba/players/29362928/carla-leite/\">Carla Leite</a> and <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/wnba/players/29362998/kate-martin/\">Kate Martin</a>, and neither of them have guaranteed deals. They also control the rights to 2025 first-round pick Justė Jocytė, who did not come over to the WNBA this season. </p><p>Multiple players acknowledged during their exit interviews that it's unlikely the Valkyries will have the same team next season. </p>\n<p>\"We don't know who's going to stay, who's going to go. We have no idea,\" Cecilia Zandalasini said. \"We would love to stay on the same team because we enjoy each other. We had a great, great time this summer, so that would be our dream, probably. But it's business, it's the W, and it has to grow and expand. It worked out well for this team, so we will see.\"</p><p>The Valkyries will surely want to bring back a number of players from this season's team. Retaining Burton, in particular, stands out as a priority. Thanks to their initial success, rabid fanbase and highly-respected coaching staff and front office, the Valkyries could also be in the mix for some big-name free agents this winter. </p><p>But until the new CBA is in place and we know the rules for free agency, as well as key numbers such as the 2026 salary cap and the new maximum, minimum and rookie salaries, it's too difficult to predict the Valkyries' plans with any sort of specificity. </p>\n<h2>Draft outlook</h2><ul><li>Nos. 8, 23 and 38 overall</li></ul><p>The Valkyries own all of their own picks in the 2026 draft, but No. 8 overall is by far the most important. Historically, late second- and third-round picks rarely make rosters, let alone develop into rotation players.</p><p>A unique free agency period and a double expansion draft makes it difficult to know what the Valkyries' biggest needs may be come draft time, but we do have an idea of the players who could be available at No. 8 and would fit Nakase's style. </p><ul><li><strong>Gianna Kneepkens -- F, UCLA</strong></li></ul><p>The Valkyries want to shoot a lot of 3s, and few players do that better than Kneepkens, who transferred to UCLA for her fifth and final collegiate season. During her four seasons at Utah, she went 248 of 574 (43.2%) from behind the arc. Last season was particularly impressive as she shot 44.8% on a career-high 6.8 attempts per game. </p>\n<ul><li><strong>Yarden Garzon -- F, Maryland</strong></li></ul><p>Garzon, who transferred from Indiana to Maryland this summer, is another elite shooter from behind the arc. During her three seasons with the Hoosiers, she made 220 of 516 (42.6%) of her 3-point attempts. Standing 6-foot-3, Garzon also has excellent size on the wing and can play multiple positions. </p>\n            </div>"

But at 100% he was our starting quarterback. But we don't know what percentage he'll be.\"</p><p>Chambliss showed the ability to manage the Rebels' offense efficiently, contributing both through the air and on the ground, totaling 660 yards passing and 174 yards rushing with five combined touchdowns in two starts. Still, Kiffin's decision for the Week 5 matchup against LSU will largely depend on Simmons' availability and readiness.</p><p>\"Health for sure,\" Kiffin said when asked what factors he is considering in determining the starter. \"To see if Austin's at 100%. These guys (LSU) are really good and they're loaded on defense. They're the best they've been on defense since we played them, obviously with the acquisitions that we talked about and really shutting down the run.\" </p>\n<p>Chambliss, a former Ferris State transfer and two-time Division II national champion, led No. 13 Ole Miss to wins against <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/teams/ARK/arkansas-razorbacks/\">Arkansas</a> and <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/teams/TULANE/tulane-green-wave/\">Tulane</a>, but would face a significant challenge against an LSU defense that ranks ninth in the FBS in fewest points allowed per game (9.3) entering Week 5.</p><p>A week 2 injury limited Simmons in practice, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/college-football/story/_/id/46312294/source-ole-miss-qb-austin-simmons-unlikely-contribute-vs-tulane\">according to ESPN</a>. Kiffin initially indicated that Simmons could be ready to return against Tulane in Week 4, but that never materialized with Chambliss leading the Ole Miss offense.</p><p>Simmons saw only four snaps against Arkansas in Week 3, throwing a 4-yard touchdown before heading back to the sideline. He aggravated the injury in that brief appearance.</p>\n<p>There was plenty of offseason hype surrounding Simmons, who waited two years behind former starter and first-round <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://cbssports.com/nfl/draft/\">NFL Draft</a> pick Jaxson Dart while giving up baseball to focus solely on football. However, his early-season injury has cast uncertainty over Ole Miss' offense and left the Rebels balancing Chambliss' steady play with the potential upside Simmons still offers as the long-term solution at quarterback.</p>\n            </div>"
