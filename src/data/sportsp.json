Pelinka did not reveal any specifics on the deal, but it will extend the four-year deal Redick signed prior to last season to become a first-time head coach. </p><p>The Lakers went 50-32 in Redick's first season at the helm, earning the 3-seed in the Western Conference before a first round loss to the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nba/teams/MIN/minnesota-timberwolves/\">Timberwolves</a> in the playoffs. Pelinka said they wanted to cement Redick's place as their \"basketball leader\" for the future, and gave him a longer term deal that will go beyond the 2027-28 season he was already signed through. </p>\n<p>Given the commitment the Lakers got from Luka Dončić this summer with a new extension for the star they acquired in the middle of last season, this feels like as much a vote of confidence from the Lakers in Redick as it is confirmation of Dončić's support for Redick as the coach. Those two had a past relationship as brief teammates in Dallas, and now they are set to be two of the faces of Lakers basketball for the foreseeable future.</p>\n            </div>\n    </div>"

    "body": "<div>\n<p>The <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/CIN/cincinnati-bengals/\">Cincinnati Bengals</a> were optimistic about their ability to succeed with <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/2180355/jake-browning/\">Jake Browning</a> at quarterback in place of <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/2179798/joe-burrow/\">Joe Burrow</a>, who suffered a toe injury in the team's Week 2 loss to the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/JAC/jacksonville-jaguars/\">Jacksonville Jaguars</a> that required surgery and could keep him out for the remainder of the regular season. One game later, they may be feeling differently.</p><p>Cincinnati came away with points against Jacksonville on four of the eight drives led by Browning, who guided the team to a 4-3 record over seven starts in Burrow's stead in 2023. However, he threw three interceptions in that contest and had two more when the Bengals suffered the worst loss in franchise history last week, a 48-10 setback against the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/MIN/minnesota-vikings/\">Minnesota Vikings</a>. He leads the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://cbssports.com/nfl/\">NFL</a> with five picks.</p><p>The Bengals are tied with the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/PIT/pittsburgh-steelers/\">Pittsburgh Steelers</a> atop the AFC North with a 2-1 record but will have a tough time remaining there, as they're about to go through a difficult portion of their schedule. The club begins a four-game stretch that includes meetings with the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/DET/detroit-lions/\">Detroit Lions</a>, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/GB/green-bay-packers/\">Green Bay Packers</a> and Steelers with a road matchup against the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/DEN/denver-broncos/\">Denver Broncos</a> on Monday Night Football in Week 4.</p><p>Denver (1-2) has to be feeling snakebitten of late, losing to the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/IND/indianapolis-colts/\">Indianapolis Colts</a> and <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/LAC/los-angeles-chargers/\">Los Angeles Chargers</a> on the last play of each game after opening the 2025 NFL season with a 20-12 triumph over the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/TEN/tennessee-titans/\">Tennessee Titans</a>. As a result, the Broncos already find themselves two games behind the Chargers for first place in the AFC West.</p><p>Despite the recent late-game misfortunes, SportsLine's Inside the Lines team still believes Denver has a solid chance to make the playoffs. Its projection model, which simulates every NFL game 10,000 times, sees the Broncos reaching the postseason almost 64% of the time.</p>\n<p>The ITL team's model has crunched the numbers for Monday's contest at Empower Field in Denver, as well as every NFL game for the remainder of the season, and its simulations say a loss by the Broncos wouldn't be devastating to their playoff outlook. Should their losing streak reach three games, the Broncos' postseason chances would drop to 46%.</p><p>According to the model, Denver qualifies for the playoffs in more than 70% of its simulations with a victory, making it just over a 24% difference between a win and a loss. The model has Cincinnati's difference at nearly the exact same number but says the Bengals would advance to the postseason in less than 24% of its simulations should they be defeated on Monday night.</p><p>The ITL team's model currently has the Lions winning their third straight NFC North crown in less than 14% of its simulations. Their chances improve to 19% with a victory over the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/BAL/baltimore-ravens/\">Ravens</a> but drop to just under 10% with a loss.</p><table><tbody><tr><td><p>CHANCES OF MAKING PLAYOFFS</p></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td><p>TEAM</p></td><td><p>CURRENT</p></td><td><p>WITH WEEK 4 WIN</p></td><td><p>WITH WEEK 4 LOSS</p></td><td><p>DIFFERENCE</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Cincinnati Bengals</p></td><td><p>31.0%</p></td><td><p>47.6%</p></td><td><p>23.6%</p></td><td><p>24.0%</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Denver Broncos</p></td><td><p>63.9%</p></td><td><p>70.1%</p></td><td><p>46.0%</p></td><td><p>24.1%</p></td></tr></tbody></table><p>Meanwhile, Cincinnati's chances at winning its third AFC North title in five years aren't very good at this moment and will get worse by almost 2% with a loss to Denver. The model believes if the Bengals defeat the Broncos, the teams' outlook for a division crown would be nearly the same.</p><p>Right now, the model says Cincinnati wins the AFC North in less than 8% of its simulations. Its chances would exceed 11% with a win but fall to less than 6% with a loss. Denver captures the AFC West well over 17% of the time at the moment, and a victory would increase that number to almost 20% while a setback would drop it to around 10.5%.</p><table><tbody><tr><td><p>CHANCES OF WINNING AFC NORTH</p></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td><p>TEAM</p></td><td><p>CURRENT</p></td><td><p>WITH WEEK 4 WIN</p></td><td><p>WITH WEEK 4 LOSS</p></td><td><p>DIFFERENCE</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Cincinnati Bengals</p></td><td><p>7.8%</p></td><td><p>11.3%</p></td><td><p>5.9%</p></td><td><p>5.4%</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Pittsburgh Steelers</p></td><td><p>28.0%</p></td><td><p>32.8%</p></td><td><p>21.3%</p></td><td><p>11.5%</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Baltimore Ravens</p></td><td><p>63.5%</p></td><td><p>67.1%</p></td><td><p>52.6%</p></td><td><p>14.5%</p></td></tr><tr><td><p><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/CLE/cleveland-browns/\">Cleveland Browns</a></p></td><td><p>0.7%</p></td><td><p>1.6%</p></td><td><p>0.5%</p></td><td><p>1.1%</p></td></tr></tbody></table><table><tbody><tr><td><p>CHANCES OF WINNING AFC WEST</p></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td><p>TEAM</p></td><td><p>CURRENT</p></td><td><p>WITH WEEK 4 WIN</p></td><td><p>WITH WEEK 4 LOSS</p></td><td><p>DIFFERENCE</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Denver Broncos</p></td><td><p>17.6%</p></td><td><p>19.7%</p></td><td><p>10.6%</p></td><td><p>9.1%</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Los Angeles Chargers</p></td><td><p>65.2%</p></td><td><p>68.4%</p></td><td><p>52.6%</p></td><td><p>15.8%</p></td></tr><tr><td><p><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/KC/kansas-city-chiefs/\">Kansas City Chiefs</a></p></td><td><p>16.1%</p></td><td><p>20.5%</p></td><td><p>11.3%</p></td><td><p>9.2%</p></td></tr><tr><td><p><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/LV/las-vegas-raiders/\">Las Vegas Raiders</a></p></td><td><p>1.1%</p></td><td><p>1.6%</p></td><td><p>0.6%</p></td><td><p>1.0%</p></td></tr></tbody></table><p>The Broncos have won seven consecutive home games dating back to last year, their longest such streak since an 11-game run that bridged the 2014 and 2015 seasons.

    "body": "<div>\n        <p><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nba/players/3042398/zion-williamson/\">Zion Williamson</a> has played in less than half -- 45% percent to be exact -- of the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nba/teams/NO/new-orleans-pelicans/\">Pelicans</a>' games since being selected No. 1 overall in the 2019 <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://cbssports.com/nba/draft/\">NBA Draft</a>. Injuries have significantly limited Williamson from living up to the \"generational talent\" tag that was attached to him going back to his high school days. When he's healthy, he looks every bit the franchise centerpiece that you wouldn't dare part with, but the issue has been that he can never stay healthy enough over a sustained period of time for that to matter.</p><p>Some of the injuries have just been a byproduct of his stout frame mixed with his explosiveness, but a large portion of it also falls on Williamson's shoulders. He's been heavily criticized for his poor conditioning, which doesn't help in trying to stay on the floor. But perhaps this is the season that changes. Williamson showed up to Media Day on Tuesday in the best shape we've seen him.</p><p>\"I gotta give that praise to Daniel Bove, trainer with the [Pelicans],\" <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gwu0G7duEaE\" target=\"_blank\">Williamson said</a>. \"Last year, while I was rehabbing my hamstring, me and him sat down and we had a conversation. He was just like, 'Z, we need to figure this out. When you come back from rehab, we want you to be better than before it happened. What are some things you like to do? How can we make the workouts in a way to where you're having fun and you're really enjoying it?' And we came up with a plan, from boxing to working out on the football field a lot, to just different random workouts.</p><p>\"During that time frame, last year, I really felt a shift in my body to where I would look at him and go, 'Dude, it feels good to feel good,'\" he continued. \"I haven't felt like this since college, high school. Just, where I can walk in the gym and I'm like, I feel good.\"</p>\n<p>It's an eyebrow-raising transformation for Williamson, whose contract relies heavily upon his physical condition. When the Pelicans signed him to a max extension in 2022, it came with several clauses that, if triggered, would make the latter years of the extension non-guaranteed. He needed to miss fewer than 23 games during the 2022-23 season to avoid his 2025-26, 2026-27 and 2027-28 salaries becoming non-guaranteed. Williamson missed 53 games, and in order to get the full amount of his contract, he has to adhere to the following guidelines:</p><ul><li>20% of his salary becomes guaranteed if he passes all six of weigh-in checkpoints</li></ul><ul><li>40% of salary becomes guaranteed if he plays in 41 or more games; another 20% is guaranteed if he plays in 51 or more games; and the last 20% is guaranteed if he plays in 61 or more games</li></ul><p>If Williamson fails to reach those benchmarks, the Pelicans can waive him with no financial ramifications. Basically, Williamson's literally playing to earn his salary for next season. From the looks of Media Day, it appears as though he's never been in better shape than now to do so, but showing up to training camp slimmed down doesn't mean anything if he can't stay healthy. </p><p>Before sustaining yet another injury at the end of last season, Williamson showed flashes of the All-Star version of himself, but he'll need to show more than just flashes if he wants to see the entirety of his contract going forward. He's going on Year 7 in the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://cbssports.com/nba/\">NBA</a>, and while there have been small rumblings in the past about the Pelicans considering a trade, they've largely remained committed to having the Duke product as their centerpiece.</p>\n<p>Now that his next two seasons are non-guaranteed, however, it gives the Pelicans a ton of power over Williamson's future with the team. Williamson looks the part of someone who is taking his physical fitness seriously, but he'll still need to prove that he's worth all the money for which New Orleans could potentially be on the hook. If he has another injury-laden season, or if his conditioning falls to the wayside, it would not be surprising to see New Orleans at least consider the thought of waiving him next summer if those checkpoints aren't met.</p>\n            </div>"

However, he fell all the way to the fifth round, where he was selected No. 144 overall by the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/CLE/cleveland-browns/\">Cleveland Browns</a>. Sanders got his wish in being selected by a team that needed a new quarterback, but he is stuck behind <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/1250697/joe-flacco/\">Joe Flacco</a> and <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/3121534/dillon-gabriel/\">Dillon Gabriel</a> on the depth chart. </p><p>The son of <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://cbssports.com/nfl/\">NFL</a> legend Deion Sanders has technically been inactive for the first three games of the season as the designated emergency quarterback. During a recent interview with ESPN Cleveland, Sanders said he's remaining focused and not getting comfortable with where he's at. In fact, he says he's not comfortable with being a \"scout team player.\" But, he's going to make the best of his situation.</p><p>\"Just because where I am on the depth chart, (I) don't let that dictate my mindset each and every day, because you don't know what could happen...\" Sanders said. </p><p>Sanders is still confident in himself. He knows it's not his call whether he plays or not, but maintains he's \"ready to play right now.\" He also believes he's capable of playing better than some starting quarterbacks around the NFL.</p>\n<p>\"I know if you see the quarterback play in the league right now, I know I'm capable of doing better than that,\" Sanders said. </p>\n<p>Sanders was named the Big 12 Offensive Player of the Year last season after completing 74% of his passes for 4,134 yards, 37 touchdowns and 10 interceptions. He set single-season program records with those passing yards and passing touchdown numbers, and left <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://cbssports.com/college-football/\">college football</a> with the highest career completion percentage (71.8%) in FBS history. It's clear that Sanders fell in the draft due to non-football issues. <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/draft/news/shedeur-sanders-falling-in-nfl-draft-a-reflection-of-how-colorado-qb-deion-sanders-handled-pre-draft-process/\" target=\"_blank\">CBS Sports NFL insider Jonathan Jones</a> reported Sanders' slide was a reflection of how he carried himself through the pre-draft process.</p><p>Right now, the 23-year-old-signal caller says he's trusting in God's plan, and trying to enjoy himself along the way. </p>\n<p>\"Some things happen for a reason, and I'm a true believer in that,\" Sanders said. \"Whatever His plan for me is, I believe in it. So I don't get stressed or feel bad that I'm in the situation that I'm in right now. I would say it's just funny to me, that's it. It's just funny to me and I just enjoy it.\"</p>\n            </div>"

The Irish put up a season-high 535 yards of total offense, and Arkansas has managed at least 500 yards of offense in every game this season despite being 2-2.

The higher the number next to a player's name, the more confident I am that you should start him. <strong>The numbers are not a projection, just a confidence score to help you pick who to start. </strong>Every relevant player for this week is here, so if a player isn't listed, don't start him.</p><p>    To find a specific player, use your search function -- CTRL-F on PCs and Command-F on Macs.

    "body": "<div>\n<p>A good start in the Ryder Cup is crucial. In this year's edition, Team USA captain Keegan Bradley chose foursomes as the format to kick things off. Below, you'll find the officially pairings for the Day 1 morning session and how to bet each matchup.</p><h2>Ryder Cup Day 1 Best Bets</h2><p><strong>7:10 A.M. EST | Bryson DeChambeau and Justin Thomas (-105) vs. Jon Rahm and Tyrrell Hatton (-120)</strong></p><p>Bryson DeChambeau hitting the first tee shot is the signature headline of the Ryder Cup so far. However, he's 0-2 in his Ryder Cup career in foursomes and has never played with Justin Thomas. Jon Rahm and Tyrrell Hatton are partners on LIV and are undefeated as a foursomes duo in the Ryder Cup. They won't shy away from the villain role.</p><p>This will be Rahm's four straight Ryder Cup in the opening pairing. With that experience and the Spanish connection, I favor the away team in this matchup.</p><p><strong>7:26 A.M. EST | Russell Henley and Scottie Scheffler (-160) vs. Ludvig Aberg and Matt Fitzpatrick (+130)</strong></p><p>Henley and Scheffler were as sure of a bet as any to be paired together in the first session of the Ryder Cup. They were partners for both foursomes sessions of the 2024 Presidents Cup, including a 3&2 win over Hideki Matsuyama and Sungjae Im. Henley's accuracy and composure make him the ideal partner for the world No. 1. Scheffler comes into Bethpage Black having won three of his last five PGA Tour events and two of the last three major championships.</p><p>Fitzpatrick boasts a dreadful 0-5 record in Ryder Cup matches on US soil, including 0-3 in foursomes matches. This looks like the session's biggest mismatch.</p><p><strong><em>Bet Henley and Scheffler To Win (-160, DraftKings)</em></strong></p><p><strong>7:42 A.M. EST | Collin Morikawa and Harris English (+145) vs. Rory McIlroy and Tommy Fleetwood (-185)</strong></p><p>European captain Luke Donald is showing his hand with this pairing. Tommy Fleetwood, fresh off his Tour Championship win, alongside Rory McIlroy, the winningest player in this Ryder Cup. The duo went 2-0 in foursomes in Rome, and it's no surprise they're the biggest favorites of the morning session.</p><p><strong>7:58 A.M. EST | Xander Schauffele & Patrick Cantlay (-120) vs. Robert MacIntyre & Viktor Hovland (-105)</strong></p><p>Xander Schauffele and Patrick Cantlay have been a foursomes staple, playing all four sessions together across two Ryder Cups. They dominated in 2021, including a 5&3 win over McIlroy and Ian Poulter, though they stumbled with an 0-2 record in 2023. Against Robert MacIntyre, who's never played alternate shot and isn't suited for it, I love the value on the American duo at nearly even money.</p><p><strong><em>Bet Schauffele and Cantlay To Win (-120, Draftkings)</em></strong></p>\n            </div>"

Meanwhile, Louis Varland will be opening for Toronto in his 73rd appearance of the season. He won't go more than an inning and change, and the Blue Jays' bullpen ranks 16th in baseball in ERA this season.

The Black Knights lost to FCS Tarleton State in double-overtime, pulled off a stunning upset against Kansas State and then lost in overtime to North Texas. The Tarleton State loss is a head scratcher, but North Texas does appear to be the real deal, having already smashed Washington State 59-10 the week prior.

Chicago is eighth in the MLB (4.85), and New York is in the 10th spot (4.75). Over the first two games in this series, they've scored at least 13 runs in both contests. The over has cashed in three of the last five games for Chicago. Meanwhile, the over has hit in five of the last eight games for New York. The Cubs are expected to start left-hander Shota Imanaga, who boasts a 9-7 record and 3.37 ERA. SportsLine's model projects that the over cashes in 64% of simulations and has these teams combining for 9.2 total runs. </p><h2>Seahawks vs. Cardinals (+1.5) (-112) </h2><p>The Cardinals are coming off their first loss, but it was only by a single point. The 49ers escaped with the win after hitting a 35-yard field goal as time expired. Arizona heads back home, where they owned a 6-3 record in 2024. Last season, the Cardinals also went 7-2 ATS as the underdog. Meanwhile, the Seahawks had a 1-4-1 ATS record as the favorite and a 0-2-1 ATS record as the away favorite.

Despite these strong numbers, divisional matchups are always difficult. Smith-Njigba has never finished with more than 77 yards in four career games against Arizona. The Under has hit 6 of the last 10 times the line was set at 84.5.

    "body": "<div>\n        <p>When the \"Monday Night Football\" cameras showed <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/187741/tom-brady/\">Tom Brady</a> in the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/LV/las-vegas-raiders/\">Las Vegas Raiders</a> coaches' booth donning a headset, with reports that he lends his expertise to the staff, all of New England had the same thought: <em>Damn, wouldn't it be cool if he were doing that for the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/NE/new-england-patriots/\">Patriots</a>?</em></p><p>Of course, Brady has been <span><a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/news/tom-brady-defends-dual-roles-as-broadcaster-raiders-minority-owner-amid-point-of-conflict-chatter/\" target=\"_blank\">under scrutiny in recent weeks</a></span> because of his role as a minority owner of the Raiders, possibly serving as a conflict of interest as a broadcaster. While that's debatable, one thing isn't: Patriots fans wish that controversy was going on with Brady as a minority owner of their franchise -- the one he helped win six <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://cbssports.com/nfl/superbowl/\">Super Bowl</a> titles.</p><p>With the news coming out Thursday that Robert Kraft has <span><a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/news/robert-kraft-to-sell-minority-stake-in-the-patriots-at-9-billion-valuation-per-report/\" target=\"_blank\">agreed to sell an 8% stake of the Patriots</a></span> to a pair of investors, it's fair to ask that question. </p><p>If they are going to sell a slice of the team, why wouldn't Kraft have tried to bring Brady in before he made his bid to own a piece of Las Vegas? It's hard to imagine Kraft decided to sell 8% of his team overnight, and Brady's purchase of his stake in the Raiders was only approved last October. Wouldn't it have made sense to loop the franchise icon, who currently has his number retired and a statue standing outside Gillette Stadium, instead of largely faceless investors? </p>\n<h2>Tom Brady's partial purchase of the Raiders </h2><p>It's worth examining Brady's pursuit and eventual purchase of a slice of the Raiders to better contextualize this situation surrounding the Patriots sale. Back in 2023, Brady's group entered into an agreement to buy a 10% stake in the Raiders from majority owner Mark Davis. At the time, there was criticism from some in the league that Brady was getting a massive discount. By the time the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://cbssports.com/nfl/\">NFL</a> owners approved the deal in October, Brady secured 5% of the franchise while his partners received the other 5%. As the <a href=\"https://www.nbcsports.com/nfl/profootballtalk/rumor-mill/news/tom-bradys-raiders-purchase-shows-he-got-a-sweetheart-deal\" target=\"_blank\">Sports Business Journal reported at the time</a>, the valuation came in at $3.5 billion. Yet Brady and his partners paid even less than the $350 million for a 10% share at that low valuation, shelling out a reported $244 million.</p><h2>What 8% of the Patriots is worth</h2><p>With those numbers from Brady's purchase in mind, let's look at what 8% of the Patriots is worth. Even if we stick with the $9 billion valuation (and reports suggest it exceeds this number), that slice would be worth $720 million. That's nearly three times the amount Brady and his group paid for the Raiders. </p><p>That stake is split between two investors, billionaire Dean Metropoulos (5%) and Sixth Street Partners (3%). That smaller piece of the team purchased by Sixth Street Partners comes in at $270 million. While that $270 million gets into the ballpark of what Brady's group paid for their piece of the Raiders, it comes as a much smaller percentage. Brady alone owns 5% of the Raiders franchise, which may not sound like much, but is a massive difference. </p>\n<h2>Should Kraft have sold a piece of the Patriots to Brady?</h2><p>From a business standpoint, Kraft did the right thing in this instance. He bought the team back in 1994 for $127 million. By selling less than 10% of the team and maintaining full control of the organization, Kraft pocketed roughly $720 million -- nearly six times what he originally paid for the entire franchise.</p><p>On Brady's part, the Raiders purchase made more sense than if he had been allowed to buy the 3% of the Patriots. He has more stake in the Las Vegas football franchise at a cheaper rate. From a business perspective, both parties made savvy moves. </p><p>From a sheer nostalgic standpoint, it would make more sense for Brady to be immersed with the Patriots. Under these current circumstances, Brady is the opposition. For instance, as a minority owner of the Raiders, Brady was rooting <em>against</em> New England in Week 1 when it hosted Las Vegas. That just feels wrong. </p>\n<p>From a football standpoint, there's an argument to be made that having Brady's knowledge as a resource for the organization would've been invaluable, particularly as New England has struggled mightily since his departure following the 2019 season. In the five full seasons since Brady left (2020-2024), the Patriots are 33-51 and have missed the playoffs four times. They are also currently on their third head coach in as many seasons, so his guidance would've been welcomed. Instead, he's implementing his football knowledge with the Raiders, which again just feels odd. </p>\n            </div>"
