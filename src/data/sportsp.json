The Blue Jays lost on Tuesday, allowing the Yankees to pull to one game out of the AL East lead, but the model sees value in Toronto bouncing back to win at +118 odds. The model also projects the Mets vs. Cubs to go Over 7 total runs, as they did in New York's 9-7 win on Tuesday. The Mets have gone Over this total in five of their last seven games, with the Cubs also going Over in three of their last four contests.

Francisco Alvarez hit a game-winning two-run home run to break a tie at 7 in the eighth inning for his second home run in his last five games. Francisco Lindor and Brandon Nimmo also homered for the Mets. Five of the last seven Mets games went Over 7 total runs. The Cubs and the Mets both have top-10 scoring offenses in baseball, and the model projects the Over to hit in 71% of simulations for an 8:05 p.m. ET start.</p><h2>Blue Jays (+118) to defeat the Red Sox</h2><p>Toronto is in danger of falling out of first place in the American League East, and losing a first-round bye despite currently having the best record in the AL. The Blue Jays (90-67) have a one-game lead over the Yankees entering Wednesday. They've lost five of their last six games, but with a future Hall of Fame pitcher heading to the mound on Wednesday, the model projects value in the Blue Jays winning at plus-money odds. Toronto is starting Max Scherzer, who has 221 career victories, while the Red Sox start Garrett Crochet (17-5, 2.69 ERA). Crochet has a 4.50 ERA over his last two starts though. At +118 odds, the model sees value in projecting the Blue Jays to win in 54% of simulations for a 7:07 p.m. ET start.</p><h2>Rockies vs. Mariners Over 7.5 total runs (-110)</h2><p>The Mariners clinched a playoff spot on Tuesday to cap off what's been an incredible September run, going 15-1 over their last 16 games. Seattle defeated Colorado, 4-3, on Tuesday after going Over 7.5 total runs in each of its prior two contests. The Rockies are allowing the most runs in baseball (6.32 runs per game) and are scheduled to start Tanner Gordon, who has a 6.00 ERA this season. Although the Mariners clinched the postseason, they haven't secured the AL West yet, as they lead the Astros by four games. The Mariners couldn't have their all-out celebration yet with important games ahead and the likely chance of securing a first-round bye if they win the division, so the players should remain focused on Wednesday. Mariners starting pitcher Luis Castillo has been hot and cold lately, as he's allowed one run or fewer in three of his last five starts, while allowing five runs in the other two contests. The model projects the Over to hit in 69.3% of simulations for this 9:40 p.m. ET start. </p><h2>Want more MLB picks for Wednesday, September 24?</h2><p><strong>You've seen the model's Wednesday best bets.

Now he'll match up with a dynamic Blue Jays offense that has managed six runs off him (three earned) and homered in each of their previous two matchups. <strong>The model predicts that Toronto wins 54% of the time</strong>.</p><p>Over 7 runs in Cubs vs. Mets (-115)</p><p>The Cubs and Mets are both top 10 in Major League Baseball in runs scored and this is a suspiciously low line with Matthew Boyd vs. Jonah Tong as the pitching matchup. Boyd has turned into the surprise ace in Chicago this season but he's started to show signs of wear, with the 34-year-old giving up at least four earned runs in five of his last six starts to balloon his ERA from 2.46 to 3.20. Meanwhile, Tong is a rookie who looked solid in his last start but got roughed up for six runs in just 2/3 of an inning the outing before that and has a 5.94 ERA over four career starts. <strong>The model has the Over hitting in 71% of simulations</strong>.</p><p>Diamondbacks money line vs. Dodgers (+130)</p><p>The model goes back to the well here after correctly predicting a Diamondbacks win as plus-money underdogs on Tuesday. Blake Snell has generally been great since returning to action, but the Diamondbacks did run him off after 5 1/3 innings on Aug. 29 after scoring three earned runs against him. Meanwhile, Ryne Nelson has a 2.35 ERA in September and threw five innings of one-run ball against the Dodgers earlier in the year. <strong>Arizona wins in 49% of the model's simulations, </strong>bringing value at these odds.</p><h2>Want more MLB picks for Wednesday, September 24?</h2><p><strong>You've seen some of the model's Wednesday MLB best bets.

Our computer model and experts will weigh in on all of the biggest events every day, and they're offering their top sports betting picks right now.</p><p><strong>Here's what we're betting today: </strong></p><h2>Wednesday La Liga best bets </h2><ul><li><strong>Game: Atletico Madrid vs. Rayo Vallecano (Wednesday, 3:30 p.m. ET)</strong></li><li><strong>The Pick: <strong>Atletico Madrid 90-minute line</strong> (-195)</strong></li></ul><p>Athletico Madrid are 12th while Rayo Vallecano are 14th in the La Liga table through five matches each, but Athletico Madrid have been playing well lately, with a victory and three draws over their last four La Liga matches. They also pushed a strong Liverpool team in Champions League play before falling 3-2 following a Liverpool goal in the 90th minute. Meanwhile, Rayo Vallecano is 0-2-2 over their last four La Liga matches, and failed to qualify for the Champions League. Marcos Llorente scored two goals against Liverpool on September 17, and is a player to watch on Wednesday. Athletico Madrid is 18-5-1 against Rayo Vallecano, including four wins and two draws over their last six head-to-head meetings, as the model sees strong value in backing Athletico Madrid at -195 odds to win on the 90-minute line.</p><p><strong>More La Liga best bets</strong></p><ul><li><a href=\"https://www.sportsline.com/la-liga/picks/\" target=\"_blank\">Every La Liga match simulated 10,000 times</a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.sportsline.com/la-liga/picks/experts/?sc=\" target=\"_blank\">La Liga expert picks</a> </li></ul><h2>Wednesday MLB best bets</h2><ul><li><strong>Game: Washington Nationals vs. Atlanta Braves (Wednesday, 12:15 p.m. ET)</strong></li><li><strong>The Pick: Nationals +1.5 runs (-130)</strong></li></ul><p>Although the Braves enter on a 10-game winning streak, the model projects value in the Nationals to keep pace with Atlanta on Wednesday, enough to keep it a one-run contest or even pull off the upset. The Braves defeated the Nationals, 3-2, on Tuesday, which would have resulted in Washington cashing for Nationals + 1.5 bettors. Two of Atlanta's last four victories have come by one run, and the Nationals have covered a 1.5-run spread in three of their last four games. The Braves are starting Bryce Elder, who has a 5.36 ERA this season, against 26-year-old Washington rookie Andrew Alvarez, who has a 2.84 ERA over four starts to begin his MLB career. The model projects the Nationals to cover the spread in 65% of simulations.</p><ul><li><strong>Game: Detroit Tigers vs. Cleveland Guardians (Wednesday, 6:40 p.m. ET)</strong></li><li><strong>The Pick: Guardians -130</strong></li></ul><p>The Guardians and Tigers are tied for first in the American League Central, as Cleveland has erased an 11-game deficit in the division from September 4. SportsLine expert Bruce Marshall expects Cleveland to have sole possession of the AL Central by Thursday morning, with Jack Flaherty starting for the Tigers against Tanner Bibee for Cleveland.</p><p>\"Spinning a subpar 5.51 ERA in August, Jack Flaherty began a succession of underperforming efforts that have seen the Tigers lose in seven of his last nine starts into late September,\" Marshall told SportsLine. \"Including five good innings last Wednesday vs. Cleveland, allowing just one run, but that was all the Guardians needed in an eventual 4-0 win. The bigger news is Cleveland inhaling ground, having still trailed the Tigers by 12.5 games in the Central on August 25. A 17-5 September, along with a Tigers slowdown, has allowed the Guardians to remarkably pull level after last night's 5-2 win. Cleveland has also won all three September starts by Tanner Bibee, who owns a 1.25 ERA this month.\"</p><p><strong>More MLB best bets</strong></p><ul><li><a href=\"https://www.sportsline.com/mlb/game-forecast/MLB_20250924_WAS@ATL/\" target=\"_blank\">Top player prop</a>: Andrew Alvarez, Nationals, Over 3.5 strikeouts (+129) (MODEL)</li><li><a href=\"https://www.sportsline.com/mlb/game-forecast/MLB_20250924_MIA@PHI/\" target=\"_blank\">Top player prop</a>: Kyle Schwarber, Phillies, Over 1.5 total bases (+109) (MODEL)</li></ul>\n            </div>"

All is going well. The offense is humming. The defense is shutting down opponents. Maybe both. Maybe there's a little bit of luck involved. But the vibes around the building are likely immaculate and the dreams are likely big.</p><p>Some teams are 2-1. More has gone right than wrong. Some mistakes have been made, but it's nothing that can't be corrected. You're probably thinking about how you can make it to the playoffs. Some teams are 1-2. It's disappointing and you'd rather be in a different position, but not all is lost because you're only a game below .500, after all. Win next week and you're back in the hunt.</p><p>And then some teams are 0-3. You don't get to 0-3 without a whole lot of stuff going wrong. The offense can't get moving or the defense can't get stops. Maybe both. Maybe you just don't have the talent to compete with your opponents and that's becoming clear. Whatever the case, things are bad.</p>\n<p>We're here to talk about those bad teams. Today, we're going to assign blame, on a percentage basis, to different areas of the team and the organization for the six 0-3 teams in the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://cbssports.com/nfl/\">NFL</a>: the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/NYG/new-york-giants/\">New York Giants</a>, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/NO/new-orleans-saints/\">New Orleans Saints</a>, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/NYJ/new-york-jets/\">New York Jets</a>, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/MIA/miami-dolphins/\">Miami Dolphins</a>, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/HOU/houston-texans/\">Houston Texans</a> and <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/TEN/tennessee-titans/\">Tennessee Titans</a>.</p><div>\n                            <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/NYG/new-york-giants/\">\n    <figure><img alt=\"team logo\" src=\"https://sports.cbsimg.net/fly/images/team-logos/422.svg\" /></figure>\n                                                </a>\n                    </div>\n    <p><strong>Offense: 40% | Defense: 20% | Coaching: 20% | Offseason Decisions: 20%</strong></p><p>New York's offense has looked functional for just one of its three games, and that game was against the decrepit <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/DAL/dallas-cowboys/\">Cowboys</a> defense so it doesn't really count. Things were so bad that the Giants became the first team in the league to make a non-injury-related quarterback change, sending <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/1272242/russell-wilson/\">Russell Wilson</a> to the bench. But that also comes back to offseason decision-making. Why was Wilson signed in the first place? The Giants had already signed a bridge starter in <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/1998197/jameis-winston/\">Jameis Winston</a>. There was no real point to doing this. In any event, the defense has also been somewhat of a disappointment, having been lit up for over 400 yards by two of its three opponents and forced only one turnover through three games. Neither the offense nor defense looks like it has a real plan to put people in position to succeed, which comes back to coaching. </p><div>\n                            <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/NO/new-orleans-saints/\">\n    <figure><img alt=\"team logo\" src=\"https://sports.cbsimg.net/fly/images/team-logos/421.svg\" /></figure>\n                                                </a>\n                    </div>\n    <p><strong>Lack of talent: 75% | Organizational stasis: 25%</strong></p><p>The Saints haven't really looked yet like they are in the same class as any of their opponents, and that's not necessarily a good sign because the three opponents they've faced are an okay <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/ARI/arizona-cardinals/\">Cardinals</a> team, a <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/SF/san-francisco-49ers/\">49ers</a> team starting its backup quarterback and then the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/SEA/seattle-seahawks/\">Seahawks</a>, who were missing several starters from their ferocious defense. This is a franchise that has allowed its roster to get old and stale, and is finally staring down the barrel of a full-scale rebuild. This is what it looks like when your roster gets to that point: you're not really all that competitive in any of your games because you simply can't compete with teams whose talent level is a significant step above where yours is. This is likely what we're going to see out of the Saints all year. And honestly, that's fine. They need a top pick to restock the roster.</p>\n<div>\n                            <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/NYJ/new-york-jets/\">\n    <figure><img alt=\"team logo\" src=\"https://sports.cbsimg.net/fly/images/team-logos/423.svg\" /></figure>\n                                                </a>\n                    </div>\n    <p><strong>Inability to get timely stops: 40% | Lack of offensive options: 35% | Turnovers: 25% </strong></p><p>Outside of <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/3123864/garrett-wilson/\">Garrett Wilson</a> and <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/3123469/breece-hall/\">Breece Hall</a>, there just isn't a lot in the cupboard to help the Jets move the ball down the field. Wilson has been balling out but nobody else on the team has more than 78 yards receiving through three games. And even Hall has only a 39.5% rushing success rate. <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/1273205/justin-fields/\">Justin Fields</a> looked good in Week 1 and <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/1243338/tyrod-taylor/\">Tyrod Taylor</a> did an admirable job in Week 3, but it's tough sledding without the type of weaponry you need to move the ball. It's especially tough when you give the ball away four times in three games. When you're undermanned on that side of the ball, you just can't afford those mistakes. That said, the Jets could easily be 2-1 if their defense could have gotten one stop against the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/PIT/pittsburgh-steelers/\">Steelers</a> or <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/TB/tampa-bay-buccaneers/\">Buccaneers</a> in a big spot. They didn't come through and so they lost both of those games when they could've won.</p><div>\n                            <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/MIA/miami-dolphins/\">\n    <figure><img alt=\"team logo\" src=\"https://sports.cbsimg.net/fly/images/team-logos/418.svg\" /></figure>\n                                                </a>\n                    </div>\n    <p><strong>Defense: 75% | Offense: 10% | Awful vibes all around: 10% | Injuries: 5% </strong></p><p>Miami simply cannot stop anybody from moving the ball or putting it in the end zone, and cannot take it away from the other team, either. Some of that is due to various injuries in the secondary, but it is<em> bad</em> stuff. The Dolphins rank 26th in yards allowed and 32nd in points allowed. They've given up 31 or more points to all three of their opponents. They have forced zero turnovers. Opponents are averaging the most yards and points per drive in the league and have scored on an utterly preposterous 68% of their possessions. The defense has been so bad that it's overshadowed the offense looking largely like a shell of the unit that took the league by storm a few years ago. The last two games have been better than the disastrous opener but the high-flying, explosive version of this team is gone. The vibes have been rancid since at least training camp, and that's shown up for this team on the field.</p>\n<div>\n                            <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/HOU/houston-texans/\">\n    <figure><img alt=\"team logo\" src=\"https://sports.cbsimg.net/fly/images/team-logos/247415.svg\" /></figure>\n                                                </a>\n                    </div>\n    <p><strong>Offensive line: 40% | Turnovers: 40% | Lack of skill talent: 20% | Schedule: 10%</strong></p><p>Are we really doing this again with Houston's offensive line? It feels like we're watching the same movie as last year. And it turns out, when you swap out almost the entire line but don't actually invest real resources in replacing the guys you're moving on from, things don't actually get much better. As a result, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/3163079/c-j-stroud/\">C.J. Stroud</a> is under constant pressure, and he looks jittery in the pocket. The run game cannot come close to getting untracked except when the Bucs are letting <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/2131579/nick-chubb/\">Nick Chubb</a> score late in the game. The receivers outside of <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/2878193/nico-collins/\">Nico Collins</a> don't come close to getting open, so there's nowhere to go with the ball even on the rare occasions where Stroud does have time to throw. That's all resulted in some pretty bad turnovers. The Texans had the misfortune of playing the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/LAR/los-angeles-rams/\">Rams</a> and Bucs in the first three weeks, but that's just the lack of the draw. </p><div>\n                            <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/TEN/tennessee-titans/\">\n    <figure><img alt=\"team logo\" src=\"https://sports.cbsimg.net/fly/images/team-logos/432.svg\" /></figure>\n                                                </a>\n                    </div>\n    <p><strong>Offensive line: 25% | Coaching: 25% | Schedule: 25% | Lack of talent: 25%</strong></p><p>Speaking of remade offensive lines that have not worked out, it's the Tennessee Titans! They are going to get <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/3168422/cam-ward/\">Cam Ward</a> killed out there. Dan Moore has been a turnstile, while <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/26694508/jc-latham/\">JC Latham</a> and <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/1631203/kevin-zeitler/\">Kevin Zeitler</a> have both missed time. It's not been pretty. Brian Callahan apparently does not know that an elbow equals two feet when it comes to the catch rule. He has directly cost his team 10 points at the end of halves (seven against Denver and three against Indianapolis) with poor clock management. He is wildly conservative in his decision-making. Some of that is probably due to the tough schedule (<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/DEN/denver-broncos/\">Broncos</a>, Rams, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/IND/indianapolis-colts/\">Colts</a>) and maybe some of it is due to his under-talented team, but he has consistently put them behind the eight-ball. He's giving up play-calling now, so maybe things will change going forward. </p>\n            </div>"

FIFA President Gianni Infantino and CONMEBOL President Alejandro Dominguez met in New York City to discuss the possibility of expanding the format, <a href=\"https://x.com/TouchlineX/status/1970819239515963651\" target=\"_blank\">according to Ole</a>. The tournament was already expanded from 32 to 48 teams for the upcoming 2026 World Cup, which will take place in the United States, Mexico and Canada, a big change for the tournament that had held steady with 32 teams since 1998.</p><p>The 2030 World Cup will take place in <span>Spain</span>, <span>Portugal</span> and <span>Morocco</span> but some games will also be hosted in <span>Argentina</span>, Paraguay and <span>Uruguay</span> to celebrate the centenary. If FIFA were to approve the expansion for 2030, the World Cup will see a record 128 matches all played in less then a month. However, according to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/sep/24/fifa-mens-world-cup-gianni-infantino-not-planning-64-team-expansion-trump-tower-summit\" target=\"_blank\">The Guardian</a>, FIFA are not considering the option as \"Gianni would not get that vote through Council even if he wanted to. The overwhelming feeling around the table and not just in Europe is that 64 teams would damage the World Cup. There'd be too many uncompetitive matches and it would risk damaging the business model\", a source told the English newspaper. </p><p><a href=\"https://x.com/agdws/status/1970642405268562422?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1970642405268562422%7Ctwgr%5Ef75abb844c447b4c93d826e9cbe6619ef761f989%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&ref_url=https://www.espn.com/soccer/story/_/id/46361972/world-cup-2030-fifa-conmebol-leaders-discuss-64-team-expansion\" target=\"_blank\">The first proposal came in March 2025</a> on behalf of the CONMEBOL and the Uruguayan delegate as the country will likely host one of the first matches of the tournament since the 1930 World Cup took place in Uruguay. If the expansion happens, it could potentially guarantee all the ten CONMEBOL teams a spot in the 2030 World Cup, as only Venezuela has never qualified for the final phase of the most important soccer tournament in the world. After the meeting, Dominguez wrote on his social media, \"We believe in a historic 2030 World Cup! Thank you, President Gianni Infantino, for welcoming us and sharing this journey toward the centennial of football's greatest celebration. We want to call for unity, creativity, and believing big. Because when football is shared by everyone, the celebration is truly global.\"</p>\n<p>Argentina FA president <span>Claudio</span> Chiqui Tapia said: \"I had the honor of being part of the FIFA summit, organized by Gianni Infantino, with the goal of starting to organize what will be the 2030 World Cup.

Circled on the calendar of every golf fanatic, spectator and even the players themselves -- multiple years in advance -- the 2025 Ryder Cup in Farmingdale, New York, is expected to be a golf event few, if any, have ever seen before.</p><p>The biennial event set for Bethpage Black is the setting for where the United States will attempt to reclaim the Ryder Cup on home soil. Winning the last two events held in the United States -- including a record 19 to 9 victory at Whistling Straits in 2021 -- the red, white and blue look to keep this trend alive after Europe got the upper hand at the 2023 playing in Rome.</p><p>Europe, meanwhile, is seeking to become the first road team to win the Ryder Cup since its 2012 team accomplished that feat at Medinah. Returning captain Luke Donald was a player on that squad, as were Rory McIlroy and Justin Rose, as the blue and gold overcame a 10 to 6 deficit on the final day of competition to shock the Americans in what is now dubbed the \"Miracle at Medinah.\"</p><p>The question now is whether the <span><a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/golf/news/ryder-cup-2025-teams-players-breakdown-united-states-europe-bethpage-black/\" target=\"_blank\">continuity of Europe will win out against a somewhat-upstart U.S. squad</a></span> featuring four rookies and some stars not playing to the best of their ability in 2025. CBS Sports' <span><a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/golf/news/ryder-cup-2025-predictions-team-usa-europe-roster-rankings/\" target=\"_blank\">1-24 ranking of the entire Ryder Cup roster</a></span> shows that three of the top four players are European, while the Americans have more consistency and strength through the middle of their lineup.</p>\n<p>In the nearly 100 years of the event, U.S. holds a 27-15-2 series edge. While the Americans are firmly on top overall, the Europeans has enjoyed much more success as of late. Over the 11 Ryder Cups since the turn of the century, Europe has raised the cup eight times, holding a 2-3 record on United States soil.</p><h2>2025 Ryder Cup format, rules</h2><p>The first two days of the Ryder Cup (Friday, Saturday) are firmly entrenched in team-based golf. Golfers from the United States and Europe will compete in two sessions each day: foursomes (alternate shot) in the morning and four-ball (best ball) in the afternoon. Day 3, held Sunday, will see golfers compete head-to-head in singles matches. </p><p><strong>Foursomes (Friday, Saturday morning):</strong> Teams of two from each side square off against one another as golfers alternate hitting the same ball until it is holed. For example: If Player A hits the tee shot on No. 1, he is responsible for teeing off across all odd-numbered holes. Player B will hit the approach into No. 1 with the roles reversing on the even-numbered holes where Player B will hit the tee shots and Player A will go second. </p>\n<p>There is significant strategy involved in forming these pairings with consideration given to equipment, personalities and skillsets. As such, this format has proven crucial to victory across the last two Ryder Cups as the U.S. went 6-2 in 2021 and Europe went 7-1 in 2023.</p><p><strong>Four-ball (Friday, Saturday afternoon):</strong> Teams of two from each side compete with all four golfers playing their own ball. The lowest score between the two players from each team counts for that hole with the other two scores essentially thrown out.</p><p><strong>Singles (Sunday):</strong> The entirety of the American and European sides will compete in 12 one-on-one matches. Unlike the Presidents Cup, where captains announce each spot in their lineup one after another, the Ryder Cup makes it so captains fill out their lineups without the knowledge of what the other side is doing.</p>\n<h2>2025 Ryder Cup scoring</h2><p><strong>Event scoring: </strong>A total of 28 points are up for grabs throughout the three days and five sessions of play. With Europe winning the 2023 Ryder Cup and holding possession of the trophy, it only needs to win 14 points to retain, while the United States needs at least 14.5 points to win outright.</p><p><strong>Match scoring:</strong> Each match is worth 1 point. Matches that end in a tie lead to 0.5 points being awarded to each side. Each hole is scored independently with the lowest score winning. If both teams or players have the same score on a hole, the hole is considered tied.</p><p>There is nuance with match-play scoring. For example: If Team A wins the first two holes, its lead is noted as \"2 UP\". If Team B wins the third hole, the margin would be reduced with Team A holding a \"1 UP\" lead. Matches can therefore end before all 18 holes are played if the lead surpasses the number of remaining holes remaining. Team A being 4 UP through 15 holes would end the match with a score of 4&3 (4 -- margin, 3 -- holes remaining).</p>\n<p><strong>Concessions:</strong> This has become a bit contentious in recent iterations of the Ryder Cup. Unlike stroke play, teams or players do not need to complete each hole if the opposing side deem their next shot highly makable (think: tap-in putt) or if attempting the stroke will not result in winning or tying the hole.</p><h2>2025 Ryder Cup schedule, dates</h2><p><em>All times Eastern</em></p><h3>Wednesday, Sept. 24</h3><p><strong>Opening Ceremony:</strong> 4 p.m.</p><h3>Thursday, Sept. 25</h3><p><strong>Friday pairing announcement:</strong> 4 p.m.</p><h3>Day 1 -- Friday, Sept. 26</h3><p><strong>Session 1 (foursomes):</strong> 7:10 a.m.<br /><strong>Session 2 (four-ball):</strong> 12:25 p.m.</p><h3>Day 2 -- Saturday, Sept. 27</h3><p><strong>Session 3 (foursomes):</strong> 7:10 a.m.<br /><strong>Session 4 (four-ball):</strong> 12:25 p.m.</p><h3>Day 3 -- Sunday, Sept. 28</h3><p><strong>Session 5 (singles):</strong> 12:02 p.m.</p><h2>2025 Ryder Cup teams</h2><h3>Automatic qualifiers</h3><table><tbody><tr><th>United States (OWGR)</th><th>Europe (OWGR)</th></tr><tr><td><p>Scottie Scheffler (1)</p></td><td><p>Rory McIlroy (2)</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Xander Schauffele (3)</p></td><td><p>Tommy Fleetwood (6)</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Russell Henley (4)</p></td><td><p>Robert MacIntyre (9)</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>J.J.

    "body": "<div>\n        <p>The biggest names in golf come to Long Island, New York, this week for the 2025 Ryder Cup, which pits Team USA vs. Team Europe at Bethpage Black, often considered one of the toughest courses in the world. Each team has 12 golfers competing in a match play format, rather than traditional stroke play competition. Team USA includes stars such as Scottie Scheffler,  Bryson DeChambeau and Xander Schauffele, while Team Europe is highlighted by golfers such as Rory McIlroy, Jon Rahm and Tommy Fleetwood. Team USA is the -145 favorite, while Team Europe is a +150 underdog, with a tie priced at +1100 in the latest 2025 Ryder Cup odds.</p><p>The Ryder Cup 2025 tees off on Friday, September 26, and along with betting which team wins, there are plenty of 2025 Ryder Cup props available as <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/betting/\" target=\"_blank\">online sports betting</a> options, including ample longshots that could give sports bettors a significant payday. One of the model's top 2025 Ryder Cup longshot picks is McIlroy, the 2025 Masters champion, as the top point scorer for Team Europe at +300 odds. McIlroy will be competing in his eighth Ryder Cup, and he was the top point scorer for all golfers at the 2023 Ryder Cup, which Team Europe won.</p><p>Now that the 2025 Ryder Cup is finally here, SportsLine simulated the tournament 10,000 times, and revealed its longshot <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/betting/\">betting</a> picks. The model can help you find value to add to your 2025 Ryder Cup picks at various sportsbooks. They can also help new users take advantage of <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/betting/news/sportsbook-promos/\" target=\"_blank\">sportsbook promos</a> like the latest BetMGM bonus code, where new users <a href=\"https://martech.cbssports.com/bt/redirect/prod?b=betmgm&c=sport\" target=\"_blank\">receive up to $1,500 in bonus bets if your first bet loses</a>: </p><h2>Rory McIlroy top Team Europe point scorer (+300)</h2><p>McIlroy went 4-1 in his matches at the 2023 Ryder Cup, as the only golfer for either team to score four points. He's finished with a winning record in match play in four of his seven career Ryder Cups and has earned at least 50% of his possible points in five of seven appearances. McIlroy has competed at Bethpage Black in four PGA Tour events over his career, finishing in the top 10 twice. </p><p>McIlroy is no stranger to facing harsher environments and pressure throughout his career, and with Bethpage Black on Long Island notoriously known for bringing one of the rowdier crowds in golf, the 36-year-old may use any hecklers to lock in even more. McIlroy claimed his first green jacket this year to complete the career Grand Slam, and he had three top-10 finishes over his final five PGA Tour events this season.</p><p>McIlroy has spoken in the past about how much the Ryder Cup means to him, and you can expect him to be near his best this weekend. The model sees value in backing McIlroy as the top European point scorer at +300 odds, which you can do with the latest <span><a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/betting/news/draftkings-promo-code/\" target=\"_blank\">DraftKings promo code</a></span>, which gives new users both $200 in bonus bets with your first $5 bet, and also over $200 off NFL Sunday Ticket. <a href=\"https://martech.cbssports.com/bt/redirect/prod?b=draftkings&c=sport\" target=\"_blank\">Claim the promotion here</a>:</p><h2>Top Team USA Debutant: J.J. Spaun (+370)</h2><p>Spaun is one of four Team USA golfers competing in their first Ryder Cup, and the model sees value in him finishing ahead of the other three. He has the longest odds of the four, behind Cameron Young, Ben Griffin and Russell Henry, the favorite of the four first-timers. Spaun has been at his best in some of the biggest tournaments this season, winning the 2025 U.S. Open, and forcing a playoff at both The Players Championship and FedEx St. Jude Championship, finishing second in each event. Spaun finished second in the Ryder Cup points list to earn an automatic qualifying position for the 2025 Ryder Cup. </p><p>Given his breakout season, the model sees value in backing Spaun to finish ahead of all other first-team Team USA golfers at his current price.

Tigers outfielder <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/players/3117537/riley-greene/\">Riley Greene</a> said Tuesday's series opener \"felt like a playoff game,\" and he stepped up with a homer in the sixth inning.

Wells has only made three starts this season and has been good against right-handed hitters, but it's such a small sample size that we aren't reading into it too much. Historically, Wells has been worse against righties than lefties and carries a somewhat high 1.6 HR/9 rate allowed in his career. He's allowed just 4 runs in three starts this season, but 3 of those were home runs. We set the line at +205 for Caminero to homer, and you can also bet this prop at DraftKings to get <a href=\"https://martech.cbssports.com/bt/redirect/prod?b=draftkings&c=sport\" target=\"_blank\">$200 in bonus bets instantly plus over $200 off NFL Sunday Ticket</a>.  </p><h2>Byron Buxton, Twins (+340, FanDuel)</h2><p>While it might seem scary to bet against <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/players/2044508/jacob-degrom/\">Jacob DeGrom</a>, he's allowed 5 HRs over his last 3 starts, and his 1.3 HR/9 rate is the worst of his career. DeGrom has given up 16 HRs in his last 13 starts after allowing just 9 in his first 16 starts of the season. Buxton is 1-for-2 with a double in his career against DeGrom. We set the line at +298 for Buxton to homer today, and can use the latest <span><a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/betting/news/fanduel-promo-code/\" target=\"_blank\">FanDuel promo code</a></span> to bet this prop and <a href=\"https://martech.cbssports.com/bt/redirect/prod?b=fanduel&c=sport\" target=\"_blank\">get $300 in bonus bets if your first wager of $5 or more wins</a>:</p><h2>Riley Greene, Tigers (+400, BetMGM)</h2><p>The Tigers are really struggling as of late, but Greene is coming off back-to-back two-hit games. He's hit 32 of his 35 HRs this season against right-handed pitchers. Greene hasn't homered in his career against <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/players/28926327/tanner-bibee/\">Tanner Bibee</a>, which is why his line is where it's at. Bibee has been excellent over his last two starts, but we think he's due for some regression and could allow 1 or 2 homers. We set Greene's line at +360 to homer.

But a year later it's easy to wonder if Williams really is the next can't-miss thing.</p><p>The Talent Tracker is certainly not labeling Williams a bust, to be crystal clear. There's a reason why he finished as the <a href=\"https://247sports.com/season/2024-football/recruitrankings/?InstitutionGroup=HighSchool&Position=WR\" target=\"_blank\">No. 3-ranked wide receiver in what continues to look like a generational 2024 wideout class</a>, but it's hard to not notice the dip in production. </p><figure><p><img alt=\"wrs2024.png\" src=\"https://sportshub.cbsistatic.com/i/r/2025/09/24/d74b1901-a501-420a-8794-f0558d89db8e/resize/670x377/76e2d7f3a518f3904c22b1799fb24d6a/wrs2024.png\" /></p><figcaption><span>The top 3 of the 2024 rankings look like future first-round picks.  </span><span>\n                                                                    247Sports\n                                                            </span></figcaption></figure><p>Since the six-catch, 177-yard performance against a UGA defense that had seven defenders selected in the most recent <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://cbssports.com/nfl/draft/\">NFL Draft</a>, Williams has topped the century mark just one other time. That came two weeks ago against Wisconsin, which ranks 92nd nationally in passing defense.</p>\n<p>What makes the trend even more striking is the fact that <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/teams/AUBURN/auburn-tigers/\">Auburn's</a> <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/players/29392432/cam-coleman/\">Cam Coleman</a> -- the second-ranked wide receiver in the 2024 recruiting cycle behind only <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/teams/OHIOST/ohio-state-buckeyes/\">Ohio State's</a> <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/players/29388894/jeremiah-smith/\">Jeremiah Smith</a> -- has started to out-produce Williams despite dealing with suboptimal quarterback play.</p><p><strong>Coleman's last 11 games:</strong> 44 catches for 705 yards and 9 touchdowns </p><p><strong>Williams' last 11 games:</strong> 42 catches for 598 yards and 5 touchdowns.</p><p>Neither matches Smith's numbers or all-time talent, but Coleman is starting to close the gap, at least when it comes to getting in the end zone.</p><p>Stats certainly aren't everything. Not in the world of evaluation. But the eye test is also starting to suggest that the larger and just-as-athletic Coleman has a higher ceiling, especially when trying to project towards Sundays. Smith is in a category of his own (he has 57 catches for 952 yards and 10 TDs in his last 11 games). </p>\n<p>The silver lining for a healthy Williams, who suffered a concussion in the season-opening loss to FSU, is that he's got a prime opportunity to remind the country just how much of a difference-maker he can be when No. 17 Alabama squares off with No. 3 Georgia (7:30 p.m. ET, ABC) on Saturday. It does feel like Georgia can be had a bit, too. </p><p>Williams absolutely torched the Bulldogs in his first showdown with Kirby Smart, producing three explosive plays, including the famous game-winner. He figures to once again see a heavy dose of senior UGA cornerback Daylen Everrett in coverage, but a familiar foe could also end up shadowing him depending on how much Smart & Co. elect to use former five-star <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/players/29389817/ellis-robinson-iv/\">Ellis Robinson IV</a>.</p>\n<p>For as much heat as Williams and other former blue-chip sophomores like <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/teams/FLA/florida-gators/\">Florida</a> quarterback <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/players/28904801/dj-lagway/\">DJ Lagway</a> have gotten since the season kicked off, Robinson's poor play has flown a bit under the national radar. The highest-ranked defender to sign with Georgia in the modern recruiting era surrendered a pair of touchdowns against Tennessee in his first extensive SEC action.</p>\n<p>Much like with Williams, the Talent Tracker isn't ready to write off Robinson as he shut down Coleman, Williams and plenty of others two years ago during practices for the annual Under Armour All-America Game, but a potential battle between Williams and Robinson in Athens would add yet another layer to the game.</p><h2>'White Out' features two must-know tight ends</h2><p>There is no shortage of storylines for No. 6 <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/teams/OREG/oregon-ducks/\">Oregon's</a> trip to No. 3 <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/teams/PSU/penn-state-nittany-lions/\">Penn State</a> (7:30 p.m., NBC).

Penn State sophomore <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/players/29389077/luke-reynolds/\">Luke Reynolds</a> is not. </p><p>Reynolds, the former No. 1-ranked tight end in the 2024 recruiting cycle for 247Sports, is third on the Nittany Lions with 16 targets this season. Many assumed that senior <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/players/26697764/khalil-dinkins/\">Khalil Dinkins</a> would take the torch from Macky Award-winner Tyler Warren in Andy Kotelnicki's blizzard attack, but Reynolds has played nearly as many snaps (120 for Dinkins to 110 for Reynolds).</p>\n<p>The Talent Tracker is in no way surprised that Reynolds is getting a lot of looks from Drew Allar because we thought he was a carbon copy of Warren coming out of high school. Like Warren, Reynolds began his prep career playing quarterback before changing positions. He too was a basketball player in the offseason and the crazy part is that the testing data was almost identical for the two at the same stage.</p><p>Dinkins could very well deliver at a key moment for Penn State in a sea of white, but also keep an eye out for Reynolds and the long blonde hair flowing out of his helmet.</p>\n<h2><strong>Jeremiah Smith's brother commits to Ohio State</strong></h2><p>We're still three months away from the transfer portal opening, but that doesn't mean fanbases can't fantasize about possibly getting Jeremaih Smith for his final year of eligibility. There's zero reason to believe the superstar would leave Ohio State, but that's the world we live in these days and the Buckeyes seem to be well aware. </p><p>This past weekend,<a href=\"https://247sports.com/college/ohio-state/article/breaking-athlete-angelo-smith-commits-to-ohio-state-football-254407720/\" target=\"_blank\"> Ohio State landed a commitment from Smith's younger brother</a>, three-star safety Angelo Smith. On the surface, this looks like Ryan Day and the Buckeyes trying to ensure that Smith and his camp remain happy. That might very well be the case, but here's the thing: Angelo can play, and it's a bit surprising that some of the powerbrokers in the NIL space didn't try and make a run at Angelo in hopes of wooing Jeremiah.</p>\n<p>Angelo started in the secondary last year for a Hollywood Chaminade-Madonna Prep program that won a Florida 1A state title. He opened up his junior campaign with an interception against Baltimore's St. Frances Academy. Many will be quick to knock Angelo's size, but what many don't realize is that Angelo is tracking to start college well before his 18th birthday and that Jeremiah -- believe it or not -- wasn't always the most hulking individual.</p>\n<p>Will Angelo morph into a Greek God like Jeremiah? Probably not, but he's a high-IQ football player that's surprisingly physical for someone of his stature. Credit Ohio State for not over-thinking things.</p>\n            </div>"

    "body": "<div>\n        <p>The <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/teams/NYM/new-york-mets/\">New York Mets</a> might end up missing the playoffs. At best, they're threatening to do so. After Tuesday's win, along with some help from the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/teams/PIT/pittsburgh-pirates/\">Pirates</a>, they took back a one-game lead over the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/teams/CIN/cincinnati-reds/\">Reds</a> for the third National League wild card spot, but they certainly aren't out of the woods here.  On a team level, missing the postseason would be a disaster of an outcome given the huge offseason they had, their payroll (over $340 million, second in <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://cbssports.com/mlb/\">MLB</a> behind the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/teams/LAD/los-angeles-dodgers/\">Dodgers</a>), their NLCS berth last season and, most importantly, the fact that they had the best record in baseball through June 12. </p><p>As part of a big Mets offseason, one perhaps recalls that they signed <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/players/2507367/juan-soto/\">Juan Soto</a> to a record 15-year, $765 million contract. With that kind of deal and this kind of collapse, the mindless, knee-jerk take would be to somehow blame Soto. It would be totally foolish, but that comes with the territory sometimes.</p><p>The thing is, Soto is having an outstanding season and it's one of the better and more well-rounded seasons of his career. There's only so much one man can do in baseball and Soto has operated on a very high level this season.</p>\n<p>Soto is hitting .267/.399/.532 (164 OPS+) with 20 doubles, a triple, 42 home runs, 104 RBI, 118 runs, 36 stolen bases and 6.4 WAR. Excluding the partial 2020 season, this is his third-best OPS+ and it's his third-highest WAR. He's set a new career high in home runs and isn't far off his career high in RBI or runs. He leads the National League in OBP. I'm sure some would scoff at the batting average, but the league average is .246 so he's clear of that by 21 points. We'll get to the stolen bases soon, but he has more this season than 2021-24 combined.</p>\n<p>Soto sits third in the NL in Baseball Reference's WAR and he's fifth in FanGraphs' version. Shohei Ohtani is all but guaranteed to win the National League MVP award, but Soto (+2500, per <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/betting/news/draftkings-promo-code/\">DraftKings</a>) has been one of the best in the league.</p><p>You can't make the \"Soto isn't a winner\" argument either. Soto won the World Series with the 2019 <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/teams/WAS/washington-nationals/\">Nationals</a>, advanced to the NLCS with the 2022 <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/teams/SD/san-diego-padres/\">Padres</a> and got back to the World Series with the 2024 <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/teams/NYY/new-york-yankees/\">Yankees</a>. Even if these people think there's some sort of winner's gene, Soto has shown plenty of times from this point of view that he has it.</p><p>And in 2025, he's been one of the most valuable players in the league. </p><p>Sure, Soto did start the season slow and it's possible the pressure of the contract had something to do with it. It's also possible it was just a bad stretch. They happen. He was hitting .229/.367/.430 through June 5. The Mets were winning then, though, and Soto has been one of the biggest offensive forces in baseball since, slashing .293/.421/.600 with 31 home runs in 93 games since.</p>\n<p>Anyway, let's get back to those stolen bases. Soto leads the Mets. Yes, he's stolen more bases than <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/players/1894627/francisco-lindor/\">Francisco Lindor</a>. In fact, Soto had never previously stolen more than 12 bases in a season and he only had seven last year, yet he trails only five players in stolen bases in the majors this season. </p><p>He's 36 of 40 in stolen base attempts, too, so his success rate is an excellent 90% compared to a league average of 77.7%. He's increased his attempted steals as the season has progressed and he's gotten more comfortable running. He was just 2 for 2 by the end of April, went 5 for 5 in May, 2 for 3 in June and then things started to pick up. Soto went 6 for 6 in July, a whopping 11 for 11 in August and so far is 10 for 13 in September.</p><p>\"Definitely, a lot of hard work was put in since the beginning of the season,\" Soto said, via <a href=\"https://www.mlb.com/news/juan-soto-joins-30-30-club-with-30th-stolen-base-of-2025-season\" target=\"_blank\">MLB.com</a>, of his increased aggression on the bases this season. \"[First-base coach] Antoan [Richardson] has done an unbelievable job. He's been helping me since Day 1. So I give him all the credit. He's the one who put me in this situation and in this spot to do what I've done.\"</p>\n<p>As noted, Soto also has set a new career high with 42 home runs. Along with his newfound stolen base prowess, he's getting up into rarified air on the list of power-speed combo guys in <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://cbssports.com/mlb/\">MLB</a> history. </p><p>Soto now has one of just 76 30-30 seasons in <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://cbssports.com/mlb/\">MLB</a> history, though those are becoming more common with the new stolen base rules. There were four in 2023, three last season and four so far this year. Still, Soto has joined Darryl Strawberry, Howard Johnson (three times), <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/players/483349/david-wright/\">David Wright</a> and Lindor as the only Mets to ever have a 30-30 season. </p><p>But Soto doesn't just have a mere 30 home runs and 30 steals. There have only been 16 40-30 seasons -- that is, 40 home runs and 30 steals -- to date from 13 players: Henry Aaron, Jose Canseco, Barry Bonds (twice), Ellis Burks, Jeff Bagwell (twice), Larry Walker, Alex Rodriguez, Alfonso Soriano, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/players/1103045/ryan-braun/\">Ryan Braun</a>, Ronald Acuña Jr. (twice), <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/players/1765815/christian-yelich/\">Christian Yelich</a>, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/players/2901324/shohei-ohtani/\">Shohei Ohtani</a> and Soto. </p>\n<p>What if we adjust the parameters to 40-35? I know people don't really do that because we like nice, round numbers, but Soto is joined only by Canseco, Bonds (twice), A-Rod, Soriano, Acuña (twice) and Ohtani there. </p><p>This been a remarkable season for Juan Soto. That the Mets' playoff spot is in jeopardy is an indictment of the rest of the team, not him.</p>\n            </div>"
