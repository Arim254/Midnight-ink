    "body": "<div>\n        <p>The UFC bantamweight championship has produced flashes of brilliance but never the enduring grandeur of other divisions. Anderson Silva nor Georges St-Pierre anchor its history. Reigning champion Merab Dvalishvili is on the verge of changing that.</p><p>Dvalishvili defends the UFC bantamweight title against Cory Sandhagen <span><a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mma/news/ufc-320-magomed-ankalaev-vs-alex-pereira-2-fight-card-date-odds-rumors-location-complete-guide/\" target=\"_blank\">at UFC 320</a></span>. He enters as a heavy four-to-one favorite against the challenger. He also eyes a rematch against Petr Yan before the year's end, which would mark an astonishing fourth title defense in a calendar year. If Dvalishvili beats Sandhagen and Yan again, as he did in a lopsided decision two years ago, it would cement what many already call the best bantamweight run ever.  </p><p>\"I want to be busy. I'm healthy, and I want to set a record with four UFC title fights in one year,\" Dvalishvili told CBS Sports. \"That would be great on my resume.\"</p><p>Dvalishvili's push for four title fights in 12 months underscores his drive. The native of Georgia opened 2025 with a win over Umar Nurmagomedov where he entered the fight as a betting underdog to the cousin of legendary lightweight champion Khabib Nurmagomedov. He passed that test with flying colors before being booked for a rematch with Sean O'Malley in June, where he scored a brutal submission of the former titleholder.</p>\n<p>Instead of giving himself an extra month or so to heal from Saturday's fight to may be get booked on the upcoming December PPV to close out 2025, Merab wants to fight at Madison Square Garden on Nov. 15 for UFC 322 -- just six weeks later.</p><a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mma/news/ufc-320-alex-pereira-gets-his-chance-at-redemption-after-rare-humbling-loss-against-magomed-ankalaev/\" target=\"_blank\">\n        <div>\n            <div>\n                <p>UFC 320: Alex Pereira gets his chance at redemption after rare humbling loss against Magomed Ankalaev</p>\n                <p>\n                    Brian Campbell                </p>\n            </div>\n                            <div>\n    <figure><img alt=\"UFC 320: Alex Pereira gets his chance at redemption after rare humbling loss against Magomed Ankalaev\" src=\"https://sportshub.cbsistatic.com/i/r/2025/10/01/708592ee-b8e1-443c-ae13-300a57f2abc9/thumbnail/270x152/54e07dd73f63a36081fb6cd613ed5c3c/pereira-yell-ufc-313.jpg\" /></figure>\n                </div>\n                    </div>\n    </a>\n<p>It sounds reckless, but Dvalishvili isn't one for empty promises.</p><p>Dvalishvili already owns the longest win streak in bantamweight history (12). He's two victories shy of tying Aljamain Sterling's divisional wins record and Dillashaw's five title defenses. Looking at the current contenders, it's believable he'll get there. He's beaten everyone in the UFC's bantamweight top five except Sandhagen.</p><p>Zoom out, and the records keep piling up. He recently passed St-Pierre for most UFC takedowns (97) and is poised to be the first to hit triple digits. His 13-fight winning streak -- including a catchweight bout -- ties him with GSP, Jon Jones, Demetrious Johnson, Khabib Nurmagomedov and Max Holloway. Three more wins would match Silva's 16-fight streak, untouched for 13 years. </p>\n<p>\"Hard work got me here. I don't think I'm special...\" Dvalishvili previously told CBS Sports. \"I still have the same motivation as before. I'm still trying to be a   better version of myself. Yes, I'm a champion. I have this status and   respect. But I'm a regular guy. </p><p>\"I tell people, 'You have to work hard.'   Sometimes hard work beats talent. I think that's who I am. I'm still   trying to improve. I'm still trying to work harder and get better. I  want to keep this belt, make new records and inspire more people.\" </p><p><strong><em>Check out the full interview with Merab Dvalishvili below.</em></strong>  </p>\n<p>Still, to say bantamweight never had a great champion would overlook those who laid the groundwork for what Dvalishvili is chasing.</p>\n<p>Dominick Cruz set the standard from the beginning. As reigning WEC champion, he was awarded the inaugural UFC bantamweight title at the promotion's final event before its merger. Cruz beat \"Mighty Mouse\" in his first defense before vacating due to injuries. Four years later, he made a thunderous return, dethroning TJ Dillashaw to become a two-time champ. But a one-sided loss to Cody Garbrandt and recurring health issues stalled his UFC legacy, even if his WEC reign is untouchable.  </p><p>Dillashaw has the next best claim. A two-time champion, he revolutionized the division with elusive movement and finishing instincts. His bitter feud with ex-teammate Garbrandt remains the best rivalry in the division's history. But losses to Cruz and Henry Cejudo, and a career-ending shoulder injury, kept him from closing the case as the bantamweight G.O.A.T.</p><p>Dvalishvili is primed to be the storied champion bantamweight lacks -- one who can enter pound-for-pound, all-time conversations without being immediately laughed out of the room. Some, <span><a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mma/news/ufc-316-sean-omalley-calls-merab-dvalishvili-the-greatest-bantamweight-of-all-time-after-second-loss/\" target=\"_blank\">including rival Sean O'Malley</a></span>, already call him the best. Fittingly, it's not a label the Georgian-born, American immigrant -- whose self-belief stems from humility and hard work -- is willing to claim. </p>\n<p>\"I will never call myself the best bantamweight,\" Dvalishvili said. \"I am still an active fighter... Maybe when I finish my career, I'll call myself what I was. But right now, I'm active and my goal is to continue step-by-step moving forward.\"</p>\n            </div>"

Seven months ago, Magomed Ankalaev beat Pereira for the UFC light heavyweight championship. \"Poatan\" has a chance to redeem himself in a title rematch at UFC 320 on Saturday at T-Mobile Arena in Las Vegas.</p><p>Pereira became a key player for the UFC through activity, defending his title four times in 13 months. A string of vicious knockouts made him a fan-favorite, but Ankalaev nullified that threat <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mma/news/ufc-313-results-highlights-magomed-ankalaev-upsets-alex-pereira-to-claim-light-heavyweight-title/live/\" target=\"_blank\">at UFC 313</a>. Ankalaev, widely believed to be the better wrestler, outstruck Pereira in a largely forgettable fight. Pereira tries to redeem his surprisingly tepid last showing, while Ankalaev tries to cement himself as unequivocally the better man.</p><p>UFC 320's co-main event is a fight fans have wanted for a long time. UFC bantamweight champion Merab Dvalishvili is on a dominant run after beating Sean O'Malley (twice) and Umar Nurmagomedov. Dvalishvili can extend his record for the longest bantamweight win streak by fending off his next challenger. Cory Sandhagen has long been tabbed as a future champion. After repeatedly falling just short of a breakout, \"The Sandman\" finally gets his shot at undisputed gold.</p><p>Plus, the undercard could produce a new contender to the 205-pound title in the main event. Former champion Jiri Prochazka looks to stay relevant atop the division when he takes on former title challenger Khalil Rountree Jr. Prochazka has suffered a pair of brutal knockout losses to Pereira in title fights. But the native of the Czech Republic has been a forced in every other fight he's had in UFC. Prochazka is coming off a vicious knockout of Jamahal Hill in January. Rountree Jr., meanwhile, has also been on quite the run of late. His only loss in the last three years came against Pereira as well, but the American has been on a destructive run outside of that fight with a 6-1 record that includes four knockouts.</p>\n<p>Below is the complete fight card for UFC 320, along with the latest odds.

North Carolina just isn't living up to the Bill Belichick hype at 2-2 and having been outscored 82-23 against Power Four competition. Clemson, for its part, went from preseason national title contender to a disastrous 1-3. Still, Clemson isn't a bad team. North Carolina might be. The Tigers win the lines of scrimmage and finally look more like themselves coming out of a bye week. -- <em>Clemson 38, North Carolina 20.</em></p><p><strong>Crawford (Clemson -13.5)</strong>: Is Clemson capable of covering any spread the remainder of the season as a favorite? I have questions. Which one of these teams will be be better prepared coming off a bye week? And for the Tigers, how much do they still care with end-of-season goals essentially over? These are all factors to consider when making this play. There's the obvious talent discrepancy as well, but that hasn't helped Dabo Swinney's much through four games. -- <em>Clemson 27, North Carolina 10.</em></p><h2><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/teams/BOISE/boise-state-broncos/\">Boise State</a> at No. 21 Notre Dame</h2>\n<p><strong>Hummer (Notre Dame -17.5)</strong>: This line is climbing the wrong direction for Boise State midway through this week. But it should be noted that Brad and I pick the lines as of Sunday. Thus, the value is with Notre Dame. Boise State is good. The Broncos are strong defensively, particularly in the secondary, and they're going to be a tough test. But Notre Dame's scored on everyone this year, and I'm hesitant to bet on a Boise State offense that's a middling 61st in offensive success rate. If there's an area of vulnerability for Notre Dame it's in the secondary, but <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/players/28921239/maddux-madsen/\">Maddux Madsen</a> has just been OK (69th in QBR) and I haven't seen enough from the Broncos to think they'll light it up through the air. Give me the Irish to cover. -- <em>Notre Dame 35, Boise State 17.</em></p>\n<p><strong>Crawford (Boise State +17.5)</strong>: The Irish might be overvalued a bit here after just hanging 50-plus at Arkansas, but they're certainly a team that looks to be hitting their stride since opening with losses to <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/teams/MIAMI/miami-fla-hurricanes/\">Miami</a> and <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/teams/TXAM/texas-am-aggies/\">Texas A&M</a>. And while improved, there are still areas of weakness to sort out defensively at Notre Dame before mentioning \"playoff\" and \"Irish\" in the same sentence moving forward. I'll take the underdogs to cover here. -- <em>Notre Dame 38, Boise State 23.</em></p><h2><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/teams/MICHST/michigan-state-spartans/\">Michigan State</a> at <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/teams/NEB/nebraska-cornhuskers/\">Nebraska</a></h2>\n<p><strong>Hummer (Michigan State +11.5)</strong>: This could be a big day for <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/players/29392540/dylan-raiola/\">Dylan Raiola</a> and the Huskers passing attack, because the Spartans have been horrendous this year defending the pass at 116th in success rate and 117th nationally in passing yards allowed per game. The question becomes can Michigan State's offense score enough against what is an excellent Nebraska secondary to keep up? I think Michigan State does enough coming out of a bye to keep this close. -- <em>Nebraska 34, Michigan State 24.</em></p><p><strong>Crawford (Michigan State +11.5)</strong>: Any believers in Nebraska yet? The home loss to <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/teams/MICH/michigan-wolverines/\">Michigan</a> was a missed opportunity for Matt Rhule, who still hasn't beaten a nationally-ranked opponent with Huskers. The Spartans aren't ranked, but they did cover at <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/teams/USC/usc-trojans/\">USC</a> this month and have an offense capable of keeping it within the number. If Nebraska leaves the back door open, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/players/28897339/aidan-chiles/\">Aidan Chiles</a> will deliver with a touchdown pass to cash. -- <em>Nebraska 31, Michigan State 24.</em></p>\n<h2>No. 14 <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/teams/IOWAST/iowa-state-cyclones/\">Iowa State</a> at <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/teams/CINCY/cincinnati-bearcats/\">Cincinnati</a></h2>\n<p><strong>Hummer (Cincinnati -1.5)</strong>: The Bearcats are much better this year, but I'm still a little surprised to see them favored over a ranked Iowa State team. But Vegas doesn't care about records or rankings, and the Bearcats have been playing great. To me this game comes down to one area: How does Cincinnati's pass defense holds up? I have full confidence the Bearcats can score. That unit's been awesome at third nationally in yards per play. But the Cincinnati secondary has been a disaster at 132nd nationally in defensive success rate against the pass. Can <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/players/28877490/rocco-becht/\">Rocco Becht</a> take advantage? I'm not sure. High-scoring, high-volume games aren't how Iowa State usually wins. Give me the Bearcats. -- <em>Cincinnati 27, Iowa State 24.</em></p><p><strong>Crawford (Cincinnati -1.5)</strong>: If you're keeping tabs on games featuring an unranked team being favored at home against a ranked opponent, it hits more often than not. We saw it happen last week when then-unbeaten <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/teams/TCU/tcu-horned-frogs/\">TCU</a> was an underdog at Arizona State. Another scenario could be unfolding here in the unpredictable Big 12. Iowa State's unbeaten, but this will be its first road game against a conference opponent this fall. -- <em>Cincinnati 23, Iowa State 20.</em></p><h2><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/teams/MISSST/mississippi-state-bulldogs/\">Mississippi State</a> at No. 6 Texas A&M</h2>\n<p><strong>Hummer (Mississippi State +13.5)</strong>: Unlike Auburn over the weekend, Mississippi State is capable enough on offense to stress a Texas A&M defense that's had some shaky moments early this year. It also helps that quietly the Bulldogs' defense has been excellent at 32nd nationally in yards allowed per play. <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/players/3168291/blake-shapen/\">Blake Shapen</a> needs to recapture some of his early-season form, but I think this sets up well for a Mississippi State cover. I wouldn't even rule out an upset if the Bulldogs can force a few turnovers. -- <em>Texas A&M 34, Mississippi State 21.</em></p>\n<p><strong>Crawford (Mississippi State +13.5)</strong>: Mississippi State is 5-0 ATS this season and could've beaten <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/teams/TENN/tennessee-volunteers/\">Tennessee</a> outright last week as a 7.5-point underdog at home before the Vols forced overtime. Texas A&M failed to cover at home against Auburn and needed its top defensive performance of the season to down the Tigers. The Aggies should stay unbeaten, but take the points here. And if you can get 14 points or more by kickoff, even better. -- <em>Texas A&M 34, Mississippi State 24.</em></p><h2>No. 9 <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/teams/TEXAS/texas-longhorns/\">Texas</a> at <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/teams/FLA/florida-gators/\">Florida</a> </h2>\n<p><strong>Hummer (Texas -7.5)</strong>: This is a tough game for Florida. Unless we see a very different offensive product from <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/players/28904801/dj-lagway/\">DJ Lagway</a> and the Gators passing attack, Florida will really struggle against one of the elite defenses in college football. And while the Gators defense has held up admirably for much of the year, the injuries are starting to pile up for that unit, especially along the defensive line. Maybe Florida comes out of the bye week and looks totally different. It's possible. But based on what we've seen so far, I'll take Texas to cover. -- <em>Texas 27, Florida 17.</em></p><p><strong>Crawford (Texas -7.5)</strong>: Statement coming from <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/players/29122638/arch-manning/\">Arch Manning</a>? His first SEC start of the season is the most important on this Texas schedule. It's difficult to imagine the Longhorns being a factor in the league title race or playoff conversation if they fall to a team amid a significant decline. Billy Napier's offense has no rhythm and going up against a defense littered with stars, that's a bad omen. -- <em>Texas 24, Florida 10.</em></p>\n<h2>No. 11 <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/teams/TXTECH/texas-tech-red-raiders/\">Texas Tech</a> at <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/teams/HOU/houston-cougars/\">Houston</a></h2>\n<p><strong>Hummer (Texas Tech -10.5)</strong>: I enter this game wondering if Houston can score enough to keep up with Texas Tech. The Cougars are better on that side of the ball but still rank just 86th nationally in yards per play and 116th in offensive success rate. That could be a problem against what's been an elite Texas Tech defense and an offensive unit capable of putting up points in bunches. Houston's defense keeps this game close for a while, but Texas Tech is going to be tough to beat coming out of a bye week. -- <em>Texas Tech 28, Houston 17.</em></p><p><strong>Crawford (Houston +10.5)</strong>: We're keeping the Red Raiders as the projected Big 12 champion this week, but Joey McGuire's team is marked and is no more upset proof than many other remaining unbeatens. Unlike most Texas Tech wins, this one could take more of the methodical approach against an opponent whose front seven defensively may struggle getting push. But if you're giving me 10.5 points with an unranked team at home coached by Willie Fritz, I'm taking it. -- <em>Texas Tech 31, Houston 23.</em></p><h2><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/teams/WISC/wisconsin-badgers/\">Wisconsin</a> at No. 20 Michigan</h2>\n<p><strong>Hummer (Wisconsin +16.5)</strong>: Does Wisconsin look any better coming out of the bye week? That's the big question entering this one. It helps the Badgers' case that Billy Edwards is back under center as QB1. But the Badgers still must figure out a way to consistently run the football. Michigan, outside of big runs by <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/players/29123679/justice-haynes/\">Justice Haynes</a>, isn't usually particularly explosive offensively, so that works in Wisconsin's favor in terms of keeping this close. Michigan is better, but the Badgers manage to cover in an important game for Luke Fickell. -- <em>Michigan 31, Wisconsin 20. </em></p>\n<p><strong>Crawford (Michigan -16.5)</strong>: It's show me time for Fickell and the Badgers. Too often Wisconsin has come out flat under this current regime in big games, so here's a chance at reversing those fortunes in Ann Arbor. The best play here would be taking the under, but if you must pick a side, Michigan with a late cover in a potentially ugly game feels like the right spot to put your money. -- <em>Michigan 30, Wisconsin 13.</em></p><h2>No. 16 <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/teams/VANDY/vanderbilt-commodores/\">Vanderbilt</a> at No. 10 <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/teams/BAMA/alabama-crimson-tide/\">Alabama</a></h2>\n<p><strong>Hummer (Vanderbilt +13.5)</strong>: Vanderbilt is a product with which I know exactly what to expect. The Commodores are going to control the clock, efficiently move the football and avoid defensive mistakes that lead to explosive plays. Alabama? The Crimson Tide are more talented, but we've seen some very uneven performances from them this year. This game comes down to two areas to me: 1. How does a just OK Vanderbilt offensive line hold up? 2. Can Alabama establish any sort of run game and avoid making <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/players/28878532/ty-simpson/\">Ty Simpson</a> carry the offense? I do think Alabama gets revenge at home. But Vanderbilt is going to make it difficult. -- <em>Alabama 34, Vanderbilt 27.</em></p><p><strong>Crawford (Vanderbilt +13.5)</strong>: Vanderbilt's not going to beat Alabama for a second straight year, but this line feels disrespectful to the Commodores. Knowing what <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/players/28873851/diego-pavia/\">Diego Pavia</a> was able to do against this defense last season should worry Alabama fans, especially since he's red-hot again through five games. Vanderbilt's been beating the opposition by more than four touchdowns per game this fall, but that changes this weekend. -- <em>Alabama 38, Vanderbilt 27.</em></p>\n<h2>No. 3 Miami at No. 18 <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/teams/FSU/florida-state-seminoles/\">Florida State</a></h2>\n<p><strong>Hummer (Miami -5.5)</strong>: This is going to be a fun test for Miami's revamped defense. It takes so much discipline to play Florida State's offense led by Gus Malzahn and <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/players/28875815/tommy-castellanos/\">Tommy Castellanos</a>, and the Hurricanes have historically (and at times this year) had issues with busts and tackling. At the same time, I'm not particularly optimistic about Florida State's defense generating much pressure against what is the best O-line in college football. Both these teams are good. But Miami has the better roster and has the advantage of coming off a bye. Give me the Hurricanes. -- <em>Miami 35, Florida State 28.</em></p><p><strong>Crawford (Miami -5.5)</strong>: I was admittedly surprised Virginia had as much success offensively as it did against the Seminoles, which resulted in an inexcusable road loss for Mike Norvell despite a sizable talent advantage. Here, it is Miami's turn to flex its roster after an open date. Can Florida State block this Hurricanes' front? That's where the game will be won. Pressuring Castellanos is key for the unbeaten Hurricanes. -- <em>Miami 27, Florida State 20.</em></p>\n            </div>"

It was <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/players/29086560/ben-rice/\">Ben Rice</a> early and <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/players/2507358/jazz-chisholm-jr/\">Jazz Chisholm Jr.</a> late Wednesday night at Yankee Stadium, extending New York's season with a Game 2 win (<a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/gametracker/boxscore/MLB_20251001_BOS@NYY/\" target=\"_blank\">NYY 4, BOS 3</a>). Thursday's Game 3 will send one team to the ALDS to face the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/teams/TOR/toronto-blue-jays/\">Toronto Blue Jays</a> and the other home.  </p><p>Rice did not start Game 1 against <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/players/2836763/garrett-crochet/\">Garrett Crochet</a> because he's a lefty hitter who can have trouble with lefties, and also because <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/players/1765052/paul-goldschmidt/\">Paul Goldschmidt</a> crushed lefties in 2025. Rice and Goldschmidt make for a natural platoon. It has been tough sledding the last few weeks for Goldschmidt though. Rice, meanwhile, went 10 for 23 with three homers in his final six regular-season games.  </p><p>\"Being aggressive to where and what I am looking for in the zone,\" Rice said after the game about his recent hot streak. \"Always  coming up with a plan, being convicted in that, and just being ready to  go.\"</p><a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/news/mlb-playoff-bracket-schedule-2025/\" target=\"_blank\">\n        <div>\n            <div>\n                <p>2025 MLB playoff bracket: Schedule, scores as Dodgers advance, Yankees-Red Sox, more series go to Game 3</p>\n                <p>\n                    Kate Feldman                </p>\n            </div>\n                            <div>\n    <figure><img alt=\"2025 MLB playoff bracket: Schedule, scores as Dodgers advance, Yankees-Red Sox, more series go to Game 3\" src=\"https://sportshub.cbsistatic.com/i/r/2025/10/02/bca9b677-47e3-4b9a-87fe-7eb2c859f141/thumbnail/270x152/c9a4d2adfcc2e4df9fdfcce80727a2e4/mlb-bracket-dodgers-advance.jpg\" /></figure>\n                </div>\n                    </div>\n    </a>\n<p>In the first inning of Game 2, Rice hit the very first pitch he saw in the series into the right field seats for a quick 2-0 Yankees lead. <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/players/26615413/brayan-bello/\">Brayan Bello</a> left a cement mixer out over the plate and Rice did what he's been doing all season: hit the ball hard in the air. His underlying batted ball data and contact rates are exceptional. Among the best in baseball, in fact. Swings like this are a perfect example:  </p>\n<p>Rice is the first Yankee to hit a home run in his first career postseason at-bat since Shane Spencer the Home Run Dispenser back in 1998. He's only the sixth player this century to hit a home run on his first career postseason pitch. </p><p>\"I know my role,\" Rice said when asked if it was difficult to be out of the lineup in Game 1. \"And yesterday my role was to be ready for a big at-bat off the bench, and today I was starting. The approach doesn't change. I mean, I am just going to be prepared for every at-bat I get and every chance I get.\"</p><p>Like Rice, Chisholm did not start against Crochet because he's a lefty who's had trouble against lefties. Also, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/players/2117042/amed-rosario/\">Amed Rosario</a> entered the game 6 for 9 with a home run against Crochet, so he drew the start at second. Chisholm did enter Game 1 in the late innings and flew out in New York's failed ninth-inning rally. After the game, he made it pretty clear wasn't happy being out of the lineup.</p>\n<p>\"I guess, yeah,\" Chisholm said Tuesday with his back turned to reporters when asked if he was surprised to be out of the lineup after Game 1. \"... It's always tough watching when your team's down.\"  </p><p>How did Chisholm handle the disappointment?</p><p>\"I played MLB The Show and mercy ruled someone,\" he explained, adding he has Ken Griffey Jr. on his custom New York Aliens team. \"That's how I get my stress off.\"</p><p>In Game 2, Chisholm's contributions came on both sides of the ball. He saved at least one run in the seventh inning with a diving stop on <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/players/29041593/masataka-yoshidas/\">Masataka Yoshida's</a> ground ball back up in the middle, more or less the same ball Yoshida hit that drove in two runs in Game 1. Chisholm did not get an out on the play, but keeping the ball on the infield forced the runner to hold up at third.  </p>\n<p>The next batter, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/players/1945488/trevor-story/\">Trevor Story</a>, flew out to deep center field to strand the bases loaded and keep the game tied 3-3.  </p><p>\"You see a ground ball, you got to stop it.  You have to keep it in the infield.  You have to stop that run from scoring,\" Chisholm said about his diving play in the seventh. \"I felt at that point it would have been a really crucial run.  I  was doing what I could to keep the ball in the infield.  Not trying to  make the play at first base but keep it in the infield.  I caught the  ball, I was like maybe I could make it at first base.  At the end of the  day, it is stopping that run from scoring.\"</p><p>Chisholm's eyes and legs built New York's game-winning run in the eighth. He worked a seven-pitch, two-out walk against <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/players/2837680/garrett-whitlock/\">Garrett Whitlock</a> to give the Yankees a little life. The next batter, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/players/26615315/austin-wells/\">Austin Wells</a>, roped a single to right field, and, because it hit the side wall at a weird angle, it caromed away from right fielder <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/players/3158300/nate-eaton/\">Nate Eaton</a>. That allowed Chisholm to score all the way from first base.  </p>\n<p>\"Going through my head, I am already running, so any ball that an  outfielder moves to his left or right, I have to score, in my head,\" Chisholm said. \"That's all I was thinking.\"</p><p>The Red Sox will start lefty <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/players/29658250/connelly-early/\">Connelly Early</a> in Game 3 and Yankees manager Aaron Boone said Chisholm will be in the lineup. The Yankees will get together and think about the first base situation, though it would be awfully tough to have Rice on the bench again. He's blistered everything the last few weeks, including his first-inning homer in Game 2. The best lineup includes him.  </p><p>Whatever the lineup is going to be in Game 3 is whatever the lineup is going to be in Game 3. We'll find out Thursday. In Game 2 though, two players who were not trusted enough to be in the Game 1 lineup made impact plays. Rice opened the scoring with his homer and Chisholm saved a run with his glove and created a run with his legs. They gave the Yankees the shot in the arm they lacked Tuesday.  </p>\n<p>\"I feel like every game is a must-win.  For us, we want to win every  day. Any other professional athlete thinking about a game they  want to play, it is a must-win,\" Chisholm said about Game 3. \"We always put everything out there on the line, especially the  playoffs.  We want to give every game.  There's no space.  You don't  want to give any team an edge.  Obviously a must-win.\"</p>\n            </div>"

    "body": "<div>\n        <p><span>CHICAGO –</span> We've become a bit habituated to all the triple-digit fastballs and sharp, unhittable late movement populating Major League Baseball these days. Relievers especially have been bred and fed to max out velocity, and so many of them regularly clock readings that would've been unthinkable less than a generation ago. And there's <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/players/26911802/mason-miller/\">Mason Miller</a>, the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/teams/SD/san-diego-padres/\">San Diego Padres</a>' fire-breathing high-leverage reliever and the club's flagship trade-deadline addition. </p><p>However routine \"pitch nastiness\" has become for the regular observer of this sport, a pitcher like Miller still redefines what we think a ball leaving a human hand should be able to do. Miller loudly reminded us of this during the later innings of the San Diego Padres' 3-0 win over the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/teams/CHC/chicago-cubs/\">Chicago Cubs</a> (<a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/gametracker/recap/MLB_20251001_SD@CHC/\" target=\"_blank\">box score</a>) in Wednesday's Game 2 of the National League Wild Card Series. </p><a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/news/mlb-playoff-bracket-schedule-2025/\" target=\"_blank\">\n        <div>\n            <div>\n                <p>2025 MLB playoff bracket: Schedule, scores as Dodgers advance, Yankees-Red Sox, more series go to Game 3</p>\n                <p>\n                    Kate Feldman                </p>\n            </div>\n                            <div>\n    <figure><img alt=\"2025 MLB playoff bracket: Schedule, scores as Dodgers advance, Yankees-Red Sox, more series go to Game 3\" src=\"https://sportshub.cbsistatic.com/i/r/2025/10/02/bca9b677-47e3-4b9a-87fe-7eb2c859f141/thumbnail/270x152/c9a4d2adfcc2e4df9fdfcce80727a2e4/mlb-bracket-dodgers-advance.jpg\" /></figure>\n                </div>\n                    </div>\n    </a>\n<p>With the Padres down 0-1 in the best-of-three set and thus facing elimination, Miller got the call from manager Mike Shildt after starter <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/players/2211754/dylan-cease/\">Dylan Cease</a> and All-Star lefty setup man Adrián Morejón combined for six scoreless. Staked to a 3-0 lead that he would maintain, Miller struck out <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/players/27023012/seiya-suzuki/\">Seiya Suzuki</a>, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/players/2044542/carson-kelly/\">Carson Kelly</a>, and <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/players/26615365/pete-crow-armstrong/\">Pete Crow-Armstrong</a> in the seventh. Then in the eighth, Miller struck out <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/players/2184343/dansby-swanson/\">Dansby Swanson</a> and Moisés Ballesteros before just nicking the pant leg of <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/players/3117931/michael-busch/\">Michael Busch</a> with a 1-0 backfoot slider that back-footed just a bit too much. At that point, Shildt went to closer <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/players/26861461/robert-suarez/\">Robert Suarez</a> for what would be a four-out save. The relevant moving pictures: </p><p>Through the magic of color television sports programming, let's revisit strike three to Kelly because in some ways it's \"The Mason Miller Experience\" distilled down to a single pitch with which the batter can do nothing but genuflect before it: </p>\n<p>Yes, as claimed, that's that 104.5 mph four-seamer is the fastest postseason pitch on record. Given that probably no one was throwing 104.5 mph before we had reliable means to measure such things, yes, it's probably the fastest pitch anyone has ever thrown in the playoffs. </p><p>\"104, we like that,\" Shildt said after Game 2 while complimenting Miller's \"pretty impressive\" outing. </p><p>Miller in Game 2 threw 11 fastballs, and those were the 11 fastest pitches thrown by anyone in Game 2. He averaged 103 mph with it. Miller on Wednesday got six whiffs on 10 swings and, looping in his Game 1 performance on Tuesday, he's now struck out eight of the nine batters he's faced in this series. That's against a Cubs offense that during the regular season was one of the toughest in <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://cbssports.com/mlb/\">MLB</a> to strike out. </p>\n<p>All of this raises the necessary matter of whether Miller will be available for Thursday's game, which will decide whether the Padres or Cubs advance to face the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/teams/MIL/milwaukee-brewers/\">Milwaukee Brewers</a> in the Division Series. Shildt after Game 2 addressed that pressing matter: </p><blockquote><p>\"Yeah, I mean, listen. I mean, Morejon and Miller have gone back-to-back days. Both got extended today. Morejon is still efficient, but 33 pitches. Miller in the 30s for two games combined. I would have an expectation that all hands are on deck tomorrow, but we're also going to take their temperature and be smart. We've got to value their careers as well. But we've also been -- we've only had two guys go three days in a row all year, and we've done it and saved it for these circumstances. Obviously in an elimination game, there's special circumstances.\"</p></blockquote><p>Miller threw 13 pitches in Game 1 on Tuesday and then 27 in Game 2. Only once this season has Miller worked three straight days, and that was back in May, before the Padres acquired him from the A's. Here's how he fared while pitching in every game of that three-game set against the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/teams/PHI/philadelphia-phillies/\">Phillies</a>: </p><ul><li>May 23: ⅔ IP, 3 R, 1 SO, 27 pitches</li><li>May 24: 1 IP, 1 R, 3 SO, 21 pitches</li><li>May 25: 1 IP, 0 R, 1 SO, 12 pitches</li></ul><p>At the time, he was coming off a combined 48 pitches before being called upon for the third leg of a back-to-back-to-back. In the here and now, he's coming off 40 pitches. Obviously, we shouldn't read too much into a one-off more than four months ago and compare it to the effort level and intensity of playoff baseball, but Shildt will be operating from precedent if he leans on Miller in Game 3. As for the \"value their careers\" part, Shildt is no doubt invoking ethical principles, and adding to it is the fact that the 27-year-old Miller is under team control through the 2029 season and thus a valuable part of the Padres' future. </p><p>For now, though, the focus is on the Padres' present and their designs on the first World Series title in franchise history, and that's why you may indeed see Miller make another crucial appearance on Thursday. If what he did in Game 2 is any guide, he'll miss bats and drop jaws once again.</p>\n            </div>"

The Cavaliers (4-1, 2-0 ACC) have scored more than 45 points in each contest during their current three-game winning streak and have produced 228 points this season, the second-highest total through five games in program history.</p><p>Louisville (4-0, 1-0) enters with a seven-game winning streak following its 34-27 triumph over <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/teams/PITT/pittsburgh-panthers/\">Pittsburgh</a> in its first ACC game of the year. The Cardinals, who trailed 17-0 after one quarter in that contest, are seeking their second 5-0 start in three years under head coach Jeff Brohm. </p><p>With its 24-20 win at Virginia last season, Louisville improved to 8-5 in the all-time series. The Cardinals have won each of the last three overall meetings and are 5-1 against the Cavaliers at home. SportsLine's Inside the Lines team's projection model sees Louisville's winning streak in the series continuing, as the team defeats Virginia in 74% of its simulations. Meanwhile, SportsLine senior analyst Josh Nagel (+484 on his last 19 college football against-the-spread picks) likes the Cardinals to cover the spread, believing this is the ultimate letdown spot for the Cavaliers.</p><h3><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/teams/SALA/south-alabama-jaguars/\">South Alabama</a> vs. <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/teams/TROY/troy-trojans/\">Troy</a></h3>\n<p>Troy (2-2) began the season with a victory against <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/teams/NICHST/nicholls-colonels/\">Nicholls</a> but lost its next two contests before rallying to defeat <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/teams/BUFF/buffalo-bulls/\">Buffalo</a> 21-17 last time out to even its record. The Trojans trailed 17-0 in the fourth quarter but scored three touchdowns in the final 10:23, including one on a 20-yard run by <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/players/28879155/tae-meadows/\">Tae Meadows</a> with 45 seconds remaining.</p><p>The Trojans will be playing their first Sun Belt game of the year when they host South Alabama (1-4, 0-1), which is in the midst of a four-game losing streak. The Jaguars' defense has been porous, allowing 31 or more points in each contest during the slide. Kentrell Bullock recorded his conference-high fifth rushing touchdown in South Alabama's 36-22 loss at <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/teams/NTEXAS/north-texas-mean-green/\">North Texas</a> last weekend, giving him at least one in four of the team's five games.</p><p>Troy is 9-4 all-time against South Alabama, which ended the Trojans' six-game winning streak in the series with a 25-9 triumph at home last season. Head coach Gerad Parker's squad has won three straight at home in \"The Battle for the Belt,\" and SportsLine's Matt Severance believes the streak will be extended as Troy is coming off a bye week to face a Jaguars team that has allowed an average of 31.8 points this season. Fellow expert Jeff Hochman likes the Trojans to cover the spread, believing their defense and desire for revenge will help get the job done.</p><h3><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/teams/UNLV/unlv-rebels/\">UNLV</a> vs. <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/teams/WYO/wyoming-cowboys/\">Wyoming</a></h3>\n<p>The Rebels and Cowboys begin Mountain West play when they meet at War Memorial Stadium in Laramie. UNLV, which has started 4-0 for the second consecutive season and is looking to win its first five games for the first time since 1974, is coming off a 41-38 triumph over <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/teams/MIAOH/miami-oh-redhawks/\">Miami (OH)</a> in its last contest two weeks ago.</p><p>Wyoming (2-2) kicked off the season with a pair of victories in which it allowed a total of seven points but yielded 68 in back-to-back losses to then-No. 20 <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/teams/UTAH/utah-utes/\">Utah</a> and <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/teams/COLO/colorado-buffaloes/\">Colorado</a>. The Cowboys, who can match last year's win total with a triumph, are the only FBS team that is scoring (16.8) and allowing (18.8) an average of fewer than 19 points this season.</p><p>UNLV cruised to a 34-14 victory in the last meeting between the teams after Wyoming won five of the previous six matchups. The Cowboys are 14-12 in the all-time series, but SportsLine experts Micah Roberts and Jake Fetner both feel that the Rebels will come away with the win Saturday. Roberts thinks UNLV's ground attack will lead the team to victory, while Fetner doesn't like the fact that Wyoming is 4-10 in its last 14 games against FBS opponents.</p><h2>Money line underdog parlay for Week 6</h2>\n<h3><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/teams/WKY/western-kentucky-hilltoppers/\">Western Kentucky</a> vs. <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/teams/DE/delaware-fightin-blue-hens/\">Delaware</a></h3>\n<p>Both teams are unbeaten in Conference USA play thus far, with Western Kentucky (4-1) edging <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/teams/MOST/missouri-state-bears/\">Missouri State</a> 27-22 last time out to improve to 2-0 and Delaware (3-1) routing Florida International 38-16 in its lone conference game. A transfer from <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/teams/AP/austin-peay-governors/\">Austin Peay</a>, running back <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/players/26701370/lavell-wright/\">La'Vell Wright</a> has rushed for a pair of touchdowns in each of his last two outings and already has matched the career high of five he set with the Governors last season.</p><p>Delaware was held to just seven points in its lone loss of the year but has scored at least 35 in each of its victories. Quarterback <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/players/29150401/nick-minicucci/\">Nick Minicucci</a> has thrown three touchdown passes in two of his four games this season, including the win against the Panthers, and leads the Blue Hens with four rushing scores.</p><p>The meeting between the clubs on Friday is the first since 1982 and third overall, with Delaware having won the first two by a combined score of 69-14. However, the Inside the Lines team's proven model sees Western Kentucky getting into the win column, as the Hilltoppers emerge victorious in 67% of its simulations.</p><h3><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/teams/COLOST/colorado-state-rams/\">Colorado State</a> vs. <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/teams/SDGST/san-diego-state-aztecs/\">San Diego State</a></h3>\n<p>With the exception of their 36-13 loss to <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/teams/WASHST/washington-state-cougars/\">Washington State</a>, the Aztecs (3-1) have been stellar defensively this season. San Diego State has given up a total of three points in its three victories, posting shutouts against both <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/teams/STONYBRK/stony-brook-seawolves/\">Stony Brook</a> and <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/teams/CAL/california-golden-bears/\">California</a>, and has scored 82 in those contests.</p><p>Colorado State (1-3), hasn't been as stout, but it has held opponents to 20 points or fewer in three of its four games. The Rams have struggled on the other side of the football, however, as their average of 15.3 points is the sixth-worst in FBS and second-lowest in the Mountain West.</p><p>Friday's matchup is the first conference game of the season for the Aztecs and Rams, both of whom are joining the Pac-12 next year. San Diego State has won seven of the last nine meetings between the schools, but the ITL team's model is leaning toward Colorado State posting its first road win in the series since a 63-31 rout in 2016, as the Rams win in 53% of simulations.</p><h3><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/teams/IOWAST/iowa-state-cyclones/\">Iowa State</a> vs. <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/teams/CINCY/cincinnati-bearcats/\">Cincinnati</a></h3>\n<p>No. 14 Iowa State (5-0, 2-0 Big 12) is looking to make school history when it visits Cincinnati for a conference clash on Saturday. The Cyclones are looking to win their first six games and first three during conference play in back-to-back seasons for the first time. Iowa State has won nine of its last 10 true road games dating back to the 2023 campaign.</p><p>Cincinnati (3-1, 1-0) is on a winning streak of its own as it has followed a season-opening loss to <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/teams/NEB/nebraska-cornhuskers/\">Nebraska</a> with triumph over <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/teams/BGREEN/bowling-green-falcons/\">Bowling Green</a>, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/teams/NWST/northwestern-state-demons/\">Northwestern State</a> and <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/teams/KANSAS/kansas-jayhawks/\">Kansas</a>. The Bearcats scored a total of 141 points in the victories, with quarterback <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/players/28899676/brendan-sorsby/\">Brendan Sorsby</a> accounting for 12 touchdowns (10 passing, two rushing) without committing a turnover during the run.</p><p>The Cyclones won both of the previous games in the all-time series, posting a 30-10 road victory in 2023 and a 34-17 triumph at home last year. The ITL team's model likes Iowa State to remain unbeaten against Cincinnati, as the Cyclones win in 71% of its simulations.</p>\n            </div>"

    "body": "<div>\n        <p>We're four weeks into the 2025 <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://cbssports.com/nfl/\">NFL</a> season, which means we're about a quarter of the way through. It's hard to believe, given that it feels like the season just started, but that's where we are right now.</p><p>And after four weeks, we've seen enough to -- mostly -- start declaring which teams are good and bad. There's obviously plenty of football left to play, but all 32 teams have also put quite a bit on tape already. And we know with some degree of conviction which teams are definitely good and bad. There's a squishy middle of the league that is more complicated to sort out, but we can at least make some educated guesses on which teams are probably good or bad.</p><p>That's what we're here to do today: We're sorting all 32 of the league's teams into five distinct tiers based on where they are right now and will likely go in the future. These include factors like their schedules, conditions of rosters and more.</p><h2>Tier 5: See you at the draft<br /></h2><ul><li><strong><em><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/CAR/carolina-panthers/\">Carolina Panthers</a>, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/CIN/cincinnati-bengals/\">Cincinnati Bengals</a>, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/CLE/cleveland-browns/\">Cleveland Browns</a>, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/NO/new-orleans-saints/\">New Orleans Saints</a>, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/NYJ/new-york-jets/\">New York Jets</a>, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/TEN/tennessee-titans/\">Tennessee Titans</a></em></strong></li></ul><p>These teams are going nowhere fast.</p><p>The Panthers have looked fairly embarrassing in three of their four games, and they somehow blew out the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/ATL/atlanta-falcons/\">Falcons</a> 30-0 in the other. We're betting that the three losses are more representative than the one win. The same goes for the Browns, who somehow had their defense steal a game against the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/GB/green-bay-packers/\">Packers</a> in Week 3 but have otherwise not looked good and are making a <span><a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/news/browns-to-start-dillon-gabriel-at-qb-bench-joe-flacco/\" target=\"_blank\">quarterback change</a></span>.</p>\n<p>The Saints, Jets and Titans are all 0-4, and they look varying degrees of terrible. The Jets have probably looked the \"best\" of the three teams, and they don't look good at all. They could have won that Week 1 game against the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/PIT/pittsburgh-steelers/\">Steelers</a> and almost stole Week 3 at the Bucs, but they've gone down big in three of their four games so far. The Saints have generally hung around and seemed run-of-the-mill bad rather than atrocious in their games, but they're just not a talented team. Tennessee is probably on the verge of firing its coach, and quarterback <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/3168422/cam-ward/\">Cam Ward</a> put it best <span><a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/news/cam-ward-sums-up-titans-play-through-four-games-we-ass/\" target=\"_blank\">when he said</a></span> of the Titans, \"We ass.\"</p><p>It might be aggressive to put the Bengals here, but they've lost two straight in pathetic fashion without <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/2179798/joe-burrow/\">Joe Burrow</a> and their next three games are against the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/DET/detroit-lions/\">Lions</a>, Packers and Steelers. They'll likely be 2-5 before we have a chance to blink.</p><h2>Tier 4: Probably bad<br /></h2><ul><li><strong><em><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/LV/las-vegas-raiders/\">Las Vegas Raiders</a>, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/MIA/miami-dolphins/\">Miami Dolphins</a>, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/NYG/new-york-giants/\">New York Giants</a></em></strong></li></ul><p>The Raiders have lost three in a row, including one game to a backup quarterback, and their offense just has not been able to get much going to date because <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/1700358/geno-smith/\">Geno Smith</a> can't stop throwing interceptions and <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/26693971/brock-bowers/\">Brock Bowers</a> doesn't look like himself. The defense also is not nearly good enough to carry the team, as it's probably still the weaker unit.</p>\n<p>Miami has looked vaguely competent in two of its four games but been able to defeat only the decrepit Jets, and the Dolphins just lost <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/2131163/tyreek-hill/\">Tyreek Hill</a> for the season. Undermanned on both offense and defense now, they're likely to slide even further back from the pack over the rest of the season. (They do have the good fortune of playing games against the Panthers, Browns, Saints and Jets again, though.)</p><p>The Giants pulled off Sunday's shocking upset of the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/LAC/los-angeles-chargers/\">Chargers</a> and <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/26694019/jaxson-dart/\">Jaxson Dart</a> acquitted himself fairly well in his first start, but this team that could do nothing offensively with <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/1272242/russell-wilson/\">Russell Wilson</a> under center just lost top playmaker <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/26697761/malik-nabers/\" target=\"_blank\">Malik Nabers</a> for the year to a torn ACL. Unless the defensive line totally dominates like it did in Week 4, it's probably still going to be a long season.</p><h2>Tier 3: Possibly frisky<br /></h2><ul><li><strong><em><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/ARI/arizona-cardinals/\">Arizona Cardinals</a>, Atlanta Falcons, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/BAL/baltimore-ravens/\">Baltimore Ravens</a>, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/CHI/chicago-bears/\">Chicago Bears</a>, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/DAL/dallas-cowboys/\">Dallas Cowboys</a>, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/DEN/denver-broncos/\">Denver Broncos</a>, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/HOU/houston-texans/\">Houston Texans</a>, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/IND/indianapolis-colts/\">Indianapolis Colts</a>, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/JAC/jacksonville-jaguars/\">Jacksonville Jaguars</a>, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/MIN/minnesota-vikings/\">Minnesota Vikings</a>, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/NE/new-england-patriots/\">New England Patriots</a>, Pittsburgh Steelers, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/WAS/washington-commanders/\">Washington Commanders</a></em></strong></li></ul><p>This is the largest group of teams, and that makes sense because we're still pretty early in the season and don't really know enough about anybody to draw that many definitive conclusions just yet. So we're lumping the entire middle class of the NFL into one tier, deemed possibly frisky, until we know more.</p>\n<p>Arizona beat two bad teams and lost to two good ones. The Falcons have shown a low floor without yet showing the type of ceiling that we want to see from a good team. The Ravens have a lot of talent, but their defense is decimated and now <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/2239671/lamar-jackson/\">Lamar Jackson</a> might miss time. The Bears seem to have rebounded from their rough start but did so against two weak defenses.</p><p>The Cowboys have shown that they can move the ball and put up points, but their defense is atrocious. The Broncos just stomped the Bengals, but their offense hasn't fully gotten untracked just yet. The Texans are here mostly because the AFC South isn't great and we know that they have a really good defense.</p><p>The Colts are off to a surprising start to the season but required a massive comeback for one of their wins and just lost to the first elite team they played. The Jags are 3-1 but lost to the Bengals, and there's no way that they can keep forcing turnovers at the rate they have to date. The Vikings have a ferocious defense, but we have yet to see the offense get fully untracked.</p>\n<p>The Patriots have had their only two wins against the dregs of the league, and have looked ordinary in their two losses, one of which saw them turn it over five times. Pittsburgh could easily be 1-3 instead of 3-1 if the ball had bounced differently in games against the Jets and Pats. And we don't yet know what Washington will look like when <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/3123337/jayden-daniels/\">Jayden Daniels</a> comes back.</p><p>All of these teams have their strengths, obviously. But again, we probably don't know enough about them to make a determination on whether they are probably bad or good. So we're sticking them here and punting on that determination a while longer.</p><h2>Tier 2: Probably good<br /></h2><ul><li><strong><em><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/KC/kansas-city-chiefs/\">Kansas City Chiefs</a>, Los Angeles Chargers, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/SF/san-francisco-49ers/\">San Francisco 49ers</a>, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/SEA/seattle-seahawks/\">Seattle Seahawks</a>, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/TB/tampa-bay-buccaneers/\">Tampa Bay Buccaneers</a></em></strong></li></ul><p>These are teams that we know are talented and have gotten off to varying degrees of good starts (they're all 3-1 except for the Chiefs) but also know have real flaws on one side of the ball or another, for one reason or another.</p>\n<p>The Chiefs finally looked like themselves offensively against the Ravens, but that defense has been torn to shreds by every opponent. We need to see that type of performance more consistently, and the same goes for the defense. The Chargers just lost to the Giants and now must play without both of their starting tackles for a while, but the defense is still terrific (two of New York's scoring drives started deep in L.A. territory) and <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/2221960/justin-herbert/\">Justin Herbert</a> was playing at an extremely high level.</p><p>The 49ers are dealing with injuries pretty much everywhere on both offense and defense. <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/2961306/brock-purdy/\">Brock Purdy</a>, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/3122949/ricky-pearsall/\">Ricky Pearsall</a>, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/2180514/jauan-jennings/\">Jauan Jennings</a>, <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/2260972/nick-bosa/\" target=\"_blank\">Nick Bosa</a> -- basically everyone<em> except</em> <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/2136743/christian-mccaffrey/\">Christian McCaffrey</a> is ailing at the moment. The Seahawks have one of the NFL's best defenses, if not the single best, and that will keep them competitive in just about every game. We have to see what the offense looks like when it gets into trailing mode to have more confidence that the 49ers can contend.</p><p>The Bucs are also 3-1 and dealing with a ton of injuries. <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/1824909/mike-evans/\">Mike Evans</a> and the entire right side of the offensive line are out. <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/3162347/jalen-mcmillan/\">Jalen McMillan</a> won't be back until after the bye. The run game has not looked the same as it did last year and <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/26693770/bucky-irving/\">Bucky Irving</a> is now dealing with an injury. We almost have to be in wait-and-see mode here.</p>\n<h2>Tier 1: Inner circle (for now)<br /></h2><ul><li><strong><em><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/BUF/buffalo-bills/\">Buffalo Bills</a>, Detroit Lions, <strong><em>Green Bay Packers, </em></strong><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/LAR/los-angeles-rams/\">Los Angeles Rams</a>, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/PHI/philadelphia-eagles/\">Philadelphia Eagles</a></em></strong></li></ul><p>The Eagles and Bills are 4-0. They were inner-circle contenders last year and just keep winning. There have been some fits and starts for Philadelphia's offense, but we know how talented a team that is, and we've seen that the Eagles can win games despite not playing at their best. Buffalo has given us no reason to doubt that it is one of the league's best teams, with a rollicking comeback over the Ravens in Week 1 and double-digit wins over dregs in the other three games.</p><p>Separating the Lions, Packers and Rams from the rest of the teams near the top is a bit more difficult, but mostly comes down to ceiling. The Lions have shown that their offense is still a machine, even if that machine got taken offline for a while in Week 1 against Green Bay. The Packers have shown that their defense, which did just get torched by <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/1824864/dak-prescott/\">Dak Prescott</a>, has the ability to be such a monster that it is almost impossible to move the ball. And the Rams have shown that they can compete with anyone on both sides of the ball. Their only loss came on a blocked kick in Philadelphia, in a game they mostly controlled.</p>\n            </div>"

Nashville SC began playing in 2020 and were able to lift a trophy in their second club final in their history after losing the 2023 Leagues Cup final to Inter Miami. It was none other than star striker Sam Surridge who put Nashville ahead for good from the penalty spot with his sixth goal in the competition and his 28th in all competitions.</p><p>Austin had their chances with forward Myrto Uzuni missing a penalty in the first half, but manager B.J. Callaghan's side were able to bunker and get the win in a hostile environment. It's a major moment not only for Nashville but also for the state of Tennessee, as this Open Cup title is the first professional sports trophy in the history of the state. For a team that has been among the best in the league since starting play in MLS, it's a well-deserved title.</p><p>Callaghan is experienced in being on coaching staffs for these moments, as he was an assistant with the Philadelphia Union for three Open Cup finals that the team lost, and it was something that helped prepare them for this moment. He also helped lead the U.S. men's national team to a Concacaf Nations League title in 2023 as an interim manager, so he's no stranger to the big stage. </p><p>Hany Mukhtar opened the scoring for Nashville before Austin equalized in the first half, shifting the momentum in a wild affair. With two players being tangled in the box, a penalty was called in the second half and Nashville wouldn't look back from there.</p>\n<p>Even with Surridge being sent off in stoppage time due to getting a second yellow card for time wasting, Austin didn't have enough time to come back in the match. At times, cup finals can be cagy affairs that are low scoring, but with both of these teams chasing their first trophy in club history, it was an open match. For Austin to get to this point without Brandon Vazquez, who suffered a season-ending injury in July, is an impressive feat, and they'll be back on this stage. Next up, both of these teams have booked their places in the MLS Cup playoff, so there is a chance that they could meet again in MLS Cup.</p>\n            </div>\n    </div>"

And it's time to recognize that, for now, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/3163962/ladd-mcconkey/fantasy/\">Ladd McConkey</a> is third behind Johnston and <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/1737096/keenan-allen/fantasy/\">Keenan Allen</a>.</p><p>Now, that doesn't mean you have to bench McConkey. I'm still starting him in three-receiver leagues, but he's struggled to start the season with no touchdowns and 9.8 PPR points or less in three games in a row, including a Week 4 stinker at the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/NYG/new-york-giants/\">Giants</a> with one catch for 11 yards on six targets.</p><p>Things will turn around, and hopefully that happens against the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/WAS/washington-commanders/\">Commanders</a>, who are No. 9 in most Fantasy points allowed to opposing receivers. With four teams on a bye (Atlanta, Chicago, Green Bay, and Pittsburgh), it's tough to bench McConkey, especially with several key injuries at receiver, notably to <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/26697761/malik-nabers/fantasy/\">Malik Nabers</a> (knee) and <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/2131163/tyreek-hill/fantasy/\">Tyreek Hill</a> (knee), who are both out for the season.</p><p>McConkey is downgraded slightly in my rankings in Week 5, while Johnston and Allen are elevated. For Johnston, he's been awesome in the first four games of the season, with at least 14.9 PPR points in each outing, including four touchdowns. He has at least seven targets in each game, and <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/2221960/justin-herbert/fantasy/\">Justin Herbert</a> is relying on him like an alpha receiver. It's been fun to watch.</p>\n<p>Allen had a down game against the Giants in Week 4 with just 8.7 PPR points, but he scored at least 17.1 PPR points in each of the first three games of the year. I expect him to get back on track against Washington, and Allen should be considered a No. 2 Fantasy receiver in all leagues.</p><p>The Chargers have arguably the best receiving corps in the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://cbssports.com/nfl/\">NFL</a> right now, but we thought McConkey would be leading the way. He can still help Fantasy managers this season, but Johnston and Allen are ahead of him in production -- and in the rankings for Week 5.</p>\n<p>That said, I would start all three of the Chargers in Week 5 given the matchup. Now, let's check out the other start and sit receivers for Week 5.</p>\n<div><div><div><p>WRs to Start</p></div><div><p>\n                        Projections powered by\n                        <a

in Miami now with Tyreek Hill (knee) out for the season, and that should lead to more volume from Tua Tagovailoa. Hill was averaging 7.7 targets per game prior to Week 4 -- Waddle averages 5.8 targets per game -- and Waddle has thrived in his career with at least eight targets. Waddle has 26 games in his career with at least eight targets, and he averaged 18.9 PPR points over that span. I hope that's what we get from Waddle on a weekly basis, and I'll start him as a No. 2 Fantasy receiver in all leagues in Week 5 at Carolina. The Panthers are No. 2 in fewest Fantasy points allowed to opposing receivers, but Waddle should start to post quality stats from this point forward as the new top receiver for the Dolphins.\n

points, but he had seven targets against the Bears in a game where Geno Smith attempted just 21 passes. Meyers remains a go-to option for Smith, and he should start playing at a high level again, including in Week 5 against the Colts. Indianapolis is No. 3 in most Fantasy points allowed to opposing receivers, and four receivers in the past three games scored at least 13.8 PPR points. I like Meyers as a No. 2 Fantasy receiver in all leagues.\n            </p>\n            </div>\n</div>\n</td></tr><tr><td><div>\n    <div>\n                    <div>\n    <figure><img alt=\"team

McMillan to have a breakout game, and he's definitely getting plenty of chances with at least eight targets in each outing. He's yet to score a touchdown, and he only has one game with more than five catches or 68 yards. This week, McMillan could go off against the Dolphins, who have allowed three receivers to score at least 14.5 PPR points this season. Michael Pittman and Garrett Wilson each got eight targets against Miami, and both scored at least 20 PPR points. Let's hope McMillan gets at least eight targets again in Week 5.\n            </p>\n            </div>\n</div>\n</td></tr><tr><td><div>\n    <div>\n                    <div>\n    <figure><img

immediate impact in his return to action from the shoulder injury that sidelined him for two weeks in Week 4 against Baltimore, with five catches for 83 yards on eight targets and two carries for 38 yards. He should be considered a solid No. 2 Fantasy receiver in all leagues in Week 5 at Jacksonville. The Jaguars have allowed three receivers to score at least 14.6 PPR points this season, and Patrick Mahomes should continue to lean on Worthy in this matchup. It's fun to have Worthy back on the field and making plays again.\n            </p>\n            </div>\n</div>\n</td></tr><tr><td><div>\n    <div>\n                    <div>\n    <figure><img

his best game of the season in Week 4 against Seattle with six catches for 66 yards and a touchdown on 10 targets. We hope he continues to get that much volume, and Harrison is capable of big outings on a weekly basis. That should happen again in Week 5 against the Titans, who are No. 6 in most Fantasy points allowed to opposing receivers. Four receivers have scored at least 18.1 PPR points against Tennessee this season, and I like Harrison as a solid No. 2 Fantasy receiver in this matchup.\n            </p>\n

his better outings of the season in Week 4 at San Francisco, but he's still only worth starting in three-receiver leagues in Week 5 against the Chiefs. Against the 49ers, Thomas had a season-high five catches, but he only managed 49 yards on seven targets. He's yet to catch a touchdown, and 10.6 PPR points is his season high. Kansas City hasn't allowed a receiver to catch a touchdown since Week 1, including matchups with Philadelphia, the Giants, when Malik Nabers was healthy, and Baltimore. I don't have high hopes for Thomas in this matchup.\n            </p>\n            </div>\n</div>\n</td></tr><tr><td><div>\n    <div>\n                    <div>\n    <figure><img alt=\"team logo\"

from his three-game suspension in Week 4 against Pittsburgh in Ireland with a splash. He had four catches for 114 yards on eight targets, but he had 81 yards on one reception late in the fourth quarter as a result of busted coverage. It felt a little fluky, and Addison could struggle in Week 5 against the Browns in London. Cleveland's defense will make things tough on Carson Wentz this week, and Addison is only worth starting in three-receiver leagues.\n            </p>\n

how the Browns perform with new quarterback Dillon Gabriel. Hopefully, it won't be any worse for Jeudy, who has been terrible so far this season with 11.6 PPR points or less in all four games. He has yet to score a touchdown, and Jeudy has combined for just four catches for 65 yards on 14 targets in his past two outings against Green Bay and Detroit. The Vikings are No. 1 in fewest Fantasy points allowed to opposing receivers, and Jeudy should only be started in three-receiver leagues in Week 5.\n            </p>\n

Since then, he's combined for nine catches for 91 yards and no touchdowns on 11 targets. It's hard to trust Coleman in the majority of leagues. The Patriots secondary should be tough now that cornerback Christian Gonzalez is healthy. In two games against New England last year, Coleman combined for three catches for 48 yards and no touchdowns, and he's only worth starting in deep, three-receiver leagues in Week 5.\n

following Week 4 against Tampa Bay when he caught two passes for 7 yards, but he had nine targets. He can't say the Eagles didn't try to get him the ball, and he has 19 targets in his past two games against the Rams and Buccaneers. For the season, Brown only has one game with more than 7.7 PPR points, and it's hard to expect a standout performance in Week 5 against the Broncos, where he will likely see a lot of Denver cornerback Patrick Surtain II. I'm still starting Brown in three-receiver leagues, but this is a terrible matchup for him against this defense.\n            </p>\n            </div>\n</div></div>\n            </div>\n

There might be a lot of replacement options in lineups this week.</p><p>In Arizona, Trey Benson (knee) was placed on injured reserve, which means either Michael Carter or Emari Demercado could be the lead running back for the Cardinals against the Titans. As you'll read below, I'd lean toward Carter as the Arizona running back to target in Week 5.</p><p>In Tampa Bay, Bucky Irving (foot) was in a walking boot at practice, and he could miss Week 5 at Seattle. Rachaad White and Sean Tucker would fill in for the Buccaneers if Irving is out, and I like White with his role in the passing game against the Seahawks.</p><p>In Carolina, Dave Canales said Chuba Hubbard (calf) is day-to-day, and he could be out in Week 5 against Miami. If Hubbard is out then Rico Dowdle would be a No. 2 Fantasy running back in all leagues.</p>\n<p>We'll continue to monitor all the running back news leading up to Sunday. But, based on what we know now, here are the running backs to start and sit for Week 5.</p>\n<div><div><div><p>RBs to Start</p></div><div><p>\n                        Projections powered by\n

impressive in the past two games against Green Bay and Detroit, scoring at least 16.5 PPR points in each outing. We'll see what the Cleveland offense looks like with Dillon Gabriel making his first NFL start against Minnesota in London, but I'm trusting Judkins against the Vikings. Kenneth Gainwell just scored 31.4 PPR points against Minnesota in Week 4, and Judkins should be the catalyst of the Browns offense in this matchup. He's a borderline No. 1 Fantasy running back in Week 5.\n            </p>\n            </div>\n</div>\n</td></tr><tr><td><div>\n    <div>\n                    <div>\n    <figure><img alt=\"team logo\" src=\"https://sports.cbsimg.net/fly/images/team-logos/422.svg\" /></figure>\n                                        </div>\n        <div>\n            <p><span>     \n                        NYG\n                    </span>\n                    <span>     \n                        N.Y.

along with Jaxson Dart making his first NFL start, Skattebo got 27 total touches, including two catches. He only managed 90 total yards, but he's going to get fed against the Saints. Every running back against New Orleans this season -- James Conner, Christian McCaffrey, Kenneth Walker III and James Cook -- has scored at least 14.4 PPR points, and Skattebo should follow suit.

<p>\n                I don't love that Etienne only has one catch for 1 yard on four targets in the past two games against Houston and San Francisco. I do love that he's gotten at least 17 total opportunities (carries and targets) in every game this season, and he scored a touchdown in three games in a row. He also has three games this year with at least 16.9 PPR points, and the Chiefs have allowed a running back to score at least 17.4 PPR points in three games in a row with Saquon Barkley, Cam Skattebo and Justice Hill. Etienne is worth trusting as a No. 2 running back in all leagues in this matchup at home.\n            </p>\n            </div>\n</div>\n</td></tr><tr><td><div>\n    <div>\n                    <div>\n

<p>\n                I expected Montgomery to struggle in Week 4 against Cleveland, and he finished with nine carries for 12 yards and no catches on one target. But he should rebound in Week 5 against the Bengals, who are No. 2 in most Fantasy points allowed to opposing running backs. Five running backs have already scored at least 15.4 PPR points against Cincinnati, and the Bengals have allowed six total touchdowns to running backs in four games. Montgomery should be considered a solid No. 2 running back in all leagues, and Jahmyr Gibbs has top-three upside in this matchup.\n            </p>\n

27.9 PPR points against Tennessee. He had 17 carries for 69 yards and a touchdown and four catches for 50 yards and a touchdown on five targets, and he should have the chance for another dominant campaign against Baltimore. The Ravens are No. 1 in most Fantasy points allowed to running backs, and seven guys have scored at least 10.1 PPR points against Baltimore, with three running backs scoring at least 21.2 PPR points. Nick Chubb remains a factor in Houston's backfield and can be considered a sleeper this week, but Marks has top-20 upside in all leagues.\n            </p>\n

game where Henderson excels because the Patriots will likely be chasing points, and he should be a weapon out of the backfield. Maybe that happens, but New England continues to rotate Henderson, Rhamondre Stevenson and Antonio Gibson, and Henderson is tough to trust. He had his best Fantasy outing in Week 4 against Carolina with 12.6 PPR points, but he only had nine total touches. The Bills have allowed a running back to score in each of the past two games with Ollie Gordon II in Week 3 and Kendre Miller in Week 4, but Henderson is a flex option at best while he's sharing touches with Stevenson and Gibson.\n            </p>\n            </div>\n</div>\n</td></tr><tr><td><div>\n    <div>\n                    <div>\n    <figure><img alt=\"team logo\"

against the Bengals with a career-high 19.8 PPR points, and he had 14 carries for 58 yards, along with four catches for 40 yards and a touchdown on five targets. But Cincinnati's defense is a great matchup, and the Eagles are a much tougher test in Week 5. Philadelphia hasn't allowed a rushing touchdown since Week 1, and Harvey will still lose touches to J.K. Dobbins. Prior to Week 4, Harvey had seven total touches or less in three games in a row, and I expect Sean Payton to lean on Dobbins in this matchup. Harvey is a desperation flex at best in Week 5 on the road.\n            </p>\n            </div>\n</div>\n</td></tr><tr><td><div>\n    <div>\n                    <div>\n    <figure><img alt=\"team

first touchdown of the season in Week 4 against Baltimore on a reception, but he finished with nine total touches. He continues to share playing time with Kareem Hunt and Breshard Smith, and ESPN reported Wednesday that Smith could continue to get more work moving forward. The Jaguars also have been tough to run on, and Jacksonville is one of the three teams along with Seattle and the Rams that have yet to allow a rushing touchdown. Pacheco is a flex option at best in the majority of leagues in Week 5.\n            </p>\n            </div>\n</div>\n</td></tr><tr><td><div>\n    <div>\n                    <div>\n    <figure><img

in Week 4 at Denver with 10.1 PPR points than he was in the previous two outings against Jacksonville and Minnesota when he combined for 14.5 PPR points. He's been limited to 14 total touches or less in each of his past two games, and it's hard to expect a hefty workload in a game where the Bengals will likely be playing from behind. Detroit has allowed four touchdowns to running backs, but the Lions are still No. 8 in fewest Fantasy points allowed to the position. Brown will likely struggle if he doesn't find the end zone, and he hasn't scored a touchdown since Week 1. Brown is just a flex option at best in Week 5.\n            </p>\n            </div>\n</div>\n</td></tr></tbody></table></div></div><div><div><div><p>Bust Alert (Start/Sit)</p></div><div><p>\n

Steelers in Week 4 with 16 carries for 57 yards and three catches for 15 yards on three targets. I expect him to be held in check again in Week 5 against the Browns. Cleveland is No. 2 in fewest Fantasy points allowed to opposing running backs, and Jahmyr Gibbs in Week 4 is the lone player to gain more than 43 yards on the ground against the Browns. Otherwise, Cleveland has held Chase Brown, Derrick Henry, Josh Jacobs and David Montgomery to a combined 57 carries for 108 yards on the season. I like that Mason had three catches against the Steelers, but you're not relying on him for his role in the passing game. I would only use Mason as a flex option at best in the majority of leagues in Week 5.\n            </p>\n            </div>\n</div></div>\n            </div>\n    </div>\n</article>\n

    "body": "<div>\n        <p>Almost a year ago, Bayern Munich's <span>Harry Kane</span> scored a goal that wouldn't impact the result in a 4-1 loss to <span>Barcelona</span>, but it did make an impact on Wednesday. <span>Paris</span> Saint-Germain striker Goncalo Ramos was watching that goal, and he says it helped him beat Barcelona's high line for PSG to win 2-1 on Wednesday in UCL play. Coming off the bench for the visitors, Ramos delivered the goal, and it shows the attention to detail that PSG have when preparing for games, as he was quite aware of how Kane took apart Barcelona.</p><p>When <span>Bayern Munich</span> faced Barcelona, Kane had multiple chances to beat their high line. The first time that he put the ball in the back of the net, he was judged to be offside, but the next time that he had a chance (which can be <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/watch/general/video/barcelona-vs-fc-bayern-munchen-condensed-game-2\" target=\"_blank\">seen here at 7:44</a>), he stayed forward, and <span>Serge Gnabry</span> was able to bend the ball back for Kane to deliver a devastating finish.</p><figure><p><img alt=\"screenshot-2025-10-01-at-7-48-13-pm.png\" src=\"https://sportshub.cbsistatic.com/i/r/2025/10/01/6dc80125-11c0-4870-8ea0-f05c475e5cb4/resize/670x377/dcb1b531088481cdfbb8e3d8f406f644/screenshot-2025-10-01-at-7-48-13-pm.png\" /></p><figcaption><span>\n                                                                    CBS Sports\n                                                            </span></figcaption></figure><p>CBS Sports studio analyst <span>Thierry Henry</span> took notice of Kane's lack of regard for the Barcelona defenders, and it's something that has been a trend facing off against Hansi Flick's Barcelona.</p><p>\"This man realized that in the first half, Barcelona are always pushing too much, so there is no need for you to come [back]. Just make sure you stay in an offside position,\" Henry said, describing Kane's goal. \"Why? Because if they switch the ball and they switch the ball again, you're never going to be offside because you're going to be behind the ball. He's never going to try to come back in an onside position because he knows he'll be behind the ball.\"</p>\n<p>That goal is almost a carbon copy of <span>Achraf Hakimi's</span> assist to Ramos. Ramos was in an offside position, and Hakimi bent an excellent ball into his path that Barcelona keeper Wojciech Szczesny couldn't save for the eventual win. </p><p>Take a look at the goal:</p>\n<p>\"I think a lot about beating a high line. For me, personally, it's my favorite place. I just went there, and we have very fast players coming from behind, and even against Barcelona, they have a video of Harry Kane, I think two years ago, and he did something like I did on the goal, and he scored,\" Ramos said.</p>\n<p>After redefining how teams kick off by kicking it out to start the press, PSG's attention to detail shows again, but this is also why Barcelona can't win the Champions League unless they change what they do defensively and recognize the space they are leaving out wide. Flick's style works in La Liga and against most teams in the world, but when pitted against the very best in the world, they need answers. The fact that Ramos was able to look at a goal scored a year ago and execute the same thing because Barcelona's defense hasn't changed is an issue. Without adjustments, it won't matter how strong the Barcelona attack is, the offside trap will continue to be their Achilles heel.</p>\n            </div>"

    "body": "<div>\n        <p>In a span of less than four years, Alex Pereira has authored one of the most unique and impressive UFC runs in the 32-year history of the promotion after he transitioned to MMA following a Hall-of-Fame career as a two-division GLORY kickboxing champion. </p><p>While many of his predecessors struggled with the time it takes to adapt to a new sport or the painstaking hours necessary to evolve one's skillset to elite level, Pereira has made it seem like nothing is impossible and all of the limitations that apply to others have nothing at all to do with him. </p><p>The Brazilian slugger is 9-2 in the Octagon with seven victories via knockout. Pereira has won titles in two divisions, has fought in title bouts for nine of his 11 UFC appearances and holds a promotional record with three title defenses in just a 175-day span in 2024, which saw him claim fighter of the year. </p><p>Despite that meteoric run to global stardom, however, for the fighter who, only seven months ago was considered the face of the UFC despite not speaking English, Pereira (12-3) was noticeably humbled by a lackluster performance in March at UFC 313 (in a particularly lackluster headlining bout) when \"Poatan\" <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mma/news/ufc-313-results-highlights-magomed-ankalaev-upsets-alex-pereira-to-claim-light-heavyweight-title/live/\" target=\"_blank\">lost his light heavyweight title via unanimous decision</a> to Magomed Ankalaev (20-1-1, 1 NC).</p>\n<p>While Pereira deserved credit for bucking the pre-fight narrative that Ankalaev, a native of Dagestan, Russia, was going to dominantly wrestle him for five rounds by stuffing all 12 takedown attempts, he was outgunned on the feet by his more technical foe in a performance that took a good deal of air out of his legendary balloon. </p><p>As the top two 205-pound fighters in the world prepare for an immediate rematch on Saturday, in the main event of a <span><a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mma/news/ufc-320-magomed-ankalaev-vs-alex-pereira-2-fight-card-date-odds-rumors-location-complete-guide/\" target=\"_blank\">UFC 320 pay-per-view card</a></span> from T-Mobile Arena in Las Vegas, the question suddenly becomes whether Pereira can right the wrong of his first defeat at light heavyweight by taking back his title or whether the 38-year-old has truly begun his descent from his prior pound-for-pound elite status.</p><p>One of the interesting fight-week narratives to evolve happened when Pereira admitted to CBS Sports that <span><a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mma/news/alex-pereira-reveals-he-was-at-just-40-in-title-loss-to-magomed-anakalev-surprised-i-was-able-to-fight/\" target=\"_blank\">he was only 40% of his normal self</a></span> in the first Ankalaev fight. It's a narrative that makes sense considering Pereira's history of accepting fights on short notice and fighting hurt, which is a gamble that eventually catch up with anyone.</p>\n<a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mma/news/ufc-320-fight-card-jiri-prochazka-vs-khalil-rountree-jr-among-best-undercard-fights-to-watch/\" target=\"_blank\">\n        <div>\n            <div>\n                <p>UFC 320 fight card: Jiri Prochazka vs. Khalil Rountree Jr. among best undercard fights to watch</p>\n                <p>\n                    Shakiel Mahjouri                </p>\n            </div>\n                            <div>\n    <figure><img alt=\"UFC 320 fight card: Jiri Prochazka vs. Khalil Rountree Jr. among best undercard fights to watch\" src=\"https://sportshub.cbsistatic.com/i/r/2025/09/26/9c2e6920-8bc1-49f7-926d-517ab877bc12/thumbnail/270x152/be7cd786c9a2824940c44c89c3ad3862/jiri-prochazka-ufc-mma.jpg\" /></figure>\n                </div>\n                    </div>\n    </a>\n<p>The proud Pereria wouldn't go as far as confirming the report after UFC 313 that he battled both norovirus and a broken hand entering the first Ankalaev fight, but it's an excuse that loses some fuel when one finds out that Ankalaev, a devout Muslim, also went through training camp fully compromised while observing Ramadan. </p><p>\"[Dealing with the loss] is not cool but, then again, if I put together everything that was going on with me -- and I'm not going to say it right now -- it made me happy I was even able to fight,\" Pereira said. \"I'm not going to talk about anything like that. Of course, I'm not happy that I lost but knowing my potential and the way that I fought, I'm actually even surprised I was able to fight.\"</p><p>It's also possible that Pereira's star turn caught up with him, as well, considering the amount of UFC promotional travel he undertook during training camp alone ahead of the first fight, which was something noted by Pereira's lead trainer, former 205-pound champion Glover Teixeira, during the fliming of \"UFC Countdown\" when the Brazilian legend noted just how much they devoted this camp to cardio and keeping Pereira in one place at their Connecticut gym. </p>\n<p>If one is looking even further for evidence as to just how serious Pereira is taking his pursuit of recapturing his title, the normally mild-mannered and stoic fighter (who is known for his catchphrase \"Chama\") looked visibly irriated during multiple run-ins with Ankalaev at the UFC Performance Institute in Las Vegas last week. Pereira accused Ankalaev of hiding from him, to which the new champion called him a liar as their multiple interactions were caught on camera.</p><p>\"For me, it makes no difference [having beef with an opponent],\" Pereira said. \"I'm always cool, I'm normal. [Ankalaev] is the one that seemed nervous and scared. He is the one that seemed to be affected more by it.\"</p><p>Another topic of contention between the fighters has surrounded Ankalaev's inability to take Pereira down in the first meeting. Ankalaev claims that was due to him not having the energy to do so after training during Ramadan (not to mention his accusation that Pereira was extra \"greasy\" during the fight) while Pereira came up with a different theory. </p>\n<p>\"For me, [the grease accusations] are no problem. I'm cool,\" Pereira said. \"I think [Ankalaev] doesn't like it because I was able to prove that he's not that good. I'm a striker and he's a grappler. He's supposed to be taking me down but I was showing that he's not that great.\"</p><p>Entering the rematch there remains some speculation as to whether Pereira can continue to make 205 pounds, which could mean Saturday ends up being his final bout at light heavyweight regardless of whether he wins or loses. That theory matches up with Pereira's previously stated goals of one day moving up to heavyweight in an attempt to become the first UFC fighter to claim titles in three different divisions. </p>\n<p>Pereira, however, wouldn't quite confirm that a move above 205 pounds was imminent. </p>\n<p>\"When I joined the UFC in the middleweight division, my focus was to be a champion,\" Pereira said. \"Then, my body [changed] and I realized that I had to go up. When I went to light heavyweight, my focus was to be a champion. If my body tells me that I have to go up to heavyweight or to fight a heavyweight, my focus is also to be a champion.\" </p><p>With Pereira vowing the rematch against Ankalaev will be different, one has to wonder whether that means he takes the lead in terms of striking after spending most of the first fight on his backfoot fighting off the steady pressure of Ankalaev. </p><p>Either way, it's clear just how much Pereira is aware of the importance in winning this rematch to his overall resume as one of the shortest (he didn't make his Octagon debut until age 34) and successful runs that any UFC fighter has ever authored.</p>\n<p>\"For sure, it's going to be great for my story and for everything that I have built,\" Pereira said. \"I have had this fast career in the UFC and I have been able to achieve a lot, like the [2022 middleweight title knockout] of [Israel] Adesanya. Against him I won the belt and then I lost the belt. Then [I moved up] and I won the [light heavyweight] belt so winning the belt again is going to be great for my story.</p><p>\"Sometimes yes, [I'm able to think about everything I've accomplished] and sometimes no. I know that I accomplished something that is really hard for other people to achieve. Some people don't. It's kind of hard to understand sometimes.\"</p>\n            </div>"

The Bills look to move to 5-0 on the season and, if they do, can grab a three-game lead within the division. Buffalo is a 7.5-point favorite over the Patriots (2-2). In other games involving AFC East foes, the Dolphins (1-3) are 1.5-point favorites against the Panthers (1-3) at Carolina, while the Jets (0-4) are 2.5-point underdogs against the visiting Cowboys (1-2-1) in the latest Week 5 NFL odds. The week kicks off with 49ers vs. Rams (-7) on 'Thursday Night Football' as Brock Purdy (toe) is among the key players out for the Niners. </p><p>How should you handle those NFL games and optimize what to bet on NFL in Week 5?
