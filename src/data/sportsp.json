He'll take on struggling Cubs lefty Shota Imanaga with first pitch scheduled for 7:40 p.m. ET at Wrigley Field. Since the start of August, Lindor has a .934 OPS with 23 extra-base hits (nine homers and 14 doubles), so SportsLine's Inside the Lines team is riding the hot hand on Thursday with Lindor as one of their top MLB home runs picks.</p><p>The latest MLB HR odds list Lindor as high as +420 tonight and that's a price too good to pass up.

Hancock has a 2.08 ERA as a reliever but a 5.47 ERA as a starter. Despite playing in Coors, Hunter Goodman actually has a higher home run rate on the road than at home this season.

They're looking to stack another win and keep within striking distance of the Niners in the West.</p><p>Which of these teams will improve its record to 3-1? We'll find out soon enough. But before we break down the matchup, here's a look at how you can watch the game.</p>\n<h2>Where to watch Seahawks vs. Cardinals live</h2><ul><li><strong>Date: </strong>Thursday, Sept. 15 | <strong>Time:</strong> 8:20 p.m. ET</li><li><strong>Location:</strong> State Farm Stadium (Glendale, AZ)</li><li><strong>Stream:</strong> <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/gp/video/sports\" target=\"_blank\">Amazon Prime</a></li><li><strong>Follow: </strong><a href=\"https://apps.apple.com/us/app/cbs-sports-app-scores-news/id307184892\" target=\"_blank\">CBS Sports App</a></li><li><strong>Odds:</strong> Seahawks -1.5; O/U 43.5 (via <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/betting/news/draftkings-promo-code/\" target=\"_blank\">DraftKings Sportsbook</a>)</li></ul><p><em>Bet <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://cbssports.com/nfl/\">NFL</a> Week 4 games and <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/odds/\" target=\"_blank\">NFL odds</a> at <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/betting/news/draftkings-promo-code/\">DraftKings</a>, where new users get $300 in bonus bets and over $200 off <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://cbssports.com/nfl/\">NFL</a> Sunday Ticket.</em></p><h2>When the Seahawks have the ball</h2><p>Arizona comes into this game incredibly short-handed on defense. <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/28923687/walter-nolen/\">Walter Nolen</a> and <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/3163276/bj-ojulari/\">BJ Ojulari</a> remain on the physically unable to perform list. <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/3126891/garrett-williams/\">Garrett Williams</a> went on injured reserve. <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/517294/will-johnson/\">Will Johnson</a> is doubtful to play for the second consecutive game. It's basically a M.A.S.H. unit on this side of the ball.</p><p>The injuries in the secondary, and especially to slot corner Williams, are a problem in this matchup. <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/3162959/jaxon-smith-njigba/\">Jaxon Smith-Njigba</a> is playing as well as any wide receiver in the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://cbssports.com/nfl/\">NFL</a>, and he operates quite often out of the slot. (He has, in fairness, aligned outside more often this year because the Seahawks have leaned into some 12 personnel looks.) He already has 22 catches for 323 yards through three weeks, ranking second behind only <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/3121687/puka-nacua/\">Puka Nacua</a> in both categories. He's seeing targets on an incredible 42% of his routes, via Tru Media, the second-highest rate in the league, behind only Nacua. </p>\n<p><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/2180320/sam-darnold/\">Sam Darnold</a> is completing over 70% of his passes at an average of 9.0 yards per attempt, and he's doing it by just repeatedly and relentlessly targeting JSN all over the field. Presumably, without two of their top three corners, the Cardinals will likely have a difficult time keeping that connection from, well, connecting. </p><p>The Seahawks haven't had much success running the ball yet, however, averaging just 3.3 yards per carry as <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/2820052/kenneth-walker/\">Kenneth Walker</a> and <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/3123810/zach-charbonnet/\">Zach Charbonnet</a> have each been very inefficient. The offensive line issues we expected Seattle to have coming into the year appear to have affected the run game more than the passing attack so far.</p><p>Charbonnet, who missed last week due to injury before practicing this week and carrying a questionable designation into the game, has just 57 yards on his 27 carries. Walker has been more efficient thanks to a few long runs in Week 2, but he was running in mud last week against the Saints (38 yards on 16 carries) and in Week 1 against the 49ers (10 carries for 20 yards). </p>\n<p>Arizona has been excellent against the run so far, having held its last two opponents below 75 rushing yards and allowing only 3.8 yards per carry on the year. The Cardinals have yielded just 0.80 yards before contact per attempt, which ranks eighth in the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://cbssports.com/nfl/\">NFL</a> to date. If the Cards can slow down the run game and force the Seahawks into pure dropback situations, maybe they can get some pressure on Darnold and force him into some mistakes. The defensive front is playing well despite some absences, with <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/520548/calais-campbell/\">Calais Campbell</a>, in particular, dominating as a pass rusher from the inside.</p><h2>When the Cardinals have the ball</h2><p>The Cardinals also come into this game short-handed on offense after they lost running back <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/2071585/james-conner/\">James Conner</a> for the season, thanks to a gruesome ankle injury suffered last week. </p><p>Conner wasn't looking particularly effective so far this year but he's a big part of the personality of what they want to be offensively and his loss is significant. He'll be replaced in the backfield mostly by <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/3176915/trey-benson/\">Trey Benson</a>, who had taken over a larger role to start the season, casting aside Emari Demercardo to take over the passing-down snaps while splitting the early-down work with Conner. Benson now presumably slides into Conner's role and Demercado takes over the long down and distance stuff that he handled for the last couple of years. </p>\n<p>Benson was an exciting, athletic prospect and has looked good in his limited action so far this year but he's not the same kind of physical runner that Conner is, so it'll be interesting to see how that switch affects Arizona's run game. That's especially the case because it already looked like said run game had taken something of a step backward, which was part of the fear when they lost former offensive line coach Klayton Adams to the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/DAL/dallas-cowboys/\">Cowboys</a>, who surprisingly rank first in the NFL in rushing success rate with Adams as their new offensive coordinator. </p><p>The Seahawks have defended the run as well as almost anyone in the league so far this season, allowing just 3.2 yards per carry and having yet to give up a touchdown on the ground. Opponents have just a 36.4% rushing success rate, per Tru Media, and they've averaged only 2.11 yards after contact per carry, which is the lowest mark against any defense in the NFL. Benson and Co. could find tough sledding on Thursday night. (Four offensive linemen are also listed as questionable for the game, which would make things even tougher if any of them can't give it a go.)</p><p>Seattle's pass defense has also been playing extremely well thus far, with more interceptions (five) than touchdowns allowed (four). Opponents are averaging 6.4 yards per attempt and nobody has thrown for more than 265 yards. The Seahawks are also getting star cornerback <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/3137159/devon-witherspoon/\">Devon Witherspoon</a> and safety <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/2260683/julian-love/\">Julian Love</a> back in the lineup for this game, further strengthening the back end of the defense. </p>\n<p><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/2180829/kyler-murrays/\">Kyler Murray's</a> connection with <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/2963385/trey-mcbride/\">Trey McBride</a> looks as strong as ever, and the one area where Seattle has been vulnerable to date has been against tight ends (tight ends have 24 receptions against the Seahawks so far this season, tied for the most in the league), but but Murray and <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/26701883/marvin-harrison-jr/\">Marvin Harrison Jr</a>. are again seemingly just not on the same page as they have has several missed connections due to either missed throws or drops. Harrison doesn't play a lot in the slot and Witherspoon spends a lot of time there, but given the relative weakness of Arizona's other receiving options, Harrison could potentially see some shadow coverage, making the matchup even more difficult.</p><h2>Prediction</h2><p>The Cardinals have the advantage of playing this game at home, but everything else is working against them here. They're not healthy. It's not a great matchup on either side of the ball. Seattle is getting players back on the field and already playing well. We're rolling with the Seahawks to win and cover.</p><p><strong>Pick: Seahawks 24, Cardinals 17</strong></p><p><em>Seattle (-1.5) and all your NFL Week 4 odds provided <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/betting/news/betmgm-promo-code/\">BetMGM</a></em></p>\n            </div>"

    "body": "<div>\n        <p>The 2026 <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://cbssports.com/nfl/draft/\">NFL Draft</a> class is muddy, to say the least. There is a lot to learn about the eligible prospects, as few have staked their claim as the potential No. 1 overall selection. Prospects have the opportunity to alter the narrative, for better or worse, surrounding their stock with new film each week. Has any quarterback separated himself as the likely QB1? </p><p>In an effort to bring some transparency to the process and offer perspective on how the class is currently viewed, I reached out to fellow CBS Sports <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://cbssports.com/nfl/draft/\">NFL draft</a> analysts Ryan Wilson and Mike Renner. Here is a six-pack of questions answering some of the draft's most oft-discussed topics.</p><h2>1. Who has been the most impressive prospect?</h2>\n<p><strong>Ryan Wilson: </strong><em>EDGE <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/players/29125808/rueben-bain-jr/\">Rueben Bain Jr.</a>, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/teams/MIAMI/miami-fla-hurricanes/\">Miami</a>. </em>\"What makes the Miami edge rusher a standout isn't just his production, but the complete and dominant nature of his game. He has showcased an NFL-ready skill set that blends elite power with surprising agility and a relentless motor.</p><p>He's incredibly disruptive off the snap, consistently winning with an explosive first step and a powerful bull rush, but also possesses an array of pass-rush moves rarely seen in a player who just turned 21 years old.</p>\n<p>Bain is also stout and powerful against the run; he uses his hands exceptionally well to disengage from blocks and quickly get into the backfield. His ability to win with power, bend and an arsenal of moves has turned the first month of the season into teach tape. Don't be fooled by his age; he's as polished and complete a player as any in the class, and he's done it against top competition. It's hard to imagine he won't be a top five pick in April.\"</p><p><strong>Mike Renner:</strong> <em>EDGE Rueben Bain Jr., Miami.</em> \"Rueben Bain hands down. The start to his season reminds me a little of <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/2968514/aidan-hutchinsons/\">Aidan Hutchinson's</a> final year. Bain has made the leap from solid to completely unblockable. The only players who can handle his power play on Sundays.\"</p><p><strong>Josh Edwards:</strong> <em>EDGE Rueben Bain Jr., Miami</em>. \"Miami has played one high-leverage game after another to begin the season. In those moments, Bain has risen to the occasion and slammed the door shut as the Hurricanes have charged to 4-0. The rusher has a sawed-off frame with a thick lower body. Opposing offensive linemen struggle to recover when he gets on their hip. Bain is tied with teammate <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/players/3168300/akheem-mesidor/\">Akheem Mesidor</a> for sixth nationally with 19 pressures. Overall length and wingspan will be important in determining how high Bain is taken, but few have made a stronger case to go No. 1 overall.\"</p>\n<h2>2. Who has been the most disappointing prospect?</h2><p><strong>Wilson:</strong> <em>QB <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/players/28874636/cade-klubnik/\">Cade Klubnik</a>, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/teams/CLEM/clemson-tigers/\">Clemson</a></em>. \"The Tigers' abysmal start isn't all on Klubnik; in fact, he's thrown for more than 1,000 yards in the first four games, including 380 in the home loss to <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/teams/CUSE/syracuse-orange/\">Syracuse</a>. The problem is that Klubnik looks a lot like the player I saw in 2024: a Day 2 prospect who doesn't have elite physical traits, and if he's going to make his way into the first-round conversation, he's going to have to do it in much the same way <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/3121193/bo-nix/\">Bo Nix</a> elevated himself to a top 12 selection in 2024. Unfortunately, it has yet to come together for Klubnik, who has struggled to take care of the ball during Clemson's 1-3 start (four interceptions and a lost fumble over the span). </p><p>Klubnik is a good athlete -- again, think Bo Nix -- but at just over 6-foot-1 and possessing an above-average arm, he doesn't stand out in the way, for example, Cameron Ward or <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/players/28906824/caleb-williams/\">Caleb Williams</a> (6-foot-1 and 6-foot, respectively) did when they were going through the draft process. A lot can change over the next few months, but Klubnik and the Tigers have gotten off to a rocky start.\"</p><p><strong>Renner:</strong> <em>OT <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/players/28897667/kadyn-proctor/\">Kadyn Proctor</a>, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/teams/BAMA/alabama-crimson-tide/\">Alabama</a>.</em> \"I'll pass over the quarterback position entirely since it's so difficult to scout and go to the usually more stable offensive tackle position. Alabama's Kadyn Proctor had a ton of preseason hype and was ranked No. 2 on Bruce Feldman's Freaks List. Through three games, his heavy feet have been exposed, as he has already allowed nine pressures. He may be playing his way into a move to guard and maybe outside the top 100 picks entirely.\"</p>\n<p><strong>Edwards</strong>: <em>OT Kadyn Proctor, Alabama</em>. \"There were always concessions made to include Proctor among the top prospects in this class. The reality is that his athleticism and pliability were always going to be a concern at his size, but few could have expected he would begin this season in such a manner. The <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/teams/IOWA/iowa-hawkeyes/\">Iowa</a> native has allowed nine pressures on the year, according to TruMedia, tanking his draft stock.</p><h2>3. Who has been the biggest riser?</h2><p><strong>Wilson:</strong> <em>QB <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/players/28895698/dante-moore/\">Dante Moore</a> Jr., <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/teams/OREG/oregon-ducks/\">Oregon</a></em>. \"Moore has been so much fun to watch over the first few weeks. In fact, we talked about him on \"With the First Pick\" after the Ducks' decisive win over <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/teams/NWEST/northwestern-wildcats/\">Northwestern</a>:  </p>\n<p>What sets him apart is a rare combination of pocket composure, impressive arm talent and a clear understanding of his role within the offense. He flashes a big arm, yet consistently pairs pace with great touch on deep balls. He'll also throw with anticipation, and his willingness to throw with confidence and accuracy over the middle of the field is a major asset.</p>\n<p>Ultimately, Moore's performance to date has been a masterclass in efficiency and polish. He gets through his reads, trusts his offensive line and makes difficult throws look easy. He has the necessary high-end physical and mental tools required of <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://cbssports.com/nfl/\">NFL</a> quarterbacks, though I can't wait to see how he fares against <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/teams/PSU/penn-state-nittany-lions/\">Penn State</a> in Week 5.\"</p><p><strong>Renner:</strong> <em>EDGE <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/players/29133533/quincy-rhodes-jr/\">Quincy Rhodes Jr.</a>, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/teams/ARK/arkansas-razorbacks/\">Arkansas</a>.</em> \"I've been very impressed with Arkansas defensive end Quincy Rhodes Jr. He went from backup a year ago to potential first-round pick through the first four weeks of the season. Watching him win with power, length and quicks on both the outside and inside as a pass-rusher has been eye-opening this season. That's a skill set that will get drafted highly.\"</p><p><strong>Edwards</strong>: <em>LB <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/players/29128702/arvell-reese/\">Arvell Reese</a>, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/teams/OHIOST/ohio-state-buckeyes/\">Ohio State</a></em>. \"There are several prospects going from relative unknown to coveted this time of year, because they had not received ample playing time prior to the current campaign.

Aside from <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/players/29122638/arch-manning/\">Arch Manning</a>, who is one player who may need another year of college?</h2><p><strong>Wilson:</strong> <em>QB <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/players/29122116/lanorris-sellers/\">LaNorris Sellers</a>, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/teams/SC/south-carolina-gamecocks/\">South Carolina</a></em>. \"It's funny, I've talked to several scouts who almost reflexively bring up LaNorris Sellers as QB1 in this class, which is full of intriguing QB prospects but lacking a <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/2179798/joe-burrow/\">Joe Burrow</a> or Caleb Williams. And I get it, Sellers could be special-special; it's just that he's still so raw. And while he's probably the best runner in the SEC right now (and I don't mean that as a slight), he also has plenty of room to grow as a passer, especially when it comes to getting through his reads, and throwing on time and with anticipation. Selfishly, I would love to see him return to school for another year. But I also understand why he would want to declare for the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://cbssports.com/nfl/draft/\">NFL Draft</a>.\"</p><p><strong>Renner:</strong> <em>QB LaNorris Sellers, South Carolina.</em> \"South Carolina quarterback LaNorris Sellers should be taking all the time he can at the collegiate level. I know he's freakishly talented and that the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://cbssports.com/nfl/\">NFL</a> covets traits at the end of the day, but he's still the least refined passer of the top prospects in the class. He'd be going down the Trey Lance/Anthony Richardson road, in my opinion, if he declared after this season.\"</p><p><strong>Edwards:</strong> <em>WR <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/players/29158026/nyck-harbor/\">Nyck Harbor</a>, South Carolina</em>. \"Harbor has a lot of talent, but a lot of work is still to be done. According to TruMedia, he has a 16.7% drop rate this season. He is a vertical threat to push the ball downfield, but route-running in the short to intermediate still needs refinement.\"</p>\n<h2>5. Who will be the first QB taken?</h2>\n<p><strong>Wilson:</strong> <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/players/28916321/fernando-mendoza/\">Fernando Mendoza</a>, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/teams/IND/indiana-hoosiers/\">Indiana</a>. \"A month into the season, Fernando Mendoza is my QB1. During summer scouting, I made it clear that I was wary of crowning Arch because he just hadn't played a lot of football. And clearly, he's struggling to the point that I hope he returns to college, too. </p><p><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/players/26701706/garrett-nussmeier/\">Garrett Nussmeier</a> was my QB1 over the summer and through the first few weeks of the season, and there's a lot to like about his game. But he's also 6-foot and change. <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/players/28915380/john-mateer/\">John Mateer</a>, meanwhile, has been electric, and in talking to scouts, there's not a name who elicits more excitement than Mateer's … but he's also <span><a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/news/john-mateer-injury-oklahoma-star-qb-and-heisman-contender-could-miss-up-to-a-month-after-hand-surgery/\" target=\"_blank\">going to miss a month with a broken hand</a></span>. </p><p>Right now, it's Mendoza, who is coming off a clinical performance against <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/teams/ILL/illinois-fighting-illini/\">Illinois</a> in a game the Hoosiers rolled up 63(!) points. It was as clean a game as you'll see from a QB at any level -- Mendoza was 21 of 23 passing with five touchdowns. He flashed his abilities as a game manager, showed an advanced understanding of coverages to go along with a plus-arm -- which allowed him to layer throws to all levels of the field -- and was consistently poised in the pocket (which was evident at times last year at Cal on a team with a suspect offensive line). He reminds me of the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/DET/detroit-lions/\">Lions</a>' version of <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/2061053/jared-goff/\">Jared Goff</a>.\"</p>\n<p><strong>Renner:</strong> <em>Fernando Mendoza, Indiana.</em> \"I'll go with Indiana's Fernando Mendoza. He's been so clean the past couple weeks. It's hard to poke holes in someone's game who has seven more touchdown passes (10) than incompletions (3) over his past two games. While he's not the kind of athlete who can create outside of structure much, he's a quick enough processor and has enough arm talent to be able to win consistently from the pocket.\"</p><p><strong>Edwards:</strong> <em>Fernando Mendoza, Indiana</em>. \"Sellers has the physical attributes to push for the No. 1 overall selection if he can be more consistent as a passer for the rest of the season. To his credit, there is incremental evidence each week. However, Mendoza has been the most consistent thus far. He has good size and has shown an ability to uplift his teammates in a short period of time. </p><p>I really like what Oregon's Dante Moore has shown to open the season as well. Time will tell if he is able to sustain that level of performance as competition grows stiffer.\"</p>\n<h3>2026 NFL Draft: No. 1 overall pick odds</h3><p><em>Odds via <span><a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/betting/news/fanduel-promo-code/\" target=\"_blank\">FanDuel Sportsbook</a></span>.</em></p><table> <thead><tr><th>Player (School)</th><th>Odds</th><th>Implied Probability</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Garrett Nussmeier (LSU)</td><td>+320</td><td>23.8%</td></tr><tr><td>LaNorris Sellers (South Carolina)</td><td>+320</td><td>23.8%</td></tr><tr><td>Fernando Mendoza (Indiana)</td><td>+700</td><td>12.5%</td></tr><tr><td>John Mateer (Oklahoma)</td><td>+1100</td><td>8.3%</td></tr><tr><td>Drew Allar (Penn State)</td><td>+1300</td><td>7.1%</td></tr><tr><td>Carson Beck (Miami)</td><td>+1500</td><td>6.3%</td></tr><tr><td>Rueben Bain Jr. (Miami)</td><td>+2000</td><td>4.8%</td></tr><tr><td>Sam Leavitt (Arizona State)</td><td>+2500</td><td>3.8%</td></tr><tr><td>Jayden Maiava (USC)</td><td>+2500</td><td>3.8%</td></tr><tr><td>Arch Manning (Texas)</td><td>+2500</td><td>3.8%</td></tr></tbody></table><a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/draft/news/nfl-mock-draft-2026-first-round-quarterback-shakeup/\" target=\"_blank\">\n        <div>\n            <div>\n                <p>Renner's 2026 NFL mock draft 2.0: Fernando Mendoza stays at QB1 while John Mateer flies up board to Jets</p>\n                <p>\n                    Mike Renner                </p>\n            </div>\n                            <div>\n    <figure><img alt=\"Renner's 2026 NFL mock draft 2.0: Fernando Mendoza stays at QB1 while John Mateer flies up board to Jets\" src=\"https://sportshub.cbsistatic.com/i/r/2025/09/24/00bb3f2a-5e8e-4697-9d83-82360fa5170f/thumbnail/270x152/8d151002dbe80e30cf62ef439490bd29/fernando-mendoza.jpg\" /></figure>\n                </div>\n                    </div>\n    </a>\n<h2>6.

However, Tony Mansolino has been able to guide the Orioles to a 59-56 record since taking over and that's left room for optimism they can get back on track quickly. Meanwhile, the Rays have lost 12 of 18 to fall out of the wild card hunt. The model has Baltimore covering on the run line in 69% of simulations.</p><p><strong>More MLB best bets</strong></p><ul><li><a href=\"https://www.sportsline.com/mlb/game-forecast/MLB_20250925_BOS@TOR/prop-picks/\" target=\"_blank\">Top player prop</a>: Brayan Bello, Red Sox, Over 3.5 strikeouts (-110) (MODEL)</li><li><a href=\"https://www.sportsline.com/mlb/game-forecast/MLB_20250925_BOS@TOR/prop-picks/\" target=\"_blank\">Top player prop</a>: Addison Barger, Blue Jays, Over 0.5 RBI (+165) (MODEL)</li></ul><h2>Thursday NFL best bets</h2><ul><li><strong>Game: Arizona Cardinals vs. Seattle Seahawks (Thursday, 8:15 p.m. ET)</strong></li><li><strong>The Pick: Under 43.5 points (-110)</strong></li></ul><p>\"The Seahawks are coming off a blowout win over the Saints, but they had just 104 net yards of offense by the time the score was 28-3. You can't count on extreme outcomes on special teams every week, and I see this primetime game being more of a low-scoring chess match between two good defenses,\" CBS Sports Gambling and Fantasy editor R.J. White (31-22 on his last 53 NFL picks) said. \"Seattle has yet to allow more than 17 points in a game, and the same would be true for the Cardinals had they not suffered a number of injuries at corner during their Week 2 game against Carolina. I see this as a 20-17 game either way, so the best play on the game is likely to be the Under.\"</p><p><strong>More NFL best bets</strong></p><ul><li><a

Kickoff is scheduled for 8:15 p.m. ET at State Farm Stadium in Glendale, Ariz.. Both teams feature a mix of proven star power and young talent. Seattle's Sam Darnold and Arizona's Kyler Murray headline the NFL DFS player pool and can be rostered together in showdown DFS contests.

The former Ohio State standout had a breakout season in 2024, hauling in 100 receptions for 1,130 yards, averaging 11.3 yards per catch, and scoring six touchdowns. He established himself as the No. 1 option in Seattle's passing attack and earned his first career Pro Bowl selection in the process. </p><p>Through three weeks in 2025, he has continued that dominance, notching 22 receptions for 323 yards, with an average of 14.7 yards per catch and one touchdown. In Seattle's 44-13 win over New Orleans in Week 3, Smith-Njigba caught five passes for 96 yards and a touchdown despite battling an illness. <a href=\"https://www.sportsline.com/insiders/nfl-dfs-week-4-cardinals-vs-seahawks-optimal-fanduel-draftkings-lineups-for-thursday-night-football-from-a-daily-fantasy-pro/#ttag=09242025_agg_cbssports_dfs_football_nfl_mcclure_TNFDFSMcClure\" target=\"_blank\">See who else to roster here</a>.</p><p>Part of McClure's optimal NFL DFS strategy also includes rostering Arizona running back Trey Benson.

He also caught six passes for 59 yards in limited usage in Arizona's veteran backfield.</p><p>Through three weeks in 2025, Benson has totaled 21 carries for 125 rushing yards (6.0 average) and has added eight catches for 45 yards. Benson has displayed three-down ability, and is set to step into a much bigger role with Cardinals' starting running back James Connor out for the season with an ankle injury. <a href=\"https://www.sportsline.com/insiders/nfl-dfs-week-4-cardinals-vs-seahawks-optimal-fanduel-draftkings-lineups-for-thursday-night-football-from-a-daily-fantasy-pro/#ttag=09242025_agg_cbssports_dfs_football_nfl_mcclure_TNFDFSMcClure\" target=\"_blank\">See who else to roster here</a>.</p><p><em>New users can see the latest </em><span><a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/betting/news/fanduel-promo-code/\" target=\"_blank\"><em>FanDuel promo code</em></a></span><em> to </em><a href=\"https://martech.cbssports.com/bt/redirect/prod?b=fanduel&c=sport\" target=\"_blank\"><em>get $300 in bonus bets at FanDuel if your $5 bet wins</em></a>:</p><h2>How to set NFL DFS lineups for Seahawks vs. Cardinals</h2><p>McClure is targeting another undervalued player who could explode for huge numbers on Thursday Night Football.

    "body": "<div>\n        <p>It may only be five matches into the season, but <span>Barcelona</span> are up against it, facing <span>Real Oviedo</span> in La Liga play on Thursday. With <span>Real Madrid</span> starting off the season a perfect six for six, Barcelona have dropped five points behind their rivals. While they can close the gap to two by the end of the matchweek, it already shows how tight the LaLiga race will be this season, as any missteps could cost a league title. </p><p>Needing to spend time without <span>Lamine Yamal</span>, who was out with a groin injury that he picked up on international duty with <span>Spain</span>, Barcelona were able to defeat Valencia and <span>Getafe</span> while scoring nine goals and allowing zero, and he's now back in training with the club ahead of an important week. </p><h2>How to watch Real Oviedo vs. Barcelona, odds</h2><ul><li><strong>Date</strong>: Thursday, Sep. 25 | <strong>Time</strong>: 3:30 p.m. ET</li><li><strong>Location</strong>: Estadio Municipal Carlos Tartiere -- Oviedo, Spain</li><li><strong>Live stream: </strong>ESPN+</li><li><strong>Odds: </strong>Oviedo +900; Draw +600; Barcelona =450</li></ul><p>But with Yamal coming back, Barcelona have also been met by bad news in the form of midfielder <span>Gavi</span> now being out for around five months. After appearing in Barcelona's first two matches of the season, Gavi suffered a knee injury that, upon further examination, required surgery to repair the damage. With it happening on the same knee that Gavi had an ACL tear on in 2023, it's one that Barcelona will need to take slowly, but it brings quite a hit to Hansi Flick's midfield depth.</p>\n<p>In <span>Pedri</span> and Frenkie De Jong, Barcelona have a solid double pivot for starting matches, but there's really only <span>Marc Casado</span> behind them. Flick has been able to push defenders forward and use Dani Olmo in deeper positions, but this is an area where Barcelona's depth will be tested. After facing Oviedo, the matches will keep coming with <span>Real Sociedad</span> and <span>Paris</span> Saint-Germain on the horizon. </p><p>That Champions League clash will especially be a critical one as PSG's press can keep up with Barcelona's attacking power. Midweek play will be a good chance for Flick to prepare for what is to come while also getting a chance to ease Yamal back into things. </p>\n<p>Getting strong performances out of <span>Marcus Rashford</span> will help Barcelona's ambitions, but to better last season's, where they regained the LaLiga crown, Flick's Barcelona need to prove that they can defend against the best teams in the world. Real Madrid will no longer defeat themselves, so if Barcelona get more than six points behind, their title defense could be over before it gets going. It brings added pressure to every match, but to get to the next level, Barcelona will need to feed off of that.</p>\n            </div>"

    "body": "<div>\n        <p><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/players/28877250/jonah-coleman/\">Jonah Coleman</a> is putting up numbers rarely seen in <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://cbssports.com/college-football/\">college football</a>. The <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/teams/WASH/washington-huskies/\">Washington</a> running back is responsible for more touchdowns (10) than any non-quarterback in the FBS this season, and he's done it in just three games while most of the nation's rushing leaders already have four under their belt in 2025 -- making his start one of the more quietly impressive stories of the early season.</p><p>That pace now runs into its toughest test yet when Coleman and the Huskies face No. 1 <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/teams/OHIOST/ohio-state-buckeyes/\">Ohio State</a> in their Big Ten opener on CBS. The Buckeyes boast the nation's top scoring defense and are one of just four FBS teams to not allow a rushing touchdown yet this season.</p><p>So, can Coleman help spark an upset against the reigning national champions?</p><p>To do that, he'll need to replicate the all-around production that has defined his hot start.

    "body": "<div>\n        <p>Ideally, the 2025-26 <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nba/teams/DEN/denver-nuggets/\">Denver Nuggets</a> will be both fresh and familiar. This year's training camp will be David Adelman's first as their head coach, but his ninth since arriving in Denver as an assistant. Cam Johnson will take the starting small forward spot formerly occupied by <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nba/players/2892728/michael-porter-jr/\">Michael Porter Jr.</a>, but the other four players will return to the same roles they had when they took the eventual champion <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nba/teams/OKC/oklahoma-city-thunder/\">Oklahoma City Thunder</a> to seven games in a second-round series that felt more like the conference finals. The new front office, led by Ben Tenzer, who is entering his 17th full season with the organization, added depth by signing several free agents, including <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nba/players/2938116/bruce-brown/\">Bruce Brown</a>, who closed several playoff games for the Nuggets during their 2023 title run.</p><p>\"The whole point\" of adding depth, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://youtu.be/8WawhJ40tcA?si=AzLqZhSxhOsqS_vL&t=271\">according to Tenzer</a>, is being able to play their starters fewer minutes throughout the season. With Brown, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nba/players/2067672/tim-hardaway-jr/\">Tim Hardaway Jr</a>. and Jonas Valančiūnas in the mix and steadier production from Denver's young players, the plan is to improve on the margins and be healthy in the playoffs. Rather than bleeding points when Nikola Jokić goes to the bench -- the Nuggets were outscored by 9.8 points per 100 possessions in non-garbage-time minutes without Jokić in 2024-25, per Cleaning The Glass -- they are hoping the second unit can maintain (or even, get this, <em>build on</em>) leads. There is pressure on <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nba/players/2202752/jamal-murray/\">Jamal Murray</a> to be in shape and produce like an All-Star from the beginning of the season, and there is an expectation that everybody will do what's necessary to compete for another championship. Even with a shallow roster last year, they weren't far off.</p><h3>The state of play</h3><p><strong>Last year:</strong> There was bad news before the season started, as big man <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nba/players/26776529/daron-holmes-ii/\">Daron Holmes II</a>, selected No. 22 in the 2024 Draft, tore his Achilles in his summer league debut. After a season-opening loss against OKC, Jokić <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nba/news/nikola-jokic-has-pretty-grim-assessment-of-nuggets-shooting-after-just-one-game/\">accurately described</a> the Nuggets as \"not a good shooting team,\" which didn't exactly alleviate concerns about the loss of <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nba/players/2067660/kentavious-caldwell-pope/\">Kentavious Caldwell-Pope</a>. Because of a <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/44622610/why-denver-nuggets-fired-michael-malone-calvin-booth-just-days-left-nba-season\">rift between Michael Malone and then-GM Calvin Booth</a>, Josh Kroenke <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nba/news/nuggets-governor-josh-kroenke-explains-how-he-knew-it-was-time-to-fire-michael-malone-calvin-booth/\">considered firing both of them</a> around Thanksgiving and again at the All-Star break, but ended up waiting until there were only three games remaining in the regular season. Denver was 47-32, on a four-game losing streak and in danger of falling into the play-in, but rallied to win three straight, finish fourth in the West and then win a seven-game series against the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nba/teams/LAC/los-angeles-clippers/\">Clippers</a>. Game 4 in Los Angeles was an absolute classic, but <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nba/players/2135532/aaron-gordon/\">Aaron Gordon</a>'s <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H_VQWzEt3Gg\">game-winning dunk</a> was just one of three enormously clutch plays he'd make in the playoffs: Against the Thunder, Gordon made the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YkRAg1LZc28\">game-winning 3 in the opener</a> and the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://x.com/NBA/status/1921065240675983732\">3 that forced overtime</a> in the Nuggets' Game 3 victory. Adelman installed a zone defense that made OKC uncomfortable, but they couldn't score enough to close out Game 4 or maintain the early lead they built in Game 7. At the very end, with Gordon playing on a Grade 2 hamstring strain, they had trouble even getting Jokić the ball.</p><p><strong>The offseason</strong>: They sent Brooklyn their unprotected 2032 first-round pick to swap Porter for Johnson, which gave them the flexibility to trade Dario Šarić to Sacramento for Jonas Valančiūnas. They also added Brown and Hardaway to their wing rotation on minimum contracts. It is unclear what is next for veterans <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nba/players/1622555/russell-westbrook/\">Russell Westbrook</a> and <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nba/players/1622506/deandre-jordan/\">Deandre Jordan</a>, both of whom remain free agents, but Vlatko Čančar signed with Olimpia Milano. </p>\n<p><strong>Vegas over/under: </strong>53.5, per <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/betting/news/betmgm-promo-code/\">BetMGM</a></p><h3>The conversation</h3><p><strong>Nuggets believer:</strong> In a just world, Nikola Jokić would have won his fifth consecutive MVP award last season. Aaron Gordon's stupid injury never would have happened either, and the Nuggets would have beaten the Thunder, then gone on to avenge the previous year's loss to the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nba/teams/MIN/minnesota-timberwolves/\">Timberwolves</a> and win another championship. I'm trying not to live in the past, though, and that's much easier now that the front office has plugged every hole on the roster. Cam Johnson was born to play with Jokić, Bruce Brown never should have left in the first place and the second-unit offense is going to be so much better with Jonas Valančiūnas and Tim Hardaway Jr. coming off the bench. Without even seeing them play a single game together, it's clear to me that this is the best Nuggets team ever. </p><p><strong>Nuggets skeptic: </strong>The initial wave of excitement about Denver's offseason was understandable. When you've forgotten what it's like to have a normal backup center on the team, Valančiūnas must seem like Wilt Chamberlain. Now that a few months have passed though, the enthusiasm of early July looks like an overreaction. Johnson fits well with Jokić, sure, but so did Michael Porter Jr. That move was more about finances than the marginal upgrade that Johnson may or may not prove to be. The Brown reunion is a nice story, but there's a reason he and Hardaway are minimum guys. I remember when Dario Šarić was <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.denverpost.com/2024/10/13/dario-saric-nuggets-second-unit-jokic/\">supposedly \"the Joker of the second unit,\"</a> and I still have the same questions about the Nuggets that I've had for the last few years: Can they put together lineups that can both space the floor and get stops in the playoffs? Can they survive the non-Jokić minutes? Can Jamal Murray be the best version of himself for something close to a full season? Until these are answered in the affirmative, there's no point of even entertaining the notion that this roster is better than the one that went all the way.</p><p><strong>Nuggets believer:</strong> A great way to sound<em> </em>smart when you don't know what you're talking about is to accuse others of overreacting. Instead of halfheartedly repeating the same tired causes for concern, why don't you look at all the things that have changed in Denver? There's a new lead executive, a new coach, a new starting small forward and a new bench! If you think Johnson and MPJ are the same, you're not paying attention. Johnson, while not a lockdown defender or a rim protector, is a significant upgrade on defense because he has far fewer mental lapses. Offensively, he's just a much more well-rounded player. Johnson's screen-setting alone will make a massive difference, and, rather than simply being a play-finisher, he will serve as a <em>connector</em> on offense by maintaining advantages and making sound passing reads. Everyone is going to love playing with him, and, since we've already seen proof of concept with Brown on this team, it's safe to say everyone is going to love having him around, too. I'm not sure you've really thought about the sort of looks that Hardaway is going to get, the fact that this team has never had a weapon like Valančiūnas or the internal improvement that is coming.</p>\n<p><strong>Nuggets skeptic: </strong>I promise you that I'm aware of the changes they've made. I don't even think they're bad ones -- I liked what I saw from Adelman last season, and I think this roster is a bit better than last season's. In other words, this team should be awesome! But I also think that the Thunder's internal improvement will be more significant than Denver's. Murray has been a Nugget for nine years now; I can't just assume that he is finally going to start a season strong and sustain it. I can't just assume that <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nba/players/3142467/christian-braun/\">Christian Braun</a> is going to turn into a high-volume 3-point shooter either, or that the young guys are all going to turn into two-way players capable of holding their own against OKC. I admit that I'm tired of talking about <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nba/players/3177664/julian-strawther/\">Julian Strawther</a>'s defensive limitations and <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nba/players/26779136/peyton-watson/\">Peyton Watson</a>'s offensive limitations, but that doesn't change the fact that those limitations matter.</p><p><strong>Nuggets believer: </strong>OK, fine, you've decided you must wait for Braun to prove that he's gotten better, even though he makes a meaningful leap every year. If you're doing that, though, then you should be just as conservative when it comes to, say, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nba/players/26776724/chet-holmgren/\">Chet Holmgren</a> and <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nba/players/28953818/cason-wallace/\">Cason Wallace</a> potentially improving offensively. And even if you're right that Denver is only \"a bit better\" this year, maybe that's enough! I know the Nuggets got blown out the last time that we saw them play, but that was Game 7 against the eventual champs. Let's not forget how small the margins are in that situation, and let's not forget that, a few days earlier, they had a real chance to go up 3-1 in the series. If Aaron Gordon hadn't strained his hamstring, we might debating his chances of becoming a <em>three</em>-time champ.</p><p><strong>Nuggets skeptic: </strong>Full credit to Gordon: Nobody who watched him play on one leg in Game 7 is going to forget it. That was an incredible effort. At the same time, I have to think Denver's lack of depth was a factor in him being on the court that night. If, hypothetically, Lu Dort had suffered that injury at that time, do you think the Thunder would have thrown him out there or simply redistributed his minutes to their other excellent role players? To me, the answer is clearly the latter, and OKC's superior depth was its biggest advantage in the series. For all of the moves the Nuggets have made, I'm not sure they're much better equipped to withstand an injury to any of their starters. On paper they are legitimate title contenders, but they still don't have much margin for error.</p>\n            </div>"

    "body": "<div>\n        <p>Every pitcher is hard to rank. We've been doing this \"toughest players to rank at every position\" series over the past week or so to close out the season at the FBT Newsletter, and it's been relatively easy to whittle the list down to a fairly manageable five (or so) names for every position, even outfield. </p><p>But at starting pitcher, it's basically impossible. Pitcher talent fluctuates a ton – guys just get way better or way worse seemingly overnight because they have a new grip for a pitch or because they lowered their arm slot by a few degrees. And if that's all it was, it'd be tough enough to project pitchers. But there's the injury risk on top of the inherent volatility. And then there's the fact that pitchers are way more dependent on their teammates doing their job to succeed than any other position. </p><p>I've got seven names here in the \"toughest players to rank\" discussion for starting pitcher, but it's an inherently incomplete list. I didn't mention <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/players/29075489/bryan-woo/fantasy/\">Bryan Woo</a>, coming off a breakout season, but with injury questions in his very recent past.

There are pitchers I really like who aren't in the top-30 right now; they are pitchers I think have plenty of upside who won't even be top-50 options.

When healthy, he was arguably the best pitcher in Fantasy, and while I don't think he's likely to be that in 2025, I can't say for certain he won't. </p><p>But I also can't say for certain he'll even pitch at all next season. That's not the likeliest outcome either, but setbacks happen. The range of outcomes here is unbelievably wide, and it's basically impossible to say which is most likely. So … I dunno, SP40, I guess? </p><h3><strong><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/players/2835054/hunter-greene/fantasy/\">Hunter Greene</a>, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/teams/CIN/cincinnati-reds/\">Reds</a></strong></h3><p><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/fantasy/baseball/news/fantasy-baseball-today-hunter-greene-trending-up-and-9-things-to-know-from-this-weekends-slate/\">I wrote about Greene a few weeks ago</a>, and all he's done since then is continue to dominate. He's going to finish the season with his best strikeout and walk rates ever, and while the sample size isn't huge (just 101.2 innings as of publication), he has largely built on the gains he made in his breakout 2024 campaign. I have very few concerns about the talent at this point. </p>\n<p>And if you want to be injury-agnostic, you could make a case for Greene as a top-five pitcher in Fantasy. If everyone has injury risk, you might as well just take the most talented players? I'm <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/fantasy/baseball/news/toughest-outfielders-to-rank-for-2026-sure-bets-like-soto-and-acuna-are-suddenly-fantasy-wildcards/\">sympathetic to that argument when it comes to position players</a> like <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/players/2507341/yordan-alvarez/fantasy/\">Yordan Alvarez</a>; it's a lot harder to make that case for pitchers, especially ones who throw 100 mph as often as Greene does. And especially when those pitchers have been on the IL as often as Greene has. Here's every IL stint he has had in his <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://cbssports.com/mlb/\">MLB</a> career:</p><ul><li>2022-08-05 - placed on 15-day IL with strained right shoulder</li><li>2023-06-19 - placed on 15-day IL with pain in right hip</li><li>2023-09-01 - placed on 10-day IL with COVID-19 (positive test)</li><li>2024-08-17 - placed on 15-day IL with sore right elbow</li><li>2025-05-09 - placed on 15-day IL with strained right groin</li><li>2025-06-04 - placed on 15-day IL with strained right groin</li></ul><p>I actually don't have too much concern about this year's injuries moving forward, though the fact that they recurred on multiple different occasions can't be totally overlooked. But it's the arm injuries that worry me, and that list doesn't even include the Tommy John surgery he had before making the majors. </p><p>Greene is an ace when he's on the mound. He keeps runs off the board, he has a sub-1.00 WHIP, and he goes deep into games while racking up big strikeout totals. But he has only topped 150 innings once in nine seasons as a professional, and even that season included an IL trip for elbow soreness. He could be worth drafting as a top-12 SP even if he just throws 150 innings, but is that really a bet worth making? Well, I'm not even close to being ready to finalize my pitcher rankings yet, but my very first run through it finished with Greene as my SP10. I don't feel good about it. </p>\n<h3><strong><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/players/2739968/framber-valdez/fantasy/\">Framber Valdez</a>, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/teams/HOU/houston-astros/\">Astros</a></strong></h3><p>Valdez has been one of my favorite pitchers to draft in recent years as a nice high-floor rotation stabilizer. Having someone you can count on for 180 good innings makes it a lot easier to take the kind of risks you need to for a good pitching staff. But I'm not sure how much you can trust him to be that stabilizing presence at this point. </p><p>His 3.75 ERA this season is his worst since 2019, when he was first establishing himself in the majors, and while the underlying numbers are mostly better, I'm skeptical. We're talking about a guy who turns 32 in just over two months and saw his strikeout rate and walk rate both move in the wrong direction for the second season in a row, with Valdez especially struggling in the second half. </p><p>Oh, and he's a free agent. Houston isn't necessarily a great place to pitch, but a potential change of scenery just introduces some inherent uncertainty that you have to account for. And in Valdez's situation specifically, comfort seems like a big part of what makes him successful. He might just return to the Astros, but they've been happy to let their big-name free agents walk in recent years, and giving Valdez a long-term deal might be inviting a level of risk they aren't willing to take on. </p>\n<p>If there were a path to a sub-3.00 ERA and 200-plus strikeouts, I might be willing to overlook some of the risk here, but I don't really see that. I'm thinking he might be outside of the top-24 at SP. </p><h3><strong><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/players/2006996/blake-snell/fantasy/\">Blake Snell</a>, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/teams/LAD/los-angeles-dodgers/\">Dodgers</a></strong></h3><p>Let's take a look at Blake Snell's ADP over the past five seasons in NFBC drafts: </p><ul><li>2025: 52.94</li><li>2024: 70.95</li><li>2023: 115.51</li><li>2022: 117.40</li><li>2021: 46.19</li></ul><p>I know there's been a lot of fluctuation in his performance, but this does not strike me as an especially rational marketplace. Snell threw 76 fewer innings in 2024 than he had in 2023, with a higher ERA (though a lower WHIP, at least!), and saw his price rise by multiple rounds. Is his price going to rise yet again in 2026? Unlikely, but who can say? </p>\n<p>In all likelihood, his price is going to go down in 2026, even if the fundamentals haven't changed much. He had a shoulder injury that will end up limiting him to just 11 starts this season, and that's a decent red flag. But he also has just two seasons out of 10 in the majors with even 130 innings, so he's never been a particularly good bet for volume. He's a frustrating pitcher whose numbers generally end up being pretty helpful, but you need to know going into drafting him what your personal level of risk tolerance is. </p><p>I have trouble justifying an early-round pick on a player with as rocky a track record as Snell, especially now that he's staring down his mid-30s. But if his price does start to dip to around 100 overall, I might be willing to talk myself into it. </p><h3><strong><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/players/29295981/nolan-mclean/fantasy/\">Nolan McLean</a>, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/teams/NYM/new-york-mets/\">Mets</a></strong></h3><p>Any pitcher with a small sample size and obvious talent is going to be tough to rank, but McLean stands out for just how stark his success has been. He was viewed as a good prospect before his MLB debut, but not necessarily a superstar – <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://fangraphs.com/\">FanGraphs.com</a> had him ranked 53rd in their mid-season update, while <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://baseballprospectus.com/\">BaseballProspectus.com</a> had him 34th among players who had yet to debut in the majors. He had a terrific breakout campaign in the minors, putting up a 2.45 ERA in 113.2 innings as a 23-year-old across Double-A and Triple-A, but he also struggled with control and had a 3.98 FIP in Triple-A, especially. </p>\n<p>But he's pitched like an ace so far, with a 1.27 ERA in his first seven starts. The peripherals aren't quite that good, but they're still pretty terrific, ranging from a 3.32 xERA to a 2.42 FIP. Those control problems have largely disappeared, and he has emerged as one of the best groundball pitchers in the game, with more than enough swing-and-miss in his six-pitch mix. </p><p>So, here's the question: How much of his strike-throwing issues in the minors were the result of being more focused on process than results, developing individual pitches in specific circumstances he wouldn't necessarily use them in if the only concern was the bottom line? It's an interesting theory, and McLean wouldn't be the first pitcher to seemingly level up against a higher level of competition. </p><p>Taken at face value, McLean looks like a burgeoning ace, someone you could justify ranking as a top-24 SP. I won't rank him that high, but I'm trying to find a place for him in my top 36, at least. </p>\n<h3><strong><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/players/2835065/trevor-rogers/fantasy/\">Trevor Rogers</a>, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/teams/BAL/baltimore-orioles/\">Orioles</a> </strong></h3><p>Rogers' stuff has bounced back, but not all the way back to where it was back in 2021. That hasn't mattered amid his resurgence, which has been fueled by some of the best command of any pitcher in baseball in the second half of the season. Did Rogers' years spent lost in the wilderness make him a better pitcher as he came out of it? That's possible, though Rogers really doesn't have a track record of throwing a lot of strikes and limiting damage on contact the way he has been this season, and those are skills that can tend to fluctuate more from one year to the next. </p><p>But here's where I'm really getting tripped up: Even the Orioles had <em>no idea </em>he was going to be anywhere near this good. Their season was already effectively gone by the time they called Rogers up for a spot start in late May, but even after he tossed 6.2 shutout innings against the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/teams/BOS/boston-red-sox/\">Red Sox</a>, they sent him back down to Triple-A. And they didn't call him up again for three more weeks. And it's hard to blame them when Rogers made 11 starts between 2024 and 2025 at Triple-A with a 5.37 ERA. I'm not saying the Orioles not calling him up necessarily means his season is a fluke – I'm on the record about what a bad job I think Mike Elias has done this season – but it does give me pause. </p><p>Ranking Rogers just 36th at SP for 2026 feels wrong given how good he's been, but I don't have the stomach for ranking him much higher than that. </p>\n<h3><strong><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/players/28920010/cade-horton/fantasy/\">Cade Horton</a>, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/teams/CHC/chicago-cubs/\">Cubs</a> </strong></h3><p>It's kind of the same thing as Rogers, to a certain extent. Horton <em>obviously </em>isn't as good as his 1.36 ERA since the start of July. That goes without saying, I think, but it's especially worth saying in this instance because Horton has a 4.8% HR/FB rate and .214 BABIP, making his success especially unsustainable.</p><p>But the skepticism around Horton isn't <em>just</em> because of his performance. It's also because of his lengthy injury history. A lot of Fantasy players (and, frankly, analysts) make the mistake of treating injuries suffered before a player makes it to the majors as less worrisome than the ones we've actually seen and lived through firsthand, but that's obviously not how it works. Horton threw just 34.1 innings in 2024 while dealing with shoulder injuries, and he also had Tommy John surgery in college. His 147 innings in 2025 are more than 110 more than his previous season, but it's also 60 more than any other season.</p><p>Maybe Horton has just turned the corner and those issues are behind him, but that's a pretty big assumption to make. Given the massive jump in innings and lack of track record of staying healthy overall, Horton looks like a pretty significant injury risk for 2026, which would make it tough to buy in even without the performance concerns. As is, I don't think he'll even be a top-40 SP for me. I'm not sure he'll be top 50, even. </p><p>And now here's what you need to know from Wednesday's games around <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://cbssports.com/mlb/\">MLB</a>:</p><h2>Wednesday's standouts</h2><p><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/players/2044508/jacob-degrom/fantasy/\">Jacob deGrom</a>, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/teams/TEX/texas-rangers/\">Rangers</a> vs. MIN: 5 IP, 2 H, 1 ER, 1 BB, 8 K </p><p>That's it for deGrom, and what a bounce-back season it was. He's not quite as good as he used to be, but he finishes with a 2.97 ERA over 172.2 innings, his highest total since 2019. It was a big win for anyone who took the flier on him before the season, though it does appear as if the upside here isn't quite as high as it used to be. The key question becomes, is the risk still significantly higher for deGrom in 2026 than for most pitchers? I'm ranking him as a top-12 starter, so I'm mostly willing to take on whatever risk is there. </p><p><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/players/2910624/jesus-luzardo/fantasy/\">Jesus Luzardo</a>, Phillies vs. MIA: 7 IP, 3 H, 0 ER, 0 BB, 10 K</p><p>Okay, I usually don't like doing the \"if you take away a pitcher's worst starts\" thing. You're almost always better off just looking at the whole track record, rather than trying to figure out which starts \"don't count.\" But in Luzardo's case, he had a two-start stretch where he gave up 20 runs, which ultimately accounted for one-quarter of the runs he gave up on the season. Take just those two consecutive starts out, and he had a 3.03 ERA, which matches with his 3.01 FIP and is in line with his 3.45 xERA. I don't think you should draft Luzardo expecting a 3.00 ERA next season, but I do think you can expect better than his actual 3.92 mark. With his strikeout upside and the Phillies offense backing him up, Luzardo probably needs to be viewed as a top-24 SP in 2026. </p><p><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/players/28926327/tanner-bibee/fantasy/\">Tanner Bibee</a>, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/teams/CLE/cleveland-guardians/\">Guardians</a> vs. DET: 6 IP, 5 H, 1 ER, 2 BB, 5 K </p><p>The past few starts haven't totally changed my perspective on Bibee, but they have made me much more open to drafting him in 2026. He made some tweaks in September, most notably throwing his cutter significantly harder, and it has turned into 23 strikeouts to four walks in his final 21 innings of the season with just two runs allowed. Bibee looked like he might not even be worth drafting after a disastrous August that pushed his season-long ERA up to 4.77, but the adjustments he made late should at least be enough to get him back on the late-round radar. </p><p><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/players/29376615/jonah-tong/fantasy/\">Jonah Tong</a>, Mets @CHC: 2 IP, 7 H, 5 ER, 2 BB, 1 K</p><p>I still have hope for Tong. He was the best pitcher in the minors this season, and I'm not willing to throw that away because of five bad starts at the beginning of his MLB career. But they have been truly terrible starts, with significantly fewer missed bats than we expected. He might just need more time to cook in the minors – he made just two starts at Triple-A before the Mets' rotation issues forced him up – but if he's in the Opening Day rotation in 2026, he'll still be a viable sleeper. I think the biggest issue here has been command, not stuff – he's just leaving way too many fastballs and changeups in the middle of the zone. If he can push those toward the top and bottom of the zone, respectively, he'll have a much better chance of succeeding. I'm buying the talent in the long run. </p><p><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/players/2932285/taj-bradley/fantasy/\">Taj Bradley</a>, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/teams/MIN/minnesota-twins/\">Twins</a> @TEX: 6 IP, 2 H, 1 ER, 2 BB, 9 K</p><p>Bradley is another pitcher who might have pitched his way back onto late-round radars. When it comes to those later rounds, you go in with the understanding that you're making low-probability bets on upside, so the potential for things to go wrong shouldn't really factor into the decision-making process. Bradley's poor command has limited his utility so far in his MLB career, but the stuff has always been good enough. If the Twins figure out a way to unlock some more consistency, he could still be a very useful Fantasy option. I wouldn't bet on it, because I'm not really a believer in Bradley's. But I'll throw him on that late-round sleeper pile for 2026, now. </p>\n            </div>"

There's a lot of ground to cover for a packed schedule of games. </p><p>Here's a look at the Week 5 games that matter in the playoff race, and what it means for both teams involved. </p>\n<a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/news/college-football-rankings-oklahoma-indiana-vault-into-top-10-in-cbs-sports-136-after-notable-week-4-wins/\" target=\"_blank\">\n        <div>\n            <div>\n                <p>College football rankings: Oklahoma, Indiana vault into top 10 in CBS Sports 136 after notable Week 4 wins</p>\n                <p>\n                    Chip Patterson                </p>\n            </div>\n                            <div>\n    <figure><img alt=\"College football rankings: Oklahoma, Indiana vault into top 10 in CBS Sports 136 after notable Week 4 wins\" src=\"https://sportshub.cbsistatic.com/i/r/2025/09/22/b3d3bcbe-d98e-4512-8606-f02176718a73/thumbnail/270x152/d65441d2c32e70f3707dfc6d195e4cc3/oklahoma-136.png\" /></figure>\n                </div>\n                    </div>\n    </a>\n<h2>No. 21 <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/teams/USC/usc-trojans/\">USC</a> at No. 23 Illinois </h2>\n<p>USC has flown under the radar a bit this season in spite of its AP Top 25 ranking and its sterling 4-0 record thus far. Granted, those four wins came in games that the Trojans should have won, but it's the first time they've started 4-0 under Lincoln Riley since 2023. If they go on the road and beat a ranked Illinois team -- one that entered the year in the top 10 -- they'll start to creep their way into the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://cbssports.com/college-football/\">College Football</a> Playoff conversation. </p><p>It's hard to call anything a \"must win\" this early, but Illinois <em>really </em>needs this win. As previously mentioned, Illinois entered the 2025 season with massive expectations. Those expectations slammed into a crimson and cream-colored brick wall in Week 4 when the Illini lost 63-10 to <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/teams/IND/indiana-hoosiers/\">Indiana</a>. As the final score may indicate, nothing went right. Illinois' vaunted defense got eviscerated by Heisman Trophy hopeful <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/players/28916321/fernando-mendoza/\">Fernando Mendoza</a> and its previously explosive offense was missing in action. Illinois now has to prove it belongs without the benefit of poll momentum. </p><h2>No. 4 LSU at No. 13 Ole Miss </h2>\n<p>In spite of its lofty ranking, LSU hasn't looked entirely impressive this season. Its huge season-opening win against <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/teams/CLEM/clemson-tigers/\">Clemson</a> is aging worse by the week, though that isn't LSU's fault, and the offense struggled to get going against overmatched competition like <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/teams/LATECH/louisiana-tech-bulldogs/\">Louisiana Tech</a> and <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/teams/FLA/florida-gators/\">Florida</a>. The Tigers scored just 20 points against the Gators in spite of the fact that LSU's defense intercepted Florida quarterback <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/players/28904801/dj-lagway/\">DJ Lagway</a> five times. The defense has shown tremendous progress under second-year coordinator Blake Baker, but it will have its hands full against Ole Miss. A road win here would dispel some doubts and make for a nice resume piece, especially with the Clemson victory losing luster. </p>\n<p>Ole Miss' quarterback situation is worth monitoring. The Rebels were humming with <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/players/29754995/trinidad-chambliss/\">Trinidad Chambliss</a> <span><a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/news/lane-kiffin-undecided-between-quarterbacks-austin-simmons-trinidad-chambliss-as-ole-miss-faces-lsu/\" target=\"_blank\">leading the way in lieu of an injured</a></span> Austin Simmons, but it seems like Simmons (if coach Lane Kiffin is to be believed) could make his return against LSU. If Simmons struggles at all -- he has been turnover prone -- it will be interesting to see how long his leash is. Ole Miss may be a more legitimate playoff team with Chambliss leading the way. </p><h2>No. 6 Oregon at No. 3 Penn State </h2>\n<p>Oregon lost quite a bit off of last year's roster that won the Big Ten and snagged the top overall seed in the College Football Playoff, but it hasn't lost a step. New quarterback <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/players/28895698/dante-moore/\">Dante Moore</a> has the offense humming and the defense has allowed just 37 points through four games. Not to put the cart before the horse, but a win here almost guarantees Oregon a return to the playoff. Penn State is the only top-10 opponent left on the Ducks' schedule (for now) and they get their two biggest remaining tests -- No. 11 Indiana and No. 21 USC -- at home. </p><p>Oregon hasn't played a team like Penn State this season, and Penn State hasn't played a team like Oregon. The Nittany Lions are 3-0 with wins against an FCS program and two Group of Six schools (<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/teams/NEVADA/nevada-wolf-pack/\">Nevada</a> and FIU) with a combined record of 3-5. The point is, we don't know a whole lot about this Penn State team. It should be really good, and it has looked really good thus far, but Saturday will be a huge learning experience for everyone. </p>\n<h2>No. 17 <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/teams/BAMA/alabama-crimson-tide/\">Alabama</a> at No. 5 <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/teams/UGA/georgia-bulldogs/\">Georgia</a> </h2>\n<p>Reports of Alabama's demise were greatly exaggerated. The Crimson Tide have totally moved on from their season-opening loss to <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/teams/FSU/florida-state-seminoles/\">Florida State</a> with back-to-back dominant performances against ULM and <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/teams/WISC/wisconsin-badgers/\">Wisconsin</a>. Not the best of teams to beat, but Alabama looked angry and motivated in each game. Quarterback <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/players/28878532/ty-simpson/\">Ty Simpson</a> has settled in, and Kalen DeBoer's squad is getting healthy at the right time. Core defensive lineman <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/players/26727268/tim-keenan-iii/\">Tim Keenan III</a> and running back <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/players/28875653/jam-miller/\">Jam Miller</a> are expected to return from injury against Georgia. Alabama's still walking a tightrope when it comes to the playoff, though beating Georgia would add some leeway down the stretch. </p><p>There were some major questions about Georgia early in the season, especially after a sleepy Week 2 performance against <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/teams/AP/austin-peay-governors/\">Austin Peay</a>. The Bulldogs dispelled any concerns by going on the road and beating <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/teams/TENN/tennessee-volunteers/\">Tennessee</a> in overtime. Quarterback <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/players/28876053/gunner-stockton/\">Gunner Stockton</a> grew a lot in that game and the running attack hit its stride. The defense had a surprising amount of issues while allowing 41 points, but there's enough talent there that it should return to the norm. Alabama will be another big challenge. </p><h2>Dark Horse Game of the Week </h2><h3>No. 1 <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/teams/OHIOST/ohio-state-buckeyes/\">Ohio State</a> at <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/teams/WASH/washington-huskies/\">Washington</a> </h3><p><strong>TV: </strong>CBS | <strong>Live stream: </strong><a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/watch/big-ten-football?ftag=CBS-03-10adg7j\" target=\"_blank\">CBSSports.com</a>, <a href=\"https://cbs-sports.app.link/QeYaC8MVDqb\" target=\"_blank\">CBS Sports App</a><br /><strong>Streaming on</strong> <a href=\"https://www.paramountplus.com/home/?cbscidmt=sports&ftag=PPM-22-10agi2j\" target=\"_blank\">Paramount+ Premium</a></p>\n<p>Ohio State is Ohio State. It doesn't look as if the Buckeyes have lost a step after winning a national title last season, and they're rightfully the early favorites to repeat. They cannot sleep on Washington, though. The Huskies look a lot better in their second year under coach Jedd Fisch thanks to a revitalized offense led by quarterback <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/players/28904635/demond-williams-jr/\">Demond Williams Jr.</a>. </p><p>Williams is the tip of a potent offensive trio for Washington. Running back <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/players/28877250/jonah-coleman/\">Jonah Coleman</a> currently leads the Big Ten with nine touchdowns rushing while wide receiver <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/players/28875368/denzel-boston/\">Denzel Boston</a>, Williams' top target, is averaging 15.6 yards per catch as a big-play threat at 6-foot-4. They'll need to be at their absolute best to hang with Ohio State. The implications of an upset are obvious for Washington, which is less than two years removed from its own appearance in the College Football Playoff National Championship. </p><p><em>SportsLine's proven computer model has simulated every Week 5 college football game 10,000 times. </em><a href=\"https://www.sportsline.com/insiders/college-football-odds-lines-spreads-picks-predictions-betting-advice-for-week-5-2025-from-proven-model/#ttag=09222025_lk_cbssports_picks_football_ncaa_model_CFBWeek5\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Visit SportsLine now to see all the picks</em></a><em>, all from the model that is 34-22 since the beginning of last season on top-rated money-line and over/under picks. </em></p>\n            </div>"

    "body": "<div>\n        <p><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/2181169/lamar-jackson/\">Lamar Jackson</a> has two <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://cbssports.com/nfl/\">NFL</a> MVP awards. He should probably have three. And that might be rectified before long, as the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/BAL/baltimore-ravens/\">Baltimore Ravens</a> star currently leads the league in the most relevant passing categories: touchdowns (9), yards per attempt (9.6) and quarterback rating (141.8).</p><p>Except the glitz and the glamour of Jackson's numbers and play style -- smooth-as-silk scrambles, effortless downfield rockets -- didn't translate to victory in a heavyweight Week 3 shootout with the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/DET/detroit-lions/\">Detroit Lions</a>. And it's certainly not a guarantee to help the Ravens best the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/KC/kansas-city-chiefs/\">Kansas City Chiefs</a> this Sunday.</p><p>The Chiefs may be fading as an inevitable contender. And this far into his career, Jackson's already cemented his legacy as a generational playmaker. But only one of the quarterbacks set to take the field at Arrowhead Stadium in Week 4 is entrenched in the record books as a bona fide <em>winner</em>. When it comes to that conversation, we can forget, for a moment, the shiny accolades and gaudy stats. For the biggest remaining measure of Jackson's success is whether he can finally topple fellow AFC powers.</p><p>Specifically, the Chiefs and the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/BUF/buffalo-bills/\">Buffalo Bills</a>, or the two teams to produce MVPs directly before and after Jackson's claiming the honor in 2023.</p>\n<p>No reasonable mind can deny the special nature of Jackson's Ravens stardom. He has the best career passer rating (103.1) of any NFL quarterback ever. He boasts the second-best career touchdown-to-interception ratio of all time, behind only <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/419780/aaron-rodgers/\">Aaron Rodgers</a>. He has the second-best winning percentage (.732), behind only three-time <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://cbssports.com/nfl/superbowl/\">Super Bowl</a> champion <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/2142052/patrick-mahomes/\">Patrick Mahomes</a>. He is, for all intents and purposes, a Pro Football Hall of Famer between the months of September and December.</p><p>January is a different story. And so, too, are the intermittent fall and winter meetups with Buffalo and Kansas City, when Jackson and the Ravens tend to play second fiddle:</p><h3>Lamar Jackson's career as a starter vs. Bills</h3><ul><li><strong>Record: </strong>2-4 overall (0-2 in playoffs)</li><li><strong>Passing yards per game: </strong>178.3</li><li><strong>Passer rating: </strong>99.4</li><li><strong>Total TDs: </strong>12</li><li><strong>Total turnovers: </strong>7</li></ul><p>Jackson's career rating against Buffalo isn't bad per se, but the turnover mark is glaring; he's lost the ball via fumble or interception at least once in five of his six games against the Bills. And ball control is far from the only issue when Jackson's faced the Chiefs:</p>\n<h3>Jackson's career as a starter vs. Chiefs</h3><ul><li><strong>Record: </strong>1-5 overall (0-1 in playoffs)</li><li><strong>Passing completion rate: </strong>57.3%</li><li><strong>Passer rating: </strong>80.7</li><li><strong>Total TDs: </strong>9</li><li><strong>Total turnovers: </strong>7</li></ul><p>Jackson's offset some of his passing woes against Kansas City by scrambling more, eclipsing 80 rushing yards in three of six games against the Chiefs. Yet, overall, he's been far more scattershot than usual. It's a trend that's carried over into his entire playoff career, in which he's gone 3-5 as a starter, completing 60.6% of his passes, with nearly as many total turnovers (11) as touchdowns (13) over those eight games.</p><p>Jackson's most ardent supporters might counter these numbers by arguing that the quarterback isn't exclusively or even primarily responsible for failing to conquer other AFC contenders. This is a team sport, after all, and shouldn't Jackson's numbers naturally dip against the best of the best? Shouldn't <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/2181054/josh-allen/\">Josh Allen</a> face the same heat as the face of the Bills, forever unable to get over the Chiefs hump when it matters?</p><p>The problem is, Allen's been much more reliable as a postseason game-changer. His first full season as a starter was in 2019, the same year Jackson also took over as the Ravens' uncontested No. 1. Yet Allen's appeared in almost twice as many playoff games (13), logging more than twice as many playoff wins (7), and he's had an undeniably direct hand in two different AFC championship appearances, with 33 total postseason touchdowns and a 101.7 passer rating against just six combined turnovers.</p>\n<h3>Lamar Jackson vs. Josh Allen career playoff marks</h3><table><tbody><tr><th>Statistic</th><th>Lamar Jackson</th><th>Josh Allen</th></tr><tr><td>Record</td><td><p>3-5</p></td><td><p>7-6</p></td></tr><tr><td>AFC title bids</td><td>1</td><td>2</td></tr><tr><td>Rating</td><td><p>84.6</p></td><td><p>101.7</p></td></tr><tr><td>Completion %</td><td>60.6</td><td>65.7</td></tr><tr><td>Total TDs</td><td><p>13</p></td><td><p>33</p></td></tr><tr><td>Total turnovers</td><td><p>11</p></td><td><p>6</p></td></tr></tbody></table><p>So why is there real pressure for Jackson to finally outlast the Bills? Not only because, well, surviving Buffalo typically means sniffing an AFC title game or Super Bowl, but because on the other side, Allen has already proven more than capable of doing the same for the Bills, whereas Jackson has had a more obvious hand in his own team's postseason slip-ups. And we don't even need to bother showing Patrick Mahomes' resume headlining the Chiefs; five Super Bowl bids in six years about says it all.</p><p>It's possible the Chiefs are truly turning a corner for the worse, with Mahomes pressing to make the most of another makeshift offense. Maybe, by season's end, Kansas City will be irrelevant in the playoff picture for the first time in more than a decade. Even then, Jackson's reputation as a big-stage quarterback will be at stake against whichever other AFC foes remain, the Bills included. Maybe the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/LAC/los-angeles-chargers/\">Los Angeles Chargers</a>? The <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/IND/indianapolis-colts/\">Indianapolis Colts</a>? How about the rival <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/PIT/pittsburgh-steelers/\">Pittsburgh Steelers</a>, who've also had Jackson's number at times, forcing the MVP into a 59.6% completion rate and more turnovers (12) than total scores (10)?</p><p>Again, Jackson is already etched into NFL history for the gifted athlete he is. Often compared to Michael Vick coming out of Louisville, he's already exceeded Vick as a pure quarterback, with literal MVP production as a passer and more career rushing yards than any player at the position. But Vick is still known more for his otherworldly athleticism than championship-caliber winning (he retired with a 2-3 postseason record), and so far, Jackson is on a similar track. He has no shortage of physical magic. No shortage of beloved leadership. Now all he needs are those defining moments when it matters most.</p>\n            </div>"

The Guardians had defeated the Tigers on Tuesday night to create a tie atop the division. </p><p>The Tigers struck first on Wednesday, with outfielder <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/players/2931997/parker-meadows/\">Parker Meadows</a> putting Detroit up 1-0 on a third-inning sacrifice fly.

Heck, the Tigers were up by as many as 14 games on July 9. Weeks later, the Guardians appeared to concede by trading longtime ace <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/players/2507333/shane-bieber/\">Shane Bieber</a> to the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/teams/TOR/toronto-blue-jays/\">Toronto Blue Jays</a> in exchange for right-handed pitching prospect <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/players/29644499/khal-stephen/\">Khal Stephen</a>.

    "body": "<div>\n        <p>BETHPAGE, N.Y. -- For as much criticism as the United States Ryder Cup team tends to receive, it has won two of the last four editions of the competition, including the last two times the event has been contested on home soil. When stateside, the red, white and blue has largely looked the part. Outside of a historic European comeback in 2012, the trophy has been raised by the home team for nearly two decades straight.</p><p>Whereas the Americans had a distinct talent advantage four years ago at Whistling Straits en route to a historic 19-9 victory, the gap has closed markedly entering the 2025 playing at Bethpage Black. The Europeans will trot out 11 of the same players they did in Rome two years ago, the likes of Rory McIlroy, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood, Viktor Hovland, Ludvig Åberg and Justin Rose reprising their roles as thorns in the side of the U.S. These are grand slam winners, major champions, FedEx Cup crown wearers and stars of not only the present but the future.</p><p>Back to the talent gap that existed in 2021. It was so vast that a correction was bound to occur; however, it has vanashed to such a significant degree that players who appeared to be long-time fixtures like Jordan Spieth, Dustin Johnson, Patrick Reed and Brooks Koepka are nowhere to be seen in New York. The experience level outside the ropes is just as fresh with captain Keegan Bradley stepping into the role against Luke Donald, a man who has already raised the Ryder Cup as a captain two years ago.</p><p>\"My main goal is to put these players in their best position to play well,\" Bradley said. \"When you do that, the guys can go out and perform at their highest level. But ultimately, the players are going to decide the Ryder Cup.</p>\n<p>\"But I definitely think the captain and the vice captains, their main goal here, their main job is to put the players in the best position to play at their best. Every day we go out, whether it's Friday of the tournament or a practice round, we want to make sure the guys are in the right state of mind with the right mindset of what we want to do during the week and get them prepared to be ready to go on Friday morning.\"</p><p>All of this leaves the U.S., meager -150 favorites per BetMGM Sportsbook, needing to find an advantage elsewhere, and ultimately, it will be a few small margins adding up to one big one if the Americans are able to discover what is needed. After all, Europe offers three of the top four players entering this Ryder Cup, while the Untied States is much stronger in the middle of its lineup -- as evidenced by CBS Sports' <span><a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/golf/news/ryder-cup-2025-predictions-team-usa-europe-roster-rankings/\" target=\"_blank\">1-24 ranking of the Ryder Cup rosters</a></span>.</p><p>Let's examine the possibilities below and break down exactly how the U.S. can defend home soil at the 45th playing of the Ryder Cup.</p>\n<h2>How the United States can win the 2025 Ryder Cup</h2><h3>Win the opening session</h3><p>The U.S. has typically fared well Friday morning of the Ryder Cup -- up until the 2023 edition in Marco Simone. Falling down 4-0 just four hours into the competition, the U.S. was immediately put behind the eight ball, and as such, the Ryder Cup was pretty much over just as it started. That cannot happen again, especially on home soil, and there is history to suggest it will not.</p><p>U.S. won opening foursomes 3-1 in 2021 and 4-0 in 2016. Other recent iterations of the competition largely started with four-ball (U.S. held leads of 3-1 in 2018, 2.5-1.5 in 2014), which tends to be a better format for the U.S. Therefore, if the Americans are able to get off to a strong start Friday it will have a snowball effect on both the atmosphere outside the ropes and the confidence inside them. </p>\n<h3>Suffocate Europeans with the home crowd</h3><p>There is a stigma around the Americans that they do not care as much as the Europeans do about the Ryder Cup -- or at least not act like it from an outward emotional standpoint. Well, one way to squash that criticism is to have thousands of New York sports fans doing the heavy lifting for you.</p>\n<p>There will be no sleepwalking off the bus like in Rome for the U.S. With the likes of Bryson DeChambeau and Justin Thomas on the team and Bradley at the helm, the key is to keep the energy up throughout the three days. Fans can grow restless if their side is sluggish and out of whack -- <span><a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/golf/news/ryder-cup-2025-europe-road-team-usa-miracle-at-medinah-2012/\" target=\"_blank\">precisely what the Europeans will hope to accomplish</a></span> -- but these are New Yorkers we're talking about. Keep them happy early and often, and Europe will be dealing with hostility from start to finish.</p><p>\"The fans are what make this event special,\" Xander Schauffele said. \"If you think about not having fans or enough of them, it would be like what we did ... [practicing] with my teammates out here in sort of peace and quiet. But when it comes to getting the juices flowing of the Ryder Cup, you need fans to be there. You need them to do their thing. </p><p>\"I don't have anything sort of -- whether it's everyone singing their songs, they're sort of like pub drinking songs in Europe or the sort of heavy 'U-S-A' chants we get here, I love all of it, to be completely honest.\"</p>\n<h3>Stalwarts must show up</h3><p>Europe has an uncanny ability throughout the years of having their go-to guys show up no matter their incoming form. If they absolutely<em> had</em> to have a match, they knew where to look. </p><p>Collin Montgomerie went 4-0-1 in 2002 as the 31st-ranked player in Data Golf, 3-1-0 as No. 91 two years later. Ian Poulter went 4-1-0 at Valhalla as No. 41 and 3-1-0 at Celtic Manor as No. 57, respectively. Of course, we all remember what he did at Medinah, flipping the competition on its head Saturday evening and going 4-0-0 on the week.</p><p>The point: Ryder Cups can hardly be won without the help of your stalwarts whether European or American, and that feels especially true this year for the U.S. Scottie Scheffler seems like a sure thing -- the world No. 1 will need to be! -- but the U.S. will also need contributions from Schauffele, DeChambeau, Thomas and Collin Morikawa -- in some capacity -- considering they are four two-time major champions who have been there and done that but may have some question marks. There is a reason experience can be a valuable commodity, so go out and show why.</p>\n<p>\"I feel like Bryson could be like the difference for us in a strange way from the standpoint of feeding into these fans, the style of golf he plays,\" Schauffele said. \"And also how -- like you'll get me, I'll make a putt, and you won't see too much of a reaction. That's just who I am. That's kind of how I operate. Maybe it might change this week, who knows. These Ryder Cups bring out the best in you at times. </p><p>\"But Bryson is like, this is his arena. If he views himself as a gladiator golfer, this is as good as it gets. He's been awesome. He's been awesome in the team room. I'm excited to sort of see what he can do, and hopefully get a lot of points up on the board because his points might hit harder than maybe my points, for example, just because of how he might celebrate and get these fans into this tournament quickly.\"</p><a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/golf/news/ryder-cup-2025-europe-road-team-usa-miracle-at-medinah-2012/\" target=\"_blank\">\n        <div>\n            <div>\n                <p>Why Europe can become first team to win Ryder Cup on road since 2012 Miracle at Medinah</p>\n                <p>\n                    Robby Kalland                </p>\n            </div>\n                            <div>\n    <figure><img alt=\"Why Europe can become first team to win Ryder Cup on road since 2012 Miracle at Medinah\" src=\"https://sportshub.cbsistatic.com/i/r/2025/09/24/15051386-726b-46fa-94ba-699c6b72be0f/thumbnail/270x152/cfaa88c1df7423cd7ae9b2c3c0b0e93c/rory-mcilroy-luke-donald-europe-ryder-cup-g.jpg\" /></figure>\n                </div>\n                    </div>\n    </a>\n<h3>Don't be afraid to run the rookies</h3><p>Not all experience is good, though! Just ask Matt Fitzpatrick from the European side and even more so when the rookies from the U.S. have been fast learners in Ryder Cups -- whether Max Homa in Rome, Thomas in Paris or much of the team in Wisconsin. Bradley's ability to balance the experience on his team and the form of his rookies is what may ultimately decide this Ryder Cup.</p>\n<p>Behind Scheffler, the four rookies on the U.S. team -- Russell Henley, J.J. Spaun, Ben Griffin and Cameron Young -- have been the most in-form players (based on total strokes gained) over the last three months. The straightforward strategy may be to let them ride with some training wheels with a veteran guiding them along, but the winning strategy may be to let them go without the governor in the golf cart.</p><p>\"I was actually talking to J.T. about it. I think … it's great to have gotten that experience, especially in a way, Presidents Cup last year, and it kind of -- the more times -- basically he said the more times you can be on a team and get that team experience, the more valuable it is,\" Henley said. \"He said he was really happy that he got to play a Presidents Cup before his first Ryder Cup.\"</p><h3>Withstand the surge</h3><p>This certainly could be a Ryder Cup with momentum swing after momentum swing, not all too dissimilar from the first couple of days at the Presidents Cup where the U.S. went up 5-0 only for the International team to tie it up at 5-5 following the second session of play. Perhaps, it won't play out to that drastic of an extent, but big putts and big moments will be had by both teams and it will be the task of the U.S. to not let things start moving faster.</p>\n<p>It will be easy for them to do so as the more inexperienced side and this is where the role of Bradley, the team leaders and the preparation will show and show if this U.S. team is capable of meeting the moment or susceptible to wilting under the Ryder Cup pressure.</p>\n            </div>"

    "body": "<div>\n        <p><em>Once again CBS Sports presents our annual Candid Coaches series, which spotlights relevant topics and issues in men's college basketball. Gary Parrish and Matt Norlander polled roughly 100 coaches in recent weeks on a variety of subjects. Coaches spoke on background and were provided anonymity to offer unfiltered opinions. This is the second installment in our 2025 survey.</em></p><hr /><p>Talk to any sitting athletic director these days, and most of them will tell you that among the toughest decisions they've had to make in the past year is how to divide the up to $20.5 million their departments are now allowed to share annually with athletes.</p><p><em>How much of that should go to men's basketball?</em></p><p>It's a question with lots of answers -- answers largely connected to whether schools have or do <em>not</em> have an FBS football program and/or how much a particular school cares about the hardwood. Put another way, every institution with an FBS football program is spending the bulk of its money on football, in part because of the number of players needed to field a team, in part because football is the driving economic force on most campuses. But the breakdowns are much different at schools <em>without</em> FBS football because at schools <em>without</em> FBS football the basketball programs are, in some cases, getting up to 95% of the money.</p><a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-basketball/news/candid-coaches-who-will-be-the-best-mens-college-basketball-team-this-season/\" target=\"_blank\">\n        <div>\n            <div>\n                <p>Candid Coaches: Who will be the best men's college basketball team this season?</p>\n                <p>\n                    Matt Norlander                </p>\n            </div>\n                            <div>\n    <figure><img alt=\"Candid Coaches: Who will be the best men's college basketball team this season?\" src=\"https://sportshub.cbsistatic.com/i/r/2025/09/23/41a74f0d-81ee-423a-9dde-66373b84a3ab/thumbnail/270x152/118c05f1652b83ff6d2a43bc0a7c9da5/cc-sept23-v1.jpg\" /></figure>\n                </div>\n                    </div>\n    </a>\n<p><em>(This is why multiple Big East and Atlantic 10 men's basketball programs currently have more money in their budgets than some SEC, Big Ten, Big 12 and ACC men's basketball programs, as <span><a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-basketball/news/why-sammy-jackson-a-top-70-recruit-turned-down-offers-from-every-power-conference-to-commit-to-vcu/\" target=\"_blank\">I detailed in a story earlier this summer about VCU outbidding multiple power-conference programs for a top-70 prospect.</a></span>)</em></p>\n<p>With all of this in mind, Matt Norlander and I decided to ask roughly 100 Division I men's basketball coaches the following question:</p><h2>What percentage of your school's revenue cap should go to men's basketball?</h2><h3>Answers from coaches at schools with FBS football programs</h3><table><tbody><tr><td>Somewhere between 25% and 30%</td><td>56%</td></tr><tr><td>Somewhere between 15% to 20%</td><td>35%</td></tr><tr><td>Somewhere between 30% and 40%</td><td>9%</td></tr></tbody></table><h3>Answers from coaches at schools without FBS football programs</h3><table><tbody><tr><td>Somewhere between 90% and 95%</td><td>29%</td></tr><tr><td>Somewhere between 70% and 80%</td><td>27%</td></tr><tr><td>Somewhere between 50% and 60%</td><td>19%</td></tr><tr><td>Somewhere between 30% and 40%</td><td>15%</td></tr><tr><td>Somewhere between 20% and 25%</td><td>10%</td></tr></tbody></table><h2>Quotes that stood out</h2><p>Answers from coaches at schools with FBS football programs:</p><ul><li>\"This is a tough one because I think it depends on the university you're at. For example, Duke and Kentucky are going to resource their basketball/football programs differently than Clemson and Alabama.\"</li><li>\"Figure football has to have 70%. Men's basketball, 25%. And I'm giving the other 5% to women's basketball. And I'm not giving any money to anyone else. Soccer, volleyball, hockey, none of it.\"</li><li>\"Twenty-five percent at the Power Four level. Exceptions for football blue-blood schools, which would likely lower basketball to 15%-to-20% there.\"</li><li>\"Twenty-percent minimum … I believe it's a matter of time before pretty much 100% of revenue-share will go to football and men's basketball. ADs just need cover. They want to put their money in the sports that actually generate revenue.\"</li><li>\"I think all of it should go to men's basketball -- but that's because I'm the men's basketball coach. Realistically, I asked for 35% and my AD gave me 30%. So I'm good. I think I'm getting more than most in my conference.\"</li></ul><h3>Answers from coaches at schools without FBS football programs:</h3><ul><li>\"I am at a school without football, without any other revenue-generating sports. We will not spend close to the $20.5 million as a department, but [we] do have a very healthy revenue share for our level. So with that said, 95%.\"</li><li>\"I'm at 90% and I think my AD would agree. It's been hilarious to see some of these other coaches complain about the schools without big-time football. You should have been in on some of our meetings at the Final Four. 'It's not right that the St. John's of the world, that they can now have this advantage!' Well, for 75 years you guys have had, if not one leg up, two legs up on all of us, and now there's this perception that we finally have a slight advantage? And I say this to them: Guys, there aren't donors walking around with $10 million to give every year and if they do, no matter how much money they have, they won't just give $10 million with no tax breaks like how it was with the collectives. Maybe they do it once or twice. They're not just going to keep doing it. It was straight paranoia at the coaches meetings. I think the irony is hilarious.\"</li><li>\"Because we don't play at the top level of D-I in football, men's basketball should get 90% of it.  Only revenue driver in the department.\"</li><li>\"[We have] more potential [for a] return-on-investment per dollar invested in men's basketball [in our mid-major league] than any other sport.\"</li><li>\"Putting myself in my AD's shoes, by not having football, I believe 70% of the rev-share should go to men's basketball. Our ability to make an NCAA tournament appearance would change the trajectory of [our] university enrollment.\"</li></ul><h2>The takeaway<br /></h2><p>As previously noted, the answers to our question were wildly different depending on where the coach being asked works, which is another reason this new set of (unclear) rules that the House Settlement brought to college athletics is filled with issues and nothing close to the problem-solver some touted it to be.</p><p>The rules will eventually be changed again.</p><p>In the meantime, we have some coaches fighting with athletic directors for the biggest percentage of their revenue-sharing dollars they can get, some coaches with dramatically different budgets than other coaches in their same league, some coaches in some leagues still with no idea what their budgets actually are, and some coaches in mid-major leagues with bigger budgets than power-conference coaches working on campuses where nothing really matters much other than football.</p>\n<p>It's bananas.</p><p>Which is why I liked the following quote we got from one coach: \"Why not make it mandatory for every school to give [an] equal amount in that specific sport?\" he asked. \"Football equals $15 million. Men's Basketball equals $4 million. Right now, coaches are fighting their ADs for more money. Eliminate that from the equation. Might bring more stability and level the playing field.\"</p><p>To be clear, I'll forever be against any salary cap, or limits on what college athletes can make, unless it's collectively bargained with college athletes and agreed upon. I'll never budge from that point. But as long as we're going to have what amounts to a salary cap in college sports, it does make <em>way</em> more sense, as the coach above suggested, for each individual sport to have its own salary cap.</p><p>What should the numbers be?</p><p>Again, that should be determined via negotiation and then placed into a legally binding CBA featuring penalties for violators so severe even the Clippers wouldn't think about breaking them. But, whatever the numbers, the number for men's basketball should be the same for everybody so that Kentucky's Mark Pope and Oklahoma's Porter Moser have the same amount of money to spend on a roster as each other -- but also the same as Houston's Kelvin Sampson and Colorado's Tad Boyle, as Michigan State's Tom Izzo and Penn State's Mike Rhodes, as Duke's Jon Scheyer and Virginia Tech's Mike Young, so on and so forth.</p>\n<p>Until we get there, it'll just be more chaos and confusion and, yes, high-stakes cheating -- <span><a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-basketball/news/arkansas-ad-hunter-yurachek-frustrated-with-state-of-recruiting-suggests-breaking-rules-might-be-needed/\" target=\"_blank\">as I explained in a column last week</a></span>. Either way, we're definitely not there yet. So men's basketball coaches from coast to coast are first negotiating with their athletic directors to get the biggest percentage of their school's revenue-sharing money that they can get so that they can then negotiate with agents to try to build the best rosters they can build. Some coaches have $7 million. Others have $3. Some have zero. It's a problematic system that forces schools to decide which big sports they want to elevate at the expense of others.</p><p>Lots of coaches don't like it.</p><p>We learned that here, too.</p><p>And, rest assured, you'll hear lots more about the topic next spring when the transfer portal opens and some coaches within the same high-major leagues are pursuing the same players with different budgets, leaving them with a decision to make about whether to play by the rules as they understand them or get creative and figure out a way to get the money where it needs to get, you know, by any means necessary.</p><h2>Previous 2025 Candid Coaches questions</h2><ul><li><span><a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-basketball/news/candid-coaches-who-will-be-the-best-mens-college-basketball-team-this-season/\" target=\"_blank\">Who will be the best men's college basketball team this season?</a></span></li></ul>\n            </div>"
