    "body": "<div>\n        <p>FARMINGDALE, NY -- Standing in the center of the amphitheater that surrounds the 17th green at Bethpage Black, the European Ryder Cup team experienced a different sensation for the first time all week. After two days of dream golf inside the ropes amid nightmare conditions outside of them, the boys in blue and gold could feel the ground begin to crumble from underneath.</p><p>A group of players stared at the big scoreboard above them, noticing only one of the 12 singles matches were painted with blue, the other 11 shaded in red or grey. The United States' comeback bid was officially on, and it was real.</p><p>Looks of panic were exchanged ... until captain Luke Donald stepped in, one foot in front of the other, remaining cool, calm and collected as if there was no scenario for which he had not prepared -- even the seemingly impossible that was occurring in front of their eyes.</p><p>What was originally expected to be a bludgeoning leading to a coronation turned into battle royale Sunday at Bethpage Black. Entering the final day of the 2025 Ryder Cup with a substantial seven-point edge, Europe did <em>just enough</em> as the sun was setting in Long Island to <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/golf/news/ryder-cup-2025-live-updates-results-scores-standings-day-3-singles/live/\" target=\"_blank\">skirt past the desperate American side and win the Ryder Cup, 15 to 13</a>.</p>\n<p>Europe won just <em>one</em> singles match in the final session, compiling a record of 1-6-4 that included the invocation of the so-called \"envelope rule\" before play began. Viktor Hovland aggravated a neck injury Saturday morning; unable to play Sunday, his singles match with Harris English was cancelled, and each side was awarded a half point.</p><p>What was originally thought to be a hotly contested event was supposed to be a stroll into the history books Sunday as Europe became the first team to win away from home since 2012 and only the fifth ever to win on American soil.</p><p>With the triumph, Donald joined Tony Jacklin as the second man to captain Europe to Ryder Cup victories. Unlike Jacklin, who was at the helm in four different editions of the competition, Donald stayed perfect when paired with his masterclass from Rome two years prior.</p>\n<p>Across the eight Ryder Cups in which he has participated as a player, vice captain and captain, Donald's record stands tall at 7-1.</p><p>In the primary role, Donald's team is 8-2 in the 10 playing sessions, never trailing in the competition. As far as the Ryder Cup experience could go for a skipper, Donald's first nine sessions were about as stress-free as one could desire.</p><p>Sunday more than made up for that, but in the process, it added another layer of context in when reviewing Donald's captaincy. Never out over his skis or with a sense of doubt in his mind, the Englishman remained unaffected by the pressure, poised and unflappable as it mounted around his team.</p>\n<p>\"The level of professionalism he's shown us the last four years, his attention to detail in his post and his knowledge of Ryder Cup and the game and what we do on the golf course day in can day out is what made these last two Ryder Cups possible,\" said Jon Rahm. \"He is the captain of this ship, and he's led us better than I can see anybody leading us. He set the bar extremely high for the future captains.\"</p><p>Details vary in terms of how Donald has made the greatest impact, but it's clear his presence gives Europe a winning advantage. Whether it is lineup composition, a reliance on analytics, scouting trips or the hundreds of other tiny, forgettable acts for which Donald accounts, the Englishman leaves no stone unturned. That accountability creates a universal sense of calm under pressure.</p><p>\"My job is literally to give these guys a better chance to win,\" Donald said. \"It can be as simple as some very small things. I'll give you an example: At the hotel rooms this week, the doors to our hotel rooms had a big crack that let in light. We brought things that covered the light. We put different shampoos that had a better smell. We changed the bedding because the beds weren't very good, and they just had sheets, and we created much nicer beds so guys could sleep, they could have more energy.</p>\n<p>\"Those are just little things. I'm going into some really small details.\"</p><p>\"Le Labo if anyone is wondering,\" chimed in a laughing Rory McIlroy, acknowledging the replacement shampoo. \"Really, really nice.\" </p><p>Donald voices with regularity that such details would not be discovered without contributions from his 12 players and support staff behind the scenes. Participating are the likes Tommy Fleetwood, Rahm and McIlroy, whose Ryder Cup journey alongside Donald stretches back 15 years as teammates starting as teammates in The Ulsterman's debut at Celtic Manor as a chubby 21-year-old prodigy.</p><p>Two years later, in 2012, it was Donald who was the top European player and best player in the world on that winning team at Medinah. It turned out to be his last Ryder Cup swinging the clubs, leaving a void McIlroy embraced with fervor, only strengthening the connection between the captain and his best player.</p>\n<p>\"Rory has made no qualms about how important the Ryder Cup is to him, and I think that's inspiring to me. It's inspiring to his team,\" Donald said. \"You know, maybe not quite on the same level as winning the grand slam and the Masters, but it's pretty effiing close. It really is.</p><p>\"He's talked to me about it many times, about how he wants to win an away Ryder Cup and how difficult that is. To have someone of Rory's caliber fighting so hard, that's inspiring for the team. You know, obviously you can't do it alone, but it's very helpful when someone like Rory is contributing like he does.\"</p><p>Donald's captaincy would not have turned out this way without McIlroy, and certainly, McIlroy's Ryder Cup revival would not have been possible without Donald.</p>\n<p>Now 7-2-1 in his last two Ryder Cups under Donald's watchful eye, McIlroy led the reclamation of the Ryder Cup in Rome after Europe was beaten down on the shores of Wisconsin by a record margin in 2021. Following that win in Rome, the Northern Irishman (successfully) called his shot in New York.</p><p>\"Ryder Cup weeks are the best weeks of our lives,\" Donald said. \"We talk about this all the time. Those individual accolades are fun. Individually, we want to achieve as much as we can. Rory has achieved so much in the game. His place in history is set.</p><p>\"But I think those weeks we spend together are the ones we remember the most and the ones we cherish the most because of the time we get to spend with each other. That's a big part of my captaincy is to create an environment where these guys are having the best weeks of their lives, honestly.</p>\n<p>\"We'll always remember this. We'll always go down in history. We talk about all the people that came before us that paved the way for us. Now, future generations will talk about this team tonight and what they did and how they were able to overcome one of the toughest environments in all of sport. And that is inspiring to me, and that's what Rory gets and all these other 11 guys get as well.\"</p><p>Donald and McIlroy are linked by more than just continent they share and colors they wear. They move in unison as the best European captain and best European player to ever grace the game.</p><p>In a perfectly European way, the whole is greater than the sum of the parts, though Donald and McIlroy's places in the equation create an exponential advantage.</p>\n<p>It adds up to a winning culture, a bought-in team -- despite the vagaries of the professional golf schedule -- and a burning desire to win no matter the circumstances. It adds up to a pair of leaders -- one inside the lines striking the shots, the other outside the lines calling them. It adds up to another European Ryder Cup victory.</p><p>Bonded by brotherhood and badge, Donald and McIlroy stand alone as the greatest captain-player duo in history.</p>\n            </div>"

Last year, the Yankees barged to the pennant before falling to the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/teams/LAD/los-angeles-dodgers/\">Dodgers</a> in the World Series in five games. Over the winter, they lost generational free agent <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/players/2507367/juan-soto/\">Juan Soto</a> to the crosstown <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/teams/NYM/new-york-mets/\">Mets</a>, but high-value performances from <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/players/2184451/trent-grisham/\">Trent Grisham</a> and <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/players/2165919/cody-bellinger/\">Cody Bellinger</a> helped cushion the blow and then some. Besides the usual rotation questions that accompany almost any playoff team, the Yankees' big subplot will be whether AL MVP candidate <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/players/2071264/aaron-judge/\">Aaron Judge</a> can flip the script on his generalized postseason struggles.</p>\n<p><strong>Red Sox</strong>: Boston is in the postseason for the first time since 2021 and just the second time since 2018, when they last won the World Series. The challenge for Alex Cora and the Sox will be toppling the Yanks without the services of rookie phenom <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/players/29075759/roman-anthony/\">Roman Anthony</a>. Anthony was perhaps Boston's best player starting with his June call-up, but an oblique injury suffered in early September will keep him out for at least this opening round. In more general terms, the Red Sox are hoping regular-season trends hold. That's because they won nine of 13 head-to-head games against the Yankees and outscored them by a margin of 66-51. In games played in the Bronx -- where the entirety of this series will take place -- the Sox went 5-2. </p>\n            </div>\n    </div>"

    "body": "<div>\n        <p>USC star JuJu Watkins announced on social media Sunday that she will not play for the Trojans during the 2025-26 NCAA season. Watkins, who tore her ACL in her right knee during the 2025 Women's NCAA Tournament, said she wants to \"fully focus on continuing to recover.\" </p><p>Here is Watkins' statement in full:</p><blockquote><p>\"These last few months have been filled with a lot of healing, rest, and reflection. Recovering from this injury hasn't been easy, and I want to say thank you -- your love, support, and kind words have truly lifted me up during one of the most challenging times in my life. Because you've been with me every step of the way, I wanted you to hear it from me directly that following the advice of my doctors and trainers I will sit out this season and fully focus on continuing to recover so I can come back to the game I love.</p><p>\"I'm incredibly thankful for my family, teammates, coaches, the USC training personnel, Jason, Shane, and everyone who's continued to support me every day through this journey. I'm excited to keep putting the work in to come back even stronger.\"</p></blockquote><p>Watkins was around the team this summer during her rehab process, but was not on the court when the team held its first official practice on Sept. 23. USC coach Lindsay Gottlieb told reporters earlier this month that Watkins' recovery was \"going great,\" but did not elaborate on her status.</p><p>Watkins' announcement that she is sitting out of the entire season will save her teammates and coaches from having to answer constant questions about a possible return throughout the season. </p><p>\"JuJu's health and well-being are our top priority, and we fully support her decision to focus on recovery this season,\" Gottlieb <a href=\"https://usctrojans.com/news/2025/9/28/womens-basketball-uscs-juju-watkins-to-miss-2025-26-season-to-focus-on-recovery\" target=\"_blank\">said in a press release</a>. \"While we will certainly miss her impact on the court, she continues to play a vital role in our program as a leader and teammate. The strength and maturity she has shown through this process is a reflection of who she is, and we know the Trojan Family will continue to rally behind her. We look forward to the day she returns to competition stronger than ever.\"</p><p>Watkins averaged 23.9 points, 6.8 rebounds, 3.4 assists, 2.2 steals and 1.8 blocks during her sophomore season, and racked up numerous accolades, including Naismith Player of the Year, Big Ten Player of the Year and a unanimous spot on the AP All-American First Team. </p>\n<p>During USC's 96-59 win over No. 9 seed Mississippi State in the second round of the 2025 Women's NCAA Tournament, Watkins was driving to the basket in transition when her knee buckled and she collapsed to the ground. She had to be helped off the floor and was unable to play during the remainder of the Big Dance. The Trojans were ultimately eliminated in the Elite Eight by UConn, the eventual national champions. </p><p>Watkins, who is entering her junior season, is not eligible to declare for the WNBA until 2027 based on the league's current draft rules. As things stand, domestic prospects must be at least 22 years old in the calendar year in which the draft takes place to be eligible. </p><p>It is possible that the draft rules will be changed in the new collective bargaining agreement -- whenever a new deal is actually ratified. The WNBPA and the WNBA are currently embroiled in a heated labor battle that does not seem likely to be resolved any time soon. </p><p>Watkins has previously said that she hopes the age limit will be lowered. </p>\n<p>\"I want to say personally I am enjoying my experience, Coach,\" Watkins said during an <a href=\"https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/jujus-one-relatable-trait-with-juju-watkins-and/id1752100672?i=1000680797739\" target=\"_blank\">appearance on \"Good Game with Sarah Spain</a>\" last year. \"I definitely think we should have the option. There's just been such a growth in college basketball where it's like, why would you want to leave? Because you're able to have that experience and build your brand here in college as well. I would definitely say we should have the option but I think college is a way to prepare us for the pros as well. So, I don't know. It's a touchy subject, but I'm for it.\"</p>\n            </div>"

She went to the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/wnba/teams/CT/connecticut-sun/\">Connecticut Sun</a> in free agency in 2020 and the Indiana Fever in free agency last offseason, but her time in Indiana didn't go smoothly and she was waived by the Fever in early June. The Mercury took advantage and signed her, and while her offense has been spotty at times -- particularly in this series -- she came up big when it mattered the most</p><p>\"I'm sure that there was people wondering why I was playing (Bonner) at times this series. We went and got her for this reason. I told her after the game, the first three games weren't a big enough moment for her. She needed the fourth to step up. And I mean, she hit some big threes. Her experience, that's why you go get a player like that,\" Mercury head coach Nate Tibbetts said.</p><p>\"I'm just home,\" Bonner said. \"It feels good.\"</p><p>Even though the Lynx were shorthanded on the court and on the sidelines, they were still a tough out.</p>\n<p>Minnesota's effort was led by <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/wnba/players/2130762/kayla-mcbride/\">Kayla McBride</a>, who set a new playoff career-high with 31 points. She scored just 11 points in the first half but started to take over after the break with 14 points in the next 10 minutes. Her momentum helped her team outscore the Mercury 30-17 in the third and register their highest-scoring quarter of the series. Meanwhile, Phoenix forward Satou Sabally scored 18 points in the first half but was held to just three points in the third quarter. </p><p>But this series has been all about runs and stealing the momentum, which the Mercury did in the fourth quarter by turning up the intensity on both sides of the court. <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/wnba/players/26677803/sami-whitcomb/\">Sami Whitcomb</a> made it a one-point game with a 3-pointer with 4:46 remaining, getting fans at PHX Arena on their feet. A minute later, a 3-pointer by Bonner gave Phoenix a 72-70 lead. At that point, Minnesota only had one field goal in the fourth quarter.</p>\n<p>McBride tried to stop the bleeding with a 3-pointer of her own with 1:37 left, but Bonner responded with another shot from beyond the arc. The Lynx tried to make a final push, but they were not able to find the lead again.</p>\n<p>\"It was a struggle for three quarters. I give Minnesota a ton of credit. That organization, that team, they got some really good players. What McBride did was super impressive,\" Tibbetts said. \"I mean, for our group, we could have said, 'We're just going to go to Game 5 in Minnesota and figure it out.' It was ugly at times for us, but we kept fighting, and that's what we do. We're a gritty group. We were down 13 or 14 to start the fourth, and we just kept playing. And when you do that, especially with this group, good things happen.\"</p><p>\"It's us versus everybody all season long,\" Sabally told ESPN. \"Champions win these games, and we did that.\"</p><p>Up next, Phoenix will face the winner of the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/wnba/teams/LVA/las-vegas-aces/\">Las Vegas Aces</a> vs. <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/wnba/teams/IND/indiana-fever/\">Indiana Fever</a> series in the Finals, which are set to start on Friday, Oct. 3.

However, his play has not been good enough to pull the Titans out of their dark hole.</p><p>Ward became the fifth different No. 1 overall quarterback to get shut out as a rookie. He completed just 10 of 26 passes for 108 yards, zero touchdowns and one interception, while the offense recorded just 175 yards of total offense. </p><p>When Ward was asked how he thought he played on Sunday, he responded with one word: \"<a href=\"https://x.com/MySportsUpdate/status/1972400062807601222\" target=\"_blank\">Ass</a>.\" Ward also used that colorful noun to describe the play of the team as well. </p>\n<p>\"If we keeping a buck right now, we ass,\" <a href=\"https://x.com/PaulKuharskyNFL/status/1972399570605764640\" target=\"_blank\">Ward said</a>. \"We 0-4. At this point we got nothing to lose. We dropped a quarter of our f---ing games and we've yet to do anything. So we have to lock in. Especially myself. From the offensive line, from the defensive line, from the special teams to all three phases we have to play together. We have not played together this year yet ...\"</p><p>The Titans switched up offensive play callers this week, but that change led to zero points scored. The seat of Titans coach Brian Callahan is scorching hot. In his first 20 games, of which the Titans won just three, Callahan's offense ranked last in the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://cbssports.com/nfl/\">NFL</a> in total yards per game, and bottom five in points per game, yards per play, passing yards per game and turnovers per game. </p>\n<p>While it's not a descriptor everyone would use, \"ass\" is certainly accurate when it comes to the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://cbssports.com/nfl/teams/\">NFL team</a> that plays in Tennessee. </p>\n            </div>\n    </div>"

    "body": "<div>\n        <p>Week 4 of the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://cbssports.com/fantasy/football/\">Fantasy Football</a> season looked a lot different than anything we saw in Weeks 1, 2 and 3. On the Fantasy side, we received more data on how each offense plans to utilize its personnel. Our expectations for backfield touches, targets in the pass game, snap shares, and overall usage are often not met, and that's when we have to pivot.</p><p>In Week 4, several players jumped on the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://cbssports.com/fantasy/football/\">Fantasy Football</a> radar. This could be the start of something special for some of these players, and you'll want to get well ahead of your Week 4 <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://cbssports.com/fantasy/football/\">Fantasy Football</a> waiver wire by putting these players on your radar. For more on every player we discuss below, you'll want to make sure to check out Jamey Eisenberg's in-depth waiver wire column on Monday afternoon. </p><h2><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/2869402/zavier-scott/fantasy/\">Zavier Scott</a>, RB, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/MIN/minnesota-vikings/\">Vikings</a></h2><p>Here's a deep league Waiver Wire stash for you! Scott played the wide receiver position at the collegiate level, but chalk another one up to an elite Vikings coaching staff as he has transitioned to running back. It's easy to see what coach Kevin O'Connell envisioned for Scott at the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://cbssports.com/nfl/\">NFL</a> level. In an expanded role in Week 4, Scott shined as a receiving option out of the backfield. He was a mismatch when flexed out wide against linebackers in man coverage and <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/1907522/carson-wentz/fantasy/\">Carson Wentz</a> targeted him a whopping eight times in this league. Scott finished with 43 yards receiving on six receptions -- and a receiving touchdown. Scott makes sense as an add in 14-team full-point PPR leagues. He's also worth stashing in deeper 12-team leagues given the uncertainty surrounding <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/2071937/aaron-jones/fantasy/\">Aaron Jones</a>' injury.</p><h2><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/3171045/woody-marks/fantasy/\">Woody Marks</a>, RB, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/HOU/houston-texans/\">Texans</a></h2><p>Marks may be rostered already in your league -- and if so hopefully by you -- but as of Sunday morning he was available in 48% of CBS Sports leagues. Marks had his breakout party in Week 4. Marks turned 17 carries into 69 rushing yards and a touchdown. He continues to evolve his receiving role and turned five targets into four receptions for 50 yards receiving and a touchdown. Marks was the catalyst of the Texans offense (116 total yards, two touchdowns) in their first win of the season. That won't be lost on the coaching staff. Marks may be finally ready to take over as the RB1 in this backfield over <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/2131579/nick-chubb/fantasy/\">Nick Chubb</a> and should be the priority add on waivers in all scoring formats this week.</p>\n<h2><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/2968948/kenneth-gainwell/fantasy/\">Kenneth Gainwell</a>, RB, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/PIT/pittsburgh-steelers/\">Steelers</a></h2><p>Tip of the hat to anyone on top of their Fantasy notifications early this morning before the NFL's game in Ireland after it was reported that Steelers starting running back <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/3126535/jaylen-warren/fantasy/\">Jaylen Warren</a> would be a surprise inactive. Those who were around rushed to their player page to add Gainwell and they were rewarded. Gainwell broke out in his first start with the Steelers with 99 yards rushing and two touchdowns on 19 carries. He also added six receptions on six targets for 35 yards to bring his total yards count over 100. It's possible Warren may return for Week 5, but Gainwell has proven he deserves a role in this offense. And if Warren's injury lingers, Gainwell could establish himself as a clear-cut RB2.</p><h2>Carson Wentz, QB, Vikings</h2><p>Wentz has put himself on the Fantasy radar with 350 yards passing and two touchdowns during Minnesota's Week 4 loss to the Steelers. Anyone who Kevin O'Connell touches at the quarterback position seems to turn to gold. Wentz is seeing the field better than he has since his MVP season with the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/PHI/philadelphia-eagles/\">Eagles</a>. McCarthy's injury status remains murky and Wentz is worth scooping up to play in the right matchups. </p><h2><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/3162256/kendre-miller/fantasy/\">Kendre Miller</a>, RB, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/NO/new-orleans-saints/\">Saints</a> </h2><p>Miller fizzled out with the prior Saints coaching staff under Dennis Allen, but he has found a new role in <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/1274372/kellen-moores/fantasy/\">Kellen Moore's</a> offense. Miller carried the ball 11 times for 65 yards and a touchdown in Week 4 against Buffalo. It's clear Miller has a role in this offense and that role is only growing as <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/2082721/alvin-kamara/fantasy/\">Alvin Kamara</a> continues to show signs of regression. Miller is a sneaky add in deeper leagues ahead of Week 5.</p>\n<h2><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/2969027/tommy-tremble/fantasy/\">Tommy Tremble</a>, TE, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/CAR/carolina-panthers/\">Panthers</a></h2><p>Tremble popped with 42 yards receiving and a touchdown on five receptions in Week 4. Perhaps more importantly, he racked up eight targets as a safety blanket underneath in the pass game. Tremble is known more as a blocking tight end, but if he can continue to factor in the pass game with close to double-digit targets per game then he will be worth rostering in deeper Fantasy leagues. </p>\n            </div>"

    "body": "<div>\n        <p><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/26695757/drake-maye/\">Drake Maye</a> and <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/2963496/michael-penix-jr/\">Michael Penix Jr</a>. found themselves in the crosshairs entering Week 4. Both of these 2024 first-rounders came into the weekend with their teams teetering a bit at 1-2. Not only that, but each of them had a role to play in their clubs falling under .500, which allowed an uneasy feeling to begin to fester about their status as \"the guy\" for their respective franchise. </p><p>For instance, Maye's <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/NE/new-england-patriots/\">Patriots</a> were reeling after a Week 3 defeat at the hands of the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/PIT/pittsburgh-steelers/\">Pittsburgh Steelers</a>, where the young quarterback threw an interception along with a back-breaking fourth-quarter fumble. Meanwhile, Penix's showing was even worse. He also recorded two turnovers (both interceptions) and completed just half of his throws as the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/ATL/atlanta-falcons/\">Falcons</a> were shut out by the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/CAR/carolina-panthers/\">Carolina Panthers</a>. Ugly. </p><p>Those performances, coupled with their teams dipping below .500 and playoff aspirations drifting away as we wrap up the first month of the year, brought with them a simple question: How will these youngsters respond? </p><p><strong>Answer</strong>: Both Maye and Penix bounced back in Week 4 with not just serviceable showings, but the two former top-10 picks balled out as they moved their teams to 2-2. </p>\n<a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/news/nfl-week-4-grades-scores-results-highlights-chargers-giants-eagles-buccaneers/\" target=\"_blank\">\n        <div>\n            <div>\n                <p>NFL Week 4 grades: Giants earn an 'A' for huge upset over Chargers, Ravens fail out for blowout loss to Chiefs</p>\n                <p>\n                    John Breech                </p>\n            </div>\n                            <div>\n    <figure><img alt=\"NFL Week 4 grades: Giants earn an 'A' for huge upset over Chargers, Ravens fail out for blowout loss to Chiefs\" src=\"https://sportshub.cbsistatic.com/i/r/2025/09/28/60231d95-d2ac-47ac-8c59-d4aa9ffe3c91/thumbnail/270x152/9bdd00e16cc5083aaaee1cbb176f41cc/darst-jpeg.jpg\" /></figure>\n                </div>\n                    </div>\n    </a>\n<p>Beginning with Maye, he led the Patriots to a 42-13 thumping over the Panthers at Gillette Stadium. In the process, Maye completed 14 of his 17 passes for 203 yards and two touchdowns. He also added a rushing score along with 11 yards on the ground. Most importantly, he recorded zero turnovers. </p>\n<p>As for Penix, he was hyper-efficient as Atlanta outlasted the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/WAS/washington-commanders/\">Washington Commanders</a>, 34-27. After struggling to complete half of his throws a week ago, Penix connected on 20 of his 26 attempts for 313 yards, two touchdowns, and an interception. This was Penix's second career game with two or more passing touchdowns, and his 126.0 passer rating was a career-high. </p>\n<p>Both of these showings were callbacks to their clubs' glory days. </p><ul><li>Penix <a href=\"https://x.com/marcraimondi/status/1972395546427179505\" target=\"_blank\">became the first Falcons quarterback</a> to record at least a 75% completion percentage, 300 passing yards, and two passing touchdowns in a game since <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/420095/matt-ryan/\">Matt Ryan</a> in 2021 (Week 9 at <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/NO/new-orleans-saints/\">Saints</a>). </li><li>Maye's 74% completion percentage on the season is the second-best in the first four games of a season in <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://cbssports.com/nfl/\">NFL</a> history, and is only looking up to <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/187741/tom-brady/\">Tom Brady</a> in 2007 (79.2%). Maye has now also completed at least 75% of his passes and thrown two touchdowns in each of his last three games. Only Brady <a href=\"https://x.com/NFLPlus/status/1972391436151820565\" target=\"_blank\">(Week 1-4 in 2007)</a> has a longer such streak within a season in NFL history. </li></ul><p>While that statistical output is impressive in itself, doing so in a situation where doubt started to creep in (at least a little) about their long-term prospects as leaders of the franchise is the most notable. </p>\n<p>For at least one week with their backs against the wall, the kids are alright. </p><h2>Game Balls</h2>\n<p>Nacua is making a serious push to be considered the best receiver in the NFL. The <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/LAR/los-angeles-rams/\">Rams</a> wideout caught 13 of his 15 (!) targets for 170 yards and a touchdown in Los Angeles' win over the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/IND/indianapolis-colts/\">Colts</a>, handing Indy its first loss of the season. This was the third time Nacua has topped 100 yards receiving in a game this season. His 15 games with 100-plus receiving yards are the most of any Rams player in his first three seasons. </p>\n<p>The Pittsburgh Steelers moved to 3-1 with a win in Dublin, Ireland, on Sunday and did so thanks to an unexpected outburst from Kenneth Gainwell. With <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/3126535/jaylen-warren/\">Jaylen Warren</a>, the Steelers usual starting back, inactive, Gainwell sprang into the starting role and was lights out. On 19 carries, the veteran rushed for 99 yards and two touchdowns, while adding six catches for 35 yards against the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/MIN/minnesota-vikings/\">Vikings</a>. </p>\n<p>Get ready to hear your favorite <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://cbssports.com/fantasy/football/\">fantasy football</a> analyst ramp up the Woody Marks talk as waiver claims lock in this week. Houston's rookie back enjoyed a breakout game as the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/HOU/houston-texans/\">Texans</a> notched their first win of the season. The USC product had a nose for the end zone, hitting paydirt twice (once as a rusher and once as a receiver). Along with those scores, he logged 69 yards rushing on 17 carries and caught four of his five targets for 50 yards in the winning effort. Marks' 17 carries were a team-high, and his five targets were the second-most among pass catchers, so he appears to be taking over this backfield. </p>\n<p>New England's punt return game was elite in Week 4 as Marcus Jones ran wild in the blowout win over Carolina. The Patriots first score of the afternoon came on an 87-yard punt return for a touchdown by Jones midway through the first quarter. Jones finished with 167 punt return yards, which is a new franchise record. It breaks Mike Haynes' old record of 156 yards from 1976. </p><h2>Gaffes </h2><h3>Saints failed Philly Special</h3><p>New Orleans had the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/BUF/buffalo-bills/\">Buffalo Bills</a> legitimately on upset alert for a minute in Week 4, but dissolved in part because they got too cute when they were on the goal-line in the closing minutes of the first half. Trailing 14-10 and the ball at the Buffalo 5-yard line, the Saints opted for their own version of the Philly Special on third-and-goal. Spoiler: It did not go well. After <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/2963666/chris-olave/\">Chris Olave</a> got the football and attempted to throw a touchdown to <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/3125863/spencer-rattler/\">Spencer Rattler</a>, Bills safety <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/26693635/cole-bishop/\">Cole Bishop</a> hauled in the interception, and the scoring opportunity was eliminated entirely. </p>\n<p>Maybe we can call this the \"New Orleans Not So Special.\"</p><h3><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/26701928/adonai-mitchells/\">Adonai Mitchell's</a> miserable Week 4</h3>\n<p>Why does this always seem to happen? Hold onto the football until you cross the goal line! It seems like the simplest thing to do, but time and time again, we see players do exactly what Adonai Mitchell did at the beginning of the third quarter against the Rams. The Colts wideout had a runaway 75-yard touchdown, but let go of the football just before he crossed into the end zone. Instead of Indy scoring, it resulted in a fumble out of the end zone for a touchdown with Los Angeles gaining possession. Insanity. </p>\n<p>To make matters worse, Mitchell cost Indy even more points. </p>\n<p>With the game tied at 20 and just over two minutes to play in regulation, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/2866395/jonathan-taylor/\">Jonathan Taylor</a> ripped off a 53-yard touchdown to break the game open in the Colts favor. However, an offensive holding penalty called on Mitchell brought the scoring play back, and the offense ended up punting a few plays later. </p><h2>Two-minute drill</h2><p>Here are some of my quick-hitting notes/takeaways from Week 4:</p><ul><li>The Cowboys-Packers tie is the first in the NFL since the Giant and Commanders in Week 13 during the 2022 season.</li><li>The Packers don't look as impenetrable as seemed over the first two weeks and nearly lost the game with poor clock management in the final seconds of overtime.</li><li>Dallas didn't lose to Micah Parsons, but still allowed 40 points at home. In two games, the Cowboys are allowing 38.5 points per game at AT&T Stadium. Their next home opponent is the Washington Commanders (Week 7). </li><li>As I cautioned last week, don't count out the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/KC/kansas-city-chiefs/\">Chiefs</a>. Ever. <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/2142052/patrick-mahomes/\">Patrick Mahomes</a> was sensational in the blowout win over Baltimore, throwing for four touchdowns. Just wait until <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/3124978/rashee-rice/\">Rashee Rice</a> returns from his suspension. </li><li>Patrick Mahomes is now 6-1 against Lamar Jackson. Those are the most wins by any quarterback against Jackson.</li><li>The <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/BAL/baltimore-ravens/\">Ravens</a> are giving the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/SF/san-francisco-49ers/\">49ers</a> a run for their money as the most injury-plagued team in the league. </li><li>A potential Lamar Jackson-less Baltimore's next three weeks: vs. Texans (Week 5), vs. Rams (Week 6), BYE (Week 7).</li><li>Yes, Indy lost a game, but I don't see this team turning into a pumpkin. </li><li>The <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/JAC/jacksonville-jaguars/\">Jaguars</a> defense might be the most fun unit to watch in the NFL. Jacksonville's 13 takeaways (four on Sunday) are the most in franchise history through the first four games of the season. </li><li><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/3162979/rome-odunze/\">Rome Odunze</a> is on pace for 1,258 yards receiving. </li><li><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/1700358/geno-smith/\">Geno Smith</a> now has two three-interception games through four games this season. </li><li><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/26696165/emeka-egbuka/\">Emeka Egbuka</a> is my Offensive Rookie of the Year through the first month of the season. The Bucs rookie wideout had another stellar game, catching four balls for 101 yards and a touchdown in Week 4. </li><li><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/2240246/jalen-hurts/\">Jalen Hurts</a> did not complete a pass in the second half (0-8), and the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/PHI/philadelphia-eagles/\">Eagles</a> were still able to outlast the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/TB/tampa-bay-buccaneers/\">Buccaneers</a> late surge. </li><li>Philly has blocked a field goal for a touchdown in two straight games. They are the only team in the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://cbssports.com/nfl/superbowl/\">Super Bowl</a> Era to have back-to-back defensive drives end with a blocked field goal returned for a touchdown. </li><li>Houston's 26-0 win over the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/TEN/tennessee-titans/\">Titans</a> is the latest shutout win in franchise history. However, this win doesn't change my overall tune in thinking the Texans' playoff hopes are toast.  </li><li>Tennessee is 0-4 for the first time since 2009.</li><li><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/2181054/josh-allens/\">Josh Allen's</a> 27-yard scramble on third-and-5 at the 8-minute mark of the fourth quarter was an MVP moment that'll go unnoticed. That run led to the 28-yard touchdown pass to <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/2982991/dalton-kincaid/\">Dalton Kincaid</a> that erased any thought of New Orleans pulling off the upset. </li><li>Spencer Rattler is now 0-10 as a starter </li><li>The <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/26697761/malik-nabers/\">Malik Nabers</a> injury took some of the wind out of the sails of the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/NYG/new-york-giants/\">Giants</a> upset win over the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/LAC/los-angeles-chargers/\">Chargers</a>. While this injury makes life more difficult for <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/26694019/jaxson-dart/\">Jaxson Dart</a> going forward, New York seems to have found a QB they can finally build around. </li><li><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/2239523/dexter-lawrences/\">Dexter Lawrence's</a> 37-yard interception return is the longest by a 340-plus pound player since Shaun Rogers in 2007 (66-yard pick-6). </li><li><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/2221960/justin-herbert/\">Justin Herbert</a> completed just two passes in the fourth quarter vs. the Giants (three drives) </li><li>After all the worrying about the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/DET/detroit-lions/\">Lions</a> offense, they've scored 137 points this season. That's the second-most through four games of a season in franchise history. </li><li><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/28878286/quinshon-judkins/\">Quinshon Judkins</a> is the first <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/CLE/cleveland-browns/\">Browns</a> rookie with a rushing touchdown in back-to-back games since <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/2131579/nick-chubb/\">Nick Chubb</a>. </li><li><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/2139735/deebo-samuel/\">Deebo Samuel</a> has been an amazing addition for the Commanders.
