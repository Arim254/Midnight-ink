That came after a 2024 campaign in which the Rangers, coming off that World Series championship in 2023, finished 78-84 and missed the postseason. In three seasons with Texas, Bochy guided the team to a record of 249-237 and the only World Series championship in franchise history. </p>\n<p>Overall, the 70-year-old Bochy is 2,252-2,266 (.498) in 28 seasons as a manager in Major League Baseball. Those 28 years in the dugout also include long stints with the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/teams/SD/san-diego-padres/\">San Diego Padres</a> and <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/teams/SF/san-francisco-giants/\">San Francisco Giants</a>. Prior to winning the World Series with Texas, Bochy guided the Giants to a trio of titles in 2010, 2012, and 2014. As a four-time winner of the World Series who's also sixth on the all-time wins list, Bochy will almost certainly be elected to the Baseball Hall of Fame for his managerial accomplishments.</p><p>Those same Giants are currently in the market for a manager after <span><a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/news/giants-fire-manager-bob-melvin-san-francisco-wants-change-in-leadership-after-third-place-nl-west-finish/\" target=\"_blank\">firing Bob Melvin</a></span> earlier Monday.</p>\n<p>As for the Rangers, former <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/teams/MIA/miami-marlins/\">Miami Marlins</a> manager Skip Schumaker is <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/news/rangers-hire-ex-marlins-manager-skip-schumaker-to-front-office-role-per-report/\">a current member of the Texas front office</a> and may emerge as a strong internal candidate to replace Bochy. </p>\n            </div>\n    </div>"

However, offensive coordinator continues to try to get the dynamic young running back involved as a receiver, as he's been targeted 23 times in the passing game and has 18 catches for 141 yards. Both of his touchdowns have come as a receiver, so he should have opportunities to score regardless of how the game script pays out on Monday. <strong>The model predicts he scores 0.86 touchdowns on average while the implied scoring probability is 54%</strong>.</p><h2>Courtland Sutton, Broncos (+135, DraftKings)</h2><p>With two touchdowns in the first three weeks of the season, Sutton has now scored 20 times in his last 36 games and he's clearly established himself as Bo Nix's favorite target. He's scored 14 of those touchdowns inside the 20-yard line and seven have been scored inside the 10, so he's also a top priority in the scoring areas. The Cincinnati defense has already yielded six touchdowns on the season and the model predicts that Sutton scores 0.70 touchdowns to outpace his implied scoring probability of 43%.</p><h2>Evan Engram, Broncos (+340, Caesars)</h2><p>Engram was a high-volume option in Jacksonville, where he revived a once promising career, and signed with Denver this offseason. He hasn't been as involved in the Broncos offense but has also been battling a back injury and Bo Nix hasn't quite hit his stride yet. A matchup with a Bengals pass defense that ranks 25th in the NFL might help facilitate that and lead to a bump for Engram. If he plays, <strong>the model projects he finishes with 0.33 touchdowns with odds implying he only scored 23% of the time</strong>.

He is on pace to record career-low marks in receptions, yards and touchdowns.

The team may not be inclined to make massive adjustments to its offensive game plan given its success, but considering Brown has been an integral part of Philadelphia's dominance throughout his career (and that the franchise is paying him to do so), the Eagles have just about every reason to keep him involved.</p>\n<p>\"I always talk to him,\" said Sirianni. \"He's somebody I talk to on a daily basis. I try to reach out to all our guys on a daily basis and won't get into any private conversations that we have with any of the players about any topic. That's a sacred relationship between a head coach and players and we'll always keep that private.\"</p><p>Brown declined to speak in the locker room after Sunday's win but spoke with reporters last week about the inconsistencies of the offense so far this season. </p><p>\"I was saying, 'Let's not continue to hit our head on the wall and see if it's gonna work,'\" Brown said when discussing the offense. \"Let's mix it up and do what we need to do. That's what I mean.\"</p>\n<p>It is not just Brown who is struggling to leave his mark on the offense, either. Superstar running back <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/2185957/saquon-barkley/\">Saquon Barkley</a> has yet to run for more than 88 yards in a game and ranks 42nd out of 48 <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://cbssports.com/nfl/\">NFL</a> ballcarriers in yards per carry at 3.1. Quarterback <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/2240246/jalen-hurts/\">Jalen Hurts</a> did not throw his first touchdown pass until Week 3 and has just one game with more than 152 passing yards.</p><p>\"We have to help him (Barkley) out as well, get the passing game going to help the run game,\" Brown said last week. \"Last year, it was kind of like the opposite. So now we have to do the opposite. We gotta take advantage of what he have.\"</p><p>The confusing offensive output did not stop the Eagles from defeating multiple <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://cbssports.com/nfl/superbowl/\">Super Bowl</a> contenders in the opening quarter of the season. Wins over the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/KC/kansas-city-chiefs/\">Kansas City Chiefs</a> and Tampa Bay Buccaneers headline their 4-0 start.</p>\n            </div>"

The Miami Dolphins host the New York Jets at 7:15 p.m. ET, and the Denver Broncos host the Cincinnati Bengals at 8:15 p.m. ET. Both games have an over/under of 44.5 points, meaning fantasy points could be a bit hard to come by.

As a rookie in 2024, Nix started all 17 games and delivered a solid performance, throwing for 3,775 yards on 376 of 567 attempts with 29 touchdowns and 12 interceptions, while adding 430 rushing yards and four rushing scores.

Instead of sitting at the podium at Fiserv Forum for media day, the two-time MVP dialed in from Greece, where he is quarantining until he's cleared to travel. </p><p>Once the connection between Athens and Milwaukee stabilized, a poorly lit image of Antetokounmpo appeared on the big screen in the interview room. The situation may not have been ideal, but Antetokounmpo was ready and willing to make the best of it. </p><p>Antetokounmpo will attempt to do the same on the court this season with a Bucks team he believes is \"very, very dangerous,\" despite the fact that it features less star power and individual talent than any roster since his early days in the league. Aside from Antetokounmpo, no one on the team has an All-Star appearance. </p><p><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nba/players/1685257/jrue-holiday/\">Jrue Holiday</a>, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nba/players/1992813/khris-middleton/\">Khris Middleton</a> and <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nba/players/1622544/brook-lopez/\">Brook Lopez</a>, stalwarts of the 2021 title team, are all gone, as is <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nba/players/1992810/damian-lillard/\">Damian Lillard</a>, whose short-lived tenure in Milwaukee never lived up to expectations. In the summer, the Bucks waived Lillard, who will not play this season due to a torn Achilles tendon, and stretched the remaining $113 million on his contract over the next five years. </p>\n<p>Using the stretch provision on Lillard's contract means the Bucks will have $22 million in dead money on their books for the next five years, but it also created the cap space this summer to sign <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nba/players/2152935/myles-turner/\">Myles Turner</a> away from their Central Division rivals, the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nba/teams/IND/indiana-pacers/\">Indiana Pacers</a>.  </p><p>The Bucks were only willing to make such a daring move because of Antetokounmpo's continued commitment to the franchise. </p><p>\"I had a great conversation with Giannis back in June out here and he made it clear that he was very committed to Milwaukee,\" Bucks governor Wes Edens said. \"He likes being here, he likes his family being here… Obviously we've had some bad fortune in these last couple years in the playoffs, but there's a lot of positives.\"</p>\n<p>\"If we were really gonna make the most of our opportunity with Giannis, we felt that we needed to do something substantial, and that's what we did,\" Edens continued. \"We're excited about it. These are hard decisions that we have to make, but they are all made with the intention of trying to compete for a championship.\"</p><p>Antetokounmpo claimed that he couldn't recall any such meeting with Edens, but he was pleased with the Bucks' offseason. </p><p>\"We had a great summer, we added some great pieces. Obviously Myles Turner is gonna be huge for us,\" Antetokounmpo said. \"I really believe in this team. I love that we're younger. We're young, we have energy. I think this is a team full of dogs.\" </p>\n<p>The Bucks are younger and more athletic than they have been in years. They want to push the pace, shoot more 3-pointers and ramp up their aggression on the defensive end. As long as Antetokounmpo remains healthy, they're going to be a good team, especially in a weakened Eastern Conference, whose last two champions will be without their best players for a majority, if not all, of the season. </p><p>But can Antetokounmpo, Turner and a bunch of \"dogs\" compete for a title? That seems unlikely. </p><p>Antetokounmpo has said consistently in recent years that he only wants to play for a team that has a chance to win it all, which is why there was a parade of trade rumors throughout the summer. Even as recently as August, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://x.com/GetUpESPN/status/1952358465826857216\">Shams Charania reported</a> that there was nothing \"set in stone\" about Antetokounmpo's future with the Bucks. </p>\n<p>On Monday, Antetokounmpo acknowledged that there was truth to this summer's saga. </p><p>\"Every summer there's truth to every report,\" Antetokounmpo said. \"The same thing I've been saying my whole career: I want to be on a team that allows me and gives me a chance to win a championship and wants to compete at a high level. I think it's a disservice to basketball, to the game, to not want to compete at a high level, to want your season to end in April. It's pretty much the same. </p><p>\"I had the same thoughts last year, I had the same thoughts two years ago, I had the same thoughts five years ago. It's never going to change. I want to be among the best, I want to compete with the best and I want to win another championship. That's it.\"</p>\n<p>Antetokounmpo is under contract with the Bucks through 2026-27, with a player option for 2027-28, and for now, he's still confident he can win in Milwaukee – foolish as that may seem to some. But how long will that remain the case? That's the question the entire league has been asking, and will continue to ask. </p><p>Antetokounmpo's comments Monday, from some 5,000 miles and an ocean away, will do nothing to ease concerns about his long-term future in Milwaukee. But as long as he remains a Buck, he's going to give the team and the city his all. </p><p>\"My confidence is at an all-time high right now,\" Antetokounmpo said. \"I feel really good about myself, I feel really good about the team and I'm excited to be there. I really believe in this team.\" </p>\n            </div>"

    "body": "<div>\n        <p>While most <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://cbssports.com/nba/\">NBA</a> media day press conferences follow a similar script, there was genuine intrigue about what we'd hear from the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nba/teams/LAC/los-angeles-clippers/\">Clippers</a> and most notably <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nba/players/1715792/kawhi-leonard/\">Kawhi Leonard</a>. </p><p>Monday was the first time Leonard answered questions from the media since the bombshell reports of alleged cap circumvention tied to a questionable endorsement deal with the now-bankrupt company Aspiration. Leonard never did anything publicly to endorse Aspiration, which made the $28 million deal he signed with them (and the additional $20 million deal for stock in the company) look extremely fishy. </p><p>Steve Ballmer and the Clippers had financial ties to the company as well, creating further questions that the league is now investigating. While they have issued numerous statements about various reports, Leonard offered his first comments Monday. The star spent the first three minutes of his press conference answering questions about the situation, and here is everything he said. </p><a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nba/news/kawhi-leonard-investigation-what-potential-punishments-could-mean-for-the-clippers-steve-ballmer-and-the-nba/\" target=\"_blank\">\n        <div>\n            <div>\n                <p>Kawhi Leonard investigation: What potential punishments could mean for the Clippers, Steve Ballmer and the NBA</p>\n                <p>\n                    Sam Quinn                </p>\n            </div>\n                            <div>\n    <figure><img alt=\"Kawhi Leonard investigation: What potential punishments could mean for the Clippers, Steve Ballmer and the NBA\" src=\"https://sportshub.cbsistatic.com/i/r/2025/09/24/96b6485a-8cd7-4bb3-bda1-14d2d99b96ad/thumbnail/270x152/e27e174961f9093288b6b0b0daa9c5c7/kawhi-getty-7.png\" /></figure>\n                </div>\n                    </div>\n    </a>\n<p>When asked about if there was any difficulty to dealing with the distraction of the reports and the investigation as the season got started, Leonard quickly shrugged it off. </p>\n<p>\"It's easy for me,\" Leonard said. \"I don't read headlines or do conspiracy theories or anything like that. It's about the season and what we've got ahead of us right now. Tomorrow we'll start camp, and see what we got.\"</p><p>When asked if he had any reaction to the reports or a statement about the situation, Leonard had a brief response. </p><p>\"Um, no. The NBA's gonna do their job. None of us did no wrongdoing. And, yeah, that's it,\" Leonard said. \"We invite the investigations. It's not gonna be a distraction for me or the rest of the team.\"</p>\n<p>Leonard was asked whether he was aware of the details of the contract, what he was supposed to receive from Aspiration and what he was supposed to do for that compensation. </p><p>\"I understand the full contract and the services I had to do,\" Leonard said. \"Like I said, I don't deal with the conspiracies or clickbait analysts or journalism that's going on. So that's what it is.\"</p><p>When pressed on the reports he didn't actually do anything as part of the deal, Leonard shifted the focus to this being an old story for him. </p>\n<p>\"I don't think it's accurate. But, it's old,\" Leonard said. \"This is all new to you guys. The company went bankrupt awhile ago, so, we already knew this was going to happen.\" </p><p>Leonard was then asked if he got paid everything he was owed and said he had not. </p><p>\"Uh, no. But the company went belly up,\" Leonard said. \"It was fraud, as everybody knows. If you want any more questions or details about that company you need to ask the owner or whoever else is involved in the fraud that went on.\" </p>\n<p>He was asked if the reports he was still owed $7 million was accurate, he said he didn't know the exact number but thought it was actually more. </p><p>\"I'm not sure, I gotta look back at the books,\" Leonard said. \"No, it's more than that for sure.\"</p><p>Finally, he was asked if he knew how much he made from that deal, and he couldn't recall.</p>\n<p>\"No, it was like two, three, four years ago,\" Leonard said. </p><p>From that point the conversation shifted to basketball, but it was certainly a fascinating back-and-forth to open his presser, with ESPN's Ramona Shelburne, who did the first sit-down interview with Steve Ballmer after the story broke, asking the questions about the contract details. </p><p>Calling it a conspiracy theory and then confirming many of the details about the contract was interesting, to say the least. Noting he was owed more than the $7 million initially reported is also noteworthy, and the league will undoubtedly look into all of this. </p><p>Leonard echoed the Clippers' line of welcoming the investigation, but we'll find out once that investigation is completed -- which likely won't be for some time -- if Leonard and the Clippers said that for good reason, or if the league sees the situation differently, as most others do from what's been reported.  </p>\n            </div>"

Cincinnati was crushed 48-10 by the Minnesota Vikings last Sunday, while Denver blew a fourth-quarter lead and dropped a 23-20 decision to the Los Angeles Chargers in a key AFC West matchup. The Bengals (2-1), who are tied for first in the AFC North with the Pittsburgh Steelers, are 2-0 against AFC opponents in 2025. The Broncos (1-2), who trail the Chargers by two games, are 1-2 against AFC foes. Jake Browning will start at quarterback for the Bengals in place of Joe Burrow (toe), who is out for multiple months. Cincinnati tight end Noah Fant (concussion) has been ruled out.</p><p>Kickoff from Empower Field at Mile High in Denver is set for 8:15 p.m. ET. Denver leads the all-time series 22-12, but Cincinnati earned a 30-24 win in overtime last year.

    "body": "<div>\n        <p>After spending more than a year in retirement, Darren Waller finally returned to the NFL on Monday night and he made a huge splash. In his first game with the Miami Dolphins, Waller came out and caught two touchdown passes against the New York Jets. </p><p>Waller's first score of the game came on a four-yard pass from Tua Tagovailoa that gave the Dolphins an early 10-0 lead. </p>\n<p>Waller then followed that up in the third quarter with a nine-yard touchdown reception that put the Dolphins up 17-3. </p>\n<p>The tight end caught a total of three passes for 27 yards through the first three quarters. </p>\n<p>The Dolphins' new star is having a productive night that didn't even seem possible just six months ago. </p><p>Waller's appearance on Monday night came 631 days after he played in his last NFL game, which came with the New York Giants during Week 18 of the 2023 season. Five months after that game was played, Waller <span><a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/news/darren-waller-retires-former-pro-bowl-te-hangs-up-cleats-after-lone-season-with-giants-eight-year-nfl-career/\" target=\"_blank\">announced that he had decided to retire</a></span> at the age of 31. </p><p>The former Pro Bowler ended up sitting out the entire 2024 season and it didn't look like he was going to return to football, but then a funny thing happened: The Giants decided to trade him. Waller agreed to come out of retirement as part of the July 1 trade, which saw the Giants send the tight end to Miami in <span><a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/news/darren-waller-trade-tight-end-to-come-out-of-retirement-as-giants-send-former-pro-bowler-to-dolphins/\" target=\"_blank\">exchange for a 2026 sixth-round pick</a></span>. </p>\n<p>The Dolphins' didn't <a href=\"https://www.nfl.com/news/dolphins-te-darren-waller-still-knocking-some-rust-off-as-week-1-approaches\" target=\"_blank\">activate Waller until late August</a> and after that happened, it took his body to re-acclimate to the NFL. </p><p>\"You can't always predict how your body will respond from having time away,\" Waller said in late August. \"Mostly, it's just my body responding well and, in some ways, it didn't, so it was just like being cautious in that way to, I guess, look at the bigger picture as opposed to maybe rushing in to get ready for the very beginning.\"</p><p>During the first three weeks of the season, Waller wasn't on the field. He was listed inactive for each game while dealing with a hip injury. On Monday night, he was finally ready to make his debut. </p>\n<p>The Dolphins are certainly a team where a tight end can have some success. During the 2024 season, Jonnu Smith led the team in receptions (88) and receiving touchdowns (8) while finishing second in receiving yards (884). After Smith <span><a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/news/steelers-acquire-jonnu-smith-from-dolphins-why-he-helps-aaron-rodgers-as-do-it-all-weapon/\" target=\"_blank\">got traded to the Steelers</a></span> on June 30, the Dolphins went out an acquired Waller just one day later. </p><p>Waller finished with over 1,000 yards receiving in both 2019 and 2020 while playing for the Raiders and even made the Pro Bowl in 2020. In 2023, he finished with 552 receiving yards despite playing for a Giants offense that simply wasn't very good. </p><p>In Miami, he'll have a chance to put up some big numbers and he's already off to a hot start. </p>\n            </div>"

You have sports, but how sports correlates to science and education and learning and how if we merge these worlds that you can have a real impact on the next generation.\"</p><p>Brown hosted Nye, 69, at the Auerbach Center and even did some science experiments with Nye <a href=\"https://www.twitch.tv/fchwpo\" target=\"_blank\">on a livestream on Twitch</a>. Just last week, Brown flew to Los Angeles to speak about Nye when Nye received his star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame.</p><p>\"The guy flew out to LA just to say a few words,\" Nye said Monday. \"He's got a life to life. He's very wealthy. He doesn't need to do that. But he was very gracious. Of course, he's charming. Everybody was delighted to see him. ... I get choked up. He flew across the country to just say a few words at this Walk of Fame thing. It was really remarkable.\"</p>\n<p>Nye was an important figure for multiple generations of students due to his role as \"Bill Nye the Science Guy.\" Nye hosted a popular science-based television show that aired from 1993-97, and schools all around the United States played his show for science students. </p><p>Brown was among those students that had plenty of exposure to Nye's programming when he was growing up in the Atlanta suburbs in the 2010s. The two met at a <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nba/teams/WAS/washington-wizards/\">Washington Wizards</a> vs. Celtics game last season and were able to strike up a friendship. </p>\n<p>Brown is slated to begin his 10th season as a member of the Celtics.

These divisional rivals are both winless on the season, and only one team in league history has ever made the postseason after an 0-4 start.

That includes four straight Miami defeats at home in primetime, and the team has lost five of its last six MNF appearances overall. Also, the mini-bye that Miami is coming off after playing last Thursday doesn't appear to help their chances of covering as the Dolphins are 0-4 against the spread with a rest advantage since the start of 2024.</p><p>The Jets have a potent running attack with a number of talented backs, plus mobility with the quarterback position with Justin Fields cleared from the concussion protocol. The team entered Week 4 ranking in the top 10 in both rushing yards per game and rushing scores, despite <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/3123469/breece-hall/\">Breece Hall</a> yet to find the end zone in 2025. Than run game should undoubtedly get boosted by the pass game, as that's what Miami's defense tends to do for opponents. The Dolphins are first team since the merger to allow nine total touchdowns and zero turnovers to their opposing starting quarterbacks in each of the team's first three games. <a href=\"https://www.sportsline.com/insiders/jets-vs-dolphins-prediction-line-odds-proven-model-releases-spread-pick-for-2025-nfl-week-4-monday-night-football/#ttag=09282025_agg_cbssports_picks_football_nfl_model_JetsDolphinsMNF\" target=\"_blank\">See which team to back at SportsLine</a>. </p><h2>Why the Dolphins can cover</h2><p>Playing at home has certainly been an advantage for the Dolphins in this series as they've won nine straight home matchups with the Jets. All of them have been by more than the spread of 2.5 points as the Dolphins have a 10.4-point average margin of victory during this run. Additionally, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/2741209/tua-tagovailoa/\">Tua Tagovailoa</a> has had success versus his divisional rival no matter where the games have taken place as the quarterback is undefeated in five starts against the Jets, including averaging 277.5 passing yards, a 76% completion rate and a 3:0 TD:INT over his last two versus New York.</p><p>The Dolphins offense has come to life after an eight-point Week 1, particularly the run game, as the team rushed for 130 yards last week versus Buffalo. Miami is averaging 5.4 yards per carry on the year, which ranks fourth in the NFL, while the team ranks No. 1 in third-down conversion percentage and fourth in redzone scoring. That offense can take advantage of deficiencies with the Jets defense, as New York hasn't had a takeaway, ranks in the bottom 10 in run defense and is in the bottom five in scoring defense. <a href=\"https://www.sportsline.com/insiders/jets-vs-dolphins-prediction-line-odds-proven-model-releases-spread-pick-for-2025-nfl-week-4-monday-night-football/#ttag=09282025_agg_cbssports_picks_football_nfl_model_JetsDolphinsMNF\" target=\"_blank\">See which team to back at SportsLine</a>. </p><p><em>Check out the latest </em><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/betting/news/betmgm-promo-code/\"><em>BetMGM promo code</em></a><em> CBSSPORTS, where new users can </em><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://martech.cbssports.com/bt/redirect/prod?b=betmgm&c=sport\"><em>get up to $1,500 in bonus bets if your first bet loses</em></a><em>.</em></p><h2>How to make Jets vs. Dolphins picks</h2><p>For this NFL Week 4 Monday Night Football game of Dolphins vs. Jets, the model is leaning over the total, projecting 50 combined points.

Williams ranks fifth in the entire <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://cbssports.com/nfl/\">NFL</a> in rushing yards (312), tied for second in rushing touchdowns (four) and eighth in yards per carry (5.0, minimum 35 carries). </p><p>Williams is clearly the Cowboys' bell cow back, especially after going for 85 yards and a touchdown on a season-high 20 carries in Dallas' 40-40 tie against the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/GB/green-bay-packers/\">Green Bay Packers</a> on \"Sunday Night Football\" in Week 4.
