These two teams combined to score 93 points in their two respective matchups, with the Ravens knocking off the Browns, 41-17, and the Lions defeating the Bears, 52-21, in Week 2. The Ravens enter Monday Night Football with the top-scoring offense, averaging 40.5 ppg, this season. Lamar Jackson threw for 357 yards and three touchdowns and rushed for a score when these two teams last met in 2023. The model projects 54 combined points on Monday Night Football.</p><h2>Brewers vs. Padres Over 7 total runs (-118)</h2><p>Both teams are starting quality pitchers on Monday, but seven runs is about as low an over/under as you'll ever find on a baseball game. The Padres are starting Nick Pivetta, who is 13-5 with a 2.81 ERA on the season, but the 32-year-old allowed three runs in just 4 2/3 innings against the Mets on Wednesday. Meanwhile, the Padres are still playing meaningful baseball, as they have a shot to overtake the Dodgers atop the NL West, so they should come out aggressively. The Brewers are starting Freddy Peralta, who, although he hasn't allowed a run in five of his last seven starts, recently allowed five runs in five innings against the Rangers on Sept. 10. The model projects the Over to hit in 64% of simulations.</p><h2>Giants (-149) to defeat the Cardinals</h2><p>The Giants are coming off a 3-1 win over the Dodgers on Sunday to snap a three-game losing streak, and although neither the Giants nor the Cardinals are playing for the postseason, they are still playing out their seasons with the majority of starters. Giants pitcher Justin Verlander recently said he wants to pitch in 2026, but there's no guarantee of that, so Monday could be the final start for the Hall of Fame pitcher. Verlander has allowed just one run over his last four starts at age 42, and he has a 3.75 ERA as he still remains one of the most reliable pitchers in baseball. The model projects the Giants to win in 66% of simulations.</p><h2>Want more NFL picks and MLB picks for Monday, September 22?</h2><p><strong>You've seen the model's Monday best bets.

The Lions are fourth in the NFL in total offense (378.5) and fourth in scoring offense. In the Week 2 win over the Bears, they recorded 52 points and a franchise record 511 total yards of offense. They should have success against this Ravens defense that is last in the league in total defense (409.5). Offensively, Baltimore is a heavyweight. They are fifth in rushing offense (141.5) and first in scoring offense (40.5). SportsLine's model predicts that these teams combine for 55 total points.</p><h2>Amon Ra St. Brown Over 71.5 receiving yards</h2><p>Baltimore's secondary has its fair share of trouble, as they are 32nd in pass defense (298.5) with 6.5 yards per completion. Meanwhile, St. Brown is coming off a Week 2 performance where he had nine catches for 111 yards and three touchdowns. The USC product has gone over 71.5 receiving yards in three of the last four games when the line was set at that number. SportsLine's Machine Learning Model projects that St. Brown finishes with 88 receiving yards in this outing.</p><h2>Lamar Jackson Over 42.5 rushing yards </h2><p>Lamar Jackson is known for his dual-threat abilities and has 83 rushing yards on the season. With Derrick Henry in the backfield, it also creates more rushing lanes for Jackson, who has gone over 42.5 rushing yards in six of his last 10 games when that is his rushing line. Caleb Williams had 27 on five carries (5.4 yards per carry) against Detroit last week, and look for the Louisville product to take advantage of his legs. SportsLine's model predicts that Jackson will finish with 45 rushing yards in this primetime contest. </p><h2>Want more Monday picks?</h2><p><strong>You've seen the model's Monday best bets.

The Lions racked up 52 points in their win over Chicago last week, finishing with 511 total yards. Quarterback Jared Goff threw for five touchdowns, and he is facing a Baltimore defense that allowed 41 points to Buffalo in its opener. Lions edge rusher Aidan Hutchinson already has a sack two games into his return from a knee injury, so he could be a key player to watch on Monday. The model has Detroit covering the spread in 52% of simulations. </p><p><strong>More NFL best bets</strong></p><ul><li><a href=\"https://www.sportsline.com/nfl/picks/\" target=\"_blank\">Ravens vs. Lions simulated 10,000 times</a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.sportsline.com/experts/13773/larry-hartstein/?league=nfl\" target=\"_blank\">NFL expert locks in player prop pick for MNF </a> </li></ul><h2>Monday MLB best bets</h2><ul><li><strong>Game: Atlanta Braves vs. Washington Nationals (Monday, 7:15 p.m. ET)</strong></li><li><strong>The Pick: Nationals +1.5 runs (-105)</strong></li></ul><p>Washington and Atlanta are both wrapping up their respective seasons this week, as neither of them will be in the playoffs. The Nationals won the last two games of their three-game series against the Mets over the weekend, putting New York's postseason hopes in jeopardy. The Braves swept a four-game series between these teams in Washington last week, but they split their first six meetings of the campaign. Monday's starting pitching matchup between Braves starter Chris Sale and Nationals starter MacKenzie Gore is a rematch of the second game of last Tuesday's doubleheader, which went nine scoreless innings before the Braves broke through in the tenth inning. The model expects another close game on Monday, with the Nationals covering the spread (+1.5) in 58% of simulations. </p><ul><li><strong>Game: San Diego Padres vs. Milwaukee Brewers (Monday, 9:40 p.m. ET)</strong></li><li><strong>The Pick: Over 7 runs (-115)</strong></li></ul><p>San Diego's magic number for clinching a postseason spot is just two games, while Milwaukee leads Philadelphia by three games for the National League's best record. The Padres are expected to have veteran shortstop Xander Bogaerts in the lineup after being idle since Aug. 27 when he fractured his left foot after fouling off a pitch in Seattle. These have been two of the best offensive teams in the MLB this season, with the Brewers ranked second in batting average and the Padres not far behind at seventh. The model has them scoring 9.2 total runs on Monday, with the Over cashing in 64% of simulations.   </p><p><strong>More MLB best bets</strong></p><ul><li><a

Baltimore responded with a 41-17 win over the Browns in Week 2, and they are the only team in the league to score at least 40 points in both weeks. The Ravens lead the NFL in scoring (40.5 points per game) as Lamar Jackson is completing 68.8% of his passes for 434 yards and six touchdowns, compared to zero interceptions. Derrick Henry rushed for 169 yards and two touchdowns against the Bills, and the Ravens didn't need him to contribute much against the Browns. The Ravens have won five straight games against Detroit, including a 38-6 final behind Jackson's 357 passing yards and three touchdowns in the 2023 season, and the model projects the Ravens to cover in 50% of simulations. </p><h3>Over 53.5 total points</h3><p>The Lions and Ravens were the two highest-scoring teams in the league last week, combining for 93 points, and their elite offenses are capable of production like that any week. Detroit is coming off a 52-21 victory over the Bears, and the Ravens defeated the Browns, 41-17, with both games going Over their over/under totals. The Ravens have gone Over in each game this season, and they also did in three of their final four regular-season contests last year. The Lions went Over in four of their final five regular-season games last year and have split their over/under totals through two contests. Last season, the Lions led the NFL in scoring at 33.1 ppg, and they proved last week against Ben Johnson that they can still post elite offensive numbers without him calling the plays. The model projects the Over to hit in 54% of simulations. </p><h3>Responsible gaming</h3><p>Responsible gaming is important, and all sportsbooks take steps to ensure users are responsible bettors. The top sportsbooks offer tools and resources on their apps and websites, including wager limits, voluntary self-exclusion options, and more.

(The 35-year-old future Hall of Famer will miss the entire season, having torn his Achilles tendon five months ago.) The second-biggest splash was drafting <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nba/players/29727924/yang-hansen/\">Yang Hansen</a>, who is eminently quotable (\"Yao [Ming] is number one in paradise. Compared to him, I'm cold ash in a pot,\" <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/2025/07/20/yang-hansen-trail-blazers-nba/\">Yang told the Washington Post</a>) but needs time the way that most 20-year-old centers do. On draft night, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://youtu.be/8rpGn3b9z44?si=_djze-yzB3wVuMxn&t=796\">Cronin clarified</a> what he wants to see: while the team could \"possibly\" make a playoff run, his expectation is that it improves over the course of the season, not that it hits any particular benchmark. In other words, the P-word that is important in Portland is \"progress.\"</p><h2>The State of Play</h2><p><strong>Last year:</strong> At the halfway mark, the 2024-25 Blazers were 13-28 and on a five-game losing streak, with the second-worst net rating (and third-worst defense) in the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://cbssports.com/nba/\">NBA</a>. It seemed like Chauncey Billups' days as their coach were numbered, but, on the strength of an aggressive defense that forced tons of turnovers, they won 10 of their next 11 games and, after finishing the season 36-46, they signed Billups to a contract extension. <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nba/players/3149254/deni-avdija/\">Deni Avdija</a> averaged 23.3 points (on 51-42-78 shooting splits), 9.7 rebounds and 5.2 assists in 33.6 minutes in the 20 games that he played after the All-Star break. <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nba/players/3141429/toumani-camara/\">Toumani Camara</a>, the second-round pick acquired when they traded Lillard away, made the All-Defensive Second Team.</p><p><strong>The offseason</strong>: The Blazers initially agreed to give up two second-round picks in the Simons-Holiday swap, but it <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nba/news/jrue-holiday-trade-revised-as-celtics-wont-get-draft-picks-from-blazers-after-reported-review-of-medicals/\">turned into a one-for-one deal</a> after they looked at Holiday's medicals. They went into the draft with the No. 11 pick, but picked up a future first and two seconds by trading down to No. 16. This was still much higher than anybody projected Yang to go, and it elicited comparisons to the shocking selections of Georgios Papagiannis (at No. 13 in 2016) and <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nba/players/2135521/bruno-caboclo/\">Bruno Caboclo</a> (at No. 20 in 2014). Aside from Simons, Portland did not trade any of the players who were rumored to be available, but the team saved about $10 million in the Ayton buyout. By returning to Portland on the midlevel exception, Lillard <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nba/news/how-damian-lillard-just-won-the-offseason-by-returning-to-the-trail-blazers/\">won the offseason</a>.  </p>\n<p><strong>Las Vegas over/under: </strong>34.5, per <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/betting/news/betmgm-promo-code/\">BetMGM</a></p><h2>The Conversation</h2><p><strong>Blazers believer:</strong> There is only one place to start this discussion: Vegas, baby! I don't understand how anyone could watch Yang Hansen's summer league highlights and not buy his jersey immediately afterward. Some people laughed at the Blazers for their \"reach\" on draft night, but it's obvious why <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://x.com/JakeLFischer/status/1938057593957847203\">that Nuggets scout called him \"Chinese Jokic.\"</a> You just don't find 7-foot-1 guys who pass the ball like this, let alone ones who can score in the post and step out to the 3-point line. I love his personality, too, and his massive popularity in China won't hurt. Even if it takes him some time to adjust to the NBA game, Yang's mere presence will be a huge positive for Portland. Between him and Dame, the Blazers have upgraded their vibes immeasurably.</p>\n<p><strong>Blazers skeptic: </strong>I haven't bought the jersey, but I admit Yang is easy to root for. Which is why I don't take any pleasure in pointing out that he had a 1:1 assist-to-turnover ratio at summer league. The \"Chinese Jokic\" thing is amusing, but it's also extremely unfair! Had he been selected in the middle of the second round, merely lasting in the league as a third big would have been an awesome outcome. Now he might be seen as a bust if he's a backup, and it really does feel like a reach to bet on him eventually being strong enough, mobile enough and a good enough shooter to be more than that. But enough about Yang. I would like to ask you about three (much) older players: What is Jrue Holiday doing here, exactly? Why, beyond \"vibes,\" is an injured Damian Lilllard a good use of the midlevel exception? And why is <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nba/players/2135533/jerami-grant/\">Jerami Grant</a> still on the roster?</p><p><strong>Blazers believer: </strong>Are these supposed to be hard questions? Holiday is here because he embodies everything the team wants to be about. He's tough, he's unselfish, he wins wherever he goes and he will make the Blazers' backcourt of the future better. All it cost to get him was Anfernee Simons, a talented but defensively deficient player who had been on the trade block forever and was heading into a contract year. Lillard is a good use of the midlevel primarily because he'll be an incredible bargain when he returns to the court in 2026-27. You're crazy if you think he won't help <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nba/players/29005041/scoot-henderson/\">Scoot Henderson</a> and <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nba/players/26893318/shaedon-sharpe/\">Shaedon Sharpe</a> develop, and you're blind if you can't see how much he means to Portland. As for Grant, it's entirely because of his contract. He's still owed $102.6 million over the next three years, and, with so many teams treating the second apron like a hard cap, there weren't any appealing trades out there. I suppose it'll be a little strange if/when he's coming off the bench so that Deni Avdija and Toumani Camara can start at the forward spots, but there are much worse problems to have.</p>\n<p><strong>Blazers skeptic: </strong>I brought up the vets because I'm not sure what the Blazers are trying to do anymore. Are they still in development mode? Are they trying to make a playoff push? To me, Grant's continued presence is a reflection of a more general confusion in Portland. He is a relic of the Lillard era, but, weirdly, Lillard is (kind of) back. And while moving Simons and going after a player with Holiday's skill set both make some sense, the swap would have been a lot more logical if the two were on similar contracts. Amending the trade was technically good for Portland, but it definitely didn't make me feel better about the fact that Holiday's efficiency declined last season. He wasn't consistently the same all-world guy on defense, either, and the Blazers now owe him $104 million over the next three years, in addition to what they're paying Grant and Lillard. Even if Holiday and Lillard both bounce back, I find it hard to believe that investing in them is an optimal use of resources for an ostensibly rebuilding team. And if they don't bounce back, it'll be a catastrophe. </p><p><strong>Blazers believer:</strong> Optimal, shmoptimal. You need to relax. The Blazers still have plenty of flexibility, and they haven't even started getting the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nba/teams/MIL/milwaukee-bucks/\">Bucks</a>' draft capital from the Lillard trade yet. Cap space isn't what it used to be, so I don't know why you're freaking out about any of this, especially the no-brainer decision to bring back the best Blazer ever for chump change. Who would you have signed with the midlevel instead? <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nba/players/2019069/caris-levert/\">Caris LeVert</a>? <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nba/players/2105183/luke-kornet/\">Luke Kornet</a>? Please. When Henderson and Sharpe break out, Avdija makes his first All-Star Game and <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nba/players/28953860/donovan-clingan/\">Donovan Clingan</a> joins Camara on an All-Defensive Team, I'm sure you'll claim that it's all proof that Portland shouldn't have bothered adding veterans. And I'm sure everyone around the team will say that the vets played vital roles in making the plan come together.</p><p><strong>Blazers skeptic: </strong>At least LeVert and Kornet are in their <em>early</em> 30s. But no. If I were in Joe Cronin's shoes, I would have only used the MLE on a veteran in the way that the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nba/teams/UTA/utah-jazz/\">Jazz</a> did -- they absorbed <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nba/players/2135515/kyle-anderson/\">Kyle Anderson</a> into their MLE to facilitate the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nba/players/1905196/norman-powell/\">Norman Powell</a> trade, picking up a second-round pick in the process. Alternatively, if Portland really wanted another guard to stabilize the offense, it could have gone after <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nba/players/2268642/ty-jerome/\">Ty Jerome</a>, who signed with Memphis for the room exception and is seven years younger than Holiday. If Henderson, Sharpe, Avdija and Clingan do as you predicted, though, I promise I won't criticize the Blazers' offseason at all. The whole reason I'm frustrated with them is that the young guys should have had to accomplish more before the front office started acting like anything other than a normal rebuilding team. I want to see Henderson force teams to stop going under. I want Sharpe to knock down his spot-up 3s, draw more fouls and use his athletic gifts on defense. I want Clingan to show that he can handle more minutes and be at least a little bit of a threat on offense. And I want to know exactly how far Avdija can go as a creator. I don't like the fact that, with Holiday and Grant in the mix, I'm not even sure that all of them will start.</p>\n            </div>"

The Buckeyes are coming off a bye, and the team was a little lackluster in 2024 following its early bye weeks. OSU failed to cover in either contest following its two regular season byes last year, including narrowly beating Nebraska by four points, despite being favored by 25.5 points. As for the Huskies, they're also 3-0 on the season and coming off a 35-point road victory in a rivalry game with Washington State. Washington's 55.7 points per game are second-most in FBS as it should be able to stick with an Ohio State team that's allowing over 100 rushing yards per game, despite facing just one Power 4 team. The model has Washington covering nearly 60% of the time. <a href=\"https://www.sportsline.com/insiders/college-football-odds-lines-spreads-picks-predictions-betting-advice-for-week-5-2025-from-proven-model/#ttag=09222025_agg_cbssports_picks_football_ncaa_model_Week5collegefootballodds\" target=\"_blank\">See which other picks the model likes here</a>.</p><p>Another prediction: No. 9 Texas A&M (-6.5, 52.5) covers against Auburn over 50% of the time at Saturday at 3:30 p.m. ET. Auburn fell out of the Top 25 following its defeat to Oklahoma, while the Aggies had a bye last Saturday, following their upset of then-No. 8 Notre Dame. The Tigers struggled containing QB John Mateer of OU, as he had 300 total yards, with touchdowns both thru the air on the ground, so Auburn should equally struggle with A&M's Marcel Reed. The quarterback has a 9:1 TD:INT and is averaging nearly 50 rushing yards per game. Add in that just two teams in the nation have allowed more sacks than Auburn, and just 10 FBS teams average more penalties, and the Tigers have several issues that A&M can exploit. SportsLine's model also predicts the Over hitting more than 50% of the time. <a href=\"https://www.sportsline.com/insiders/college-football-odds-lines-spreads-picks-predictions-betting-advice-for-week-5-2025-from-proven-model/#ttag=09222025_agg_cbssports_picks_football_ncaa_model_Week5collegefootballodds\" target=\"_blank\">See the rest of the model's picks here</a>.</p><h2>How to make college football picks for Week 5</h2><p>The model has also made the call on who wins and covers in every FBS matchup in Week 5, and it's calling for multiple upsets, including a shocking result in a ranked matchup. <a href=\"https://www.sportsline.com/insiders/college-football-odds-lines-spreads-picks-predictions-betting-advice-for-week-5-2025-from-proven-model/#ttag=09222025_agg_cbssports_picks_football_ncaa_model_Week5collegefootballodds\" target=\"_blank\">You can only get every pick for every game at SportsLine</a>, <strong>and for a limited time you can use promo code CHAMPIONSHIP to get your first month at SportsLine for $1.</strong></p><p><strong>So what college football picks can you make with confidence, and which underdogs win outright?

We got another example of that on Sunday night when <span><a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/news/look-chiefs-andy-reid-bumps-travis-kelce-during-heated-moment-vs-giants/\" target=\"_blank\">Travis Kelce and Andy Reid got into it in the first half</a></span>, with Reid and Kelce going chest-to-chest and bumping each other. </p><p>After the win, Reid shrugged off questions about the incident, first joking that Kelce is an \"emotional guy, he's Irish\" before explaining he loves Kelce's passion and sometimes he's just got to be the one reining it in. </p><p>\"I love Travis's passion, so I'm OK with that,\" Reid said. \"We didn't have enough of it that second quarter. It wasn't where we needed to be. So within reason, he knows. He knows when to back off the pedal and he knows when to push it, too. That's the part I love about him. I mean, the guy's all in. Just sometimes I have to be the policeman.</p>\n<p>\"He's a passionate guy, and I love that part,\" Reid added. \"I've been through a lot of things with him, so that's all part of it. I love that he loves to play the game, that's what I love. And it's an emotional game, so I'll take it.\"</p><p>It's not the first time Kelce and Reid have had a run-in on the sideline; the two famously got into it on the sidelines of the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://cbssports.com/nfl/superbowl/\">Super Bowl</a> two years ago against the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/SF/san-francisco-49ers/\">49ers</a>. They won that game and were able to laugh about it afterwards as well, and as long as the end result is a win, they'll be able to pull positives from those kinds of moments. </p>\n<p>That being said, it has certainly seemed like frustration has been at an all-time high on the Chiefs sideline to start this season, and while they had enough to beat the Giants on Sunday, there is plenty still to improve if they want to have a chance at another Super Bowl run. </p>\n            </div>"

    "description": "The Inside the Lines team has powered CBS Fantasy Projections for well over a decade and has identified the top waiver wire pickups heading into Week 4 based on the players with the highest projected rest of season position ranking (PPR) but rostered in under 70% of leagues.",
    "body": "<div>\n<p>The SportsLine Projection Model was developed and powered by the Inside the Lines team. You can find all of our team's picks and content at <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/betting/news/inside-the-lines-todays-best-bets-mlb-baseball-homerun-sec-bigten-acc-college-football-futures-fantasy-july-24-2025/live/\" target=\"_blank\">our blog</a>, which has all our personal best bets for free. Over two decades, we have reverse engineered oddsmakers' models, which has resulted in 85-90% of our projections being virtually identical to the oddsmaker's lines. </p><p>When you can pick the spread and totals well, you can predict completions, yards, touchdowns well. Our first <span><a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/betting/news/inside-the-lines-fantasy-football-top-10-waiver-wire-pickups-daniel-jones-quentin-johnston-among-top-names/\" target=\"_blank\">waiver wire report</a></span> had some clear HITS (Daniel Jones, Wan'Dale Robinson, and Quentin Johnston). We also recommended Calvin Austin, Hunter Henry, and Brenton Strange two weeks ago.</p><h3>Players To Target</h3><p>While several players below are not weekly starters they are player I'd grab for the bench over a number of players rostered at their same position at considerably higher percentages.</p><p><strong>Sam Darnold (26%): </strong>We do not recommend him as your primary starter but his upside is higher than most other QBs ranked in the 20s for the rest of the season. Between what he did last season for Minnesota and his emerging connection with rookie Tory Horton he has 4 trusted weapons (JSN, Cooper Kupp, Horton, RB Zach Charbonnet when healthy). His value is boosted if your league only subtracts 1 point per interception instead of two. Darnold has not had a rush attempt in his last two games and rookie QB Jalen Milroe is clearly the better option in a clear QB rushing situation, but at a certain point Darnold will start scrambling to avoid pressure and this aspect also gives him a leg up over the older QBs like Matt Stafford and Aaron Rodgers.</p><p><strong>Jeremy McNichols (9%): </strong>His 60+ yard rushing touchdown vs the Raiders looked like his opponent, Ashton Jeanty, playing vs Mountain West Conference defenders. The Commanders clearly are not going to have a workhorse RB this season and instead will likely give the ball to the hot hand. McNichols has a very high ceiling in this offense. He's had short big \"fantasy bursts\" in his past and if/when 'Bill' or Chris Rodriguez were to get hurt McNichols could find himself in the Austin Ekeler role for a few weeks and he'd be a very good streaming option. Last season he had back-to-back games of 19.4 and 10.4 FPs. </p><p><strong>Rico Dowdle (25%): </strong>The Panthers had the best win / game in the Bryce Young era and it wasn't a coincidence that Rico Dowdle played significant snaps (10 rush, 30 yards, 1 rushtd) after he only had 9 rushes and 21 yards in the first two weeks combined. Chuba Hubbard still had 17 carries (73 yards) but no one thought of Chuba Hubbard as a Derrick Henry workhorse. I think the pair will settle into a nice 60/40 split at RB and Dowdle will carve out a 10 touch, 50 yard, 20% TD chance role for a rapidly improving Panthers offense. Dowdle is RB 47 the rest of the season based on the projection but his upside is higher than RB2s projected for more 'floor points' like Justice Hill, Ollie Gordon, or Rachaad White.</p><p><strong>Calvin Austin III (44%):</strong> Roman Wilson was a high 2nd round pick in '24 but has 2 targets and 1 rec in his career. There is so little 'trusted' depth at WR that Austin's costly tipped INT in Week 2 didn't stop Aaron Rodgers from targeting him for a key TD in Week 3. DK Metcalf is going to get a ton of attention from the defense and Calvin Austin may be able to fit into one of Metcalf's calves but as WR2 in a 2 WR offense Austin is at least a great FLEX player for the season. </p><p><strong>Tre Tucker (11%): </strong>He had a monster Week 3 with 8 rec, 145 yards and 3 TDs. I'm sure he'll be on everyone's waiver wire list. He was showing signs of a breakout last season despite the disastrous QB situation he had. TE Brock Bowers is playing through injuries and injury prone TE Michael Mayer was knocked out of Week 3. Many thought the Raiders would rely on more two TE sets and Ashton Jeanty would be a workhorse but neither assumption seems to be the case. Tucker is arguably TE1 already for the Raiders with Jakobi Meyers becoming WR2.</p><p><strong>Hunter Henry (60%): </strong>He also had a monster Week 3 with 8 receptions, 90 yards and 2 TDs. He had 8 targets in Week 1 and 11 targets in Week 3. These were the two games where Drake Maye faced elite pass rushers (Maxx Crosby, TJ Watt). The 'ghost of Stefon Diggs' is not just on the back 9, he's probably at the 18th hole and near the end. Kayshon Boutte and Mack Hollins are WR2 and 3. Long story short, this is a team that will be targeting TEs (Henry and Austin Hooper) plenty. Henry's % of team receiving production are elite (18% of rec, 20% of recyd, 27% of recTD) and he is a must start TE with a high floor and ceiling.</p><p><strong>Brenton Strange</strong> <strong>(44%): </strong>With a lot of the aging TE stars in rapid decline we identified Strange as a top waiver wire target two weeks ago and as a great draft value in the summer. He has not found the end zone in nearly a full calendar year but with 60, 59, and 61 yards in 3 of his last 4 games he's somewhat due for a score. He has caught 17 of his last 20 targets which is impressive considering Trevor Lawrence is not always on target. While he's just TE17 in our rest of season projections we're almost in bye season time and Strange will be a top streaming option.</p><h3>Visit Our Free Picks Blog</h3><p>Remember, for all of our best bets, you can get them for free on our <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/betting/news/cfb-nfl-college-football-week-1-mlb-best-home-run-bets-baseball-picks-golf-bets-inside-the-lines-august-25/live/\" target=\"_blank\">new blog</a>.

Something was missing from the formation. Something obvious.</p><p>In the week prior against the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/KC/kansas-city-chiefs/\">Kansas City Chiefs</a>, Davis and teammate <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/3163950/jalen-carter/\">Jalen Carter</a> were not lined up next to each other on field goal formations. That had to change.</p><p>\"We just wanna make sure we was both together,\" Davis said. \"We both have a good push when we're together.\"</p><p>Davis caught that in the film room during the week and requested that he and Carter line up next to each other -- just like how the duo is when it is terrorizing offensive lines on a weekly basis. </p>\n<p>In a way, Davis made the heroics happen. Almost like he won the game before it was played. </p><p>\"We wanted to make sure we were side by side on the line in order to get through there,\" Davis said. \"We needed to get our hands up, too. That was the most important thing. So many people push the pile and don't get their hands up. </p><p>\"When you got a guy that's 6-4 and another one that's 6-6, when we both push the pile and get our hands up, it's a dangerous combination.\"</p>\n<p>The <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/LAR/los-angeles-rams/\">Los Angeles Rams</a> certainly found out the dangers of Davis and Carter being lined up next to each other on the field goal unit. The two were responsible for the Eagles' 33-26 comeback victory in what was one of the widest games in the winning history of Lincoln Financial Field, blocking two <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/3163734/joshua-karty/\">Joshua Karty</a> field goals in the fourth quarter of a 19-point comeback. </p><p>Carter was the first to get a piece of Karty's kicks, blocking a 36-yard field goal that would have put the Rams up, 29-21, with 8:46 remaining. The left side of the Rams unit was exposed when <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/2180628/arden-key/\">Arden Key</a> of the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/TEN/tennessee-titans/\">Tennessee Titans</a> blocked Karty's extra point last week.</p>\n<p>The Rams made an adjustment this week by placing starting right guard <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/2188161/kevin-dotson/\">Kevin Dotson</a> on that side. The Eagles countered with Davis and Carter lined up next to each other, deciding to target Dotson in order to penetrate the wall. </p>\n<p>Carter pushed Dotson back and got his arm up, batting Karty's low ball to keep the Eagles' deficit at five. Teams are fortunate to block one kick in a game, yet alone one with a short distance of 36 yards.</p><p>The Eagles did so because of what Davis saw heading into the week. </p><p>\"Film is one thing,\" Davis said. \"But when you actually go out there and you can feel those guys in front of you. And you can see the trajectory of how the kicker is kicking, where he's going, his angle and all that. Everything came into play.\"</p><h2>How the blocked FG unfolded</h2><p>The stage was essentially set for Davis' heroics later in the game, even though it's basically impossible to block two field goals in a  game -- yet alone in one quarter.</p>\n<p>Dotson had to leave the game with cramps in the fourth quarter, forcing the Rams to go back to <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/3121156/beaux-limmer/\">Beaux Limmer</a> in Dotson's spot on the field goal team. Carter smelled the fish in the water, as Eagles assistant special teams coordinator Joe Pannunzio calls it. </p><p>\"We were going through field goal block, who the fish is\" Carter said with a smile. \"What's the best side to rush from, and they had some injuries. ... We took advantage of it.\"</p><p>The Rams got an opportunity to win the game off Karty's leg and prevent the Eagles' furious 19-point comeback. Philadelphia took the lead on <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/2240246/jalen-hurts/\">Jalen Hurts</a>' 4-yard touchdown pass to <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/2866975/devonta-smith/\">DeVonta Smith</a> with 1:48 left, giving Los Angeles an opportunity to get the ball last and score -- leaving Lincoln Financial Field with a victory. </p>\n<p>Los Angeles needed 10 plays and 1:45 to get to the Eagles' 26-yard line. Karty was set up to walk off with a win. All he had to do was get the ball high up in the air. </p><p>But between Karty's launch angle and his blocker (Limmer), Davis smelled blood in the water. Busting through the line, Davis blocked Karty's low kick with his forearm. He then scooped up the ball and rumbled 61 yards for the score in what became one of the most memorable plays in Eagles history. </p><p>\"I was surprised,\" said Eagles safety <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/2961001/sydney-brown/\">Sydney Brown</a>, who was sprinting down the field behind Davis after the blocked kick. \"I was trying to do my part to get the rush in and all I heard was boom boom. I was like, 'Yeah, that's the shit. That's what's up.'\"</p>\n<p>The Eagles were the first <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://cbssports.com/nfl/teams/\">NFL team</a> since at least 1978 to block two field goals in the fourth quarter of a game. This was the first time the Eagles blocked two field goals in a game since Sept. 21, 1975 -- 50 years to the day of Davis' heroics.</p><h2>Heaviest player to return a blocked kick for TD</h2><p>Perhaps even more impressive than the game-winning blocked field goal? Davis sprinting down the field and cruising into the end zone for a touchdown in the Eagles' 33-26 victory. The touchdown found a way into the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://cbssports.com/nfl/\">NFL</a> history books, as Davis (336 pounds) is the heaviest player in NFL history to return a blocked kick 50-plus yards for a touchdown.</p><p>\"I'm so happy for that guy,\" right tackle <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/2180436/fred-johnson/\">Fred Johnson</a> said. \"I'm so happy for his big ass.\"</p>\n<p>Davis reached 18.59 miles per hour on the touchdown run, per NFL Next Gen Stats. This was a product of all the hard work Davis put in during the summer to stay conditioned through four quarters, as weight has been an issue for him since he entered the NFL. </p>\n<p>\"He's put in a lot of hard work this offseason,' running back <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/2185957/saquon-barkley/\">Saquon Barkley</a> said. \"The shape he's in, the way he battled in camp, and has battled this season, you love that. You love when guys put the work in, and they benefit from it.</p><p>\"Maybe he does have a future at running back.\"</p><p>Davis admitted he wouldn't go that far, but also was humbled by the compliment. If Barkley thought he could play running back, then it must have some merit.</p>\n<p>\"I didn't think he could, I knew he could,\" rookie linebacker <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/28875305/jihaad-campbell/\">Jihaad Campbell</a> said when asked if he knew Davis could run that fast. \"He's the fastest DT in the league. I'll tell you that.\" </p><p>Somehow the Eagles knew that blocked kick was going to happen, or Karty was going to miss the kick entirely. They had the belief something was going to fall in their favor. </p><p>\"It was like God talking to me,\" Campbell said. \"We're not seeing the blocked field goal, but before that it was like they're gonna miss it or we're gonna block it. Next thing you know we got it blocked. I just had so much faith in our guys.\"</p>\n<p>Campbell has seen the hard work Davis has put in this offseason. As someone Davis has taken under his wing since the first-round pick arrived, Campbell was proud of what Davis accomplished this week. He knew Davis was in store for his heroics, based on what he witnessed leading up to Sunday. </p><p>\"That dude is very athletic man,\" Campbell said. \"He can do a lot of things on that field. I love playing behind a guy like that. He's gonna make sure he does his job. ... He worked his butt off all week for that to happen.\"</p>\n            </div>"

    "body": "<div>\n        <p><span>CINCINNATI -</span> The <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/teams/CHC/chicago-cubs/\">Chicago Cubs</a> are heading back to the playoffs for the first time in a full season since 2018. The roster is full of familiar names like <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/players/2184352/kyle-tucker/\">Kyle Tucker</a>, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/players/2184343/dansby-swanson/\">Dansby Swanson</a> and <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/players/26615365/pete-crow-armstrong/\">Pete Crow-Armstrong</a>. <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/players/2942984/nico-hoerner/\">Nico Hoerner</a>, one of their most important players, doesn't have the same All-Star pedigree. But one could argue he's the glue that holds the team together. </p><p>Hoerner plays exceptional defense at second base, hops over to shortstop on the rare occasion Swanson needs a day off, hits for average, gets on base and runs the bases well. He's been used at the top of the order (leadoff 16 times, second six times), in the middle of the order (fifth 13 times and sixth 52 times) and toward the bottom (seventh 37 times and eighth 26 times).</p><p>That type of versatility teamed with the high performance is what typically gets called the \"Glue Guy,\" though Cubs manager Craig Counsell argued that Hoerner is actually too good for that title.</p><p>\"It depends on your definition,\" he said. \"I think he might be a little better than that by my definition.\" </p>\n<p>It's a fair point. When we think about the \"Glue guy\" thing, it feels like it's usually reserved for a college basketball player who isn't a star but is instead a contributor who does the so-called little things and maybe doesn't get noticed by the masses as a star player. Hoerner isn't recognized as a star. He plays on a team where he gets overshadowed. </p><p>There is, however, an argument to be made that Hoerner is the most valuable player on the 2025 Cubs. WAR agrees. Hoerner leads the Cubs this season at 6.1, half a win ahead of PCA and more than a full win ahead of Tucker. By the definition of WAR, 5+ is an All-Star level and around 8 is MVP-caliber. Though Hoerner won't win the National League MVP award that is already being virtually engraved for <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/players/2901324/shohei-ohtani/\">Shohei Ohtani</a>, he should get some consideration down the ballot. He sits fifth in WAR among NL position players and, again, he's just been so valuable to the Cubs both on and off the field in their return to the playoffs. </p>\n<p>\"With the way he impacts the game everyday, his ability as a teammate to get to know everybody and relate to everybody and just provide constant energy,\" <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/players/2184356/ian-happ/\">Ian Happ</a> told CBS Sports of the impact Hoerner has in the clubhouse. \"He's been doing that his whole career but people are starting to take notice now.\" </p>\n<p>The rookies are paying attention too. </p><p>\"Everybody looks up to him, in a way, with his work ethic and his ability to be super consistent,\" fellow infielder <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/players/29153549/matt-shaw/\">Matt Shaw</a> told CBS Sports. \"His ability to work extremely hard throughout the entire season, but still stay healthy, still stay mobile, still stay in great shape. He's someone who takes absolute care off the field, like nutritionally, recovery, all that stuff. As a whole, everyone looks to Nico as someone who leads by example.\"</p><p>Shaw, a rookie third baseman whose tough first half <span><a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/news/how-cubs-rookie-matt-shaw-got-back-on-track-with-a-demotion-to-the-minors-exactly-what-i-needed/\" target=\"_blank\">included a demotion back to Triple-A</a></span>, has regained his form and is back in the majors as a key piece for the Cubs moving toward the postseason. </p><p>\"With his personality, too, he's always trying to bring up the people around him and that shows his selflessness and that's another thing people look up to. The more he does it, the more others start to do it and in that sense, he's a glue for the clubhouse, Shaw said.</p>\n<p>\"When you're in the clubhouse every single day for 100-whatever games, you see it every single day. The consistency, which is the hardest part of this game, when things aren't going well, when things are going well, he really embodies that consistency.\" </p><a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/news/mlb-playoff-picture-standings-2025/\" target=\"_blank\">\n        <div>\n            <div>\n                <p>2025 MLB playoff picture: Baseball standings, projections, odds as Mets, Tigers, Astros fight for their lives</p>\n                <p>\n                    Kate Feldman                </p>\n            </div>\n                            <div>\n    <figure><img alt=\"2025 MLB playoff picture: Baseball standings, projections, odds as Mets, Tigers, Astros fight for their lives\" src=\"https://sportshub.cbsistatic.com/i/r/2025/09/22/47adb275-f23a-4258-a7c9-457cec0e6873/thumbnail/270x152/e9133429246bd77953c676d4a2643da6/mets-imagn.png\" /></figure>\n                </div>\n                    </div>\n    </a>\n<p>Pitcher <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/players/28920010/cade-horton/\">Cade Horton</a>, one of the top contenders for NL Rookie of the Year, echoed Shaw's praise of Hoerner's consistency</p><p>\"It's been really cool to watch a guy that's just so consistent,\" he told CBS Sports. \"With his defense, with his offense, just the way he plays the game. You know what you're going to get from him and it's been really special to watch. He's a presence in this locker room.\" </p>\n<p>Horton also wanted to credit the Cubs' defense behind him for some of his success, an 11-4 record and a 2.66 ERA in his first season.</p><p>\"[The Cubs defense] has been unreal,\" he said. \"It does help a lot, just knowing if they hit it, it's probably going to get caught because we have such an elite defense. It allows us to pitch fearlessly. Just being able to watch the defense, day in, day out, it's been incredible.\" </p><p>It isn't just Hoerner, as the Cubs also have Crow-Armstrong in center field, Swanson at short and Shaw has really come along nicely at third base. Still, Hoerner, a Gold Glove winner in 2023, rates out excellently on defense. He easily passes the eye test and the numbers bear it out. He is 11th in baseball in Outs Above Average, sitting first among second basemen. In defensive runs saved, only five players rank ahead of Hoerner.</p>\n<p>Simply, it's fair to say Hoerner is the best defensive second baseman in baseball and one of the best defenders regardless of position. </p><p>As noted, though, he's an all-around contributor and not just a defensive specialist. FanGraphs has a baserunning component (\"BSR\") of their WAR formula and Hoerner ranks 17th of 144 qualified players in BSR. </p><p>With the bat, Hoerner has been a maestro. He was one of just eight qualified hitters in Major League Baseball this season hitting .300 or better before falling to .299 on Sunday. He was one of just two on the NL side, trailing only <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/teams/PHI/philadelphia-phillies/\">Phillies</a> shortstop <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/players/2135249/trea-turner/\">Trea Turner</a> (.305), who has been out injured since Sept. 7. </p>\n<p>\"That's what it looks like!\" Counsell said of .300 hitters before the Cubs' game in Cincinnati Thursday. \"Nico feels like he gets hits nonstop and he's still at .301 and it's like 'oh my gosh, he's piling up hits.' It's hard to hit .300 in Major League Baseball. Period.\"</p><p>The Cubs have only had one batting title winner since Bill Buckner brought it home in 1980 with a .324 average. Derrek Lee led the league at .335 in 2005. The league average in 2005 was .264. This season, it's .246. Hoerner, again, is hitting .301.</p><p>\"Nico's been great,\" Counsell said. \"In the last month, it's pretty remarkable what he's doing.\"</p>\n<p>Prior to Sunday's 0 for 4, Hoerner was hitting .371/.418/.551 in his previous 22 games, pilling up 33 hits in the process. In that time, the Cubs have clinched a playoff spot and held control of the top wild card spot ahead of the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/teams/SD/san-diego-padres/\">San Diego Padres</a>.</p><p>Counsell noted that if the Cubs are to make a deep playoff run this season, they'll need a few position players to have a special October. The good news, he said, was they have a lot of candidates. The smart money here is that Hoerner will be heavily involved. </p><p>The Cubs have a super glue guy manning second base.</p>\n            </div>"
