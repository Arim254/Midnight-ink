The Blue Jays lost on Tuesday, allowing the Yankees to pull to one game out of the AL East lead, but the model sees value in Toronto bouncing back to win at +118 odds. The model also projects the Mets vs. Cubs to go Over 7 total runs, as they did in New York's 9-7 win on Tuesday.

Francisco Alvarez hit a game-winning two-run home run to break a tie at 7 in the eighth inning for his second home run in his last five games. Francisco Lindor and Brandon Nimmo also homered for the Mets. Five of the last seven Mets games went Over 7 total runs. The Cubs and the Mets both have top-10 scoring offenses in baseball, and the model projects the Over to hit in 71% of simulations for an 8:05 p.m. ET start.</p><h2>Blue Jays (+118) to defeat the Red Sox</h2><p>Toronto is in danger of falling out of first place in the American League East, and losing a first-round bye despite currently having the best record in the AL. The Blue Jays (90-67) have a one-game lead over the Yankees entering Wednesday. They've lost five of their last six games, but with a future Hall of Fame pitcher heading to the mound on Wednesday, the model projects value in the Blue Jays winning at plus-money odds. Toronto is starting Max Scherzer, who has 221 career victories, while the Red Sox start Garrett Crochet (17-5, 2.69 ERA). Crochet has a 4.50 ERA over his last two starts though. At +118 odds, the model sees value in projecting the Blue Jays to win in 54% of simulations for a 7:07 p.m. ET start.</p><h2>Rockies vs. Mariners Over 7.5 total runs (-110)</h2><p>The Mariners clinched a playoff spot on Tuesday to cap off what's been an incredible September run, going 15-1 over their last 16 games. Seattle defeated Colorado, 4-3, on Tuesday after going Over 7.5 total runs in each of its prior two contests. The Rockies are allowing the most runs in baseball (6.32 runs per game) and are scheduled to start Tanner Gordon, who has a 6.00 ERA this season. Although the Mariners clinched the postseason, they haven't secured the AL West yet, as they lead the Astros by four games. The Mariners couldn't have their all-out celebration yet with important games ahead and the likely chance of securing a first-round bye if they win the division, so the players should remain focused on Wednesday. Mariners starting pitcher Luis Castillo has been hot and cold lately, as he's allowed one run or fewer in three of his last five starts, while allowing five runs in the other two contests. The model projects the Over to hit in 69.3% of simulations for this 9:40 p.m. ET start. </p><h2>Want more MLB picks for Wednesday, September 24?</h2><p><strong>You've seen the model's Wednesday best bets.

Here's a look at the home runs in question:</p>\n<p>Judge now has four career 50-plus homer seasons, tying him with Sammy Sosa, Mark McGwire, and Babe Ruth for the most in Major League Baseball history. Judge is the only member of that bunch to record all four seasons over the span of his first 10 years in the majors. </p><p>Additionally, Judge is the first Yankees player with back-to-back 50-plus-homer seasons since Ruth did it in 1927-28.</p>\n<p>Judge had previously launched 52 home runs in 2017, 62 in 2022, and 58 last year. His 2022 showing, of course, established a new single-season high for both the Yankees franchise and the American League as a whole. Each of those marks had previously belonged to Roger Maris, who homered 61 times back in 1961.</p><p>Judge, 33, entered Wednesday's game hitting .325/.452/.669 (209 OPS+) with 49 home runs, 105 runs batted in, and 12 stolen bases. His contributions had been worth an estimated 8.9 Wins Above Replacement, according to the calculations housed at Baseball Reference. Judge is, predictably, considered to be one of the two main candidates to win the American League Most Valuable Player Award, with <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/teams/SEA/seattle-mariners/\">Seattle Mariners</a> backstop <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/players/2933037/cal-raleigh/\">Cal Raleigh</a> serving as the alternative.</p>\n<p>The Yankees clinched a postseason berth with Monday's come-from-behind win against the White Sox. New York still has something to play for the rest of the way, however, including a potential AL East title and the top seed on the Junior Circuit's side of the bracket. The Yankees are tied with the Blue Jays in both races.</p>\n            </div>\n    </div>"

The Guardians had defeated the Tigers on Tuesday night to create a tie atop the division. </p><p>The Tigers struck first on Wednesday, with outfielder <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/players/2931997/parker-meadows/\">Parker Meadows</a> putting Detroit up 1-0 on a third-inning sacrifice fly.

Heck, the Tigers were up by as many as 14 games on July 9. Weeks later, the Guardians appeared to concede by trading longtime ace <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/players/2507333/shane-bieber/\">Shane Bieber</a> to the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/teams/TOR/toronto-blue-jays/\">Toronto Blue Jays</a> in exchange for right-handed pitching prospect <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/players/29644499/khal-stephen/\">Khal Stephen</a>.

Not this one. The Tigers have slumped hard in September, posting a 5-15 record. The Guardians, for their part, have soared to an 18-5 mark including Wednesday's win.

Conversely, the Tigers will head to Boston for three games against the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/teams/BOS/boston-red-sox/\">Red Sox</a>.

He turned back the clock in a vintage performance against the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/DAL/dallas-cowboys/\">Dallas Cowboys</a>, throwing for 450 yards and three touchdowns, including a 48-yarder to <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/26697761/malik-nabers/\">Malik Nabers</a> that should have won the Giants the game with just 25 seconds left. But that game was sandwiched in-between two anemic performances against the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/WAS/washington-commanders/\">Washington Commanders</a> and <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/KC/kansas-city-chiefs/\">Kansas City Chiefs</a>, which came to a head with Wilson being booed by the MetLife Stadium crowd and chants of \"We Want Dart\" breaking out.</p><p>Wilson stressed that he will continue to try and be a leader and positive presence for the Giants, particularly for his rookie teammate in Dart.</p>\n<p>\"I'm not done. I've got so much belief in myself and know what I can be capable of. I believe I was able to show it, especially on the road in Dallas and everything else,\" Wilson said. \"I know I can help this football team if that comes up ... You control your attitude and you control your gratitude. And those two things are important to me, because I love the game, I love the process, and I respect it. That's the only thing I know.\"</p><p>Wilson also spoke from a place of overall perspective, citing a belief that was reinforced by his recent visit to a local children's hospital.</p>\n<p>\"Life is about response,\" Wilson said. \"I went to the children's hospital on Tuesday, and when you go and you see kids fighting for something that is maybe outside of what they can handle at times, it gives you a lot of perspective. So for me, life is about response, and I know that I'm gonna respond in the right way every day.\"</p><p>As part of that response, Wilson shared that he would not request his release, nor ask for a trade. \"I'm focused on helping this team win,\" he said. \"I'm focused on helping Jaxson. I'm  focused on me getting ready to be the best version of me today on  Wednesday. I want to be here. I love this organization. I love the  process of it all, I love the guys in the locker room. I'm not giving up  on us in this season.\"</p><a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/news/dishing-out-the-blame-pie-for-nfls-six-0-3-teams-giants-offense-dolphins-defense-are-tough-to-swallow/\" target=\"_blank\">\n        <div>\n            <div>\n                <p>Dishing out the blame pie for NFL's six 0-3 teams: Giants offense, Dolphins defense are tough to swallow</p>\n                <p>\n                    Jared Dubin                </p>\n            </div>\n                            <div>\n    <figure><img alt=\"Dishing out the blame pie for NFL's six 0-3 teams: Giants offense, Dolphins defense are tough to swallow\" src=\"https://sportshub.cbsistatic.com/i/r/2025/09/24/ef73c472-d648-48f1-8ac0-7154e329dab7/thumbnail/270x152/89e9d0f482e54581977d775b1a07beac/giants-jpeg.jpg\" /></figure>\n                </div>\n                    </div>\n    </a>\n<p>For the Giants, continuing to play Wilson -- who turns 37 in November and is on his third team in four seasons -- became increasingly untenable thanks to not just fans and media clamoring for Dart to play, but also a lack of results for coach Brian Daboll. The Giants are a lowly 1-14 in their last 15 games, and the success of former Giants quarterback <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/2179245/daniel-jones/\">Daniel Jones</a> on the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/IND/indianapolis-colts/\">Indianapolis Colts</a> has made already poor optics surrounding Daboll and general manager Joe Schoen even worse.</p>\n<p>While turning to Dart, a first-round pick, amounts to a last-ditch effort for Daboll and Schoen to save their jobs, the results for Wilson were also not enough to justify his continued play. Outside of his magnificent performance against Dallas, Wilson has completed just 35 of 69 passes for 328 yards with no touchdowns and two interceptions.</p>\n            </div>"

    "body": "<div>\n        <p>One of the biggest questions heading into the 2025 <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://cbssports.com/nfl/\">NFL</a> season was how <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/JAC/jacksonville-jaguars/\">Jacksonville Jaguars</a> two-way star <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/28909849/travis-hunter/\">Travis Hunter</a> would be utilized on both sides of the football. The No. 2 overall pick in the 2025 <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://cbssports.com/nfl/draft/\">NFL Draft</a> has not played more than 68.3% of the snaps on offense or defense for Jacksonville, according to Pro Football Reference, which is a dramatic decrease from his usage at Colorado last season.</p><p>The Jaguars have been taking a patient approach to finding a role for one of the most unique draft prospects in recent memory, who can play on both sides of the ball. Even if potential injuries pop up at wide receiver or cornerback, Jaguars head coach Liam Coen doesn't expect his role to change drastically immediately. </p><p>\"Right now he's one position on offense and one position on defense,\" <a href=\"https://x.com/joshnorris/status/1970889962544607733?s=46&t=2g0OABtTqzz-o27Vvt3krA\" target=\"_blank\">Coen said Wednesday</a>. \"Now that doesn't really fully change. It's just the next guy having to go and adjust to go play some 'Z,' which happened in the game. So, I don't think [injuries] change much.</p><p>\"I don't think it's fair to go say, 'Hey dude, go learn Z and X and 12 and this and that.' We have to make sure he can go execute what we are asking him to do first and foremost, which is to play 'F' and corner.\"</p>\n<h3>Travis Hunter's snap percentages this season</h3><table><tbody><tr><th>Week</th><th>Off %</th><th>Def %</th><th>Tgt</th><th>Rec</th><th>Yds</th><th>Tkl</th><th>PBU</th></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>63.6%</td><td>9.4%</td><td>8</td><td>6</td><td>33</td><td>1</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>2</td><td>59.2%</td><td>62.3%</td><td>6</td><td>3</td><td>22</td><td>2</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>3</td><td>52.9%</td><td>68.3%</td><td>2</td><td>1</td><td>21</td><td>6</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><th>Total</th><th>59%</th><th>47%</th><th>16</th><th>10</th><th>76</th><th>9</th><th>1</th></tr></tbody></table><p><br />Hunter has caught 10 passes for 76 yards on offense, while recording nine tackles with a pass breakup on defense. His lone catch during Jacksonville's 17-10 win over the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/HOU/houston-texans/\">Houston Texans</a> in Week 3 was a 21-yard catch -- which marked the longest reception of his young NFL career. </p><p>\"I wouldn't say he's behind,\" Coen said. \"I think we can probably do a better job of helping him in some ways. We had a great talk with Trav after this past game, in terms of just man like, all right, 'how can we help you and put you?' Because guys, right, what is he learning? It's a lot. So we've got to, I think, be a little bit more diligent in terms of putting him in positions to maybe not have to do as many moving parts, so that we can just let him go play.\"</p><p>Coen's comments come <span><a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/news/deion-sanders-calls-on-jaguars-to-alter-travis-hunters-rookie-role-theyre-not-using-him-enough/\" target=\"_blank\">just days after Hunter's former coach at Colorado, Deion Sanders,</a></span> said on a recent <em>New Heights </em><a href=\"https://lnk.to/NewHeightsPodcast\" target=\"_blank\">podcast episode</a> that the Jaguars weren't \"using him enough.\"</p>\n<p>\"They're not using him enough,\" <a href=\"https://lnk.to/NewHeightsPodcast\" target=\"_blank\">Sanders said</a>. \"I've seen it with my own eyes on an everyday basis for three straight years, so I know what he's capable of, and I know how you've got to take care of him. He never practices on Tuesday. He practices on Wednesday, Thursday, Friday. He was ready to play a hundred and some snaps on Saturday, so you didn't need to use him on a Tuesday or a Monday. You don't use him like that.\"</p><p>CBS Sports' Jared Dubin certainly agrees with Deion, writing earlier this week that <span><a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/news/jaguars-bet-big-on-travis-hunter-through-three-weeks-his-usage-hasnt-matched-the-cost/\" target=\"_blank\">Hunter's usage raises questions about what the Jaguars gave up to draft him</a></span>. Jacksonville surrendered the Nos. 5, 36 and 126 picks, along with a 2026 first-round selection, to move up three spots to take Hunter. (The team also received the 104th and 200th overall picks in the blockbuster deal.)</p><blockquote><p>Hunter is only three weeks into his career, after all. The Jaguars could just be ramping him up to play more often rather than having him out there for a full complement of snaps right away. And that would probably be a smart thing. You don't want to physically tax him too much right away and have him break down before you even get a chance to use him in the way he should be used. </p><p>But the Jags do need to figure out better ways to get more out of him. The defensive usage makes sense. Hunter was an outside corner in college and he's been used that way in the pros, particularly filling in for the injured Jarrian Jones as the left corner. </p><p>But the offensive usage is not conducive to getting the most out of his skill set, even when you consider that he was rawer as a receiver than as a defensive back coming out of college. You have to be able to stretch the field vertically every so often instead of using him only around the line of scrimmage. Otherwise, defenses are just going to sit on the short stuff and even start taking away some of his run-after-catch opportunities. Considering that's been the only way he's made positive contributions on offense to date, it obviously wouldn't be ideal if that stuff went away.</p></blockquote><p>Hunter and the Jaguars (2-1) face the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/SF/san-francisco-49ers/\">San Francisco 49ers</a> (3-0) on the road Sunday in Week 4.</p>\n            </div>"

The Cardinals make an opponent one-dimensional on offense and then perform their best in clutch situations as Arizona ranks top-five in rushing defense, third-down defense and redzone defense.</p><p>While Conner's injury is an emotional setback for Arizona, it does allow the team to utilize second-year back, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/3176915/trey-benson/\">Trey Benson</a>, more.

Additionally, just four teams have a better turnover differential than the Cards, which the model has taken into account.

Things were so bad that the Giants became the first team in the league to make a non-injury-related quarterback change, sending <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/1272242/russell-wilson/\">Russell Wilson</a> to the bench. But that also comes back to offseason decision-making. Why was Wilson signed in the first place? The Giants had already signed a bridge starter in <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/1998197/jameis-winston/\">Jameis Winston</a>. There was no real point to doing this. In any event, the defense has also been somewhat of a disappointment, having been lit up for over 400 yards by two of its three opponents and forced only one turnover through three games. Neither the offense nor defense looks like it has a real plan to put people in position to succeed, which comes back to coaching. </p><div>\n                            <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/NO/new-orleans-saints/\">\n    <figure><img alt=\"team logo\" src=\"https://sports.cbsimg.net/fly/images/team-logos/421.svg\" /></figure>\n                                                </a>\n                    </div>\n    <p><strong>Lack of talent: 75% | Organizational stasis: 25%</strong></p><p>The Saints haven't really looked yet like they are in the same class as any of their opponents, and that's not necessarily a good sign because the three opponents they've faced are an okay <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/ARI/arizona-cardinals/\">Cardinals</a> team, a <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/SF/san-francisco-49ers/\">49ers</a> team starting its backup quarterback and then the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/SEA/seattle-seahawks/\">Seahawks</a>, who were missing several starters from their ferocious defense. This is a franchise that has allowed its roster to get old and stale, and is finally staring down the barrel of a full-scale rebuild. This is what it looks like when your roster gets to that point: you're not really all that competitive in any of your games because you simply can't compete with teams whose talent level is a significant step above where yours is. This is likely what we're going to see out of the Saints all year. And honestly, that's fine.

Wilson has been balling out but nobody else on the team has more than 78 yards receiving through three games.

It's especially tough when you give the ball away four times in three games. When you're undermanned on that side of the ball, you just can't afford those mistakes. That said, the Jets could easily be 2-1 if their defense could have gotten one stop against the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/PIT/pittsburgh-steelers/\">Steelers</a> or <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/TB/tampa-bay-buccaneers/\">Buccaneers</a> in a big spot.

Some of that is due to various injuries in the secondary, but it is<em> bad</em> stuff. The Dolphins rank 26th in yards allowed and 32nd in points allowed. They've given up 31 or more points to all three of their opponents. They have forced zero turnovers. Opponents are averaging the most yards and points per drive in the league and have scored on an utterly preposterous 68% of their possessions. The defense has been so bad that it's overshadowed the offense looking largely like a shell of the unit that took the league by storm a few years ago. The last two games have been better than the disastrous opener but the high-flying, explosive version of this team is gone. The vibes have been rancid since at least training camp, and that's shown up for this team on the field.</p>\n<div>\n                            <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/HOU/houston-texans/\">\n    <figure><img alt=\"team logo\" src=\"https://sports.cbsimg.net/fly/images/team-logos/247415.svg\" /></figure>\n                                                </a>\n                    </div>\n    <p><strong>Offensive line: 40% | Turnovers: 40% | Lack of skill talent: 20% | Schedule: 10%</strong></p><p>Are we really doing this again with Houston's offensive line? It feels like we're watching the same movie as last year. And it turns out, when you swap out almost the entire line but don't actually invest real resources in replacing the guys you're moving on from, things don't actually get much better. As a result, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/3163079/c-j-stroud/\">C.J. Stroud</a> is under constant pressure, and he looks jittery in the pocket. The run game cannot come close to getting untracked except when the Bucs are letting <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/2131579/nick-chubb/\">Nick Chubb</a> score late in the game. The receivers outside of <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/2878193/nico-collins/\">Nico Collins</a> don't come close to getting open, so there's nowhere to go with the ball even on the rare occasions where Stroud does have time to throw. That's all resulted in some pretty bad turnovers. The Texans had the misfortune of playing the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/LAR/los-angeles-rams/\">Rams</a> and Bucs in the first three weeks, but that's just the lack of the draw. </p><div>\n                            <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/TEN/tennessee-titans/\">\n    <figure><img alt=\"team logo\" src=\"https://sports.cbsimg.net/fly/images/team-logos/432.svg\" /></figure>\n                                                </a>\n                    </div>\n    <p><strong>Offensive line: 25% | Coaching: 25% | Schedule: 25% | Lack of talent: 25%</strong></p><p>Speaking of remade offensive lines that have not worked out, it's the Tennessee Titans! They are going to get <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/3168422/cam-ward/\">Cam Ward</a> killed out there. Dan Moore has been a turnstile, while <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/26694508/jc-latham/\">JC Latham</a> and <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/1631203/kevin-zeitler/\">Kevin Zeitler</a> have both missed time. It's not been pretty. Brian Callahan apparently does not know that an elbow equals two feet when it comes to the catch rule. He has directly cost his team 10 points at the end of halves (seven against Denver and three against Indianapolis) with poor clock management. He is wildly conservative in his decision-making. Some of that is probably due to the tough schedule (<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/DEN/denver-broncos/\">Broncos</a>, Rams, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/IND/indianapolis-colts/\">Colts</a>) and maybe some of it is due to his under-talented team, but he has consistently put them behind the eight-ball. He's giving up play-calling now, so maybe things will change going forward. </p>\n            </div>"

    "body": "<div>\n        <p>No double-digit favorites have lost yet in the 2025 NFL season, but Week 3 did bring perhaps the biggest upset of the year thus far as the Packers fell to the Browns as 7.5-point favorites. That was one of the first big hits for NFL survivor players, and now those who remain are formulating their Week 4 NFL survivor picks with the options beginning to dwindle a bit. The Bills are the biggest favorites on the board (-16.5) this week against the Saints, though many survivor pool players already used Buffalo as big favorites against the Dolphins in Week 3. </p><p>The latest Week 4 NFL odds show six other games with a Week 4 NFL spread of 5.5 points or more, including Browns vs. Lions (-9.5), Patriots (-5.5) vs. Panthers, Titans vs. Texans (-7), Chargers vs. Giants (+6.5), Packers vs. Cowboys (+6.5) and Bengals vs. Broncos (-7.5). Those are the games many NFL survivor players will be targeting, but among those favorites, which ones bring the most value in NFL survivor pools? </p><p><em>Before finalizing any Week 4 NFL survivor picks, </em><a href=\"https://www.sportsline.com/insiders/nfl-survivor-pool-week-4-2025-pick-from-advanced-computer-model/#ttag=09252025_agg_cbssports_picks_football_nfl_model_survivorpool\" target=\"_blank\"><em>see which team the red-hot SportsLine Projection Model just went all-in on</em></a><em>.</em></p><p>The model, which simulates every NFL game 10,000 times, is up well over $7,000 for $100 players on top-rated <a href=\"https://www.sportsline.com/nfl/picks/\" target=\"_blank\">NFL picks</a> since its inception. The model is on a sizzling 39-19 run on top-rated picks dating back to 2024. Anybody following its <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/betting/news/nfl/\" target=\"_blank\">NFL betting</a> picks at <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/betting/news/best-betting-apps/\" target=\"_blank\">sportsbooks</a> and on <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/betting/news/best-betting-apps/\" target=\"_blank\">betting sites</a> could have seen strong returns. The model can be used to crush the survivor pool format, which calls for picking one team to win each week but never using the same team twice. It survived through Week 1 by calling the Commanders over the Giants, Week 2 with the Ravens over the Browns, and Week 3 with Bills over Dolphins.</p><p>Now, it has turned its attention to the latest Week 4 NFL schedule and locked in its Week 4 survivor pool pick. <a href=\"https://www.sportsline.com/insiders/nfl-survivor-pool-week-4-2025-pick-from-advanced-computer-model/#ttag=09252025_agg_cbssports_picks_football_nfl_model_survivorpool\" target=\"_blank\">You can only see who the model is backing this week at SportsLine</a>. </p><p><em>New users can also target the </em><span><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/betting/news/draftkings-promo-code/\"><em>DraftKings promo code</em></a></span><em>, which offers </em><a href=\"https://martech.cbssports.com/bt/redirect/prod?b=draftkings&c=sport\" target=\"_blank\"><em>$200 in bonus bets instantly plus over $200 off NFL Sunday Ticket</em></a><em>:</em></p><h3>Top Week 4 NFL survivor pool predictions </h3><p>In Week 4 of the 2025 NFL season, the model is shying away from the Patriots as they take on the Carolina Panthers. The Patriots are 5.5-point and -243 money-line favorites, as one of the home favorites in the Week 4 lines, but are coming off a 21-14 loss to the Pittsburgh Steelers. The Panthers, meanwhile, got into the win column in a big way by thrashing the Falcons. Fading Carolina prior to that game was a popular NFL survivor strategy. </p><p>The model, however, projects this to be a one-score game, and only has New England winning 58% of the time, which is lower than many home teams this week. Drake Maye has had mixed results in three games and is still getting acclimated as the Patriots' starting quarterback. He has played in 16 games over the course of two seasons, and is completing 68% of his passes for 3,061 yards with 20 touchdowns and 12 interceptions. For the season, he has completed 72.6% of his passes for 785 yards and five touchdowns with two interceptions. <a href=\"https://www.sportsline.com/insiders/nfl-survivor-pool-week-4-2025-pick-from-advanced-computer-model/#ttag=09252025_agg_cbssports_picks_football_nfl_model_survivorpool\" target=\"_blank\">See which team to pick instead here</a>. </p><p><em>You can also use the latest </em><span><a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/betting/news/fanduel-promo-code/\" target=\"_blank\"><em>FanDuel promo code</em></a></span><em> to </em><a href=\"https://martech.cbssports.com/bt/redirect/prod?b=fanduel&c=sport\" target=\"_blank\"><em>get $300 in bonus bets instantly</em></a><em>:</em></p><h3>How to make Week 4 NFL survivor pool picks </h3><p>Instead, the model is confidently backing a team many have not used in survivor pools to win outright in more than 70% of simulations.

The beef began when Sneed, a former star corner for the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/KC/kansas-city-chiefs/\">Kansas City Chiefs</a>, was asked by reporters in Nashville about his matchup covering Collins.</p><p>Sneed feigned obliviousness -- as if he didn't know who Collins was -- not once, but twice. \"Who?\" he said both times before flashing a smile and eliciting some laughter from local reporters.</p>\n<p>For Collins, Sneed's remarks were no laughing matter. Though he initially expressed his excitement for the matchup, his tone changed when he was asked directly about what Sneed had told reporters in Nashville. \"He knows who I am. That's crazy,\" Collins said at first before going into more detail in a followup question.</p>\n<p>\"I'm a dawg, you know what I'm saying? I'm just me. I don't say much, I just play.

Sneed played in neither of the Titans' two matchups with the Texans a year ago; he played in just five games before a quad injury ended his season.</p>\n            </div>\n    </div>"

    "body": "<div>\n        <p><span>LONDON --</span> It was not so long ago that a team such as Doncaster Rovers might rock up at the <span>Tottenham Hotspur</span> Stadium with a well-worn and occasionally effective plan for downing a Premier League giant. Keep it tight in open play, trust yourselves to nick something from a set piece at the other end. Eighteen months ago, when Ange Postecoglou was at his most dismissive about the value of specialist set piece coaching, it might even have worked.</p><p>In 2025, however, what was once a great equalizing factor between the EFL and the Premier League looks to be another aspect of the game where money talks. Whenever Xavi Simons stood over a corner or Rodrigo Bentancur stood over a free kick, Andreas Georgson would step out from Thomas Frank's shadow to supervise another carefully crafted routine. Check their penalty area and it was apparent how much smaller and younger the League One side looked. Gone are the days when a giant 33-year-old might be the rock on which Doncaster built their defense. Instead, it was the Premier League athletes who leaped highest and hit hardest. </p><p>In the early exchanges, Doncaster looked firmly in this tie. They attacked aggressively out wide, Tottenham loanee Damola Ajayi causing particular issues for his parent club, volleying a delivery from wide back across goal to a spot where Toyosi Olusanya could not quite turn the ball home. McCann's side looked comfortable in possession too, and though they were no less vulnerable down their own flanks than they were dangerous when they had the ball, you could convince yourself that they could create a few issues for their hosts as this game went on.</p><p>Then came Tottenham's first corner, lofted menacingly towards the goal line by Simons. It is fair to note that with or without a set-piece coach at his disposal, Ian Lawlor in the Doncaster goal ought to have been able to get a more convincing punch on the corner. Sean Grehan could have cleared it anywhere, but where he did, the perfect spot for Joao Palhinha to try an overhead kick. With Lawlor in no man's land, the connection didn't even have to be that sweet to hand Spurs the lead.</p>\n<p>Make no mistake, with or without set pieces, Tottenham would probably have had this game won with relative ease. Their quality out wide was beyond anything right back Tom Nixon could deal with, Wilson Isidor skipping past him two minutes after the opener to deliver a fine cross Jay McGrath could only turn into his own net. Spurs could wait until the last kick of the ball to add a third, <span>Brennan Johnson</span> charging through an exhausted defense to meet <span>Lucas Bergvall's</span> through ball and clip home.</p><p>Before then, another goal seemed more likely than not, it would be from another dead ball. There was a period late in the first half when this was on the brink of training ground exercise status, Spurs working on a string of corner routines that ended with an unmarked Pedro Porro striking at goal. It was too easy for Bentancur to outjump the red and white shirts when a delivery went straight into the box while <span>Kevin Danso's</span> knock on found <span>Archie Gray</span> in the box for one of the best chances of the game. The former limbering up to hurl one into the mixer spoke to the burgeoning trend for long throws in 2025-26. </p><p>In all, 11 of Tottenham's first 15 shots came from set pieces. And perhaps the extreme nature of their dominance from set pieces is exactly that, extreme. An improvement from dead balls has been a key tenet of Spurs under Frank, while the early-season data from League One would suggest that Doncaster are a fairly unremarkable team when it comes to attacking and defending such scenarios.</p>\n<p>Equally, as set pieces become the latest marginal gain that obsesses the Premier League, it is easy to see how the particular sort of dominance Tottenham applied might be applied on the days that are supposed to be about giant killing. When the nights draw in for FA Cup third round weekend, how many more of League One's finest will find themselves smothered and bullied at corners? If that does indeed prove to be the case, it is harder than ever to see how the next Doncaster might pull off a cup upset.</p>\n            </div>"
