    "body": "<div>\n        <p>The <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/wnba/teams/MIN/minnesota-lynx/\">Minnesota Lynx</a> spent the entire 2025 WNBA regular season as the league's most dominant team, but suffered a shocking semifinals loss to the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/wnba/teams/PHO/phoenix-mercury/\">Phoenix Mercury</a> to end their bid for another championship earlier than expected. </p><p>That series ended with star forward <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/wnba/players/26677824/napheesa-collier/\">Napheesa Collier</a> injured and in a walking boot after suffering an ankle injury late in Game 4 on a controversial no-call that sent Lynx coach Cheryl Reeve into a tirade on the sidelines. On Tuesday, Collier met with the media for her post-season exit interview and opened with a lengthy, four-minute statement in which she went scorched earth on WNBA commissioner Cathy Engelbert over a number of issues from CBA negotiations to officiating problems. </p><p>In the statement, which you can read in full below, Coller said the WNBA has \"the worst leadership in the world.\" She also brought out receipts from a conversation she had with Engelbert in February, in which the commissioner told her that <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/wnba/players/29362921/caitlin-clark/\">Caitlin Clark</a> \"should be grateful\" to the WNBA for her endorsement deals and that players should be \"on their knees\" thanking her for the new media rights deal.</p><blockquote><p>\"First of all, I'd like to congratulate the Mercury for advancing to the Finals. I want to be clear this conversation is not about winning or losing, it's about something much bigger. The real threat to our league isn't money, it isn't ratings or even missed calls or even physical play. It's the lack of accountability from the league office. Since I've been in the league, you've heard the constant concerns about officiating and it has now reached levels of inconsistency that plague our sport and undermine the integrity with which it operates. </p><p>Whether the league cares about the health of the players is one thing, but to also not care about the product we put on the floor is truly self-sabotage. Year after year, the only thing that remains consistent is the lack of accountability from our leaders. The league has a buzzword that they rolled out as a talking point for the CBA as to why they can't pay the players what we're worth; that word is sustainability. But what's truly unsustainable is keeping a good product on the floor while allowing officials to lose control of games. Fans see it every night. Coaches, both winning and losing, point it out every night in pre- and post-game media. And leadership just issues fines and looks the other way. They ignore the issues that everyone inside the game is begging them to fix. That is negligence. </p><p>At Unrivaled this past February, I sat across from Cathy and asked how she planned to address the officiating issues in our league. Her response was, 'Well, only the losers complain about the refs.' I also asked how she planned to fix the fact that players like Caitlin, Angel and Paige, who are clearly driving massive revenue for the league, are making so little for their first four years. Her response was, 'Caitlin should be grateful she makes $60 million off the court because without the platform the WNBA gives her, she wouldn't make anything.'</p><p>In that same conversation, she told me 'players should be on their knees thanking their lucky stars for the media rights deal that I got them.' That's the mentality driving our league from the top. We go to battle every day to protect a shield that doesn't value us. The league believes it succeeds despite its players, not because of them. </p><p>I have the privilege of watching my husband run a league where he has to balance 100 different things at once. I won't pretend the job is easy, but even with all of that on his plate, he always reaches out to players when he sees an injury, whether it's Unrivaled or even during the WNBA season. That is what leadership looks like. It's the human element, it's basic integrity, and it's the bare minimum any leader should embody. But do you know who I haven't heard from? Cathy. Not one call, not one text. Instead the only outreach has come from her No. 2 telling my agent that she doesn't believe physical play is contributing to injuries. </p><p>That is infuriating. And it's the perfect example of the tone deaf, dismissive approach that our leaders always seem to take. I've finally grown tired. For too long, I've tried to have these conversations in private, but it's clear there's no intention of accepting there's a problem. The league has made it clear it isn't about innovation, it isn't about collaboration, it's about control and power. I've earned this platform and I paid the price to get here, and now I have a responsibility to speak on behalf of the fans and everyone in this league that deserves better. </p><p>Our leadership's answer to being held accountable is to suppress everyone's voices by handing out fines. I'm not concerned about a fine. I'm concerned about the future of our sport. At some point, everyone deserves to hear the truth from someone who I hope has earned the benefit of the doubt to fight for what is right and fair for our athletes and our fans. We have the best players in the world. We have the best fans in the world. But right now we have the worst leadership in the world.</p><p>If I didn't know exactly what the job entailed, maybe I wouldn't feel this way, but unfortunately for them, I do. We serve a league that has shown they think championship coaches and Hall of Fame players are dispensible, and that's fine, it's professional sports. But I will not stand quietly by and allow different standards to be applied at the league level.\" </p></blockquote><p>Hours after Collier's comments, Engelbert responded with a statement of her own, explaining how she was \"disheartened\" by what she heard. </p><p>\"I have the utmost respect for Napheesa Collier and for all the players in the WNBA,\" <a href=\"https://x.com/Rachel__Nichols/status/1973113802301362459\" target=\"_blank\">Engelbert said</a>. \"Together we have all worked tirelessly to transform this league. My focus remains on ensuring a bright future for the players and the WNBA, including collaborating on how we continue to elevate the game. I am disheartened by how Napheesa characterized our conversation and league leadership, but even when our perspectives differ, my commitment to the players and to this work will never waver.\" </p>\n<p>The frustration Collier and other players have had with Engelbert has been apparent throughout this year as players have consistently called out the league for not engaging in good faith CBA negotiations. This statement seemed to be a rallying cry from Collier, both to the rest of the players and to fans to push back strongly together against leadership that she feels is actively antagonistic toward the players. </p><p>The anecdote about Clark, in particular, was a savvy move from Collier given the legions of fans devoted to the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/wnba/teams/IND/indiana-fever/\">Fever</a> star who will certainly not take Engelbert's comments about how the WNBA has created Clark's popularity well. </p><p>Collier also references her experience running Unrivaled alongside her husband over the past two years, and notes how that has caused her to recognize how poor a job the WNBA's leadership does with player relations and taking concerns seriously. </p>\n<p>All of this points to the players and the WNBA being further apart than ever when it comes to the ongoing CBA negotiations, and it's hard to see how that gap gets bridged quickly. </p>\n            </div>"

    "body": "<div>\n        <p>The path to a championship in <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://cbssports.com/nba/\">NBA</a> Fantasy often runs right through the breakout stars -- players who significantly outperform their fantasy basketball ADP. While veterans like <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nba/players/2067655/giannis-antetokounmpo/fantasy/\">Giannis Antetokounmpo</a>, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nba/players/2135542/nikola-jokic/fantasy/\">Nikola Jokic</a>, and <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nba/players/2938033/shai-gilgeous-alexander/fantasy/\">Shai Gilgeous-Alexander</a> provide a safe floor, it's the up-and-coming players ready for bigger roles who offer the most transformative upside. Based on NBA projections, roster openings, and talent trajectory, here are five elite NBA breakout candidates ready to launch.</p><h2>Fantasy Basketball Breakouts</h2><p><strong>C <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nba/players/29275372/alex-sarr/fantasy/\">Alex Sarr</a>, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nba/teams/WAS/washington-wizards/\">Wizards</a></strong></p><p>Sarr enters 2025-26 as one of the league's most popular breakout picks, and the excitement is warranted. The 7-foot Frenchman, taken No. 2 overall in the 2024 <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://cbssports.com/nba/draft/\">NBA Draft</a>, showed promise as a rookie but lacked consistency. He averaged 13.0 points, 6.5 rebounds, 2.4 assists and 1.5 blocks across 67 regular-season starts, shooting 39.4 percent from the field and 30.8 percent from deep in 27.1 minutes per game. His scoring ticked up late in the year, climbing to 15.3 points per game over his final 24 contests once March arrived. </p><p>At just 20 years old, Sarr already has the size, mobility and defensive instincts to anchor a frontcourt. The next step is diversifying his offensive repertoire and adding strength to his game. Washington's roster construction sets the stage for that leap. Veterans <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nba/players/2067685/cj-mccollum/fantasy/\">CJ McCollum</a> and <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nba/players/1992813/khris-middleton/fantasy/\">Khris Middleton</a> bring experienced scoring, but with no ball-dominant star in the lineup, Sarr should see increased usage and heavier minutes. A calf injury suffered during EuroBasket will delay his start to training camp, but it isn't expected to be a long-term concern. If his efficiency improves alongside natural development, the expectation that his workload climbs north of 30 minutes per night could accelerate his path to stardom. All told, the pieces are there for a true sophomore breakout, with Sarr positioned as a potential cornerstone for the Wizards' future.</p><p><strong>F <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nba/players/29275373/matas-buzelis/fantasy/\">Matas Buzelis</a>, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nba/teams/CHI/chicago-bulls/\">Bulls</a></strong></p><p>Another member of the 2024 NBA Draft class, Buzelis finished his rookie season on an upward trajectory, positioning himself as one of the league's most intriguing breakout candidates for 2025-26. The G League Ignite product had a quiet start, averaging 5.3 points and 2.8 rebounds on 39.8 percent shooting in just 13.3 minutes across his first 47 contests. But when the calendar flipped to February, his confidence and workload grew. Over his final 33 regular-season games, he averaged 13.3 points, 4.4 rebounds and 1.1 blocks in 26.9 minutes per night, while shooting an efficient 49.1 percent from the field and 36.7 percent from three. By season's end, Buzelis had logged 80 regular-season appearances (31 starts), finishing with averages of 8.6 points, 3.5 rebounds and 1.0 assists in 18.9 minutes. </p>\n<p>Set to turn 21 before the season tips off, he's already carved out a reputation as a versatile two-way piece: able to score from multiple levels, guard on the perimeter, and protect the rim at a high rate, ranking in the 93rd percentile for shot-block percentage (4.3%). Chicago's roster does have solid contributors in <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nba/players/26646085/josh-giddey/fantasy/\">Josh Giddey</a>, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nba/players/3041443/coby-white/fantasy/\">Coby White</a> and <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nba/players/1647481/nikola-vucevic/fantasy/\">Nikola Vucevic</a>, which means touches won't always be plentiful. Regardless, Buzelis has earned his way into significant minutes, and his ability to contribute across the board gives him a pathway to a bigger role. If his minutes settle in the 25-to-30 range or beyond, as they did late last season, Buzelis has every opportunity to grow from a promising rookie into a breakout sophomore star.</p><p><strong>F <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nba/players/29005044/ausar-thompson/fantasy/\">Ausar Thompson</a>, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nba/teams/DET/detroit-pistons/\">Pistons</a></strong></p><p>Thompson didn't take a major leap as a sophomore, but year three sets up as a true breakout opportunity. His rookie season was cut short by a blood clot, an issue that lingered into last year and sidelined him for the Pistons' first 18 games. Once cleared, the 2023 first-round pick started 48 of 59 regular-season appearances, averaging 10.1 points, 5.1 rebounds, 2.3 assists and 1.7 steals in 22.5 minutes per contest on 53.5 percent shooting. The workload dipped slightly from his rookie year, but still marked solid production for a 21-year-old working back from a major health scare.</p><p>Offensively, Thompson has room to grow as both a shooter and playmaker. Even without major strides on that end, he makes his mark with elite defense and athleticism, disrupting passing lanes and protecting the rim. His combination of size and quickness allows him to rack up steals and blocks in bunches, and more minutes should only enhance his impact. With a full, healthy offseason behind him, Thompson carries both a high floor and a high ceiling. At worst, he's already an elite defensive stopper. But if his offensive game progresses even modestly, his ceiling rises toward legitimate two-way stardom. With his tools, motor and expected uptick in minutes, year three offers Thompson a real chance to move from promising prospect to a centerpiece in Detroit.</p>\n<p><strong>F <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nba/players/3141429/toumani-camara/fantasy/\">Toumani Camara</a>, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nba/teams/POR/portland-trail-blazers/\">Trail Blazers</a></strong></p><p>Camara has made impressive strides since being drafted in the second round of the 2023 NBA Draft, establishing himself as a reliable contributor for the Trail Blazers. In his sophomore season last year, he started all 78 of his regular-season appearances, averaging 11.3 points, 5.8 rebounds, 2.2 assists and 1.5 steals in 32.7 minutes per game. He also took a step forward as a shooter, improving his three-point percentage to 37.5 after hitting 33.7 percent as a rookie. Camara finished the year on a high note, averaging 14.3 points, 5.2 rebounds, 2.6 assists and 1.5 steals over his final 12 games, while shooting 47.4 percent from the field and 39.7 percent from deep.</p><p>Portland's season was turbulent, but Camara remained steady. With <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nba/players/29005041/scoot-henderson/fantasy/\">Scoot Henderson</a> (hamstring) sidelined to open the upcoming campaign, Camara could see an expanded offensive role, giving him more chances to get shots up and find rhythm from beyond the arc. Even if his usage doesn't rise dramatically, his consistent minutes, defensive activity and steady production give him a high floor. But if his involvement increases while he continues his upward trajectory, Camara could be primed for a breakout as a versatile, two-way contributor capable of filling the box score across categories.</p><p><strong>G/F <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nba/players/3178537/bennedict-mathurin/fantasy/\">Bennedict Mathurin</a>, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nba/teams/IND/indiana-pacers/\">Pacers</a></strong></p><p>Mathurin has steadily delivered across his first three seasons since being drafted No. 6 overall in 2022, but this year could mark his true breakout. He played in 72 regular-season games (49 starts) last season and averaged 16.1 points, 5.3 rebounds and 1.9 assists in 29.8 minutes while shooting 45.8 percent from the field and 34.0 percent from deep. His postseason run was uneven — he scored 20-plus points five times, including a double-double in Game 7 of the Finals, but also had 12 games in single digits.</p>\n<p>The Pacers enter 2025-26 with much of their roster intact, but two massive changes create opportunity: <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nba/players/3041074/tyrese-haliburton/fantasy/\">Tyrese Haliburton</a> (Achilles) is sidelined for the season, and longtime anchor <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nba/players/2152935/myles-turner/fantasy/\">Myles Turner</a> is now in Milwaukee. Those losses may hurt Indiana's title hopes, but they elevate Mathurin's role in the offense. With <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nba/players/2157611/pascal-siakam/fantasy/\">Pascal Siakam</a> still the primary option, the 23-year-old wing is positioned to emerge as the No. 2 scorer ahead of <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nba/players/3041935/andrew-nembhard/fantasy/\">Andrew Nembhard</a> and <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nba/players/3041270/aaron-nesmith/fantasy/\">Aaron Nesmith</a>. He should also log 30-plus minutes per night for the first time in his career, boosting production simply by volume. While he's not an elite shooter or much of a playmaker, Mathurin has the tools and opportunity for a major scoring jump. That kind of leap wouldn't just help fill the Pacers' void — it would mark his arrival as one of the league's rising young wings.</p>\n            </div>"

Had the Yanks prevailed in the division, then they would've enjoyed a first-round bye. Instead, they'll face the dangerous Red Sox in an already dangerous best-of-three series. Last year, the Yankees barged to the pennant before falling to the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/teams/LAD/los-angeles-dodgers/\">Dodgers</a> in the World Series in five games. Over the winter, they lost generational free agent <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/players/2507367/juan-soto/\">Juan Soto</a> to the crosstown <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/teams/NYM/new-york-mets/\">Mets</a>, but high-value performances from <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/players/2184451/trent-grisham/\">Trent Grisham</a> and <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/players/2165919/cody-bellinger/\">Cody Bellinger</a> helped cushion the blow and then some.

The challenge for Alex Cora and the Sox will be toppling the Yanks without the services of rookie phenom <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/players/29075759/roman-anthony/\">Roman Anthony</a>. Anthony was perhaps Boston's best player starting with his June call-up, but an oblique injury suffered in early September will keep him out for at least this opening round. In more general terms, the Red Sox are hoping regular-season trends hold. That's because they won nine of 13 head-to-head games against the Yankees and outscored them by a margin of 66-51. In games played in the Bronx -- where the entirety of this series will take place -- the Sox went 5-2. </p>\n            </div>\n    </div>"

    "body": "<div>\n        <p>In every year except his rookie season, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nba/players/2203517/jalen-brunson/\">Jalen Brunson</a> has made at least 40% the catch-and-shoot 3s he has attempted. The 2024-25 season, however, was the first time in Brunson's career that fewer than half of his 3-point attempts were of the catch-and-shoot variety. With <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nba/players/2152531/karl-anthony-towns/\">Karl-Anthony Towns</a> and <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nba/players/2153056/mikal-bridges/\">Mikal Bridges</a> joining the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nba/teams/NY/new-york-knicks/\">New York Knicks</a>, Brunson's usage rate and shot attempts decreased slightly, but he wasn't exactly less ball-dominant. For the second straight season, he led the entire league in average seconds per touch (6.06) and dribbles per touch (6.04), and both numbers were slightly <em>higher</em> than they were the previous year.</p><p>Mike Brown, the Knicks' new coach, wants to get Brunson off the ball more often. He wants to find Brunson more spot-up 3s. \"The ball will be in his hands, especially down the stretch, and so to make the game easier throughout the course of the game is going to be a big thing,\" Brown <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://youtu.be/4WurbP4cOqQ?si=nCEAPkb18UGyBGx5&t=703\">told reporters last week</a>. Brown has also been <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://youtu.be/VbfUcfc7LGA?si=NToQfS5Ku7U0Cs5K&t=533\">talking about</a> pushing the pace, making quick decisions and playing out of concepts rather than set plays. All of this sounds sensible, but it's still September. Despite being slow and sometimes stagnant on offense, under Tom Thibodeau last season New York was still playing on the last day of May. That's a high bar to clear.</p><h2>The State of Play</h2><p><strong>Last year: </strong>The Knicks finished 51-31, their best record since 2013, with Brunson making the All-NBA Second Team, Towns making the Third Team and both of them starting in the All-Star Game. After the All-Star break, though, their offense fell off, and this was only in part because Brunson missed a month with an ankle injury. They looked overmatched against elite competition during the regular season, but, after a tight first-round series against the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nba/teams/DET/detroit-pistons/\">Pistons</a>, they upset the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nba/teams/BOS/boston-celtics/\">Celtics</a> in the second round to advance to the conference finals for the first time in 25 years. Making the ECF was not enough, however, to save Thibodeau's job -- after losing to the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nba/teams/IND/indiana-pacers/\">Pacers</a> in six games, the Knicks fired the coach who had presided over their turnaround.</p><p><strong>The offseason: </strong>The Knicks were denied permission to interview various coaches employed by other teams, but eventually settled on Brown and hired Chris Jent as his lead assistant. Early in free agency, they signed <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nba/players/2245320/guerschon-yabusele/\">Guerschon Yabusele</a> to a two-year, $11.3 million contract using the taxpayer midlevel exception and added <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nba/players/2135523/jordan-clarkson/\">Jordan Clarkson</a>, who'd accepted a buyout from the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nba/teams/UTA/utah-jazz/\">Jazz</a>, on a one-year deal for the minimum. Leading up to camp, they re-signed <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nba/players/2203585/landry-shamet/\">Landry Shamet</a> and signed <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nba/players/1905262/malcolm-brogdon/\">Malcolm Brogdon</a>, both for the minimum.</p>\n<p><strong>Las Vegas over/under: </strong>53.5, per <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/betting/news/betmgm-promo-code/\">BetMGM</a></p><h2>The Conversation</h2><p><strong>Knicks believer: </strong><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.youtube.com/shorts/3yCf99toP0U\">As Spike Lee keeps saying</a>, this is the Knicks' year. They're deeper than they were last year, and I particularly love the Guerschon Yabusele addition. He is <em>exactly </em>what they needed: a proper 4 who can space the floor, post up mismatches and defend 5s when necessary. You remember Malcolm Brogdon won Sixth Man of the Year in 2023, right? The only reason people haven't made a big deal out of that signing is that he has been stuck on losing teams since then. I'm happy for Mikal Bridges, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nba/players/2844732/og-anunoby/\">OG Anunoby</a> and <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nba/players/2105193/josh-hart/\">Josh Hart</a> because they won't have to grind through 40-plus minutes during the dog days of the regular season anymore. I know New York isn't the betting favorite in the East, but I'm not worried about Cleveland. This team has just as much firepower, and, as we saw in the playoffs a couple of years ago, it's tougher.</p><p><strong>Knicks skeptic:</strong> <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.instagram.com/reel/DBG5choA1L8/?hl=en\">Spike said last year</a>, too. And when you consider how teams tend to fare after firing Tom Thibodeau, you may want to walk that back. Thibs elevated the franchise the moment that he arrived, turned Jalen Brunson into a superstar and got the Knicks to the conference finals. You should just hope that they aren't punished too severely for getting rid of him. If this season is derailed by injuries or scandal, you'll know the Thibs Curse is real. You'll be lucky if you ever get to discover how wrong you are about the Cleveland matchup.</p><p><strong>Knicks believer: </strong>I don't believe in curses. I do believe in Brunson and Karl-Anthony Towns and Anunoby and Bridges and the rest of the rotation. I believe, too, that you're going to see a much more cohesive, well-rounded team this year. The wings are going to be more involved in the offense. KAT is going to initiate more actions. <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nba/players/2893469/mitchell-robinson/\">Mitchell Robinson</a> is going to play a lot more than 290 regular-season minutes, and his mere presence will clean up a lot of things defensively.</p>\n<p><strong>Knicks skeptic: </strong>About that: Is Robinson starting? <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://youtu.be/4WurbP4cOqQ?si=GqCu1PVsxeZeecq3&t=175\">Brown has said</a> he wants the Knicks to make other teams feel them defensively, but he has also said he wants to play faster, with the floor spaced. How the coaching staff decides to manage the frontcourt rotation is a huge variable, and it points to some fundamental problems that no coaching staff can change: Their best defensive lineups will feature Robinson at the 5, and their best offensive lineups will feature Towns at the 5. Opponents are going to hunt Brunson and Towns, and playing Towns at the 4 takes away from what makes him so special on offense.</p><p><strong>Knicks believer: </strong>Blah, blah, blah, I heard all of this stuff last year and then the Knicks made the conference finals anyway. Towns made the Western Conference finals the previous year playing a lot of 4, too. Maybe they'll start double-big, maybe they'll start Hart again. Honestly, I wouldn't have a problem with them starting Yabusele or even McBride. In 2025, lineup versatility and depth are important and playing the same five-man unit a zillion minutes is a red flag. Brown is going to look at all sorts of stuff over the course of the season, and that's going to be refreshing. If <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nba/players/26541829/tyler-kolek/\">Tyler Kolek</a> has a strong preseason, he might actually have a chance to crack the rotation!</p><p><strong>Knicks skeptic: </strong>We'll see about all that. You should probably know that Brown drove <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nba/teams/SAC/sacramento-kings/\">Kings</a> fans nuts last year by not giving <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nba/players/3177805/keon-ellis/\">Keon Ellis</a> enough playing time. In fact, before Brown got fired, Sacramento's starters were the <a href=\"https://www.nba.com/stats/lineups/advanced?slug=advanced&DateTo=12%2F26%2F2024&Season=2024-25\" target=\"_blank\">sixth-most-used lineup</a> in the league. I'm sure lots of things about the post-Thibs era are going to seem refreshing at first, but if there's not real, sustained improvement, you'll find yourself missing his gravelly voice, his intensity and even his stubbornness. I'm genuinely curious, for example, if Brown is going to remain committed to getting Brunson off the ball more often. In theory I like the idea, and I always liked when Thibodeau would use him as a screener, but the reality is that the other guys weren't good enough playmakers justify taking the ball out of Brunson's hands regularly. Maybe this will be different now that Brogdon and Jordan Clarkson are on the team, but I'm not sure about that (and, based on his recent injury history, I'm not sure how often Brogdon will even be available). New York had the fifth-best offense in the league last year. If Brown makes the Knicks faster and less predictable, he might also make them turnover-prone, less organized and, ultimately, less efficient. </p>\n            </div>"

He will be the first quarterback to make his first <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://cbssports.com/nfl/\">NFL</a> start outside the United States, according to CBS Sports research.</p><p>The Browns are yet to score more than 17 points in a game this season. Out of 33 qualifying quarterbacks, Flacco ranks last in the NFL in passer rating (60.3), completion rate (58.1%) and yards per attempt (5.1), and 31st in expected points added per play (-0.31). His six interceptions are the second-most picks by a quarterback in the league. Only the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/TEN/tennessee-titans/\">Titans</a> have scored fewer points than the Browns this season.</p>\n<p>In Gabriel, the Browns are turning to a rookie, but one who has played plenty of football. Gabriel, 24, played six years in college at UCF (2019-21), Oklahoma (2022-23) and Oregon (2024). He finished third in 2024 Heisman Trophy voting and led the Ducks to the  <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://cbssports.com/college-football/\">College Football</a> Playoff's No. 1 overall seed. Gabriel's 189 touchdowns accounted for (passing, rushing and receiving) are the most in FBS history, and his 63 career starts are most by a quarterback in FBS history.</p><p>Cleveland selected Gabriel in the third round (94th overall) of the 2025 <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://cbssports.com/nfl/draft/\">NFL Draft</a> and picked Colorado star <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/26710004/shedeur-sanders/\">Shedeur Sanders</a> in the fifth round (144th overall). They joined a quarterback room that eventually swelled to five players on the active roster with Flacco, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/2804969/kenny-pickett/\">Kenny Pickett</a> and <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/3159137/tyler-huntley/\">Tyler Huntley</a>. The Browns also have <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/2133482/deshaun-watson/\">Deshaun Watson</a> on the reserve/physically unable to perform list.</p><p>As the preseason wore on, Gabriel secured his spot at Flacco's primary backup. He completed 13 of 18 passes for 143 yards and an interception in preseason Week 2 against the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/PHI/philadelphia-eagles/\">Eagles</a> and 12 of 19 passes for 129 yards and a touchdowns in preseason Week 3 against the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/LAR/los-angeles-rams/\">Rams</a>. Gabriel has also relieved Flacco at the end of two blowout losses in the regular season. He completed all three of his passes for 19 yards and a touchdown in a 41-17 Week 2 loss to the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/BAL/baltimore-ravens/\">Ravens</a> and had one incomplete pass against the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/DET/detroit-lions/\">Lions</a>.</p>\n<p>Sanders has been listed as an inactive (emergency third quarterback) in all four games this season.</p><h2>What to expect from Dillon Gabriel</h2><p>Gabriel, a lefty, has good if not great mobility for a quarterback, which will be helpful behind a Browns blocking unit that ranks 30th in Pro Football Focus' pass-blocking grades. Here are some excerpts from Chris Trapasso's <span><a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/news/dillon-gabriel-nfl-draft-2025-scouting-report-prospect-outlook-nfl-team-fits-and-more-for-oregon-qb/\" target=\"_blank\">scouting report</a></span>:</p><h3>Strengths</h3><ul><li>\"Gabriel is patient in the pocket. It's his clearest strength on film. Unlike the vast majority of quarterbacks in today's game who flee at the first indication of pressure or when their first read is covered, Gabriel will stand and scan.\"</li><li>\"When he needed to operate outside the pocket, Gabriel has proven to be capable. On those designed rollouts, he demonstrated surprising velocity while throwing on the run with quality.\"</li><li>\"Gabriel's accuracy is a plus, although I can't label him as surgical with his ball placement.\"</li></ul><h3>Weaknesses</h3><ul><li>\"Gabriel's arm is not atrocious. By NFL standards, it'll be average on a good day, and slightly below-average on a bad one. There aren't many times on film when he displayed the ability to really drive a ball through a closing window or stretch a defense vertically more than 25 yards.\"</li><li>\"When everything's operating well within structure, almost all of his passes will be on time and to the correct receiver based on where coverage dictates he should throw the ball. When that's not the case, things can get ugly.\"</li></ul><p>Expect the Browns to at least try to lean more into the run game, especially if game script allows them to. That could be the case against the Vikings' struggling offense. Plus, Minnesota ranks 22nd in yards per rush allowed (4.5). Over the past two weeks, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/28878286/quinshon-judkins/\">Quinshon Judkins</a> has averaged 19.5 carries and 88 rushing yards per game.</p>\n<p>When the Browns do go to the air, expect plenty of quick-hitting passes in an attempt to get Gabriel in a rhythm -- the types of throws he thrived on at Oregon. Judkins, running back <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/2966543/jerome-ford/\">Jerome Ford</a> and tight ends <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/2136474/david-njoku/\">David Njoku</a> and <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/28900882/harold-fannin-jr/\" target=\"_blank\">Harold Fannin Jr.</a> could be early top targets.</p><h2>What does this mean for Shedeur Sanders?</h2><p>At the least, this shows Stefanski's willingness to make a change at the game's most important position. The Browns are not going to contend for a playoff spot this year, and it makes sense for the team to see what it has behind Flacco, who is 40 years old and on a one-year deal.</p><p>That Stefanski made this move this early portends well for Sanders getting his shot at some point this season. When, exactly, that is remains TBD. The Browns will want to give Gabriel a decently long runway. They drafted him with a pick in the top 100, after all, and made him Flacco's primary backup. Coaches will say that they want to win. For all intents and purposes, though, this season is now on player development and assessment -- especially at the game's most important position. The staff needs time to assess Gabriel, and Gabriel deserves time to acclimate to the NFL level.</p>\n<p>Depending on how Gabriel performs, the team could want to see what Sanders can provide, too. Widely perceived as a potential first- or second-round pick, Sanders fell to the fifth round <span><a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/draft/news/did-shedeur-sanders-get-drafted-colorado-qb-shocks-by-falling-past-first-three-rounds-of-nfl-draft-2025/\" target=\"_blank\">due to wide-ranging factors</a></span>. He showed some exciting ups in the preseason -- some \"wow\" throws and other impressive moments -- but also had some struggles that were on display at Colorado, too.</p><p>Still, at this point, there'd be little reason to go back to Flacco if Gabriel's play is untenable or if he gets hurt. The Browns know the level of play Flacco provides. They likely knew that before the season started. Now that they've deemed Gabriel ready to start, Sanders could be next in line as the franchise's seemingly endless search for a long-term answer at quarterback continues.</p><h2>What does this mean for the Browns?</h2><p>Remember, Cleveland holds not only its own first-round pick in 2026, but Jacksonville's as well thanks to the trade that netted the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/JAC/jacksonville-jaguars/\">Jaguars</a> <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/28909849/travis-hunter/\">Travis Hunter</a> with the No. 2 overall pick. The Browns will almost certainly have a look at quarterback, whether it's available with their own pick or via trading up.</p>\n<p>This could also lead to several young players getting more chances. Cleveland has 12 rookies on its active roster, including two at quarterback, three at running back and one each at wide receiver and tight end. Cleveland won't completely abandon its veterans -- it needs to create a viable environment for its young quarterbacks especially -- but the change to Gabriel could be a sign of things to come, roster-wide.</p>\n            </div>"

    "body": "<div>\n        <p>For better or worse, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/teams/CLEM/clemson-tigers/\">Clemson</a> coach Dabo Swinney is the face of <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://cbssports.com/college-football/\">college football's</a> old way of doing things. </p><p>Swinney famously got up in front of reporters and claimed that if the sport started paying players, he'd find something else to do. He has been the most reluctant coach in the sport to embrace NIL and the transfer portal. As recently as two weeks ago, Swinney scoffed at fans complaining about a team that won eight ACC titles in 10 years. </p><p>And yet, Clemson has kept winning -- until now. <span><a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/news/college-football-rankings-why-balanced-preseason-ap-top-25-poll-foreshadows-chaos-ahead-in-2025-season/\" target=\"_blank\">After starting No. 4</a></span> for the first time since 2022, the Tigers started 1-3 for the first time since 2004. A 34-21 loss to <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/teams/CUSE/syracuse-orange/\">Syracuse</a> was Clemson's worst home loss since 2013, and Swinney's worst ever loss at Death Valley to an unranked opponent. </p><p>Following the game, Swinney's struggles have been compared to those of Mike Gundy at <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/teams/OKLAST/oklahoma-state-cowboys/\">Oklahoma State</a>, another all-time great who simply refused to adjust. Gundy, the second-longest tenured coach in college football, was fired last week after an identical 1-3 start. </p>\n<p>But unlike Gundy, there's reasons to believe the tide is turning for Swinney's program. After the historic loss, Swinney <span><a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/news/dabo-swinney-says-clemsons-1-3-start-is-a-coaching-failure-admits-it-starts-with-me/\" target=\"_blank\">stepped to the table</a></span> on Tuesday with his hat in his hand. Instead of stubbornness, Swinney showed humility. And for one of the greatest coaches of the 21st Century, that's the most important step to finding success again. </p><p>\"From a big picture standpoint, it's just been a coaching failure, honestly,\" Swinney said. \"That's the best way I can say it. We have just failed as coaches...</p><p>\"I'm not pointing a finger, I'm pointing a thumb. It starts with me.\"</p><h2>Swinney has grown</h2><p>For years, the same few criticisms have been levied against Swinney: he was reluctant to pay players, he's been too loyal to his assistants and he refuses to use the transfer portal. While there's still room for improvement, Swinney has actually changed in all three areas over the past five years. </p>\n<p>In 2022, after a disappointing season, Swinney fired offensive coordinator Brandon Streeter -- a longtime Clemson assistant and former player. He took a big swing, poaching <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/teams/TCU/tcu-horned-frogs/\">TCU</a> offensive coordinator Garrett Riley fresh off a trip to the national title game. </p><p>Last year, he fired defensive coordinator Wes Goodwin, another longtime Clemson assistant. Clemson poached <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/teams/PSU/penn-state-nittany-lions/\">Penn State</a> defensive coordinator Tom Allen, a former <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/teams/IND/indiana-hoosiers/\">Indiana</a> head coach. Offensive line coach Matt Luke and defensive ends coach Chris Rumph are longtime SEC assistants without Clemson ties. </p><p>His approach to the transfer portal has changed, too. Swinney reeled in elite edge rusher <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/players/29125667/will-heldt/\">Will Heldt</a> from <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/teams/PURDUE/purdue-boilermakers/\">Purdue</a>, who already has six tackles for loss and three sacks through four games. The program added three transfers overall. It wasn't enough, but it was progress. </p>\n<p>And then, there's the money. In 2014, Swinney famously said that if college football moved to a pay-for-play model, he would quit. </p><p>\"That's where you lose me,\" he said then. \"I'll go do something else because there's enough entitlement in this world as there is.\" </p><p>Well, for once, Swinney has not lived up to his word. Clemson announced plans to share revenue at one of the highest levels in college football after last season. The program is set to share nearly 85% of its revenue share with the football team, marking one of the highest numbers in college athletics. </p>\n<p>And frankly, the roster is not the problem. Clemson has the talent. Three players are ranked top 17 in the CBS Sports <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://cbssports.com/nfl/draft/\">NFL Draft</a> Prospect Rankings. <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/draft/news/2026-nfl-mock-draft-after-week-1-of-college-football-season-lsus-garrett-nussmeier-is-qb1-cowboys-get-edge/\">CBS Sports' Ryan Wilson</a> mocked five Clemson players into the first round of the NFL Draft. </p><p>Swinney has been slow to adjust at times, which is frustrating. However, he only needs to tweak his model, not undergo a full-scale transformation. </p><a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/news/college-football-rankings-oregon-rises-to-no-2-as-ole-miss-indiana-join-top-five-in-cbs-sports-136/\" target=\"_blank\">\n        <div>\n            <div>\n                <p>College football rankings: Oregon rises to No. 2 as Ole Miss, Indiana join top five in CBS Sports 136</p>\n                <p>\n                    Chip Patterson                </p>\n            </div>\n                            <div>\n    <figure><img alt=\"College football rankings: Oregon rises to No. 2 as Ole Miss, Indiana join top five in CBS Sports 136\" src=\"https://sportshub.cbsistatic.com/i/r/2025/09/29/77cf1f70-bdf5-4384-9966-fbeae905436c/thumbnail/270x152/447053f4c9022ac85398b8a55bbcb0fe/oregon-136.png\" /></figure>\n                </div>\n                    </div>\n    </a>\n<h2>Tigers' biggest problems</h2><p>Heading into the season, Clemson appeared to be built almost identically to its greatest teams. <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/players/28874636/cade-klubnik/\">Cade Klubnik</a> was projected as a <span><a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/news/college-football-qb-power-rankings-cade-klubnik-drew-allar-top-expanded-preseason-list-of-50-signal-callers/\" target=\"_blank\">potential No. 1 pick at quarterback</a></span>, the defensive line ranked as by far the best in the country and the wide receiver room finally looked ready for its close-up. </p>\n<p>However, a lackluster offensive line room and deficient running back room have cost the Tigers dearly during their 1-3 start. Clemson is leaning on converted wide receiver <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/players/28878514/adam-randall/\">Adam Randall</a> as its top running back, and the Tigers now rank No. 112 nationally with 116 yards rushing per game. Because of the issues running the ball, Clemson ranks No. 97 nationally in both plays per game (64.2) and first downs per game (19.0). </p><p>Klubnik has also been largely mediocre during the run, completing only 60% of his passes at 6.7 yards per attempt with a passer rating of 124.6 -- the worst since his true freshman season. There have been numerous calls for Klubnik to be benched, but backup <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/players/29125664/christopher-vizzina/\">Christopher Vizzina</a> hasn't shown anything at the collegiate level. </p><p>The defense has issues of its own. Despite an elite front and multiple <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://cbssports.com/nfl/\">NFL</a> candidates, the unit ranks No. 58 in yards per play allowed. The group has only improved modestly from a Swinney-worst 5.55 yards per play in 2024.  The bottom really fell out against Syracuse after Clemson held the ball for only eight minutes out of the first 25. A well-timed onside kick proved to be a nail in the coffin for the Tigers. </p>\n<p>Between superstar quarterbacks, elite wide receivers and shifty running backs, Clemson has historically been able to overcome only being a moderate offensive line development program. However, if those talents are harder to find now, Swinney and his staff have to do a better job of compensating elsewhere. </p><p>Their failure to see the holes before they happened left them vulnerable. Swinney has to evaluate his process and see how that happened. </p><p>Some of that may come on the personnel side of things. Swinney is a relentless relational recruiter, but a big picture roster management approach may be necessary in this era. </p>\n<p>According to his bio, Clemson general manager Jordan Sorrells primarily deals with evaluation, communication and logistics between prospects. Head coaches have historically managed the scholarship chart. It may be time for Clemson's GM staff to get more influence in roster construction. </p><h2>Cost not worth it</h2><p>Even if the program wanted to, moving on from Swinney would be a Herculean task. He signed a 10-year, $115 million contract in 2021. If he was fired this year, Swinney would be due $60 million. That's nearly triple any non-Jimbo Fisher buyout in college football history. </p><p>Then Clemson would have to go out and spend big money to hire <em>another </em>quality coaching candidate. When the dust settles, Clemson will have to spend more than $70 million in one year just to move on from Swinney. </p>\n<p>The second Swinney leaves Clemson, the program should build a statue for him. They should probably name the stadium after him as well. Any coach who steps into the aftermath would be facing a daunting task, maybe an impossible one. </p><p>So what would create better return on investment: Swinging $70 million on an unknown, or hoping that an old dog can learn some new tricks with $70 million extra? </p><p>Swinney has grown with the times, even if slowly. There's little question, he's tried to do what he thought was best for the program, not just stewed in his own stubbornness alone. That's part of what made the 1-3 start so difficult for the whole program. </p>\n<p>\"I'm human, I'm not a cyborg,\" Swinney said after the loss to Syracuse. \"This is my life, man. I've been here 23 years, I love this place. I give this place the very best I've got every single day… I also know that we'll get through it. There will be a lot more great days. Nobody wants to hear that in this moment, but that's what drives me, being able to look back at moments in my life and in my career and knowing we got through it, we got better.\"</p><p>Swinney ruffled feathers when he claimed that, at 55, he was only getting started. At the same time, he's not completely wrong. Eight coaches were hired in the 2024-25 coaching cycle that were older than Swinney, including two at the Power Four level. </p><p>Here's the real key: Dabo has to actually believe in a fresh start. But after getting severely humbled by a 1-3 start, he seems closer to getting it than ever before. If Swinney can get back on track, he very well could have another decade of high-level coaching. </p><p>It's time for him to embrace his own new era. </p>\n            </div>"

Jaxson Dart picked up a win in his first start, but the Giants also lost their best offensive player in losing Malik Nabers for the season. New York had just 89 team passing yards on Sunday, while the team averaged 243.3 passing yards with Russell Wilson under center. Even with the boost that Dart provided, New York still struggles immensely on the other side of the ball, ranking 30th in both total defense and run defense.</p><p>It's that run defense which could be an issue in the Superdome as the Saints have a top-10 rushing offense. The Saints are coming off covering versus the Bills in which three different players had at least 49 rushing yards, and New Orleans had 189 yards on the ground as a team. The Saints have also racked up three-plus sacks in three of four games this year, while Dart was taken down five times in his starting debut. The model projects New Orleans to have four QB takedowns as it stifles New York's offense, allowing the Saints to cover at home 60% of the time. <a href=\"https://www.sportsline.com/insiders/nfl-odds-lines-spreads-2025-week-5-picks-predictions-from-proven-model/#ttag=09292025_agg_cbssports_picks_football_nfl_model_Week5nflodds\" target=\"_blank\">See which other teams to pick here</a>.</p>\n<p>Another one of its Week 5 NFL predictions: Cardinals (-9.5 41.5) cover versus Tennessee in over 50% of simulations. Arizona will have some extra rest after playing last Thursday, and no one has performed better versus the spread against non-conference opponents. The Cardinals have covered in seven straight games versus the AFC, while Tennessee is 0-6 ATS versus the NFC since the start of last season. The Titans have dropped three straight overall versus the spread, meaning they've picked up where they left off last year as their 3-18 spread record since 2024 is the worst in the NFL.</p><p>Tennessee was shut out, 26-0, by the previously winless Texans on Sunday, as the Titans have lost 10 straight games overall. They rank last in both points scored and yards gained, while sitting 26th in points allowed and yards allowed. Arizona has the No. 5 scoring defense and the No. 8 run defense, which could make the Titans overly rely on top pick Cam Ward. However, he just posted both his lowest passer rating and completion percentage as he's yet to throw a touchdown in two road starts. The model also says the Over hits nearly 70% of the time. <a href=\"https://www.sportsline.com/insiders/nfl-odds-lines-spreads-2025-week-5-picks-predictions-from-proven-model/#ttag=09292025_agg_cbssports_picks_football_nfl_model_Week5nflodds\" target=\"_blank\">See which other teams to pick here</a>.</p>\n<h3>How to make Week 5 NFL picks</h3><p>The model has also made the call on who wins and covers in every other game on the Week 5 NFL schedule and just revealed four coveted A-rated spread picks, potentially giving you a huge payday. <a href=\"https://www.sportsline.com/insiders/nfl-odds-lines-spreads-2025-week-5-picks-predictions-from-proven-model/#ttag=09292025_agg_cbssports_picks_football_nfl_model_Week5nflodds\" target=\"_blank\">You can only get every pick for every game at SportsLine</a>.</p><p><strong>So what Week 5 NFL picks can you make with confidence, and which four teams should you lock in now?

UFC light heavyweight champion Magomed Ankalaev and Alex Pereira run it back, plus Merab Dvalishvili and Cory Sandhagen clash for the bantamweight title. The undercard has gems, too.</p><p>Here are six words to get your heart pumping: Jiri Prochazka vs. Khalil Rountree Jr. This surefire banger is part of an interesting blend of <span><a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/boxing/news/ufc-320-fight-card-magomed-ankalaev-vs-alex-pereira-2-five-biggest-storylines-to-watch-in-las-vegas/\" target=\"_blank\">UFC 320 storylines</a></span>. Saturday's pay-per-view offers sheer violence, crossroads fights and second chances. Saturday's pay-per-view is arguably one of the deepest this year. </p><p>Ahead of UFC 320, take a closer look at three undercard fights worthy of your attention.</p><h2>Jiri Prochazka vs. Khalil Rountree Jr.</h2><p>Someone will certainly leave this fight $50,000 richer. Prochazka vs. Rountree screams Fight of the Night or Performance of the Night. Both men are coming off wins against former UFC light heavyweight champion Jamahal Hill, where they showed improved decision-making. Prochazka is violence personified. The former UFC champion is statistically one of the sport's most dangerous finishers, stopping 30 opponents in 31 wins. While Rountree isn't quite as dangerous a finisher, he's the superior technical striker. Rountree gave Alex Pereira a tough time early in their title fight and showed tremendous heart. By contrast, \"Poatan\" easily dissected Prochazka in their two fights. Prochaka's \"live by the sword, die by the sword\" mentality almost always guarantees a finish. And for that, we're grateful.</p>\n<h2>Josh Emmett vs. Youssef Zalal </h2><p>Emmett vs. Zalal is great crossroads matchmaking. Longtime contender Emmett is a juggernaut. He has power in his hands and an indomitable will. His 2023 KO of Bryce Mitchell is one of the <span><a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mma/news/ufc-296-results-highlights-josh-emmett-delivers-late-knockout-of-the-year-contender-against-bryce-mitchell/\" target=\"_blank\">scariest one-punch knockouts</a></span> ever. He lasted five brutal rounds against Ilia Topuria, and Emmett's one KO loss left him with multiple facial fractures. That being said, Emmett is 40 and has lost three of his last four fights. Challenging for an interim featherweight title is as close as he'll come to being champion. Zalal's comeback story is inspiring. He was released from the UFC after a four-fight winless stretch that included a decision loss to current lightweight champion Topuria. Zalal reinvented himself on the regional scene, finishing three opponents to earn a second chance in the big leagues. Zalal is 4-0 since coming back, including three stoppages and a win over Calvin Kattar that put him in the UFC's official featherweight top 10. For Emmett, a win is crucial for relevancy. For Zalal, a win springboards him into the big leagues. </p><h2>Patchy Mix vs. Jakub Wiklacz</h2><p>Mix completely imploded in his UFC debut. Mix talked a big game heading into UFC 316, but Mario Bautista made him look like a rookie. The former Bellator bantamweight champion fell painfully short of personal expectations and the expectations of analysts. However, he wouldn't be the first Bellator champion to change their fortunes after a failed UFC debut. Eddie Alvarez lost his UFC intro to Donald Cerrone before later becoming the lightweight champ. Patricio Pitbull recently bounced back after losing to Yair Rodriguez. </p><p>Mix clearly wasn't ready for the bantamweight elite, but he could breathe new life into his career by beating Wiklacz. The Polish fighter is undefeated in seven fights. Wiklacz enters the UFC off a successful KSW bantamweight title defense, where he earned a Submission of the Night and Fight of the Night bonus after choking his opponent unconscious. This bantamweight title presents a second chance for Mix, while giving another intriguing prospect the platform for a thrilling debut. </p>\n<p><strong>Honorable mention: </strong>Abus Magomedov vs. Joe Pyfer</p>\n            </div>"

    "body": "<div>\n        <p>The NFL can feel random at times as evidenced by the Carolina Panthers' results in 2025. After a 26-10 blowout loss in Jacksonville, the Panthers rallied from a large deficit in the fourth quarter to fall in Arizona, 27-22 in Week 2. Then they followed that up with a crushing 30-0 home win against Atlanta, who was coming off an upset win in Minnesota the week before. In Week 4, Carolina was back to their losing ways, this time in New England, who trounced the Panthers 42-13. Can the Panthers beat the Dolphins in Week 5 as 1.5-point home favorites?
