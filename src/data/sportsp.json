Silva was facing former two-division world champion Acelino Freitas in an exhibition fight at Spaten Fight Night 2 in Sao Paulo, Brazil when he was disqualified after a clearly intentional headbutt.</p><p>Exhibition boxing often looks like little more than a glorified sparring match. Bouts between former MMA and boxing stars became a frequent staple of the peak of the COVID-19 pandemic.</p><p>Rather than the standard easy approach to such a fight, Silva appeared to grow increasingly frustrated as Freitas, who retired from professional competition in 2017 with a career record of 41-2 with 34 knockouts, was clearly the superior boxer.</p>\n<p>At one point, Silva pinned Freitas in the corner and ignored the referee's instructions to separate, leading to a point deduction. Just a few minutes later, Silva launched his head into Freitas' and lost a second point. It didn't take much longer before Silva had been disqualified from the exhibition.</p><p>After the fight, both teams were in the ring when shoving began. Silva was struck with a blow from behind from what appeared to be a Freitas team member. The chaos continued to build before someone landed a sweeping right hand to Silva's chin, sending the MMA legend crashing to the canvas unconscious.</p>\n<p>Silva was a former PRIDE middleweight champion and competed in the UFC both prior to and after his storied run in the Japanese promotion. A fan favorite for his wild brawling style, Silva retired as a member of the Bellator roster in 2018 with a record of 35-14-1. He was inducted into the UFC Hall of Fame as a part of the Pioneer Wing in 2024.</p>\n            </div>\n    </div>"

    "body": "<div>\n        <p><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/teams/BAMA/alabama-crimson-tide/\">Alabama</a> remains Kirby Smart's unsolvable riddle. Even on a night when he dialed up masterful adjustments, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/teams/UGA/georgia-bulldogs/\">Georgia</a> once again stumbled headlong into the same familiar Tide trap.</p><p>The No. 5 Bulldogs' 24-21 loss Saturday night in Athens was all too familiar for the coach who continues to stumble whenever he tries to outrun the Alabama tidal wave. Smart's 55-2 record against everyone else over the last five years is staggering, but the 1-4 mark against Alabama -- now featuring back-to-back losses to Kalen DeBoer -- is the stat that defines him.</p><p>And yet, Smart and defensive coordinator Glenn Schumann made tremendous adjustments at halftime after falling behind 24-14. The Bulldogs held No. 17 Alabama scoreless in the second half and limited the Tide to 135 yards and only 2.7 yards per rush in the final two frames after giving up 262 yards and eight third-down conversions in the first half.</p><p>And Georgia still lost -- and watched its 33-game home winning streak melt away.</p><p>Smart also couldn't overcome his own missteps with a series of head-scratching play calls on offense and a defensive front that failed to generate push.</p>\n<p>Even if coordinator Mike Bobo made the decisions to lean on running back <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/players/26738725/cash-jones/\">Cash Jones</a> in two crucial fourth-quarter situations, Smart owns this one. The calls were costly. Jones was thrown into the fire twice and burned both times -- stuffed for a three-yard loss on a fourth-and-1 at Alabama's 8, then dragged down for a four-yard loss on third-and-9 near midfield.</p><p>The most maddening moment? Georgia passed up a chip-shot field goal that would have tied the game with 13:20 left. Instead, Smart rolled the dice behind two freshman blockers, and Alabama's <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/players/28923635/lt-overton/\">LT Overton</a> buried Jones for a turnover on downs.</p><p>Four games into the season, Georgia's defense looks unable to replicate the elite dominance of the early 2020s -- and it might even be worse than last year's unit that frustrated fans.</p>\n<p>The defensive front is a shell of its old self, often shoved backward in the run game or drifting upfield on pass plays. The Dawg Pound is far from the menace that once defined Smart's dynasty.</p><p>The Bulldogs entered Saturday dead last in the SEC in tackles for loss, averaging just 4.7 per game. They managed only four against the Tide. They also sacked <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/players/28878532/ty-simpson/\">Ty Simpson</a> only once, cementing their spot as the league's second-worst pass-rushing defense at 1.7 sacks per game. Junior <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/players/29122458/jordan-hall/\">Jordan Hall</a> was the lone lineman to record a stop behind the line. Georgia's defensive front has just four TFLs through four games.</p><p>Georgia should be better in the trenches.</p><p>Credit Alabama offensive coordinator Ryan Grubb for out-scheming Smart and Schumann early. The Tide piled up yards with a handful of big plays and were methodical with extended drives, scoring on back-to-back 14-play possessions while converting eight third downs to open a 14-0 lead.</p>\n<p>How bad was it? Georgia hadn't allowed more than three drives of 14-plus plays in an entire season since 2018.</p><p>And yet, there were glimpses of promise. Alabama managed only 60 yards in the third quarter. In the fourth, the Tide produced 75 yards -- just enough to ice the game -- aided by <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/players/29389817/ellis-robinson-iv/\">Ellis Robinson IV's</a> unsportsmanlike penalty for jumping on top of the pile after a third-and-1 conversion with 2:27 left.</p><p>Georgia lost three games last season because of its inability to run the football, finishing 102nd nationally in rushing and out-gained on the ground in each defeat. That problem seemed corrected this year, with the Bulldogs ranking in the top 30 and out-rushing Alabama 227-130 on Saturday.</p>\n<p>The new, glaring weakness is undeniable: Georgia no longer owns the trenches. What used to be Smart's crown jewel is now his biggest liability.</p>\n            </div>"

Ulberg was the man who delivered the message, scoring a brutal first-round knockout in Perth, Australia.</p><p>The first round was fought at a fairly slow pace, with Reyes especially hesitant to pull the trigger. Ulberg was able to connect with leg kicks and the occasional punch as the fighters seemed to be feeling each other out. Still, the sense was building that Ulberg was in control of the action with Reyes looking uncertain of when to throw his own strikes.</p><p>Ulberg landed a hard jab followed by a right hand to the chin that dropped Reyes to the canvas. Ulberg followed Reyes to the canvas and landed two hard punches that removed Reyes from his senses and forced the referee to jump in and call a halt to the action at the 4:27 mark of Round 1.</p>\n<p>After the fight, Ulberg made it clear that he wanted to be put in position to face the winner of the Oct. 4 bout between Ankalaev and Pereira.</p>\n<p>\"That's exactly what we wanted,\" Ulberg said. \"I just spoke to [UFC chief business officer] Hunter [Campbell] and we're going to be talking about something. Fly me to Vegas so I can watch those guys fight.\"</p><p>With the win, Ulberg ran his winning streak to nine, with six of those wins coming by stoppage. Having entered the fight No. 3 in the UFC's official light heavyweight rankings, it's hard to deny his place as the next man up.</p><p>After losing a wildly controversial decision to then-light heavyweight champion Jon Jones at UFC 247, Reyes fell on hard times, dropping three consecutive fights by knockout. While Reyes was counted out by many, he rebounded with three consecutive knockouts to climb back up the rankings and earn a fight with Ulberg that could have catapulted him to another shot at the title.</p>\n<p>Unfortunately for Reyes, and fortunately for Ulberg, it was the New Zealander's night.</p>\n            </div>\n    </div>"

Starting his career a perfect 12-0, Reyes beat dominant UFC light heavyweight champion Jon Jones in the eyes of just about everyone but the three judges scoring it. Reyes' stock went up in a controversial loss to the champ, but he failed to capitalize on it. Reyes was knocked out in his subsequent fights, each faster than the last, sending his career into free fall. After taking 19 months off, Reyes remedied things with three KO wins. Now, he's on the cusp of another title shot.</p><p>\"I've matured incredibly as a fighter,\" Reyes told CBS Sports' Brian Campbell. \"My approach is completely different, and my stress is far less. I don't worry about every little thing. I know I don't need to be great in every training session. I need to be great on Fight Night. </p><p>\"I'm not back, I'm better. It's crazy that I'm getting better every single day. It's a trippy thing to see. I've been in the UFC for nine years, and I'm getting better every day. I look at myself as a younger fighter and think, 'Damn, I would've smoked that kid.'\"</p>\n<p><strong><em>Check out the full interview with Dominick Reyes below.</em></strong>  </p>\n<p>Ulberg vs. Reyes is a fun main event, but that's about all there is to look forward to as far as storylines. Perth's main card is packed with Oceanic fighters.

Ulberg and Reyes are strikers with KO power and solid fight IQ. They have comparable striking offense, striking defense, and takedown defense stats. Ulberg has shown more offensive takedown success, but it's negligible. Unable to identify the more skilled fighter, we'll instead examine their liabilities. Reyes' comeback is inspiring, but weathered chins don't heal easily. Beating Dustin Jacoby, Anthony Smith, and Nikita Krylov doesn't do much to ease those concerns. Ulberg has serious power and has taken less damage. That's enough for me to think he'll get the KO in 25 minutes, even if I'm concerned about Ulberg's lack of five-round experience or stoppage wins past Round 1. <strong><em>Ulberg via KO2</em></strong></p>\n            </div>"

Although it was a no-call since the tip was clean, it was still an unfortunate situation and emotions were high after the game.

Who should you back and who should you be fading? CBS Sports writers Jordan Dajani and Steven Taranto are here to break down the biggest games of the weekend. Odds for these selections are from <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/betting/news/fanduel-promo-code/\">FanDuel Sportsbook</a>, where new users can <a href=\"https://martech.cbssports.com/bt/redirect/prod?b=fanduel&c=sport\" target=\"_blank\">get $300 in bonus bets</a>:</p><h2><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/SEA/seattle-seahawks/\">Seattle Seahawks</a> (-1.5) at <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/ARI/arizona-cardinals/\">Arizona Cardinals</a> (TNF)</h2>\n<p><strong>Dajani (Seahawks -1.5): </strong>The Seahawks, who have won seven straight meetings vs. the Cardinals, dropped a whopping 38 points on the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/NO/new-orleans-saints/\">New Orleans Saints</a> in just the first half last week. Yes, I know it was the Saints, but that was still very impressive. The Cardinals, on the other hand, average 276.3 yards of total offense per game, which is behind teams like the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/CAR/carolina-panthers/\">Carolina Panthers</a> and Browns, and <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/2180829/kyler-murray/\">Kyler Murray</a> just lost <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/2071585/james-conner/\">James Conner</a> to a season-ending injury. Seattle is 6-1 against the spread in its past seven matchups vs. Arizona, so I'll take them. <strong><em>Prediction: </em></strong><em>Seahawks 23, Cardinals 21</em></p><p><strong>Taranto (Seahawks -1.5):</strong> Arizona is in an unenviable position here, having to play another game just four days after a gut-punch loss to the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/SF/san-francisco-49ers/\">49ers</a> highlighted by continued issues with drops for <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/26701883/marvin-harrison-jr/\">Marvin Harrison Jr</a>. and a gruesome season-ending injury to running back James Conner. It's bad timing for the Cardinals to now run into the Seahawks, who are coming off two wins in a row, including a 44-13 beatdown of the Saints, and have won seven straight road games dating back to Week 7 of 2024. Speaking of seven, that's the amount of consecutive wins Seattle lords over Arizona dating back to the end of the 2021 season. <strong><em>Prediction: </em></strong><em>Seahawks 27, Cardinals 20</em></p>\n<p><em>Editor's Note: The Seahawks won 23-20. This post has been updated since this game concluded.</em></p><h2><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/MIN/minnesota-vikings/\">Minnesota Vikings</a> (-2.5) at <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/PIT/pittsburgh-steelers/\">Pittsburgh Steelers</a> (Ireland)</h2>\n<p><strong>Dajani (Vikings -2.5):</strong> I'm all in on <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/1907522/carson-wentz/\">Carson Wentz</a> creating a quarterback controversy in Minnesota, and this Vikings team whooped the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/CIN/cincinnati-bengals/\">Cincinnati Bengals</a> so bad last week I think they've been relegated to the UFL. The Steelers needed the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/NE/new-england-patriots/\">New England Patriots</a> to turn the ball over five times to win their Week 3 matchup, as <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/419780/aaron-rodgers/\">Aaron Rodgers</a> and Co. haven't looked good since the season opener. Did you know the Vikings are 4-0 in international games? Now you do. <strong><em>Prediction:</em></strong><em> Vikings 16, Steelers 12</em></p><p><strong>Taranto (Steelers +2.5):</strong> Kevin O'Connell has sprinkled pixie dust on yet another quarterback written off as damaged goods, as Carson Wentz turned in a performance that turned back the clock to his early days on the Eagles in a 48-10 win over the Bengals. But the offense's performance was complemented by an outstanding defensive performance with multiple touchdowns by Brian Flores' unit, which isn't sustainable against a team like the Steelers that isn't down its backup quarterback and enters this game on the strength of a 2-1 record. A relatively neutral site of a game on foreign soil (the Rooney family's deep ties to Ireland notwithstanding) might be preferable to having to play in Pittsburgh itself, but I don't think that's going to be enough to keep the Wentz Wagon revival rolling. <strong><em>Prediction: </em></strong><em>Steelers 24, Vikings 10</em></p>\n<h2>Philadelphia Eagles (-3.5) at Tampa Bay Buccaneers</h2>\n<p><strong>Dajani (Eagles -3.5):</strong> The Buccaneers are undefeated, 4-1 against <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/2240246/jalen-hurts/\">Jalen Hurts</a>, playing at home AND getting the hook at +3.5? Seems like an auto-bet, right? No! It's a trap. <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/2080032/baker-mayfield/\">Baker Mayfield</a> has lost two starting offensive linemen, and wide receiver <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/1824909/mike-evans/\">Mike Evans</a> has been ruled out with a hamstring injury. <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/2185957/saquon-barkley/\">Saquon Barkley</a> hasn't looked like an MVP candidate through three games, but that's fine. I'm looking at <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/2258303/a-j-brown/\">A.J. Brown</a> to be a factor in this one. He had 109 receiving yards just in the second half last week. <strong><em>Prediction: </em></strong><em>Eagles 27, Buccaneers 23</em></p><p><strong>Taranto (Buccaneers +3.5):</strong> Sometimes, history is just too much to overcome. The Bucs will always be able to boast that Ronde Barber shut down The Vet in the 2002 NFC Championship Game against the Eagles, and this generation of Eagles -- for all their dominance otherwise -- struggles against this current iteration of Tampa Bay football. The Buccaneers have handed the Eagles two playoff losses in the past five years, and beat them like a drum in their last regular season matchup around this time a year ago. All of those games were played in Tampa, making Raymond James Stadium a house of horrors for Jalen Hurts & Co., who are currently winning more on sheer talent than they are on ingenuity or creativity on offense. <strong><em>Prediction: </em></strong><em>Buccaneers 28, Eagles 16</em></p><h2><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/IND/indianapolis-colts/\">Indianapolis Colts</a> at Los Angeles Rams (-3.5)</h2>\n<p><strong>Dajani (Rams -3.5): </strong>The Colts are 3-0 ATS while the Rams are 2-1 ATS. The hook looks attractive, but the Rams are easily the best team the Colts have played thus far. I'm worried about Indy's secondary after the Colts lost <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/2818965/kenny-moore/\">Kenny Moore</a> to injury, and <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/1996158/deforest-buckner/\">DeForest Buckner</a> missed practice Wednesday due to a back injury. Here's the key stat to know: 3-0 teams as underdogs vs. non 3-0 teams are 1-10 ATS since 2014. Crazy, right? <strong><em>Prediction: </em></strong><em>Rams 30, Colts 24</em></p>\n<p><strong>Taranto (Colts +3.5):</strong> Those who have wanted to rationalize <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/2179245/daniel-jones/\">Daniel Jones</a> playing like one of the best quarterbacks in the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://cbssports.com/nfl/\">NFL</a> to start the season have cited how his outstanding performances have come against lesser competition, namely the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/MIA/miami-dolphins/\">Dolphins</a> and <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/TEN/tennessee-titans/\">Titans</a>, whose head coaches are both on the brink. That won't be the case against the Rams, but the Rams completely blowing it against the Eagles last week is surely a blow to that team's psyche. Now, they're up against a Colts team with all the confidence in the world -- and a quarterback who is now doing all the things everyone in New York said he couldn't do. <strong><em>Prediction: </em></strong><em>Colts 24, Rams 17</em></p><a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/news/agents-take-2025-contract-year-players-to-watch-could-daniel-jones-become-the-next-30-million-qb/\" target=\"_blank\">\n        <div>\n            <div>\n                <p>Agent's Take: 2025 contract-year players to watch -- could Daniel Jones become the next $30 million QB?</p>\n                <p>\n                    Joel Corry                </p>\n            </div>\n                            <div>\n    <figure><img alt=\"Agent's Take: 2025 contract-year players to watch -- could Daniel Jones become the next $30 million QB?\" src=\"https://sportshub.cbsistatic.com/i/r/2025/09/24/965b56fd-1b2d-4852-ad49-7af5c9791a63/thumbnail/270x152/19b540b927959d3935ab6e2735d63ca2/daniel-joens.jpg\" /></figure>\n                </div>\n                    </div>\n    </a>\n<h2><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/BAL/baltimore-ravens/\">Baltimore Ravens</a> (-2.5) at <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/KC/kansas-city-chiefs/\">Kansas City Chiefs</a></h2>\n<p><strong>Dajani (Chiefs +2.5):</strong> The Ravens were simply outplayed by a talented offense that took advantage of the fact that Baltimore was missing three important starters on defense.

He's 5-1 all time against Lamar Jackson, so I'll take the Chiefs at plus money. <strong><em>Prediction: </em></strong><em>Chiefs 26, Ravens 23</em></p><p><strong>Taranto (Ravens -2.5):</strong> This is a matchup based on reputation and not on the actual state of each of these two teams. The Chiefs got their first win of the season in Week 3, but they didn't exactly hang a number on a lousy <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/NYG/new-york-giants/\">Giants</a> team and Steve Spagnuolo's defense didn't have to do anything especially creative to stymie a deep-ball-or-nothing Giants offense. The Ravens are 1-2 on account of how in both games they've played against good competition, their defense hasn't been able to stop anyone. The difference is that compared to the Chiefs, the Ravens can score, as they've put up at least 30 points in each of their three games so far this year. <strong><em>Prediction: </em></strong><em>Ravens 27, Chiefs 20</em></p>\n<h2>Green Bay Packers (-6.5) at <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/DAL/dallas-cowboys/\">Dallas Cowboys</a> (SNF)</h2>\n<p><strong>Dajani (Packers -6.5):</strong> The Packers completely bungled that matchup vs. the Browns, but they are set up for a rebound performance in Dallas. This Cowboys defense is terrible. They rank bottom six in yards allowed per game (397.7) and points allowed per game (30.7). Over the past two games, the Cowboys secondary has allowed quarterbacks to complete 71% of their throws for 360 yards per game, seven touchdowns and one interception. Plus, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/2865251/ceedee-lamb/\">CeeDee Lamb</a> is expected to be out due to his high ankle sprain. Yikes. Matt LaFleur is 22-11-1 ATS in prime-time games -- the best cover percentage by a head coach since 2000. His team covered vs. Washington on \"Thursday Night Football\" a couple weeks ago, and will do so again on Sunday night. <strong><em>Prediction: </em></strong><em>Packers 27, Cowboys 17</em></p><p><strong>Taranto (Packers -6.5):</strong> This is a classic revenge game where the chickens come home to roost. With the Cowboys' trade of Micah Parsons leaving them without any real threat of a pass rush, their secondary hasn't been able to be as aggressive as they've been in the past, and now they can't cover a soul. Dallas' defensive performances against offensively-challenged Giants and <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/CHI/chicago-bears/\">Bears</a> teams bode very poorly for them against the Packers, who have always been a well-oiled machine on offense and who have always been a terrible matchup for Dallas in particular. Add CeeDee Lamb's injury to the mix, and <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/1824864/dak-prescott/\">Dak Prescott</a>'s individual heroics might not be enough to save the Cowboys from the consequences of Jerry Jones hardballing his best player in contract negotiations to the point of alienating him. <strong><em>Prediction: </em></strong><em>Packers 41, Cowboys 13</em></p><h2>New York Jets at Miami Dolphins (-2.5) (MNF)</h2>\n<p><strong>Dajani (Dolphins -2.5): </strong>The Dolphins showed some fight against the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/BUF/buffalo-bills/\">Buffalo Bills</a> last week. Mike McDaniel is coaching for his job, and he can still beat lesser teams with speed. The Jets should be a popular upset pick this week, but the Dolphins got quite the mini-bye having played last Thursday night. <strong><em>Prediction: </em></strong><em>Dolphins 17, Jets 13</em></p>\n<p><strong>Taranto (Jets +2.5):</strong> It's easy to bite on the \"Same Old Jets\" narrative, but this particular iteration of Gang Green strikes me as a little different from years' past. While Week 2 offered more of the same in terms of the Jets looking completely hapless and incompetent, their other two games this year have both been rip-your-heart-out losses decided by being on the wrong end of a late field goal. The Dolphins may be coming off a competitive effort against the Bills that stabilized the situation surrounding embattled coach Mike McDaniel, but if the Jets can manage to get on Miami early, I think they might be able to frustrate them and make them quit. <strong><em>Prediction: </em></strong><em>Jets 23, Dolphins 10</em></p><h2>Cincinnati Bengals at Denver Broncos (-7.5) (MNF)</h2>\n<p><strong>Dajani (Broncos -7.5):</strong> I've been a sucker for the Broncos this year. They covered for me in Week 1, lost to the Colts on a bogus penalty in Week 2 and then gave away a fourth-quarter lead to <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/2221960/justin-herbert/\">Justin Herbert</a> and the Chargers on Sunday. I went back and watched the film on <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/3121193/bo-nix/\">Bo Nix</a>; his mechanics look off, as he missed three would-be deep-shot touchdowns. I still have faith in him. After all, he is 3-0 following a two-game losing streak, with the Broncos outscoring opponents 102-13 in those games. This Denver squad needs a good game against a team coming off a 48-10 loss to Carson Wentz. <strong><em>Prediction: </em></strong><em>Broncos 30, Bengals 20</em></p><p><strong>Taranto (Broncos -7.5):</strong> I'm going to echo what Jordan said here in that I lack confidence in Bo Nix, but feel fairly good about the rest of the Broncos as a whole. Denver is always a tough place to play for visiting teams, especially one dealing with as much adversity now as the Bengals currently are. Even if <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/2180355/jake-browning/\">Jake Browning</a> gets off the mat after last week, it's going to take a Herculean effort for him to get the best of Sean Payton. <strong><em>Prediction: </em></strong><em>Broncos 34, Bengals 17</em></p>\n            </div>"

The Astros were eliminated from postseason contention on Saturday when the Tigers and Guardians claimed the final two berths on the American League bracket, snapping the fourth-longest playoff streak in Major League Baseball history. Houston's October residence yielded two World Series championships, seven division titles and consecutive trips to at least the League Championship Series, and <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/news/mlb-hammers-astros-in-cheating-scandal-jeff-luhnow-aj-hinch-suspended-then-fired-draft-picks-lost/\">an unquantifiable</a> <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/news/astros-fire-assistant-gm-brandon-taubman-following-inappropriate-comment-toward-female-reporters/\">amount of controversy</a>. </p><p>Over that stretch, the Astros <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/news/astros-sign-stealing-scandal-gm-jeff-luhnow-was-aware-of-codebreaker-algorithm-report-says/\">bid adieu to several</a> <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/news/astros-and-general-manager-james-click-are-going-their-separate-ways-after-winning-world-series/\">top executives</a>, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/news/dusty-baker-partially-blames-bloggers-and-tweeters-for-retirement-tired-of-the-scrutiny/\">managers</a>, and numerous stars (most recently outfielder <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/players/2184352/kyle-tucker/\">Kyle Tucker</a> and third baseman <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/players/2184351/alex-bregman/\">Alex Bregman</a>). <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/news/whats-next-for-astros-four-reasons-why-loss-vs-rangers-could-be-beginning-of-end-for-teams-al-dynasty/\">Other front offices predicting Houston's imminent decline became a winter tradition</a>. Yet the Astros would invalidate those forecasts each spring into summer before then adding an exclamation point in the fall. </p><h3>Longest playoff streaks in <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://cbssports.com/mlb/\">MLB</a> history</h3><table><tbody><tr><th>Team</th><th>Years</th><th>Seasons</th><th>World Series wins</th></tr><tr><td><p><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/teams/ATL/atlanta-braves/\">Atlanta Braves</a></p></td><td><p>1991-2005</p></td><td><p>14</p></td><td><p>1</p></td></tr><tr><td><p><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/teams/LAD/los-angeles-dodgers/\">Los Angeles Dodgers</a></p></td><td><p>2013-2025 (active)</p></td><td><p>13</p></td><td><p>2</p></td></tr><tr><td><p><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/teams/NYY/new-york-yankees/\">New York Yankees</a></p></td><td><p>1995-2007</p></td><td><p>13</p></td><td><p>4</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Houston Astros</p></td><td><p>2017-2024</p></td><td><p>8</p></td><td><p>2</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Atlanta Braves</p></td><td><p>2018-2024</p></td><td><p>7</p></td><td><p>1</p></td></tr></tbody></table><p>That won't be the case this year, as the Astros will get to experience playoff baseball from their couches along with most of the league. Nevertheless, the Astros did manage to subvert the industry's forecasts one last time by failing in an unexpected way. See, other front offices usually pinned their gloomy Astros projections on a farm system weakened by years of late (or forfeited) draft picks and win-now trades, as well as the creeping instructions of owner Jim Crane. </p><p>What actually did the Astros in, this version of them anyway, had nothing to do with the above and everything to do with an outright infestation of the injury bug.</p><p><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.baseballprospectus.com/baseball-prospectus-injured-list-ledger/\">According to Baseball Prospectus' database</a>, no team lost more projected Wins Above Replacement to the injured list than the Astros (nearly 13). Only one other club (the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/teams/BAL/baltimore-orioles/\">Baltimore Orioles</a>) cleared even 12 WAR. Furthermore, the Astros and Los Angeles Dodgers were the two teams that lost more than 2,000 individual player games to the shelf. </p><p>The Astros simply couldn't withstand having so many injuries stack up simultaneously.  Even now, they're without what amounts to a full rotation (<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/players/29075773/spencer-arrighetti/\">Spencer Arrighetti</a>, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/players/2821587/ronel-blanco/\">Ronel Blanco</a>, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/players/2862994/luis-garcia/\">Luis Garcia</a>, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/players/26911750/brandon-walter/\">Brandon Walter</a>, and <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/players/26911738/hayden-wesneski/\">Hayden Wesneski</a>) and most of a bullpen (closer <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/players/2044482/josh-hader/\">Josh Hader</a>, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/players/2001084/lance-mccullers/\">Lance McCullers</a> Jr., <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/players/2842935/kaleb-ort/\">Kaleb Ort</a>, and <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/players/2837541/bennett-sousa/\">Bennett Sousa</a>). </p><p>Not to be excluded, the Astros' positional player crop was also damaged early and often. They received just 48 games from slugger <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/players/2507341/yordan-alvarez/\">Yordan Alvarez</a>. The left side of the infield, third baseman <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/players/2910610/isaac-paredes/\">Isaac Paredes</a> (two months with a hamstring) and shortstop Jeremy Peña ( a month with a rib) both missed stretches, and outfielders <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/players/2837198/chas-mccormick/\">Chas McCormick</a>, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/players/2449436/taylor-trammell/\">Taylor Trammell</a>, and <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/players/2837229/jake-meyers/\">Jake Meyers</a> were absent for at least seven weeks apiece. And so on and so forth.</p><h3>Key Astros players to miss time because of injury</h3><table><tbody><tr><th>Player</th><th>Position</th><th>Days missed</th></tr><tr><td><p>Luis Garcia</p></td><td><p>RHP</p></td><td><p>175+</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Spencer Arrighetti</p></td><td><p>RHP</p></td><td><p>148+</p></td></tr><tr><td><p><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/players/2910637/cristian-javier/\">Cristian Javier</a></p></td><td><p>RHP</p></td><td><p>137</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Ronel Blanco</p></td><td><p>RHP</p></td><td><p>130+</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Yordan Alvarez</p></td><td><p>DH/OF</p></td><td><p>120+</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Isaac Paredes</p></td><td><p>3B</p></td><td><p>61</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Jake Meyers</p></td><td><p>OF</p></td><td><p>58</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Chas McCormick</p></td><td><p>OF</p></td><td><p>49</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Josh Hader</p></td><td><p>LHP</p></td><td><p>47+</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Jeremy Peña</p></td><td><p>SS</p></td><td><p>34</p></td></tr></tbody></table><p>The Dodgers, to their credit, were able to weather the tides and clinch a playoff berth behind their nearly unmatched depth and supply of critical redundancies. It's worth noting that they didn't have their normally strong season, however; they weren't in serious contention for a first-round bye or for 95-plus wins for the first time in a full season since 2018. </p><p>Granted, it wasn't just the injury bug that wrecked Houston's season. Free-agent signing <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/players/2044379/christian-walker/\">Christian Walker</a> had a disappointing first season in town, while second baseman <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/players/1839905/jose-altuve/\">Jose Altuve</a> had his worst full-season showing since 2013. Young backstop <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/players/2829012/yainer-diaz/\">Yainer Diaz</a> didn't take the step forward the Astros may have desired, and rookie outfielder <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/players/29426043/cam-smith/\">Cam Smith</a> -- part of the return on Tucker -- had his moments but was a clear downgrade when compared to his predecessor. </p><p>General manager Dana Brown made three trade additions throughout July, netting infielders <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/players/2000028/carlos-correa/\">Carlos Correa</a> and Ramón Urías and outfielder Jesús Sánchez. Correa's homecoming provided the Astros with well-above-average offense. Urías and Sánchez, not so much, with Sánchez's underperformance proving particularly harmful given the oft-tattered state of Houston's outfield.</p><p>Still, throughout it all, the Astros found themselves in first place in the AL West as recently as Sept. 17 and in contention until the final weekend. Given the larger circumstances at play, it's probably more fair than not to write that this club overperformed. </p><p>At the same time, the Astros' recent track record allows no room for moral victories and the front office has its share of questions to answer right off the bat this winter. Not just concerning how they avoid being ravaged by injuries again, either. They're slated to lose ace Framber Valdez and catcher <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/players/2066830/victor-caratini/\">Victor Caratini</a> to free agency. Garcia, meanwhile, has already been ruled out for 2026, a development that could well spell the end of his time with the organization given he was slated for free agency next winter and now appears to be an obvious non-tender candidate.</p><p>Whatever Brown and the Astros do this winter, they no doubt will have their sights set on returning to October. After all, few markets know better what constitutes a streak, and missing the playoffs two years in a row would be the start of a most undesirable one. </p>\n            </div>"

With Madueke out for this match due to injury and UCL on the horizon, there could be room for Martinelli to start, but even if he doesn't, it's critical to know that he'll be ready to come off the bench and perform if needed. Arsenal expect to compete for the title, and they'll need the entire squad to keep pace with Liverpool over the course of the season.</p>\n            </div>\n    </div>"

    "body": "<div>\n        <p><span>BOSTON — </span>Aubert Et Fils Brut champagne dripped from the visitors' clubhouse ceiling Saturday evening. Lite Pilsner sprayed, too.</p><p>Exhales hung in the air as did the cigar smoke that permeated the room. Hank Williams Jr.'s \"Dinosaur\" rattled the speakers. Players sang along. </p><p>They had reason to. </p><p>It took a lot. Uncertainty. Frustration. Doubt.</p><p>But the slow drip -- the one that tested the Tigers all September -- finally filled the cup. A 2-1 win over the Red Sox at Fenway on Sunday delivered it: in Game 161, they had <span><a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/news/tigers-clinch-playoff-berth-despite-historic-collapse-detroit-set-for-return-trip-to-mlb-postseason/\" target=\"_blank\">clinched a playoff berth</a></span>.</p><p>\"This is all that matters,\" said ace Tarik Skubal, who will likely win his second straight Cy Young Award in November. \"You  play this game to get in the postseason. It doesn't matter how you get there, once you get there, let's just play baseball.\" </p>\n<p>That it came down to this is hard to fathom. Through August, the Tigers held the second-best record in baseball, trailing only the surging <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/teams/MIL/milwaukee-brewers/\" target=\"_blank\">Brewers</a>. Better than the <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/teams/LAD/los-angeles-dodgers/\" target=\"_blank\">Dodgers</a>. Better than the <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/teams/SD/san-diego-padres/\" target=\"_blank\">Padres</a>. Better than the <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/teams/PHI/philadelphia-phillies/\" target=\"_blank\">Phillies</a>. Yet a collapse was already brewing at their peak. Since Aug. 24, Detroit had dropped 21 of 28 games heading into Saturday, including 12 of their last 14.</p><p>What once looked like one of the league's best stories turned into a catastrophe. The <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/teams/CLE/cleveland-guardians/\" target=\"_blank\">Guardians</a>, despite a summer marred by suspensions tied to alleged betting and a deadline sell-off, caught fire. At one point, they ripped off 10 straight wins and 17 of 20. That 15 ½-game cushion Detroit once held is gone. It all comes down to the season's final day, with Cleveland holding the tiebreaker.</p><p>But in that clubhouse, you couldn't feel the collapse. Only relief. Only the release of a team that finally let itself breathe. The celebration carried a promise of something brighter, even if the road to get here nearly ended in disaster.</p>\n<p>\"We've been carrying a lot with us over the last month plus and I think it's been hard,\" manager A.J. Hinch said. \"I think it's been taxing. I think you're going to see a lot of guys mentally relax and even physically get a reset by the energy that's provided by the postseason.\" </p><p>How the Tigers got here has to do with myriad flaws. </p><p>Beyond <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/players/3126008/tarik-skubal/\" target=\"_blank\">Tarik Skubal</a>, Detroit's rotation has been a mess. Hinch had to turn to <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/players/2829919/keider-montero/\" target=\"_blank\">Keider Montero</a> as the \"bulk\" arm in what he called the most important game of the season. The rest of the staff hasn't held up. <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/players/2135266/jack-flaherty/\" target=\"_blank\">Jack Flaherty</a>, the big offseason addition, has a 4.64 ERA. <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/players/2942958/casey-mize/\" target=\"_blank\">Casey Mize</a> looked sharp through June with a 2.82 ERA in 14 starts. In his next 14, he stumbled to a 4.99.</p><p>The Tigers' trade deadline moves fell flat. <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/players/2246181/chris-paddack/\" target=\"_blank\">Chris Paddack</a>, brought in from the <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/teams/MIN/minnesota-twins/\" target=\"_blank\">Twins</a>, gave Detroit six starts and a 5.40 ERA before being pushed to the bullpen. <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/players/1390876/charlie-morton/\" target=\"_blank\">Charlie Morton</a>, the veteran expected to steady the rotation, didn't last. He posted a 7.09 ERA in nine games and was designated for assignment.</p>\n<p>The bats didn't carry the load, either. Javy Báez went from starting the All-Star Game while hitting .280 in the first half to batting .184 entering Saturday. Outside of <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/players/3117537/riley-greene/\" target=\"_blank\">Riley Greene</a> -- and to a lesser degree <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/players/3166850/spencer-torkelson/\" target=\"_blank\">Spencer Torkelson</a> -- there's been little consistent pop.</p><p>Still, the Tigers have clawed to this point. They remain in the hunt for the AL Central heading into Game 162.</p><p>\"Really nothing matters,\" Greene said. \"What happened doesn't matter. We're here and we're ready.\" </p>\n<p>Skubal, who was in line to pitch Sunday, will rest instead and be lined up for Game 1 of the Wild Card Series. The division means something, but not enough to run your ace out there. That's a risk Detroit isn't willing to take. Instead, Paddack will take the ball.</p><p>The Tigers ace stopped mid-interview. \"Hold on, I have to shotgun this,\" he said, lifting his beer.</p><p>It spilled down his chin, dripping onto his blue postseason T-shirt like the beer and champagne falling from the clubhouse ceiling. The celebration carried on. Players sang louder. </p>\n<p>It finally rained down the way they'd been waiting for.</p>\n            </div>"

Sunday will mark the second time these teams have faced each other overseas; the Vikings posted a 34-27 win over the Steelers in London's Wembley Stadium back in Week 4 of the 2013 season.</p><p><em><a href=\"https://martech.cbssports.com/bt/redirect/prod?b=draftkings&c=sport\" target=\"_blank\">Click here to bet Steelers vs. Vikings at DraftKings Sportsbook</a>, where users can get $200 in bonus bets instantly with a $5 wager and over $200 off NFL Sunday Ticket:</em></p><p>Both teams enter Sunday's game with 2-1 records. Pittsburgh rebounded from its Week 2 loss to Seattle by beating the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/NE/new-england-patriots/\">Patriots</a> in Week 5 on the strength of five forced turnovers. The Vikings also rebounded from a rough outing in Week 2, dominating the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/CIN/cincinnati-bengals/\">Bengals</a> last Sunday in a game that saw their defense actually outscore Cincinnati's offense. </p>\n<p>Here's how you can follow the action in real time, along with a breakdown and a prediction for Sunday. </p><h2>Where to watch Steelers vs. Vikings live</h2><p><strong>When:</strong> Sunday, Sept. 28 | <strong>Time:</strong> 9:30 a.m. ET<br /><strong>Where: </strong>Croke Park -- Dublin, Ireland  <br /><strong>TV:</strong> <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://cbssports.com/nfl/\">NFL</a> Network | <strong>Stream:</strong> <a href=\"https://www.fubo.tv/welcome\" target=\"_blank\">Fubo</a> (Try for free)<br /><strong>Follow:</strong> <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mobile\" target=\"_blank\">CBS Sports App</a><br /><strong>Odds: </strong>Vikings -2.5; O/U 40.5 (via <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/betting/news/fanduel-promo-code/\">FanDuel</a>)</p><h2>Steelers vs. Vikings: Need to know </h2><p><strong>The Brian Flores factor. </strong>The Steelers are familiar with Vikings defensive coordinator Brian Flores, who served on Pittsburgh's defensive staff during the 2022 season before moving to Minnesota. When asked about Flores this week, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/419780/aaron-rodgers/\">Aaron Rodgers</a> lauded Flores' coaching acumen while acknowledging that he expects Flores to dial up the pressure on Sunday. </p>\n<p><strong>The Carson Wentz factor.</strong> Former Pro Bowl quarterback <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/1907522/carson-wentz/\">Carson Wentz</a> will make his second consecutive start in place of injured starter <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/26695214/j-j-mccarthy/\">J.J. McCarthy</a>. Against the Bengals, Wentz went 14 of 20 for 173 yards with two touchdowns and no picks. Wentz should be aided by the return of wideout <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/3162290/jordan-addison/\">Jordan Addison</a>, who missed the season's first three games while on suspension. </p><p><strong>More Mason?</strong> With <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/2071937/aaron-jones/\">Aaron Jones</a> injured, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/2967536/jordan-mason/\">Jordan Mason</a> picked up the slack with 116 yards and two touchdowns during last Sunday's win over Cincinnati. Mason is looking to have similar success against a Steelers defense that has already allowed two 100-yard rushers this season in <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/3123469/breece-hall/\">Breece Hall</a> and <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/3121372/kenneth-walker-iii/\">Kenneth Walker III</a>. </p><p><strong>Turn down for Watt.</strong> <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/2071793/t-j-watt/\">T.J. Watt</a> snapped his six-game drought without a sack by getting two during last week's win over the Patriots. Watt leads a formidable Pittsburgh pass rush that has been buoyed by <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/3162091/nick-herbig/\">Nick Herbig</a> and rookie <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/26693445/jack-sawyer/\">Jack Sawyer</a>.  </p>\n<p><strong>Same old Rodgers. </strong>The 41-year-old Rodgers has enjoyed a solid start to his Steelers tenure. He is currently tied for second in the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://cbssports.com/nfl/\">NFL</a> in touchdown passes and is a big reason why Pittsburgh's offense is No. 2 in the NFL in red zone efficiency. </p><h2>Steelers vs. Vikings prediction, pick </h2>\n<p>For me, this game comes down to whether the Steelers' defense can make the Vikings' offense one-dimensional. If they can contain Mason and force the Vikings into obvious passing downs, that should bode well for Pittsburgh's pass rush against a quarterback who isn't very mobile. The Steelers' revamped secondary -- which includes newcomers <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/2071515/jalen-ramsey/\">Jalen Ramsey</a>, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/2136536/jabrill-peppers/\">Jabrill Peppers</a> -- should also aid Pittsburgh's pass rush. <em><strong>Pick: Steelers, Under 40.5</strong></em></p>\n            </div>"

Just minutes after the No. 13 ranked Rebels extended their unbeaten start to 5-0, Kiffin took to social media to have a little fun at the expense of LSU coach Brian Kelly. </p><p>Earlier in the week, Kelly had confidently predicted that LSU would keep the Magnolia Trophy in Baton Rouge \"where it deserves to be.\" Kiffin, naturally, had other plans.</p><p>Within 30 minutes of the final whistle, Kiffin shared a photo of Kelly's quote.</p>\n<p>Kiffin's trolling didn't stop there.

    "body": "<div>\n        <p>It's a missed opportunity for Inter Miami as they went north of the border and drew against Toronto FC, 1-1, on Saturday. Chasing the Supporters' Shield, Toronto denied Miami a chance to pick up three necessary points in the race for the top spot in MLS. The Herons still have a game in hand on most of the league, but now, the Philadelphia Union can go six points clear atop the league by the end of the matchday.</p><p>Toronto FC goalkeeper Sean Johnson had an impressive match, saving six shots, three of those on Lionel Messi, who put four shots on target for an xG of 0.73. Near the end of the first half, Tadeo Allende put the Herons ahead, and it would've seemed like they'd leave with all three points. </p><p>But the defense had other ideas, and in the second half of play, Toronto midfielder Djordje Mihailovic found space in the box, and right back Richie Laryea did an excellent job keeping the ball in play and finding him for the equalizer, which keeper Oscar Ustari could do nothing about. It's yet another defensive breakdown for Miami, and these are moments that have plagued them all season. The attack has masked those flaws, but as we reach the business end of the MLS season, Miami will have to clean these mistakes up.</p>\n<p>Losing to Atlanta United in the first round of the MLS Cup playoffs will still loom in the memories of this team, especially after it caused an overhaul of the squad and coaching staff. After adding Rodrigo De Paul during the summer, these defensive lapses were supposed to be cleaned up, but they're still worrisome. A team with Messi and Luis Suarez shouldn't be losing the xG battle to a Toronto FC side who are close to the bottom of the Eastern Conference. Miami still control their fate in the Supporters' Shield, but if they don't win out, it will lead to more disappointment in a season that hasn't lived up to expectations domestically.</p>\n<p>Getting through to the last 16 of the FIFA Club World Cup is something that no MLS team has done before, but when that's coupled with falling in the Concacaf Champions Cup and Leagues Cup, Javier Mascherano's men will need to win multiple trophies to meet preseason expectations. It's the nature of being a team filled with stars, but in drawing Toronto, Miami showed that at times, they can still play like a collection of individuals. If that happens during the playoffs, it will only be met with another season of disappointment. </p>\n            </div>"
