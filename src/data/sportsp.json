Pereira's sentiment stems from a recent visit to the UFC Performance Institute in Las Vegas, where he claims Ankalaev physically hid from him.</p><p>Pereira and Ankalaev are preparing for their rematch on Oct. 4. That preparation recently brought them to the UFC PI. On Tuesday, Pereira uploaded a <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SxEPJBdxKP0&ab_channel=AlexPoatanPereira\" target=\"_blank\">video</a> detailing his time there. \"Poatan\" claims he saw Ankalaev's coach, but the UFC light heavyweight champion was absent. Only later was Pereira informed that Ankalaev had allegedly hid from him.</p><p>\"Something funny happened just now when I was leaving the PI. I saw Ankalaev's coach there. I stayed myself, I didn't see Ankalaev there,\" Pereira said, according to transcriptions from <a href=\"https://x.com/ChampRDS/status/1970642326562205864\" target=\"_blank\">Championship Rounds</a>. \"... When I got to the car, someone from my team was still inside, and he heard the girl from the PI say to Ankalaev, 'He can come now, he's already left.' </p><p>\"Damn, he was hiding. They hid the guy in a little room. This guy thinks I'm going to run into him and start fighting.

However, Pereira takes issue with his rival's alleged cowardice.</p><p>\"Honestly, I would've handled it better. But the fact that the guy hides in a room because I'm in the same place as him,\" Pereira said. \"He's a chump. I'll keep to myself. I'll never pick a fight with the guy. Never start something. Of course, unless he comes at me. I have to defend myself, too. But what kind of champion is that? A shit champion. I know that's harsh, but he's a shitty champion. </p><p>Pereira is making final arrangements for their rematch in Vegas. In March, Ankalaev beat Pereira via unanimous decision, taking the light heavyweight title and snapping Pereira's five-fight winning streak. </p>\n<p>\"He's shown he's a coward,\" Pereira said. \"We'll see. He's hiding now. We'll be in the cage, locked in there. Unless he jumps the fence.\"</p>\n            </div>"

    "body": "<div>\n        <p>The <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/teams/NYY/new-york-yankees/\">New York Yankees</a> became the latest team to clinch a playoff spot on Tuesday, doing so in dramatic fashion on a walk-off win vs. the White Sox after a ninth-inning comeback. The Yankees have now made the postseason in back-to-back seasons and in eight of their last nine attempts. This also marks the franchise's 60th playoff appearance.</p><p>Down 2-1 headed into the bottom of the ninth, Anthony Volpe scored the tying run on a wild pitch from Chicago reliever Brandon Eisert before José Caballero drove in <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/players/2071264/aaron-judge/\">Aaron Judge</a> for the winning run.</p><p>The extent of New York's playoff berth is to be determined since the Yankees remain in the hunt for both the American League's top seed and the East division crown. The Yankees entered Tuesday trailing the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/teams/TOR/toronto-blue-jays/\">Toronto Blue Jays</a> by two games in both races. It's worth noting the Blue Jays won the season series (8-5), meaning the Yankees will have to beat them outright to prevail.</p><p>\"First box to check, right?\" manager Aaron Boone <a href=\"https://x.com/BrendanKutyNJ/status/1970672461784997992\" target=\"_blank\">said</a> after the game Tuesday. \"We got to get in. We're in. Don't take that shit for granted. Yeah, we're in the playoffs. We got a lot more to do, right? We've got a lot bigger goals. Enjoy this.\" </p>\n<p>The Yankees can credit their success to yet another terrific season from Judge, who may well win consecutive AL MVP awards. Offseason additions like slugger <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/players/2165919/cody-bellinger/\">Cody Bellinger</a>, lefty <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/players/2001078/max-fried/\">Max Fried</a>, and first baseman <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/players/1765052/paul-goldschmidt/\">Paul Goldschmidt</a> also ranked among the 10 most productive players on New York's roster, according to Baseball Reference's metrics.</p><p>In a sense, a down year would've been understandable. The Yankees lost outfielder <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/players/2507367/juan-soto/\">Juan Soto</a> to the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/teams/NYM/new-york-mets/\">New York Mets</a> through free agency, then saw ace <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/players/1893753/gerrit-cole/\">Gerrit Cole</a> succumb to Tommy John surgery back in the spring, before he could throw even a single regular-season pitch. Yet the Yankees were able to weather those setbacks, as well as losing months in June and July. As of Tuesday, they had the best run differential in the entire American League.</p><p>The Yankees will wrap up their regular season with two more games against the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/teams/CHW/chicago-white-sox/\">White Sox</a> and then three against the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/teams/BAL/baltimore-orioles/\">Baltimore Orioles</a>, one of the year's most disappointing clubs.</p>\n<p>The aforementioned Blue Jays are the only other AL club to clinch a postseason spot to date. The <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/teams/SEA/seattle-mariners/\">Seattle Mariners</a>, seeking their first division crown since 2001, would seem to be next up.</p>\n            </div>"

    "body": "<div>\n        <p>If the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/teams/CLE/cleveland-guardians/\">Cleveland Guardians</a> wind up pulling off a baseball miracle and winning the American League Central this season, then the sixth inning of Tuesday's win over the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/teams/DET/detroit-tigers/\">Detroit Tigers</a> will be remembered for a number of reasons -- all of them good, from the Cleveland standpoint, save for one scary moment involving <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/players/2932748/david-fry/\">David Fry</a>. </p><p>First and foremost, the Guardians' <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/gametracker/boxscore/MLB_20250923_DET@CLE/\" target=\"_blank\">5-2</a> win in the critical series opener pulled them into a first-place tie with Detroit. That tie -- both teams are now 85-72 on the season -- is really a one-game lead for Cleveland. That's because Tuesday's win also clinched the head-to-head season series for the Guardians, and that means they hold the tiebreaker over the Tigers. That, in turn, means that if the two teams end the season tied atop the AL Central, then the Guardians will be declared division champs by virtue of that win in the season series. </p><p>As for Tuesday's critical bottom of the sixth, it may loom impossibly large if recent trends continue. The Tigers went into the frame with a 2-0 lead over Cleveland and reigning AL Cy Young winner (and 2025 AL Cy Young favorite) <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/players/3126008/tarik-skubal/\">Tarik Skubal</a> on the mound. Those were in theory unenviable circumstances for the hosts, but things didn't unfold according to expectations. </p><p><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/players/2932861/steven-kwan/\">Steven Kwan</a> got things started off with a leadoff bunt single, and then Angel Martínez made it a small-ball trend when he laid down a bunt of his own. Skubal fielded the bunt and worsened his own lot with an ill-advised \"throw\" to first base: </p>\n<p>Skubal went into longsnapper mode and paid for it, as his error put runners on second and third with no outs and brought the potent José Ramírez to the plate as the potential go-ahead run. Ramírez, though, didn't tap into his customary power and instead kept the theme going with an RBI swinging-bunt single. That made it 2-1 with runners on the corners and Skubal still looking for his first out. </p><p>DH David Fry was up next, and he squared around for a bunt attempt with the count 2-1 in his favor. Unfortunately, Skubal's 99 mph fastball ran in on Fry, nicked his bat, and struck him flush in the face. Fry was down for some time before being helped into a seated position and then exiting the field with assistance. </p><p>Fry made contact with the pitch, which means it was ruled a foul ball. After the game, Guardians manager Steven Vogt <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://x.com/MasonHorodyski/status/1970659480468889839\">told reporters</a> that Fry remained conscious throughout and was undergoing tests. Further updates are expected on Wednesday. </p>\n<p>Pinch-hitter <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/players/3077721/george-valera/\">George Valera</a> inherited Fry's 2-2 count. Perhaps quite understandably rattled, Skubal uncorked a wild pitch to Valera that allowed Martínez to score the tying run. Skubal rebounded to strike out Valera but soon after balked Ramírez to third. A weakly hit grounder to the right side by <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/players/2876077/gabriel-arias/\">Gabriel Arias</a> brought Ramírez home and gave Cleveland its first lead of the game. Skubal whiffed <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/players/26911664/kyle-manzardo/\">Kyle Manzardo</a> to end the sixth, but by then the script had flipped.</p><p>The Guardians tacked on two insurance runs in the later innings, and that was more than enough, what with <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/players/2837689/gavin-williams/\">Gavin Williams</a>' 12-strikeout gem and three scoreless frames from the bullpen. </p><a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/news/remembering-the-10-worst-late-season-collapses-in-mlb-history-as-2025-tigers-and-mets-threaten-to-join-list/\" target=\"_blank\">\n        <div>\n            <div>\n                <p>Remembering the 10 worst late-season collapses in MLB history as 2025 Tigers and Mets threaten to join list</p>\n                <p>\n                    Dayn Perry                </p>\n            </div>\n                            <div>\n    <figure><img alt=\"Remembering the 10 worst late-season collapses in MLB history as 2025 Tigers and Mets threaten to join list\" src=\"https://sportshub.cbsistatic.com/i/r/2025/09/23/ce22e923-ef3d-47f0-94eb-c33729488931/thumbnail/270x152/12c3ce5e0227f119d83a4bce30fa6eb4/papelbon-getty.png\" /></figure>\n                </div>\n                    </div>\n    </a>\n<p>For Detroit, it means what was once a 14-game lead in the division on July 9 is now gone.

Cleveland, meantime, was 9 ½ games out as recently as Sept. 10. As well, they've come back from 15 ½ out earlier this season, which according to the CBS Sports research desk would make this the largest comeback in the divisional era. The stakes are quite high for both teams, of course. Not only is the division at stake, but the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/teams/HOU/houston-astros/\">Houston Astros</a> are close on the heels of the AL Central runner-up, which means that whichever team doesn't win the division may be in danger of falling out of playoff position altogether. Of note is that both the Tigers and Guardians hold their respective tiebreakers over the Astros. </p>\n<p>There's more to come, of course, as the Tigers and Guardians will be back at it on Wednesday and Thursday evenings with the division title at stake. </p>\n            </div>"

While the four-time Pro Bowler undoubtedly is seeking revenge against the team that failed to sign him to a long-term deal, not everything about his trip to Dallas will be so sweet.</p><p>Squaring off against former teammates is a reality many <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://cbssports.com/nfl/\">NFL</a> players face.

He debuted with a sack in Week 1, notched another half sack in Week 2 and is already up to 15 quarterback pressures through three games. Even when he doesn't get home, he makes life significantly more challenging for opposing signal-callers, and Prescott will soon be on the receiving end of that prowess.</p>\n<p>\"I accepted my fate weeks ago when the trade happened,\" Parsons told the AP. \"It's all about playing another game and just doing what I do best, and that's be a disruptive football player. I think the media and the fans are trying to blow it up to be such a big thing, but I just look at it as just another game at AT&T.\"</p><p>Tensions grew between Parsons and Cowboys owner Jerry Jones in a drawn-out negotiation process that dated back to 2023. Parsons requested a trade out of Dallas shortly after training camp opened this summer, and rather than finally bending to meet his star pass rusher's demands, Jones made a deal with Green Bay to move him off his roster.</p><p>The Packers promptly gave Parsons what he sought in Dallas, signing him to a four-year, $186 million contract that includes $120 million in guaranteed money.</p>\n<p>\"I have all the respect in the world for him, and we know him well,\" <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/news/cowboys-jerry-jones-has-all-the-respect-in-the-world-for-micah-parsons-ahead-of-facing-packers-in-week-4/\">Jones said of Parsons</a>. \"So you can bet that we'll be preparing for what he brings to the table.

    "body": "<div>\n        <p>The <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nba/teams/MIN/minnesota-timberwolves/\">Minnesota Timberwolves</a> have made the conference finals in consecutive seasons and their best player, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nba/players/3141406/anthony-edwards/\">Anthony Edwards</a>, isn't even in his prime yet. They improved as the 2024-25 season went on, overcoming a rough start with their new personnel. <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nba/players/2135560/julius-randles/\">Julius Randle's</a> playoff performance was encouraging, and he'll be back on a contract that doesn't break the bank. Why, then, isn't there more excitement about this team?</p><p>The answer isn't complicated: The Wolves haven't added anybody. In fact, while teams like the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nba/teams/HOU/houston-rockets/\">Rockets</a> and <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nba/teams/DEN/denver-nuggets/\">Nuggets</a> loaded up in an effort to challenge the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nba/teams/OKC/oklahoma-city-thunder/\">Thunder</a>, the biggest difference between the Minnesota roster that lost in five games against OKC and the one it's bringing into 2025-26 is that the latter doesn't have <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nba/players/2893425/nickeil-alexander-walker/\">Nickeil Alexander-Walker</a> on it. There could still be paths for the Wolves to get back to where they were, but most of them involve <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nba/players/29232027/rob-dillingham/\">Rob Dillingham</a> and either <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nba/players/3142402/terrence-shannon-jr/\">Terrence Shannon Jr</a>. or <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nba/players/3178201/jaylen-clark/\">Jaylen Clark</a> becoming reliable rotation players. And based on that last series, they're going to need more firepower the next time they see the Thunder, even if all the second-year guys pop. </p><h3>The State of Play</h3><p><strong>Last year:</strong> The Wolves were .500 through 34 games and 32-29 at the end of February. For much of the season, they made headlines only when Edwards got fined or <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nba/news/anthony-edwards-says-wolves-have-no-offensive-identity-he-cant-get-downhill-with-four-people-at-the-rim/\">complained about their issues on offense</a>. Then they won 17 of their final 21 games, with the league's second-best offense and fourth-best net rating in that span. In the crowded West, their 49-33 record was just barely good enough to avoid the play-in and just one game worse than the third-place <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nba/teams/LAL/los-angeles-lakers/\">Lakers</a>, whom they eliminated in five games in the first round. They did the same thing to the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nba/teams/GS/golden-state-warriors/\">Warriors</a> (who were without <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nba/players/1685204/stephen-curry/\">Stephen Curry</a> for all but 13 minutes), then lost in five games themselves to the eventual-champion Thunder in the conference finals.</p><p><strong>The offseason</strong>: Randle re-signed on a three-year, $100 million contract; Reid re-signed on a five-year, $125 million contract and both of them got player options. Alexander-Walker left for the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nba/teams/ATL/atlanta-hawks/\">Hawks</a> on a four-year, $60.6 million sign-and-trade arrangement that returned a 2027 Cleveland second-round pick and a trade exception that Minnesota may or may not use. <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nba/players/26777945/josh-minott/\">Josh Minott</a> and <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nba/players/2892502/luka-garza/\">Luka Garza</a> left, too, signing minimum contracts in Boston, but <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nba/players/2155449/joe-ingles/\">Joe Ingles</a> returned on a minimum contract and rookie <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nba/players/29695897/joan-beringer/\">Joan Beringer</a>, an 18-year-old French center drafted No. 17 overall, joined the development program. </p>\n<p><strong>Las Vegas over/under: </strong>50.5, per <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/betting/news/betmgm-promo-code/\">BetMGM</a></p><h3>The Conversation</h3><p><strong>Timberwolves believer:</strong> Michael Jordan won his first MVP award in his age-24 season. Same with <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nba/players/400553/lebron-james/\">LeBron James</a> and <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nba/players/2067655/giannis-antetokounmpo/\">Giannis Antetokounmpo</a>. And it just so happens that the Minnesota Timberwolves' franchise player, a shooting guard who is on a Hall of Fame trajectory, turned 24 in August. Anthony Edwards has already made All-NBA twice. About halfway through last season, he became the Wolves' all-time leader in 3s made. The next step is the top of the damn mountain. </p><p><strong>Timberwolves skeptic: </strong>Are you saying that Edwards will reach the top of the mountain this season or that the Wolves will? Either way, I disagree. Talented as he may be, he is still rounding out his game. It seemed pretty cool that he increased his 3-point volume last season, but in the playoffs he shot 6.3 pull-up 3s a game and made just 28.7% of them. His midrange shot isn't there yet, his rim frequency decreases every year and he gets frustrated when opposing teams blitz him. I still don't totally trust his decision-making or his off-ball defense, and it's hard for me to imagine him winning MVP over guys like SGA and <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nba/players/2135542/nikola-jokic/\">Nikola Jokic</a>, especially because I don't see the Wolves being on the same level as OKC and Denver. Nickeil Alexander-Walker is a big loss!</p><p><strong>Timberwolves believer:</strong> I'm saying it's time for Edwards to <em>at least</em> be in the mix for MVP, and if he gets there then Minnesota will <em>at least</em> be a top-tier contender. By the way, you and all the other people who are writing off the Wolves because they lost their eighth man have only reaffirmed my belief that Ant has a real shot at it. Because of you, it'll be treated like some kind of miracle when he and the team come back stronger, a narrative that will strengthen his MVP case. Really, though, everybody should expect Julius Randle, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nba/players/3142190/jaden-mcdaniels/\">Jaden McDaniels</a> and <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nba/players/2203519/donte-divincenzo/\">Donte DiVincenzo</a> to start the season better than they did last time and Ant to be sharper than ever. If you're already an elite player and you need to figure out what parts of your game need fine-tuning, there's nothing better than battling one of the best defenses of all-time with a spot in the Finals on the line.</p>\n<p><strong>Timberwolves skeptic: </strong>The Wolves better hope that all of those guys have better seasons this year because they need to make up for NAW's absence somehow. And aren't you worried about <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nba/players/1231861/mike-conley/\">Mike Conley</a>? He's turning 38 before the season starts, and 2024-25 was a weird one. He lost his starting spot for a bit, had a career-low usage rate (14.1%) and went scoreless once in each of Minnesota's playoff series. I've been a big Conley fan forever and would love to see him win a title before he retires, so I hate that the front office has not put him in a position to do so. In terms of minutes and usage, Conley has already transitioned to a supporting role, but if he's the point guard equivalent of <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nba/players/1622544/brook-lopez/\">Brook Lopez</a> on the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nba/teams/LAC/los-angeles-clippers/\">Clippers</a>, there is no <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nba/players/2245326/ivica-zubac/\">Ivica Zubac</a> here. Overpaying <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nba/players/3148879/naz-reid/\">Naz Reid</a> instead of re-signing NAW is a total disaster -- you saw Reid in the Thunder series, right? -- and I can't believe a supposedly serious, win-now team is betting on Rob Dillingham, Terrence Shannon Jr. and Jaylen Clark, who are all totally unproven.</p><p><strong>Timberwolves believer: </strong>The Wolves drafted Dillingham because they knew Conley couldn't play heavy minutes forever. They chose Reid over NAW because they knew they had Shannon and Clark waiting in the wings. I think Tim Connelly will be vindicated for all of this, just like he's been vindicated for trading <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nba/players/2152531/karl-anthony-towns/\">Karl-Anthony Towns</a>. You surely scorched the whole organization for making such a move right after making the conference finals, but it looks pretty good now that Minnesota has made another conference finals and re-signed Julius Randle to a contract that will pay him $22.3 million less than Towns this season, doesn't it?</p><p><strong>Timberwolves skeptic: </strong>Sure, the Randle contract seems fine. But why pay Reid all that money to do the same stuff? This is a massive misallocation of resources, and it's particularly disappointing because I thought Minnesota might use the offseason to make the roster more balanced. I want to see McDaniels play the 4 more often, and I really want to see Edwards in a healthier offensive environment, with better spacing and someone other than Randle to share the playmaking burden. Unless Connelly has another just-before-training-camp trade coming, I guess I'll have to wait.</p>\n            </div>"

The Buckeyes are coming off a bye, and the team was a little lackluster in 2024 following its early bye weeks. OSU failed to cover in either contest following its two regular season byes last year, including narrowly beating Nebraska by four points, despite being favored by 25.5 points. As for the Huskies, they're also 3-0 on the season and coming off a 35-point road victory in a rivalry game with Washington State. Washington's 55.7 points per game are second-most in FBS as it should be able to stick with an Ohio State team that's allowing over 100 rushing yards per game, despite facing just one Power 4 team. The model has Washington covering nearly 60% of the time. <a href=\"https://www.sportsline.com/insiders/college-football-odds-lines-spreads-picks-predictions-betting-advice-for-week-5-2025-from-proven-model/#ttag=09222025_agg_cbssports_picks_football_ncaa_model_Week5collegefootballodds\" target=\"_blank\">See which other picks the model likes here</a>.</p><p>Another prediction: No. 9 Texas A&M (-6.5, 52.5) covers against Auburn well over 50% of the time at Saturday at 3:30 p.m. ET. Auburn fell out of the Top 25 following its defeat to Oklahoma, while the Aggies had a bye last Saturday, following their upset of then-No. 8 Notre Dame. The Tigers struggled containing QB John Mateer of OU, as he had 300 total yards, with touchdowns both thru the air on the ground, so Auburn should equally struggle with A&M's Marcel Reed. The quarterback has a 9:1 TD:INT and is averaging nearly 50 rushing yards per game. Add in that just two teams in the nation have allowed more sacks than Auburn, and just 10 FBS teams average more penalties, and the Tigers have several issues that A&M can exploit. SportsLine's model also predicts the Over hitting more than 50% of the time. <a href=\"https://www.sportsline.com/insiders/college-football-odds-lines-spreads-picks-predictions-betting-advice-for-week-5-2025-from-proven-model/#ttag=09222025_agg_cbssports_picks_football_ncaa_model_Week5collegefootballodds\" target=\"_blank\">See the rest of the model's picks here</a>.</p><h2>How to make college football picks for Week 5</h2><p>The model has also made the call on who wins and covers in every FBS matchup in Week 5, and it's calling for multiple upsets, including a shocking result in a ranked matchup. <a href=\"https://www.sportsline.com/insiders/college-football-odds-lines-spreads-picks-predictions-betting-advice-for-week-5-2025-from-proven-model/#ttag=09222025_agg_cbssports_picks_football_ncaa_model_Week5collegefootballodds\" target=\"_blank\">You can only get every pick for every game at SportsLine</a>, <strong>and for a limited time you can use promo code CHAMPIONSHIP to get your first month at SportsLine for $1.</strong></p><p><strong>So what college football picks can you make with confidence, and which underdogs win outright?

None of those wins came with <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/2180320/sam-darnold/\">Sam Darnold</a> under center, but the well-traveled quarterback has been among the best versus the spread in recent seasons.

Head coach Jonathan Gannon continues to work wonders on the defensive side of the ball as the Cards ranked 31st in scoring defense in 2023, then 15th in 2024 and are now fifth this season. The Cardinals make an opponent one-dimensional on offense and then perform their best in clutch situations as Arizona ranks top-five in rushing defense, third-down defense and redzone defense.</p><p>While Conner's injury is an emotional setback for Arizona, it does allow the team to utilize second-year back, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/3176915/trey-benson/\">Trey Benson</a>, more. His 6.0 yards per carry rank second in the NFL, while <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/2180829/kyler-murrays/\">Kyler Murray's</a> 5.4 yards per rush are seventh-best. Additionally, just four teams have a better turnover differential than the Cards, which the model has taken into account. SportsLine's projections forecast Arizona's defense to both rack up more sacks than Seattle's and to force more turnovers on Thursday. <a href=\"https://www.sportsline.com/insiders/seahawks-vs-cardinals-prediction-line-odds-proven-model-releases-spread-pick-for-2025-nfl-week-4-thursday-night-football/#ttag=09222025_agg_cbssports_picks_football_nfl_model_SeahawksCardinalsTNF\" target=\"_blank\">See which team to back at SportsLine</a>. </p><p><em>New users can also check out the latest <span><a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/betting/news/fanduel-promo-code/\" target=\"_blank\">FanDuel promo code</a></span> to <a href=\"https://martech.cbssports.com/bt/redirect/prod?b=fanduel&c=sport\" target=\"_blank\">get $300 in bonus bets after placing a $5 wager</a>:</em></p><h2>How to make Cardinals vs. Seahawks picks</h2><p>For the NFL Week 4 Thursday Night Football game of Seahawks vs. Cardinals, the model is leaning Over the total, and also says one side of the spread is the better value. <a href=\"https://www.sportsline.com/insiders/seahawks-vs-cardinals-prediction-line-odds-proven-model-releases-spread-pick-for-2025-nfl-week-4-thursday-night-football/#ttag=09222025_agg_cbssports_picks_football_nfl_model_SeahawksCardinalsTNF\" target=\"_blank\">See what it is at SportsLine</a>.</p><p><strong>Who wins Cardinals vs. Seahawks, and which side of the spread is the better value? </strong><a href=\"https://www.sportsline.com/insiders/seahawks-vs-cardinals-prediction-line-odds-proven-model-releases-spread-pick-for-2025-nfl-week-4-thursday-night-football/#ttag=09222025_agg_cbssports_picks_football_nfl_model_SeahawksCardinalsTNF\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>Visit SportsLine now to see which side of the Seahawks vs. Cardinals spread you need to jump, all from the model that is 39-19 on top-rated picks since 2024</strong></a><strong>, and find out.</strong></p>\n            </div>"

The Liberty's decision to part ways with Brondello just one year after she led the franchise to its first championship, on the other hand, came as a surprise. </p><p>There will likely not be any more coaching changes this winter.

There's a strong legacy here, and it did not withhold the name of the brand. It's not something that helped us all in recruiting. It's something that we have addressed. We have addressed it seriously, and we're hoping that we can now move on and put our next foot forward.\"</p><p>After reviewing video evidence, authorities identified Whitehorn as the aggressor in the incident. The victim told sheriff's deputies she heard glass break and saw Whitehorn in the parking lot outside her home. After a physical fight, the victim ran inside and locked the door. Whitehorn was then seen on video kicking down the front door and entering the residence.</p><a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/wnba/news/wnba-coaching-tracker-liberty-fire-sandy-brondello-sky-wings-wont-make-changes-per-report/\" target=\"_blank\">\n        <div>\n            <div>\n                <p>WNBA coaching tracker: Liberty fire Sandy Brondello; Sky, Wings won't make changes, per report</p>\n                <p>\n                    Jack Maloney                </p>\n            </div>\n                            <div>\n    <figure><img alt=\"WNBA coaching tracker: Liberty fire Sandy Brondello; Sky, Wings won't make changes, per report\" src=\"https://sportshub.cbsistatic.com/i/r/2025/09/23/6cf076c7-dd27-49c4-b846-222649b67a0b/thumbnail/270x152/d83c1591aa73962f97a72dd7e1c5f22a/brondello.jpg\" /></figure>\n                </div>\n                    </div>\n    </a>\n<p>Whitehorn chased the victim upstairs, kicked in a bedroom door and broke a mirror before recovering her phone -- which she claimed the victim took, among other personal items -- and leaving the residence.</p>\n<p>Authorities arrested Whitehorn aggravated burglary and domestic assault charges and later released her on bond. Whitehorn appeared on Sept. 5 in Knox County General Sessions Court and had her charges lowered to misdemeanors of vandalism and aggravated criminal trespass. She also received judicial diversion, which will remove the charges from her record after a one-year probationary period that includes anger management and \"no trouble or assaultive behavior\" against the victim.</p><p>\"It was a difficult process,\" Caldwell said. \"I think as a coach, it's really hard, and I'm going to be really transparent here. You have to look at the scope of the team. That's my job as a head coach, is to protect the Lady Vol brand. You have to look at that. But it's also my job to coach my players. My players are young people, and they make mistakes. She made mistakes that did not reflect well on this program.</p><p>\"We talked about it at length. We -- I don't want to say punished, but we gave her a penalty that was pretty severe, and if she batted an eye to that or didn't want to do that or wasn't going to bend over backwards to make up for what she did to the brand of this program by failing to meet the standard, then we were going to move on. She really wanted to be part of this program, and she understands the severity of what she did. So those conversations led to where we are now.\"</p>\n<p>Whitehorn is a three-year starter who opened her career at Clemson and transferred to Tennessee ahead of the 2024-25 season. The former ACC All-Freshman Team selection started 28 of 34 games for the Lady Vols in her debut SEC season and averaged 11.6 points, 4.0 rebounds and 1.7 assists per game.</p>\n            </div>"

Are we having fun yet?</p><p>I hope we get some clarity on these players in Week 4, but there are a couple of guys I think we have more than enough on, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/2867159/jake-ferguson/fantasy/\">Jake Ferguson</a> and <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/2186637/juwan-johnson/fantasy/\">Juwan Johnson</a>. I say that not just because they are TE1 and TE2 on the year. It's that they've done so in a way that at the very least suggests they will be must-start tight ends, maybe even elite.</p><p>Ferguson's outlook is obviously impacted by <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/2865251/ceedee-lambs/fantasy/\">CeeDee Lamb's</a> injury. That alone may have elevated him to this status, but there's more. On the season, he now has 10 more targets than <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/3123212/george-pickens/fantasy/\">George Pickens</a>, 14 more receptions, and 19 more yards. When Lamb was healthy, Ferguson was the clear second option in this passing game. Now, I would expect him to lead the team in targets until Lamb gets back. And even after Lamb gets back, I would expect Ferguson to be a starter.</p>\n<p>Johnson's ascension is both more surprising and more traditional. He got a new coach and his role just exploded. Johnson has 28 targets over three games, and it hasn't been sporadic at all. He has at least eight targets and 11 PPR points in every game. <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/1274372/kellen-moore/fantasy/\">Kellen Moore</a> has brought a fast-paced, pass-heavy offense to New Orleans, and there are more targets for the tight ends than the running backs. That's a huge philosophical shift from last year, and Johnson is the main beneficiary. I am not sure he has the same high-end potential Ferguson has, but I feel confident saying he is a rest of season starter, which is more than you can say about a lot of the guys above.</p><p>Here's everything else you need to know about tight end in Week 4:  </p>\n<h6>\n        Week 4 TE Preview\n    </h6>\n<p><span>\n    <a></a>\n    <div>\n                            <p>\n                    TE Preview\n                </p>\n                            <h6>\n                    Numbers to Know\n                </h6>\n                    </div>\n            </span></p><ul><li><strong>18.6%</strong> -- Brock Bowers has an 18.6% target share the past two weeks. He had a 29% target share Week 1 before his knee injury. I still believe when Bowers gets right, he will be elite again, but that doesn't make the present feel any better.</li><li><strong>4</strong> -- Travis Kelce doesn't have more than four catches in any game. I don't really want to drop him until <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/3124978/rashee-rice/fantasy/\">Rashee Rice</a> gets back, but I understand why some will.</li><li><strong>86.3%</strong> -- Juwan Johnson's 86% snap share this season leads all tight ends.</li><li><strong>24.1%</strong> -- <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/3168800/tyler-warrens/fantasy/\">Tyler Warren's</a> 24.1% target share is tied for third at the position.

Henry has two touchdowns, Sanders has zero.</li><li><strong>32.2%</strong> -- Nearly a third of <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/2180355/jake-brownings/fantasy/\">Jake Browning's</a> passes have gone to tight ends. That would be a disaster for <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/2809208/tee-higgins/fantasy/\">Tee Higgins</a>, but it could make <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/2251095/noah-fant/fantasy/\">Noah Fant</a> streamable against the right matchup. </li><li><strong>13</strong> -- <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/2251097/t-j-hockenson/fantasy/\">T.J.

I am not inclined to buy last week's performance with <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/3162290/jordan-addison/fantasy/\">Jordan Addison</a> coming back, but it is

He already has as many from Maye this year as he had last year.

         I am sure after last week more people will drop Fannin than add him. I get it. Last week was really disappointing. But I still believe in the talent, he still has a 15% target share on an offense that may average 40 attempts per game, and I don't want to give up on a rookie I believed in back in April. If you want to start someone else this week, I get it. But don't forget what Mark Andrews just did to this defense last week.\n            </p>\n            </div>\n</div>\n</td></tr></tbody></table></div></div><p><span>\n    <a></a>\n    <div>\n

The closest are Tyler Warren and Juwan Johnson. Neither one has a great matchup, but the Rams haven't been quite as stingy as the Bills. Warren has immense upside every week with his high target share and YAC potential.\n            </p>\n            </div>\n</div></div><div><div><div><p>Contrarian DFS Play</p></div><div><p>\n

to play Bowers in tournament lineups every week until he pops, or at least until I run out of money. And there really isn't any data from this year to justify it. But he averaged more than 15 points per game last year and this year's Raiders offense is far more competent. Geno Smith is throwing for 277 yards per game and when Bowers is healthy a third of that could be his when he's healthy.\n            </p>\n            </div>\n</div></div><p><span>\n    <a></a>\n    <div>\n                            <p>\n                    TE Preview\n                </p>\n                            <h6>\n                    Heath's Projections\n                </h6>\n                    </div>\n            </span></p><p>My full set of Week 4 <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://cbssports.com/fantasy/football/\">Fantasy football</a> projections for every position are now available on SportsLine.

Budding stars such as <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/teams/WASH/washington-huskies/\">Washington's</a> Demond Williams, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/teams/USC/usc-trojans/\">USC's</a> <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/players/28909557/jayden-maiava/\">Jayden Maiava</a> and <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/teams/OREG/oregon-ducks/\">Oregon's</a> <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/players/28895698/dante-moore/\">Dante Moore</a> each face significant Week 5 challenges that will determine whether they keep rising or crash back to earth.</p><p>The No. 21 Trojans travel to face No. 23 <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/teams/ILL/illinois-fighting-illini/\">Illinois</a> in the day's early window before the Huskies host No. 1 <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/teams/OHIOST/ohio-state-buckeyes/\">Ohio State</a> in an afternoon battle on CBS.

Fernando Mendoza, Indiana</h3><p>The Fernando Mendoza Heisman campaign went from 0-100 in Week 4 as he torched Illinois for five touchdowns on 21 of 23 passing in Indiana's 63-10 beatdown of the Illini. The Cal transfer stands at 14 touchdowns with no interceptions heading into a challenging road spot at Iowa this week. <strong>Last week: 30</strong></p><h3>2. <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/players/28877253/josh-hoover/\">Josh Hoover</a>, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/teams/TCU/tcu-horned-frogs/\">TCU</a></h3><p>Hoover's job was pretty easy in TCU's 35-24 win over SMU: throw the football into the vicinity of <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/players/26725442/eric-mcalister/\">Eric McAlister</a> and let him go to work. McAlister accounted for 254 of Hoover's 379 yards passing and caught three of his five touchdown passes. Hoover is already at 1,000 yards passing in just three games. <strong>Last week: 8</strong></p>\n<h3>3. <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/players/3162966/haynes-king/\">Haynes King</a>, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/teams/GATECH/georgia-tech-yellow-jackets/\">Georgia Tech</a></h3><p>King did King things in Georgia Tech's Week 4 win over <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/teams/TEMPLE/temple-owls/\">Temple</a>, scoring twice as a passer and once as a runner. While his statistical production isn't overwhelming, no one has been more important to their team's success. The Yellow Jackets' gritty veteran leader has his team ranked in the top 20 for the first time since 2015. <strong>Last week: 2</strong></p><h3>4. <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/players/29173876/marcel-reed/\">Marcel Reed</a>, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/teams/TXAM/texas-am-aggies/\">Texas A&M</a></h3><p>Reed is trending aggressively toward stardom as Texas A&M begins SEC play by hosting <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/teams/AUBURN/auburn-tigers/\">Auburn</a> this week. He threw a game-winning touchdown pass in the waning seconds at <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/teams/ND/notre-dame-fighting-irish/\">Notre Dame</a> in Week 3 and has the dual-threat chops to get the Aggies into league title contention. <strong>Last week: 4</strong></p><h3>5. <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/players/29754995/trinidad-chambliss/\">Trinidad Chambliss</a>, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/teams/MISS/ole-miss-rebels/\">Ole Miss</a></h3><p>Chambliss followed up his spectacular starting debut in Week 3 with an equally productive Week 4 performance, as Ole Miss improved to 4-0 with a win over Group of Six power <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/teams/TULANE/tulane-green-wave/\">Tulane</a>. The Division II transfer is technically just filling in for the injured <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/players/29333654/austin-simmons/\">Austin Simmons</a>. But at this rate, it's hard to imagine Chambliss relinquishing the job. <strong>Last week: 31</strong></p>\n<h3>6. <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/players/28873851/diego-pavia/\">Diego Pavia</a>, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/teams/VANDY/vanderbilt-commodores/\">Vanderbilt</a></h3><p>Pavia is right there with King at Georgia Tech on the \"he means everything to his team\" meter. The soul of Vanderbilt football is on track to top his 2024 production as the Commodores inch closer to the heart of a grueling SEC slate. If he keeps it up, Vandy could match or exceed its program record of nine wins. <strong>Last week: 5</strong></p><h3>7. Jayden Maiava, USC</h3><p>Maiava continues to legitimize himself as an elite quarterback with each passing week. His most recent performance included five total touchdowns in a 45-31 win over <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/teams/MICHST/michigan-state-spartans/\">Michigan State</a>. Bigger tests are coming, as Illinois, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/teams/MICH/michigan-wolverines/\">Michigan</a>, Notre Dame and <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/teams/NEB/nebraska-cornhuskers/\">Nebraska</a> are the next four on the Trojans' slate. <strong>Last week: 12</strong></p><h3>8. <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/players/26697553/taylen-green/\">Taylen Green</a>, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/teams/ARK/arkansas-razorbacks/\">Arkansas</a></h3><p>Arkansas is just 2-2 with Notre Dame coming to town this week and seven conference games still ahead. But Green -- though imperfect in a Week 4 loss at <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/teams/MEMP/memphis-tigers/\">Memphis</a> -- leads college football in total offense by a significant margin through four games. <strong>Last week: 6</strong></p>\n<h3>9. Thomas Castellanos, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/teams/FSU/florida-state-seminoles/\">Florida State</a></h3><p>Castellanos has been in a holding pattern since his sterling performance in Florida State's Week 1 victory over <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/teams/BAMA/alabama-crimson-tide/\">Alabama</a>. He finally reenters the spotlight on Friday night, as the Seminoles travel to face <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/teams/UVA/virginia-cavaliers/\">Virginia</a> in their ACC opener. It's a classic lookahead spot with No. 2 <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/teams/MIAMI/miami-fla-hurricanes/\">Miami</a> looming in Week 6. <strong>Last week: 9</strong></p><h3>10. <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/players/28876844/byrum-brown/\">Byrum Brown</a>, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/teams/SFLA/south-florida-bulls/\">South Florida</a></h3><p><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/teams/BRO/brown-bears/\">Brown</a> guided South Florida to a 3-1 mark against a challenging non conference slate with gritty running and 11 completions of 25-plus yards. He's a perfect fit in coach Alex Golesh's veer and shoot system and is poised to wreak havoc on the American over the next couple months. <strong>Last week: 10</strong></p><h3>11. Demond Williams, Washington</h3><p>Everything Williams accomplished over Washington's first three games was just a dress rehearsal for Big Ten action, which begins this week with a visit from No. 1 Ohio State. The sophomore has been almost perfect since taking the keys to coach Jedd Fisch's offense late last season. <strong>Last week: 18</strong></p>\n<h3>12. Dante Moore, Oregon</h3><p>Moore ranks No. 8 nationally in yards per attempt at 10.1 after torching <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/teams/OREGST/oregon-state-beavers/\">Oregon State</a> for 305 yards and four touchdowns. It's been a great beginning to his starting tenure. But the first true test comes this week against a stout Penn State defense inside a hostile environment. <strong>Last week: 24</strong></p><h3>13. <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/players/28876053/gunner-stockton/\">Gunner Stockton</a>, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/teams/UGA/georgia-bulldogs/\">Georgia</a></h3><p>Stockton passed his first big test by leading Georgia to a win at <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/teams/TENN/tennessee-volunteers/\">Tennessee</a> with some fourth quarter heroics in Week 3. Now comes the next one, as No. 17 Alabama visits Sanford Stadium for a huge SEC clash. The redshirt junior's ability as a runner could be the difference against an Alabama defense that had no answer for Florida State's Thomas Castellanos in Week 1. <strong>Last week: 13</strong></p><h3>14. <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/players/29123610/joey-aguilar/\">Joey Aguilar</a>, Tennessee</h3><p>Aguilar gets his first taste of life on the road in the SEC on Saturday, as No. 15 Tennessee travels to <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/teams/MISSST/mississippi-state-bulldogs/\">Mississippi State</a>. He's tied atop the SEC in passing touchdowns with 12 and looks like the sort of gunslinger the Volunteers need to reach their offensive potential in coach Josh Heupel's up-tempo scheme. <strong>Last week: 14</strong></p>\n<h3>15. <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/players/28874546/beau-pribula/\">Beau Pribula</a>, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/teams/MIZZOU/missouri-tigers/\">Missouri</a></h3><p>Pribula made key plays with his legs while scrambling for 72 yards in Missouri's 29-20 win over <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/teams/SC/south-carolina-gamecocks/\">South Carolina</a> last week. The Penn State transfer isn't taking many downfield shots, but he quietly put together a strong first third of the season for a Missouri team with dark horse potential. <strong>Last week: 21</strong></p><h3>16. <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/players/26713418/sawyer-robertson/\">Sawyer Robertson</a>, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/teams/BAYLOR/baylor-bears/\">Baylor</a></h3><p>Robertson is third nationally in passing yards per game at 330, which adds up since Baylor has gone extraordinarily pass-heavy through four contests. But it's not just dink and dunk. He ranks fifth among Power Four quarterbacks in attempts of 20 or more air yards at 23. Expect another big game this week against reeling <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/teams/OKLAST/oklahoma-state-cowboys/\">Oklahoma State</a>. <strong>Last week: 20</strong></p><h3>17. <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/players/3163129/carson-beck/\">Carson Beck</a>, Miami</h3><p>Beck's performance in Miami's 26-7 win over <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/teams/FLA/florida-gators/\">Florida</a> wasn't a thing of beauty. But it didn't need to be considering how well the Hurricanes played defensively. Overall, it's been a great marriage for both sides through four games. Miami is ranked No. 2 and Beck is fourth in Heisman Trophy odds at <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/betting/news/fanduel-promo-code/\">FanDuel</a> (+1200). <strong>Last week: 19</strong></p>\n<h3>18. <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/players/29392540/dylan-raiola/\">Dylan Raiola</a>, Nebraska</h3><p>Raiola spent much of a 30-27 loss to Michigan running for his life against a relentless Wolverines defense. Given those circumstances, his 308-yard, three-touchdown showing had to be interpreted as more evidence of sophomore year progression for the former five-star prospect. <strong>Last week: 27</strong></p><h3>19. <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/players/28897339/aidan-chiles/\">Aidan Chiles</a>, Michigan State</h3><p>Chiles appears to be enjoying a junior year jump after struggling through a sophomore slump in 2024.

Whether that continues in league play could hinge largely on the performance of an offensive line that struggled in a Week 4 loss at USC. <strong>Last week: 35</strong></p><h3>20. <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/players/29123829/devon-dampier/\">Devon Dampier</a>, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/teams/UTAH/utah-utes/\">Utah</a></h3><p>If Dampier didn't look 100% healthy in Utah's 34-10 loss to <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/teams/TXTECH/texas-tech-red-raiders/\">Texas Tech</a>, it's because he wasn't. The dual-threat dynamo struggled through the air against the Red Raiders and didn't have his usual shiftiness while dealing with an ankle injury.
