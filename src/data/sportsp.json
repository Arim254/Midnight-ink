    "body": "<div>\n        <p>There could be a new UFC light heavyweight contender after Saturday. Carlos Ulberg vs. Dominick Reyes headlines UFC Fight Night in Perth, Australia, one week before 205-pound champion Magomed Ankalaev fights Alex Pereira at UFC 320.</p><p>Ulberg (13-1) is a breath of fresh air in the light heavyweight division. Ulberg, currently ranked No. 3 by the promotion, is the only fighter in the top seven who hasn't fought for a title. He's won eight straight fights with five stoppages. Most recently, he outpointed former champion Jan Blachowicz. Ulberg believes a title fight is on the horizon, but his sole focus currently is ending Reyes' Cinderella comeback.</p><p>\"After this fight, the UFC will crunch numbers, I'm pretty sure, and hopefully we can get that shot,\" Ulberg told CBS Sports. \"Right now, my mission is to kill Reyes.</p><p>\"We're not going up against a Reyes who wants to get a fight in or a quick paycheck. We're going up against a very motivated, inspired Dominick Reyes, who wants to stake his name again for that title. This is a great test for me.\"  </p>\n<a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mma/news/alex-pereira-reveals-he-was-at-just-40-in-title-loss-to-magomed-anakalev-surprised-i-was-able-to-fight/\" target=\"_blank\">\n        <div>\n            <div>\n                <p>Alex Pereira reveals he was at just 40% in title loss to Magomed Anakalev: 'Surprised I was able to fight'</p>\n                <p>\n                    Brian Campbell                </p>\n            </div>\n                            <div>\n    <figure><img alt=\"Alex Pereira reveals he was at just 40% in title loss to Magomed Anakalev: 'Surprised I was able to fight'\" src=\"https://sportshub.cbsistatic.com/i/r/2025/09/26/8ca13ea5-4bd0-4757-8c7d-c3a5d3f3d7aa/thumbnail/270x152/ac949346388a2ec7de11e9f0f5bc708e/alex-pereira-magomed-ankalaev.jpg\" /></figure>\n                </div>\n                    </div>\n    </a>\n<p>Reyes (15-4) is one of MMA's most compelling stories presently. Starting his career a perfect 12-0, Reyes beat dominant UFC light heavyweight champion Jon Jones in the eyes of just about everyone but the three judges scoring it. Reyes' stock went up in a controversial loss to the champ, but he failed to capitalize on it. Reyes was knocked out in his subsequent fights, each faster than the last, sending his career into free fall. After taking 19 months off, Reyes remedied things with three KO wins. Now, he's on the cusp of another title shot.</p><p>\"I've matured incredibly as a fighter,\" Reyes told CBS Sports' Brian Campbell. \"My approach is completely different, and my stress is far less. I don't worry about every little thing. I know I don't need to be great in every training session. I need to be great on Fight Night. </p><p>\"I'm not back, I'm better. It's crazy that I'm getting better every single day. It's a trippy thing to see. I've been in the UFC for nine years, and I'm getting better every day. I look at myself as a younger fighter and think, 'Damn, I would've smoked that kid.'\"</p>\n<p><strong><em>Check out the full interview with Dominick Reyes below.</em></strong>  </p>\n<p>Ulberg vs. Reyes is a fun main event, but that's about all there is to look forward to as far as storylines. Perth's main card is packed with Oceanic fighters. Aussies Jimmy Crute and Jake Matthews, both of whom are on the comeback, fight separate opponents.</p><p>Below is the rest of the fight card for Saturday, with the latest odds before we get to a prediction and pick on the main event.</p><h2> UFC Fight Night card, odds </h2><table><tbody><tr><th>Favorite<br /> </th><th>Underdog<br /> </th><th>Weight class</th></tr><tr><td>Carlos Ulberg -250</td><td>Dominick Reyes +205</td><td>Light heavyweight</td></tr><tr><td>Jimmy Crute -180</td><td>Ivan Erslan +150</td><td>Light heavyweight  </td></tr><tr><td>Jack Jenkins -280</td><td>Ramos Taveras +230</td><td>Featherweight</td></tr><tr><td>Jake Matthews -430</td><td>Neil Magny +330</td><td>Welterweight</td></tr><tr><td>Justin Tafa -120</td><td>Louie Sutherland +100</td><td>Heavyweight</td></tr><tr><td>Tom Nolan -155</td><td>Charlie Campbell +130</td><td>Lightweight</td></tr></tbody></table><h2> UFC Fight Night viewing information </h2><p><strong>Date:</strong> Sept. 27 | <strong>Start time:</strong> 10 p.m. ET (main card)<br /> <strong>Location:</strong> RAC Arena -- Perth, Australia<br /> <strong>TV channel: </strong>ESPN+</p>\n<h2> Prediction </h2><p><strong>Carlos Ulberg vs. Dominick Reyes:</strong> This is a close fight stylistically. Ulberg and Reyes are strikers with KO power and solid fight IQ. They have comparable striking offense, striking defense, and takedown defense stats. Ulberg has shown more offensive takedown success, but it's negligible. Unable to identify the more skilled fighter, we'll instead examine their liabilities. Reyes' comeback is inspiring, but weathered chins don't heal easily. Beating Dustin Jacoby, Anthony Smith, and Nikita Krylov doesn't do much to ease those concerns. Ulberg has serious power and has taken less damage. That's enough for me to think he'll get the KO in 25 minutes, even if I'm concerned about Ulberg's lack of five-round experience or stoppage wins past Round 1. <strong><em>Ulberg via KO2</em></strong></p>\n            </div>"

    "body": "<div>\n        <p>The Week 4 NFL schedule continues Sunday with 13 more games, 11 of which comprise what is often referred to as the main slate during the afternoon. Injuries have hit the quarterback and running back positions hard in the past few weeks, so NFL DFS players have more challenges when setting NFL DFS lineups as they evaluate matchups such as Cowboys vs. Packers, Ravens vs. Chiefs and Colts vs. Rams, which has the highest over/under of the day at 49.</p><p>How should those injuries play into your NFL DFS strategy for Sunday, and which other daily Fantasy picks should be in your NFL DFS lineups? Before locking in any NFL DFS picks on sites like DraftKings and FanDuel for Sunday, be sure to <a href=\"https://www.sportsline.com/insiders/nfl-dfs-2025-best-fanduel-draftkings-picks-lineup-advice-player-pool-for-week-4-from-a-daily-fantasy-pro/#ttag=09262025_agg_cbssports_dfs_football_nfl_mcclure_SundayDFSMcClure\" target=\"_blank\">check out the NFL DFS advice, strategy, and stacks from SportsLine daily Fantasy expert Mike McClure</a>. </p><p>McClure is a legendary professional DFS player with more than $2 million in career winnings. He uses a powerful prediction model that simulates every snap of NFL action, taking factors such as matchups, statistical trends, and injuries into account. This allows him to find the best DFS values that he shares only with members at SportsLine. His methodology has led to enormous cashes on FanDuel and DraftKings, including. In 2023, he finished tied for first in the DraftKings Millionaire Maker twice and the FanDuel Million once. Anyone who has followed him is way up.</p><p>Now, McClure has turned his attention to the Sunday NFL schedule and just locked in his top daily Fantasy football picks. <a href=\"https://www.sportsline.com/insiders/nfl-dfs-2025-best-fanduel-draftkings-picks-lineup-advice-player-pool-for-week-4-from-a-daily-fantasy-pro/#ttag=09262025_agg_cbssports_dfs_football_nfl_mcclure_SundayDFSMcClure\" target=\"_blank\">You can only see his picks and analysis at SportsLine</a>. </p><p><em>New players can </em><a href=\"https://martech.cbssports.com/bt/redirect/prod?b=draftkings&c=dfs\" target=\"_blank\"><em>get $50 in Pick6 credits at DraftKings when they play $5</em></a><em>: </em></p><h2>Top NFL DFS picks for Week 4</h2><p>One of McClure's top NFL DFS picks for Sunday is Falcons receiver Drake London at $5,700 on DraftKings and $7,100 on FanDuel. London's numbers haven't jumped off the page this season as he enters Week 4 with 16 catches for 159 yards.</p><p>He has 27 targets, however, and that rate should lead to more production for daily Fantasy players going forward. Atlanta plays the Commanders, a team that has already given up four passing touchdowns this season and has given up the eighth-most Fantasy points to opposing receivers. <a href=\"https://www.sportsline.com/insiders/nfl-dfs-2025-best-fanduel-draftkings-picks-lineup-advice-player-pool-for-week-4-from-a-daily-fantasy-pro/#ttag=09262025_agg_cbssports_dfs_football_nfl_mcclure_SundayDFSMcClure\" target=\"_blank\">See who else to roster here</a>.</p><p>Part of McClure's optimal NFL DFS strategy also includes rostering 49ers running back Christian McCaffrey at $8,500 on DraftKings and $9,300 on FanDuel, who has an over/under of 73.5 rushing yards. </p><p>McCaffrey rushing numbers have been a bit underwhelming, but he's again an elite option as a receiver out of the backfield, entering Week 4 with a 25-213-1 receiving line on a whopping 32 targets. The Niners take on the Jaguars in a game with one of the highest over/unders (47) of the day on Sunday. <a href=\"https://www.sportsline.com/insiders/nfl-dfs-2025-best-fanduel-draftkings-picks-lineup-advice-player-pool-for-week-4-from-a-daily-fantasy-pro/#ttag=09262025_agg_cbssports_dfs_football_nfl_mcclure_SundayDFSMcClure\" target=\"_blank\">See who else to roster here</a>.</p><p><em>New users can see the latest </em><span><a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/betting/news/fanduel-promo-code/\" target=\"_blank\"><em>FanDuel promo code</em></a></span><em> to </em><a href=\"https://martech.cbssports.com/bt/redirect/prod?b=fanduel&c=sport\" target=\"_blank\"><em>get $300 in bonus bets at FanDuel if your $5 bet wins</em></a>:</p><h2>How to set NFL DFS lineups for Week 4</h2><p>McClure is targeting another undervalued player who could explode for huge numbers on Sunday This pick could be the difference between winning your tournaments and cash games or going home with nothing. <a href=\"https://www.sportsline.com/insiders/nfl-dfs-2025-best-fanduel-draftkings-picks-lineup-advice-player-pool-for-week-4-from-a-daily-fantasy-pro/#ttag=09262025_agg_cbssports_dfs_football_nfl_mcclure_SundayDFSMcClure\" target=\"_blank\">You can only see who it is, and the rest of McClure's NFL DFS picks, at SportsLine</a>.</p><p><strong>So who is Mike McClure including in his optimal NFL DFS lineups for Sunday, and which under-the-radar player offers huge value? <a href=\"https://www.sportsline.com/insiders/nfl-dfs-2025-best-fanduel-draftkings-picks-lineup-advice-player-pool-for-week-4-from-a-daily-fantasy-pro/#ttag=09262025_agg_cbssports_dfs_football_nfl_mcclure_SundayDFSMcClure\" target=\"_blank\">Visit SportsLine now to see optimal NFL DFS picks, NFL DFS rankings, NFL DFS advice and NFL DFS stacks, all from a daily Fantasy expert with more than $2 million in winnings</a>, and find out. </strong></p>\n            </div>"

    "body": "<div>\n        <p>For all of <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/teams/MISS/ole-miss-rebels/\">Ole Miss</a>' success under coach Lane Kiffin, Rebels fans have grown used to a familiar refrain: close, but no cigar. Time and again, they've been painfully close to breaking through to the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://cbssports.com/college-football/\">College Football</a> Playoff.</p><p>The Rebels arguably should have done it last year when they started 4-0 with five eventual top-100 <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://cbssports.com/nfl/draft/\">NFL Draft</a> picks, including record-setting quarterback Jaxson Dart. They brushed against the playoff in 2023, too, when they won 11 games but failed to beat <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/teams/BAMA/alabama-crimson-tide/\">Alabama</a> and <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/teams/UGA/georgia-bulldogs/\">Georgia</a>.</p><p>This year feels different. In spite of heavy personnel losses and minimal preseason hype, Ole Miss looked every bit like a contender in Week 5 by <span><a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/\" target=\"_blank\">dominating No. 4 LSU in a statement win</a></span>.</p><p>It was a victory that underscored the depth and development Kiffin has built in Oxford. Ole Miss controlled the line of scrimmage on both sides of the ball, piling up 166 yards and scoring two of its three touchdowns on the ground. The Rebels iced the game with an 11-play, 5:04 drive — nearly all runs — capped by a 20-yard fourth-down strike from quarterback <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/players/29754995/trinidad-chambliss/\">Trinidad Chambliss</a> to tight end <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/players/28874125/daequan-wright/\">Dae'Quan Wright</a> that allowed them to kneel out the clock.</p>\n<p>Defensively, the Rebels harassed LSU's patchwork offensive line, tallying one sack and eight quarterback hurries. Without top back <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/players/29388213/caden-durham/\">Caden Durham</a>, the Tigers mustered just 57 yards rushing on 22 carries, their lowest total of the season. The performance was particularly encouraging given Ole Miss had to replace three drafted defensive linemen: first-rounder Walter Nolen, Princely Umanmielen and JJ Pegues.</p><p>Kiffin also struck gold again in the transfer portal. Chambliss, a Division II national champion at Ferris State, didn't even enter the season as the starter. He only took over when <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/players/29159005/austin-simmons/\">Austin Simmons</a> went down with injury, but his blend of poise and playmaking has given Ole Miss a dynamic offensive threat with real Heisman Trophy upside. At this point, it's hard to imagine him heading back to the bench.</p><p>Through five games, Ole Miss looks like a true playoff team. With an early top-five conference win already secured, the Rebels control their own destiny.</p>\n<p>\"After this win over LSU, I'm comfortable putting the Rebels in the playoff in Sharpie as long as they -- at worst -- split games against <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/teams/OKLA/oklahoma-sooners/\">Oklahoma</a> and Georgia,\" CBS Sports College Football Playoff expert Brad Crawford said. \"Losses to both could potentially leave it up to chance with the selection committee. This team looks earmarked for a 10-win floor, though.\"</p><p>Still, the past serves as a cautionary tale. Last season, Ole Miss nearly locked up a playoff spot with a home win over No. 3 Georgia in early November, only to follow with a disastrous loss at unranked <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/teams/FLA/florida-gators/\">Florida</a> that dropped them from playoff certainty to the Gator Bowl. A separate slip-up against <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/teams/UK/kentucky-wildcats/\">Kentucky</a> that season reinforced the thin margin for error.</p><h3>Ole Miss 5-0 Starts in FBS Era (since 1978)</h3><table> <thead><tr><th>Year</th><th>Start</th><th>Finish</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>2025</td><td>5-0</td><td>?</td></tr><tr><td>2022</td><td>7-0</td><td>8-5</td></tr><tr><td>2014</td><td>7-0</td><td>9-4</td></tr></tbody></table><p>Looking ahead, the Rebels' remaining schedule appears manageable. They face just two ranked teams over the final seven games, though both come on the road: No. 5 Georgia and No. 7 Oklahoma. A win in either would all but lock up a playoff bid in a 12-team field. The rest of the slate includes home games against preseason top-15 <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/teams/SC/south-carolina-gamecocks/\">South Carolina</a> and Florida, plus a rivalry trip to a resurgent <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/teams/MISSST/mississippi-state-bulldogs/\">Mississippi State</a> to close the regular season.</p>\n<p>For now, the vibes are immaculate in Oxford. Ole Miss has everything in front of it. Now it's about finishing the job — and this Rebels team looks more capable of doing that than any before it under Kiffin.</p>\n            </div>"

    "body": "<div>\n        <p>Europe is on the precipice of a historic road victory at the 2025 Ryder Cup after another dominant day at Bethpage Black. The Europeans entered the second set of sessions with a commanding 3-point lead and only improved their standing from there, beating the Americans 3-1 in both sessions to take an 11.5 to 4.5 advantage into Sunday singles.   </p><p>That 7-point lead entering the final 12 matches is the largest in modern Ryder Cup history, and as the reigning champions, Europe only needs 2.5 points to retain the cup, 3 points to win it outright.    </p><p>Captain Luke Donald's bunch will be aiming much higher than that as their 18.5 to 9.5 win at the 2004 Ryder Cup is benchmark for dominance on foreign soil this century. Europe has been supremely focused the entire week, as evidenced by its ability to avoid a letdown in either session Saturday. No doubt an all-time performance will be on their collective mind.    </p><p>As for the United States, captain Keegan Bradley's bunch will be hoping for a miracle. No team has ever won more than 8.5 points in Sunday singles, and the American side will need 10 points to claim the trophy.   </p>\n<p>Bradley's message to the team coming out of Saturday's destruction was incredibly on brand for the New Englander: \"28-3. I was at that <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://cbssports.com/nfl/superbowl/\">Super Bowl</a>. I watched it. What a cool thing to have witnessed in person.\"    </p><p>Bradley's problem? His stars have almost completely no-showed to this point. Scottie Scheffler and Bryson DeChambeau are a combined 1-7-0, including a 3 & 2 loss on Saturday afternoon playing together for the first time since 2021. The United States will need a whole team of Tom Bradys to make this tortured comparison work, and nothing has indicated that's possible through four sessions of play at Bethpage Black.    </p><p>Both teams will send their best out early, as Donald hopes to close out the Ryder Cup quickly, while Bradley needs a ton of early points to even make a miraculous comeback a possibility. The most exciting singles match is one many were hoping for to start the week: Scottie Scheffler and Rory McIlroy will square off fourth come Sunday.   </p>\n<p>That could end up being decisive depending what happens inside the first three matches ahead of them, but it may not be as dramatic as fans hoped it would be entering the week.   </p><p>Check out a full breakdown of the <span><a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/golf/news/ryder-cup-2025-schedule-dates-format-explained-teams-bethpage-black/\" target=\"_blank\">2025 Ryder Cup schedule and playing format</a></span> along with a complete <span><a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/golf/news/ryder-cup-2025-tv-schedule-how-to-watch-live-tee-times/\" target=\"_blank\">2025 Ryder Cup TV schedule and coverage guide</a></span> so you can watch all the remaining action Sunday    </p><h2>          2025 Ryder Cup matchups: Day 3 (Sunday)</h2><p><em>Odds via <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/betting/news/draftkings-promo-code/\">DraftKings Sportsbook</a></em></p><p><em>Session 5 -- Singles<br />        </em>        </p><table><tbody><tr><th>Match</th><th>Europe</th><th>Tee time</th><th>United States</th></tr><tr><td><p>17 \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t</p></td><td>Justin Rose<br /> +105<br />  </td><td>12:02 p.m.</td><td><p>Cameron Young<br /> -145<br />   \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>18 \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t</p></td><td>\t\t\t\tTommy Fleetwood<br />-145</td><td>\t\t\t\t12:13 p.m.</td><td><p>Justin Thomas<br />+105</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>19 \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t</p></td><td>\t\t\t\tMatt Fitzpatrick<br />+130</td><td>\t\t\t\t12:24 p.m.</td><td><p>Bryson DeChambeau -160<br />   \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>20 \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t</p></td><td>\t\t\t\tRory McIlroy<br />+120</td><td>\t\t\t\t12:35 p.m.</td><td><p>Scottie Scheffler<br />-145</p></td></tr><tr><td>21</td><td>Ludvig Åberg<br />+110</td><td>\t\t\t\t12:46 p.m.</td><td>\t\t\t\tPatrick Cantlay<br />-135</td></tr><tr><td>22</td><td>\t\t\t\tJon Rahm<br />-145</td><td>\t\t\t\t12:57 p.m.</td><td>\t\t\t\tXander Schauffele<br />+120</td></tr><tr><td>23</td><td>\t\t\t\tSepp Straka<br />+115</td><td>\t\t\t\t1:08 p.m.</td><td>\t\t\t\tJ.J.

    "body": "<div>\n        <p>It's a missed opportunity for Inter Miami as they went north of the border and drew against Toronto FC, 1-1, on Saturday. Chasing the Supporters' Shield, Toronto denied Miami a chance to pick up three necessary points in the race for the top spot in MLS. The Herons still have a game in hand on most of the league, but now, the Philadelphia Union can go six points clear atop the league by the end of the matchday.</p><p>Toronto FC goalkeeper Sean Johnson had an impressive match, saving six shots, three of those on Lionel Messi, who put four shots on target for an xG of 0.73. Near the end of the first half, Tadeo Allende put the Herons ahead, and it would've seemed like they'd leave with all three points. </p><p>But the defense had other ideas, and in the second half of play, Toronto midfielder Djordje Mihailovic found space in the box, and right back Richie Laryea did an excellent job keeping the ball in play and finding him for the equalizer, which keeper Oscar Ustari could do nothing about. It's yet another defensive breakdown for Miami, and these are moments that have plagued them all season. The attack has masked those flaws, but as we reach the business end of the MLS season, Miami will have to clean these mistakes up.</p>\n<p>Losing to Atlanta United in the first round of the MLS Cup playoffs will still loom in the memories of this team, especially after it caused an overhaul of the squad and coaching staff. After adding Rodrigo De Paul during the summer, these defensive lapses were supposed to be cleaned up, but they're still worrisome. A team with Messi and Luis Suarez shouldn't be losing the xG battle to a Toronto FC side who are close to the bottom of the Eastern Conference. Miami still control their fate in the Supporters' Shield, but if they don't win out, it will lead to more disappointment in a season that hasn't lived up to expectations domestically.</p>\n<p>Getting through to the last 16 of the FIFA Club World Cup is something that no MLS team has done before, but when that's coupled with falling in the Concacaf Champions Cup and Leagues Cup, Javier Mascherano's men will need to win multiple trophies to meet preseason expectations. It's the nature of being a team filled with stars, but in drawing Toronto, Miami showed that at times, they can still play like a collection of individuals. If that happens during the playoffs, it will only be met with another season of disappointment. </p>\n            </div>"

Washington knows how valuable Daniels is and will be cautious, especially after seeing Mariota play well against Las Vegas. If Daniels is good to go, though, how close to 100% is he? Last year, he didn't miss any games, but a midseason rib injury limited his scrambling abilities for several weeks.</p><p><strong>Can surprising pass rushes keep up strong starts?</strong> The Commanders have the fourth-highest pressure rate (47%) in the NFL through three weeks, and the Falcons are 10th at 42%.

The other one will fall into an 0-4 hole after the first month of the season.</p><p>The Texans were expected to compete atop the AFC South this fall, but they are behind the eight ball after an 0-3 start. The most frustrating part for Houston is that all three games were winnable. Each defeat has come by just one score, and the team's point differential is just minus-13. While the defense has held up its side of the bargain, the Texans' offense has been a major issue. Quarterback C.J. Stroud has not looked comfortable, and the running game hasn't gained much traction either.</p><p><em><a href=\"https://martech.cbssports.com/bt/redirect/prod?b=draftkings&c=sport\" target=\"_blank\">Click here to bet Texans vs. Titans at DraftKings Sportsbook</a>, where users can get $200 in bonus bets instantly with a $5 wager and over $200 off NFL Sunday Ticket:</em></p><p>As bad as things have been for the Texans, they've been even worse for the Titans. Tennessee is tied with the New Orleans Saints for the worst point differential in the league at minus-43. Cam Ward has had his moments of brilliance, but he has made his share of rookie mistakes, in addition to being let down by his supporting cast. Ward will face one of his biggest tests to this point on Sunday as he goes up against a Texans defense allowing just 17.0 points per game. If the Titans are going to get their first win in the Ward era, the defense may have to keep a lid on this struggled Texans offense.</p><p>Everything you need to know about this clash of desperate AFC South foes, including broadcast info, can be found below.</p>\n<h2>Where to watch Texans vs. Titans live</h2><ul><li><strong>Date</strong>: Sunday, Sept. 28 | <strong>Time</strong>: 1 p.m. ET</li><li><strong>Location</strong>: NRG Stadium -- Houston, Texas</li><li><strong>TV: </strong>CBS | <strong>Stream: </strong><a href=\"https://www.paramountplus.com/shows/nfl-on-cbs/news/1010769/how-to-watch-titans-games-live-titans-nfl-schedule/\" target=\"_blank\">Paramount+</a></li><li><strong>Follow:</strong> <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mobile\">CBS Sports App</a></li><li><strong>Odds:</strong> Texans -7; O/U 39.5 (via <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/betting/news/draftkings-promo-code/\">DraftKings</a>)</li></ul><h2>Texans vs. Titans: Need to know</h2><p><strong>C.J. Stroud has had early struggles.</strong> Since his spectacular rookie season, Stroud seems to have regressed, and <span><a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/news/nfl-quarterback-grades-rookie-deals-stroud-mccarthy-maye/\" target=\"_blank\">his 2025 campaign is off to an abysmal start</a></span>. He's averaging under 200 yards per game, and he's thrown three interceptions to just two touchdowns. Stroud's QBR of 40.1 ranks 26th among the 32 starting quarterbacks. Over his last 15 starts, Stroud has totaled 15 touchdowns while throwing 12 interceptions. In all fairness, Stroud has gotten little help from his offensive line or running game, but Houston needs him to get back on track in order to compete for a playoff spot.</p><p><strong>There's a new play caller in Nashville.</strong> After an 0-3 start, Brian Callahan is feeling the heat, and he has chosen to give up the play calling duties. Callahan has tabbed Titans quarterbacks coach Bo Hardegree as the new play caller, and he will try to breathe some life into an offense that ranks 28h in the NFL at 17.0 points per game. Hardegree does have some limited play calling experience in his past as the interim offensive coordinator of the Las Vegas Raiders in 2023. With Hardegree now calling the plays, will that allow Callahan to avoid some of the tactical mistakes that have plagued him in the early going?</p><p><strong>Houston must avoid disaster.</strong> Coming into the season, the Texans were the betting favorite to win the AFC South. Things have changed rather quickly. According to BetMGM, Houston is now at distant third to win the division at +700. That's what an 0-3 start -- as well as a sputtering offense -- will do. If the Texans lose this game and drop to 0-4, getting to the postseason would be a Herculean task. Houston cannot afford to drop this game against a Tennessee team that has been reeling thus far.</p>\n<h2>Texans vs. Titans prediction, pick<br /></h2>\n<p>The Texans are 7-point favorites at home against the Titans, and while that seems like a big number for an 0-3 team, it does make some sense based on how these two teams have played. Houston's offense has been terrible to this point, but it's been very competitive in all three of its losses. The same can't be said for Tennessee, which has lost each of its games by at least eight points. The Texans need a win in order to buoy their playoff hopes heading into October, and they are the more talented team on paper. Houston will be desperate, and its defense will give Ward problems all afternoon. <strong><em>Pick: Texans, Under 39.5</em></strong></p>\n            </div>"

The 49ers have managed to start out 3-0 despite being without starting quarterback Brock Purdy for the last two games while he deals with a toe injury. In place of Purdy, the 49ers have had former first-round pick Mac Jones under center, who has led them to wins over the New Orleans Saints and Arizona Cardinals. Purdy has been taking first-team reps in practice, so it appears that he is trending towards playing on Sunday.</p><p><em><a href=\"https://martech.cbssports.com/bt/redirect/prod?b=fanduel&c=sport\" target=\"_blank\">Click here to bet 49ers vs. Jaguars at FanDuel Sportsbook</a>, where new users get $300 in bonus bets with a winning $5 wager:</em></p><p>On the other hand, the Jaguars are entering Week 4 coming off a 17-10 win against their division rivals in the Houston Texans. Under new coach Liam Coen, Jacksonville has proved to be one of the better offenses around the league. The unit has been paced by running back Travis Etienne Jr., who has racked up 5.9 yards per carry on the season. The Jaguars are looking to record their first 3-1 start since 2018.</p>\n<h2>Where to watch 49ers vs. Jaguars live</h2><ul><li><strong>Date:</strong> Sunday, Sept. 28 | <strong>Time:</strong> 4:05 p.m. ET</li><li><strong>Where:</strong> Levi's Stadium -- Santa Clara, California</li><li><strong>TV channel:</strong> Fox |<strong> Stream:</strong> <a href=\"https://www.fubo.tv/welcome/leagues/191277?irad=356362&irmp=416484&sharedid=HTW\" target=\"_blank\">Fubo</a> (Try for free)</li><li><strong>Follow:</strong> <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mobile\" target=\"_blank\">CBS Sports App</a></li><li><strong>Odds:</strong> 49ers -3.5; O/U 46.5 (via DraftKings)</li></ul><h2>Jaguars vs. 49ers: Need to know</h2><p><strong>Jaguars looking for a bounce-back effort from Trevor Lawrence: </strong>It's been a mixed bag as far as what Lawrence has brought to the table through three games. After a three-touchdown performance against the Bengals in Week 2, the Jaguars signal caller struggled to solve the Texans defense as he completed just 20 of 40 passes for 222 yards to go along with zero touchdowns and an interception. Entering Week 4, the 49ers boast the fifth-best pass defense in the league as they're surrendering just 162.0 passing yards per game. Lawrence will have to bring his \"A\" game if he wants to lead his team to victory.</p><p><strong>Which quarterback starts for the 49ers? </strong>It's currently unclear who will be under center for the 49ers on Sunday. However, considering that Brock Purdy is taking first-team reps, it's likely that the veteran quarterback will get the start this week. If Purdy is able to go, it could give the 49ers offense a much-needed jolt. </p><p><strong>Can the 49ers get pressure without Nick Bosa? </strong>The 49ers lost their star pass rusher to a torn ACL in last Sunday's game. San Francisco has managed to tally just five sacks in three games this season and that's when Bosa was on the field. Without Bosa in the lineup, the 49ers will need to create pressure in order to make life difficult for Lawrence. 2025 first-round pick Mykel Williams and veteran Bryce Huff will certainly need to help fill the void in that department going forward.<strong> </strong></p>\n<h2>Jaguars vs. 49ers pick, prediction</h2>\n<p>It's hard to trust the Jaguars considering that they have to travel across the country for this matchup. The 49ers may be banged up, but Purdy could be back in the lineup and they still have Christian McCaffrey. At the end of the day, trusting the home team feels like the safe play, especially if Purdy is healthy enough to start. <strong><em>Pick: 49ers, Under 46.5</em></strong></p>\n            </div>"

Detroit has responded emphatically, drubbing the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/CHI/chicago-bears/\">Bears</a> by 31 points in Week 2 and winning in convincing style in Baltimore last Sunday. </p>\n<p>A big reason for the Lions' resurgence is <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/2061053/jared-goff/\">Jared Goff</a> and the running back duo of <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/2261252/david-montgomery/\">David Montgomery</a> and <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/3162723/jahmyr-gibbs/\">Jahmyr Gibbs</a>. Goff paces the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://cbssports.com/nfl/\">NFL</a> in completion percentage, while Montgomery and Gibbs recently <span><a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/news/lions-running-backs-david-montgomery-jahmyr-gibbs-make-history-once-again-in-monday-night-win-against-ravens/\" target=\"_blank\">became the first duo in history</a></span> to each score rushing touchdowns in the same game 11 times. </p><p><strong>Detroit's prolific pass rush. </strong>Back from injury, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/2968514/aidan-hutchinson/\">Aidan Hutchinson</a> looks like his former pass-rushing self with two sacks so far. He's been one-half of a menacing pass rushing duo that also includes 30-year-old <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/2078992/al-quadin-muhammad/\">Al-Quadin Muhammad</a>, who leads the team with 3.5 sacks. </p><p><strong>One glaring weakness. </strong>The Lions' Achilles heel on defense has been third down. The unit is 30th in the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://cbssports.com/nfl/\">NFL</a> in third-down efficiency as opponents have converted on exactly half (17 of 34) of their third-down attempts. If Cleveland is going to make this a game, they'll have to exploit this clear weakness. </p>\n<p><strong>An obvious strength.</strong> The Browns may 30th in the NFL in scoring, but they're eighth in the league in red zone efficiency. Cleveland needs to get inside the red zone more, however, as they have had just seven trips inside the 20-yard-line. </p><p><strong>A new weapon in Cleveland.</strong> The Browns' offense has received a recent spark from rookie running back Quinshon Judkins. After missing the team's season-opener, Judkins ran for 61 yards on 10 carries in Cleveland's Week 2 loss to Baltimore. He had an impressive 94 yards and a touchdown on 18 carries in last week's win over Green Bay. </p><h2>Browns vs. Lions prediction, pick </h2>\n<p>I expect a high-scoring game between two teams that have veteran quarterbacks in Goff and <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/1250697/joe-flacco/\">Joe Flacco</a>. While the Browns' offense will have their moments, I don't expect them to keep pace with the Lions unless <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/2139869/myles-garrett/\">Myles Garrett</a> and Cleveland's defense forces multiple turnovers. <em><strong>Pick: Lions, over 44.5 </strong></em></p>\n            </div>"

It's back to the drawing board for Brian Kelly following his <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/news/lsu-ole-miss-game-score-live-updates/live/\" target=\"_blank\">fourth-ranked Tigers' 24-19 loss to the Rebels</a>, who have situated themselves in the top-tier of the SEC nearing midseason.</p><p>It's <span><a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/news/lsu-fanbase-could-turn-on-coach-brian-kelly-if-he-falters-in-2025-former-champion-marcus-spears-says/\" target=\"_blank\">College Football Playoff or bust this season</a></span> for Kelly, and he knows it, especially after his program pushed all of its resources toward the center of the table this offseason and equipped him with one of the most talented rosters in the country through the transfer portal.</p><p>A Week 5 conference loss on the road is an eye-opener for a team that has largely struggled offensively, from protecting its franchise quarterback in <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/players/26701706/garrett-nussmeier/\">Garrett Nussmeier</a> behind a banged up offensive line to finding any semblance of a rushing attack.</p><p>This is <span><a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/news/pressure-mounts-on-brian-kelly-as-lsu-secures-2025-transfer-portal-haul-that-must-yield-championship-results/\" target=\"_blank\">when the pressure really mounts for Kelly,</a></span> whose team still has to play four nationally ranked SEC opponents over their final seven games of the season. <span><a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/news/bowl-projections-miami-florida-state-on-collision-course-to-shake-up-cfp-race-texas-tech-keeps-pace/\" target=\"_blank\">Projected as a playoff entry coming into the weekend</a></span>, LSU now must take advantage of remaining opportunities with few slip-ups over the next two months to try and finish with double-digit wins.</p>\n<p>The opening victory at <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/teams/CLEM/clemson-tigers/\">Clemson</a> no longer holds much significance in the nonconference, and the Tigers' first SEC victory over <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/teams/FLA/florida-gators/\">Florida</a> earlier this month came against a team in the middle of a spiral.</p><p>LSU has now lost three straight to Ole Miss away from Tiger Stadium, its last win coming during the 2019 national championship season. That's where the program's decision-makers and mega boosters expect to ascend under Kelly, but he's now lost eight times over his first 26 SEC games and, in another spotlight opportunity, got out-coached head to head.</p><h2>How it happened ... and how will LSU respond?</h2><p>Ole Miss went gap to gap throughout and beat the Tigers at the point of attack, pounding one of the country's best defenses and staying one step ahead on third down.</p>\n<p>Kelly knows the margin for error was always small with this team. <span><a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/news/watch-brian-kelly-go-nuclear-on-question-after-lsus-win-over-florida-we-played-the-game-to-win-the-game/\" target=\"_blank\">He showed as much a few weeks ago after going nuclear on a reporter following LSU's win</a></span> over Florida after his offense failed to show. The Tigers made enough plays to win, piggy-backing off five interceptions from <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/players/28904801/dj-lagway/\">DJ Lagway</a> to prevail.</p><p>There were no gifts to be had this time around against a quality conference opponent, besides a fumble from Ole Miss wideout <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/players/29121999/cayden-lee/\">Cayden Lee</a> into the end zone in the first half. Rebels quarterback <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/players/29754995/trinidad-chambliss/\">Trinidad Chambliss</a> kept the chains moving several times with his legs and executed the 2-minute flawlessly at the end of the first half with a fourth-down conversion following by a play-action touchdown pass to Lee with 13 seconds to play in the second quarter.</p><p>Ole Miss led 17-7 at the break despite 10 penalties, another point of frustration for Kelly and a staff that simply had no answers for what Lane Kiffin, Charlie Weis Jr. and this team was hurling at them. Chambliss's fourth-and-3 connection to  <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/players/28874125/daequan-wright/\">Dae'Quan Wright</a> to ice it was icing on the cake, sending Kiffin into jubilation on the sideline.</p>\n<p>While the Rebels' playoff path is now crystal clear with one of the SEC's most favorable schedules left, LSU will likely have to finish 6-1 the rest of the way to ensure an at-large spot in the 12-team bracket.</p><p>The Tigers have to play <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/teams/VANDY/vanderbilt-commodores/\">Vanderbilt</a>, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/teams/BAMA/alabama-crimson-tide/\">Alabama</a> and <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/teams/OKLA/oklahoma-sooners/\">Oklahoma</a> away from home and host unbeaten <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/teams/TXAM/texas-am-aggies/\">Texas A&M</a> in a few weeks. It's a brutal stretch for a team that assumed it would be entering October without a loss. </p>\n            </div>"

    "body": "<div>\n        <p>Lane Kiffin made sure the postgame celebration after Ole Miss' 24-19 win over No. 4 LSU came with a side of trolling. Shocking, right? Just minutes after the No. 13 ranked Rebels extended their unbeaten start to 5-0, Kiffin took to social media to have a little fun at the expense of LSU coach Brian Kelly. </p><p>Earlier in the week, Kelly had confidently predicted that LSU would keep the Magnolia Trophy in Baton Rouge \"where it deserves to be.\" Kiffin, naturally, had other plans.</p><p>Within 30 minutes of the final whistle, Kiffin shared a photo of Kelly's quote.</p>\n<p>Kiffin's trolling didn't stop there. Even his dog, Juice, posted to his own social media account a photo of a Rebels-themed hat with the text, \"BRIAN KELLY CAN'T RUN THE DAMN BALL.\"</p>\n<p>Kiffin later joked in the postgame press conference about the win and its ripple effect, noting that avoiding a $500,000 fine for a field storm, \"gets you half of one of [LSU's] defensive backs,\" a tongue-in-cheek reference to the transfer portal.</p>\n<p>Ole Miss put together a performance that left little doubt about their status as an SEC contender, controlling both sides of the ball. LSU, which had allowed only four touchdowns in its first four games, struggled to keep up. The Tigers managed just 254 total yards while converting only 2 of 11 third-down opportunities.</p><p>LSU's game was particularly ineffective without starting running back Caden Durham, producing just 57 yards on 22 carries, while injuries at receiver and heavy defensive pressure left quarterback Garrett Nussmeier unable to consistently generate offense.</p><p>Even with a few costly turnovers and 14 penalties that could have widened the margin, Ole Miss dominated the game flow. </p><p>Quarterback Trinidad Chambliss repeatedly found open space, making decisive plays to finish 23 of 39 for 314 yards with one touchdown and one interception.</p>\n<p>By the time the final whistle blew, Ole Miss had not only handed LSU its first loss of the season but also added another statement win to Lane Kiffin's growing list of signature victories in Oxford.</p>\n            </div>"
