    "body": "<div>\n        <p>Thirty-five of Mike Gundy's 58 years on Earth have been spent either playing for, or coaching at, his alma mater <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-basketball/teams/OKLAST/oklahoma-state-cowboys/\">Oklahoma State</a>.</p><p>The remaining years of his life will be spent doing anything other than that.</p><p>The school on Tuesday <span><a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/news/mike-gundy-fired-oklahoma-state-head-coach/\" target=\"_blank\">fired Gundy</a></span> after a 1-2 start in a shocking in-season move that gets it out of the Mike Gundy business for good. Gundy, the second-longest tenured FBS head coach, had been at the helm of the program since 2005 and led it to its highest heights in history: a Big 12 title in 2011, eight seasons or 10 or more wins and an accumulation of 170 total victories across his two decades. Among active head coaches, he ranked third in wins at his current school. He steps away as OSU football's winningest coach.</p><p>The program had just three 10-win seasons prior to his hiring as head coach in 2005 — and two of those seasons (1987 and 1988) came when he was the starting quarterback playing alongside Barry Sanders and Thurman Thomas in the same backfield. </p><p>Gundy has not just been synonymous with the program. He has <em>been </em>the program.</p><p>In 2005, Gundy took over a football team that was not just an afterthought in its own state -- where it was well behind the University of <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-basketball/teams/OKLA/oklahoma-sooners/\">Oklahoma</a> -- but also within its own walls. Prior to his tenure, thanks to the Eddie Sutton era, OSU was largely considered a basketball school that also had a football program with a rundown stadium and next to no winning infrastructure. Les Miles helped change that perception when he took over in 2001 (with Gundy serving as assistant head coach and offensive coordinator) but the program was largely unsuccessful and thus uninterested in committing resources to changing that trajectory.</p>\n<p>That changed under Gundy and coincided with what will be known forever as the golden era of OSU football.</p><a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/news/mike-gundys-oklahoma-state-career-by-the-numbers-future-hall-of-fame-coachs-legacy-in-stillwater-unmatched/\" target=\"_blank\">\n        <div>\n            <div>\n                <p>Mike Gundy's Oklahoma State career by the numbers: Future Hall of Fame coach's legacy in Stillwater unmatched</p>\n                <p>\n                    Shehan Jeyarajah                </p>\n            </div>\n                            <div>\n    <figure><img alt=\"Mike Gundy's Oklahoma State career by the numbers: Future Hall of Fame coach's legacy in Stillwater unmatched\" src=\"https://sportshub.cbsistatic.com/i/r/2025/09/23/ad793747-4a38-408d-b29c-2d6764336ea3/thumbnail/270x152/a2c0997ff2eb4a9de0347f01cb381117/gundy.jpg\" /></figure>\n                </div>\n                    </div>\n    </a>\n<h2>T. Boone Pickens' donations</h2><p>In December 2005, 11 months after Gundy was tabbed as OSU's head football coach, billionaire OSU alumnus T. Boone Pickens donated $165 million to the athletic program. It set a record for the largest single gift given to an NCAA program and came after he donated $70 million two years prior.</p><p>That inextricably tied Gundy and Pickens together as the Cowboys program rallied from a Big 12 afterthought to a Big 12 juggernaut.</p>\n<p>OSU in Gundy's first season went 4-7 — and turned out to be the start of a bowl streak that ran 18 seasons before crashing last year with an abysmal 3-9 campaign.</p><p>Pickens and Gundy often feuded over the years, the source of which owing to responsibility for unprecedented success in Stillwater on the gridiron (and Pickens' displeasure with Gundy's record against rival Oklahoma). </p><p>Pickens died six years ago this month, but his legacy as the school's largest benefactor -- and perhaps the driving force behind OSU football's revival -- lives on.</p>\n<h2>Bowl streak</h2><p>OSU went 4-7 in Gundy's first season as he laid the foundation for what was ahead. Nearly a dozen players were expelled from the team as a part of setting and changing the culture.</p><p>The following year OSU went 7-6 and made a bowl, which began a streak of 18 consecutive years of bowl eligibility, the longest such streak in program history.</p><p>That streak was imperiled on numerous occasions -- most notably in 2014, when a burned-out Gundy entered the regular-season finale with a 5-6 record. But against rival Oklahoma, Tyreek Hill returned a magical punt for a score that culminated with a 38-35 overtime win over the Sooners, in the process breathing new life into Gundy and the program. They won their bowl game that season and launched into the Mason Rudolph era, which resulted in three subsequent 10-win seasons.</p>\n<p>The bowl streak came to a crashing end last season after OSU opened the season 3-0 and lost its final nine games. It is now expected to start a new streak -- one of a bowl drought -- thanks to a 1-2 start. <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/college-football/fpi/_/sort/fpi.projectedw/dir/desc\" target=\"_blank\">ESPN's Football Power Index</a> projects OSU to finish with just two wins and gives it just a 0.2% chance of reaching six wins.</p><h2>Building a monster</h2><p>The 2008 and 2009 seasons saw OSU win nine games -- which it had only done once since the 1980s -- and that propelled it to a new level in the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://cbssports.com/college-football/\">college football</a> universe. It won 11 games in 2010 and set up the Cowboys, led by quarterback Brandon Weeden and receiver Justin Blackmon, for a huge 2011 season.</p><p>Those lofty expectations were exceeded, as OSU went 12-1 and narrowly missed the BCS title game after a late-season loss to <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-basketball/teams/IOWAST/iowa-state-cyclones/\">Iowa State</a>. They won the Fiesta Bowl that postseason over Andrew Luck and <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-basketball/teams/STNFRD/stanford-cardinal/\">Stanford</a>.</p>\n<p>The 2010s had plenty more good in store as OSU won 10 or more games in 2013, 2015, 2016 and 2017, and each year held conference title contention aspirations. Following a 7-6 2014 campaign, Gundy acknowledged to ESPN in an interview that expectations were not what they once were.</p><p>He had changed the trajectory for the better and was responsible for its successes while shouldering its failures.</p><p>\"We have created this monster,\" <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/blog/big12/post/_/id/99068/oklahoma-states-rise-includes-patience-pitfalls-for-mike-gundy\" target=\"_blank\">Gundy said in 2015</a>. \"Now we have to feed it.\"</p><h2>A promise to make change</h2><p>In June 2020, amid the global pandemic and a racial awakening in the aftermath of George Floyd's murder, Gundy was photographed at a lake next to two of his sons wearing a One America News Network (OAN) shirt.</p>\n<p>The photo spawned an outcry among among his players, who are largely Black, over its insensitivity and indifference because of how the far-right, pro-Donald Trump network handled the Black Lives Matter movement. All-American running back Chuba Hubbard threatened to boycott anything related to the school until things changed.</p><p>OSU formed a diversity council in the aftermath of that. Its conclusion was that Gundy was not racist, but rather insensitive and tone deaf.</p><p>Gundy called himself a <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/news/oklahoma-state-coach-mike-gundy-calls-himself-a-dumbass-for-wearing-oan-t-shirt/\">dumbass</a> for it and was hit with a $1 million pay cut after a two-week review of his program.</p>\n<p>That saga ended with Hubbard and Gundy making nice on video. </p><p>\"I'm looking forward to making some changes,\" Gundy said. \"It starts at the top with me.\"</p><p>What those changes were remain unclear. Gundy demurred when asked about changes, and it's unclear what, if any, oversight there was to ensure changes were applied. </p>\n<h2>A 2021 rally back to relevance</h2><p>OSU finished 8-3 in 2020 after being picked second in the Big 12 preseason media poll. After a scandal-ridden summer, questions loomed over the future of the program.</p>\n<p>Gundy rallied that offseason and mounted a 12-win season that ended inches shy of a Big 12 title and College Football Playoff berth.</p><h2>Cracks showing</h2><p>Some good and some not-so-good ensued in the following years. OSU went 7-6 in 2022. Then in 2023, it won 10 games again behind the prolific power running game attack spearheaded by star running back Ollie Gordon.</p><p>It was a brilliant campaign and another double-digit win season, which helped gloss over an ugly September home loss to <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-basketball/teams/SALAB/south-alabama-jaguars/\">South Alabama</a>.</p>\n<p>The next year was not as kind. In 2024, OSU stumbled to a 3-9 record, its worst season of the Gundy era. It lost its final 10 games after beating <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-basketball/teams/TULSA/tulsa-golden-hurricane/\">Tulsa</a> in September. Gundy's automatic-renewing deal was restructured earlier this year after that season to include another $1 million paycut.</p><p>Losing to Tulsa at home last weekend appears to have been the final straw. OSU looked lifeless against a program it has no business losing to, punctuating an ugly 0-2 September that began with a 69-3 defeat at <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-basketball/teams/OREG/oregon-ducks/\">Oregon</a>. <span><a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/news/by-the-numbers-why-oklahoma-states-loss-to-oregon-was-somehow-worse-than-the-lopsided-score-for-mike-gundy/\" target=\"_blank\">It was the program's most lopsided loss since Nov. 9, 1907</a></span> -- one week before Oklahoma became a state.</p><h2>Constant public missteps</h2><p>It wasn't just Gundy's attire that irked fans and players. His words delivered plenty of heartache internally and externally, too.</p><p>Before last season, after Gordon was arrested on suspicion of drunk driving, Gundy downplayed the severity of it and admitted in front of cameras: \"I've probably done that a thousand times in my life, and it was just fine.\"</p><p>During the 2024 season, amid criticism coaching a team that went 0-9 in Big 12 play, Gundy further sowed grief among fans by saying that criticism about his team comes from people \"who can't pay their own bills.\"</p><p>\"In most cases, the people that are negative and voicing their opinions are the same ones that can't pay their own bills,\" he said. \"They're not taking care of themselves. They're not taking care of their own family. They're not taking care of their own job. But they have an obligation to speak out and complain about others because it makes them feel better. But then in the end, when they go to bed at night, they're the same failure that they were before they said anything negative about anybody else.\"</p><p>Gundy was forced to issue a public half-apology via a written statement in a backdoor-battle that caused consternation within the administration. </p><h2>The irony of the end</h2><p>Sporting his famous mullet and strolling along an ESPN reporter in 2017, Gundy cut loose talking about his donkey named Blackjack who has a \"really bad attitude,\" his love of hunting and his hair routine. (He's a butch wax guy.)</p><p>That was a perfect encapsulation of the good Gundy: loose, funny and unafraid to say anything. It's in part what made him one of the original viral stars after his famous \"<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zQ3oXkDPKbM\">I'm a man, I'm 40</a>\" rant\" in which he unleashed on a reporter while defending his quarterback in 2007.</p><p>Now the same coach famous for being loose is being let go in part for being too loose — and it <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://x.com/FOXSports/status/1970080643565662403\">comes 18 years and one day removed</a> from that now-famous tirade.</p>\n            </div>"

After more than two decades at the helm, the Cowboys announced Tuesday that Gundy, 58, has been fired following a steep decline over the past two seasons. Once a consistent contender in the Big 12, Gundy's final stretch included a 3-9 season in 2024 and a 1-2 start to 2025 after a stunning loss to <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/teams/TULSA/tulsa-golden-hurricane/\">Tulsa</a> in Week 4.</p><p>But Gundy's legacy isn't measured in wins alone. Between his viral \"I'm a man! I'm 40!\" rant to the legendary mullet, Gundy became a social media mainstay long before viral highlights were mandatory.

The outburst came after a 49-45 win against <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/teams/TXTECH/texas-tech-red-raiders/\">Texas Tech</a>, when Gundy derailed a press conference to defend quarterback Bobby Reid from what he believed was unfair criticism in a column published in The Oklahoman. Holding up a copy of the paper, Gundy launched into a fiery rant that included the now-immortal line: <em>\"I'm a man, I'm 40!\"</em></p>\n<p>The clip quickly spread beyond college football, becoming late-night comedy material and one of the first viral sports videos of the YouTube era. While his delivery drew laughs, the eruption cemented Gundy's reputation as a combative, outspoken coach unafraid to challenge the media.</p>\n<h2>The mullet era (2016-present)</h2><p>Gundy's mullet became as much a trademark as his playbook during the later years of his tenure, earning national attention and making him one of college football's most recognizable coaches. Sporting the long, flowing hair since around 2016, Gundy embraced the look with the same confidence he brought to the sideline, turning a personal style choice into a cultural phenomenon.</p><p>By the late 2010s, Gundy's mullet had spawned memes, merchandise and national media features, turning a simple haircut into a viral emblem of his larger-than-life personality.</p>\n<figure><p><img alt=\"mike-gundy-mullet.jpg\" src=\"https://sportshub.cbsistatic.com/i/r/2025/09/23/8820b9bd-f911-4a7f-8b3e-8e4f2011bd0f/resize/670x377/5c025f0181c28c29327740feeb51b8a6/mike-gundy-mullet.jpg\" /></p><figcaption><span>\n                                                                    Getty Images\n                                                            </span></figcaption></figure><h2>Mike Gundy's Justin Bieber Ringtone (2011)</h2><p>In an unexpected twist, Gundy became a viral sensation off the field when then-16-year-old pop star Justin Bieber set the infamous \"I'm a man, I'm 40!\" soundbite as his ringtone. During a radio interview, Bieber said he thought the clip was funny enough to use for every call.</p><p>That revelation caught the attention of Gundy, who embraced the humor, changing his own ringtone to a snippet of Bieber's hit song \"Baby.\" During a press conference in February 2011, Gundy received a phone call mid-briefing with the ringtone blaring loudly, interrupting his introduction of new assistant coaches.</p>\n<h2><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/teams/OKLA/oklahoma-sooners/\">Oklahoma</a> rattlesnake hunt (2017)</h2><p>In 2017, Gundy took a break from the sidelines for a decidedly unconventional adventure: <span><a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/news/look-oklahoma-state-coach-mike-gundy-is-now-hunting-gigantic-rattlesnakes/\" target=\"_blank\">rattlesnake hunting in rural Oklahoma</a></span>. Armed with little more than a stick, the Oklahoma State coach participated in the Okeene Rattlesnake Round-Up, an event held annually for more than 80 years.</p>\n<p>The festival, a staple of the region, features live snake-handling demonstrations, a \"Den of Death\" show, and opportunities for attendees to hunt, buy or sell snakes. Gundy, joined by guides Todd and Wild Bill, braved the rattlesnakes' venomous fans, an unusual sight for a college football coach but a testament to his willingness to embrace rugged Oklahoma culture.</p>\n<h2>Oklahoma State wrestling promo (2017)</h2><p>Gundy became an unlikely viral figure once again through a <span><a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/news/watch-there-are-many-incredible-things-happening-in-this-mike-gundy-promo-video/\" target=\"_blank\">40-second promo video highlighting Oklahoma State's wrestling program</a></span>. The clip featured the team in action, but what made it unforgettable was Gundy himself appearing on-screen in a wrestling singlet, delivering deadpan commentary while sporting his signature mullet and, of course, the ever-present \"Big Daddy\" mug.</p><h2>Best-of-the-rest: More Gundy viral moments</h2><p>Beyond his headline-grabbing clips, Gundy produced countless smaller but memorable viral moments. From dancing in the locker room to playfully mocking media questions, he consistently found ways to entertain with his dry humor and candid interviews.</p>\n<p>Thanks for the laughs, Mike.</p>\n            </div>"

Through three weeks, the Patriots haven't gained much ground at 1-2, while the Bills have taken firm control of the division at 3-0. Originally, the Week 4 matchup against the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/CAR/carolina-panthers/\">Carolina Panthers</a> was seen as yet another step for the Patriots in their goal of challenging the Bills. The Panthers, however, made a statement of their own in Week 3 by defeating the Atlanta Falcons 30-0. This week's matchup is far from a sure thing for New England. With some NFL survivor pools already starting to thin down, its time to lock in Week 4 NFL survivor picks if you haven't already.</p><p>The latest Week 4 NFL odds show six games with a Week 4 NFL spread of 5.5 points or more, including Saints vs. Bills (-16.5), Browns vs. Lions (-8.5), Titans vs. Texans (-7), Chargers vs. Giants (+6.5), Packers vs. Cowboys (+7) and Bengals vs. Broncos (-7). Those are the games many NFL survivor players will be targeting, but among those favorites, which ones bring the most value in NFL survivor pools? </p><p><em>Before finalizing any Week 4 NFL survivor picks, </em><a href=\"https://www.sportsline.com/insiders/nfl-survivor-pool-week-4-2025-pick-from-advanced-computer-model/#ttag=09252025_agg_cbssports_picks_football_nfl_model_survivorpool\" target=\"_blank\"><em>see which team the red-hot SportsLine Projection Model just went all-in on</em></a><em>.</em></p><p>The model, which simulates every NFL game 10,000 times, is up well over $7,000 for $100 players on top-rated <a href=\"https://www.sportsline.com/nfl/picks/\" target=\"_blank\">NFL picks</a> since its inception. The model is on a sizzling 39-19 run on top-rated picks dating back to 2024.

The model can be used to crush the survivor pool format, which calls for picking one team to win each week but never using the same team twice. It survived through Week 1 by calling the Commanders over the Giants, Week 2 with the Ravens over the Browns, and Week 3 with Bills over Dolphins.</p><p>Now, it has turned its attention to the latest Week 4 NFL schedule and locked in its Week 4 survivor pool pick. <a href=\"https://www.sportsline.com/insiders/nfl-survivor-pool-week-4-2025-pick-from-advanced-computer-model/#ttag=09252025_agg_cbssports_picks_football_nfl_model_survivorpool\" target=\"_blank\">You can only see who the model is backing this week at SportsLine</a>. </p><p><em>New users can also target the </em><span><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/betting/news/draftkings-promo-code/\"><em>DraftKings promo code</em></a></span><em>, which offers </em><a href=\"https://martech.cbssports.com/bt/redirect/prod?b=draftkings&c=sport\" target=\"_blank\"><em>$200 in bonus bets instantly plus over $200 off NFL Sunday Ticket</em></a><em>:</em></p><h3>Top Week 4 NFL survivor pool predictions </h3><p>In Week 4 of the 2025 NFL season, the model is shying away from the Patriots as they take on the Carolina Panthers. The Patriots are 5.5-point and -243 money-line favorites, as one of the home favorites in the Week 4 lines, but are coming off a 21-14 loss to the Pittsburgh Steelers. The Panthers, meanwhile, got into the win column in a big way by thrashing the Falcons. Fading Carolina prior to that game was a popular NFL survivor strategy. </p><p>The model, however, projects this to be a one-score game, and only has New England winning 58% of the time, which is lower than many home teams this week. Drake Maye has had mixed results in three games and is still getting acclimated as the Patriots' starting quarterback. He has played in 16 games over the course of two seasons, and is completing 68% of his passes for 3,061 yards with 20 touchdowns and 12 interceptions.

That is an understatement, particularly if you play in 12-team leagues, particularly if you play on CBS. To be honest, it isn't much better this week. I am sure when the buys come along some of these handcuffs are going to get dropped and inevitably a starter is going to get hurt, and we will have a great option on the wire in most leagues. But until then, we're left hoping we drafted enough depth.</p><p>I put those qualifiers at the top because I know a lot of you play on several different sites, and a lot of you play in leagues smaller than 12 teams. If you are one of them, there is a 50/50 chance that this week's waiver wire looks fantastic to you. That is because <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/3176915/trey-benson/fantasy/\">Trey Benson</a> and/or <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/26697012/cam-skattebo/fantasy/\">Cam Skattebo</a> are available on your waiver and ranked inside my top 20 running backs in Week 4.</p><p>We'll start with Benson, who is my favorite this week and rest of the season. He just turned 23, and he still has fewer than 100 touches in the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://cbssports.com/nfl/\">NFL</a>, so it is important to remember his pedigree. The <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/ARI/arizona-cardinals/\">Cardinals</a> took him 66th overall last year after a college career that saw him average 6.1 yards per carry and score 24 touchdowns on 314 career rush attempts at Oregon and Florida State. He also averaged more than 11 yards per catch on 33 college receptions. That receiving work is what has gotten me excited this year.</p><p>Benson has a 12.5% target share on the season, good for third on the Arizona Cardinals. This is with <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/2071585/james-conner/fantasy/\">James Conner</a> playing 50% of the team's offensive snaps so far in 2025. Benson has 10 targets the past two games and <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/2180829/kyler-murray/fantasy/\">Kyler Murray</a> has thrown 23.8% of his passes to running backs this year. While <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/2964372/emari-demercado/fantasy/\">Emari Demercado</a> will factor in on passing downs on occasion, he only has three opportunities this year and he has produced zero yards and one terrible drop in Week 3. I am projecting Benson for a 60% rush share in Week 4 and a 13% target share. That should equal 20 opportunities for Benson, which is a fair projection rest of season as well. That makes Benson a must-start running back and a good buy-high candidate if he is not available on your waiver wire.</p>\n<p>Skattebo was very exciting in Week 3, turning 18 opportunities into 121 yards and a touchdown against the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/KC/kansas-city-chiefs/\">Chiefs</a>. I believe he will get a similar opportunity in Week 4, but Tyrone Tracy is not out for the year and would expect more of a committee once he is back. Of course, one of the big changes in New York is that <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/26694019/jaxson-dart/fantasy/\">Jaxson Dart</a> is taking over as starting QB. As a rookie QB with rushing upside I am not sure we can count on the same 26% target share they enjoyed the first three weeks with <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/1272242/russell-wilson/fantasy/\">Russell Wilson</a>. I am still adding Skattebo anywhere I can and starting him most places, but I am not quite as excited about him rest of season as I am about Benson.</p><p>Now let's get to the rest of the Week 4 RB Preview:</p>\n<h6>\n        Week 4 RB Preview\n    </h6>\n<p><span>\n    <a></a>\n    <div>\n                            <p>\n                    RB Preview\n                </p>\n                            <h6>\n                    Numbers to know\n                </h6>\n                    </div>\n            </span></p><ul><li><strong>77% </strong>-- <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/2184011/tony-pollard/fantasy/\">Tony Pollard</a> and <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/2965160/chase-brown/fantasy/\">Chase Brown</a> lead the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://cbssports.com/nfl/\">NFL</a> with a 77% rush share.

and ranks the highest in a bad crop of Week 4 running back waiver wire options. Week 3 he set season highs with 10 rush attempts and 11.4 PPR Fantasy points. Also, Isiah Pacheco made a couple of mistakes in the passing game so it is possible we see Hunt's workload increase, as it has each of the first three weeks. Surprisingly, the Ravens have given up the second-most Fantasy points to running backs this season. Less surprisingly, they have seen the most running back targets.\n            </p>\n            </div>\n</div>\n</td></tr><tr><td><div>\n    <div>\n                    <div>\n    <figure><img

work his way into the Raheem Mostert role and took a step in Week 3 with nine rushes for 38 yards and a touchdown. The Jets lead the NFL with 39 missed tackles so there could be some big opportunities for both running backs in this game. Gordon is a much better flex in non-PPR as we still expect De'Von Achane to dominate passing downs for the Dolphins.\n            </p>\n

last week and he is still a very good stash, but another name to know is Houston's Woody Marks. Marks has seen his number of touches and snap share increase each of the first three weeks and there is a chance at some point the 0-3 Texans choose to go with the young guy over veteran Nick Chubb. Marks came into the NFL with a very good receiving profile and has turned two catches into 46 yards this season. We hope he sees more work in that role moving forward.\n            </p>\n            </div>\n</div></div><p><span>\n    <a></a>\n    <div>\n                            <p>\n                    RB Preview\n                </p>\n                            <h6>\n                    DFS Plays\n                </h6>\n                    </div>\n            </span></p><div><div><div><p>Top DFS Play</p></div><div><p>\n                        Projections powered by\n                        <a href=\"https://www.sportsline.com/nfl/season-long-fantasy/?ttag=SL19_lk_cbssports_nfl_cbsprojections\" target=\"_blank\">\n                            <span></span>Sportsline\n                        </a>\n                    </p></div></div><div>\n    <div>\n                    <div>\n    <figure><img alt=\"team logo\" src=\"https://sports.cbsimg.net/fly/images/team-logos/422.svg\" /></figure>\n                                        </div>\n        <div>\n            <p><span>     \n                        NYG\n                    </span>\n                    <span>     \n                        N.Y.

Take advantage of that in cash games, no matter how chalky he might be. He's averaging 5.7 yards per touch and could see 20 touches in Week 4 assuming Tyrone Tracy is out. The Chargers have a good defense, but they just gave up 15.3 PPR points to J.K. Dobbins on 12 touches.\n            </p>\n            </div>\n</div></div><div><div><div><p>Contrarian DFS Play</p></div><div><p>\n                        Projections powered by\n

Still, I have liked what I have seen the few times the Raiders have blocked well for him. This is a get right spot at home, as a favorite, against the Bears. They are giving up 25.6 PPR FPPG to running backs this season and 5.3 yards per carry to opposing backs. If the Raiders can't get Jeanty free against this defense we have even bigger problems than it already feels like.\n            </p>\n            </div>\n</div></div><p><span>\n    <a></a>\n    <div>\n                            <p>\n                    RB Preview\n                </p>\n                            <h6>\n                    Heath's Projections\n                </h6>\n                    </div>\n            </span></p><p>My full set of Week 4 <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://cbssports.com/fantasy/football/\">Fantasy football</a> projections for every position are now available on SportsLine.

Gundy, a future Hall of Fame coach, was the second-longest tenured leader in the sport behind <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/teams/IOWA/iowa-hawkeyes/\">Iowa's</a> Kirk Ferentz. </p><p>The Cowboys coach was one of the most iconic of the 21st Century as he helped turn Oklahoma State into a nationally relevant program. He boasts nearly all of the best seasons as a coach in program history and elevated them into a force.</p><p>However, Oklahoma State fell back to the pack in recent years. Last season, Gundy posted a 3-9 record, the worst of his career. The Cowboys lost to <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/teams/TULSA/tulsa-golden-hurricane/\">Tulsa</a> on Friday for the first time at home since 1951, which followed up a historic 69-3 loss to <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/teams/OREG/oregon-ducks/\">Oregon</a>. </p><a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/news/oklahoma-state-coaching-candidates-gj-kinne-dana-holgorsen-among-options-on-hot-board-to-replace-mike-gundy/\" target=\"_blank\">\n        <div>\n            <div>\n                <p>Oklahoma State coaching candidates: GJ Kinne, Dana Holgorsen among options on hot board to replace Mike Gundy</p>\n                <p>\n                    Chris Hummer                </p>\n            </div>\n                            <div>\n    <figure><img alt=\"Oklahoma State coaching candidates: GJ Kinne, Dana Holgorsen among options on hot board to replace Mike Gundy\" src=\"https://sportshub.cbsistatic.com/i/r/2025/09/23/4a34844a-36da-410b-a1eb-1520d2f8ad0c/thumbnail/270x152/188aaa1fb897bb66bd8929806b8b1086/dana-holgorsen.png\" /></figure>\n                </div>\n                    </div>\n    </a>\n<p>Here are a few stats that really help contextualize the magnitude of Gundy's career with the Cowboys, from player to legendary coach. </p>\n<ul><li>Mike Gundy is the all-time Oklahoma State wins leader with 170. No one else has more than 62 wins. </li><li>Oklahoma State has 11 10-win seasons in program history. Gundy has been involved in 10 of them as a player or coach. </li></ul><p>Calling Gundy synonymous with the program is an understatement. The Midwest City, Oklahoma, native has been part of nearly every moment of relevance in the history of Oklahoma State. His tenure started with the Cowboys as a player from 1986-89, where he played with Thurman Thomas and Barry Sanders and won 20 games in two years under coach Pat Jones. </p><p>He spent a few years away from the program, but his return in 2001 as associate head coach under Les Miles helped spur the major turnaround. Gundy posted his first 10-win season in 2010 and went on to record eight more over the years. He hit 12 wins during a sensational 2011 season, the best of his tenure behind quarterback Brandon Weeden. </p><ul><li>Oklahoma State became a premier developer of wide receivers under Gundy, winning three Biletnikoff Awards (Justin Blackmon twice, James <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/teams/WASH/washington-huskies/\">Washington</a>). </li><li>The Cowboys won the Biletnikoff, Lou Groza, Ray Guy, Doak Walker, Unitas Golden Arm and <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/players/2083036/eddie-robinson/\">Eddie Robinson</a> Coach of the Year awards under Gundy. Prior to Gundy, Barry Sanders was the only Oklahoma State player to capture a major national award. </li><li>Gundy quarterbacks Mason Rudolph (No. 21) and Brandon Weeden (No. 32) posted two of the top 40 passing seasons in <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://cbssports.com/college-football/\">college football</a> history. </li><li>Between his time as a head coach and associate head coach under Les Miles, Oklahoma State produced eight first-round <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://cbssports.com/nfl/draft/\">NFL Draft</a> picks. There were only 13 total in the first 100 years of the program. </li></ul><p>Oklahoma State's offenses under Gundy were legendary. After spending his early career as a quarterbacks and wide receivers coach, Gundy became one of the greatest producers of both positions at the college level. Two Oklahoma State receivers won the Biletnikoff Award as the best receiver in the country, and Dez Bryant became a first-round NFL Draft pick. Quarterbacks Brandon Weeden and Mason Rudolph both became some of the most productive passers in college football history under Gundy's tutelage. </p>\n<p>Later in his career, the running backs started to step to the forefront. Running back Ollie Gordon II captured the Doak Walker Award after clearing 1,700 yards in 2023. Chuba Hubbard recorded more than 2,000 yards in 2019, joining Sanders as the only Cowboys to achieve the feat. </p><ul><li>Oklahoma State averaged more than eight wins per year across Gundy's tenure. </li><li>Gundy trails only Oklahoma's Bob Stoops for the most wins in Big 12 history. He passed <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/teams/KSTATE/kansas-state-wildcats/\">Kansas State's</a> Bill Snyder this season. </li><li>He was also the second-longest tenured coach in college football when he was let go, trailing only Iowa's Kirk Ferentz. </li></ul><p>Seventeen years ago, Gundy became a household name after his famous \"I'm a man, I'm 40\" rant. But while that soundbite made him a viral star, it also showed just how young he was at the time. Gundy was hired at Oklahoma State when he was only 37 and went on to have one of the greatest careers of any coach in Big 12 history. </p><p>Even now, Gundy just turned 58. That made him only the sixth-oldest coach in the Big 12. Before the season, Gundy told <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/news/i-get-it-mike-gundy-unfazed-by-pressure-as-grizzled-oklahoma-state-coach-stares-down-make-or-break-season/\">CBS Sports </a>that if Oklahoma State fired him, he would simply move on and take another job, if offered. </p>\n<p>\"It doesn't affect me just from a standpoint that I'm so far along in my career, I get it,\" Gundy said. \"If someone says, 'Hey, we need to change the coach at Oklahoma State,' then I go coach somewhere else.\" </p><ul><li>Gundy struggled to beat Oklahoma, posting a 4-15 (.211) record against the Sooners. His mark was nearly identical to the all-time mark (.199), despite leading the Cowboys to their greatest run in program history.</li><li>Because of his struggles against the Sooners in Big 12 play, Gundy ultimately won only one conference championship at Oklahoma State.  </li><li>However, Gundy beat Oklahoma 27-24 in 2023 in the final Bedlam in program history before the Sooners went to the SEC.  </li></ul><p>Gundy is a clear College Football Hall of Fame coach whenever he hangs up his visor for the final time. However, there were a few mountains that even he had trouble climbing during his time with the Pokes. Notably, the in-state rivalry against Oklahoma was a brutal affair for Gundy, and dragged on his legacy. </p><p>That said, he was able to at least beat the Sooners in the final Bedlam before Oklahoma left for the SEC, which bought them permanent bragging rights. However, without the Sooners in his way, there's no telling how many conference championships the Cowboys could have competed for over the years. </p>\n            </div>"

Head coach Dan Campbell and his squad made a strong statement on Monday Night Football in Week 3, suggesting everyone pump the brakes on that thought.</p><p>The Lions set a franchise record with 15 wins last season but made an early exit in the postseason, losing 45-31 to the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/WAS/washington-commanders/\">Washington Commanders</a> in the divisional round.

The Lions were held without a touchdown in that contest until the final minute of the fourth quarter, prompting many to think their run as an offensive juggernaut was over with Johnson gone.</p><p>However, Morton's offense has squashed that theory in a hurry. Detroit bounced back from the Week 1 loss by demolishing Johnson's Bears 52-21 and followed with a 38-30 triumph over <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/2239671/lamar-jackson/\">Lamar Jackson</a> and the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/BAL/baltimore-ravens/\">Baltimore Ravens</a> on MNF. The 90 combined points are the most the Lions have produced in a two-game span since 1962.</p><p>Monday's victory, in particular, has swayed a large amount of people's opinion on the Lions, who outgained the Ravens 426-318 in total yards and 224-85 on the ground. They allowed Jackson to throw for 288 yards and three scores but sacked him seven times, matching the highest amount of sacks the two-time NFL MVP has sustained in his career, as the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/PIT/pittsburgh-steelers/\">Pittsburgh Steelers</a> recorded seven against him in Week 13 of the 2021 season.</p><p>SportsLine's Inside the Lines team and its projection model certainly view Detroit differently after witnessing its performance against Baltimore.

    "body": "<div>\n        <p>The <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/wnba/teams/IND/indiana-fever/\">Indiana Fever</a> backcourt of <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/wnba/players/26677896/kelsey-mitchell/\">Kelsey Mitchell</a> and <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/wnba/players/2130788/odyssey-sims/\">Odyssey Sims</a> combined for 51 points in a 16-point win over the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/wnba/teams/LVA/las-vegas-aces/\">Las Vegas Aces</a> in Game 1 of the WNBA semifinals on Sunday. For her part, Sims tallied 17 points, three assists and three steals to give the Fever a 1-0 series lead. Mitchell and Sims are hoping to lead Indiana to their first WNBA Finals since 2015. Despite Game 1, the Aces still have the better odds to advance to the WNBA Finals.</p><p>However, Sims knows all about being an underdog. </p><p>Odyssey refers to a long and eventful or adventurous journey, and often implies several challenges or complications. Odyssey Sims is an 11-year WNBA veteran and journeywoman. Indiana marks her 11th move across seven different franchises. </p><p>\"When a team waives me, when I get picked up, I get waived again. It's like I'm always just at the same mindset of just staying ready, and it's paid off,\" Sims told CBS Sports on Monday. \"I never let anything faze me ... I've been taking advantage of the opportunities that have come across me.\" </p><p>The eventful journey for Sims now has her competing on an underdog Fever team. She was retained on a hardship contract after Indiana announced <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/wnba/players/1594733/sydney-colson/\">Sydney Colson</a> and <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/wnba/players/26678028/aari-mcdonald/\">Aari McDonald</a> suffered season-ending injuries. Less than a month later, the Fever announced 2024 Rookie of the Year <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/wnba/players/29362921/caitlin-clark/\">Caitlin Clark</a> would also miss the remainder of the season. Indiana retained Sims, who started the season with the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/wnba/teams/LAS/los-angeles-sparks/\">Los Angeles Sparks</a>, for the rest of the season and playoff run.</p>\n<p>\"I will continue to say my heart goes out to each and every one of them that is injured. Those are my girls. Love them. Obviously, if they weren't injured, then I probably wouldn't be here,\" Sims said. </p><p>It's the harsh reality of sports, but Indiana is making the most of it. The five injured players have been coined the Bench Mob. What the group can't offer on the court, they give as a hype squad of sorts. <span><a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/wnba/news/caitlin-clark-mocks-latest-wnba-fine-injured-fever-star-docked-for-criticizing-officials/\" target=\"_blank\">Their antics have even led to a $200 fine for Clark</a></span>. </p><p>\"[On] this team is doesn't matter if you're playing, if you're not, if you're one of the coaches, if you're a head coach, if you're from ownership. Everyone, collectively, we're in it together,\" Sims told CBS Sports. </p>\n<p>To that end, Indiana's Bench Mob is somewhat of a scout team. Sims says the players are very vocal -- all but McDonald, according to Sims, who has a more lowkey vibe. The injured teammates liberally share their observations throughout games, pointing out little things that can give their active teammates a competitive advantage. </p><p>The constant communication Sims described is a concrete example of the team's motto: We over me.  </p><p>\"That's what we live by, and that's what we've shown. We don't really care about who is the star for the game. We don't care about who has the most points or who has this accolade after a game. At the end of the day, we want to win,\" she said. </p>\n<p>The Fever's playoff success undoubtedly runs through Mitchell, and Sims plays a critical role in opening the floor for her and frontcourt players like <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/wnba/players/29101293/aliyah-boston/\">Aliyah Boston</a> and <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/wnba/players/2130759/natasha-howard/\">Natasha Howard</a>. </p><p>\"They brought me here, and they wanted me to continue to do that. I'm really good, and I get downhill, obviously I command a lot of attention when I'm getting to the paint, so that my teammates could just be able to catch and shoot,\" Sims said. </p><p>Additionally, she helps push the pace Fever head coach Stephanie White wants from her team. </p>\n<p>\"She reminds me 24/7 that when my pace is at a high level, then my team, we play at a higher level,\" Sims said. \"The ball moves a little bit quicker. We're able to get the ball from side to side ... she just tells me, like my pace sets the tone for that possession.\"</p><p>Indiana finished the regular season top five in pace and leads pace among the eight playoff teams. Through four playoff games, Sims is averaging 12 points and 29.5 minutes per game; both are her highest averages since the 2020 season with Minnesota. </p><p>The oddsmakers still have the Fever as an underdog (Indiana has +200 odds to win the series at <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/betting/news/draftkings-promo-code/\">DraftKings</a> despite the Game 1 win), but that's far from how players see themselves. White praises her team for its resilience daily, while also reminding her roster they haven't come this far to just come this far. </p>\n<p>\"We're not satisfied with just being in the semifinals. We're not just satisfied with being in the playoffs,\" Sims said. \"Every game we play is going to be hard and we know that... I just feel like we're in a great place.\" </p><p>For the Fever to beat the odds, they'll have to get through an Aces team who rode a 16-game winning streak into the postseason, and has overcome their own adversity. Stealing a game on the road was a good start before the series moves to Gainbridge Fieldhouse for Games 3 and 4.</p><p>\"Vegas is a good team, a championship team. We know what they can do. We know they're going to make a testament,\" Sims said. \"So we're expecting that Game 2 will be harder, but we're ready for it. We're ready for anything that we could get thrown to us.\" </p>\n<p>Nobody know that better than Odyssey. Although she claims to always botch the story behind her name, she does feel her WNBA career has been quite the adventure. </p><p>\"I could have gave up last year,\" the 33-year-old said. \"I could have gave up after being waived by L.A. this year, but I said, 'No, I'm not done yet,' and look where I am? So, like I said, Everything happens for a reason, and I'm happy to be here.\"</p>\n            </div>"

We don't try to accurately forecast who is going to cover or what props are going to go over/under. Over two decades, we have reverse engineered oddsmakers' models which has resulted in 85-90% of our projections being virtually identical to the oddsmaker's lines. When <span><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/betting/news/best-betting-apps/\">top sportsbooks</a></span>' lines differ from ours, we know they are likely manipulating a line to generate monetary value or minimize risk. And more often than not, betting a line that is statistically sound is the better side.</p><p><em><strong>In other words Inside the Lines provides 'honest' odds that the books would offer if they were non profit sportsbooks looking to balance $$$ evenly on both sides.</strong></em></p><p>In our world there is no such thing as a \"lock\". If you imagine a bell curve of outcomes, most cappers look to pick one tail or the other. We look to see if the median is off by 10% or more, identify the reasons why the line is off and if we like our reasons more than the oddsmakers' we identify it as good value. We then look across sportsbooks to see if one is especially off (maybe 15%) and try to jump on that line before it moves.</p><p><strong><em>The approach allows you to go from breaking even on standard -110 bets at 52.4% to turning a +24 unit profit if you can average a 5% better price.</em></strong></p><p>Our best bets are ones where:</p><p>1) <strong>Best Projection: </strong>Our SportsLine Model's projection shows clear value versus the line <em>and </em>we love certain statistical trends, X's and O's and subjective supporting data that supports our side but isn't directly factored into the model. For example, say we love a running back to go Over 14.5 carries and his backup is projected for 5.5 carries, but the backup is questionable and there's a chance he can be ruled out, which surely will change our projection to 16.5 (third-stringer gets 3.5) and the line would likely go from 12.5 to 15.5. If we have value on a side and the only unknown factors that will change are in our favor, we'll consider it our \"Best Projection.\"</p><p>AND</p><p>2) <strong>Best Price: </strong>There is an outlier best price that we should take advantage of before it steams in \"our direction.\" In most of these cases, the best-priced book is using \"standard odds making logic\" to set the line, but our team has identified a unique situation where standard odds rules don't apply. For example, maybe a player is -110 to throw an interception, but in his last three seasons he has averaged just 0.4 interceptions on the road compared to 0.7 at home because the team plays on a fast track at home and averages 5+ more pass attempts at home.</p><p><em><strong>Step 1 provides greater accuracy and Step 2, especially when combined with a nice Profit Boost or Promotion, significantly lowers the bar for being profitable ... which is why we like to feature our best line <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/betting/news/best-betting-apps/\">sportsbooks</a> offers. </strong></em></p>\n            </div>"

Houston apparently decided they wanted to go in a different direction with their secondary after the rough start to the year, and Gardner-Johnson received his release.</p><p>Without Gardner-Johnson, the Houston secondary will rely on nickel <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/2807111/jalen-pitre/\">Jalen Pitre</a> and backup safety <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/2130954/m-j-stewart/\">M.J.

Messick has been terrific since being called up last month, pitching to a 2.03 ERA with 31 strikeouts and only five walks in six starts. Righty <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/players/2829919/keider-montero/\">Keider Montero</a> lines up to pitch Thursday for the Tigers, though they have paired him with an opener at times this season, hence the TBA. </p><p>Here is everything you need to know going into this week's series at Progressive Field. </p>\n<h2> How they got here </h2><p>Last year, the Tigers started poorly and surged late en route to their first postseason berth in a decade. This year, they've done the opposite. They started extremely well, well enough to be in the \"best team in baseball\" conversation, but they've crashed hard the last few weeks. Detroit peaked at 25 games over .500 on July 8. </p><ul><li><strong>Through July 8:</strong> 59-34 with a plus-112 run differential</li><li><strong>Since July 8:</strong> 26-37 with a minus-39 run differential</li></ul><p>It's been even worse lately. The Tigers have lost six straight games, nine of their last 10 games, and 18 of their last 25 games. They were 10 games up as recently as Sept. 3. That's a nine-game swing in the standings in 19 days. Blame the offense. Detroit has averaged only 2.5 runs scored per game in their last 10 games. The bullpen has been combustible too. </p><p>The Guardians were so far out of the race that they traded away <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/players/2507333/shane-bieber/\">Shane Bieber</a> at the deadline. They bottomed out at eight games under .500 on July 6. Here's the before and after: </p><ul><li><strong>Through July 6:</strong> 40-48 with a minus-59 run differential</li><li><strong>Since July 6:</strong> 44-24 with a plus-50 run differential</li></ul><p>Cleveland had won 10 straight games prior to Sunday's loss. They've won 15 of their last 17 games and 20 of their last 26 games. The Guardians do it with run prevention. They have allowed only 65 runs in their last 26 games, or 2.5 per game, and they've done it even with all-world closer <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/players/3107591/emmanuel-clase/\">Emmanuel Clase</a> <span><a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/news/guardians-pitchers-emmanuel-clase-and-luis-ortiz-remain-on-paid-leave-amid-mlbs-gambling-investigations/\" target=\"_blank\">on administrative leave amid a league investigation into gambling</a></span>. </p><p>Needless to say, these are two teams headed in opposite directions. The Tigers were one of the very best teams in baseball three months into the season, and have been one of the worst since. The Guardians were spinning their wheels early on and have been almost unbeatable over the last four weeks. If you believe in momentum, it is definitely on Cleveland's side. </p><h2> Cleveland needs one win to clinch the tiebreaker </h2><p>This will be the fourth and final regular-season series between these two division rivals and the Guardians lead the head-to-head series 6-4. Here's how things have played out between these two teams: </p><table><tbody><tr><th>Dates</th><th>Location</th><th>Outcome</th></tr><tr><td><p>May 22-25 \t\t\t\t</p></td><td><p>Comerica Park \t\t\t\t</p></td><td><p>Guardians win 3 of 4 \t\t\t\t</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>July 4-6 \t\t\t\t</p></td><td><p>Progressive Field \t\t\t\t</p></td><td><p>Tigers sweep 3-0 \t\t\t\t</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Sept. 16-18 \t\t\t\t</p></td><td><p>Comerica Park \t\t\t\t</p></td><td><p>Guardians sweep 3-0 \t\t\t\t</p></td></tr></tbody></table><p>That sweep in Detroit last week made an AL Central comeback begin to feel possible. It closed the gap in the standings from 5 ½ games to 2 ½ games with the head-to-head series remaining this week. It also moved the Guardians on the brink of clinching the season series, and thus the tiebreaker. One win this series gives Cleveland the tiebreaker. </p><p>Since we're here, we might as well lay out all the possible outcomes of this week's series: </p><table><tbody><tr><th>Result</th><th>AL Central situation</th></tr><tr><td><p>Tigers sweep 3-0 \t\t\t\t</p></td><td><p>Tigers clinch AL Central \t\t\t\t</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Tigers win 2 of 3 \t\t\t\t</p></td><td><p>Tigers have 2-game lead, Guardians have tiebreaker \t\t\t\t</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Guardians win 2 of 3 \t\t\t\t</p></td><td><p>Tie atop AL Central, Guardians have tiebreaker \t\t\t\t</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Guardians sweep 3-0 \t\t\t\t</p></td><td><p>Guardians have 2-game lead plus the tiebreaker \t\t\t\t</p></td></tr></tbody></table><p><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://cbssports.com/mlb/\">MLB</a> and the MLBPA agreed to do away with Game 163 tiebreakers a few years ago. Now all ties are broken mathematically, and if Cleveland wins one game this week, they hold the tiebreaker. Given how close this race is and how few games are remaining in the season, the tiebreaker is essentially like picking up an extra game in the standings. </p><p>The Tigers need to sweep the series to clinch the tiebreaker, but if they do, they will win clinch the AL Central outright. The tiebreaker only applies to Cleveland at this point. </p><h2> It's not just the AL Central that's on the line </h2><p>It is not guaranteed that the AL Central runner-up will be a wild card team. The AL Central title isn't the only thing on the line this week. It could be a postseason berth period. Here are the AL wild card standings: </p><ol><li><strong>New York Yankees:</strong> 88-68 (+4 GB)</li><li><strong><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/teams/BOS/boston-red-sox/\">Boston Red Sox</a>:</strong> 85-71 (+1 GB)</li><li><strong>Cleveland Guardians:</strong> 84-72<br /> ----------------------------------------------</li><li><strong><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/teams/HOU/houston-astros/\">Houston Astros</a>:</strong> 84-72</li><li><strong><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/teams/TEX/texas-rangers/\">Texas Rangers</a>:</strong> 79-77 (5 GB)</li></ol><p>The Guardians won the season series over the Astros and thus have the tiebreaker, so technically they're in and the Astros are out right now. The larger point is a good week by the Astros, who go on the road to play the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/teams/ATH/athletics/\">(Sacramento) Athletics</a> and <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/teams/LAA/los-angeles-angels/\">Los Angeles Angels</a>, could move them into a wild card spot and bump the AL Central runner-up out of the postseason bracket entirely. </p><p>The Tigers and Guardians will play each other for the AL Central this week, first and foremost. The secondary battle is staying in a wild card spot as a fallback. These two teams will be scoreboard watching the Astros (and Red Sox) in particular. </p>\n<h2> What's next for each team </h2><p>On paper, the remaining schedule favors the Guardians. After the Tigers leave town, they'll host the Rangers this weekend, and it's possible (if not likely) Texas will be eliminated from postseason contention by then and just playing out the string. Any combination of Guardians wins and Rangers losses totaling two eliminates Texas. Chances are the Rangers will have one foot in the batter's box and one foot on the plane for their offseason vacation this weekend. </p><p>The Tigers, meanwhile, will head to Boston after leaving Cleveland, and finish the regular season with three games against a Red Sox team that could be playing for their own postseason life. On one hand, that would give the Tigers the opportunity to take matters into their own hands in the wild card race. On the other hand, that doesn't figure to be an easy series. You'd rather play an eliminated team looking forward to the winter than a contender, at least in theory. </p><h2> Prediction </h2><p>The Tigers are reeling and the Guardians are cruising, though I do have a hard time betting against Skubal. I'll say the Tigers win Tuesday but lose Wednesday and Thursday, leaving us with a tie atop the AL Central heading into the final weekend. Perhaps that's a wish more than a prediction. A division race going down to the wire would be quality television. </p>\n            </div>"

    "body": "<div>\n        <p><em>Welcome to Snyder's Soapbox! Here, I pontificate about matters related to Major League Baseball on a weekly basis. Some of the topics will be pressing matters, some might seem insignificant in the grand scheme of things, and most will be somewhere in between. The good thing about this website is that it's free, and you are allowed to click away. If you stay, you'll get smarter, though. That's a money-back guarantee. Let's get to it.</em></p><p>One of the best features of the marathon that is the Major League Baseball season is that it weeds out small-sample flukes and the best teams eventually rise to the top. I never had a problem with the playoffs being small-sample series as long as we only had the best teams in the playoffs.</p><p>Now? </p><p>Man, I just don't know. </p><p>I understand what MLB is doing in terms of keeping the most teams possible involved in the playoff races as long as possible. I understand why the Wild Card Series went to three games and, of course, I understand why it's more exciting to have an unpredictable tournament where it seems like anything is possible. </p><p>The problem, though, is we have a bunch of teams still involved in the playoff race that aren't playoff-caliber teams.</p>\n<p>You know what happens then? You end up with the 84-win <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/teams/ARI/arizona-diamondbacks/\">Diamondbacks</a> in the World Series. With all due to respect to my friends and readers in Arizona, we don't need that happening anymore. Getting through a grueling 162-game schedule with 84 wins is a perfectly adequate accomplishment, but not one that merits a reward of a trip to the Fall Classic. </p><p>And we have plenty of candidates for that this season. </p><p>The <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/teams/NYM/new-york-mets/\">Mets</a> are 80-76. They've gone 35-52 since June 12. They've gone 18-32 since July 27. Is that a playoff team? </p><p>The <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/teams/CIN/cincinnati-reds/\">Reds</a> are also 80-76 and hold the tiebreaker. They might make the postseason instead of the Mets. They haven't been more than seven games over .500 all season and are just 30-29 since the All-Star break. They are 11-8 in September but were 12-15 in August. Basically, they've just been mediocre all season. </p>\n<a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/news/mlb-playoff-picture-standings-2025/\" target=\"_blank\">\n        <div>\n            <div>\n                <p>2025 MLB playoff picture: Baseball standings, tiebreakers, clinch scenarios with Yankees' magic number at one</p>\n                <p>\n                    Kate Feldman                </p>\n            </div>\n                            <div>\n    <figure><img alt=\"2025 MLB playoff picture: Baseball standings, tiebreakers, clinch scenarios with Yankees' magic number at one\" src=\"https://sportshub.cbsistatic.com/i/r/2025/09/23/37d7e39a-d5ff-484a-9581-6637743c394f/thumbnail/270x152/27f5ab186b0320a11083fbb04bb1494a/aaron-judge-getty-21.png\" /></figure>\n                </div>\n                    </div>\n    </a>\n<p>Of course, behind the Reds we've got the Diamondbacks, who were sellers at the trade deadline. Then come the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/teams/SF/san-francisco-giants/\">Giants</a>, who are three games under .500 and have gone 36-51 since June 13. The 76-80 <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/teams/MIA/miami-marlins/\">Marlins</a> are still alive and staging a furious rally right now -- and it would be a disaster if they made a World Series run. </p><p>Perhaps the biggest indictment of the number of playoff spots is the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/teams/STL/st-louis-cardinals/\">Cardinals</a>. They went 14-14 in June, 8-16 in July, 13-15 in August and are 9-10 in September. They are 26-34 in the second half. They are still technically alive, only four games out of a playoff spot. </p><p>Man, what are we doing? These teams should have been eliminated a week or two ago. </p>\n<p>Over on the American League side, at least the teams in contention for the final berth are trending toward having better final records, but it still wouldn't have been a problem with only four or five playoff teams. </p><p>Let's say we went back to the three-division-winners-plus-one-wild-card format. The <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/teams/NYY/new-york-yankees/\">Yankees</a> would have a three-game lead over the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/teams/BOS/boston-red-sox/\">Red Sox</a> for the wild card. The <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/teams/CLE/cleveland-guardians/\">Guardians</a> would still be trailing the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/teams/DET/detroit-tigers/\">Tigers</a> by one game in the AL Central with three head-to-head games coming in Cleveland starting Tuesday, only this time the loser of this race likely falls out of the playoffs instead of having a safety net. The <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/teams/SEA/seattle-mariners/\">Mariners</a> have a three-game lead over the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/teams/HOU/houston-astros/\">Astros</a> and probably clinch the AL West, but the Astros would still have had a shot this week. If they can't pull it off, there's always the wild card.</p><p>Instead, it's possible either the Tigers or Astros keep losing and still limp their way into a playoff spot after playing awful baseball for three months. </p>\n<p>To reiterate, I understand what MLB is doing. More playoffs teams in a sport that is dominated by regional ratings these days means more fan bases stay involved in the season until the end. Playoff games are excellent theater for casual, general sports fans who don't care to watch baseball every single day for six months. </p><p>I just wonder about diminishing returns. I'm not suggesting we go back to just the league winners facing off in the World Series or even just having two League Championship Series before the World Series. I just think at some point there are too many playoff teams and it renders the regular season less meaningful than it should be in a sport with a marathon regular season. </p><p>The 2025 National League wild card race is a perfect example of this. </p>\n            </div>"

Brees did mention Green Bay's <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/2239997/jordan-love/\">Jordan Love</a>, Dallas' <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/1824864/dak-prescott/\">Dak Prescott</a> and Buffalo's <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/2181054/josh-allen/\">Josh Allen</a>. </p><p>\"Hey, I respect Philly,\" <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zk6S_uVETJU\" target=\"_blank\">Brees said</a> on \"First Take.\" \"I respect Philly. They are winning games. They're finding way to win games. I can't stand to watch that offense. It's the most boring offense.\"</p><p>While it might be boring, the Eagles' offense is nonetheless eighth in the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://cbssports.com/nfl/\">NFL</a> in points scored through three weeks. They are currently No. 1 in the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://cbssports.com/nfl/\">NFL</a> in red zone efficiency and eighth on third down. </p>\n<p>A big reason for Philadelphia's success in the red zone and on possession downs is their \"Tush Push\" play that is virtually unstoppable. But while the play is highly successful, it is also highly controversial and surely one of the main reasons why Brees isn't a fan of Philadelphia's offense. </p><a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/news/eagles-offensive-linemen-sound-off-on-potential-death-of-tush-push-we-might-call-it-18-times-this-week/\" target=\"_blank\">\n        <div>\n            <div>\n                <p>Eagles offensive linemen sound off on potential death of Tush Push: 'We might call it 18 times this week'</p>\n                <p>\n                    Jeff Kerr                </p>\n            </div>\n                            <div>\n    <figure><img alt=\"Eagles offensive linemen sound off on potential death of Tush Push: 'We might call it 18 times this week'\" src=\"https://sportshub.cbsistatic.com/i/r/2025/09/20/403c9c56-6f42-42fb-ba5f-d3b63d4626c0/thumbnail/270x152/d71a6605f182a9972309b2f076f53ec8/tush-push-getty.png\" /></figure>\n                </div>\n                    </div>\n    </a>\n<p>Big plays have been one of the biggest things the Eagles' offense has lacked through three weeks. But while they haven't been able to stretch the field, the Eagles have made up for that by playing efficient ball while not beating themselves. Hurts, for example, is completing 71.4% of his passes and has yet to throw an interception. He has seven total touchdowns this season that includes a league-high four on the ground. </p>\n<p>While he may not like it, Brees did acknowledge that the Eagles' offense is capable of helping Philadelphia defend its <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://cbssports.com/nfl/superbowl/\">Super Bowl</a> title. </p>\n<p>\"Absolutely,\" he said. \"That's the toughest division in football.
