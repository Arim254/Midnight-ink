Ferrario turned 47 on Monday, just days before his death. The Wisconsin football program confirmed Ferrario's death Thursday. </p><p>Ferrario, a native of Scranton, Pennsylvania, shined with the Badgers from 1997-2000. He started every single game of his career and in the process became just the third player in Big Ten history to reach 50 starts. The 50 consecutive starts remains the second-longest streak by a Wisconsin player.</p>\n<p>Ferrario was a model of consistency throughout his college career and a terrific blocker. He helped pave the way for running back Ron Dayne on his way to the Heisman Trophy and was a stalwart in the trenches for Badgers teams that won two Big Ten titles and the 1999 and 2000 Rose Bowls. In turn, he earned a first-team All-Big Ten honor in 1999 and second-team nod in 2000.</p><p>The Green Bay Packers selected Ferrario in the fourth round of the 2001 <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://cbssports.com/nfl/draft/\">NFL Draft</a>, keeping him in the state of Wisconsin for the start of his professional career. Ferrario played in all 16 games during the 2002 season before the Packers waived him the following year. He signed with and was released by both Washington and Carolina and did not see game action for either franchise before leaving the league in 2005.</p>\n<p>Ferrario moved back to Wisconsin at the end of his <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://cbssports.com/nfl/\">NFL</a> career and embarked on <a href=\"https://uwbadgers.com/news/2009/5/20/Where_are_they_now_Bill_Ferrario.aspx\" target=\"_blank\">a career in the medical sales industry</a>.

Washington Spirit could clinch a 2025 playoff spot when they host Houston Dash at Audi Field on Sunday (12 p.m. ET on  <a href=\"https://www.paramountplus.com/?cbscidmt=sports&ftag=PPM-03-10aff4b\" target=\"_blank\">Paramount+</a>).

Kansas City Current (--)</h2><p>The Kansas City Current have been the best team the entire 2025 NWSL regular season, and they confirmed all the clout when they etched their names into the 2025 NWSL Shield. The fastest team to ever secure the shield, and they've got five weeks in front of them to retool if they need to or want to. </p>\n<h2>2. Washington Spirit (--)</h2><p>The Spirit will be motivated to clinch their playoff spot at home after being runners-up in the shield race. The regular season might be winding down, but forward Trinity Rodman and midfielder Croix Bethune are heating up at the right time, and the Spirit stay a force to be reckoned with.</p><h2>3. Gotham FC (+2)</h2><p>As Rose Lavelle rises, so does Gotham FC. Sometimes figuring out how not to lose a game is just as important as securing a win during the postseason race, and the coaching staff is also competing to flex how deep the roster is.</p><h2>4. Portland Thorns FC (-1)</h2><p>There's no streakier team than the Thorns among the top four of my rankings and the league table. One stretch of the match, they look like they have the answers, and the next, they're not executing. The only thing keeping them this high is the fact that so many other teams are facing similar questions.</p>\n<h2>5. Seattle Reign FC (-1)</h2><p>Literally, somebody not named Jess Fishlock, please score for the Seattle Reign. One goal in four games isn't just a trend; it's become consistent stagnation at this point, and it's not the kind of form you want when staying in the playoff mix.</p><h2>6. Orlando Pride (--)</h2><p>The former NWSL Shield winners are stumbling in the playoff race, and in my power rankings. There's enough there at the end of game stats to show the Pride are clinging to the postseason race, but they might have to shake up the lineups to get things going again.</p><h2>7. San Diego Wave (--)</h2><p>There's just not the same creative spark from San Diego that we saw during the first half of the season. If forward Delphine Cascarino remains on the injury report, there might not be enough to keep them climbing the power rankings. </p>\n<h2>8. Utah Royals (+3)</h2><p>There's the Utah Royals we all thought would come to life in 2025. In almost a mirror image of last season, Utah is stringing together performances and playing better than its league table ranking. But just like last year, they're running out of time to make some club history.</p><h2>9. Houston Dash (+1)</h2><p>Dash showed they won't stay down for long. Despite their unbeaten streak being snapped, they bounced right back into form. Yazmeen Ryan is back to scoring goals, and they're still part of a postseason convo that was previously slipping away from them.</p><h2>10. North Carolina Courage (+2)</h2><p>The Courage are bringing plenty of nothing-to-lose energy into their matches, and it's paying off in results and the playoff picture. Defenders Maycee Bell and Kaleigh Kurtz are making things difficult for the attacking opposition, and the play is building up on the pitch.</p>\n<h2>11. Racing Louisville FC (-3)</h2><p>You hate to see it. Racing are struggling to differentiate itself not only from other teams in the playoff push, but from their repeatedly underachieving seasons of the past. They're showing signs of life but could use a definitive, complete performance asap.</p><h2>12. Chicago Stars FC (-3)</h2><p>It was an incredible run until reality started to settle in. The group is on a new streak of no wins that don't feel as great as their previous run out of the summer break. They're in the corner with the regular season timeline closing in on them.</p><h2>13. Angel City FC (+1)</h2><p>Nothing like going toe-to-toe with top teams to get some confidence back. But it's a little bit telling that some of the vibes are lost despite the efforts. </p>\n<h2>14. Bay FC (-1)</h2><p>There's nothing wrong with trying some stuff when it looks and feels like the season has all but slipped away from you. Defender Brooklyn Courtnal got her first start since being traded to Bay, and forward Racheal Kundenanji, off the bench, scored an equalizer.</p>\n            </div>"

Chicago is eighth in the MLB (4.85), and New York is in the 10th spot (4.75). Over the first two games in this series, they've scored at least 13 runs in both contests.

Day 1 on Friday will consist of four alternate shot (foursome) matches in the morning and then four better ball (fourball) matches in the afternoon. As the hosts, the United States was allowed to select when the sessions of the first two days of the event are played, so team captain Keegan Bradley clearly feels confident that this cadence will put the Americans in the best chance to grab an early lead, and past results certainly indicate that.</p><p>The U.S. has utilized this strategy in five straight Ryder Cup events, posting a 12-4 overall record over those sessions. The U.S. went 6-2 in foursome matches when it last hosted in 2021, while the Europeans also know this strategy often works in favor of the host, as they went 7-1 across the foursome matches when they hosted in 2023.</p><p><em>For the 2025 Ryder Cup, you can use the latest <span><a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/betting/news/fanduel-promo-code/\" target=\"_blank\">FanDuel promo code</a></span> at </em><a href=\"https://martech.cbssports.com/bt/redirect/prod?b=fanduel&c=sport\" target=\"_blank\"><em>FanDuel to get $300 in bonus bets instantly.</em></a><em> </em></p><p>One can also look at the composition of the respective teams to see why McClure favors the U.S. to start off with a lead.

The entire-12 man U.S. team ranks in the top 25, while three Europeans are outside the top 25, including Rahm at No. 73. Additionally, Bethpage Black hasn't been too kind to many of the Europeans who played it before when the course hosted the 2019 PGA Championship. Five of the seven Team Europe members who competed finished outside the top 25, while U.S. member, Patrick Cantlay (t3) nearly won the major and fellow member, Xander Schauffele, had a solid 16th-place finish. <a href=\"https://www.sportsline.com/insiders/2025-ryder-cup-odds-picks-proven-golf-model-reveals-best-bets-surprising-predictions-for-bethpage-black/#ttag=09232025_agg_cbssports_picks_golf_pgatour_model_RyderCup\" target=\"_blank\">See who else to pick here</a>.</p><h2>How to make 2025 Ryder Cup picks</h2><p>McClure is also targeting three other Ryder Cup best bets, including two more plus-money golf picks and the overall winner.

Despite the loss, Francisco Alvarez homered for the second straight game for the Mets, who have a top-10 offense in baseball at 4.75 runs per game. Juan Soto also hit his 43rd home run of the season for New York. The Cubs are eighth in scoring at 4.85 runs per contest. Michael Busch hit his 31st home run of the season for Chicago on Wednesday. The Mets are starting rookie Nolan McLean, who has a 1.27 ERA over his first seven starts, but the 24-year-old allowed a career-high three runs (although only one earned) against the Nationals on Saturday. The Cubs are starting Shota Imanaga, who has a 4.91 ERA over four September starts. The model projects the Over to hit in 65.6% of simulations in a 7:40 p.m. ET start. </p><h2>Blue Jays vs. Red Sox Over 8 total runs (-112)</h2><p>Between the Blue Jays' recent struggles and the Yankees' surge, Toronto and New York are tied for first place in the American League East entering Thursday. While the Yankees have had an easier week with the last-place White Sox, the Blue Jays and Red Sox are two teams likely to make the postseason, and they've been playing high-stakes baseball throughout the week. Both teams have top-10 offenses in baseball, with the Red Sox ranking fifth at 4.91 runs per game and the Blue Jays seventh at 4.87 runs per contest. Toronto is utilizing a bullpen game on Thursday, while Boston is starting Brayan Bello, who has a 5.85 ERA in four September starts. The model projects the Over to hit in 61.5% of simulations.</p><h2>Cardinals (+1.5) vs. Seahawks (-110)</h2><p>Seattle has dominated this matchup, winning all six head-to-head contests over the last three years, but with Geno Smith gone and Sam Darnold taking over as QB1, this isn't the same Seahawks team as the last few seasons. Although Seattle is fifth in scoring at 29.3 points per game, Arizona has the No. 5 scoring defense (17 ppg allowed). The Cardinals are 1-0 at home this season, defeating the Panthers, 27-22, behind 220 passing yards from Kyler Murray and two forced turnovers. Seattle is third in the NFL in rushing rate, while the Cardinals rank fourth in rushing yards allowed per game, as Arizona could take away Seattle's biggest strength.

    "body": "<div>\n        <p>The biggest names in golf come to Long Island, New York, this week for the 2025 Ryder Cup, which pits Team USA vs. Team Europe at Bethpage Black, often considered one of the toughest courses in the world. Each team has 12 golfers competing in a match play format, rather than traditional stroke play competition. Team USA includes stars such as Scottie Scheffler,  Bryson DeChambeau and Xander Schauffele, while Team Europe is highlighted by golfers such as Rory McIlroy, Jon Rahm and Tommy Fleetwood. Team USA is the -150 favorite, while Team Europe is a +155 underdog, with a tie priced at +1300 in the latest 2025 Ryder Cup odds. The first match of the 2025 Ryder Cup tees off on Friday at 7:10 a.m. ET when Bryson DeChambeau and Justin Thomas take on Jon Rahm and Tyrrell Hatton. </p><p>Along with betting on which team wins, there are plenty of 2025 Ryder Cup props available as <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/betting/\" target=\"_blank\">online sports betting</a> options, including ample longshots that could give sports bettors a significant payday. One of the model's top 2025 Ryder Cup longshot picks is McIlroy, the 2025 Masters champion, as the top point scorer for Team Europe at +300 odds. McIlroy will be competing in his eighth Ryder Cup, and he was the top point scorer for all golfers at the 2023 Ryder Cup, which Team Europe won.</p><p>Now that the 2025 Ryder Cup is finally here, SportsLine simulated the tournament 10,000 times, and revealed its longshot <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/betting/\">betting</a> picks. The model can help you find value to add to your 2025 Ryder Cup picks at various sportsbooks. They can also help new users take advantage of <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/betting/news/sportsbook-promos/\" target=\"_blank\">sportsbook promos</a> like the latest BetMGM bonus code, where new users <a href=\"https://martech.cbssports.com/bt/redirect/prod?b=betmgm&c=sport\" target=\"_blank\">receive up to $1,500 in bonus bets if your first bet loses</a>: </p><h2>Rory McIlroy top Team Europe point scorer (+300)</h2><p>McIlroy went 4-1 in his matches at the 2023 Ryder Cup, as the only golfer for either team to score four points. He's finished with a winning record in match play in four of his seven career Ryder Cups and has earned at least 50% of his possible points in five of seven appearances. McIlroy has competed at Bethpage Black in four PGA Tour events over his career, finishing in the top 10 twice. </p><p>McIlroy is no stranger to facing harsher environments and pressure throughout his career, and with Bethpage Black on Long Island notoriously known for bringing one of the rowdier crowds in golf, the 36-year-old may use any hecklers to lock in even more. McIlroy claimed his first green jacket this year to complete the career Grand Slam, and he had three top-10 finishes over his final five PGA Tour events this season.</p><p>McIlroy has spoken in the past about how much the Ryder Cup means to him, and you can expect him to be near his best this weekend. The model sees value in backing McIlroy as the top European point scorer at +300 odds, which you can do with the latest <span><a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/betting/news/draftkings-promo-code/\" target=\"_blank\">DraftKings promo code</a></span>, which gives new users both $200 in bonus bets with your first $5 bet, and also over $200 off NFL Sunday Ticket. <a href=\"https://martech.cbssports.com/bt/redirect/prod?b=draftkings&c=sport\" target=\"_blank\">Claim the promotion here</a>:</p><h2>Top Team USA Debutant: J.J. Spaun (+370)</h2><p>Spaun is one of four Team USA golfers competing in their first Ryder Cup, and the model sees value in him finishing ahead of the other three. He has the longest odds of the four, behind Cameron Young, Ben Griffin and Russell Henry, the favorite of the four first-timers. Spaun has been at his best in some of the biggest tournaments this season, winning the 2025 U.S. Open, and forcing a playoff at both The Players Championship and FedEx St. Jude Championship, finishing second in each event. Spaun finished second in the Ryder Cup points list to earn an automatic qualifying position for the 2025 Ryder Cup. </p><p>Given his breakout season, the model sees value in backing Spaun to finish ahead of all other first-team Team USA golfers at his current price. You can make this play at DraftKings as well, and you can secure your <a href=\"https://martech.cbssports.com/bt/redirect/prod?b=draftkings&c=sport\" target=\"_blank\">$200 in bonus bets and NFL Sunday Ticket discount here:</a></p><h2>Want more 2025 Ryder Cup picks?</h2><p><strong>You've seen the model's 2025 Ryder Cup longshot picks for this weekend.

The Eagles traveled down to Tampa early in hopes of acclimating to the sweltering weather, but Bucs quarterback <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/2080032/baker-mayfield/\">Baker Mayfield</a> isn't sure it will help that much.</p><p><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhN3UpXAXrw\" target=\"_blank\">In an appearance on \"Rearview\" with Mark Sanchez</a>, Mayfield said Tampa intends to use the heat as a tool to wear down Philadelphia's defense. Mayfield said one extra day in the Florida humidity won't be enough to adjust by Sunday, and he even thinks that decision could backfire on the Eagles.</p><p>\"We'll have a good game plan, obviously, to try and tire these guys out,\" Mayfield said. \"Advantage for us, we're in Tampa, the heat. They're not used to that. I know there's been stories that broke about them coming down to Tampa a day early. I don't necessarily think that helps them. One day doesn't get you acclimated to this humidity. Honestly, I think it makes them think about it more when they get down here earlier.\"</p><a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/news/buying-or-selling-3-0-nfl-teams-who-are-super-bowl-contenders-bills-and-pretenders-colts-entering-week-4/\" target=\"_blank\">\n        <div>\n            <div>\n                <p>Buying or selling 3-0 NFL teams: Who are Super Bowl contenders (Bills) and pretenders (Colts) entering Week 4</p>\n                <p>\n                    Jeff Kerr                </p>\n            </div>\n                            <div>\n    <figure><img alt=\"Buying or selling 3-0 NFL teams: Who are Super Bowl contenders (Bills) and pretenders (Colts) entering Week 4\" src=\"https://sportshub.cbsistatic.com/i/r/2025/09/25/12824b90-32f5-4bf5-a0b8-0c75b9092135/thumbnail/270x152/be0c7a00fb3730818fe28a697ea08c27/daniel-jones-colts-g.jpg\" /></figure>\n                </div>\n                    </div>\n    </a>\n<p>Mayfield was also asked about playing in the heat during his Wednesday press conference, and he said the offense can tell when the opposing secondary is running low on fuel. That was part of the Bucs' game plan against the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/NYJ/new-york-jets/\">New York Jets</a> in Week 3.</p>\n<p>\"You could in the secondary, though, those guys were tired -- especially with what we were doing last week,\" Mayfield said. \"Putting the ball on the perimeter. Making them chase and tackle. We can feel it. Guys in the huddle will say, 'Hey, we are not as tired as they are.'\"</p><p>In a battle of unbeaten NFC contenders, the Buccaneers and Eagles are slated for a 1 p.m. ET kickoff on Sunday. The forecast calls for a 90-degree day with high humidity, according to Accuweather. The heat index could even creep up above 100 degrees, so conditioning will be a challenge for both sides, but Mayfield clearly thinks his side has the edge there.</p>\n<p>The Bucs have won six of their last seven against the Eagles, including four of five during Nick Sirianni's tenure as Philadelphia's coach. </p>\n            </div>\n    </div>"

They rank dead last in the league in yards allowed and only the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/MIA/miami-dolphins/\">Miami Dolphins</a> surrendered more points through three games. Defensive coordinator <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/2130129/zach-orr/\">Zach Orr</a> faced criticism for his unit's play during the 1-2 start, and one of his players, star safety <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/3136877/kyle-hamilton/\">Kyle Hamilton</a>, came to his defense and called the scrutiny \"unfair.\"</p><p>To be fair to the Ravens, they did see two of the NFL's best offenses when they squared off against the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/BUF/buffalo-bills/\">Buffalo Bills</a> in Week 1 and <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/DET/detroit-lions/\">Detroit Lions</a> in Week 3. For a team that has <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://cbssports.com/nfl/superbowl/\">Super Bowl</a> aspirations, though, allowing no fewer than 38 points to both of those squads is simply not good enough.</p><p>\"I feel like sometimes Ravens fans can be a little spoiled, just the amount of success that this franchise has had,\" <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3RTu1Vw_5Lg\">Hamilton said on Thursday</a>. \"We lose five games and the world's about to end. I think on Zach, it's unfair to put all the blame on him when there's 11 guys out there on the field that are playing their hearts. He's put us in the right positions. It's just a matter of us doing the right stuff.\"</p><p>Orr's track record as a defensive coordinator is minuscule but impressive. He took over last season after spending the previous two years as the Ravens' inside linebackers coach and fielded a top-10 defense in his debut campaign. It is a small sample size, but it suggests Baltimore still has a high ceiling on Orr's side of the ball.</p>\n<a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/news/nfl-week-4-predictions-picks-our-experts-go-head-to-head-on-packers-vs-cowboys-ravens-vs-chiefs-more/\" target=\"_blank\">\n        <div>\n            <div>\n                <p>NFL Week 4 predictions, picks: Our experts go head-to-head on Packers vs. Cowboys, Ravens vs. Chiefs, more</p>\n                <p>\n                    Jordan Dajani                </p>\n            </div>\n                            <div>\n    <figure><img alt=\"NFL Week 4 predictions, picks: Our experts go head-to-head on Packers vs. Cowboys, Ravens vs. Chiefs, more\" src=\"https://sportshub.cbsistatic.com/i/r/2025/09/25/9d0e9a20-fdfa-4d72-ad6c-48959e7cd22e/thumbnail/270x152/cd1b1745a3d26d61f8061dac65788066/jerry-jones-micah-parsons.jpg\" /></figure>\n                </div>\n                    </div>\n    </a>\n<p>The personnel is nearly identical to last year's unit, which should also be a source of optimism for a turnaround.

So it's up to us to go out and get the job done. It's not a Zach thing. It's not a coaching thing on the defensive side of the ball.

Kickoff is scheduled for 8:15 p.m. ET at State Farm Stadium and the over/under is 43.5 points, down three points from the opening line. The game features a loaded NFL DFS player pool, with some of the biggest names in the sport like Kyler Murray, Sam Darnold, Marvin Harrison Jr., Jaxon Smith-Njigba, and Trey McBride leading the way. James Conner (foot) was lost for the season last week, clearing the path for more carries for Trey Benson, Emari Demercado and Bam Knight.</p><p>Finding undervalued players at a cheap price is still the key to building a winning NFL DFS strategy in Showdown contests -- especially with this matchup featuring so many big-name players.

The former USC standout had a breakout 2024 season with the Minnesota Vikings: in 17 games as the starter, he completed 361 of 545 passes for 4,319 yards, 35 touchdowns, and 12 interceptions, leading the Vikings to a 14-3 regular season record. That performance earned him his first Pro Bowl selection and a lucrative free-agent contract with the Seahawks.</p><p>In 2025, Darnold has thrown for 663 yards with four touchdowns and two interceptions, and his completion percentage sits at 70.3%. He has a solid core of weapons at his disposal, led by Jaxon Smith-Njigba, Cooper Kupp and rookie Tory Horton. <a href=\"https://www.sportsline.com/insiders/nfl-dfs-picks-thursday-night-football-seahawks-vs-cardinals-fantasy-lineup-advice-projections-for-draftkings-fanduel-from-millionaire-maker-contest-winner/#ttag=09232025_agg_cbssports_dfs_football_nfl_jimmiekaylor_CardinalsSeahawksDFS\" target=\"_blank\">See who else to roster right here</a>.</p><p>Part of Kaylor's optimal NFL DFS strategy also includes rostering Cardinals tight end Trey McBride.

In 2024, McBride had a breakout year, catching 111 passes for 1,146 yards with two receiving touchdowns while adding one rushing score.</p><p>Through three weeks of the 2025 season, McBride has recorded 17 receptions for 182 yards and one touchdown, averaging over 10 yards per catch.

A few months ago, however, when the Aces were below .500 and the Fever were without <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/wnba/players/29362921/caitlin-clark/\">Caitlin Clark</a> and mired in an injury crisis, it seemed improbable. </p><p>The Aces suddenly flipped a switch and closed the regular season on a 16-game winning streak to earn the No. 2 seed, while the Fever won five of their final seven games to not only clinch a playoff berth but jump to the No. 6 seed.

They have the best player in the series and are a more talented team than the extremely shorthanded version of the Fever. The Fever are going to come out with all sorts of energy in front of their home crowd, and betting them to win the first quarter could be a good play. Wilson and the Aces are just better, though, and will win the game. <strong>Pick: Aces-4</strong></p>\n            </div>\n    </div>\n</article>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n                        </div>"
