However, both sides are off to solid starts, with Sevilla sitting ninth in La Liga entering today's action while Villareal is third. Both squads have been prolific thus far too, with Villareal tied for second with 10 goals in five matches while Sevilla is tied for fourth with nine goals on the season. <strong>The model rates over 2.5 goals as an A-rated play for Tuesday</strong>.</p><p><strong>More La Liga best bets</strong></p><ul><li><a href=\"https://www.sportsline.com/la-liga/picks/\" target=\"_blank\">Every La Liga match simulated 10,000 times</a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.sportsline.com/la-liga/picks/experts/?sc=\" target=\"_blank\">La Liga expert picks</a> </li></ul><h2>Tuesday MLB best bets</h2><ul><li><strong>Game: Cleveland Guardians vs. Detroit Tigers (Tuesday, 6:40 p.m. ET)</strong></li><li><strong>The Pick: Guardians +1.5 runs (-144)</strong></li></ul><p>Tarik Skubal is on the verge of a second consecutive AL Cy Young award and he's on the mound on Tuesday for Detroit. However, these are two franchises trending in opposite directions, with the Guardians winning nine of 10 to get back into the race while the Tigers have lost nine of 10. Gavin Williams has also been sensational for Cleveland this season and the potential for this to be a pitcher's duel makes playing the run line the savvy play here. <strong>The model says the Guardians cover in 63% of simulations</strong>.</p><ul><li><strong>Game: Cincinnati Reds vs. Pittsburgh Pirates (Tuesday, 6:40 p.m. ET)</strong></li><li><strong>The Pick: Reds money line (-154)</strong></li></ul><p>\"The Reds were great to us last week and now they control their destiny for a WC spot,\" SportsLine handicapper Matt Severance (28-21 on his last 49 MLB picks) said. \"Can't blow it Tuesday already by losing at home to a bad Pittsburgh team that is 29 games under .500 away and long eliminated. Reds starter Brady Singer is 8-4 with a 3.07 ERA at home.\"  </p><p><strong>More MLB best bets</strong></p><ul><li><a

We wish Sandy the very best in her next chapter.\"</p><p>Brondello led the Liberty to two WNBA Finals appearances, including the first championship win in franchise history in 2024. After winning the title last year, New York was the preseason favorite to go back-to-back in 2025, but the Liberty failed to reach those heights again. </p>\n<p>The Liberty went 27-17 in the regular season, which was only good for the 5-seed in the WNBA Playoffs. After taking Game 1 of their first round series with the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/wnba/teams/PHO/phoenix-mercury/\">Phoenix Mercury</a> to steal homecourt advantage, the Liberty got blown out at home in Game 2 and lost a nail-biter in Game 3 for a rather stunning first round exit. </p><p>The team announced they will begin their coaching search immediately. New York figures to be a coveted coaching job given the talent on the Liberty roster and the investment in the team from ownership. </p>\n<p>Brondello, meanwhile, will be the most experienced coach on the market for other teams looking to make a change.

After being left off the 2023 squad, he returns for a third Ryder Cup as the lone LIV golfer on the U.S. roster and is the most fascinating figure on the U.S. side.</p><p>Because of the uniqueness of his game, there are tons of questions about how you pick the right partner for DeChambeau, and because of his unique personality, there are some who question his fit in the team room. Brandel Chamblee called him a \"captain's nightmare\" on Monday night, but the other stars of the U.S. roster are embracing what Bryson's unique energy can provide this team. </p><p>Scottie Scheffler, who went 1-0-1 as DeChambeau's partner in the U.S. victory at Whistling Straights in 2021, thought he was \"tremendous\" to play with in the Ryder Cup, and noted that he's excited to be able to \"unleash\" DeChambeau in a raucous atmosphere at Bethpage Black. </p><p>\"I think Bryson is a tremendous competitor. He's a great partner as well. I partnered with him in 2021 at Whistling Straits and he was a tremendous guy to be out to be golf course with. He's a great guy and a good friend and he's been great in our team room,\" Scheffler said. \"He brings a lot of energy, the people love him, and I think he loves the opportunity to be able to represent his country. He's a multiple-time U.S. Open winner, and that means a lot to him. Being an American I think means a lot to him as well. I'm excited to kind of unleash him this week.\"</p>\n<a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/golf/news/bryson-dechambeau-ryder-cup-keegan-bradley-united-states/\" target=\"_blank\">\n        <div>\n            <div>\n                <p>The Bryson DeChambeau dilemma: How will Ryder Cup captain Keegan Bradley utilize United States' X-factor?</p>\n                <p>\n                    Patrick McDonald                </p>\n            </div>\n                            <div>\n    <figure><img alt=\"The Bryson DeChambeau dilemma: How will Ryder Cup captain Keegan Bradley utilize United States' X-factor?\" src=\"https://sportshub.cbsistatic.com/i/r/2025/09/19/4e0b6498-e010-4a97-8ebb-d0f1dd16e085/thumbnail/270x152/e3fb527d7f8596dae0e59f735da6c4d0/bryson-dechambeau-ryder-cup-2021-h.jpg\" /></figure>\n                </div>\n                    </div>\n    </a>\n<p>Xander Schauffele echoed those sentiments when he was asked about DeChambeau, explaining that he's talked with Bradley about how DeChambeau could be the difference for the U.S. team because his points might mean just a little more. </p><p>\"I was telling Keegan, I feel like Bryson could be like the difference for us in a strange way from the standpoint of feeding into these fans, the style of golf he plays,\" Schauffele said. \"And also how -- like you'll get me, I'll make a putt, and you won't see too much of a reaction. That's just who I am. That's kind of how I operate. Maybe it might change this week, who knows. These Ryder Cups bring out the best in you at times. </p><p>\"But Bryson is like, this is his arena. If he views himself as a gladiator golfer, this is as good as it gets. He's been awesome. He's been awesome in the team room. I'm excited to sort of see what he can do, and hopefully get a lot of points up on the board because his points might hit harder than maybe my points, for example, just because of how he might celebrate and get these fans into this tournament quickly.\"</p>\n<p>What remains to be seen is how often Bradley puts DeChambeau on the golf course this week. DeChambeau has only ever played in three sessions in his two previous Ryder Cup starts -- 2-3-1 record. However, if, as Schauffele posits, Bryson's points will \"hit harder,\" you'd want him playing more often and would certainly want him to be out there in the first session of Friday foursomes to get the crowd going. </p><p>Alternate shot is by far the toughest format to come up with the right pairing for DeChambeau. Based on the practice rounds he'll be playing with one of Ben Griffin, Justin Thomas or Cameron Young, and who his partner is could change for fourballs and foursomes. </p><p>In any case, it sounds like the game plan initially is to get DeChambeau on the course as often as possible. He certainly has the support of two of the U.S. team's top stars, who recognize his unique skillset and personality could rally the team and the crowd in a way no one else on the American side can. </p>\n            </div>"

Day 1 on Friday will consist of four alternate shot (foursome) matches in the morning and then four better ball (fourball) matches in the afternoon. As the hosts, the United States was allowed to select when the sessions of the first two days of the event are played, so team captain Keegan Bradley clearly feels confident that this cadence will put the Americans in the best chance to grab an early lead, and past results certainly indicate that.</p><p>The U.S. has utilized this strategy in five straight Ryder Cup events, posting a 12-4 overall record over those sessions. The U.S. went 6-2 in foursome matches when it last hosted in 2021, while the Europeans also know this strategy often works in favor of the host, as they went 7-1 across the foursome matches when they hosted in 2023.</p><p><em>For the 2025 Ryder Cup, you can use </em><a href=\"https://martech.cbssports.com/bt/redirect/prod?b=fanduel&c=sport\" target=\"_blank\"><em>FanDuel to get $300 in bonus bets instantly.</em></a><em> </em></p><p>One can also look at the composition of the respective teams to see why McClure favors the U.S. to start off with a lead. Five of the top six ranked players in the world are suiting up in the Red, White and Blue, with McIlroy the lone exception. The entire-12 man U.S. team ranks in the top 25, while three Europeans are outside the top 25, including Rahm at No. 73. Additionally, Bethpage Black hasn't been too kind to many of the Europeans who played it before when the course hosted the 2019 PGA Championship. Five of the seven Team Europe members who competed finished outside the top 25, while U.S. member, Patrick Cantlay (t3) nearly won the major and fellow member, Xander Schauffele, had a solid 16th-place finish. <a href=\"https://www.sportsline.com/insiders/2025-ryder-cup-odds-picks-proven-golf-model-reveals-best-bets-surprising-predictions-for-bethpage-black/#ttag=09232025_agg_cbssports_picks_golf_pgatour_model_RyderCup\" target=\"_blank\">See who else to pick here</a>.</p><h2>How to make 2025 Ryder Cup picks</h2><p>McClure is also targeting three other Ryder Cup best bets, including two more plus-money golf picks and the overall winner.

Two thousand transfers, nearly 60 coaching changes, massive roster turnover yet again.

We wanted to get the coaches' best guess on laying out the upper echelon of college hoops less than two months from the start of the season.

With the amount of returning production they have, with their coach they have, it seems like it's impossible to bet against them, especially when talking about the regular season and which team will be most consistent throughout the course.\"</li><li>\"Has Final Four experience, has a good amount of returning players, has a NPOY candidate, has won with dominant bigs and with balanced attack. Has the best culture and didn't just go out and buy players.\" </li><li>\"Any time you return two All-Americans, that's a good start. (Braden) Smith and (Trey) Kaufmann-Renn should be as good of an inside-out combination as any in the country. Add another four-year starter in (Fletcher) Loyer and there's three guys who were key pieces on a national championship runner-up two years ago. Combine that with their roster continuity and Painter and staff, and you have a team that should be as good as anyone. I have full confidence that they'll be squarely in the mix all year long.\"</li><li>\"It really feels like this could be the year for (Matt) Painter. Talented. Old. Deep. Experienced. They might not be loaded with lottery picks. But they're going to be tough.\"</li></ul><h3>    About Houston</h3><ul><li>\"Milos (Uzan) coming back with the talent already on that roster I think puts them on top.\" </li><li>\"High-level infusion of talent with great retention of key pieces. One of the best coaches in college basketball matched with a unique culture.\"</li><li>\"Was close last season, has a great team this year and will have a shot. … [Sampson] and his staff will keep putting themselves in play to win it these next three-to-four seasons.\"</li><li>\"They brought as much back as anyone. My hope is it's them this year. Man, their big guys the last two years covered so much ground on the floor, I've never seen anything like it. I'm a guy who's been pretty good at covering ball screens and coaching against it. Their guys were UNREAL. Now, two of those guys are gone, but most are back, and I'm just telling you, no one has bigs who recover like them.\"</li></ul><h3>About St. John's</h3><ul><li>\"I think they're going to be the toughest, most disciplined, grittiest combination of that — and freedom. I think there's going to be some tough, hard-nosed coaches and teams, but they won't have as much talent as St. John's.\"</li><li>\"Rick Pitino is a master of creating buy-in to defense and rebounding. Very talented roster that will connect and compete at a high level. That's hard to beat in this new model of college hoops.\" </li></ul><h3>About Duke, Florida and UConn</h3><ul><li>Duke: \"Cam Boozer's a unicorn that has won at an insanely high level and they have good returning pieces around him.\" </li><li>Florida: \"I'll take Florida as a slight edge over St. John's. I think they'll play the double bigs. They'll have the best frontcourt and frontcourt depth in the country. Their guard play will be terrific.\"</li><li>UConn: \"Love what Danny Hurley and his staff have done with their roster. They have an excellent blend of returners, homegrown, impact transfers, older, and incoming freshmen. Three out of four? Hope not!\"</li></ul><h2>    The takeaway<br />        </h2><p>So, how accurate are the coaches when it comes to picking, say, the top three teams ahead of each season? Here's the recent Candid Coaches history. </p><p><span><a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-basketball/news/candid-coaches-who-will-be-college-basketballs-best-team-in-2024-25/\" target=\"_blank\">A year ago</a></span>, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-basketball/teams/KANSAS/kansas-jayhawks/\">Kansas</a> was the top pick, followed by <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-basketball/teams/BAMA/alabama-crimson-tide/\">Alabama</a> and Houston. Kansas went on to its worst season under Bill Self and finished the year unranked. Alabama got a No. 2 seed and lost in the Elite Eight to Duke, but was a notch shy of being a top-three team. Houston was a hit, though. The Cougars lost in the national title game as a top seed and finished second at <a href=\"http://www.kenpom.com/\" target=\"_blank\">KenPom.com</a>.</p><p><span><a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-basketball/news/candid-coaches-who-will-be-the-best-college-basketball-team-this-season/\" target=\"_blank\">In 2023</a></span>, Kansas was <em>also</em> the pick to be No. 1 ... and just like 2025, the Jayhawks were not close to top-10 status. Purdue was second; that was a hit. The Boilermakers finished that season as national runners-up to UConn, got a 1-seed and were top-three at KenPom. The No. 3 preseason pick by coaches was Duke, which was a small miss. That Blue Devils team finished seventh at KenPom and got a No. 4 seed. </p>\n<p><span><a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-basketball/news/candid-coaches-which-college-basketball-team-will-be-the-best-in-the-country-in-the-2022-23-season/\" target=\"_blank\">In 2022</a></span>, our survey of 100-plus coaches had a clear-cut top three: UNC, followed by Houston and <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-basketball/teams/GONZAG/gonzaga-bulldogs/\">Gonzaga</a>. The Tar Heels were an infamous flameout, becoming the first team to be preseason No. 1 and not make the NCAAs. Houston was a wise pick; the Cougars finished No. 2 at KenPom in 2022-23 and went 33-4, losing in the Sweet 16. The Zags went 31-6, finished eighth at KenPom and earned a No. 3 seed, so another close pick but not a true hit. </p><p>And <span><a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-basketball/news/candid-coaches-who-will-be-the-best-team-and-most-likely-national-champion-this-season-in-college-basketball/\" target=\"_blank\">going back four years to 2021</a></span>, the top three: Gonzaga, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-basketball/teams/UCLA/ucla-bruins/\">UCLA</a>, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-basketball/teams/TEXAS/texas-longhorns/\">Texas</a>. The Bulldogs didn't win the title, but were No. 1 at KenPom that season and got a No. 1 seed. That's a hit. UCLA went 27-8, finished 11th at KenPom and was a No. 4, while Texas was 15th with a No. 6 seed, so a bit off the mark there.</p><p>All in all, I'd say the coaches are semi-reliable, but chances are good that one of Purdue, Houston, Duke or St. John's will not be a top 10-12 team and will fail to make a deep NCAA Tournament run, so keep that in mind. Also keep in mind that coaches are informed in large part by offseason rankings put together by the media. There were only a couple of schools that were truly outside-the-box choices. (For example, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-basketball/teams/TXTECH/texas-tech-red-raiders/\">Texas Tech</a> and <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-basketball/teams/ILL/illinois-fighting-illini/\">Illinois</a> each received one vote to be the<em> best</em> team in 2025-26.)</p>\n<p>As for Purdue and Houston comfortably being the top two vote-getters, I'm not surprised, though I am slightly let down in this regard: Every year I root for four or five teams to settle into the \"who should be preseason No. 1?\" dialogue, and in most years it winds up settling to one or two teams instead; 2025 is fated to be the same. I commend <span><a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-basketball/news/college-basketball-rankings-north-carolina-joins-top-25-and-1-after-late-addition-of-international-prospect/\" target=\"_blank\">Gary Parrish for buying in on St. John's as preseason No. 1</a></span> back in the spring and not backing off. I only received one vote for St. John's in my polling, but Parrish had many more, which led to their tie with Duke for third. </p><p>With the two most recent national champs (UConn and Florida) also poised to easily rank high in the preseason polls, it sets up for a tremendous season. A very good mix of big-name schools, familiar bullies and some high-profile coaches in search of their first national title.</p><p>When the preseason AP Top 25 is released in mid-October, I can almost guarantee you that Purdue and Houston will occupy the top two spots. When that happens, the stage will be set for the storylines that will follow those two over the ensuing five months. For Purdue, a chance to win its first national title and validate its status as a top-five program this decade with potential preseason player of the year <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-basketball/players/28954688/braden-smith/\">Braden Smith</a>. For Houston, it's all about atoning for the awkward and heartbreaking ending in the national title game against Florida. Will the Cougars be able to scale that season-long mountain one more time and get Kelvin Sampson his first national title?</p>\n<p>The season is 42 days away, and with this forecast on the top teams, I declare we can officially shift to preseason hype mode.</p>\n            </div>"

Detroit (85-71) is clinging to the top spot as it has lost six consecutive contests and nine of its last 10 to see its once-massive lead over Cleveland (84-72) dwindle to one game with six remaining.</p><p>The Guardians have been hot, winning 15 of 16 contests before having their 10-game winning streak halted with a 6-2 loss to the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/teams/MIN/minnesota-twins/\">Minnesota Twins</a> last Sunday. Cleveland, which swept a three-game series at Detroit prior to its four-game set in Minnesota, allowed more than two runs just once during the 10-game streak.</p><p>Detroit attempts to end its current slide behind ace <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/players/3126008/tarik-skubal/\">Tarik Skubal</a> (13-5, 2.23 ERA), who leads the AL in ERA and ranks second in strikeouts (233).

    "body": "<div>\n        <p>The Big Ten has long held a reputation for being \"old school.\" It was the league of \"three yards and a cloud of dust\" football. A lot has changed in the league in recent years, and it's not just due to expansion and realignment. It's the style of play on the field, too.</p><p>Now it's fair to wonder if the Big Ten has become the conference of quarterbacks.</p><p>We're still incredibly early in the season, and things are likely to change once we get into the meat of conference play. However, most Big Ten fans can look at their quarterback situation and feel confident about what they have going forward.</p><p>As we enter week five, the top five qualified quarterbacks in passer efficiency all call the Big Ten home. There's no way I can fact-check this, but I am confident that this is probably the only time it has ever happened. I'm sure the Big 12 has done it before, and the Pac-12 probably did as well, but not the Big Ten.</p>\n<table><tbody><tr><th>Quarterback</th><th>Passer Efficiency</th></tr><tr><td><p><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/players/28909557/jayden-maiava/\">Jayden Maiava</a>, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/teams/USC/usc-trojans/\">USC</a></p></td><td><p>208.8</p></td></tr><tr><td><p><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/players/28916321/fernando-mendoza/\">Fernando Mendoza</a>, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/teams/IND/indiana-hoosiers/\">Indiana</a></p></td><td><p>206.2</p></td></tr><tr><td><p><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/players/29391740/julian-sayin/\">Julian Sayin</a>, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/teams/OHIOST/ohio-state-buckeyes/\">Ohio State</a></p></td><td><p>199.8</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Demond Williams, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/teams/WASH/washington-huskies/\">Washington</a></p></td><td><p>198.8</p></td></tr><tr><td><p><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/players/28895698/dante-moore/\">Dante Moore</a></p></td><td><p>195.9</p></td></tr></tbody></table><p>And it doesn't stop with those top five. <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/teams/NEB/nebraska-cornhuskers/\">Nebraska's</a> <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/players/29392540/dylan-raiola/\">Dylan Raiola</a> checks in at 14. <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/teams/ILL/illinois-fighting-illini/\">Illinois</a>' <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/players/26701853/luke-altmyer/\">Luke Altmyer</a> is right behind him at No. 15 -- even after the disaster against Indiana. <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/teams/MICHST/michigan-state-spartans/\">Michigan State's</a> <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/players/28897339/aidan-chiles/\">Aidan Chiles</a> is 18th.</p><p>Furthermore, I've been tinkering with a new QB metric of my own. One, I believe, that does a better job of considering the different things quarterbacks in different offenses are asked to do. It's a work in progress (so much so that I haven't named it yet), but while it's not as emphatic about the Big Ten as passing efficiency, four of the top six are Jayden Maiava, Dante Moore, Fernando Mendoza and Julian Sayin. It's also much higher on <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/teams/MINN/minnesota-golden-gophers/\">Minnesota's</a> <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/players/29392854/drake-lindsey/\">Drake Lindsey</a> and <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/teams/MD/maryland-terrapins/\">Maryland's</a> <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/players/28906511/malik-washington/\">Malik Washington</a>. Here's a graphical representation of how the Big Ten's QBs compare to the rest of the country in both.</p><figure><p><img alt=\"qbs.png\" src=\"https://sportshub.cbsistatic.com/i/r/2025/09/22/286b4b16-8d13-41ec-bd7d-ef10281bf08b/resize/670x377/7705a10935f2f1ff1caf9f2ace6106ba/qbs.png\" /></p></figure><p>There's also <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/teams/RUT/rutgers-scarlet-knights/\">Rutgers</a>' <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/players/26700919/athan-kaliakmanis/\">Athan Kaliakmanis</a>, who ranks 25th in my metric and 26th in passer efficiency. According to PFF, Kaliakmanis has made 11 Big Time Throws (which ties him for third nationally), but he's done so without a single turnover-worthy throw. Kaliakmanis is the only QB in the country to make more than six Big Time Throws without a single turnover-worthy one. Perhaps that's why Kaliakmanis has the highest PFF grade of any QB with at least 100 dropbacks this season.</p><p>There are also a couple of freshman Big Ten quarterbacks whose stats are somewhat misleading. Maryland's Malik Washington has been a revelation, but his completion rate is only 59.7%. <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/teams/MICH/michigan-wolverines/\">Michigan's</a> <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/players/28906638/bryce-underwood/\">Bryce Underwood</a> is at 56.9%. Those numbers would look a lot different if Maryland receivers hadn't dropped 13 passes (most in the Power Four) or if Michigan's hadn't dropped 11 (second-most in the Power Four). Take away those attempts (we aren't assuming they were catches, just removing the attempts) and Washington's completion rate jumps to 66.1% while Underwood's moves to 63.7%.</p><p>If you want to look outside the statistics, take a look at the current Heisman odds. At <span><a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/betting/news/fanduel-promo-code/\" target=\"_blank\">Fanduel</a></span>, your current Heisman favorite is Indiana's Fernando Mendoza. <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/teams/OREG/oregon-ducks/\">Oregon's</a> Dante Moore is third. Ohio State's Julian Saying, USC's Jayden Maiava, and <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/teams/PSU/penn-state-nittany-lions/\">Penn State's</a> <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/players/28876938/drew-allar/\">Drew Allar</a> are all currently at 25-to-1 or better as well, putting them in the top 16.</p><p>Another thought I cannot fact-check, but I will say this is the first time in history the Big Ten has had six QBs within the top 16 Heisman favorites -- seven players overall (<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/players/29388894/jeremiah-smith/\">Jeremiah Smith</a> has the same odds as Moore) -- and not a single one was a running back.</p><p>As I said, the numbers will change as all these players begin facing Big Ten defenses every week, but as nonconference play wraps up, it's hard to argue that quarterback play in the Big Ten isn't at an all-time high.</p><h2>A critical clash</h2><p>Penn State and Oregon will meet this week in the biggest Big Ten game of the season so far, as it's a rematch of last year's Big Ten Championship Game. It's not a must-win for either team as far as winning the conference or reaching the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://cbssports.com/college-football/\">College Football</a> Playoff, but it kind of feels like one for Penn State, doesn't it?</p><p>While James Franklin and the Nittany Lions will do their best to dismiss the situation all week, there's no question that the program's failures in these types of games loom like an elephant-sized monkey on their back (or would it be a monkey-sized elephant in the room? Not intimidating, but a distraction all the same).</p><p>Penn State fans, feel free to skip to the next section, because I'm about to share a bunch of trends you're already too familiar with. James Franklin is 2-20 against AP top-six teams, which is the second-worst record by anyone who has coached in at least 20 such games. The worst record belongs to former <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/teams/VATECH/virginia-tech-hokies/\">Virginia Tech</a> coach Frank Beamer, who went 2-24 in such contests. At Penn State, Franklin is 2-17 and has lost 14 straight.</p><p>Yes, Penn State reached the Big Ten title game last year, but it lost, just like it did to Ohio State in the regular season. And, yes, Penn State won two playoff games, but it won them against <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/teams/SMU/smu-mustangs/\">SMU</a> and <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/teams/BOISE/boise-state-broncos/\">Boise State</a>. When it ran into <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/teams/ND/notre-dame-fighting-irish/\">Notre Dame</a>, it lost.</p><p>The perception that Penn State beats the teams it's supposed to beat but falters against opponents at its level or better will linger until the Nittany Lions change it. That's why, even with all the talk about returning talent and experience — and the addition of Jim Knowles as defensive coordinator — every compliment this offseason came with a familiar caveat: <em>yeah, but.</em></p><p>Saturday night, at home, will be Penn State's first chance this season to put those \"<em>yeah, buts</em>\" behind them. It will be a White-Out game, which have gone very well for the Nittany Lions. They've won their last six White-Out games, but it must be pointed out that while four of the opponents the Lions beat in those games were ranked, none were ranked higher than No. 10, and that was SMU in last year's playoff game. The other ranked teams were No. 16 Michigan (2019), No. 22 <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/teams/AUBURN/auburn-tigers/\">Auburn</a> (2021) and No. 24 <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/teams/IOWA/iowa-hawkeyes/\">Iowa</a> (2023).</p>\n<p>If Penn State wins, they immediately change from a potential national title threat to a legitimate title threat. If the Lions lose, well, I guess it won't be anything they aren't used to by now.</p><h2>Speaking of the same old, same old</h2>\n<p>Saturday felt like a big moment for Nebraska. The Cornhuskers were already 3-0 with a season-opening win over <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/teams/CINCY/cincinnati-bearcats/\">Cincinnati</a>, but hosting Michigan at Memorial Stadium was the kind of stage that could signal a return to national relevance.</p><p>It didn't happen. Nebraska lost 30-27, and the score didn't reflect how thoroughly it was beaten up front. Michigan ripped off three touchdown runs of 37 yards or longer, while the Huskers managed just 1.4 yards per carry after Dylan Raiola was sacked seven times. The loss doesn't erase progress under Matt Rhule, but any notion of Nebraska as a serious conference or playoff contender vanished.</p>\n<p>The final margin flattered the Huskers. They got a Hail Mary touchdown to close the first half and another score late with Michigan in clock-killing mode. The Wolverines even left points on the field, including a dropped end-zone pass from Bryce Underwood to <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/players/29431487/channing-goodwin/\">Channing Goodwin</a>.</p><p>Nebraska is improving. But Saturday showed how far the program still has to go.</p><h2>Where's the Indiana talk?</h2>\n<p>I swear, I'm not ignoring Indiana's 63-10 beatdown of Illinois because I'm an Illini. I haven't mentioned it here because I've written about it twice already. So if you're an Indiana fan looking to receive some flowers, you can read what I wrote about the Hoosiers in my <span><a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/news/college-football-playoff-vibe-check-week-4-indiana-sure-looks-like-the-next-indiana/\" target=\"_blank\">CFP Vibe Check on Sunday</a></span>, as well as in my power ratings this week </p>\n<a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/news/tom-fornellis-college-football-power-ratings-georgia-penn-state-indiana/\" target=\"_blank\">\n        <div>\n            <div>\n                <p>Tom Fornelli's College Football Power Ratings: Georgia surpasses Penn State, Indiana surges into top 10</p>\n                <p>\n                    Tom Fornelli                </p>\n            </div>\n                            <div>\n    <figure><img alt=\"Tom Fornelli's College Football Power Ratings: Georgia surpasses Penn State, Indiana surges into top 10\" src=\"https://sportshub.cbsistatic.com/i/r/2025/09/23/ff34dcc8-f610-4038-8982-7db95579237c/thumbnail/270x152/d48f8e6c212633e26f8a439b5b8e901d/georgia.png\" /></figure>\n                </div>\n                    </div>\n    </a>\n<h2>BADger vibes</h2><p>I never thought Luke Fickell was in danger of losing his job over the offseason. <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/teams/WISC/wisconsin-badgers/\">Wisconsin</a>'s 2025 schedule looked daunting, and everyone in Madison badly wanted his tenure to work. Even after last week's 38-14 loss to <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/teams/BAMA/alabama-crimson-tide/\">Alabama</a> — a game the Badgers were expected to lose — that belief held.</p><p>Still, it felt like fate was working against Fickell. The on-field results were concerning enough, but the Badgers also kept running into injury trouble, with quarterback Billy Edwards hurt in the opener. Meanwhile, former Wisconsin lineman Jason Eck was making headlines by guiding <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/teams/NMEX/new-mexico-lobos/\">New Mexico</a> to blowout wins over <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/teams/UCLA/ucla-bruins/\">UCLA</a>.</p><p>Edwards returned Saturday against Maryland. The bad news: he didn't finish the game. The worse news: it might not have mattered. Maryland, just a year removed from a 1-8 Big Ten season, looked like the better team from start to finish in a 27-10 win at Camp Randall. Getting blown out at Alabama is one thing. Losing by 17 at home to Maryland is another.</p>\n<p>That was the kind of game Wisconsin had to win to keep realistic bowl hopes alive. Instead, it turned ugly. Students chanted \"Fire Fickell\" as the Badgers trailed 20-0 at halftime, and most of them left before the second half. By then, large swaths of Camp Randall looked like a ghost town.</p>\n<p>The lives of college football coaches aren't all that different than those of the gladiators in Rome. Once the crowd turns on you, it's very difficult to win them back, and it feels like the Wisconsin faithful have made their decision. While buying Fickell out and hiring a replacement staff won't be cheap, it's probably less costly than fan apathy.</p><h2>Going with my gut</h2><p><em>Every week I pick the Big Ten games against the spread based on nothing but my gut reaction to the number. No digging into numbers -- just vibes, baby. I even track my record to embarrass myself publicly. Any game not included is due to there not being a posted line at time of publishing.</em></p>\n<p><strong>No. 6 Oregon at No. 3 Penn State</strong>: I don't know that we can say either one of these teams has been truly tested yet, but at least Oregon has gotten out of neutral. Still, while Dante Moore has been very good for the Ducks, he's yet to play on the road in an environment like the one he'll face Saturday night. At the same time, it's difficult to trust Penn State in a situation like this considering its history of not doing so! <strong><em>The Pick: Oregon +3.5</em></strong></p><p>No. 21 USC at No. 23 Illinois -- <strong><em>USC -7.5</em></strong><br />Rutgers at Minnesota -- <strong><em>Rutgers +5.5</em></strong><br />No. 1 Ohio State at Washington -- <strong><em>Washington +9.5</em></strong><br />No. 11 Indiana at Iowa -- <strong><em>Indiana -7.5</em></strong><br />UCLA at <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/teams/NWEST/northwestern-wildcats/\">Northwestern</a> -- <strong><em>UCLA +6.5</em></strong></p><p><strong>Last Week</strong>: 3-5<br /><strong>Season</strong>: 26-21</p>\n            </div>"

The Buckeyes are coming off a bye, and the team was a little lackluster in 2024 following its early bye weeks. OSU failed to cover in either contest following its two regular season byes last year, including narrowly beating Nebraska by four points, despite being favored by 25.5 points. As for the Huskies, they're also 3-0 on the season and coming off a 35-point road victory in a rivalry game with Washington State. Washington's 55.7 points per game are second-most in FBS as it should be able to stick with an Ohio State team that's allowing over 100 rushing yards per game, despite facing just one Power 4 team. The model has Washington covering nearly 60% of the time. <a href=\"https://www.sportsline.com/insiders/college-football-odds-lines-spreads-picks-predictions-betting-advice-for-week-5-2025-from-proven-model/#ttag=09222025_agg_cbssports_picks_football_ncaa_model_Week5collegefootballodds\" target=\"_blank\">See which other picks the model likes here</a>.</p><p>Another prediction: No. 9 Texas A&M (-6.5, 52.5) covers against Auburn well over 50% of the time at Saturday at 3:30 p.m. ET. Auburn fell out of the Top 25 following its defeat to Oklahoma, while the Aggies had a bye last Saturday, following their upset of then-No. 8 Notre Dame. The Tigers struggled containing QB John Mateer of OU, as he had 300 total yards, with touchdowns both thru the air on the ground, so Auburn should equally struggle with A&M's Marcel Reed. The quarterback has a 9:1 TD:INT and is averaging nearly 50 rushing yards per game. Add in that just two teams in the nation have allowed more sacks than Auburn, and just 10 FBS teams average more penalties, and the Tigers have several issues that A&M can exploit. SportsLine's model also predicts the Over hitting more than 50% of the time. <a href=\"https://www.sportsline.com/insiders/college-football-odds-lines-spreads-picks-predictions-betting-advice-for-week-5-2025-from-proven-model/#ttag=09222025_agg_cbssports_picks_football_ncaa_model_Week5collegefootballodds\" target=\"_blank\">See the rest of the model's picks here</a>.</p><h2>How to make college football picks for Week 5</h2><p>The model has also made the call on who wins and covers in every FBS matchup in Week 5, and it's calling for multiple upsets, including a shocking result in a ranked matchup. <a href=\"https://www.sportsline.com/insiders/college-football-odds-lines-spreads-picks-predictions-betting-advice-for-week-5-2025-from-proven-model/#ttag=09222025_agg_cbssports_picks_football_ncaa_model_Week5collegefootballodds\" target=\"_blank\">You can only get every pick for every game at SportsLine</a>, <strong>and for a limited time you can use promo code CHAMPIONSHIP to get your first month at SportsLine for $1.</strong></p><p><strong>So what college football picks can you make with confidence, and which underdogs win outright?

He's just 2 HRs shy of Carlos Peña's Rays record with 6 games left in the season. While Kremer is better at home than on the road, he has a higher HR/9 rate allowed at home.

Despite the left-on-left matchup today, we still like his value. Sam Aldegheri has been hit hard in his two starts this season, and the one HR he allowed was to a left-handed hitter.

    "body": "<div>\n        <p>Early-season Saturdays reveal a lot in <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://cbssports.com/college-football/\">college football</a>: which teams are built to last, which are still searching for rhythm, and which are already fading. By Week 5, the picture sharpens. Contenders get tested on the road, depth gets exposed, and conference play begins to separate perception from reality.</p><p>This weekend delivers all of it: <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/teams/OHIOST/ohio-state-buckeyes/\">Ohio State</a> stepping into one of the sport's loudest and most overlooked venues, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/teams/LSU/lsu-tigers/\">LSU</a> and <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/teams/MISS/ole-miss-rebels/\">Ole Miss</a> colliding in a rivalry that rarely disappoints, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/teams/OREG/oregon-ducks/\">Oregon</a> crossing the country into a <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/teams/PSU/penn-state-nittany-lions/\">Penn State</a> White Out, and <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/teams/BAMA/alabama-crimson-tide/\">Alabama</a>–<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/teams/UGA/georgia-bulldogs/\">Georgia</a> squaring off again with playoff implications in the balance.</p><p>These aren't just games -- they're measuring sticks. They'll show whether <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/teams/WASH/washington-huskies/\">Washington</a> can hang with the nation's best, if LSU looks like a title threat, if Penn State can flip the script in big moments, and if Alabama's early stumble was a blip or a warning.</p><p>Here's what to watch in Week 5 and how I see things going down. </p><h2>No. 1 Ohio State at Washington: Can the Huskies shock the nation? </h2><p><strong>My prediction: Ohio State 31, Washington 20</strong></p>\n<p>Seattle sets the stage for one of the weekend's most intriguing matchups: sailgating on Lake Washington, a deafening Husky Stadium, and an unranked Washington team eager to shock the country (3:30 p.m. ET on CBS, <a href=\"https://www.paramountplus.com/home/?cbscidmt=sports&ftag=PPM-22-10agi2j\" target=\"_blank\">Paramount+ Premium</a>). Ohio State enters as the No. 1 team in America, carrying arguably the sport's most talented roster. All eyes will be on the Buckeyes' suffocating defense as it tries to corral Demond Williams, one of the nation's most dynamic young quarterbacks.</p>\n<h3>OSU scouting report: Nation's best defense leads the way</h3><p>The Buckeyes bring the most complete defense in the country, with depth along the defensive line, versatility at linebacker, and <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/players/28898674/caleb-downs/\">Caleb Downs</a> anchoring a physical secondary. Matt Patricia's group plays fast, disciplined and rarely gives anything easy. Offensively, freshman quarterback <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/players/29391740/julian-sayin/\">Julian Sayin</a> has been efficient, leaning on elite receivers <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/players/29388894/jeremiah-smith/\">Jeremiah Smith</a> and <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/players/29124411/carnell-tate/\">Carnell Tate</a> while the run game continues to sort itself out. To slow the passing attack down, opponents must make Sayin's life in the pocket uncomfortable -- a task few defenses have managed.</p><h3>UW scouting report: QB <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/players/28904635/demond-williams-jr/\">Demond Williams Jr</a>. keeps them dangerous</h3><p>Williams Jr. has given the Huskies a clear identity with his creativity, accuracy and ability to extend plays. On the perimeter, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/players/28875368/denzel-boston/\">Denzel Boston</a> is a future <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://cbssports.com/nfl/\">NFL</a> player who provides a big-bodied target who can win matchups downfield, while <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/players/28877250/jonah-coleman/\">Jonah Coleman</a> adds toughness and burst to the run game. Defensively, Washington plays hard and fast but remains light up front and vulnerable in the secondary. The challenge will be finding enough balance to keep pace with Ohio State's size, speed and depth for all four quarters.</p><h3>Key factor: Early momentum swings</h3><p>For Washington, the path is clear: protect Williams, generate turnovers and maximize explosive opportunities in the passing game. For Ohio State, leaning on the nation's most talented defense while exploiting mismatches on the perimeter should swing the matchup. Ultimately, whichever team handles the early momentum swings will dictate how long this one stays competitive.</p>\n<h3>My call</h3><p>Washington delivers some early blows behind its quarterback and a raucous home crowd, but Ohio State's depth and balance prove too much as the game wears on.</p><hr /><h2>No. 4 LSU at No. 13 Ole Miss: A prove-it game in Oxford</h2><p><strong>My prediction: LSU 27, Ole Miss 24</strong></p>\n<p>Oxford hosts one of the SEC's most underrated rivalries, and the bad blood always delivers (a fun twist now has Lane Kiffin's daughter dating star LSU linebacker <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/players/29121720/whit-weeks/\">Whit Weeks</a>, <span><a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/news/lane-kiffin-reacts-to-daughters-dating-announcement-with-whit-weeks-ahead-of-lsu-ole-miss-showdown/\" target=\"_blank\">news she \"hard-launched\" this week</a></span>). Last year, LSU stole a late win in Baton Rouge. This time, the Tigers enter as slight road dogs against an Ole Miss team that believes it let one slip away. Expect tempo, physicality and plenty of fireworks.</p><h3>LSU scouting report: Searching for consistency</h3><p>The Tigers have the weapons but continue to search for consistency. Right tackle remains a concern, the left guard spot is unsettled, and the run game has stalled too often with penalties and miscues up front. <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/players/26701706/garrett-nussmeier/\">Garrett Nussmeier</a> finally looked healthy, pushing the ball downfield with more confidence against an FCS opponent. LSU's receivers can stretch defenses, and tight end <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/players/29390367/treydez-green/\">Trey'Dez Green</a> is close to returning. The run game has been hit-and-miss, but <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/players/29391036/jujuan-johnson/\">Ju'Juan Johnson</a>'s vision and shiftiness may give it a spark. Against a lighter Ole Miss front, LSU has to commit to running between the tackles and controlling time of possession against a quick-strike Lane Kiffin offense.</p>\n<h3>Ole Miss scouting report: New life with Chambliss</h3><p>Ole Miss has found new life offensively behind transfer quarterback <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/players/29754995/trinidad-chambliss/\">Trinidad Chambliss</a>, whose dual-threat ability has given Lane Kiffin a new wrinkle. He's dangerous on designed runs but has also shown poise as a passer, hitting downfield shots and extending plays with his arm. With a deep receiver group and Daquan Wright at tight end, the Rebels can stress defenses in multiple ways. Defensively, they play fast but are susceptible on the interior defensive line. Xzavian Harris is a massive presence in the middle, yet the rest of the front leans on speed off the edge and athletic linebackers in space. To beat LSU, Ole Miss must hold up between the tackles and force the Tigers into a one-dimensional passing attack — a game script that would swing in the Rebels' favor.</p><h3>Key factor: Which team dictates tempo?</h3><p>LSU has to lean on its run game while maximizing possessions and shrinking the game for Lane Kiffin's offense. For the Rebels, Chambliss' dual-threat ability is the wild card, especially against an LSU defense that has struggled with running quarterbacks in the past. Whichever team dictates style — LSU with physicality, or Ole Miss with tempo and space — will likely walk away with the win.</p><h3>My call</h3><p>LSU steadies itself, commits to the run game, and finds enough balance to kill off a feisty Ole Miss team in Oxford.</p>\n<hr /><h2>No. 6 Oregon at No. 3 Penn State: White Out pressure-cooker</h2><p><strong>My prediction: Oregon 21, Penn State 20</strong></p>\n<p>Happy Valley under the lights is as good as it gets, and this top-10 showdown has the feel of a season-defining moment. Penn State has cruised through an easy nonconference slate, while Oregon enters with a roster loaded with speed and depth at nearly every position. The question is whether James Franklin's program -- so often coming up short in these 50-50 games -- can finally break through against a heavyweight opponent.</p><h3>PSU scouting report: Trenches must finally deliver</h3><p>The Nittany Lions bring an experienced defense that's been opportunistic early, but the front seven will be tested against Oregon's physicality and a talented, if somewhat unproven, offensive line. Quarterback <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/players/28876938/drew-allar/\">Drew Allar</a> owns a 5-7 record against Top 25 opponents and has yet to consistently elevate his play on the biggest stage. He's supported by a proven backfield in Nick Singleton and <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/players/28875485/kaytron-allen/\">Kaytron Allen</a>, though the run game has yet to show its full punch this season. The offensive line has the makeup to be a strength but must deliver more than it has in early tune-ups. If Penn State is going to flip the narrative under Franklin, it starts with this group playing up to its potential.</p><h3>Oregon scouting report: Balance and <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/players/28895698/dante-moore/\">Dante Moore</a>'s poise</h3><p>Quarterback Dante Moore has given Oregon a steady hand, operating efficiently in the short and intermediate game while still showing the touch to stretch defenses vertically when opportunities arise. The Ducks remain balanced with a deep backfield and a true difference-maker at tight end in <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/players/29125433/kenyon-sadiq/\">Kenyon Sadiq</a>. Up front, the offensive line has yet to face a Jim Knowles–coached defense, which frustrated Will Stein's group in the Rose Bowl a year ago (when Knowles was at Ohio State). Defensively, Oregon is talented at every level, but the interior will be tested against Penn State's physical run game.</p>\n<h3>Key factor: Does Franklin have the big-game mettle?</h3><p>For Penn State, it's about controlling the trenches and keeping Allar comfortable behind a steady run game. For Oregon, the key is keeping Moore on schedule and asserting themselves at the line of scrimmage with a talented but still untested offensive front. Ultimately, this game will test whether Penn State can finally deliver in a true championship-type matchup — the kind Franklin's teams have too often let slip against top-10 opponents.</p><h3>My call</h3><p>Penn State pushes Oregon to the brink in front of a raucous home crowd, but the Ducks' balance and firepower prove decisive in the second half.</p><hr /><h2>No. 17 Alabama at No. 5 Georgia: A heavyweight SEC clash</h2><p><strong>My prediction: Georgia 35, Alabama 32</strong></p>\n<p>Few games in college football carry the weight of Alabama–Georgia, and Saturday night in Athens will be no exception. The Bulldogs enter as slight favorites, looking to reassert their identity after surviving a shootout in Knoxville, while the Crimson Tide arrive with renewed confidence after shaking off an early stumble. Last year's meeting turned into a showcase for <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/players/29419031/ryan-williams/\">Ryan Williams</a>' breakout, and with both rosters loaded again, this matchup has the makings of another physical, high-stakes battle that could swing the SEC race.</p>\n<h3>UGA scouting report: Bulldogs need more balance, less reliance on heroics</h3><p>The Bulldogs escaped Knoxville thanks to Gunnar Stockton's heroics, but they can't live week-to-week relying on their quarterback to bail them out. Georgia is at its best when the ground game sets the tone and the tight ends contribute in the passing game. The offensive line has the talent to dictate, with <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/players/26698200/micah-morris/\">Micah Morris</a> and <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/players/28901716/drew-bobo/\">Drew Bobo</a> anchoring a unit that should set the tone. For Georgia, it's about playing that old-school Georgia brand of complementary football -- time of possession, physical defense and asking Stockton to manage the game and pick his spots rather than carry the full load.</p><h3>UA scouting report: Tide clicking with <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/players/28878532/ty-simpson/\">Ty Simpson</a></h3><p>The Crimson Tide offense is starting to click with Ty Simpson under Ryan Grubb, especially in the play-action game. Ryan Williams remains the headliner, a slippery and explosive target who can shift matchups from the slot. Alabama still needs more consistency on the ground after being bottled up against Wisconsin, or risk leaning too heavily on Simpson's arm. Defensively, Kane Wommack's unit has settled in since the Florida State loss, with corners Domani Jackson and <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/players/29388081/zabien-brown/\">Zabien Brown</a> presenting a much tougher challenge for Georgia's passing game than what Tennessee offered up. The formula is straightforward: stop the run, make Georgia one-dimensional and force Stockton into pressure situations.</p><h3>Key factor: In the SEC, it's almost always the trenches</h3><p>Georgia wants to reestablish its identity by grinding the game down with its backs and tight ends, leaning on time of possession and physicality. Alabama's path runs through sharper execution on the ground and explosive plays from Williams and <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/players/28878358/germie-bernard/\">Germie Bernard</a> in the passing game. Both teams are loaded with athletes, but the battle in the trenches will ultimately decide how much each offense can lean into its strengths.</p>\n<h3>My call</h3><p>Athens at night is always a tough task. Expect a motivated Georgia defense to be the difference in Simpson's first SEC road start, with the Bulldogs leaning on their front seven to close it out late.</p><hr /><h2>Petagna's 3-team parlay</h2><p>You'll notice I'm picking two outright upsets in LSU and Oregon, but in a parlay, I'd rather the insurance. Alabama-Georgia gets sidelined here because my prediction falls within the spread. </p>\n            </div>"

However, the Guardians did just see him five days ago and he was roughed up by the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/teams/MIA/miami-marlins/\">Marlins</a> in his last start out before that. Meanwhile, Cleveland starter <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/players/2837689/gavin-williams/\">Gavin Williams</a> also saw the Tigers last week and repeated exposures like that often favor the hitters. <strong>The model predicts 8.4 runs on average and that the over hits 68% of the time</strong>.</p><p>Brewers money line vs. Padres (-102)</p><p>Randy Vazquez vs. <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/players/2910628/tobias-myers/\">Tobias Myers</a> isn't likely to be on par with <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/players/2167338/nick-pivetta/\">Nick Pivetta</a> vs. <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/players/2900486/freddy-peralta/\">Freddy Peralta</a> on Tuesday in an 11-inning classic between two NL playoff teams.
