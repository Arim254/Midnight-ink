Charles Oliveira vs. Mateusz Gamrot headlines the Oct. 11 card after Rafael Fiziev, Oliveira's previous opponent, pulled out.</p><p>UFC announced the new main event on Tuesday. Oliveira, the former UFC lightweight champion, also confirmed the booking, which pits Oliveira's world-class submissions against Gamrot's elite wrestling.</p><p>\"Opponent: Mateusz Gamrot,\" Oliveira said <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/DO9VajkEaXa/\">on social media</a>.  \"This is the guy we're going to battle in a great war. The rest just  wanted the hype, just wanted to stall and talk, but that's part of it,  that's how it is. </p><p>\"The focus is still the same fight in the freight of my people, my flag, in my house with a new opponent, so let's go here and Brazil for now.\"</p>\n<p>Oliveira (35-11, 1 NC) is currently one of UFC's most popular acts. A 15-year UFC veteran, Oliveira reinvented himself with an 11-fight win streak between 2018 and 2022. He defeated Tony Ferguson, Michael Chandler, Dustin Poirier and Justin Gaethje during that stretch, the latter three via stoppage in title fights. </p><p>\"Do Bronx\" has since struggled with consistency, sandwiching wins over Beneil Dariush and Chandler between losses to Islam Makhachev, Arman Tsarukyan, and Ilia Topuria. The upcoming fight will be his first since Topuria knocked him out in a vacant lightweight title fight on June 28. Oliveira holds records for most post-fight bonuses (20), most finishes (20), most performance bonuses (13) and most submissions (16) in UFC history.</p>\n<p>Gamrot campaigned for this fight from the moment Fiziev fell out. He's won four of his last five fights, including a TKO injury win over Fiziev. Most impressively, Gamrot beat Tsarukyan via decision in 2022. A recent loss to Dan Hooker sparked questions about Gamrot's ability at the elite level, but a win over Oliveira would remedy that. </p>\n            </div>"

Think of annual opponents as the SEC's spin on protected <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://cbssports.com/college-football/\">college football</a> rivals. </p><p>Instead of these protected rivalries being permanent, though, the league will reevaluate things after four years. So that leaves the door open for further changes in 2030. </p><p>The SEC made an effort to protect some of its most historic rivalries as it embarks on its latest scheduling initiative. With 16 teams to juggle, it was a Herculean effort. </p><a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/news/sec-football-schedule-league-releases-every-game-for-2026-29-with-three-annual-opponents-for-each-team/\" target=\"_blank\">\n        <div>\n            <div>\n                <p>SEC football schedule: League releases every game for 2026-29, with three annual opponents for each team</p>\n                <p>\n                    Will Backus                </p>\n            </div>\n                            <div>\n    <figure><img alt=\"SEC football schedule: League releases every game for 2026-29, with three annual opponents for each team\" src=\"https://sportshub.cbsistatic.com/i/r/2025/09/23/142b5f7e-f81e-4e7f-ab8c-a4afc552c0d6/thumbnail/270x152/1def4fb79fc25a1503758db9b092d074/adobe-express-file-2.jpg\" /></figure>\n                </div>\n                    </div>\n    </a>\n<p>That also means some major games were left by the wayside. Here's a look at the annual opponent decisions the SEC missed on with its new approach to scheduling. </p>\n<h2><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/teams/TENN/tennessee-volunteers/\">Tennessee</a> vs. <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/teams/FLA/florida-gators/\">Florida</a> </h2><p>Of all the exclusions on the annual opponents list, this one may be the most baffling. Sure, the Vols and Gators didn't play on a consistent basis until the SEC initially split into divisions in 1992, but it didn't take long for them to treat each other like ancient nemeses. The feud between Tennessee coach Phillip Fulmer and Florida coach Steve Spurrier was foundational to the SEC as it entered a new era. Those two often did battle atop the conference and on the national stage. </p><p>It did lose a bit of its luster in the later days of Fulmer's tenure, and following his departure, as Florida won 11 games in a row from 2005-15 -- the longest streak in series history -- but things are heating up again thanks to Tennessee's resurgence under new coach Josh Heupel. And, even during that losing streak, the flames of animosity never dimmed on either side. Tennessee has played the likes of <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/teams/VANDY/vanderbilt-commodores/\">Vanderbilt</a> and <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/teams/UK/kentucky-wildcats/\">Kentucky</a> for a longer period of time, but a win against Florida means more than most. </p><h2><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/teams/BAMA/alabama-crimson-tide/\">Alabama</a> vs. <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/teams/LSU/lsu-tigers/\">LSU</a> </h2><p>Not protecting the Alabama-LSU game is another critical error. Sure, it may be a tad unfair to ask the Crimson Tide to play <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/teams/AUBURN/auburn-tigers/\">Auburn</a>, Tennessee and LSU all in the same season for four more years in a row when there's a chance for a refresh. And sure, there's some history with <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/teams/MISSST/mississippi-state-bulldogs/\">Mississippi State</a>, though that rivalry is the definition of one-sided. But Alabama is no stranger to a difficult path given its recent occupancy in the SEC West, and there's few games the Crimson Tide and Tigers care about more than this one. </p>\n<p>Nick Saban coached both teams. During the 31-year existence of the SEC West, Alabama and LSU finished atop the division a combined 22 times. They were also responsible for 16 SEC titles during the divisional era. To call this rivalry prolific would be an understatement. </p><h2>Florida vs. LSU </h2><p>A world in which LSU plays neither Alabama nor Florida is an odd one to live in. The annual game between the Gators and the Tigers, which became a fixture in 1971, survived the SEC's divisional split. It survived the initial wave of conference expansion as the league temporarily adjusted its scheduling. In the past two decades, LSU and Florida have combined for 11 SEC titles and five national championships. </p><p>And the last annual meeting between the two -- for now, at least -- ended in a 20-10 victory for LSU earlier this month. The Tigers won six of the last seven and are 7-2 against the Gators since 2017. There's some behind-the-scenes buzz that LSU didn't want Florida as an annual opponent anymore, but the Gators -- and Alabama -- make a whole lot more sense on that schedule than <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/teams/TXAM/texas-am-aggies/\">Texas A&M</a>. </p>\n<h2><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/teams/ARK/arkansas-razorbacks/\">Arkansas</a> vs. <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/teams/OKLA/oklahoma-sooners/\">Oklahoma</a></h2><p>Here's a bit of a wildcard. Though Arkansas and Oklahoma are geographically closer to each other than they are to any other school in the SEC, and though they (very briefly, along time ago) shared the Southwest Conference, they have played just 15 times since 1899. The last time they saw each other one the field was in 2001. </p><p>So why are they included here? This was the SEC's opportunity to create something new with the benefit of conference expansion and the revamped scheduling format. Given the relatively close proximity between the two universities, there's plenty of crossover between the fans and alumni. Arkansas' three scheduled opponents are more historic rivals, so it's hard to pick a game to eliminate in favor of Oklahoma, but the Sooners playing <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/teams/MISS/ole-miss-rebels/\">Ole Miss</a> doesn't make much sense when the Razorbacks were potentially on the table. Maybe it's something the SEC can take a look at come 2030. The chance to create fresh, organic rivalries does not come often. </p>\n            </div>"

Coach Craig Berube will tire of Domi's penalty box trips.</strong></p><h3><strong>Toronto's LW2 -- <em>Mad Max's Replacement on Fury Road</em></strong></h3><p><strong>Contenders: </strong><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.rotowire.com/hockey/player.php?id=6653\"><strong>Bobby McMann</strong></a><strong>, C, </strong><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.rotowire.com/hockey/player.php?id=6154\"><strong>Dakota Joshua</strong></a><strong>, C, </strong><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.rotowire.com/hockey/player.php?id=6055\"><strong>Matias Maccelli</strong></a><strong>, LW, or </strong><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.rotowire.com/hockey/player.php?id=4155\"><strong>Max Domi</strong></a><strong>, C</strong></p><p>Willie and J.T. have remarkable chemistry, but over the last five seasons, they've had 19 different sidekicks. <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.rotowire.com/hockey/player.php?id=2809\">Max Pacioretty</a> was a great fit with them last year when he was healthy. Big, smart, and offensively minded. So, who's the next Mad Max? McMann has size and skill, but is inconsistent. Joshua has size, too, and he's willing to work the wall, but his offense is underdeveloped. Maccelli can elevate great goal scorers on his line, but he isn't great in tough areas. Domi was unreliable with and without the puck when he skated on this line last season. <strong>Edge: McMann, but the leash will be short. Joshua could steal time if he can show any offense. Then Maccelli. Domi is top line or third.</strong></p>\n<h3><strong>Edmonton's Top-Six Mash Up --<em> By Any Means Necessary To Get Connor McDavid To Re-Sign</em></strong></h3><p><strong>Contenders: </strong><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.rotowire.com/hockey/player.php?id=4663\"><strong>Andrew Mangiapane</strong></a><strong>, LW, </strong><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.rotowire.com/hockey/player.php?id=7339\"><strong>David Tomasek</strong></a><strong>, C, </strong><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.rotowire.com/hockey/player.php?id=6682\"><strong>Matthew Savoie</strong></a><strong>, C, </strong><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.rotowire.com/hockey/player.php?id=4392\"><strong>Kasperi Kapanen</strong></a><strong>, RW, </strong><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.rotowire.com/hockey/player.php?id=6009\"><strong>Vasily Podkolzin</strong></a><strong>, RW, or </strong><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.rotowire.com/hockey/player.php?id=3743\"><strong>Ryan Nugent-Hopkins</strong></a><strong>, LW (</strong><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.rotowire.com/hockey/player.php?id=4964\"><strong>Zach Hyman</strong></a><strong>, RW)</strong></p><p>The Oilers cannot afford to have three pivots flanked by a cheap buffet of wingers. Not with McSavior unsigned for next season. So, that means either <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.rotowire.com/hockey/player.php?id=4386\">Leon Draisaitl</a> or <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.rotowire.com/hockey/player.php?id=3743\">Ryan Nugent-Hopkins</a> will start at wing this year. My money is on Nugent-Hopkins, at least until Hyman is back from injury in early November. So, who are the next two?</p><p>Mangiapane has a 35-goal season under his belt, and he can play both sides when <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.rotowire.com/hockey/player.php?id=4964\">Zach Hyman</a> (wrist) returns. Tomasek's offense blossomed in the SHL last season, and the 29-year-old inked a one-year deal to finally live his NHL dream. He's a natural pivot, but he can also skate on the wing with stars. Savoie is uber-talented, but inexperienced. Podkolzin needs to prove he can play without crossing the line. Kapanen can't really play with anyone. <strong>RNH then edge Mangiapane and Tomasek.</strong> </p>\n<h3><strong>Ottawa's RW1 --<em> Pinch Me, I'm Playing with </em></strong><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.rotowire.com/hockey/player.php?id=6189\"><strong><em>Tim Stutzle</em></strong></a><strong><em> and </em></strong><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.rotowire.com/hockey/player.php?id=5695\"><strong><em>Brady Tkachuk</em></strong></a></h3><p><strong>Contenders: </strong><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.rotowire.com/hockey/player.php?id=2578\"><strong>Claude Giroux</strong></a><strong>, RW, </strong><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.rotowire.com/hockey/player.php?id=5500\"><strong>Fabian Zetterlund</strong></a><strong>, LW, or </strong><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.rotowire.com/hockey/player.php?id=5604\"><strong>Drake Batherson</strong></a><strong>, RW</strong></p><p>Giroux lost the gig by the end of last season, and Zetterlund took over. The former Shark didn't score much, but he showed promise in limited ice time. Batherson is the wild card here. He can play with stars, but the trio produced just two goals on 57 shots together last year. Batherson is better down the lineup, and he lifts the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.rotowire.com/hockey/player.php?id=5965\">Dylan Cozens</a>/<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.rotowire.com/hockey/player.php?id=2801\">David Perron</a> duo into a powerful trio. <strong>Edge Zetterlund. Giroux's feet are past their best-before date.</strong></p><h3><strong>Philadelphia's 1C -- <em>Who Feeds </em></strong><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.rotowire.com/hockey/player.php?id=6918\"><strong><em>Matvei Michkov</em></strong></a><strong><em>?</em></strong></h3><p><strong>Contenders: </strong><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.rotowire.com/hockey/player.php?id=3746\"><strong>Sean Couturier</strong></a>,<strong> C, or </strong><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.rotowire.com/hockey/player.php?id=5969\"><strong>Trevor Zegras</strong></a><strong>, C</strong></p><p>New coach Rick Tocchet said it best: <em>\"We'd be idiots\"</em> not to try Zegras with Michkov. Zegras has the talent to make a strong connection, but can he stand up to Tocchet's demands? Couturier is five seasons removed from meaningful fantasy production. He's better in a shutdown role. <strong>Edge Zegras.</strong> <strong>He's a risk, but he could also be a home run. </strong></p><h3><strong>Florida's RW2 -- <em>House Panthers Make The Purrfect Pet</em></strong></h3><p><strong>Contenders: </strong><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.rotowire.com/hockey/player.php?id=2905\"><strong>Brad Marchand</strong></a><strong>, C or </strong><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.rotowire.com/hockey/player.php?id=6479\"><strong>Mackie Samoskevich</strong></a><strong>, RW</strong></p><p>Samoskevich can lift you out of your seat with his speed and skill. Marchand does the same with his edginess and skill. Samoskevich is 22. Marchand is 37. The Honey Badger will have his workload managed all season long to save him for a push for a threepeat. So Samoskevich is going to get his chances, and he's going to impress. <strong>The edge goes to Marchand with a BIG BUT. It's a timeshare. </strong></p>\n<h3><strong>Winnipeg's 2C --<em> Some \"Upgrades\" Aren't Worth It</em></strong></h3><p><strong>Contenders: </strong><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.rotowire.com/hockey/player.php?id=3833\"><strong>Adam Lowry</strong></a><strong>, C, </strong><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.rotowire.com/hockey/player.php?id=3777\"><strong>Vladislav Namestnikov</strong></a>,<strong> C, or </strong><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.rotowire.com/hockey/player.php?id=2507\"><strong>Jonathan Toews</strong></a><strong>, C</strong></p><p>This is a bit of a hole, and it could be the undoing of the Jets this season. Especially with Nicholaj Ehlers plying his trade in Carolina. The team's top six is weaker without him, and they did little to upgrade. Lowry (hip) is a perfect 3C. Namestnikov can play the second line in bursts, but he's a better 3C. Toews? I adore the guy, but at 37, his 30-month absence from the NHL means brutal rust, especially on wheels that had already been slowing down. <strong>Edge Toews, BUT only for you to use him as trade bait. Move him if he can get off to a solid start. Don't be emotional about it. </strong></p><h3><strong>Montreal's 2C -- <em>Ugly, But It Fits</em></strong></h3><p><strong>Contenders: </strong><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.rotowire.com/hockey/player.php?id=5964\"><strong>Kirby Dach</strong></a><strong>, C, </strong><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.rotowire.com/hockey/player.php?id=5977\"><strong>Alex Newhook</strong></a><strong>, C or </strong><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.rotowire.com/hockey/player.php?id=6474\"><strong>Zachary Bolduc</strong></a><strong>, RW </strong></p><p>No matter who skates as the 2C, the gig won't last. The Habs are looking for an upgrade and haven't really been shy about it. Both Dach and Newhook have pedigree, but at 24, both are aging out of their potential. Bolduc is a sleeper here. The Quebec native has real talent, and he simply needs development to become a fan favorite and a fantasy contributor. That might be in 2026-27, though. <strong>Edge to no one, unless you're in a dynasty format. Then it's Bolduc all the way. </strong></p><h3><strong>Buffalo LW1 -- <em> </em></strong><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.rotowire.com/hockey/player.php?id=5172\"><strong><em>Tage Thompson</em></strong></a><strong><em>'s New Best Friend</em></strong></h3><p><strong>Contenders: </strong><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.rotowire.com/hockey/player.php?id=6932\"><strong>Zach Benson</strong></a><strong>, LW or </strong><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.rotowire.com/hockey/player.php?id=3556\"><strong>Jason Zucker</strong></a><strong>, LW</strong></p><p>This isn't really a fair fight. The gig beside TNT is Benson's to lose, even though Zucker produced 53 points last season. The much younger Benson is poised for a 55-point breakout this year. But Zucker is still a solid fantasy player because of his power play role. <strong>Edge Benson. I can't wait to start calling them Shrek and Donkey… get it?</strong></p>\n<h3><strong>New York Islanders 6D -- <em>Please Don't Break The Kid</em></strong></h3><p><strong>Contenders: </strong><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.rotowire.com/hockey/player.php?id=7359\"><strong>Matthew Schaefer</strong></a><strong>, D or </strong><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.rotowire.com/hockey/player.php?id=5693\"><strong>Adam Boqvist</strong></a><strong>, D</strong></p><p>This is a no-brainer. Seriously. Schaefer turned 18 on September 5. New GM Mathieu Darche will bring the Tampa Bay patience to Long Island. He's also not a stupid man. <strong>Edge Boqvist. Don't break the kid.</strong></p><h3><strong>New York Islanders Top Six --<em> Pick Four, Any Four… Well, Not ANY Four</em></strong></h3><p><strong>Contenders: LW: </strong><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.rotowire.com/hockey/player.php?id=4073\"><strong>Jonathan Drouin</strong></a><strong>, </strong><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.rotowire.com/hockey/player.php?id=3685\"><strong>Anders Lee</strong></a><strong>, </strong><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.rotowire.com/hockey/player.php?id=4228\"><strong>Anthony Duclair</strong></a> <strong>RW: </strong><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.rotowire.com/hockey/player.php?id=7508\"><strong>Maxim Shabanov</strong></a><strong>, </strong><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.rotowire.com/hockey/player.php?id=3272\"><strong>Kyle Palmieri</strong></a><strong>, </strong><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.rotowire.com/hockey/player.php?id=6039\"><strong>Simon Holmstrom</strong></a></p><p>Training camp opened with Lee and Palmieri skating with <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.rotowire.com/hockey/player.php?id=4778\">Mathew Barzal</a>, and Drouin and Shabanov slotted with <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.rotowire.com/hockey/player.php?id=4156\">Bo Horvat</a>. Will those lines stick? Not if <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.rotowire.com/hockey/player.php?id=4228\">Anthony Duclair</a> has a say in it. Duclair and coach Patrick Roy have mended their fences, and the winger has something to prove after a bad season. Shabanov has a lot to prove on the NHL's small ice. Drouin will excel, especially with the Avs' former power-play coach now on the Island. And he can play right wing. <strong>Edge? Lee and Palmieri seem like they're locked together. Drouin is a sure thing. Duclair will push Shabanov… maybe as far as the AHL.</strong></p>\n<h3><strong>Dallas' Power Play QB1 -- <em>What a Beautiful Problem To Have</em></strong></h3><p><strong>Contenders: </strong><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.rotowire.com/hockey/player.php?id=5534\"><strong>Miro Heiskanen</strong></a><strong>, D or </strong><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.rotowire.com/hockey/player.php?id=5971\"><strong>Thomas Harley</strong></a><strong>, D</strong></p><p>Both men can run the top unit. Harley emerged as the team's top option last year, and he can fire the puck. Heiskanen is more of a distributor, and he took a step back in 2024-25. Can the former take things higher? Yes. Will the latter ever come close to those 73 points he put up in 2022-23? No. Both can be 55-60 point, number one studs. <strong>Edge Harley because of the goals. But it's close.</strong> </p>\n            </div>"

Given that he entered the year with as much to prove as any coach in <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://cbssports.com/college-football/\">college football</a>, the 1-3 record was the last thing Napier needed in the quest to save his job. </p><p>With other schools already <span><a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/news/mike-gundy-took-oklahoma-state-from-afterthought-to-contender-but-he-also-sowed-the-seeds-to-its-unraveling/\" target=\"_blank\">making coaching decisions</a></span>, why hasn't Florida pulled the plug on Napier? Is the administration simply delaying the inevitable after a <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/news/miami-florida-game-score-live-updates-carson-beck-dj-lagway/live/\">26-7 rivalry loss</a> to <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/teams/MIAMI/miami-fla-hurricanes/\">Miami</a>? The answer might be twofold.</p><p>Players can participate in four games and still preserve their redshirt year. They also have 30 days to enter the portal if their coach is fired. Combine those elements, and Florida is at an impasse.</p><p>\"It would seem to make sense to hold on another week or two,\" <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.youtube.com/live/5S85RCNQlZw\">CBS Sports' John Talty said on \"CFB Insiders.\"</a> \"You could maybe do it on the second bye later on in the season. Because if you fire Billy Napier today, does <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/players/28904801/dj-lagway/\">DJ Lagway</a> say, 'I'm redshirting. I'm out of here.' You start losing guys. And then it gets really, really ugly down the stretch.

If he does not suit up before Napier's potential firing, he would retain his redshirt option regardless of how deep into the season his coach is canned.</p><p>But if Lagway does not miss time as expected, or if Florida seeks to keep as many players on board for the rest of the year and beyond as possible, how long will it hold onto Napier? The farewell would have to come after the fifth game and ideally on a bye week. That's why CBS Sports' Chris Hummer says to keep an eye on the week of Oct. 19 after the matchup against <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/teams/MISSST/mississippi-state-bulldogs/\">Mississippi State</a>.</p><p>\"If you talk to people around <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://cbssports.com/college-football/\">college football</a>, even people around Florida, they talk about the second bye week which is only in three more games for Florida,\" said Hummer. \"There's not a lot of opportunity for Billy Napier to save his job in that stretch, especially when you have to play <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/teams/TEXAS/texas-longhorns/\">Texas</a> and <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/teams/TXAM/texas-am-aggies/\">Texas A&M</a> in back-to-back weeks. So I think that redshirt rule and that 30-day window really looms over the situation for Florida, and that's why you might not see movement as soon as maybe Florida fans want to see it.\"</p>\n<p>Parting ways with Napier <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/news/billy-napier-buyout-contract-florida-head-coach/\">would cost a pretty penny</a>. Florida would owe Napier 85% of his remaining contract -- a figure that measures $19.38 after the 2025 season. It would also owe half of the buyout (about $9.7 million) within 30 days of the firing. The rest is due in equal installments every July through 2028.</p>\n            </div>"

While the four-time Pro Bowler undoubtedly is seeking revenge against the team that failed to sign him to a long-term deal, not everything about his trip to Dallas will be so sweet.</p><p>Squaring off against former teammates is a reality many <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://cbssports.com/nfl/\">NFL</a> players face. For Parsons, he suddenly has the task of attempting to sack the quarterback he long shared a sideline with in <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/1824864/dak-prescott/\">Dak Prescott</a>.</p><p>\"It's going to be painful,\" <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://x.com/RobMaaddi/status/1970610370352906626\">Parsons said to the Associated Press</a>. \"Dak's my guy. He was always a good mentor for me. But you know how it is. I always told him if I ever faced him that it would be a great matchup.

He debuted with a sack in Week 1, notched another half sack in Week 2 and is already up to 15 quarterback pressures through three games. Even when he doesn't get home, he makes life significantly more challenging for opposing signal-callers, and Prescott will soon be on the receiving end of that prowess.</p>\n<p>\"I accepted my fate weeks ago when the trade happened,\" Parsons told the AP. \"It's all about playing another game and just doing what I do best, and that's be a disruptive football player. I think the media and the fans are trying to blow it up to be such a big thing, but I just look at it as just another game at AT&T.\"</p><p>Tensions grew between Parsons and Cowboys owner Jerry Jones in a drawn-out negotiation process that dated back to 2023. Parsons requested a trade out of Dallas shortly after training camp opened this summer, and rather than finally bending to meet his star pass rusher's demands, Jones made a deal with Green Bay to move him off his roster.</p><p>The Packers promptly gave Parsons what he sought in Dallas, signing him to a four-year, $186 million contract that includes $120 million in guaranteed money.</p>\n<p>\"I have all the respect in the world for him, and we know him well,\" <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/news/cowboys-jerry-jones-has-all-the-respect-in-the-world-for-micah-parsons-ahead-of-facing-packers-in-week-4/\">Jones said of Parsons</a>. \"So you can bet that we'll be preparing for what he brings to the table. We'll be trying to come up with some antidotes for it too.\"</p>\n            </div>"

On Monday, Nakisa Bidarian, co-founder of Most Valuable Promotions, announced the stipulations for the boxing match that pits Paul, a cruiserweight by trade, against Davis, a lightweight champion.</p><p>MVP held a press conference in New York City for the Nov. 14 fight. The curious showdown will be a 10-round exhibition with three-minute rounds. The exhibition fight will not go on either fighter's professional  record, but ringside judges will be present to determine a winner. The maximum weight allowance is 185 pounds, and the fighters will wear 12-ounce gloves. </p><p>Paul has exclusively fought with 10-ounce gloves, excluding the 14-ounce gloves he wore for his exhibition match with Mike Tyson last November. Davis normally wears eight-ounce gloves, standard for fighters competing at welterweight or lower.</p><p>Last week, MVP announced the fight would take place at the Kaseya Center in Miami after plans to host the fight at Atlanta's State Farm Arena fell through. The exhibition fight <span><a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/boxing/news/jake-paul-vs-gervonta-davis-fight-officially-moved-to-miami-after-atlanta-plans-fall-through/\" target=\"_blank\">received pushback</a></span> from Georgia's athletic commission, which needed to approve the fight.</p>\n<p>The most glaring issue with Paul vs. Davis is the weight difference. Paul regularly competes at 200 pounds, roughly 65 pounds heavier than WBA lightweight champion Davis' normal weight class of 135.</p><p>Davis (30-0-1, 28 KOs) is vastly more experienced with stoppage wins over Ryan Garcia, Rolando Romero, Isaac Cruz and Mario Barrios. He's coming off a controversial majority draw against Lamont Roach Jr. Despite his experience, \"Tank\" is giving up a concerning amount of weight in this fight.</p>\n<p>Paul (12-1, 7 KOs) most recently beat Julio Cesar Chavez Jr. by unanimous decision. His most high-profile wins include former UFC middleweight champion Anderson Silva, Nate Diaz, and twice beating former UFC welterweight champ Tyron Woodley.</p>\n            </div>\n    </div>"

Houston has won the AFC South the past two seasons and six out of the past 10 years. Third-year quarterback C.J. Stroud is a big part of Houston's success. He has thrown for 3,700 yards and 20 touchdowns or more in each of his first two seasons. The latest Week 4 NFL odds list the Texans at -7, with an over/under at 38.5. Houston has won three of the last four meetings with Tennessee. </p><p>In a game featuring the smallest NFL line of the week, Caleb Williams and the Chicago Bears (-1.5) look to win their second game in a row when they take on the Las Vegas Raiders. Chicago rolled to a 31-14 win over the Dallas Cowboys in Week 3 as Williams passed for four touchdowns. Other tight NFL lines include Jets vs. Dolphins (-2.5), Ravens vs. Chiefs (+2.5), Commanders vs. Falcons (+1.5) and Vikings vs. Steelers (+2.5).
