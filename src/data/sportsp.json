    "body": "<div>\n        <p>On Sunday night, the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/wnba/teams/PHO/phoenix-mercury/\">Phoenix Mercury</a> eliminated the No. 1 seed <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/wnba/teams/MIN/minnesota-lynx/\">Minnesota Lynx</a> with an 86-81 win in Game 4 of the WNBA semifinals to make it back to the WNBA Finals for the first time since 2021.</p><p>Minnesota was without star <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/wnba/players/26677824/napheesa-collier/\">Napheesa Collier</a> (left foot injury) and coach Cheryl Reeve, who was suspended for one game. </p><p>\"It took everybody. Everybody on this team,\" Mercury forward Alyssa Thomas said during her postgame interview on the ESPN broadcast. \"We are hungry. We are ready for this moment and I'm just super proud of how we fought today.\"</p>\n<p><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/wnba/players/2130768/alyssa-thomas/\">Alyssa Thomas</a> flirted with a triple-double as she finished the night with 23 points, 10 assists and 8 rebounds. <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/wnba/players/26677941/satou-sabally/\">Satou Sabally</a> and <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/wnba/players/26677851/kahleah-copper/\">Kahleah Copper</a> put up 21 and 13 points, respectively. <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/wnba/players/1201037/dewanna-bonner/\">DeWanna Bonner</a> gave them 13 points off the bench and hit some key shots in the fourth quarter.</p>\n<p>Bonner was drafted by the Mercury fifth overall in the 2009 draft and played in Phoenix for 10 seasons, where she was a key part of the 2009 and 2014 championship teams, the WNBA's Sixth Woman of the Year in 2009, 2010 and 2011, and a three-time All-Star. She went to the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/wnba/teams/CT/connecticut-sun/\">Connecticut Sun</a> in free agency in 2020 and the Indiana Fever in free agency last offseason, but her time in Indiana didn't go smoothly and she was waived by the Fever in early June. The Mercury took advantage and traded for her, and while her offense has been spotty at times -- particularly in this series -- she came up big when it mattered the most</p><p>\"I'm sure that there was people wondering why I was playing (Bonner) at times this series. We went and got her for this reason. I told her after the game, the first three games weren't a big enough moment for her. She needed the fourth to step up. And I mean, she hit some big threes. Her experience, that's why you go get a player like that,\" Mercury head coach Nate Tibbetts said.</p><p>\"I'm just home,\" Bonner said. \"It feels good.\"</p><p>Even though the Lynx were shorthanded on the court and on the sidelines, they were still a tough out.</p>\n<p>Minnesota's effort was led by <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/wnba/players/2130762/kayla-mcbride/\">Kayla McBride</a>, who set a new playoff career-high with 31 points. She scored just 11 points in the first half but started to take over after the break with 14 points in the next 10 minutes. Her momentum helped her team outscore the Mercury 30-17 in the third and register their highest-scoring quarter of the series. Meanwhile, Phoenix forward Satou Sabally scored 18 points in the first half but was held to just three points in the third quarter. </p><p>But this series has been all about runs and stealing the momentum, which the Mercury did in the fourth quarter by turning up the intensity on both sides of the court. <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/wnba/players/26677803/sami-whitcomb/\">Sami Whitcomb</a> made it a one-point game with a 3-pointer with 4:46 remaining, getting fans at PHX Arena on their feet. A minute later, a 3-pointer by Bonner gave Phoenix a 72-70 lead. At that point, Minnesota only had one field goal in the fourth quarter.</p>\n<p>McBride tried to stop the bleeding with a 3-pointer of her own, but Bonner responded with another shot from beyond the arc. The Lynx tried to make a final push, but they were not able to find the lead again.</p>\n<p>\"It was a struggle for three quarters. I give Minnesota a ton of credit. That organization, that team, they got some really good players. What McBride did was super impressive,\" Tibbetts said. \"I mean, for our group, we could have said, 'We're just going to go to Game 5 in Minnesota and figure it out.' It was ugly at times for us, but we kept fighting, and that's what we do. We're a gritty group. We were down 13 or 14 to start the fourth, and we just kept playing. And when you do that, especially with this group, good things happen.\"</p><p>\"It's us versus everybody all season long,\" Sabally told ESPN. \"Champions win these games, and we did that.\"</p><p>Up next, Phoenix will face the winner of the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/wnba/teams/LVA/las-vegas-aces/\">Las Vegas Aces</a> vs. <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/wnba/teams/IND/indiana-fever/\">Indiana Fever</a> series in the Finals, which are set to start on Friday, Oct. 3. The Mercury are chasing their fourth WNBA title, which would tie them with the Lynx, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/wnba/teams/SEA/seattle-storm/\">Storm</a> and Comets for most all-time.</p>\n            </div>"

    "body": "<div>\n        <p>For more real-time, free picks every day: <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/betting/news/inside-the-lines-best-bets/live/\" target=\"_blank\">Inside the Lines Blog</a>.</p><h3>Best Home Run Bets for 9/30</h3><p>Do you know how impressive it is to finish near +40 units DESPITE a 2+ week stretch without a correct HR bet? That's just how powerful our Inside the Lines system was this season. I'll have my best Home Run Bets for the first day of the playoffs as soon as the lines are up.</p><p>In the meantime, these are my favorite futures bets before the playoffs start.</p><h3>2025 MLB Playoffs Best Bets</h3><h3>Wild Card Round</h3><p><br /><strong>Cleveland Guardians vs. Detroit Tigers Over 2.5 Series Games (-110, DraftKings)</strong></p><p>The Guardians had a historic comeback to win the AL Central, while the Tigers had a historic collapse, but the Tigers have Cy Young Winner Tarik Skubal on the mound while the Guardians don't. These are two evenly matched teams according to our Inside the Lines Model, so we think if the Tigers win Game 1, there's a good chance the Guardians take Game 2. </p><div><p><strong>New York Yankees vs. Boston Red Sox Over 2.5 Series Games (-105, DraftKings) </strong></p><p>This is another matchup where the home team (Yankees) are coming in hot and have been playing strong baseball, but the road team has pitching advantage. The Red Sox went 4-0 against the Yankees this season when Garrett Crochet was on the mound, and while Yankees' starter Max Fried had solid numbers against the Red Sox, he did allow them to hit .278. If the Red Sox win Game 1, we think there is a strong chance this gets to Game 3.</p><p><strong>Chicago Cubs to Win Series vs. San Diego Padres (-125, DraftKings)</strong></p><p>This play has almost everything to do with home/road splits. The Cubs are 50-31 at home this season, while the Padres are 38-43 on the road. Wrigleyville will be pumping during the playoffs, and the Cubs have a huge home advantage, which we think helps offset the loss of stud pitcher Cade Horton for this series. We set the line closer to -180 for the Cubs to take this series.</p></div><h3>American League</h3><div><p><strong>Seattle Mariners to Win the AL (+200, FanDuel)</strong></p><p>The Mariners currently have the most favorable path to the WS, as they have a first round bye then get the winner of Cleveland/Detroit in the ALDS and have home field advantage. Getting +200 here is good value, as you can likely hedge if they make the ALCS and still be profitable. The Mariners have the best rotation in the AL, while they revamped their lineup before the trade deadline.</p></div><table><tbody><tr><td>SEED</td><td>AL</td><td>WC</td><td>LDS</td><td>AL

    "body": "<div>\n        <p>Paramount and TKO Group Holdings on Monday announced the latter's long-awaited expansion into boxing with Paramount+ becoming the exclusive broadcasting home of Zuffa Boxing throughout North America. As part of a long-term media rights agreement, Paramount+ will air Zuffa boxing 12 cards in 2026 with the potential for select events to be simulcast on CBS and additional cards expected to be added in subsequent years. </p><p>Zuffa Boxing, the promotion formed in March by TKO and Saudi Arabia entertainment conglomerate Sela, is helmed by UFC president and CEO Dana White and WWE president Nick Khan in partnership with Sela CEO Dr. Rakhan Alharty and Turki Alalshikh, the chairman of the general entertainment authority and president of the Saudi Boxing Federation.</p><p>\"This partnership with Paramount reinforces our vision to redefine the way viewers consume boxing,\" Alalshikh said. \"More fight fans will now have access to watch some of the most exciting boxers around. We have seen the proof that the appetite is there, this is the future for live boxing coverage and will ensure the sport continues to thrive.\"</p><p>Alalshikh, who purchased \"The Ring\" magazine in 2024 and almost immediately debuted a boxing series of the same name, has been instrumental in the funding and promotion of boxing's biggest events in recent years, including the <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/boxing/news/errol-spence-vs-terence-crawford-fight-results-highlights-bud-dominates-to-become-undisputed-champ-via-tko/live/\" target=\"_blank\">Terence Crawford vs. Canelo Alvarez superfight</a> at Allegiant Stadium in Las Vegas earlier this month, the de facto soft launch of Zuffa Boxing.</p>\n<p>\"Timing is everything and the timing was perfect,\" White told CBS Sports. \"I met [Alalshikh] two years ago, and off of our first meeting, I had less-than-zero intent on getting into boxing. As I got to get to know him, he's obviously very passionate about the sport. He loves it and the boxing fights that have been made since he got into the sport would have never been done in a million years.\"</p><p>TKO, the parent company of UFC and WWE, last month <span><a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mma/news/ufc-paramount-announce-landmark-media-rights-agreement-in-exclusive-partnership-nixing-ppv-model/\" target=\"_blank\">signed a seven-year deal making Paramount+</a></span> the exclusive distributor of all UFC numbered and \"Fight Night\" events. </p><p>According to White, Zuffa Boxing will serve as a proving ground -- matching rising prospects against one another in 50/50 fights -- to create the stars of tomorrow that will one day appear on Alalshikh's \"The Ring\" and Riyadh Season events. If the model sounds similar to what UFC did with its integral launch of \"The Ultimate Fighter\" reality TV show in 2005, that's by design. Many \"TUF\" alumni went on to become UFC champions, including Forrest Griffin, Rashad Evans, Michael Bisping, Kamaru Usman, Rose Namajunas and TJ Dillashaw. </p>\n<p>\"When you think about the UFC and where we came from, it's hard for people to really wrap their heads around how humble the beginnings were,\" White said. \"We are going to start [Zuffa Boxing] from the ground up on the Paramount platform and matchmake great fights with guys who should be fighting each other at a young point in their career, and you start to build a relationship with the fans and they start to trust your product. Whatever night it lands on, it's destination TV, and people want to be there and people want to see it.\"</p><p>White, a former trainer and aspiring boxing manager in the late 1990s, was part of the Zuffa LLC company that purchased UFC in 2001 before its 2016 sale to current owner Endeavor. He helped build UFC into what quickly became the global leader in MMA promotion by focusing on \"all the things that I loved and hated about boxing.\"</p><p>White expects to do the same within the sweet science at a time when boxing openly lacks structure. He has not been shy saying he's modeling Zuffa Boxing after the former USA Network cult favorite \"Tuesday Night Fights,\" which aired from 1982-98. </p>\n<p>While the exact details of Zuffa Boxing's format are still being decided, White expects a reduction from the 17 weight divisions that exist in boxing. Furthermore, he aims to distance the sport from the current four-belt championship system operated by recognized sanctioning bodies WBC, WBA, WBO and IBF. </p><p>To help see that plan through, allowing Zuffa Boxing to create both an in-house rankings system and its own championships, TKO has led the charge for an amendment of the \"Professional Boxing Safety Act,\" which was enacted in 1996. The proposed adjustments, which have received bipartisan support, are expected to be presented in front of Congress later this year despite vocal criticism from some within the sport.</p><p>Not only did White say Zuffa Boxing will launch regardless of whether the changes are approved, he maintains that the hullabaloo is overstated.</p>\n<p>\"There will be zero changes to the [\"Muhammad Ali Boxing Reform Act\" of 2000]. Not one word will be changed; we are going to add on to it,\" White said. \"So, the fighters who want to fight under the Muhammad Ali Act exactly the way it is will have that opportunity to do that, or you can bet on me and fight with me under our version of the Muhammad Ali Act. That thing has been blown out of proportion, and I get it I knew people were going to freak out because that's what people do. The Muhammad Ali Act was put in place with all good intentions, but I think that it has held the business back.\"</p><p>White believes Zuffa Boxing can provide a shot in the arm to an American boxing market that has underdelivered in recent years. As he considers Zuffa Boxing its own independent league as much as a promotion, one should not expect White to consider co-promoting fights with the sport's incumbent powers. </p><p>\"I live in my own little bubble; I'm going to do my thing,\" he said. \"I'm not worried about what any of those guys are doing, and to be honest, those guys don't think big enough. These guys have been in the business for however long, and I think all of those guys think small. They don't think the way that I think. I'm not competing with the other promoters; I'm competing with whatever takes the attention of the fans on the night that we are on television.</p>\n<p>\"Some people say I can save [boxing], and some people say I'm the worst thing to ever happen to it. I have absolutely zero ego going into this thing because I know how messed up the sport is. I have a plan, I started to build a team, and I'm going to put my head down and grind like I do for the next couple of years and we will see where we end up.</p><p>\"I am very optimistic about this.\"</p><p><em>Paramount, a Skydance corporation, is the parent company of CBS Sports.</em></p>\n            </div>"

This time around it is a staggered start with Dolphins vs. Jets beginning at 7:15 p.m. ET, while Broncos vs. Bengals kicks at 8:15 p.m. ET. Joe Burrow's absence (toe) takes away some of the sparkle from the NFL DFS player pool from the late kick, but big-name skill players such as Ja'Marr Chase, Tee Higgins and Courtland Sutton are still in play. </p><p>Justin Fields, meanwhile, has been cleared from concussion protocol for the Jets, and he's also an intriguing option for NFL DFS picks, given his running ability.

It's been a bit of a slow start for one of the NFL's fastest players as he enters this matchup with a 15-198-1 receiving line for the season. There were signs of progress, however, against Buffalo in Week 3.</p><p>He scored his first touchdown of the season and saw a season-high 10 targets in that game. The Jets have given up the ninth-most Fantasy points to opposing receivers this year, setting the table for Hill to have a breakout game where he returns value for NFL DFS players. <a href=\"https://www.sportsline.com/insiders/nfl-dfs-week-4-jets-dolphins-broncos-bengals-optimal-fanduel-draftkings-lineups-for-monday-night-football-from-a-daily-fantasy-pro/#ttag=09292025_agg_cbssports_dfs_football_nfl_mcclure_MNFDFSMcClure\" target=\"_blank\">See who else to roster here</a>.</p><p>Part of McClure's optimal NFL DFS strategy also includes rostering Jets running back Breece Hall. His daily Fantasy price has dropped after two weeks of inefficient work on the ground. He could lose more carries to second-year pro Braelon Allen, but Hall is seeing an uptick in usage as a receiver, which could be x-factor on Monday.</p><p>He has eight catches for 78 yards this season and was targeted a season-high six times in Week 3. The Dolphins have been one of the worst defenses in the NFL in terms of defending running backs this season, so Hall is another player McClure likes building NFL DFS lineups around for this two-game slate. <a href=\"https://www.sportsline.com/insiders/nfl-dfs-week-4-jets-dolphins-broncos-bengals-optimal-fanduel-draftkings-lineups-for-monday-night-football-from-a-daily-fantasy-pro/#ttag=09292025_agg_cbssports_dfs_football_nfl_mcclure_MNFDFSMcClure\" target=\"_blank\">See who else to roster here</a>.</p><p><em>New users can see the latest </em><span><a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/betting/news/fanduel-promo-code/\" target=\"_blank\"><em>FanDuel promo code</em></a></span><em> to </em><a href=\"https://martech.cbssports.com/bt/redirect/prod?b=fanduel&c=sport\" target=\"_blank\"><em>get $300 in bonus bets at FanDuel if your $5 bet wins</em></a>:</p><h2>How to set NFL DFS lineups for Jets vs. Dolphins, Broncos vs. Bengals</h2><p>McClure is targeting another undervalued player who could explode for huge numbers on Monday Night Football.

But with the 4th easiest remaining strength of schedule based on their opponent's average power ranking above their projected remaining margin of victory is much better than their already sky high +10 neutral sim power ranking.</p><p><strong><em>Best Bet: Win Super Bowl (+450 FanDuel)... Sim 28% </em></strong></p><p><strong>Indianapolis Colts: </strong>If Adonai Mitchell doesn't fumble crossing the goal line, they probably would be undefeated. Last season they collapsed after the same thing happened to Jonathan Taylor. Hopefully for their sake that doesn't happen again. </p><p><strong><em>Best Bet: Colts to win AFC South (+100 DraftKings)... Sim 58%</em></strong></p><p><strong>Arizona Cardinals: </strong>They are a slight -1.3 average underdog in the power ranking simulation but a slight +0.7 favorite on average the rest of the actual regular season. They have lost two games by a combined 4 points. They have played well enough to be 3-1 and if Marvin Harrison Jr. didn't play like the worst WR in the league for 15 to 25 minutes a game they might be 4-0. </p><p><strong><em>Best Bet: Cardinals win Over 7.5 Games (-165 Caesars)... Sim 79%</em></strong></p><p><strong>New York Jets:</strong> We will update after Monday Night Football to see if they still make the cut.</p><p><strong>Miami Dolphins:</strong> We will update after Monday Night Football to see if they still make the cut.</p><p><strong>New Orleans Saints: </strong>They have been in position to take the lead late in the 2nd half of three of their four games. Brandin Cooks was 1 centimeter away from taking the lead vs the Bills at Buffalo. That, combined with their \"not so (Philly) special\" was the reason they didn't pull off the biggest upset of the year. They might end up as the most competitive 2 win team in history because they have coaches and players fighting for their professional lives so do not expect them to pack it in this season.</p><p><strong><em>Best Bet: Saints Win Over 3.5 Games (-150 FanDuel)... Sim 85%</em></strong></p><p><strong>Cleveland Browns: </strong>The defense is awesome. They allowed just 3.8 yards per carry and 6.2 yards per pass attempt to the Lions in Detroit. We predicted early this year that if Joe Flacco held onto the starting job he'd lead the league in multiple interception games and he already has two this season with just a 2 TD to 6 INT ratio. Quinshon Judkins is the real deal at RB and draft day afterthoughts, Isaiah Bond and Harold Fannin Jr., probably would be Day 2 picks in a draft redo. It's time to see if Dillon Gabriel could be another young Andy Dalton type with Cincinnati. Clear ceiling, but good enough to compete for divisions.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Best Bet: Browns Win Over 5.5 Games (-145 FanDuel)... Sim 53%...</strong>This is not a good value but if Baltimore's horrendous injuries last (especially Lamar Jackson's) and Joe Burrow misses the rest of the season and Aaron Rodgers takes a big hit at 40+ years old they may end up winning 7 to 8 games.</em></p><h3>Best Under Values</h3><p><strong>Detroit Lions: </strong>The good news for Detroit is they jumped 4 spots in our power ranking all the way to #1 in the league with a +10 average point differential in the power ranking simulations. But their rest of season average pt diff is barely a touchdown. Green Bay, despite their tie vs Dallas, still is an elite team that has the tie breaker currently. Minnesota is hit or miss but certainly is a playoff contender and Chicago is rising up the rankings with clutch play from Caleb Williams. </p><p>Even though our projected rest of season average point differential is much worse than their power ranking one we still see them as a good bet to win the division over Green Bay now that Green Bay's defense looks far more vulnerable.</p><p><em><strong>Best Bet: Detroit Wins NFC North (+140 Multiple Books)... Sim 58%</strong></em></p><p><strong>Philadelphia Eagles: </strong>The Giants' defense looks like a top 8 unit and the rookie combo of Dart + Skattebo can run their way to points, even without Malik Nabers. Now that those two games are no longer layups the Eagles only have 1 'cakewalk' the rest of the season (Week 15 at home vs the Raiders). They are still a strong value to win the division, win the NFC, and repeat to win the Super Bowl but it's less than 50% that they win 13+ games and FanDuel is offering a good price of -110 under 12.5 wins (other books have it at -140).</p><p><strong><em>Best Bet: Eagles Win Under 12.5 Games (-110 FanDuel)... Sim 52%</em></strong></p><p><strong>Green Bay Packers: </strong>The pass rush, which had four sacks in their first two games, only had three total their last two winless weeks. They haven't gotten to the QB and yet they also allowed both opponents to average around five yards per carry. The same strength of schedule issues that impact Detroit are impacting the Packers, but Green Bay has the advantage of playing the Bengals next week without Burrow and the Panthers, who still have a horrendous defense on the road. But with just two cakewalks, there is value on the Under in win total.</p><p><strong><em>Best Bet: Packers Under 10.5 Wins (+120 FanDuel)... Sim 59%</em></strong></p><p><strong>Washington Commanders: </strong>Jayden Daniels should be back next week but their problem was not Marcus Mariota or the offense. It was the defense that got rolled by the Falcons who scored 0 vs the Panther the week before. Daniels also does not look as sharp to start this season and it's not crazy to think he may have a sophomore slump like C.J. Stroud did now that no one underestimates him. Everyone knows he can make every throw and defenses plan for it.</p><p><strong><em>Best Bet: Washington Misses the Playoffs (-115 DraftKings)... Sim 60%</em></strong></p><p><strong>Cincinnati Bengals: </strong>TBD After Monday Night Football.</p><p><strong>New York Giants: </strong>Jaxson Dart was great running the ball but he also had to sit a few snaps after taking a hit.

They have not won a playoff series since 2017. Chicago made a blockbuster trade for outfielder <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/players/2184352/kyle-tucker/\">Kyle Tucker</a> this past winter and has largely delivered, at least until finger and calf injuries sabotaged his second half. Tucker will be a free agent this coming offseason. A strong postseason would help the Cubbies and also serve him well come contract time. <span><a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/news/cade-horton-injury-cubs-pitcher-likely-out-of-mlb-playoffs-through-nlds-after-suffering-broken-rib/\" target=\"_blank\">The Cubs will be without rookie Cade Horton through at least the NLDS because of a rib injury</a></span>. He might have been their Game 1 starter this postseason otherwise. Chicago scored the fourth-most runs per game and allowed the eighth-fewest runs per game in 2025. The Brewers and <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/teams/PHI/philadelphia-phillies/\">Philadelphia Phillies</a> were the only other teams to rank in the top eight of each.</p>\n<p><strong>Padres: </strong>This is the fourth postseason trip in six years for the Padres, who went to the playoffs five times in their first 50 seasons. They had a 2-1 series lead over the rival <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/teams/LAD/los-angeles-dodgers/\">Los Angeles Dodgers</a> in last year's NLDS, but did not score another run in the series, and were eliminated. This year's team is built around run prevention. The Padres were middle of the pack in runs scored despite hitting the third-fewest home runs. Their bullpen, even with <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/players/1846226/jason-adam/\">Jason Adam</a> injured, is the best and deepest in the sport. Their path to success is scratching out a few runs early, then turning a lead over to <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/players/2836849/jeremiah-estrada/\">Jeremiah Estrada</a>, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/players/26911802/mason-miller/\">Mason Miller</a>, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/players/2803408/adrian-morejon/\">Adrian Morejon</a>, and closer <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/players/26861461/robert-suarez/\">Robert Suarez</a>.</p>\n            </div>\n    </div>"

Had the Yanks prevailed in the division, then they would've enjoyed a first-round bye. Instead, they'll face the dangerous Red Sox in an already dangerous best-of-three series. Last year, the Yankees barged to the pennant before falling to the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/teams/LAD/los-angeles-dodgers/\">Dodgers</a> in the World Series in five games. Over the winter, they lost generational free agent <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/players/2507367/juan-soto/\">Juan Soto</a> to the crosstown <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/teams/NYM/new-york-mets/\">Mets</a>, but high-value performances from <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/players/2184451/trent-grisham/\">Trent Grisham</a> and <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/players/2165919/cody-bellinger/\">Cody Bellinger</a> helped cushion the blow and then some. Besides the usual rotation questions that accompany almost any playoff team, the Yankees' big subplot will be whether AL MVP candidate <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/players/2071264/aaron-judge/\">Aaron Judge</a> can flip the script on his generalized postseason struggles.</p>\n<p><strong>Red Sox</strong>: Boston is in the postseason for the first time since 2021 and just the second time since 2018, when they last won the World Series. The challenge for Alex Cora and the Sox will be toppling the Yanks without the services of rookie phenom <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/players/29075759/roman-anthony/\">Roman Anthony</a>. Anthony was perhaps Boston's best player starting with his June call-up, but an oblique injury suffered in early September will keep him out for at least this opening round. In more general terms, the Red Sox are hoping regular-season trends hold. That's because they won nine of 13 head-to-head games against the Yankees and outscored them by a margin of 66-51. In games played in the Bronx -- where the entirety of this series will take place -- the Sox went 5-2. </p>\n            </div>\n    </div>"

A former <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/teams/AUBURN/auburn-tigers/\">Auburn</a> linebacker and two-time All-SEC selection, Williams transitioned into coaching in 2009 and quickly rose through the ranks. He spent multiple stints at Auburn, including as co-defensive coordinator from 2019-20, before he joined Gus Malzahn at <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/teams/UCF/ucf-knights/\">UCF</a> for two seasons as defensive coordinator. </p><p>Pittman hired him at Arkansas in 2022, where Williams helped stabilize a unit that had struggled in the years prior.</p>\n<p>In spite of his résumé, the Razorbacks' defense faltered. Arkansas allowed 129 points over its past three games, including the 56 given up against <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/teams/ND/notre-dame-fighting-irish/\">Notre Dame</a> that proved to be Pittman's final game. The Razorbacks sit at 2-3 overall and near the bottom of the SEC in several defensive categories: last in points allowed per game (30.0), last in rushing yards allowed per game (168.0), 15th in passing yards allowed per game (257.0) and last in total yards allowed per game (425.0).</p><p>Pittman, whom Arkansas fired Sunday, leaves Fayetteville with a 32-34 overall record and a 14-29 mark in conference play. After leading Arkansas to a 9-4 record in 2021, the program regressed sharply, winning only two of its last 12 one-possession games under his watch. Athletic director Hunter Yurachek said the decision was made to give the program the best chance to compete at a national level.</p><p>Petrino, who previously guided the Razorbacks from 2008-11, has been named interim head coach and is a candidate for the permanent job. His first major move -- cutting ties with Williams -- is an aggressive pivot in an effort to turnaround the season.</p>\n<p>For Williams, whose coaching career began at Auburn more than a decade ago and has included both college and high school stops, the dismissal marks a sudden end to a tenure that once showed promise but could not overcome the Razorbacks' broader struggles.</p>\n            </div>"

The Tigers were able to squeak into the playoffs with a wild card and have the chance to make things right after their historic collapse. </p><p>The Guardians won the season series, eight games to five, and won five of the six games between the two teams in September. </p><p>Here's the Wild Card Series schedule for the Tigers vs. Guardians:</p><table><tbody><tr><th><br />  </th><th>Date</th><th>Start time/score</th><th>TV</th></tr><tr><td><p><strong>Game 1</strong> \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t</p></td><td><p>Tues., Sept. 30</p></td><td><p>1:08 p.m. ET</p></td><td><p>ESPN</p></td></tr><tr><td><p><strong>Game 2</strong> \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t</p></td><td><p>Weds., Oct. 1</p></td><td><p>1:08 p.m. ET</p></td><td><p>ESPN</p></td></tr><tr><td><p><strong>Game 3</strong> \t\t\t\t</p></td><td><p>Thurs., Oct. 2</p></td><td><p>TBD</p></td><td></td></tr></tbody></table><h2> Where to watch Game 1<br />  </h2><p><strong>Date:</strong> Tuesday, Sept. 1 | <strong>Time:</strong> 1:08 p.m. ET<br /> <strong>Location:</strong> Progressive Field (Cleveland)<br /><strong>TV channel: </strong>ESPN | <strong>Live stream</strong>: <a href=\"https://www.fubo.tv/welcome/leagues/191273?irad=377812&ftv_campaign=MLB_Wild_Card_Series_Teams_TBA\" target=\"_blank\">Fubo</a> (try for free)<br /> <strong>Probable pitchers:</strong> LHP Tarik Skubal (DET) vs. TBA<br /><strong>Odds:</strong> DET -150 | CLE +123 (via <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/betting/news/draftkings-promo-code/\">DraftKings</a>)</p>\n<p>Here's what you need to know about the Tigers and Guardians entering the Wild Card Series.</p><h2>Wild Card Series storylines</h2><p><strong>Tigers: </strong>It's all about shaking off the collapse. The Tigers had a double-digit lead in the AL Central as late as Sept. 3. Seeing that lead get smaller and smaller could've done a number on them mentally to the point that it snowballed on them. Heading into the playoffs, there's a clean slate. Every team is technically 0-0 now. It doesn't hurt that the Tigers have likely AL Cy Young winner <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/players/3126008/tarik-skubal/\">Tarik Skubal</a> set to start Game 1. Then again, the Guardians won two games started by Skubal in September.</p>\n<p><strong>Guardians:</strong> Despite the Tigers having Skubal, the Guardians arguably have the better rotation in this series. Gavin Williams, the expected Game 1 starter, has a 2.18 ERA in his last 12 starts. <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/players/28926327/tanner-bibee/\">Tanner Bibee</a> has a 1.30 ERA in his last four starts and rookie <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/players/29075750/parker-messick/\">Parker Messick</a> has been brilliant in his seven-start debut. The Guardians are, statistically, the worst offensive team in the playoffs and it's not particularly close, so they'll be looking to play low-scoring games and manufacture runs.</p>\n            </div>\n    </div>"

All are expected to be popular NFL DFS picks and centerpieces of NFL DFS lineups. </p><p>Who are the top NFL DFS picks for Dolphins vs. Jets and Bengals vs. Broncos, and which daily Fantasy sleepers should you target to differentiate your NFL DFS lineups and NFL DFS stacks?

He edged out over 355,000 other entrants in the contest and also has multiple five-figure tournament wins on his DFS resume. Kaylor has covered the NFL and college football for close to a decade as a member of the Pro Football Writers of America, and his background as a former college and NFL player gives him a unique perspective when building his fantasy lineups and locking in his betting picks. </p><p>Now, Kaylor has turned his attention to 'Monday Night Football' and just locked in his top daily Fantasy football picks. <a href=\"https://www.sportsline.com/insiders/nfl-dfs-picks-jets-vs-dolphins-broncos-vs-bengals-fantasy-lineup-advice-monday-night-football-projections-for-draftkings-fanduel-from-millionaire-maker-contest-winner/#ttag=09282025_agg_cbssports_dfs_football_nfl_jimmiekaylor_MondayNightFootballDFS\" target=\"_blank\">You can only see his Monday Night Football DFS picks and analysis at SportsLine</a>.</p><p><em>New users can </em><a href=\"https://martech.cbssports.com/bt/redirect/prod?b=draftkings&c=dfs\" target=\"_blank\"><em>get $50 in Pick6 credits at DraftKings when they play $5</em></a><em>: </em></p><h2>Top NFL DFS picks, lineups, stacks for Monday Night Football</h2><p>One of Kaylor's top DFS picks for 'Monday Night Football' is Broncos quarterback Bo Nix. As a rookie in 2024, Nix started all 17 games and delivered a solid performance, throwing for 3,775 yards on 376 of 567 attempts with 29 touchdowns and 12 interceptions, while adding 430 rushing yards and four rushing scores. His passer rating for 2024 was 93.3, and he finished the season ranked as QB6 in CBS Sports' final fantasy football rankings. </p><p>Through three weeks in 2025, Nix's numbers have been more modest: 535 passing yards on 61 of 95 passing (64.2 %), with five touchdowns, three interceptions, and a passer rating of 83.4. He's also rushed for 71 yards. Nix faces a Bengals defense that has given up 79 points in the team's last two games. <a href=\"https://www.sportsline.com/insiders/nfl-dfs-picks-jets-vs-dolphins-broncos-vs-bengals-fantasy-lineup-advice-monday-night-football-projections-for-draftkings-fanduel-from-millionaire-maker-contest-winner/#ttag=09282025_agg_cbssports_dfs_football_nfl_jimmiekaylor_MondayNightFootballDFS\" target=\"_blank\">See who else to roster here</a>.</p><p>Part of Kaylor's optimal NFL DFS strategy also includes rostering Bengals wide receiver Tee Higgins. In 2024, Higgins played in 12 games and recorded 73 receptions for 911 yards (12.5 yards per catch) and a career-high 10 receiving touchdowns. He ranked second on the Bengals (behind Triple Crown winner Ja'Marr Chase) in catches, yards, and touchdowns.  </p><p>In 2025, Higgins has seven catches for 104 yards, averaging 14.9 yards per reception, with one touchdown. With Denver expected to lock reigning NFL Defensive Player of the Year Patrick Surtain II on Chase, Higgins could be in line for an increase in targets. In one game gainst the Broncos in 2024, Higgins caught 11 passes for 131 yards and three scores. <a href=\"https://www.sportsline.com/insiders/nfl-dfs-picks-jets-vs-dolphins-broncos-vs-bengals-fantasy-lineup-advice-monday-night-football-projections-for-draftkings-fanduel-from-millionaire-maker-contest-winner/#ttag=09282025_agg_cbssports_dfs_football_nfl_jimmiekaylor_MondayNightFootballDFS\" target=\"_blank\">You can see the rest of Kaylor's NFL DFS picks here</a>.</p><p><em>New users can see the latest </em><span><a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/betting/news/fanduel-promo-code/\" target=\"_blank\"><em>FanDuel promo code</em></a></span><em> to </em><a href=\"https://martech.cbssports.com/bt/redirect/prod?b=fanduel&c=sport\" target=\"_blank\"><em>get $300 in bonus bets at FanDuel if your $5 bet wins</em></a><em>:</em></p><h2>How to build NFL DFS lineups for Monday Night Football</h2><p>Kaylor is also targeting another undervalued player who could explode for huge numbers on Monday Night Football.

    "body": "<div>\n        <p>The <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/DAL/dallas-cowboys/\">Dallas Cowboys</a> and <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/GB/green-bay-packers/\">Green Bay Packers</a> played the wildest game of Week 4 on Sunday night. The two teams combined for 925 yards of offense, 10 touchdowns and one scorigami.  That's right, we got a scorigami. </p><p>Packers kicker <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/2058320/brandon-mcmanus/\">Brandon McManus</a> drilled a 34-yard field goal on the final play of overtime to earn a 40-40 tie with the Cowboys. The tie game marked the 1,093rd unique final score in <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://cbssports.com/nfl/\">NFL</a> history. Not only was the game a scorigami, but it was also the highest-scoring tie in the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://cbssports.com/nfl/superbowl/\">Super Bowl</a> era, which dates back to 1966. The Cowboys and Packers also combined for the NFL's first tie since December 2022 when the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/WAS/washington-commanders/\">Washington Commanders</a> and <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/NYG/new-york-giants/\">New York Giants</a> ended in a 20-20 tie. </p><p>To get a scorigami, you usually need a few crazy things to happen and this game definitely had that. The most bizarre play came in the second quarter and it gave the Cowboys two points. After the Packers got a touchdown from <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/2961886/romeo-doubs/\">Romeo Doubs</a> to go up 13-0, McManus went out to attempt a routine extra point, but there was nothing routine about it. The Cowboys ended up blocking the kick and then <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/2804276/markquese-bell/\">Markquese Bell</a> picked it up and returned it for two points to make the score 13-2. </p>\n<p>That one play set the stage for the scorigami. Oh, and a wild fourth quarter also helped. </p>\n<p>There were a total of 17 points scored in the final two minutes of action. With 1:45 left in the game, Doubs caught a touchdown pass that put the Packers up 34-30. However, the Cowboys immediately responded by scoring a touchdown barely one minute later when <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/3123212/george-pickens/\">George Pickens</a> caught a 28-yard pass from <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/1824864/dak-prescott/\">Dak Prescott</a> with just 43 seconds left to give Dallas a 37-34 lead. That lead didn't last long, though, as the Packers drove down and got a 53-yard field goal from McManus on the final play of regulation to send the game to overtime. </p><p>This game marks the fifth time since the start of the 2022 season that the Cowboys have been involved in a scorigami. Before Sunday, their most recent one came in a 47-9 loss to the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/DET/detroit-lions/\">Detroit Lions</a> back in October 2024. As for the Packers, this is the first scorigami they've been involved in since the 2020 season when they beat the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/MIN/minnesota-vikings/\">Vikings</a>, 43-34. </p><p>Overall, this is the second scorgami of the 2025 season. The only other that happened came on \"Sunday Night Football\" in Week 1 when the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/BUF/buffalo-bills/\">Buffalo Bills</a> beat the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/BAL/baltimore-ravens/\">Baltimore Ravens</a>, 41-40. </p>\n<p>There were a total of seven scorigamis during the 2024 season, but since they become more difficult to achieve with each new score that happens, it would be surprising if we see as many this season, but we're already on a solid pace, so it could happen. </p>\n            </div>"
