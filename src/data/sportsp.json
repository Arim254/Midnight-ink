The Ravens are 4.5-point favorites, and the over/under is up to 53.5 after opening at 49.5, meaning this game should feature plenty of offense. Lamar Jackson, Jared Goff, Jahmyr Gibbs, Amon-Ra St. Brown, Jameson Williams, Derrick Henry and David Montgomery are just a few of the big names to consider for NFL DFS lineups.</p><p>Who are the top NFL DFS picks for Lions vs. Ravens, and which daily Fantasy sleepers should you target to differentiate your lineups?

He edged out over 355,000 other entrants in the contest and also has multiple five-figure tournament wins on his DFS resume. Kaylor has covered the NFL and college football for close to a decade as a member of the Pro Football Writers of America, and his background as a former college and NFL player gives him a unique perspective when building his fantasy lineups and locking in his betting picks. </p><p>Now, Kaylor has turned his attention to 'Monday Night Football' and just locked in his top daily Fantasy football picks. <a href=\"https://www.sportsline.com/insiders/nfl-dfs-picks-lions-vs-ravens-fantasy-lineup-advice-monday-night-football-projections-for-draftkings-fanduel-from-millionaire-maker-contest-winner/#ttag=09222025_agg_cbssports_dfs_football_nfl_jimmiekaylor_MondayNightFootballDFS\" target=\"_blank\">You can only see his Monday Night Football DFS picks and analysis at SportsLine</a>.</p><p><em>New users can </em><a href=\"https://martech.cbssports.com/bt/redirect/prod?b=draftkings&c=dfs\" target=\"_blank\"><em>get $50 in Pick6 credits at DraftKings when they play $5</em></a><em>: </em></p><h2>Top NFL DFS picks, lineups, stacks for Monday Night Football</h2><p>One of Kaylor's top DFS picks for 'Monday Night Football' is Ravens running back Derrick Henry, who has an over/under of 86.5 rushing yards. Experts have been predicting a decline for the now 31-year-old back for years now, and it simply is not happening. He opened this season with a massive 18-169-2 rushing line against the Bills in Week 1, before having a quieter Week 2 effort against the Browns.</p><p>The Lions have given up a rushing touchdown in both games so far in 2025, and with the Ravens favored, Henry could see heavy usage late in the game if they need to run the clock. <a href=\"https://www.sportsline.com/insiders/nfl-dfs-picks-lions-vs-ravens-fantasy-lineup-advice-monday-night-football-projections-for-draftkings-fanduel-from-millionaire-maker-contest-winner/#ttag=09222025_agg_cbssports_dfs_football_nfl_jimmiekaylor_MondayNightFootballDFS\" target=\"_blank\">See who else to roster right here</a>.</p><p>Part of Kaylor's optimal NFL DFS strategy also includes rostering Lions receiver Amon-Ra St. Brown. After being limited in Week 1, St. Brown exploded with nine catches for 115 yards and three touchdowns in the Week 2 win against the Bears. He's already been targeted 17 times this season, so he's the clear No. 1 option for quarterback Jared Goff since no other receiver has been targeted more than nine times. </p><p>In the only game where they've faced a competent passing attack, the Ravens gave up nearly 400 yards through the air against the Bills. Keon Coleman had 112 yards and a score in that game, and St. Brown certainly has the chance to match or even exceed those types of numbers on Monday.  <a href=\"https://www.sportsline.com/insiders/nfl-dfs-picks-lions-vs-ravens-fantasy-lineup-advice-monday-night-football-projections-for-draftkings-fanduel-from-millionaire-maker-contest-winner/#ttag=09222025_agg_cbssports_dfs_football_nfl_jimmiekaylor_MondayNightFootballDFS\" target=\"_blank\">You can see the rest of Kaylor's NFL DFS picks here</a>.</p><p><em>New users can see the latest </em><span><a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/betting/news/fanduel-promo-code/\" target=\"_blank\"><em>FanDuel promo code</em></a></span><em> to </em><a href=\"https://martech.cbssports.com/bt/redirect/prod?b=fanduel&c=sport\" target=\"_blank\"><em>get $300 in bonus bets at FanDuel if your $5 bet wins</em></a><em>:</em></p><h2>How to build NFL DFS lineups for Monday Night Football</h2><p>Kaylor is also targeting another undervalued player who could explode for huge numbers on Monday Night Football.

There was a reason for the rough outing: Coach Kyle Whittingham revealed Monday that Dampier had been dealing with an injury, despite not being listed on the availability reports last week.</p><p>\"He was doing the best he could,\" <a href=\"https://youtu.be/-IDLxGk2xQk?si=xmJ5KmVI3_gvc2j4\" target=\"_blank\">Whittingham said</a>. \"Wasn't able to practice Tuesday or Wednesday, a little bit Thursday. I'm going to tell you it definitely impacted Devon, but if you're out there, you got to get it done. So we never use that as an excuse.\"</p><p>Dampier sustained an ankle injury during Utah's Week 3 road game at <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/teams/WYO/wyoming-cowboys/\">Wyoming</a>, analyst Joel Klatt noted on Saturday's broadcast. He was also reportedly seen limping after that contest. The injury kept him from fully participating in Utah's normal padded practices, limiting his preparation for the Big 12 opener against the Red Raiders.</p><p>The 2025 season marks the first year of formal Big 12 player availability reports, following the lead of the ACC, Big Ten and SEC. Under the new rules, programs must submit daily reports starting three days before each game, with a final update 90 minutes before kickoff, listing players as available, probable, questionable, doubtful or out. </p>\n<a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/news/big-12-to-mandate-player-availability-reports-for-football-basketball-starting-in-2025-26/\" target=\"_blank\">\n        <div>\n            <div>\n                <p>Big 12 to mandate player availability reports for football, basketball starting in 2025-26</p>\n                <p>\n                    Cody Nagel                </p>\n            </div>\n                            <div>\n    <figure><img alt=\"Big 12 to mandate player availability reports for football, basketball starting in 2025-26\" src=\"https://sportshub.cbsistatic.com/i/r/2025/08/13/359b657a-6323-4653-a349-7f07af0e2fa1/thumbnail/270x152/e362839f78986782148905966e150e45/big-12.jpg\" /></figure>\n                </div>\n                    </div>\n    </a>\n<p>Although Dampier missed multiple practices, he was not listed on Utah's availability report last week before making his fourth start for the Utes.</p><p>Despite the setback, Whittingham emphasized that Dampier's current condition is improving when asked if the injury could be a long-term concern.</p><p>\"We hope not,\" Whittingham said. \"But again, we never discuss injuries here other than the injury report, so we will just have to see how it goes. I think he's in a better place. Well, I know he's in a better place right now on Monday than he was last Monday, so that bodes well.\"</p>\n<p>Dampier completed 25 of 38 passes for 162 yards in the loss. Utah's lone big play came on the first snap of their only touchdown drive, when Dampier connected with <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/players/29164633/dallen-bentley/\">Dallen Bentley</a> for a 44-yard gain. That score brought the Utes within 13-10 with 10:22 remaining in the fourth quarter, before Texas Tech pulled away with three unanswered touchdowns to close out the game.</p><p>Through the first three games of the season, Dampier had completed 73% of his passes for 628 yards and seven touchdowns without an interception. He had also added 198 rushing yards and a touchdown on the ground, showing the dual-threat ability that makes him Utah's centerpiece on offense.</p><p>\"(We) believe in him completely and he's without a doubt our quarterback and you can't panic off one game that was not up to par,\" Whittingham said. \"And again, we already talked about another reason why that may have been. ... I don't think one subpar game is fair to judge him off that. The first three games he was pretty darn good.\"</p>\n<p>Utah is on the road at <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/teams/WVU/west-virginia-mountaineers/\">West Virginia</a> this Saturday.</p>\n            </div>"

Baltimore (1-1) let a Week 1 lead over the Bills slip away, handing it a season-opening loss, before bouncing back with a 41-17 win over Cleveland last Sunday. Detroit (1-1) also lost its opener at Green Bay, before the Lions then manhandled the Chicago Bears, 52-21, in Week 2. The Ravens have dominated the all-time series with the Lions, with a 6-1 record, including five straight victories. Tight end Isaiah Likely (foot), defensive lineman Nnamdi Madubuike (neck) and fullback Patrick Ricard (calf) are out for Baltimore. Defensive end Marcus Davenport (chest) is out for Detroit.</p><p>Kickoff from M&T Bank Stadium in Baltimore is set for 8:15 p.m. ET. Baltimore is a 4.5-point favorite in the latest Lions vs. Ravens odds, and the over/under for total points scored is 53.5.

That was their third 52-point game over their last 13 regular-season contests as Detroit has as explosive an offense as there is. <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/2967690/amon-ra-st-brown/\">Amon-Ra St. Brown</a> and <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/3125968/jameson-williams/\">Jameson Williams</a> each had over 100 receiving yards, with the former also scoring three touchdowns, while <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/3162723/jahmyr-gibbs/\">Jahmyr Gibbs</a> and <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/2261252/david-montgomery/\">David Montgomery</a> both had a rushing score. <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/2061053/jared-goff/\">Jared Goff</a> was nearly flawless with 334 passing yards and as many passing touchdowns (five) as incompletions, as he went 23 for 28.</p><p>Dan Campbell knows hot to get his team up for big games like this one, as Detroit sports a 10-1-1 against-the-spread (ATS) record over its last 12 primetime games. Goff is 20-9-2 ATS in primetime, with that 69% cover rate being the best since 2000 among quarterbacks with at least 10 primetime starts. Additionally, the 2025 Ravens haven't lived up to the franchise's reputation for strong defensive play as the team ranks 31st in both yards allowed and passing yards allowed. <a href=\"https://www.sportsline.com/insiders/ravens-vs-lions-line-odds-proven-model-releases-spread-pick-for-2025-nfl-week-3-monday-night-football/#ttag=09182025_agg_cbssports_picks_football_nfl_model_RavensLionsmnf\" target=\"_blank\">See which team to back at SportsLine</a>. </p><h2>Why the Ravens can cover</h2><p>One only has to look at the series history of these two in order to feel confident about backing Baltimore as the Ravens have utterly dominated Detroit. Baltimore has won five straight meetings and is 4-0 all-time at home versus the Lions, with most of those blowouts. These teams met at M&T Bank Stadium less than two years ago as the Ravens won 38-6 against a Lions team that would end up in that year's NFC Title Game. Over the four all-time meetings between these two in Baltimore, the Ravens have an astounding 27.5-point average margin of victory.</p><p>No one has shined under the bright lights of Monday Night Football quite like <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/2181169/lamar-jackson/\">Lamar Jackson</a> as he has 22 passing touchdowns, three rushing touchdowns and zero interceptions in his career on Mondays. Also, he's dominated NFC opponents to the tune of a 24-2 career record against the conference. The Ravens lead the NFL in scoring offense this season, also topping the league in yards per play and yard per rush attempt. <a href=\"https://www.sportsline.com/insiders/ravens-vs-lions-line-odds-proven-model-releases-spread-pick-for-2025-nfl-week-3-monday-night-football/#ttag=09182025_agg_cbssports_picks_football_nfl_model_RavensLionsmnf\" target=\"_blank\">See which team to back at SportsLine</a>. </p><p><em>Check out the latest </em><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/betting/news/betmgm-promo-code/\"><em>BetMGM promo code</em></a><em> CBSSPORTS, where new users can </em><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://martech.cbssports.com/bt/redirect/prod?b=betmgm&c=sport\"><em>get up to $1,500 in bonus bets if your first bet loses</em></a><em>.</em></p><h2>How to make Lions vs. Ravens picks</h2><p>For this NFL Week 3 Monday Night Football game, the model is leaning over the total, and also says one side of the spread is the better value. <a href=\"https://www.sportsline.com/insiders/ravens-vs-lions-line-odds-proven-model-releases-spread-pick-for-2025-nfl-week-3-monday-night-football/#ttag=09182025_agg_cbssports_picks_football_nfl_model_RavensLionsmnf\" target=\"_blank\">See what it is at SportsLine</a>.</p><p><strong>Who wins Lions vs. Ravens, and which side of the spread is the better value? </strong><a href=\"https://www.sportsline.com/insiders/ravens-vs-lions-line-odds-proven-model-releases-spread-pick-for-2025-nfl-week-3-monday-night-football/#ttag=09182025_agg_cbssports_picks_football_nfl_model_RavensLionsmnf\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>Visit SportsLine now to see which side of the Ravens vs. Lions spread you need to jump, all from the model that is 37-17 on top-rated picks since 2024</strong></a><strong>, and find out.</strong></p>\n            </div>"

The two-time NFL MVP is one of the most dangerous dual-threat quarterbacks in the league, combining elite passing efficiency with game-changing rushing ability. In 2024, he completed 316 of 474 attempts for 4,172 passing yards, 41 touchdowns and only four interceptions. He also rushed for 915 yards adding four rushing touchdowns, making him the first quarterback ever to exceed 4,000 passing yards <em>and</em> 900 rushing yards in a single season.</p><p>In 2025, he has thrown for 434 yards, six passing touchdowns, and zero interceptions, while registering a QBR among the top in the league thus far. Over his career to date, Jackson has accumulated over 20,000 passing yards, more than 150 touchdown passes, and has kept his interception numbers relatively low, all while amassing among the highest rushing yard totals in quarterback history.  <a href=\"https://www.sportsline.com/insiders/nfl-dfs-week-3-ravens-vs-lions-optimal-fanduel-draftkings-lineups-for-monday-night-football-from-a-daily-fantasy-pro/#ttag=09222025_agg_cbssports_dfs_football_nfl_McClure_LionsRavensMNFDFS\" target=\"_blank\">See who else to roster here</a>.</p><p>Part of McClure's NFL DFS strategy also includes rostering Detroit running back Jahmyr Gibbs. The former Alabama standout is a versatile, explosive running back whose blend of speed, receiving ability, and vision make him a threat to break off an explosive play on nearly every snap. In 2024 he had a breakout season, rushing for 1,412 rushing yards and 16 rushing touchdowns, while adding 52 receptions for 517 yards with four receiving scores. </p><p>Gibbs led the NFL in total touchdowns (20) in 2024, tying or setting multiple franchise records along the way.

    "body": "<div>\n        <p>Keegan Bradley becoming the first playing captain in the Ryder Cup since Arnold Palmer in 1963 was widely assumed to happen this fall at Bethpage Black, but the United States captain opted to leave himself off the playing roster as the most notable snub of the captain's picks. </p><p>There was a time after his win at the Travelers that he was in his provisional roster, but as the Ryder Cup neared he realized the responsibilities as captain would be too much to handle while also playing. Still, as the U.S. team began practice Monday to officially start of Ryder Cup week, Bradley admitted he couldn't stop thinking about what it'd be like to be playing with his guys. </p><p>\"Definitely. I've thought about it every second,\" Bradley said. \"But I've also thought about how impossible it would be. </p><p>\"Like I said earlier, I was picked to do this job as captain, and there's been certain things that I've done during the week or lead-up that if I was playing, I don't think I could have done at the level that I needed to do them at. I catch myself every now and then looking down the fairway, seeing the guys walk down the fairway and think how badly I'd like to do that, and how badly I'd want to be in the group with Scottie Scheffler and seeing him play and being his teammate.</p>\n<p>\"But I feel like I've been called for a bigger cause here, to help our guys get ready to play and play at the highest level. But in the back of my mind, I'm always thinking, 'I could have been out there.' But ultimately, I can't tell you how much I've enjoyed being the captain and how I've enjoyed not having to worry about getting to sleep and getting my rest or how I haven't had to think about what time I'm going to go practice or meet my coach and then meet the guys. It simplified things a lot for me.\"</p><a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/golf/news/ryder-cup-2025-schedule-dates-format-explained-teams-bethpage-black/\" target=\"_blank\">\n        <div>\n            <div>\n                <p>2025 Ryder Cup schedule, dates: Format explained each day with teams set for Bethpage Black</p>\n                <p>\n                    Patrick McDonald                </p>\n            </div>\n                            <div>\n    <figure><img alt=\"2025 Ryder Cup schedule, dates: Format explained each day with teams set for Bethpage Black\" src=\"https://sportshub.cbsistatic.com/i/r/2025/09/22/bca4bb51-b3d1-44be-aba7-e55ad5ddf928/thumbnail/270x152/3f772af3eb3c7a19cc7407e599810310/ryder-cup-bethpage-tent-g.jpg\" /></figure>\n                </div>\n                    </div>\n    </a>\n<p>The hardest part of this for Bradley is clearly being out on the course, unable to help the team by hitting actual shots. At the same time, it seems like he's relieved to not have to juggle his responsibilities all week, and seems content that he's made the right decision, both for himself and the team. </p>\n<p>That's easy to say Monday, and Bradley is hoping his team will reward him with a Ryder Cup victory celebration Sunday night. If he's hoisting the Cup as the sun goes down at Bethpage Black, he won't have any regrets. But if things go wrong, the emotions will be unlike anything a Ryder Cup captain has ever felt, wondering if his biggest mistake was not picking up the clubs himself. </p>\n            </div>"
