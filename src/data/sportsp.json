    "body": "<div>\n<p>The promise of the new UEFA Champions League format, now in its second season, was that high-caliber matches would be scattered around the schedule from the get-go. Wednesday's clash between <span>Barcelona</span> and <span>Paris</span> Saint-Germain, then, will be a prime example of the theory in action as the title contenders face off on Matchday 2 of the league phase in a game that will serve as an early test of each side's credentials to win the whole thing.</p><p>In accordance with the occasion, the pre-match chatter has been one of mutual respect. Barcelona manager Hansi Flick described PSG as \"the best team in the world,\" the French side just a few months removed from their historic treble and a trip to the Club World Cup final. PSG's <span>Luis Enrique</span>, meanwhile, reflected on his own connection to Barcelona – he will return to the club where he spent much of his playing and managerial career, saying he's \"happy to be back,\" in a city he considers home. The PSG manager is fully aware of why many have circled this game on the league phase schedule, too.</p><p>\"For us, it's exciting and thrilling to play against a team that plays with the same mentality,\" Enrique said. \"They have a very high-level coach that I've known for a long time. Both the coach and the players are eager to play a good game. The two teams are similar, but the key will be to win the ball, in my opinion.\"</p><p>Here's what to know before tuning in.</p><h2>How to watch Barcelona vs. Paris Saint-Germain, odds</h2><ul><li><strong>Date</strong>: Wednesday, Oct. 1 | <strong>Time</strong>: 3 p.m. ET</li><li><strong>Location</strong>: Estadi Olimpic Lluis Companys -- Barcelona, <span>Spain</span></li><li><strong>Live stream: </strong><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.paramountplus.com/?cbscidmt=sports&ftag=PPM-03-10aie0i\">Paramount+</a></li><li><strong>Odds: </strong>Barcelona -125; Draw +330; Paris Saint-Germain +270</li></ul><h2>Injuries plague both Barcelona, PSG</h2><p>Wednesday's match may serve as a notable occasion but neither side will arrive at Estadi Olimpic Lluis Companys at full strength, which really makes this fixture more of an early test of each team's mettle rather than a lasting indictment on their true potential. That is especially true for PSG, who are still without <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/soccer/news/ballon-dor-results-psgs-ousmane-dembele-barcelonas-aitana-bonmati-take-home-awards-make-history/live/\">new Ballon d'Or winner Ousmane Dembele</a> as well as <span>Desire Doue</span> and <span>Marquinhos</span>. <span>Khvicha Kvaratskhelia</span> may not be available, either, making matters more challenging for the reigning European champions.</p><p>\"No matter which players are there tomorrow, they will be part of a strong team, which is what we are.\" Enrique said. \"We will prepare for the match in the same way, in the best possible way to try to win the match.\"</p><p>Flick, meanwhile, will be without <span>Fermin Lopez</span>, <span>Joan Garcia</span> and <span>Gavi</span>, each of them important players in Barcelona's attack-minded approach to the game.</p><p>\"It's part of our job: we have to know how to manage injuries,\" Flick said. \"We're missing important players in midfield, but we have to have confidence in the young players.\"</p><p>A handful of Barcelona's <span>stars</span> will be available for selection including Ballon d'Or runner-up <span>Lamine Yamal</span>, as well as <span>Raphinha</span> and <span>Robert Lewandowski</span>. The player of focus on Wednesday, though, just might be <span>Pedri</span>. The midfielder's profile rose after retired <span>Manchester United</span> midfielder Paul Scholes called Pedri his new favorite player following Barcelona's win at Newcastle United, with Enrique adding his own praise to the long list of compliments Pedri has earned.</p><p>\"I know Pedri well,\" Enrique said. \"He's a fantastic player. I love watching Barca, and especially a player like Pedri. He's like Harry Potter but I really hope he leaves his magic at home tomorrow. Although Barça isn't just Pedri; there are a lot of good players.\"</p>\n            </div>"

    "body": "<div>\n        <p><span>LONDON -- </span>It's the 60th minute of a match that is far from won. Play has been stopped before <span>Benfica's</span> Dodi Lukebakio can deliver a free kick from what looks to be a dangerous spot in the left channel. There is a tenuous 1-0 lead to worry about but there is only one thing Stamford Bridge wants to do. Not for the first nor last time tonight, Jose Mourinho's name is chanted to the rafters.</p><p>He obliges his adoring public with a wave. And another. And another. At four, a simple acknowledgment will no longer do, at least for the most rabid admirers of <span>Chelsea's</span> former manager. Top-knotted and summer scarves, a fan by the away dugout pleads for Mourinho to turn around and afford him the finest of selfies. </p><p>So much for the football, the real star of the show is the man prowling far beyond the confines of his technical area. When red and blue shirts vie for possession, Mourinho stands barely half a foot away. He stands imperial. All this is his, the house that Jose built. </p><p>Chelsea fans have spent the last four years pining for teams as gloriously arrogant and remorselessly competitive as a Special One's. Before Clearlake, the identity of this club was no less defined Roman Abramovich and his billions than by the atmosphere Jose Mourinho imbued from day one. Every game mattered. Chelsea players would fight with opponents, their officials, their employers. Rules might have been bent -- the Football Association certainly seems to think so -- because winning mattered above all else.</p>\n<p>And that was the rather dispiriting side to Mourinho's return. All the histrionics, the toying with the crowd, the yellow card at the death: they should be in pursuit of something. What has made Mourinho one of the game's great characters is how his qualities translate themselves onto the field. Even when his teams cost hundreds of millions to assemble, they play with the spirit of underdogs. They snap and snarl, imbuing the contest with a sense of jeopardy.</p><p>Not this time. Perhaps that is just a function of this being match two of the eight game league phase. The tame denouement of a dreary game indicated as much. Richard Rios' first half own goal won't decide whether Benfica reach the knockout stages with a top 24 finish. It might not be the decisive game in Chelsea winning a bye to the last 16. </p><p>Still the mere presence of a Mourinho at the peak of his powers would have raised the stakes significantly whatever the occasion. He will always be adored in this part of London but he should be feared too. Enzo Maresca rolling out what looked like it would pass for last season's Conference League attack might have gone punished but a heavily rotated Chelsea side were still far ahead of Benfica in talent terms. When Mourinho rocked up with Inter, <span>Manchester United</span> or Tottenham, he was afforded the same adulation he got tonight. That came with a caveat, mind. Hostilities would soon commence and Mourinho's players would offer Chelsea no quarter.</p>\n<p>If it had been anything like that tonight, this could have gone badly wrong for Maresca, who really did not need an illustrious predecessor returning at a time while his team was faltering. The performances befitting their titles were not coming before tonight and they did not come tonight either. The world champions were not very good. They didn't need to be. Their visitors worked hard and flashed danger down the flanks, particularly through Lukebakio, yet only seemed to really threaten Robert Sanchez's goal when Frederik Aursnes was in an offside position. There was no bus parking from Benfica but this team lacked the verve and motor to really test Maresca's. When Mourinho did spot the sort of opening that he would have pounced on in his prime, it was shut down in a flash.</p><p>\"I tried to change the left winger because I saw Malo Gusto was in trouble,\" he said. \"Maresca has Malo Gusto in difficulty. Maresca put on a better player than Malo Gusto [Reece James]. This is the challenge of facing Chelsea.\"</p><p>Ultimately, if the second half felt like it was building towards anything, it was the Mourinho post-match press conference, which, box office though he may be, was this subdued homecoming writ large. As he had Monday, Mourinho embraced old friends and indulged in his more reflective side. That almost seemed to be the point, cameras pointed at his conversations and pile of biscuits, the matter of what happened on the pitch rather parked to the side.</p>\n<p>When he spoke in English, he had a legacy: that familiar reminder of his sacking before he could bring a trophy to Spurs, that insistence that he is more motivated than ever to win silverware, a reaffirming of his standing at Chelsea.</p><p>\"I thank them,\" he said to those who had so welcomed him back home. \"I didn't on the pitch, I was focused on the game but you have the sound. When I'm in London, I meet them every day. I know there is going to be relation forever. </p><p>\"Hopefully I come here with my grandkids in 20 years. They belong to my history. I belong to their history.\"</p>\n<p>That is it though, isn't it? It's all history now. Mourinho might say, \"I don't feed myself with memories, I feed myself with victories and results,\" but he has long since lost the teeth and claws to take down the biggest prey. </p><p>The days when he was one of the big beasts ended when he left Tottenham, if not before. But in drifting first to Italy, then Turkey and now back to where it all began, the decline could go unconfronted. Not tonight. This was a night to celebrate what he once was. What he might yet be scarcely feels relevant on Champions League nights.</p>\n            </div>"

    "body": "<div>\n        <p>This isn't last season's <span>Liverpool</span>. That much was clear, seeing a starting lineup with <span>Jeremie Frimpong</span> starting on the wing instead of <span>Mohamed Salah</span>. It became even clearer with <span>Galatasaray</span> defeating the Reds 1-0 on Wednesday at the cauldron that is Rams Park in Istanbul. </p><p>Rotation is necessary for balancing a squad that has to face <span>Chelsea</span> during the weekend, but when Frimpong was purchased to replace <span>Trent Alexander-Arnold</span>, <span>Dominik Szoboszlai</span> starting at right back says plenty about how much work that coach Arne Slot has to get this squad back to the level of the one that won the Premier League title last season. The Reds have struggled, now losing two games straight, but the signs were there when they needed 90th-minute winners to pull out previous matches. Former Liverpool player and current CBS Sports analyst <span>Jamie Carragher</span> isn't impressed by what he's seeing from the Reds.</p><p>\"It's concerning, but the last two games aren't just concerning. I think Liverpool's full nine games this season have been very concerning. I was worried about Liverpool very early on, and I expressed that to the manager on the side of the pitch against Bournemouth on the first league game, the one that Liverpool ended up winning 4-2,\" Carragher said.</p><p>\"I don't feel like I'm watching a top team. Liverpool aren't playing football at the moment, they're playing basketball, it's end to end, and I don't think top teams play like that.\"</p>\n<p>Some losses that Liverpool suffered, like <span>Jarell Quansah</span> going to <span>Bayer Leverkusen</span> to be a starter, are things that will happen to a top team. Leverkusen could offer the young defender a starting role that Liverpool couldn't, but it's not a sale that looks great right now, as <span>Ibrahima Konate</span> is struggling in the center of the defense. Szoboszlai, playing out of position, also gave away the penalty that <span>Victor Osimhen</span> buried to give Galatasaray the win.</p><p>Unlike other matches, Liverpool weren't able to find a way back, only putting four shots on goal and struggling to generate chances from good areas. For a team with <span>Florian Wirtz</span>, Salah, <span>Hugo Ekitike</span>, and <span>Alexander Isak</span>, that shouldn't be the case.</p><p>\"They haven't gained anything going forward, but they've lost a lot defensively. I think for the manager, last season was such a smooth ride for them, and he'd now got to really earn his money. He did last season, he won the Premier League, which is unbelievable, but he's got a few problems that he's got to fix, and I'll be interested to see how he goes about it because he spent a lot of money on certain players, and right now, I don't think that the balance of the team is quite right,\" Carragher continued.</p>\n<p>\"The obvious problem that stands out is Florian Wirtz. He's just not at the races at all, he's a young boy going to a new league, he's got plenty of time to grow as a Liverpool plater but right now, I think he needs to come out of the team for Liverpool to get back to where they were last season and then go from there to try and build some confidence and defensive stability.\"</p><p>Against Galatasaray, Wirtz had his chances, but he's been asked to play a different role with Liverpool than the one that he had with Leverkusen last season. With the German side, Wirtz was the focus of things, taking 78 touches per 90 minutes, which he used to generate 0.31 expected assists and 0.36 expected goals per 90 while taking close to three shots per game. With Liverpool, that number of touches has dropped to 60. His chance creation is similar with a 0.29 xA per 90 minutes, but the shooting numbers have decreased with Wirtz taking almost half as many shots and only generating a 0.19 xG per 90.</p><p>Moving to the Premier League and to a team with Salah as the focus of the attack, some of this is expected when looking to adjust, but it's hurting the balance of the squad. Year one was expected to be tougher than it was for Slot, replacing a club legend in Jurgen Klopp, but he also inherited a team that was ready to win. It took 27 matches in all competitions for Slot to pick up his second loss last season. This season, it has only taken nine matches to reach that mark. There's leading a charmed life, and there's coasting to the Premier League title ahead of the new year.</p>\n<p>Four players who started against Galatasaray weren't with the club last season, and they'll be expected to have critical roles moving forward. Given the financial commitments made to members of the squad, Slot will need to figure out how to get the best out of the them but time isn't on his side. The Reds are still atop the Premier League by two points over <span>Arsenal</span>, but as a clash with Chelsea looms over the weekend, the Gunners could end up leading the league by the international break. Arsenal knows their identity and game plan under Mikel Arteta, and while Liverpool knew theirs under Slot last season, they need to regain it this season.</p><p>Let's take a look at how that can happen:</p><h2>Move Szoboszlai back to midfield </h2><p>Much of Liverpool's success has been built upon the duo of Alexis Mac Allister and Szoboszlai pushing teams. Both have high defensive work rates, but also have the eye for passes to get their teammates involved in the attack too. It was a great balance that made Liverpool tough to play against. Mac Allister has missed time with injuries, while Szoboszlai has spent time as an emergency right back, but with <span>Conor Bradley</span> back, there is someone who can start when called upon. <span>Curtis Jones</span> and Ryan Gravenberch haven't had the same two way ability in midfield, while Wirtz has struggled as well. Everything begins at the beginning of the engine room, and turning back the clock on Liverpool's seems like the best option at this stage.</p><h2>Find a consistent role for Frimpong </h2><p>One of the key purchases for Liverpool this summer, Frimpong has allowed too much to come by him, playing in a back four. With Leverkusen, he was used as a wing back, but since Liverpool have rarely utilized three center backs in defense, the Dutchman hasn't been able to get up the pitch like he can. Starting Frimpong on the wing shows that Slot values what he can bring to the attack and is willing to move him around. Of course, this is a role that is generally occupied by Salah in matches, so it's hard to tell how often Frimpong can actually deputize there, but the best way to find a solution is by acknowledging that there is an issue. Next, it's up to Slot to determine where exactly Frimpong fits in.</p>\n<h2>Is Gravenberch a center back?</h2><p>With the season over for young defender <span>Giovanni Leoni</span>, Liverpool's defensive corps couldn't be much thinner. Virgil van Dijk, <span>Joe Gomez</span>, and Konate are the only natural center backs in the squad. <span>Wataru Endo</span> has played there, as has <span>Stefan Bajcetic</span>, who is currently injured, leaving Slot without many choices on how to rotate. Positional flexibility has been a hallmark of this team, which is why it could be a good chance to take a look deeper down the roster to figure out a defensive solution. Konate has struggled, and at times when Liverpool utilizes a back three, Gravenberch has dropped deeper to take up defensive roles. It's not something that he's done in a back four, but it could be worth seeing if something is there since new bodies can't be added to the squad before January.</p>\n            </div>"

Had the Yanks prevailed in the division, then they would've enjoyed a first-round bye. Instead, they'll face the dangerous Red Sox in an already dangerous best-of-three series. Last year, the Yankees barged to the pennant before falling to the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/teams/LAD/los-angeles-dodgers/\">Dodgers</a> in the World Series in five games.

Anthony was perhaps Boston's best player starting with his June call-up, but an oblique injury suffered in early September will keep him out for at least this opening round. In more general terms, the Red Sox are hoping regular-season trends hold. That's because they won nine of 13 head-to-head games against the Yankees and outscored them by a margin of 66-51.

    "body": "<div>\n        <p><span>MILAN -- </span>There was a different feeling in Milan as the Champions League match between Inter and Slavia Prague took place the same day the city council approved <span><a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/soccer/news/milan-city-council-officially-approve-sale-of-san-siro-to-inter-ac-milan-paving-way-for-new-stadium/\" target=\"_blank\">the sale of San Siro</a></span>, the historical stadium set to be demolished and replaced by a new venue in the coming years. While every single fan expressed their opinion arriving or leaving the stadium, Inter won 3-0 the opening home game of the league phase, starting off well after winning against Ajax in the opening game and especially after the big disappointment of the UEFA Champions League final lost 5-0 to PSG of the past season. </p><p>The Nerazzurri faced a big change in the summer as former manager Simone Inzaghi left the club and joined Al-Hilal ahead of the Club World Cup, and 2010 Champions League winner and former Parma head coach Cristian Chivu was appointed to replace the Italian manager. </p><p>From earlier on in the season, there was a different feeling about this Inter Milan, too. Despite doubts about his little coaching experience, Chivu is immediately proving to be a coach capable of making the right decisions. </p><a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/soccer/news/milan-city-council-officially-approve-sale-of-san-siro-to-inter-ac-milan-paving-way-for-new-stadium/\" target=\"_blank\">\n        <div>\n            <div>\n                <p>Milan City Council officially approve sale of San Siro to Inter, AC Milan, paving way for new stadium</p>\n                <p>\n                    Francesco Porzio                </p>\n            </div>\n                            <div>\n    <figure><img alt=\"Milan City Council officially approve sale of San Siro to Inter, AC Milan, paving way for new stadium\" src=\"https://sportshub.cbsistatic.com/i/r/2025/09/30/b0b1b409-f8f0-439e-9e88-ff1775a7a03d/thumbnail/270x152/a3c3cb93bcb0b6fd2253a7ad3910dc68/untitled-design-2025-09-30t145950-161.png\" /></figure>\n                </div>\n                    </div>\n    </a>\n<p>Last season, when the new format of the European tournament kicked off, Inzaghi decided to rotate drastically his players between the Italian Serie A and the Champions League. It seemed he wanted to have a specific team playing the league phase games and another one for the Serie A matches. For example, players like striker Mehdi Taremi and midfielder Piotr Zielinski played most of the European games as starters as well, but then barely played in the league. This season, it looks like Chivu is making different decisions, as he did against Slavia Prague, but following the same concept. </p>\n<p>Chivu opted for a different approach and made some changes from the lineup that started against Cagliari on Saturday. Despite making seven changes compared to the starting lineup of Saturday, Chivu is not choosing players specifically for the European tournament, as five of the 11 players that started the match on Tuesday at San Siro are different from the ones that played at the Amsterdam ArenA against Ajax. While players like Yann Sommer, Federico Dimarco, Marcus Thuram and Denzel Dumfries are in both teams, and Lautaro Martinez was affected by a minor injury in the away match against Ajax, Chivu's selections are moved by the form of his squad week after week. For this reason, we are likely to see ever more changes this weekend when the Nerazzurri will meet Cremonese at San Siro. </p><p>\"There were only 72 hours between one match and the next, and because I wanted to give a chance to some players who had been playing less, while still keeping the team compact and of quality,\" Chivu told Sky Italia. \"I'm happy I was able to give a few minutes to Yann] Bisseck and Zielinski and let some others rest. I also have to consider that some players will go to their national teams and play another two matches.\"</p>\n<p>One thing is clear -- Chivu can make these kind of decisions against teams like Ajax and Slavia Prague, but it's extremely unlikely he will use the same parameters when Inter will face <span>Arsenal</span>, Atletico Madrid and <span>Liverpool</span> later in the league phase. Inter are hoping to arrive playing those matches with the full points as they will meet  <span>Union Saint-Gilloise</span> away and <span>Kairat</span> at San Siro before then. If Chivu can rotate the players in the right way between the league and the Champions League and still perform as they are doing against the smaller teams, Inter can be considered contenders once again.</p>\n            </div>"

    "body": "<div>\n        <p>Steve Kerr is set to enter the final year of his contract with the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nba/teams/GS/golden-state-warriors/\">Golden State Warriors</a> when the 2025-26 season gets underway, and neither he nor the team are in any rush to discuss a new deal. Kerr said after the Warriors' first day of training camp that he does not anticipate holding contract negotiations during the season and rather that he and the front office plan to meet next spring or summer to map out their future together.</p><p>This is the second year of a two-year, $35 million deal Kerr signed in February 2024. The extension made him the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nba/news/steve-kerr-contract-warriors-coach-reportedly-becomes-highest-paid-in-nba-with-35m-extension/\">highest-paid coach in NBA history</a> with his annual salary of $17.5 million.</p><p>\"I'm very comfortable just going into the season with a year left,\" <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KFC8wjB-X0E\">Kerr said</a>. \"I'm so aligned with Mike and Joe that we talked about this. There's no reason for discussion, concern. This is kind of a point in our relationship where it's like, let's just see how it is at the end of the year.\"</p><p>Kerr arguably earned every penny of his last extension as a four-time <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://cbssports.com/nba/\">NBA</a> champion and one of the most highly regarded coaches in league history. His runs to six NBA Finals appearances and the record-breaking 73-win season in 2015-16 headline a remarkable career that dates back to 2014.</p><p>\"I love my job,\" Kerr said. \"I love what I'm doing every day. I can't wait to get to the building. Hopefully I'm here for another few years, but I think it makes sense for the organization and for me just to see where this thing is at the end of the year, where they are, where I am. Hopefully that means we run it back, we keep going with this group. That would be awesome. But I like the fact that we can just kind of do it how we want to do it.\"</p>\n<p>The Warriors had a mostly quiet offseason as they re-signed all of their free agents save for <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nba/players/2152976/kevon-looney/\">Kevon Looney</a> and traded only draft picks.

The Wings went 10-34 in Koclanes' lone season in charge, losing 10 of their first 11 games and then losing 10 of their <em>final</em> 11 games. </p><p>The Wings tied with the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/wnba/teams/CHI/chicago-sky/\">Chicago Sky</a> for the worst record in the WNBA, and Dallas allowed the second-most points per game (88.0) in the league, only ahead of the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/wnba/teams/LAS/los-angeles-sparks/\">Sparks</a>. Dallas missed the postseason for the second straight season and will now be looking for its third coach since 2020.

Instead, the Wings got off to a slow start, and Bueckers' concussion didn't help. When the team got healthier, it showed signs of progress, including a 5-2 stretch from mid-June through early July. Ultimately, though, the team did not meld as envisioned.

Yes finally.           </p><p>The values assigned to the players below reflect a long-term measurement of their Fantasy value. Values are determined by expected future performance, future schedule, and, most importantly, public sentiment. <strong>Past performance isn't a major factor in the Trade Chart. </strong>          </p><p>By adding two players' values, you could determine what one player you should be able to get in return. However, <strong>Fantasy managers should take off 10% of the value in any trade where one side has <em>two or more</em> players than the other</strong>. Also, a handful of others only carry legitimate value in two-QB or full-PPR leagues (and thus have no value listed in one-QB or non-PPR leagues).          </p>\n<p>This list also works as a \"rest of season\" rankings for the 2025 season.           </p><p>Finally, any player not on the chart should be considered valued at no more than four points. If you want to dive deeper before sending out or replying to trade offers, be sure to find my <a href=\"https://www.sportsline.com/all/articles/?authorId=3828\" target=\"_blank\">updated projected rest of season schedule rankings</a> available on SportsLine later this week.               </p>\n<p>You can reach out with any questions, disagreements, or reports of trades from your leagues to Dave Richard at <strong>drichard@cbs.com</strong> or at <a href=\"https://twitter.com/daverichard\" target=\"_blank\">@daverichard on X</a>.                        </p><h3>          Running back          </h3><table><tbody><tr><td>B.

    "body": "<div>\n        <p><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/teams/OREGST/oregon-state-beavers/\">Oregon State</a> is in the throes of a winless season, off to an 0-5 start for the first time since 1996. It is a low point for a program that has been through the ringer over the last two years. The Beavers looked rudderless across their first five games with costly special teams gaffes aplenty and an offense unable to pull its feet out of the mud. Despite all the turmoil, second-year coach Trent Bray likely still has some runway ahead of him.</p><p>This season's failures have been in the making for some time. It was just two seasons ago that Oregon State was a born-again Pac-12 contender and mainstay in the national rankings, a status it held for much of the 21st century before a period of dormancy. But then 10 schools left the Pac-12, leaving the Beavers and <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/teams/WASHST/washington-state-cougars/\">Washington State</a> in the dust. Jonathan Smith left his post atop the program to take the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/teams/MICHST/michigan-state-spartans/\">Michigan State</a> job. The transfer portal gutted the roster of its best players, including promising QB Aidan Chiles, who followed Smith to East Lansing. </p><p>Bray, an institution in Corvallis as a former star linebacker and longtime standout assistant coach, stepped up when Oregon State needed stability. His rise to the head coaching role sparked enthusiasm because of his track record as a winner, contagious energy and passion for his alma mater.</p><p>Things haven't panned out. The Beavers fell short of expectations in Bray's five-win debut season, and barring a sharp turnaround, Year 2 is on pace to be a campaign of further regression.</p>\n<p>Whether the Beavers should move on from Bray and whether they will are two different questions. A downtrodden program seeking to find its footing in the new <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://cbssports.com/college-football/\">college football</a> landscape has to have the right leader in place, and nothing the Oregon State staff showed over its first year and a half together suggested it is fit for the job. This school is historically patient, though, and Bray likely has a longer leash than his staffers given what he means to Oregon State.</p><h2>What could happen</h2><p>The chances Oregon State fires Bray are probably slimmer than one would think. The program has long been a subscriber to the \"success is not always linear\" theory, and in many instances, it paid off. Remember, Smith posted three consecutive losing seasons to open his tenure and needed until Year 5 for a full breakthrough. The Beavers stuck with <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/players/28920388/mike-riley/\">Mike Riley</a> through a few valleys in order to get back to his numerous peaks.</p><p>Truth be told, this simply is not a program that typically fires football coaches. It has had some good ones over the years, and maybe Bray is not one of them. But you'd have to go back to 1984 to find the last time Oregon State blatantly told a coach to pack his bags.</p>\n<h3>Oregon State coaches since 1980</h3><table><tbody><tr><th>Coach</th><th>Tenure</th><th>Result</th></tr><tr><td><strong>Trent Bray</strong></td><td><strong>2024-Present</strong></td><td><strong>TBD</strong></td></tr><tr><td><p>Jonathan Smith</p></td><td><p>2018-23</p></td><td><p>Left for Michigan State</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Gary Andersen</p></td><td><p>2015-17</p></td><td><p>Waived contract</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Mike Riley</p></td><td><p>2003-14</p></td><td><p>Left for <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/teams/NEB/nebraska-cornhuskers/\">Nebraska</a></p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Dennis Erickson</p></td><td><p>1999-2002</p></td><td><p>Left for <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://cbssports.com/nfl/\">NFL</a></p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Mike Riley</p></td><td><p>1997-98</p></td><td><p>Left for NFL</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Jerry Pettibone</p></td><td><p>1991-96</p></td><td><p>Resigned and retired</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Dave Kragthorpe</p></td><td><p>1985-90</p></td><td><p>Mutually parted ways</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Joe Avezzano</p></td><td><p>1980-84</p></td><td><p>Fired</p></td></tr></tbody></table><p>Instead of firing Bray, the first step toward rebuilding the Beavers into a competitive squad would be to make changes further down the staff. Offensive coordinator Ryan Gunderson and special teams coordinator Jamie Christian are on thin ice after their groups appeared hapless for much of the 0-5 start.</p><p>Christian's situation is the most dire. With long snapper <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/players/3129244/dylan-black/\">Dylan Black</a> injured, special teams errors in his absence have been the difference in two games: losses to <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/teams/FRESNO/fresno-state-bulldogs/\">Fresno State</a> and <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/teams/HOU/houston-cougars/\">Houston</a>. Poor snaps cost the Beavers on extra points, field goals and punts against the Bulldogs, and twice against the Cougars they had field goal attempts blocked -- including on what would have been a game-winning kick.</p><p>Gunderson is under the microscope, too. Despite the Beavers investing more than $1 million in quarterback <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/players/28873707/maalik-murphy/\">Maalik Murphy</a>, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/news/highest-paid-player-in-college-football-history-transfer-qb-darian-mensahs-duke-deal-is-sign-of-times/\">who was reportedly forced out</a> of <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/teams/DUKE/duke-blue-devils/\">Duke</a> after a historically successful season with the Blue Devils, they have yet to score more than 27 points in a game. A rushing attack that was supposed to be this offense's bread and butter has not panned out, either, ranking 127th nationally at 93.8 yards per contest.</p><h2>What should happen</h2><p>Oregon State has been forced into myriad tough decisions over the last two years because of realities largely out of its own control. When it comes to football leadership, however, the Beavers finally have a say in the direction of their program. They have the resources to perennially contend for Pac-12 titles in the rebuilt conference if they put the right people in charge. As unlikely as it may be for them to fire more than a couple of coordinators, they may have to include their head coach in that leadership change to ensure they enter the new-look Pac-12 next season with a shot at winning over the long haul.</p><p>If athletic director Scott Barnes -- who has taken much flak from the fanbase himself throughout the university's tumult -- cannot bring himself to fire Bray, the second-year coach could do what many of his predecessors did before him. Step down.</p><p>Bray went on the record during his run as Oregon State's defensive coordinator saying that he did not have head coaching ambitions. Ahead of this season, he retook control of defensive playcalling duties and noted that he missed that side of coaching. Bray calls defenses and coaches linebackers with the absolute best of them and built a long career across multiple power conference schools doing just that. Perhaps he should return to that role and allow a more seasoned coach to run the CEO job.</p><p>Oregon State has already fallen from power conference contender to Group of Six also-ran, and to be blunt, it cannot afford to sink further with the wrong coach at the helm. Bray could still be that guy, and the Beavers will give him a chance to prove it. But if it becomes any more clear that the issue starts with him and not his coordinators, he or Barnes have to pull the plug.</p>\n            </div>"

They had a 2-1 series lead over the rival <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/teams/LAD/los-angeles-dodgers/\">Los Angeles Dodgers</a> in last year's NLDS, but did not score another run in the series, and were eliminated.

    "body": "<div>\n        <p><span>CHICAGO –</span> It's probably too much to say that the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/teams/CHC/chicago-cubs/\">Chicago Cubs</a>' bullpen has been maligned this season, but there's no doubt their recent level of performance constitutes an improvement over 2025 taken in bulk. That was acutely obvious during the Cubs' 3-1 win (<a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/gametracker/recap/MLB_20250930_SD@CHC/\" target=\"_blank\">box score</a>) over the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/teams/SD/san-diego-padres/\">San Diego Padres</a> in Tuesday's National League Wild Card Series opener. </p><p>The first tell that the Cubs' bullpen is now a weapon rather than a shortcoming came in the top of the fifth. Chicago starter <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/players/2173411/matthew-boyd/\">Matthew Boyd</a> had just faced his 18th batter of the game and yielded a single, which meant he was about to get into the Padres' lineup for the third time in the game. Managers in the playoffs who have a strong and deep relief corps are typically loath to allow their non-ace starting pitchers to face the opposing lineup for a third time. But would Counsell do the same? He would because his bullpen is different now. </p><p>With one on and one out, Counsell summoned <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/players/28837106/daniel-palencia/\">Daniel Palencia</a>, the right-hander with a big fastball who returned from a shoulder injury in time to make a pair of appearances in the final days of the regular season. It was the earliest Palencia had entered a game in almost exactly two years. It was also the first time he'd been called upon with traffic on the bases since before the All-Star break. With much improved control this season, Palencia has earned Counsell's trust, and he was trusted in a major way on Tuesday at Wrigley Field. The 25-year-old right-hander got <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/players/2507363/fernando-tatis-jr/\">Fernando Tatis Jr</a>. and <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/players/2821318/luis-arraez/\">Luis Arraez</a> to line out and keep the score 1-0. The next half-inning, the Cubs would take the lead for good on a pair of solo home runs.</p><a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/news/mlb-playoff-bracket-schedule-2025/\" target=\"_blank\">\n        <div>\n            <div>\n                <p>2025 MLB playoff bracket: Schedule, scores for Yankees vs. Red Sox, Cubs vs. Padres, more as postseason begins</p>\n                <p>\n                    Kate Feldman                </p>\n            </div>\n                            <div>\n    <figure><img alt=\"2025 MLB playoff bracket: Schedule, scores for Yankees vs. Red Sox, Cubs vs. Padres, more as postseason begins\" src=\"https://sportshub.cbsistatic.com/i/r/2025/09/29/83cd6b91-d783-48d2-b0e4-6742d0ed7a15/thumbnail/270x152/f6290680ccaa9feb6554ee8c4554a2ef/2025-mlb-bracket-final.jpg\" /></figure>\n                </div>\n                    </div>\n    </a>\n<p>\"Yeah, I think to me, that's the outing of the game that was critical,\" Counsell said after the game of Palencia's outing. \"You need outs from your starters in these games. You can't do that every day. But him throwing up five outs in five hitters and going through the top of their lineup, the game made sense after that to me; know what I mean? There was a real path right there.\"</p>\n<p>There was indeed a path. Palencia worked the sixth, picked up a pair of strikeouts, and registered his longest relief appearance since April. Then came venerable lefty <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/players/1765810/drew-pomeranz/\">Drew Pomeranz</a>, 11 years Palencia's senior, to face the three left-handed bats that Padres manager Mike Shildt had positioned all in a row in his lineup. Pomeranz retired them in order on 11 pitches. Then came <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/players/2228478/andrew-kittredge/\">Andrew Kittredge</a>, the right-handed deadline pickup who's swapped out some four-seamers for sinkers since being acquired from Baltimore and reached a higher plane. He worked a perfect frame with a strikeout and roughly an hour later was announced as Counsell's opener for Wednesday's Game 2. </p><p>Finally, it was <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/players/2823660/brad-keller/\">Brad Keller</a> to earn his first postseason save, which he did in spotless fashion. In all, the Cubs bullpen retired all 14 batters it faced in Game 1. </p><p>\"I've talked a lot about, you know, them helping each other and how that group has connected, and today was a great example of it,\" Counsell said after the game. \"You know, they get their outs, and they make their matchups the right matchups. And so just a brilliant job. Everybody made pitches, executed pitches. I can't say enough about what they did today.\"</p>\n<p>This was to be a Padres advantage coming into the series and, to be fair, it may yet still turn out that way. The Padres, of course, added at the deadline an elite high-leverage arm in <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/players/26911802/mason-miller/\">Mason Miller</a> to what was already an enviable crop of relievers. The Cubs, though, are not to be dismissed on this front, especially with Counsell now being able to lean into his strengths as a tactician. Just two relievers who date back to the Cubs' Opening Day roster -- Keller and <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/players/1961735/caleb-thielbar/\">Caleb Thielbar</a> -- are among the group now at the manager's disposal. Kittredge, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/players/2164751/taylor-rogers/\">Taylor Rogers</a>, and Michael Soroka came over leading up to the trade deadline. <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/players/2507332/aaron-civale/\">Aaron Civale</a>, claimed off waivers from the crosstown <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/teams/CHW/chicago-white-sox/\">White Sox</a>, has looked like a weapon since being converted to relief detail. </p><p>Specific to October, Counsell said this pre-game on Tuesday: \"I think you see both teams have starters that are active on the roster and may not start games. But we'll use Colin to get outs. At some point he will factor in, quite possibly in an important situation.\"</p><p>That would be tenured right-hander <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/players/2170141/colin-rea/\">Colin Rea</a>, who made 27 starts for the Cubs during the regular season and will work as a multi-inning volume reliever for them in October. That's another point of distinction when it comes to the Chicago bullpen as it exists in this moment in time. </p>\n<p>When it comes to playoff baseball, you don't want a bullpen with strikeout deficits. For a long time this season, the Cubs had such a thing, but the pen has been heavily remade to address, it seems, that very liability. If Game 1 and the month of September at large are reliable guides, then the Cubs are poised to suffocate the opposition when Counsell takes the ball from their starter.</p>\n            </div>"

Coincidentally, the Eagles' upcoming Week 5 opponent played a key role in protecting it. <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/DEN/denver-broncos/\">Denver Broncos</a> coach Sean Payton said he stood up in defense of the Tush Push during the league's offseason debate, and he must now game plan for it as he gears up to face the undefeated Eagles.</p><p>The NFL needed 24 of its owners to vote to ban the Tush Push in order for the play to be outlawed. Only 22 voted for the ban, keeping it alive for the 2025 campaign. It has been under the league's watchful eye, though, and the NFL <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/news/nfl-instructs-refs-to-keep-eagle-eye-on-tush-push-qb-sneaks-after-controversial-week-2/\">reminded its officials after Week 2</a> that players need to be aligned legally before the snap on that play and other variants of the quarterback sneak.</p><p>\"I was one that stood up in favor of it,\" <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-7rt9Cl4P4\">Payton said Tuesday</a>. \"The reason I stood up in favor of it is pretty simple. If the powers to be don't want it for aesthetic reasons or competitive reasons or it's hard to officiate, et cetera. But I've been involved in those meetings for a long time, and when all of the sudden health and safety was pulled into that -- which might be the safest play in football -- my bullshit nose kind of went up. Look, it's a quarterback sneak.\"</p><p>The Tush Push is a staple of the Philadelphia offense and makes near-weekly appearances in short-yardage situations, especially close to the goal line. It has been a source of discussion multiple times already this year.</p>\n<p>Even after the league placed an emphasis on pre-snap monitoring, the Eagles <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/news/eagles-appear-to-get-away-with-false-start-on-tush-push-against-los-angeles-rams/\">appeared to get away with a false start</a> the following week on one of their Tush Push reps. That was after two offensive linemen seemed to get a head start on a snap a week prior.</p><p>\"Credit Philadelphia,\" said Payton. \"They scored a touchdown last week. Take a peek at this past week's touchdown off the tush push look, and it was a sweep to the left. I'm one that looks at it -- as long as the line of scrimmage is clean, that it's a well-run quarterback sneak. When you really evaluate it, it's more the technique of the sneak than the push.</p><p>\"You go all the way back to Green Bay against Dallas in the Ice Bowl and freaking Bart Starr crosses the goal line with someone pushing a little bit behind him,\" he continued. \"I was one that was in favor of leaving it alone on Philly's side.\"</p>\n<p>Entering this season, the Eagles called quarterback sneaks 92 times since the 2022 campaign, significantly more than the three next-highest team totals combined.</p>\n            </div>"

    "body": "<div>\n        <p>The <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/wnba/teams/MIN/minnesota-lynx/\">Minnesota Lynx</a> spent the entire 2025 WNBA regular season as the league's most dominant team, but suffered a shocking semifinals loss to the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/wnba/teams/PHO/phoenix-mercury/\">Phoenix Mercury</a> to end their bid for another championship earlier than expected. </p><p>That series ended with star forward <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/wnba/players/26677824/napheesa-collier/\">Napheesa Collier</a> injured and in a walking boot after suffering an ankle injury late in Game 4 on a controversial no-call that sent Lynx coach Cheryl Reeve into a tirade on the sidelines. On Tuesday, Collier met with the media for her post-season exit interview and opened with a lengthy, four-minute statement in which she went scorched earth on WNBA commissioner Cathy Engelbert over a number of issues from CBA negotiations to officiating problems. </p><p>In the statement, which you can read in full below, Coller said the WNBA has \"the worst leadership in the world.\" She also brought out receipts from a conversation she had with Engelbert in February, in which the commissioner told her that <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/wnba/players/29362921/caitlin-clark/\">Caitlin Clark</a> \"should be grateful\" to the WNBA for her endorsement deals and that players should be \"on their knees\" thanking her for the new media rights deal.</p><blockquote><p>\"First of all, I'd like to congratulate the Mercury for advancing to the Finals. I want to be clear this conversation is not about winning or losing, it's about something much bigger. The real threat to our league isn't money, it isn't ratings or even missed calls or even physical play. It's the lack of accountability from the league office. Since I've been in the league, you've heard the constant concerns about officiating and it has now reached levels of inconsistency that plague our sport and undermine the integrity with which it operates. </p><p>Whether the league cares about the health of the players is one thing, but to also not care about the product we put on the floor is truly self-sabotage. Year after year, the only thing that remains consistent is the lack of accountability from our leaders. The league has a buzzword that they rolled out as a talking point for the CBA as to why they can't pay the players what we're worth; that word is sustainability. But what's truly unsustainable is keeping a good product on the floor while allowing officials to lose control of games. Fans see it every night. Coaches, both winning and losing, point it out every night in pre- and post-game media. And leadership just issues fines and looks the other way. They ignore the issues that everyone inside the game is begging them to fix. That is negligence. </p><p>At Unrivaled this past February, I sat across from Cathy and asked how she planned to address the officiating issues in our league. Her response was, 'Well, only the losers complain about the refs.' I also asked how she planned to fix the fact that players like Caitlin, Angel and Paige, who are clearly driving massive revenue for the league, are making so little for their first four years. Her response was, 'Caitlin should be grateful she makes $60 million off the court because without the platform the WNBA gives her, she wouldn't make anything.'</p><p>In that same conversation, she told me 'players should be on their knees thanking their lucky stars for the media rights deal that I got them.' That's the mentality driving our league from the top. We go to battle every day to protect a shield that doesn't value us. The league believes it succeeds despite its players, not because of them. </p><p>I have the privilege of watching my husband run a league where he has to balance 100 different things at once. I won't pretend the job is easy, but even with all of that on his plate, he always reaches out to players when he sees an injury, whether it's Unrivaled or even during the WNBA season. That is what leadership looks like. It's the human element, it's basic integrity, and it's the bare minimum any leader should embody. But do you know who I haven't heard from? Cathy. Not one call, not one text. Instead the only outreach has come from her No. 2 telling my agent that she doesn't believe physical play is contributing to injuries. </p><p>That is infuriating. And it's the perfect example of the tone deaf, dismissive approach that our leaders always seem to take. I've finally grown tired. For too long, I've tried to have these conversations in private, but it's clear there's no intention of accepting there's a problem. The league has made it clear it isn't about innovation, it isn't about collaboration, it's about control and power. I've earned this platform and I paid the price to get here, and now I have a responsibility to speak on behalf of the fans and everyone in this league that deserves better. </p><p>Our leadership's answer to being held accountable is to suppress everyone's voices by handing out fines. I'm not concerned about a fine. I'm concerned about the future of our sport. At some point, everyone deserves to hear the truth from someone who I hope has earned the benefit of the doubt to fight for what is right and fair for our athletes and our fans. We have the best players in the world. We have the best fans in the world. But right now we have the worst leadership in the world.</p><p>If I didn't know exactly what the job entailed, maybe I wouldn't feel this way, but unfortunately for them, I do. We serve a league that has shown they think championship coaches and Hall of Fame players are dispensible, and that's fine, it's professional sports. But I will not stand quietly by and allow different standards to be applied at the league level.\" </p></blockquote><p>Hours after Collier's comments, Engelbert responded with a statement of her own, explaining how she was \"disheartened\" by what she heard. </p><p>\"I have the utmost respect for Napheesa Collier and for all the players in the WNBA,\" <a href=\"https://x.com/Rachel__Nichols/status/1973113802301362459\" target=\"_blank\">Engelbert said</a>. \"Together we have all worked tirelessly to transform this league. My focus remains on ensuring a bright future for the players and the WNBA, including collaborating on how we continue to elevate the game. I am disheartened by how Napheesa characterized our conversation and league leadership, but even when our perspectives differ, my commitment to the players and to this work will never waver.\" </p>\n<p>The frustration Collier and other players have had with Engelbert has been apparent throughout this year as players have consistently called out the league for not engaging in good faith CBA negotiations. This statement seemed to be a rallying cry from Collier, both to the rest of the players and to fans to push back strongly together against leadership that she feels is actively antagonistic toward the players. </p><p>The anecdote about Clark, in particular, was a savvy move from Collier given the legions of fans devoted to the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/wnba/teams/IND/indiana-fever/\">Fever</a> star who will certainly not take Engelbert's comments about how the WNBA has created Clark's popularity well. </p><p>Collier also references her experience running Unrivaled alongside her husband over the past two years, and notes how that has caused her to recognize how poor a job the WNBA's leadership does with player relations and taking concerns seriously. </p>\n<p>All of this points to the players and the WNBA being further apart than ever when it comes to the ongoing CBA negotiations, and it's hard to see how that gap gets bridged quickly. </p>\n            </div>"
