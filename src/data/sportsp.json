    "body": "<div>\n        <p>The <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/wnba/teams/IND/indiana-fever/\">Indiana Fever's</a> Cinderella run in the WNBA playoffs came to an end at the hands of the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/wnba/teams/LVA/las-vegas-aces/\">Las Vegas Aces</a> with a 107-98 overtime loss in Game 5 of the semifinals. Although their journey is over, the Fever showed a lot of heart and determination despite adversity hitting them one more time with leading scorer <span><a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/wnba/news/wnba-semifinals-indiana-fever-guard-kelsey-mitchell-left-must-win-game-5-with-lower-body-cramping/\" target=\"_blank\">Kelsey Mitchell exiting the game in the third quarter.</a></span></p><p>The Fever were not expected to go very far in the playoffs due to multiple season-ending injuries to key players, including star shooter <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/wnba/players/29362921/caitlin-clark/\">Caitlin Clark</a>. However, they defied the odds and reached the semifinals for the first time since 2015.</p><p>\"They have been an absolute joy to coach,\" said coach Stephanie White postgame. \"It's an incredible group of women, an incredibly connected group. They're a great example to everybody what it means to just put one foot in front of the other, to persevere, to welcome people into the fold, to not give in to circumstance, to lead with grace and dignity, to sacrifice for a greater good and a common good. I'm just I'm so thankful to coach these women, and I'm just thankful for this experience with them.\"</p>\n<p>With so many setbacks, the spark had to come from multiple players at different moments of the season. <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/wnba/players/2130788/odyssey-sims/\">Odyssey Sims</a> showed her veteran experience on Tuesday with a 27-point performance. Five other Indiana players scored in double figures, including <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/wnba/players/29101293/aliyah-boston/\">Aliyah Boston</a>, who completed a double-double with 11 points and 16 rebounds, and <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/wnba/players/26677779/shey-peddy/\">Shey Peddy</a>, who scored seven of her 13 points off the bench in the third quarter.</p>\n<p>Mitchell left the game midway through the third quarter after she went down with what coach Stephanie White described as lower body cramping. At the time of the incident, the Fever were down 55-59. White gave her team a speech in the huddle about how they needed to stay locked in and fight for her, just like they have done for other teammates who suffered injuries this season. </p><p>The message was received and the team very much looked like they were ready to pull off the upset.</p><p>With 52 seconds remaining, Sims tied the game 84-84 on the free throw line. She then locked down on defense and stopped <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/wnba/players/26678025/jackie-young/\">Jackie Young</a> from scoring in the next possession. </p>\n<p>Things got even more difficult for the Fever when Aliyah Boston received her sixth foul with 26.4 seconds remaining in regulation, which took her out of the game and awarded Young two free throws. However, Sims remained locked in and came in clutch with a floating jump shot to even the score once more.</p>\n<p>Regulation saw multiple ties and lead changes, but overtime quickly became one-sided with <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/wnba/players/26677818/chelsea-gray/\">Chelsea Gray</a> making big plays for Las Vegas. By the end of the night, the Aces had too much depth for Indiana to overcome. Gray finished the night with 17 points, while <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/wnba/players/26677908/aja-wilson/\">A'ja Wilson</a> and Young became the first teammates to score over 30 points in playoffs history with 35 and 32 points, respectively.</p><p>Las Vegas coach <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/wnba/players/1105013/becky-hammon/\">Becky Hammon</a> gave credit to the Fever for their persistence and congratulated them for what they had accomplished.</p>\n<p>\"They would not go away. They just would not go away,\" Hammon said. \".... Just hats off to them. I thought they did an unbelievable job all the way around, their roster, their coaching staff. They just gas pedaled the whole time.\"</p><p>While this wasn't the desired outcome for the Fever, they still recognized they had a lot to be proud.</p><p>\"The ones who've been here from start to finish, they've had a lot of changes throughout the season, and for us to continue to fight, we never back down every game,\" Sims said. \"...Coach kept telling us we have more to give. So I'm super proud just to be a part of this group. We came a long way. We did. We beat the odds. We weren't even supposed to be here, and for us to be here, we finished out strong. It wasn't the outcome we wanted, but we still got to hold our heads high.\"</p>\n            </div>"

    "body": "<div>\n        <p>Just when you thought players on byes were all you had to worry about when making Week 5 Fantasy football picks, the injury bug struck in a big way. Malik Nabers and Tyreek Hill are done for the year, while Lamar Jackson (hamstring) will reportedly miss at least two weeks. That throws a wrench into the Fantasy football strategy for their owners, while those players on byes affects just about everyone setting Week 5 Fantasy football lineups.</p><p>With those wideout injuries, plus the likes of DK Metcalf and Rome Odunze on byes, can you continue to rely on the likes of Quentin Johnston, Tre Tucker and Michael Pittman Jr.? They are all in the top 15 of positional Fantasy football rankings, while bigger-named wideouts like Calvin Ridley, Jerry Jeudy and Cooper Kupp sit outside the top 50. With everything going on, your Fantasy football start/sit decisions will likely be tougher for Week 5 Fantasy football lineups than for any other week thus far. Before making your Week 5 Fantasy football picks, be sure to <a href=\"https://www.sportsline.com/insiders/fantasy-football-rankings-2025-nfl-week-5-projections-from-proven-model-that-outperformed-experts/#ttag=09302025_agg_cbssports_fantasy_football_nfl_model_Week5FFrankings\" target=\"_blank\">check out the Week 5 Fantasy football rankings from the proven computer model at SportsLine</a>. </p><p><em>Bet on every NFL Week 5 game at <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/betting/news/draftkings-promo-code/\">DraftKings Sportsbook</a>, where new users can target the </em><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/betting/news/draftkings-promo-code/\"><em>DraftKings promo code</em></a><em>, which offers </em><a href=\"https://martech.cbssports.com/bt/redirect/prod?b=draftkings&c=sport\" target=\"_blank\"><em>$200 in bonus bets if your $5 initial wager wins</em></a><em>:</em></p><p>When it comes to ranking players, SportsLine's model beat human experts in Fantasy football for the past several seasons, especially when there were big differences in ranking. Over the course of a season, that could literally be the difference between winning your league or going home empty-handed.</p><p>The same model has a proven track record providing Fantasy football tips, including being ahead of the curve on players like A.J. Brown, Jonathan Taylor, Derrick Henry, Christian McCaffrey, Alvin Kamara and Jahmyr Gibbs. Anybody who banked on players like those could have made a run at their league title.</p><p>Now, the model, which simulates every NFL game 10,000 times, has revealed its Fantasy football rankings for Week 5 of the 2025 NFL season. <a href=\"https://www.sportsline.com/insiders/fantasy-football-rankings-2025-nfl-week-5-projections-from-proven-model-that-outperformed-experts/#ttag=09302025_agg_cbssports_fantasy_football_nfl_model_Week5FFrankings\" target=\"_blank\">Head to SportsLine now to see them</a>. </p><p><em>New users can also check out the latest </em><span><a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/betting/news/fanduel-promo-code/\" target=\"_blank\"><em>FanDuel promo code</em></a></span><em> and </em><a href=\"https://martech.cbssports.com/bt/redirect/prod?b=fanduel&c=sport\" target=\"_blank\"><em>get $300 in bonus bets instantly at FanDuel if your $5 bet wins</em></a><em>. </em></p><h2>Top Week 5 Fantasy football picks </h2><p>One surprise in Week 5: The model is fading Eagles receiver DeVonta Smith, a two-time 1,000-yard wideout who has been a top-30 Fantasy receiver each of the last three years. Much has been made about A.J. Brown's lack of involvement in Philly's offense, but Smith has been just as much as a non-factor. He's had 60 or fewer receiving yards in every game this season and has just one touchdown. He's averaging just five targets per game and is coming off a two-catch, 29-yard performance versus Tampa.</p><p>Smith has eight fewer targets than Brown this year, and dating back to last season's playoffs, Smith hasn't reached 70 yards in eight straight games. In Week 5, he'll face a top-10 passing defense in the Broncos, who have also allowed the fewest passing touchdowns (one) in the NFL. Ja'Marr Chase and Tee Higgins combined for just 55 yards versus Denver on Monday night, and only one wideout all year has eclipsed 68 receiving yards against the Broncos. Thus, Smith may not warrant a spot in Week 5 Fantasy football lineups as he sits outside the top 30 in positional rankings.</p><p>Another curveball: The model is high on Colts quarterback Daniel Jones. The former Giant has four passing and three rushing touchdowns on the season as he enters Week 5 as the QB8 in Fantasy points. He may be even higher if Colts wideout, Adonai Mitchell, wouldn't have fumbled on the 1-yard-line on Sunday with a premature celebration, taking away another potential passing score for Jones. The quarterback is among many who have found success after leaving New York, as Jones has career highs in passer rating, yards per game and completion percentage.</p><p>The Raiders' defense awaits Indy in Week 5, and Vegas has a bottom-10 pass defense on the season. All four quarterbacks the Raiders have faced have at least 200 passing yards and a passing score, so there's a high Fantasy floor whenever playing Las Vegas. Additionally, just seven teams have allowed more rushing yards to opposing quarterbacks than Vegas, which plays into one of Jones' strengths. He checks in as a top-three Fantasy QB for Week 5, slotting ahead the likes of Patrick Mahomes and Dak Prescott.

    "body": "<div>\n<p>The promise of the new UEFA Champions League format, now in its second season, was that high-caliber matches would be scattered around the schedule from the get-go. Wednesday's clash between <span>Barcelona</span> and <span>Paris</span> Saint-Germain, then, will be a prime example of the theory in action as the title contenders face off on Matchday 2 of the league phase in a game that will serve as an early test of each side's credentials to win the whole thing.</p><p>In accordance with the occasion, the pre-match chatter has been one of mutual respect. Barcelona manager Hansi Flick described PSG as \"the best team in the world,\" the French side just a few months removed from their historic treble and a trip to the Club World Cup final. PSG's <span>Luis Enrique</span>, meanwhile, reflected on his own connection to Barcelona – he will return to the club where he spent much of his playing and managerial career, saying he's \"happy to be back,\" in a city he considers home. The PSG manager is fully aware of why many have circled this game on the league phase schedule, too.</p><p>\"For us, it's exciting and thrilling to play against a team that plays with the same mentality,\" Enrique said. \"They have a very high-level coach that I've known for a long time. Both the coach and the players are eager to play a good game.

That is especially true for PSG, who are still without <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/soccer/news/ballon-dor-results-psgs-ousmane-dembele-barcelonas-aitana-bonmati-take-home-awards-make-history/live/\">new Ballon d'Or winner Ousmane Dembele</a> as well as <span>Desire Doue</span> and <span>Marquinhos</span>. <span>Khvicha Kvaratskhelia</span> may not be available, either, making matters more challenging for the reigning European champions.</p><p>\"No matter which players are there tomorrow, they will be part of a strong team, which is what we are.\" Enrique said. \"We will prepare for the match in the same way, in the best possible way to try to win the match.\"</p><p>Flick, meanwhile, will be without <span>Fermin Lopez</span>, <span>Joan Garcia</span> and <span>Gavi</span>, each of them important players in Barcelona's attack-minded approach to the game.</p><p>\"It's part of our job: we have to know how to manage injuries,\" Flick said. \"We're missing important players in midfield, but we have to have confidence in the young players.\"</p><p>A handful of Barcelona's stars will be available for selection including Ballon d'Or runner-up <span>Lamine Yamal</span>, as well as <span>Raphinha</span> and <span>Robert Lewandowski</span>. The player of focus on Wednesday, though, just might be <span>Pedri</span>. The midfielder's profile rose after retired <span>Manchester United</span> midfielder Paul Scholes called Pedri his new favorite player following Barcelona's win at Newcastle United, with Enrique adding his own praise to the long list of compliments Pedri has earned.</p><p>\"I know Pedri well,\" Enrique said. \"He's a fantastic player. I love watching Barca, and especially a player like Pedri. He's like Harry Potter but I really hope he leaves his magic at home tomorrow. Although Barça isn't just Pedri; there are a lot of good players.\"</p><h2>Projected lineups</h2><p><strong>Barcelona:</strong> Wojciech Szczesny, Jules Kounde, Eric Garcia, Pau Cubarsi, Gerard Martin, Frenkie de Jong, Pedri, Lamine Yamal, Dani Olmo, Raphinha, Robert Lewandowski</p><p><strong>Paris Saint-Germain:</strong> Lucas Chevalier, Achraf Hakimi, Illia Zabarnyi, Willian Pacho, Nuno Mendes, Warren Zaire-Emery, Vitinha, Fabian Ruiz, Lee Kang-in, Goncalo Ramos, Bradley Barcola</p>\n            </div>"

The incident left the Fever even more shorthanded than usual and they ultimately suffered a 98-107 loss in overtime.</p><p>\"She's got a lot of lower body cramping. She's currently at the hospital right now getting fluids,\" Indiana coach Stephanie White said postgame.</p><p>Mitchell was seen reaching for her left knee with some discomfort halfway through the third quarter. Not long after, she went down and stayed on the floor for a while. Her teammates quickly surrounded her and held towels for her privacy. </p>\n<p>The medical staff brought out a stretcher, but Mitchell did not use it and walked to the locker room with assistance. As she walked out, she received supportive cheers from both teams and the crowd at Michelob Ultra Arena. At the time of her exit, the Fever were down 55-59. Mitchell had 15 points on 50% shooting, including going 3-of-3 from beyond the arc. </p>\n<p>The 29-year-old has been playing some of the best basketball of her career and was leading the Fever with 23.3 points per game during the playoffs. This is yet another tough break for the Fever, who have not been able to shake the injury bug this season. Their injury list includes Damiris Dantas (concussion), Caitlin Clark (groin), Chloe Bibby (knee), Sophine Cunningham (MCL), Sydney Colson (torn ACL) and Aari McDonald (foot).</p><p>\"We've been in this position before right?\" White told her team in the huddle. \"We gotta fight for our teammates. Tooth and nail... We fight for her right now.\"</p><p>Those words of encouragement kept her team locked in. The Fever did not give up easily and were able to force overtime despite Mitchell's absence. However, the Aces turned up the intensity in overtime to advance their third WNBA Finals in four years. </p>\n<p>Indiana Pacers star Tyrese Haliburton suffered a torn right Achilles tendon in Game 7 of the NBA Finals last year, and he was one of the first one's to send well wishes to Mitchell.</p>\n            </div>\n    </div>"

He will be the first quarterback to make his first <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://cbssports.com/nfl/\">NFL</a> start outside the United States, according to CBS Sports research.</p><p>The Browns are yet to score more than 17 points in a game this season. Out of 33 qualifying quarterbacks, Flacco ranks last in the NFL in passer rating (60.3), completion rate (58.1%) and yards per attempt (5.1), and 31st in expected points added per play (-0.31). His six interceptions are the second-most picks by a quarterback in the league. Only the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/TEN/tennessee-titans/\">Titans</a> have scored fewer points than the Browns this season.</p>\n<p>In Gabriel, the Browns are turning to a rookie, but one who has played plenty of football. Gabriel, 24, played six years in college at UCF (2019-21), Oklahoma (2022-23) and Oregon (2024). He finished third in 2024 Heisman Trophy voting and led the Ducks to the  <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://cbssports.com/college-football/\">College Football</a> Playoff's No. 1 overall seed. Gabriel's 189 touchdowns accounted for (passing, rushing and receiving) are the most in FBS history, and his 63 career starts are most by a quarterback in FBS history.</p><p>Cleveland selected Gabriel in the third round (94th overall) of the 2025 <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://cbssports.com/nfl/draft/\">NFL Draft</a> and picked Colorado star <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/26710004/shedeur-sanders/\">Shedeur Sanders</a> in the fifth round (144th overall). They joined a quarterback room that eventually swelled to five players on the active roster with Flacco, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/2804969/kenny-pickett/\">Kenny Pickett</a> and <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/3159137/tyler-huntley/\">Tyler Huntley</a>. The Browns also have <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/2133482/deshaun-watson/\">Deshaun Watson</a> on the reserve/physically unable to perform list.</p><p>As the preseason wore on, Gabriel secured his spot at Flacco's primary backup. He completed 13 of 18 passes for 143 yards and an interception in preseason Week 2 against the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/PHI/philadelphia-eagles/\">Eagles</a> and 12 of 19 passes for 129 yards and a touchdowns in preseason Week 3 against the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/LAR/los-angeles-rams/\">Rams</a>. Gabriel has also relieved Flacco at the end of two blowout losses in the regular season. He completed all three of his passes for 19 yards and a touchdown in a 41-17 Week 2 loss to the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/BAL/baltimore-ravens/\">Ravens</a> and had one incomplete pass against the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/DET/detroit-lions/\">Lions</a>.</p>\n<p>Sanders has been listed as an inactive (emergency third quarterback) in all four games this season.</p><h2>What to expect from Dillon Gabriel</h2><p>Gabriel, a lefty, has good if not great mobility for a quarterback, which will be helpful behind a Browns blocking unit that ranks 30th in Pro Football Focus' pass-blocking grades. Here are some excerpts from Chris Trapasso's <span><a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/news/dillon-gabriel-nfl-draft-2025-scouting-report-prospect-outlook-nfl-team-fits-and-more-for-oregon-qb/\" target=\"_blank\">scouting report</a></span>:</p><h3>Strengths</h3><ul><li>\"Gabriel is patient in the pocket. It's his clearest strength on film. Unlike the vast majority of quarterbacks in today's game who flee at the first indication of pressure or when their first read is covered, Gabriel will stand and scan.\"</li><li>\"When he needed to operate outside the pocket, Gabriel has proven to be capable. On those designed rollouts, he demonstrated surprising velocity while throwing on the run with quality.\"</li><li>\"Gabriel's accuracy is a plus, although I can't label him as surgical with his ball placement.\"</li></ul><h3>Weaknesses</h3><ul><li>\"Gabriel's arm is not atrocious. By NFL standards, it'll be average on a good day, and slightly below-average on a bad one. There aren't many times on film when he displayed the ability to really drive a ball through a closing window or stretch a defense vertically more than 25 yards.\"</li><li>\"When everything's operating well within structure, almost all of his passes will be on time and to the correct receiver based on where coverage dictates he should throw the ball. When that's not the case, things can get ugly.\"</li></ul><p>Expect the Browns to at least try to lean more into the run game, especially if game script allows them to. That could be the case against the Vikings' struggling offense. Plus, Minnesota ranks 22nd in yards per rush allowed (4.5). Over the past two weeks, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/28878286/quinshon-judkins/\">Quinshon Judkins</a> has averaged 19.5 carries and 88 rushing yards per game.</p>\n<p>When the Browns do go to the air, expect plenty of quick-hitting passes in an attempt to get Gabriel in a rhythm -- the types of throws he thrived on at Oregon. Judkins, running back <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/2966543/jerome-ford/\">Jerome Ford</a> and tight ends <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/2136474/david-njoku/\">David Njoku</a> and <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/28900882/harold-fannin-jr/\" target=\"_blank\">Harold Fannin Jr.</a> could be early top targets.</p><h2>What does this mean for Shedeur Sanders?</h2><p>At the least, this shows Stefanski's willingness to make a change at the game's most important position. The Browns are not going to contend for a playoff spot this year, and it makes sense for the team to see what it has behind Flacco, who is 40 years old and on a one-year deal.</p><p>That Stefanski made this move this early portends well for Sanders getting his shot at some point this season. When, exactly, that is remains TBD. The Browns will want to give Gabriel a decently long runway. They drafted him with a pick in the top 100, after all, and made him Flacco's primary backup. Coaches will say that they want to win. For all intents and purposes, though, this season is now on player development and assessment -- especially at the game's most important position. The staff needs time to assess Gabriel, and Gabriel deserves time to acclimate to the NFL level.</p>\n<p>Depending on how Gabriel performs, the team could want to see what Sanders can provide, too. Widely perceived as a potential first- or second-round pick, Sanders fell to the fifth round <span><a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/draft/news/did-shedeur-sanders-get-drafted-colorado-qb-shocks-by-falling-past-first-three-rounds-of-nfl-draft-2025/\" target=\"_blank\">due to wide-ranging factors</a></span>. He showed some exciting ups in the preseason -- some \"wow\" throws and other impressive moments -- but also had some struggles that were on display at Colorado, too.</p><p>Still, at this point, there'd be little reason to go back to Flacco if Gabriel's play is untenable or if he gets hurt. The Browns know the level of play Flacco provides. They likely knew that before the season started. Now that they've deemed Gabriel ready to start, Sanders could be next in line as the franchise's seemingly endless search for a long-term answer at quarterback continues.</p><h2>What does this mean for the Browns?</h2><p>Remember, Cleveland holds not only its own first-round pick in 2026, but Jacksonville's as well thanks to the trade that netted the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/JAC/jacksonville-jaguars/\">Jaguars</a> <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/28909849/travis-hunter/\">Travis Hunter</a> with the No. 2 overall pick. The Browns will almost certainly have a look at quarterback, whether it's available with their own pick or via trading up.</p>\n<p>This could also lead to several young players getting more chances. Cleveland has 12 rookies on its active roster, including two at quarterback, three at running back and one each at wide receiver and tight end. Cleveland won't completely abandon its veterans -- it needs to create a viable environment for its young quarterbacks especially -- but the change to Gabriel could be a sign of things to come, roster-wide.</p>\n            </div>"

The Cardinals have won seven straight games, which is tied for the fourth-longest streak in the nation, and they're coming off a complete team victory over Pitt. QB Miller Moss had over 300 passing yards and three touchdowns, while the Cardinals defense forced five turnovers. Taking care of the ball is an issue for UVA, which had three giveaways in its last game, as the Cavaliers have won the turnover battle just once over their last four games. Virginia also gave up 256 rushing yards last week -- its most since the 2023 season -- and the team has lost three straight road games as the model has Louisville covering more than 60% of the time. <a href=\"https://www.sportsline.com/insiders/college-football-odds-lines-spreads-picks-predictions-betting-advice-for-week-6-2025-from-proven-model/#ttag=09292025_agg_cbssports_picks_football_ncaa_model_Week6cfbodds\" target=\"_blank\">See which other picks the model likes here</a>.</p><p>Another prediction: No. 9 Texas (-7, 41.5) covers against Florida in nearly 70% of simulations on Saturday at 3:30 p.m. ET. The Longhorns will visit The Swamp, but Texas is 9-1 on the road since 2023, the second-best away record in FBS over that span. Arch Manning has 13 total touchdowns (8 passing, 5 rushing) since Week 2, which leads the SEC over this stretch, despite Texas just coming off a bye. Meanwhile, Florida ranks last in the SEC with 22 points per game, and the Gators are 2-8 versus top-10 teams under Billy Napier.

Buffalo leads the NFL in rushing offenses (163.5 rushing yards per game), time of possession per game (34:04) and turnovers per game (0.3).

Watt</a>) and defensive tackle (Cam Heyward), which could make life somewhat more difficult for Allen. Plus, if there's anyone who can end the Bills' streak of 26 games in a row without losing the turnover battle, including the postseason, it's Pittsburgh quarterback <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/419780/aaron-rodgers/\">Aaron Rodgers</a>. Rodgers is the league's all-time leader in touchdown to interception ratio (4.29, 511 passing touchdowns to 119 interceptions), and he's having a vintage season in 2025 just months prior to turning 42-years-old on Dec. 2. </p><table><tbody><tr><th>Aaron Rodgers NFL Ranks, 2025 Season   </th><th><br /></th><th>NFL Rank</th></tr><tr><td><p>Completion Pct</p></td><td><p>68.5%</p></td><td><p>11th</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Pass TD</p></td><td><p>8</p></td><td><p>T-3rd</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Passer Rating</p></td><td><p>102.6</p></td><td><p>9th</p></td></tr></tbody></table><p>That could be a lethal combination for the Bills' undefeated season.

Yes, they do play the Chiefs in Week 9, but Allen's Bills have won four consecutive regular season games against Kansas City dating back to 2021.

That puts Philadelphia in the rarefied air of being just one of six teams to go 20-1 or better in a 21-game span in the last 40 seasons, per CBS Sports Research. All of those prior five teams were led by all-time great quarterbacks: <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/2142052/patrick-mahomes/\">Patrick Mahomes</a>, Aaron Rodgers, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/12531/peyton-manning/\">Peyton Manning</a>, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/187741/tom-brady/\">Tom Brady</a> and Joe Montana. </p><p><strong>Teams to go 20-1 or better in a six-game span, last 40 seasons</strong></p><ul><li>Kansas City Chiefs (2019-2020 and 2023-2024)</li><li>Green Bay Packers (2010-2011)</li><li><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/IND/indianapolis-colts/\">Indianapolis Colts</a> (2008-2009)</li><li>New England Patriots (2003-2004 and 2006-2007)</li><li><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/SF/san-francisco-49ers/\">San Francisco 49ers</a> (1989-1990)</li></ul><p>However, the Eagles' Hurts-led attack under new offensive coordinator Kevin Patullo is riding the struggle bus in 2025, despite the team's 4-0 start. Philadelphia ranks as a bottom five <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://cbssports.com/nfl/teams/\">NFL team</a> in total yards per game (251.5, 30th), yards per carry (3.5, 29th) and yards per play (4.2, 30th) this season.

Playing all these close games will come back to bite them soon. Facing a red hot quarterback in <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/2239997/jordan-love/\">Jordan Love</a> and a Green Bay Packers defense that shut down the Detroit Lions and Washington Commanders when facing each one at Lambeau Field could very easily spell doom for the Eagles.</p><p>Should the Eagles somehow escape Green Bay with a victory, they'll have their hands full with the Detroit Lions and their No. 1 scoring offense (34.3 points per game) in Week 11 back at Lincoln Financial Field. Philadelphia will come out of those two matchups against NFC North powers with at least one loss. </p>\n            </div>"

He has seen just about every type of change to the modern history of the game. So when he saw <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/TB/tampa-bay-buccaneers/\">Buccaneers</a> kicker <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/2165272/chase-mclaughlin/\">Chase McLaughlin</a> nail 65- and 58-yard field goals against his Eagles, he saw the impact of the new kicking ball rules up close and personal.</p><p>\"You know what you guys have missed?\" <a href=\"https://eagles.1rmg.com/transcripts/vic-fangio-9-30-25/\" target=\"_blank\">Fangio said, unprompted</a>. \"Not just you but everybody is we gave up a 65-yard field goal and a 58-yard field goal. These kicking balls that they changed this year have drastically changed the kicking game, field goals in particular. So it's almost like they need an asterisk here. It was the live ball era or the asterisk for those home runs [Barry] Bonds and [Sammy] Sosa and [Mark] McGwire were hitting. The way they've changed the ball ... the NFL, the kicking ball has drastically changed the field goals.\"</p><p>Previously, the NFL provided teams with three new kicking balls shortly before the game. This year, the NFL gave every team 60 kicking balls at the start of the year, giving the team unlimited time to break them in. Teams then provide three specially marked kicking balls per game, per the NFL rule book.</p><p>\"In years past, the officials would rub them down or other people would rub them down and you play with them,\" Fangio said. \"Now the balls are in house all week and they kick those balls that they've had and nobody else touches them. The guy in Dallas is going to hit a 70-plus yarder this year. You can just book it.\"</p><p>\"The guy in Dallas,\" of course, is <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/2815718/brandon-aubrey/\">Brandon Aubrey</a>, who hit a 64-yard field goal in Week 2 against the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/NYG/new-york-giants/\">Giants</a> to force overtime. Aubrey's career long is 65 yards, set last year. McLaughlin's 65-yarder is the longest NFL-wide this season; his previous career long was 57 yards. Overall, there have been 24 field goals of 55 or more yards through four weeks. Last year, that number at this junction was 18. Fangio said it's given him something to think about when calling plays in areas of the field that might not have been within a kicker's previous range.</p>\n<p>\"We just get to work on it a little bit longer than we used to,\" Eagles special team coordinator Michael Clay, speaking immediately after Fangio, said. \"We used to only have an hour, now we get the whole week to fill it in, and the kickers get to pick what ball they feel pretty good about.\"</p><p>Clay explained that kicker <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/2080295/jake-elliott/\">Jake Elliott</a> and punter <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/2222040/braden-mann/\">Braden Mann</a> provide feedback to equipment personnel who work on the kicking balls throughout the week. The results are already speaking for themselves. After going 1 for 7 on field goals from 50 or more yards last year, Elliott is 3 for 3 on those kicks this season.</p><p>As for whether it's good for the game ...</p>\n<p>\"Doesn't the NFL want more points?\" Clay asked rhetorically, a smile on his face. \"There it is.\"</p>\n            </div>"

With his first two Champions League goals, the French striker introduced himself at the highest levels of world soccer and that season brought AS Monaco in the semifinals before losing to Juventus and before his PSG move that happened the following summer, becoming the second most expensive signing in history, after Neymar Jr.'s move from Barcelona to PSG just a few weeks earlier.</p><h2>Possible lineups</h2><p><strong>AS Monaco XI:</strong> Philipp Koehn; Vanderson, Thilo Kehrer, Eric Dier, Caio Henrique; Takumi Minamino, Mamadou Coulibaly, <span>Jordan</span> Teze, Maghnes Akliouche; <span>Mika Biereth</span>, <span>George Ilenikhena</span>.</p><p><strong>Man City XI:</strong> Gianluigi Donnarumma; Rico Lewis, Ruben Dias, <span>Josko Gvardiol</span>, <span>Nathan Ake</span>; Rodri; Savinho, Tijjani Reijnders, Phil Foden, Jeremy Doku; Erling Haaland.</p><h2>Prediction</h2><p>Despite losing the opening game of their European run, AS Monaco are expected to lose again in their second match against Pep Guardiola's side. <strong>PICK: </strong>AS Monaco 1, Man City 3. </p><h2>Matchday 2 TV schedule</h2><p><em>All times U.S./Eastern</em></p><table><tbody><tr><td><p>UEFA Champions League Matchday</p></td><td><p>12 p.m.</p></td><td><p><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.paramountplus.com/?cbscidmt=sports&ftag=PPM-03-10aie0i\">Paramount+</a>, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/watch/cbs-sports-golazo-network?ftag=CBS-03-10ade4e\">CBS Sports Golazo Network</a></p></td></tr><tr><td><p><span>Qarabag</span> vs. Copenhagen</p></td><td><p>12:45 p.m.</p></td><td><p><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.paramountplus.com/?cbscidmt=sports&ftag=PPM-03-10aie0i\">Paramount+</a></p></td></tr><tr><td><p><span>Union Saint-Gilloise</span> vs. Newcastle United</p></td><td><p>12:45 p.m.</p></td><td><p><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.paramountplus.com/?cbscidmt=sports&ftag=PPM-03-10aie0i\">Paramount+</a></p></td></tr><tr><td><p>UEFA Champions League Today</p></td><td><p>2 p.m.</p></td><td><p><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.paramountplus.com/?cbscidmt=sports&ftag=PPM-03-10aie0i\">Paramount+</a>, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://cbs-sports.app.link/ny3ywBQBBjb\">CBS Sports Network</a></p></td></tr><tr><td><p>The Golazo Show</p></td><td><p>3 p.m.</p></td><td><p><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.paramountplus.com/?cbscidmt=sports&ftag=PPM-03-10aie0i\">Paramount+</a></p></td></tr><tr><td><p><span>Borussia Dortmund</span> vs. <span>Athletic Club</span></p></td><td><p>3 p.m.</p></td><td><p><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.paramountplus.com/?cbscidmt=sports&ftag=PPM-03-10aie0i\">Paramount+</a>, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://cbs-sports.app.link/ny3ywBQBBjb\">CBS Sports Network</a></p></td></tr><tr><td><p><span>Villarreal</span> vs. Juventus </p></td><td><p>3 p.m.</p></td><td><p><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.paramountplus.com/?cbscidmt=sports&ftag=PPM-03-10aie0i\">Paramount+</a>, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/watch/cbs-sports-golazo-network?ftag=CBS-03-10ade4e\">CBS Sports Golazo Network</a></p></td></tr><tr><td><p><span>Arsenal</span> vs. Olympiacos</p></td><td><p>3 p.m.</p></td><td><p><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.paramountplus.com/?cbscidmt=sports&ftag=PPM-03-10aie0i\">Paramount+</a></p></td></tr><tr><td><p><span>Monaco</span> vs. Manchester City</p></td><td><p>3 p.m.</p></td><td><p><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.paramountplus.com/?cbscidmt=sports&ftag=PPM-03-10aie0i\">Paramount+</a></p></td></tr><tr><td><span>Bayer Leverkusen</span> vs. PSV</td><td>3 p.m.</td><td><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.paramountplus.com/?cbscidmt=sports&ftag=PPM-03-10aie0i\">Paramount+</a></td></tr><tr><td><span>Barcelona</span> vs. <span>Paris</span> Saint-Germain </td><td>3 p.m.</td><td><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.paramountplus.com/?cbscidmt=sports&ftag=PPM-03-10aie0i\">Paramount+</a></td></tr><tr><td><span>Napoli</span> vs. Sporting Club <span>Portugal</span></td><td>3 p.m.</td><td><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.paramountplus.com/?cbscidmt=sports&ftag=PPM-03-10aie0i\">Paramount+</a></td></tr><tr><td><p>UEFA Champions League Today post-match</p></td><td><p>5 p.m.</p></td><td><p><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.paramountplus.com/?cbscidmt=sports&ftag=PPM-03-10aie0i\">Paramount+</a>, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://cbs-sports.app.link/ny3ywBQBBjb\">CBS Sports Network</a></p></td></tr></tbody></table>\n            </div>\n    </div>\n</article>\n        </div>\n                        </div>"

Carter Bahns here to help kick off spooky season with today's edition of your morning newsletter. </p><p>Things are getting scary for the four teams that lost in MLB Wild Card action, as they face elimination in today's second batch of games. It's a frightening time to be WNBA commissioner Cathy Engelbert, who took loud criticism from one of the league's biggest stars. The Browns' quarterback room might be haunted with another change on the horizon. </p><p>Not everything in the sports world is spooky today, though. Let's get started with some slightly less eerie news featuring Jonathan Kuminga and the Warriors. </p>\n<h2> 🏀 Five things to know Wednesday </h2><ol><li><strong>Jonathan Kuminga and the Warriors finally settled their contract standoff.</strong> At long last, the saga that largely defined the NBA offseason is complete. Kuminga and Golden State <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nba/news/jonathan-kuminga-warriors-end-contract-standoff-as-forward-signs-two-year-deal-with-golden-state-per-report/\">reportedly agreed to a two-year, $48.5 million deal</a> with a team option for the second season. Meanwhile, coach Steve Kerr is set to enter the season on an expiring contract and <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nba/news/warriors-steve-kerr-to-wait-until-offseason-to-negotiate-expiring-contract-not-the-slightest-bit-concerned/\">will not begin negotiations</a> with the Warriors until the campaign is done.</li><li><strong>Teams made leadership changes in MLB and the WNBA.</strong> On the baseball side, manager Ron Washington and interim manager Ray Montgomery are no longer with the Angels. Washington left the team in June to undergo quadruple bypass surgery, and the Angels <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/news/angels-move-on-from-ron-washington-interim-ray-montgomery-will-get-new-manager-for-2026/\">announced Tuesday</a> that he will not return to the team. On the hardwood, the Wings <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/wnba/news/wings-fire-chris-koclanes-team-moves-on-from-coach-after-one-season-as-it-builds-around-paige-bueckers/\">fired</a> coach Chris Koclanes after just one season. He went 10-34 at the helm.</li><li><strong>Kirill Kaprizov became the highest-paid player in NHL history.</strong> Kaprizov and the Wild <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nhl/news/kirill-kaprizov-contract-extension-wild-star-becomes-highest-paid-player-in-nhl-history-with-eight-year-deal/\">signed an eight-year, $136 million extension</a> that is set to pay the star forward $17 million per season. It is the largest deal by total dollars in league history, outdoing the 13-year, $124 million contract Alex Ovechkin signed in 2008.</li><li><strong>MLB Wild Card action is underway.</strong> The Tigers, Cubs, Red Sox and Dodgers are all in the driver's seat of their respective <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/news/mlb-playoffs-2025-wild-card-game-1-live-updates-scores-results/live/\">Wild Card Series</a> after their victories in the first day of the MLB postseason. Each team has a chance to clinch a berth in the Division Series on Wednesday while the Guardians, Padres, Yankees and Reds seek to force a winner-take-all Game 3.</li><li><strong>The Aces are on to the WNBA Finals. </strong>And the Fever's unlikely run fell just short. Las Vegas defeated Indiana, 107-98, in an overtime thriller in <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/wnba/news/aces-vs-fever-live-updates-score-highlights-from-game-5-with-spot-in-wnba-finals-on-the-line/live/\">Game 5 of their semifinal series</a>. A'ja Wilson and Jackie Young willed the Aces to the finals for the third time in four years with a combined 57 points.</li></ol><h2> 🗣️ Do not miss this: Napheesa Collier blasts WNBA commissioner Cathy Engelbert </h2><figure><p><img alt=\"AT&T WNBA All-Star 2025 - Practice Sessions\" src=\"https://sportshub.cbsistatic.com/i/r/2025/10/01/2530fdfd-37b9-467c-9778-5950fafd1a88/resize/670x377/aa427e2d0301de44634261a599db2f51/gettyimages-2225829781-1.jpg\" /></p><figcaption><span>\n                                                                    Getty Images\n                                                            </span></figcaption></figure><p>WNBA officials have been at the center of criticism throughout the 2025 season, but the outward frustration with league operations reached a whole new level Tuesday when <strong>Lynx</strong> star <strong>Napheesa Collier</strong> went public with her disdain for commissioner <strong>Cathy Engelbert</strong>. In a lengthy statement during her end-of-season exit interview, Collier spent four minutes bashing Engelbert over issues ranging from the aforementioned officiating issues to player compensation. </p><p><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/wnba/news/lynxs-napheesa-collier-blasts-wnba-commissioner-cathy-engelbert-we-have-the-worst-leadership-in-the-world/\">You can read Collier's full statement here</a>. Below is a brief excerpt. </p><p>\"I'm not concerned about a fine,\" Collier said. \"I'm concerned about the future of our sport. At some point, everyone deserves to hear the truth from someone who I hope has earned the benefit of the doubt to fight for what is right and fair for our athletes and our fans.

    "body": "<div>\n        <p>The Week 5 NFL schedule is the first with byes, meaning there are fewer contests to make Week 5 NFL bets on than before. That also means you can devote more time, energy and resources to these matchups, which include a number of inter-conference affairs. Jets vs. Cowboys (-2.5), Broncos vs. Eagles (-3.5), Bengals vs. Lions (-10.5) and Chargers vs. Commanders (+3) are some of the AFC vs. NFC games to place Week 5 NFL predictions on.</p><p>There is just one divisional game on Sunday and it sees the Bills hosting the Patriots (+7.5) on Sunday Night Football. Some may prefer making Week 5 NFL picks on common matchups like this one, or the rarer non-conference contests could drum up more interest with NFL betting.

Jaxson Dart picked up a win in his first start, but the Giants also lost their best offensive player in losing Malik Nabers for the season. New York had just 89 team passing yards on Sunday, while the team averaged 243.3 passing yards with Russell Wilson under center. Even with the boost that Dart provided, New York still struggles immensely on the other side of the ball, ranking 30th in both total defense and run defense.</p><p>It's that run defense which could be an issue in the Superdome as the Saints have a top-10 rushing offense. The Saints are coming off covering versus the Bills in which three different players had at least 49 rushing yards, and New Orleans had 189 yards on the ground as a team. The Saints have also racked up three-plus sacks in three of four games this year, while Dart was taken down five times in his starting debut. The model projects New Orleans to have four QB takedowns as it stifles New York's offense, allowing the Saints to cover at home nearly 60% of the time. <a href=\"https://www.sportsline.com/insiders/nfl-odds-lines-spreads-2025-week-5-picks-predictions-from-proven-model/#ttag=09292025_agg_cbssports_picks_football_nfl_model_Week5nflodds\" target=\"_blank\">See which other teams to pick here</a>.</p>\n<p>Another one of its Week 5 NFL predictions: Cardinals (-7.5 41.5) cover versus Tennessee in nearly 60% of simulations. Arizona will have some extra rest after playing last Thursday, and no one has performed better versus the spread against non-conference opponents. The Cardinals have covered in seven straight games versus the AFC, while Tennessee is 0-6 ATS versus the NFC since the start of last season. The Titans have dropped three straight overall versus the spread, meaning they've picked up where they left off last year as their 3-18 spread record since 2024 is the worst in the NFL.</p><p>Tennessee was shut out, 26-0, by the previously winless Texans on Sunday, as the Titans have lost 10 straight games overall. They rank last in both points scored and yards gained, while sitting 26th in points allowed and yards allowed. Arizona has the No. 5 scoring defense and the No. 8 run defense, which could make the Titans overly rely on top pick Cam Ward. However, he just posted both his lowest passer rating and completion percentage as he's yet to throw a touchdown in two road starts. The model also says the Over hits nearly 70% of the time. <a href=\"https://www.sportsline.com/insiders/nfl-odds-lines-spreads-2025-week-5-picks-predictions-from-proven-model/#ttag=09292025_agg_cbssports_picks_football_nfl_model_Week5nflodds\" target=\"_blank\">See which other teams to pick here</a>.</p>\n<h3>How to make Week 5 NFL picks</h3><p>The model has also made the call on who wins and covers in every other game on the Week 5 NFL schedule and just revealed four coveted A-rated spread picks, potentially giving you a huge payday. <a href=\"https://www.sportsline.com/insiders/nfl-odds-lines-spreads-2025-week-5-picks-predictions-from-proven-model/#ttag=09292025_agg_cbssports_picks_football_nfl_model_Week5nflodds\" target=\"_blank\">You can only get every pick for every game at SportsLine</a>.</p><p><strong>So what Week 5 NFL picks can you make with confidence, and which four teams should you lock in now?

    "body": "<div>\n        <p>We're four weeks into the 2025 <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://cbssports.com/nfl/\">NFL</a> season, which means we're about a quarter of the way through. It's hard to believe, given that it feels like the season just started, but that's where we are right now.</p><p>And after four weeks, we've seen enough to -- mostly -- start declaring which teams are good and bad. There's obviously plenty of football left to play, but all 32 teams have also put quite a bit on tape already. And we know with some degree of conviction which teams are definitely good and bad. There's a squishy middle of the league that is more complicated to sort out, but we can at least make some educated guesses on which teams are probably good or bad.</p><p>That's what we're here to do today: We're sorting all 32 of the league's teams into five distinct tiers based on where they are right now and will likely go in the future. These include factors like their schedules, conditions of rosters and more.</p><h2>Tier 5: See you at the draft<br /></h2><ul><li><strong><em><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/CAR/carolina-panthers/\">Carolina Panthers</a>, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/CIN/cincinnati-bengals/\">Cincinnati Bengals</a>, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/CLE/cleveland-browns/\">Cleveland Browns</a>, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/NO/new-orleans-saints/\">New Orleans Saints</a>, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/NYJ/new-york-jets/\">New York Jets</a>, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/TEN/tennessee-titans/\">Tennessee Titans</a></em></strong></li></ul><p>These teams are going nowhere fast.</p><p>The Panthers have looked fairly embarrassing in three of their four games, and they somehow blew out the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/ATL/atlanta-falcons/\">Falcons</a> 30-0 in the other. We're betting that the three losses are more representative than the one win. The same goes for the Browns, who somehow had their defense steal a game against the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/GB/green-bay-packers/\">Packers</a> in Week 3 but have otherwise not looked good and are making a <span><a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/news/browns-to-start-dillon-gabriel-at-qb-bench-joe-flacco/\" target=\"_blank\">quarterback change</a></span>.</p>\n<p>The Saints, Jets and Titans are all 0-4, and they look varying degrees of terrible. The Jets have probably looked the \"best\" of the three teams, and they don't look good at all. They could have won that Week 1 game against the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/PIT/pittsburgh-steelers/\">Steelers</a> and almost stole Week 3 at the Bucs, but they've gone down big in three of their four games so far. The Saints have generally hung around and seemed run-of-the-mill bad rather than atrocious in their games, but they're just not a talented team. Tennessee is probably on the verge of firing its coach, and quarterback <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/3168422/cam-ward/\">Cam Ward</a> put it best <span><a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/news/cam-ward-sums-up-titans-play-through-four-games-we-ass/\" target=\"_blank\">when he said</a></span> of the Titans, \"We ass.\"</p><p>It might be aggressive to put the Bengals here, but they've lost two straight in pathetic fashion without <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/2179798/joe-burrow/\">Joe Burrow</a> and their next three games are against the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/DET/detroit-lions/\">Lions</a>, Packers and Steelers. They'll likely be 2-5 before we have a chance to blink.</p><h2>Tier 4: Probably bad<br /></h2><ul><li><strong><em><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/LV/las-vegas-raiders/\">Las Vegas Raiders</a>, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/MIA/miami-dolphins/\">Miami Dolphins</a>, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/NYG/new-york-giants/\">New York Giants</a></em></strong></li></ul><p>The Raiders have lost three in a row, including one game to a backup quarterback, and their offense just has not been able to get much going to date because <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/1700358/geno-smith/\">Geno Smith</a> can't stop throwing interceptions and <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/26693971/brock-bowers/\">Brock Bowers</a> doesn't look like himself. The defense also is not nearly good enough to carry the team, as it's probably still the weaker unit.</p>\n<p>Miami has looked vaguely competent in two of its four games but been able to defeat only the decrepit Jets, and the Dolphins just lost <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/2131163/tyreek-hill/\">Tyreek Hill</a> for the season. Undermanned on both offense and defense now, they're likely to slide even further back from the pack over the rest of the season. (They do have the good fortune of playing games against the Panthers, Browns, Saints and Jets again, though.)</p><p>The Giants pulled off Sunday's shocking upset of the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/LAC/los-angeles-chargers/\">Chargers</a> and <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/26694019/jaxson-dart/\">Jaxson Dart</a> acquitted himself fairly well in his first start, but this team that could do nothing offensively with <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/1272242/russell-wilson/\">Russell Wilson</a> under center just lost top playmaker <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/26697761/malik-nabers/\" target=\"_blank\">Malik Nabers</a> for the year to a torn ACL. Unless the defensive line totally dominates like it did in Week 4, it's probably still going to be a long season.</p><h2>Tier 3: Possibly frisky<br /></h2><ul><li><strong><em><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/ARI/arizona-cardinals/\">Arizona Cardinals</a>, Atlanta Falcons, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/BAL/baltimore-ravens/\">Baltimore Ravens</a>, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/CHI/chicago-bears/\">Chicago Bears</a>, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/DAL/dallas-cowboys/\">Dallas Cowboys</a>, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/DEN/denver-broncos/\">Denver Broncos</a>, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/HOU/houston-texans/\">Houston Texans</a>, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/IND/indianapolis-colts/\">Indianapolis Colts</a>, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/JAC/jacksonville-jaguars/\">Jacksonville Jaguars</a>, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/MIN/minnesota-vikings/\">Minnesota Vikings</a>, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/NE/new-england-patriots/\">New England Patriots</a>, Pittsburgh Steelers, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/WAS/washington-commanders/\">Washington Commanders</a></em></strong></li></ul><p>This is the largest group of teams, and that makes sense because we're still pretty early in the season and don't really know enough about anybody to draw that many definitive conclusions just yet. So we're lumping the entire middle class of the NFL into one tier, deemed possibly frisky, until we know more.</p>\n<p>Arizona beat two bad teams and lost to two good ones. The Falcons have shown a low floor without yet showing the type of ceiling that we want to see from a good team. The Ravens have a lot of talent, but their defense is decimated and now <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/2239671/lamar-jackson/\">Lamar Jackson</a> might miss time. The Bears seem to have rebounded from their rough start but did so against two weak defenses.</p><p>The Cowboys have shown that they can move the ball and put up points, but their defense is atrocious. The Broncos just stomped the Bengals, but their offense hasn't fully gotten untracked just yet. The Texans are here mostly because the AFC South isn't great and we know that they have a really good defense.</p><p>The Colts are off to a surprising start to the season but required a massive comeback for one of their wins and just lost to the first elite team they played. The Jags are 3-1 but lost to the Bengals, and there's no way that they can keep forcing turnovers at the rate they have to date. The Vikings have a ferocious defense, but we have yet to see the offense get fully untracked.</p>\n<p>The Patriots have had their only two wins against the dregs of the league, and have looked ordinary in their two losses, one of which saw them turn it over five times. Pittsburgh could easily be 1-3 instead of 3-1 if the ball had bounced differently in games against the Jets and Pats. And we don't yet know what Washington will look like when <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/3123337/jayden-daniels/\">Jayden Daniels</a> comes back.</p><p>All of these teams have their strengths, obviously. But again, we probably don't know enough about them to make a determination on whether they are probably bad or good. So we're sticking them here and punting on that determination a while longer.</p><h2>Tier 2: Probably good<br /></h2><ul><li><strong><em><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/KC/kansas-city-chiefs/\">Kansas City Chiefs</a>, Los Angeles Chargers, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/SF/san-francisco-49ers/\">San Francisco 49ers</a>, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/SEA/seattle-seahawks/\">Seattle Seahawks</a>, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/TB/tampa-bay-buccaneers/\">Tampa Bay Buccaneers</a></em></strong></li></ul><p>These are teams that we know are talented and have gotten off to varying degrees of good starts (they're all 3-1 except for the Chiefs) but also know have real flaws on one side of the ball or another, for one reason or another.</p>\n<p>The Chiefs finally looked like themselves offensively against the Ravens, but that defense has been torn to shreds by every opponent. We need to see that type of performance more consistently, and the same goes for the defense. The Chargers just lost to the Giants and now must play without both of their starting tackles for a while, but the defense is still terrific (two of New York's scoring drives started deep in L.A. territory) and <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/2221960/justin-herbert/\">Justin Herbert</a> was playing at an extremely high level.</p><p>The 49ers are dealing with injuries pretty much everywhere on both offense and defense. <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/2961306/brock-purdy/\">Brock Purdy</a>, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/3122949/ricky-pearsall/\">Ricky Pearsall</a>, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/2180514/jauan-jennings/\">Jauan Jennings</a>, <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/2260972/nick-bosa/\" target=\"_blank\">Nick Bosa</a> -- basically everyone<em> except</em> <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/2136743/christian-mccaffrey/\">Christian McCaffrey</a> is ailing at the moment. The Seahawks have one of the NFL's best defenses, if not the single best, and that will keep them competitive in just about every game. We have to see what the offense looks like when it gets into trailing mode to have more confidence that the 49ers can contend.</p><p>The Bucs are also 3-1 and dealing with a ton of injuries. <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/1824909/mike-evans/\">Mike Evans</a> and the entire right side of the offensive line are out. <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/3162347/jalen-mcmillan/\">Jalen McMillan</a> won't be back until after the bye. The run game has not looked the same as it did last year and <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/26693770/bucky-irving/\">Bucky Irving</a> is now dealing with an injury. We almost have to be in wait-and-see mode here.</p>\n<h2>Tier 1: Inner circle (for now)<br /></h2><ul><li><strong><em><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/BUF/buffalo-bills/\">Buffalo Bills</a>, Detroit Lions, <strong><em>Green Bay Packers, </em></strong><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/LAR/los-angeles-rams/\">Los Angeles Rams</a>, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/PHI/philadelphia-eagles/\">Philadelphia Eagles</a></em></strong></li></ul><p>The Eagles and Bills are 4-0. They were inner-circle contenders last year and just keep winning. There have been some fits and starts for Philadelphia's offense, but we know how talented a team that is, and we've seen that the Eagles can win games despite not playing at their best. Buffalo has given us no reason to doubt that it is one of the league's best teams, with a rollicking comeback over the Ravens in Week 1 and double-digit wins over dregs in the other three games.</p><p>Separating the Lions, Packers and Rams from the rest of the teams near the top is a bit more difficult, but mostly comes down to ceiling. The Lions have shown that their offense is still a machine, even if that machine got taken offline for a while in Week 1 against Green Bay. The Packers have shown that their defense, which did just get torched by <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/1824864/dak-prescott/\">Dak Prescott</a>, has the ability to be such a monster that it is almost impossible to move the ball. And the Rams have shown that they can compete with anyone on both sides of the ball. Their only loss came on a blocked kick in Philadelphia, in a game they mostly controlled.</p>\n            </div>"

Trinidad Chambliss, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/teams/MISS/ole-miss-rebels/\">Ole Miss</a></h3><p>It's clear now that Lane Kiffin may have had the wrong QB1 to start the season. Since stepping in for an injured <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/players/29333654/austin-simmons/\">Austin Simmons</a>, the Division II transfer has dazzled, leading Ole Miss to a Week 5 win over <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/teams/LSU/lsu-tigers/\">LSU</a> with 314 passing yards, a touchdown and 71 yards rushing. Chambliss continues to prove he can handle the Rebels offense. <strong>Last week: 5</strong></p><h3>2. Diego Pavia, Vanderbilt</h3><p>Who knows where the Commodores would be without Pavia taking advantage of an extra year of eligibility. With six total touchdowns in a Week 5 win over <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/teams/UTAHST/utah-state-aggies/\">Utah State</a>, he now tops the SEC in total scores and ranks among the national leaders in completion percentage (74.6%) and passer rating (184.62). Vanderbilt will need that and more as they face a brutal slate of SEC opponents in the weeks ahead. <strong>Last week: 6</strong></p>\n<h3>3. <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/players/3162966/haynes-king/\">Haynes King</a>, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/teams/GATECH/georgia-tech-yellow-jackets/\">Georgia Tech</a></h3><p>Nobody grinds out wins quite like King and Georgia Tech. In Week 5 at <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/teams/WAKE/wake-forest-demon-deacons/\">Wake Forest</a>, he notched his 13th career game with both a passing and rushing touchdown, breaking the Yellow Jackets' all-time record. After turnovers on each of Georgia Tech's first three possessions this season, King has committed just one lost fumble and no interceptions over the last 256 snaps with 10 total touchdowns. <strong>Last week: 3</strong></p><h3>4. Fernando Mendoza, Indiana</h3><p>A slight dip in the rankings this week for Mendoza after a close win at <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/teams/IOWA/iowa-hawkeyes/\">Iowa</a>. The Indiana quarterback threw his first interception of the season but added two more touchdowns, still giving him the best touchdown-to-interception ratio in the FBS. The Hoosiers are in the driver's seat for a return trip to the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://cbssports.com/college-football/\">College Football</a> Playoff with Mendoza set to face a tough test at Oregon in Week 7. <strong>Last week: 1</strong></p><h3>5. Ty Simpson, Alabama</h3><p>Suddenly, Simpson is the one rising up the Heisman Trophy odds after leading the Crimson Tide to another win against <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/teams/UGA/georgia-bulldogs/\">Georgia</a>. The first-year starter is one of just three Power Four quarterbacks with at least 120 pass attempts without an interception so far this season. Under coach Kalen DeBoer, the offensive system is starting to click, and coordinator Ryan Grubb has tailored the scheme perfectly to Simpson's strengths. <strong>Last week: 5</strong></p>\n<h3>6. Dante Moore, Oregon</h3><p>Going into Happy Valley and upsetting Penn State during a \"White Out\" is no small feat, but that's exactly what Moore delivered for Oregon, completing 74.4% of his passes for three touchdowns. The poise he displayed under such hostile conditions underscores why he's quickly emerging as one of <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://cbssports.com/college-football/\">college football's</a> most reliable and confident signal-callers this season. Moore is the betting favorite for the Heisman Trophy at +600 according to <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/betting/news/fanduel-promo-code/\">FanDuel Sportsbook</a>.<strong> Last week: 12</strong></p><h3>7. <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/players/29388474/cj-carr/\">CJ Carr</a>, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/teams/ND/notre-dame-fighting-irish/\">Notre Dame</a></h3><p>Carr has thrived against two of the weakest passing defenses in the Power Four over the past two weeks, tossing for a combined 577 yards and six touchdowns for Notre Dame. What stands out is his aggressiveness downfield, averaging 11.5 air yards per attempt -- tied for ninth among FBS quarterbacks with at least 20 attempts per game. <strong>Last week: 29</strong></p><h3>8. <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/players/26713418/sawyer-robertson/\">Sawyer Robertson</a>, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/teams/BAYLOR/baylor-bears/\">Baylor</a></h3><p>Anytime the opposing defensive coordinator is shown the door the next day, it's a clear indicator of a dominant performance. Unsurprisingly, Robertson carved up <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/teams/OKLAST/oklahoma-state-cowboys/\">Oklahoma State's</a> secondary for 393 yards and four touchdowns, setting season highs in both yards per attempt (11.2) and completion rate (68.6%). The Baylor quarterback now leads the FBS with 17 passing touchdowns and 342.6 passing yards per game. <strong>Last week: 16</strong></p>\n<h3>9. <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/players/28877253/josh-hoover/\">Josh Hoover</a>, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/teams/TCU/tcu-horned-frogs/\">TCU</a></h3><p>Hoover is one of the biggest fallers in this week's updated rankings. For just the fourth time in 23 starts at TCU, he failed to throw a touchdown pass in a 27-24 loss to <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/teams/ARIZST/arizona-state-sun-devils/\">Arizona State</a>, a game in which the Horned Frogs squandered a 17-0 lead. A key reason for the setback was top target and wide receiver Eric McCalister being limited to just 12 snaps. <strong>Last week: 2</strong></p><h3>10. <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/players/28909557/jayden-maiava/\">Jayden Maiava</a>, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/teams/USC/usc-trojans/\">USC</a></h3><p>Maiava had, without question, his roughest outing of the season in USC's loss at <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/teams/ILL/illinois-fighting-illini/\">Illinois</a>, even though he still threw for 364 yards and two touchdowns. Both scores came to <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/players/29123772/makai-lemon/\">Makai Lemon</a> in the fourth quarter, erasing a 14-point deficit and giving the Trojans a late lead after a successful 2-point conversion. Despite tossing his first interception of the season, the defeat wasn't on Maiava alone. <strong>Last week: 7</strong></p><h3>11. <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/players/28876844/byrum-brown/\">Byrum Brown</a>, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/teams/SFLA/south-florida-bulls/\">South Florida</a></h3><p>Byrum has been the driving force behind the Bulls' start. His skillset fits perfectly in Alex Golesh's veer-and-shoot offense, and if USF hopes to contend for an American Conference title and a spot in the College Football Playoff Byrum will need to continue pushing the tempo and stretching defenses over the next couple months. <strong>Last week: 10</strong></p>\n<h3>12. <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/players/26701853/luke-altmyer/\">Luke Altmyer</a>, Illinois</h3><p>Altmyer bounced back from Illinois' blowout loss at Indiana to engineer a win over USC, passing for more than 300 yards for just the third time since joining the Fighting Illini. He threw three touchdowns and helped set up the game-winning field goal in the two-minute drill. Remarkably, Altmyer has yet to turn the ball over -- or even put it on the ground -- this season, maintaining perfect ball security. <strong>Last week: 21</strong></p><h3>13. <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/players/29123610/joey-aguilar/\">Joey Aguilar</a>, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/teams/TENN/tennessee-volunteers/\">Tennessee</a></h3><p>Aguilar showed grit, overcoming a pair of interceptions to lead Tennessee to an overtime win that quieted the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/teams/MISSST/mississippi-state-bulldogs/\">Mississippi State</a> cowbells. On a 13-play, 75-yard game-tying drive in the fourth quarter, he completed all six passes for 54 yards before capping it with a decisive 6-yard touchdown run. <strong>Last week: 14</strong></p><h3>14. Brendan Sorsby, Cincinnati</h3><p>The Sorsby show is rolling. After <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/teams/NEB/nebraska-cornhuskers/\">Nebraska's</a> secondary rattled him early, he's been unstoppable, throwing 10 touchdowns with zero interceptions in his last three games. His 11.9 yards per attempt since Week 2 leads all FBS quarterbacks with at least 20 attempts per game, putting defenses on notice. Suddenly Cincinnati looks like a potential contender in the Big 12. <strong>Last week: 48</strong></p>\n<h3>15. <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/players/29391740/julian-sayin/\">Julian Sayin</a>, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/teams/OHIOST/ohio-state-buckeyes/\">Ohio State</a></h3><p>Making his first road start since high school (!!), Sayin ended <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/teams/WASH/washington-huskies/\">Washington's</a> 22-game home winning streak with a poised, methodical performance. After missing on three of his first seven passes, he completed 10 straight before finishing 22-of-28 for 208 yards and two touchdowns for top-ranked Ohio State. <strong>Last week: 28</strong></p><h3>16. <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/players/29123829/devon-dampier/\">Devon Dampier</a>, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/teams/UTAH/utah-utes/\">Utah</a></h3><p>It's obvious now that a fully healthy Dampier is <em>wayyy</em> more effective than the one hobbled in the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/teams/TXTECH/texas-tech-red-raiders/\">Texas Tech</a> loss. The Utah quarterback looked sharp and decisive at <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/teams/WVU/west-virginia-mountaineers/\">West Virginia</a>, piling up five total touchdowns while completing 80.8% of his passes at a season-best 9.1 yards per attempt to power the Week 5 win. <strong>Last week: 20</strong></p><h3>17. <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/players/29158415/sam-leavitt/\">Sam Leavitt</a>, Arizona State</h3><p>Out-dueling Josh Hoover was a massive boost for Leavitt's stock. The Arizona State quarterback spearheaded a furious rally from 17 points down, tossing two touchdown passes and adding a rushing score. From the middle of the second quarter into the early fourth, Leavitt was nearly flawless, completing 16 of 18 throws to keep the Sun Devils offense humming. <strong>Last week: 42</strong></p>\n<h3>18. Rocco Becht, Iowa State</h3><p>Becht had a streak of 22 consecutive games with at least one passing touchdown that was snapped in a win against <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/teams/ARIZ/arizona-wildcats/\">Arizona</a>, but made up for it with a career-best three rushing scores to propel Iowa State. Back-to-back road games coming up for the Cyclones will test whether Becht can keep finding ways to carry the offense. <strong>Last week: 26</strong></p><h3>19. <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/players/3163129/carson-beck/\">Carson Beck</a>, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/teams/MIAMI/miami-fla-hurricanes/\">Miami</a></h3><p>Beck hasn't needed eye-popping stats to keep Miami unbeaten, but that could change this week. The Hurricanes head to Tallahassee for a marquee showdown with <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/teams/FSU/florida-state-seminoles/\">Florida State</a>, whose secondary has limited explosive plays while also piling up takeaways. <strong>Last week: 17</strong></p><h3>20. <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/players/29392540/dylan-raiola/\">Dylan Raiola</a>, Nebraska</h3><p>Statistically, Raiola has played like a top-10 quarterback in the FBS this season, but a few flaws still keep him outside the elite tier. Better protection up front would smooth out those rough edges, giving him more chances to push the ball downfield. Still, without Raiola, Nebraska's offense looks rather ordinary -- he's the difference between respectability and irrelevance. <strong>Last week: 18</strong></p>\n<p><strong>21. <a target=\"_blank\"
