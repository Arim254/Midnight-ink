At MetLife Stadium just outside New York City, the Giants put a \"Taylor Cam\" on the big screen and played Swift's song \"Welcome to New York\" while panning past several fans ... before arriving at Giants legend Lawrence Taylor puffing on a cigar on, as it turned out, \"Lawrence Taylor Cam.\"</p>\n<p>A first-ballot Hall of Famer, Taylor spent his entire NFL career, from 1981-93, with the Giants. During that time, he won Defensive Player of the Year four times -- including as a rookie -- made the Pro Bowl 10 times and was a first-team All Pro eight times. His 132.5 official sacks (they became official in 1982, after his rookie season) are tied for 14th in NFL history.</p>\n<p>After this trick, maybe there's some \"Bad Blood\" between Taylor Swift fans and the Giants. Hopefully, they'll be able to \"Shake It Off\" as good-natured fun.</p>\n            </div>\n    </div>"

And he might have added reason to try pushing the rock at home, with several key players banged up in the Lions' defensive backfield, including ball-hawking safety <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/2961816/kerby-joseph/\">Kerby Joseph</a> (knee) and top cover corner <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/2261288/d-j-reed/\">D.J. Reed</a> (knee). Even if both are able to suit up, they may not be at full speed, putting more pressure on Lions Swiss Army knife <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/3170863/brian-branch/\">Brian Branch</a>.</li><li><strong>Can the Ravens generate a pass rush? </strong>The Lions have left tackle <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/1983776/taylor-decker/\">Taylor Decker</a> nursing an injury, but Baltimore isn't exactly overflowing with proven edge defenders. Madubuike leads the club with two sacks through two games but will be sidelined Monday night, and outside linebacker <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/1752529/kyle-van-noy/\">Kyle Van Noy</a> (hamstring), who led the Ravens with 12.5 sacks a year ago, has also been ruled out. That leaves <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/2961253/odafe-oweh/\">Odafe Oweh</a>, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/3168791/tavius-robinson/\">Tavius Robinson</a> and rookie <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/26706090/mike-green/\">Mike Green</a> as the top candidates to get after Jared Goff. And getting after him is key, because when he's got time to operate, Goff excels at quickly distributing the ball to his playmakers.</li></ul><h2>X factor to watch</h2>\n<p>When Hopkins joined the Ravens this year, plenty of reasonably minded folks waved off the acquisition as another low-risk, low-reward gamble on an aging, declining pass catcher -- a Baltimore special. But Hopkins has already proven remarkably clutch as a deep-ball artist for Lamar Jackson, scoring twice on just four catches and securing all four of his targets. He may be best served as a situational option at age 33, but D-Hop also just looks refreshed while operating downfield. Working against a bruised Lions secondary, he could have more opportunities to serve as a sort of closer for Baltimore's passing attack, whether on third down or in the red zone.</p><h2>Ravens vs. Lions prediction, pick</h2>\n<p>Two years ago, these two heavyweights met in a late-October clash in Baltimore, and the Ravens ran away with it, rolling to a 38-6 victory that had many questioning whether Dan Campbell's Lions were really on the ascent. Jackson was near-perfect in that matchup, tossing three scores and rushing for a fourth, while Goff hurled a whopping 53 passes while trying -- and failing -- to keep up.</p><p>We're not counting on that kind of lopsided affair this time around. That's mostly due to the remaining questions on Baltimore's defense, which was ill-prepared to hold a Week 1 lead against Buffalo and is now without a pair of front-seven tentpoles in Madubuike and Van Noy. Their absences alone should enable the Lions to properly establish the run and set up Goff's play-action shots to St. Brown, Williams and tight end <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/3124197/sam-laporta/\">Sam LaPorta</a>.</p>\n<p>That said, this game is still on the Ravens' turf. Baltimore is 35-16 at home since Jackson took over as the full-timer in 2019. And Jackson remains in MVP form as the do-it-all centerpiece of his squad. Monday's matchup might require him to don his cape down the stretch, but we've seen him do it before, and we expect to see it again. <em><strong>Pick: Ravens 28, Lions 26 | Lions +4.5, Over 53.5</strong></em></p>\n            </div>\n    </div>\n</article>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n                        </div>"

Instead he turned around and produced an awe-inspiring game plan against the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/DAL/dallas-cowboys/\">Cowboys</a>, unfurling a confident <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/26695775/caleb-williams/\">Caleb Williams</a>, effortless offensive production and even a flea flicker to cruise past Dallas in front of a roaring Soldier Field. Just like that, Johnson has the attention and growing support of Bears faithful who might've been skeptical of his influence after the first two weeks of the season.</p><h2>Loser: Jerry Jones</h2><p>As long as the Cowboys are in the headlines, Jones is <span><a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/news/micah-parsons-drama-is-just-the-latest-cowboys-circus-act-from-jerry-jones-whose-business-is-nfl-headlines/\" target=\"_blank\">probably happy</a></span>. But at least from a roster-building standpoint, well, Jones took another big \"L\" on Sunday. After his Micah Parsons-less defense surrendered big play after big play to <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/1272242/russell-wilson/\">Russell Wilson</a> and the Giants in Week 2, barely escaping with a victory in that one, Jones saw his most expensive investment, quarterback <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/1824864/dak-prescott/\">Dak Prescott</a>, toss a pair of picks, including a head-scratching red-zone misfire, as the Cowboys fell flat against the Bears.</p><h2>Winner: <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/26540135/jordan-davis/\">Jordan Davis</a></h2><p>The <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/PHI/philadelphia-eagles/\">Eagles</a> were far from a juggernaut for much of their anticipated game against the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/LAR/los-angeles-rams/\">Rams</a>, falling behind 26-7 before <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/2240246/jalen-hurts/\">Jalen Hurts</a> and <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/2258303/a-j-brown/\">A.J. Brown</a> finally gained steam. But Davis was the unsung hero in the Birds' comeback, chasing down <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/1114942/matthew-stafford/\">Matthew Stafford</a> for a key late-game stand and then literally swatting victory from Los Angeles' grasp, blocking and then returning a would-be walk-off field goal for a 61-yard touchdown. <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/3163950/jalen-carter/\">Jalen Carter</a> may be the face of Vic Fangio's defensive front, but Davis is announcing himself as well.</p>\n<h2>Loser: <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/2180355/jake-browning/\">Jake Browning</a></h2><p>Years ago, Jake Browning hollered to the cameras after leading a win over the Vikings, insisting Minnesota should've never let him go as a backup. Well, the Bengals quarterback had no reason to boast this time around, filling in for an injured <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/2179798/joe-burrow/\">Joe Burrow</a> and stumbling all over the yard in a 48-10 embarrassment. An ugly pick six put Cincinnati in an early hole, and it only got worse from there, as the Vikings enjoyed a calm and collected outing from their own emergency starter in Wentz.</p><h2>Winner: Brian Flores</h2><p>Wentz was the big story under center for Minnesota, stepping in for the injured <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/26695214/j-j-mccarthy/\">J.J. McCarthy</a> with <span><a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/news/can-carson-wentz-write-his-redemption-story-how-vikings-qb-has-a-big-last-chance-after-j-j-mccarthy-injury/\" target=\"_blank\">a chance to write his own redemption story</a></span>. And he was solid, getting <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/2871343/justin-jefferson/\">Justin Jefferson</a> involved while leaning on a strong day from <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/2967536/jordan-mason/\">Jordan Mason</a>. But Flores was the real MVP of the Bengals beatdown, confusing and pressuring Browning from the jump. Cincinnati didn't once look comfortable, leaving Zac Taylor totally without answers on the other sideline. Looks like the NFC North isn't a wrap just yet.</p><h2>Loser: <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/2963496/michael-penix-jr/\">Michael Penix Jr.</a></h2><p>One week after a cool, if understated, performance in a prime-time rout of the Vikings, Penix crashed to Earth in what many viewed as a very winnable divisional clash with the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/CAR/carolina-panthers/\">Panthers</a>. His two picks were egregious; one went for a Carolina score, and the other just as well could have. Coach Raheem Morris was borderline defensive after the 30-0 dud, ruling out any chance of <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/1272574/kirk-cousins/\">Kirk Cousins</a> reclaiming the top job, but what if this continues and the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/ATL/atlanta-falcons/\">Falcons</a> lose out on another chance to seriously challenge the South?</p><h2>Winner: Shane Steichen</h2><p>Another week, another sharp day from Daniel Jones as the <em>undefeated </em>starting quarterback of the Colts. The most impressive thing about Jones in Indianapolis? He's actually threading the needle down the field, which he rarely did with the Giants. Besides his resurgence, Steichen can also smile about <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/2866395/jonathan-taylor/\">Jonathan Taylor</a>, who looks like MVP material, exploding for another 100-yard outing and adding a trio of touchdowns against the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/TEN/tennessee-titans/\">Titans</a>. Boy does Steichen's squad look much more formidable than Tennessee.</p><h2>Loser: Matt LaFleur</h2><p>He may be among the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://cbssports.com/nfl/\">NFL's</a> top coaches, but LaFleur probably deserves most of the blame for the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/GB/green-bay-packers/\">Packers</a> laying an egg against the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/CLE/cleveland-browns/\">Browns</a> to squander a potential 3-0 start to the year. Green Bay easily out-possessed Cleveland, which is no surprise given <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/1250697/joe-flacco/\">Joe Flacco</a> remaining Kevin Stefanski's sluggish signal-caller, but undid much of its own progress with 14 penalties. <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/2239997/jordan-loves/\">Jordan Love's</a> killer interception late in the fourth quarter also came on a curious play call from LaFleur. The Packers aren't invincible, after all.</p><h2>Winner: Mike Tomlin</h2><p>Aaron Rodgers is quietly off to a pretty stellar start as the Steelers' quarterback, saving his best for last with a go-ahead touchdown to <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/2866214/calvin-austin-iii/\">Calvin Austin III</a> against the Patriots. But Tomlin's defense also finally hit its stride working against <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/26695757/drake-maye/\">Drake Maye</a> and the Patriots in Week 3, forcing five turnovers and holding New England to 14 points. This group still feels more scrappy than spectacular, but isn't that always what Tomlin's teams are? At any rate, Sunday's win was historic, marking the Steelers' first in Foxborough since the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/493043/ben-roethlisberger/\">Ben Roethlisberger</a> days in 2008.</p><h2>Loser: <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/2221960/justin-herbert/\">Justin Herbert</a> skeptics</h2><p>Plenty of people are still hesitant to crown Herbert as a legitimate MVP candidate, and that's understandable; after all, talent didn't necessarily translate to big-game victories for the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/LAC/los-angeles-chargers/\">Chargers</a> gunslinger over his first five seasons. But big No. 10 was on point yet again Sunday, saving some of his best darts for crunch time in a back-and-forth brawl with the rival <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/DEN/denver-broncos/\">Broncos</a>. He was especially impressive on a fourth-quarter strike to <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/1737096/keenan-allen/\">Keenan Allen</a>, who also looks fully rejuvenated back with the Bolts.</p>\n            </div>"

While Wilson was winning a <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://cbssports.com/nfl/superbowl/\">Super Bowl</a> in Seattle and taking the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/SEA/seattle-seahawks/\">Seahawks</a> to another, Mahomes was leading Kansas City to five Super Bowls and three championships. The Chiefs will look to get more out of their running game and will look for more production from <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/2079567/kareem-hunt/\">Kareem Hunt</a> and <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/2966551/isiah-pacheco/\">Isiah Pacheco</a>, who have combined to rush 28 times for 94 yards and two touchdowns. There are several NFL player props one could target for these star players, or you may find value in going after other options like Malik Nabers, Travis Kelce or Hollywood Brown.</p><p>Giants tight end <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/3162129/theo-johnson/\">Theo Johnson</a> had his role increase in the overtime loss to Dallas.

If Johnson has a similar type of volume going forward, then the over for his receiving yards NFL prop may be one to consider.

Johnson, a fourth-round pick by the Giants in 2024, has gone over that total in seven of his last nine games. He has had 35 yards receiving or more in five of those. In the season opener, the Chiefs' defense allowed tight end <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/2165249/tyler-conklin/\">Tyler Conklin</a> of the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/LAC/los-angeles-chargers/\">Los Angeles Chargers</a> to catch two passes for 50 yards.</p><p>In 12 games last season, Johnson finished with 12 receptions for 331 yards (11.4 average) and one touchdown. In four seasons at Penn State at the collegiate level, he was a weapon. He finished with 77 catches for 938 yards and 12 touchdowns. In 2023, his last season with the Nittany Lions, he caught 34 passes for 341 yards and seven touchdowns.

Wait, what? Yes, this is reality: <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/1272242/russell-wilson/\">Russell Wilson</a> is clinging to the top quarterback job in East Rutherford, New Jersey, after a 450-yard shootout against the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/DAL/dallas-cowboys/\">Dallas Cowboys</a>, while <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/2142052/patrick-mahomes/\">Patrick Mahomes</a> doesn't even have 450 yards on the season as the Chiefs limp toward what they hope is their first victory.</p><p>How, exactly, did we get here? Well, for one, it's not quite fair to crown the Giants just yet: Despite Wilson's surprise big-play showing against Dallas, the G-Men still managed to squander an NFC East upset thanks to a last-minute Wilson interception and some porous defense. Concern in Kansas City is real, however, with Mahomes practically tasked with doing everything himself on an offense littered with aging and/or injured skill weapons.</p><p><em><a href=\"https://martech.cbssports.com/bt/redirect/prod?b=fanduel&amp;c=sport&amp;sid=551cbc7d-0b82-40c3-9441-5a5bff8cb9d8--77c4\" target=\"_blank\">Click here to bet Chiefs vs. Giants at FanDuel Sportsbook</a>, where new users get $300 in bonus bets with a winning $5 wager:</em></p><p>One game doesn't make or break a season.

That's partially because Patrick Mahomes' offensive line is still in a state of transition. He's also got basically no run support and an aging, injury-prone cast of pass catchers. All that said, he's shown some juice as a scrambler. And the Giants might be just the secondary he needs to see to get things moving down the field after they surrendered 40 points to Dallas.</li><li><strong>How will Steve Spagnuolo defend <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/26697761/malik-nabers/\">Malik Nabers</a>? </strong>Not even double coverage is a guarantee to slow the Giants' No. 1 wideout, who all but singlehandedly kept New York in a shootout against the Cowboys in Week 2, finishing with nine catches for 167 yards and two scores. The Chiefs just got done keeping a tight lid on the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/PHI/philadelphia-eagles/\">Philadelphia Eagles</a>' passing attack, but that's probably more a testament to the way the Birds play football, leaning heavily on the grind-it-out run game. Nabers alone has the electricity to test K.C.'s back end, and if Wilson remains on the money with his deep shots, look out.</li><li><strong>Can anyone step up in the Chiefs' backfield? </strong>As we mentioned earlier, Mahomes has been trying to do everything, leading the club in rushing (123 yards) through two games. Both <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/2966551/isiah-pacheco/\">Isiah Pacheco</a> and <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/2079567/kareem-hunt/\">Kareem Hunt</a>, meanwhile, are averaging fewer than 4 yards per carry. If ever there were a time for the running backs to hold up their end of the bargain, it might be Sunday when faced with the Giants' interior, which, despite boasting <a target=\"_blank\">Dexter Lawrence,</a> ranks dead last in run defense. If Kansas City can actually move the chains on the ground, it'll go a long way toward restoring the rest of their attack.</li></ul><h2>X factor to watch</h2>\n<p>While speedsters like <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/26730787/xavier-worthy/\">Xavier Worthy</a> and <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/2804128/marquise-brown/\">Marquise Brown</a> have taken turns nursing injuries in the Chiefs' pass-catching corps, Mahomes has quickly built at least some rapport with Thornton, the ex-New England <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/NE/new-england-patriots/\">Patriots</a> prospect who originally came aboard via the practice squad last November. He ranks third behind only Brown and <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/1725130/travis-kelce/\">Travis Kelce</a> in targets (9) and yards (100) as a legitimate field-stretcher, averaging a whopping 25 yards per reception. He should have additional opportunities to go deep against New York.</p><h2>Chiefs vs. Giants prediction, pick</h2>\n<p>Which Giants team is the real one: the Week 1 squad that had almost no offensive life against the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/WAS/washington-commanders/\">Washington Commanders</a>, or the Week 2 underdog that kept launching the rock against the Cowboys? The truth, as usual, probably lies somewhere in the middle. This still paints a middling picture, considering New York was supposed to have a stingy defense thanks to a bolstered front seven.</p>\n<p>Can edge rushers like <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/28890311/abdul-carter/\">Abdul Carter</a> and <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/2253012/brian-burns/\">Brian Burns</a> terrorize Mahomes the same way the Eagles got after the three-time champion in Week 2? It's possible. But a Giants win probably also requires Wilson feeding Nabers at a similar rate as he did against Dallas. Or sluggish ball carriers like <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/2963637/tyrone-tracy-jr/\">Tyrone Tracy Jr</a>. and <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/2241251/devin-singletary/\">Devin Singletary</a> suddenly springing to life. It wouldn't stun us to see the G-Men make this a ballgame, but we're not betting on the Chiefs -- now desperate for a spark -- dropping three straight games until we witness it. <em><strong>Pick: Chiefs 27, Giants 22 | Giants +6, Over 45.5</strong></em></p>\n            </div>\n    </div>\n</article>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n                        </div>"

The former LSU standout burst onto the NFL scene as a rookie for the New York Giants in 2024, logging 109 receptions for 1,204 yards and seven touchdowns over 15 games. He set a franchise rookie record for catches and earned a Pro Bowl selection.</p><p>In the early part of 2025, Nabers has already made a strong impact with 14 catches for 238 yards and two touchdowns through two games. In Week 2 against the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/DAL/dallas-cowboys/\">Dallas Cowboys</a>, he finished with 9 receptions for 167 yards and two scores.

    "body": "<div>\n        <p>The first month of the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://cbssports.com/nfl/\">NFL</a> season isn't even over yet and it looks like a few teams out there might already be eliminated from postseason contention. At least from an unofficial standpoint. With that, they're now going to have to defy NFL history if they want to somehow bounce back to make the playoffs. </p><p>Starting 0-3 is the kiss of death in the NFL and six teams have reached that mark this year: The Miami Dolphins, the Houston Texans, the New York Jets, the Tennessee Titans, the New York Giants and the New Orleans Saints. Those six teams haven't officially been eliminated from the NFL playoff race, but they might as well be, because we almost never see teams recover from an 0-3 record to make the playoffs. </p><p>Since the NFL schedule was expanded to 17 games in 2021, NO team has lost their first three games and rebounded to make the postseason. There have been 13 teams that have started 0-3 over the past four years and out of that group, only two teams have even finished with a winning record: The 2021 <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/IND/indianapolis-colts/\">Colts</a> and 2024 <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/CIN/cincinnati-bengals/\">Bengals</a> both finished 9-8, but didn't make the playoffs. </p><p>When it comes to this year's 0-3 teams, two of them had high hopes for the season (Miami and Houston) while the other four (Jets, Titans, Saints and Giants) weren't expected to do much. </p>\n<p>The problem with starting 0-3 is that you leave yourself with no margin for error. If any of these teams want to have a shot at the postseason, they'll likely have to go 10-4 over their final 14 games, which is a tall task. </p><p>For instance, let's look at the Dolphins. They still have to play the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/LAC/los-angeles-chargers/\">Chargers</a> (Week 6), <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/BAL/baltimore-ravens/\">Ravens</a> (Week 9) and <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/WAS/washington-commanders/\">Commanders</a> (Week 10) along with another game against the Bills that will come in Week 11. If they were to lose those four, they'd have to go 10-0 on the rest of their schedule. </p><p>On the Texans' end, they still have games left against the Ravens (Week 5), Seahawks (Week 7), 49ers (Week 8), Broncos (Week 9), Bills (Week 12), Chiefs (Week 14), Chargers (Week 17) and Colts (Week 18). </p>\n<p>Although getting to the playoffs after an 0-3 start is unlikely, it has been done. Since the NFL expanded to 12 playoff teams in 1990, there have been 165 teams that have started 0-3 and exactly four of them went on to make the playoffs, which means 2.4% of teams have pulled off the miracle feat. The group of four is the 1992 Chargers, 1995 <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/DET/detroit-lions/\">Lions</a>, 1998 Bills, 2018 <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/HOU/houston-texans/\">Texans</a>. However, no team has pulled off the feat since the NFL expanded the playoffs to 14 teams in 2020. </p><p>The Texans have done it once, so maybe they can do it again. </p><p>As a matter of fact, out of the four 0-3 teams that have made the postseason since 1990, the Texans are the only one that have pulled off the feat this century. That Texans team lost each their first three games by seven points or less, so they were just a few plays away from starting 3-0. They also played in a very winnable AFC South division. </p><p>Out of our four 0-3 teams this year, the Texans are the only one that has lost each game by one score. </p>\n<p>One team that won't be starting 0-3 this year is the Kansas City Chiefs. The reigning AFC champs were 0-2 heading into Week 3, but they were able to avoid the dreaded 0-3 start by beating the Giants, 22-9, on Sunday night. </p>\n            </div>"

These teams met at M&amp;T Bank Stadium less than two years ago as the Ravens won 38-6 against a Lions team that would end up in that year's NFC Title Game.

    "body": "<div>\n        <p>It's the final week of the Fantasy season, and there's very little chance you're going to win or lose your season based on who you add on the waiver wire this week. But you still might have some holes to fill in your lineup, and we're here to help you find the best options. There is going to be a lot of overlap here in this final week waiver-wire column with Scott White's Week 27 <span><a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/fantasy/baseball/news/fantasy-baseball-week-27-preview-top-10-sleeper-hitters-include-isaac-paredes-moises-ballesteros/\" target=\"_blank\">sleeper hitters</a></span> and <span><a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/fantasy/baseball/news/fantasy-baseball-week-27-preview-top-10-sleeper-pitchers-feature-justin-verlander-and-emmet-sheehan/\" target=\"_blank\">sleeper pitchers</a></span>, because all that matters is the impact a player can make this week. </p><p>At least, that's the case for those of you in redraft leagues.</p><p>For those of you in keeper or Dynasty leagues, it's worth scouring your waiver-wire for some forgotten players who might be worth keeping around with an eye on 2026. Depth isn't going to matter after this week, so if you have a few players you <em>know</em> you won't want to hang on to for 2026 sitting around on the bench, you should be putting in some last-week bids on players you <em>might </em>want to keep around for 2026, so in addition to a target for every position for the final week, I've included a stash candidate to consider at every position with an eye on 2026 who might be available in some of your leagues. </p><p>Here's we're looking to add ahead of Week 27: </p><h3>Catchers</h3><p><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/players/28837122/moises-ballesteros/fantasy/\">Moises Ballesteros</a>, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/teams/CHC/chicago-cubs/\">Cubs</a> (15%) – It's not entirely clear what Ballesteros' usage is going to look like for the final week, as he sat two of three games this weekend. But he has started eight of 10 since coming back from the minors while showing the strong contact skills and power that have made him one of the best catching prospects in the game. He won't be catcher eligible to open the 2026 season, so let's use him now. </p><p><strong>Stash? </strong><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/players/26719697/joe-mack/fantasy/\">Joe Mack</a>, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/teams/MIA/miami-marlins/\">Marlins</a> (2%) – <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/players/29085042/agustin-ramirez/fantasy/\">Agustin Ramirez</a> is more of a DH long term, and Mack has hit .257/.338/.475 with 21 homers and nine steals as a 22-year-old across the two highest levels of the minors. He could matter in Roto leagues as soon as next March.</p>\n<h3>First Base</h3><p><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/players/26911664/kyle-manzardo/fantasy/\">Kyle Manzardo</a>, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/teams/CLE/cleveland-guardians/\">Guardians</a> (52%) – Manzardo has an .833 OPS since the All-Star break while starting four of the past six against left-handed pitchers. I could see him sitting out Tuesday's game against <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/players/3126008/tarik-skubal/fantasy/\">Tarik Skubal</a>, but otherwise, he should be in the lineup every other game for the final week. </p><p><strong>Stash? </strong><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/players/2942989/triston-casas/fantasy/\">Triston Casas</a>, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/teams/BOS/boston-red-sox/\">Red Sox</a> (20%) – It's not just prospects we can stash! I think it's unlikely Casas returns to the Red Sox next season, and a fresh start is probably not a bad thing in this instance. He'll be coming back from a ruptured patella and has been mildly disappointing in his <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://cbssports.com/mlb/\">MLB</a> career, but I still think there's 30-plus homer potential here as a mid-career breakout.</p><h3>Second base</h3><p><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/players/28841190/caleb-durbin/fantasy/\">Caleb Durbin</a>, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/teams/MIL/milwaukee-brewers/\">Brewers</a> (46%) – I wanted to include <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/players/29075767/sal-stewart/fantasy/\">Sal Stewart</a> here, but he found himself squeezed out of the team's lineup this weekend, making him a risky start. So we'll go with Durbin, who has some playing time concerns in the always-crowded Brewers lineup but who has played pretty regularly in the second half and has an .855 OPS in September with five steals. </p><p><strong>Stash? </strong><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/players/29426030/travis-bazzana/fantasy/\">Travis Bazzana</a>, Guardians (25%) – Bazzana has been a disappointment as a pro, making less contact than expected without a ton of power. Still, he's held his own as a 22-year-old at Triple-A and the No. 1 pick in last year's draft certainly could be in line for an Opening Day job next season.</p><h3>Third base</h3><p><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/players/2910610/isaac-paredes/fantasy/\">Isaac Paredes</a>, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/teams/HOU/houston-astros/\">Astros</a> (65%) – Paredes made an unexpected return from the IL this weekend and struggled, going 1 for 7 with five strikeouts. There might not be enough time for Paredes to get back up to speed, but he was obviously a must-start player before the injury, so I think I'd still be willing to roll the dice on him this week.</p><p><strong>Stash? </strong><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/players/26720082/jordan-lawlar/fantasy/\">Jordan Lawlar</a>, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/teams/ARI/arizona-diamondbacks/\">Diamondbacks</a> (30%) – We're still waiting for him to do it at the MLB level, but Lawlar's long-term outlook hasn't changed because of less than 100 plate appearances in the majors. If anything, his struggles make sure he'll be very reasonably priced for 2026, and I'll be buying a lot of him with my late-round picks.</p><h3>Shortstop</h3><p><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/players/26608279/ha-seong-kim/fantasy/\">Ha-seong Kim</a>, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/teams/SD/san-diego-padres/\">Padres</a> (20%) – Kim homered for the second time in three games Sunday and is now hitting .313/.370/.469 since getting to the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/teams/ATL/atlanta-braves/\">Braves</a>. He's a solid fit in a MI spot especially. </p><p><strong>Stash? </strong><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/players/29426036/jj-wetherholt/fantasy/\">JJ Wetherholt</a>, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/teams/STL/st-louis-cardinals/\">Cardinals</a> (25%) – Wetherholt never ended up getting the call, but that's not because he failed to make the case – the 22-year-old former first-rounder hit .309/.415/.547 at Triple-A. The Cardinals should clear up some of the glut on their roster this offseason, in part to make room for Wetherholt to be on the Opening Day roster.</p><h3>Outfield</h3><p><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/players/29155725/dylan-crews/fantasy/\">Dylan Crews</a>, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/teams/WAS/washington-nationals/\">Nationals</a> (61%) – Crews has been more useful lately, going 6 for 23 with three steals over his past six games. We're still waiting for some signs of the huge upside the former top prospect was supposed to have, but with good matchups on the way for the Nationals, he's a viable option for the final week, at least.</p>\n<p><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/players/26911693/daylen-lile/fantasy/\">Daylen Lile</a>, Nationals (31%) – Sharing an outfield with some of the most hyped outfield prospects of the past few years, it's the relatively unheralded Lile who has been a difference maker for the Nationals down the stretch, hitting .378/.432/.757 so far in September. With those same matchups on the way for Lile, he's one of the best hot-hand plays out there if you are inclined to go that route. </p><p><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/players/29096117/zach-cole/fantasy/\">Zach Cole</a>, Astros (5%) – It's just a question of whether Cole will make enough contact. So far, he hasn't, with a 39% strikeout rate in his first eight games. But there's real power here, and enough speed to chip in a few steals in a best-case scenario, making Cole an intriguing option for deeper categories leagues. </p><p><strong>Stash? </strong><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/players/26913049/emmanuel-rodriguez/fantasy/\">Emmanuel Rodriguez</a>, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/teams/MIN/minnesota-twins/\">Twins</a> (20%) – Rodriguez has had a lot of trouble staying healthy, but he's managed to be a productive hitter with athleticism and huge on-base skills. He could absolutely play his way onto the team's Opening Day lineup next season and be an unorthodox lineup setter with power and speed.</p><h3>Starting pitcher</h3><p>Emmett Sheehan, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/teams/LAD/los-angeles-dodgers/\">Dodgers</a> (61%) – Sheehan looks like he's putting it all together, with 32 strikeouts to just six walks in 24.1 innings here in September. And he's scheduled to close out the season with one more start in Seattle, one of the best parks in baseball for pitchers. He needs to be in basically all lineups at this point. </p><p><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/players/29426049/trey-yesavage/fantasy/\">Trey Yesavage</a>, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/teams/TOR/toronto-blue-jays/\">Blue Jays</a> (40%) – Yesavage's second start was nowhere near as good as his first, as he stumbled and gave up four runs to the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/teams/KC/kansas-city-royals/\">Royals</a> Sunday. You're hoping for more, obviously, but that won't necessarily scare me off of a start against the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/teams/TB/tampa-bay-rays/\">Rays</a> next weekend. </p><p><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/players/2910637/cristian-javier/fantasy/\">Cristian Javier</a>, Astros (48%) – Javier hasn't had great results yet, but the underlying numbers indicate he's been better than the 4.45 ERA, with walks being the primary issue so far. He closes out the regular season with a very beatable <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/teams/ATH/athletics/\">Athletics</a> lineup, albeit with some real risk given the ballpark in Sacramento. But with the way Javier has gotten back to producing weak contact coming off elbow surgery, I think he's a worthwhile risk. </p><p><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/players/29321990/luis-morales/fantasy/\">Luis Morales</a>, Athletics (65%) – Morales has struggled a bit lately after a real impressive run to open his career, with 10 runs over his past 15.2 innings of work. But he is coming off a quality start and will close his rookie season out with a start against the Royals, a beatable matchup for a talented pitcher. </p><p><strong>Stash? </strong><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/players/26615394/jared-jones/fantasy/\">Jared Jones</a>, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/teams/PIT/pittsburgh-pirates/\">Pirates</a> (21%) – Jones is recovering from surgery to repair the UCL in his right elbow, and he could be ready for Opening Day after being cleared to throw in recent days – Pirates direction of sports medicine Todd Tomczyk said Jones is aiming for \"game-line situations\" between March and May of next year. Looking at <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/players/2837573/spencer-strider/fantasy/\">Spencer Strider</a>, there's no guarantee he'll be a difference maker, but if you've got a keeper spot to play with, Jones could be back early enough to make it worthwhile.</p><h3>Relief pitcher</h3><p><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/players/26615397/ian-seymour/fantasy/\">Ian Seymour</a>, Rays (48%) – Seymour has been one of the most pleasant surprises of the second half, emerging as a useful option for the Rays rotation after standing out in the bullpen. He has a 1.65 ERA in three September starts and is now in line for two starts against the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/teams/BAL/baltimore-orioles/\">Orioles</a> and Blue Jays this week, making him one of the best streaming options and an excellent SPaRP for the final week. </p>\n<p><strong>Stash? </strong><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/players/26912489/abner-uribe/fantasy/\">Abner Uribe</a>, Brewers (54%) – Uribe was supposed to be a standout after <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/players/2919567/trevor-megill/fantasy/\">Trevor Megill</a>'s elbow injury, but he has just one save so far in the month of September. That's not Uribe's fault, as he continues to pitch incredibly well. Megill figures to be back next season, but he's also never thrown more than 50 innings in a major-league season and missed more than a month this season with his elbow injury, so Uribe could absolutely figure into the team's closer plans for 2026.</p>\n            </div>"

    "body": "<div>\n        <p>Football players come in all shapes and sizes, and Sunday, football <em>touchdowns</em> came in all shapes and sizes, too. Across the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://cbssports.com/nfl/\">NFL</a>, there were nine touchdowns scored by either the defense or special teams. It's the most in a Week since Week 12, 2020 ... and they all came in a single day!</p><p>There's even more to like. Sunday was the first day in <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://cbssports.com/nfl/\">NFL</a><em> history</em> that there were multiple interception return touchdowns, multiple fumble blocked field goal return touchdowns<em> and</em> multiple punt return touchdowns. Like I said, all shapes and sizes.</p><p>As with any touchdown -- but especially with these types of scores -- there's a balance of credit to the scoring team and blame to the team that gave up the touchdown. But this is why teams spend so much time on these scenarios that are often seen as simple and straightforward. One-player breakdowns can lead to a team-wide failure. The smallest of tendencies can be picked up by an eagle-eyed coach and taken advantage of. As we saw Sunday, it can swing outcomes and maybe swing seasons.</p><p>With so many unexpected scores from unexpected sources, we decided to rank all nine non-offensive touchdowns from Sunday. They're all special, of course, but some were more special than others.</p>\n<h2>9. <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/2818965/kenny-moore/\">Kenny Moore</a> II's 32-yard interception return touchdown vs. <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/TEN/tennessee-titans/\">Titans</a></h2>\n<p>They don't get a whole lot easier than this. <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/3168422/cam-ward/\">Cam Ward</a> is late -- and throwing flat-footed -- on a checkdown, and Moore waltzes in for the fourth pick six of his career. That's tied with Bobby Boyd for second-most in team history, only behind Jerry Logan. What a career for Moore, a former undrafted rookie out of Valdosta State, and what a start for the 3-0 <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/IND/indianapolis-colts/\">Colts</a>.</p><h2>8. <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/3177046/chau-smith-wades/\">Chau Smith-Wade's</a> 11-yard interception return touchdown vs. <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/ATL/atlanta-falcons/\">Falcons</a></h2>\n<p>Smith-Wade at least had to drive on this ball and make a catch over his head, making it more difficult than Moore's. Still, this one came in a similar scenario: a late throw on a checkdown out wide: a recipe for disaster. The <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/CAR/carolina-panthers/\">Panthers</a>' 30-0 win over the Falcons was the fourth-largest shutout win in franchise history.</p><p>Shout out to Alex Faust for getting the \"Shaw\" pronunciation correct, too.</p><h2>7. <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/2179803/jamel-deans/\">Jamel Dean's</a> 55-yard interception return touchdown vs. <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/NYJ/new-york-jets/\">Jets</a></h2>\n<p>Late, flat-footed throw out wide? Where have we seen that before? We give Dean the top spot among all three pick sixes of Week 3 because of his drive on the ball and the length of the return.</p>\n<h2>6. <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/3162484/jaylin-lanes/\">Jaylin Lane's</a> 90-yard punt return touchdown vs. <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/LV/las-vegas-raiders/\">Raiders</a></h2>\n<p>Lane's 90-yarder -- his first career NFL touchdown -- tied the franchise record for longest punt return touchdown. The fourth-round pick out of Virginia Tech was drafted to bring speed and return ability, and both were on clear and obvious display on this one. He's the first rookie to record a punt return touchdown for the team since Desmond Howard in 1992.</p><h2>5. <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/3165177/tory-hortons/\">Tory Horton's</a> 95-yard punt return touchdown vs. <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/NO/new-orleans-saints/\">Saints</a></h2>\n<p>Horton comes in just ahead of Lane because ...</p><ol><li>It was 5 yards longer</li><li>It was a franchise record for longest punt return touchdown, not just a tie for it</li><li>Check out the block <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/SEA/seattle-seahawks/\">Seahawks</a> linebacker <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/2239572/chazz-surratt/\">Chazz Surratt</a> puts on Saints punter <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/3169769/kai-kroeger/\">Kai Kroeger</a></li></ol><p>Like Lane, Horton was drafted to bring speed to an offense badly in need of some on the outside. As it turns out, that speed carries over to special teams, too.</p><p>This is the first week in NFL history multiple rookies had a punt return touchdown of 90+ yards.</p><h2>4. <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/2261492/isaiah-rodgers/\">Isaiah Rodgers</a>' 87-yard pick six of <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/2180355/jake-browning/\">Jake Browning</a></h2>\n<p>That is some explosive speed for Rodgers, who wasn't touched after escaping <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/2809208/tee-higgins/\">Tee Higgins</a>' ankle tackle attempt. This was a really great play, and credit <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/1265468/harrison-smith/\">Harrison Smith</a> for the deflection. But it wasn't<em> quite</em> as great as ...</p><h2>3. Isaiah Rodgers' 66-yard fumble return touchdown vs. <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/CIN/cincinnati-bengals/\">Bengals</a></h2>\n<p>We give Rodgers' second defensive touchdown of the day the edge over his first one because he also forced the fumble.</p><p>It's worth wondering if this is the best defensive game ever played. According to the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/MIN/minnesota-vikings/\">Vikings</a>' postgame notes, Rodgers is the only player in NFL history with a pick six of 85+ yards and a fumble return touchdown of 65+ yards in the same game. He's the only player since at least 2000 with two forced fumbles and two defensive touchdowns in a single game.</p><p>Take a bow, Isaiah Rodgers.</p><h2>2. <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/2962588/will-mcdonald-ivs/\">Will McDonald IV's</a> 50-yard blocked field goal return touchdown</h2>\n<p>The leap. The block. The recovery. The score. I think that's the order of the most impressive parts of this play. Overall, it's a masterpiece. So many times, the players trying to leap over the line use \"leverage,\" which is a personal foul. McDonald did it perfectly. Yes, the Jets ended up losing, but that doesn't take away the shine of this individual play, which was brilliant.</p><h2>1. <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/26540135/jordan-davis/\">Jordan Davis</a>' 61-yard blocked field goal return touchdown </h2>\n<p>Oh. My. Goodness. This is one of my favorite touchdowns ever. Why? At 336 pounds, Davis is the heaviest player in NFL history to return a blocked field goal at lest 50 yards for a touchdown. He also ran a top speed of 18.59 miles per hour on this return, a truly absurd number and a testament to just how incredibly athletic NFL players are.</p><p>The only people who<em> won't</em> love this play? Well, anyone associated with the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/LAR/los-angeles-rams/\">Rams</a> for one ... and <span><a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/news/eagles-pull-off-remarkable-19-point-comeback-vs-rams-cover-the-spread-on-final-play-with-ultimate-bad-beat/\" target=\"_blank\">Rams bettors for two</a></span>. The Rams were 3.5-point underdogs. They led by 19. They trailed by one and were kicking for the win on the final play. And somehow, they not only lost, but they failed to cover.</p>\n            </div>"
