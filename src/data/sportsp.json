    "body": "<div>\n        <p>Aaron Glenn didn't wait until the film review to let the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/NYJ/new-york-jets/\">New York Jets</a> know how he felt about Monday night's performance. The first-year coach reportedly unloaded on his players after the 27-21 loss to the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/MIA/miami-dolphins/\">Miami Dolphins</a>, delivering a fiery locker room tirade <a href=\"https://x.com/RichCimini/status/1972850061882327403\" target=\"_blank\">that was loud enough to be heard in the nearby media room</a>.</p><p>The outburst capped another frustrating night for the Jets, who dropped to 0-4 for the first time since 2020. Glenn's anger was fueled by a sloppy performance that included three turnovers, 13 penalties and yet another week without a defensive takeaway.</p><p>\"Very disappointing, very disappointing,\" <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/live/kr4_cVS4xao?si=I3PbvK758IJqzvK1\" target=\"_blank\">Glenn said postgame</a>. There is no way you can win any game with 13 penalties and three turnovers. It just can't happen.\"</p><p>The mistakes started early. On the first offensive drive, running back <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/26726580/braelon-allen/\">Braelon Allen</a> fumbled at the goal line after an 82-yard march that seemed poised to set the tone. Quarterback <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/1273205/justin-fields/\">Justin Fields</a> coughed up the ball on the next possession and <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/2253479/isaiah-williams/\">Isaiah Williams</a> lost a fumble on a kickoff return to open the second half. Miami cashed in those miscues for 14 points.</p>\n<p>The lack of discipline carried over to the line of scrimmage, where the Jets were flagged 13 times for 101 yards including nine on offense, five of them before the snap.</p><p>Jets wide receiver <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/3123864/garrett-wilson/\">Garrett Wilson</a> said Glenn's postgame message centered on the \"penalties and self-inflicted wounds\" that continue to stall New York's progress.</p><p>\"It was obvious, but it still has to be said because we're still not doing it right,\" <a href=\"https://youtu.be/vP2euojGda4?si=-PPkVo8XN3F1aek-\" target=\"_blank\">Wilson said</a>. \"We're talking about it, we're talking about it and we're talking about it. [Limiting penalties] is the first thing we talk about when we get in the locker room, so let's fix it next week. If we don't fix it next week, it's ridiculous.\"</p>\n<p>The Jets rank among the league's sloppiest teams, sitting 10th in penalties assessed this season. They're also the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://cbssports.com/nfl/\">NFL's</a> only defense without a takeaway and own a minus-7 turnover margin, the worst in the league.</p><p>\"But what we have to do is get back to work,\" Glenn said. \"That's the only way that we can fix them. Really, take a look at these penalties and take a look at these turnovers. And make sure we understand, before you can win games, you have to learn how not to lose games. And we have to do a better job in that case, and we will.\"</p><p>Next up is the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/DAL/dallas-cowboys/\">Dallas Cowboys</a> at MetLife Stadium, where Glenn will try to avoid becoming the first coach in franchise history to start his tenure 0-5.</p>\n            </div>"

Team medical personnel put an air cast on Hill's leg and the former All-Pro waved to the crowd and smiled as he was carted off to the locker room.</p><p>Dolphins coach Mike McDaniel said after the game that Hill was undergoing further testing.</p><p>\"He was probably in the best spirits of any player that I've ever seen [have] such a terrible experience,\" McDaniel said. \"He immediately had wide eyes and was talking, 'I'm good, just make sure the guys get this win.' He was focused on the team.\"</p>\n<p>Hill's fourth season in Miami ends with 21 catches for 265 yards and a touchdown. </p><p><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/2741209/tua-tagovailoa/\">Tua Tagovailoa</a> losing his top threat in the passing game is unfortunate for a Dolphins team that, for the first time this season, appeared to play with confidence Monday night during their first win.</p><p>Tight end <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/1850793/darren-waller/\">Darren Waller</a> caught two touchdowns during his first start of the season.</p>\n<p>\"I feel like there will be a lot of guys in the receiver room that will have more opportunities to make plays.

Yes, I'm declaring Aaron Judge the best hitter in baseball, with all due respect to Ohtani and what Raleigh has done this year. Judge led the majors in batting average (.331), on-base percentage (.457) and slugging percentage (.688). He homered 53 times, drove home 114 and scored 137 runs.  <p>   It isn't just Judge, though. Cody Bellinger had a big year. Trent Grisham had probably the most unlikely breakout season of anyone, finishing with 34 home runs. Jazz Chisholm Jr. was a 30-30 guy. Ben Rice and Austin Wells both topped 20 home runs. And a now-healthy Giancarlo Stanton hit .273/.350/.594 with 24 home runs and 66 RBI in only 77 games.\"</p></em></li></ul><p>One team not in the conversation is the <strong>Mets</strong>, after the team suffered a brutal collapse and missed the playoffs entirely.

The difference came down to turnovers (and the Jets committing 13 penalties for 101 yards), with New York losing three fumbles in the game, leading to a 27-21 loss in an otherwise winnable game. Miami now has a chance to enjoy picking up their first win of the season, but likely will have to figure out how to navigate the rest of the year after the aforementioned injury to Hill. </p><p>In the other \"MNF\" game, the <strong>Joe Burrow</strong>-less <strong>Bengals</strong> managed just a field goal in a 28-3 road game loss to the <strong>Broncos</strong>.

And while that's certainly part of the problem, it goes deeper than <strong>Jake Browning</strong>. The Bengals repeatedly shot themselves in the foot with mistakes that had little to do with QB play. They committed 11 accepted penalties -- six on offense (mostly on the offensive line), one on defense and four on special teams. That's undisciplined football, and it falls squarely on coach <strong>Zac Taylor</strong>. On top of that, the defense couldn't get off the field, allowing Denver to rack up 512 yards of total offense.

Saturday's win over LSU provided a glimpse into a team that plays together under the little engine that could -- quarterback Trinidad Chambliss. He was precise on money down situations and Ole Miss showed an ability to run the football with power against a formidable unit. Many of us thought last season's team was the one Lane Kiffin would direct to the program's first playoff appearance, but this 2025 group is even better as a whole. The one loss for Ole Miss, I think, comes at Oklahoma or on the road against Mississippi State in the Egg Bowl.</p><div>\n                            <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/teams/OREG/oregon-ducks/\">\n    <figure><img alt=\"team logo\" src=\"https://sports.cbsimg.net/fly/images/team-logos/761.svg\" /></figure>\n                                                </a>\n                    </div>\n    <h3>4. Oregon</h3><p><strong>Projected final record</strong>: 12-1</p><p>At the end of the season, we might be looking at Oregon's win over Penn State on the road as college football's most significant this fall. It's one of those quality victories that's wrapped in a bow for the selection committee when it comes down to seeding. In this projection, the Ducks' only loss comes to Ohio State in the Big Ten title game.</p><div>\n                            <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/teams/TXTECH/texas-tech-red-raiders/\">\n    <figure><img alt=\"team logo\" src=\"https://sports.cbsimg.net/fly/images/team-logos/859.svg\" /></figure>\n                                                </a>\n                    </div>\n    <h3>5. Texas Tech (Big 12 champion)</h3><p><strong>Projected final record</strong>: 12-1</p><p>Unpredictability within the Big 12 is rampant through Week 5, but there's still four unbeatens. Iowa State, BYU and Houston join the Red Raiders atop of the league standings and we're going to see most of those play each other in the coming weeks. Texas Tech and Houston square off Saturday. Defending league champion Arizona State is 2-0 in the conference and has posted three consecutive wins since a stunning loss at Mississippi State. Don't forget about Kenny Dillingham's program.</p>\n<h3><ul><div>\n                            <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/teams/BAMA/alabama-crimson-tide/\">\n    <figure><img alt=\"team logo\" src=\"https://sports.cbsimg.net/fly/images/team-logos/457.svg\" /></figure>\n                                                </a>\n                    </div>\n    <li>6. Alabama</li></ul></h3><p><strong>Projected final record</strong>: 11-2</p><p>The win at Georgia not only strengthens the Crimson Tide's hopes of reaching the SEC Championship, but it's going to be an important tiebreaker of sorts when the dust clears in late November after rivalry weekend. If Ty Simpson continues his red-hot play, this Alabama team is capable of winning out to face Ole Miss in Atlanta. If that happens, that would be six nationally-ranked wins this fall for Kalen DeBoer, regardless of what happens inside Mercedes-Benz Stadium.</p><div>\n                            <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/teams/TEXAS/texas-longhorns/\">\n    <figure><img alt=\"team logo\" src=\"https://sports.cbsimg.net/fly/images/team-logos/853.svg\" /></figure>\n                                                </a>\n                    </div>\n    <h3>7. Texas </h3><p><strong>Projected final record</strong>: 10-2</p><p>Should the Longhorns finish with 10 wins, Alabama would get the tiebreaker bid in the SEC title matchup over Texas under this scenario -- Steve Sarkisian's lone conference loss comes at Georgia on Nov. 15. The league would then move to common opponents and Alabama would hold that factor over the Longhorns. First things first -- Arch Manning and this team have to avoid the upset at Florida this weekend ahead of the showdown with Oklahoma in two weeks.</p><div>\n                            <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/teams/UGA/georgia-bulldogs/\">\n    <figure><img alt=\"team logo\" src=\"https://sports.cbsimg.net/fly/images/team-logos/599.svg\" /></figure>\n                                                </a>\n                    </div>\n    <h3>8. Georgia</h3><p><strong>Projected final record</strong>: 10-2</p><p>Kirby Smart's team will suffer another trip-up somewhere during conference play that will keep the Bulldogs from getting back to the conference title game, but they'll be back in the playoff nonetheless. Defensively, Georgia has to improve. In back to back contests, the secondary has been gashed -- much of that due to a lack of pass rush up front.</p>\n<div>\n                            <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/teams/PSU/penn-state-nittany-lions/\">\n    <figure><img alt=\"team logo\" src=\"https://sports.cbsimg.net/fly/images/team-logos/765.svg\" /></figure>\n                                                </a>\n                    </div>\n    <h3>9. Penn State</h3><p><strong>Projected final record</strong>: 10-2</p><p>The Nittany Lions were<em> supposed</em> to beat Oregon as a home favorite in a White Out environment. It didn't happen. That means the next three games are paramount prior to a clash at Ohio State on Nov. 1. If James Franklin extends his losing steak to the Buckeyes, the home bout with Indiana the following weekend is a must-win. A three-loss Penn State will not make the playoff this season. Ten wins is the magic number for the Nittany Lions.</p><div>\n                            <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/teams/TXAM/texas-am-aggies/\">\n    <figure><img alt=\"team logo\" src=\"https://sports.cbsimg.net/fly/images/team-logos/854.svg\" /></figure>\n                                                </a>\n                    </div>\n    <h3>10. Texas A&M</h3><p><strong>Projected final record</strong>: 10-2</p><p>Another 10-win SEC team that will be in the middle of a hodgepodge of elites, final month losses at Missouri and Texas will take the Aggies out of the conference championship picture. All hope would not be lost, however. Texas A&M's early-season win over Notre Dame would be one of two victories over ranked competition and could be the determining factor in one of the committee's final at-large seeds.</p><div>\n                            <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/teams/IND/indiana-hoosiers/\">\n    <figure><img alt=\"team logo\" src=\"https://sports.cbsimg.net/fly/images/team-logos/629.svg\" /></figure>\n                                                </a>\n                    </div>\n    <h3>11. Indiana</h3><p><strong>Projected final record</strong>: 10-2</p><p>With only one win over a top 25 team after whipping Illinois by 50 points, Curt Cignetti's program gets back to the playoff as long as it can avoid an upset loss the rest of the way. Unbeaten through five weeks, the Hoosiers will likely take losses at Oregon and Penn State. If they're able to split those, higher-seed possibilities await.</p>\n<div>\n                            <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/teams/SFLA/south-florida-bulls/\">\n    <figure><img alt=\"team logo\" src=\"https://sports.cbsimg.net/fly/images/team-logos/818.svg\" /></figure>\n                                                </a>\n                    </div>\n    <h3>12. South Florida (Group of Five champion)</h3><p><strong>Projected final record</strong>: 11-2</p><p>There's a couple possible losses upcoming for the Bulls that could derail American title hopes like North Texas and Memphis on the road, but for not, USF's the placeholder in the 12-spot as the projected Group of Five champion.</p><p>13. Tennessee </p><p>14. Notre Dame</p><p>15. Iowa State</p><p>16. Vanderbilt </p><p>17. Missouri</p><p>18. Georgia Tech</p><p>19. Oklahoma</p><p>20. LSU</p><p>21. Memphis</p><p>22. Florida State</p><p>23. Tulane</p><p>24. TCU</p><p>25. BYU</p><h2>Projected first round playoff games</h2><ul><li>No. 9 Penn State at No. 8 Georgia</li><li>No. 10 Texas A&M at No. 7 Texas</li><li>No. 11 Indiana at No. 6 Alabama</li><li>No. 12 South Florida at No. 5 Texas Tech</li></ul><p>When there's five potential SEC teams in the bracket, avoiding a first-round rematch might be unavoidable. In this scenario, it would be extremely unfortunate if the Aggies and Longhorns played each other again a couple weeks after battling during rivalry weekend. Last season's matchup determined who played Georgia in the SEC Championship. The 2025 installment may have similar stakes.</p><h2>LSU begins drifting away from bracket</h2><p>There's a chance the Tigers (4-1, 1-1) could lose each of their <span><a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/news/how-will-lsu-brian-kelly-rebound-after-narrative-setting-loss-whats-next-for-tigers-in-sec-cfp-pictures/\" target=\"_blank\">remaining four games in the SEC against top 20</a></span> competition this season if they don't find a way to better protect quarterback Garrett Nussmeier and find some semblance of a rushing attack. The loss at Ole Miss revealed much of what we already knew about LSU -- eventually, the offense was going to have to generate explosives since the defense had carried the team through the first quarter of the campaign. October showdowns with Vanderbilt and Oklahoma will determine if the Tigers have staying power in the playoff mix or if Brian Kelly's season ends in a whimper.</p>\n            </div>"

Hill -- who was immediately hospitalized after dislocating his knee in the second quarter of Monday's game -- has continued to display positivity in his conversations with teammates. </p><p>One of Hill's teammates, offensive tackle <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/1767688/terron-armstead/\">Terron Armstead</a>, posted a message on X stating that Hill \"is in good spirits\" while explaining the reasoning behind Hill's smiles as he exited the field. </p>\n<p>As expected, Hill was a major topic following Miami's first win of the season.

Waddle said that Hill encouraged him to keep his head in the game as he was getting carted off the field. </p><p>\"He gives us everything he's got every time he's out there,\" Waddle said. \"He brings the best out of not just me, but the whole team, the whole offense. He's just a high energy guy.\"</p>\n<p>It will obviously take more than just one player to replace Hill's production and everything else he brings to the Dolphins' offense.

He's gonna help us out a lot.\" </p><p>As far as Hill is concerned, it's obviously unknown as to when he will play football again. That, however, did not appear to be on Hill's mind upon suffering the injury. He was instead focused on his team getting its first win of the 2025 season, which they ultimately did despite his absence. </p>\n<p>\"He was probably in the best spirits of any player that I've ever seen (have) such a terrible experience,\" said Dolphins coach Mike McDaniel. \"He immediately had wide eyes and was talking, 'I'm good, just make sure the guys get this win.' He was focused on the team.\"</p>\n            </div>"

    "body": "<div>\n        <p>A month into the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://cbssports.com/nfl/\">NFL</a> season has passed, and the league is starting to shape itself out with the contenders and pretenders. This is the point in the season where teams are starting to set themselves up for a playoff run or wonder if the 2025 campaign is a lost cause. </p><p>For some teams, the page may already be turning to 2026. Teams have moved on from coaches early in the season in the past as some firings have come by October (as that month starts this week), moving on from a poor start to 2025. Yes, some teams have experienced miserable starts to the season. </p><p>There is certainly a better gauge regarding which coaches are on the hot seat, and for them it doesn't get any easier. With all the coaching turnover in the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://cbssports.com/nfl/\">NFL</a> every season, it's fair to ponder which coaches won't be able to finish the 2025 campaign -- or last past this year. </p><p>So which coaches are on the proverbial hot seat through four weeks in 2025, and is there anything they can do to save their job? </p>\n<p>There is still time to salvage the year, but time is of the essence. These are the coaches that are under the microscope in the second batch of hot seat rankings for 2025. </p><h2>1. Brian Callahan (<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/TEN/tennessee-titans/\">Tennessee Titans</a>)</h2><ul><li><strong>2025 record:</strong> 0-4</li><li><strong>Career record:</strong> 3-18 (.143 win percentage)</li><li><strong>Previous ranking:</strong> 3</li></ul><p>The <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/HOU/houston-texans/\">Houston Texans</a> are a lot better than the Tennessee Titans, but Tennessee was just shut out by a previously winless football team. <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/3168422/cam-ward/\">Cam Ward</a> is 31st in touchdown rate (1.3%), 32nd in yards per attempt (4.9), and 31st in passer rating (63.9), and has been sacked a league-high 17 times. </p><p>The Titans are 28th in points per possession (1.16) and 32nd in offensive points per game (12.8). This team doesn't have a good roster, but a team with the No. 1 overall pick at quarterback should be better. Maybe Ward isn't good, but what is Callahan doing to make him better? The offense lacks creativity and the play-calling isn't set up for a rookie quarterback to succeed. The offensive line isn't exactly good either.</p>\n<p>Callahan has a lot of flaws as a coach, the the team isn't improving. Tennessee may be the worst team in the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://cbssports.com/nfl/\">NFL</a>, and the clock is ticking. </p><h2>2. Mike McDaniel (<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/MIA/miami-dolphins/\">Miami Dolphins</a>)</h2><ul><li><strong>2025 record: 1-3</strong></li><li><strong>Career record:</strong> 29-26 (.526 win percentage)</li><li><strong>Previous ranking:</strong> 1</li></ul><p>The Dolphins played hard against the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/BUF/buffalo-bills/\">Bills</a> in Week 3, which was enough to justify McDaniel buying some time to save the sinking ship that is Miami. The schedule does get easier after Week 4, with Carolina and Cleveland being two of the next three games.</p><p>Miami needed a win against the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/NYJ/new-york-jets/\">Jets</a> and got it, saving McDaniels's job for the time being. Hate to call these next few games a  \"must win\" for the Dolphins, but they are for McDaniel if he wants to be this team's coach by November. Miami needs to just rack up wins against the bad teams, which is typically what McDaniel has been good at throughout his career.</p>\n<p>This stretch is a strong test for McDaniel's future in Miami. The Dolphins appear to be getting ready to move on, no matter what the organization says publicly. These last two games have been promising. </p><h2>3. Dave Canales (<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/CAR/carolina-panthers/\">Carolina Panthers</a>)</h2><ul><li><strong>2025 record:</strong> 1-3</li><li><strong>Career record:</strong> 6-15 (.286 win percentage)</li><li><strong>Previous ranking:</strong> 4</li></ul><p>The Panthers are a bad football team, yet played above their talent level in a shocking shutout of the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/ATL/atlanta-falcons/\">Atlanta Falcons</a> in Week 3. Outside of that, the Panthers defense have given up 31.7 points per game in those three games (yet are sixth in points allowed per possession at 2.08). Perhaps Canales is getting the most out of this group, but then this team lays a massive egg against the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/NE/new-england-patriots/\">New England Patriots</a> of all teams. </p><p>Carolina is 27th in offensive points per game (17.0) and 19th in points per possession (1.82). <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/3161957/bryce-young/\">Bryce Young</a> is 25th in touchdown rate (3.5%) and 28th in passer rating (77.1). Perhaps tis is who Young is and Canales can't change it. </p>\n<p>Why is Canales in danger? The Panthers have unstable ownership in David Tepper with a quick trigger. They are a bad team in a bad division, a clear bottom dweller in the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://cbssports.com/nfl/\">NFL</a>. If Carolina hits the reset button, Canales may not survive the rebuild. </p><h2>4. Brian Daboll (<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/NYG/new-york-giants/\">New York Giants</a>)</h2><ul><li><strong>2025 record:</strong> 1-3</li><li><strong>Career record:</strong> 19-35-1 (.355 win percentage)</li><li><strong>Previous ranking:</strong> 2</li></ul><p>Daboll and the Giants needed a victory and it came against the previously unbeaten <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/LAC/los-angeles-chargers/\">Chargers</a>. The Giants head coach pulled the plug on <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/1272242/russell-wilson/\">Russell Wilson</a> in order to save his job and went to <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/26694019/jaxson-dart/\">Jaxson Dart</a>, who injected some life in the offense and the football team as a whole.</p><p>Losing <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/26697761/malik-nabers/\">Malik Nabers</a> will significantly hurt Daboll and the Giants offense, and Dart's development. This may not help Daboll going forward, as he needs Dart to develop and show progress in order to justify coming back for 2026.</p>\n<p>The Giants aren't the worst team in football. Again, the injuries and schedule aren't helping. </p><h2>5. Aaron Glenn (New York Jets)</h2><ul><li><strong>2025 record:</strong> 0-4</li><li><strong>Career record:</strong> 0-4 (.000 win percentage)</li><li><strong>Previous ranking:</strong> N/A</li></ul><p>Glenn's start as an NFL head coach could not have been any worse. The Jets were going to be a bad team, but they are 0-4 after four games and look like one of the worst teams in the NFL. Glenn preached all summer about making the team more accountable and fixing all the issues that haunted the franchise in the past, but the Jets are worse. </p><p>The Jets are sloppy, undisciplined, and not smart. Where's the accountability here? How quick will Glenn's act wear thin ina  locker room where his message already appears to not be heard? Could he be a one-and-done head coach? </p>\n<p>New York can still turn things around, but Glenn hasn't delivered on what he promised. </p><h2>6. Zac Taylor (Cincinnati Bengals)</h2><ul><li><strong>2025 record:</strong> 2-2</li><li><strong>Career record:</strong> 48-54-1 (.471 win percentage)</li><li><strong>Previous ranking:</strong> N/A</li></ul><p>Until the last two games existed, there was no reason to put Taylor on the hot seat. Even though the Bengals lost Joe Burrow, they avenged the slow starts that plagued the franchise and were 2-0 on the year. Cincinnati is 0-2 since, and the Bengals are seriously exposing Taylor in the process. </p><p>Cincinnati ranks last in offensive points per game in the two games without Burrow (6.5), while Browning has thrown for just 265 yards with one touchdown and two interceptions (66.6 passer rating). The Bengals have failed to eclipse 175 total yards in back-to-back games for the first time since 1971, and they now have more such games (three) than the rest of the league combined.</p>\n<p>Taylor is an offensive coach right? This is his seventh season coaching right? Has this franchise really been carried by Burrow? </p><p>The past two weeks have not been good for Taylor, who may not have a job for long if this team doesn't improve. Cincinnati is terrible without Burrow, which is an indictment of Taylor as a coach. This isn't the same Bengals team that survived without Burrow in each of the last two years. </p><h2>7. Kevin Stefanski (<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/CLE/cleveland-browns/\">Cleveland Browns</a>)</h2><ul><li><strong>2025 record:</strong> 1-3</li><li><strong>Career record:</strong> 41-47 (.466 win percentage)</li><li><strong>Previous ranking:</strong> 5</li></ul><p>Perhaps Stefanski should pull the Daboll route and go with <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/3121534/dillon-gabriel/\">Dillon Gabriel</a> soon, even though he was not a first-round pick. <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/1250697/joe-flacco/\">Joe Flacco</a> has been horrid, which should be expected given that he's 40 years old and doesn't have much to work with. </p>\n<p>The Browns have a win because of how good their defense is, not an offense that is 29th in points per possession (1.24) and 31st in offensive points per game (14.0). Again, the only reason Stefanski is on this list is because of the Browns' failure of a front office with the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/2133482/deshaun-watson/\">Deshaun Watson</a> contract -- which crippled other areas of the roster over the last few years. </p><p>This team doesn't have a quarterback, and has to see what Gabriel can do. This is going to cost Stefanski at some point, even though he has a good coach. </p><h2>8. Jonathan Gannon (<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/ARI/arizona-cardinals/\">Arizona Cardinals</a>)</h2><ul><li><strong>2025 record:</strong> 2-2</li><li><strong>Career record:</strong> 14-24 (.368 win percentage)</li><li><strong>Previous ranking:</strong> N/A</li></ul><p>The Cardinals were a sleeper team for the playoffs, and still are at this point in the season, but they have the lowest strength of victory in the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://cbssports.com/nfl/\">NFL</a> (.125) and have just a .438 strength of schedule so far. Arizona lost by a combined total of four points to San Francisco and Seattle, two division games the Cardinals had to have.</p>\n<p>The Cardinals need to be better than \"close enough\" this season, needing more than two wins against bad teams like the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/NO/new-orleans-saints/\">Saints</a> and Panthers. Gannon won't help his stock against the titans this week, but wins over the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/IND/indianapolis-colts/\">colts</a> and <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/GB/green-bay-packers/\">Packers</a> coming up could get the stage for this team for the remainder of the year. </p><p>Arizona beat two bad teams and had close losses two good teams. The jury is still out on the Cardinals, and Gannon. </p><h2>9. John Harbaugh (<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/BAL/baltimore-ravens/\">Baltimore Ravens</a>)</h2><ul><li><strong>2025 record:</strong> 1-3</li><li><strong>Career record:</strong> 173-107 (.618 win percentage)</li><li><strong>Previous ranking:</strong> N/A</li></ul><p>Let's call a spade a spade here. There is a 0.01% chance Harbaugh will be fired by the Ravens after the 2025 season, and the percentage is even lower if <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/2239671/lamar-jackson/\">Lamar Jackson</a> misses a significant amount of team. So why is Harbaugh here in the first place? </p><p>The Ravens season is on the verge of disaster. The defense has been atrocious, not being able to stop any team with a competent quarterback. They are dropping star players on defense like flies, and Jackson's injury could be the final nail in the coffin. Baltimore needs Jackson if it wants to make a run at the playoffs, and can't wina  title without him.</p><p>The only way Harbaugh is out of Baltimore is if he retires. He's too good of a coach to not get another chance to get things right with the Ravens, despite his in-game decisions in 2025. </p>\n            </div>"

With the Dolphins being located in South Florida, the team decided to create a \"dark water\" jersey and helmet combination. </p>\n<p>Although the uniforms appear to be black, they ARE NOT quite that dark. According to the team, the <a href=\"https://www.palmbeachpost.com/story/sports/nfl/dolphins/2025/08/28/dolphins-rivalry-jerseys-vote-best-nfl-uniforms/85866241007/\" target=\"_blank\">official color</a> here is \"Dark pitch blue,\" so yes, that means the jersey and helmet are both a very dark shade of blue. </p><p>The Dolphins are wearing the uniforms for the first time in their Monday night game against the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/NYJ/new-york-jets/\">New York Jets</a>, which kicks off at 7:15 p.m. ET on ESPN. You can see a few more photos of the uniform and helmet below. </p>\n<p>Even the cheerleaders got new uniforms for the game. </p>\n<p>The Dolphins <a href=\"https://www.miamidolphins.com/rivalries/\" target=\"_blank\">teamed up with Nike</a> to create the new uniform with a design that is \"unlike any before, featuring dark aquatic tones made to represent a team who hunts in dark waters. Complete with orange accents and sleek dark blue touches throughout.\"</p>\n<p>With the Monday game being played in Miami, the Dolphins will be celebrating their new uniform by giving their field a new look. The end zones will be painted dark pitch blue while the lettering in each end zone will feature aqua letters with orange accents. </p>\n<p>In the photo below, you can get a better look of both the end zone and the midfield logo. </p>\n<p>The Dolphins are one of eight teams that will be participating in the \"Rivalries\" program this year.

These divisional rivals are both winless on the season, and only one team in league history has ever made the postseason after an 0-4 start. Miami (0-3) fell 31-21 to Buffalo in its most recent contest last Thursday, making it 0-3 for the first time since 2019. New York lost 29-27 in Week 3 to Tampa, as the Jets are 0-3 for the fourth time since 2019, which is the most in the NFL over that span. Cornerback and new acquisition Jarvis Brownlee (ankle) and edge Jermaine Johnson (edge) are out for New York.</p><p>Kickoff is at 7:15 p.m. ET from Hard Rock Stadium in Miami Gardens, Fla., where the home team has won nine straight meetings with the Jets.

That includes four straight Miami defeats at home in primetime, and the team has lost five of its last six MNF appearances overall. Also, the mini-bye that Miami is coming off after playing last Thursday doesn't appear to help their chances of covering as the Dolphins are 0-4 against the spread with a rest advantage since the start of 2024.</p><p>The Jets have a potent running attack with a number of talented backs, plus mobility with the quarterback position with Justin Fields cleared from the concussion protocol. The team entered Week 4 ranking in the top 10 in both rushing yards per game and rushing scores, despite <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/3123469/breece-hall/\">Breece Hall</a> yet to find the end zone in 2025. Than run game should undoubtedly get boosted by the pass game, as that's what Miami's defense tends to do for opponents. The Dolphins are first team since the merger to allow nine total touchdowns and zero turnovers to their opposing starting quarterbacks in each of the team's first three games. <a href=\"https://www.sportsline.com/insiders/jets-vs-dolphins-prediction-line-odds-proven-model-releases-spread-pick-for-2025-nfl-week-4-monday-night-football/#ttag=09282025_agg_cbssports_picks_football_nfl_model_JetsDolphinsMNF\" target=\"_blank\">See which team to back at SportsLine</a>. </p><h2>Why the Dolphins can cover</h2><p>Playing at home has certainly been an advantage for the Dolphins in this series as they've won nine straight home matchups with the Jets. All of them have been by more than the spread of 2.5 points as the Dolphins have a 10.4-point average margin of victory during this run. Additionally, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/2741209/tua-tagovailoa/\">Tua Tagovailoa</a> has had success versus his divisional rival no matter where the games have taken place as the quarterback is undefeated in five starts against the Jets, including averaging 277.5 passing yards, a 76% completion rate and a 3:0 TD:INT over his last two versus New York.</p><p>The Dolphins offense has come to life after an eight-point Week 1, particularly the run game, as the team rushed for 130 yards last week versus Buffalo. Miami is averaging 5.4 yards per carry on the year, which ranks fourth in the NFL, while the team ranks No. 1 in third-down conversion percentage and fourth in redzone scoring. That offense can take advantage of deficiencies with the Jets defense, as New York hasn't had a takeaway, ranks in the bottom 10 in run defense and is in the bottom five in scoring defense. <a href=\"https://www.sportsline.com/insiders/jets-vs-dolphins-prediction-line-odds-proven-model-releases-spread-pick-for-2025-nfl-week-4-monday-night-football/#ttag=09282025_agg_cbssports_picks_football_nfl_model_JetsDolphinsMNF\" target=\"_blank\">See which team to back at SportsLine</a>. </p><p><em>Check out the latest </em><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/betting/news/betmgm-promo-code/\"><em>BetMGM promo code</em></a><em> CBSSPORTS, where new users can </em><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://martech.cbssports.com/bt/redirect/prod?b=betmgm&c=sport\"><em>get up to $1,500 in bonus bets if your first bet loses</em></a><em>.</em></p><h2>How to make Jets vs. Dolphins picks</h2><p>For this NFL Week 4 Monday Night Football game of Dolphins vs. Jets, the model is leaning over the total, projecting 50 combined points.

Jaxson Dart picked up a win in his first start, but the Giants also lost their best offensive player in losing Malik Nabers for the season. New York had just 89 team passing yards on Sunday, while the team averaged 243.3 passing yards with Russell Wilson under center. Even with the boost that Dart provided, New York still struggles immensely on the other side of the ball, ranking 30th in both total defense and run defense.</p><p>It's that run defense which could be an issue in the Superdome as the Saints have a top-10 rushing offense. The Saints are coming off covering versus the Bills in which three different players had at least 49 rushing yards, and New Orleans had 189 yards on the ground as a team. The Saints have also racked up three-plus sacks in three of four games this year, while Dart was taken down five times in his starting debut. The model projects New Orleans to have four QB takedowns as it stifles New York's offense, allowing the Saints to cover at home 60% of the time. <a href=\"https://www.sportsline.com/insiders/nfl-odds-lines-spreads-2025-week-5-picks-predictions-from-proven-model/#ttag=09292025_agg_cbssports_picks_football_nfl_model_Week5nflodds\" target=\"_blank\">See which other teams to pick here</a>.</p>\n<p>Another one of its Week 5 NFL predictions: Cardinals (-9.5 41.5) cover versus Tennessee in over 50% of simulations. Arizona will have some extra rest after playing last Thursday, and no one has performed better versus the spread against non-conference opponents. The Cardinals have covered in seven straight games versus the AFC, while Tennessee is 0-6 ATS versus the NFC since the start of last season. The Titans have dropped three straight overall versus the spread, meaning they've picked up where they left off last year as their 3-18 spread record since 2024 is the worst in the NFL.</p><p>Tennessee was shut out, 26-0, by the previously winless Texans on Sunday, as the Titans have lost 10 straight games overall. They rank last in both points scored and yards gained, while sitting 26th in points allowed and yards allowed. Arizona has the No. 5 scoring defense and the No. 8 run defense, which could make the Titans overly rely on top pick Cam Ward. However, he just posted both his lowest passer rating and completion percentage as he's yet to throw a touchdown in two road starts. The model also says the Over hits nearly 70% of the time. <a href=\"https://www.sportsline.com/insiders/nfl-odds-lines-spreads-2025-week-5-picks-predictions-from-proven-model/#ttag=09292025_agg_cbssports_picks_football_nfl_model_Week5nflodds\" target=\"_blank\">See which other teams to pick here</a>.</p>\n<h3>How to make Week 5 NFL picks</h3><p>The model has also made the call on who wins and covers in every other game on the Week 5 NFL schedule and just revealed four coveted A-rated spread picks, potentially giving you a huge payday. <a href=\"https://www.sportsline.com/insiders/nfl-odds-lines-spreads-2025-week-5-picks-predictions-from-proven-model/#ttag=09292025_agg_cbssports_picks_football_nfl_model_Week5nflodds\" target=\"_blank\">You can only get every pick for every game at SportsLine</a>.</p><p><strong>So what Week 5 NFL picks can you make with confidence, and which four teams should you lock in now?

    "body": "<div>\n        <p>While the \"Monday Night Football' doubleheader slate didn't look promising, plenty of storylines emerged. The <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/NYJ/new-york-jets/\">New York Jets</a> and <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/CIN/cincinnati-bengals/\">Cincinnati Bengals</a> are spiraling, the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/MIA/miami-dolphins/\">Miami Dolphins</a> may be trying to save Mike McDaniels' job and the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/DEN/denver-broncos/\">Denver Broncos</a> might actually be way better than their record suggests.</p><p>Even in victory, though, Miami has to wonder about <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/2131163/tyreek-hills/\">Tyreek Hill's</a> future after he went down with a serious knee injury. Meanwhile, the Jets may have taken the lead in the race for worst team in the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://cbssports.com/nfl/\">NFL</a> -- at least until the Joe Burrow-less Bengals made their case.</p><p>Let's dive into the biggest topics from Monday night, deciding which are overreactions and which are reality.</p><h2>Tyreek Hill won't play an NFL down again after knee injury</h2>\n<p><strong>Overreaction or Reality:</strong> Overreaction</p><p>There is a chance Hill could return after his gruesome knee injury in the Dolphins' win over the Jets, but the process of getting back to this level of play is going to be extremely long. Watching Hill on the ground was difficult, especially for a player who has been dominant catching the deep ball for over a decade.</p>\n<p>Hill hasn't been the same player for more than a year now, averaging just 58.3 receiving yards per game over his last two seasons. In his first two years in Miami, he averaged 106.3 yards per game. The decline was already happening before this injury.</p><p>Does this mean Hill will never see the field again? <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/2963970/tank-dell/\">Tank Dell</a> suffered a similar injury last season and still hasn't returned. </p><p>Hill may not be the same player when he comes back, but it will be impressive if he does.</p>\n<a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/news/tyreek-hill-injury-dolphins-wr-carted-off-with-gruesome-knee-injury-vs-jets-on-monday-night-football/\" target=\"_blank\">\n        <div>\n            <div>\n                <p>Tyreek Hill injury: Dolphins star WR dislocates knee -- what it means for his future and Miami's season</p>\n                <p>\n                    Zachary Pereles                </p>\n            </div>\n                            <div>\n    <figure><img alt=\"Tyreek Hill injury: Dolphins star WR dislocates knee -- what it means for his future and Miami's season\" src=\"https://sportshub.cbsistatic.com/i/r/2025/09/30/71319496-72e0-4a1b-91dc-d04d0350385f/thumbnail/270x152/79662b64937245e806123442144efe71/tyreek-injury-imagn.png\" /></figure>\n                </div>\n                    </div>\n    </a>\n<h2><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/2179798/joe-burrow/\">Joe Burrow</a> is the only reason Zac Taylor has a job</h2><p><strong>Overreaction or Reality:</strong> Reality</p>\n<p>Two games without Joe Burrow, and the Bengals offense is in complete disarray. After a 2-0 start, Burrow suffered turf toe and may be sidelined for more than three months. In his place, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/2180355/jake-browning/\">Jake Browning</a> has struggled, and the Bengals have been downright awful.</p><p>Cincinnati ranks last in offensive points per game (6.5), while Browning has thrown for just 265 yards with one touchdown and two interceptions (66.6 passer rating). The Bengals have failed to eclipse 175 total yards in back-to-back games for the first time since 1971, and they now have more such games (three) than the rest of the league combined.</p><p>Without Burrow, this franchise is just an afterthought -- a damning indictment of head coach Zac Taylor. We may finally be seeing who Taylor really is without Burrow, even though the Bengals have survived stretches without him in the past. This may be the point of no return.</p>\n<h2>Broncos are the best 2-2 team in the NFL</h2>\n<p><strong>Overreaction or Reality:</strong> Reality</p><p>Of all the 2-2 teams, the Broncos may have the strongest case as the best of the bunch. Both of their losses came on game-winning field goals as time expired, and they are the only team in the NFL that has not trailed in the fourth quarter with time on the clock this season.</p><p>Another reason Denver can make that claim? The defense has allowed fewer than 160 yards in two of its first four games and currently boasts the league's best red zone defense (25.0%). The Broncos also rank third in opponents' completion rate at 57.5%.</p><p>If the Broncos can upset the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/PHI/philadelphia-eagles/\">Eagles</a>, a run could be on the horizon. After Philadelphia, Denver plays five consecutive games against teams below .500. This team is better than its record indicates. </p>\n<h2>Aaron Glenn will be a one-and-done coach </h2>\n<p><strong>Overreaction or Reality:</strong> Overreaction</p><p>This has been a rough start for Glenn, who was considered one of the better head-coaching hires of the offseason. The former Jets cornerback returned to the franchise after a successful stint with the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/DET/detroit-lions/\">Lions</a> as their defensive coordinator, promising to clean up the mistakes that have haunted the franchise for decades.</p><p>Instead, the Jets look worse than ever. They are sloppy and undisciplined, committing 13 penalties for 111 yards in Monday's loss to the Dolphins. This isn't a smart football team either, and one has to wonder how long Glenn's accountability act will last if his team keeps losing.</p><p>Screaming and yelling can only take a coach so far, especially with a roster this thin on talent. The Jets don't take care of the football, and they don't know how to get off the field.</p>\n<p>Glenn could still turn it around -- and it's worth remembering he's only four games into his career. But the Jets need to improve soon.</p>\n            </div>"

Yet Mike Tomlin has done it again. This was supposed to be the year his streak of 18 straight seasons without a losing record was in jeopardy. The year Aaron Rodgers looked like an aging quarterback. The year the Steelers were looking up at the Ravens and Bengals.</p><p>Four games in, it's Pittsburgh looking down on everybody else. The three other teams are battling issues and injuries at quarterback, while the Steelers head into their bye in first place with Rodgers playing good football.</p><p>It's way too early to declare the Steelers division champs, but has anything you've seen from the other three teams in the division given hope that they can run them down right now?</p>\n<p>The Steelers beat the Minnesota Vikings, 24-21, in Dublin on Sunday behind solid play from Rodgers, combined with a defense that had six sacks and two takeaways. The running game, always a Steelers staple, showed signs of life with 131 yards on 29 carries.</p><p>Pittsburgh is up to ninth in my Power Rankings this week. After the bye, it's a home game against the Cleveland Browns, followed by a road game against the Joe Burrow-less Cincinnati Bengals. That looks like 5-1 to me, and if that happens, Tomlin's streak certainly will hold up this year.</p><p>The Steelers waited for Rodgers to decide to play this summer when they courted him, and they have to be glad they did. This team with Mason Rudolph might be 1-3. With Rodgers, it's 3-1 and leading the division.</p><p>One more thing: The young offensive line is coming together nicely, which should be good for the offense going forward. The Steelers will improve on that side of the ball as the running game continues to grow.</p>\n<p>The Steelers' way has always been to run the ball, play good defense and get after the quarterback. They did that against the Vikings, serving notice that they are a true threat in the AFC North -- and maybe beyond. </p><div><p>\n        Biggest Movers\n    </p><div><p><span></span><span></span><span>\n                10\n            </span><span>\n                Seahawks\n            </span></p><p><span></span><span></span><span>\n                8\n            </span><span>\n                Commanders\n            </span></p></div><div><table><thead><tr><th><p>Rk</p></th><th><p>Teams</p></th><th>\n                    </th><th><p>Chg</p></th><th><p>Rcrd</p></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><span>\n                                1\n                            </span></td><td><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/PHI/philadelphia-eagles/\"><div><figure><img alt=\"team logo\" src=\"https://sports.cbsimg.net/fly/images/team-logos/425.svg\" /></figure></div><span>\n                                    Eagles\n                                </span></a></td><td>\n                            They made it interesting in Tampa, but the sign of a good team is winning games on the road against good teams.

We may not know more until Toronto submits its Division Series roster. </p>\n<div>\n                            <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/teams/BOS/boston-red-sox/\">\n    <figure><img alt=\"team logo\" src=\"https://sports.cbsimg.net/fly/images/team-logos/303.svg\" /></figure>\n                                                </a>\n                    </div>\n    <h2><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/players/2000027/lucas-giolito/\">Lucas Giolito</a>, Red Sox</h2>\n<p>Giolito has been a steadying presence in the Boston rotation behind ace <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/players/2836763/garrett-crochet/\">Garrett Crochet</a>, but he won't be available in the upcoming first-round duel with the Yankees. \"Lucas is not going to be on the roster,\" manager Alex Cora <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.masslive.com/redsox/2025/09/lucas-giolito-has-elbow-injury-wont-be-on-red-sox-wild-card-series-roster-vs-yankees.html\">told reporters</a> on Monday. \"He has been battling with his elbow the last few days.

Many of those concerns flow from Horton's uncertain status. The rookie has been the Cubs' best starting pitcher on a rate basis by a significant margin, but a rib fracture has laid him up and will cause him to miss the clash with the Padres. No doubt, Horton's status will be revisited should the Cubs advance, but in the meantime his absence will be keenly felt on the North Side of Chicago. </p>\n<div>\n                            <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/teams/LAD/los-angeles-dodgers/\">\n    <figure><img alt=\"team logo\" src=\"https://sports.cbsimg.net/fly/images/team-logos/321.svg\" /></figure>\n                                                </a>\n                    </div>\n    <h2><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/players/2250617/will-smith/\">Will Smith</a>, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/teams/LAD/los-angeles-dodgers/\">Dodgers</a></h2>\n<p>The stalwart Dodger catcher in 2025 enjoyed his best-ever season at the plate. However, Smith suffered what was first believed to be a bone contusion in his hand, but that was eventually revealed to be a hairline fracture. He hasn't played since Sept. 9 and has played in only one game since Sept. 3. At this point, it's looking unlikely that Smith will be rostered for the Dodgers' Wild Card Series matchup with the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/teams/CIN/cincinnati-reds/\">Reds</a>. If the Dodgers advance and Smith is able to later in the postseason, it's possible such an injury will still compromise him at the plate. </p><div>\n                            <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/teams/PHI/philadelphia-phillies/\">\n    <figure><img alt=\"team logo\" src=\"https://sports.cbsimg.net/fly/images/team-logos/324.svg\" /></figure>\n                                                </a>\n                    </div>\n    <h2><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/players/1744777/zack-wheeler/\">Zack Wheeler</a>, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/teams/PHI/philadelphia-phillies/\">Phillies</a></h2>\n<p>Here's the crushing-est crushing blow of all. Wheeler has been one of the very best starting pitchers in all of baseball across his entire Phillies tenure, and this season was no exception. Lamentably, a blood clot in his shoulder required season-ending surgery, and we won't see Wheeler on a mound again until next season. From the Phillies' standpoint, they have two 200-strikeout arms (Christopher Sánchez and Jesús Luzardo), plus stalwart Ranger Suárez who have stepped into the breach, but there's no way you can lose a moundsman like Wheeler and not feel it. </p><div>\n                            <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/teams/MIL/milwaukee-brewers/\">\n    <figure><img alt=\"team logo\" src=\"https://sports.cbsimg.net/fly/images/team-logos/308.svg\" /></figure>\n                                                </a>\n                    </div>\n    <h2><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/players/2449977/brandon-woodruff/\">Brandon Woodruff</a>, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/teams/MIL/milwaukee-brewers/\">Brewers</a></h2>\n<p>Woodruff's comeback from major shoulder surgery had been going swimmingly and then some until a lat injury landed him on the injured list on Sept. 21. As the best team in the NL (and all of baseball), the Brewers have a first-round bye, which means they don't have to submit their first postseason roster until the day of Game 1 of their Division Series. Woodruff would not have been a go for the Wild Card Series, but his status for the next round isn't known yet. No doubt, Milwaukee is holding out hope.  </p>\n<div>\n                            <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/teams/SEA/seattle-mariners/\">\n    <figure><img alt=\"team logo\" src=\"https://sports.cbsimg.net/fly/images/team-logos/312.svg\" /></figure>\n                                                </a>\n                    </div>\n    <h2><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/players/29075489/bryan-woo/\">Bryan Woo</a>, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/teams/SEA/seattle-mariners/\">Mariners</a></h2>\n<p>When healthy, Woo has been Seattle's best starting pitcher in 2025, at both the run-prevention and underlying levels. So when he succumbed to a pectoral injury on Sept. 19, it was a serious and concerning blow to the Mariners' title hopes. They have a bye, so there's time yet for Woo to get healthy. Lead exec Jerry Dipoto recently <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://x.com/SeattleSports/status/1972423572728553486\">struck an optimistic tone</a> about Woo's chances of being ready for ALDS Game 1, so things appear to be trending in the right direction for Seattle and their ace. </p><hr /><p>The list above does not include the likes of <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/players/2135249/trea-turner/\">Trea Turner</a> of the Phillies (hamstring) and <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/players/2184352/kyle-tucker/\">Kyle Tucker</a> of the Cubs (calf), who each very recently returned from injury but may still be compromised to some extent by the aftereffects of those injuries. They, like all of the names above, merit your attention as the playoffs unfurl. </p>\n            </div>"
