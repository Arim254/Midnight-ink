Oregon ranks No. 5 in the nation at 48 points per game, and the Ducks are coming off a 41-7 win over Oregon State last week. The Ducks rank fifth in yards per rush (6.8) and ninth in rushing yards per game (256) this fall. Meanwhile, they also rank fifth in yards per pass (10.0), dominating in both the passing and rushing attacks. The model projects Oregon to win in 45% of simulations, while the Ducks' +142 odds give an implied odds of 41.32%, projecting value in this play at DraftKings.</p><h2>Alabama (+2.5) vs. Georgia (-108)</h2><p>Alabama is 9-1 over its last 10 games against Georgia, and 44-26-4 all-time in their rivalry as two of the consistently top programs in college football. Despite Georgia being home and the No. 5 team in the nation, while Alabama ranks 17th, a program like the Crimson Tide can never be overlooked. Alabama scheduled itself two weeks to prepare for this matchup with a bye last week following its 38-14 win over Wisconsin to improve to 2-1 this season. Georgia is also coming off a bye, but the Bulldogs had a challenging 44-41 overtime victory over Tennessee the last time they took the field. Alabama junior quarterback Ty Simpson threw for 382 yards and four touchdowns against Wisconsin as he appears more confident as the Crimson Tide QB1, and Simpson has nine touchdowns compared to zero interceptions this season. The model projects Alabama to cover the spread in 53% of simulations.</p><h2>Diamondbacks vs. Padres Over 7.5 total runs (-107)</h2><p>Arizona was eliminated from the postseason following its 7-4 loss to the Padres on Friday, but the model still projects offensive success from these two clubs. The Diamondbacks are the No. 4 scoring team (4.91 runs per game), and they've gone Over this total in five straight games, including on Friday. The Padres are starting Michael King, who is two starts removed from allowing eight runs over three innings to the Mets on Sept. 16, and he's making just his fifth start since mid-May following a knee injury. The Diamondbacks are starting Eduardo Rodriguez, who allowed four runs in four innings to the Padres in July when he last faced San Diego. The model projects the Over to hit in 63% of simulations.</p><h2>Want more MLB picks and college football picks for Saturday?</h2><p><strong>You've seen the model's Saturday best bets.

    "body": "<div>\n<p>Since 1950, more than 960 players have played quarterback in the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://cbssports.com/nfl/\">NFL</a>. And only one has started a season 3-0 while completing 70.0% of his passes, compiling 850-plus total yards, accounting for at least six touchdowns and committing zero turnovers. That quarterback is not Tom Brady or Drew Brees. It is neither Peyton Manning nor Brett Favre.</p><p>That quarterback is the Indianapolis Colts' Daniel Jones.</p><p>Yes, a player who was waived last season by the quarterback-starved New York Giants, is having a historic start to the season. And the numbers behind Jones' season don't stop there:</p><ul><li>He is the third quarterback since 1950 to start 3-0, averaging 9-plus yards per attempt and committing zero turnovers. The other two quarterbacks were Alex Smith (2017) and Patrick Mahomes (2018).</li><li>He has more wins (three) than negative plays (sacks, fumbles and interceptions) this season (two).</li><li>He is the only quarterback in the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://cbssports.com/nfl/superbowl/\">Super Bowl</a> era with three passing touchdowns, three rushing touchdowns and zero turnovers in the first three games of a season.<br /></li><li>He has two games this season in which the Colts had zero punts and zero turnovers. Manning had one such game in his entire Colts career (227 starts including the playoffs).<br /></li></ul><p>\"Obviously it's one of the toughest positions in all of sports to play,\" Indianapolis head coach Shane Steichen said earlier this week, \"and [Jones] is doing it right now as good as it gets.\"</p><p>SportsLine's player prop expert Alex Selesnick believes Jones' success will continue for at least one more week. So Selesnick, who is up $2,784 on all prop picks since 2021, has made Jones Over 212.5 total passing yards (-111) on Sunday against the Rams as <a href=\"https://www.sportsline.com/insiders/five-week-4-nfl-player-props-best-bets-from-sportsline-expert/\" target=\"_blank\">one of his five best player prop bets for NFL's Week 4</a>.</p><p>\"This line is simply too low considering how well Jones has played and his bevy of weapons,\" Selesnick told SportsLine. \"And this game has the highest projected total on the slate. This game has serious shootout potential, and I credit Shane Steichen, who has really tailored an offense around Jones' best attributes, which are his mobility and ability to use play action and RPO. I'm comfortable playing this line up to 224.5.\"</p><p>The quarterback nicknamed Indiana Jones has completely reversed his career trajectory. The former No. 6 overall pick in the 2019 <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://cbssports.com/nfl/draft/\">NFL Draft</a>, Jones started four seasons for the Giants and led the team to the playoffs in 2022, the franchise's first postseason appearance since the 2016 season. He then signed a four-year, $160 million with the team.</p><p>But then he went 1-5 as the starter in an injury-plagued 2023 season and 2-8 last year and was benched in favor of Tommy DeVito. New York's notoriously tough fans and media made life difficult on Jones, who asked for—and was granted—his release from the team. In the offseason he signed a one-year, $14 million contract with the Colts, who were looking for a quarterback to compete with former first round pick Anthony Richardson. </p><p>Jones has usurped Richardson—and then some. And now entering Week 4, Jones ranks second in the odds to win the Comeback Player of the Year award, at +300, behind only San Francisco 49ers running back Christian McCaffrey (+135).</p><p>\"I think [Jones] is just seeing it really well,\" Steichen said earlier this week. \"He's seeing it really well, getting us in and out of the right plays, delivering the ball with accuracy. He's playing freaking really good right now.\"</p>\n            </div>"

    "body": "<div>\n<p>Coming up with a winning NFL DFS strategy can go in many different directions, but a popular one is targeting games with the highest totals when searching for NFL DFS picks. The three highest over/unders of the week will all kick off on Sunday afternoon with Rams vs. Colts, Chiefs vs. Ravens and Bears vs. Raiders. Thus, you can expect stars like Puka Nacua, Jonathan Taylor, Patrick Mahomes, Lamar Jackson, Rome Odunze and Brock Bowers to comprise many daily Fantasy football lineups.</p><p>Players of that caliber, however, will set back your NFL DFS salary cup, forcing you to search for more economical options to pair with them. Should the likes of Luther Burden or Tyquan Thornton find their way into your receiver slots for Sunday's main slate? Will underperforming players like Isiah Pacheco or Ashton Jeanty finally live up to their price tags on NFL DFS sites? Three weeks of games gives us enough of a sample size to notice player trends, which could aid in setting NFL daily Fantasy lineups. </p><p><em>Before making any NFL DFS picks for Sunday or locking in NFL DFS lineups on sites like DraftKings and FanDuel, be sure to </em><a href=\"https://www.sportsline.com/nfl/daily-fantasy/optimizer/#ttag=09252025_agg_cbssports_dfs_football_nfl_Optimizer_NFLDFSWeek4Sunday\" target=\"_blank\"><em>check out SportsLine's advanced NFL DFS Lineup Optimizer</em></a><em>.</em></p><p>The DFS Optimizer uses info from the SportsLine Advanced-Data Projection Model and DFS Professional Millionaire Mike McClure to identify top DFS picks/plays for any slate on betting apps like <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/betting/news/draftkings-promo-code/\">DraftKings</a> and <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/betting/news/fanduel-promo-code/\">FanDuel</a>.

The Heisman winner is coming off his best game as a pro, in multiple ways, as he matched a career high of four touchdown passes while also avoiding being sacked for the first time as a Bear. Despite a subpar win-loss record, Williams has an outstanding 25:3 TD:INT over his last 17 starts, averaging 213.3 passing yards and 30.5 rushing yards.</p><p>Chicago heads to Vegas on Sunday, and the Raiders' defense is the type which should allow Williams to continue his stellar individual play. The Raiders have the 24th-ranked pass defense and just allowed a backup in Marcus Mariota to have 207 yards and a touchdown thru the air, plus 40 yards and another score on the ground. Prior to that, Vegas allowed Justin Herbert to have a pair of touchdown passes in Week 2, and in the season opener, Drake Maye had 300 yards of total offense versus the Raiders. <a href=\"https://www.sportsline.com/nfl/daily-fantasy/optimizer/#ttag=09252025_agg_cbssports_dfs_football_nfl_Optimizer_NFLDFSWeek4Sunday\" target=\"_blank\">See who else to pick here</a>.</p><p>The Optimizer's NFL DFS strategy also includes rostering 49ers wideout Ricky Pearsall ($5,700 on DraftKings and $6,300 on FanDuel). A year ago at this time, Pearsall was recovering from being shot, but now he's the Niners' No. 1 receiver and one of the most productive wideouts in the league. He ranks third with 281 receiving yards as he's performed whether Brock Purdy or Mac Jones is throwing him passes. He's picked up where he left off following a strong 2024 finish as over his last five games, Pearsall's averaging six receptions and 98.2 yards with two total touchdowns.</p><p>San Fran will host the Jags on Sunday, with that cross-country flight certainly not helping Jacksonville's prospects. The Jaguars have been one of the most giving teams to opposing receivers this year as they've allowed the third-most receptions and the third-most receiving touchdowns to wideouts.

Both teams start quarterbacks who patiently waited their time -- <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/players/28878532/ty-simpson/\">Ty Simpson</a> in Tuscaloosa, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/players/28876053/gunner-stockton/\">Gunner Stockton</a> in Athens -- and possess defenses that haven't been nearly as good as you'd expect based on the names on the front of the jersey. </p><p><em><a href=\"https://martech.cbssports.com/bt/redirect/prod?b=draftkings&c=sport\" target=\"_blank\">Bet Georgia vs. Alabama at DraftKings Sportsbook</a>, where new users get $200 in bonus bets and over $200 off NFL Sunday Ticket. <a href=\"https://martech.cbssports.com/bt/redirect/prod?b=draftkings&c=sport\" target=\"_blank\">Click here</a>:</em></p><p>These two teams have a tendency to deliver classics whenever they meet on the field. You have the famous second-and-26 walk-off touchdown pass in the 2018 national championship game. Then, the wild comeback the following season when Jalen Hurts took over and beat Georgia in the SEC Championship. And also, the 2022 national championship when Smart beat his mentor Nick Saban for his first title as the Bulldogs coach. </p>\n<p>And then there was last year when <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/players/29419031/ryan-williams/\">Ryan Williams</a> delivered one of the greatest plays you'll ever see on an acrobatic catch and run for a game-winning 75-yard touchdown. </p><p>If this year's edition comes even close to matching last year's thriller in Tuscaloosa, we're in store for one of <span><a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/news/no-17-alabama-vs-no-5-georgia-odds-line-time-proven-football-expert-makes-his-cfb-week-5-picks/\" target=\"_blank\">the games of the season</a></span>. </p><h2>Alabama vs. Georgia: Need to know</h2><p><strong>How does Alabama attack Georgia's</strong> <strong>defense:</strong> A year ago, Kalen DeBoer and then-offensive coordinator Nick Sheridan put together a masterful first-half offensive gameplan that had Georgia befuddled and overwhelmed. That fast start where QB Jalen Milroe looked unstoppable was critical given the furious rally the Bulldogs unleashed in the second half. Can DeBoer and new offensive coordinator Ryan Grubb cook up some new concepts that Smart and UGA defensive coordinator Glenn Schumann haven't seen before? Tide starting QB Ty Simpson doesn't give you quite the versatility from a running standpoint that Milroe did, but he's a better passer and he's been on a heater coming into this one. Georgia's defense, which hasn't looked great so far this season, could have its hands full Saturday. </p>\n<p><strong>Georgia should take some shots downfield:</strong> Georgia's offensive line <span><a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/news/despite-crushing-loss-to-georgia-tennessee-has-reason-for-optimism-in-quest-for-return-trip-to-cfp/\" target=\"_blank\">struggled against Tennessee</a></span>, giving up four sacks, which can make a program skittish about trying to be aggressive with its vertical passing game. But going up against an Alabama defense that hasn't fared well in pressuring the quarterback, the Bulldogs could benefit from unleashing <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/players/29123979/zachariah-branch/\">Zachariah Branch</a> downfield for some big play chances. If this one is anything like last year's Georgia is going to need to keep pace offensively in what could be a high-scoring affair. Trusting the offensive line to give Stockton the time to do so is risky, but this may be the matchup to do it. </p><p><strong>Tide need to get run game going:</strong> There are multiple reasons behind the struggles -- from an offensive line that hasn't lived up to the hype yet to the lack of a dominant running back -- but there's no question that Alabama's run game hasn't delivered this season. The Tide rank 103rd nationally, averaging only 123.67 rushing yards per game. That was especially a problem against Florida State when the Tide managed only 87 rushing yards, looked one-dimensional offensively and managed to convert only 6 of 17 third downs. Getting running back <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/players/28875653/jam-miller/\">Jam Miller</a> back should provide a boost, but Alabama may need to be creative to get its running game going early. </p><h2>   Where to watch Alabama vs. Georgia live   </h2><p><strong>Date</strong>: Saturday, Sept. 27 | <strong>Time</strong>: 7:30 p.m. ET<br />   <strong>Location</strong>: Sanford Stadium -- Athens, Georgia<br /><strong>TV: </strong>ABC | <strong>Live stream: </strong><a href=\"https://www.fubo.tv/welcome/leagues/191261?irad=399332&irmp=416484&sharedid=HTW\" target=\"_blank\">Fubo</a> (Try for free)</p>\n<h2>Alabama vs. Georgia prediction, picks   </h2>\n<p>Maybe this is a sucker pick to assume the scoring will be anywhere close to what it was a year ago, but neither defense particularly impresses me and think both could be ripe to be exploited.

Texas A&M is not only playing in front of the 12th Man in Kyle Field but coming into the game out of an off week that allowed the team to reset following <span><a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/\" target=\"_blank\">a 41-40 win</a></span> against <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/teams/ND/notre-dame-fighting-irish/\">Notre Dame</a> in South Bend. Quarterback <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/players/29173876/marcel-reed/\">Marcel Reed</a> has taken steps forward in his development and the Aggies offense has seen some new additions make a big impact with 40+ points in all three games so far in 2025. </p><p><em><a href=\"https://martech.cbssports.com/bt/redirect/prod?b=draftkings&c=sport\" target=\"_blank\">Bet Texas A&M vs. Auburn at DraftKings Sportsbook</a>, where new users get $200 in bonus bets and over $200 off NFL Sunday Ticket. <a href=\"https://martech.cbssports.com/bt/redirect/prod?b=draftkings&c=sport\" target=\"_blank\">Click here</a>:</em></p><p>This marks the 16th matchup in the all-time series between Texas A&M and Auburn and it's the 14th straight year the two teams have played. The Aggies lead the all-time series 8-7, holding a 4-2 advantage in games played in College Station.</p>\n<h2>Where to watch Texas A&M vs. Auburn live</h2><p><strong>Date</strong>: Saturday, Sept. 27 | <strong>Time</strong>: 3:30 p.m. ET<br /><strong>Location</strong>: Kyle Field -- College Station, Texas<br /><strong>TV: </strong>ESPN | <strong>Live stream: </strong><a href=\"https://www.fubo.tv/welcome/leagues/191261?irad=399332&irmp=416484&sharedid=HTW\" target=\"_blank\">Fubo</a> (Try for free)</p><h2>  Texas A&M vs. Auburn: Need to know  </h2><p><strong>Texas A&M's offense flexing balance and explosiveness:</strong> The Aggies offense is one of just nine in the country averaging more than 300 passing yards per game (323.3) and 150 rushing yards per game (157.0). A big part of that success has been an uptick in explosive plays, as Texas A&M has 22 plays of 20-plus yards through the first three games. That's well above pace for the explosiveness of last year's group, and not only the big plays themselves but the threat of a big play has changed the way teams defend this Aggies offense.  </p><p><strong>Tigers wide receiver room has shining stars and an injury update:</strong> <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/players/29392432/cam-coleman/\">Cam Coleman</a> has continued to build on what was an impressive rookie campaign in 2024 with a strong start to the 2025 season. Against Oklahoma, Coleman pulled in the 10th touchdown of his career which was also the eighth in the last seven games. He's flanked in this Auburn passing attack by <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/teams/GATECH/georgia-tech-yellow-jackets/\">Georgia Tech</a> transfer Eric Singleton, who now has a catch in every game of his college career (28 games) dating back to his time with the Yellow Jackets. Unfortunately, the wide receiver room took a hit this week with Hugh Freeze announcing that third-leading receiver Horatio Fields suffered a broken foot in practice and will miss time after undergoing surgery.  </p>\n<p><strong>A tough historical spot for Auburn:</strong> The Tigers have not logged a win against a top-10 team on the road since beating <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/teams/MISS/ole-miss-rebels/\">Ole Miss</a>, then ranked No. 7, in Nov. 2014. But it's not road spots, because Auburn has not defeated a top-10 team at all since beating Ole Miss, at that time ranked No. 10, on Oct. 30, 2021. Now while some of this drought has come as a result of annual dates against the likes of <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/teams/BAMA/alabama-crimson-tide/\">Alabama</a> and <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/teams/UGA/georgia-bulldogs/\">Georgia</a>, it's still a streak that Auburn would like to see snapped in a winnable game against the Aggies on Saturday.</p><h2>  Texas A&M vs. Auburn prediction, picks  </h2>\n<p>Texas A&M has added explosiveness to its offense with the additions of <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/players/29123718/kc-concepcion/\">KC Concepcion</a> and <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/players/29391237/mario-craver/\">Mario Craver</a> but also seen its defense give up some yards and points with a bend-but-don't-break style. The result has been all three games going over the total, and the 41-40 win at Notre Dame might be indicative of what to expect when the Aggies face similar competition. I'd categorize Auburn as a team that's capable, and possibly willing, to hang in a shootout which makes this total a bit too low. <strong><em>Pick: Over
