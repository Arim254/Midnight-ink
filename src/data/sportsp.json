The Blue Jays lost on Tuesday, allowing the Yankees to pull to one game out of the AL East lead, but the model sees value in Toronto bouncing back to win at +118 odds. The model also projects the Mets vs. Cubs to go Over 7 total runs, as they did in New York's 9-7 win on Tuesday. The Cubs are expected to start Matthew Boyd (13-8, 3.20 ERA), while the Mets will counter with Jonah Tong (2-2, 5.94 ERA).

Francisco Alvarez hit a game-winning two-run home run to break a tie at 7 in the eighth inning for his second home run in his last five games. Francisco Lindor and Brandon Nimmo also homered for the Mets. Five of the last seven Mets games went Over 7 total runs. The Cubs and the Mets both have top-10 scoring offenses in baseball, and the model projects the Over to hit in 71% of simulations for an 8:05 p.m. ET start.</p><h2>Blue Jays (+118) to defeat the Red Sox</h2><p>Toronto is in danger of falling out of first place in the American League East, and losing a first-round bye despite currently having the best record in the AL. The Blue Jays (90-67) have a one-game lead over the Yankees entering Wednesday. They've lost five of their last six games, but with a future Hall of Fame pitcher heading to the mound on Wednesday, the model projects value in the Blue Jays winning at plus-money odds. Toronto is starting Max Scherzer, who has 221 career victories, while the Red Sox start Garrett Crochet (17-5, 2.69 ERA). Crochet has a 4.50 ERA over his last two starts though. At +118 odds, the model sees value in projecting the Blue Jays to win in 54% of simulations for a 7:07 p.m. ET start.</p><h2>Rockies vs. Mariners Over 7.5 total runs (-110)</h2><p>The Mariners clinched a playoff spot on Tuesday to cap off what's been an incredible September run, going 15-1 over their last 16 games. Seattle defeated Colorado, 4-3, on Tuesday after going Over 7.5 total runs in each of its prior two contests. The Rockies are allowing the most runs in baseball (6.32 runs per game) and are scheduled to start Tanner Gordon, who has a 6.00 ERA this season. Although the Mariners clinched the postseason, they haven't secured the AL West yet, as they lead the Astros by four games. The Mariners couldn't have their all-out celebration yet with important games ahead and the likely chance of securing a first-round bye if they win the division, so the players should remain focused on Wednesday. Mariners starting pitcher Luis Castillo has been hot and cold lately, as he's allowed one run or fewer in three of his last five starts, while allowing five runs in the other two contests. The model projects the Over to hit in 69.3% of simulations for this 9:40 p.m. ET start. </p><h2>Want more MLB picks for Wednesday, September 24?</h2><p><strong>You've seen the model's Wednesday best bets.

That was one of the first big hits for NFL survivor players, and now those who remain are formulating their Week 4 NFL survivor picks with the options beginning to dwindle a bit. The Bills are the biggest favorites on the board (-16.5) this week against the Saints, though many survivor pool players already used Buffalo as big favorites against the Dolphins in Week 3. </p><p>The latest Week 4 NFL odds show six other games with a Week 4 NFL spread of 5.5 points or more, including Browns vs. Lions (-9.5), Patriots (-5.5) vs. Panthers, Titans vs. Texans (-7), Chargers vs. Giants (+6.5), Packers vs. Cowboys (+6.5) and Bengals vs. Broncos (-7.5).

Kickoff is scheduled for 8:15 p.m. ET at State Farm Stadium and the over/under is 43.5 points, down three points from the opening line. The game features a loaded NFL DFS player pool, with some of the biggest names in the sport like Kyler Murray, Sam Darnold, Marvin Harrison Jr., Jaxon Smith-Njigba, and Trey McBride leading the way. James Conner (foot) was lost for the season last week, clearing the path for more carries for Trey Benson and Emari Demercado.</p><p>Finding undervalued players at a cheap price is still the key to building a winning NFL DFS strategy in Showdown contests -- especially with this matchup featuring so many big-name players. Should you target potential values like Trey Benson, Tory Horton, or Cooper Kupp to pair with the bigger-name players for Thursday Night Football DFS lineups?

The former USC standout had a breakout 2024 season with the Minnesota Vikings: in 17 games as the starter, he completed 361 of 545 passes for 4,319 yards, 35 touchdowns, and 12 interceptions, leading the Vikings to a 14-3 regular season record. That performance earned him his first Pro Bowl selection and a lucrative free-agent contract with the Seahawks.</p><p>In 2025, Darnold has thrown for 663 yards with four touchdowns and two interceptions, and his completion percentage sits at 70.3%. He has a solid core of weapons at his disposal, led by Jaxon Smith-Njigba, Cooper Kupp and rookie Tory Horton. <a href=\"https://www.sportsline.com/insiders/nfl-dfs-picks-thursday-night-football-seahawks-vs-cardinals-fantasy-lineup-advice-projections-for-draftkings-fanduel-from-millionaire-maker-contest-winner/#ttag=09232025_agg_cbssports_dfs_football_nfl_jimmiekaylor_CardinalsSeahawksDFS\" target=\"_blank\">See who else to roster right here</a>.</p><p>Part of Kaylor's optimal NFL DFS strategy also includes rostering Cardinals tight end Trey McBride.

In 2024, McBride had a breakout year, catching 111 passes for 1,146 yards with two receiving touchdowns while adding one rushing score.</p><p>Through three weeks of the 2025 season, McBride has recorded 17 receptions for 182 yards and one touchdown, averaging over 10 yards per catch.

It's hard for me to make any predictions about that or stake any statements about it.\"</p>\n<p>Brownlee was a fifth-round pick of the Titans last year out of Louisville and contributed in Dennard Wilson's defense immediately, starting in 14 of 17 games played while recording 75 combined tackles, seven tackles for loss, nine passes defensed and one interception. He entered the 2025 season as a solidified starter. </p><p>Why did the Titans move a player like Brownlee? It's a good question. Tennessee doesn't exactly have a deep cornerback room, and this was a young talent on a cheap rookie deal. Why did Tennessee take a loss on this fifth-round draft pick that clearly out-performed where he was selected? Good luck figuring that out.</p>\n<p>While the Titans are apparently not considering a fire sale right now, that could change in the future. Callahan is on shaky ground with a 3-17 record since being hired, and Tennessee could have a couple of other intriguing trade targets. </p>\n            </div>\n    </div>"

Keep it tight in open play, trust yourselves to nick something from a set piece at the other end. Eighteen months ago, when Ange Postecoglou was at his most dismissive about the value of specialist set piece coaching, it might even have worked.</p><p>In 2025, however, what was once a great equalizing factor between the EFL and the Premier League looks to be another aspect of the game where money talks. Whenever Xavi Simons stood over a corner or Rodrigo Bentancur stood over a free kick, Andreas Georgson would step out from Thomas Frank's shadow to supervise another carefully crafted routine. Check their penalty area and it was apparent how much smaller and younger the League One side looked. Gone are the days when a giant 33-year-old might be the rock on which Doncaster built their defense. Instead, it was the Premier League athletes who leaped highest and hit hardest. </p><p>In the early exchanges, Doncaster looked firmly in this tie. They attacked aggressively out wide, Tottenham loanee Damola Ajayi causing particular issues for his parent club, volleying a delivery from wide back across goal to a spot where Toyosi Olusanya could not quite turn the ball home. McCann's side looked comfortable in possession too, and though they were no less vulnerable down their own flanks than they were dangerous when they had the ball, you could convince yourself that they could create a few issues for their hosts as this game went on.</p><p>Then came Tottenham's first corner, lofted menacingly towards the goal line by Simons. It is fair to note that with or without a set-piece coach at his disposal, Ian Lawlor in the Doncaster goal ought to have been able to get a more convincing punch on the corner. Sean Grehan could have cleared it anywhere, but where he did, the perfect spot for Joao Palhinha to try an overhead kick. With Lawlor in no man's land, the connection didn't even have to be that sweet to hand Spurs the lead.</p>\n<p>Make no mistake, with or without set pieces, Tottenham would probably have had this game won with relative ease. Their quality out wide was beyond anything right back Tom Nixon could deal with, Wilson Isidor skipping past him two minutes after the opener to deliver a fine cross Jay McGrath could only turn into his own net. Spurs could wait until the last kick of the ball to add a third, <span>Brennan Johnson</span> charging through an exhausted defense to meet <span>Lucas Bergvall's</span> through ball and clip home.</p><p>Before then, another goal seemed more likely than not, it would be from another dead ball. There was a period late in the first half when this was on the brink of training ground exercise status, Spurs working on a string of corner routines that ended with an unmarked Pedro Porro striking at goal. It was too easy for Bentancur to outjump the red and white shirts when a delivery went straight into the box while <span>Kevin Danso's</span> knock on found <span>Archie Gray</span> in the box for one of the best chances of the game. The former limbering up to hurl one into the mixer spoke to the burgeoning trend for long throws in 2025-26. </p><p>In all, 11 of Tottenham's first 15 shots came from set pieces. And perhaps the extreme nature of their dominance from set pieces is exactly that, extreme. An improvement from dead balls has been a key tenet of Spurs under Frank, while the early-season data from League One would suggest that Doncaster are a fairly unremarkable team when it comes to attacking and defending such scenarios.</p>\n<p>Equally, as set pieces become the latest marginal gain that obsesses the Premier League, it is easy to see how the particular sort of dominance Tottenham applied might be applied on the days that are supposed to be about giant killing. When the nights draw in for FA Cup third round weekend, how many more of League One's finest will find themselves smothered and bullied at corners? If that does indeed prove to be the case, it is harder than ever to see how the next Doncaster might pull off a cup upset.</p>\n            </div>"

Outfielder <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/players/2837422/johnathan-rodriguez/\">Johnathan Rodriguez</a> was recalled to take his place on the active roster.</p><p>\"Imaging and clinical examination have confirmed that David Fry sustained multiple, minimally displaced, left-sided facial and nasal fractures,\" <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://x.com/CleGuardians/status/1970918429180965015\">the Guardians announced on Wednesday afternoon</a>. \"While the injury will require close monitoring, including serial assessments, David is expected to fully recover over the next 6-8 weeks without the need for surgery. David was recently discharged from the Cleveland Clinic and is resting comfortably.\"</p>\n<p>Fry, 29, had appeared in 66 games prior to Wednesday's injury. He hit .171/.229/.363 (61 OPS+) with eight home runs and 23 runs batted in. Those marks were down from last season, when he batted .263/.356/.448 (129 OPS+) with 14 home runs and 51 runs batted in.</p>\n            </div>"

Here's a look at the home runs in question:</p>\n<p>Judge now has four career 50-plus homer seasons, tying him with Sammy Sosa, Mark McGwire, and Babe Ruth for the most in Major League Baseball history. Judge is the only member of that bunch to record all four seasons over the span of his first 10 years in the majors. </p><p>Additionally, Judge is the first Yankees player with back-to-back 50-plus-homer seasons since Ruth did it in 1927-28.</p>\n<p>Judge had previously launched 52 home runs in 2017, 62 in 2022, and 58 last year. His 2022 showing, of course, established a new single-season high for both the Yankees franchise and the American League as a whole. Each of those marks had previously belonged to Roger Maris, who homered 61 times back in 1961.</p><p>Judge, 33, entered Wednesday's game hitting .325/.452/.669 (209 OPS+) with 49 home runs, 105 runs batted in, and 12 stolen bases. His contributions had been worth an estimated 8.9 Wins Above Replacement, according to the calculations housed at Baseball Reference. Judge is, predictably, considered to be one of the two main candidates to win the American League Most Valuable Player Award, with <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/teams/SEA/seattle-mariners/\">Seattle Mariners</a> backstop <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/players/2933037/cal-raleigh/\">Cal Raleigh</a> serving as the alternative.</p>\n<p>The Yankees clinched a postseason berth with Monday's come-from-behind win against the White Sox. New York still has something to play for the rest of the way, however, including a potential AL East title and the top seed on the Junior Circuit's side of the bracket. The Yankees are tied with the Blue Jays in both races.</p>\n            </div>\n    </div>"
