    "body": "<div>\n        <p>Dwayne Johnson got a real taste of what it's like to be a professional fighter in \"The Smashing Machine.\" Johnson, who portrays UFC and Pride Fighting Championships veteran Mark Kerr in the movie, revealed that he took a legitimate punch from an MMA fighter while filming.</p><p>Johnson executed his own stunt choreography in the film. During one scene, a recreation of Kerr's 2000 Pride Grand Prix finals fight with Kazuyuki Fujita, The Rock took a legitimate punch that had him seeing stars.</p><p>\"It felt like when you get rocked by a real fighter multiple times,\" Johnson told CBS Sports during a combat sports media roundtable for the film. \"There's a moment in the trailer where I'm on my knees in the ring and I look up dazed. That's real. I got my bell rung. Benny said, 'Hold on! Stay right there!' I was seeing three heads of Benny Safdie and 15 heads of Mark Kerr.\"</p><p>Before production, Safdie told Johnson that he'd \"love to never cut away\" from the lead actor. From that moment, Johnson knew he'd be getting physical despite having two capable stuntmen on reserve. Most of the film's fight scenes are filmed from the crowd's perspective. However, one pivotal scene brings the audience closer to the action. The close-up required Johnson to employ some method acting. Johnson was game, but getting his scene partner, a pro mixed artist, to play ball proved challenging.</p>\n<p>\"I said, 'Hey brother, you're pulling the punches. You need to lay it in and hit me,'\" Johnson recalled. \"He said, 'What do you mean?' I said, 'Benny isn't cutting away. This is the end of the movie. You know this really happened to Mark. You have to lay it in.' I said, 'Look, just don't hit me here, you'll break my jaw. Don't hit me in the temple, you'll kill me. But if you can hit me in my cheekbone.' </p><p>\"He goes, 'No, no, no. I'm not going to do that.' I said, 'I need you to hit me.' He goes, 'I respect you. I'm not doing that.' I asked Benny to come over. Benny said, 'You have to hit him because I'm not cutting away.' I grabbed him and said, 'Please, brother. It's you and me here. It's OK.'\"</p><p>Safdie, who joined Johnson and Kerr at the roundtable, chimed in with an amusing amendment to the story.</p>\n<p>\"Bas Rutten was listening to this whole thing, and said, 'Just hit him! He's just The Rock! Hit him!'\"</p><p>\"He hit me so hard!\" Johnson replied. \"That's what you see in the movie. Not only is he hitting me, but I realized watching back that he's coming down. That was a punch! Dude!\"</p><p>The film, based on the 2002 documentary \"The Smashing Machine: The Life and Times of Extreme Fighter Mark Kerr,\" stars Johnson and Emily Blunt, and features several notable MMA personalities. UFC alum and two-division Bellator champion Ryan Bader portrays UFC Hall of Famer Mark Coleman. Undisputed boxing heavyweight champion Oleksandr Usyk is in the film, and Rutten portrays himself.</p>\n<p>\"The Smashing Machine\" premieres Oct. 3 in the U.S.   </p>\n            </div>"

The Ravens are 4.5-point favorites, and the over/under is up to 53.5 after opening at 49.5, meaning this game should feature plenty of offense. Lamar Jackson, Jared Goff, Jahmyr Gibbs, Amon-Ra St. Brown, Jameson Williams, Derrick Henry and David Montgomery are just a few of the big names to consider for NFL DFS lineups.</p><p>Who are the top NFL DFS picks for Lions vs. Ravens, and which daily Fantasy sleepers should you target to differentiate your lineups?

He edged out over 355,000 other entrants in the contest and also has multiple five-figure tournament wins on his DFS resume. Kaylor has covered the NFL and college football for close to a decade as a member of the Pro Football Writers of America, and his background as a former college and NFL player gives him a unique perspective when building his fantasy lineups and locking in his betting picks. </p><p>Now, Kaylor has turned his attention to 'Monday Night Football' and just locked in his top daily Fantasy football picks. <a href=\"https://www.sportsline.com/insiders/nfl-dfs-picks-lions-vs-ravens-fantasy-lineup-advice-monday-night-football-projections-for-draftkings-fanduel-from-millionaire-maker-contest-winner/#ttag=09222025_agg_cbssports_dfs_football_nfl_jimmiekaylor_MondayNightFootballDFS\" target=\"_blank\">You can only see his Monday Night Football DFS picks and analysis at SportsLine</a>.</p><p><em>New users can </em><a href=\"https://martech.cbssports.com/bt/redirect/prod?b=draftkings&c=dfs\" target=\"_blank\"><em>get $50 in Pick6 credits at DraftKings when they play $5</em></a><em>: </em></p><h2>Top NFL DFS picks, lineups, stacks for Monday Night Football</h2><p>One of Kaylor's top DFS picks for 'Monday Night Football' is Ravens running back Derrick Henry. Experts have been predicting a decline for the now 31-year-old back for years now, and it simply is not happening. He opened this season with a massive 18-169-2 rushing line against the Bills in Week 1, before having a quieter Week 2 effort against the Browns.</p><p>The Lions have given up a rushing touchdown in both games so far in 2025, and with the Ravens favored, Henry could see heavy usage late in the game if they need to run the clock. <a href=\"https://www.sportsline.com/insiders/nfl-dfs-picks-lions-vs-ravens-fantasy-lineup-advice-monday-night-football-projections-for-draftkings-fanduel-from-millionaire-maker-contest-winner/#ttag=09222025_agg_cbssports_dfs_football_nfl_jimmiekaylor_MondayNightFootballDFS\" target=\"_blank\">See who else to roster right here</a>.</p><p>Part of Kaylor's optimal NFL DFS strategy also includes rostering Lions receiver Amon-Ra St. Brown. After being limited in Week 1, St. Brown exploded with nine catches for 115 yards and three touchdowns in the Week 2 win against the Bears. He's already been targeted 17 times this season, so he's the clear No. 1 option for quarterback Jared Goff since no other receiver has been targeted more than nine times. </p><p>In the only game where they've faced a competent passing attack, the Ravens gave up nearly 400 yards through the air against the Bills. Keon Coleman had 112 yards and a score in that game, and St. Brown certainly has the chance to match or even exceed those types of numbers on Monday.  <a href=\"https://www.sportsline.com/insiders/nfl-dfs-picks-lions-vs-ravens-fantasy-lineup-advice-monday-night-football-projections-for-draftkings-fanduel-from-millionaire-maker-contest-winner/#ttag=09222025_agg_cbssports_dfs_football_nfl_jimmiekaylor_MondayNightFootballDFS\" target=\"_blank\">You can see the rest of Kaylor's NFL DFS picks here</a>.</p><p><em>New users can see the latest </em><span><a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/betting/news/fanduel-promo-code/\" target=\"_blank\"><em>FanDuel promo code</em></a></span><em> to </em><a href=\"https://martech.cbssports.com/bt/redirect/prod?b=fanduel&c=sport\" target=\"_blank\"><em>get $300 in bonus bets at FanDuel if your $5 bet wins</em></a><em>:</em></p><h2>How to build NFL DFS lineups for Monday Night Football</h2><p>Kaylor is also targeting another undervalued player who could explode for huge numbers on Monday Night Football.

This year's U.S. team will look different from the one that went to Italy as J.J. Spaun, Russell Henley, Cameron Young and Ben Griffin make their debuts, while Harris English makes his second-ever appearance after being part of the 2021 squad that won at Whistling Straits. </p><p>The European team, on the other hand, will look almost exactly the same. The only change from the side that won in Rome? Swapping Rasmus Højgaard onto the team for twin brother Nicolai. Europe and captain Luke Donald are hoping that continuity will help them become the first team to win a road Ryder Cup since they Europe did exactly that in 2012 at Medinah. American captain Keegan Bradley, meanwhile, hopes greater team camaraderie and some home cooking will help his side regain the trophy.</p><p>Beyond the odds to win the event, there exists a smorgasbord of prop bets for the final significant golf event of the year.

The electric <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/3162723/jahmyr-gibbs/\">Jahmyr Gibbs</a> was bottled up for just 19 yards on nine carries in the season-opening loss to Green Bay, only to break out with close to 8 yards per carry against the Bears. The Ravens, meanwhile, will be missing their top interior defender in <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/2249188/nnamdi-madubuike/\">Nnamdi Madubuike</a> (neck injury), potentially clearing the way for easier rushing lanes up front. <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/2261252/david-montgomery/\">David Montgomery</a> should also be set for a sizable role as Gibbs' more physical counterpart, fresh off back-to-back outings with 11 carries.</li><li><strong>Will Lamar Jackson test the Detroit secondary? </strong>The Ravens are an adaptable attack, pivoting to more of a run-heavy approach when able or required, but Jackson can sling it deep with the best of them, as evidenced by his four-touchdown showcase against the Browns in Week 2. And he might have added reason to try pushing the rock at home, with several key players banged up in the Lions' defensive backfield, including ball-hawking safety <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/2961816/kerby-joseph/\">Kerby Joseph</a> (knee) and top cover corner <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/2261288/d-j-reed/\">D.J. Reed</a> (knee). Even if both are able to suit up, they may not be at full speed, putting more pressure on Lions Swiss Army knife <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/3170863/brian-branch/\">Brian Branch</a>.</li><li><strong>Can the Ravens generate a pass rush? </strong>The Lions have left tackle <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/1983776/taylor-decker/\">Taylor Decker</a> nursing an injury, but Baltimore isn't exactly overflowing with proven edge defenders. Madubuike leads the club with two sacks through two games but will be sidelined Monday night, and outside linebacker <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/1752529/kyle-van-noy/\">Kyle Van Noy</a> (hamstring), who led the Ravens with 12.5 sacks a year ago, has also been ruled out. That leaves <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/2961253/odafe-oweh/\">Odafe Oweh</a>, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/3168791/tavius-robinson/\">Tavius Robinson</a> and rookie <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/26706090/mike-green/\">Mike Green</a> as the top candidates to get after Jared Goff. And getting after him is key, because when he's got time to operate, Goff excels at quickly distributing the ball to his playmakers.</li></ul><h2>X factor to watch</h2>\n<p>When Hopkins joined the Ravens this year, plenty of reasonably minded folks waved off the acquisition as another low-risk, low-reward gamble on an aging, declining pass catcher -- a Baltimore special. But Hopkins has already proven remarkably clutch as a deep-ball artist for Lamar Jackson, scoring twice on just four catches and securing all four of his targets. He may be best served as a situational option at age 33, but D-Hop also just looks refreshed while operating downfield. Working against a bruised Lions secondary, he could have more opportunities to serve as a sort of closer for Baltimore's passing attack, whether on third down or in the red zone.</p><h2>Ravens vs. Lions prediction, pick</h2>\n<p>Two years ago, these two heavyweights met in a late-October clash in Baltimore, and the Ravens ran away with it, rolling to a 38-6 victory that had many questioning whether Dan Campbell's Lions were really on the ascent. Jackson was near-perfect in that matchup, tossing three scores and rushing for a fourth, while Goff hurled a whopping 53 passes while trying -- and failing -- to keep up.</p><p>We're not counting on that kind of lopsided affair this time around. That's mostly due to the remaining questions on Baltimore's defense, which was ill-prepared to hold a Week 1 lead against Buffalo and is now without a pair of front-seven tentpoles in Madubuike and Van Noy. Their absences alone should enable the Lions to properly establish the run and set up Goff's play-action shots to St. Brown, Williams and tight end <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/3124197/sam-laporta/\">Sam LaPorta</a>.</p>\n<p>That said, this game is still on the Ravens' turf. Baltimore is 35-16 at home since Jackson took over as the full-timer in 2019. And Jackson remains in MVP form as the do-it-all centerpiece of his squad. Monday's matchup might require him to don his cape down the stretch, but we've seen him do it before, and we expect to see it again. <em><strong>Pick: Ravens 28, Lions 26 | Lions +4.5, Over 53.5</strong></em></p>\n            </div>\n    </div>\n</article>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n                        </div>"

The Padres hold the second National League wild card spot, but the New York Mets' collapse has seen them fall out of playoff position, meaning the Cincinnati Reds are currently in possession of that third spot. The Arizona Diamondbacks and San Francisco Giants are still fighting too.</p><p>Over in the American League, the Seattle Mariners swept the Houston Astros to put themselves ahead in the neck-and-neck AL West battle. Whoever loses that fight will have to fight for a wild card berth. The New York Yankees and Boston Red Sox are in wild card position, but the Cleveland Guardians are making a furious late surge to try to get back to the postseason. The Detroit Tigers and Toronto Blue Jays lead the AL Central and East, respectively, but both are just barely holding on to their positions as the season winds down.</p><p>As a reminder, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://cbssports.com/mlb/\">MLB</a> now grants 12 playoff berths -- a total of six to the division winners and then three wild card berths in each league.

This year, there was hope with series like Orioles-Yankees, Tigers-Red Sox, Rays-Blue Jays, Diamondbacks-Padres, Reds-Brewers, Dodgers-Mariners, Rangers-Guardians and Cardinals-Cubs. </p><p>It's possible none of those games matter. Maybe one or two will. At least two teams stick out, though, and we can also examine a penultimate series to find a gem of a head-to-head. </p><p>Hello, American League Central. </p><p>From Tuesday through Thursday, the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/teams/DET/detroit-tigers/\">Tigers</a> visit the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/teams/CLE/cleveland-guardians/\">Guardians</a> in Cleveland. There may be five days left in the regular season, but this has all the juice of a playoff series with the Tigers clinging to a one-game lead. This was the biggest blowout divisional race through most of the first half of the season and now it's the most hotly contested. </p><p>How did we get here? Well, it's been a combination of great from the Guardians and bad from the Tigers. </p>\n<p>The Tigers had a 14-game lead on July 8. They had an 11 ½-game lead on Aug. 23. They had a 10-game lead on Sept. 3. It was 6 ½ just one week ago! </p><p>Though there were obviously a few bad stretches early and some good stretches late, it seems like July 8 was the dividing line here for the Tigers. They were 59-34 at the time. The <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/teams/MIN/minnesota-twins/\">Twins</a>, believe it or not, were in second place and you'll have to scroll a long time to find them in these rankings now. The Guardians were in fourth place and 15 ½ games out. The Tigers have gone 26-37 since. The Guardians? They've gone 42-24. </p><p>The term \"collapse\" gets overused in situations like these, but it's perfectly fair here. Starting 59-34 and then going 26-37 after that is absolutely a collapse. Plus, they've lost six in a row and nine of 10. The word \"collapse\" also doesn't do the situation full justice because the Guardians have stormed back and made this a race on their own merits. The Tigers built up such a huge lead that they had the luxury of coasting to a division title unless one of the teams behind them went bonkers. The Guardians went bonkers. They deserve so much credit for this run and if they do pull it off, they might just parlay that into a deep October run (perhaps even that elusive World Series title?). </p>\n<p>Now, the Tigers can also still make 2025 a special season. They have the three games in Cleveland before finishing with three in Boston. It's a really tough week. Let's say they go 4-2 or 5-1 and win the AL Central. They'd have a chance at a bye to the ALDS then and there's no dominant American League team. The Tigers could well end up in the World Series. Once you get there, it's always anyone's game.</p><p>It has to start with a big final week, though. </p><p>And the downside is, gulp, missing the playoffs altogether. That would truly be the shock of the season and one of the most historic collapses in <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://cbssports.com/mlb/\">MLB</a> history. It's possible. It's plausible. Some might even argue it's likely, given how the Tigers have played lately and the tough remaining schedule. The vibes around the ballclub right now are downright wretched.</p><p>It all comes down to this week, Tigers. You can stave off becoming a punch line and give yourselves a chance to salvage this thing. What's it going to be?</p>\n<div><p>\n        Biggest Movers\n    </p><div><p><span></span><span></span><span>\n                6\n            </span><span>\n                Marlins\n            </span></p><p><span></span><span></span><span>\n                7\n            </span><span>\n                Rangers\n            </span></p></div><div><table><thead><tr><th><p>Rk</p></th><th><p>Teams</p></th><th>\n                    </th><th><p>Chg</p></th><th><p>Rcrd</p></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><span>\n                                1\n                            </span></td><td><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/teams/MIL/milwaukee-brewers/\"><div><figure><img alt=\"team logo\" src=\"https://sports.cbsimg.net/fly/images/team-logos/308.svg\" /></figure></div><span>\n                                    Brewers\n                                </span></a></td><td>\n                            The Brandon Woodruff injury is pretty worrisome, given his history.

The lead is now three games with six to play -- all at home -- and three of those come against the Rockies.

The names depicted here are highly speculative and subject to change.</em></p><p><em>That's especially true in the final week of the season, when the playoff-bound teams, as long as they're not fighting to stay in the race, are likely to insert a spot starter or two to realign their rotation for the postseason while the non-contending teams are liable to go off the beaten path just because they have nothing to lose. It's a short list of two-start pitchers to begin with, and chances are only a fraction of them will actually make two starts.</em></p><p><em>So if you're choosing to start one of these pitchers in Fantasy Week 27 (Sept. 22-28) for no other reason than because he's in line for two starts, you may want to rethink that decision. His two-start status is precarious at best.</em></p><p><em>Two prominent examples are <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/players/2900486/freddy-peralta/fantasy/\">Freddy Peralta</a> and <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/players/2000033/kevin-gausman/fantasy/\">Kevin Gausman</a>. You may think both are in line for two starts this week, but I doubt either will make that second start given that the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/teams/MIL/milwaukee-brewers/\">Brewers</a> and <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/teams/TOR/toronto-blue-jays/\">Blue Jays</a> will have clinched what they need to clinch by then and will merely be resting up for the playoffs.

Now it's time for him to look under the right one.</p><p><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/1272242/russell-wilson/\">Russell Wilson</a> was the Giants' signal-caller for the start of the season, all the way through Sunday's Week 3 matchup with the Kansas City Chiefs. That was basically always the plan. Or at least as soon as Wilson inked a one-year, $10.5 million contract in March. And yet, three games into Wilson's tenure as the starter, it's already quite apparent the Giants would be better served handing the keys to the man behind him.</p><p>That's right: It's time for <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/26694019/jaxson-dart/\">Jaxson Dart</a>.</p><p>Why the rush? The better question is: Why not? The Giants are 0-3, which means they're now 18-35-1 under coach Brian Daboll and 52-101-1 over the last decade. You'd have to be wholly ignorant to think this franchise isn't absolutely desperate for a spark. You'd also have to be at least mildly ignorant to believe this version of Wilson, at the ripe age of 36, is capable of providing that.</p><p>He may be a seasoned pro. He may be an unfairly maligned leader. He may have been one of the NFL's great dual threats at the peak of his powers. He may have even exploded out of nowhere for 450 yards in Week 2. But this is Year 14 for Wilson in the NFL. He followed up his 450-yard breakout with an ugly two-pick dud against the Chiefs. The last time he went to back-to-back Pro Bowls, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/493004/eli-manning/\">Eli Manning</a> had just retired as the Giants' quarterback, and Joe Judge was freshly installed atop New York's staff. There's a reason he got $10.5 million, not $35 million, to lead the G-Men this year; he was always destined to be a floor-raising placeholder.</p>\n<p>Here's the issue: The floor keeps getting lower for Wilson. He was once, for a long while, genuinely heroic for the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/SEA/seattle-seahawks/\">Seattle Seahawks</a>. He was slower and out of place with the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/DEN/denver-broncos/\">Denver Broncos</a>. And then, as a one-year Band-Aid for the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/PIT/pittsburgh-steelers/\">Pittsburgh Steelers</a>, he truly showed his age, missing the start of the year due to injury and then finishing it sluggishly. On Sunday, wearing blue for the third time, the trend continued. He launched one bomb after another, hoping just one of them might stick rather than land in the waiting arms of a Chiefs defender. And one of his last series at the controls was a comedy of red-zone woes, with multiple throws out of the back of the end zone to all but seal Kansas City's first win of the year.</p><p>It'd be one thing if Wilson was all the Giants' had. Or if he were the 22-year-old prospect learning on the fly. Neither of those things are true. Wilson was supposed to be the low-risk \"safe bet.\" The guy to keep the Giants above water and maybe, just maybe, further unlock Nabers and afford Daboll and Schoen a bit of much-needed job security in the process. If he can't even so much as consistently move the Giants offense against, say, a slumping Kansas City squad also desperate for answers, let alone keep No. 1 wideout Malik Nabers steadily involved, then maybe he's not the safest bet at all?</p><p>And then there's the heir apparent himself.</p><p>Dart may or may not be the answer in New York. But he's got a few things going for him: No. 1 being that he's not Wilson. That sounds like a demonstrative condemnation of Wilson as a player and/or person, but it really isn't. These are just two different quarterbacks at two very different stages of their respective careers. And Dart being an unknown is precisely the reason the Giants should be interested in unveiling him on a real NFL stage. He was good enough at Ole Miss to prompt New York to move up in the first round of April's draft and make him a first-round pick. He was good enough in a busy preseason to leapfrog veteran <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/1998197/jameis-winston/\">Jameis Winston</a> as the Giants' top backup behind Wilson. He's almost certainly good enough to get another promotion.</p>\n<p>Daboll hasn't been shy about his affection for Dart as the potential future of the franchise. The fact he wouldn't overtly commit to Wilson as the indefinite starter after Week 1, and the fact New York continues to sneak Dart into gadget offensive snaps, means the Giants are already down this road in their minds. Naming Dart the No. 2 for 2025, despite the rookie never taking an official NFL snap, was a chance to fast-track Daboll's handpicked arm for real work. Wilson opening perhaps his final NFL season with a whimper, then a bang, then another whimper only gives the Giants more reason to accelerate their plans.</p><p>Former NFL cornerback <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/416431/bryant-mcfadden/\">Bryant McFadden</a> argued as much on <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/cbs-sports-hq/\" target=\"_blank\">CBS Sports HQ</a> after the Giants' first game of the season.</p>\n<p>\"If you're Brian Daboll, I don't know how long you can just sit and watch what we watched today,\" McFadden said. \"When you have concerns with the offensive line, it's imperative to have a potential playmaker at the quarterback position -- a guy who can extend plays, buy a little time to help the offensive linemen out. You can say whatever you wanna say about <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/2179245/daniel-jones/\">Daniel Jones</a> and what did not work out when he was there in New York. One thing he did do was extend plays when given the opportunity ... [But Wilson] is a sitting duck. ... This could really tear up the locker room if changes are not made sooner rather than later.\"</p>\n<p>So in essence, there are two paths forward for the Giants and Wilson: Either the latter turns a corner in a hurry, rediscovering some mobility or efficiency in his second game running New York's offense. Or the mere promise of something different -- in this case a spunky 22-year-old fresh off a hefty preseason workload -- proves too big to ignore for Big Blue.</p>\n            </div>"
