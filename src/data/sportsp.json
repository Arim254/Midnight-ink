The USMNT star provided the key assist to the opening goal scored by <span>Alexis Saelemaekers</span> before scoring the second goal of the first half against the 2024-25 Serie A champions coached by Antonio Conte. <span>AC Milan</span> had a strong start to the match, in what can be considered as one of the key Serie A games of the season, won by the Rossoneri. Pulisic, who scored his sixth goal of the season so far, has cemented himself as one of the crucial players of the team coached by Massimiliano Allegri. </p><p>Here's his fine goal: </p>\n<p>This season, Pulisic is playing as a striker in the 3-5-2 deployed by the former Juventus manager, who made his comeback at AC Milan after coaching the Rossoneri from 2010 to 2014. Pulisic played alongside Rafael Leao in the opening match of the season in the Coppa Italia playoff against Bari on Aug. 16, but since an injury to the Portuguese player, he started alongside the other striker on the roster, Santiago Gimenez, as it happened against Napoli. </p><p>It's a key season for the American star ahead of the 2026 World Cup in the United States with his national team, and this new tactical role is helping the American striker to boost his performances and show his full range of attacking qualities. Under Allegri, he enjoys the freedom to move into space on the left side of the attack, with the coach restoring him to his natural position in a way no other Milan manager did before. The first half of the game against Napoli showed that Allegri is perfectly dealing with Pulisic and his position on the pitch, and it's paying off.</p>\n<p>After the opening five Serie A games of the season, AC Milan and Napoli are now sitting at the top of the standings with 12 points, alongside with Gian Piero Gasperini's AS Roma, while Juventus are now only one point behind and Inter only three points behind the Serie A leaders. </p>\n            </div>\n    </div>"

    "body": "<div>\n        <p>Omaha mayor John Ewing Jr. and Omaha Police Chief Todd Schmaderer have issued statements following a traffic stop involving undisputed super middleweight champ Terence \"Bud\" Crawford early Sunday morning. The incident occurred just hours after Crawford was honored by the city with a parade for his championship win earlier this month.</p><p>According to police, Crawford's vehicle was stopped for alleged reckless driving around 1:30 a.m. on Sunday morning. In a video of the interaction that was posted to social media, Crawford can be seen exiting the vehicle with both hands in the air. One of the occupants can also be heard saying, \"I'm not reaching for no gun.\"</p>\n<p>Officers say they observed a firearm in the driver's side floorboard and all four occupants were ordered to exit the car at gunpoint. At that point, a legal firearm was found on an occupant, who was a member of Crawford's security team. After identifying Crawford as the driver, police determined that everyone in the vehicle was legally permitted to carry a firearm, and Crawford was cited for reckless driving.</p>\n<p>In a joint statement, Ewing and Schmaderer <a href=\"https://x.com/omaha_scanner/status/1972367564245467354\" target=\"_blank\">announced that there would be an internal affairs investigation</a> into the traffic stop. Ewing issued a statement of his own, in which he says \"that \"trust between law enforcement and our community is important.\"</p><blockquote><p>\"I learned Omaha police pulled over Terence \"Bud\" Crawford on a traffic stop downtown early this morning. After learning of this, I spoke personally to Bud Crawford. I acknowledge the seriousness of what occurred and how trust between law enforcement and our community is important and shows the need to be continuously vigilant about building relationships.</p><p>\"Omaha Police Chief Todd Schmaderer has pledged an internal investigation, which I support and want to be full and thorough. We will gather all the facts and be transparent with the public about our findings.</p><p>\"Understand that my heart dropped in learning of this end to an otherwise wonderful day and evening celebrating our city's world boxing champion. We held a great parade and great event at Heartland of America park. The evening birthday party at Steelhouse, which I and members of my team attended, was a showing of joy and pride. Omaha needs to remember this important day as a good one while we seek answers to how it ended.</p><p>\"Meanwhile, we must ensure that every resident, no matter who they are, feels safe and respected in Omaha.\"</p></blockquote><p>Crawford recently defeated Canelo Alvarez via unanimous decision to <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/boxing/news/canelo-alvarez-terence-crawford-fight-live-updates-scorecard-results/live/\" target=\"_blank\">take the undisputed super middleweight title</a>.

That put the Razorbacks in a bit of a bind, since Nutt won the SEC West three times and produced winning seasons in all but three of his years at Arkansas.</p>\n<p>Around the same time, Petrino, who saw his coaching star rise at <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/teams/LVILLE/louisville-cardinals/\">Louisville</a> from 2003-06, was flaming out in his first <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://cbssports.com/nfl/\">NFL</a> opportunity with the Atlanta Falcons. Petrino made it just 13 games with the Falcons -- which is tied with Holtz and Urban Meyer for the third-shortest non-interim tenure in NFL history -- before he resigned, interviewed with Arkansas, and made his return to the college game.</p><p>He won just two SEC games while going 5-7 in his first year at Arkansas. In 2009, he turned that into an 8-5 record punctuated by a win against <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/teams/ECU/east-carolina-pirates/\">East Carolina</a> in the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/teams/LIB/liberty-flames/\">Liberty</a> Bowl, giving the Razorbacks their first postseason victory since 2003.</p><p>Arkansas took it to another level in 2010. The Razorbacks won 10 regular-season games and made it to the Sugar Bowl, where they lost to <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/teams/OHIOST/ohio-state-buckeyes/\">Ohio State</a>.</p>\n<p>The 2011 season cemented Arkansas' status as an ascendant SEC competitor. Petrino led the Razorbacks to just their third 11-win season in program history, and first since 1977, and Arkansas finished at No. 5 in the AP Top 25 after beating <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/teams/KSTATE/kansas-state-wildcats/\">Kansas State</a> in the Cotton Bowl.</p><p>That's when things started to unravel.</p><h2>The unceremonious end </h2><p>In April 2012, Petrino was involved in a motorcycle accident while driving on the highway. He initially claimed that he was alone on the vehicle when the mishap occurred. </p><p>But, as reports started to assert otherwise, Petrino admitted that he was on the motorcycle with former Arkansas volleyball player Jessica Dorrell, who he had hired in March of that same year as a member of his recruiting staff. He also admitted to an affair with Dorrell. </p>\n<p>Petrino was fired for cause nine days after the accident after an Arkansas investigation accused Petrino of misleading the administration during Dorrell's hiring process and in the days following the motorcycle accident. Arkansas also found that Petrino frequently sent Dorrell gifts, and that he was part of the hiring committee when she was granted her position with the football program. </p><p>There is no justification,\" Petrino said in a <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/college-football/story/_/id/8251166/bobby-petrino-fired-arkansas-razorbacks-coach-apologizes-interview-espn\" target=\"_blank\">2012 interview with ESPN</a>. \"There is no excuse for having her in the interview pool, hiring her, having her on the back of the motorcycle. I look back on it and there is no good answer. I wasn't thinking and I wasn't acting correctly.</p><p>\"That's not how I was raised. That's not how I raised my children. I take responsibility for it and I am really sorry. I have played it over and over in my head a million times. How could I do this? How could this happen? And not just the hiring. Or that day. But my actions, my behavior -- for months it was just wrong.\"</p>\n<h2>The return and potential redemption </h2><p>It didn't take long for Petrino to make his return to the coaching ranks. He was hired at <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/teams/WKY/western-kentucky-hilltoppers/\">Western Kentucky</a> in Dec. 2012 and, after one year with the Hilltoppers, made his way back to Louisville, where he posted a 77-35 record over five years. </p><p>From 2020-22, he led <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/teams/MOST/missouri-state-bears/\">Missouri State</a> at the FCS level and then started to work his way back into the FBS ranks as an offensive coordinator under Jimbo Fisher at <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/teams/TXAM/texas-am-aggies/\">Texas A&M</a> in 2023. He made it one season with the Aggies before Pittman brought him back to the Natural State. </p><p>He's certainly left his mark as a play-caller. Arkansas' offense has been one of the lone bright spots for the program in recent years. The Razorbacks finished the 2024 season second in the SEC in total yards (459.2 yards per game) while scoring 30.9 points per game. </p>\n<p>They're off to another strong start in 2025. They're one of four SEC programs to average at least 500 yards per game and Arkansas is third in the SEC. The Razorbacks also scored at least 30 points in all four games before Saturday's 56-13 loss to <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/teams/ND/notre-dame-fighting-irish/\">Notre Dame</a>. </p><p>His offense has played well enough that he's earned another look in Arkansas' coaching search. The fact that Arkansas hired him as an assistant and then trusted him as the program's shepherd in a time of transition shows that it may have moved on enough from his past to consider him a legitimate candidate.  </p>\n            </div>"

    "body": "<div>\n        <p>FAYETTEVILLE, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/teams/ARK/arkansas-razorbacks/\">Arkansas</a> -- Sam Pittman saved Arkansas five years ago from the dregs of the SEC.</p><p>On Sunday, <span><a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/news/arkansas-fires-sam-pittman-razorbacks-move-on-from-football-coach-amid-2-3-start-and-32-344-overall-record/\" target=\"_blank\">he lost his job</a></span>.</p><p>Arkansas fired its 63-year-old coach a day after a humiliating 56-13 loss to <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/teams/ND/notre-dame-fighting-irish/\">Notre Dame</a>, ending a tenure that once felt like a dream marriage between a lovable, beer-drinking everyman and a program desperate for stability. Pittman leaves Fayetteville with a 32-34 record and three bowl appearances, but also with a fan base that turned on him in the final weeks.</p><p>In Arkansas, where moods rise and fall with the Hogs, life has been too humble for too long. The latest defeat was the fourth straight home loss to a power program by double digits, and it cemented the perception that Pittman had lost himself in a Hog trough only growing darker and deeper. It was also Notre Dame's biggest win ever over an active SEC opponent and Arkansas' worst home loss in five years.</p><p>The fan response told the story. A small but vocal contingent chanted \"Fire Pittman!\" after Notre Dame grabbed a 42-13 lead with nine seconds left in the first half. Irish fans quickly drowned it out, but the boos poured down again as Pittman led the Hogs into the locker room. The traditional \"Calling of the Hogs\" never materialized. Three-quarters of the student section emptied during the third quarter.</p>\n<p>Afterward, Pittman admitted he understood the anger. </p><p>\"If I was a fan I'd be mad at me, too,\" he told CBS Sports. \"I'd be frustrated as hell with me. Hell, I'm mad at me, to be perfectly honest.\"</p><p>It was a jarring fall for a coach who once carried the hopes of Hog Nation. Pittman took over a program that had lost 20 straight SEC games during the disastrous Chad Morris era and quickly turned it into one of the most entertaining teams in the league. His second season produced nine wins and a victory over <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/teams/PSU/penn-state-nittany-lions/\">Penn State</a> in the Outback Bowl, Arkansas' first nine-win campaign since Bobby Petrino's final year in 2011.</p><p>But history has a way of repeating itself in Fayetteville, with Petrino again at the center. Twelve years after he was fired in shame for lying about an affair with a subordinate, Pittman stunned the industry by bringing Petrino back as offensive coordinator to rescue his own tenure. For a while, it worked: Petrino's no-nonsense demeanor and creative offense gave the Hogs a lift, carrying them to a bowl. But cracks remained, and they widened this fall.</p>\n<p>A staggering 39 transfer departures in the offseason made Arkansas the most transient program in the SEC the past two years, according to 247Sports. The reloaded roster never meshed. Costly late-game fumbles doomed potential wins over <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/teams/MISS/ole-miss-rebels/\">Ole Miss</a> and <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/teams/MEMP/memphis-tigers/\">Memphis</a>, while Petrino's high-powered offense managed only 16 points in the last six quarters dating back to the Memphis loss. Against Notre Dame, the defense delivered a lowlight reel of busted assignments, missed tackles and lethargic effort. The Irish rolled up 420 first-half yards.</p><p>Pittman's final game also underscored why the once-dominant Razorbacks' trenches no longer measure up. The Hogs were bullied up front, just as they were last season in three losses where they were out-rushed and finished 102nd nationally in rushing yards. This year's team entered with hope after climbing into the top 30 in rushing offense, but Notre Dame shredded Arkansas' defensive front and left the crowd in stunned silence.</p><p>Now the attention turns to what's next. Arkansas athletics director Hunter Yurachek has tapped Petrino to lead the team on an interim basis, and seems open to the possibility of making it permanent down the road, depending on performance -- a once improbable scenario considering how his last tenure with the school ended.</p>\n<p>\"We will begin a national search for our next head coach immediately and that search will include Coach Petrino, who has expressed his desire to be a candidate for the full-time job,\" Yurachek said in a statement released by the team. </p><p>We may soon be staring through the looking glass, if that happens.</p><p>Still, Pittman deserves credit for his accomplishments. He pulled Arkansas out of the ashes of the Morris era, delivered stability and bowl trips, and briefly restored pride. His genuine personality and everyman image made him one of the most huggable coaches in the sport. But results matter, and they fell short of what boosters, fans and administrators demand in the SEC.</p><p>Yurachek acknowledged two weeks ago that Arkansas is \"not built to win a national title\" under its current NIL framework, a statement that drew criticism throughout the department. Arkansas' booster base is flush with cash, and building a plan to attack the coaching carousel with a deep well of NIL dollars is possible, but is it attainable with so many questions surrounding the administration's future as well? Better yet, can the big money men at Tyson Chicken, Walmart and even Jerry Jones, an Arkansas alum, be convinced to flood the bank vault with cash?</p>\n<p>Arkansas is a state that loves its sons, but it is rarely able to keep them home. Championship coaches Jimmy Johnson and Barry Switzer played and coached for the Hogs, and both received interest -- or were passed over -- for the head gig. In 2006, the Razorbacks chased off Arkansas native Gus Malzahn, who rebuilt himself and won a national title as a coordinator and later led <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/teams/AUBURN/auburn-tigers/\">Auburn</a> to an SEC title as head coach. The Hogs showed interest in bringing Malzahn back home the day after Auburn lost in the 2017 SEC Championship Game, and there was interest from both sides, but talks fell apart. <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/teams/SMU/smu-mustangs/\">SMU</a> coach Rhett Lashlee grew up an Arkansas fan in nearby Springdale, Arkansas, and was a walk-on for the Hogs. He led the Mustangs to the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://cbssports.com/college-football/\">College Football</a> Playoff last season.</p><p>The end seemed near in the immediate wake of the loss Saturday afternoon. When Pittman left his final press conference Saturday, his wife grew emotional and he offered a hug to Jamie. \"It's OK, hun,\" he told her in his unmistakable southern tone.</p>\n<p>The Hog Calls will return someday. The question now: who will be there to lead them?</p>\n            </div>"

At this time, however, I feel a change is necessary to put our student-athletes and program in the best position to be successful. The goal for our football program is to be highly competitive within the Southeastern Conference and compete for a national championship. </p><p>\"As we move forward in the process of finding our next head coach, I am certain we will be able to provide the necessary resources to our staff and team to reach our goals. We will begin a national search for our next head coach immediately and that search will include Coach Petrino, who has expressed his desire to be a candidate for the full-time job.\"</p>\n<p>Since finishing 9-4 overall and finding a spot inside the final AP Top 25 poll to conclude the 2021 season, the Razorbacks have sputtered under Pittman's guidance despite a bevy of coaching staff changes and roster alterations annually in recruiting and through the transfer portal.</p><p>The Razorbacks suffered a couple costly penalties and mistakes against the Tigers in Week 4, before failing to show defensively against the 22nd-ranked Irish at home. Previously during the SEC opener at <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/teams/MISS/ole-miss-rebels/\">Ole Miss</a>, Arkansas fell 41-35 after several missed opportunities, including a fumble in the final moments in position to take the lead.</p><h2>🏈 Sam Pittman's tenure as Arkansas coach</h2><table> <thead><tr><th>Season</th><th>Overall Record</th><th>SEC Record</th><th>Bowl / Postseason</th><th><br /></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>2020</td><td>3–7</td><td>3–7</td><td><strong>No bowl</strong> (season impacted by COVID‑19)</td><td><br /></td></tr><tr><td>2021</td><td>9–4</td><td>4–4</td><td><strong>Outback Bowl</strong> -- 24-10 win over <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/teams/PSU/penn-state-nittany-lions/\">Penn State</a></td><td><br /></td></tr><tr><td>2022</td><td>7–6</td><td>3–5</td><td><strong><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/teams/LIB/liberty-flames/\">Liberty</a> Bowl</strong> -- 55-53 win over <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/teams/KANSAS/kansas-jayhawks/\">Kansas</a> (3OT)</td><td><br /></td></tr><tr><td>2023</td><td>4–8</td><td>1–7</td><td><strong>No bowl </strong></td><td><br /></td></tr><tr><td>2024</td><td>7–6</td><td>3–5</td><td><strong>Liberty Bowl</strong> -- 39-26 win over <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/teams/TXTECH/texas-tech-red-raiders/\">Texas Tech</a></td><td><br /></td></tr><tr><td>2025</td><td>2-3</td><td>0-1</td><td>N/A</td><td><br /></td></tr></tbody></table><p>Yurachek said earlier this month at the Little Rock Touchdown Club that the Arkansas football program was \"not set up to win a national championship\" and was \"brutally honest\" about his university not wanting to operate in the \"third lane\" with others not up to code with the current guidelines. </p>\n<p>These remarks were similar to what Pittman has said previously about facing an uphill climb against other SEC rosters but noted he felt things would even out a bit with revenue sharing in the future.</p><p>Now, he's not going to get an opportunity to show that in Fayetteville. And in his final 12 games at Arkansas that were decided by a single possession, Pittman was just 2-10 including a pair of losses this season.</p><p>Pittman has dealt with job-related questions the last two seasons with the Razorbacks, <a href=\"https://247sports.com/longformarticle/arkansas-football-sam-pittman-addresses-job-security-after-humiliating-auburn-loss-220184293/\" target=\"_blank\">those murmurs coming to a head in November 2023 following</a> a 48-10 home loss to <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/teams/AUBURN/auburn-tigers/\">Auburn</a>. Pittman was granted another season, managing a 7-6 finish last fall, and was preparing for a last hurrah of sorts in 2025 with his future on the line.</p>\n<p>Pittman addressed job security speculation over the summer at SEC Media Days.</p><p>\"We've got to learn how to finish games and to me it's all about turnovers right now, and if we can get more,\" Pittman said. \"We need to get more. It's not just the offense turning it over. We have to get more, and if we can take care of the ball better, which we believe that we can — we all understand the offense a little bit better — then we could have a very special season because of the way our schedule lines up.\"</p><p>Finishing games was always an issue for Pittman at Arkansas. The Razorbacks were 7-19 overall in single-possession games during his tenure and only finished with a record of .500 or better in SEC play once in six seasons.</p>\n            </div>"

Kinney is considered a five-star prospect and is ranked the No. 1 point guard in the class, according to 247Sports. </p>\n<p>The Newport, Kentucky native is playing with the Overtime Elite developmental program in Atlanta, where he averaged 20.1 points and five assists per game last season. He also considered Arkansas, Indiana, Kentucky, Louisville and Oregon.</p>\n<p>In a slow-moving recruiting cycle, Kinney is an important early domino. Of the 15 players with a five-star prospect grade in the 247Sports rankings, he is just the third to announce a college commitment. Kinney will also set the tone for the Jayhawks' class as he is KU's first pledge of the cycle.</p><p>The 6-foot-1 playmaker has demonstrated natural scoring ability during his time on the grassroots and high school circuits, but he's not lacking as a passer. He averaged 20.1 points and five assists per game last season for the Overtime Elite developmental program in Atlanta. 247Sports director of scouting Adam Finkelstein <a href=\"https://247sports.com/player/taylen-kinney-46140678/\" target=\"_blank\">referred to Kinney</a> as a \"playmaking lead guard who is smooth and versatile with his attack.\"</p>\n<p>\"He's great in drive-and-kick actions, can make pick-and-roll reads, and understands how to feed the post,\" Finkelstein wrote. \"He also has a pretty good feel, even while in attack mode, of how to utilize his versatility to make plays without pounding the ball or settling unnecessarily.\"</p><p>By landing Kinney, Kansas is putting the early framework together for a backcourt overhaul in 2026-27. While ballyhooed freshman Darryn Peterson is set to lead Kansas' offensive attack this season, he is regarded as a near-lock to be a one-and-done departure for the 2026 NBA Draft.</p>\n<p>Transfer additions Melvin Council Jr. and Jayden Dawson are also using their final season of eligibility in 2025-26, which means KU's guard rotation will likely look much different in 2026-27. Kinney could be a significant factor in that equation.</p>\n            </div>\n    </div>"

    "body": "<div>\n        <p>The 45th playing of the Ryder Cup may have been the most anticipated in event history with the United States and Europe squaring off as near-equal sides at Bethpage Black in Farmingdale, New York. After 16 matches and two days of competition, it's clear that equality only existed on paper as Europe has opened up a substantial 11.5 to 4.5 lead on the U.S., creating a round of Sunday singles that may be more performative in deciding a victor than anything else. <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/golf/news/ryder-cup-2025-live-updates-results-scores-standings-day-3-singles/live/\" target=\"_blank\">Follow 2025 Ryder Cup live updates, results and scores from Sunday singles on Day 3.</a></p><p>One of the most remarkable public courses in the nation is where the Americans were seeking to regain the trophy with Europe aiming to not only hold it but pick up the first road victory in the challenge in 13 years by capturing the 2025 Ryder Cup outright. The Europeans are on the precipice of doing just that only needing 2.5 points to lift the trophy, 3 points to win the Ryder Cup definitively for a second straight year.</p><p>Four years ago, the United States put together its youngest and perhaps most-talented Ryder Cup team of all time. Now, it boasts a young captain in 39-year-old Keegan Bradley whose immense passion for the event was thought to ideally fuel an American side bringing four rookies into the competition. There's an argument that <span><a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/golf/news/ryder-cup-2025-keegan-bradley-captain-team-usa-united-states-dream-nightmare-bethpage-black/\" target=\"_blank\">pressure on Bradley has created a difficult situation</a></span> for not only the captain but his entire team.</p><p>On the other side, Luke Donald is captaining a European team that won the Ryder Cup in a rout just two years ago in Rome. Donald is not only going for back-to-back trophies, he aims to etch his name in event history by winning the Ryder Cup as not only the top player in the world (2012) but twice as a captain.</p><p>Through those first 16 matches, Europe's best are dominating the top Americans. Tommy Fleetwood (4-0-0) and Rory McIlroy (3-0-1) are blemish-free, whereas world No. 1 Scottie Scheffler (0-4-0) became the <span><a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/golf/news/ryder-cup-2025-scottie-scheffler-history/\" target=\"_blank\">first golfer to go winless across the first four sessions</a></span> in modern history and the only top-ranked player to ever do so.</p>\n<p>No matter how it shakes out, this Ryder Cup is going to continue to be a barn burner, one unlike anything that has been seen before in this event -- all in front of a rowdy New York crowd.</p><p>Take a look at the <span><a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/golf/news/ryder-cup-2025-schedule-dates-format-explained-teams-bethpage-black/\" target=\"_blank\">complete Ryder Cup schedule of events</a></span>, <span><a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/golf/news/ryder-cup-future-locations-winners-by-year-team-usa-europe-2025-bethpage-black/\" target=\"_blank\">where the Ryder Cup is headed in future years</a></span> and keep reading for the full slate of viewing information so you can watch all the action Sunday.</p><h2> 2025 Ryder Cup TV schedule </h2><p><em>All times Eastern</em></p><h3>Day 3 -- Sunday, Sept. 28</h3><p><strong>Singles:</strong> 12:02 p.m.</p>\n<p><strong>Live TV coverage:</strong> 12-6 p.m. on NBC<br /><strong>Streaming:</strong> 12-6 p.m. on <a href=\"https://www.fubo.tv/lp/sports/?irad=368998&irmp=416484&utm_source=CBSi_GeneralSports&utm_campaign=CBSi\" target=\"_blank\">Fubo</a> (Try for free) and RyderCup.com</p>\n            </div>"

Winning the last two events held in the United States -- including a record 19 to 9 victory at Whistling Straits in 2021 -- the red, white and blue look to keep this trend alive after Europe got the upper hand at the 2023 playing in Rome.</p><p>Things got off to a rocky start on Friday, however, as the Europeans dominated the morning session of alternate shot. They won three of the four matches and closed them all out in emphatic fashion (4 & 3, 5 & 3 and 5 & 4). The Americans salvaged a point thanks to Patrick Cantlay and Xander Schauffele taking their match 2UP. </p><p>The afternoon session of fourballs got off to a bit better start with American teams taking the first hole in two of the matches and drawing even in the others. But Europe slowly took back control to take the session 2-1-1. Europe heads into Saturday with a 3-point lead, the first time they have done so at a Ruder Cup in the U.S. since 2004. The Americans are looking for more answers and better form from their top players when they tee off the next two days.</p>\n<p>Check out a full slate of <span><a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/golf/news/ryder-cup-predictions-odds-picks-best-bets-2025-team-usa-europe-bethpage-black/\" target=\"_blank\">Ryder Cup predictions and expert picks</a></span> from CBS Sports along with the <span><a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/golf/news/ryder-cup-2025-tv-schedule-how-to-watch-live-tee-times/\" target=\"_blank\">Ryder Cup TV schedule</a></span> breakdown from Friday-Sunday and a <span><a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/golf/news/ryder-cup-2025-predictions-team-usa-europe-roster-rankings/\" target=\"_blank\">power ranking of the Ryder Cup rosters from 1-24</a></span>.</p><h2>2025 Ryder Cup format, rules</h2><p>The first two days of the Ryder Cup (Friday, Saturday) are firmly entrenched in team-based golf. Golfers from the United States and Europe will compete in two sessions each day: foursomes (alternate shot) in the morning and four-ball (best ball) in the afternoon. Day 3, held Sunday, will see golfers compete head-to-head in singles matches. </p><p><strong>Foursomes (Friday, Saturday morning):</strong> Teams of two from each side square off against one another as golfers alternate hitting the same ball until it is holed. For example: If Player A hits the tee shot on No. 1, he is responsible for teeing off across all odd-numbered holes. Player B will hit the approach into No. 1 with the roles reversing on the even-numbered holes where Player B will hit the tee shots and Player A will go second. </p>\n<p>There is significant strategy involved in forming these pairings with consideration given to equipment, personalities and skillsets. As such, this format has proven crucial to victory across the last two Ryder Cups as the U.S. went 6-2 in 2021 and Europe went 7-1 in 2023.</p><p><strong>Four-ball (Friday, Saturday afternoon):</strong> Teams of two from each side compete with all four golfers playing their own ball. The lowest score between the two players from each team counts for that hole with the other two scores essentially thrown out.</p><p><strong>Singles (Sunday):</strong> The entirety of the American and European sides will compete in 12 one-on-one matches. Unlike the Presidents Cup, where captains announce each spot in their lineup one after another, the Ryder Cup makes it so captains fill out their lineups without the knowledge of what the other side is doing.</p>\n<h2>2025 Ryder Cup scoring</h2><p><strong>Event scoring: </strong>A total of 28 points are up for grabs throughout the three days and five sessions of play. With Europe winning the 2023 Ryder Cup and holding possession of the trophy, it only needs to win 14 points to retain, while the United States needs at least 14.5 points to win outright. This is because a tie would allow the trophy to remain with the reigning champions. </p><p><strong>Match scoring:</strong> Each match is worth 1 point. Matches that end in a tie lead to 0.5 points being awarded to each side. Each hole is scored independently with the lowest score winning. If both teams or players have the same score on a hole, the hole is considered tied.</p><p>There is nuance with match-play scoring. For example: If Team A wins the first two holes, its lead is noted as \"2 UP\". If Team B wins the third hole, the margin would be reduced with Team A holding a \"1 UP\" lead. Matches can therefore end before all 18 holes are played if the lead surpasses the number of remaining holes remaining. Team A being 4 UP through 15 holes would end the match with a score of 4&3 (4 -- margin, 3 -- holes remaining).</p>\n<p><strong>Concessions:</strong> This has become a bit contentious in recent iterations of the Ryder Cup. Unlike stroke play, teams or players do not need to complete each hole if the opposing side deem their next shot highly makable (think: tap-in putt) or if attempting the stroke will not result in winning or tying the hole.</p><h2>2025 Ryder Cup schedule, dates</h2><p><em>All times Eastern</em></p><h3>Wednesday, Sept. 24</h3><p><strong>Opening Ceremony:</strong> 4 p.m.</p><h3>Thursday, Sept. 25</h3><p><strong>Friday pairing announcement:</strong> 4 p.m.</p><h3>Day 1 -- Friday, Sept. 26</h3><p><strong>Session 1 (foursomes):</strong> 7:10 a.m.<br /><strong>Session 2 (four-ball):</strong> 12:25 p.m.</p><h3>Day 2 -- Saturday, Sept. 27</h3><p><strong>Session 3 (foursomes):</strong> 7:10 a.m.<br /><strong>Session 4 (four-ball):</strong> 12:25 p.m.</p><h3>Day 3 -- Sunday, Sept. 28</h3><p><strong>Session 5 (singles):</strong> 12:02 p.m.</p><h2>2025 Ryder Cup teams</h2><h3>Automatic qualifiers</h3><table><tbody><tr><th>United States (OWGR)</th><th>Europe (OWGR)</th></tr><tr><td><p>Scottie Scheffler (1)</p></td><td><p>Rory McIlroy (2)</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Xander Schauffele (3)</p></td><td><p>Tommy Fleetwood (6)</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Russell Henley (4)</p></td><td><p>Robert MacIntyre (9)</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>J.J.

What a cool thing to have witnessed in person.\"    </p><p>Bradley's problem? <span><a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/golf/news/ryder-cup-2025-team-usa-united-states-outclassed-europe/\" target=\"_blank\">His stars have almost completely no-showed to this point.</a></span> Scottie Scheffler and Bryson DeChambeau are a combined 1-7-0, including a 3 & 2 loss on Saturday afternoon playing together for the first time since 2021. The United States will need a whole team of Tom Bradys to make this tortured comparison work, and nothing has indicated that's possible through four sessions of play at Bethpage Black.    </p><p>Both teams will send their best out early, as Donald hopes to close out the Ryder Cup quickly, while Bradley needs a ton of early points to even make a miraculous comeback a possibility. The most exciting singles match is one many were hoping for to start the week: Scottie Scheffler and Rory McIlroy will square off fourth come Sunday.   </p>\n<p>That could end up being decisive depending what happens inside the first three matches ahead of them, but it may not be as dramatic as fans hoped it would be entering the week.   </p><p>Check out a full breakdown of the <span><a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/golf/news/ryder-cup-2025-schedule-dates-format-explained-teams-bethpage-black/\" target=\"_blank\">2025 Ryder Cup schedule and playing format</a></span> along with a complete <span><a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/golf/news/ryder-cup-2025-tv-schedule-how-to-watch-live-tee-times/\" target=\"_blank\">2025 Ryder Cup TV schedule and coverage guide</a></span> so you can watch all the remaining action Sunday.</p><h2>          2025 Ryder Cup matchups: Day 3 (Sunday)</h2><p><em>Odds via <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/betting/news/draftkings-promo-code/\">DraftKings Sportsbook</a></em></p><p><em>Session 5 -- Singles<br />        </em>        </p><table><tbody><tr><th>Match</th><th>Europe</th><th>Tee time</th><th>United States</th></tr><tr><td><p>17 \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t</p></td><td>Justin Rose<br /> +105<br />  </td><td>12:02 p.m.</td><td><p>Cameron Young<br /> -145<br />   \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>18 \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t</p></td><td>\t\t\t\tTommy Fleetwood<br />-145</td><td>\t\t\t\t12:13 p.m.</td><td><p>Justin Thomas<br />+105</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>19 \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t</p></td><td>\t\t\t\tMatt Fitzpatrick<br />+130</td><td>\t\t\t\t12:24 p.m.</td><td><p>Bryson DeChambeau -160<br />   \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>20 \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t</p></td><td>\t\t\t\tRory McIlroy<br />+120</td><td>\t\t\t\t12:35 p.m.</td><td><p>Scottie Scheffler<br />-145</p></td></tr><tr><td>21</td><td>Ludvig Åberg<br />+110</td><td>\t\t\t\t12:46 p.m.</td><td>\t\t\t\tPatrick Cantlay<br />-135</td></tr><tr><td>22</td><td>\t\t\t\tJon Rahm<br />-145</td><td>\t\t\t\t12:57 p.m.</td><td>\t\t\t\tXander Schauffele<br />+120</td></tr><tr><td>23</td><td>\t\t\t\tSepp Straka<br />+115</td><td>\t\t\t\t1:08 p.m.</td><td>\t\t\t\tJ.J.
