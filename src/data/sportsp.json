    "body": "<div>\n        <p>Weekends like these are why we endure the dog days of summer. Why we count down the days until seasons are back. Why we can't wait until that hint of fall is in the air. Why we, simply, are sports fans. The final weekend of September is setting up to be one of the greatest sporting weekends in recent memory.</p><p>Let's start with the Ryder Cup, hosted at the iconic Bethpage Black Course just outside New York City. Team USA and Team Europe will battle for bragging rights in front of a raucous crowd unlike any you'd get at other golf events. The biggest stars are out, and the unique format -- with team events Friday and Saturday and 12 singles matches on Sunday -- ensures every minute will be filled with drama. Prepare for plenty of champagne popping come Sunday evening.</p><p>That last sentence applies in the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://cbssports.com/mlb/\">MLB</a>, too. There are still four playoff spots to be determined in this sprint to the finish. The Tigers have experienced a historic collapse, up from 15.5 games in the AL Central to fighting for their playoff lives. And could the Mets really miss the postseason? There's a ton on the table.</p><p>The WNBA playoffs have already begun, and both semifinals -- Aces-Fever and Lynx-Mercury -- are tied at 1-1. One would think Las Vegas and Minnesota are on a collision course, but Indiana (<span><a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/wnba/news/caitlin-clark-injury-indiana-fever-wnba-playoffs-2025-status/\" target=\"_blank\">without Caitlin Clark, no less</a></span>) and Phoenix have already proved their mettle.</p>\n<p>Finally, every Saturday and Sunday in September has plenty of football. Not all of them have this sort of lineup, though. Among the college highlights are No. 6 Penn State hosting its annual whiteout against No. 3 Oregon, No. 4 LSU visiting No. 13 Ole Miss and No. 17 Alabama heading to No. 5 Georgia.</p><p>In the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://cbssports.com/nfl/\">NFL</a> ranks, Micah Parsons makes his return to Dallas after his shocking trade from the Cowboys to the Packers, and two top AFC contenders -- the Ravens and the Chiefs -- try to avoid falling to 1-3 when they meet in Kansas City on CBS.</p><p>So, what are we here at CBS Sports looking forward to most? It's hard to choose just one, but here's what we'll have on our screen -- or at least on our main screen -- over the next few days.</p>\n<h2>Ryder Cup</h2><p>There's a lot of great football on this weekend. None of those games are particularly unique, though. The Ryder Cup is played biennially, and many golf experts believe there has never been a more significant edition of the event than the one being played at Bethpage Black in New York over the next few days. The sides are relatively even, world No. 1 Scottie Scheffler headlines an American side no longer as strong as it was just four years ago, Keegan Bradley is perhaps the most exciting U.S. captain ever, and Europe absolutely ran through the Americans at the last playing in Rome. Could this be the year the road Ryder Cup streak is broken? Will Rory McIlroy come through in his last great bid to accomplish that feat on U.S. soil? The Long Island crowd will be raucous, the outfits will be exceptional, and the golf could potentially be legendary. <strong>– <em>Adam Silverstein</em></strong></p><p>The Ryder Cup will be front and center on my TV all day Friday and again on Sunday afternoon. Shoot, it'll even take center stage on Saturday morning over the usual <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://cbssports.com/college-football/\">college football</a> preview shows. Once noon hits, I'll be dialed in to a blockbuster day of <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://cbssports.com/college-football/\">college football</a> action for work purposes, but the action from Bethpage Black will likely still find a place in my quadbox. There is nothing like the pageantry and intensity of the Ryder Cup, as an individual sport morphs into the ultimate team endeavor for a weekend. <strong>– <em>David Cobb</em></strong></p><a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/golf/news/ryder-cup-2025-team-usa-united-states-keegan-bradley-win-bethpage-black/\" target=\"_blank\">\n        <div>\n            <div>\n                <p>How United States can overcome pressure to win 2025 Ryder Cup, proving Keegan Bradley's candidacy valid</p>\n                <p>\n                    Patrick McDonald                </p>\n            </div>\n                            <div>\n    <figure><img alt=\"How United States can overcome pressure to win 2025 Ryder Cup, proving Keegan Bradley's candidacy valid\" src=\"https://sportshub.cbsistatic.com/i/r/2025/09/24/0b0002a8-a477-4224-aea2-06e8b0f540a7/thumbnail/270x152/648f2a9d9214650b39bc9446e06e4774/ryder-cup-scottie-scheffler-jj-spaun-2025.jpg\" /></figure>\n                </div>\n                    </div>\n    </a>\n<p>The Ryder Cup has been all bark and no bite for the last decade, but this year it will change. Two evenly matched squads with their own history and hurdles to overcome. On the European side, Rory McIlroy looks to call his shot successfully, a la Babe Ruth, after leading the drubbing of the U.S. in Rome in what is likely the final best shot of his career to win a Ryder Cup on American soil. Luke Donald can become arguably the greatest European captain as well in his second stint as headman. For the home team, Bradley can go from outside the boys club to sitting at the head of the table if he brings the cup back home. Throw in the New York crowd, the vagaries of match play and different playing formats, as well as characters such as Bryson DeChambeau and Tyrrell Hatton, and a good time is bound to happen. <strong>– <em>Patrick McDonald</em></strong></p>\n<p>I'm a certified golf sicko, but consider this my formal proposal to move the Ryder Cup to August so I can actually watch the whole thing. Going up against football means the only significant time I get to spend watching it is on Sunday afternoon if the U.S. is in striking distance. It's a special window of time to remember golf exists, and it's a time-honored tradition of mine to completely ignore it if we're being drubbed by the lads from across the pond. Call me a frontrunner or a guy who's just too locked into the gridiron, but September means football season.<strong> –</strong> <strong><em>Richard Johnson</em> </strong></p><h2>College football</h2><h3>No. 6 Oregon at No. 3 Penn State</h3><p>There are literally so many options to choose from this weekend, but I'll go with the best game on the college football slate. Sure, if Alabama-Georgia is anything like last year, we are in for another electric game, but I can't wait to watch Penn State vs. Oregon. This game could go a long way in determining who has the inside track to reach the Big Ten Championship Game and brownie points towards a first-round bye in the College Football Playoff. Penn State quarterback Drew Allar has been up and down this season, while Oregon quarterback Dante Moore has shown flashes of why he was such a touted transfer.<strong><em> – Cameron Salerno</em></strong></p><p>The Eagles are playing the Buccaneers this weekend, the Phillies are playing in Game 162 (they have basically everything wrapped up), the Ryder Cup is on, but nothing else matters except this game. Fair warning, I am a Penn State alum and have never missed a  \"White Out\" game -- as a student, alum or journalist. This is the biggest game of the year for PSU to date, and this is Oregon's first visit to Beaver Stadium since the 1960s. Knowing players on the team and how much this game means to them makes the \"White Out\" even more special, especially for the No. 3 team in the country. This is a statement game, and the atmosphere will be like no other. Expect 110,000-plus all wearing white and the stadium to be loud for 3.5 hours.  <strong>– <em>Jeff Kerr</em></strong></p>\n<h3>No. 17 Alabama at No. 5 Georgia</h3><p>While there will be games with more national implications, Alabama-Georgia has something even better: desperation. Kalen DeBoer has one of the hottest seats in college football and desperately needs to remind fans why Alabama hired a no-name from the West Coast. He tends to be the biggest in the most important stops, so don't be surprised if DeBoer and offensive coordinator Ryan Grubb come out with a crazy game plan against the SEC's new standard-bearer. If it goes wrong, I'd expect another big spike on our story about DeBoer's hefty buyout.  <strong><em>– Shehan Jeyarajah</em></strong></p><p>I think I'm contractually obligated to pick the game I'll actually be attending, but even if I wasn't at Alabama-Georgia, it's the college football game that has me most intrigued in what is a stacked overall slate. DeBoer's best moment as Alabama's coach was a win over Georgia a year ago in Tuscaloosa. For all of Kirby Smart's success, he's still only 1-6 against Alabama since he took over in Athens. DeBoer could badly use another marquee win after losing the season opener to Florida State, while you know Smart would love to end the narrative he can't beat the Crimson Tide. From \"<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6YVZJ3n1Ow\" target=\"_blank\">second-and-26</a>\" to last year's fantastic finish, these two teams tend to deliver classics when they meet on the field, and I can't wait to see what this year's edition delivers. <strong><em>– John Talty</em> </strong></p><h3>No. 1 Ohio State at Washington (on CBS/Paramount+)</h3><p>I'd like to echo Richard Johnson's proposal to move the Ryder Cup to August – just as I wish the NASCAR Cup Series Playoffs wrapped up before the football season begins. That said, I'm going to take a different route – one admittedly biased towards the Big Ten on CBS.</p>\n<p>With all the other top-25 matchups happening this Saturday, No. 1 Ohio State at Washington isn't going to grab much national attention. Ryan Day and the Buckeyes are 48-0 against conference opponents not named Michigan or Oregon, but the Huskies bring a 22-game home winning streak in one of the loudest stadiums in college football. If Washington pulls off the upset, it would be an added highlight to an already massive sports weekend. <strong>– Cody Nagel</strong></p><a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/news/no-1-ohio-state-at-washington-has-the-makings-of-jeremiah-smiths-loud-introduction-to-2025s-heisman-party/\" target=\"_blank\">\n        <div>\n            <div>\n                <p>No. 1 Ohio State at Washington has the makings of Jeremiah Smith's loud introduction to 2025's Heisman party</p>\n                <p>\n                    David Cobb                </p>\n            </div>\n                            <div>\n    <figure><img alt=\"No. 1 Ohio State at Washington has the makings of Jeremiah Smith's loud introduction to 2025's Heisman party\" src=\"https://sportshub.cbsistatic.com/i/r/2025/09/25/76402ac4-1d72-497b-b0fa-1857df23281b/thumbnail/270x152/dfca47fbdf96a943943d84a7c2d2f123/jeremiahsmithbuckyes.jpg\" /></figure>\n                </div>\n                    </div>\n    </a>\n<h3>No. 15 Tennessee at Mississippi State </h3><p>Trap game for the No. 15 Vols in Starkville? We're already in Week 5, but this is the their first true road game, and I can already hear those damn cowbells. Tennessee averages 53.5 points per game and has dropped at least 41 points in each contest this season. Mississippi State, on the other hand, allows just 11.8 points per game. Something's gotta give.<strong><em> – Jordan Dajani</em></strong></p><h2><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://cbssports.com/nfl/\">NFL</a></h2><h3>Packers at Cowboys</h3><p>After I picked my jaw up off the floor after seeing Jerry Jones trade Micah Parsons to the Green Bay Packers, I immediately went to check the schedule. <em>Yes!</em> Not only do the Packers and Cowboys play one another in 2025, but it's in Dallas on Sunday Night Football. What a time to be alive! This was one of the most stunning trades in recent NFL history, and now we get to see the star pass rusher almost immediately head back to his old stomping grounds to take on his former team. Sign me up! After being embarrassed by the Browns last week, there's going to be no letup by Parsons and the Packers. On top of trying to right that wrong, Parsons is in line to have a tremendous showing with Dallas' offensive line dealing with a rash of injuries. Get your popcorn ready. <strong>–</strong> <strong><em>Tyler Sullivan</em></strong></p>\n<h3>Ravens vs. Chiefs (on CBS)</h3><p>Kansas City's sluggish start to 2025 doesn't bode well for this game as a fireworks show, but Lamar Jackson is just 1-5 against the Chiefs as a starter for his career, including playoffs. Something has to give here. If he can't steal the spotlight in Arrowhead this time, we'll have grave concerns about Baltimore as a contender. And yet, if Patrick Mahomes and Co. can't defend their own turf and drop to 1-3, well, the sirens will commence in Kansas City as well. In other words, it's a matchup of desperation between two recent MVP quarterbacks, which means we're probably in for a treat.<strong> – <em>Cody Benjamin</em></strong></p><h2><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://cbssports.com/mlb/\">MLB</a> final weekend</h2><p>For most of the year, I was worried these last few days of the season would be a bit lame because so many teams seemed locked into their postseason fate. Instead, we still have a bunch of races and postseason berths up for grabs, thanks largely to the Astros, Mets, and especially the Tigers collapsing. Detroit's trying to avoid the biggest collapse in baseball history. The Astros are staring down the end of their reign. The Mets can't possibly miss the postseason, can they? I mean, sure they can. It's possible. We still have legit races in the AL East and NL West, too. I don't love the three wild card system -- I think there are too many teams in the postseason now -- but credit where it's due: many of these races wouldn't be possible without it.<strong> – <em>Mike Axisa</em></strong></p><p>As a Reds fan, I had forgotten what it was like to watch competitive baseball in September (or even August, for that matter), but that's not the case this year. With the Mets possibly pulling off an all-time choke job in the NL Wild Card race, that has opened the door for the Reds to get to the playoffs for the first time since 2013 (I don't count their fake playoff appearance in 2020 when 16 teams made the postseason during MLB's shortened COVID season). With the Reds in the thick of the race, I'll have my eyes on the Mets, Reds and Diamondbacks as they battle for the final NL Wild Card spot. I forgot how much fun it is to scoreboard watch in September.<strong> – <em>John Breech</em></strong></p>\n<p><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/news/remembering-the-10-worst-late-season-collapses-in-mlb-history-as-2025-tigers-and-mets-threaten-to-join-list/\">Among the possible MLB collapses (Tigers could blow division lead to Guardians)</a>, I'm particularly curious to see what happens to the Mets. I happen to be a lifelong Braves fan (so I have nothing else to root for right now!) who thoroughly enjoyed when Atlanta overcame a 10.5-game deficit to overtake the Mets for the NL East title in 2022. Could the Mets really blow another massive lead just three years later, this time in the NL Wild Card to the Reds? This is the franchise that basically has a blank check from Steve Cohen (but somehow didn't invest in enough pitching). It would be one of the biggest collapses ever, considering they were an MLB-best 45-24 on June 12. They might be taking on a stumbling Marlins team this weekend, but they just lost two out of three to the Nationals and lost three of four to Miami back in late August. This would be exactly the type of series the Mets would lose to finish off a historic letdown. <strong><em>– Doug Clawson</em></strong></p><h2>WNBA playoffs</h2><p>I must admit I'll have the iPad up on the side to keep an eye on the Ryder Cup and the Red Sox's playoff hopes, but my primary focus will be the semifinals of the WNBA playoffs, which are set for a pivotal weekend. Both best-of-five series – the Minnesota Lynx vs. the Phoenix Mercury and the Las Vegas Aces vs. the Indiana Fever – are all square at 1-1. The action will resume Friday with a pair of Game 3s, followed by another doubleheader of Game 4s on Sunday. </p><p>The Lynx and Aces, the top two seeds, were major favorites heading into the semis and seemed destined to meet in the Finals next month. That matchup is no longer a guarantee, and both teams will have to go on the road and win at least one game this weekend to keep their respective seasons alive. The underdog Mercury and Fever, on the other hand, suddenly have a chance to advance to the Finals by defending their home courts. </p>\n<p>Will any of these four teams punch their ticket to the Finals this weekend? Will the Finals matchup be set? Or will we go to sleep Sunday night pondering two winner-take-all Game 5s early next week? The possibilities for this weekend are endless <strong>– <em>Jack Maloney</em></strong></p>\n            </div>"

The most anticipated edition of the storied competition brings the top 12 players from the United States and Europe to Bethpage Black in Farmingdale, New York, for a biennial competition that is about way more than just bragging rights for 24 months.</p><p>The atmosphere for a Ryder Cup at Bethpage will be unlike any other, and based largely on being the home team, the Americans are favored to win back the hardware after losing to the Europeans two years ago in Rome.

Styles, who wrestles John Cena at WWE Crown Jewel, recently confirmed he will retire from professional wrestling in the next year.</p><p>Styles, 48, is beginning his countdown towards retirement. As Styles prepares to wrestle Cena on the latter's <span><a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/wwe/news/john-cena-retirement-date-of-final-wwe-match-set-for-saturday-nights-main-event-in-december/\" target=\"_blank\">farewell tour</a></span>, he admits he'll soon hang up the boots himself.</p><p>\"I will definitely retire within the next year,\" Styles told <a href=\"https://www.tokyo-sports.co.jp/articles/-/360969\" target=\"_blank\">Tokyo Sports</a> (translation by <a href=\"https://prowrestling.net/site/2025/09/25/aj-styles-reveals-his-retirement-plan-and-what-may-follow/\" target=\"_blank\">Pro Wrestling Net</a>). \"I don't want the fans to see me as anyone other than AJ Styles. That's the main reason. I've decided to retire before my body can no longer move.\" </p><p>Styles expects to perform at WrestleMania next year, but said his involvement is unconfirmed. The two-time WWE champion has ambitions to work with WWE as a producer or trainer after retiring from wrestling, but needs more time to sit with that decision.</p>\n<p>\"I haven't decided yet, but I think I'll probably work for WWE,\" he said.  \"It might be good to train young wrestlers to be worthy of being on the  main roster.\"</p><p>Styles is widely regarded as one of the greatest wrestlers of his generation. He came to prominence with TNA Wrestling and Ring of Honor after short stints with WCW and WWE in the early 2000s. \"The Phenomenal One\" was instrumental to TNA's success, particularly as the inaugural X-Division champion. Styles is also TNA's first triple crown and grand slam champion. An innovative performer, AEW star Will Ospreay is among those who credit Styles as a key inspiration.</p>\n<p>Styles' signing with WWE felt like a pipedream. His athletic, small-man style was in many ways the antithesis of WWE's prototypical main event superstar at the time. However, a main event run as New Japan Pro Wrestling's top champion led to communication between Styles and WWE. His 2016 Royal Rumble debut remains one of the loudest, most memorable Rumble entries ever. According to Styles, Vince McMahon tabbed Styles as a midcard act. Again, Styles defied expectations, winning the WWE world heavyweight championship in his debut year. Styles feuded with many of the company's top stars. His feud with Cena, which he revisits at Crown Jewel, is considered one of the best rivalries of Cena's career.</p>\n            </div>\n    </div>"

    "body": "<div>\n        <p>Only four days remain in the 2025 MLB regular season and still there is so much to be decided. Postseason battles, awards races, and much more. What we don't have to wait to decide are our superlatives for the season. Here, via our CBS Sports panel of MLB experts, are 10 superlatives for the year that was. Some serious, some whimsical. Come with us, won't you?  </p><h2>  Most surprising team: <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/teams/MIL/milwaukee-brewers/\">Brewers</a>  </h2><p>I realize the Brewers won the NL Central last season, but not many  predicted them to repeat given the free-agent loss of <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/players/2165933/willy-adames/\">Willy Adames</a>, one  of their best players from a season ago, all the churn in the pitching  staff, and the way the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/teams/CHC/chicago-cubs/\">Cubs</a> looked on paper. Still and yet, the  Brewers not only repeated as division champs but also this season have  been easily the best team in all of baseball -- in terms of wins and  losses and run differential. Of course, the season of their story will  be told on how they fare in October, but I think it's fair to say no one  who's not a Brewers rooter expected Milwaukee to be this great in 2025. <em>-- Dayn Perry</em>    </p><h2>  Most disappointing team: <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/teams/ATL/atlanta-braves/\">Braves</a>  </h2><p>This one's a competitive category. You could argue for the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/teams/BAL/baltimore-orioles/\">Orioles</a>,  Braves, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/teams/TEX/texas-rangers/\">Rangers</a>, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/teams/MIN/minnesota-twins/\">Twins</a>, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/teams/TB/tampa-bay-rays/\">Rays</a>, and <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/teams/SF/san-francisco-giants/\">Giants</a>. Heck, maybe even the  <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/teams/ARI/arizona-diamondbacks/\">Diamondbacks</a> based on preseason expectations and the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/teams/NYM/new-york-mets/\">Mets</a> should they  fail to secure a postseason berth in the final days of the regular  season. While the Braves have found a higher level of late and will wind  up being merely below-average as opposed to bad, they stand out for me.  The expectation was that the bats would get back to something closer to  their 2023 levels, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/players/2837573/spencer-strider/\">Spencer Strider</a> would resume being an ace, and  they'd enjoy better health than they did in 2024. By and large, none of  that happened, and they've secured their first losing season since 2017.  That's the biggest shocker of all at the team level this season, in a  bad way.<em> -- Dayn Perry</em>  </p><h2>  Most improved player: <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/players/2829027/maikel-garcia/\">Maikel Garcia</a>, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/teams/KC/kansas-city-royals/\">Royals</a>  </h2><p>You  could argue for <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/players/2933037/cal-raleigh/\">Cal Raleigh</a>, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/players/2835065/trevor-rogers/\">Trevor Rogers</a>, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/players/2942981/brice-turang/\">Brice Turang</a>, and a slew of  others. I went back and forth on who to spotlight here before landing  on Garcia. This wasn't a case of a player just getting better results;  this was a case of a player improving their processes and being rewarded  for it with a five-win season. Garcia improved almost every facet of  his game: he upped his walk rate and slashed his strikeout rate; he more  than doubled his career home run total while showing more inclination  toward pulling the ball; and he even took the extra base more often  during the run of play. In the span of six months, Garcia elevated  himself from someone who might require a change of scenery to someone  who now looks like a key piece of the Royals core. Good on him. <em>-- R.J. Anderson</em>  </p>\n<h2>  Most disappointing player: Spencer Strider, Braves  </h2><p>Again,  there were plenty of candidates to choose from: <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/players/2211794/sandy-alcantara/\">Sandy Alcantara</a>, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/players/2184468/walker-buehler/\">Walker  Buehler</a>, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/players/3166486/jordan-walker/\">Jordan Walker</a>, and so on. For me, the most obvious choice was  Strider. Before his injury, he was one of my favorite pitchers to watch;  appointment viewing, almost. This year, well, not so much. Strider  fared worse than I think even a pessimist would have projected. I can  only hope that he bounces back next year, but it's going to require some  experimentation on his part this offseason. <em>-- R.J. Anderson</em>  </p><h2>  Best offseason move: <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/players/2507367/juan-soto/\">Juan Soto</a>, Mets  </h2><p>You could make a pretty good argument for <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/players/2836763/garrett-crochet/\">Garrett Crochet</a>, who has fit what the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/teams/BOS/boston-red-sox/\">Red Sox</a> needed so well, and even <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/players/2165919/cody-bellinger/\">Cody Bellinger</a>, who will get some down ballot MVP votes after the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/teams/NYY/new-york-yankees/\">Yankees</a> acquired him for basically nothing, but this has to be Soto. <span><a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/news/how-juan-soto-turned-in-one-of-his-best-mlb-seasons-ever-after-a-disappointing-start-to-765m-mets-contract/\" target=\"_blank\">He's having a terrific season</a></span>, maybe his best ever, and there's no chance the Mets are in wild card position without him. Heck, they're barely in wild card position <em>with</em> him. I know picking the guy who signed a historic $765 million contract as the best offseason move is not the most exciting or original pick, but it is the correct answer, no? So many players sign big money contracts and fail to deliver. Even after a sluggish start to the season (by Soto's standards), Soto is everything the Mets expected. <em>-- Mike Axisa</em>  </p><h2>  Best trade deadline move: <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/players/2211761/harrison-bader/\">Harrison Bader</a>, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/teams/PHI/philadelphia-phillies/\">Phillies</a>  </h2><p>Bader has such incredible Phillies vibes that I'm mad I didn't see it before the deadline. Picked up from the Twins to provide defense and a righty platoon complement for <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/players/2449449/brandon-marsh/\">Brandon Marsh</a>, Bader has hit his way into everyday center field duty. He took a .325/.384/.500 slash line as Phillie into Wednesday's game, and he still plays excellent defense. His 1.5 WAR with Philadelphia eclipses his full-season total in four of the last five years. Honorable mention goes to <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/players/26911802/mason-miller/\">Mason Miller</a>. Yes, <span><a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/news/mason-miller-trade-grades-padres-get-credit-for-huge-swing-as-nail-deal-with-a-return-of-top-prospect/\" target=\"_blank\">the Padres gave up a ton to get him</a></span>, but he's allowed two runs in 21 innings and struck out 39 of 75 (52%) of the batters he's faced with San Diego. <em>-- Mike Axisa</em>  </p>\n<h2>  Best individual game: <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/players/29426033/nick-kurtz/\">Nick Kurtz</a>, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/teams/ATH/athletics/\">Athletics</a>  </h2><p>We had three four-homer games this season (Kurtz, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/players/2135243/kyle-schwarber/\">Kyle Schwarber</a>, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/players/1960254/eugenio-surez/\">Eugenio Suárez</a>) after having three from 2004-24 combined and none from 2018-24. <span><a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/news/athletics-rookie-nick-kurtz-crushes-four-home-runs-vs-astros-as-part-of-historic-day-at-the-plate/\" target=\"_blank\">Kurtz's four-homer game against the Astros on July 25</a></span> stands out because he went 6 for 6 in the game with those four homers and also a double that was thisclose to leaving the yard:  </p>\n<p>Statcast says that double would have been out in six of the 30 MLB parks, a not insignificant number. So, in one game, Kurtz hit four home runs plus another ball that would have been a homer in 20% of the current ballparks. He also became only the ninth player to score six runs in a game, which is a shockingly exclusive club. Schwarber and Suárez had incredible days with their four-homer efforts. Kurtz's was historic though. What a day for that young man.<em> -- Mike Axisa</em>  </p><h2>  Most ridiculous walk-off: Phillies vs. Red Sox  </h2><p>There have been 211 walk-offs this season, including 174 walk-off hits and 51 walk-off home runs (<span><a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/news/watch-giants-stun-phillies-on-patrick-baileys-improbable-walk-off-inside-the-park-three-run-home-run/\" target=\"_blank\">including an inside-the-parker</a></span>). There has also been one walk-off catcher interference. One in the last <em>50 years</em>, that is. On July 21, the Phillies beat the Red Sox when <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/players/2167505/edmundo-sosa/\">Edmundo Sosa</a>'s check swing -- not even a full swing -- clipped catcher <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/players/2824624/carlos-narvez/\">Carlos Narváez</a>'s glove with the bases loaded. The Phillies had the play reviewed, the catcher interference was detected, and the Phillies won the game.  </p>\n<p>\"To be honest, this just feels exactly like a home run,\" Sosa <a href=\"https://www.mlb.com/news/phillies-beat-red-sox-on-walk-off-catcher-s-interference\" target=\"_blank\">said</a> after the game. It was baseball's first walk-off catcher interference since the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/teams/LAD/los-angeles-dodgers/\">Dodgers</a> beat the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/teams/CIN/cincinnati-reds/\">Reds</a> on Aug. 1, 1971. <em>-- Mike Axisa</em>  </p><h2>  Favorite oddity: <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/players/2822182/oneil-cruz/\">Oneil Cruz</a>'s stolen bases  </h2><p>In 2024, 6-foot-5 <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/players/26912505/elly-de-la-cruz/\">Elly De La Cruz</a> became the tallest player in  MLB history to lead the majors in stolen bases. We can do better than  that this year, because 6-foot-7 <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/teams/PIT/pittsburgh-pirates/\">Pirates</a> outfielder Oneil Cruz leads the NL with  38 stolen bases. Cruz won't lead the majors, but he'll  become the tallest player to ever lead his league in stolen bases and  it's the second straight year we've seen this happen. Unfortunately, we  might be waiting a while for this to happen again. So long as we stick  with just the feet-and-inches measurements without fractions, Cruz is  tied for the tallest MLB player along with <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/players/2071264/aaron-judge/\">Aaron Judge</a> and <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/players/26911704/james-wood/\">James Wood</a>.  Still, it was a good two-year run on this front. <em>-- Matt Snyder</em>  </p><h2>  Stupidest storyline: Torpedo bats  </h2><p>We knocked this one out awfully early in 2025. Almost immediately, in fact.  Remember back on the first weekend of the season, the Yankees swept the  Brewers and outscored them 36-14 in doing so. It was only a three-game  series, so the Bronx Bombers averaged 12 runs a game, topping out at 20  on Saturday, March 29. Along the way, it was \"discovered\" that a few  Yankees players were using perfectly-legal-yet-odd-looking bats  that have been dubbed \"torpedo\" bats. It was a perfect storm. It was the  polarizing Yankees and they were scoring a ton of runs using bats that  looked weird but also had a cool-sounding name.   </p>\n<p>The  nadir of the situation was Brewers closer <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/players/2919567/trevor-megill/\">Trevor Megill</a> suggesting the  Yankees were somehow getting special treatment from the league for,  again, using legal bats.   </p><p>\"I think it's  terrible,\" Megill said that weekend. \"We'll see what the data says. I've never seen anything like it  before. I feel like it's something used in slow-pitch softball. It's  genius: Put the mass all in one spot. It might be bush [league]. It  might not be. But it's the Yankees, so they'll let it slide.\"  </p><p>Let <em>what</em> slide?  </p><p>Somehow,  someway, everyone survived the matter without the league completely  falling apart. The league did nothing because there was nothing to do  and the story, after a few days of social media stardom, dissipated. <em>-- Matt Snyder</em>  </p>\n            </div>"

    "body": "<div>\n        <p>Ever since Europe won the Ryder Cup two years ago, a narrative as persisted when discussing the international competition: Why is the United States side not more ... united? Narratives generally do not get created out of thin air. The Americans were a team in chaos two years ago, which is why the selection of captain Keegan Bradley was seen as such an out-of-left-field move. How is a 39 year old whose lone goal was to <em>play</em> the Ryder Cup going to unite his contemporaries in a shared mission -- particularly against a counterpart in Luke Donald who has the European side humming along, almost singing \"Kumbaya\" on its way to Bethpage Black?</p><p>Helping the U.S. along is Ryder Cup history as neither side has been successful on the road since 2012. Will that streak be broken after five playings, or will the Americans level out with their stars and rookies coming together to beat the Europeans. Don't forget: The last time the Ryder Cup was played stateside, the U.S. mopped the floor with Europe with a record-breaking 19-9 victory.</p><p><em><a href=\"https://martech.cbssports.com/bt/redirect/prod?b=betmgm&c=sport\" target=\"_blank\">Bet the Ryder Cup at BetMGM Sportsbook</a>, where new users get up to $1,500 in bonus bets back if their first wager doesn't win. <a href=\"https://martech.cbssports.com/bt/redirect/prod?b=betmgm&c=sport\" target=\"_blank\">Click here</a>:</em></p><p>The United States enters -150 to win the Ryder Cup with Europe holding +175 odds, per Caesars Sportsbook. While Europe can retain by grabbing just 14 points -- given it holds the cup and would maintain possession with a tie -- the U.S. needs 14.5 points for an outright win. Scottie Scheffler and Rory McIlroy are, respectively, <span><a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/golf/news/ryder-cup-2025-odds-betting-lines-props-united-states-europe-bethpage-black/\" target=\"_blank\">favored as the top point scorers for each side</a></span>, but while the Americans are expected to win by prognosticators, they are also <span><a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/golf/news/ryder-cup-2025-teams-players-breakdown-united-states-europe-bethpage-black/\" target=\"_blank\">playing four first-timers</a></span> compared to just one for the Europeans (who was in team meetings two years ago as the brother of another player).</p>\n<p>The talent gap is not as wide as it was four years ago; in fact, Europe has more golfers playing better at this juncture in 2025 than the U.S. That's why CBS Sports has Europe with three of the top four players in the 24-man field as listed in our <span><a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/golf/news/ryder-cup-2025-predictions-team-usa-europe-roster-rankings/\" target=\"_blank\">detailed Ryder Cup rankings</a></span>.</p><p>All of it boils down to the Europeans looking to win consecutive Ryder Cups for the first time since 2010 and 2012, and the United States seeking to maintain its stranglehold on its homeland. Let's take a look at how our CBS Sports experts believe the 2025 Ryder Cup will play out, and feel free to review the <span><a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/golf/news/ryder-cup-2025-teams-player-records-united-states-europe-history/\" target=\"_blank\">all-time Ryder Cup records</a></span> for every golfer on the U.S. and Europe sides.</p><h2>2025 Ryder Cup predictions, expert picks</h2><h3>United States MVP</h3><p><strong>Scottie Scheffler:</strong> The agent of chaos in me wants to roll with someone like Patrick Cantlay, but the U.S. doesn't stand a chance without the world No. 1, and he is going to stand tall this weekend. Scheffler is the clear best player in the world, and he will have a target on his back, which he will wear with pride in both foursomes and four-ball sessions where he draws comfortable partnerships. The putter was a significant issue entering the 2023 competition; that has since been sured up leaving Scheffler in a position to control this Ryder Cup. <em>Odds as top American: 2-1 | top point scorer: 3-1<strong> -- Patrick McDonald</strong></em></p>\n<p><strong>Scottie Scheffler: </strong>Feel free to make a case for others, but Scheffler is <em>the man</em> leading the way for the Americans. He's the best player in the world by a fairly wide margin, and how his matches go will be critical for the belief of players on both sides. If Europe can steal points from the U.S. in Scheffler matches, it will fuel belief on the European side leading to a potential road upset. On the flip side, Scheffler can set the tone for the Americans and help them settle the nerves. If you know that guy is on your team and he's handling his business, suddenly the task of winning 14.5 points feels a bit less daunting. <em>Odds as top American: 2-1 | top point scorer: 3-1<strong> -- Robby Kalland</strong></em></p><p><strong>Scottie Scheffler: </strong>It would be nice to pull out a name like Justin Thomas or Bryson DeChambeau or even a shocker like Collin Morikawa, but how do you pass up the clear-cut No. 1 player in the world? Scheffler has been the best in the business for the last two years straight, and even when he starts tournaments slow, he blows away the competition late. It will be interesting to see whether Bradley runs Scheffler out in all five sessions, but he will be hard pressed not to do so given Scottie's immense dominance. <em>Odds as top American: 2-1 | top point scorer: 3-1<strong> -- Adam Silverstein</strong></em></p><p><em><a href=\"https://martech.cbssports.com/bt/redirect/prod?b=draftkings&c=sport\" target=\"_blank\">Bet Team USA and Team Europe MVPs at DraftKings Sportsbook</a>, where new users get $200 in bonus bets and over $200 off NFL Sunday Ticket:</em></p>\n<h3>Europe MVP</h3><p><strong>Viktor Hovland:</strong> Europe expects contributions from its big three: McIlroy, Rahm and Fleetwood. Hovland will turn that into a core four similar to Rome. Bethpage Black seems like a great fit for him on paper with its rough seemingly trimmed down, which will alleviate the stress caused by his driver and open up the golf course with his irons where he ranks second-best only to Scheffler in 2025. The short game has been serviceable as of late, and he has a real sense of the moment. <em>Odds as top European: 12-1 | top point scorer: 28-1<strong> -- McDonald</strong></em></p><p><strong>Rory McIlroy: </strong>If Europe is going to pull off the upset at Bethpage, Rory is going to have to lead the charge. He went 4-1-0 in Rome and I'd be shocked if he isn't out for all five sessions again this week. McIlroy was the one who boasted they were going to win on the road after their victory in Italy, and he's not only Europe's best player, he's also the heartbeat of the team. He needs to put up 3.5 or 4 points again this week if Europe is going to silence the masses at Bethpage. <em>Odds as top European: 4-1 | top point scorer: 9-1<strong> -- Kalland</strong></em></p><p><strong>Jon Rahm: </strong>Despite playing extraordinarily well across the majors and during his LIV Golf season, Rahm did not pick up a solo win in 2025. That's crazy. As great of a year as it's been for McIlroy, he's put himself on the line in a significant manner here talking about how Europe would win the Ryder Cup on United States soil for most of the last two years -- starting immediately in the post-event press conference after the 2023 Ryder Cup. We know what normally happens when the pressure is the greatest on McIlroy, and while he'll surely play well all week, Rahm is the big hitter with a chance to actually turn the tide toward the Europeans. Plus, his odds are better. <em>Odds as top European: 9/2 | top point scorer: 10-1 <strong>-- Silverstein</strong></em></p>\n<h3>Breakout candidate</h3><p><strong>Cameron Young (United States):</strong> Familiar with the golf course, playing as well as anyone and having garnered experience in big moments, Young could be the player to put the U.S. over the top. The former PGA Tour Rookie of the Year is as long as anyone off the tee, and his improvement on the greens (second best on the U.S. team behind only Burns) makes him a really difficult out in these playing formats. If the iron play is sharp, Young will have himself a week. <em>Odds as top American: 12-1 | top point scorer: 22-1<strong> -- McDonald</strong></em></p><p><strong>Ben Griffin (United States): </strong>Based on the early practice round schedule, it looks like Griffin might be the guy that draws the DeChambeau pairing this week. If that's the case, I love his chances to become a star on this U.S. team. We spent all season waiting for Griffin to come back to Earth, but he's continued to play at an incredibly high level as the lights have gotten brighter. If he's alongside DeChambeau, I could see him pulling down 2.5 or 3 points this week and becoming a beloved figure at Bethpage. <em>Odds as top American: 20-1 | top point scorer: 27-1<strong> -- Kalland</strong></em></p><p><strong>Ben Griffin (United States): </strong>Concur with the above take on Griffin. Though he's not playing in the first session, he continues to shine in key situations and ended 2025 as one of the hottest golfers on the PGA Tour. Could see Griffin paired with DeChambeau in four-ball, but the big-hitting right hander will instead be paired with Thomas for foursomes. <em>Odds as top American: 20-1 | top point scorer: 27-1<strong> -- Silverstein</strong></em></p>\n<h3>Surprise prediction</h3><p><strong>Fans will be treated to a memorable Sunday singles: </strong>It's been more than 10 years since the Ryder Cup has been tight on Sunday -- the last five have each been won by 5+ points -- but that changes this year with the teams incredibly even on paper. Fans will see version 3.0 of Bryson vs. Rory and Rahm vs. Scheffler as more than just 5 minutes of <em>well, if this happens and that happens then maybe the U.S. has a chance to win</em> self-generated excitement. This bad boy will come down to the wire with those in the back half of the lineups having a major say in the final outcome. <em><strong>-- McDonald</strong></em></p><p><strong>J.J. Spaun or Russell Henley score the winning point for the United States (odds: 6-1 each): </strong>This is almost assuredly going to be decided late Sunday, and given the way Bradley has talked about Spaun and Henley, both will be put out in the back end of Sunday singles. You'd expect guys like Scheffler and DeChambeau to be sent out early to try and get points on the board, but you need some trusted dogs in the back end to get it done. Bradley has gushed about the competitive spirit of both guys leading up to the Ryder Cup, and they could be among those final four pairings to go out Sunday with the Ryder Cup in the balance.<strong><em> -- Kalland</em></strong></p><p><strong>It's not as close as the experts think: </strong>Nearly every year -- except 2021 -- everyone expects the Ryder Cup to be a tightly contested affair. While the setup for 2025 suggests that will be the case, what's interesting at the onset of the pairings is that Donald is going away from some successful duos in Rome, trying new combinations in New York. That might work, but it could also backfire. Bradley appears to have the Americans juiced up to bring the trophy home, and while I certainly do not believe a 10-point shellacking is in order like four years ago, Sunday should be more comfortable than most imagine. <strong><em>-- Silverstein</em></strong></p>\n<p><em><a href=\"https://martech.cbssports.com/bt/redirect/prod?b=fanduel&c=sport\" target=\"_blank\">Bet this week's Ryder Cup surprise predictions at FanDuel Sportsbook</a>, where new users get $300 in bonus bets with a winning $5 wager. <a href=\"https://martech.cbssports.com/bt/redirect/prod?b=fanduel&c=sport\" target=\"_blank\">Click here</a>:</em></p><h3>Winning side</h3><p><strong>United States (15-13):</strong> Everything screams Europe -- form, experience, continuity, leadership, pedigree, meaning and whatever else you want to pile on -- but something inside says the U.S. will get the job done by the thinnest of margins. (Extremely scientific, I know.) Europe is the known quantity in this equation, and while the U.S. has many unknowns, that does not necessarily mean they are all negative. There will be some surprise performances -- good and bad -- and enough good from a blend of rookies and stalwarts such as Thomas and Schauffele to put the red, white and blue over the top. <em>Odds to win: -165 | exact score odds: 10-1<strong> -- McDonald</strong></em></p><p><strong>United States (15-13): </strong>Europe will push the Americans more than we've seen from a road team since Medinah in 2012, but this U.S. squad has the goods to get the job done. If nothing else, it has Scheffler and the Bethpage crowd behind it. Bradley has done an incredible job bringing this team together in a way we don't always see from the U.S. side, and that will pay dividends Sunday. Itwill be curious to see how the U.S. handles foursomes -- Europe could have the advantage in those sessions -- but Sunday in singles, the U.S. has enough dogs to get over the finish line and hoist the Ryder Cup at home. <em>Odds to win: -165 | exact score odds: 10-1 <strong>-- Kalland</strong></em></p>\n<p><strong>United States (16-12): </strong>There will be concerns Friday night going into the second day of competition, and then the Americans will pull away in Saturday foursomes and ultimately put the Ryder Cup on ice across the first few pairings during Sunday singles. Scheffler, DeChambeau and Thomas -- along with Griffin and Young -- will lead the way and pile up points early. Don't be surprised to see Bradley give up a couple matches -- like he appears to be doing in Friday foursomes with his third pairing -- in order to field stronger duos that take down the Europeans. <em>Odds to win: -165 | exact score odds: 10-1 <strong>-- Silverstein</strong></em></p><p><em>Who will win the 2025 Ryder Cup, and which plus-money golf picks should you target for Team USA vs. Team Europe? </em><a href=\"https://www.sportsline.com/insiders/2025-ryder-cup-odds-picks-proven-golf-model-reveals-best-bets-surprising-predictions-for-bethpage-black/#ttag=09232025_lk_cbssports_picks_golf_pgatour_model_RyderCup\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Visit SportsLine to see the projected leaderboard, all from the model that's nailed 16 golf majors, including three in 2025</em></a><em>.</em></p>\n            </div>"

Both teams have 86-73 records with three games to play, but because Cleveland won the season series -- and therefore holds the tiebreaker -- the Guardians are technically the ones in first place.  </p><p>Detroit wasted no time jumping on rookie lefty <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/players/29075750/parker-messick/\">Parker Messick</a>. Leadoff man <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/players/2211211/jahmai-jones/\">Jahmai Jones</a> went deep on Messick's sixth pitch of the game, then No. 3 hitter <span>Wenceel Pérez</span> hit a solo homer two batters later. <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/players/3117537/riley-greene/\">Riley Greene</a> went deep later in the game as well. The Tigers hit three homers off Messick, who surrendered just one longball in his first six <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://cbssports.com/mlb/\">MLB</a> starts.  </p><p>The Tigers received a combined five innings of one-run ball from righty <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/players/29075780/troy-melton/\">Troy Melton</a> and lefty <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/players/29075483/brant-hurter/\">Brant Hurter</a> in a bullpen game.

The Guardians, meanwhile, have won 17 of their last 20 games. Detroit's AL Central lead was 10 games as recently as Sept. 3. Now it's zero with three games to play, though that's better than being one game back like the Tigers were after Wednesday's loss.  </p>\n<p>Back on July 8, the Tigers led the AL Central by 14 games and the Guardians were 15 ½ games back in fourth place. The largest comeback in the divisional era is 14 games by the 1978 <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/teams/NYY/new-york-yankees/\">New York Yankees</a> and the largest blown lead ever is 13 games by the 1951 <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/teams/LAD/los-angeles-dodgers/\">Brooklyn Dodgers</a>. (The <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/teams/BOS/boston-red-sox/\">Boston Red Sox</a> were never more than 10 games up on second place in 1978. The Yankees were in fourth place when they were 14 games back.)</p><p>The Guardians will now welcome the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/teams/TEX/texas-rangers/\">Texas Rangers</a> to Cleveland for the regular-season-ending weekend series. Texas has already been eliminated from postseason contention and is playing out the string. The Tigers go to Boston next to play a Red Sox team that is in wild card position but has not yet clinched a postseason berth.  </p><p>Any combination of Guardians' wins and <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/teams/HOU/houston-astros/\">Houston Astros</a>' losses totaling two the rest of the way will punch Cleveland's ticket to the postseason. They only need to tie the Tigers to win the AL Central. The Tigers must win one more game than the Guardians this weekend to win the division.  </p>\n<p>Tigers ace and reigning AL Cy Young winner <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/players/3126008/tarik-skubal/\">Tarik Skubal</a> is scheduled to start Sunday.

Day 1 on Friday will consist of four alternate shot (foursome) matches in the morning and then four better ball (fourball) matches in the afternoon. As the hosts, the United States was allowed to select when the sessions of the first two days of the event are played, so team captain Keegan Bradley clearly feels confident that this cadence will put the Americans in the best chance to grab an early lead, and past results certainly indicate that.</p><p>The U.S. has utilized this strategy in five straight Ryder Cup events, posting a 12-4 overall record over those sessions. The U.S. went 6-2 in foursome matches when it last hosted in 2021, while the Europeans also know this strategy often works in favor of the host, as they went 7-1 across the foursome matches when they hosted in 2023.</p><p><em>For the 2025 Ryder Cup, you can use the latest <span><a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/betting/news/fanduel-promo-code/\" target=\"_blank\">FanDuel promo code</a></span> at </em><a href=\"https://martech.cbssports.com/bt/redirect/prod?b=fanduel&c=sport\" target=\"_blank\"><em>FanDuel to get $300 in bonus bets instantly.</em></a><em> </em></p><p>One can also look at the composition of the respective teams to see why McClure favors the U.S. to start off with a lead. Five of the top six ranked players in the world are suiting up in the Red, White and Blue, with McIlroy the lone exception. The entire-12 man U.S. team ranks in the top 25, while three Europeans are outside the top 25, including Rahm at No. 73. Additionally, Bethpage Black hasn't been too kind to many of the Europeans who played it before when the course hosted the 2019 PGA Championship. Five of the seven Team Europe members who competed finished outside the top 25, while U.S. member, Patrick Cantlay (t3) nearly won the major and fellow member, Xander Schauffele, had a solid 16th-place finish. <a href=\"https://www.sportsline.com/insiders/2025-ryder-cup-odds-picks-proven-golf-model-reveals-best-bets-surprising-predictions-for-bethpage-black/#ttag=09232025_agg_cbssports_picks_golf_pgatour_model_RyderCup\" target=\"_blank\">See who else to pick here</a>.</p><h2>How to make 2025 Ryder Cup picks</h2><p>McClure is also targeting three other Ryder Cup best bets, including two more plus-money golf picks and the overall winner.

That whole entire tree from Sean [McVay] to Kevin O'Connell to all of those guys, they all do it,\" Saleh said. \"There's challenges. They're going to catch us in some situations where they have the advantage and we've just got to play sound, fundamental football and do our best to out-execute them.\"</p>\n<p>Saleh emphasized that there is nothing illegal about this practice, and it's not an uncommon thing. It just happens that this specific group of offensive minds is particularly good at it. </p><p>Saleh said the signals could be swiped from people on the sideline or it could just be a player's individual hand signals. Whatever these teams are taking away, it's a system that gets them into a \"very advantageous position multiple times during the course of a game.\" </p><p>\"It's the ultimate trick,\" Saleh said. </p><p>Coen, who is in his first year as a head coach, has the Jaguars off to a 2-1 start.

Kansas City Current (--)</h2><p>The Kansas City Current have been the best team the entire 2025 NWSL regular season, and they confirmed all the clout when they etched their names into the 2025 NWSL Shield. The fastest team to ever secure the shield, and they've got five weeks in front of them to retool if they need to or want to. </p>\n<h2>2. Washington Spirit (--)</h2><p>The Spirit will be motivated to clinch their playoff spot at home after being runners-up in the shield race. The regular season might be winding down, but forward Trinity Rodman and midfielder Croix Bethune are heating up at the right time, and the Spirit stay a force to be reckoned with.</p><h2>3. Gotham FC (+2)</h2><p>As Rose Lavelle rises, so does Gotham FC. Sometimes figuring out how not to lose a game is just as important as securing a win during the postseason race, and the coaching staff is also competing to flex how deep the roster is.</p><h2>4. Portland Thorns FC (-1)</h2><p>There's no streakier team than the Thorns among the top four of my rankings and the league table. One stretch of the match, they look like they have the answers, and the next, they're not executing. The only thing keeping them this high is the fact that so many other teams are facing similar questions.</p>\n<h2>5. Seattle Reign FC (-1)</h2><p>Literally, somebody not named Jess Fishlock, please score for the Seattle Reign. One goal in four games isn't just a trend; it's become consistent stagnation at this point, and it's not the kind of form you want when staying in the playoff mix.</p><h2>6. Orlando Pride (--)</h2><p>The former NWSL Shield winners are stumbling in the playoff race, and in my power rankings. There's enough there at the end of game stats to show the Pride are clinging to the postseason race, but they might have to shake up the lineups to get things going again.</p><h2>7. San Diego Wave (--)</h2><p>There's just not the same creative spark from San Diego that we saw during the first half of the season. If forward Delphine Cascarino remains on the injury report, there might not be enough to keep them climbing the power rankings. </p>\n<h2>8. Utah Royals (+3)</h2><p>There's the Utah Royals we all thought would come to life in 2025. In almost a mirror image of last season, Utah is stringing together performances and playing better than its league table ranking. But just like last year, they're running out of time to make some club history.</p><h2>9. Houston Dash (+1)</h2><p>Dash showed they won't stay down for long. Despite their unbeaten streak being snapped, they bounced right back into form. Yazmeen Ryan is back to scoring goals, and they're still part of a postseason convo that was previously slipping away from them.</p><h2>10. North Carolina Courage (+2)</h2><p>The Courage are bringing plenty of nothing-to-lose energy into their matches, and it's paying off in results and the playoff picture. Defenders Maycee Bell and Kaleigh Kurtz are making things difficult for the attacking opposition, and the play is building up on the pitch.</p>\n<h2>11. Racing Louisville FC (-3)</h2><p>You hate to see it. Racing are struggling to differentiate itself not only from other teams in the playoff push, but from their repeatedly underachieving seasons of the past. They're showing signs of life but could use a definitive, complete performance asap.</p><h2>12. Chicago Stars FC (-3)</h2><p>It was an incredible run until reality started to settle in. The group is on a new streak of no wins that don't feel as great as their previous run out of the summer break. They're in the corner with the regular season timeline closing in on them.</p><h2>13. Angel City FC (+1)</h2><p>Nothing like going toe-to-toe with top teams to get some confidence back. But it's a little bit telling that some of the vibes are lost despite the efforts. </p>\n<h2>14. Bay FC (-1)</h2><p>There's nothing wrong with trying some stuff when it looks and feels like the season has all but slipped away from you. Defender Brooklyn Courtnal got her first start since being traded to Bay, and forward Racheal Kundenanji, off the bench, scored an equalizer.</p>\n            </div>"

He helped pave the way for running back Ron Dayne on his way to the Heisman Trophy and was a stalwart in the trenches for Badgers teams that won two Big Ten titles and the 1999 and 2000 Rose Bowls.
