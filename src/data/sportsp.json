    "body": "<div>\n        <p>As fall officially begins and the early-season hype of college football gives way to the grind of conference play, two of the Big 12's most prominent programs meet in one of the weekend's most anticipated matchups. Ever since coach Deion Sanders took over, Colorado has commanded attention — and that remains true this year despite a 2-2 start. Now the Buffaloes welcome perhaps their biggest stumbling block yet into Boulder.</p><p>Last season, Colorado's year ended with a 36-14 blowout loss to BYU in the Alamo Bowl, and the Cougars have carried that momentum into a 3-0 start marked by dominant wins over Stanford and East Carolina. Now, as BYU begins Big 12 play, it faces the task of proving it has the right stuff against one of the league's most visible opponents.</p><h2>Where to watch BYU vs. Colorado live</h2><p><strong>Date:</strong> Sat., Sept. 27 | <strong>Time:</strong> 10:15 p.m. ET<br /><strong>Where:</strong> Folsom Field -- Boulder, Colo.<br /><strong>TV:</strong> ESPN | <strong>Stream: </strong><a href=\"https://www.fubo.tv/welcome/leagues/191277?irad=356362&irmp=416484&sharedid=HTW\" target=\"_blank\">Fubo</a> (Try for free)</p><h2>BYU vs. Colorado: Need to know</h2><p><strong>What is Colorado, really? </strong>The trumpets around Colorado haven't sounded quite as loudly in 2025, as the Buffaloes' two biggest stars under Deion Sanders — Heisman Trophy winner Travis Hunter and quarterback Shedeur Sanders — have both moved on to the NFL. Without the spotlight on those two, Colorado has been a more balanced but inconsistent team. That shows in their 2-2 record, with solid wins over Delaware and Wyoming offset by a close loss to Georgia Tech and a turnover-riddled defeat against Houston. Saturday's matchup with BYU could go a long way in shaping the Buffaloes' identity, especially if they can respond to last year's blowout loss in the Alamo Bowl.</p>\n<p><strong>Good matchup for BYU's defense: </strong>A key reason for BYU's 36-14 Alamo Bowl rout last season was its ability to exploit Colorado's shaky offensive line and let the defense take control. That weakness remains for the Buffaloes, which plays into the strength of a Cougars team thriving on complementary football. BYU's defense has been particularly dominant, led by a swarming defensive line, while the offense has supported it with a strong ground game and steady play from quarterback Bear Bachmeier. The result: just 16 points allowed through three games.</p><h2>BYU vs. Colorado prediction, pick</h2><p>BYU enters as a 6.5-point favorite, a line that reflects just how lopsided the last meeting was between these programs. Compared to last December, Colorado's bluster doesn't carry quite the same bite, as the departure of Heisman Trophy winner Travis Hunter has shifted the spotlight to the depth and balance of the roster Deion Sanders has assembled. Coach Prime should have no trouble motivating his players for this matchup, but the fundamentals and consistency BYU brings to the field may be enough to carry the Cougars once again. <strong><em>Pick: BYU -6.5</em></strong></p>\n<p><em>SportsLine's proven computer model has simulated every Week 5 college football game 10,000 times. <a href=\"https://www.sportsline.com/insiders/college-football-odds-lines-spreads-picks-predictions-betting-advice-for-week-5-2025-from-proven-model/#ttag=09222025_lk_cbssports_picks_football_ncaa_model_CFBWeek5\" target=\"_blank\">Visit SportsLine now to see all the picks</a>, all from the model that is 34-22 since the beginning of last season on top-rated money-line and over/under picks. </em></p>\n            </div>"

The Mets were outscored despite winning the series, with Chicago averaging 7.3 runs per game with all three contests going Over their totals. The Mets and Cubs averaged 14 total runs per game, and the model expects that trend to continue on Friday with New York both scoring and allowing runs. Francisco Lindor has three home runs over the last six games, with Juan Soto and Francisco Alvarez both adding two homers during that span as well. Brandon Sproat is making just his fourth career start for the Mets, who are fighting to hold onto the final Wild Card spot in the National League playoffs, and the 25-year-old makes the high-pressure start after allowing four runs over four innings against the Nationals on Friday. The Marlins are starting Sandy Alcantara, who has a 5.48 ERA as one of the most inconsistent pitchers in baseball. The model projects the Over to hit in 54% of simulations.</p><h2>Florida State vs. Virginia Under 60.5 total points (-110)</h2><p>Florida State has the No. 3 scoring offense (48.5 points per game), while Virginia ranks 13th (42.3 ppg) in scoring this season. However, most of their offensive success has come against inferior opponents. The Seminoles play their ACC opener on Friday, while Virginia plays just its second conference contest. The Seminoles opened the season with a massive upset with a 31-17 victory over Alabama, finishing below this total.

    "body": "<div>\n        <p>Last week was an unfortunate one for a number of NFL survivor pool players who sided with the Packers in their road game against the Browns, and the Falcons against the Panthers. Cleveland scored 13 points in the final four minutes to stun heavily favored Green Bay 13-10, while Carolina buried visiting Atlanta 30-0. Those players who survived because they avoided the road favorite saw their strategy pay off. With that in mind, some of the best Week 4 odds may still be available to them. Among them include the Bills (-15.5) over the Saints, the Lions (-10) over the Browns, the Texans (-7.5) over the Titans and the Chargers (-6.5) over the Giants as Jaxson Dart will make his first pro start.</p><p>With the survivor pool shrinking, it's a must that players put together a winning NFL survivor pool strategy.

    "body": "<div>\n<p>One of the headlines of Serie A Matchday 5 happens on Saturday in Turin where Juventus will face <span>Atalanta</span> on Saturday. The Bianconeri have had an extremely positive start of the season, with Igor Tudor's side winning the opening three matches of the season before last weekend's draw against <span>Hellas Verona</span> away. They currently sit second in the standings two points behind <span>Napoli</span>. </p><p>Atalanta, on the other hand, are dealing with the massive changes this summer brought when long-serving manager Gian Piero Gasperini left the Italian team and joined AS <span>Roma</span>. During his near decade in charge he was able to bring the club to the highest levels of European soccer, including winning the 2023-24 Europa League, defeating Bayer Leverkusen in the final 3-0. Under Ivan Juric, who joined the team this summer after the disappointing spells at AS Roma and Southampton, the Nerazzurri drew the opening two games of the Serie A season but then won the last two ones against <span>Lecce</span> and <span>Torino</span>. </p><h2>Juventus enter crucial match looking for calm</h2><p>Before last weekend's 1-1 draw with Juventus played back-to-back wild affairs, a 4-4 Champions League draw with Borussia Dortmund where the Italian team scored twice in injury time to rescue a home draw in a match that looked lost at 90 minutes. And that crazy draw followed hot on the heels of the team's iconic 4-3 win over <span>Inter</span>, giving them early bragging rights against one of their biggest rivals in Serie A. According to midfielder Khephren Thuram (whose brother Marcus was on the losing Inter side), the sides fast start is down to a host of factors, but one in particular he highlighted was the opportunity to play in last summer's Club World Cup. </p><p>\"The World Cup was very important for us to all be together, to learn how to work together as a group,\" Thuram told CBS Sports Golazo Network. The midfielder further credited manager Igor Tudor for the team's early success this season. \"Because he's really close to us, he can ask a lot of us, and we're gonna do it.\"</p><p>The matchup against Atalanta also brings a clash of Americans with Thuram's fellow midfielder, the man he described as a \"great guy and a great teammate\" Weston McKennie facing off against Yunus Musah. McKennie has once again forced himself into a Juventus managers plans, after Tudor's predecessors Thiago Motta and Maximilian Allegri both tried to move on from him only to see him play his way back into favor. The same is true now, with Mckennie starting at wingback in both of Juventus' wild four-goal-scoring affairs</p>\n<h2>Musah looks for stability at Atalanta</h2><p>Unlike McKennie, fellow American Yunus Musah has had to look for new pastures to try and fight for playing time. During the summer of 2025, Musah joined Atalanta on loan from <span>AC Milan</span>. The American midfielder joined the CBS Sports podcast Call It What You Want to talk ahead of Saturday's match and spoke about his feelings on the summer move. Musah is a midfielder by trade, though he had spent his sparse minutes at Milan being deployed all over the pitch. At 22-years-old he's looking to settle into his preferred position.  \"For me to really develop in the middle, I'm at a time in my career where it's important for me to focus on that position and develop as much as I can in that area.\" </p><p>Then there's the small matter of playing on the world's biggest stage. Milan's disappointing eighth place finish left them outside the European competitions looking in, unlike his new home. \"Atalanta, they're in the Champions League, and having played in the Champions League in past seasons, I wanted to carry that on. That was something huge that really caught my attention. I'm trying to develop as an all-round midfielder and be the most complete midfielder I can be. You need to play in different formations, etc. But if you're a complete midfielder, you'll be able to adapt to any formation. That's my goal, to really develop in that aspect and to really learn from my coach here and the national team.\"</p><p>Musah has certainly gotten his wish, though at times it has been a trial by fire. In Atalanta's first Champions League match of the season, Musah was in the starting lineup, unfortunately for him and his teammates, the team on the other side of the ball was a rampant, title-defending Paris Saint-Germain squad that opened the scoring in the third minute and never looked back on their way to a 4-0 win.</p><p>It was a learning experience, and Musah knows he also has to improve ahead of a key season that will lead to the 2026 World Cup in the United States. \"In the final third, be more brave to make that decisive pass. Also be more clinical to get more goals. I'm really working in that area. I can really drive with the ball and penetrate teams in that manner, but I need to work on controlling the game a little bit. I'm sure the managers are watching [Atalanta's games] and seeing how we're doing. Hopefully they're watching and seeing our progress.\"</p><p>It's a crucial season for the midfielder, who was a mainstay for the United Stats men's national team for years, but skipped the Gold Cup last summer and hasn't been called into several of manager Mauricio Pochettino's recent national team camps. Musah, however remains undeterred. \"Plans for June 2026? My plan is to start in the game, listen to the anthem, and that's it.\" What better way to make an impression than to get on the field against Juventus against the likes of Thuram and possibly McKennie, and make his mark.</p>\n<h2>How to watch Juventus vs. Atalanta, odds</h2><ul><li><strong>Date</strong>: Saturday, Sept. 27 | <strong>Time</strong>: 12 p.m. ET</li><li><strong>Location</strong>: Allianz Stadium -- Turin</li><li><strong>TV:</strong> CBS</li><li><strong>Live stream: </strong><a href=\"https://www.paramountplus.com/?cbscidmt=sports&ftag=PPM-22-10agi2j\" target=\"_blank\">Paramount+</a></li><li><strong>Odds: </strong>Juventus -116; Draw +248; Atalanta +320</li></ul>\n            </div>"

I like Fields as a top-10 Fantasy quarterback in all leagues. </p><p> Fields was injured in Week 2 against Buffalo, and he missed Week 3 at Tampa Bay. He practiced in full Thursday and Friday, and his status will be made official Saturday. Just make sure he's starting before setting your lineup Sunday, but there's plenty of upside for Monday's game. </p><p> The Dolphins are No. 2 in most Fantasy points allowed to opposing quarterbacks, and <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/2179245/daniel-jones/fantasy/\">Daniel Jones</a> in Week 1, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/26695757/drake-maye/fantasy/\">Drake Maye</a> in Week 2, and <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/2181054/josh-allen/fantasy/\">Josh Allen</a> in Week 3 all scored at least 29 Fantasy points against Miami. Each quarterback ran for at least 25 yards as well, and Jones (two) and Maye combined for three rushing touchdowns against this defense. </p><p> It's a great setup for Fields, who scored 31.5 Fantasy points in his only full game this season in Week 1 against Pittsburgh.

missed Week 3 against Las Vegas. With Daniels out against the Raiders, Mariota stepped up with 207 passing yards and a touchdown, and 40 rushing yards and a touchdown. He's now scored at least 22 Fantasy points in three appearances with the Commanders over the past two years, and he would be a No. 1 quarterback in all leagues if he starts against the Falcons. This would be the second revenge game in a row for Mariota, who spent 2022 in Atlanta, and hopefully, he stays hot with another chance to start for the Commanders this week.\n            </p>\n

after missing the past two games with toe and shoulder injuries. I like him as a low-end starter in all leagues, and he scored 20.8 Fantasy points in Week 1 at Seattle. The Jaguars have only allowed one quarterback to score more than 12.4 Fantasy points this season, but Purdy should do fine against this defense. Purdy also has averaged 21.7 Fantasy points per game at home in his career, and he passed for 296 yards and three touchdowns against the Jaguars in 2023.\n            </p>\n

a late interception in the fourth quarter. He scored 22.6 Fantasy points in his last home game against New England in Week 2, and he is averaging 26.1 Fantasy points in his past five home games, going back to last season. One of those outings was against the Jets in Week 14 when he scored 27.5 Fantasy points, and I like Tagovailoa as a low-end starter in this matchup on Monday night.\n            </p>\n

played well until a late interception in the fourth quarter. He scored 22.6 Fantasy points in his last home game against New England in Week 2, and he is averaging 26.1 Fantasy points in his past five home games, going back to last season. One of those outings was against the Jets in Week 14 when he scored 27.5 Fantasy points, and I like Tagovailoa as a low-end starter in this matchup on Monday night.\n            </p>\n

New England has allowed two quarterbacks this season to score at least 19.5 Fantasy points with Geno Smith and Tua Tagovailoa, and Young has the potential to be in that range as well in Week 4.\n            </p>\n            </div>\n</div>\n</td></tr></tbody></table></div></div><div><div><p>Sleeper RBs</p></div><div><table><tbody><tr><td><div>\n    <div>\n                    <div>\n    <figure><img alt=\"team logo\" src=\"https://sports.cbsimg.net/fly/images/team-logos/422.svg\" /></figure>\n                                        </div>\n        <div>\n            <p><span>     \n                        NYG\n                    </span>\n                    <span>     \n                        N.Y.

yards and a touchdown and six catches for 61 yards on eight targets. Tyrone Tracy Jr. (shoulder) is out in Week 4 against the Chargers, and Skatteo should have the chance for 15-plus touches for the second game in a row. We'll see how the offense looks with Jaxson Dart making his first NFL start, and hopefully, he continues to rely on Skattebo in the passing game. I like Skattebo as a low-end No. 2 Fantasy running back in all leagues.\n            </p>\n            </div>\n</div>\n</td></tr><tr><td><div>\n    <div>\n                    <div>\n    <figure><img

(two) and Antonio Gibson combined for three fumbles in Week 3 against Pittsburgh, which has to help Henderson get more playing time. He finished the Steelers game with 11 carries for 28 yards and three catches for 19 yards on three targets, and the 14 total touches are a season high. I'll take a chance on Henderson as a high-end flex in Week 4 against the Panthers, who have already allowed three running backs to score at least 12.2 PPR points this season. And Trey Benson and Bijan Robinson combined for nine catches for 69 yards on 12 targets against Carolina in the past two weeks, which should bode well for Henderson's role in the passing game.\n

catches on one target in Week 3 against Houston, but look for his role to expand in Week 4 at San Francisco. He's now scored at least 8.1 PPR points in each of his past two games against the Bengals and Texans, and I would consider him as a flex option in Week 4. Travis Etienne remains a No. 2 Fantasy running back in all leagues, and we'll see how the 49ers defense looks in the first game without Nick Bosa (ACL).\n            </p>\n

and a touchdown. He should continue to work in tandem with De'Von Achane, and I would use Gordon as a flex option in Week 4 against the Jets. He'll likely need a touchdown to help his Fantasy production since he only has two catches for 4 yards on two targets this year, but the Dolphins will likely lean on Gordon in short-yardage situations and near the goal line. If the Dolphins are playing with a lead in this game, then Gordon could be a nice surprise for Fantasy managers, especially if he finds the end zone.\n            </p>\n

in Week 3 at Jacksonville compared to 33 for Nick Chubb. Marks also had a season-high seven total touches against the Jaguars, and he has 46 receiving yards in his past two outings, with only two catches on three targets. I'll still use Chubb ahead of Marks in Week 4 against the Titans, who are No. 3 in most Fantasy points allowed to opposing running backs, but Marks is a good desperation play if you need a flex option in this matchup.\n            </p>\n            </div>\n</div>\n</td></tr><tr><td><div>\n    <div>\n                    <div>\n    <figure><img alt=\"team logo\"

abused by the Lions in Week 3 as Jahmyr Gibbs and David Montgomery combined for 34 carries for 218 yards and four touchdowns. The Chiefs won't do that, but maybe this is a good week for Hunt or Isiah Pacheco to get going. I'd lean toward Hunt over Pacheco based on Hunt's touchdown potential, and he just had 10 carries for 34 yards and a touchdown and one catch for 10 yards in Week 3 at the Giants. Hunt should be considered a flex option in deeper leagues in Week 4.\n            </p>\n            </div>\n</div>\n</td></tr></tbody></table></div></div><div><div><p>Sleeper WRs</p></div><div><table><tbody><tr><td><div>\n    <div>\n                    <div>\n    <figure><img alt=\"team logo\" src=\"https://sports.cbsimg.net/fly/images/team-logos/417.svg\" /></figure>\n                                        </div>\n        <div>\n            <p><span>     \n                        KC\n                    </span>\n                    <span>     \n                        Kansas City\n                    </span>\n                                            • #1\n                                            <br />\n                                            Age: 22\n                                                                        • Experience: 2 yrs.\n                                                </p>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n    <div>\n        <div>\n                <table>\n                                            <tr>\n                            <td>\n                                <h5>\n                                    YTD Stats\n                                </h5>\n                            </td>\n                        </tr>\n                                            <tr>\n                                                            <td>\n                                    <h6>\n                                        REC\n                                    </h6>\n                                    0\n                                </td>\n                                                            <td>\n                                    <h6>\n                                        TAR\n                                    </h6>\n                                    1\n                                </td>\n                                                            <td>\n                                    <h6>\n                                        REYDS\n                                    </h6>\n                                    0\n                                </td>\n                                                            <td>\n                                    <h6>\n                                        TD\n                                    </h6>\n                                    0\n                                </td>\n                                                            <td>\n                                    <h6>\n                                        FPTS/G\n                                    </h6>\n                                    0\n                                </td>\n                                                    </tr>\n                                    </table>\n                    </div>\n                    <p>\n                Worthy (shoulder) is expected to play Sunday against Baltimore after missing the past two games with a shoulder injury. Hopefully, he won't be on a snap count, and he could be a star if he plays the whole game without restrictions against the Ravens. Baltimore has allowed at least one touchdown to a wide receiver in all three games this season, and four receivers have scored at least 12.4 PPR points against the Ravens. I like Worthy as a high-end No. 3 Fantasy receiver with upside.\n            </p>\n            </div>\n</div>\n</td></tr><tr><td><div>\n    <div>\n                    <div>\n    <figure><img

had eight catches for 145 yards and three touchdowns in Week 3 at Washington on nine targets. But I also love that he got eight targets in Week 2 against the Chargers. He only finished with three catches for 12 yards in that game, but it's clear the Raiders want to make Tucker a featured part of their offense. This week, Tucker should be considered a No. 3 Fantasy receiver in the majority of leagues. The Bears are No. 3 in most Fantasy points allowed to opposing receivers, and I expect Geno Smith to play well in this matchup, which is why he's my Start of the Week. Tucker, Jakobi Meyers, and Brock Bowers all have the chance to be standout Fantasy options in this matchup.\n            </p>\n            </div>\n</div>\n</td></tr><tr><td><div>\n    <div>\n

struggling right now for the Jaguars, and Washington has become someone Liam Coen and Trevor Lawrence can trust. Washington has 16 targets in his past two games, and he combined for nine catches and 110 yards over that span. He should continue to get targets in Week 4 at San Francisco, and Washington should be considered a low-end No. 3 Fantasy receiver in deeper leagues. It's not an easy matchup, but Washington might prove to be the most reliable option in the passing game if the Jaguars are trailing on the road.\n            </p>\n

his first three games of the season. But in PPR, Olave has been solid, including a season-best 15.7 points in Week 3 at Seattle. He's been a volume king with 37 targets on the year, and he has 23 receptions. But he's failed to score a touchdown in any game, and he's been at 57 receiving yards or less in each outing.  I would expect more of the same in Week 4 at Buffalo, and he should be considered a borderline starter in all PPR leagues. In half-PPR, Olave is a flex, and he should not be trusted in non-PPR formats for now. It helps that Buffalo has allowed three receivers to score at least 14.9 PPR points this year.\n            </p>\n            </div>\n</div>\n</td></tr><tr><td><div>\n    <div>\n                    <div>\n    <figure><img alt=\"team logo\" src=\"https://sports.cbsimg.net/fly/images/team-logos/418.svg\" /></figure>\n                                        </div>\n        <div>\n            <p><span>     \n                        MIA\n                    </span>\n                    <span>     \n                        Miami\n                    </span>\n                                            • #17\n                                            <br />\n                                            Age: 26\n                                                                        • Experience: 5 yrs.\n                                                </p>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n    <div>\n        <div>\n                <table>\n                                            <tr>\n                            <td>\n                                <h5>\n                                    YTD Stats\n                                </h5>\n                            </td>\n                        </tr>\n                                            <tr>\n                                                            <td>\n                                    <h6>\n                                        REC\n                                    </h6>\n                                    14\n                                </td>\n                                                            <td>\n                                    <h6>\n                                        TAR\n                                    </h6>\n                                    17\n                                </td>\n                                                            <td>\n                                    <h6>\n                                        REYDS\n                                    </h6>\n                                    137\n                                </td>\n                                                            <td>\n                                    <h6>\n                                        TD\n                                    </h6>\n                                    2\n                                </td>\n                                                            <td>\n                                    <h6>\n                                        FPTS/G\n                                    </h6>\n                                    13.2\n                                </td>\n                                                    </tr>\n                                    </table>\n                    </div>\n                    <p>\n                Waddle has found the end zone in back-to-back games heading into Week 4, and he scored at least 14.9 PPR points in each outing. He's yet to top six targets in any game, and 68 receiving yards in his season high. But I would trust him as a No. 3 Fantasy receiver in all leagues in this matchup with the Jets. Three receivers scored at least 12 PPR points against the Jets in Week 3 from Tampa Bay, and five guys have reached that total this season. Waddle has scored at least 18.9 PPR points in three of his past four meetings with the Jets, and hopefully, Tua Tagovailoa starts to lean on Waddle more in this game.\n            </p>\n

 <p>\n                Golden, Dontayvion Wicks, and Romeo Doubs are all in play as sleepers in Week 4 against the Cowboys, who are No. 1 in most Fantasy points allowed to opposing receivers. Five receivers in the past two games against Dallas have scored at least 12.8 PPR points, including a whopping six touchdowns. Golden just had his best game of the season in Week 3 at Cleveland with four catches for 52 yards on four targets, and hopefully it's the start of a strong rookie campaign. He's worth using as a No. 3 Fantasy receiver in all leagues in Week 4 due to the matchup. Wicks has 10 targets in the past two games, with Jayden Reed (collarbone) hurt, but Wicks only has six catches for 65 yards and no touchdowns. Still, he's worth a look as a No. 3 receiver in deeper leagues given the matchup. Doubs is also worth using in deeper leagues, but he's combined for just seven catches for 121 yards and a touchdown on the season. All three could go off against the Cowboys, so keep that in mind for Golden, Wicks, and Doubs, in that order, in Week 4.\n            </p>\n            </div>\n</div>\n</td></tr><tr><td><div>\n

              <p>\n                Ayomanor should be added in all leagues, and he's worth using as a No. 3 Fantasy receiver in Week 4 at Houston. In his past two games, Ayomanor has eight catches for 94 yards and two touchdowns on 11 targets, and he scored at least 13.8 PPR points in each outing. Texans cornerback Derek Stingley Jr. (oblique) could be out, and Cam Ward seems to trust Ayomanor more than Calvin Ridley right now. It would be nice to see Ridley do something productive also, since he's scored 8.7 PPR points or less in all three games this year, but Ayomanor is worth a look if you need help at receiver in Week 4.\n            </p>\n            </div>\n</div>\n</td></tr><tr><td><div>\n    <div>\n                    <div>\n    <figure><img alt=\"team logo\" src=\"https://sports.cbsimg.net/fly/images/team-logos/422.svg\" /></figure>\n                                        </div>\n        <div>\n            <p><span>     \n                        NYG\n                    </span>\n                    <span>     \n                        N.Y.

yards on four targets, but I'll go back to him in Week 4 against the Chargers, especially in Jaxson Dart's first NFL start. Dart will likely lean on Robinson a lot in this matchup, and he had 18 targets in his first two games this season, albeit from Russell Wilson. That said, we know Robinson is a target hog and a reliable, short-area target. He's worth using as a No. 3 PPR receiver against the Chargers, who have allowed three receivers to score at least 12.8 PPR points this season.\n            </p>\n

off his best game of the season in Week 3 against Houston with six catches for 61 yards on seven targets, and he's looking like one of the more reliable weapons in the passing game for Jacksonville while Brian Thomas Jr. and Travis Hunter are struggling. Strange isn't a must-start Fantasy tight end in Week 4, but the 49ers have allowed a tight end to score a touchdown in each of the past two games with Juwan Johnson and Trey McBride. In deeper leagues, Strange is a quality streamer if you need a tight end.\n            </p>\n            </div>\n</div>\n</td></tr><tr><td><div>\n    <div>\n                    <div>\n    <figure><img

Hockenson to benefit with Carson Wentz under center, and that's what happened in Wentz's first start in Week 3 against Cincinnati. Hockenson had five catches for 49 yards and a touchdown on six targets, and he scored a season-high 15.9 PPR points. Jordan Addison's suspension is over, so we'll see how that impacts Hockenson. But I still like him as a low-end starter as long as Wentz is under center. It also helps that the Steelers are No. 2 in most Fantasy points allowed to opposing tight ends.\n            </p>\n            </div>\n</div>\n</td></tr><tr><td><div>\n    <div>\n

         Fannin gets one more chance to be a low-end starter in all leagues. His production has declined each week after he scored 13.6 PPR points in Week 1 against Cincinnati, and he only had 5.5 PPR points in Week 3 against Green Bay. He also had nine targets against the Bengals, and he combined for nine targets the past two weeks against the Ravens and Packers. This is an easier matchup in Week 4 against the Lions, who are No. 5 in fewest Fantasy points allowed to opposing tight ends. I'd also use David Njoku as a low-end starter in all leagues as well.\n            </p>\n            </div>\n</div>\n</td></tr><tr><td><div>\n    <div>\n                    <div>\n    <figure><img

see what happens with Chris Godwin (ankle) and if he's able to make his season debut in Week 4. But with Mike Evans (hamstring) out and Godwin out or limited, we could see an expanded role for Otton, making him a low-end starter in deeper leagues. Last year, when Evans and Godwin were injured, Otton scored at least 18 PPR points in three of four games from Week 7 through Week 10, and he had at least eight targets in each outing. Emeka Egbuka wasn't on the roster then, so keep that in mind. But Otton could be a streaming option in deeper leagues if his role expands in this game.\n            </p>\n

The higher the number next to a player's name, the more confident I am that you should start him. <strong>The numbers are not a projection, just a confidence score to help you pick who to start. </strong>Every relevant player for this week is here, so if a player isn't listed, don't start him.</p><p>      To find a specific player, use your search function -- CTRL-F on PCs and Command-F on Macs. If neither of those are options, or if you're on a mobile device, you can scroll by game. If you're <em>still </em>unsure, just send a note on X.com (<a href=\"https://twitter.com/daverichard\" target=\"_blank\">@daverichard</a>) and I'll give it a look, time permitting.

That may not bode well for the Cowboys' depleted offensive line, but Jerry Jones doesn't think Parsons will be unstoppable.</p><p>In an appearance on 105.3 The Fan, Jones acknowledged that Parsons is a terrific player who makes a major impact on defense. On the other hand, Jones also noted that there are ways to game plan around Parsons while pointing out that the Cowboys didn't make any <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://cbssports.com/nfl/superbowl/\">Super Bowl</a> runs during Parsons' tenure.</p><p>\"Let's make no mistake about it,\" Jones said. \"Micah is special, and we all know he is, and he can be disruptive. We have huge amounts of experience with the anecdotes that we've seen used on us for the last four years. While he does make great plays, there is also a way to approach playing against Micah, as we know, because we didn't exactly win the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://cbssports.com/nfl/superbowl/\">Super Bowl</a> during those years. ... Some plays it looks beautiful, but then other plays -- especially running plays -- you wish you had a different formation.\"</p>\n<p>It won't take long to find out if Jones is right about Parsons, especially since the Cowboys will down a pair of offensive lineman.

That's when all the drama was gone is when you decided to make the trade.\"</p><p>After four seasons with the Cowboys, Parsons couldn't reach an agreement with Jones on a contract extension. After very public negotiations turned sour, <span><a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/news/micah-parsons-traded-to-packers-cowboys-ship-out-all-pro-defender-who-signs-record-contract-with-green-bay/\" target=\"_blank\">Jones shipped Parsons up to the Packers</a></span> in exchange for defensive tackle <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/2079670/kenny-clark/\">Kenny Clark</a> and a pair of first-round picks.</p>\n<p>The Cowboys are off to a 1-2 start while the Packers are 2-1.

He came into play with 29 home runs and 35 stolen bases (on 43 tries), as well as another 41 extra-base hits. His contributions had been worth an estimated 5.6 Wins Above Replacement, according to Baseball Reference's calculations. </p>\n<p>At one point earlier in the summer, Crow-Armstrong appeared to have a shot at threatening the 40-40 mark. His performance worsened as the year went on, however, and he entered Friday hitting just .207/.253/.341 in the second half.</p><p>The other five players in the league to clear the 30-30 mark this season are <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/players/2507367/juan-soto/\">Juan Soto</a> and <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/players/1894627/francisco-lindor/\">Francisco Lindor</a> of the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/teams/NYM/new-york-mets/\">New York Mets</a>, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/players/3117913/corbin-carroll/\">Corbin Carroll</a> of the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/teams/ARI/arizona-diamondbacks/\">Arizona Diamondbacks</a>, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/players/2507358/jazz-chisholm/\">Jazz Chisholm</a> Jr. of the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/teams/NYY/new-york-yankees/\">New York Yankees</a>, and José Ramírez of the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/teams/CLE/cleveland-guardians/\">Cleveland Guardians</a>.</p>\n<p>The Cubs entered Friday with an 89-70 record on the season, putting them in possession of the National League's top wild card spot.

    "body": "<div>\n        <p>It's not just <span>Gavi</span> and <span>Lamine Yamal</span>. Hansi Flick's <span>Barcelona</span> are now dealing with an injury crisis at the worst time possible. Starting winger <span>Raphinha</span> and starting keeper <span>Joan Garcia</span> will be absent for the next few weeks due to injuries that will push the Spanish Club's depth to its limits. Just as teenage sensation Lamine Yamal returned to practice, Gavi went down with a knee injury, and surgery is likely to keep him out up to five months. Then to add insult, and injury, to injury, Raphinha picked up a hamstring injury that the team announced will sideline him up to three weeks and keeper Joan Garcia went down with his own knee injury, and is also expected to be out 4-6 weeks.</p><p>Barcelona's starting XI is among the best in the world, but with a bench of academy players and players who fell out of favor at their former clubs, there are performance drop-offs when Barcelona are forced into wholesale changes. Those drops can be mitigated in matches like Barcelona's defeat of <span>Real Oviedo</span>, but even then, the lack of depth in midfield showed.</p><p>Frenkie de Jong had to come on at half for <span>Marc Casado</span> for Barcelona's attack to return to normal, while <span>Robert Lewandowski's</span> introduction for Raphinha was the moment that things got out of reach for the newly promoted side. This chopping and changing is one of Barcelona's strengths when their <span>stars</span> are healthy, but can become a weakness quite quickly in a competitive La Liga title race.</p><h2>Current Barcelona injuries </h2><table><tbody><tr><th>Name</th><th>Postion</th><th>Injury type</th></tr><tr><td><p>Gavi</p></td><td><p>Midfielder</p></td><td><p>Knee surgery</p></td></tr><tr><td><p><span>Marc-Andre ter Stegen</span></p></td><td><p>Goalkeeper</p></td><td><p>Back</p></td></tr><tr><td><p><span>Alejandro Balde</span></p></td><td><p>Defender</p></td><td><p>Hamstring</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Joan Garcia</p></td><td><p>Goalkeeper</p></td><td><p>Meniscus tear</p></td></tr><tr><td><p><span>Fermin Lopez</span></p></td><td><p>Midfielder</p></td><td><p>Muscular injury</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Raphinha</p></td><td><p>Forward</p></td><td><p>Hamstring</p></td></tr></tbody></table><p><span>Pedri</span> and de Jong are great at linking up play to transition defense into good opportunities for the attack while keeping defenses honest with shots from outside of the box, but when one of them doesn't play, the system gets off track. <span>Marc Bernal</span> and Casado will grow as players, but time isn't on Barcelona's side.</p><p>All of which is to say that Barcelona lack depth, and that manpower shortage couldn't come at worse time. In the next 30 days Barcelona play six times, culminating in the first El Clasico of the season in Madrid on October 26. Between now and then they have tricky league matches against <span>Real Sociedad</span> and <span>Sevilla</span>, not to mention Wednesday's Champions League showdown with defending champions <span>Paris</span> Saint-Germain. Even if Barca were at full strength, Flick would have to rotate his squad, and that'll be an even bigger challenge with fewer bodies available.</p><p>Then there's the little matter of their rivals for the LaLiga title.</p><h2><span>Real Madrid</span> are playing to their potential</h2><p>Under Xabi Alonso, Los Blancos have already opened up a two point lead at the top of LaLiga. Currently, that's manageable as just one victory over Real Madrid will see Barcelona go top of the pile. But that undersells just how strong Real Madrid have been this season. They are perfect so far, that's without <span>England</span> superstar <span>Jude Bellingham</span> even starting a match as he recovers from injury. </p><p>When <span>Kylian Mbappe</span> joined Madrid ahead of last season from PSG, the expectation was that they would win everything in their path as the team's depth and topline talent was too strong to cope with. Now with a shift in manager, that's happening as Mbappe has settled and is already outdoing his inaugural Real Madrid season, which saw him score 31 goals in 34 LaLiga games. With seven goals in six league matches, he has been a focal point, but it has been far from a one man <span>show</span>. Vinicius Junior is finding his footing, and the defense which added two new starters in <span>Trent Alexander-Arnold</span> (currently injured) from <span>Liverpool</span> and <span>Dean Huijsen</span> from Bournemouth and keeping other attacks at bay. It's still early, but this seems like a generational Real Madrid squad. </p><h2>Pressure to perform</h2><p>After winning the LaLiga title and making it to the Champions League quarterfinals last season in his first campaign in charge, expectations are high for what Flick can do. It was a quiet transfer window with <span>Marcus Rashford</span> being Barcelona's biggest addition, along with adding Garcia to be the new starting keeper. Flick is reliant on improvement from last season, but when Barca doesn't have the financial power to match their rivals and are still not able to return to Camp Nou due to renovations taking longer than expected, injuries could leave this team primed for disappointment.</p><p>Granted, disappointment at Barcelona could include a season where they only win the Copa Del Rey and crash out of the Champions League in the quarterfinals again, but that's life at a super club. When these things happen, changes can come swiftly, which is why, despite Barcelona's strong start to the season, Flick will need to figure out rotations quickly. </p><p>Lamine Yamal's return to training will help, but if one of Casado or Bernal doesn't step up in midfield, things like pushing defender Eric Garcia up the pitch could be next. The issue with that is it makes Barca more vulnerable to counterattacks than they already are. Without adjustments, the LaLiga race could be over by November. The combination of Real Madrid's unrelenting pace and Barcelona's injuries hitting at the worst time possible could see Real Madrid build an insurmountable leads before you blink. </p>\n            </div>"

Tamura, 27, died of a self-inflicted gunshot wound after the July 28 rampage. Investigators believe he intended to reach the NFL's offices but entered the wrong elevator bank, ultimately carrying out the attack in other parts of the building.</p><p>\"Following a thorough assessment and extensive analysis by our neuropathology experts, OCME has found unambiguous diagnostic evidence of Chronic Traumatic Encephalopathy, also known as CTE, in the brain tissue of the decedent.

I'm sorry,\" one note read, according to investigators. </p>\n<p>Police also recovered a three-page letter in his pocket, stating, \"The League knowingly concealed the dangers to our brains to maximize profits\" and requesting that his brain be donated for research.</p><p>CTE is a degenerative brain disease linked to repeated head trauma, most commonly seen in athletes who play contact sports such as football, hockey and boxing. Symptoms can include memory loss, impaired judgment, mood disorders and aggression. It can only be definitively diagnosed after death.</p><p>Though Tamura never played beyond high school, his family has said he suffered from migraines, multiple concussions and mental illness.</p>\n<p>His writings referenced Chris Nowinski, a leading CTE researcher, and echoed years of legal battles between former NFL players and the league over head injuries.</p><p>Experts cautioned against attributing Tamura's actions to the disease. \"Whatever's in his brain is never going to be the reason for what happened,\" <a href=\"https://www.cbsnews.com/newyork/news/nyc-office-shooting-gunman-cte-claims-brain-analysis/\" target=\"_blank\">Nowinski told CBS New York</a>. \"Human behavior is far too complex for that.\"</p><p>Authorities say Tamura drove from Las Vegas to New York days before the attack. Carrying an M4 rifle, he opened fire in the Park Avenue lobby, killing Islam, a father of two with a third child on the way, as well as Etienne and LePatner. He then rode an elevator to the 33rd floor, where he fatally shot Hyman before killing himself. One NFL employee was among those injured but survived.</p>\n            </div>"

I'm a historian, so I know, kind of, the history, geopolitically, in the area. I'm a huge fan of Guinness. I don't really drink beer, but if I do, I drink Guinness. That's not a bullshit line that I'm telling you guys. It's the truth. I've heard it tastes different off the tap on Ireland and the States.
