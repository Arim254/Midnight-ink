The model is up well over $7,000 for $100 players on top-rated <a href=\"https://www.sportsline.com/nfl/picks/\" target=\"_blank\">NFL picks</a> since its inception. The model is on a sizzling 37-17 run on top-rated picks dating back to 2024. It also enters Week 26 of the 2025 MLB season a profitable 34-27 on top-rated MLB money-line picks. Anybody following its <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/betting/news/nfl/\" target=\"_blank\">NFL betting</a> picks and <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/betting/news/mlb/\" target=\"_blank\">MLB betting</a> picks at <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/betting/news/best-betting-apps/\" target=\"_blank\">sportsbooks</a> and on <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/betting/news/best-betting-apps/\" target=\"_blank\">betting sites</a> could have seen strong returns.</p><p><strong>Monday NFL best bets:</strong> </p><ul><li>Ravens vs. Lions Over 53.5 total points (-105)</li><li>Brewers vs. Padres Over 7 total runs (-118)</li><li>Giants (-149) to defeat the Cardinals</li></ul><p>Combining the model's three picks into a Monday parlay at DraftKings would result in a payout of +502 (risk $100 to win $502). <a href=\"https://martech.cbssports.com/bt/redirect/prod?b=draftkings&c=sport\" target=\"_blank\">Bet it at DraftKings here</a>:</p><h2>Ravens vs. Lions Over 54 total points (-105)</h2><p>Both of these offenses feature explosive playmakers. The Ravens are averaging 40.5 points per game this season, while the Lions dropped 52 points against the Bears in Week 2. In addition, the total has gone Over in six of Detroit's past eight games. The total has also gone Over in four of Baltimore's last five games. Ravens quarterback Lamar Jackson threw for 357 yards and three touchdowns and rushed for a score when these two teams last met in 2023. The model projects 55 combined points on Monday Night Football in a 30-25 Ravens win.</p><h2>Brewers vs. Padres Over 7 total runs (-118)</h2><p>Both teams are starting quality pitchers on Monday, but seven runs is about as low an over/under as you'll ever find on a baseball game. The Padres are starting Nick Pivetta, who is 13-5 with a 2.81 ERA on the season, but the 32-year-old allowed three runs in just 4 2/3 innings against the Mets on Wednesday. Meanwhile, the Padres are still playing meaningful baseball, as they have a shot to overtake the Dodgers atop the NL West, so they should come out aggressively. The Brewers are starting Freddy Peralta, who, although he hasn't allowed a run in five of his last seven starts, recently allowed five runs in five innings against the Rangers on Sept. 10. The model projects the Over to hit in 64% of simulations.</p><h2>Giants (-149) to defeat the Cardinals</h2><p>The Giants are coming off a 3-1 win over the Dodgers on Sunday to snap a three-game losing streak, and although neither the Giants nor the Cardinals are playing for the postseason, they are still playing out their seasons with the majority of starters. Giants pitcher Justin Verlander recently said he wants to pitch in 2026, but there's no guarantee of that, so Monday could be the final start for the Hall of Fame pitcher. Verlander has allowed just one run over his last four starts at age 42, and he has a 3.75 ERA as he still remains one of the most reliable pitchers in baseball. The model projects the Giants to win in 66% of simulations.</p><h2>Want more NFL picks and MLB picks for Monday, September 22?</h2><p><strong>You've seen the model's Monday best bets.

Ultimately, the Browns ended up nabbing Shedeur Sanders despite already selecting former Oregon signal-caller <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/3121534/dillon-gabriel/\">Dillon Gabriel</a> in the third round.</p>\n<p>Sanders is listed as the third quarterback on the Browns' depth chart behind starter <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/1250697/joe-flacco/\">Joe Flacco</a> and Gabriel. </p><p>If Sanders had landed with the Ravens, it's true he likely wouldn't have seen the field much unless Jackson suffered an injury.

Still, as the U.S. team began practice Monday to officially start of Ryder Cup week, Bradley admitted he couldn't stop thinking about what it'd be like to be playing with his guys. </p><p>\"Definitely. I've thought about it every second,\" Bradley said. \"But I've also thought about how impossible it would be. </p><p>\"Like I said earlier, I was picked to do this job as captain, and there's been certain things that I've done during the week or lead-up that if I was playing, I don't think I could have done at the level that I needed to do them at. I catch myself every now and then looking down the fairway, seeing the guys walk down the fairway and think how badly I'd like to do that, and how badly I'd want to be in the group with Scottie Scheffler and seeing him play and being his teammate.</p>\n<p>\"But I feel like I've been called for a bigger cause here, to help our guys get ready to play and play at the highest level. But in the back of my mind, I'm always thinking, 'I could have been out there.' But ultimately, I can't tell you how much I've enjoyed being the captain and how I've enjoyed not having to worry about getting to sleep and getting my rest or how I haven't had to think about what time I'm going to go practice or meet my coach and then meet the guys. It simplified things a lot for me.\"</p><a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/golf/news/ryder-cup-2025-schedule-dates-format-explained-teams-bethpage-black/\" target=\"_blank\">\n        <div>\n            <div>\n                <p>2025 Ryder Cup schedule, dates: Format explained each day with teams set for Bethpage Black</p>\n                <p>\n                    Patrick McDonald                </p>\n            </div>\n                            <div>\n    <figure><img alt=\"2025 Ryder Cup schedule, dates: Format explained each day with teams set for Bethpage Black\" src=\"https://sportshub.cbsistatic.com/i/r/2025/09/22/bca4bb51-b3d1-44be-aba7-e55ad5ddf928/thumbnail/270x152/3f772af3eb3c7a19cc7407e599810310/ryder-cup-bethpage-tent-g.jpg\" /></figure>\n                </div>\n                    </div>\n    </a>\n<p>The hardest part of this for Bradley is clearly being out on the course, unable to help the team by hitting actual shots. At the same time, it seems like he's relieved to not have to juggle his responsibilities all week, and seems content that he's made the right decision, both for himself and the team. </p>\n<p>That's easy to say Monday, and Bradley is hoping his team will reward him with a Ryder Cup victory celebration Sunday night. If he's hoisting the Cup as the sun goes down at Bethpage Black, he won't have any regrets. But if things go wrong, the emotions will be unlike anything a Ryder Cup captain has ever felt, wondering if his biggest mistake was not picking up the clubs himself. </p>\n            </div>"

In fact, Harris is the only NFL player to rush for over 1,000 yards in each of the past four years. </p><p>Durability is one of the biggest reasons for Harris' consistency as he has never missed a game in his NFL career. Harris played in each of the Chargers' first three games this season despite sustaining an eye injury this summer that sidelined him for a significant portion of training camp. </p>\n<p>With Harris out, the Chargers will lean more on rookie first-round pick <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/28908905/omarion-hampton/\">Omarion Hampton</a>, who gave the Chargers the lead Sunday on a 3-yard touchdown run shortly after Harris' departure.

These teams met at M&T Bank Stadium less than two years ago as the Ravens won 38-6 against a Lions team that would end up in that year's NFC Title Game.

There was a reason for the rough outing: Coach Kyle Whittingham revealed Monday that Dampier had been dealing with an injury, despite not being listed on the availability reports last week.</p><p>\"He was doing the best he could,\" <a href=\"https://youtu.be/-IDLxGk2xQk?si=xmJ5KmVI3_gvc2j4\" target=\"_blank\">Whittingham said</a>. \"Wasn't able to practice Tuesday or Wednesday, a little bit Thursday. I'm going to tell you it definitely impacted Devon, but if you're out there, you got to get it done. So we never use that as an excuse.\"</p><p>Dampier sustained an ankle injury during Utah's Week 3 road game at <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/teams/WYO/wyoming-cowboys/\">Wyoming</a>, analyst Joel Klatt noted on Saturday's broadcast. He was also reportedly seen limping after that contest. The injury kept him from fully participating in Utah's normal padded practices, limiting his preparation for the Big 12 opener against the Red Raiders.</p><p>The 2025 season marks the first year of formal Big 12 player availability reports, following the lead of the ACC, Big Ten and SEC. Under the new rules, programs must submit daily reports starting three days before each game, with a final update 90 minutes before kickoff, listing players as available, probable, questionable, doubtful or out. </p>\n<a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/news/big-12-to-mandate-player-availability-reports-for-football-basketball-starting-in-2025-26/\" target=\"_blank\">\n        <div>\n            <div>\n                <p>Big 12 to mandate player availability reports for football, basketball starting in 2025-26</p>\n                <p>\n                    Cody Nagel                </p>\n            </div>\n                            <div>\n    <figure><img alt=\"Big 12 to mandate player availability reports for football, basketball starting in 2025-26\" src=\"https://sportshub.cbsistatic.com/i/r/2025/08/13/359b657a-6323-4653-a349-7f07af0e2fa1/thumbnail/270x152/e362839f78986782148905966e150e45/big-12.jpg\" /></figure>\n                </div>\n                    </div>\n    </a>\n<p>Although Dampier missed multiple practices, he was not listed on Utah's availability report last week before making his fourth start for the Utes.</p><p>Despite the setback, Whittingham emphasized that Dampier's current condition is improving when asked if the injury could be a long-term concern.</p><p>\"We hope not,\" Whittingham said. \"But again, we never discuss injuries here other than the injury report, so we will just have to see how it goes. I think he's in a better place. Well, I know he's in a better place right now on Monday than he was last Monday, so that bodes well.\"</p>\n<p>Dampier completed 25 of 38 passes for 162 yards in the loss. Utah's lone big play came on the first snap of their only touchdown drive, when Dampier connected with <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/players/29164633/dallen-bentley/\">Dallen Bentley</a> for a 44-yard gain. That score brought the Utes within 13-10 with 10:22 remaining in the fourth quarter, before Texas Tech pulled away with three unanswered touchdowns to close out the game.</p><p>Through the first three games of the season, Dampier had completed 73% of his passes for 628 yards and seven touchdowns without an interception. He had also added 198 rushing yards and a touchdown on the ground, showing the dual-threat ability that makes him Utah's centerpiece on offense.</p><p>\"(We) believe in him completely and he's without a doubt our quarterback and you can't panic off one game that was not up to par,\" Whittingham said. \"And again, we already talked about another reason why that may have been. ... I don't think one subpar game is fair to judge him off that. The first three games he was pretty darn good.\"</p>\n<p>Utah is on the road at <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/teams/WVU/west-virginia-mountaineers/\">West Virginia</a> this Saturday.</p>\n            </div>"

He edged out over 355,000 other entrants in the contest and also has multiple five-figure tournament wins on his DFS resume. Kaylor has covered the NFL and college football for close to a decade as a member of the Pro Football Writers of America, and his background as a former college and NFL player gives him a unique perspective when building his fantasy lineups and locking in his betting picks. </p><p>Now, Kaylor has turned his attention to 'Monday Night Football' and just locked in his top daily Fantasy football picks. <a href=\"https://www.sportsline.com/insiders/nfl-dfs-picks-lions-vs-ravens-fantasy-lineup-advice-monday-night-football-projections-for-draftkings-fanduel-from-millionaire-maker-contest-winner/#ttag=09222025_agg_cbssports_dfs_football_nfl_jimmiekaylor_MondayNightFootballDFS\" target=\"_blank\">You can only see his Monday Night Football DFS picks and analysis at SportsLine</a>.</p><p><em>New users can </em><a href=\"https://martech.cbssports.com/bt/redirect/prod?b=draftkings&c=dfs\" target=\"_blank\"><em>get $50 in Pick6 credits at DraftKings when they play $5</em></a><em>: </em></p><h2>Top NFL DFS picks, lineups, stacks for Monday Night Football</h2><p>One of Kaylor's top DFS picks for 'Monday Night Football' is Ravens running back Derrick Henry, who has an over/under of 86.5 rushing yards. Experts have been predicting a decline for the now 31-year-old back for years now, and it simply is not happening. He opened this season with a massive 18-169-2 rushing line against the Bills in Week 1, before having a quieter Week 2 effort against the Browns.</p><p>The Lions have given up a rushing touchdown in both games so far in 2025, and with the Ravens favored, Henry could see heavy usage late in the game if they need to run the clock. <a href=\"https://www.sportsline.com/insiders/nfl-dfs-picks-lions-vs-ravens-fantasy-lineup-advice-monday-night-football-projections-for-draftkings-fanduel-from-millionaire-maker-contest-winner/#ttag=09222025_agg_cbssports_dfs_football_nfl_jimmiekaylor_MondayNightFootballDFS\" target=\"_blank\">See who else to roster right here</a>.</p><p>Part of Kaylor's optimal NFL DFS strategy also includes rostering Lions receiver Amon-Ra St. Brown. After being limited in Week 1, St. Brown exploded with nine catches for 115 yards and three touchdowns in the Week 2 win against the Bears. He's already been targeted 17 times this season, so he's the clear No. 1 option for quarterback Jared Goff since no other receiver has been targeted more than nine times. </p><p>In the only game where they've faced a competent passing attack, the Ravens gave up nearly 400 yards through the air against the Bills.

The two-time NFL MVP is one of the most dangerous dual-threat quarterbacks in the league, combining elite passing efficiency with game-changing rushing ability. In 2024, he completed 316 of 474 attempts for 4,172 passing yards, 41 touchdowns and only four interceptions. He also rushed for 915 yards adding four rushing touchdowns, making him the first quarterback ever to exceed 4,000 passing yards <em>and</em> 900 rushing yards in a single season.</p><p>In 2025, he has thrown for 434 yards, six passing touchdowns, and zero interceptions, while registering a QBR among the top in the league thus far. Over his career to date, Jackson has accumulated over 20,000 passing yards, more than 150 touchdown passes, and has kept his interception numbers relatively low, all while amassing among the highest rushing yard totals in quarterback history.  <a href=\"https://www.sportsline.com/insiders/nfl-dfs-week-3-ravens-vs-lions-optimal-fanduel-draftkings-lineups-for-monday-night-football-from-a-daily-fantasy-pro/#ttag=09222025_agg_cbssports_dfs_football_nfl_McClure_LionsRavensMNFDFS\" target=\"_blank\">See who else to roster here</a>.</p><p>Part of McClure's NFL DFS strategy also includes rostering Detroit running back Jahmyr Gibbs. The former Alabama standout is a versatile, explosive running back whose blend of speed, receiving ability, and vision make him a threat to break off an explosive play on nearly every snap. In 2024 he had a breakout season, rushing for 1,412 rushing yards and 16 rushing touchdowns, while adding 52 receptions for 517 yards with four receiving scores. </p><p>Gibbs led the NFL in total touchdowns (20) in 2024, tying or setting multiple franchise records along the way.

That was the first clear sign that the first expansion team to enter the league since 2008 had something special brewing. </p><p>Over the next six months, the Valkyries set the standard for the coming wave of expansion with an incredible debut campaign, both on and off the court. They went 23-21 to earn the No. 8 seed in the playoffs, had the Coach of the Year and the Most Improved Player and sold out every single home game at Chase Center, a.k.a Ballhalla. </p><p>The Valkyries' 23 wins were the most ever by an expansion team in its inaugural season, and they became the first expansion team to make the playoffs in its inaugural season. </p><a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/wnba/news/how-the-valkyries-created-an-unmatched-wnba-home-court-advantage-and-why-expectations-are-high-in-ballhalla/\" target=\"_blank\">\n        <div>\n            <div>\n                <p>How the Valkyries created an unmatched WNBA home-court advantage and why expectations are high in 'Ballhalla'</p>\n                <p>\n                    Jack Maloney                </p>\n            </div>\n                            <div>\n    <figure><img alt=\"How the Valkyries created an unmatched WNBA home-court advantage and why expectations are high in 'Ballhalla'\" src=\"https://sportshub.cbsistatic.com/i/r/2025/08/06/000cbd92-0d5a-435c-97e6-52ab6848d8cc/thumbnail/270x152/b6873147d785021949fce6d8301791cc/valkyries-getty.png\" /></figure>\n                </div>\n                    </div>\n    </a>\n<p>Natalie Nakase, the first coach in franchise history, built an elite defense and made the Valkyries one of the most difficult teams to play against in the league despite a lack of starpower. For her efforts, she was named COY. <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/wnba/players/28850640/veronica-burton/\">Veronica Burton</a>, who arrived from the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/wnba/teams/CT/connecticut-sun/\">Connecticut Sun</a> in the expansion draft, took on the starting point guard role and put together a career year that not only garnered the MIP trophy, but may earn her an All-WNBA and/or All-Defensive honor. </p>\n<p>Ballhalla, meanwhile, became one of the team's greatest strengths. The Valkyries went 14-8 at home, compared to 9-13 on the road, and sold out every single game. Their average attendance of 18,064 and total attendance of 397,408 were both all-time records. </p><p>Though the Valkyries bowed out of the playoffs in the first round after being swept by the top-seeded <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/wnba/teams/MIN/minnesota-lynx/\">Minnesota Lynx</a>, they did so with their heads held high. </p><p>\"So proud. That's the first thing I said,\" Nakase said after the Valkyries' devastating season-ending loss in Game 2. \"No. 1, I said, 'Get your f-----g heads up'. I said, 'Get your heads up.' They were down. I said, 'I want everyone's eye contact. I want to feel every person right now. And I want your emotions, I want your heart, I want everything.' Everyone looked up and I just told them how proud I was. To have that place rocking tonight, to have that Ballhalla mentality, to be able to go toe-and-toe to the No. 1 team, I was so proud.\"</p>\n<p>After a special inaugural season, the Valkyries are well positioned to take a leap in 2026, but like every other team will have to first navigate a complex offseason. </p><h2>Season at a glance</h2><ul><li><strong>Record: </strong>23-21 (No. 8 seed)</li><li><strong>Offensive rating: </strong>101.5 (10th)</li><li><strong>Defensive rating: </strong>99.8 (3rd)</li><li><strong>Net rating: </strong>plus-1.7 (8th)</li></ul><h2>Biggest strength</h2><p><strong>Defense</strong></p><p>The Valkyries were an absolute nightmare to play against all season long. They were physical, relentless and forced teams into inefficient looks. Notably, they allowed just 12.1 attempts per game in the restricted area, which was by far the fewest this season. In fact, only the 2018 <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/wnba/teams/LVA/las-vegas-aces/\">Las Vegas Aces</a> (10.6) have ever allowed fewer over the course of a season. Overall, the Valkyries finished third in defensive rating (99.8) and first in field goal defense (40.5%). </p><h2>Biggest weakness</h2><p><strong>Shooting</strong></p><p>Nakase made it clear prior to the season that she wanted to run a modern offense predicated on getting up a lot of 3-pointers. She was not lying. The Valkyries 29.9 attempts per game and 1,314 total attempts not only led the league, but were single-season records. Unfortunately for the Valkyries, they didn't make many of them. Their 32.5% clip ranked 11th out of 13 teams. If the Valkyries want to continue playing like this, they need players who can actually knock down shots on a regular basis. </p>\n<h2>Key free agents</h2><ul><li>Veronica Burton (restricted)</li><li><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/wnba/players/29375194/temi-fagbenle/\">Temi Fagbenle</a> (unrestricted)</li><li><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/wnba/players/1981034/tiffany-hayes/\">Tiffany Hayes</a> (unrestricted)</li><li><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/wnba/players/26678082/kayla-thornton/\">Kayla Thornton</a> (unrestricted)</li><li>Iliana Rupert (reserved)</li><li>Janelle Salaün (reserved)</li><li><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/wnba/players/29375197/cecilia-zandalasini/\">Cecilia Zandalasini</a> (restricted)</li></ul><p>Every team is going to have more free agents than usual this offseason. There are only two players -- <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/wnba/players/29105418/kalani-brown/\">Kalani Brown</a> and <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/wnba/players/26678088/lexie-brown/\">Lexie Brown</a> -- in the entire league not on a rookie scale deals who are under contract for 2026. Every other veteran set up their contract to expire after the 2025 season with an eye on a big pay raise once the new collective bargaining agreement takes effect. </p><p>But even by this season's unique standards, the Valkyries have a lot of moving parts. Because they selected their inaugural roster via an expansion draft last December and didn't have multiple years of their own draft picks, they only have two players under contract for 2026: <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/wnba/players/29362928/carla-leite/\">Carla Leite</a> and <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/wnba/players/29362998/kate-martin/\">Kate Martin</a>, and neither of them have guaranteed deals. They also control the rights to 2025 first-round pick Justė Jocytė, who did not come over to the WNBA this season. </p><p>Multiple players acknowledged during their exit interviews that it's unlikely the Valkyries will have the same team next season. </p>\n<p>\"We don't know who's going to stay, who's going to go. We have no idea,\" Cecilia Zandalasini said. \"We would love to stay on the same team because we enjoy each other. We had a great, great time this summer, so that would be our dream, probably. But it's business, it's the W, and it has to grow and expand. It worked out well for this team, so we will see.\"</p><p>The Valkyries will surely want to bring back a number of players from this season's team. Retaining Burton, in particular, stands out as a priority. Thanks to their initial success, rabid fanbase and highly-respected coaching staff and front office, the Valkyries could also be in the mix for some big-name free agents this winter. </p><p>But until the new CBA is in place and we know the rules for free agency, as well as key numbers such as the 2026 salary cap and the new maximum, minimum and rookie salaries, it's too difficult to predict the Valkyries' plans with any sort of specificity. </p>\n<h2>Draft outlook</h2><ul><li>Nos. 8, 23 and 38 overall</li></ul><p>The Valkyries own all of their own picks in the 2026 draft, but No. 8 overall is by far the most important. Historically, late second- and third-round picks rarely make rosters, let alone develop into rotation players.</p><p>A unique free agency period and a double expansion draft makes it difficult to know what the Valkyries' biggest needs may be come draft time, but we do have an idea of the players who could be available at No. 8 and would fit Nakase's style. </p><ul><li><strong>Gianna Kneepkens -- F, UCLA</strong></li></ul><p>The Valkyries want to shoot a lot of 3s, and few players do that better than Kneepkens, who transferred to UCLA for her fifth and final collegiate season. During her four seasons at Utah, she went 248 of 574 (43.2%) from behind the arc. Last season was particularly impressive as she shot 44.8% on a career-high 6.8 attempts per game. </p>\n<ul><li><strong>Yarden Garzon -- F, Maryland</strong></li></ul><p>Garzon, who transferred from Indiana to Maryland this summer, is another elite shooter from behind the arc. During her three seasons with the Hoosiers, she made 220 of 516 (42.6%) of her 3-point attempts. Standing 6-foot-3, Garzon also has excellent size on the wing and can play multiple positions. </p>\n            </div>"
