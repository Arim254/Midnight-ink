The Buckeyes have only allowed 16 points through three games, including holding Texas to 7 points in a hard-hitting opener. Meanwhile, Washington's offense has been dynamic in Jed Fisch's second season, but the Huskies haven't been tested yet. <strong>The model says the Under hits in 62% of simulations.</strong></p><p>Alabama +2.5 vs. Georgia</p><p>The Crimson Tide got off guard by Florida State in Week 1, but they looked pretty motivated to put that loss behind them in a 73-0 win as 34.5-point favorites over Louisiana-Monroe and then a 38-14 win as 19.5-point favorites over Wisconsin. Now Alabama renews its cream-of-the-crop SEC rivalry with Georgia, and despite the Bulldogs winning multiple national championships to stake their claim as arguably the best program in the SEC, the Crimson Tide have won nine of 10 head-to-head. Georgia nearly got upset in a shootout against Tennessee and the model thinks <strong>Alabama has enough offense to cover in 53% of simulations.</strong></p><p>Over 49.5 in Colorado vs. BYU</p><p>BYU is up to No. 25 in the rankings after getting off to a 3-0 start and the defense is tied for first with Ohio State in points allowed per game (5.3). However, the Cougars did give up 404 yards of total offense to East Carolina last week and Colorado is coming off its best offensive performance of the season. Kaidon Salter threw for 304 yards and three touchdowns in a win over Wyoming and added 86 yards and a touchdown as a runner. Meanwhile, BYU is averaging 7.0 yards per play on offense and the Colorado defense is giving up 409.3 yards per game. <strong>The model says the Over hits in 57% of simulations.</strong></p><h2>Want more college football picks for Saturday, September 26?</h2><p><strong>You've seen some of the model's Saturday college football best bets.

Wentz should be aided by the return of wideout <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/3162290/jordan-addison/\">Jordan Addison</a>, who missed the season's first three games while on suspension. </p><p><strong>More Mason?</strong> With <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/2071937/aaron-jones/\">Aaron Jones</a> injured, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/2967536/jordan-mason/\">Jordan Mason</a> picked up the slack with 116 yards and two touchdowns during last Sunday's win over Cincinnati. Mason is looking to have similar success against a Steelers defense that has already allowed two 100-yard rushers this season in <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/3123469/breece-hall/\">Breece Hall</a> and <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/3121372/kenneth-walker-iii/\">Kenneth Walker III</a>. </p><p><strong>Turn down for Watt.</strong> <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/2071793/t-j-watt/\">T.J. Watt</a> snapped his six-game drought without a sack by getting two during last week's win over the Patriots. Watt leads a formidable Pittsburgh pass rush that has been buoyed by <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/3162091/nick-herbig/\">Nick Herbig</a> and rookie <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/26693445/jack-sawyer/\">Jack Sawyer</a>.  </p>\n<p><strong>Same old Rodgers. </strong>The 41-year-old Rodgers has enjoyed a solid start to his Steelers tenure. He is currently tied for second in the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://cbssports.com/nfl/\">NFL</a> in touchdown passes and is a big reason why Pittsburgh's offense is No. 2 in the NFL in red zone efficiency. </p><h2>Steelers vs. Vikings prediction, pick </h2>\n<p>For me, this game comes down to whether the Steelers' defense can make the Vikings' offense one-dimensional. If they can contain Mason and force the Vikings into obvious passing downs, that should bode well for Pittsburgh's pass rush against a quarterback who isn't very mobile. The Steelers' revamped secondary -- which includes newcomers <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/2071515/jalen-ramsey/\">Jalen Ramsey</a>, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/2136536/jabrill-peppers/\">Jabrill Peppers</a> -- should also aid Pittsburgh's pass rush. <em><strong>Pick: Steelers, Under 40.5</strong></em></p>\n            </div>"

It enters the final weeks of the 2025 MLB regular season a profitable 34-28 on top-rated MLB money-line picks. It has excelled making home run prop picks this season, returning more than 25 units of profit. For college football, the model is a profitable 35-22 combined on money-line and over/under college football picks since the beginning of 2024. Anybody following its <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/betting/news/mlb/\" target=\"_blank\">MLB betting</a> picks or <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/betting/news/college-football/\" target=\"_blank\">college football betting</a> picks at <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/betting/news/best-betting-apps/\" target=\"_blank\">sportsbooks</a> and on <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/betting/news/best-betting-apps/\" target=\"_blank\">betting sites</a> could have seen strong returns.</p><h2>Saturday best bets at DraftKings Sportsbook</h2><ul><li>Penn State (+142) to defeat Penn State</li><li>Alabama (+2.5) vs. Georgia (-105)</li><li>Diamondbacks vs. Padres Over 7.5 total runs (-115)</li></ul><p>Combining the model's three picks into a Saturday parlay at DraftKings would result in a payout of +783 (risk $100 to win $763). <a href=\"https://martech.cbssports.com/bt/redirect/prod?b=draftkings&c=sport\" target=\"_blank\">Bet it at DraftKings here</a>:</p><h2>Oregon (+142) to defeat Penn State</h2><p>Oregon had 469 yards of total offense in its 45-37 victory over Penn State in last year's Big Ten Championship Game, and although a lot of the offensive pieces are gone from last year's team, the Ducks have proven through four weeks to still have one of the best offenses in college football. Oregon ranks No. 5 in the nation at 48 points per game, and the Ducks are coming off a 41-7 win over Oregon State last week. The Ducks rank fifth in yards per rush (6.8) and ninth in rushing yards per game (256) this fall. Meanwhile, they also rank fifth in yards per pass (10.0), dominating in both the passing and rushing attacks. The model projects Oregon to win in 47% of simulations, while the Ducks' +142 odds give an implied odds of 41.32%, projecting value in this play at DraftKings.</p><h2>Alabama (+2.5) vs. Georgia (-105)</h2><p>Alabama is 9-1 over its last 10 games against Georgia, and 44-26-4 all-time in their rivalry as two of the consistently top programs in college football. Despite Georgia being home and the No. 5 team in the nation, while Alabama ranks 17th, a program like the Crimson Tide can never be overlooked. Alabama scheduled itself two weeks to prepare for this matchup with a bye last week following its 38-14 win over Wisconsin to improve to 2-1 this season. Georgia is also coming off a bye, but the Bulldogs had a challenging 44-41 overtime victory over Tennessee the last time they took the field. Alabama junior quarterback Ty Simpson threw for 382 yards and four touchdowns against Wisconsin as he appears more confident as the Crimson Tide QB1, and Simpson has nine touchdowns compared to zero interceptions this season. The model projects Alabama to cover the spread in 53% of simulations.</p><h2>Diamondbacks vs. Padres Over 7.5 total runs (-115)</h2><p>Arizona was eliminated from the postseason following its 7-4 loss to the Padres on Friday, but the model still projects offensive success from these two clubs. The Diamondbacks are the No. 4 scoring team (4.91 runs per game), and they've gone Over this total in five straight games, including on Friday. The Padres are starting Michael King, who is two starts removed from allowing eight runs over three innings to the Mets on Sept. 16, and he's making just his fifth start since mid-May following a knee injury. The Diamondbacks are starting Eduardo Rodriguez, who allowed four runs in four innings to the Padres in July when he last faced San Diego.

    "body": "<div>\n        <p>No double-digit favorites have lost yet in the 2025 NFL season, but Week 3 did bring perhaps the biggest upset of the year thus far as the Packers fell to the Browns as 7.5-point favorites. That was one of the first big hits for NFL survivor players, and now those who remain are formulating their Week 4 NFL survivor picks with the options beginning to dwindle a bit. The Bills are the biggest favorites on the board (-15) this week against the Saints, though many survivor pool players already used Buffalo as big favorites against the Dolphins in Week 3. </p><p>The latest Week 4 NFL odds show six other games with a Week 4 NFL spread of 5.5 points or more, including Browns vs. Lions (-10), Patriots (-5.5) vs. Panthers, Titans vs. Texans (-7.5), Chargers vs. Giants (+6.5), Packers vs. Cowboys (+6.5) on Sunday night and Bengals vs. Broncos (-7.5) on Monday night. Those are the games many NFL survivor players will be targeting, but among those favorites, which ones bring the most value in NFL survivor pools? </p><p><em>Before finalizing any Week 4 NFL survivor picks, </em><a href=\"https://www.sportsline.com/insiders/nfl-survivor-pool-week-4-2025-pick-from-advanced-computer-model/#ttag=09252025_agg_cbssports_picks_football_nfl_model_survivorpool\" target=\"_blank\"><em>see which team the red-hot SportsLine Projection Model just went all-in on</em></a><em>.</em></p><p>The model, which simulates every NFL game 10,000 times, is up well over $7,000 for $100 players on top-rated <a href=\"https://www.sportsline.com/nfl/picks/\" target=\"_blank\">NFL picks</a> since its inception. The model is on a sizzling 39-19 run on top-rated picks dating back to 2024. Anybody following its <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/betting/news/nfl/\" target=\"_blank\">NFL betting</a> picks at <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/betting/news/best-betting-apps/\" target=\"_blank\">sportsbooks</a> and on <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/betting/news/best-betting-apps/\" target=\"_blank\">betting sites</a> could have seen strong returns. The model can be used to crush the survivor pool format, which calls for picking one team to win each week but never using the same team twice. It survived through Week 1 by calling the Commanders over the Giants, Week 2 with the Ravens over the Browns, and Week 3 with Bills over Dolphins.</p><p>Now, it has turned its attention to the latest Week 4 NFL schedule and locked in its Week 4 survivor pool pick. <a href=\"https://www.sportsline.com/insiders/nfl-survivor-pool-week-4-2025-pick-from-advanced-computer-model/#ttag=09252025_agg_cbssports_picks_football_nfl_model_survivorpool\" target=\"_blank\">You can only see who the model is backing this week at SportsLine</a>. </p><p><em>New users can also target the </em><span><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/betting/news/draftkings-promo-code/\"><em>DraftKings promo code</em></a></span><em>, which offers </em><a href=\"https://martech.cbssports.com/bt/redirect/prod?b=draftkings&c=sport\" target=\"_blank\"><em>$200 in bonus bets instantly plus over $200 off NFL Sunday Ticket</em></a><em>:</em></p><h3>Top Week 4 NFL survivor pool predictions </h3><p>In Week 4 of the 2025 NFL season, the model is shying away from the Patriots as they take on the Carolina Panthers. The Patriots are 5.5-point and -247 money-line favorites, as one of the home favorites in the Week 4 lines, but are coming off a 21-14 loss to the Pittsburgh Steelers. The Panthers, meanwhile, got into the win column in a big way by thrashing the Falcons. Fading Carolina prior to that game was a popular NFL survivor strategy. </p><p>The model, however, projects this to be a one-score game, and only has New England winning 58% of the time, which is lower than many home teams this week. Drake Maye has had mixed results in three games and is still getting acclimated as the Patriots' starting quarterback. He has played in 16 games over the course of two seasons, and is completing 68% of his passes for 3,061 yards with 20 touchdowns and 12 interceptions.

The Ducks are 4-0, outscoring opponents 203-37. Last week, quarterback <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/players/28895698/dante-moore/\">Dante Moore</a> carved up rival <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/teams/OREGST/oregon-state-beavers/\">Oregon State</a> for 305 yards and four touchdowns in <span><a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/news/b1g-time-charting-the-leagues-historic-qb-play-penn-states-james-franklin-seeks-breakthrough-vs-oregon/\" target=\"_blank\">a 41-7 rout</a></span>.</p><p><em>You can <a href=\"https://martech.cbssports.com/bt/redirect/prod?b=fanduel&c=sport\" target=\"_blank\">bet college football games this week at FanDuel Sportsbook</a>, where new users get $300 in bonus bets with a winning $5 wager. <a href=\"https://martech.cbssports.com/bt/redirect/prod?b=fanduel&c=sport\" target=\"_blank\">Click here</a>:</em></p><p>The Ducks and Nittany Lions have met only five times, though conference realignment should make it a more regular clash. Their most recent matchup came in last year's Big Ten Championship Game, <span><a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/\" target=\"_blank\">when Oregon prevailed 45-37</a></span> as PSU backs <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/players/28876754/nicholas-singleton/\">Nicholas Singleton</a> and <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/players/28875485/kaytron-allen/\">Kaytron Allen</a> both topped 100 yards rushing.</p>\n<h2>Penn State vs. Oregon: Need to know</h2><p><strong>Franklin's futility:</strong> Penn State coach James Franklin has built a consistent winner, but <span><a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/news/college-football-week-5-storylines-early-must-win-for-alabama-vs-georgia-get-over-it-and-move-on-auburn/\" target=\"_blank\">his struggles in marquee matchups linger</a></span>. He is just 2-20 against AP Top 6 opponents, the second-worst mark by any FBS coach in history, per CBS Sports research. The Nittany Lions have dropped 14 straight against top-six foes, with their last such win coming in 2016.</p><p><strong>Oregon's hot start:</strong> The Ducks already own blowout wins over two Power Four opponents and rival Oregon State, outscoring foes 203-37. Oregon ranks top 12 nationally in both scoring offense and defense, and its three-headed rushing attack has powered one of the most balanced units in the country.</p><p><strong>Big spot for Allar:</strong> Penn State quarterback <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/players/28876938/drew-allar/\">Drew Allar</a> entered the season projected as a first-round pick but has shown uneven form. He averages just 7.1 yards per attempt and ranks 70th nationally in passing yards per game (208.7). Oregon's defense allows only 120 passing yards per contest, so the Ducks' ability to force PSU into a one-dimensional attack looms large.</p>\n<h2>  Where to watch Penn State vs. Oregon live  </h2><p><strong>Date</strong>: Saturday, Sept. 27 | <strong>Time</strong>: 7:30 p.m. ET<br />  <strong>Location</strong>: Beaver Stadium -- State College, Pennsylvania<br />  <strong>TV: </strong>NBC | <strong>Live stream: </strong><a href=\"https://www.fubo.tv/welcome/leagues/191261?irad=399332&irmp=416484&sharedid=HTW\" target=\"_blank\">Fubo</a> (Try for free)</p><h2>  Penn State vs. Oregon prediction, picks  </h2>\n<p>Oregon has been a buzzsaw through the first few weeks of the year, ranking among the most efficient teams in nearly every statistical category. According to SP+, the Ducks have the No. 2 offense, 5 defense and 4 special teams in <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://cbssports.com/college-football/\">college football</a>. For Penn State to win, quarterback Drew Allar has to spread out the defense and create opportunities against one of the best passing defenses in college football. With frustrating early returns, it's unclear whether he'll be able to do that. <strong><em>Pick: Oregon ML (+136)</em></strong></p><div><table><thead><tr><th><br /></th><th><div>\n

    "body": "<div>\n        <p>Major League Baseball's postseason will get underway on Tuesday with Game 1 of all four Wild Card Series. This, then, is the opportune time to offer a refresher on baseball's relatively new playoff format.</p><p>\"Relatively\" is a load-bearing phrase in that sentence given that this October will be the fourth under the current 12-team structure. Each league sends six clubs to the tournament: the three division winners and three wild card entries. The two division winners with the best record in each league earn a first-round bye, with the leftover teams competing in a best-of-three wild card round -- the higher seed (the remaining division winner and the wild card team with the best record) hosts each of those three games, giving them a leg up in theory.</p><ul><li><strong>Wild card round</strong>: Best-of-three series</li><li><strong>Divisional round</strong>: Best-of-five series</li><li><strong>League Championship round</strong>: Best-of-seven series</li><li><strong>World Series</strong>: Best-of-seven series between AL and NL champion</li></ul><p>After the wild card round, the playoff structure follows the more traditional pathway: a best-of-five division series, a best-of-seven championship series, and then the World Series. </p><p>Here are four other things you need to know about <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://cbssports.com/mlb/\">MLB's</a> playoffs format.</p><h2>1. Format implemented in 2022</h2><p>As noted in the introduction, this is the fourth year since MLB expanded the postseason to 12 teams as part of the Collective Bargaining Agreement with the MLB Players Association. Playoff expansion, once a rare occurrence in MLB, has become a more commonplace development.</p>\n<p>Indeed, MLB's postseason featured only the World Series until 1969. The playoffs expanded then to include the League Championship Series, but that dynamic would remain in place all the way until 1994. From then until 2011, each league sent three division winners and a wild card club to October. MLB added another playoff team in 2012, pitting two clubs in a Wild Card Game. </p><p>The playoff field remained at five teams aside, save for one exception, until 2022. That exception, naturally, was the pandemic-impacted 2020 campaign. MLB countered the 60-game season by expanding the playoff field to 16 teams overall, the most in league history.</p><h2>2. No game 163s</h2><p>MLB has had to make some trade-offs to accommodate the expanded postseason field and the longer playoff schedule. The most notable casualty was the elimination of the tiebreaker games.</p>\n<p>Game 163s didn't pop up too often -- there were six total across the majors from 2000 onward -- but when they did, the odd circumstances and amplified stakes produced some memorable tilts. For example, you likely remember the controversial ending of the 2007 affair between the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/teams/COL/colorado-rockies/\">Colorado Rockies</a> and the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/teams/SD/san-diego-padres/\">San Diego Padres</a> that determined the NL wild card entry. (The Rockies would make good on that opportunity by winning the NL pennant.)</p><p>These days, ties are determined through a series of other criteria. Those are, in order:</p><ol><li>Head-to-head record during the regular season;</li><li>Intra-division record during the regular season (even if teams don't share a division);</li><li>Inter-division record;</li><li>Team record in last half of intra-league games</li></ol><p>Most of the ties that exist these days are settled by the first matter.</p><h2>3. Lower seeds have a chance at glory</h2><p>Baseball is a game built around upsets. When a bad team beats a good team in the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://cbssports.com/nfl/\">NFL</a> or the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://cbssports.com/nba/\">NBA</a>, it's a headline; when it happens in MLB, it's just another Tuesday night. That's also true of the postseason, especially since the introduction of another short series.</p>\n<p>It's not just your imagination. Lower-seeded teams have steadily taken advantage of the new playoff format to author some surprising October runs.</p><p>In 2022, the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/teams/PHI/philadelphia-phillies/\">Philadelphia Phillies</a> entered the postseason as the lowest-seeded team on the NL side of the bracket. They went on to pull off three consecutive upsets to reach the World Series. (They were downed by the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/teams/HOU/houston-astros/\">Houston Astros</a> in six games.) In 2023, the World Series featured a No. 5 seed (the eventual champion <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/teams/TEX/texas-rangers/\">Texas Rangers</a>) and another No. 6 seed (the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/teams/ARI/arizona-diamondbacks/\">Arizona Diamondbacks</a>). Even last year, when three of the top four overall seeds reached the LCS, the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/teams/NYM/new-york-mets/\">New York Mets</a> overcame their sixth seed placement and came within two wins of claiming the pennant.</p><p>There's no way of knowing which, if any lower-seeded team will make a run this October. What history we have of this playoff format suggests there's a real chance someone does, however.</p>\n<h2>4. No automatic runner, but pitch clock remains</h2><p>MLB has made myriad rule changes in recent years, including the installation of the automatic runner in extra innings and the pitch clock. Only one of the two will be present in October.</p><p>If and when postseason games go into extra innings, teams will not be awarded a runner at second base to begin those frames. Instead of an automatic runner in scoring position, the bases will be empty, just as they are at the start of any other half-inning throughout baseball history.</p>\n            </div>"

    "body": "<div>\n        <p>The final two days of the 2025 regular season have arrived and still there is so much to be settled. Two division titles are up for grabs and two other postseason berths are undecided. It's too bad MLB did away with Game 163 tiebreakers. We could have been looking at as many as three win or home Game 163s otherwise, and even possibly a three-team tie.</p><p>Here are the four ongoing races and all the possible ways they could shake out this weekend.  </p><h2>AL East</h2><p>The <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/teams/TOR/toronto-blue-jays/\">Blue Jays</a> and <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/teams/NYY/new-york-yankees/\">Yankees</a> enter the final weekend tied atop the division at 92-68. Toronto won the season series 8-5 and holds the tiebreaker, so the Yankees must finish ahead of them to win the AL East. Here are the possible outcomes this weekend:</p><ul><li><strong>Blue Jays go 2-0:</strong> Blue Jays win AL East</li><li><strong>Blue Jays go 1-1:</strong> Yankees must go 2-0</li><li><strong>Blue Jays go 0-2:</strong> Yankees must go at least 1-1</li></ul><p>Pretty straightforward, this one. The Blue Jays are hosting the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/teams/TB/tampa-bay-rays/\">Rays</a> this weekend. The Yankees are at home taking on the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/teams/BAL/baltimore-orioles/\">Orioles</a>. Toronto can clinch the AL East (and the American League's No. 1 seed) as soon as Saturday with a win and a loss by the Yankees.</p>\n<p>It should be noted both the Blue Jays and Yankees have already clinched postseason spots. One team will win the AL East and the other will be the first wild card. This isn't a \"win the AL East or you're out\" situation. The AL East title will come with a Wild Card Series bye though, and that is extremely valuable.</p><h2>AL Central</h2><p>For most of the season, the AL Central race appeared to be a mere formality. The <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/teams/DET/detroit-tigers/\">Tigers</a> had an enormous lead, as many as 14 games on July 8, but they have crashed hard the last few weeks while the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/teams/CLE/cleveland-guardians/\">Guardians</a> have surged. They're now tied at 86-74. Cleveland won the season series 8-5, so they have the tiebreaker. Here are the possible outcomes this weekend:</p><ul><li><strong>Guardians go 2-0:</strong> Guardians win AL Central</li><li><strong>Guardians go 1-1:</strong> Tigers must go 2-0</li><li><strong>Guardians go 0-2:</strong> Tigers must go at least 1-1</li></ul><p><span><a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/news/red-sox-clinch-playoff-berth-for-first-time-since-2021-become-third-al-east-team-to-make-mlb-postseason/\" target=\"_blank\">Friday's blown lead and walk-off loss to the</a></span> <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/teams/BOS/boston-red-sox/\">Red Sox</a> was a devastating blow to Detroit. They have two more games in Boston this weekend. The Guardians are hosting the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/teams/TEX/texas-rangers/\">Rangers</a>. Cleveland can clinch the AL Central as soon as Saturday with a win and a loss by the Tigers. The AL Central runner-up will then find themselves in the race for the third wild card.</p>\n<p>If the Guardians do win the AL Central, it will be the biggest comeback in baseball history. They were 15 ½ games back on July 8. The current record is 14 games by the 1978 Yankees.</p><h2>AL wild card</h2><p>Right now, the Guardians are technically in first place in the AL Central because they have the tiebreaker, and the Tigers are sitting in the third wild card spot, one game up on the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/teams/HOU/houston-astros/\">Astros</a>. Ultimately, who wins the AL Central is irrelevant to the Astros because they lost the season series to both Cleveland (2-4) and Detroit (2-4). Houston has neither tiebreaker.</p><p>There is only one possible way for the Astros to make the postseason: They must go 2-0 this weekend while either the Guardians or Tigers go 0-2. It doesn't matter which one goes 0-2 as long as one of them goes 0-2. This is how that would shake out:</p>\n<ul><li>Astros get the third wild card spot.</li><li>AL Central team that goes 0-2 is out.</li><li>Other AL Central team wins the division.</li></ul><p>Houston is out with their next loss, or with Cleveland and Detroit each picking up one more win. And if both the Guardians and Tigers go 0-2 this weekend while the Astros go 2-0, Cleveland gets the AL Central title and the Tigers are out.</p><p>The Astros are playing the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/teams/LAA/los-angeles-angels/\">Angels</a> in Anaheim this weekend. The Tigers are in Boston and the Guardians are home against the Rangers. None of these three teams have clinched a postseason berth yet, but the Astros are at a clear disadvantage. Their backs are up against the wall.</p><h2>NL wild card</h2><p>The <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/teams/NYM/new-york-mets/\">Mets</a> are a not disastrous 5-4 in their last nine games, though the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/teams/CIN/cincinnati-reds/\">Reds</a> are 7-2 during that time, pulling them even for the third wild card spot at 82-78. Cincinnati won the season series 4-2 and has the tiebreaker. Here are the possible outcomes this weekend:</p>\n<ul><li><strong>Reds go 2-0:</strong> Reds get third wild card</li><li><strong>Reds go 1-1:</strong> Mets must go 2-0</li><li><strong>Reds go 0-2:</strong> Mets must go at least 1-1</li></ul><p>The Reds are in Milwaukee to play a <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/teams/MIL/milwaukee-brewers/\">Brewers</a> team that has already clinched the NL Central and a Wild Card Series bye. The Mets are in Miami to play the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/teams/MIA/miami-marlins/\">Marlins</a>, and the Marlins made it clear they want to spoil New York's season.</p><p>\"Win. Win. Knock them out,\" Marlins third baseman <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/players/26911671/connor-norby/\">Connor Norby</a> said Friday when asked about his goal for the weekend (via <a href=\"https://x.com/AnthonyDiComo/status/1971767398668878129\" target=\"_blank\">MLB.com</a>). \"That's a division rival. We've played well  against them all year and yeah, we want to play spoiler here. We did  it last year when I was here. We did it in Texas. We're trying to do it  again right now.\"  </p><p>New York was 45-24 on June 12, the best record in baseball. They are 37-54 since, the fifth-worst record in baseball. </p>\n            </div>"

But that victory wasn't one that came without more setbacks for Arne Slot and the squad. <span>Hugo Ekitike</span> was sent off after a moment of madness in the match. The Liverpool forward scored a winning goal, but forgetting that he was already on a yellow card, he picked up a second yellow and a dismissal, making him ineligible for the away trip to face Crystal Palace.</p><h2>How to watch Crystal Palace vs. Liverpool, odds</h2><ul><li><strong>Date</strong>: Saturday, Sep. 27 | <strong>Time</strong>: 10 a.m. ET</li><li><strong>Location</strong>: Selhurst Park -- London</li><li><strong>Live stream: </strong>Peacock</li><li><strong>Odds: </strong>Crystal Palace +300; Draw +270; Liverpool -115</li></ul><p>That creates a few opportunities around the Liverpool squad. Not only could new signing <span>Alexander Isak</span> be in line for his first Premier League start, but there's also a chance for Federico Chiesa to work his way into the rotation for Liverpool. Isak hasn't had a proper preseason due to his transfer saga with Newcastle United, so Liverpool have been bringing him along slowly, with the Swedish forward only playing 126 minutes so far this season. He started against <span>Atletico Madrid</span> in the Champions League and was able to follow that up with a half of play in the EFL Cup, scoring his first goal for the club.</p><p>Chiesa has found minutes hard to come by, but when opportunities have come, he has made the most of them. Scoring a goal against Bournemouth on the opening day of the season and now grabbing a brace of assists against Southampton, Chiesa could break out after struggling to find a role in his first season with the club. An unfortunate ACL tear for 18-year-old <span>Giovanni Leoni</span> in the EFL Cup will see him miss the remainder of the season, but it also opens space for Chiesa in the Champions League squad.</p>\n<p>Slot is still working to figure out his best XI this season, which is where performances like this one will be important. Crystal Palace have improved under Oliver Glasnar, even while losing Eberechi Eze to <span>Arsenal</span>. With Liverpool travelling away from him and then also preparing for a trip to face <span>Galatasaray</span> in Champions League play, these are moments where points will be dropped if Slot can't trust his entire squad but if opportunities lead to improvement from players like Cheisa, that'll be the route to retaining the Premier League title.</p>\n            </div>\n    </div>"
