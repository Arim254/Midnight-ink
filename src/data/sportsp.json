The Ravens are averaging 40.5 points per game this season, while the Lions dropped 52 points against the Bears in Week 2. In addition, the total has gone Over in six of Detroit's past eight games. The total has also gone Over in four of Baltimore's last five games. Ravens quarterback Lamar Jackson threw for 357 yards and three touchdowns and rushed for a score when these two teams last met in 2023. The model projects 55 combined points on Monday Night Football in a 30-25 Ravens win.</p><h2>Brewers vs. Padres Over 7 total runs (-118)</h2><p>Both teams are starting quality pitchers on Monday, but seven runs is about as low an over/under as you'll ever find on a baseball game. The Padres are starting Nick Pivetta, who is 13-5 with a 2.81 ERA on the season, but the 32-year-old allowed three runs in just 4 2/3 innings against the Mets on Wednesday. Meanwhile, the Padres are still playing meaningful baseball, as they have a shot to overtake the Dodgers atop the NL West, so they should come out aggressively. The Brewers are starting Freddy Peralta, who, although he hasn't allowed a run in five of his last seven starts, recently allowed five runs in five innings against the Rangers on Sept. 10. The model projects the Over to hit in 64% of simulations.</p><h2>Giants (-149) to defeat the Cardinals</h2><p>The Giants are coming off a 3-1 win over the Dodgers on Sunday to snap a three-game losing streak, and although neither the Giants nor the Cardinals are playing for the postseason, they are still playing out their seasons with the majority of starters. Giants pitcher Justin Verlander recently said he wants to pitch in 2026, but there's no guarantee of that, so Monday could be the final start for the Hall of Fame pitcher. Verlander has allowed just one run over his last four starts at age 42, and he has a 3.75 ERA as he still remains one of the most reliable pitchers in baseball. The model projects the Giants to win in 66% of simulations.</p><h2>Want more NFL picks and MLB picks for Monday, September 22?</h2><p><strong>You've seen the model's Monday best bets.

Ultimately, the Browns ended up nabbing Shedeur Sanders despite already selecting former Oregon signal-caller <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/3121534/dillon-gabriel/\">Dillon Gabriel</a> in the third round.</p>\n<p>Sanders is listed as the third quarterback on the Browns' depth chart behind starter <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/1250697/joe-flacco/\">Joe Flacco</a> and Gabriel. </p><p>If Sanders had landed with the Ravens, it's true he likely wouldn't have seen the field much unless Jackson suffered an injury. Jackson, 28, is firmly entrenched as the Ravens franchise quarterback and has enjoyed a tremendous amount of success since landing with Baltimore back in 2018.</p><p>In Cleveland, Sanders could have a chance to see the field much earlier considering that Flacco is 40 years old and likely won't be playing much longer. In fact, Sanders anticipates his son starting for the Browns at some point during the 2025 season. </p>\n<p>\"Be patient and be ready,\" <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/story/_/id/46348599/deion-sanders-thinks-shedeur-sanders-start-browns-25\" target=\"_blank\">the elder Sanders said</a>. \"You got to be ready when it's time.

    "body": "<div>\n        <p>Keegan Bradley becoming the first playing captain in the Ryder Cup since Arnold Palmer in 1963 was widely assumed to happen this fall at Bethpage Black, but the United States captain opted to leave himself off the playing roster as the most notable snub of the captain's picks. </p><p>There was a time after his win at the Travelers that he was in his provisional roster, but as the Ryder Cup neared he realized the responsibilities as captain would be too much to handle while also playing. Still, as the U.S. team began practice Monday to officially start of Ryder Cup week, Bradley admitted he couldn't stop thinking about what it'd be like to be playing with his guys. </p><p>\"Definitely. I've thought about it every second,\" Bradley said. \"But I've also thought about how impossible it would be. </p><p>\"Like I said earlier, I was picked to do this job as captain, and there's been certain things that I've done during the week or lead-up that if I was playing, I don't think I could have done at the level that I needed to do them at. I catch myself every now and then looking down the fairway, seeing the guys walk down the fairway and think how badly I'd like to do that, and how badly I'd want to be in the group with Scottie Scheffler and seeing him play and being his teammate.</p>\n<p>\"But I feel like I've been called for a bigger cause here, to help our guys get ready to play and play at the highest level. But in the back of my mind, I'm always thinking, 'I could have been out there.' But ultimately, I can't tell you how much I've enjoyed being the captain and how I've enjoyed not having to worry about getting to sleep and getting my rest or how I haven't had to think about what time I'm going to go practice or meet my coach and then meet the guys.

In 2024, he completed 316 of 474 attempts for 4,172 passing yards, 41 touchdowns and only four interceptions. He also rushed for 915 yards adding four rushing touchdowns, making him the first quarterback ever to exceed 4,000 passing yards <em>and</em> 900 rushing yards in a single season.</p><p>In 2025, he has thrown for 434 yards, six passing touchdowns, and zero interceptions, while registering a QBR among the top in the league thus far.

    "body": "<div>\n        <p>And so the 2024-25 Ballon d'Or is won. Can you really believe they gave it to that guy? Amid all that controversy. All the drama on the night too! Truly those are scenes we will never forget.</p><p>(Do you think they can tell I started writing all this in advance?)</p><p>The hometown favorite ultimately won the 2024-25 award, Osmane Dembele taking home the trophy thanks to his remarkable season leading the Paris Saint-Germain line as they rode to a historic treble and took home the Champions League, then finished as runners up in the inaugural FIFA Club World Cup as an encore.</p><p>There is, however, no jumping off the Ballon d'Or treadmill just yet. Indeed what better time could there be to pick this season's winner than straight after last season's prize has been awarded? We are, of course, dealing with an undersized sample of results, in fact one that is more insignificant than in 2024-25 given the World Cup looming on the horizon. If the fading of <span>Mohamed Salah's</span> candidacy taught us anything it is that the narrative of individual prizes is shaped in the spring months, no matter the records that were set up to be broken in the early parts of this season.</p><p>Of course, our men's Ballon d'Or power rankings are not in the business of predicting who might win the panel vote in September 2026, but to offer the case for who<em> should</em> be winning. That is a little bit harder to assess when we're so strapped for data. Even the most active of participants early on this season might just about have cleared the 500 minute mark. It is not a lot to go off. It is not nothing either.</p>\n<p>Add a few more predictive metrics to the list -- expected goals and assists for instance -- and we can at least take a first draft at who might be the best players in the world come the end of the season.</p><h3>1. <span>Kylian Mbappe</span>, <span>Real Madrid</span></h3><p>Whether he can keep it up over the next 10 months is an unknowable question, but right now, Kylian Mbappe has burst out of the traps at a pace few others across the sport can keep up with. Heading into last weekend, across the Champions League and Europe's big five leagues only one player averages more than the Frenchman's 6.86 shots per 90 minutes and <span>Vedat Muriqi</span> of <span>Mallorca</span> is not being as discerning in his shot selection. Mbappe wasn't just second in shots taken either, he's averaging the second most chances created per 90 too.</p><p>Add in Saturday's 2-0 win over <span>Espanyol</span> and Mbappe delivers an outstanding 0.96 non-penalty expected goals plus expected assists (npxG+xA) per 90. While his tally of seven goals is significantly swelled by penalties, it's fair to assume that we are going to be seeing plenty from other sources over the course of the season. Xabi Alonso has formatted what appears to be a very good Madrid team around Mbappe's qualities. That could lead to some quite remarkable things this season.</p>\n<h3>2. Erling Haaland, Manchester City</h3><p>Yes, the next generation of <span>Lionel Messi</span> vs. <span>Cristiano Ronaldo</span> looks like it's coming this season. If Mbappe isn't going to win it then right now it looks like Erling Haaland is his nearest rival. Much like Alonso's adjustments, Pep Guardiola has responded to his team's past adversities by designing a gameplan tailored to his star forward. Any shot not taken by Haaland, it seems, is a bad shot. That approach is working and before Thursday's game against <span>Napoli</span> he was averaging a frankly ludicrous 1.52 npxG per 90. He was underperforming that by a fair way too. He had scored five goals in four games and continued his impressive scoring form at <span>Arsenal</span> too.</p><figure><p><img alt=\"export-2025-09-21t220308-514.png\" src=\"https://sportshub.cbsistatic.com/i/r/2025/09/21/faf28692-b149-42d1-86ee-e0af53860c50/resize/670x377/b368ba87356a5a82d6d182caab4fdb3b/export-2025-09-21t220308-514.png\" /></p><figcaption><span>Shots taken by Erling Haaland in the 2025-26 Premier League and Champions League </span><span>\n                                                                    TruMedia\n                                                            </span></figcaption></figure><p>About the only worry you'd have about a Haaland Ballon d'Or candidacy is what these goals might amount to. This column is firmly of the view that individual prizes should be awarded to the best player rather than the best player on the best team, but sheer output does need to contribute to some form of winning. The risk might be that his goals only paper over so many of Manchester City's flaws elsewhere on the pitch and that come the World Cup Norway just aren't a nation who can make a big impact. Still, right now, Haaland is doing all that can be expected of him.</p><h3>3. <span>Harry Kane</span>, <span>Bayern Munich</span></h3><p>On this season's performances there is a clear top tier of three and perhaps the only question you can have of Harry Kane is whether he might belong higher than third in it. After all, he is well clear as the leading scorer in Europe's top five leagues with eight goals to his name, three of them penalties. He's ranking pretty favorably in assists too with three. At 32 Kane might be as effective a pure final third presence as he has ever been, delivering in a big Champions League game too.</p>\n<p>If we might briefly engage in some psephology, however, Kane's candidacy seems deeply tied to how his teams perform. Win the Champions League and he has a chance, but the best scenario for the veteran striker is that for once he keeps himself fit going into the summer, where he makes a positive impact for <span>England</span> at the business end of the tournament. Win the World Cup and he might just be a lock for the rankings that really count.</p><h3>4. <span>Ousmane Dembele</span>, <span>Paris</span> Saint-Germain</h3><p>The best player on the best team last season had made a bright enough start to 2025-26 before familiar injury issues caught up with Ousmane Dembele. The <span>France</span> international could be out until well into October with a hamstring issue, a reminder that for all that his brilliant form at the start of the year might have been a function of system changes and an improved squad around him, an extended run of availability was vital in the world seeing the real Dembele. </p><p>How much we can expect that from a player who has suffered eight separate hamstring issues since the start of 2019 should be one of the most significant questions over Dembele's candidacy. If one thing was apparent in that run to the Champions League title, it's that he is good enought to rank as the best player on the planet.</p>\n<h3>5. <span>Pedri</span>, <span>Barcelona</span></h3><p>If you want a sense of why Pedri is the best central midfielder in the game right now, just look at his performance in the Champions League win over Newcastle. A player who won so many admirers for the possession play of his early years can now go into a game against the hulking engine room of a top Premier League side and win more duels than anyone on the pitch. Indeed, no one in Europe's top five leagues has recovered possession more times than Pedri.</p><p>There probably needs to be a scintilla of a doubt, given that the most important and valuable thing in football is putting the ball in the net, but it really should be possible for a player of Pedri's quality to win the Ballon d'Or this season.</p><h3>6. <span>Lamine Yamal</span>, Barcelona</h3><p>If Lamine Yamal's trajectory is anything like it has been so far in his career, he will win the Ballon d'Or next season. In his second full year in the Barcelona team, the 18-year-old was irresistible, deciding some of the biggest games with a few moments of brilliance. Before his injuries the signs were that he was progressing nicely, two assists and as many goals in three games.</p>\n<figure><p><img alt=\"export-2025-09-21t220958-289.png\" src=\"https://sportshub.cbsistatic.com/i/r/2025/09/21/8705355b-9142-4bf6-bc6f-64fe686b3ee8/resize/670x377/caff3a4b5b708fe607293794757bb33c/export-2025-09-21t220958-289.png\" /></p><figcaption><span>Shots taken by Lamine Yamal in the 2025-26 La Liga season </span><span>\n                                                                    TruMedia\n                                                            </span></figcaption></figure><p>A note of caution, however. You may remember that we noted the remarkable number of shots per 90 minutes that Mbappe was averaging. At six and two thirds, Yamal is not far behind. It's just that a few too many of them are really rather bad. An average of 0.08 xG per shot is at the very least a coaching moment. Few players are more likely to stick bad shots in the top bins like Yamal is, but if he can wait a little longer to get into prime spots, he will doubtless buttress his case for individual glory.</p><h3>7. <span>Raphinha</span>, Barcelona</h3><p>This season there seems a distinct possibility that Barcelona's two wing wonders split each others votes and that that is why Raphinha, who matched Cristiano Ronaldo's record for goal involvements in a Champions League campaign, didn't really get that close to the winner. The same might happen this season but on his current form Raphinha could well emerge as a worthy winner. The Brazilian is on three assists and two goals through five La Liga games and showed in Thursday's win over Newcastle that he could be almost as effective off the right as he is the left.</p><h3>8. <span>Michael Olise</span>, Bayern Munich</h3><p>Is Michael Olise taking<em> the leap?</em> Maybe the best argument against that question is that the 23-year-old actually took it last season when he delivered 27 combined goals and assists in the Bundesliga. He has certainly picked up where he left off, giving Marc <span>Cucurella</span> a torrid time in the Champions League and delivering a host of goals in domestic play, where his npxG+xA is a ludicrous 1.1 per 90.</p>\n<p>For Olise, as well as every other Bayern Munich and PSG player on this list, that output probably needs to transfer into the European game for it to feel like more than empty calories. That or the World Cup. Given that Didier Deschamps has trusted Olise in a central attacking role for France, that could be eminently plausible.</p><h3>9. <span>Khvicha Kvaratskhelia</span>, Paris Saint-Germain</h3><p>Take your pick of PSG players to add to this list. It might be <span>Vitinha</span>, the star man in a midfield full of hyper talent, or perhaps <span>Desire Doue</span> takes another leap forward. The most obvious candidate, however, is Khvicha Kvaratskhelia, who spent most of last season very clearly proving that he makes significant contributions to winning teams. He would probably need to step up and lead an attack in Dembele's absence but everything we know about the former Napoli man is that is something he has no trouble doing.</p><p>A relatively limited run of minutes in Ligue 1 means Kvaratskhelia has ground to make up early on and there's perhaps an argument to be made that the early season returns haven't been enough for the brilliant Georgian. Consider this then, to be a guarantee of brilliance to come. Anyway they'll have to pry these power rankings from my cold dead fingers before I don't make room for Kvaradona.</p>\n<h3>10. Mohamed Salah, <span>Liverpool</span></h3><p><span><a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/soccer/news/ballon-dor-power-rankings-cole-palmer-on-the-rise-but-still-behind-mohamed-salah-lamine-yamal-and-more/\" target=\"_blank\">By dint of being this column's pick of the best player in men's football last season,</a></span> Mohamed Salah keeps his place in the top 10 for the time being. He has earned the right to ease his way into a campaign that will see him jam an Africa Cup of Nations and, in all likelihood, a World Cup around his Liverpool commitments. It would, however, be disingenuous to suggest that there haven't been signs of a dip from the 33-year-old, who eased up in 2024-25 when it became apparent there were no more trophies for him to win.</p><p>Salah's npxG has gone from 0.49 per 90 to 0.09 in the Premier League, his xA from 0.24 to 0.14. Not all of that can be explained by the improvement of his supporting cast. He is a player with over 500 games in the top five leagues and European competitions, who has just signed a lucrative new contract. We know what can happen to that sort of player. For those of Salah's talent it is better to be too late than too early in labelling this a decline moment, but if we were looking for signs of the drop starting, this is what we might be seeing.</p>\n            </div>"

Washington coach Dan Quinn said Monday that he would provide another update on Wednesday as the team charts out a practice plan for Daniels, who sustained the injury during Washington's Week 2 loss to the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/GB/green-bay-packers/\">Packers</a>. </p><p>Daniels has not practiced since his injury.</p><p>Quinn added that <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/1880862/marcus-mariotas/\">Marcus Mariota's</a> solid performance against Las Vegas gives Washington more time as it relates to Daniels and his recovery.

He also has two playoff starts under his belt that includes a win over the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/KC/kansas-city-chiefs/\">Chiefs</a> in the 2017 AFC wild card round as a member of the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/TEN/tennessee-titans/\">Titans</a>. </p>\n<p>Whoever is quarterback this Sunday for the Commanders will face a <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/ATL/atlanta-falcons/\">Falcons</a> defense that is has allowed the fewest passing yards in the NFL through three weeks.

During Sunday's action, there were NINE non-offensive touchdowns scored. If you're wondering how that happened, here's the breakdown: </p><ul><li>Four pick sixes</li><li>Two blocked field goals returned for a touchdown</li><li>Two punt return touchdowns</li><li>One fumble return TD</li></ul><p>This marks the first time in NFL history where there has been at least two blocked field goals returned for a touchdown, at least two punt return touchdowns and at least two pick sixes all on the same day. </p><p>One of those blocked field goals came in Cleveland, where the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/CLE/cleveland-browns/\">Browns</a> pulled off the most stunning win of the day with a 13-10 upset win over the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/GB/green-bay-packers/\">Green Bay Packers</a>. </p>\n<p>With that in mind, let's get to the Week 3 grades, starting with the Lions' huge win over the Ravens on Monday night. </p><h2>Detroit 38-30 Baltimore (Monday)</h2><h2>Cleveland 13-10 over Green Bay</h2><h2>Kansas City 22-9 over N.Y.
