The Mets were outscored despite winning the series, with Chicago averaging 7.3 runs per game with all three contests going Over their totals. The Mets and Cubs averaged 14 total runs per game, and the model expects that trend to continue on Friday with New York both scoring and allowing runs. Francisco Lindor has three home runs over the last six games, with Juan Soto and Francisco Alvarez both adding two homers during that span as well. Brandon Sproat is making just his fourth career start for the Mets, who are fighting to hold onto the final Wild Card spot in the National League playoffs, and the 25-year-old makes the high-pressure start after allowing four runs over four innings against the Nationals on Friday. The Marlins are starting Sandy Alcantara, who has a 5.48 ERA as one of the most inconsistent pitchers in baseball. The model projects the Over to hit in 54% of simulations.</p><h2>Florida State vs. Virginia Under 60.5 total points (-110)</h2><p>Florida State has the No. 3 scoring offense (48.5 points per game), while Virginia ranks 13th (42.3 ppg) in scoring this season. However, most of their offensive success has come against inferior opponents. The Seminoles play their ACC opener on Friday, while Virginia plays just its second conference contest. The Seminoles opened the season with a massive upset with a 31-17 victory over Alabama, finishing below this total. Florida State and Virginia have gone Under this total in each of their last 13 head-to-head meetings, and the model projects the Under to hit in 66% of simulations.</p><h2>TCU (+3) vs. Arizona State (-115)</h2><p>TCU climbed up to No. 24 in the nation after its 35-24 victory over SMU on Saturday. The Horned Frogs have the No. 15 scoring offense (41.5 ppg), led by experienced quarterback Josh Hoover. The junior and three-year starter for TCU has 1,000 passing yards with 11 touchdowns compared to two interceptions through three games, and he's coming off throwing for 379 yards and five touchdowns against SMU last week. He threw for nearly 4,000 yards (3,949) last season. TCU also has a strong defense, ranking 32nd in scoring defense at 19 ppg. The model projects TCU to cover the spread in 62% of simulations.</p><h2>Want more MLB picks and NFL picks for Friday, September 26?</h2><p><strong>You've seen the model's Friday best bets.

    "body": "<div>\n        <p><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/wnba/teams/MIN/minnesota-lynx/\">Minnesota Lynx</a> coach Cheryl Reeve was ejected with under 22 seconds remaining in Game 3 against the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/wnba/teams/PHO/phoenix-mercury/\">Phoenix Mercury</a> after a no-call when Lynx star <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/wnba/players/26677824/napheesa-collier/\">Napheesa Collier</a> hit the floor hard and headed to the locker room with an apparent leg injury.</p><p>With 28 seconds to go, Collier inbounded the ball to <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/wnba/players/26677887/natisha-hiedeman/\">Natisha Hiedeman</a>, who threw it back to Collier at the top of the key. But Mercury forward <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/wnba/players/2130768/alyssa-thomas/\">Alyssa Thomas</a> stole the ball, knocking Collier over in the process. Thomas then ran to the opposite side of the court and made the last field goal of the night uncontested. When Collier didn't get up, Reeve went on the court and had to be held back by Hiedeman and members of the Minnesota staff. </p>\n<p>Collier first headed to the bench and was seen crying before she was helped to the locker room. She finished the night with 17 points, but none in the fourth quarter. There is still no official update on her exact injury or her availability for the rest of the playoffs.</p><p>It was a physical game just like the rest of the series and tensions were high. Reeve got a technical in the second quarter for arguing with officials after she felt Collier had been fouled multiple times in a possession. </p>\n<p>After the game, Reeve was still upset and called for a change in WNBA leadership for allowing what she considered a dangerous level of physicality in the playoffs. She also pointed out that Collier got called for fouls but did not go to the free throw line at all on Friday.</p><p>\"One of the best players in the league shot zero free throws. Zero. And she had five fouls. Zero free throws. Got her shoulder pulled out and finished the game with her leg being taken out and probably has a fracture,\" Reeve said. \"And so if this is what our league wants, okay, but I want to call for a change of leadership at the league level when it comes to officiating. It's bad for the game. The officiating crew that we had tonight, for the leadership to deem those three people semifinals playoffs worthy is f—g malpractice.</p><p>\"I can take an L with the best of them. I don't think we should have to play through more than what they did.... They're f—g awful.\"</p>\n<p>Friday night ended in an 84-76 win for the Mercury, who now have a 2-1 lead in the best-of-five semifinal series. They found momentum in the second quarter with <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/wnba/players/26677851/kahleah-copper/\">Kahleah Copper</a> scoring their last nine points before the break. She finished the first half with 17 points, which she attributed to watching film from Game 2 and realizing she needed to be more aggressive.</p><p>Copper got a technical foul during the third quarter, but she said Thomas talked to her and the rest of the team in the huddle about the importance of staying composed and locked in. She followed that advice and finished the night with 21 points, as did Thomas. Meanwhile, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/wnba/players/26677941/satou-sabally/\">Satou Sabally</a> led the winning offense with 23 points. </p><p>\"We know it's going to be a tough series,\" Thomas told reporters after the game. \"That's what playoff basketball is all about. I think for us in the moment, we always talk about never getting too high, never getting too low. You know, it's a game of runs. They go on one, we go on one. It's just about doing the little things. So we just try to stay composed in those moments. And we're built for this.\"</p>\n<p>Despite the Mercury heating up before halftime, the Lynx made things more difficult for them in the third quarter by tightening up their interior defense and winning those 10 minutes 23-15. Hiedeman did not have a single field goal attempt during Game 2, but she was one of the top contributors for Minnesota on Friday with 19 points off the bench. Unfortunately for the Lynx, Hiedeman was held scoreless in the last quarter while Minnesota got outscored 21-9.</p><p>\"That's really due to our good defense,\" Sabally said in press when asked about the Lynx's low-scoring fourth quarter. \"We closed them out. We knew what they were running, so we're really well prepared and just trust each other. (<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/wnba/players/1201037/dewanna-bonner/\">DeWanna Bonner</a>) had some great rebounds, (Copper) came in flying, it was just really amazing to see how we all work together.\"</p><p>The Mercury will once again host Game 4 on Sunday at 8 p.m. ET.</p>\n            </div>"

A furious Reeve called for \"change in leadership at the league level when it comes to officiating\" and deemed the referee assignment for the contest \"f---ing malpractice.\"</p><p>With under 30 seconds to play and the Mercury clinging to a four-point lead, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/wnba/players/2130768/alyssa-thomas/\">Alyssa Thomas</a> stole the ball from <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/wnba/players/26677824/napheesa-collier/\">Napheesa Collier</a> and wiped out the Lynx star in the process. As Thomas took the ball the length of the court for a game-sealing layup, Collier lay on the ground in agony with an apparent lower leg injury.</p><p>No foul was called on the play, and Reeve, who had already received a technical foul earlier in the game, went ballistic. She started screaming at the officials and had to be held back by players and assistant coaches.  </p>\n<p>When she arrived at the postgame podium, she was still steaming and let out more anger. Here are her comments in full:</p><blockquote><p>\"We talked about how dangerous it can be. You're hearing it from the other series, you're hearing it from other coaches, you're hearing [<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/wnba/teams/LVA/las-vegas-aces/\">Las Vegas Aces</a> coach] Becky [Hammon] talk about, when you let the physicality happen, people get hurt, there's fights. And this is the look that our league wants, for some reason. </p><p>\"We were trying to play through it, we were trying not to make excuses. One of the best players in the league shot zero free throws. Zero. And she had five fouls. Zero free throws. Got her shoulder pulled out and finished the game with her leg being taken out, and probably has a fracture. </p><p>\"And so this is what our league wants. OK, but I want to call for a change in leadership at the league level when it comes to officiating. It's bad for the game. The officiating crew that we had tonight, for the leadership to deem those three people semifinals playoff worthy is f---ing malpractice. I can take an L with the best of them. I don't think we should have to play through more than what they did. We've got players -- [<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/wnba/players/26678058/maria-kliundikova/\">Maria Kliundikova's</a>] on the glass, gets f---ing cracked and there's no call. And all of them say, 'It wasn't my call. I don't know. I didn't see it that way.' They're f---ing awful.\" </p></blockquote>\n<p>Collier's status remains unclear. Thomas crashed into her left knee and her left ankle rolled severely. Earlier in the season, Collier missed just over three weeks with a right ankle sprain.

I am very well prepared and I trained very good so I should be ready for this fight,\" Pereira said. \"Honestly, I was about 40% in that fight on that night.

That disparity stuck out to Lanning as a potential advantage to Penn State and a jab from the league office at his Ducks.</p><p>\"We're traveling 15,000 miles this year, and we play seven teams that have more prep time than we do,\" <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.johncanzano.com/p/canzano-boots-on-the-ground-in-happy\">Lanning said to John Canzano</a>. \"That's unique, isn't it? It's almost like they didn't want us in the Big Ten, or something, right? We snuck our way in, didn't we?\"</p><p>Six of the seven teams Lanning referenced as having more preparation time are Big Ten opponents. <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/teams/NWEST/northwestern-wildcats/\">Northwestern</a> and <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/teams/RUT/rutgers-scarlet-knights/\">Rutgers</a> both had or have Friday games the week before playing Oregon, giving them an additional day. <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/teams/IND/indiana-hoosiers/\">Indiana</a>, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/teams/IOWA/iowa-hawkeyes/\">Iowa</a>, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/teams/MINN/minnesota-golden-gophers/\">Minnesota</a> and Penn State each have the luxury of full bye weeks prior to their matchups with the Ducks. The seventh team was a non-conference opponent in <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/teams/OKLAST/oklahoma-state-cowboys/\">Oklahoma State</a>, which played a Thursday game prior to its trip to Eugene.</p>\n<a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/news/college-football-playoff-race-2025-penn-state-vs-oregon-alabama-vs-georgia-lead-monster-week-5-schedule/\" target=\"_blank\">\n        <div>\n            <div>\n                <p>College Football Playoff race 2025: Penn State vs. Oregon, Alabama vs. Georgia lead monster Week 5 schedule</p>\n                <p>\n                    Will Backus                </p>\n            </div>\n                            <div>\n    <figure><img alt=\"College Football Playoff race 2025: Penn State vs. Oregon, Alabama vs. Georgia lead monster Week 5 schedule\" src=\"https://sportshub.cbsistatic.com/i/r/2025/09/24/18d9bcc4-9360-47b3-8cf0-49ebd32b6dca/thumbnail/270x152/03ead9855f7576483c8e66edb065ccde/adobe-express-file-4.jpg\" /></figure>\n                </div>\n                    </div>\n    </a>\n<p>But this is not an Oregon-specific outlier and it is, frankly, part of what the Ducks signed up for when they joined the Big Ten. For instance, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/teams/WASH/washington-huskies/\">Washington</a> faces five Big Ten teams on the heels of bye weeks this season. It is all part of the conference's plan to mitigate the impacts of cross-country travel, which also affects the teams that have to fly to Eugene, Seattle and Los Angeles -- not just the Ducks.</p><p>Lanning's frustration is similar to Riley's. The USC coach led his No. 21-ranked Trojans into battle last week at 8 p.m. PT, giving him a short turnaround before this week's noon ET kickoff at No. 23 <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/teams/ILL/illinois-fighting-illini/\">Illinois</a>.</p><p>\"Going from the absolute latest kick in the country to the absolute earliest kick in the country has its challenges,\" Riley said. \"But the challenges -- like, it is what it is. We don't make the schedule, clearly.\"</p>\n<p>Is the Big Ten doing its newest members a disservice, or is this just the cost of doing business in a conference that spans from coast to coast? Lanning and Riley seem to think it is the former.</p>\n            </div>"

Both teams were shaky on Sunday but fortunate to come away with victories, although at least Philadelphia had the excuse of playing a good team in the Rams. With each being 3-0 and prohibitive division favorites, I wouldn't be surprised to see this matchup again come January.

    "body": "<div>\n        <p>The hype was already building for the first top-10 battle between Miami and Florida State in over a decade as the No. 8 Seminoles traveled to play Virginia on Friday night. All they had to do was get past a UVa team that hadn't beaten a top-10 opponent at home in 30 years and the stage would be set.</p><p>Unbeaten Miami would be traveling to take on unbeaten Florida State next week in a rivalry showdown that would be the talk of college football. After all, the last time Miami and FSU met in a top-10 matchup, FSU used its win over the Hurricanes as a springboard on its way to the 2013 BCS national title.</p><p>But if anyone from the ACC is going to contend for the national championship this season, it will be Miami. </p><p>While Florida State's <span><a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/\" target=\"_blank\">stunning 46-38 loss</a></span> to Virginia on Friday night didn't completely disqualify the 'Noles from College Football Playoff contention, it recalibrated expectations for a team that saw its stock soar following a Week 1 upset win over Alabama. </p>\n<p>Florida State may be light-years better than it was last season, when it finished 2-10. But it proved against Virginia that it's not as great as its stunning upset of the Crimson Tide suggested.</p><p>That's bad news for the the ACC, which is down to one legitimate national-title contender before the end of September.</p><p>It's also bad news for college football, which could have benefitted from the nostalgia provoked by a week of anticipation leading up to a top-10 showdown between Miami and Florida State. Next week's game at FSU's Doak Campbell Stadium will still be significant, but Florida State's loss to Virginia reduces the buzz. </p>\n<p>FSU can reclaim some momentum by beating Miami next week, but such an outcome would only further muddy the ACC's aspirations of winning its first national championship since 2018.</p><p>An ACC defender could try to spin Virginia's victory over the Seminoles as some form of evidence that the league is deep. But what conference with depth goes 1-7 in head-to-head matchups with the Big 12? That's what the ACC did over the season's first month.</p><p>In nonconference games against all Power Four programs and Notre Dame, the ACC is just 5-13. Miami accounts for two of those wins. Yet for all of its warts, it appeared the league had established a strong upper tier consisting of Miami, Florida State and Georgia Tech.</p>\n<p>The three were each unbeaten entering Week 5 and had combined to go 4-0 against Power Four teams in nonconference play. To a lesser degree, the ACC looked like it was building a premier tier similar to what the Big Ten established last season with Ohio State, Oregon and Penn State.</p><p>But teams in a \"premier\" tier can't be losing in September to programs like Virginia.</p><p>Miami sits at +1500 to win the national championship entering Saturday's action, per <span><a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/betting/news/fanduel-promo-code/\" target=\"_blank\">FanDuel Sportsbook</a></span>. Next from the ACC is Georgia Tech at +10000 (100-to-1), followed by Florida State, which is down to +12500 after Friday's loss.</p>\n<p>In defense of Florida State, the Seminoles were never expected to carry the banner for the ACC in 2025. That job was supposed to be up to Clemson and, to a lesser degree, Miami. For an FSU team coming off a historically bad 2024 season, a mere return to respectability was a more plausible goal than a return to the 13-win trajectory of the program's 2023 squad.</p><p>But when FSU beat Alabama in Week 1 and Clemson lost to LSU, the outlook changed. Clemson's subsequent struggles confirmed the Tigers wouldn't be a part of the national-title picture this season</p><p>Florida State, though? The 'Noles were back as you can get after taking down the Crimson Tide. Now, it's clear they aren't as back as we initially thought.</p>\n<p>That's a tough reality for the ACC to stomach.</p>\n            </div>"

    "body": "<div>\n        <p>FARMINGDALE, N.Y. -- The expletives were not exclusive to the New York gallery. As members of the United States and Europe Ryder Cup teams walked off the 14th green, the sun beginning to crest the hilltop on which they stood. The start of the descent -- both literal and figurative -- was beginning to near; the U.S. had dug itself into another early hole at the Ryder Cup, and the Americans were doing damn near everything to claw their way out.</p><p>In a pivotal match that slammed the door shut on any thought of an evening red wave, Bryson DeChambeau and Tommy Fleetwood eyed birdie putts from varying lengths. Waving his sword up in the air as if he had just slayed the dragon, DeChambeau's effort from 45 feet fell shy giving the normally soft-spoken Fleetwood a chance to rid the oxygen in his lungs. </p><p>\"Motherf---er\", said DeChambeau -- under his breath to himself -- as he stormed down the slope.</p><p>The same word was soon uttered to the pair of Englishmen from outside the ropes as they held each other close, voicing words of encouragement in one another's ear. Fleetwood and Justin Rose walked ahead with their first lead of the match, all other noise silenced by the bond of the two countrymen.</p>\n<p>\"I felt like I put the ball in play nicely off the tee,\" Rose said, \"but Tommy made some huge putts in the right moments, and you know, that was a huge turnaround match.\"</p><p>On the shoulders of a dominating 3 to 1 morning foursomes session victory, <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/golf/news/ryder-cup-2025-live-updates-results-scores-standings-day-1/live/\" target=\"_blank\">Europe takes a 5.5 to 2.5 lead into Day 2</a> on Saturday. The performance marks the first time since 2004 that Europe has led stateside after the first day of competition at the Ryder Cup, the first time in foursomes since 1999.</p><p>The contributions came from a wide array of players but centered around the three men Europe expected to carry the load: Rory McIlroy, Jon Rahm and Fleetwood combined for 4.5 points (four wins, no losses, one tie) as McIlroy missed a chance on the last hole of his afternoon fourballs match to make the trio perfect on the day.</p>\n<p>\"It was great,\" McIlroy said. \"Absolute honor to partner with [Shane Lowry] again and get out there. You know, we got a half a point. Obviously right now, disappointed I didn't hole out for a full point, but it's been a great day for Europe. We have come out of the gates really strong like we wanted to. Yeah, we should be really proud of ourselves.\"</p><p>None of it ever seemed forced from the side that donned powder blue. The day came to them as if they knew what the future had in store. Captain Luke Donald waltzed between his players' pivotal matches like a man who had done it a time or two ... because he has ... and won. Backed by continuity and a togetherness an away Ryder Cup experience can conjure even more than one in front of one's own crowd, the away team exposed the United States' bag of tricks and all captain Keegan Bradley attempted to manufacture.</p><p>Theatrics on the first hole were a sight to behold throughout the day -- an emcee hoping to hype up the sleepy early morning crowd, DeChambeau's drives and his partnership with fellow spark plug Justin Thomas to kick off the event, or the President of the United States showing up in the afternoon.</p>\n<p>\"We just had the President fly over in his Air Force One,\" Bradley said as the morning session was wrapping up. \"So, I've got a feeling things are going to turn here.\"</p><p>None of it felt real, though. None of it was authentic.</p><p>Friday at the Ryder Cup was a show by the Americans, a performance lacking in substance.</p><p>The United States' fiery opening act came down in flames at the hands of Rahm and Tyrrell Hatton. The U.S. leader, Scottie Scheffler, was misused, teeing off even holes instead of the odds in a head-scratching maneuver. Scheffler became the first world No. 1 since Tiger Woods in 2002 to go winless across two matches on Friday at a Ryder Cup. DeChambeau mirrored that record (0-2-0).</p>\n<p>\"Experience was great,\" DeChambeau said. \"0-2 today, pretty disappointed. I played good golf, just not good enough, and they made everything. Luck is on their side right now.\"</p><p>Collin Morikawa and Harris English were paired together -- a team which <a href=\"https://x.com/DanielHussey2/status/1971584316640764279\" target=\"_blank\">Data Golf rates 132 out of 132</a> in their optimal U.S. foursomes pairings -- only to receive a stern thumping from the hands of McIlroy and Fleetwood. Rookies, who all ranked inside the top five in terms of strokes gained the last three months, were sat in the morning in lieu of experience, which ironically is what the day ultimately turned into.</p><p>\"We have a plan of what we're going to do,\" Bradley said. \"They beat us today, but you know, we're really comfortable with our plan. We're really comfortable with [Morikawa and English]. Excited who they are playing tomorrow. Will be an exciting match, and we're sticking to our plan. We're not going to panic. We're not going to panic and make those sort of mistakes. We're going to stick to what we know. We have a lot of confidence in them.\"</p>\n<p>The Americans scored just four points compared to 18 for the Europeans out of the three morning foursomes matches the U.S. lost. The blue and gold held the lead for the vast majority of the opening run with the red, white and blue effort coming almost exclusively from Patrick Cantlay and Xander Schauffele in the anchor match. The teams of Scheffler and Henley plus Morikawa and English never held a lead.</p><p>Chants were rarely <em>for</em> the U.S.; rather, they were <em>against</em> the Europeans. The loudest roar of the morning came from just off the ninth fairway as the first match was passing through. A countdown filled the air as Thomas took to his approach shot. </p><p><em>Five … four … three … two … one … </em></p><p>The fans were not counting down the ball that was about to be sent in the air but rather the clock striking 9 a.m., signaling the start of alcohol sales two hours after the Ryder Cup began. While that may have aided the New York faithful in turning up their enthusiasm, unfortunately, their hometown boys never followed suit.</p>\n            </div>"

    "body": "<div>\n        <p>As the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://cbssports.com/nba/\">NBA</a> continues to grow its presence overseas, commissioner Adam Silver outlined a bold vision for the future that could see teams from other continents playing United States-based franchises in the regular season or postseason. In addition to its grassroots efforts in Europe and Africa and its NBA Global Games series, the NBA is in the process of launching a new league in Europe that <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://apnews.com/article/nba-europe-adam-silver-2931fede9c26195254d56f3e0a7d872f?utm_source=copy&utm_medium=share\">could begin play in 2027 or 2028</a>. And it may not be long before international play pits European squads against existing American teams.</p><p>Silver envisions tinkering with the NBA Cup or perhaps the NBA playoffs to begin introducing international teams into the league's schedule. From there, regular-season play across borders could be a feasible next step.</p><p>\"We have something we call the NBA Cup, a midseason tournament,\" <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://x.com/MikeVorkunov/status/1971640262201110567\">Silver said at the Bloomberg Philanthropies Global Forum</a>. \"You could imagine teams from Europe, potentially Africa, competing in that tournament. You possibly could see teams coming into our playoffs, top seeds from other leagues.\"</p><p>The European league could pull existing successful clubs to build its membership. Silver this summer reportedly met with Real Madrid about potentially joining the league, and the interest may be mutual given the club's foray into American sports with its agreement to host an <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://cbssports.com/nfl/\">NFL</a> game this season.</p><a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nba/news/nba-commissioner-adam-silver-meets-with-real-madrid-about-potential-european-league-membership-per-report/\" target=\"_blank\">\n        <div>\n            <div>\n                <p>NBA commissioner Adam Silver meets with Real Madrid about potential European league membership, per report</p>\n                <p>\n                    Austin Nivison                </p>\n            </div>\n                            <div>\n    <figure><img alt=\"NBA commissioner Adam Silver meets with Real Madrid about potential European league membership, per report\" src=\"https://sportshub.cbsistatic.com/i/r/2025/07/31/9e73383f-e0f7-4f11-9827-926db9c50aac/thumbnail/270x152/96194ad6ae36527f58263c333e367406/gettyimages-2218126192-2.jpg\" /></figure>\n                </div>\n                    </div>\n    </a>\n<p>Basketball's rapid growth in Europe and the massive influx of European talent into the NBA in recent years indicate the potential for the proposed league to find immense success.</p>\n<p>\"Over time, certainly in Europe, as plane travel gets faster … when I think of the flight from New York to L.A. for example, there's no reason if we had 14 teams in Europe you couldn't travel, play the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nba/teams/NY/new-york-knicks/\">Knicks</a> or <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nba/teams/BKN/brooklyn-nets/\">Nets</a>, travel to London, play three, four times in Europe, come back home,\" Silver said. \"I think it's very doable in our league.\"</p><p>Crossing international borders for regular-season play is not a novel idea for the NBA given that the NBA Global Games series has sent teams to Japan, Mexico, England and France for decades. Germany is set to join the mix this season when it hosts the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nba/teams/MEM/memphis-grizzlies/\">Memphis Grizzlies</a> and <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nba/teams/ORL/orlando-magic/\">Orlando Magic</a> on Jan. 15, 2026. But the idea of playing meaningful games against teams from those countries and beyond is brand new.</p><p>The push toward international play is an emphasis for Silver, who earlier this year said the NBA has its sights set on a new All-Star Game format that features a more nationalistic flair somewhat akin to what the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://cbssports.com/nhl/\">NHL</a> debuted last year with the 4 Nations Face-Off.</p>\n<p>\"I don't think a straight-up USA vs. World makes sense, but of course that's not what they did in the NHL either,\" <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nba/news/2026-nba-all-star-game-will-be-an-afternoon-event-that-leans-into-nationalism-adam-silver-says/\">Silver said this summer</a>. \"I think there'd probably be some different teams we form, but, whether it's some regional basis for how we combine certain groups of players -- because USA players, I talked about [this] earlier, that international is 30% of the league, American players are still 70% of the league. So I think we can play off that nationalism.\"</p>\n            </div>"

    "body": "<div>\n        <p>The <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nhl/teams/FLA/florida-panthers/\">Florida Panthers</a> could potentially be without captain <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nhl/players/2076014/aleksander-barkov/\">Aleksander Barkov</a> for the entire 2025-26 season after he suffered a torn ACL. Barkov underwent surgery after suffering the injury in the early stages of training camp and is expected to miss seven to nine months. </p><p>During Panthers' practice Tuesday, Barkov was working one-on-one against defenseman <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nhl/players/2879985/niko-mikkola/\">Niko Mikkola</a> when he went down awkwardly. Barkov's right leg got bent underneath him, and he was unable to put any weight on it as he was helped off the ice by members of the training staff.</p>\n<p>After further evaluation, Barkov underwent surgery Friday, Panthers coach Paul Maurice told reporters. Later that day, a press release from the Panthers organization confirmed an expected timeline for Barkov's return.</p><p>\"Today, [Barkov] underwent successful surgery by Dr. John Uribe at Baptist Health Doctors Hospital,\" the release read. \"He will be re-evaluated on an ongoing basis. The expected recovery timeline for these injuries is 7 to 9 months.\"</p><p>Barkov, arguably the best two-way center in the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://cbssports.com/nhl/\">NHL</a>, has led the Panthers to consecutive Stanley Cup championships. It would be an understatement to say that his absence hurts the team's chances of a three-peat this upcoming season.</p>\n<p>A three-time Selke Trophy winner as the best defensive forward in the league, Barkov routinely thrives against the opponents' best players, something that has been a major advantage for Florida in its last few playoff runs. Last season, Barkov posted an expected goals share of 58.4% and a goal differential of plus-13 at five-on-five, per Natural Stat Trick. Considering the quality of competition, those numbers are absurd, and the list of players who could match them is quite small.</p><p>While Barkov makes his hay as an elite defensive forward, he doesn't lack for offense either. He's eclipsed 70 points in each of the last four seasons, and Barkov has surpassed 80 points twice. There's simply no one better at playing 200-foot hockey than Barkov.</p><a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nhl/news/panthers-star-matthew-tkachuk-likely-out-until-at-least-december-after-undergoing-surgery-per-gm-bill-zito/\" target=\"_blank\">\n        <div>\n            <div>\n                <p>Panthers star Matthew Tkachuk likely out until at least December after undergoing surgery, per GM Bill Zito</p>\n                <p>\n                    Zachary Pereles                </p>\n            </div>\n                            <div>\n    <figure><img alt=\"Panthers star Matthew Tkachuk likely out until at least December after undergoing surgery, per GM Bill Zito\" src=\"https://sportshub.cbsistatic.com/i/r/2025/09/17/a84409ac-7df3-416e-9f67-18be9c9bb2a5/thumbnail/270x152/c3fdc0b27da839ab061d6fcdd634f3ee/matthew-tkachuk.jpg\" /></figure>\n                </div>\n                    </div>\n    </a>\n<p>The loss of Barkov is a double whammy for Florida, which is already <span><a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nhl/news/panthers-star-matthew-tkachuk-likely-out-until-at-least-december-after-undergoing-surgery-per-gm-bill-zito/\" target=\"_blank\">going to be without star winger Matthew Tkachuk</a></span> as he recovers from offseason surgery to repair a lower-body injury. Without Barkov and Tkachuk, two captains and impact players on the ice, the Panthers will have to do all they can to stay afloat until the latter returns from injury.</p>\n<p>If any team has the depth to overcome these two losses, it's the Panthers. They still have 2025 Conn Smythe Trophy winner <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nhl/players/2147081/sam-bennett/\">Sam Bennett</a> and <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nhl/players/26603189/anton-lundell/\">Anton Lundell</a> down the middle.

Assuming Barkov and Tkachuk will be placed on long-term injured reserve, general manager Bill Zito will have a lot of salary cap room with which to maneuver as well, and he's never shied away from big swings in the past.</p>\n            </div>"

    "body": "<div>\n        <p>It hasn't been a great start to the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://cbssports.com/nfl/\">NFL</a> season for <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/CIN/cincinnati-bengals/\">Cincinnati Bengals</a> wideout <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/2809208/tee-higgins/\">Tee Higgins</a>. Through three games, Higgins has only seven catches for 104 yards and a touchdown, but he says he's not worried about the slow start ahead of Cincinnati's Week 4 game against the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/DEN/denver-broncos/\">Denver Broncos</a>.</p><p>\"Personally, I feel like I've been playing well, I just haven't had a lot of opportunities,\" Chase told reporters Friday. \"Obviously, everybody in the receiver room hasn't had a lot of opportunities. So, I'm just looking forward to it.\"</p><p>Cincinnati is still reeling from likely losing superstar quarterback <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/2179798/joe-burrow/\">Joe Burrow</a> for the season after surgery was required after suffering a grade-three turf toe injury in Week 2. After winning their first two games, the Bengals were thrashed by the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/MIN/minnesota-vikings/\">Vikings</a> in Week 3, losing 48-10 with just 140 passing yards. Higgins did not have a reception in the game.</p><p>With <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/2180355/jake-browning/\">Jake Browning</a> now under center, Higgins stressed the importance of getting himself and fellow wide receiver <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/2966320/jamarr-chase/\">Ja'Marr Chase</a> going early in the game to build momentum.</p>\n<p>\"I feel like it's very important to get us going, just get our feet wet,\" Higgins said. \"I feel like once we get going, the whole team is just amped and ready to go.\"</p>\n<p>Chase, who has 21 catches for 241 yards and one touchdown on the young season, spoke about Higgins' slow start during a press conference Friday and offered a simple solution.</p><p>\"I've always told him, if he wants the ball, go f---ing ask for it,\" Chase said.</p>\n<p>Chase's idea may have some merit, especially considering Higgins' lack of production can be directly traced to just 14 targets on the season. While Chase has three times Higgins' reception total on the season, when Higgins catches the ball, he averages 14.9 yards to Chase's 11.5.</p><p>When Higgins was asked about Chase's \"f---ing ask for it\" comments, Higgins seemed content to wait for opportunities to come his way naturally.</p>\n<p>\"I know it's going to come my way,\" Higgins said. \"I've always been like that. When the ball comes my way, I just have to make a play on it. I have to take advantage of every opportunity that I get.\"</p>\n            </div>"
