    "body": "<div>\n        <p>Major League Baseball's clubs have spent the past six months playing nearly every night. But now, only three days remain until the end of the regular season. Time may be in short supply, yet the inverse is true about the consequences of these final days. Half the league, 15 teams in total, remain relevant in some form or another to the playoff picture; two division titles and three wild card berths remain up for grabs; and there are seeding implications all over the place.</p><p>In short, there's going to be a lot to track over the next three days. </p><p>With that in mind, CBS Sports has laid out below where those aforementioned 15 teams reside in the playoff race while providing their remaining schedule and some commentary on their chances of making it to October. Let's proceed.</p><h2>AL East</h2><div>\n                            <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/teams/TOR/toronto-blue-jays/\">\n    <figure><img alt=\"team logo\" src=\"https://sports.cbsimg.net/fly/images/team-logos/314.svg\" /></figure>\n                                                </a>\n                    </div>\n    <h3><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/teams/TOR/toronto-blue-jays/\">Toronto Blue Jays</a> (91-68)</h3><ul><li><strong>Playoff position</strong>: Clinched a playoff berth, tied in AL East</li><li><strong>Schedule</strong>: 3 at <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/teams/TB/tampa-bay-rays/\">Rays</a></li><li><strong>What they're playing for</strong>: Division title, top seed in AL</li></ul><p>The Blue Jays are seeking their first division title since 2015. One factor working in their favor? They won the head-to-head series with the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/teams/NYY/new-york-yankees/\">Yankees</a> (8-5), meaning they do not have to win the division outright in order to win it at all. The Blue Jays will close out their schedule with three games against a Rays squad they've struggled against (3-7) so far.</p><div>\n                            <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/teams/NYY/new-york-yankees/\">\n    <figure><img alt=\"team logo\" src=\"https://sports.cbsimg.net/fly/images/team-logos/310.svg\" /></figure>\n                                                </a>\n                    </div>\n    <h3>New York Yankees (91-68)</h3><ul><li><strong>Playoff position</strong>: Clinched a playoff berth, tied in AL East</li><li><strong>Schedule</strong>: 3 vs. <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/teams/BAL/baltimore-orioles/\">Orioles</a></li><li><strong>What they're playing for</strong>: Divisional title, top seed in AL</li></ul><p>The Yankees clinched a playoff berth earlier this week and moved into a technical tie with the Blue Jays in both the division and for the top seed in the AL. The catch is that they don't possess the tiebreaker advantage over Toronto, meaning they need to finish a game up to claim either prize.</p>\n<div>\n                            <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/teams/BOS/boston-red-sox/\">\n    <figure><img alt=\"team logo\" src=\"https://sports.cbsimg.net/fly/images/team-logos/303.svg\" /></figure>\n                                                </a>\n                    </div>\n    <h3><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/teams/BOS/boston-red-sox/\">Boston Red Sox</a> (87-72)</h3><ul><li><strong>Playoff position</strong>: One game up on second wild card spot</li><li><strong>Schedule</strong>: 3 vs. <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/teams/DET/detroit-tigers/\">Tigers</a></li><li><strong>What they're playing for</strong>: Playoff berth, seeding</li></ul><p>The Red Sox and Tigers will play the biggest series of the weekend. Boston enters a game up on the Tigers for the second wild card, as well as two games up on the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/teams/HOU/houston-astros/\">Astros</a> for a playoff spot. The Red Sox possess the tiebreaker over the Astros, so another win will secure a playoff berth.  </p><h2>AL Central</h2><div>\n                            <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/teams/DET/detroit-tigers/\">\n    <figure><img alt=\"team logo\" src=\"https://sports.cbsimg.net/fly/images/team-logos/306.svg\" /></figure>\n                                                </a>\n                    </div>\n    <h3>Detroit Tigers (86-73)</h3><ul><li><strong>Playoff position</strong>: Tied in the AL Central, one game up on final wild card</li><li><strong>Schedule</strong>: 3 at Red Sox </li><li><strong>What they're playing for</strong>: Division title, playoff berth</li></ul><p>The Tigers are a game up on the Astros for that wild card spot, but, more importantly, they're tied with the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/teams/CLE/cleveland-guardians/\">Guardians</a> for the division crown. Detroit is attempting to stave off one of the worst collapses in recent memory, having led the division by as many as 10 games as recently as Sept. 3. The Tigers do not possess the tiebreaker over the Guardians, but they do have it over the Astros. </p><div>\n                            <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/teams/CLE/cleveland-guardians/\">\n    <figure><img alt=\"team logo\" src=\"https://sports.cbsimg.net/fly/images/team-logos/305.svg\" /></figure>\n                                                </a>\n                    </div>\n    <h3>Cleveland Guardians (86-73)</h3><ul><li><strong>Playoff position</strong>: Tied in the AL Central, one game up on final wild card  </li><li><strong>Schedule</strong>: 3 vs. <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/teams/TEX/texas-rangers/\">Rangers</a></li><li><strong>What they're playing for</strong>: Division title, playoff berth</li></ul><p>As noted above, the Guardians continue to play with house money. They looked cooked in the division race dating back into the summer, when they traded longtime ace <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/players/2507333/shane-bieber/\">Shane Bieber</a> to the Blue Jays. The Guardians secured the head-to-head series earlier this week against the Tigers, so they can win the division either outright or through a tie. Cleveland also possesses the tiebreaker over the Astros, in the event the two squads tie for a wild card berth.</p>\n<h2>AL West</h2><div>\n                            <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/teams/SEA/seattle-mariners/\">\n    <figure><img alt=\"team logo\" src=\"https://sports.cbsimg.net/fly/images/team-logos/312.svg\" /></figure>\n                                                </a>\n                    </div>\n    <h3><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/teams/SEA/seattle-mariners/\">Seattle Mariners</a> (90-69)</h3><ul><li><strong>Playoff position</strong>: Clinched AL West, one game back for top seed</li><li><strong>Schedule</strong>: 3 vs. <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/teams/LAD/los-angeles-dodgers/\">Dodgers</a></li><li><strong>What they're playing for</strong>: Top seed in AL</li></ul><p>The Mariners have already laid claim to their first AL West title since 2001. The question now is if they can overtake the AL East winner -- be it the Blue Jays or the Yankees -- for the top seed. Either way, the Mariners will possess a first-round bye and home-field advantage in the divisional round.</p><div>\n                            <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/teams/HOU/houston-astros/\">\n    <figure><img alt=\"team logo\" src=\"https://sports.cbsimg.net/fly/images/team-logos/320.svg\" /></figure>\n                                                </a>\n                    </div>\n    <h3>Houston Astros (85-74)</h3><ul><li><strong>Playoff position</strong>: One game back of final wild card spot</li><li><strong>Schedule</strong>: 3 at <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/teams/LAA/los-angeles-angels/\">Angels</a></li><li><strong>What they're playing for</strong>: Playoff berth</li></ul><p>The Astros are going to need some help if they're to avoid missing the playoffs for the first time since 2016. The Astros will enter the weekend a game beind the Tigers for the final wild card spot, but, crucially, without the tiebreaker advantage over those Tigers, the Red Sox, or the Guardians. The Astros, then, need to take care of their own business and have that Red Sox-Tigers series go fully one way or the other.</p><h2>NL East</h2><div>\n                            <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/teams/PHI/philadelphia-phillies/\">\n    <figure><img alt=\"team logo\" src=\"https://sports.cbsimg.net/fly/images/team-logos/324.svg\" /></figure>\n                                                </a>\n                    </div>\n    <h3><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/teams/PHI/philadelphia-phillies/\">Philadelphia Phillies</a> (94-65)</h3><ul><li><strong>Playoff position</strong>: Clinched NL East, two games back of top seed </li><li><strong>Schedule</strong>: 3 vs. <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/teams/MIN/minnesota-twins/\">Twins</a></li><li><strong>What they're playing for</strong>: Seeding</li></ul><p>The Phillies have already won the NL East and have secured a first-round bye. Overcoming the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/teams/MIL/milwaukee-brewers/\">Brewers</a> for the top seed will be a tall ask. The Phillies don't possess the tiebreaker over the Brewers, meaning they'll need to sweep the Twins and have the Brewers lose out against the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/teams/CIN/cincinnati-reds/\">Reds</a>. It can happen, it's just not the likeliest outcome.</p>\n<div>\n                            <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/teams/NYM/new-york-mets/\">\n    <figure><img alt=\"team logo\" src=\"https://sports.cbsimg.net/fly/images/team-logos/323.svg\" /></figure>\n                                                </a>\n                    </div>\n    <h3><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/teams/NYM/new-york-mets/\">New York Mets</a> (82-77)</h3><ul><li><strong>Playoff position</strong>: One game up for final wild card spot</li><li><strong>Schedule</strong>: 3 at <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/teams/MIA/miami-marlins/\">Marlins</a></li><li><strong>What they're playing for</strong>: Playoff berth</li></ul><p>The Mets haven't played well since Aug. 1, but they enter the final days of the regular season a game up over the Reds and two games up over the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/teams/ARI/arizona-diamondbacks/\">Diamondbacks</a> for the final wild card spot. The Mets will need to maintain that separation because they don't have the tiebreaker over either club: they lost the season series to the Reds, and they have a worse intradivisional record than the D-backs.

At the same time, it seems unlikely that they're going to earn a postseason berth. The D-backs would need to not only make up two games on the Mets, but have the Reds miss out on their own chance to slide into the tournament. Still, the D-backs are mathematically alive and anything can happen for as long as that's true.</p>\n            </div>"

    "body": "<div>\n        <p>A year ago, Kalen DeBoer looked like the perfect replacement to fill Nick Saban's huge shoes and keep Alabama atop college football.</p><p>A year ago, Ryan Williams looked like one of college football's top new stars when he turned in a dazzling six-catch, 177-yard, two-touchdown performance that included an acrobatic 75-yard game-winning score, one of the best plays of the season.</p><p>A year ago, the future of Alabama football looked so bright, the transition from college football's greatest coach to his successor was as seamless as possible.</p><p>A lot can, and has, happened in the year since Alabama beat Georgia 41-34 in a thriller inside Bryant-Denny Stadium. In the last 365 days, DeBoer has lost five games -- all away from Tuscaloosa -- to Vanderbilt, Oklahoma, Tennessee, Michigan and Florida State.</p>\n<p>Since Williams exploded onto the national scene in the Georgia win, he hasn't lived up to the massive hype. He never broke 100 receiving yards again in 2024 after that Georgia game, averaging fewer than 45 yards per contest over the final nine contests. He struggled in the Florida State loss to start the 2025 season, though he looked like his old self in a dominant 165-yard and two touchdown performance against Wisconsin in Week 3. </p><p>Can DeBoer and Williams deliver some more of the magic that made them the toast of Tuscaloosa a year ago? Or will the complaints about DeBoer, especially his road struggles, ratchet up with another loss?</p><p>Those are just some of the stakes for No. 17 Alabama at No. 5 Georgia inside Sanford Stadium on Saturday night (7:30 p.m. ET). No September game should probably be a \"must-win,\" but it sure feels close for Alabama. With the Tide already trying to recover from a season-opening loss to Florida State, there isn't much margin for error as SEC play begins. Saying Alabama has to win at Georgia isn't particularly fair, but it badly needs a marquee victory after how everything has played out since last year. DeBoer needs to remind people how brilliant his offense can look when everything is humming, not how disjointed and disappointing it has previously been on the road.</p>\n<p>There's plenty to prove over in Athens, too, even if the stakes aren't quite as high. In a frequently repeated statistic this week, Kirby Smart is just 1-6 lifetime against Alabama since taking over the Georgia program. Five of those losses, of course, came against his mentor Saban. Smart beat Alabama in the 2022 national championship, the highlight in many ways of what is already a Hall of Fame career, but the narrative that he can't defeat the Tide hasn't gone away. If Georgia loses Saturday night, Smart falls to 0-2 against DeBoer, and it feels like a real issue for a coach who has otherwise dominated everything in his path.</p><p>This is the kind of game that can help DeBoer, already feeling pressure, turn doubters into believers again. It's the kind of game that can allow Smart to rid himself of his Tide demons and give Georgia its first home win over Alabama since 2003. The stakes may be higher for Alabama, but the result could alter the season trajectory for both programs.</p><h2>Can Franklin get over the 'Big Game James' moniker?</h2><p>The record seems to follow Penn State coach James Franklin wherever he goes. No matter how much overall success he's had in Happy Valley, no one can forget his abysmal record against top opponents. He is 1-13 against top-five teams, 3-17 against top-10 teams and 17-26 against top-25 opponents.</p>\n<p>In fairness to Franklin, especially against top-five teams, plenty of those games came when he didn't have the better, more talented roster. It still doesn't excuse all the losses, though, and Penn State certainly had more talent than Notre Dame last season and still choked away a College Football Playoff semifinal.</p><p>This feels like his best chance in a while to get a top-10 win, with Oregon coming to Beaver Stadium. The Ducks are hot, but Dante Moore will be tested in what should be a raucous \"White Out\" environment. If Franklin can't get it done this year, with all the returning starters who came back for one last ride, he likely never will. He could really use a win over Oregon, or the derisive \"Big Game James\" label will be everywhere Sunday.</p><h2>Keep an eye on Indiana, Illinois</h2><p>How a team handles great success or a devastating loss can be telling. That's why Indiana and Illinois are worth watching this weekend after the Hoosiers walloped the Illini 63-10 last week.</p>\n<p>Both have tricky matchups. Indiana travels to Iowa, while Illinois hosts No. 21 USC. Can the Hoosiers move on from a dominant win over a top-10 opponent and not get caught up in the hype and praise -- especially with new Heisman Trophy frontrunner Fernando Mendoza in the spotlight? Can Illinois flush its awful result and restore the feisty version we saw last season that finished with 10 wins?</p><p>The big wins and losses get the headlines, but how you handle them often determines how your season unfolds. This weekend is big in that regard for both Indiana and Illinois.</p><h2>Playoff expansion still stuck in the mud</h2><p>The odds of an expanded playoff in 2026 <span><a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/news/college-football-playoff-leaders-comfortable-with-12-team-format-not-in-rush-to-decide-on-2026-expansion/\" target=\"_blank\">continue to shrink as the Dec. 1 deadline approaches.</a></span> CFP leaders met in Chicago this week, but only spent about 20 minutes of a four-hour-plus meeting on the future format. CFP executive director Rich Clark said commissioners haven't had much time to dig into specifics with everything else going on in college athletics.</p>\n<p>Clark didn't say it, but part of the issue is that it really only matters what the Big Ten and SEC want -- and they're at an impasse. The Big Ten has pushed for a model heavy on automatic qualifiers that could include up to 28 teams, while the SEC is more interested in a 16-team format with five automatic bids and the rest at-large.</p><p>There has been little progress in recent months, according to sources, and limited group discussion about what the format should look like. Clark said Wednesday the group is comfortable staying with staying at 12 teams. If the Big Ten and SEC can't compromise, the CFP will stick with the 12-team playoff already approved for 2026.</p><h2>Salty Talty</h2><p><em>Each week this space will be my airing of grievances, my opportunity to let the audience know what has been really grinding my gears. Hopefully it'll be mostly college football-related, but it's a good bet travel, family and other day-to-day life annoyances will find a way in. </em></p>\n<p>Less than 48 hours from a road game against No. 9 <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/teams/TXAM/texas-am-aggies/\">Texas A&M</a>, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/teams/AUBURN/auburn-tigers/\">Auburn</a> athletic director John Cohen was still thinking about Oklahoma.</p><p>It had been five days since the Tigers lost to the Sooners, 24-17, but Cohen evidently couldn't get over a controversial officiating call that went against his football program. Game officials missed a \"hideout tactic\" in the second quarter that should have been called an unsportsmanlike penalty and instead resulted in a touchdown. Cohen issued a statement on Thursday that said, in part, Auburn remains \"extremely disappointed\" and that \"Saturday went beyond judgment calls\" against the Tigers.</p><p>\"As the SEC acknowledged, the Auburn family and student-athletes deserved better,\" Cohen wrote. </p>\n<p>That statement is justified if it comes out on Sunday or Monday, but waiting all the way until Thursday afternoon is absurd. Perhaps Cohen was getting pressure from boosters and trustees to say something over a call that played a role in Auburn's loss to Oklahoma, but it comes off as small-time and lame to do it now. </p><p>George Perles, the legendary defensive mind and former <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/teams/MICHST/michigan-state-spartans/\">Michigan State</a> coach, had a \"24-hour rule\" that Nick Saban later adopted at Alabama. Essentially, you had 24 hours to celebrate a win or mourn a loss, and then you had to move on. Cohen would be wise to follow that strategy moving forward. </p><p>Still complaining about a loss five days after the fact shows the priorities aren't what they should be, especially with a critical top 10 road game coming up this weekend. There's nothing that can be done at this point. The SEC admitted its fault in the officiating error, but it isn't changing the final result. This wasn't a last-second officiating call that doomed the Tigers. This happened in the second quarter, and while it is beyond unfortunate it played out the way it did, Auburn had ample time to overcome it and couldn't do so. </p>\n<p>Cohen sending out that statement might appeal to an upset Auburn fan base, but is embarrassing for a veteran AD who should know better. </p>\n            </div>"

Trading away Parsons, who along with Hall of Famer Reggie White stands as one of the two only players since sacks became an officially tracked individual statistic in 1982 with at least 12 in their first four seasons, plus with an injured and with a shallow, banged up cornerback room, the Cowboys defense is getting rocked in 2025. </p><p>Their 30.7 points per game allowed in the team's 1-2 start is the fourth-most allowed through three games of a season in franchise history, and they've allowed the following combined passing production the last two weeks against a now-benched, 36-year-old <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/1272242/russell-wilson/\">Russell Wilson</a> and second-year quarterback <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/26695775/caleb-williams/\">Caleb Williams</a>: 71% completion percentage, 360.0 passing yards per game, seven passing touchdowns and one interception. That's why Dallas ranks bottom 10 or bottom five in the NFL in nearly every key defensive metric through three weeks with Parsons coming to town helping lead the Packers (2-1) No. 1 scoring defense (14.7 points per game).</p><p>\"The defense, it's all tied together. Are we getting enough pressure on the quarterback? No. When you look at it, we could do better. Come out of that game [a 31-14 loss at the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/CHI/chicago-bears/\">Chicago Bears</a> in Week 3] with no sacks is not good enough,\" Cowboys coach Brian Schottenheimer said on Monday when asked if he reflects on the \"unanimous\" decision to trade Parsons. \"Again, there's things that we can do from a scheme standpoint, but certainly a coverage's best friend is the pass rush. ... So we're looking at that. ... Certainly on defense, it takes all 11 to affect the quarterback -- coverage and pass rush.\"  </p>\n<table><tbody><tr><th>Cowboys Defense NFL Ranks, Entering Week 4 of 2025 season</th><th><br /></th><th>NFL Rank</th></tr><tr><td><p>PPG Allowed</p></td><td><p>30.7</p></td><td><p>27th</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Total YPG Allowed</p></td><td><p>397.1</p></td><td><p>30th</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Yards/Play Allowed</p></td><td><p>6.5</p></td><td><p>31st</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>3rd Down Conversion Rate Allowed</p></td><td><p>53.7%</p></td><td><p>Last</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>QB Pressure Rate </p></td><td><p>29.9%</p></td><td><p>26th</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Passer Rating Allowed</p></td><td><p>125.3</p></td><td><p>31st</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Takeaways  </p></td><td><p>1</p></td><td><p>T-27th</p></td></tr></tbody></table><p>The Cowboys' 40.2% team quarterback pressure rate with Parsons on the roster from 2021-2024 was the best in the NFL in that span. Without him in 2025, Dallas possesses a 29.9% QB pressure rate, the seventh-worst in the NFL through three weeks. This season in Green Bay, Parsons is producing the highest quarterback pressure rate (21.8%) among all edge rushers this season even though he's been double-teamed at the highest rate (18.4%) among edge rushers, according to <a href=\"https://x.com/frontofficenfl/status/1970993268055028216?s=46&t=imTqYpR77VPKClRssargWQ\" target=\"_blank\">NextGenStats via NFL Media</a>. That's why it is easy to project Dallas would be playing better in 2025 with Parsons because the effect of his absence in Dallas is clear as is the impact of his presence in Green Bay. Packers Pro Bowl edge rusher <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/2260648/rashan-garys/\">Rashan Gary's</a> single-season career-high for sacks is 9.5. Rushing the passer alongside Parsons, Gary leads the NFL with 4.5 sacks through three weeks, and he is on pace for what would be an NFL record 25.5 sacks. </p><p>\"I would say we have not been playing to the standard we want to play to, but if we had Micah you can't predict that we would be playing any better and you can't predict we'd be playing any better any worse,\" Schottenheimer maintained on Wednesday. \"Are you 3-0? Are you 0-3? You don't know. Those are projections. Again, we're focused on the things we need to get better at. We realize we got to get more pressure on the quarterback. We also have to cover and communicate better. Those things don't change. ... Our job as coaches is to always look for solutions when you're doing things poorly. ... So the process never changes.\"</p><p>\"You really can't dwell on the past, you really can't,\" Eberflus said Thursday when asked about missing Parsons. ... \"There's a lot of talk or chatter out there about that, but to me, our eyes are forward. ... We got good enough pass rushers.\"</p><h2>How Cowboys can try to slow down Packers QB <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/2239997/jordan-love/\">Jordan Love</a> in the words of Kenny Clark</h2><p>Downfield passing takes time to set up and block offensively, and because of Dallas' struggling pass rush, they have allowed their opponents to have the time to hit on five passing touchdowns of 20 or more air yards this season -- the most in the NFL through three weeks. All of them have come in the last two weeks against the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/NYG/new-york-giants/\">New York Giants</a> and the Chicago Bears. The most such deep passing touchdowns the other 31 teams in the league have allowed this season is two. No defense has been worse than Dallas' when it comes to surrendering explosive passing touchdowns through the air. </p><p>That makes the Cowboys' Week 4 matchup against Packers quarterback Jordan Love poorly timed: Love averages 9.1 air yards per pass attempt this season, the fourth-highest in the NFL. Dallas knows he and Green Bay head coach Matt LaFleur will look to stretch the Cowboys' defense deep downfield on \"Sunday Night Football\" in Week 4. </p><p>\"That's what their offense is, they push the ball down field. They're hunting shots all the time, and that's what Matt does a great job of. Really good offensive coordinator, one of the best in the league,\" Eberflus said. \"So that's their offense, and couple that with a talented quarterback that can push the ball downfield. Very strong arm, accurate, very elusive in the pocket. Can get out and run as well when he needs to, so it's a big challenge.\"</p><p>It's been a challenge for both Eberflus and the Cowboys to slow Love down in their separate meetings with <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/419780/aaron-rodgers/\">Aaron Rodgers</a>' Green Bay successor. Love's Packers beat Eberflus' Bears, when he was their head coach from 2022-2024, in all three meetings, and he lit up his Chicago defense, throwing for 274 yards per game, 6 touchdown passes and one interception while completing 72.4% of his passes. That was good for a sparkling 128.3 passer rating.   </p><p>The last time Love faced the Cowboys, in the 2023 wild card round that served as his NFL postseason debut, he lit Dallas up at AT&T Stadium, helping power Green Bay to a 48-32 victory in a game they initially led 27-0. He threw for 272 yards passing and three touchdowns on 16 of 21 passing (76.2% completion percentage). That box score made Love the Packers' single-game playoff record holder for yards per pass attempt (13.0) and passer rating (157.2).</p><p>\"He looked pretty good in 2023 that last game I saw him play. I think the command of it, he's been in the system a while. You see him getting through progression. You see him knowing where everybody is, checking the ball down. The guy is really an excellent passer, but I think you see the mastery in the system a little bit,\" Schottenheimer said on Wednesday. \"Really good at the play-action stuff. They obviously run the ball very well because of the [running] back. Josh (Jacobs) is a great player. I like what they do. I think what they're doing with Jordan in the system is excellent because they can run the ball. But the play [action] passes are excellent off of it. I just see a guy that's maturing. You see his eyes move through his progression. He's balancing the defense in zone. He does a good job of people to the right when he wants to go back to his left. For a guy that likes watching quarterback play, it's been fun for me to watch his evolution.\"</p><table><tbody><tr><th>Packers QB Jordan Love vs. Matt Eberflus' Chicago Bears Defense, 2022-2024</th><th>Wk 1, 2023, Wk 18, 2023, Wk 11, 2024</th></tr><tr><td><p>W-L</p></td><td><p>3-0</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Pass YPG</p></td><td><p>274.0</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Pass Yards/Attempt</p></td><td><p>10.8</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>TD-INT</p></td><td><p>6-1</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Passer Rating</p></td><td><p>128.3</p></td></tr><tr><td>Sacks Taken</td><td>3</td></tr></tbody></table><p>So what can the Cowboys do to slow him down? Clark, his teammate for five seasons from 2020 to 2024, has an idea.</p><p>\"[Packers head coach Matt] LaFleur is giving him more of the load for the offense. He is able to control more stuff at the line. He sat behind a Hall of Famer like Aaron and got all of his movements and all that kind of stuff,\" Clark said on Wednesday. \"He does a great job with that. The biggest thing with him is making sure we get pressure on him. Whether it's with four or sending more than four, whatever it is. We got to get pressure on him because when he has a clean pocket, he can dice you up.\"</p><p>Clark's observation of his ex-teammate is astute. Love leads the NFL in completion percentage (84.3%), yards per pass attempt (11.0)  when not pressured this season. He ranks second in the NFL in passer rating (136.9, behind only <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/2239671/lamar-jacksons/\">Lamar Jackson's</a> 136.9 passer rating) as well when given a clean pocket.

    "body": "<div>\n        <p>The 45th playing of the Ryder Cup may be the most anticipated in event history with the United States and Europe squaring off as near-equal sides at Bethpage Black in Farmingdale, New York. One of the most remarkable public courses in the nation is where the Americans will seek to regain the trophy with Europe aiming to not only hold it but pick up the first road victory in the challenge in 13 years by capturing the 2025 Ryder Cup outright.</p><p>Four years ago, the United States put together its youngest and perhaps most-talented Ryder Cup team of all time. Now, it boasts a young captain in 39-year-old Keegan Bradley, whose immense passion for the event will ideally fuel an American side bringing four rookies into the competition. On the other side, Luke Donald captains a European team that won the Ryder Cup in a rout just two years ago in Rome. Donald is not only going for back-to-back trophies, he aims to etch his name in event history by winning the Ryder Cup as not only the top player in the world (2012) but twice as a captain.</p><p><span><a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/golf/news/ryder-cup-2025-predictions-team-usa-europe-roster-rankings/\" target=\"_blank\">Ranking all 24 Ryder Cup roster members</a></span>, CBS Sports has determined that Europe is stronger at the top of its team with three of the top four players in the field. However, the United States is less top heavy with an immense amount of talent up and down its squad. Whether the top-level play or depth wins out remains to be seen, but no matter what score is on the board at the conclusion of play Friday, the 28 sessions will be hotly contested through Sunday singles.</p><p>Scottie Scheffler (United States) and Rory McIlroy (Europe) are the top players on their respective teams, and they enter this Ryder Cup having claimed three of the four major championships in 2025 with McIlroy winning the Masters to complete the career grand slam. The Ulsterman has claimed all year that among his few remaining goals as a professional golfer is to win a road Ryder Cup as Europe's leader; his best -- and perhaps last -- chance at doing so comes this week at Bethpage.</p><p>No matter how it shakes out, this Ryder Cup is going to be a barn burner, one unlike anything that has been seen before in this event -- all in front of what should be a rowdy New York crowd.

Castellanos is the type of quarterback that keeps defenses honest as he possesses the ability to take off at a moment's notice. He's completing a staggering 71.1% of his passes on the year while also averaging 5.1 yards per carry on the ground. Castellanos has also combined for six touchdowns (three passing and three rushing) this season, including rushing for a pair against <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/teams/KENTST/kent-state-golden-flashes/\">Kent State</a> last week. Virginia will likely have a spy on Castellanos on most plays to try to limit his running ability.</p><p><strong>Seminoles need to keep stellar running game going:</strong> Castellanos offers immense rushing upside, but Florida State has a solid stable of running backs that have been productive thus far. Sophomore <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/players/29129931/samuel-singleton-jr/\">Samuel Singleton Jr</a>. leads Seminole running backs with 168 yards and three touchdowns while averaging 12.0 yards per carry. Junior <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/players/28908857/gavin-sawchuk/\">Gavin Sawchuk</a> carries the ball the most out of Florida State's backfield with 25 carries for 160 yards and a team-high five touchdowns. Overall, Florida State is averaging 363.0 yards per game on the ground, which is by far the most in the ACC up to this point. That will need to continue in order to thrive on the road this week.</p><p><strong>Virginia aerial attack must continue to produce:</strong> The Cavaliers are among the top teams in the ACC when it comes to throwing the football. Morris has tossed the fourth-most touchdowns (8) and the fifth-most passing yards (1,050) in the conference up to this point. Morris has played mistake-free football with just one interception and has been sacked on just one occasion in 2025. While Florida State's defense is easily the best that Virginia has faced, Morris has the talent to give the Seminoles fits at times.</p>\n<h2>Florida State vs. Virginia prediction, picks<br /></h2><p>It's hard to argue with the way Florida State has begun the 2025 season. Defeating a then-top 10 team like Alabama was a breath of fresh air for a Florida State program that won just two games a season ago. The Seminoles have looked dominant on both sides of the ball. Granted, Florida State wasn't exactly challenged in each of their last two contests, but it consistently made life difficult for Alabama quarterback <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/players/28878532/ty-simpson/\">Ty Simpson</a> in the season opener. Going on the road is certainly always a tougher test, but the Seminoles should have no problem covering a touchdown spread in Charlottesville. <strong><em>Pick: Florida State -6.5</em></strong></p>\n            </div>"

The Buckeyes are coming off a bye, and the team was a little lackluster in 2024 following its early bye weeks. OSU failed to cover in either contest following its two regular season byes last year, including narrowly beating Nebraska by four points, despite being favored by 25.5 points. As for the Huskies, they're also 3-0 on the season and coming off a 35-point road victory in a rivalry game with Washington State. Washington's 55.7 points per game are second-most in FBS as it should be able to stick with an Ohio State team that's allowing over 100 rushing yards per game, despite facing just one Power 4 team. The model has Washington covering nearly 60% of the time. <a href=\"https://www.sportsline.com/insiders/college-football-odds-lines-spreads-picks-predictions-betting-advice-for-week-5-2025-from-proven-model/#ttag=09222025_agg_cbssports_picks_football_ncaa_model_Week5collegefootballodds\" target=\"_blank\">See which other picks the model likes here</a>.</p><p>Another prediction: No. 9 Texas A&M (-6.5, 52.5) covers against Auburn well over 50% of the time at Saturday at 3:30 p.m. ET. Auburn fell out of the Top 25 following its defeat to Oklahoma, while the Aggies had a bye last Saturday, following their upset of then-No. 8 Notre Dame. The Tigers struggled containing QB John Mateer of OU, as he had 300 total yards, with touchdowns both thru the air on the ground, so Auburn should equally struggle with A&M's Marcel Reed. The quarterback has a 9:1 TD:INT and is averaging nearly 50 rushing yards per game. Add in that just two teams in the nation have allowed more sacks than Auburn, and just 10 FBS teams average more penalties, and the Tigers have several issues that A&M can exploit. SportsLine's model also predicts the Over hitting more than 50% of the time. <a href=\"https://www.sportsline.com/insiders/college-football-odds-lines-spreads-picks-predictions-betting-advice-for-week-5-2025-from-proven-model/#ttag=09222025_agg_cbssports_picks_football_ncaa_model_Week5collegefootballodds\" target=\"_blank\">See the rest of the model's picks here</a>.</p><h2>How to make college football picks for Week 5</h2><p>The model has also made the call on who wins and covers in every FBS matchup in Week 5, and it's calling for multiple upsets, including a shocking result in a ranked matchup. <a href=\"https://www.sportsline.com/insiders/college-football-odds-lines-spreads-picks-predictions-betting-advice-for-week-5-2025-from-proven-model/#ttag=09222025_agg_cbssports_picks_football_ncaa_model_Week5collegefootballodds\" target=\"_blank\">You can only get every pick for every game at SportsLine</a>, <strong>and for a limited time you can use promo code CHAMPIONSHIP to get your first month at SportsLine for $1.</strong></p><p><strong>So what college football picks can you make with confidence, and which underdogs win outright?

LSU is 6-1 both straight-up and against the spread (ATS) following a 40-point win over the last 10 years. All seven of those games were against teams currently in the SEC, so LSU wasn't simply dominating inferior opponents. Additionally, LSU will be visiting an Ole Miss squad which has often come up short when favored in big games as the Rebels are just 1-6 ATS over their last seven contests as favorites versus ranked teams.</p><p>LSU's defense has been among the best in the nation, holding opponents to just 9.2 points per game, which is the ninth-fewest in FBS. No opponent has scored more than 10 points versus LSU nor reached even 90 yards on the ground. On offense, quarterback <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/players/26701706/garrett-nussmeier/\">Garrett Nussmeier</a> kept his name alive in the Heisman conversation with his performance in his last game. He had 273 yards and three touchdowns thru the air while also rushing for a score. He posted a career high in completion percentage as LSU should have a balanced offensive attack versus a Rebels squad which ranks last in the SEC in run defense. <a href=\"https://www.sportsline.com/insiders/lsu-vs-ole-miss-odds-line-best-bets-week-5-2025-college-football-picks-from-proven-model/#ttag=09242025_agg_cbssports_picks_football_ncaa_model_LSUOleMisscfb\" target=\"_blank\">See which team to back at SportsLine</a>. </p><h2>Why Ole Miss can cover</h2><p>Being in Oxford is certainly an advantage for Ole Miss, as not only has the home team prevailed in each of the last five meetings between these teams, but the home squad has covered in seven straight matchups. Ole Miss has covered in all three of its home games this season and has been on quite a run at Vaught-Hemingway Stadium for a while. The Rebels have won in six straight home games, dating back to last season, and Lane Kiffin's crew has prevailed in 16 of its last 17 home games overall.</p><p>As is the case with most Kiffin-coached teams, these Rebels are elite offensively, ranking among the top dozen FBS team in points per game (44.8), yards per game (544.8) and yards per play (7.4). The team has at least three rushing touchdowns in every game, while the Rebels' pass defense is also a strength of the team. Ole Miss has held three of four opponents under both 200 passing yards and a 50% completion rate. <a href=\"https://www.sportsline.com/insiders/lsu-vs-ole-miss-odds-line-best-bets-week-5-2025-college-football-picks-from-proven-model/#ttag=09242025_agg_cbssports_picks_football_ncaa_model_LSUOleMisscfb\" target=\"_blank\">See which team to back at SportsLine</a>.</p><p><em>New users can also check out the latest </em><span><a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/betting/news/fanduel-promo-code/\" target=\"_blank\"><em>FanDuel promo code</em></a></span><em> and </em><a href=\"https://martech.cbssports.com/bt/redirect/prod?b=fanduel&c=sport\" target=\"_blank\"><em>get $300 in bonus bets instantly at FanDuel if your $5 bet wins</em></a><em>. </em></p><h2>How to make LSU vs. Ole Miss picks</h2><p>SportsLine's model has simulated Ole Miss vs. LSU   10,000 times and is going Over on the total, projecting 58 combined points.

    "body": "<div>\n        <p>It's the game of the week. This Sunday night, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/GB/green-bay-packers/\">Green Bay Packers</a> pass rusher <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/2967590/micah-parsons/\">Micah Parsons</a> will make his return to Dallas to face his former team. </p><p>Just last month, the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/DAL/dallas-cowboys/\">Cowboys</a> traded Parsons to the Packers in exchange for two first-round picks and defensive tackle <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/2079670/kenny-clark/\">Kenny Clark</a>. It marked the end of a months-long contract standoff, as in Green Bay, Parsons found the historical four-year, $188 million deal he was seeking. Now, he has a chance to make Jerry Jones pay for not paying him.</p><p>Parsons will be motivated to terrorize his former team, but how will the Packers use him? <a href=\"https://x.com/RapSheet/status/1971424091207835769\" target=\"_blank\">According to NFL Media</a>, expect Parsons to be \"unleashed\" as far as his snap count goes. The Packers are also expected to move Parsons around on defense like Dan Quinn did during his time as the Cowboys' defensive coordinator. It sounds like Parsons will be utilized differently compared to Weeks 1-3. </p><p>Remember, Parsons was traded to Green Bay just 10 days before the season opener. In some ways, he's been ramping up. Through three games, the four-time Pro Bowl player has recorded five tackles, six QB hits and 1.5 sacks. He's registered 15 pressures this season, including 13 over the last two weeks. That's tied for the third-most in the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://cbssports.com/nfl/\">NFL</a> in that span. </p>\n<table><tbody><tr><th>Week</th><th>Opponent</th><th>Sacks</th><th>Defensive Snaps</th><th>% Defensive Snaps</th></tr><tr><td><p>1</p></td><td><p>vs. <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/DET/detroit-lions/\">Detroit Lions</a></p></td><td><p>1.0</p></td><td><p>30</p></td><td><p>44.8%</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>2</p></td><td><p>vs. <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/WAS/washington-commanders/\">Washington Commanders</a></p></td><td><p>0.5</p></td><td><p>47</p></td><td><p>68.1%</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>3</p></td><td><p>at <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/CLE/cleveland-browns/\">Cleveland Browns</a></p></td><td><p>0.0</p></td><td><p>51</p></td><td><p>77.3%</p></td></tr></tbody></table><p>As far as where Parsons has lined up with Green Bay through three games, 125 of his 128 defensive snaps have come on the defensive line. When he was with the Cowboys -- especially in his first two <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://cbssports.com/nfl/\">NFL</a> seasons -- Parsons was moved around everywhere to keep opposing offenses on their toes. He registered snaps on the defensive line, at linebacker and even some in the secondary, such as in the slot. All five starters on the Cowboys offensive line will have to be ready to potentially face Parsons on Sunday. </p><h2>What Parsons has said about his return</h2><p>Parsons doesn't have any hate for the team that selected him No. 12 overall back in 2021. In <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/news/micah-parsons-trade-former-cowboys-star-issues-statement-to-fans-following-trade-to-packers/\" target=\"_blank\">the statement</a> he issued on social media following the trade, Parsons described himself as a longtime Cowboys fan that was destined to play football in Dallas. He even said \"This is a sad day, but not a bitter one.\"</p><p>Sunday night, he's going to have the chance to hit his former quarterback, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/1824864/dak-prescott/\">Dak Prescott</a>, at full speed for the very first time. It sounds like maybe Parsons has <span><a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/news/micah-parsons-braces-for-painful-matchup-vs-cowboys-dak-prescott-as-packers-star-returns-to-dallas/\" target=\"_blank\">mixed feelings about it</a></span>.  </p><p>\"It's going to be painful,\" <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://x.com/RobMaaddi/status/1970610370352906626\">Parsons said to the Associated Press</a>. \"Dak's my guy. He was always a good mentor for me. But you know how it is. I always told him if I ever faced him that it would be a great matchup. So I'm excited to see what Sunday brings itself.\"</p><p>Parsons also isn't trying to blow his return to AT&T Stadium out of proportion. It's simply the fourth game of the season for the Packers. </p><p>\"I accepted my fate weeks ago when the trade happened,\" Parsons said. \"It's all about playing another game and just doing what I do best, and that's be a disruptive football player. I think the media and the fans are trying to blow it up to be such a big thing, but I just look at it as just another game at AT&T.\"</p><h2>What Prescott said about Parsons' return</h2><p>The Cowboys quarterback was asked about Parsons' comments, and he obviously hopes his former teammate can't get to him. Prescott is trusting those charged with protecting him. </p><p>\"I hope it's not [painful] for me. And I hope he doesn't get to me,\" Prescott said, <a href=\"https://x.com/jonmachota/status/1971317806571626993\" target=\"_blank\">via The Athletic</a>. </p><p>\"It'll definitely be fun. It's one me and my fiancée were just talking about the other day. Just all the reps of practice going against Micah, times when he couldn't hit me, whether him getting back there, just the trash talk back and forth, me telling him he wouldn't tackle me anyways, he still can't bring me down. </p><p>\"Just getting to go out there and compete with a guy that that's a good friend, that I've competed with in numbers of ways throughout this building, outside of this building. Just excited to go and have that matchup. But he's got five guys up front, plus tight ends and running backs that he's got to get through. Then we'll worry about if he can get to me.\"</p>\n            </div>"

ASU's offense is led by quarterback Sam Leavitt, who has thrown for 748 yards with six touchdowns and three interceptions so far this season. Running back Raleek Brown has been a consistent threat, averaging 6.6 yards per carry with 372 rushing yards. On the outside, Jordyn Tyson leads the team in receiving yards with 357, giving the Sun Devils a reliable deep-play option.</p><p>On defense, the Sun Devils are led by linebacker Jordan Briggs and defensive back Tyler Johnson, who have anchored the unit. Briggs leads the team in tackles, while Johnson provides playmaking ability in the secondary. Defensively, ASU has been strong against the run but remains vulnerable through the air, which could be viewed as a potential X-factor in this matchup. <a href=\"https://www.sportsline.com/insiders/tcu-vs-arizona-state-prediction-odds-line-spread-start-time-proven-football-expert-makes-cfb-week-5-picks-best-bets/#ttag=09232025_agg_cbssports_picks_football_cfb_Hunt_ASUTCUcfb\" target=\"_blank\">See which team to back at SportsLine</a>. </p><h2>Why TCU can cover</h2><p>TCU enters this matchup with a 3-0 record, including a notable 35-24 victory over SMU, which propelled them into the AP Top 25 at No. 24.

Wide receiver Eric McAlister leads the team in receiving yards (320) and touchdown receptions (3) to go with 13 catches in 2025. </p><p>The Horned Frogs' defense is anchored by standout defensive tackle Markis Deal, who has recorded 1.5 sacks and nine total tackles, showcasing his disruptive presence in the trenches.

But the Dodgers weren't the only team in a clinch scenario on Thursday.

    "body": "<div>\n<p>The 2025-26 Serie A season kicked off in Italy as <span>Napoli</span> started the campaign to defend the 2024-25 title, after winning their fourth Scudetto ever on the last matchday of the season. <span>Inter</span>, Juventus and <span>AC Milan</span> will compete with the team coached by Antonio Conte to win the Serie A title, while other teams such as AS <span>Roma</span>, <span>Atalanta</span>, <span>Lazio</span>, <span>Fiorentina</span>, <span>Bologna</span> and <span>Como</span> are all in contention for a spot in next season's European tournaments.</p><h2>Will Pulisic lead the Rossoneri to the success?</h2><p>American star <span>Christian Pulisic</span> started off the 2025-26 season strongly. The AC Milan attacker already has five goals in all competitions over six matches played between Coppa Italia and Serie A. Despite a lingering ankle injury still hampering his game time under Massimiliano Allegri, Pulisic was able to make the most out of the minutes played and his new tactical role. In fact, since the 2025-26 season, Pulisic is playing as a striker in the 3-5-2 deployed by the former Juventus manager who made his comeback at AC Milan after coaching the Rossoneri from 2010 to 2014. Pulisic played alongside Rafael Leao in the opening match of the season in the Coppa Italia playoff against Bari on August 16, but since an injury to the Portuguese player he started alongside the other striker on the roster, Santiago Gimenez.</p><figure><p><img alt=\"export.png\" src=\"https://sportshub.cbsistatic.com/i/r/2025/09/25/5a4a069f-0d8d-4a1b-94cb-8e014b9b92af/resize/670x377/85264fabb31917571254f928e7e82477/export.png\" /></p><figcaption><span>\n                                                                    TruMedia\n                                                            </span></figcaption></figure><p>On Sunday, AC Milan will host Antonio Conte's Napoli, the 2024-25 Serie A champions. There are a lot of similarities between the current season of the Rossoneri and the one of Napoli last year. In fact, both teams are starting a new cycle under a new manager, who knows the league well and has already won the Serie A title multiple times before. On top of their previous experience, both Conte and Allegri had to start working with a team that was deeply affected by the negative results of the year before. Both Conte's Napoli last season and Allegri right now are only focusing on the league after the disappointment of last season, when AC Milan ended up in eight place and missed out on all the European tournaments. </p><p>It's a key season for Pulisic, ahead of the the 2026 World Cup in the United States with his national team, and this new tactical role is really helping the American star to boost his performances and show his full range of attacking qualities. Under Allegri, he enjoys the freedom to move into space on the left side of the attack, with the coach restoring him to his natural position in a way no other Milan manager did before. While everything seems to be working well at the moment, Allegri knows how decisive individual performances can be in the biggest matches, such as the one on Sunday against Napoli. That's why Pulisic is the ideal player for him right now. A leader capable of leading the team toward success and potentially guiding Milan back to winning trophies and championships.</p><h2>How to watch AC Milan vs. Napoli, odds</h2><ul><li><strong>Date</strong>: Sunday, Sept. 28 | <strong>Time</strong>: 3 p.m. ET</li><li><strong>Location</strong>: San Siro -- Milan</li><li><strong>Live stream: </strong><a href=\"https://www.paramountplus.com/?cbscidmt=sports&ftag=PPM-03-10ahh3j\" target=\"_blank\">Paramount+</a></li><li><strong>Odds: </strong>AC Milan +135; Draw +213; Napoli +209</li></ul><h2>How to watch Serie A Matchday 5</h2><p><em>All times U.S./Eastern</em></p><p><strong>Saturday, September 27</strong></p><p>Como vs. Crenonese, 9 a.m. (<a href=\"https://www.paramountplus.com/?cbscidmt=sports&ftag=PPM-03-10ahh3j\" target=\"_blank\">Paramount+</a>)<br />Juventus vs. Atalanta, 12 p.m. (CBS)<br /><span>Cagliari</span> vs. Inter, 2:45 p.m. (<a href=\"https://www.paramountplus.com/?cbscidmt=sports&ftag=PPM-03-10ahh3j\" target=\"_blank\">Paramount+</a>)</p><p><strong>Sunday, September 28</strong><br />Sassuolo vs. <span>Udinese</span>, 6:30 a.m. (<a href=\"https://www.paramountplus.com/?cbscidmt=sports&ftag=PPM-03-10ahh3j\" target=\"_blank\">Paramount+</a>)<br /><span>Pisa</span> vs. Fiorentina, 9 a.m. (<a href=\"https://www.paramountplus.com/?cbscidmt=sports&ftag=PPM-03-10ahh3j\" target=\"_blank\">Paramount+</a>)<br />AS Roma vs. <span>Hellas Verona</span>, 9 a.m. (<a href=\"https://www.paramountplus.com/?cbscidmt=sports&ftag=PPM-03-10ahh3j\" target=\"_blank\">Paramount+</a>)<br /><span>Lecce</span> vs. Bologna, 12 p.m. (<a href=\"https://www.paramountplus.com/?cbscidmt=sports&ftag=PPM-03-10ahh3j\" target=\"_blank\">Paramount+</a>)<br />AC Milan vs. Napoli, 2:45 p.m. (<a href=\"https://www.paramountplus.com/?cbscidmt=sports&ftag=PPM-03-10ahh3j\" target=\"_blank\">Paramount+</a>)</p><p><strong>Monday, September 29<br /></strong><span>Parma</span> vs. <span>Torino</span>, 12:30 p.m. (<a href=\"https://www.paramountplus.com/?cbscidmt=sports&ftag=PPM-03-10ahh3j\" target=\"_blank\">Paramount+</a>)<br /><span>Genoa</span> vs. Lazio, 2:45 p.m. (<a href=\"https://www.paramountplus.com/?cbscidmt=sports&ftag=PPM-03-10ahh3j\" target=\"_blank\">Paramount+</a>)</p><h2>Get your footy fix with CBS Sports Golazo Network and more</h2><p>☀️ <strong>Morning Footy</strong> (Weekdays 8-10 a.m.): Join Golazo Network as it help fans get their day started on the right foot on the <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/watch/cbs-sports-golazo-network?ftag=CBS-03-10ade4e\" target=\"_blank\">network's flagship morning show</a> with highlights, interviews and the biggest soccer storylines. <a href=\"https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/morning-footy-a-daily-soccer-podcast-from-cbs/id1694386891\" target=\"_blank\">Morning Footy is also available in podcast form</a>, so you'll never have to miss an episode.</p><p>3️⃣ <strong>Attacking Third </strong>(Tuesday, Thursday): The leading women's soccer podcast and social brand is now a live studio show.

    "body": "<div>\n        <p>This past week in the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://cbssports.com/nfl/\">NFL</a> was one of the more wild ones I can remember. In fact, it was historical, as Sunday marked the first day where we saw multiple interceptions, blocked field goals and punts returned for touchdowns.</p><p>What was the biggest surprise of the week? To me, it was the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/ATL/atlanta-falcons/\">Atlanta Falcons</a> getting mauled by the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/CAR/carolina-panthers/\">Carolina Panthers</a>, 30-0. Or perhaps it was the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/LAR/los-angeles-rams/\">Los Angeles Rams</a> blowing a 19-point lead late in the second half. Or maybe it was <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/26695775/caleb-williams/\">Caleb Williams</a> dominating the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/DAL/dallas-cowboys/\">Dallas Cowboys</a>. That Cowboys defense may be the worst in the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://cbssports.com/nfl/\">NFL</a>! At least the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/TEN/tennessee-titans/\">Tennessee Titans</a> came through for us by not playing well. Brian Callahan's team not performing is just about the only thing we can rely on these days. </p><p>This week, we get a game in Ireland, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/2967590/micah-parsons/\">Micah Parsons</a> returns to Dallas and there's another Monday night doubleheader. Here's a look at what I'm thinking.

Did you know that the Vikings are 4-0 in international games? Now you do. </p><p>The Steelers are 2-5 against the spread in their past seven games, and I have concerns about this squad. If you win the turnover battle, 5-1, what do you expect the final score to be? A 14-point win? 20-point win? Try 21-14. The <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/NE/new-england-patriots/\">New England Patriots</a> lost four fumbles and threw one interception vs. the Steelers, and were still in position to tie the game late in the fourth quarter. That's incredibly concerning for Pittsburgh.</p>\n<p>As for the Vikings, they are riding high coming off a 48-10 victory against the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/CIN/cincinnati-bengals/\">Cincinnati Bengals</a>. <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/2261492/isaiah-rodgers/\">Isaiah Rodgers</a> scored two touchdowns on defense, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/2967536/jordan-mason/\">Jordan Mason</a> rushed for 116 yards and two touchdowns and <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/1907522/carson-wentz/\">Carson Wentz</a> threw for 173 yards and two touchdowns in his return to the starting lineup.

McCarthy</a> did not look like a legitimate NFL starter in his first two games, while Wentz has experience and motivation to resurrect his career under Kevin O'Connell. Steelers coach Mike Tomlin even <span><a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/news/mike-tomlin-explains-why-vikings-qb-carson-wentz-presents-challenge-to-steelers-certainly-has-our-attention/\" target=\"_blank\">basically admitted</a></span> he wish he was facing McCarthy instead of Wentz. </p><p><strong>The pick:</strong> Vikings -2.5<br /><strong>Projected score: </strong>Vikings 16-12</p><h2>Tennessee Titans at <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/HOU/houston-texans/\">Houston Texans</a> (-7.5)</h2><p><strong>Sunday, 1 p.m. ET (CBS, Stream on <a href=\"https://www.paramountplus.com/shows/nfl-on-cbs/?ftag=PPM-22-10bdd6c\" target=\"_blank\">Paramount+</a>)</strong></p>\n<p>I think you can make the argument that the Texans have been the most disappointing team in the AFC South this year. They are 0-3, and <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/3163079/c-j-stroud/\">C.J. Stroud</a> has really struggled. While the Texans may or may not be the most disappointing team in the AFC South, they aren't the <em>worst</em> team in the AFC South. That title is owned by the Titans.</p><p>Coach Brian Callahan is 3-17 in his Titans tenure, and just <span><a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/news/brian-callahan-gives-up-play-calling-duties-as-titans-look-to-dig-out-of-0-3-hole/\" target=\"_blank\">gave up play-calling duties</a></span> to the quarterbacks coach.

AND the Titans gave up a seventh-rounder in the deal as well. I mean, what?</p><p>The Texans-Titans rivalry is deeper than people think, but this is a great opportunity for the Texans to get back on track at home. </p><p><strong>The pick:</strong> Texans -7.5<br /><strong>Projected score: </strong>Texans 24-14</p><h2><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/WAS/washington-commanders/\">Washington Commanders</a> (-1.5) at Atlanta Falcons</h2><p><strong>Sunday, 1 p.m. ET (CBS, Stream on <a href=\"https://www.paramountplus.com/shows/nfl-on-cbs/?ftag=PPM-22-10bdd6c\" target=\"_blank\">Paramount+</a>)</strong></p>\n<p>I'm going against logic here. The Falcons suffered what was probably the most embarrassing loss of Week 3 vs. the Panthers, while the Commanders coasted to an easy win against the Las Vegas Raiders with <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/1880862/marcus-mariota/\">Marcus Mariota</a> under center.

I went back and watched all of his pass attempts vs. the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/LAC/los-angeles-chargers/\">Los Angeles Chargers</a>, and while I'm no quarterback expert, I thought his mechanics were off. Going off-platform when it wasn't necessary, a weird jump-pass and multiple overthrows. That's fixable. Nix completed a season-low 14 passes on a season-low 25 attempts for a season-low 153 yards. He missed three deep balls that could have been touchdowns -- meaning the Broncos are one completion and one bogus flag in Indy away from being undefeated.
