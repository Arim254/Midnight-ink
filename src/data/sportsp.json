    "body": "<div>\n        <p>The field for the NFL survivor pool continues to thin, and now Week 5 of the schedule features the first round of byes, which will have some players scrambling to find a suitable team to stay alive. Teams on their bye include the Falcons, Bears, Packers and Steelers. Among the SportsLine models biggest favorites to choose from this week are the Bills (-8.5), Lions (-10.5) and Cardinals (-7.5), although many survivor pool players have already used teams like the Bills and Lions already. </p><p>The latest Week 5 NFL odds show six other games with a Week 5 NFL spread of 3.5 points or more, including 49ers vs. Rams (-7) on Thursday night, Vikings vs. Browns (+3.5), Texans vs. Ravens (+1.5), Raiders vs. Colts (-7), Broncos vs. Eagles (-3.5) and Buccaneers vs. Seahawks (-3.5). Those are the games many NFL survivor players will be targeting, but among those favorites, which ones bring the most value in NFL survivor pools? Before finalizing any Week 5 NFL survivor picks, <a href=\"https://www.sportsline.com/insiders/nfl-survivor-pool-week-5-2025-pick-from-advanced-computer-model/#ttag=10022025_agg_cbssports_picks_football_nfl_model_survivorpool\" target=\"_blank\">see which team the red-hot SportsLine Projection Model just went all-in on</a>.</p><p><em>New users can also target the latest <span><a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/betting/news/underdog/\" target=\"_blank\">Underdog promo code</a></span>, good for <a href=\"https://martech.cbssports.com/bt/redirect/prod?b=underdog&c=dfs\" target=\"_blank\">$100 in site credits when you play $5 with the promo code CBSSPORTS2</a></em> in select states.</p><p>The model, which simulates every NFL game 10,000 times, is up well over $7,000 for $100 players on top-rated <a href=\"https://www.sportsline.com/nfl/picks/\" target=\"_blank\">NFL picks</a> since its inception. The model is on a sizzling 39-19 run on top-rated picks dating back to 2024. Anybody following its <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/betting/news/nfl/\" target=\"_blank\">NFL betting</a> picks at <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/betting/news/best-betting-apps/\" target=\"_blank\">sportsbooks</a> and on <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/betting/news/best-betting-apps/\" target=\"_blank\">betting sites</a> could have seen strong returns. The model can be used to crush the survivor pool format, which calls for picking one team to win each week but never using the same team twice. It survived through Week 1 by calling the Commanders over the Giants, Week 2 with the Ravens over the Browns, Week 3 with Bills over Dolphins and Week 4 with the Broncos over the Bengals.</p><p>Now, it has turned its attention to the latest Week 5 NFL schedule and locked in its Week 5 survivor pool pick. <a href=\"https://www.sportsline.com/insiders/nfl-survivor-pool-week-5-2025-pick-from-advanced-computer-model/#ttag=10022025_agg_cbssports_picks_football_nfl_model_survivorpool\" target=\"_blank\">You can only see who the model is backing this week at SportsLine</a>. </p><p><em>New users can also target the </em><span><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/betting/news/draftkings-promo-code/\"><em>DraftKings promo code</em></a></span><em>, which offers </em><a href=\"https://martech.cbssports.com/bt/redirect/prod?b=draftkings&c=sport\" target=\"_blank\"><em>$200 in bonus bets instantly if your bet wins</em></a>:</p><h3>Top Week 5 NFL survivor pool predictions </h3><p>In Week 5 of the 2025 NFL season, the model is shying away from the Indianapolis Colts as they take on the Las Vegas Raiders. The Colts are 7-point and -325 money-line favorites, as one of the home favorites in the Week 5 lines, but are coming off a 27-20 loss to the Los Angeles Rams. The Raiders, meanwhile, despite a 1-3 start, have shown improvement and are coming off a 25-24 loss to Chicago as a last-minute field goal attempt to win was blocked. </p><p>Fading Indianapolis may also be part of a greater NFL survivor pool strategy, which sees the Colts play a struggling Titans team in a couple of weeks. The model projects the Colts to win 74% of the time, which is lower than other teams this week, making Indianapolis a team to avoid in NFL survivor pool picks. <a href=\"https://www.sportsline.com/insiders/nfl-survivor-pool-week-5-2025-pick-from-advanced-computer-model/#ttag=10022025_agg_cbssports_picks_football_nfl_model_survivorpool\" target=\"_blank\">See which team to pick instead here</a>. </p><p><em>You can also use the latest </em><span><a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/betting/news/fanduel-promo-code/\" target=\"_blank\"><em>FanDuel promo code</em></a></span><em> to </em><a href=\"https://martech.cbssports.com/bt/redirect/prod?b=fanduel&c=sport\" target=\"_blank\"><em>get $300 in bonus bets instantly</em></a><em>:</em></p><h3>How to make Week 5 NFL survivor pool picks </h3><p>Instead, the model is confidently backing a team many have not used in survivor pools to win outright in well over 70% of simulations.

The Bills look to move to 5-0 on the season and, if they do, can grab a three-game lead within the division. Buffalo is a 7.5-point favorite over the Patriots (2-2). In other games involving AFC East foes, the Dolphins (1-3) are 1.5-point favorites against the Panthers (1-3) at Carolina, while the Jets (0-4) are 2.5-point underdogs against the visiting Cowboys (1-2-1) in the latest Week 5 NFL odds. </p><p>How should you handle those NFL games and optimize what to bet on NFL in Week 5?

He became the ninth player in <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://cbssports.com/nfl/\">NFL</a> history to rush for 2,000 yards in a season. Barkley's league-leading 2,005 yards on 345 rushing attempts were eighth on the all-time list. His 5.8 yards per carry were fourth in the NFL. Barkley added 278 yards on 33 receptions to lead the NFL with 2,283 yards from scrimmage (combined rushing and receiving yards). His 15 total touchdowns (13 rushing and two receiving) were tied for seventh in the league.</p><p>Barkley would have had a legitimate chance at breaking Eric Dickerson's single-season record of 2,105 yards rushing set in 1984 if the Eagles hadn't rested him in the regular-season finale against the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/NYG/new-york-giants/\">New York Giants</a>. His 2,504 yards rushing combined in the regular and postseason are an NFL record.</p><p>The Eagles surprised the NFL world in March by extending the three-year, $37.75 million contract, averaging $12,583,333 per year (worth as much as $46.75 million through incentives and salary escalators), Barkley received during 2024 free agency. The 2024 NFL Offensive Player of the Year's contract was set to expire after the 2026 season. </p><p>Barkley became the NFL's first $20 million-per-year running back with a two-year, $41.2 million contract extension worth up to $56.2 million through incentives and salary escalators. The deal has a running back-record $36 million fully guaranteed at signing.</p>\n<p>The 2025 season has been a different story. Barkley has gotten off to an extremely slow start. He is tied for 20th in the NFL with 237 yards rushing through four games. Barkley's 77 rushing attempts are tied for the second most in the league. He is averaging a career-low 3.1 yards per carry. Barkley's season high is the 88 yards rushing he had against the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/KC/kansas-city-chiefs/\">Kansas City Chiefs</a> in Week 2. His longest run has been 16 yards.</p><p>At this stage last season, Barkley's 435 yards rushing were third in the NFL. He was averaging 6.0 yards per carry. Barkley already had two 100-yard games. Two of his 73 carries were for more than 50 yards.</p><h2>Tough act to follow</h2><p>Some sort of decline in Barkley's production was to be expected. That's been the case with the other eight running backs in the season after hitting the 2,000-yard rushing mark. None of the eight were able to crack 1,500 yards rushing the next season. Barry Sanders came the closest with 1,491 yards on the ground in 1998.</p>\n<p>The other eight cumulatively averaged 5.6 yards per carry when rushing for 2,000 yards. It was 4.3 yards per carry in the following season. <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/517568/adrian-petersons/\">Adrian Peterson's</a> 4.5 yards per carry in 2012 is the highest when he had 1,266 yards rushing while playing 14 games. Nobody in this group won the rushing title the next season.</p><p>The other eight were still heavily featured in the following season, averaging just under 21 carries for a little less than 89 yards per game. It was preceded by slightly more than 23 carries for just under 130 yards per game.

According to the NFL's Next Gen Stats, 32.47% of Barkley's carries are with eight or more defenders in the box. It was 20.58% last year. By contrast, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/2061188/derrick-henry/\">Derrick Henry</a>, who was second in the NFL with 1,921 yards rushing, had eight or more defenders in the box 33.23% of the time.</p><p>Philadelphia's offensive line hasn't been nearly as effective. According to Pro Football Reference, Barkley had a running back-best 3.8 yards rushing before contact per attempt in 2024. It's down to 1.7 yards this season. The league average in 2025 is 2.4 yards. </p><p>Health of the offensive line is a contributing factor. Various injuries seem to be taking a toll on three-time Pro Bowl offensive guard <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/2253017/landon-dickerson/\">Landon Dickerson</a>. Perennial All-Pro right tackle <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/1700429/lane-johnson/\">Lane Johnson</a> has exited the last two games because of injury.</p><p>Barkley isn't making the most of his rushing opportunities either. He is averaging minus 0.53 yards rushing over expected per attempt, according to Next Gen Stats. Barkley ranked second in this metric last season with 1.61 yards rushing over expected per attempt.</p><h2>Run or done?</h2><p>The good news for the Eagles is being one of two <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://cbssports.com/nfl/teams/\">NFL teams</a>, along with the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/BUF/buffalo-bills/\">Buffalo Bills</a>, that are still undefeated with a 4-0 record despite Barkley's struggles. Without stellar special teams play, the Eagles could be 2-2. </p><p>It's crucial for Barkley and the running game to eventually get untracked for the Eagles to have a realistic chance of repeating as Super Bowl champions. Philadelphia is more reliant on running the ball than other NFL teams. The 621 rushing attempts in 2024 were easily the NFL's most. Philadelphia's 448 pass attempts were also the fewest. It's been the same recipe in 2025. Philadelphia's 101 pass attempts are last in the league while having the second most rushing attempts with 131.</p><p>Barkley may have put it best after Sunday's 31-25 win over the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/TB/tampa-bay-buccaneers/\">Tampa Bay Buccaneers</a>. \"The way we played in the second half this week and the first half last week -- especially on offense -- we're going to have a hard time winning football games,\" Barkley said. \"We've just got to continue to improve, continue to jell, find, I hate using this word 'identity' in the offense and the running game.\"</p>\n            </div>"

Team president Brad Stevens \"can't predict it,\" he <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://youtu.be/9UdeBP63Zrs?si=69UfK7S1KI9vj6Ix&t=419\">said Monday</a>. Boucher is the most accomplished of the bunch, but, with his frame, the gig might be more of a punishment than a prize. Then again, in Joe Mazzulla's world, punishment <em>is</em> a prize. He'll have you running because you <em>won </em>a drill, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_1lbqJqJX78\">per Derrick White's podcast</a>.\t</p><p>For Boston's \"unproven players,\" as Stevens called them, this season is anything but a gap year, regardless of whether or not <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nba/players/2268018/jayson-tatum/\">Jayson Tatum</a> makes an <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.nbcsportsboston.com/nba/boston-celtics/jayson-tatum-injury-recovery-achilles-surgery-unprecedented/735247/\">unprecedented</a> comeback. Minutes are up for grabs, and good minutes could lead to a role on the next great Celtics team. If this iteration is going to halfway decent, though, it will need several pleasant surprises. And being halfway decent might not be in Boston's best interest anyway. Mazzulla <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6MaxXXnq_c&t=137s\">said</a> he's glad that Tatum \"had to go to a dark place,\" and, given what a high draft pick could mean for its future, maybe the whole franchise needs to make that visit.</p>\n<h2>The State of Play</h2><p><strong>Last year: </strong>After winning the 2024 title, some uninspired play in January <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://x.com/ringer/status/1882829027930685535\">felt like a calamity</a>, but overall the Celtics' formula held up in the regular season: They finished 61-21, with the league's third-best record, second-best offense, fourth-best defense and second-best net rating. Despite <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nba/players/1685257/jrue-holiday/\">Jrue Holiday</a> dealing with an extremely unpleasant hand injury (\"mallet finger\" in his right pinky) in February and straining his right hamstring in the playoffs, and despite Porziņģis' strange illness, Boston looked like a lock to at least make the Eastern Conference finals. After taking care of the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nba/teams/ORL/orlando-magic/\">Magic</a> in five games, though, a combination of missed 3s and blown leads doomed them in the second round against the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nba/teams/NY/new-york-knicks/\">New York Knicks</a>. They lost the series in six games, and while <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://youtu.be/adPuUn64RBE?si=FfnNFuv6mIkDRx0u&t=507\">Tatum still thinks about what might have been</a> if he hadn't torn his Achilles late in Game 4, they were all but certainly about to go down 3-1 regardless of what happened on that possession.</p><p><strong>The offseason: </strong>To lower their payroll, the Celtics traded Holiday and Porziņģis (and, eventually, gave up two second-round picks to get rid of <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nba/players/2018910/georges-niang/\">Georges Niang</a>, who was acquired in the Porziņģis trade). They were also rumored to be shopping <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nba/players/2938080/anfernee-simons/\">Anfernee Simons</a>, who was acquired for Holiday and is on a $27.7 million expiring contract. Initially, they were supposed to get two second-round picks from the Blazers in the Holiday deal, but, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nba/news/jrue-holiday-trade-revised-as-celtics-wont-get-draft-picks-from-blazers-after-reported-review-of-medicals/\">after Portland reviewed his medicals</a>, it became a one-for-one swap. They drafted Hugo González with the No. 28 pick and traded the No. 32 pick to the Blazers for four future second-round picks, two of which they used to select Amari Williams (No. 46) and <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nba/players/3177703/max-shulga/\">Max Shulga</a> (No. 57). In free agency, they quickly signed ex-Timberwolves Luka Garza (two years, $5.3 million) and <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nba/players/26777945/josh-minott/\">Josh Minott</a> (two years, $5 million, team option) and added ex-Raptor Chris Boucher (one year, $3.3 million) about a month later. Since they wanted to get under the second apron, they never really had a chance to re-sign Horford or Kornet, who left for Golden State and San Antonio, respectively.</p><p><strong>Las Vegas over/under: </strong>40.5 wins, per <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/betting/news/betmgm-promo-code/\">BetMGM</a></p><h2>The Conversation</h2><p><strong>Celtics believer:</strong> As tragic as Jayson Tatum's injury was, I have consulted with the department of silver linings and prepared a statement: The Celtics had to cut salary anyway. The 2025-26 season will be a respite from the high stakes and high expectations that made much of the previous one feel like a slog. Whether Tatum comes back this season -- <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://x.com/KDTrey5/status/1972310310724960589\">it's looking more and more likely!</a> -- or next, he'll be joining a team that has been forced to evolve in his absence. The Celtics will be faster, they'll be more creative in the halfcourt and his teammates old and new will have improved individually. 😎</p>\n<p><strong>Celtics skeptic:</strong> I wish I could talk myself into the Celtics \"evolving\" without their best player. They'll change, for sure, but not for the better. Even if Tatum were 100% healthy right this moment, he'd be returning to an environment that can't function the way that it used to. They dumped Jrue Holiday and Kristaps Porziņģis! Al Horford and Luke Kornet walked! Dating back to its 2022 Finals run, Boston's roster construction afforded the coaching staff lots of luxuries. It could play double-big or super small. It could go 5-out without sacrificing size. It could hide a shot-blocker on a non-shooting wing and stick Tatum on a big man. <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nba/players/2844730/derrick-white/\">Derrick White</a> wasn't its only all-world defender at the point of attack. It could switch as well as any team in the league. Now all of that is gone, and what remains is a shallow team that will be overmatched defensively. If you thought a 61-win season was a slog, I'm so sorry for what you're about to experience. </p><p><strong>Celtics believer: </strong><a href=\"https://test.getyarn.io/yarn-clip/71510a81-885a-43bf-bbf4-6e48ee3817b2\" target=\"_blank\">You can stuff your sorries in a sack, mister</a>! I have no expectations when it comes to wins and losses, and I'm more than prepared for the Celtics to have their struggles. Superstars like Tatum make the game easier for everyone around them, so, naturally, it's going to be harder without him. In the big picture, though, is that really such a bad thing? This is a rare chance for a perennial contender to temporarily act like a rebuilding team. Throw <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nba/players/3141901/baylor-scheierman/\">Baylor Scheierman</a> and Hugo González into the fire! Challenge Josh Minott and Luka Garza to earn the roles they didn't get in Minnesota! When <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nba/teams/SA/san-antonio-spurs/\">Spurs</a> players were deferring too much, Gregg Popovich would tell them, \"Get your name in the paper!\" That should be the message Mazzulla is sending, even to the more established players. Let's see what <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nba/players/2202365/jaylen-brown/\">Jaylen Brown</a> can do as a No. 1 option. Let's see what Anfernee Simons can do with a featured role on a good team. Let's see how much usage <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nba/players/2268374/payton-pritchard/\">Payton Pritchard</a> can handle.</p><p><strong>Celtics skeptic: </strong>I am stunned that you just referred to this year's Celtics as a \"good team.\" They have a handful of good offensive players, but you're vastly overestimating how far that's going to get them. The problem with the development angle is that it's not like the next Tatum or Brown is on the bench, waiting for an opportunity to spread his wings. Their young guys are complementary players, and I can't think of a single player on the team who needs to hear Pop's message. Pritchard and Simons are going to get shots up, and I think Brown was completely correct to <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://youtu.be/REr41iFFQu0?si=CZ1KoUhnFSlVakV-&t=279\">say that he needs to trust his teammates and play good basketball</a>. I really hope he sticks to that plan and improves as a playmaker for others this season, but I'm honestly terrified to see what happens with his shot selection. Let me guess: You think he'll play every game like <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://x.com/Timi_093/status/1923014469250130393\">Game 5 against the Knicks</a>, right?</p>\n<p><strong>Celtics believer: </strong>I said \"good team,\" not \"championship contender.\" I see them pushing the pace, trying to break the record for 3-point rate and putting up a ton of points. If the offense is as efficient as I think it will be, then as long as they aren't horrendous on defense they can still make the playoffs in the East. As for Brown: I don't expect 26-8-12 on a nightly basis, but there's no reason the process can't be similar. He is in Year 10, he's turning 29 this month, he's already won a championship and he's on a supermax contract. He knows the deal. I'm not saying he won't take a questionable jumper from time to time, but he won't give anybody Antoine Walker flashbacks. I'm sure he's already thinking about Tatum coming back in the second half of the season, and he'll want that to be seamless. </p><p><strong>Celtics skeptic: </strong>The scenario you're imagining, in which the team is just competitive enough to justify bringing Tatum back, is exactly what I'm afraid of! As low as I am on this version of the Celtics, I'm actually pretty bullish on their chances of building another title contender around Tatum. That means they can't afford to take any risks when it comes to his health, and it means they must bottom out right now. If you want this franchise to bounce back as quickly as possible, you should be rooting for Brown and White to miss time due to short-term, non-serious injuries. You should be rooting for Simons to either be productive enough that they can dump his contract or be straight-up harmful to Boston's chances of winning games. And you should absolutely not be deluding yourself into thinking this is still a playoff team.g</p>\n            </div>"

    "body": "<div>\n        <p>On Tuesday night in Las Vegas, the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/wnba/teams/IND/indiana-fever/\">Indiana Fever's</a> 2025 campaign finally came to an end with <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/wnba/news/aces-oust-fever-in-game-5-chelsea-grays-ot-heroics-send-las-vegas-back-to-third-wnba-finals-in-four-years/live/\" target=\"_blank\">a 107-98 loss</a> to the Las Vegas Aces in overtime of a deciding Game 5 of the WNBA semifinals. Improbably, almost illogically, this Fever team was only five minutes away from making it back to the WNBA Finals for the first time since 2015.</p><p>It's official: The Fever aren't just relevant again, they're legit contenders, and if they keep their core together, will be for years to come. </p><p>None of this would have seemed surprising at the outset of the season -- the team had championship hopes and high external expectations. But nothing went according to plan for Indiana this summer. </p><p><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/wnba/players/1201037/dewanna-bonner/\">DeWanna Bonner</a>, the team's marquee offseason acquisition, was moved to the bench three games into the season, and a couple of weeks later began missing games due to \"personal reasons.\" The team waived her on June 25. The six-time All-Star later said she \"felt the fit did not work out.\" </p>\n<p>The injury bug ravaged the team's depth. On Aug. 7, hours after the trade deadline, guards <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/wnba/players/1594733/sydney-colson/\">Sydney Colson</a> (ACL tear) and Aari MacDonald (right foot fracture) both incurred season-ending injuries. On Aug. 17, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/wnba/players/26677770/sophie-cunningham/\">Sophie Cunningham</a> tore her right MCL in a fluke in-game collision. A few days later, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/wnba/players/29714655/chloe-bibby/\">Chloe Bibby</a> lost for the season with a left knee injury. </p><p>But nothing hurt more than the ongoing injury woes of superstar point guard <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/wnba/players/29362921/caitlin-clark/\">Caitlin Clark</a>, who was expected to contend for MVP this year. Instead, she played only 13 of 44 regular-season games. It was an <a href=\"http://google.com/search?q=caitlin+clark+disaster+cbs+eports&sca_esv=66b3c422d690258a&rlz=1C5GCCM_en&ei=N6DMaJmBLZGq5NoP_vfMiAM&ved=0ahUKEwjZ-Om9xeOPAxURFVkFHf47EzEQ4dUDCBE&uact=5&oq=caitlin+clark+disaster+cbs+eports&gs_lp=Egxnd3Mtd2l6LXNlcnAiIWNhaXRsaW4gY2xhcmsgZGlzYXN0ZXIgY2JzIGVwb3J0czIEECEYCkjRCFDMAViQCHACeACQAQGYAd0BoAGqBqoBBTQuMi4xuAEDyAEA-AEBmAIGoAK4A8ICDhAAGIAEGLADGIYDGIoFwgILEAAYgAQYsAMYogTCAgsQABiwAxiiBBiJBcICCBAAGIAEGKIEwgIIEAAYogQYiQWYAwDiAwUSATEgQIgGAZAGBZIHAzMuM6AHtxqyBwMxLjO4B7IDwgcFMS40LjHIBws&sclient=gws-wiz-serp\" target=\"_blank\">excruciating follow-up</a> to her record-smashing rookie season. </p><p>The adversity even continued in the playoffs, with star Kelsey Mitchell leaving Game 5 on Tuesday night with extreme cramps and Aliyah Boston fouling out before overtime. </p>\n<p>And yet, despite it all, the Fever would not stop fighting. The franchise had its first winning record since 2015. The team made the playoffs as the No. 6 seed, hosted its first playoff game since 2016 and won its first playoff game and playoff series since 2015.</p><p>The year could have broken the Fever. Instead, it seems it made them even stronger. </p><p>\"They kept getting back up. Collectively. And I think that oftentimes in sport, we see one that might, two that might, but they kept getting back up collectively,\" Fever coach Stephanie White told reporters after the season-ending loss. \"There's no circumstance that we went through on or off the floor -- because, because we had some off the floor stuff too -- that they blinked, that they held their heads down, that they didn't just stand tall and face head on.</p>\n<p>\"They continued to pour into us as coaches. They continued to allow us to push them on days and moments when they could have very easily just given up. They loved on us, they loved on one another, and it just it makes it really special and it sucks that it's over.\"</p><p>If Clark can return healthy for 2026, the Fever's ceiling will even be higher than it seemed at the outset of the 2025 season. That's a terrifying notion for the rest of the WNBA.</p><h2>Clark learned invaluable lessons about caring for her body</h2><p>Clark didn't miss a single game in her four years at Iowa or her rookie year in the WNBA. She was an iron woman who never had to face the frustration of nagging injuries. So this season truly tested her in ways she had never been tested before.</p>\n<p>\"I've never been through anything like this, and I think that's probably why it's been so hard,\" Clark told Sue Bird on her podcast, \"<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ikAYbgYTGT0\" target=\"_blank\">Bird's Eye View</a>\" earlier this summer.</p><p>Clark first got injured on May 24, just four games into the season, when she strained her left quad in a game against the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/wnba/teams/NYL/new-york-liberty/\">New York Liberty</a>. She returned on June 14 and played the next five games before again going back on the injury report with a left quad injury. On July 9 she returned once more, but only lasted four games until she suffered a right groin injury. Eventually, a left bone bruise during her recovery ended her season.</p><p>She told Bird that she didn't really understand how to listen to her body and deal with pain when her quad first started hurting, and the stop-and-start nature of her attempted return to play only made things worse.</p>\n<p>\"When I first was feeling pain, I didn't understand it,\" she continued. \"I was like, 'Am I just tight? Am I just getting old? Do I need to hit a stretch? Do I need to get a little rub out? Do I need some icy hot? Like, what's going on here?\"</p>\n<p>Clark told Bird that as frustrating as this season has been, it has helped her learn how to recognize pain, properly rehab and stay both patient and locked in with her team and herself during the recovery process. She's grown as a professional, and will better be able to take care of herself in the future when she inevitably has to deal with injuries again. Plus, she has gained empathy for other players who have gone through similar -- or worse -- struggles.</p><p>\"I think it has given me really good perspective on what a lot of my teammates ... have had to go through,\" she told Bird.</p>\n<p>Everyone wanted Clark to be on the court and healthy this year. But she's gained invaluable insights from being on the sidelines.</p><p>\"I know whether it's this year, whether it's next year, and even throughout my career, I'm going to be very thankful for this moment. I know this is going to help me understand my body better,\" she said.</p><h2><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/wnba/players/29101293/aliyah-boston/\">Aliyah Boston</a> and <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/wnba/players/26677896/kelsey-mitchell/\">Kelsey Mitchell</a> both grew on and off the court</h2><p>When you look at the Fever's injury woes, it's easy to wonder how in the world they managed to still do so much winning during this year. But the truth is, they had two healthy <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/wnba/teams/WES/west-allstars/\">All-Stars</a> all season: Aliyah Boston and Kelsey Mitchell.</p>\n<p>And while Boston and Mitchell both certainly would have rather Clark be with them on the court, her absence allowed them opportunities to expand their games and leadership styles. </p><p>In her eighth season -- all in Indiana -- Mitchell averaged a career-high in points (20.2), PER (19.9), and win shares (5.6). She also set several Fever franchise records, including most games with 30+ points (11), most 20+ point games in a season (19) and single-season total points (890).</p><p>She even had to play point guard one game due to the depleted roster, something she hadn't done since her days at Ohio State. She said that being pushed out of her comfort zone that way \"brings out the vulnerable side of me, the leadership in which I need to keep getting better and keep growing at.\"</p>\n<p>During the semifinal series against the Aces, White praised Mitchell's \"ability to accept expanded roles for us.\"</p><p>\"She's always been a great scorer, and now we put the ball in her hands a little bit, and we use her as a facilitator as well as a scorer,\" White said. \"You know, there are times where we have to put her on different match-ups on the defensive end so that she can get stops for us. So really, she doesn't have any rest anytime she's on the floor, and she's on the floor a lot. So I think you've seen her her leadership, she leads by example. I think you've seen her confidence. I think you've seen her ability to be a face of a franchise that's that she's been through the ebbs and flows. I'm happy for her.\"</p><p>Boston, meanwhile, has the most points (15) and assists (3.7) in her career this season, and her advanced stats show even more improvement in her third year in the league -- she has a career high in win shares (7.2), assists percentage (21.3%) and usage percentage (21.9%). </p>\n<p>Without Clark, she turned into more of a facilitator, an evolution that Clark praised.</p><p>\"She's so strong, like people don't realize how strong she really is, and and then at the same time, like she's such a great facilitator for our team,\" Clark told Bird about Boston. \"Especially a lot when I've been out this year, like, she's been initiating a lot of our offense. We feel very comfortable being able to do that, we trust her. She's a really high IQ Player. She's a good passer, she knows what to get us into, and understands her teammates really well.\"</p><p>White also noticed that Boston's communication and focus has improved during the team's trials and tribulations.</p><p>\"Throughout the course of everything we've gone through this season, she's been great in every facet. Her communication on both ends of the floor is really good, her ability to connect people, and her ability to stay locked in is what stands out to me,\" <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://wibc.com/711277/fever-using-aliyah-bostons-leadership-and-communication-to-try-and-overcome-recent-injuries/\">White said</a>.</p><p>\"This has been my best year,\" Boston said on Tuesday night after the loss to the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/wnba/teams/LVA/las-vegas-aces/\">Aces</a>. \"I feel like I'm super proud of myself .. adjusting and adapting.\"</p><h2>This year proved Indiana is marquee destination</h2><p>Like most teams in the WNBA, the Fever very few players under contract heading into 2026. All of the veterans on their roster only signed contracts through 2025, anticipating the increase in the salary cap that will come when the new CBA is signed. The Fever will have to try to cut new deals with unrestricted free agents like Mitchell, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/wnba/players/2130759/natasha-howard/\">Natasha Howard</a>, Sophie Cunningham, Damiras Dantas and <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/wnba/players/28850706/lexie-hull/\">Lexie Hull</a> if they want to keep a lot of this year's team together. So it's going to be a busy and stressful few months for the front office.</p><p>However, the Fever have one advantage that other teams do not: Two All-Stars on cost-controlled rookie contracts, in Boston and Clark.</p><p>That means the two best and most important pieces of their team are already signed, and they will come at a bargain, too. Life is pretty sweet in Indianapolis.</p><p>But this tough season also set the front office up for success in other ways, too, that should make free agency much easier than it has any right being. First off, the fan base proved its loyalty; even when Clark was not in the lineup, the fans in Indianapolis showed up to Gainbridge Fieldhouse in droves. Additionally, the franchise impressed fans and players alike with their fantastic hosting job during All-Star, and while Bonner's exit early season could have been a bad omen, the many hardship players that have been signed to the roster and thrived this season send a signal that the vibes are good behind the scenes in Fever land, too.</p><p>Plus, the way that White and the rest of the coaching staff kept the team together, positive, and competitive throughout all of the adversity that came the their way has to be enticing to players across the league -- and has to make it easier to re-sign their current players, if the front office wants to.</p><p>\"Coach pulled out the best in us. She kept pushing us,\" <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/wnba/players/2130788/odyssey-sims/\">Odyssey Sims</a>, who joined the Fever on a hardship contract in August and ended up being a key member of their postseason run, told reporters. \"Coach kept telling us we have more to give. We have more to give, so I'm super proud just to be a part of this group.\"</p><p>One thing is certain: The Fever are proud of what they accomplished in 2025, but are far from satisfied. </p><p>\"A championship is always on my mind,\" Boston said.  \"We got a taste of it -- Game 5 semifinals -- and now we want the real thing. That's honestly going to be our mindset coming in for next year. I'm super excited going into this offseason. Time to put a lot of work in. I'm just getting ready to come back and win.\"</p>\n            </div>"

But we  just gotta play within the white lines. If we do that, if we play our  game, it won't be close.\"</p>\n<p>There is some cause for Pavia to be as confident in his team as he is, as Vanderbilt has gotten off to a 5-0 start featuring wins over <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/teams/VATECH/virginia-tech-hokies/\">Virginia Tech</a> and <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/teams/SC/south-carolina-gamecocks/\">South Carolina</a> with Pavia playing at a level that has put him in the early conversation for the Heisman Trophy.
