Through three weeks, the Patriots haven't gained much ground at 1-2, while the Bills have taken firm control of the division at 3-0. Originally, the Week 4 matchup against the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/CAR/carolina-panthers/\">Carolina Panthers</a> was seen as yet another step for the Patriots in their goal of challenging the Bills. The Panthers, however, made a statement of their own in Week 3 by defeating the Atlanta Falcons 30-0. This week's matchup is far from a sure thing for New England. With some NFL survivor pools already starting to thin down, its time to lock in Week 4 NFL survivor picks if you haven't already.</p><p>The latest Week 4 NFL odds show six games with a Week 4 NFL spread of 5.5 points or more, including Saints vs. Bills (-16.5), Browns vs. Lions (-8.5), Titans vs. Texans (-7), Chargers vs. Giants (+6), Packers vs. Cowboys (+6.5) and Bengals vs. Broncos (-7). Those are the games many NFL survivor players will be targeting, but among those favorites, which ones bring the most value in NFL survivor pools? </p><p><em>Before finalizing any Week 4 NFL survivor picks, </em><a href=\"https://www.sportsline.com/insiders/nfl-survivor-pool-week-4-2025-pick-from-advanced-computer-model/#ttag=09252025_agg_cbssports_picks_football_nfl_model_survivorpool\" target=\"_blank\"><em>see which team the red-hot SportsLine Projection Model just went all-in on</em></a><em>.</em></p><p>The model, which simulates every NFL game 10,000 times, is up well over $7,000 for $100 players on top-rated <a href=\"https://www.sportsline.com/nfl/picks/\" target=\"_blank\">NFL picks</a> since its inception. The model is on a sizzling 39-19 run on top-rated picks dating back to 2024.

The model can be used to crush the survivor pool format, which calls for picking one team to win each week but never using the same team twice. It survived through Week 1 by calling the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/WAS/washington-commanders/\">Commanders</a> over the Giants, Week 2 with the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/BAL/baltimore-ravens/\">Ravens</a> over the Browns, and Week 3 with Bills over <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/MIA/miami-dolphins/\">Dolphins</a>.</p><p>Now, it has turned its attention to the latest Week 4 NFL schedule and locked in its Week 4 survivor pool pick. <a href=\"https://www.sportsline.com/insiders/nfl-survivor-pool-week-4-2025-pick-from-advanced-computer-model/#ttag=09252025_agg_cbssports_picks_football_nfl_model_survivorpool\" target=\"_blank\">You can only see who the model is backing this week at SportsLine</a>. </p><p><em>New users can also target the </em><span><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/betting/news/draftkings-promo-code/\"><em>DraftKings promo code</em></a></span><em>, which offers </em><a href=\"https://martech.cbssports.com/bt/redirect/prod?b=draftkings&c=sport\" target=\"_blank\"><em>$200 in bonus bets instantly plus over $200 off NFL Sunday Ticket</em></a><em>:</em></p><h3>Top Week 4 NFL survivor pool predictions </h3><p>In Week 4 of the 2025 NFL season, the model is shying away from the Patriots as they take on the Carolina Panthers. The Patriots are 5.5-point and -244 money-line favorites, as one of the home favorites in the Week 4 lines, but are coming off a 21-14 loss to the Pittsburgh Steelers. The Panthers, meanwhile, got into the win column in a big way by thrashing the Falcons. Fading Carolina prior to that game was a popular NFL survivor strategy. </p><p>The model, however, projects this to be a one-score game, and only has New England winning 58% of the time, which is lower than many home teams this week. Drake Maye has had mixed results in three games and is still getting acclimated as the Patriots' starting quarterback. He has played in 16 games over the course of two seasons, and is completing 68% of his passes for 3,061 yards with 20 touchdowns and 12 interceptions. For the season, he has completed 72.6% of his passes for 785 yards and five touchdowns with two interceptions. <a href=\"https://www.sportsline.com/insiders/nfl-survivor-pool-week-4-2025-pick-from-advanced-computer-model/#ttag=09252025_agg_cbssports_picks_football_nfl_model_survivorpool\" target=\"_blank\">See which team to pick instead here</a>. </p><p><em>You can also use the latest </em><span><a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/betting/news/fanduel-promo-code/\" target=\"_blank\"><em>FanDuel promo code</em></a></span><em> to </em><a href=\"https://martech.cbssports.com/bt/redirect/prod?b=fanduel&c=sport\" target=\"_blank\"><em>get $300 in bonus bets instantly</em></a><em>:</em></p><h3>How to make Week 4 NFL survivor pool picks </h3><p>Instead, the model is confidently backing a team many have not used in survivor pools to win outright in more than 70% of simulations.

However, prior to the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/CLE/cleveland-browns/\">Cleveland Browns</a> scooping up Sanders with the 144th pick, the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/BAL/baltimore-ravens/\">Baltimore Ravens</a> had interest in selecting the former Colorado star three picks earlier, but Sanders <span><a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/news/browns-qb-shedeur-sanders-told-the-ravens-he-didnt-want-them-to-draft-him-per-report/\" target=\"_blank\">reportedly wasn't interested in joining the Ravens</a></span>.</p><p>On Monday's episode of the \"New Heights\" podcast, Colorado coach Deion Sanders <a href=\"https://x.com/newheightshow/status/1970115906463510929\" target=\"_blank\">weighed in on the report</a> and explained why his son wasn't keen on the idea of serving as a backup to Ravens star <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/2181169/lamar-jackson/\">Lamar Jackson</a>.</p><p>\"How in the world can somebody fault him for saying or thinking, 'Why in the world would I go back up Lamar (Jackson) for 10 more years?'\" Sanders said. \"I've never sat on the bench and said, 'Well, I learned a lot today.'\"</p><p>The Ravens ultimately ended up passing on Shedeur after speaking with him and selected Alabama A&M offensive lineman <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/26715280/carson-vinson/\">Carson Vinson</a> with the 141st pick. </p><p>Deion Sanders revealed that the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/PHI/philadelphia-eagles/\">Philadelphia Eagles</a> were also interested in potentially drafting his son. Ultimately, the Browns ended up nabbing Shedeur Sanders despite already selecting former Oregon signal-caller <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/3121534/dillon-gabriel/\">Dillon Gabriel</a> in the third round.</p>\n<p>Sanders is listed as the third quarterback on the Browns' depth chart behind starter <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/1250697/joe-flacco/\">Joe Flacco</a> and Gabriel. </p><p>If Sanders had landed with the Ravens, it's true he likely wouldn't have seen the field much unless Jackson suffered an injury. Jackson, 28, is firmly entrenched as the Ravens franchise quarterback and has enjoyed a tremendous amount of success since landing with Baltimore back in 2018.</p><p>In Cleveland, Sanders could have a chance to see the field much earlier considering that Flacco is 40 years old and likely won't be playing much longer. In fact, Sanders anticipates his son starting for the Browns at some point during the 2025 season. </p>\n<p>\"Be patient and be ready,\" <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/story/_/id/46348599/deion-sanders-thinks-shedeur-sanders-start-browns-25\" target=\"_blank\">the elder Sanders said</a>. \"You got to be ready when it's time.

    "body": "<div>\n        <p>Keegan Bradley becoming the first playing captain in the Ryder Cup since Arnold Palmer in 1963 was widely assumed to happen this fall at Bethpage Black, but the United States captain opted to leave himself off the playing roster as the most notable snub of the captain's picks. </p><p>There was a time after his win at the Travelers that he was in his provisional roster, but as the Ryder Cup neared he realized the responsibilities as captain would be too much to handle while also playing. Still, as the U.S. team began practice Monday to officially start of Ryder Cup week, Bradley admitted he couldn't stop thinking about what it'd be like to be playing with his guys. </p><p>\"Definitely. I've thought about it every second,\" Bradley said. \"But I've also thought about how impossible it would be. </p><p>\"Like I said earlier, I was picked to do this job as captain, and there's been certain things that I've done during the week or lead-up that if I was playing, I don't think I could have done at the level that I needed to do them at. I catch myself every now and then looking down the fairway, seeing the guys walk down the fairway and think how badly I'd like to do that, and how badly I'd want to be in the group with Scottie Scheffler and seeing him play and being his teammate.</p>\n<p>\"But I feel like I've been called for a bigger cause here, to help our guys get ready to play and play at the highest level. But in the back of my mind, I'm always thinking, 'I could have been out there.' But ultimately, I can't tell you how much I've enjoyed being the captain and how I've enjoyed not having to worry about getting to sleep and getting my rest or how I haven't had to think about what time I'm going to go practice or meet my coach and then meet the guys. It simplified things a lot for me.\"</p><a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/golf/news/ryder-cup-2025-schedule-dates-format-explained-teams-bethpage-black/\" target=\"_blank\">\n        <div>\n            <div>\n                <p>2025 Ryder Cup schedule, dates: Format explained each day with teams set for Bethpage Black</p>\n                <p>\n                    Patrick McDonald                </p>\n            </div>\n                            <div>\n    <figure><img alt=\"2025 Ryder Cup schedule, dates: Format explained each day with teams set for Bethpage Black\" src=\"https://sportshub.cbsistatic.com/i/r/2025/09/22/bca4bb51-b3d1-44be-aba7-e55ad5ddf928/thumbnail/270x152/3f772af3eb3c7a19cc7407e599810310/ryder-cup-bethpage-tent-g.jpg\" /></figure>\n                </div>\n                    </div>\n    </a>\n<p>The hardest part of this for Bradley is clearly being out on the course, unable to help the team by hitting actual shots. At the same time, it seems like he's relieved to not have to juggle his responsibilities all week, and seems content that he's made the right decision, both for himself and the team. </p>\n<p>That's easy to say Monday, and Bradley is hoping his team will reward him with a Ryder Cup victory celebration Sunday night. If he's hoisting the Cup as the sun goes down at Bethpage Black, he won't have any regrets. But if things go wrong, the emotions will be unlike anything a Ryder Cup captain has ever felt, wondering if his biggest mistake was not picking up the clubs himself. </p>\n            </div>"

Well, I know he's in a better place right now on Monday than he was last Monday, so that bodes well.\"</p>\n<p>Dampier completed 25 of 38 passes for 162 yards in the loss.

Head coach Jonathan Gannon continues to work wonders on the defensive side of the ball as the Cards ranked 31st in scoring defense in 2023, then 15th in 2024 and are now fifth this season. The Cardinals make an opponent one-dimensional on offense and then perform their best in clutch situations as Arizona ranks top-five in rushing defense, third-down defense and redzone defense.</p><p>While Conner's injury is an emotional setback for Arizona, it does allow the team to utilize second-year back, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/3176915/trey-benson/\">Trey Benson</a>, more.

Additionally, just four teams have a better turnover differential than the Cards, which the model has taken into account.

    "body": "<div>\n        <p>The <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/DET/detroit-lions/\">Detroit Lions</a> made a statement against the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/BAL/baltimore-ravens/\">Baltimore Ravens</a> in a dominating 38-30 victory Monday night, which ended up being just the third loss for <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/2181169/lamar-jackson/\">Lamar Jackson</a> against an NFC opponent. Detroit certainly erased the Week 1 loss against the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/GB/green-bay-packers/\">Green Bay Packers</a>, having two convincing victories and remerging as a <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://cbssports.com/nfl/superbowl/\">Super Bowl</a> contender.</p><p>For the Ravens, that <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://cbssports.com/nfl/superbowl/\">Super Bowl</a> conversation is on hold after a 1-2 start. Baltimore is nearly unbeatable in prime-time games, but Detroit dominated the trenches on both sides of the ball in pinning the Ravens in a hole through three games.</p><p>In a battle of two of the best teams in the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://cbssports.com/nfl/\">NFL</a>, there were plenty of overreactions to go around. Which ones are overreactions and which are reality from this \"Monday Night Football\" showdown?</p><h2>Dan Campbell's fourth-down decisions will win the Lions a title</h2><p><strong>Overreaction or reality:</strong> Reality</p><p>The stones Campbell has to go for it on fourth down knows no bounds. Doesn't matter the situation, nor the score. Campbell is going to go for it, and live with his decision.</p>\n<p>The fourth-down decisions arguably cost Campbell and the Lions a conference title two years ago, but has won his team games more often than not. The Lions were 3 of 3 on fourth down in Monday's win over the Ravens, none bigger than the decision to go for it on fourth-and-2 with 1:56 left in a 31-24 game. <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/2061053/jared-goff/\">Jared Goff</a> threw a 20-yard pass into the bucket for <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/2967690/amon-ra-st-brown/\">Amon-Ra St. Brown</a> for the first down, and essentially the win. </p><p>The decision was brilliant, and the execution was excellent. To beat good teams like the Ravens, coaches have to take risks. Campbell did, and his team is 2-1 because of it. Don't be surprised if the Lions get to a Super Bowl, a decision like this will come around again -- and lead the Lions to a win. </p><h2>Lions still have a great offense without <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/395994/ben-johnson/\">Ben Johnson</a></h2><p><strong>Overreaction or reality:</strong> Reality</p><p>The first game was a mirage when it comes to the Lions offense. The communication issues seem all but settled and the Lions offense has been rolling ever since. Detroit has scored 90 points over its last two games (an average of 45.0 points per game) and 937 yards (an average of 468.5 yards per game). </p>\n<p>The offensive line is still elite and the playmakers are still there. Yes the offense is even creative, evidenced by the Amon-Ra St. Brown handoff and later pitch to <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/3162723/jahmyr-gibbs/\">Jahmyr Gibbs</a> for the touchdown to put Detroit up 28-21 early in the fourth quarter. </p>\n<p>Week 1 was an aberration. This offense is still incredibly good. </p><h2>Ravens are a Super Bowl contender despite losses to Lions and <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/BUF/buffalo-bills/\">Bills</a></h2><p><strong>Overreaction or reality:</strong> Overreaction</p><p>The Ravens are still a good football team, but a fourth-quarter collapse to the Bills and a defensive meltdown to the Lions isn't a good sign for a team with Super Bowl aspirations. This defense isn't Super Bowl caliber, allowing 41 points to the Bills and 38 points to the Lions -- an average of 39.5 points per game allowed against two of the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://cbssports.com/nfl/\">NFL's</a> best teams.</p><p>The crazy part about all the points the Ravens have allowed? The offense has 111 points through three games, an average of 37.0 points per game. This is with an offensive line that is struggling to protect Lamar Jackson (allowed seven sacks against the Lions) and getting bullied on the line of scrimmage both offensively and defensively. </p>\n<p>This is unlike the Ravens teams we've seen in the past, a team that appears to be all flash and little substance. Hard to call the Ravens a Super Bowl contender with how poor their defense is (especially at stopping the run) and the inability to beat the elite teams through three games.</p><p>Baltimore still has a chance to change this narrative. Kanas City is next week. </p><h2>Lamar Jackson will have to carry Ravens to AFC title</h2><p><strong>Overreaction or reality:</strong> Reality</p><p>Stating the obvious here. Jackson is still an elite quarterback and has little reason why the Ravens sit at 1-2 through three games. </p>\n<p>Jackson was 21 of 27 for 288 yards and three touchdowns and a 148.1 rating against the Lions defense -- and lost. The Ravens have scored 30+ points in all three games, and Jackson has a 141.8 passer rating to start the year! He has nine touchdown passes to zero interceptions, while completing an astonishing 72% of his passes. This is with 118 rushing yards and a touchdown. </p><p>The Ravens offensive line has failed Jackson, along with a defense that can't get off the field. Baltimore is fortunate Jackson is playing this well, or its season may be on the brink of disaster. </p><p>The Ravens will always have a chance with Jackson playing this well, but he's going to have to carry them to victories this year. Baltimore just doesn't have the elite defense as in years past, needing to outscore opponents to win. Jackson can do that if needed. </p>\n<h2><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/2061188/derrick-henry/\">Derrick Henry</a> is finally past his prime at 31</h2><p><strong>Overreaction or reality:</strong> Overreaction</p><p>Two fumbles lost in the first three games is uncharacteristic for Henry, and both have come at the most inopportune time. Monday's fumble helped propel the Ravens to a loss, as Baltimore got the ball back trailing 28-24 with 8:21 left. On Henry's first carry of the possession, he fumbled and the Lions got the ball back -- leading to a field goal for a 31-24 lead. </p><p>Henry has three fumbles through two games, uncharacteristic for him since he has three fumbles and only one fumble lost in the two previous seasons combined. He has two fumbles lost on rushing plays in the fourth quarter this season, which matches his total from the first 136 games combined. </p><p>Is Henry done? Or does he just have a case of fumblitis? The latter is more likely, as Henry is just going through issues with ball security. Both fumbles have played a crucial role in the Ravens losing games. </p>\n<p>Henry still has 41 carries for 242 yards and three touchdowns through three games, an average of 5.9 yards per carry. He's still on pace for 1,371 yards rushing, so running the ball isn't the issue.</p><p>If Henry takes care of the football, he'll be fine. He's not past his prime yet. </p>\n            </div>"

Wrexham return to the Racecourse Ground to face Reading, who previously defeated Portsmouth and Wimbledon in the earlier rounds of the tournament. </p><h2>Premier League giants involved</h2><p>On top of that, Premier League clubs are also back in action in the competition.

Today, the athletic directors of the 17 football-playing institutions overwhelmingly supported a regular season schedule that includes nine conference games and a minimum of 10 games each year against Power 4 opponents. This positions the ACC as one of only two leagues committed to having every team annually play a minimum of 10 games against Power 4 teams. There will be additional discussions and more details to be determined, but today's decision showcases the commitment and leadership of our ADs in balancing what is best for strengthening the conference and their respective programs. As specified in the Conference constitution, the model will be presented to the Faculty Athletics Representatives for formal adoption.\" </p></blockquote><p><span><a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/news/acc-considering-scheduling-shift-requiring-10-power-four-opponents-conference-slate-remains-sticking-point/\" target=\"_blank\">Phillips was pushing for this model</a></span> ahead of Monday's meeting with the athletic directors, as he hoped to follow the SEC's model that they announced for the 2026 season. What we don't know just yet is when the ACC will go to this scheduling format or what the exact structure of the new nine-game ACC schedule will be. </p><p>The SEC's expansion to a nine-game conference schedule beginning in 2026 was motivated at least partially by <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://cbssports.com/college-football/\">College Football</a> Playoff metrics that give extra weight to wins against quality opponents.
