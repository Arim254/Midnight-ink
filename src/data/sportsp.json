The model projects the Over to hit in 54% of simulations.</p><h2>Florida State vs. Virginia Under 60.5 total points (-110)</h2><p>Florida State has the No. 3 scoring offense (48.5 points per game), while Virginia ranks 13th (42.3 ppg) in scoring this season. However, most of their offensive success has come against inferior opponents. The Seminoles play their ACC opener on Friday, while Virginia plays just its second conference contest. The Seminoles opened the season with a massive upset with a 31-17 victory over Alabama, finishing below this total. Florida State and Virginia have gone Under this total in each of their last 13 head-to-head meetings, and the model projects the Under to hit in 66% of simulations.</p><h2>TCU (+3) vs. Arizona State (-115)</h2><p>TCU climbed up to No. 24 in the nation after its 35-24 victory over SMU on Saturday. The Horned Frogs have the No. 15 scoring offense (41.5 ppg), led by experienced quarterback Josh Hoover. The junior and three-year starter for TCU has 1,000 passing yards with 11 touchdowns compared to two interceptions through three games, and he's coming off throwing for 379 yards and five touchdowns against SMU last week. He threw for nearly 4,000 yards (3,949) last season. TCU also has a strong defense, ranking 32nd in scoring defense at 19 ppg. The model projects TCU to cover the spread in 62% of simulations.</p><h2>Want more MLB picks and NFL picks for Friday, September 26?</h2><p><strong>You've seen the model's Friday best bets.

But something about Pereira appeared off and even UFC analyst Joe Rogan took part in the postfight conversation by going public with rumors that \"Poatan\" had been battling both a broken hand and a battle with norovirus. </p><p>Fighting hurt (not to mention on short notice) had been a recurring theme in Pereira's six-fight run through the 205-pound division ever since he lost the middleweight title to Israel Adesanya in their 2023 rematch. And the 38-year-old Brazilian slugger made no excuses after the loss. </p><p>As the two prepare for their immediate rematch at next <span><a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mma/news/ufc-320-magomed-ankalaev-vs-alex-pereira-2-fight-card-date-odds-location-rumors-complete-guide/\" target=\"_blank\">Saturday's UFC 320 pay-per-view card</a></span> in Las Vegas, however, some of the truth is starting to trickle out as Ankalev, a 33-year-old native of Dagestan, Russia, prepares for his first title defense in the main event. </p>\n<p>Pereira still won't admit what was bothering him in March but during an interview on Thursday with CBS Sports, he did openly admit he was physically compromised when asked how difficult it was to deal with the loss mentally after judges' scores of 49-46 and 48-47 (twice).</p>\n<p>\"It was, of course [difficult],\" Pereira said. \"Dealing with that is not cool but honestly, if I put together everything that was going on with me -- and I'm not going to say it right now -- it makes me even happy that I was able to fight [and] to do the fight that I did with everything that was going on with me.\"</p><p>Pressed for more details regarding what bothered him and why training camp was so tough, Pereira continued to keep his cards close to the vest.</p>\n<p>\"I'm not trying to talk about anything like that [in terms of what happened],\" Pereira said. \"Of course, I'm not happy with the loss but knowing my potential in life and the way that I fought, I'm surprised that I was even able to fight with everything that was going on.\"</p><p>Pushed to at least give a percentage as to how compromised he actually was, Pereira relented and went on to say he believes a healthier performance in the rematch will equal a resounding victory. </p><p>\"I have no doubt. I am very well prepared and I trained very good so I should be ready for this fight,\" Pereira said. \"Honestly, I was about 40% in that fight on that night. Obviously, it's going to be much more this time. But [even] if I'm only 50%, that 10% is going to make such a difference that I'm going to leave no doubt for the fight.\"  </p>\n            </div>"

That disparity stuck out to Lanning as a potential advantage to Penn State and a jab from the league office at his Ducks.</p><p>\"We're traveling 15,000 miles this year, and we play seven teams that have more prep time than we do,\" <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.johncanzano.com/p/canzano-boots-on-the-ground-in-happy\">Lanning said to John Canzano</a>. \"That's unique, isn't it? It's almost like they didn't want us in the Big Ten, or something, right? We snuck our way in, didn't we?\"</p><p>Six of the seven teams Lanning referenced as having more preparation time are Big Ten opponents. <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/teams/NWEST/northwestern-wildcats/\">Northwestern</a> and <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/teams/RUT/rutgers-scarlet-knights/\">Rutgers</a> both had or have Friday games the week before playing Oregon, giving them an additional day. <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/teams/IND/indiana-hoosiers/\">Indiana</a>, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/teams/IOWA/iowa-hawkeyes/\">Iowa</a>, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/teams/MINN/minnesota-golden-gophers/\">Minnesota</a> and Penn State each have the luxury of full bye weeks prior to their matchups with the Ducks. The seventh team was a non-conference opponent in <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/teams/OKLAST/oklahoma-state-cowboys/\">Oklahoma State</a>, which played a Thursday game prior to its trip to Eugene.</p>\n<a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/news/college-football-playoff-race-2025-penn-state-vs-oregon-alabama-vs-georgia-lead-monster-week-5-schedule/\" target=\"_blank\">\n        <div>\n            <div>\n                <p>College Football Playoff race 2025: Penn State vs. Oregon, Alabama vs. Georgia lead monster Week 5 schedule</p>\n                <p>\n                    Will Backus                </p>\n            </div>\n                            <div>\n    <figure><img alt=\"College Football Playoff race 2025: Penn State vs. Oregon, Alabama vs. Georgia lead monster Week 5 schedule\" src=\"https://sportshub.cbsistatic.com/i/r/2025/09/24/18d9bcc4-9360-47b3-8cf0-49ebd32b6dca/thumbnail/270x152/03ead9855f7576483c8e66edb065ccde/adobe-express-file-4.jpg\" /></figure>\n                </div>\n                    </div>\n    </a>\n<p>But this is not an Oregon-specific outlier and it is, frankly, part of what the Ducks signed up for when they joined the Big Ten. For instance, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/teams/WASH/washington-huskies/\">Washington</a> faces five Big Ten teams on the heels of bye weeks this season. It is all part of the conference's plan to mitigate the impacts of cross-country travel, which also affects the teams that have to fly to Eugene, Seattle and Los Angeles -- not just the Ducks.</p><p>Lanning's frustration is similar to Riley's. The USC coach led his No. 21-ranked Trojans into battle last week at 8 p.m. PT, giving him a short turnaround before this week's noon ET kickoff at No. 23 <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/teams/ILL/illinois-fighting-illini/\">Illinois</a>.</p><p>\"Going from the absolute latest kick in the country to the absolute earliest kick in the country has its challenges,\" Riley said. \"But the challenges -- like, it is what it is. We don't make the schedule, clearly.\"</p>\n<p>Is the Big Ten doing its newest members a disservice, or is this just the cost of doing business in a conference that spans from coast to coast? Lanning and Riley seem to think it is the former.</p>\n            </div>"

Can Kirby Smart ameliorate a surprisingly bad 1-6 all-time record against <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/teams/BAMA/alabama-crimson-tide/\">Alabama</a>?</p><p>These are two of the big questions that loom over Saturday night's game between No. 17 Alabama and No. 5 Georgia. Alabama already has one loss from its season opener against <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/teams/FSU/florida-state-seminoles/\">Florida State</a> and would love to start its challenging SEC slate with a win. Georgia is fortunate to be 3-0 after a close-call 44-41 overtime win against <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/teams/TENN/tennessee-volunteers/\">Tennessee</a> in its SEC opener. Both teams start quarterbacks who patiently waited their time -- <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/players/28878532/ty-simpson/\">Ty Simpson</a> in Tuscaloosa, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/players/28876053/gunner-stockton/\">Gunner Stockton</a> in Athens -- and possess defenses that haven't been nearly as good as you'd expect based on the names on the front of the jersey. </p><p><em><a href=\"https://martech.cbssports.com/bt/redirect/prod?b=draftkings&c=sport\" target=\"_blank\">Bet Georgia vs. Alabama at DraftKings Sportsbook</a>, where new users get $200 in bonus bets and over $200 off NFL Sunday Ticket. <a href=\"https://martech.cbssports.com/bt/redirect/prod?b=draftkings&c=sport\" target=\"_blank\">Click here</a>:</em></p><p>These two teams have a tendency to deliver classics whenever they meet on the field. You have the famous second-and-26 walk-off touchdown pass in the 2018 national championship game. Then, the wild comeback the following season when Jalen Hurts took over and beat Georgia in the SEC Championship. And also, the 2022 national championship when Smart beat his mentor Nick Saban for his first title as the Bulldogs coach. </p>\n<p>And then there was last year when <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/players/29419031/ryan-williams/\">Ryan Williams</a> delivered one of the greatest plays you'll ever see on an acrobatic catch and run for a game-winning 75-yard touchdown. </p><p>If this year's edition comes even close to matching last year's thriller in Tuscaloosa, we're in store for one of the games of the season. </p><h2>Alabama vs. Georgia: Need to know</h2><p><strong>How does Alabama attack Georgia's</strong> <strong>defense:</strong> A year ago, Kalen DeBoer and then-offensive coordinator Nick Sheridan put together a masterful first-half offensive gameplan that had Georgia befuddled and overwhelmed. That fast start where QB Jalen Milroe looked unstoppable was critical given the furious rally the Bulldogs unleashed in the second half. Can DeBoer and new offensive coordinator Ryan Grubb cook up some new concepts that Smart and UGA defensive coordinator Glenn Schumann haven't seen before? Tide starting QB Ty Simpson doesn't give you quite the versatility from a running standpoint that Milroe did, but he's a better passer and he's been on a heater coming into this one. Georgia's defense, which hasn't looked great so far this season, could have its hands full Saturday. </p>\n<p><strong>Georgia should take some shots downfield:</strong> Georgia's offensive line <span><a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/news/despite-crushing-loss-to-georgia-tennessee-has-reason-for-optimism-in-quest-for-return-trip-to-cfp/\" target=\"_blank\">struggled against Tennessee</a></span>, giving up four sacks, which can make a program skittish about trying to be aggressive with its vertical passing game. But going up against an Alabama defense that hasn't fared well in pressuring the quarterback, the Bulldogs could benefit from unleashing <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/players/29123979/zachariah-branch/\">Zachariah Branch</a> downfield for some big play chances. If this one is anything like last year's Georgia is going to need to keep pace offensively in what could be a high-scoring affair. Trusting the offensive line to give Stockton the time to do so is risky, but this may be the matchup to do it. </p><p><strong>Tide need to get run game going:</strong> There are multiple reasons behind the struggles -- from an offensive line that hasn't lived up to the hype yet to the lack of a dominant running back -- but there's no question that Alabama's run game hasn't delivered this season. The Tide rank 103rd nationally, averaging only 123.67 rushing yards per game. That was especially a problem against Florida State when the Tide managed only 87 rushing yards, looked one-dimensional offensively and managed to convert only 6 of 17 third downs. Getting running back <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/players/28875653/jam-miller/\">Jam Miller</a> back should provide a boost, but Alabama may need to be creative to get its running game going early. </p><h2>   Where to watch Alabama vs. Georgia live   </h2><p><strong>Date</strong>: Saturday, Sept. 27 | <strong>Time</strong>: 7:30 p.m. ET<br />   <strong>Location</strong>: Sanford Stadium -- Athens, Georgia<br /><strong>TV: </strong>ABC | <strong>Live stream: </strong><a href=\"https://www.fubo.tv/welcome/leagues/191261?irad=399332&irmp=416484&sharedid=HTW\" target=\"_blank\">Fubo</a> (Try for free)</p>\n<h2>Alabama vs. Georgia prediction, picks   </h2>\n<p>Maybe this is a sucker pick to assume the scoring will be anywhere close to what it was a year ago, but neither defense particularly impresses me and think both could be ripe to be exploited.

    "body": "<div>\n        <p>The Europeans entered the 2025 Ryder Cup hoping experience would make the difference, and on Friday, they were proven correct as the visitors stormed out to a 5.5 to 2.5 lead on the United States. It's the first time Europe has led on U.S. soil after Friday's first day of action since 2004 (when the visitors won 18.5 to 9.5), and captain Luke Donald pushed almost all of the correct buttons across the first two sessions. </p><p>Meanwhile, the Americans were left wondering whether they need to go to Plan B as they face a 3-point deficit after Day 1, a margin from which no team has come back since 1999. </p><p>The performance of the teams' top stars was the name of the game on Day 1. Jon Rahm and Rory McIlroy went 3-0-1 for Europe, providing the kind of stability and leadership the team needed on the road from their best players. U.S. captain Keegan Bradley, meanwhile, saw Scottie Scheffler and Bryson DeChambeau combine to go 0-4-0. Compounding the problem? Some of the pairings he expected to lean on this week are now major question marks.   </p><p>The pressure is firmly on the Americans to claw back closer to level with Europe on Day 2, which will follow the same schedule with foursomes in the morning and fourballs in the afternoon.   </p>\n<p>Check out a full breakdown of the <span><a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/golf/news/ryder-cup-2025-schedule-dates-format-explained-teams-bethpage-black/\" target=\"_blank\">2025 Ryder Cup schedule and playing format</a></span> along with CBS Sports' <span><a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/golf/news/ryder-cup-2025-predictions-team-usa-europe-roster-rankings/\" target=\"_blank\">ranking of all 24 players on the Ryder Cup rosters</a></span> ahead of competition Saturday.    </p><h2>    2025 Ryder Cup matchups: Day 2 (Saturday)   </h2><p><em>Session 1 -- Foursomes<br />  </em>  </p><table><tbody><tr><th>Match</th><th>United States</th><th>Tee time</th><th>Europe</th></tr><tr><td><p>9</p></td><td><p>Bryson DeChambeau & Cameron Young<br /> <em>-140</em><br />  \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t</p></td><td>7:10 a.m.</td><td><p>Matt Fitzpatrick & Ludvig Åberg<br /> <em>+105</em><br />  \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>10</p></td><td><p>Collin Morikawa & Harris English<br /> <em>+155</em><br />  \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t</p></td><td>7:26 a.m.</td><td><p>Rory McIlroy & Tommy Fleetwood<br /> <em>-215</em><br />  \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>11</p></td><td><p>Xander Schauffele & Patrick Cantlay<br />-110<br />\t\t\t \t\t\t\t</p></td><td>\t\t\t\t7:42 a.m.</td><td><p>Jon Rahm & Tyrrell Hatton<br />-125<br />\t\t\t \t\t\t\t</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>12</p></td><td><p>Scottie Scheffler & Russell Henley<br />-200<br />\t \t\t\t\t</p></td><td>\t\t\t\t7:58 a.m.</td><td><p>Robert MacIntyre & Viktor Hovland<br />+145<br />\t\t \t\t\t\t</p></td></tr></tbody></table><p><em>Odds via <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/betting/news/draftkings-promo-code/\">DraftKings Sportsbook</a></em>  </p><p>Europe dominated alternate shot 3-1 on Day 1; as such, it will send out the exact same pairings for Saturday's session. They have been placed in a different order this time, but Donald is applying the \"if it ain't broke, don't fix it\" approach to Saturday's action. Frankly, it's hard to blame him. </p><p>Matt Fitzpatrick and Ludvig Åberg get the call to go out first this time around as Donald hope they can get hot early and set the tone for Europe. Rahm and Tyrrell Hatton drop back to the third session behind McIlroy and Tommy Fleetwood with Viktor Hovland and Robert MacIntyre bringing up the rear again.   </p><p>The United States will also stay the course with their Saturday foursomes pairings in a rather surprising move. The only change from Friday will be Cameron Young swapping in for Justin Thomas alongside DeChambeau, as Bradley has opted to stick with the original plan despite facing a notable deficit.   </p><p>The biggest surprise is the return of a Collin Morikawa and Harris English pairing that got steamrolled by McIlroy and Fleetwood on Friday; the troubled American duo will have to deal with that dominant unit again Saturday. There seemed to be little in the way of positive vibes or chemistry from those two Friday, so no one anticipated them to get thrown back out there for another session.   </p><p>Henley also was expected by most fans to hit the bench Saturday with J.J. Spaun seemingly performing better in the afternoon among the rookie options to pair with Scheffler. However, Bradley clearly believes Henley is the right fit next to Scheffler despite the struggles Friday. What will be most interesting is whether they change up the order of who hits when, as Henley teeing off the first was a head-scratcher given the course setup.   </p>\n            </div>"

    "body": "<div>\n<p>Coming up with a winning NFL DFS strategy can go in many different directions, but a popular one is targeting games with the highest totals when searching for NFL DFS picks. The three highest over/unders of the week will all kick off on Sunday afternoon with Rams vs. Colts, Chiefs vs. Ravens and Bears vs. Raiders. Thus, you can expect stars like Puka Nacua, Jonathan Taylor, Patrick Mahomes, Lamar Jackson, Rome Odunze and Brock Bowers to comprise many daily Fantasy football lineups.</p><p>Players of that caliber, however, will set back your NFL DFS salary cup, forcing you to search for more economical options to pair with them. Should the likes of Luther Burden or Tyquan Thornton find their way into your receiver slots for Sunday's main slate? Will underperforming players like Isiah Pacheco or Ashton Jeanty finally live up to their price tags on NFL DFS sites? Three weeks of games gives us enough of a sample size to notice player trends, which could aid in setting NFL daily Fantasy lineups. </p><p><em>Before making any NFL DFS picks for Sunday or locking in NFL DFS lineups on sites like DraftKings and FanDuel, be sure to </em><a href=\"https://www.sportsline.com/nfl/daily-fantasy/optimizer/#ttag=09252025_agg_cbssports_dfs_football_nfl_Optimizer_NFLDFSWeek4Sunday\" target=\"_blank\"><em>check out SportsLine's advanced NFL DFS Lineup Optimizer</em></a><em>.</em></p><p>The DFS Optimizer uses info from the SportsLine Advanced-Data Projection Model and DFS Professional Millionaire Mike McClure to identify top DFS picks/plays for any slate on betting apps like <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/betting/news/draftkings-promo-code/\">DraftKings</a> and <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/betting/news/fanduel-promo-code/\">FanDuel</a>.

The Heisman winner is coming off his best game as a pro, in multiple ways, as he matched a career high of four touchdown passes while also avoiding being sacked for the first time as a Bear. Despite a subpar win-loss record, Williams has an outstanding 25:3 TD:INT over his last 17 starts, averaging 213.3 passing yards and 30.5 rushing yards.</p><p>Chicago heads to Vegas on Sunday, and the Raiders' defense is the type which should allow Williams to continue his stellar individual play. The Raiders have the 24th-ranked pass defense and just allowed a backup in Marcus Mariota to have 207 yards and a touchdown thru the air, plus 40 yards and another score on the ground. Prior to that, Vegas allowed Justin Herbert to have a pair of touchdown passes in Week 2, and in the season opener, Drake Maye had 300 yards of total offense versus the Raiders. <a href=\"https://www.sportsline.com/nfl/daily-fantasy/optimizer/#ttag=09252025_agg_cbssports_dfs_football_nfl_Optimizer_NFLDFSWeek4Sunday\" target=\"_blank\">See who else to pick here</a>.</p><p>The Optimizer's NFL DFS strategy also includes rostering 49ers wideout Ricky Pearsall ($5,700 on DraftKings and $6,300 on FanDuel). A year ago at this time, Pearsall was recovering from being shot, but now he's the Niners' No. 1 receiver and one of the most productive wideouts in the league. He ranks third with 281 receiving yards as he's performed whether Brock Purdy or Mac Jones is throwing him passes. He's picked up where he left off following a strong 2024 finish as over his last five games, Pearsall's averaging six receptions and 98.2 yards with two total touchdowns.</p><p>San Fran will host the Jags on Sunday, with that cross-country flight certainly not helping Jacksonville's prospects. The Jaguars have been one of the most giving teams to opposing receivers this year as they've allowed the third-most receptions and the third-most receiving touchdowns to wideouts. Nico Collins had an 8-104-1 stat line a week ago against the Jags, while three different Bengals wideouts scored versus the team in Week 2. Priced outside of the top 15 wideouts on both DraftKings and FanDuel, Pearsall is a steal for Week 4 NFL DFS lineups. <a href=\"https://www.sportsline.com/nfl/daily-fantasy/optimizer/#ttag=09252025_agg_cbssports_dfs_football_nfl_Optimizer_NFLDFSWeek4Sunday\" target=\"_blank\">You can see the rest of the Optimizer's NFL DFS picks here</a>.</p><h2>How to build Sunday Week 4 NFL DFS lineups</h2><p>The NFL DFS Optimizer is also targeting multiple undervalued players who could explode for huge numbers on Sunday.

    "body": "<div>\n        <p>If there was one major takeaway from the opening race of the Round of 12 at New Hampshire, it's that the way teams perform in the most critical portion of the season goes a long way toward whether they can win a Cup Series championship. </p><p>In a dominant performance highlighted by Ryan Blaney's win, Team Penske reminded everyone yet again that the path to a Cup championship runs through them as they seek their fourth straight. And that reminder came through an on-track display of cohesion that was decidedly the opposite of what was displayed by another one of NASCAR's top programs in Joe Gibbs Racing.</p><p>With Blaney and Team Penske already having moved onto the Round of 8, it's up to the other playoff teams to respond in the Hollywood Casino 400 at Kansas Speedway, the middle race in the second round of the NASCAR Cup Series playoffs. While Ross Chastain and Trackhouse Racing enter this race as its defending winner, it is Hendrick Motorsports and Kyle Larson who present the rest of the field with its target to beat after a dominant performance in the spring where the No. 5 Chevrolet led 221 of 267 laps.</p><a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nascar/news/nascar-2025-race-schedule-results-complete-list-of-cup-series-race-dates-winners-tracks-locations/\" target=\"_blank\">\n        <div>\n            <div>\n                <p>NASCAR playoffs 2025 race schedule, results: Complete list of Cup Series race dates, winners, tracks</p>\n                <p>\n                    Steven Taranto                </p>\n            </div>\n                            <div>\n    <figure><img alt=\"NASCAR playoffs 2025 race schedule, results: Complete list of Cup Series race dates, winners, tracks\" src=\"https://sportshub.cbsistatic.com/i/r/2025/09/21/15f97dc9-95f6-45f1-85bb-921d85ca29ab/thumbnail/270x152/40d55deb47826fc2fe425a4c2ac8c4d0/gettyimages-2236625210.jpg\" /></figure>\n                </div>\n                    </div>\n    </a>\n<h2>Where to watch the NASCAR playoffs at Kansas</h2><p><strong>Date:</strong> Sun., Sept. 28 | <strong>Time:</strong> 3 p.m. ET<br /><strong>Location:</strong> Kansas Speedway -- Kansas City, Kan.<br /><strong>TV:</strong> USA | <strong>Stream:</strong> <a href=\"https://www.fubo.tv/welcome/leagues/191277?irad=356362&irmp=416484&sharedid=HTW\" target=\"_blank\">Fubo</a> (Try for free)  </p>\n<h2>Storyline to watch</h2><p>After a Round of 16 sweep led to talk of Joe Gibbs Racing potentially dominating the playoffs, the narrative surrounding the organization has now swung swiftly in the other direction thanks to on-track drama from a week ago in New Hampshire. After a sequence where Ty Gibbs -- who took umbrage with the way teammate Christopher Bell had raced him -- made life extremely difficult for both Bell and Denny Hamlin racing for a spot outside the top 10, Hamlin finally spun Gibbs out and put him in the wall, leading to public tensions over the manner in which Gibbs had raced his playoff contender teammates as well as his alleged influence as the grandson of team owner Joe Gibbs.</p>\n<p>With neither Hamlin or Gibbs saying anything of substance at the racetrack, things instead played out over their own respective media platforms: <a href=\"https://x.com/JohnNewby_/status/1970573687679078450\" target=\"_blank\">In an Instagram story</a>, Gibbs posted a clip from Kevin Harvick's Happy Hour podcast with a pointing emoji in apparent agreement with Harvick's assertion that Hamlin spun Gibbs out on purpose. Hamlin, meanwhile, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j6aChE0eNIQ\" target=\"_blank\">articulated his issues on \"Actions Detrimental</a>,\" saying that he did not believe JGR was on the same page as far as etiquette racing teammates at this time of the year.</p><p>\"What I've heard (from Joe Gibbs) is that 'If you're a non-playoff car, any break that you can cut your teammates, please do,'\" Hamlin said. \"... It's possible Ty feels like he doesn't owe us anything. And that's just a different mindset and it's okay to have, but you would think that one day the roles would be reversed and certainly he probably would be upset if we did not let him go and he was fighting to move on to the next round.\"</p>\n<p>Hamlin cited how at this point in the playoffs, drivers who are out of the playoffs will generally yield spots to teammates or other drivers with team affiliations who are still in the playoffs and racing for the championship. With that considered, Hamlin has called on JGR team leadership to set an exact standard of how their four cars should race each other in the interest of trying to make sure that at least one of them can ultimately win the Cup title.</p><p>\"If you want us all to just race each other cutthroat no matter what your position and stature in the standings is, we can definitely do that,\" Hamlin said. \"I expect myself and the 19 and the 20 to race really, really hard because we're all battling each other to get above or maintain our status above the cut line. If I get eliminated or the 19 gets eliminated or the 20 gets eliminated and then we've established this 'no rules, you guys just do whatever you want to do,' none of us are gonna win.</p><p>\"... It's too difficult to win naturally, much less if we're going to have the 'well, everyone just races for themselves and it doesn't matter whether you're racing for a championship or not.' Which, from my standpoint, I would think that Ty would want one of us to win a championship. It's his name on the building.\"</p>\n<p>While Ty Gibbs has had flashes of greatness since moving to the Cup Series, winning Rookie of the Year honors in 2023 and making the playoffs in 2024, maturity has been an issue for Gibbs that has persisted throughout his five year career at NASCAR's national levels. Exactly how Gibbs responds to what occurred at New Hampshire, and how it influences the way he races Hamlin, Bell, and Chase Briscoe, could go a long way toward determining whether a Joe Gibbs Racing driver wins this year's Cup championship or not.</p><h2>NASCAR news of the week</h2>\n<ul><li>Following the latest meeting of NASCAR's Playoff Committee, two distinct possibilities now exist for a framework of what the sport's championship system may look like in 2026. While a revised playoff format remains probable, <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/athletic/6658624/2025/09/25/nascar-playoff-system-change-full-season-chase/\" target=\"_blank\">The Athletic has reported</a> that NASCAR is now seriously weighing the possibility of eliminating the playoffs altogether and returning to a full season points format similar to the old Winston Cup system that was used from 1975 until 2003. A final decision is expected to come from the sport's executive level.<p>\"Surely there's a format out there that can give a little bit to everyone. And I think it's possible,\" Denny Hamlin said on this week's \"Actions Detrimental.\" \"From what I've seen proposed, we're on the right track. And it's certainly gonna be better than what we have.\"</p></li><li>JR Motorsports has announced that former Cup champion crew chief Rodney Childers will join the team in 2026 as crew chief of the No. 1 Chevrolet in the NASCAR O'Reilly Auto Parts (currently Xfinity) Series, which will be split by drivers Carson Kvapil and Connor Zilisch. Childers' move to JR Motorsports will mark his return to a crew chief role after a short tenure at Spire Motorsports, which he left after just nine races working with the No. 7 team and driver Justin Haley.</li><li>Kaulig Racing has announced the promotion of Chris Rice from team president to CEO, rewarding Rice for his integral role in building the team since its inception in 2016. Rice will oversee all of Kaulig's competition and business operations, and his promotion comes ahead of Kaulig's expansion into the Craftsman Truck Series as the flagship team for Ram's re-entry into NASCAR.</li><li>Former Cup Series champion Martin Truex Jr. <a href=\"https://x.com/ninjanoah1122/status/1971371412918358089\" target=\"_blank\">said Thursday on his Instagram account</a> that some trophies from his career, which had been put up for sale online, had been sold without his consent. <a href=\"https://x.com/lucas_1k_/status/1971387588901732671\" target=\"_blank\">In a statement</a>, Race Day Authentics shared that they had purchased Truex's memorabilia from an individual that had worked with the 2017 Cup champion for over 10 years under the assumption that the trophies had been gifted to them as part of a Truex housecleaning. <p>Race Day Authentics says that they were \"lied to by the person we bought them from\" and that they are now in contact with Truex and plan to return the trophies and other items to their rightful owner.</p></li><li>This week has seen two departures at NASCAR. On Friday, <a href=\"https://x.com/bobpockrass/status/1971599368865341445\" target=\"_blank\">Fox Sports reported</a> that race director Jusan Hamilton is no longer employed by NASCAR, with little specifics given other than that his departure was not performance-related. In addition, <a href=\"https://www.sportsbusinessjournal.com/Articles/2025/09/25/track-chief-chip-wile-to-depart-nascar-at-end-of-25-season/\" target=\"_blank\">Sports Business Journal reports</a> that senior NASCAR Holdings executive Chip Wile will leave his role at the end of 2025, with his duties overseeing the sport's racetracks set to be assumed by Ben Kennedy.</li></ul><h2>Pick to win</h2><p>Brad Keselowski (+2800) -- Back in May, the only driver who seemed to be any match for Kyle Larson's dominance was Brad Keselowski, who was running down the No. 5 for the lead before a blown tire while running second put Keselowski in the wall and out of the race. While it ended in a DNF, that run helped spark Keselowski's turnaround in the second half of the regular season, which has seen him put himself in position to win races as recently as two weeks ago in the Bristol Night Race. RFK Racing has come close to winning over and over again in 2025 to the point that they feel due to get over the hump, and it could be the team co-owner himself who gets the program to Victory Lane.</p>\n            </div>"

Florida State downed Kent State 66-10 in Week 4, while Virginia topped Stanford 48-20. The Seminoles (3-0, 0-0 Atlantic Coast Conference), who look to flip the script on last year's last-place finish in the conference, are 2-0 against unranked opponents in 2025.

    "body": "<div>\n        <p>The Week 4 NFL schedule continues Sunday with 13 more games, 11 of which comprise what is often referred to as the main slate during the afternoon. Injuries have hit the quarterback and running back positions hard in the past few weeks, so NFL DFS players have more challenges when setting NFL DFS lineups as they evaluate matchups such as Cowboys vs. Eagles, Ravens vs. Chiefs and Colts vs. Rams, which has the highest over/under of the day at 49.5.</p><p>How should those injuries play into your NFL DFS strategy for Sunday, and which other daily Fantasy picks should be in your NFL DFS lineups?

London's numbers haven't jumped off the page this season as he enters Week 4 with 16 catches for 159 yards.</p><p>He has 27 targets, however, and that rate should lead to more production for daily Fantasy players going forward.
