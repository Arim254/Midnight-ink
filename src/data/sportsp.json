Meanwhile, New York has dropped two consecutive games. This season, the Cubs are 44-23 following a loss and 42-24 as the home favorite. They are also 67-44 as the favorite. The Mets, however, are 10-22 as the away underdog and 31-44 as the away team. The Mets are expected to start David Paterson (9-6, 3.98 ERA), and his over/under for total strikeouts is 4.5. SportsLine's model predicts that Chicago wins this game outright in 53% of simulations. </p><h2>Brewers moneyline (-106) vs. Padres </h2><p>Milwaukee has hit a skid, losing three of its last four games, but they are in a great position to bounce back. The Brewers enter this game with a 44-35 record as the road team and 36-31 as the underdog.

Shohei Ohtani starts for Los Angeles but hasn't gone into the sixth inning thus far. They'll lean on their bullpen, which owns a 4.28 ERA on the year.

As was the case last year, Crown Jewel will be anchored by matches between WWE's top men's and women's champions for the honorary Crown Jewel championship.</p><p>For the men, that means a match between world heavyweight champion Seth Rollins and undisputed WWE champion Cody Rhodes. The women's Crown Jewel championship match is still up in the air as women's world champion Stephanie Vaquer waits to see who emerges as WWE women's champion from an upcoming championship triple threat match on SmackDown.</p><p>John Cena will also be in action for one of the final matches of his career when he takes on an old rival in AJ Styles.</p><a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/wwe/news/wwe-hall-of-fame-2026-stephanie-mcmahon-becomes-first-inductee-to-next-class-after-undertakers-surprise/\" target=\"_blank\">\n        <div>\n            <div>\n                <p>WWE Hall of Fame 2026: Stephanie McMahon becomes first inductee to next class after Undertaker's surprise</p>\n                <p>\n                    Shakiel Mahjouri                </p>\n            </div>\n                            <div>\n    <figure><img alt=\"WWE Hall of Fame 2026: Stephanie McMahon becomes first inductee to next class after Undertaker's surprise\" src=\"https://sportshub.cbsistatic.com/i/r/2025/09/21/4c7f6d7d-c427-484b-a45e-757c38e65b74/thumbnail/270x152/0f4cca3123a1cf94fb4f003fa58c11d7/pay14-photo-190.jpg\" /></figure>\n                </div>\n                    </div>\n    </a>\n<p>Let's take a look at what we know -- and what we expect -- from Crown Jewel, which takes place Oct. 11 from RAC Arena in Perth, Australia.</p><h2>2025 WWE Crown Jewel matches</h2><p><strong>Men's Crown Jewel Championship</strong> <strong>-- Cody Rhodes vs. Seth Rollins:</strong> Rhodes and Rollins came face-to-face shortly after Wrestlepalooza, knowing the champion vs. champion match was more or less locked in. Rollins has questioned what Rhodes thinks of him and his \"vision\" for the future of wrestling, while Rhodes has questioned why Rollins needs the backup of \"goons\" if he's the best in the world. These two have a fairly lengthy history, dating back to Rhodes being Rollins' surprise opponent at WrestleMania 38 in Rhodes' return to WWE.</p>\n<p><strong>Women's Crown Jewel Championship -- Stephanie Vaquer vs. TBD:</strong> Vaquer won the women's world championship at Wrestlepalooza and is now waiting to see who will emerge from the Sept. 26 triple threat match between WWE women's champion Tiffany Stratton, Jade Cargill and Nia Jax. Whoever wins the title will face Vaquer at Crown Jewel.</p><p><strong>AJ Styles vs. John Cena:</strong> Cena and Styles had some fantastic matches around 2017. Those matches were among the best of Cena's entire career. That is pretty much the entire storyline of why this match is happening, with no real animosity or storyline beyond. Of course, maybe Cena has to deal with a surprise attack from someone like Brock Lesnar once again as his final days in WWE wind down.</p><h2>2025 WWE Crown Jewel predictions</h2><p><strong>Asuka & Kairi Sane vs. Iyo Sky & Rhea Ripley:</strong> After weeks of teasing a split, Asuka finally turned on Sky after Sky protected Ripley following an Asuka mist attack. Sane has sided with Asuka because Asuka is why Sane and Sky are in WWE to begin with. A tag match seems like an easy enough next step in the story and would fill time on the card well.</p>\n<p><strong>United States Championship -- Sami Zayn (c) vs. Solo Sikoa:</strong> Zayn's issues with Solo and the MFTs don't seem to have run their course. Add in that Sikoa has not received a championship rematch since dropping the belt to Zayn, and you have the recipe for an easy high-stakes title match to add to the show.</p>\n            </div>"

On Monday, Nakisa Bidarian, co-founder of Most Valuable Promotions, announced the stipulations for the boxing match that pits Paul, a cruiserweight by trade, against Davis, a lightweight champion.</p><p>MVP held a press conference in New York City for the Nov. 14 fight. The curious showdown will be a 10-round exhibition with three-minute rounds. The exhibition fight will not go on either fighter's professional  record, but ringside judges will be present to determine a winner. The maximum weight allowance is 185 pounds, and the fighters will wear 12-ounce gloves. </p><p>Paul has exclusively fought with 10-ounce gloves, excluding the 14-ounce gloves he wore for his exhibition match with Mike Tyson last November. Davis normally wears eight-ounce gloves, standard for fighters competing at welterweight or lower.</p><p>Last week, MVP announced the fight would take place at the Kaseya Center in Miami after plans to host the fight at Atlanta's State Farm Arena fell through. The exhibition fight <span><a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/boxing/news/jake-paul-vs-gervonta-davis-fight-officially-moved-to-miami-after-atlanta-plans-fall-through/\" target=\"_blank\">received pushback</a></span> from Georgia's athletic commission, which needed to approve the fight.</p>\n<p>The most glaring issue with Paul vs. Davis is the weight difference. Paul regularly competes at 200 pounds, roughly 65 pounds heavier than WBA lightweight champion Davis' normal weight class of 135.</p><p>Davis (30-0-1, 28 KOs) is vastly more experienced with stoppage wins over Ryan Garcia, Rolando Romero, Isaac Cruz and Mario Barrios. He's coming off a controversial majority draw against Lamont Roach Jr. Despite his experience, \"Tank\" is giving up a concerning amount of weight in this fight.</p>\n<p>Paul (12-1, 7 KOs) most recently beat Julio Cesar Chavez Jr. by unanimous decision. His most high-profile wins include former UFC middleweight champion Anderson Silva, Nate Diaz, and twice beating former UFC welterweight champ Tyron Woodley.</p>\n            </div>\n    </div>"

Charles Oliveira vs. Mateusz Gamrot headlines the Oct. 11 card after Rafael Fiziev, Oliveira's previous opponent, pulled out.</p><p>UFC announced the new main event on Tuesday. Oliveira, the former UFC lightweight champion, also confirmed the booking, which pits Oliveira's world-class submissions against Gamrot's elite wrestling.</p><p>\"Opponent: Mateusz Gamrot,\" Oliveira said <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/DO9VajkEaXa/\">on social media</a>.  \"This is the guy we're going to battle in a great war. The rest just  wanted the hype, just wanted to stall and talk, but that's part of it,  that's how it is. </p><p>\"The focus is still the same fight in the freight of my people, my flag, in my house with a new opponent, so let's go here and Brazil for now.\"</p>\n<p>Oliveira (35-11, 1 NC) is currently one of UFC's most popular acts. A 15-year UFC veteran, Oliveira reinvented himself with an 11-fight win streak between 2018 and 2022. He defeated Tony Ferguson, Michael Chandler, Dustin Poirier and Justin Gaethje during that stretch, the latter three via stoppage in title fights. </p><p>\"Do Bronx\" has since struggled with consistency, sandwiching wins over Beneil Dariush and Chandler between losses to Islam Makhachev, Arman Tsarukyan, and Ilia Topuria. The upcoming fight will be his first since Topuria knocked him out in a vacant lightweight title fight on June 28. Oliveira holds records for most post-fight bonuses (20), most finishes (20), most performance bonuses (13) and most submissions (16) in UFC history.</p>\n<p>Gamrot campaigned for this fight from the moment Fiziev fell out. He's won four of his last five fights, including a TKO injury win over Fiziev. Most impressively, Gamrot beat Tsarukyan via decision in 2022. A recent loss to Dan Hooker sparked questions about Gamrot's ability at the elite level, but a win over Oliveira would remedy that. </p>\n            </div>"

    "body": "<div>\n        <p>The <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/teams/NYY/new-york-yankees/\">New York Yankees</a> became the latest team to clinch a playoff spot on Tuesday, doing so in dramatic fashion on a walk-off win vs. the White Sox after a ninth-inning comeback. The Yankees have now made the postseason in back-to-back seasons and in eight of their last nine attempts. This also marks the franchise's 60th playoff appearance.</p><p>Down 2-1 headed into the bottom of the ninth, Anthony Volpe scored the tying run on a wild pitch from Chicago reliever Brandon Eisert before José Caballero drove in <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/players/2071264/aaron-judge/\">Aaron Judge</a> for the winning run.</p><p>The extent of New York's playoff berth is to be determined since the Yankees remain in the hunt for both the American League's top seed and the East division crown. The Yankees entered Tuesday trailing the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/teams/TOR/toronto-blue-jays/\">Toronto Blue Jays</a> by two games in both races. It's worth noting the Blue Jays won the season series (8-5), meaning the Yankees will have to beat them outright to prevail.</p><p>\"First box to check, right?\" manager Aaron Boone <a href=\"https://x.com/BrendanKutyNJ/status/1970672461784997992\" target=\"_blank\">said</a> after the game Tuesday. \"We got to get in. We're in. Don't take that shit for granted. Yeah, we're in the playoffs. We got a lot more to do, right? We've got a lot bigger goals. Enjoy this.\" </p>\n<p>The Yankees can credit their success to yet another terrific season from Judge, who may well win consecutive AL MVP awards. Offseason additions like slugger <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/players/2165919/cody-bellinger/\">Cody Bellinger</a>, lefty <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/players/2001078/max-fried/\">Max Fried</a>, and first baseman <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/players/1765052/paul-goldschmidt/\">Paul Goldschmidt</a> also ranked among the 10 most productive players on New York's roster, according to Baseball Reference's metrics.</p><p>In a sense, a down year would've been understandable. The Yankees lost outfielder <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/players/2507367/juan-soto/\">Juan Soto</a> to the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/teams/NYM/new-york-mets/\">New York Mets</a> through free agency, then saw ace <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/players/1893753/gerrit-cole/\">Gerrit Cole</a> succumb to Tommy John surgery back in the spring, before he could throw even a single regular-season pitch. Yet the Yankees were able to weather those setbacks, as well as losing months in June and July. As of Tuesday, they had the best run differential in the entire American League.</p><p>The Yankees will wrap up their regular season with two more games against the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/teams/CHW/chicago-white-sox/\">White Sox</a> and then three against the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/teams/BAL/baltimore-orioles/\">Baltimore Orioles</a>, one of the year's most disappointing clubs.</p>\n<p>The aforementioned Blue Jays are the only other AL club to clinch a postseason spot to date. The <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/teams/SEA/seattle-mariners/\">Seattle Mariners</a>, seeking their first division crown since 2001, would seem to be next up.</p>\n            </div>"

At one point, Stewart was asked about the possibility of Brondello being fired. </p><p>\"What the f---?\" Stewart said under her breath, but loud enough for the microphone to catch. </p><p>Now, the rest of the WNBA world is asking the same question after the Liberty did indeed part ways with Brondello on Tuesday. </p><a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/wnba/news/new-york-liberty-make-coaching-change-as-team-chooses-to-not-renew-sandy-brondellos-contract/\" target=\"_blank\">\n        <div>\n            <div>\n                <p>New York Liberty make coaching change as team chooses to not renew Sandy Brondello's contract</p>\n                <p>\n                    Robby Kalland                </p>\n            </div>\n                            <div>\n    <figure><img alt=\"New York Liberty make coaching change as team chooses to not renew Sandy Brondello's contract\" src=\"https://sportshub.cbsistatic.com/i/r/2025/09/23/73f3840f-4ea5-48cc-9749-a4b2cf33d593/thumbnail/270x152/e393f79ee15d4083126ea439ea204d3f/brondello.jpg\" /></figure>\n                </div>\n                    </div>\n    </a>\n<p>Over Brondello's four seasons in charge, the Liberty went 107-53, won a franchise-record 32 games in both 2023 and 2024, never missed the playoffs and made two Finals appearances. In 2024, Brondello led the Liberty, one of the league's original franchises, to its first WNBA championship. She also helped the team capture the Commissioner's Cup title in 2023. </p>\n<p>All of those accomplishments were ultimately overshadowed by an extremely disappointing 2025 campaign. </p><p>Beset by injuries, the Liberty finished in fifth place and were bounced in the first round by the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/wnba/teams/PHO/phoenix-mercury/\">Phoenix Mercury</a>. While there were certainly issues outside of Brondello's control this summer, the team often looked out of sorts and played below its talent level -- the latter was an issue throughout her tenure. In the playoffs, the offense totally collapsed and she refused to trust the bench the front office had built in the offseason. </p><p>The Liberty only have two players -- <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/wnba/players/28850667/nyara-sabally/\">Nyara Sabally</a> and <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/wnba/players/29334556/leonie-fiebich/\">Leonie Fiebich</a> -- under contract for 2026, and will now have to add a coaching search to their offseason agenda. While unrestricted free agents Stewart and Ionescu both previously expressed their desire to return, it's fair to wonder how Brondello's dismissal may impact their decisions and those of the Liberty's other key free agents, including <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/wnba/players/26678052/jonquel-jones/\">Jonquel Jones</a>, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/wnba/players/26677878/natasha-cloud/\">Natasha Cloud</a> and <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/wnba/players/2063689/emma-meesseman/\">Emma Meesseman</a>. </p>\n<p>So, who might the Liberty hire to replace Brondello? Let's examine some possible candidates. </p><h2>Sonia Raman -- Assistant coach, Liberty</h2><p>The Liberty hired Raman as an assistant coach prior to the season and she will likely get consideration for the top position. Not only is Raman already familiar with the organization, she has extensive previous experience as an assistant with the Memphis Grizzlies in the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://cbssports.com/nba/\">NBA</a> and as the head coach at MIT for over a decade. </p><p>Raman specializes on the offensive side of the ball -- she has to take some responsibility for how the team struggled on that side in the playoffs -- and is a keen believer in analytics. She also worked on the player development side with the Grizzlies. </p>\n<h2>Teresa Weatherspoon -- Unrivaled</h2><p>Weatherspoon is a Liberty legend -- one of their original players, she spent seven seasons with the team and hit the most famous shot in league history during the 1999 Finals -- and has over a decade of coaching experience at a number of different levels. However, her lone season as a WNBA coach with the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/wnba/teams/CHI/chicago-sky/\">Chicago Sky</a> in 2024 did not go well, as the Sky finished in 10th place with a 13-27 record. She was fired weeks before the Liberty were crowned champions.</p><p>Due to her connection to the franchise, and work with Stewart's Unrivaled venture, Weatherspoon's name is going to come up -- at least externally. But will the Liberty be willing to hand her the keys to a title contender after how things went in Chicago?</p><h2><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/wnba/players/1104986/rebekkah-brunson/\">Rebekkah Brunson</a>, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/wnba/players/1671834/briann-january/\">Briann January</a>, Kristi Toliver </h2><ul><li>Brunson -- assistant coach, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/wnba/teams/MIN/minnesota-lynx/\">Lynx</a></li><li>January -- assistant coach, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/wnba/teams/IND/indiana-fever/\">Fever</a></li><li>Toliver -- associate head coach, Mercury</li></ul><p>We'll group Brunson, January and Toliver together here. All three are former WNBA champions who are now rising fast in the coaching ranks. </p>\n<p>Brunson has been an assistant under Cheryl Reeve in Minnesota since 2020; January has been an assistant at the collegiate and G League levels, and is currently working for Stephanie White in Indiana; Toliver, who began coaching in the NBA when she was still playing in the WNBA, is now the associate head coach under Nate Tibbetts in Phoenix. </p><p>If the Liberty want to poach a top assistant with WNBA experience -- both on and off the court -- from another contender, these are the top choices. </p><h2>An off-the-radar candidate?</h2><p>The Liberty have the resources and reputation to hire pretty much anyone they want. In recent years, we've seen a few WNBA teams hire off-the-radar candidates -- notably, Tibbetts in Phoenix and Rachid Meziane in Connecticut. Could the Liberty go the same route?</p>\n<p>You don't fire a coach as good as Brondello without having an idea of who you want to bring in. What if the Liberty have someone in mind who either hasn't coached in the WNBA before or has been away for many years? Admittedly, we're throwing darts, but here's a few names that could be intriguing, even if some of them are unlikely. </p><ul><li>Geno Auriemma, UConn </li><li>Sue Bird, retired </li><li>Jenny Boucek, Indiana Pacers <br /></li><li>Lindsay Gottlieb, USC </li><li>Kara Lawson, Duke/USA </li><li>Miguel Méndez, Fenerbahçe/Spain </li></ul>\n            </div>"

Houston has won three of the last four meetings with Tennessee. </p><p>In a game featuring the smallest NFL line of the week, Caleb Williams and the Chicago Bears (-1.5) look to win their second game in a row when they take on the Las Vegas Raiders. Chicago rolled to a 31-14 win over the Dallas Cowboys in Week 3 as Williams passed for four touchdowns.

It's the right move for the Giants to make, and hopefully, it will benefit Fantasy managers when it comes to <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/26697761/malik-nabers/fantasy/\">Malik Nabers</a>, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/3124107/wandale-robinson/fantasy/\">Wan'Dale Robinson</a>, and the entire offense in New York. </p><p> Dart (18 percent rostered on CBS Sports) should be added in all Superflex and two-quarterback leagues, and he's worth picking up in deep, one-quarterback leagues as well. He looked good in the preseason, completing 32-of-47 passes for 372 yards, three touchdowns, and no interceptions, and he also rushed six times for 52 yards and a touchdown. </p><p> At Ole Miss in 2024, Dart passed for 4,279 yards, 29 touchdowns, and six interceptions, and he also had 124 carries for 495 yards and three touchdowns in 13 games. He's going to make plays with his legs, and that's a boost for his Fantasy value. </p><p> It helps that Giants left tackle <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/2871738/andrew-thomas/fantasy/\">Andrew Thomas</a> returned to action in Week 3 to help protect Dart. But his main job, at least for Fantasy managers, is to feed Nabers. </p><p> Wilson did a good job of that in the first two games of the season against Washington and Dallas when Nabers had 25 targets for 14 catches, 238 yards, and two touchdowns. But Nabers was a non-factor in Week 3 against Kansas City with only seven targets, and he finished with two catches for 13 yards. </p><p> Nabers was going to be a must-start Fantasy option no matter who starts at quarterback for the Giants. But hopefully, Dart provides more upside and stability for one of the best receivers in the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://cbssports.com/nfl/\">NFL</a>, and I'm going to view this move as a positive. Hopefully, this quarterback-receiver pairing will be one of the best in the NFL for many years to come, especially when it comes to dynasty leagues. </p><p> Robinson also had a down game against the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/KC/kansas-city-chiefs/\">Chiefs</a> with one catch for 26 yards on four targets. Prior to that, he had 14 catches for 197 yards and a touchdown on 18 targets in the first two games of the year against the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/WAS/washington-commanders/\">Commanders</a> and <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/DAL/dallas-cowboys/\">Cowboys</a>. </p><p> We know who Robinson is based on his career under Brian Daboll, who is someone who needs high volume, and he had 140 targets in 2024 and finished with 93 receptions. But he only had 699 receiving yards and scored three touchdowns, and he averaged just 10.8 PPR points per game. Dart should continue to feed Robinson, and he remains a low-end starter in all PPR leagues moving forward. </p><p> The only other potential Fantasy starter for the Giants is <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/26697012/cam-skattebo/fantasy/\">Cam Skattebo</a>, especially with <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/2963637/tyrone-tracy-jr/fantasy/\">Tyrone Tracy Jr</a>. (shoulder) out for multiple weeks. Skattebo just had a breakout game in Week 3 against the Chiefs. Tracy was injured, and Skattebo finished with 10 carries for 60 yards and a touchdown, along with six catches for 61 yards on eight targets. </p><p> I like Skattebo as a borderline No. 2 Fantasy running back in all leagues while Tracy is out, and we'll see what happens with this backfield when Tracy returns. Dart will hopefully keep Skattebo involved in the passing game, and there could be more touchdown chances for everyone if Dart performs at a high level. </p><p> It's not going to be easy for Dart and the Giants in Week 4 against the Chargers, and they have a brutal schedule for the majority of the season with upcoming matchups against the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/PHI/philadelphia-eagles/\">Eagles</a> twice (Week 6 and Week 8), Denver (Week 7), San Francisco (Week 9), Green Bay (Week 11) and Detroit (Week 12). We'll hopefully love the Giants against the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/NO/new-orleans-saints/\">Saints</a> (Week 5), <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/CHI/chicago-bears/\">Bears</a> (Week 10), and <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/NE/new-england-patriots/\">Patriots</a> (Week 13), but we can evaluate everyone on a weekly basis as the season goes on. </p><p> For now, we're excited that Dart is the starter. He needs to get Nabers the ball, keep Robinson involved, and help Skattebo continue to improve. And, if he makes plays on his own, Dart could become a potential Fantasy starter in all leagues.</p></div>\n    </div>\n</article>\n        </div>\n<div>\n    <div>\n            <div>\n    <p><img

The employees would risk losing their job if they did not sign the agreement, according to Holmes' reporting.</p><p>Team employees received emails on May 27 saying that they'd receive an updated version of the team's employee handbook, and they were asked to review and agree to the terms of the new version within three days.</p><p>Part A of the updated handbook featured many of the same topics as the previous version, from 2023, did. Part B, titled \"Confidential information, Intellectual Property, and Dispute Resolution Agreement,\" was a new addition.</p><p>\"Under the passage focused on dispute resolution, which followed a passage on confidential information, the document stated that the Suns and employees would 'agree all legal disputes and claims identified below shall be determined exclusively by final and binding individual arbitration,'\" Baxter reported. \"It further stated that the provision would last beyond that employee's employment with the company.\"</p>\n<p>The provision, according to Holmes, covers disputes involving employment discrimination.Suns senior vice president of communications Stacey Mitch provided a statement to ESPN saying, \"This policy is standard at most large organizations including Disney, ESPN, and many other <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://cbssports.com/nba/teams/\">NBA teams</a>. This policy does not result in the waiver of claims.\"</p><p>Holmes noted ESPN does not, in fact, require new hires to agree to mandatory arbitration clauses, and no such requirement exists in the Disney Handbook.</p><p>It's unclear how many employees signed the agreement.</p><a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nba/news/jayson-tatum-injury-update-celtics-star-doesnt-rule-out-2025-26-return-focused-on-making-full-recovery/\" target=\"_blank\">\n        <div>\n            <div>\n                <p>Jayson Tatum injury update: Celtics star doesn't rule out 2025-26 return, focused on making 'full recovery'</p>\n                <p>\n                    Chris Bengel                </p>\n            </div>\n                            <div>\n    <figure><img alt=\"Jayson Tatum injury update: Celtics star doesn't rule out 2025-26 return, focused on making 'full recovery'\" src=\"https://sportshub.cbsistatic.com/i/r/2025/09/23/f81c377c-1532-40e4-b955-1a4341a97f1e/thumbnail/270x152/bc8d9df9059dbc68aa58e25e36deec42/tatum.jpg\" /></figure>\n                </div>\n                    </div>\n    </a>\n<p>This episode comes amid a run of legal battles for the franchise.

    "body": "<div>\n        <p>The SEC unveiled its new nine-game schedule Tuesday night and with that came its selection of three \"annual opponents\" for all 16 teams. Think of annual opponents as the SEC's spin on protected <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://cbssports.com/college-football/\">college football</a> rivals. </p><p>Instead of these protected rivalries being permanent, though, the league will reevaluate things after four years. So that leaves the door open for further changes in 2030. </p><p>The SEC made an effort to protect some of its most historic rivalries as it embarks on its latest scheduling initiative. With 16 teams to juggle, it was a Herculean effort. </p><a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/news/sec-football-schedule-league-releases-every-game-for-2026-29-with-three-annual-opponents-for-each-team/\" target=\"_blank\">\n        <div>\n            <div>\n                <p>SEC football schedule: League releases every game for 2026-29, with three annual opponents for each team</p>\n                <p>\n                    Will Backus                </p>\n            </div>\n                            <div>\n    <figure><img alt=\"SEC football schedule: League releases every game for 2026-29, with three annual opponents for each team\" src=\"https://sportshub.cbsistatic.com/i/r/2025/09/23/142b5f7e-f81e-4e7f-ab8c-a4afc552c0d6/thumbnail/270x152/1def4fb79fc25a1503758db9b092d074/adobe-express-file-2.jpg\" /></figure>\n                </div>\n                    </div>\n    </a>\n<p>That also means some major games were left by the wayside. Here's a look at the annual opponent decisions the SEC missed on with its new approach to scheduling. </p>\n<h2><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/teams/TENN/tennessee-volunteers/\">Tennessee</a> vs. <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/teams/FLA/florida-gators/\">Florida</a> </h2><p>Of all the exclusions on the annual opponents list, this one may be the most baffling. Sure, the Vols and Gators didn't play on a consistent basis until the SEC initially split into divisions in 1992, but it didn't take long for them to treat each other like ancient nemeses. The feud between Tennessee coach Phillip Fulmer and Florida coach Steve Spurrier was foundational to the SEC as it entered a new era. Those two often did battle atop the conference and on the national stage. </p><p>It did lose a bit of its luster in the later days of Fulmer's tenure, and following his departure, as Florida won 11 games in a row from 2005-15 -- the longest streak in series history -- but things are heating up again thanks to Tennessee's resurgence under new coach Josh Heupel. And, even during that losing streak, the flames of animosity never dimmed on either side. Tennessee has played the likes of <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/teams/VANDY/vanderbilt-commodores/\">Vanderbilt</a> and <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/teams/UK/kentucky-wildcats/\">Kentucky</a> for a longer period of time, but a win against Florida means more than most. </p><h2><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/teams/BAMA/alabama-crimson-tide/\">Alabama</a> vs. <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/teams/LSU/lsu-tigers/\">LSU</a> </h2><p>Not protecting the Alabama-LSU game is another critical error. Sure, it may be a tad unfair to ask the Crimson Tide to play <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/teams/AUBURN/auburn-tigers/\">Auburn</a>, Tennessee and LSU all in the same season for four more years in a row when there's a chance for a refresh. And sure, there's some history with <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/teams/MISSST/mississippi-state-bulldogs/\">Mississippi State</a>, though that rivalry is the definition of one-sided. But Alabama is no stranger to a difficult path given its recent occupancy in the SEC West, and there's few games the Crimson Tide and Tigers care about more than this one. </p>\n<p>Nick Saban coached both teams. During the 31-year existence of the SEC West, Alabama and LSU finished atop the division a combined 22 times. They were also responsible for 16 SEC titles during the divisional era. To call this rivalry prolific would be an understatement. </p><h2>Florida vs. LSU </h2><p>A world in which LSU plays neither Alabama nor Florida is an odd one to live in. The annual game between the Gators and the Tigers, which became a fixture in 1971, survived the SEC's divisional split. It survived the initial wave of conference expansion as the league temporarily adjusted its scheduling. In the past two decades, LSU and Florida have combined for 11 SEC titles and five national championships. </p><p>And the last annual meeting between the two -- for now, at least -- ended in a 20-10 victory for LSU earlier this month. The Tigers won six of the last seven and are 7-2 against the Gators since 2017. There's some behind-the-scenes buzz that LSU didn't want Florida as an annual opponent anymore, but the Gators -- and Alabama -- make a whole lot more sense on that schedule than <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/teams/TXAM/texas-am-aggies/\">Texas A&M</a>. </p>\n<h2><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/teams/ARK/arkansas-razorbacks/\">Arkansas</a> vs. <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/teams/OKLA/oklahoma-sooners/\">Oklahoma</a></h2><p>Here's a bit of a wildcard. Though Arkansas and Oklahoma are geographically closer to each other than they are to any other school in the SEC, and though they (very briefly, along time ago) shared the Southwest Conference, they have played just 15 times since 1899. The last time they saw each other one the field was in 2001. </p><p>So why are they included here? This was the SEC's opportunity to create something new with the benefit of conference expansion and the revamped scheduling format. Given the relatively close proximity between the two universities, there's plenty of crossover between the fans and alumni. Arkansas' three scheduled opponents are more historic rivals, so it's hard to pick a game to eliminate in favor of Oklahoma, but the Sooners playing <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/teams/MISS/ole-miss-rebels/\">Ole Miss</a> doesn't make much sense when the Razorbacks were potentially on the table. Maybe it's something the SEC can take a look at come 2030. The chance to create fresh, organic rivalries does not come often. </p>\n            </div>"

The predicted finish pointed to the Sooners ending the year at 9-3 overall with five wins over nationally ranked teams but skipped over by the selection committee in favor of a two-loss, ACC runner-up <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/teams/GATECH/georgia-tech-yellow-jackets/\">Georgia Tech</a>.</p><p>Ten wins is the magic number in the SEC to all but guarantee playoff inclusion considering how many ranked teams are within the league at this very moment.

Before making any NFL DFS picks for Cardinals vs. Seahawks on Thursday Night Football on sites like DraftKings and FanDuel, <a href=\"https://www.sportsline.com/insiders/nfl-dfs-picks-thursday-night-football-seahawks-vs-cardinals-fantasy-lineup-advice-projections-for-draftkings-fanduel-from-millionaire-maker-contest-winner/#ttag=09232025_agg_cbssports_dfs_football_nfl_jimmiekaylor_CardinalsSeahawksDFS\" target=\"_blank\">be sure to check out the NFL DFS lineup advice, strategy and player stacks from SportsLine NFL daily Fantasy expert Jimmie Kaylor</a>. </p><p>Kaylor is a <span><a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/betting/news/nfl/\" target=\"_blank\">NFL betting</a></span> and DFS expert for SportsLine, who opened the 2022 NFL season by winning DraftKings' NFL Showdown Thursday Kickoff Millionaire contest.

The former USC standout had a breakout 2024 season with the Minnesota Vikings: in 17 games as the starter, he completed 361 of 545 passes for 4,319 yards, 35 touchdowns, and 12 interceptions, leading the Vikings to a 14-3 regular season record. That performance earned him his first Pro Bowl selection and a lucrative free-agent contract with the Seahawks.</p><p>In 2025, Darnold has thrown for 663 yards with four touchdowns and two interceptions, and his completion percentage sits at 70.3%. He has a solid core of weapons at his disposal, led by Jaxon Smith-Njigba, Cooper Kupp and rookie Tory Horton. <a href=\"https://www.sportsline.com/insiders/nfl-dfs-picks-thursday-night-football-seahawks-vs-cardinals-fantasy-lineup-advice-projections-for-draftkings-fanduel-from-millionaire-maker-contest-winner/#ttag=09232025_agg_cbssports_dfs_football_nfl_jimmiekaylor_CardinalsSeahawksDFS\" target=\"_blank\">See who else to roster right here</a>.</p><p>Part of Kaylor's optimal NFL DFS strategy also includes rostering Cardinals tight end Trey McBride. The former second-round pick out of Colorado State has played in 52 career games, catching 238 passes for 2,418 yards and seven receiving touchdowns. In 2024, McBride had a breakout year, catching 111 passes for 1,146 yards with two receiving touchdowns while adding one rushing score.</p><p>Through three weeks of the 2025 season, McBride has recorded 17 receptions for 182 yards and one touchdown, averaging over 10 yards per catch. He leads the Cardinals in targets, receptions and yards in 2025, and has an obvious rapport with Arizona quarterback Kyler Murray. <a href=\"https://www.sportsline.com/insiders/nfl-dfs-picks-thursday-night-football-seahawks-vs-cardinals-fantasy-lineup-advice-projections-for-draftkings-fanduel-from-millionaire-maker-contest-winner/#ttag=09232025_agg_cbssports_dfs_football_nfl_jimmiekaylor_CardinalsSeahawksDFS\" target=\"_blank\">You can see the rest of Kaylor's NFL DFS picks here</a>.</p><p><em>New users can see the latest </em><span><a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/betting/news/fanduel-promo-code/\" target=\"_blank\"><em>FanDuel promo code</em></a></span><em> to </em><a href=\"https://martech.cbssports.com/bt/redirect/prod?b=fanduel&c=sport\" target=\"_blank\"><em>get $300 in bonus bets at FanDuel if your $5 bet wins</em></a><em>:</em></p><h2>How to build NFL DFS lineups and stacks for Seahawks vs. Cardinals</h2><p>Kaylor is also targeting another undervalued player who could explode for huge numbers on Thursday Night Football.
