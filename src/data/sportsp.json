Pereira's sentiment stems from a recent visit to the UFC Performance Institute in Las Vegas, where he claims Ankalaev physically hid from him.</p><p>Pereira and Ankalaev are preparing for their rematch on Oct. 4. That preparation recently brought them to the UFC PI. On Tuesday, Pereira uploaded a <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SxEPJBdxKP0&ab_channel=AlexPoatanPereira\" target=\"_blank\">video</a> detailing his time there. \"Poatan\" claims he saw Ankalaev's coach, but the UFC light heavyweight champion was absent. Only later was Pereira informed that Ankalaev had allegedly hid from him.</p><p>\"Something funny happened just now when I was leaving the PI. I saw Ankalaev's coach there. I stayed myself, I didn't see Ankalaev there,\" Pereira said, according to transcriptions from <a href=\"https://x.com/ChampRDS/status/1970642326562205864\" target=\"_blank\">Championship Rounds</a>. \"... When I got to the car, someone from my team was still inside, and he heard the girl from the PI say to Ankalaev, 'He can come now, he's already left.' </p><p>\"Damn, he was hiding. They hid the guy in a little room. This guy thinks I'm going to run into him and start fighting.

However, Pereira takes issue with his rival's alleged cowardice.</p><p>\"Honestly, I would've handled it better. But the fact that the guy hides in a room because I'm in the same place as him,\" Pereira said. \"He's a chump. I'll keep to myself. I'll never pick a fight with the guy. Never start something. Of course, unless he comes at me. I have to defend myself, too. But what kind of champion is that? A shit champion. I know that's harsh, but he's a shitty champion. </p><p>Pereira is making final arrangements for their rematch in Vegas. In March, Ankalaev beat Pereira via unanimous decision, taking the light heavyweight title and snapping Pereira's five-fight winning streak. </p>\n<p>\"He's shown he's a coward,\" Pereira said. \"We'll see. He's hiding now. We'll be in the cage, locked in there. Unless he jumps the fence.\"</p>\n            </div>"

    "body": "<div>\n        <p>The <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/teams/NYY/new-york-yankees/\">New York Yankees</a> became the latest team to clinch a playoff spot on Tuesday, doing so in dramatic fashion on a walk-off win vs. the White Sox after a ninth-inning comeback. The Yankees have now made the postseason in back-to-back seasons and in eight of their last nine attempts. This also marks the franchise's 60th playoff appearance.</p><p>Down 2-1 headed into the bottom of the ninth, Anthony Volpe scored the tying run on a wild pitch from Chicago reliever Brandon Eisert before José Caballero drove in <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/players/2071264/aaron-judge/\">Aaron Judge</a> for the winning run.</p><p>The extent of New York's playoff berth is to be determined since the Yankees remain in the hunt for both the American League's top seed and the East division crown. The Yankees entered Tuesday trailing the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/teams/TOR/toronto-blue-jays/\">Toronto Blue Jays</a> by two games in both races. It's worth noting the Blue Jays won the season series (8-5), meaning the Yankees will have to beat them outright to prevail.</p><p>\"First box to check, right?\" manager Aaron Boone <a href=\"https://x.com/BrendanKutyNJ/status/1970672461784997992\" target=\"_blank\">said</a> after the game Tuesday. \"We got to get in. We're in. Don't take that shit for granted. Yeah, we're in the playoffs. We got a lot more to do, right? We've got a lot bigger goals. Enjoy this.\" </p>\n<p>The Yankees can credit their success to yet another terrific season from Judge, who may well win consecutive AL MVP awards. Offseason additions like slugger <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/players/2165919/cody-bellinger/\">Cody Bellinger</a>, lefty <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/players/2001078/max-fried/\">Max Fried</a>, and first baseman <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/players/1765052/paul-goldschmidt/\">Paul Goldschmidt</a> also ranked among the 10 most productive players on New York's roster, according to Baseball Reference's metrics.</p><p>In a sense, a down year would've been understandable. The Yankees lost outfielder <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/players/2507367/juan-soto/\">Juan Soto</a> to the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/teams/NYM/new-york-mets/\">New York Mets</a> through free agency, then saw ace <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/players/1893753/gerrit-cole/\">Gerrit Cole</a> succumb to Tommy John surgery back in the spring, before he could throw even a single regular-season pitch. Yet the Yankees were able to weather those setbacks, as well as losing months in June and July. As of Tuesday, they had the best run differential in the entire American League.</p><p>The Yankees will wrap up their regular season with two more games against the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/teams/CHW/chicago-white-sox/\">White Sox</a> and then three against the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/teams/BAL/baltimore-orioles/\">Baltimore Orioles</a>, one of the year's most disappointing clubs.</p>\n<p>The aforementioned Blue Jays are the only other AL club to clinch a postseason spot to date. The <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/teams/SEA/seattle-mariners/\">Seattle Mariners</a>, seeking their first division crown since 2001, would seem to be next up.</p>\n            </div>"

Many players and coaches, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nba/news/knicks-jalen-brunson-josh-hart-sound-off-on-tom-thibodeau-firing-should-be-nothing-but-praise-for-him/\">including some on Thibodeau's roster</a>, came to his defense after the franchise's decision to go in another direction. With an offseason to reflect on the change in leadership, Knicks star <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nba/players/2203517/jalen-brunson/\">Jalen Brunson</a> offered his thoughts on Thibodeau's exit and why the front office elected to make a coaching change.</p><p>\"It's sad to see a man I've known for a long time part ways with this organization,\" <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-HcHv_Wq-7c\">Brunson said Tuesday at Knicks media day</a>. \"He's meant a lot to me. I've expressed that to him publicly and personally. He's meant a lot to my career up to this point.\"</p><p>The best years of Brunson's career came under Thibodeau's tutelage. After emerging as a formidable player with the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nba/teams/DAL/dallas-mavericks/\">Dallas Mavericks</a>, Brunson took his game to another level when he joined forces in New York with Thibodeau, who gave him the biggest role of his career. Under Thibodeau's tutelage, Brunson garnered a pair of All-Star selections and All-NBA honors and developed into one of the most highly regarded point guards in the league.</p><p>Thibodeau increased the Knicks' regular season win total in four consecutive years before his firing. He took the franchise last season to its first Eastern Conference Finals appearance since 2000 where the Knicks lost in six games to the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nba/teams/IND/indiana-pacers/\">Indiana Pacers</a>. And that was after he snapped New York's seven-year playoff drought in his debut season at the helm.</p><a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nba/news/jayson-tatum-injury-update-celtics-star-doesnt-rule-out-2025-26-return-focused-on-making-full-recovery/\" target=\"_blank\">\n        <div>\n            <div>\n                <p>Jayson Tatum injury update: Celtics star doesn't rule out 2025-26 return, focused on making 'full recovery'</p>\n                <p>\n                    Chris Bengel                </p>\n            </div>\n                            <div>\n    <figure><img alt=\"Jayson Tatum injury update: Celtics star doesn't rule out 2025-26 return, focused on making 'full recovery'\" src=\"https://sportshub.cbsistatic.com/i/r/2025/09/23/f81c377c-1532-40e4-b955-1a4341a97f1e/thumbnail/270x152/bc8d9df9059dbc68aa58e25e36deec42/tatum.jpg\" /></figure>\n                </div>\n                    </div>\n    </a>\n<p>The Knicks' decision to move on from an established and successful coach despite their upward trajectory raised questions about the front office. <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nba/teams/DET/detroit-pistons/\">Pistons</a> coach J.B. Bickerstaff <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nba/news/pistons-j-b-bickerstaff-denounces-tom-thibodeau-firing-slams-knicks-for-final-straw-in-nba-coaching-trend/\">went so far as to say</a> the firing was the \"final straw\" in a trend of disrespect toward coaches.</p>\n<p>Brunson took a more pragmatic stance.</p><p>\"My job is to go out there and find a way to help this team win,\" said Brunson. \"There's different people in this organization with different jobs and different things they have to do to be able to make this team better. That's their point of view. So for me, I have to just come in and do my job to the best of my abilities.\"</p><p>The Knicks fell short of their championship goals during the 2024-25 season, and with the front office setting the precedent that it will not settle for anything less than title contention, incoming coach Mike Brown faces a lot of pressure to deliver right out of the gate. Brown is a two-time NBA Coach of the Year but has been fired by the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nba/teams/CLE/cleveland-cavaliers/\">Cleveland Cavaliers</a>, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nba/teams/LAL/los-angeles-lakers/\">Los Angeles Lakers</a> and <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nba/teams/SAC/sacramento-kings/\">Sacramento Kings</a> throughout a career that spans two decades.</p><p>If he takes the Knicks to the mountaintop, Brown will win his first NBA championship as a head coach (he's won four as an assistant).</p>\n<p>\"I'm excited,\" Brunson said. \"It's going to be fun. It's a new year. Everything's gonna be new, so everything's gonna be exciting at the beginning. Just really excited to get this season started.\"</p>\n            </div>"

The curious showdown will be a 10-round exhibition with three-minute rounds. The exhibition fight will not go on either fighter's professional  record, but ringside judges will be present to determine a winner. The maximum weight allowance is 185 pounds, and the fighters will wear 12-ounce gloves. </p><p>Paul has exclusively fought with 10-ounce gloves, excluding the 14-ounce gloves he wore for his exhibition match with Mike Tyson last November.

The exhibition fight <span><a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/boxing/news/jake-paul-vs-gervonta-davis-fight-officially-moved-to-miami-after-atlanta-plans-fall-through/\" target=\"_blank\">received pushback</a></span> from Georgia's athletic commission, which needed to approve the fight.</p>\n<p>The most glaring issue with Paul vs. Davis is the weight difference.

He's coming off a controversial majority draw against Lamont Roach Jr. Despite his experience, \"Tank\" is giving up a concerning amount of weight in this fight.</p>\n<p>Paul (12-1, 7 KOs) most recently beat Julio Cesar Chavez Jr. by unanimous decision. His most high-profile wins include former UFC middleweight champion Anderson Silva, Nate Diaz, and twice beating former UFC welterweight champ Tyron Woodley.</p>\n            </div>\n    </div>"

The Buckeyes are coming off a bye, and the team was a little lackluster in 2024 following its early bye weeks. OSU failed to cover in either contest following its two regular season byes last year, including narrowly beating Nebraska by four points, despite being favored by 25.5 points. As for the Huskies, they're also 3-0 on the season and coming off a 35-point road victory in a rivalry game with Washington State. Washington's 55.7 points per game are second-most in FBS as it should be able to stick with an Ohio State team that's allowing over 100 rushing yards per game, despite facing just one Power 4 team. The model has Washington covering nearly 60% of the time. <a href=\"https://www.sportsline.com/insiders/college-football-odds-lines-spreads-picks-predictions-betting-advice-for-week-5-2025-from-proven-model/#ttag=09222025_agg_cbssports_picks_football_ncaa_model_Week5collegefootballodds\" target=\"_blank\">See which other picks the model likes here</a>.</p><p>Another prediction: No. 9 Texas A&M (-6.5, 52.5) covers against Auburn well over 50% of the time at Saturday at 3:30 p.m. ET. Auburn fell out of the Top 25 following its defeat to Oklahoma, while the Aggies had a bye last Saturday, following their upset of then-No. 8 Notre Dame. The Tigers struggled containing QB John Mateer of OU, as he had 300 total yards, with touchdowns both thru the air on the ground, so Auburn should equally struggle with A&M's Marcel Reed. The quarterback has a 9:1 TD:INT and is averaging nearly 50 rushing yards per game. Add in that just two teams in the nation have allowed more sacks than Auburn, and just 10 FBS teams average more penalties, and the Tigers have several issues that A&M can exploit. SportsLine's model also predicts the Over hitting more than 50% of the time. <a href=\"https://www.sportsline.com/insiders/college-football-odds-lines-spreads-picks-predictions-betting-advice-for-week-5-2025-from-proven-model/#ttag=09222025_agg_cbssports_picks_football_ncaa_model_Week5collegefootballodds\" target=\"_blank\">See the rest of the model's picks here</a>.</p><h2>How to make college football picks for Week 5</h2><p>The model has also made the call on who wins and covers in every FBS matchup in Week 5, and it's calling for multiple upsets, including a shocking result in a ranked matchup. <a href=\"https://www.sportsline.com/insiders/college-football-odds-lines-spreads-picks-predictions-betting-advice-for-week-5-2025-from-proven-model/#ttag=09222025_agg_cbssports_picks_football_ncaa_model_Week5collegefootballodds\" target=\"_blank\">You can only get every pick for every game at SportsLine</a>, <strong>and for a limited time you can use promo code CHAMPIONSHIP to get your first month at SportsLine for $1.</strong></p><p><strong>So what college football picks can you make with confidence, and which underdogs win outright?

    "body": "<div>\n        <p>The SEC unveiled its new nine-game schedule Tuesday night and with that came its selection of three \"annual opponents\" for all 16 teams. Think of annual opponents as the SEC's spin on protected <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://cbssports.com/college-football/\">college football</a> rivals. </p><p>Instead of these protected rivalries being permanent, though, the league will reevaluate things after four years. So that leaves the door open for further changes in 2030. </p><p>The SEC made an effort to protect some of its most historic rivalries as it embarks on its latest scheduling initiative. With 16 teams to juggle, it was a Herculean effort. </p><a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/news/sec-football-schedule-league-releases-every-game-for-2026-29-with-three-annual-opponents-for-each-team/\" target=\"_blank\">\n        <div>\n            <div>\n                <p>SEC football schedule: League releases every game for 2026-29, with three annual opponents for each team</p>\n                <p>\n                    Will Backus                </p>\n            </div>\n                            <div>\n    <figure><img alt=\"SEC football schedule: League releases every game for 2026-29, with three annual opponents for each team\" src=\"https://sportshub.cbsistatic.com/i/r/2025/09/23/142b5f7e-f81e-4e7f-ab8c-a4afc552c0d6/thumbnail/270x152/1def4fb79fc25a1503758db9b092d074/adobe-express-file-2.jpg\" /></figure>\n                </div>\n                    </div>\n    </a>\n<p>That also means some major games were left by the wayside. Here's a look at the annual opponent decisions the SEC missed on with its new approach to scheduling. </p>\n<h2><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/teams/TENN/tennessee-volunteers/\">Tennessee</a> vs. <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/teams/FLA/florida-gators/\">Florida</a> </h2><p>Of all the exclusions on the annual opponents list, this one may be the most baffling. Sure, the Vols and Gators didn't play on a consistent basis until the SEC initially split into divisions in 1992, but it didn't take long for them to treat each other like ancient nemeses. The feud between Tennessee coach Phillip Fulmer and Florida coach Steve Spurrier was foundational to the SEC as it entered a new era. Those two often did battle atop the conference and on the national stage. </p><p>It did lose a bit of its luster in the later days of Fulmer's tenure, and following his departure, as Florida won 11 games in a row from 2005-15 -- the longest streak in series history -- but things are heating up again thanks to Tennessee's resurgence under new coach Josh Heupel. And, even during that losing streak, the flames of animosity never dimmed on either side. Tennessee has played the likes of <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/teams/VANDY/vanderbilt-commodores/\">Vanderbilt</a> and <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/teams/UK/kentucky-wildcats/\">Kentucky</a> for a longer period of time, but a win against Florida means more than most. </p><h2><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/teams/BAMA/alabama-crimson-tide/\">Alabama</a> vs. <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/teams/LSU/lsu-tigers/\">LSU</a> </h2><p>Not protecting the Alabama-LSU game is another critical error. Sure, it may be a tad unfair to ask the Crimson Tide to play <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/teams/AUBURN/auburn-tigers/\">Auburn</a>, Tennessee and LSU all in the same season for four more years in a row when there's a chance for a refresh. And sure, there's some history with <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/teams/MISSST/mississippi-state-bulldogs/\">Mississippi State</a>, though that rivalry is the definition of one-sided. But Alabama is no stranger to a difficult path given its recent occupancy in the SEC West, and there's few games the Crimson Tide and Tigers care about more than this one. </p>\n<p>Nick Saban coached both teams. During the 31-year existence of the SEC West, Alabama and LSU finished atop the division a combined 22 times. They were also responsible for 16 SEC titles during the divisional era. To call this rivalry prolific would be an understatement. </p><h2>Florida vs. LSU </h2><p>A world in which LSU plays neither Alabama nor Florida is an odd one to live in. The annual game between the Gators and the Tigers, which became a fixture in 1971, survived the SEC's divisional split. It survived the initial wave of conference expansion as the league temporarily adjusted its scheduling. In the past two decades, LSU and Florida have combined for 11 SEC titles and five national championships. </p><p>And the last annual meeting between the two -- for now, at least -- ended in a 20-10 victory for LSU earlier this month. The Tigers won six of the last seven and are 7-2 against the Gators since 2017. There's some behind-the-scenes buzz that LSU didn't want Florida as an annual opponent anymore, but the Gators -- and Alabama -- make a whole lot more sense on that schedule than <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/teams/TXAM/texas-am-aggies/\">Texas A&M</a>. </p>\n<h2><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/teams/ARK/arkansas-razorbacks/\">Arkansas</a> vs. <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/teams/OKLA/oklahoma-sooners/\">Oklahoma</a></h2><p>Here's a bit of a wildcard. Though Arkansas and Oklahoma are geographically closer to each other than they are to any other school in the SEC, and though they (very briefly, along time ago) shared the Southwest Conference, they have played just 15 times since 1899. The last time they saw each other one the field was in 2001. </p><p>So why are they included here? This was the SEC's opportunity to create something new with the benefit of conference expansion and the revamped scheduling format. Given the relatively close proximity between the two universities, there's plenty of crossover between the fans and alumni. Arkansas' three scheduled opponents are more historic rivals, so it's hard to pick a game to eliminate in favor of Oklahoma, but the Sooners playing <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/teams/MISS/ole-miss-rebels/\">Ole Miss</a> doesn't make much sense when the Razorbacks were potentially on the table. Maybe it's something the SEC can take a look at come 2030. The chance to create fresh, organic rivalries does not come often. </p>\n            </div>"

It's the right move for the Giants to make, and hopefully it will benefit Fantasy managers when it comes to <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/26697761/malik-nabers/fantasy/\">Malik Nabers</a>, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/3124107/wandale-robinson/fantasy/\">Wan'Dale Robinson</a> and the entire offense in New York. </p><p> Dart (18 percent rostered on CBS Sports) should be added in all Superflex and two-quarterback leagues, and he's worth picking up in deep, one-quarterback leagues as well. He looked good in the preseason, completing 32-of-47 passes for 372 yards, three touchdowns and no interceptions, and he also rushed six times for 52 yards and a touchdown. </p><p> At Ole Miss in 2024, Dart passed for 4,279 yards, 29 touchdowns and six interceptions, and he also had 124 carries for 495 yards and three touchdowns in 13 games. He's going to make plays with his legs, and that's a boost for his Fantasy value. </p><p> It helps that Giants left tackle <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/2871738/andrew-thomas/fantasy/\">Andrew Thomas</a> returned to action in Week 3 to help protect Dart. But his main job, at least for Fantasy managers, is to feed Nabers. </p><p> Wilson did a good job of that in the first two games of the season against Washington and Dallas when Nabers had 25 targets for 14 catches, 238 yards and two touchdowns. But Nabers was a non-factor in Week 3 against Kansas City with only seven targets, and he finished with two catches for 13 yards. </p><p> Nabers was going to be a must-start Fantasy option no matter who starts at quarterback for the Giants. But hopefully Dart provides more upside and stability for one of the best receivers in the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://cbssports.com/nfl/\">NFL</a>, and I'm going to view this move as a positive. Hopefully, this quarterback-receiver pairing will be one of the best in the NFL for many years to come, especially when it comes to dynasty leagues. </p><p> Robinson also had a down game against the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/KC/kansas-city-chiefs/\">Chiefs</a> with one catch for 26 yards on four targets. Prior to that, he had 14 catches for 197 yards and a touchdown on 18 targets in the first two games of the year against the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/WAS/washington-commanders/\">Commanders</a> and <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/DAL/dallas-cowboys/\">Cowboys</a>. </p><p> We know who Robinson is based on his career under Brian Daboll, which is a receiver who needs high volume, and he had 140 targets in 2024 and finished with 93 receptions. But he only had 699 receiving yards and scored three touchdowns, and he averaged just 10.8 PPR points per game. Dart should continue to feed Robinson, and he remains a low-end starter in all PPR leagues moving forward. </p><p> The only other potential Fantasy starter for the Giants is <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/26697012/cam-skattebo/fantasy/\">Cam Skattebo</a>, especially with <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/2963637/tyrone-tracy-jr/fantasy/\">Tyrone Tracy Jr</a>. (shoulder) out for multiple weeks. Skattebo just had a breakout game in Week 3 against the Chiefs in the game Tracy was injured, and Skattebo finished with 10 carries for 60 yards and a touchdown and six catches for 61 yards on eight targets. </p><p> I like Skattebo as a borderline No. 2 Fantasy running back in all leagues while Tracy is out, and we'll see what happens with this backfield when Tracy returns. Dart will hopefully keep Skattebo involved in the passing game, and there could be more touchdown chances for everyone if Dart performs at a high level. </p><p> It's not going to be easy for Dart and the Giants in Week 4 against the Chargers, and they have a brutal schedule for the majority of the season with upcoming matchups against the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/PHI/philadelphia-eagles/\">Eagles</a> twice (Week 6 and Week 8), Denver (Week 7), San Francisco (Week 9), Green Bay (Week 11) and Detroit (Week 12). We'll hopefully love the Giants against the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/NO/new-orleans-saints/\">Saints</a> (Week 5), <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/CHI/chicago-bears/\">Bears</a> (Week 10) and <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/NE/new-england-patriots/\">Patriots</a> (Week 13), but we can evaluate everyone on a weekly basis as the season goes on. </p><p> For now, we're excited that Dart is the starter. He needs to get Nabers the ball, keep Robinson involved and help Skattebo continue to improve. And, if he makes plays on his own, Dart could become a potential Fantasy starter in all leagues.</p></div>\n    </div>\n</article>\n        </div>\n<div>\n    <div>\n            <div>\n    <p><img

    "body": "<div>\n        <p>The Arizona Cardinals host the Seattle Seahawks on 'Thursday Night Football' to open the Week 4 NFL schedule. Kickoff is scheduled for 8:15 p.m. ET at State Farm Stadium and the over/under is 43.5 points. The game features a loaded NFL DFS player pool, with some of the biggest names in the sport like Kyler Murray, Sam Darnold, Marvin Harrison Jr., Jaxon Smith-Njigba, and Trey McBride leading the way. Building successful NFL DFS lineups and NFL DFS stacks will require owners to find the right mix of high-priced players and low-cost values. Who are the top NFL DFS sleepers for TNF? </p><p>Finding undervalued players at a cheap price is still the key to building a winning NFL DFS strategy in Showdown contests -- especially with this matchup featuring so many big-name players. Should you target potential values like Trey Benson, Tory Horton, or Cooper Kupp to pair with the bigger-name players for Thursday Night Football DFS lineups? Before making any NFL DFS picks for Cardinals vs. Seahawks on Thursday Night Football on sites like DraftKings and FanDuel, <a href=\"https://www.sportsline.com/insiders/nfl-dfs-picks-thursday-night-football-seahawks-vs-cardinals-fantasy-lineup-advice-projections-for-draftkings-fanduel-from-millionaire-maker-contest-winner/#ttag=09232025_agg_cbssports_dfs_football_nfl_jimmiekaylor_CardinalsSeahawksDFS\" target=\"_blank\">be sure to check out the NFL DFS lineup advice, strategy and player stacks from SportsLine NFL daily Fantasy expert Jimmie Kaylor</a>. </p><p>Kaylor is a <span><a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/betting/news/nfl/\" target=\"_blank\">NFL betting</a></span> and DFS expert for SportsLine, who opened the 2022 NFL season by winning DraftKings' NFL Showdown Thursday Kickoff Millionaire contest. He edged out over 355,000 other entrants in the contest and also has multiple five-figure tournament wins on his DFS resume. Kaylor has covered the NFL and college football for close to a decade as a member of the Pro Football Writers of America, and his background as a former college and NFL player gives him a unique perspective when building his fantasy lineups and locking in his betting picks. </p><p>Now, Kaylor has turned his attention to the Thursday Night Football matchup of <a href=\"https://www.sportsline.com/nfl/game-forecast/NFL_20250925_SEA@ARI/\" target=\"_blank\">Seahawks vs. Cardinals</a> and just locked in his top daily Fantasy football picks. <a href=\"https://www.sportsline.com/insiders/nfl-dfs-picks-thursday-night-football-seahawks-vs-cardinals-fantasy-lineup-advice-projections-for-draftkings-fanduel-from-millionaire-maker-contest-winner/#ttag=09232025_agg_cbssports_dfs_football_nfl_jimmiekaylor_CardinalsSeahawksDFS\" target=\"_blank\">You can only see his Thursday Night Football DFS picks and analysis at SportsLine</a>.</p><p><em>New users can </em><a href=\"https://martech.cbssports.com/bt/redirect/prod?b=draftkings&c=dfs\" target=\"_blank\"><em>get $50 in Pick6 credits at DraftKings when they play $5</em></a><em>: </em></p><h2>Top NFL DFS picks, lineups, stacks for Cardinals vs. Seahawks</h2><p>One of Kaylor's top DFS picks for Seahawks vs. Cardinals is Seattle quarterback Sam Darnold. The former USC standout had a breakout 2024 season with the Minnesota Vikings: in 17 games as the starter, he completed 361 of 545 passes for 4,319 yards, 35 touchdowns, and 12 interceptions, leading the Vikings to a 14-3 regular season record. That performance earned him his first Pro Bowl selection and a lucrative free-agent contract with the Seahawks.</p><p>In 2025, Darnold has thrown for 663 yards with four touchdowns and two interceptions, and his completion percentage sits at 70.3%. He has a solid core of weapons at his disposal, led by Jaxon Smith-Njigba, Cooper Kupp and rookie Tory Horton. <a href=\"https://www.sportsline.com/insiders/nfl-dfs-picks-thursday-night-football-seahawks-vs-cardinals-fantasy-lineup-advice-projections-for-draftkings-fanduel-from-millionaire-maker-contest-winner/#ttag=09232025_agg_cbssports_dfs_football_nfl_jimmiekaylor_CardinalsSeahawksDFS\" target=\"_blank\">See who else to roster right here</a>.</p><p>Part of Kaylor's optimal NFL DFS strategy also includes rostering Cardinals tight end Trey McBride. The former second-round pick out of Colorado State has played in 52 career games, catching 238 passes for 2,418 yards and seven receiving touchdowns. In 2024, McBride had a breakout year, catching 111 passes for 1,146 yards with two receiving touchdowns while adding one rushing score.</p><p>Through three weeks of the 2025 season, McBride has recorded 17 receptions for 182 yards and one touchdown, averaging over 10 yards per catch.

    "body": "<div>\n        <p>Position battles consume fantasy managers. What if Player X skates with Superstar Y? How does Player Z fit into Team B's power play? No leagues will be won or lost with any of these guys. But speculation is fun. Doesn't every team have a chance to win it all right now? It's fun to be a fan.</p><p>Let's not waste time. Here are some preseason battles that caught my eye.</p><h3><strong>Toronto's RW1 -- <em>Replacing Mitch… Like That's Possible</em></strong></h3><p><strong>Contenders: </strong><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.rotowire.com/hockey/player.php?id=6055\"><strong>Matias Maccelli</strong></a><strong>, LW or </strong><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.rotowire.com/hockey/player.php?id=4155\"><strong>Max Domi</strong></a><strong>, C </strong></p><p>Maccelli is a 24-year-old, massively underrated playmaker set to rebound after falling out of favor with Utah staff last season. Domi is a 30-year-old, edgy playmaker whose fantasy value is tied to his ability to play in the top six. Both have defensive shortcomings. Both can play and set up <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.rotowire.com/hockey/player.php?id=5003\">Auston Matthews</a> and <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.rotowire.com/hockey/player.php?id=6512\">Matthew Knies</a>. <strong>Edge Domi, but watch for a switch to Maccelli mid-season. Coach Craig Berube will tire of Domi's penalty box trips.</strong></p><h3><strong>Toronto's LW2 -- <em>Mad Max's Replacement on Fury Road</em></strong></h3><p><strong>Contenders: </strong><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.rotowire.com/hockey/player.php?id=6653\"><strong>Bobby McMann</strong></a><strong>, C, </strong><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.rotowire.com/hockey/player.php?id=6154\"><strong>Dakota Joshua</strong></a><strong>, C, </strong><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.rotowire.com/hockey/player.php?id=6055\"><strong>Matias Maccelli</strong></a><strong>, LW, or </strong><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.rotowire.com/hockey/player.php?id=4155\"><strong>Max Domi</strong></a><strong>, C</strong></p><p>Willie and J.T. have remarkable chemistry, but over the last five seasons, they've had 19 different sidekicks. <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.rotowire.com/hockey/player.php?id=2809\">Max Pacioretty</a> was a great fit with them last year when he was healthy. Big, smart, and offensively minded. So, who's the next Mad Max? McMann has size and skill, but is inconsistent. Joshua has size, too, and he's willing to work the wall, but his offense is underdeveloped. Maccelli can elevate great goal scorers on his line, but he isn't great in tough areas. Domi was unreliable with and without the puck when he skated on this line last season. <strong>Edge: McMann, but the leash will be short. Joshua could steal time if he can show any offense. Then Maccelli. Domi is top line or third.</strong></p>\n<h3><strong>Edmonton's Top-Six Mash Up --<em> By Any Means Necessary To Get Connor McDavid To Re-Sign</em></strong></h3><p><strong>Contenders: </strong><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.rotowire.com/hockey/player.php?id=4663\"><strong>Andrew Mangiapane</strong></a><strong>, LW, </strong><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.rotowire.com/hockey/player.php?id=7339\"><strong>David Tomasek</strong></a><strong>, C, </strong><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.rotowire.com/hockey/player.php?id=6682\"><strong>Matthew Savoie</strong></a><strong>, C, </strong><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.rotowire.com/hockey/player.php?id=4392\"><strong>Kasperi Kapanen</strong></a><strong>, RW, </strong><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.rotowire.com/hockey/player.php?id=6009\"><strong>Vasily Podkolzin</strong></a><strong>, RW, or </strong><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.rotowire.com/hockey/player.php?id=3743\"><strong>Ryan Nugent-Hopkins</strong></a><strong>, LW (</strong><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.rotowire.com/hockey/player.php?id=4964\"><strong>Zach Hyman</strong></a><strong>, RW)</strong></p><p>The Oilers cannot afford to have three pivots flanked by a cheap buffet of wingers. Not with McSavior unsigned for next season. So, that means either <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.rotowire.com/hockey/player.php?id=4386\">Leon Draisaitl</a> or <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.rotowire.com/hockey/player.php?id=3743\">Ryan Nugent-Hopkins</a> will start at wing this year. My money is on Nugent-Hopkins, at least until Hyman is back from injury in early November. So, who are the next two?</p><p>Mangiapane has a 35-goal season under his belt, and he can play both sides when <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.rotowire.com/hockey/player.php?id=4964\">Zach Hyman</a> (wrist) returns. Tomasek's offense blossomed in the SHL last season, and the 29-year-old inked a one-year deal to finally live his NHL dream. He's a natural pivot, but he can also skate on the wing with stars. Savoie is uber-talented, but inexperienced. Podkolzin needs to prove he can play without crossing the line. Kapanen can't really play with anyone. <strong>RNH then edge Mangiapane and Tomasek.</strong> </p>\n<h3><strong>Ottawa's RW1 --<em> Pinch Me, I'm Playing with </em></strong><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.rotowire.com/hockey/player.php?id=6189\"><strong><em>Tim Stutzle</em></strong></a><strong><em> and </em></strong><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.rotowire.com/hockey/player.php?id=5695\"><strong><em>Brady Tkachuk</em></strong></a></h3><p><strong>Contenders: </strong><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.rotowire.com/hockey/player.php?id=2578\"><strong>Claude Giroux</strong></a><strong>, RW, </strong><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.rotowire.com/hockey/player.php?id=5500\"><strong>Fabian Zetterlund</strong></a><strong>, LW, or </strong><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.rotowire.com/hockey/player.php?id=5604\"><strong>Drake Batherson</strong></a><strong>, RW</strong></p><p>Giroux lost the gig by the end of last season, and Zetterlund took over. The former Shark didn't score much, but he showed promise in limited ice time. Batherson is the wild card here. He can play with stars, but the trio produced just two goals on 57 shots together last year. Batherson is better down the lineup, and he lifts the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.rotowire.com/hockey/player.php?id=5965\">Dylan Cozens</a>/<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.rotowire.com/hockey/player.php?id=2801\">David Perron</a> duo into a powerful trio. <strong>Edge Zetterlund. Giroux's feet are past their best-before date.</strong></p><h3><strong>Philadelphia's 1C -- <em>Who Feeds </em></strong><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.rotowire.com/hockey/player.php?id=6918\"><strong><em>Matvei Michkov</em></strong></a><strong><em>?</em></strong></h3><p><strong>Contenders: </strong><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.rotowire.com/hockey/player.php?id=3746\"><strong>Sean Couturier</strong></a>,<strong> C, or </strong><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.rotowire.com/hockey/player.php?id=5969\"><strong>Trevor Zegras</strong></a><strong>, C</strong></p><p>New coach Rick Tocchet said it best: <em>\"We'd be idiots\"</em> not to try Zegras with Michkov. Zegras has the talent to make a strong connection, but can he stand up to Tocchet's demands? Couturier is five seasons removed from meaningful fantasy production. He's better in a shutdown role. <strong>Edge Zegras.</strong> <strong>He's a risk, but he could also be a home run. </strong></p><h3><strong>Florida's RW2 -- <em>House Panthers Make The Purrfect Pet</em></strong></h3><p><strong>Contenders: </strong><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.rotowire.com/hockey/player.php?id=2905\"><strong>Brad Marchand</strong></a><strong>, C or </strong><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.rotowire.com/hockey/player.php?id=6479\"><strong>Mackie Samoskevich</strong></a><strong>, RW</strong></p><p>Samoskevich can lift you out of your seat with his speed and skill. Marchand does the same with his edginess and skill. Samoskevich is 22. Marchand is 37. The Honey Badger will have his workload managed all season long to save him for a push for a threepeat. So Samoskevich is going to get his chances, and he's going to impress. <strong>The edge goes to Marchand with a BIG BUT. It's a timeshare. </strong></p>\n<h3><strong>Winnipeg's 2C --<em> Some \"Upgrades\" Aren't Worth It</em></strong></h3><p><strong>Contenders: </strong><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.rotowire.com/hockey/player.php?id=3833\"><strong>Adam Lowry</strong></a><strong>, C, </strong><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.rotowire.com/hockey/player.php?id=3777\"><strong>Vladislav Namestnikov</strong></a>,<strong> C, or </strong><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.rotowire.com/hockey/player.php?id=2507\"><strong>Jonathan Toews</strong></a><strong>, C</strong></p><p>This is a bit of a hole, and it could be the undoing of the Jets this season. Especially with Nicholaj Ehlers plying his trade in Carolina. The team's top six is weaker without him, and they did little to upgrade. Lowry (hip) is a perfect 3C. Namestnikov can play the second line in bursts, but he's a better 3C. Toews? I adore the guy, but at 37, his 30-month absence from the NHL means brutal rust, especially on wheels that had already been slowing down. <strong>Edge Toews, BUT only for you to use him as trade bait. Move him if he can get off to a solid start. Don't be emotional about it. </strong></p><h3><strong>Montreal's 2C -- <em>Ugly, But It Fits</em></strong></h3><p><strong>Contenders: </strong><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.rotowire.com/hockey/player.php?id=5964\"><strong>Kirby Dach</strong></a><strong>, C, </strong><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.rotowire.com/hockey/player.php?id=5977\"><strong>Alex Newhook</strong></a><strong>, C or </strong><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.rotowire.com/hockey/player.php?id=6474\"><strong>Zachary Bolduc</strong></a><strong>, RW </strong></p><p>No matter who skates as the 2C, the gig won't last. The Habs are looking for an upgrade and haven't really been shy about it. Both Dach and Newhook have pedigree, but at 24, both are aging out of their potential. Bolduc is a sleeper here. The Quebec native has real talent, and he simply needs development to become a fan favorite and a fantasy contributor. That might be in 2026-27, though. <strong>Edge to no one, unless you're in a dynasty format. Then it's Bolduc all the way. </strong></p><h3><strong>Buffalo LW1 -- <em> </em></strong><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.rotowire.com/hockey/player.php?id=5172\"><strong><em>Tage Thompson</em></strong></a><strong><em>'s New Best Friend</em></strong></h3><p><strong>Contenders: </strong><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.rotowire.com/hockey/player.php?id=6932\"><strong>Zach Benson</strong></a><strong>, LW or </strong><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.rotowire.com/hockey/player.php?id=3556\"><strong>Jason Zucker</strong></a><strong>, LW</strong></p><p>This isn't really a fair fight. The gig beside TNT is Benson's to lose, even though Zucker produced 53 points last season. The much younger Benson is poised for a 55-point breakout this year. But Zucker is still a solid fantasy player because of his power play role. <strong>Edge Benson. I can't wait to start calling them Shrek and Donkey… get it?</strong></p>\n<h3><strong>New York Islanders 6D -- <em>Please Don't Break The Kid</em></strong></h3><p><strong>Contenders: </strong><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.rotowire.com/hockey/player.php?id=7359\"><strong>Matthew Schaefer</strong></a><strong>, D or </strong><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.rotowire.com/hockey/player.php?id=5693\"><strong>Adam Boqvist</strong></a><strong>, D</strong></p><p>This is a no-brainer. Seriously. Schaefer turned 18 on September 5. New GM Mathieu Darche will bring the Tampa Bay patience to Long Island. He's also not a stupid man. <strong>Edge Boqvist. Don't break the kid.</strong></p><h3><strong>New York Islanders Top Six --<em> Pick Four, Any Four… Well, Not ANY Four</em></strong></h3><p><strong>Contenders: LW: </strong><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.rotowire.com/hockey/player.php?id=4073\"><strong>Jonathan Drouin</strong></a><strong>, </strong><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.rotowire.com/hockey/player.php?id=3685\"><strong>Anders Lee</strong></a><strong>, </strong><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.rotowire.com/hockey/player.php?id=4228\"><strong>Anthony Duclair</strong></a> <strong>RW: </strong><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.rotowire.com/hockey/player.php?id=7508\"><strong>Maxim Shabanov</strong></a><strong>, </strong><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.rotowire.com/hockey/player.php?id=3272\"><strong>Kyle Palmieri</strong></a><strong>, </strong><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.rotowire.com/hockey/player.php?id=6039\"><strong>Simon Holmstrom</strong></a></p><p>Training camp opened with Lee and Palmieri skating with <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.rotowire.com/hockey/player.php?id=4778\">Mathew Barzal</a>, and Drouin and Shabanov slotted with <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.rotowire.com/hockey/player.php?id=4156\">Bo Horvat</a>. Will those lines stick? Not if <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.rotowire.com/hockey/player.php?id=4228\">Anthony Duclair</a> has a say in it. Duclair and coach Patrick Roy have mended their fences, and the winger has something to prove after a bad season. Shabanov has a lot to prove on the NHL's small ice. Drouin will excel, especially with the Avs' former power-play coach now on the Island. And he can play right wing. <strong>Edge? Lee and Palmieri seem like they're locked together. Drouin is a sure thing. Duclair will push Shabanov… maybe as far as the AHL.</strong></p>\n<h3><strong>Dallas' Power Play QB1 -- <em>What a Beautiful Problem To Have</em></strong></h3><p><strong>Contenders: </strong><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.rotowire.com/hockey/player.php?id=5534\"><strong>Miro Heiskanen</strong></a><strong>, D or </strong><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.rotowire.com/hockey/player.php?id=5971\"><strong>Thomas Harley</strong></a><strong>, D</strong></p><p>Both men can run the top unit. Harley emerged as the team's top option last year, and he can fire the puck. Heiskanen is more of a distributor, and he took a step back in 2024-25. Can the former take things higher? Yes. Will the latter ever come close to those 73 points he put up in 2022-23? No. Both can be 55-60 point, number one studs. <strong>Edge Harley because of the goals. But it's close.</strong> </p>\n            </div>"

None of those wins came with <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/2180320/sam-darnold/\">Sam Darnold</a> under center, but the well-traveled quarterback has been among the best versus the spread in recent seasons. Darnold is 17-9-1 ATS since the start of 2022, with that 65% cover rate the second-best amongst quarterbacks over this span.</p><p>Since Mike Macdonald became Seattle's head coach in 2024, Seattle is 5-1 ATS as a road underdog. This year's squad is excelling on both sides of the ball, ranking in the top five in both scoring offense and scoring defense. Seattle is the only NFL team that hasn't allowed a rushing touchdown this year, making it an even more arduous task for Arizona to find success on the ground as the team lost 1,000-yard rusher <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/2071585/james-conner/\">James Conner</a> (leg) for the season on Sunday. <a href=\"https://www.sportsline.com/insiders/seahawks-vs-cardinals-prediction-line-odds-proven-model-releases-spread-pick-for-2025-nfl-week-4-thursday-night-football/#ttag=09222025_agg_cbssports_picks_football_nfl_model_SeahawksCardinalsTNF\" target=\"_blank\">See which team to back at SportsLine</a>. </p><h2>Why the Cardinals can cover</h2><p>Despite coming off a loss to San Francisco, Arizona did manage to cover in the game and is now 10-4 ATS over its last 14 games. Head coach Jonathan Gannon continues to work wonders on the defensive side of the ball as the Cards ranked 31st in scoring defense in 2023, then 15th in 2024 and are now fifth this season. The Cardinals make an opponent one-dimensional on offense and then perform their best in clutch situations as Arizona ranks top-five in rushing defense, third-down defense and redzone defense.</p><p>While Conner's injury is an emotional setback for Arizona, it does allow the team to utilize second-year back, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/3176915/trey-benson/\">Trey Benson</a>, more.

Additionally, just four teams have a better turnover differential than the Cards, which the model has taken into account.

The predicted finish pointed to the Sooners ending the year at 9-3 overall with five wins over nationally ranked teams but skipped over by the selection committee in favor of a two-loss, ACC runner-up <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/teams/GATECH/georgia-tech-yellow-jackets/\">Georgia Tech</a>.</p><p>Ten wins is the magic number in the SEC to all but guarantee playoff inclusion considering how many ranked teams are within the league at this very moment. However, if there's a Power Four team capable of reaching the playoff as a three-loss at-large, the Sooners fit the bill given the strength of schedule edge they're going to have against other competitors in the mix. </p><p>No team currently ranked inside this week's AP poll squares off with as many top 25 opponents as the Sooners the rest of the way. That's both a gift and a potential curse for Brent Venables, who's now facing the arduous task of taking the field without his front-running Heisman candidate for the next several weeks.</p>\n<h2>Oklahoma's remaining schedule</h2><ul><li>vs. Kent State, Oct. 4<br /></li><li>vs. No. 10 Texas, Oct. 11</li><li>at South Carolina, Oct. 18</li><li>No. 13 Ole Miss, Oct. 25</li><li>No. 15 at <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/teams/TENN/tennessee-volunteers/\">Tennessee</a>, Nov. 1</li><li>at No. 17 <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/teams/BAMA/alabama-crimson-tide/\">Alabama</a>, Nov. 15</li><li>No. 20 <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/teams/MIZZOU/missouri-tigers/\">Missouri</a>, Nov. 22</li><li>No. 4 LSU, Nov. 29</li></ul><p>It's an absolute gauntlet of a second-half slate for the Sooners. A 5-2 finish over those seven conference games, coupled with wins over <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/teams/MICH/michigan-wolverines/\">Michigan</a> and Auburn already in the Sooners' back pocket, should be enough to get to the playoff. Looking ahead, if Mateer's pain tolerance is high and he's able to return to the field against Ole Miss at the end of next month or sooner, that could set up well for Oklahoma.</p><p>As for the playoff selection process, the committee factors in availability of key players according to their own guidelines, so Oklahoma wouldn't necessarily be docked if, say, the Sooners finish 10-2 and both of those losses come with Mateer sidelined.</p><p><span><a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/news/explaining-the-college-football-playoffs-new-strength-of-schedule-metric-and-the-secs-campaign-behind-it/\" target=\"_blank\">Record strength is another factor</a></span> to consider, here. The playoff announced over the summer will use an \"enhanced\" tool to further emphasize strength of schedule in its selection process this season. It emphasizes extra credit for beating quality teams, while lessening the penalty for losses against tougher opponents. Additionally, the existing strength of schedule metric has been adjusted to further err towards playing higher-level foes. </p>\n<p>The big picture for the Sooners alters considerably if Mateer's recovery is long-term and he misses most of his team's final remaining six contests with nationally-ranked SEC opponents.</p>\n            </div>"

The <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/teams/WASHST/washington-state-cougars/\">Washington State</a> transfer had the second-best odds to win Heisman Trophy after leading the Sooners to two ranked victories in their first four games. </p><p>According to ESPN, Mateer is expected to miss approximately one month with the injury. That timeline would mean he will miss the Red River Rivalry game against No. 10 <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/teams/TEXAS/texas-longhorns/\">Texas</a> and likely a road trip to <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/teams/SC/south-carolina-gamecocks/\">South Carolina</a>.

Hawkins was rated a three-star recruit and the No. 35 quarterback in the Class of 2024 out of Frisco, Texas, according to 247Sports. He fielded offers from a number of major programs, but decided to enroll only a couple hours away at Oklahoma. </p><p>Hawkins showed intriguing flashes during his freshman season, throwing for 783 yards, rushing for 204 yards and scoring four total touchdowns in seven appearances. However, Texas shut him down last year in Red River, holding him to 175 total yards in a 34-3 shellacking at the Cotton Bowl. Hawkins eventually played poorly enough against South Carolina that Arnold was reinserted into the lineup. Hawkins started his final game in the Armed Forces Bowl, a 21-20 loss against <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/teams/NAVY/navy-midshipmen/\">Navy</a>. </p><p>Oklahoma invested heavily to bring offensive coordinator Ben Arbuckle from Washington State. He will have his work cut out trying to put Hawkins in manageable positions. </p>\n<h2>Wild cards</h2><p>Oklahoma anticipated needing to beef up its quarterback room after the disastrous 2024 season and added <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/teams/MERCER/mercer-bears/\">Mercer</a> transfer <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/players/29405173/whitt-newbauer/\">Whitt Newbauer</a> over the offseason. As a freshman, Newbauer threw for 1,398 yards, 12 touchdowns and four interceptions at the FCS level. He handled himself well against <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/teams/BAMA/alabama-crimson-tide/\">Alabama</a>, throwing for 140 yards and a touchdown while completing 68% of his passes. </p><p>Additionally, 2025 recruit <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/players/29280537/jett-niu/\">Jett Niu</a> joined the program as a three-star prospect after flipping from <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/teams/OKLAST/oklahoma-state-cowboys/\">Oklahoma State</a> late in the cycle. Niu was recruited by Arbuckle at Washington State before joining him in Norman. </p><h2>Big shoes to fill</h2><p>Mateer has been one of the most dynamic players in football to start the year, ranking No. 2 nationally in total offense with 351.3 yards per game. In fact, non-Mateer players at Oklahoma have mustered only 80 yards per game as running backs have combined for only 280 yards rushing in four games. Plenty will be put on the shoulders of Hawkins to save an OU offense that ranked only No. 50 nationally even with Mateer in the lineup. </p>\n            </div>"

As was the case last year, Crown Jewel will be anchored by matches between WWE's top men's and women's champions for the honorary Crown Jewel championship.</p><p>For the men, that means a match between world heavyweight champion Seth Rollins and undisputed WWE champion Cody Rhodes. The women's Crown Jewel championship match is still up in the air as women's world champion Stephanie Vaquer waits to see who emerges as WWE women's champion from an upcoming championship triple threat match on SmackDown.</p><p>John Cena will also be in action for one of the final matches of his career when he takes on an old rival in AJ Styles.</p><a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/wwe/news/wwe-hall-of-fame-2026-stephanie-mcmahon-becomes-first-inductee-to-next-class-after-undertakers-surprise/\" target=\"_blank\">\n        <div>\n            <div>\n                <p>WWE Hall of Fame 2026: Stephanie McMahon becomes first inductee to next class after Undertaker's surprise</p>\n                <p>\n                    Shakiel Mahjouri                </p>\n            </div>\n                            <div>\n    <figure><img alt=\"WWE Hall of Fame 2026: Stephanie McMahon becomes first inductee to next class after Undertaker's surprise\" src=\"https://sportshub.cbsistatic.com/i/r/2025/09/21/4c7f6d7d-c427-484b-a45e-757c38e65b74/thumbnail/270x152/0f4cca3123a1cf94fb4f003fa58c11d7/pay14-photo-190.jpg\" /></figure>\n                </div>\n                    </div>\n    </a>\n<p>Let's take a look at what we know -- and what we expect -- from Crown Jewel, which takes place Oct. 11 from RAC Arena in Perth, Australia.</p><h2>2025 WWE Crown Jewel matches</h2><p><strong>Men's Crown Jewel Championship</strong> <strong>-- Cody Rhodes vs. Seth Rollins:</strong> Rhodes and Rollins came face-to-face shortly after Wrestlepalooza, knowing the champion vs. champion match was more or less locked in. Rollins has questioned what Rhodes thinks of him and his \"vision\" for the future of wrestling, while Rhodes has questioned why Rollins needs the backup of \"goons\" if he's the best in the world. These two have a fairly lengthy history, dating back to Rhodes being Rollins' surprise opponent at WrestleMania 38 in Rhodes' return to WWE.</p>\n<p><strong>Women's Crown Jewel Championship -- Stephanie Vaquer vs. TBD:</strong> Vaquer won the women's world championship at Wrestlepalooza and is now waiting to see who will emerge from the Sept. 26 triple threat match between WWE women's champion Tiffany Stratton, Jade Cargill and Nia Jax. Whoever wins the title will face Vaquer at Crown Jewel.</p><p><strong>AJ Styles vs. John Cena:</strong> Cena and Styles had some fantastic matches around 2017. Those matches were among the best of Cena's entire career. That is pretty much the entire storyline of why this match is happening, with no real animosity or storyline beyond. Of course, maybe Cena has to deal with a surprise attack from someone like Brock Lesnar once again as his final days in WWE wind down.</p><h2>2025 WWE Crown Jewel predictions</h2><p><strong>Asuka & Kairi Sane vs. Iyo Sky & Rhea Ripley:</strong> After weeks of teasing a split, Asuka finally turned on Sky after Sky protected Ripley following an Asuka mist attack. Sane has sided with Asuka because Asuka is why Sane and Sky are in WWE to begin with. A tag match seems like an easy enough next step in the story and would fill time on the card well.</p>\n<p><strong>United States Championship -- Sami Zayn (c) vs. Solo Sikoa:</strong> Zayn's issues with Solo and the MFTs don't seem to have run their course. Add in that Sikoa has not received a championship rematch since dropping the belt to Zayn, and you have the recipe for an easy high-stakes title match to add to the show.</p>\n            </div>"
