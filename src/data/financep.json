But bond traders saw the move as an opportunity to \"sell the news\" after recent bond gains, according to Peter Boockvar, chief investment officer at One Point BFG Wealth Partners.</p><p>Traders of longer-dated bonds \"don't want the Fed to be cutting interest rates,\" Boockvar said.</p><p>Their selling of long-term bonds drove down the price and drove up the yield. Prices and yields for bonds move in an inverse direction.</p><p>Easing monetary policy at a time when inflation is running above the Fed's 2% target and the economy looks steady can indicate the central bank is \"taking the eye off\" inflation, Boockvar said, a key risk to longer duration securities. Updated economic projections from the Fed released Wednesday showed policymakers seeing <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2025/09/17/fed-forecasts-only-one-rate-cut-in-2026-a-more-conservative-outlook-than-expected.html\">slightly faster inflation </a>next year<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2025/09/17/fed-forecasts-only-one-rate-cut-in-2026-a-more-conservative-outlook-than-expected.html\">.</a></p></div><div><div><svg width=\"256\" height=\"256\">Stock Chart IconStock chart icon</svg><p><img src=\"https://static-redesign.cnbcfm.com/dist/a54b41835a8b60db28c2.svg\" alt=\"hide content\" /></p></div><p>30-year Treasury yield, 1 month</p></div><div><p>Investors have been looking for the Fed to shift its emphasis from fighting inflation to boosting the labor market following <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2025/09/09/jobs-report-revisions-september-2025-.html\">weak employment data earlier this month.</a> Fed Chair Jerome Powell <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2025/09/17/fed-meeting-today-live-updates.html\">called Wednesday's rate cut </a>a \"risk management\" move, pointing to the softening labor market.</p><p>\"The bond market, if [longer yields] continue higher, would be sending a message that, 'We don't think you should be aggressively cutting interest rates with inflation stuck at 3%,'\" Boockvar said.</p><p>Additionally, Boockvar said higher yields this week came after longer-dated bond prices had steadily risen in recent months, sending yields lower. It was a similar move as was seen following the Fed's rate cut in September of last year, he noted.</p></div><div><div><svg width=\"256\" height=\"256\">Stock Chart IconStock chart icon</svg><p><img src=\"https://static-redesign.cnbcfm.com/dist/a54b41835a8b60db28c2.svg\" alt=\"hide content\" /></p></div><p>10-year Treasury yield, 6 months</p></div><div><p>But Boockvar said it's noteworthy that the 10-year note yield is little changed compared with early 2024, despite the Fed cutting rates multiple times since then.</p><p>A rise in longer-term yields can have implications for mortgage loans on big-ticket purchases like homes and autos as well as credit card costs. Mortgage rates <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/video/2025/09/18/mortgage-rates-up-after-fed-rate-cut.html\">rose following the Fed rate cut this week</a> after reaching <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2025/09/16/mortgage-rates-drop-to-3-year-low-ahead-of-fed-meeting.html\">a three-year low</a> ahead of the central bank action.</p><p>Homebuilder <span><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/LEN/\">Lennar</a><span><span></span></span></span> on Thursday missed Wall Street's revenue expectations for the third quarter and gave weak guidance for deliveries in the current quarter. Co-CEO Stuart Miller said in a statement that Miami-based Lennar faced \"continued pressures\" in today's housing market and \"elevated\" interest rates for much of the third quarter.</p><h3>Looking for 'terrible news'</h3><p>While the stock market can move significantly on one rate cut, bond investors are trying to make decisions based on what it sees as the bigger picture, according to Chris Rupkey, chief economist at FWDBONDS.</p><p>\"It's not the journey, it's the destination,\" he said. That can be determined in part by looking at the central bank's projections for future rate cuts and the perceived neutral rate on the Fed funds rate.</p><p>\"They're trying to assess: What's the end game in this?,\" Rupkey said. \"The bond market really will react once it is assured that the central bank is going to lower the rates dramatically.\"</p><p>One Point's Boockvar said longer-term U.S. yields can also be influenced by their international counterparts, which also tend to be moving higher, making it key to follow overseas economic developments and moves by foreign central banks.</p><p>Still, investors should be careful what they wish for when it comes to long-dated yields, Rupkey warned.</p><p>Yield declines often signal a recession on the horizon, the economist said. In fact, Rupkey attributed this week's yield jumps in part to falling unemployment filings, which suggest less risk of an economic downturn anytime soon.</p><p>\"Don't rejoice so much about getting bond yields down, because it may mean that it's impossible for you to find work,\" Rupkey said.</p><p>\"Unfortunately, the bond market only really embraces bad news,\" he added. And \"not just bad news ... terrible news.\"</p><p><em>— CNBC's Fred Imbert and Diana Olick contributed to this report.</em></p></div></div>"

    "body": "<div><div><p>Many parents think kids develop <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2025/02/23/kids-with-the-best-people-skills-have-parents-who-do-these-things-therapist.html\">strong social skills</a> from memorizing phrases like \"please\" and \"thank you.\" But the real foundation is built much earlier, at home and through everyday interactions.</p><p>I've studied over <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/reem-raouda/\">200 parent-child relationships</a>, and I'm a mother myself. I've found that kids learn to communicate and connect by watching how their parents behave. And being raised in an environment where <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2025/05/25/ive-studied-over-200-kids-emotionally-safe-parenting-is-the-new-parenting-style-that-works-better-than-the-rest.html\">emotional safety</a> and <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2025/03/30/psychologist-parents-who-have-close-bonds-with-their-adult-kids-do-7-things.html\">authentic connection</a> are modeled makes a world of difference.</p><p>Here are nine things that parents who raise kids with exceptional social skills do early on.</p></div><h2><a></a>1. They talk openly about feelings and emotions</h2><div><p>Kids learn emotional vocabulary when parents name and normalize feelings.</p><p>Parents who say things like, \"I feel disappointed we can't go today, but I'll take a deep breath and try again tomorrow,\" are modeling <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2025/09/14/ive-worked-with-over-1000-kids-the-no-1-phrase-to-validate-your-child-at-every-age.html\">emotional regulation</a> in real time. It helps kids later express themselves with friends, like saying, \"I'm sad you didn't play with me,\" instead of lashing out.</p></div><h2><a></a>2. They model empathy in everyday life</h2><div><p>Children absorb how parents treat others: the neighbor, the cashier, and even each other.</p><p>A simple, “She has her hands full, so let's hold the door for her,” teaches more about empathy than any lecture. Small daily acts of kindness become the blueprint for lifelong social awareness.</p></div><h2><a></a>3. They foster real, authentic confidence</h2><div><p>True confidence comes from being loved as you are and from being given the chance to try (and sometimes fail).</p><p>Letting kids try out for the team or pour their own milk, even if it gets messy, says: \"I trust you.\" When paired with encouragement like, \"I love how you kept trying,\" kids feel capable and connected, without needing to be perfect.</p></div><h2><a></a>4. They teach how to make things right after conflict</h2><div><p>Every relationship includes conflict. What matters is whether kids learn how to repair.</p><p>Parents who say, \"You hurt your sister's feelings. Let’s think of what we can say or do to make it right,\" are teaching a critical life skill: Repair strengthens relationships, and kids who learn it early grow into adults who can sustain healthy bonds.</p></div><h2><a></a>5. They validate their child's feelings</h2><h2><a></a>6. They help their kids recognize social cues</h2><div><p>Kids don't always pick up on social dynamics naturally. Parents who gently point out, \"Did you notice how his voice got quiet? He might be feeling shy,\" help kids tune into the subtleties of human interaction.</p><p>These micro-lessons add up and shape <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2025/02/23/kids-with-the-best-people-skills-have-parents-who-do-these-things-therapist.html\">socially aware</a>, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2023/07/27/quiz-do-you-have-high-emotional-intelligence.html\">emotionally intelligent adults</a>.</p></div><h2><a></a>7. They don't rush in to solve every conflict for their child</h2><div><p>The second kids argue, the impulse is often to intervene. But the best social learning happens when parents step back just enough.</p><p>Saying, \"I'm here if you need help, but I think you two can work it out,\" creates space for problem-solving and compromise. With time, kids learn they can handle conflict themselves because they were trusted to practice.</p></div><h2><a></a>8. They treat mistakes as learning opportunities</h2><div><p>When parents treat mistakes as evidence of growth, kids build resilience instead of shame.</p><p>A parent who calmly says, “You spilled the juice. Let’s grab a towel and clean it up,” models accountability without humiliation. Children raised this way see mistakes as opportunities to learn. That mindset makes them more adaptable and compassionate with others.</p></div><h2><a></a>9. They listen more than they lecture</h2><div><p>Kids need to see what good listening looks like.</p><p>When parents pause, make eye contact, give full attention (without rushing to fix or interrupt) and say, \"Tell me more about that,\" they teach how to be patient and respectful. Over time, kids carry this into friendships, becoming the kind of people others feel safe opening up to.</p><p>Good social skills are becoming more and more important in today's world, and those skills grow from connection and emotional safety.

That's the biggest jump in any of the 50 largest U.S. cities for the one-year period.</p><p>Most of the cities SmartAsset analyzed experienced more significant income growth than at the national level. The median incomes in just five of the largest U.S. cities grew slower than the national median between 2023 and 2024, and incomes shrank in only seven cities.</p><p>\"The economic dynamics of big cities lend to a lot more volatility and potential for wage-growth events, such as attracting new businesses and new population cohorts,\" Jaclyn DeJohn, director of economic analysis at SmartAsset, tells CNBC Make It. \"By comparison, suburban and urban areas less frequently see such shocks to the economic system, making year-over-year changes less likely and less severe.\"</p><p>Here are the 10 U.S. cities that saw incomes grow the fastest between 2023 and 2024, according to SmartAsset.</p></div><h2><a></a>Seniors boost income growth in Tampa</h2><div><p>Much of the income growth in Tampa can be attributed to its senior population, which saw its income rise over 17% between 2023 and 2024, SmartAsset reports. Meanwhile, incomes among families with children under 18 dropped by over 6%.</p><p>\"Florida is famous for <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2025/07/05/us-states-attracting-the-most-retirees.html\">attracting seniors</a> due to the weather, taxes and other amenities,\" DeJohn says. \"When seniors decide to move in from other states, they often come with new money, making the senior households metric in Tampa and other Floridian cities particularly prone to potential volatility year to year.\"</p><p>Florida had the largest net inflow of retirees of all the states in 2023, according to a <a href=\"https://smartasset.com/data-studies/where-retirees-move-2025\" target=\"_blank\">SmartAsset analysis</a> of the most recent Census Bureau data. Tampa, however, had a net decrease in residents ages 60 and over.</p></div><h2><a></a>How median incomes compare with income growth</h2><div><p>Long Beach, California, had the second-fastest median income growth in the country at about 12%. But senior and family incomes rose similarly there, at rates of about 15% and 17%, respectively. Rather, in California, many of the cities with the fastest income growth are also home to some of the<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2025/06/14/middle-class-salary-in-biggest-us-cities.html\"> highest-earning households</a> in the country.</p><p>San Jose and San Francisco had the highest and second-highest median household incomes in the U.S., respectively, in 2023 and retained those positions in 2024, according to SmartAsset's analysis. Both major tech hubs <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2025/01/16/these-us-cities-have-the-most-jobs-paying-over-500000.html\">ripe with high-paying roles</a>, the cities already had median incomes significantly higher than other cities and experienced major growth over the year.</p><p>\"High profits [at tech companies] turn into high competition for talent for businesses to stay ahead, and so employers in the Silicon Valley area may hike pay to retain or attract talent on a continuous basis,\" DeJohn says.</p><p>On the other hand, the income growth in five cities with some of the fastest rises in the country still wasn't enough to bring median incomes up to or above the national median household income of $83,730.</p><p>In Baltimore, for example, the median household income rose 8.73% — the seventh-fastest growth of a major city. But it started at just $59,579 in 2023, so it remained just below $65,000 in 2024.</p><p><em><strong>Want to be your own boss?</strong> Sign up for Smarter by CNBC Make It's new online course, </em><a href=\"https://smarter.cnbcmakeit.com/p/how-to-start-a-business-for-first-time-founders?utm_source=cnbc&amp;utm_medium=makeitarticle&amp;utm_campaign=bottom\" target=\"_blank\"><em>How To Start A Business: For First-Time Founders</em></a><em>.

    "body": "<div><div><p><a href=\"https://cbwarburg.com/agent/nev-schulman\" target=\"_blank\">Nēv Schulman</a> has been hosting the MTV series \"Catfish: The TV Show\" since 2012 and along with honing the skill of internet stalking, the 40-year-old star has learned a thing or two that he's putting to use in his new career as a licensed real estate agent in New York City.</p><p>Schulman tells CNBC Make It that the No. 1 skill he's learned from hosting the show is really listening to people when they are talking.</p><p>\"A part of that is also being able to ask the right questions and help people, in some cases, to discover what it is they are trying to say. When it comes to buying a home, it's very similar in many ways to falling in love or choosing a partner,\" he says.</p><p>\"There are so many boxes to check and sometimes you have to compromise but understanding what really matters and what your core values are and what the core characteristics of a partner or home is and being able to help someone discuss that and discover it for themselves and community it to me is a very meaningful bonus, having done it for the past 15 years.\"</p></div><div><p>Schulman started working as a licensed real estate agent in August of this year.</p><p>Coldwell Banker Warburg</p></div><div><p>Schulman says hosting \"Catfish: The TV Show\" taught him how to find workarounds that he is using now to do things like get appointments for his clients.</p><p>\"I'm so used to being told no and hitting dead ends, especially when it comes to searching for things,\" he adds. \"I think not getting discouraged and not taking no for an answer is a really good skill that I've built over the years making the show.\"</p><p>Getting into real estate was something that felt very natural to Schulman. He was born in New York City and grew up watching his dad, Robert Schulman, working as a broker at Coldwell Banker Warburg. His grandfather, Lowell Schulman, also worked in the industry, but as a builder and developer, before he died in 2017.</p><p>\"I've grown up in the city and have lived in so many different neighborhoods. Life in New York City is so much about your apartment and your neighborhood. You really want to feel good about where you're going and your apartment becomes this sort of haven and place to recharge and I think that's why I've always loved it,\" Schulman says.</p><p>Schulman says his dad approached him about joining him at Coldwell Banker Warburg, and it made the \"Catfish\" star really start thinking about his future and what else he could do with his career.</p><p>\"I thought this was the perfect time to give it a try, and here I am,\" he says.</p><p><em><strong>Want to be your own boss?</strong> Sign up for Smarter by CNBC Make It's new online course, </em><a href=\"https://smarter.cnbcmakeit.com/p/how-to-start-a-business-for-first-time-founders?utm_source=cnbc&amp;utm_medium=makeitarticle&amp;utm_campaign=bottom\" target=\"_blank\"><em>How To Start A Business: For First-Time Founders</em></a><em>.

    "body": "<div><p>For some brides and grooms, the prospect of writing and publicly reciting their wedding vows can be daunting.</p><p>That's where Katelyn Peterson comes in.</p><p>Peterson, 37, is the founder and CEO of Wedding Words, a wedding vow and speech-writing business, and she's passionate about helping \"tongue-tied\" couples express themselves.</p><p>\"I got into this business to help people put their heart into words,\" Peterson says.</p><p>Since founding Wedding Words eight years ago, Peterson has turned her writing talent into business bringing in six figures a year, and she's written over 700 speeches for couples, bridal party members and parents.</p><p>Peterson worked in sales for years before founding Wedding Words, but she's always considered herself \"a writer at heart.\"</p><p>The catalyst for her career change came in 2017, when Peterson's father asked her for help writing her grandfather's eulogy.</p><p>Her father's original draft sounded \"like it could have been written about anyone's dad or anyone's grandpa,\" Peterson recalls.</p><p>Peterson helped her father rewrite the eulogy to include meaningful memories and details about her grandfather.</p><p>Her father's response touched her: \"He said, 'This is exactly what I wanted to say. I just didn't know how to put it into words,' and he had tears in his eyes,\" Peterson recalls.</p><p>That experience inspired Peterson to start Wedding Words just a few months later.</p><p>\"I thought, there have to be other people that have these milestone moments that they really want to do emotional justice to, but they just don't know how to put it into words,\" she says.</p><h3><strong>Hitting 'an emotional chord'</strong></h3><p>One of the most common misconceptions Peterson hears about her work is that people who hire her \"just don't care enough\" to write their speeches themselves.</p><p>\"I think it's quite the opposite,\" she says. \"I think you care so much that you feel like you can't do it on your own.\"</p><p>Peterson begins her process with an introductory video call, during which she and the client talk about their goals for the speech, and Peterson teases out significant details and key stories to include.</p><p>The process is often emotional, Peterson says, and clients cry \"all the time.\"</p><p>\"We're hitting an emotional chord,\" she says. \"We're getting somewhere deep, and that's a good thing.\"</p><p>After Peterson drafts the speech, she and the client go over revisions in another video call, before finalizing the speech and practicing it out loud.</p><p>\"Writing is half of it, but it's also making sure your delivery is done in a way that hits those emotional and humorous beats,\" Peterson says.</p><p>By the end of the last call, clients almost always let out a visible sigh of relief, Peterson says.</p><p>\"They're like, 'I feel so much better. I can't believe I'm actually excited to say this speech in front of 200 people,'\" she says. \"That's the moment that I know, OK, I did my job.\"</p><h3><strong>The need for 'human storytelling'</strong></h3><p>Starting a speech-writing business from scratch wasn't easy. In the beginning, Peterson spent hours scouring wedding Facebook groups in search of potential clients.</p><p>She took on her first clients for free, instead asking them to share a review or testimonial on her site.</p><p>\"I found that people weren't ready to pay me to write something so personal without hearing what the experience is like from other people,\" she says.</p><p>Soon, Peterson was able to start charging a \"nominal fee\" of $350 for speechwriting services, and the business grew from there, she says.</p><p>Peterson currently charges $999 to write and edit wedding speeches, and $499 for a \"Power Hour\" editing session.</p><p>Wedding Words' monthly revenue was over $8,000 in August, according to documents reviewed by CNBC Make It, and the company consistently brings in six figures in gross revenue each year.</p><p>A point of pride for Peterson is that Wedding Words is entirely self-funded, and the business has been profitable since day one, she says.</p><p>Until this year, Peterson was the company's only employee — \"I was super, super precious with not outsourcing my writing for the longest time,\" she says — but she realized that scaling the business would require some extra hands.</p><p>Peterson hired a full-time writer earlier this year, and she's in the process of onboarding a second.</p><p>\"The goal is to be able to serve more clients more quickly and keep it a lower price point as a result,\" she says.</p><p>As a writer, Peterson's business has definitely been impacted by AI.</p><p>She says Wedding Words' blog has lost half of its web traffic in the past year, and some of her competitors are churning out content at a rapid rate using AI tools.</p><p>Still, Peterson is less concerned about AI impacting Wedding Words' long term revenue.</p><p>\"The people that are happy using AI tools to write their wedding speech are not my clients,\" she says. \"My clients value human storytelling.\"</p><p>\"No matter what changes in the technical world, there is still a need for human touch and the human heart, and I don't think that that's ever gonna go away,\" she continues.</p><p><em><strong>Want to be your own boss?</strong> Sign up for Smarter by CNBC Make It's new online course, </em><a href=\"https://smarter.cnbcmakeit.com/p/how-to-start-a-business-for-first-time-founders?utm_source=cnbc&amp;utm_medium=makeitarticle&amp;utm_campaign=bottom\" target=\"_blank\"><em>How To Start A Business: For First-Time Founders</em></a><em>.

I'm a free spirit, so they accepted it,\" Smith says. \"They were a little bit nervous for me, but after virtually meeting my boss and seeing how well prepared I was, they weren't that concerned anymore.\"</p></div><div><p>One of Smith's favorite design features of her apartment is her walk-in closet.</p><p>Naotomo Umewaka for CNBC Make It</p></div><div><p>Smith's employment contract includes her employer covering the costs of some expenses, like key money —a one-time, non-refundable payment given to the landlord when renting an apartment or house. Smith also didn't have to put down a security deposit, which is usually the case in the U.S. Her employer also pays for her fire insurance.</p><p>The apartment also came with a portable washer in her bathroom, and she uses the balcony to dry her clothes. One of the unique aspects of the apartment is that it came with an emergency bag containing items, like a safety helmet, needed in case of events like a tsunami, fire or earthquake.</p><p>Some of Smith's other monthly expenses include water, gas, electricity, health insurance, and groceries, which total approximately $376 a month.</p></div><div><p>Smith's apartment also has a balcony.</p><p>Naotomo Umewaka for CNBC Make It</p></div><div><p>Though Smith is enjoying her time in Japan, she already knows she will move back to Atlanta at the end of her one-year contract.</p><p>\"There is a big part of me that does want to stay longer than a year in Japan, but there's so much of the world to see. As much as I love Japan, I can't wait to also expand myself to see the rest of the world as well,\" Smith says. </p><p>\"I miss my family. We're really close-knit, so it's hard being 7,000 miles away from them, but also being a Southern girl, I miss my soul food so much. Japan's food is great, but there's nothing like a good collard green at the end of the day.\"</p><p>Smith still isn't sure what she'll do when she moves back to the U.S., but is considering pursuing a graduate degree or a return to teaching.</p><p>\"I'm not quite sure what the future holds for me, but I'm excited to take whatever path it has,\" she says.</p></div><div><p>Smith's apartment came with an emergency kit in case of tsunamis, earthquakes and fires.</p><p>Naotomo Umewaka for CNBC Make It</p></div><div><p>One way that Smith is making sure she gets the most out of her experience living in Japan is by documenting her journey on social media, which is she started doing three months after relocating.</p><p>\"I decided to start sharing my experience because people don't know what regular life is like. I feel that Tokyo gets a lot of viewership, but all of Japan isn't Tokyo. A lot of us live in the countryside and live regular lives, and I wanted to share that with the world. A lot of people are thinking about leaving the States and I wanted to share my perspective on it too,\" Smith says.</p></div><div><p>Since she started sharing her life in Japan on TikTok, Smith says the reception has been positive.</p><p>\"A lot of people who live in Japan do see themselves in me. They feel like I am sharing the authentic Japanese experience and that means a lot to me that I can create that visibility where it might not otherwise exist,\" she says.</p><p>\"And for other people who look like me, [they can] also feel empowered that they can do it too. I feel that knowing more about the place that you're going and seeing other people doing it can take some of the fear out of doing that move.\"</p><p><em>Conversions from Japanese yen to USD were done using the OANDA conversion rate of 147 Japanese yen to $1 USD on August 30, 2025.

But after Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick warned CEO Dave Burritt the administration wouldn't allow it, U.S. Steel reversed course on Friday, saying the facility would keep rolling slabs into sheet steel, the Journal reported, citing a person familiar with the matter.</p><p>The intervention marked Trump's first use of so-called \"golden share\" rights, a condition of <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2025/06/13/trump-us-steel-nippon-deal.html\">the $14.1 billion takeover by Japan's Nippon that cleared in June.</a> The national-security agreement gave the White House veto power over plant closures, offshore production shifts and other strategic decisions.</p><p>\"U.

Steel will continue to supply slabs to Granite City,\" a spokesperson for U.S. Steel told CNBC. \"Our goal was to maintain flexibility, and we are pleased to have found a solution to continue to slab consumption at Granite City.\"</p><p>The move highlights Trump's growing hand in the private sector. Last month, the president said the government would <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2025/08/22/intel-goverment-equity-stake.html\">take a 10% stake in Intel,</a> after the chipmaker received billions in subsidies under the 2022 Chips Act.</p><p>In June, when the deal was announced, Trump told U.S. Steel workers that Nippon would be a \"great partner.\" The Trump administration is currently engaged in trade talks with Japan as investors eagerly await signs that the U.S. will strike deals with key partners that avoid steep tariffs.</p><p>Trump told the steelworkers that Nippon had agreed to keep U.S. Steel's blast furnaces operating at full capacity for a minimum of 10 years. The president said the deal would not result in layoffs and promised there would be \"no outsourcing whatsoever.\" At the time, he said workers would receive a $5,000 bonus.</p><p><a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/business/trump-invokes-golden-share-to-block-u-s-steel-plans-for-illinois-plant-f6b661ed?mod=hp_lead_pos11\" target=\"_blank\">Read the complete WSJ story here</a>.</p></div></div>"
