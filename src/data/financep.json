    "body": "<div><div><p>A view of the U.S. Capitol on September 29, 2025 in Washington, DC. </p><p>Anna Moneymaker | Getty Images</p></div><div><p>For all the political firestorms they generate, government shutdowns historically have been nonevents for both markets and the economy.</p><p>This time, though, could be different.</p><p>That's because <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2025/09/28/trump-mass-firings-government-shutdown.html\">President Donald Trump's threat</a> to make some federal government furloughs resulting from the shutdown permanent could have longer-lasting impacts on an employment picture that already has been looking precarious.</p><p>Should Trump follow through on the threat — and successfully weather what almost certainly would be yet another court challenge to his executive authority — it throws a wrench into what otherwise have been much more political than economic events.</p><p>\"We have reason to think that a shutdown this time may not follow past precedent,\" Michael McLean, public policy senior analyst at Barclays, said in a client note. If Trump follows through, \"this would be a significant departure from past practice and could inject new uncertainty into the economic effect of a shutdown, which otherwise we would expect to be marginal.\"</p><p>Indeed, shutdowns in the past have left little mark other than the political damage done to the party perceived as at fault.</p><p>Markets have sold off on occasion but then quickly recovered. For growth, most economists calculate the impact as about 0.1 percentage point off gross domestic product for week. Being that the longest closure lasted 35 days, from-late 2018 until the following January, that's not a lot for a $30 trillion economy. The short-term losses are usually easily recouped in subsequent quarters, according to Bank of America.</p></div><h2><a></a>Labor market trouble</h2><div><p>However, in this case the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2025/09/23/powell-says-slowing-labor-market-prompted-rate-cut-sees-challenging-situation-ahead.html\">labor market already has been wobbly</a>. In particular, the Washington, D.C. region, where a large share of federal government employees call home, has taken a hit from the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2025/07/02/doge-government-layoffs-could-start-becoming-a-factor-in-jobs-report.html\">layoffs earlier this year</a> advocated by Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency advisory board.</p><p>Shutdowns automatically mean that employees not deemed essential are furloughed, but are always summoned back once the impasse ends. Trump threatened, in an NBC News interview Sunday, that \"we are going to cut a lot of the people that ... we're able to cut on a permanent basis.\"</p><p>The impact on the monthly nonfarm payrolls report wouldn't show up until the October count is released in November, where Trump's threat \"could have a more severe near-term impact\" than usual, wrote Nomura economist David Seif.</p><p>But that brings up another wrinkle: Should the shutdown last any significant amount of time, it could delay the release of key economic data.</p></div><h2><a></a>Impact on the BLS</h2><div><p>The Labor Department said Friday it will shut down virtually all activity. The department's Bureau of Labor Statistics, which releases multiple key economic reports including the monthly jobs count, would be shuttered as long as the shutdown lasts. In an action plan to address the situation, the department warned of delays and also said a \"reduction in quality\" for the data could occur.</p><p>For Social Security recipients, a delay in the release of the consumer price index inflation reading could impact cost-of-living adjustments.</p><p>The situation also could impact the Federal Reserve, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2023/09/20/fed-interest-rate-moves-affected-by-government-shutdown.html\">which relies on BLS data</a> when making its decisions on interest rates and other matters relating to monetary policy.</p><p>\"While the US government may be headed for a shutdown, we expect little economic impact,\" Mark Cabana, head of rates strategy at Bank of America, said in a note. \"A shutdown would pause economic data releases, leaving the Fed reliant on private data for its policy decisions if the shutdown extends.\"</p><p>One corollary would be the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2023/09/20/fed-interest-rate-moves-affected-by-government-shutdown.html\">2013 shutdown</a>, when the September jobs report was delayed until Oct. 22. That month's CPI also was postponed by two weeks.</p><p>Elizabeth Renter, senior economist at NerdWallet, concurred with most Wall Street analyses in that the ultimate impact should be \"relatively mild.\" However, she noted the potential hit to the labor market.</p><p>\"The most immediate and impactful effect is on furloughed federal employees and contractors,\" she said. \"When households are forced to go without income, even for a week, it can set back their financial stability significantly.\"</p></div></div>"

And now fast-food chains are hopping on the bandwagon.</p><p>\"It validates that this is a category, and McDonald's and Taco Bell wouldn't be getting into it if it wasn't something that had broad appeal that they could sell everywhere, in thousands of locations,\" Dunn said. \"It's kind of flattering that we created a category that now everybody is copying.\"</p><p>For restaurants, adding dirty soda to the menu is easier than it might sound.</p><p>\"It's a custom drink offering that, one, allows the brands to leverage something that they already have right there: their soda machine,\" said Erica Holland-Toll, culinary director at The Culinary Edge, which advises restaurants on food and beverage innovation. \"Two, it incorporates either a one-touch ingredient, or if they're already open for breakfast, it's quite likely that they've got a creamer in house.\"</p><p>On the other hand, offering customizable coffee drinks is usually much more difficult — which has contributed to the struggles at Starbucks.</p><p>\"The espresso world — that's so much more complicated,\" Holland-Toll said.</p><p>Dirty soda also has wide appeal. With less caffeine than coffee, consumers can drink it all day long. Plus, it's \"much more accessible\" than some coffee house trends, like an espresso tonic, according to Holland-Toll. The bright colors of many dirty sodas also make them more attractive to consumers, who were likely introduced to the trend via a TikTok video.</p><p>But perhaps above all, dirty soda can help restaurants draw in customers who are otherwise feeling thrifty.</p><p>\"It's an affordable fun treat. You're not going out and spending $30 or $50, right?\" said Sally Lyons Watt, chief advisor of consumer goods and foodservice insights for Circana. \"It's something that people can walk away saying, 'Wow, that was yummy' or 'I feel better because I just had that.'\"</p></div><h2><a></a>A pop for beverage companies</h2><div><p>Swig drinks.</p><p>Courtesy: Swig</p></div><div><p>A \"fun treat\" for consumers is adding up for beverage companies, helping reverse the decades-long trend of declining soda consumption in the U.S.</p><p>As health concerns mount and the array of beverage options expands, Americans have been drinking less soda for roughly two decades. In 2004, soda consumption peaked at 15.3 billion gallons, according to Beverage Marketing; by 2024, that figure had slid to 11.87 billion gallons. But consumption of carbonated soft drinks has been ticking up in the last two years, with 2025 estimated to reach 11.88 billion gallons. The rise of dirty soda, plus the growing popularity of prebiotic sodas, has likely helped the segment halt its downward trajectory.</p></div><div><p>Over the years, iced coffee has been stealing what the beverage industry calls \"share of throat\" from soda. With dirty soda, consumers can marry their love of customizing a cold drink with the lower caffeine content and taste of soda.</p><p>\"The carbonation makes it feel lighter in your mouth than coffee, for example,\" Holland-Toll said.</p><p>Dirty soda has also been attracting younger consumers who previously didn't drink much Pepsi or Dr Pepper. Swig's core customer base is young women between the ages of 18 and 35, according to Dunn.</p><p>That's true for Holly Galvin, a 31-year-old human resources professional based in Davenport, Iowa. She told CNBC that she rarely drank soda — until she saw dirty soda take the spotlight in the \"The Secret Lives of Mormon Wives\" last year. Now she makes her own dirty soda once or twice a week at home. With the onset of autumn, her go-to recipe these days uses Diet Dr Pepper as a base, with pumpkin spice creamer and a sprinkle of pumpkin pie spice on top.</p><p>Broadly, younger consumers are more inclined to seek out new drinks compared with older cohorts. Nearly three-quarters of Generation Z try a new beverage every month on average, according to Keurig Dr Pepper's 2025 trend report.</p><p>Beverage companies say that they are seeing a broader halo effect for soda as a result of the trend.</p><p>\"For us, it serves as a recruitment tool, bringing new users into the trademark,\" said Katie Webb, vice president of innovation and transformation for <span><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/KDP/\">Keurig Dr Pepper</a><span><span></span></span></span>. \"It really draws them all the way back to the base brand, which ends up being extremely impact for us long after.\"</p><p>And just as craft cocktail culture led to the rise of canned cocktails, the popularity of dirty soda is leading beverage giants to cash in with ready-to-drink versions that capitalize on the trend. Dr Pepper Creamy Coconut was the company's most successful limited-time carbonated soft drink to date, based on retail dollar sales, according to Webb. And Kirkham said Pepsi Wild Cherry & Cream has been one of the fastest-growing flavor segments for the company.</p><p>\"Some trends start retail and move over to foodservice,\" Circana's Lyons Wyatt said. \"This one was a foodservice trend moving into retail.\"</p><p>With Pepsi Wild Cherry & Cream and next year's launch of Dirty Dew and the Mug Floats Vanilla Howler, Kirkham expects that consumers will become even more creative with their concoctions.</p><p>\"I think it's actually giving [consumers] the chance to experiment even more and customize more,\" he said. \"Now you have a brand new base.\"</p></div></div>"

Seniors will see they have an average of 10 plans to choose from in most markets when they get their first look at 2026 plans on Wednesday.</p><p>After chasing growth in the Medicare market for more than a decade, health insurers have faced shrinking profits in their Medicare Advantage programs over the last two years, as members tally higher-than-expected medical costs and new regulations pressure government reimbursement rates. The larger insurers are now cutting back on unprofitable plans and exiting some markets altogether.</p><p>\"We're seeing most health insurance carriers — most Medicare Advantage carriers — be much more focused on profitability relative to growth this year,\" said Cobi Blumenfeld-Gantz, founder and CEO of Chapter, a brokerage which helps Medicare members enroll in coverage. \"Some of the plan benefits will not be as robust as they have been in the past.\"</p></div><h2><a></a>Higher costs in 2026 plans</h2><div><p>CMS projects that the average monthly premium across Medicare Advantage plans will decrease from $16.40 this year to $14 in 2026.

Though companies are raising deductibles on those plans, seniors will still see offerings with $0 premiums, according to analysts.</p><p>\"That is one area that carriers are very reticent to touch. So, they're more likely to cut benefits long before they would add a premium to a $0 product. But the products that already have premiums today … are likely to see increases,\" said Brooks Conway, a principal at consulting firm Oliver Wyman.</p></div><h2><a></a>Insurers decommission plans</h2><div><p>Seniors tend to work with insurance brokers and agents to help sort through their options during open enrollment. So, one of the ways insurers try to boost enrollment in more profitable plans is by prioritizing commission rates. They'll pay higher rates on some plans and none at all for others.</p><p>This year, the carriers are increasingly eliminating broker commissions on<strong> </strong>a wide swath of less profitable plans.</p><p>\"It's not something that's out of the norm for that to happen, but the amount of the plans cutting and being decommissioned, that's what's not normal,\" said Michael Antoine, an independent health insurance agent with Partner Insurance Solutions.</p></div><div><h2>More CNBC health coverage</h2><div><ul><li><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2025/09/24/how-to-get-covid-mmrv-hepatitisb-vaccines.html\">The Trump administration is changing Covid, childhood vaccine recommendations – here's what it means for you</a></li><li><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2025/09/26/us-to-impose-100percent-tariff-on-branded-patented-drugs-unless-firms-build-plants-locally-trump-says.html\">U.S. to impose 100% tariff on branded, patented drugs unless firms build plants locally, Trump says</a></li><li><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2025/09/23/eli-lilly-plans-6point5-billion-texas-manufacturing-plant-for-obesity-pill.html\">Eli Lilly to build $6.5 billion Texas manufacturing facility for obesity pill, other drugs</a></li></ul></div></div><div><p>For 2026 open enrollment, 15% to 20% of plans have been decommissioned across most of the country, according to data compiled for CNBC by Chapter. In some markets like New York, insurers have cut commissions on more than 25% of plans, while in parts of Georgia it's over 35% of plans.   </p><p>\"This year in particular, it's so important that people ask their Medicare advisor if there are plans that are available that the Medicare advisor may not be looking at because of these noncommission challenges,\" said Chapter's Blumenfeld-Gantz.</p><p>Even when they're willing to forgo commissions, brokers may not be able to get access to some of those plans on their brokerage systems.</p><p>\"I had an experience, and I'm not going to say the carrier, where I couldn't even enroll the person into the plan,\" Antoine said. \"It was being completely suppressed. They didn't want membership into that plan.\"</p><p>Insurers are betting that with more restrictive offerings and enrollment, they can get a better handle on membership and costs for 2026. But with so much disruption in the market, uncertainty remains high.</p><p>\"Enrollment is particularly difficult for plans to project in years like this one, where so many carriers are reducing benefits and adjusting their portfolios,\" said Conway. \"A plan might expect to reduce [Medicare Advantage] enrollment because they leaned out (of) benefits, only to find out that a major carrier exited their market, and the remaining carriers also leaned out their benefits.\"</p></div><h2><a></a>Open enrollment kicks off</h2><div><p>Medicare enrollees should get notices from their insurers about changes to their current health plans this week, when the shopping period for 2026 open enrollment begins on Wednesday. With so many changes in the market, brokers say seniors need to shop around this year and weigh their options.</p><p>\"This is not the year to go on autopilot,\" said Whitney Stidom, vice president at online brokerage <span><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/EHTH/\">eHealth</a><span><span></span></span></span>. \"Doing comparison shopping can save over $1,800 in out-of-pocket costs just by simply comparing plans and potentially finding something that will save them more.\"</p><p>A looming government shutdown, which could start Oct. 1, could add a bit more uncertainty to this year's enrollment, with Congress at an impasse on a funding agreement.</p><p>A former CMS official told CNBC a short shutdown should not impact open enrollment, because funding for contractors who oversee the process has already been allocated and will continue.</p><p>On Saturday, CMS announced that critical services for Medicare and Medicaid would not be affected by a shutdown, though the agency would not have funding to provide oversight to contractors, including those who administer the Medicare call centers.</p><p>The Medicare open enrollment period runs from Oct. 15 through Dec. 7.</p></div></div>"
