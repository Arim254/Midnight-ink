    "description": "Qian Zhang, 35, quit her job as vice president at a Boston-based global firm to relocate to Lisbon, after ten years on an H-1B visa that, she said, left her feeling like a “second-class citizen\" in America.",
    "body": "<div><div><p>Qian Zhang has lived in Lisbon since 2023.</p></div><div><p>When Qian Zhang boarded a flight from Shanghai to Boston at age 18, she thought she was heading toward the \"best version\" of her life. It was 2009, during President Barack Obama's first term, when the U.S. economy was rebounding and opportunities for well-educated workers seemed plentiful.</p><p>She was bound for Dartmouth College, a top choice for many Chinese students, and later found her way to Harvard Business School.</p><p>Qian embraced the American dream: the promise of equal opportunity, a country that rewards talent and hard work, and a place where global citizens like her could belong.</p><p>By her early 30s, she was a vice president at a global firm in Boston, earning six figures a year. But behind the glittering resume was a reality defined by her immigration status.</p><p>Like hundreds of thousands of foreign professionals, Qian lived on an H-1B work visa — the document that tethered her job, her ability to travel, and her entire sense of security to the grace of her employer. \"Your entire life is tied to your job,\" she said. \"If you lose the job, you lose the visa. If you lose the visa, you lose the country.\"</p><p>At first, she pushed aside her anxieties. She bought property, built friendships, and told herself she was no different from her American colleagues.</p><p>But each year brought fresh reminders: vacations cut short to fly back to China for visa paperwork, discreet job searches because changing employers required fresh visa sponsorships, and the constant fear that one misstep could unravel her life. \"The H-1B made me feel like a second-class citizen,\" she said.</p></div><blockquote><div><p>Your entire life is tied to your job. If you lose the job, you lose the [H-1B] visa. If you lose the visa, you lose the country.</p><div><p>Qian Zhang</p><p>Former H-1B visa holder</p></div></div></blockquote><div><p>In 2022, four months after her promotion to vice president, Qian quit. A year later, she packed her life into suitcases again. This time, she was leaving for good.</p><p>Now, the 35-year-old resides in Portugal's capital, Lisbon, with her partner, Swiss artist-filmmaker Tobias Madison, and their newborn child. The Portuguese sun and slower pace, she says, have begun to heal the trauma of a decade in America, where every promotion, vacation and romantic entanglement felt shadowed by the same fear: what happens if her visa disappears?</p><h3>Chasing the dream — and the visa</h3><p>The H-1B visa fundamentally shaped her career path, Qian said. \"Only a handful of sectors even sponsor it — finance, tech, consulting, law and medicine. You don't have many options,\" she said.</p><p>She had done several stints in Boston, from strategy consulting to business development at a tech firm, before rising to become a vice president at a consumer products company.</p><p>\"When the economy is strong, you may have a chance to compete on an equal footing with other job seekers. But when the economy is bad, you're the last pick, if you're picked at all.\"</p><p>Her anxiety deepened during President Donald Trump's first term, when visa processing delays and audits rose. Even Qian, who seemed to embody the type of high-skilled worker the U.S. claimed to prize, felt vulnerable. \"I had a conflict at work once and thought, if I get fired, I might have to leave immediately,\" she recalled. \"I was so anxious I actually crashed my car.\"</p><p>The country was no longer the one she entered in 2009, she said. Reading the comments under news articles about immigration was sobering. \"The America I went to believed in openness, in welcoming talent,\" she said. \"The America I left was divided, suspicious, anxious.\"</p><p>Her disillusionment echoed a broader trend of slowing international student enrollment in the U.S. in recent years.</p><p>\"America used to be the dream,\" she said. \"Now people like me look elsewhere.\"</p><h3>A new chapter</h3><p>Lisbon, with its tiled streets and Atlantic sunsets, is a world away from Boston and New York. Qian and her partner are renovating a farmhouse in the Portuguese countryside. She is writing a book and exploring creative projects. Life is slower, cheaper, freer, she said.</p><p>Portugal has been a hotspot for digital nomads, luring foreign remote workers with friendly visa policies, a better quality of life, and a lower cost of living.</p><p>Her visa process in Portugal, she said, was \"the easiest of my life.\" When she pressed her lawyer for what could go wrong, the lawyer reassured her: \"Don't worry, we are not the U.S.\"</p></div><div><p>Qian Zhang has lived in Lisbon since 2023.</p></div><div><p>Her years in America gave her financial security — she graduated when the economy was strong, saved responsibly and invested prudently. That cushion allowed her to start over. \"I was lucky,\" she said. \"I caught the right wave.\"</p><p>Still, she is ambivalent about the country that shaped her adulthood. \"I used to see everything through the lens of the U.S.,\" she said. \"Now I see it's not the center of the world.\"</p><p>She hopes the U.S. can rediscover the openness that once drew her in. \"I want America to become the America we believed in,\" she said. \"Open. Confident. Free. Not this fearful, closed-off version of itself.\"</p><p>Until then, she said, more people like her will keep leaving. \"Maybe,\" she added with a small smile, \"America needs us more than we need America.\"</p><p><em><strong>Are you ready to buy a house?</strong> Take Smarter by CNBC Make It's new online course </em><a href=\"https://smarter.cnbcmakeit.com/p/how-to-buy-your-first-home?utm_source=cnbc&utm_medium=makeitarticle&utm_campaign=bottom\" target=\"_blank\"><em>How to Buy Your First Home</em></a><em>.

Seven of the 10 best value colleges in the U.S. are part of the City University of New York network, according to <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/rankings/college-rankings/best-value-2026\" target=\"_blank\">The Wall Street Journal's 2026 rankings</a> released on Sept. 29.</p><p>WSJ considered schools' average net price — the cost students pay after financial aid and scholarships — as well as the value each school adds to graduates' salaries. The latter figure is calculated as the difference between median graduate earnings and the median earnings of workers who only attended high school in the state. </p><p>Baruch College in Manhattan takes the top spot for the third year in a row. The school has earned a reputation for its affordability and high-quality education that helps students from middle- and low-income families fare better in adulthood. </p><p>Nearly half (47%) of Baruch students came from families the bottom fifth percentile of earners nationwide and moved into the top fifth of earners as adults, according to a 2017 <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/projects/college-mobility/bernard-m-baruch-college\" target=\"_blank\">New York Times analysis</a>. The Journal also ranked Baruch No. 7 in its <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/rankings/college-rankings/social-mobility-2026?mod=best-value-2026\" target=\"_blank\">social mobility rankings</a>, which considered factors like the school's salary impact and graduation rates.</p><p>Here are the 10 best value colleges for 2026, according to The Wall Street Journal.</p><h3>1.

While schools like Stanford and Princeton also offer a great value to students, they come at a steeper cost with average net prices above $10,000, per WSJ.</p><p>Historically, families have felt it's <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2025/04/18/median-return-on-investment-for-a-college-degree.html\">worth it</a> to send their student to a top-ranked school, despite the cost. But these days, they'll \"trade in prestige for a college that's going to cost half as much,\" Selingo says.</p><p>\"They have the money, but they're unwilling to pay for a certain level of prestige,\" he adds. \"They want to save that money for other things, including their children after they get out of college.\"</p><p>While Baruch and the other best value CUNY schools don't rank nearly as high in The Wall Street Journal's <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/rankings/college-rankings/best-colleges-2026?mod=article_relatedinline\" target=\"_blank\">overall rankings</a>, \"location matters,\" Selingo says. And the fact that these colleges are in New York City — which is a hotspot for <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2025/01/16/these-us-cities-have-the-most-jobs-paying-over-500000.html\">high-paying jobs</a> in a variety of industries — can also give students a long-term career advantage. </p><p>However, living in New York for college may be expensive. CUNY schools have limited student housing, and it typically is not guaranteed for students.</p><p>That could mean living in an off-campus apartment in Manhattan, where the average rent is around $5,600 a month, according to <a href=\"https://www.rentcafe.com/average-rent-market-trends/us/ny/manhattan/\" target=\"_blank\">RentCafe</a>, although that figure can vary depending on the neighborhood, apartment size and number of roommates.</p><p><em><strong>Last chance to save: Want to be your own boss?</strong> Final days to get 30% off Smarter by CNBC Make It's new online course, </em><a href=\"https://smarter.cnbcmakeit.com/p/how-to-start-a-business-for-first-time-founders?utm_source=cnbc&utm_medium=makeitarticle&utm_campaign=bottom\" target=\"_blank\"><em>How To Start A Business: For First-Time Founders</em></a><em>.

While exports to the U.S. account for around 2% of India's GDP, these sectors are labor-intensive, and deterioration of business could lead to job losses.</p><p>To mitigate the impact of the tariffs, the Indian government reduced the goods and services tax on several items on Sept. 22, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2025/09/04/india-modifies-tax-rates-in-bid-to-spur-consumption-blunt-tariff-impact-gst-modi.html\">to spur domestic demand</a> ahead of a month-long festive season, which starts with the nine-day Hindu festival of Navratri, followed by Diwali.</p><p>The GST tax cut is expected to make fast-moving consumer goods, automobiles and farm products cheaper.</p><p>However, the tax cuts would only provide a temporary boost to the Indian economy, and job creation needs to improve for a sustained consumption pickup, Nomura's Varma said.</p><p>India's domestic consumption accounts for over 60% of GDP, close to other developed economies like the U.S. and the U.K., making it less dependent on exports.

    "body": "<div><p><span><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/NKE/\">Nike</a><span><span></span></span></span> on Tuesday posted surprise sales growth in its fiscal first quarter but said it still has work ahead to execute its turnaround as it warned it expects sales to fall again during most of the holiday shopping season.</p><p>Nike expects sales during its current quarter, which runs generally from early September to early December, to fall by a low single digit percentage, in line with expectations of a 3% decline, according to LSEG. Without favorable foreign exchange rates, sales could come in even lower, as the company said its guidance includes a 1 percentage point of positive impact from exchange rates.</p><p>Nike has made progress in its turnaround plan, but the expected decline during most of the holiday shopping months would follow an 8% drop in revenue in the year-ago period. It's a sign to investors that Nike's recovery is moving slowly, even during the busiest time of the year for retailers.</p><p>Higher tariff costs are hampering Nike's efforts to turn around its business. The company now expects tariffs to cost it $1.5 billion and hit its gross margin by 1.2 percentage points in its current fiscal year 2026. That's up from the $1 billion and 0.75 percentage point gross margin impact it projected in June. </p><p>During its current quarter, Nike said it expects its gross margin to fall between 3 and 3.75 percentage points.</p><p>In a press release, finance chief Matt Friend warned that \"progress will not be linear.\"</p><p>\"I'm encouraged by the momentum we generated in the quarter, but progress will not be linear as dimensions of our business recover on different timelines,\" said Friend. \"While we navigate several external headwinds, our teams are focused on executing against what we can control.\"</p><p>Here's how Nike performed during the quarter compared with what Wall Street was anticipating, according to consensus estimates from LSEG:</p><ul><li><strong>Earnings per share:</strong> 49 cents vs. 27 cents expected</li><li><strong>Revenue:</strong> $11.72 billion vs. $11.0 billion expected</li></ul><p>Nike's reported net income in the three months ended Aug. 31 was $727 million, or 49 cents per share, compared with earnings of $1.05 billion, or 70 cents per share, in the year-ago quarter.</p><p>Sales rose to $11.72 billion, up about 1% from $11.59 billion a year earlier.</p><p>Revenue rose 1% during the quarter after Nike previously said it anticipated sales would fall by a mid-single digit percentage in the period. Still, Nike's profits fell 31% while gross margin dropped 3.2 percentage points to 42.2% during the quarter — another warning sign to investors that its efforts to clear through old inventory are still ongoing.</p><p>In a statement, CEO Elliott Hill said the company is making strides in three key areas: wholesale, running and North America. During the quarter, wholesale revenue rose 7% to about $6.8 billion, while sales in North America climbed 4% to $5.02 billion — better than the $4.55 billion analysts were expecting, according to StreetAccount.</p><p>However, beyond those three areas, Hill acknowledged parts of the business are still struggling, primarily its China segment, Converse brand and its direct business, which includes stores and online <strong>sales</strong>.</p><p>During the quarter, Nike direct sales fell 4% to about $4.5 billion, while Converse sales dropped 27%. Revenue in China -- one of the company's most important markets — was down 9%.</p><p>\"Greater China, as I mentioned on the last call, is facing structural challenges in the marketplace,\" Hill told analysts on a conference call. \"Seasonal sell through continues to underperform. Our plans require larger investments to keep the marketplace clean.\"</p><p>The company said it expects revenue and gross margin headwinds to continue throughout fiscal 2026 in both China and at Converse. Nike does not expect its direct business to return to growth in fiscal 2026.</p><p>Since Hill took over nearly a year ago, he's been working to get Nike back to growth and undo some of the work his predecessor John Donahoe implemented. One of the most important parts of that strategy has been reigniting <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2024/04/12/nike-ceo-blames-remote-work-for-innovation-slowdown.html\">Nike's innovation engine</a> and clearing through stale inventory to make way for new styles.</p><p>Though the strategy is crucial to Nike's efforts to grow again and take back <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2025/05/24/on-running-shoes-nike-adidas.html\">market share</a>, it comes with pain in the short term. Clearing out old inventory has required Nike to rely on discounting and less profitable sales channels to move products, which has impacted its profitability.</p><p>During the quarter, inventories were down 2% compared to the prior year as units decreased, which was offset by increased product costs related to <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2025/05/21/nike-price-increases-tariffs.html\">higher tariffs.</a> Hill and Friend made it clear during the call with analysts that its inventory efforts are ongoing. While progress is going to depend on the respective geographies and channels, Nike said its expects its gross margin to benefit from less clearance in the second half of the year.</p><p>Beyond inventory management, Hill has also pledged to realign Nike's corporate structure so it would once again segment teams by sport instead of by women's, men's and kids. In late August, the company started shuffling teams. As part of the restructuring, Nike said it would <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2025/08/28/nike-to-lay-off-about-1percent-of-corporate-staff.html\">cut around 1% of its staff</a>, and most employees would be moved into new roles by Sept. 21. </p><p>The realignment impacted around 8,000 employees but is expected to drive growth as the teams get to work, said Hill. It is unclear how many of those employees were moved to new positions and how many were laid off. </p><p>\"This new formation and ways of working will align our three brands, Nike Jordan and Converse into more nimble focused teams by sport. We'll gain sharper insights to fuel innovation and storytelling and connect with the communities of each sport in more meaningful ways,\" said Hill. </p><p>\"Collectively, we'll have a better coordinated attack with each brand forming a distinct identity and delivering a clear attention to serve different consumers,\" he added. \"In the marketplace, organizing by sport, gives us a much clearer point of view.\"</p><p>Hill cited Nike's \"House of Innovation\" in New York, a redesigned retail experience that segments the store by sports, as an example of how the strategy works. He said the refresh has led to double-digit increases in revenue and a similar, smaller-format approach in Texas showed similar results.</p><p>Hill has said a focus on sports over lifestyle will help the company win back its crucial athlete consumer, but lifestyle merchandise is still an important part of the strategy because it allows Nike to reach a larger consumer segment, and more women. Growing the number of female customers has been another important part of Hill's strategy and Nike's recent partnership with Kim Kardashian's shapewear brand Skims is one of the ways it's getting there.</p><p>NikeSKIMS, originally slated to release in the spring, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2025/09/22/nikeskims-activewear-line-to-launch-this-week.html\">officially launched last week</a>. Hill told analysts the \"early consumer response\" has been \"very strong.\"</p></div>"
