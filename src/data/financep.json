They launched the business in 2017, and it was most recently valued at $1.7 billion in November 2021, <a href=\"https://www.zenbusiness.com/series-c-200m-funding/\" target=\"_blank\">according to the company</a>.</p><p>The pair previously worked together as executives at vacation rental marketplace HomeAway, which Expedia acquired for <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/video/2015/11/05/expedia-buying-homeaway-for-3-9b-.html\">$3.9 billion</a> in 2015.</p><p>When they teamed up to start ZenBusiness, they spent roughly 10 months researching their industry and talking to dozens of entrepreneurs about their businesses' biggest pain points around legal compliance, says Hemmati, 62.</p><p>\"When you have an idea, you already have identified a pain point you want to solve for,\" she says.

They had already witnessed the issue firsthand working at a startup and also found public data that showed it to be a widespread obstacle for entrepreneurs across the country, Hemmati adds.</p><p>They initially planned on marketing the service only to existing businesses, but talking to prospective clients<strong> </strong>made them realize that they should instead target first-time business owners who've never navigated a \"pretty complex\" legal process before, she says.</p><p>\"We spoke with roughly 50 to 100 prospective customers to understand what they needed most — everything from formation help to ongoing compliance and growth services,\" she says. \"We ran design sprints, tested different packages and pricing, even built websites and refunded early sign-ups just to see what caught people's attention and what they were willing to pay for.\"</p><p><em><strong>DON'T MISS</strong></em><strong>:</strong><a href=\"https://smarter.cnbcmakeit.com/p/how-to-start-a-business-for-first-time-founders?utm_source=cnbc&utm_medium=makeitarticle&utm_campaign=body\" target=\"_blank\"><strong> </strong><em><strong>The ultimate guide to starting a business—everything you need to know to be your own boss</strong></em></a></p><p>That strategy proved invaluable, giving Hemmati and Buhrdorf \"incredible insight and the confidence to launch,\" she adds.</p><p>Working with those business owners from the start also meant those clients would be more likely to keep using ZenBusiness' software as their companies grew, Hemmati says. ZenBusiness has now worked with at least 850,000 small businesses, according to the company.</p><p>The takeaway for other prospective entrepreneurs, she says: Any business idea needs to be properly vetted, and the first step is always <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2025/07/18/hbs-lecturer-biggest-mistakes-people-make-when-starting-a-business.html\">researching your market</a> and talking to the customers and clients you want the business to reach.</p><p>\"[Start] by having that communication and collaboration, constantly interviewing your potential customers and learning about what is the next product that they're interested in, and how you should even go about building it,\" Hemmati says.</p></div><h2><a></a>'If you can't pivot...chances are you will fail'</h2><div><p>Steve Blank, an author and serial entrepreneur who teaches a course on the subject at Stanford University, similarly says that a failure to properly research your potential customers before building a business model is a \"fatal mistake\" that will likely doom any new business before it even launches.</p><p>\"The most important [question] is: 'Well, who are my customers?'

The change is pending approval by the Securities and Exchange Commission.</p><p>The $25,000 minimum equity rule mandates that traders must maintain a minimum account balance of $25,000 in a margin account to execute four or more day trades within a five-business-day period. The rule was put in place in 2001 amid the dot-com bubble and crash as regulators grew worried that small traders were taking excessive risks with volatile internet stocks.</p><p>FINRA is replacing this mandate with an intraday margin rule that applies the existing maintenance margin rules to intraday exposure. In other words, one's intraday buying power will be based on the margin requirements for the positions they take on during the day, not a fixed equity minimum.</p><p>The regulators said the overhaul reflects how technology and market access have transformed retail trading since the rules were first adopted.</p><p>The rule change could lead to more options trading and boost activity for brokers like <span><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/HOOD/\">Robinhood</a><span><span></span></span></span>.</p><p>Robinhood shares rebounded from an earlier loss and were higher by 1% in Wednesday trading following the FINRA news.</p></div></div>"

Chery is among a wave of Chinese companies tapping Hong Kong's thriving IPO market. </p><p>While the launch proceeded as scheduled, the company canceled its planned listing ceremony at the Hong Kong Stock Exchange due to the city's shutdown following Super Typhoon Ragasa the day before.</p><p>The automaker has been accelerating its expansion in Vietnam, Middle East and Europe. Its SUV-focused sub-brand Jetour will enter Europe this November by launching three combustion-engine sport-utility vehicles in Poland.</p><p>The automaker in July announced that it was <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/business/retail-consumer/chinas-chery-brand-launch-britain-with-two-new-suvs-2025-07-08/\" target=\"_blank\">selling vehicles under its flagship Chery brand in the UK</a>. Chery also rolled out its Jaecoo marque earlier in January and Omoda brand in Britain last year.</p><p>Chery has been \"a little bit under the radar\" as \"everyone has been talking about BYD\" in the past few years, Sino Auto Insights' Founder and Managing Director Tu Le told CNBC's \"<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/the-china-connection/\">The China Connection</a>\" Thursday.</p><p>\"They [Chery] manufacture in multiple countries already, so they're likely the envy of a lot of Chinese EV makers,\" he added, noting the brand's popularity in the U.K. and Australia as well. \"We're seeing a lot of emergence and strength from the Chery brand.\"</p><p>However, global headwinds remain. In the U.S., Chinese-made electric vehicles <a href=\"https://www.asil.org/insights/volume/28/issue/12\" target=\"_blank\">face a 100% tariff</a> under Section 301 of the Trade Act of 1974. Canada in October 2024 also matched the U.S. by <a href=\"https://gazette.gc.ca/rp-pr/p2/2024/2024-10-09/html/sor-dors187-eng.html\" target=\"_blank\">imposing a 100% tariff</a> on Chinese EV imports. The European Union <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2024/10/04/european-union-votes-to-impose-tariffs-on-chinese-electric-vehicles.html\">also implemented tariffs</a> on Chinese-made electric vehicles, with some facing levies of up to 45.3%, effective in late 2024. </p><p>Le noted that while Chery does have \"some exposure,\" to tariffs, the vehicle maker is also building locally in the <a href=\"https://regional.chinadaily.com.cn/en/2025-07/11/c_1108382.htm\" target=\"_blank\">Middle East</a> and <a href=\"https://www.chery.my/2024/06/18/chery-increases-presence-in-negeri-sembilan-with-new-dealership-2/\" target=\"_blank\">Southeast Asia</a>. That mitigates some of the risk and puts them in a \"much better position\" than a lot of other players who are looking only to export, said the managing director.</p><p><a href=\"https://www.cheryinternational.com/pc/news/news1/20250903/detail-2457.shtml\" target=\"_blank\">Chery sold 242,736 vehicles in August</a>, of which 129,472 were exported, marking a year-on-year increase of 14.6% and 32.3%, respectively.</p></div></div>"

Ted Cruz, R-Texas, stood by his prior testimony to the Senate Judiciary Committee that he did not, as FBI director, authorize a leak of information to The Wall Street Journal for an October 2016 article.</p><p>That article detailed a Justice Department probe of then-Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton's email use.</p><p>Dilanian, who reported Wednesday's story with his MSNBC colleague Carol Leonnig, noted that the five-year statute of limitations on a charge of lying to Congress against Comey would lapse next Tuesday.</p><p>Cruz, in a December 2020 letter to the Justice Department, wrote that former FBI Deputy Director Andrew McCabe had admitted knowing about and authorizing the leak.</p><p>Cruz wrote that while McCabe has insisted that Comey was aware of his decision to authorize the disclosure, Comey \"has denied this claim.\"</p><p>\"Mr. Comey and Mr. McCabe's statements are irreconcilably contradictory,\" Cruz wrote. \"Mr. McCabe says that he told Mr. Comey of the leak and that Mr. Comey approved — effectively authorizing the leak after the fact. Mr. Comey, on the other hand, has said that he neither authorized the leak nor knew of Mr. McCabe's involvement.\"</p><p>\"One of them is lying under oath — a federal crime,\" Cruz wrote.</p><p>CNBC has requested comment from Comey through his book publisher on MSNBC's report.</p><p>The White House, the Justice Department, and the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Eastern District of Virginia did not immediately respond to CNBC's requests for comment.</p><p>Trump, in a Truth Social post on Saturday that was aimed at Attorney General Pam Bondi, said that Comey, New York Attorney General Letitia James, and Sen. Adam Schiff, D-California, are \"all guilty as hell, but nothing is going to get done.\"</p><p>\"Then we almost put in a Democrat supported U.S. Attorney, in Virginia, with a really bad Republican past.

It is also the largest one-month gain since August 2022. Sales were 15.4% higher than August 2024.</p><p>This count is based on people out shopping in August and signing deals, when the average rate on the 30-year fixed mortgage was higher than it is today. That rate started August at 6.63%, according to Mortgage News Daily, and didn't really move much during the month.</p><p>The sharp decline in rates began in September, when it <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2025/09/16/mortgage-rates-drop-to-3-year-low-ahead-of-fed-meeting.html\">fell to a three-year low</a> of 6.13% the day before the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2025/09/17/fed-rate-decision-september-2025.html\">Federal Reserve cut its lending rate</a>, and then moved higher to where it is now at 6.37%.</p><p>Given that rates hadn't fallen yet, it's curious that August sales jumped so high. Part of the answer may be in the survey itself.</p><p>\"We were expecting a gain but not that large,\" said Robert Dietz, chief economist at the National Association of Home Builders. \"Always important to remember the margin of error for new home sales is large. We'll need to wait for revisions next month and the September data point to see if this is smoothed out.\"</p></div><div><h2>Get Property Play directly to your inbox</h2><div><p>CNBC's Property Play with Diana Olick covers new and evolving opportunities for the real estate investor, delivered weekly to your inbox.</p><p><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/lander?id=propertyplay-newsletter\">Subscribe here to get access today</a>.</p></div></div><div><p>Homebuilder analyst Ivy Zelman of Zelman & Associates said the number was \"directionally right, but the magnitude was way too high.\" </p><p>Zelman conducts her own survey, which has a higher sample size spanning 15% of homebuilders, and it showed a sales increase of 6% year over year, she said.</p><p>While builders have talked a lot about cutting prices and incentives, the median price of a new home sold in August was $413,500, in increase of 1.9% year over year. In a separate survey on builder sentiment from the National Association of Home Builders, 39% of builders reported cutting prices in September, up from 37% in August and the highest percentage in the post-Covid period.</p><p>New home sales were strongest in the Northeast, where overall new construction is low, so swings can be large. It was also strong in the South, where homebuilding is busiest. Sales, while higher, were weakest in the West, where prices are highest.</p><p>\"While a volatile figure each month and always best to smooth out, I have to believe that the elevated level of home builder incentives was the main catalyst for the large upside surprise to new home sales,\" wrote Peter Boockvar, chief investment officer of One Point BFG Wealth Partner.  \"And we'll, of course, see the impact of lower mortgage rates when the September figure comes out, but keep in mind, if mortgage rates continue down ... builders will then reduce the pace at which they are implementing incentives and thus possibly offsetting the benefit of lower mortgage rates for new homes.\"</p><p>Strong sales took inventory down to a 7.4-month supply in August from a nine-month supply in July, a nearly 18% drop. Single-family housing starts and permits slowed in August both from July and from August of last year. This would seem to indicate that builders expected slower sales.</p></div></div>"
