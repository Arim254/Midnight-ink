They launched the business in 2017, and it was most recently valued at $1.7 billion in November 2021, <a href=\"https://www.zenbusiness.com/series-c-200m-funding/\" target=\"_blank\">according to the company</a>.</p><p>The pair previously worked together as executives at vacation rental marketplace HomeAway, which Expedia acquired for <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/video/2015/11/05/expedia-buying-homeaway-for-3-9b-.html\">$3.9 billion</a> in 2015.</p><p>When they teamed up to start ZenBusiness, they spent roughly 10 months researching their industry and talking to dozens of entrepreneurs about their businesses' biggest pain points around legal compliance, says Hemmati, 62.</p><p>\"When you have an idea, you already have identified a pain point you want to solve for,\" she says. The next step is figuring out how to solve it, she says, but you shouldn't jump to that stage too quickly, or without first conducting necessary research.</p></div><h2><a></a>Learn customers' needs by 'constantly interviewing'</h2><div><p>Hemmati says she and Buhrdorf knew they wanted to build an AI-powered software that helped small businesses manage and file legal documents. They had already witnessed the issue firsthand working at a startup and also found public data that showed it to be a widespread obstacle for entrepreneurs across the country, Hemmati adds.</p><p>They initially planned on marketing the service only to existing businesses, but talking to prospective clients<strong> </strong>made them realize that they should instead target first-time business owners who've never navigated a \"pretty complex\" legal process before, she says.</p><p>\"We spoke with roughly 50 to 100 prospective customers to understand what they needed most — everything from formation help to ongoing compliance and growth services,\" she says. \"We ran design sprints, tested different packages and pricing, even built websites and refunded early sign-ups just to see what caught people's attention and what they were willing to pay for.\"</p><p><em><strong>DON'T MISS</strong></em><strong>:</strong><a href=\"https://smarter.cnbcmakeit.com/p/how-to-start-a-business-for-first-time-founders?utm_source=cnbc&utm_medium=makeitarticle&utm_campaign=body\" target=\"_blank\"><strong> </strong><em><strong>The ultimate guide to starting a business—everything you need to know to be your own boss</strong></em></a></p><p>That strategy proved invaluable, giving Hemmati and Buhrdorf \"incredible insight and the confidence to launch,\" she adds.</p><p>Working with those business owners from the start also meant those clients would be more likely to keep using ZenBusiness' software as their companies grew, Hemmati says. ZenBusiness has now worked with at least 850,000 small businesses, according to the company.</p><p>The takeaway for other prospective entrepreneurs, she says: Any business idea needs to be properly vetted, and the first step is always <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2025/07/18/hbs-lecturer-biggest-mistakes-people-make-when-starting-a-business.html\">researching your market</a> and talking to the customers and clients you want the business to reach.</p><p>\"[Start] by having that communication and collaboration, constantly interviewing your potential customers and learning about what is the next product that they're interested in, and how you should even go about building it,\" Hemmati says.</p></div><h2><a></a>'If you can't pivot...chances are you will fail'</h2><div><p>Steve Blank, an author and serial entrepreneur who teaches a course on the subject at Stanford University, similarly says that a failure to properly research your potential customers before building a business model is a \"fatal mistake\" that will likely doom any new business before it even launches.</p><p>\"The most important [question] is: 'Well, who are my customers?' And the second one is: 'What do they want?'\" <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2025/03/24/steve-blank-most-people-make-this-fatal-mistake-starting-a-business.html\">Blank told CNBC Make It</a> in March. \"It's not: 'Here's what I'm building. Can I sell it to someone?'\"</p><p>As important as it is to seek out that feedback, though, it can only help entrepreneurs who are actually open to new perspectives and willing to adapt.</p><p>\"If you can't pivot or pivot quickly, chances are you will fail,\" <a href=\"https://steveblank.com/2010/04/12/why-startups-are-agile-and-opportunistic-%E2%80%93-pivoting-the-business-model/\" target=\"_blank\">Blank wrote</a> in a 2010 blog post.</p><p>Hemmati agrees: \"There is a huge difference between those who have a mindset of exactly how they want to do [something], versus those who are truly open and think through [their options],\" she says, adding that, ultimately, that mindset can be the difference between success and failure.</p><p><em><strong>Want to be your own boss?</strong> Sign up for Smarter by CNBC Make It's new online course, </em><a href=\"https://smarter.cnbcmakeit.com/p/how-to-start-a-business-for-first-time-founders?utm_source=cnbc&utm_medium=makeitarticle&utm_campaign=bottom\" target=\"_blank\"><em>How To Start A Business: For First-Time Founders</em></a><em>.

The change is pending approval by the Securities and Exchange Commission.</p><p>The $25,000 minimum equity rule mandates that traders must maintain a minimum account balance of $25,000 in a margin account to execute four or more day trades within a five-business-day period. The rule was put in place in 2001 amid the dot-com bubble and crash as regulators grew worried that small traders were taking excessive risks with volatile internet stocks.</p><p>FINRA is replacing this mandate with an intraday margin rule that applies the existing maintenance margin rules to intraday exposure. In other words, one's intraday buying power will be based on the margin requirements for the positions they take on during the day, not a fixed equity minimum.</p><p>The regulators said the overhaul reflects how technology and market access have transformed retail trading since the rules were first adopted.</p><p>The rule change could lead to more options trading and boost activity for brokers like <span><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/HOOD/\">Robinhood</a><span><span></span></span></span>.</p><p>Robinhood shares rebounded from an earlier loss and were higher by 1% in Wednesday trading following the FINRA news.</p></div></div>"

    "body": "<div><div><p>Mediaphotos | Getty Images</p></div><div><p>For humans to pass the prestigious, three-part chartered financial analyst exam, it typically takes around 1,000 hours of studying over the course of several years. New research found that the technology underpinning a slew of artificial intelligence models is now advanced enough to pass even the most difficult – Level III – mock exams in a matter of minutes.</p><p>The new <a href=\"https://www.cfabenchmark.com/\" target=\"_blank\">study</a> – developed by researchers from New York University Stern School of Business and GoodFin, an AI-powered wealth management platform – evaluated 23 large language models on their ability to answer multiple choice and essay questions on mock CFA Level III exams. They found frontier reasoning models, including o4-mini, Gemini 2.5 Pro and Claude Opus, were able to use \"chain-of-thought prompting\" to successfully pass.</p><p>Previous research, particularly from two years ago, had found artificial intelligence could clear Levels I and II of the exam, but it struggled with Level III, due to the essay questions. However, the technology has evolved so rapidly that the researchers wanted to know whether the models could handle, \"specialized, high-stakes analytical reasoning required for professional financial decision-making.\" The third CFA exam is primarily focused on portfolio management and wealth planning.</p><p>\"I think there's absolutely a future where this technology transforms the industry,\" said Anna Joo Fee, founder and CEO of GoodFin, which contributed to – but did not pay for – the research.</p><p>Still, Fee said she does not think the AI will ultimately replace the CFA.</p><p>\"There are things like context and intent that are hard for the machine to assess right now,\" Fee said. \"That's where a human shines, in understanding your body language and cues.\"</p></div><div><h2>Don’t miss these insights from CNBC PRO</h2><div><ul><li><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2025/09/16/market-track-record-is-stellar-when-fed-cuts-rates-with-sp-500-at-record.html\">Market track record is flawless when the Fed cuts rates with S&P 500 near record high</a></li><li><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2025/09/16/fed-rate-cuts-will-make-dividend-stocks-more-appealing-for-income-investors-here-are-a-few-standouts.html\">Fed rate cuts will make dividend stocks more appealing for income investors.

Eli Lilly announced in February that it would <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2025/02/26/eli-lilly-to-invest-27-billion-in-new-us-manufacturing.html\">spend at least $27 billion</a> to build four new domestic manufacturing plants, adding to $23 billion in previous investments since 2020. </p><p>Eli Lilly said it will announce the two remaining U.S. sites this year. The company expects to begin making medicines at all four facilities within five years. </p><p>That added production capacity for Eli Lilly's obesity pill, orforglipron, is crucial as the company races to bring it to market and tries to maintain its dominance in the booming market for GLP-1s. Eli Lilly and <span><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/NVO/\">Novo Nordisk</a><span><span></span></span></span> have previously faced supply constraints with their existing weekly injections, as demand skyrocketed in the U.S. </p><p>\"Our new Houston site will enhance Lilly's ability to manufacture orforglipron at scale and, if approved, help fulfill the medicine's potential as an obesity and type 2 diabetes treatment for tens of millions of people worldwide who prefer the ease of a pill that can be taken without food and water restrictions,\" Eli Lilly CEO David Ricks said in the release. </p><p>Drugmakers have been scrambling to boost their production in the U.S. as President Donald Trump threatens to impose tariffs on pharmaceuticals imported into the U.S. Trump has said those levies will encourage companies to re-shore production after domestic drug manufacturing shrank dramatically over the past decade.</p><p>In a release Tuesday, Eli Lilly said the new Houston plant will focus on manufacturing orforglipron and the company's pipeline of other small molecule medicines across different disease areas, including cardiometabolic health, oncology, immunology and neuroscience. Small molecule drugs, which often come in pill form, are more convenient for patients to take than injectable medications and are generally easier and cheaper to manufacture at scale.  </p><p>Eli Lilly said the site will bring 615 jobs to the Greater Houston area, including highly skilled engineers, scientists, operations personnel and lab technicians, and 4,000 construction jobs.</p></div></div>"

It is also the largest one-month gain since August 2022. Sales were 15.4% higher than August 2024.</p><p>This count is based on people out shopping in August and signing deals, when the average rate on the 30-year fixed mortgage was higher than it is today.

Part of the answer may be in the survey itself.</p><p>\"We were expecting a gain but not that large,\" said Robert Dietz, chief economist at the National Association of Home Builders. \"Always important to remember the margin of error for new home sales is large. We'll need to wait for revisions next month and the September data point to see if this is smoothed out.\"</p></div><div><h2>Get Property Play directly to your inbox</h2><div><p>CNBC's Property Play with Diana Olick covers new and evolving opportunities for the real estate investor, delivered weekly to your inbox.</p><p><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/lander?id=propertyplay-newsletter\">Subscribe here to get access today</a>.</p></div></div><div><p>Homebuilder analyst Ivy Zelman of Zelman & Associates said the number was \"directionally right, but the magnitude was way too high.\" </p><p>Zelman conducts her own survey, which has a higher sample size spanning 15% of homebuilders, and it showed a sales increase of 6% year over year, she said.</p><p>While builders have talked a lot about cutting prices and incentives, the median price of a new home sold in August was $413,500, in increase of 1.9% year over year. In a separate survey on builder sentiment from the National Association of Home Builders, 39% of builders reported cutting prices in September, up from 37% in August and the highest percentage in the post-Covid period.</p><p>New home sales were strongest in the Northeast, where overall new construction is low, so swings can be large. It was also strong in the South, where homebuilding is busiest. Sales, while higher, were weakest in the West, where prices are highest.</p><p>\"While a volatile figure each month and always best to smooth out, I have to believe that the elevated level of home builder incentives was the main catalyst for the large upside surprise to new home sales,\" wrote Peter Boockvar, chief investment officer of One Point BFG Wealth Partner.  \"And we'll, of course, see the impact of lower mortgage rates when the September figure comes out, but keep in mind, if mortgage rates continue down ... builders will then reduce the pace at which they are implementing incentives and thus possibly offsetting the benefit of lower mortgage rates for new homes.\"</p><p>Strong sales took inventory down to a 7.4-month supply in August from a nine-month supply in July, a nearly 18% drop. Single-family housing starts and permits slowed in August both from July and from August of last year. This would seem to indicate that builders expected slower sales.</p></div><div><h2>Don’t miss these insights from CNBC PRO</h2><div><ul><li><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2025/09/16/market-track-record-is-stellar-when-fed-cuts-rates-with-sp-500-at-record.html\">Market track record is flawless when the Fed cuts rates with S&P 500 near record high</a></li><li><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2025/09/16/fed-rate-cuts-will-make-dividend-stocks-more-appealing-for-income-investors-here-are-a-few-standouts.html\">Fed rate cuts will make dividend stocks more appealing for income investors.

    "body": "<div><p>A \"we're hiring\" sign is displayed outside a Target store, after U.S. employment growth slowed more than expected in July,  in Encinitas, California, U.S. August 1, 2025.   </p><p>Mike Blake | Reuters</p></div><div><p>Seasonal hiring in the retail industry is poised to fall to its lowest level since the 2009 recession, an early warning sign that the holiday shopping season could be softer than expected, job placement firm Challenger, Gray & Christmas said in a Wednesday report. </p><p>Challenger is projecting retailers may add under 500,000 positions in the final three months of 2025, marking the smallest seasonal gain in 16 years and an 8% decline from the year-ago period. </p><p>\"Seasonal employers are facing a confluence of factors this year: tariffs loom, inflationary pressures linger, and many companies continue to rely on automation and permanent staff instead of large waves of seasonal hires,\" said Andy Challenger, a senior vice president and workplace expert at Challenger, Gray & Christmas.</p><p>\"While we could see a late hiring push if holiday sales surprise to the upside, the cautious pace of announcements so far suggests that companies are not betting on a big seasonal surge. This year may be more about doing more with less.\" </p><p>Challenger's projections come as fewer companies make seasonal hiring announcements. </p><p>This time last year, retailers like <span><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/TGT/\">Target</a><span><span></span></span></span>, <span><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/M/\">Macy's</a><span><span></span></span></span>, <span><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/BURL/\">Burlington Stores</a><span><span></span></span></span>, Aldi and <span><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/FLWS/\">1-800-Flowers</a><span><span></span></span></span> had already announced the number of seasonal workers they planned to hire. But so far this season, none of those companies have disclosed the number of seasonal workers they plan to hire yet.</p><p>Last year, Target said it would hire 100,000 seasonal workers. This year, it said it's offering additional hours to its current employees and tapping into its \"On-Demand team\" – a group of about 43,000 store employees who pick up shifts based on their schedules. </p><p>While Target said it also hires seasonal team members across its stores and supply chain facilities, it didn't say how many it was planning to hire. </p><p>Meanwhile, Macy's, Burlington Stores, Aldi and 1-800-Flowers have not released any information about their holiday hiring plans. </p><p>While some companies like <span><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/AMZN/\">Amazon</a><span><span></span></span></span> and <span><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/UPS/\">UPS</a><span><span></span></span></span> release hiring figures a bit later in the season, Spirit Halloween and <span><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/BBWI/\">Bath & Body Works</a><span><span></span></span></span> are among the few to have published their seasonal hiring plans so far. </p><p>Spirit said it's planning to hire 50,000 people, the same number as last year, according to Challenger. Bath & Body Works is planning to hire 32,000 workers, down slightly from 32,700 last year, Challenger said.</p><p>The muted response from the retail industry so far reflects the overall job market, which has <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2025/09/05/jobs-report-august-2025.html\">slowed in recent months</a>, contributing to the Federal Reserve's <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2025/09/23/powell-says-slowing-labor-market-prompted-rate-cut-sees-challenging-situation-ahead.html\">decision to cut its key interest rate</a> last week. </p><p>In August, <a href=\"https://www.bls.gov/news.release/empsit.nr0.htm\" target=\"_blank\">nonfarm payrolls</a> increased by just 22,000, far below the 75,000 expected by economists surveyed by Dow Jones, and a marked slowdown from July.  </p><p>In the months before the crucial holiday shopping season, many consumer companies that rely on seasonal workers release the number of employees they plan to hire, which is an indicator of how strong the season is expected to be. Challenger's report is one of many<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2025/04/26/americans-are-getting-flashbacks-to-2008-as-tariffs-stoke-recession-fears.html\"> indicators</a> of economic weakness consumers have clocked in recent months amid fears that President <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/donald-trump/\">Donald Trump</a>'s trade war could damage the economy.</p><p>Consumers have been under pressure for several years from persistent inflation and stubbornly high interest rates, but now they're also contending with even higher prices on some goods from tariffs and record high credit card debt. Many companies are offsetting the costs of higher tariffs by <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2025/05/31/trump-tariffs-here-are-the-retailers-raising-prices.html\">raising prices</a>, which could have a chilling effect on consumer demand in the months ahead.</p><p>In early September, consulting firm PwC published a report that found shoppers are planning to spend 5% less on holiday gifts, travel and entertainment this year – the first notable drop since 2020. AlixPartners, another consulting firm, said it's forecasting an \"underwhelming\" 3% to 5% growth rate in holiday retail sales this year.</p></div>"

Reuters first reported the equity stake proposal.</p><p>Lithium Americas' shares surged 95% to close at $6.01. The stock hit a session high of $6.23, up more than 100% over Tuesday's close of $3.07. The miner has a market cap of about $1.5 billion.</p><p>It is the latest move by the White House to take direct ownership in the mineral supply chain critical to U.S. interests, but the first such stake proposed for a Canadian company.

GM has a 38% stake and has agreed to buy offtake from the mine when it is operational. Lithium is a critical material for electric vehicle batteries.</p><p>Lithium Americas and GM had to renegotiate the terms of the loan for Thacker Pass because they did not meet the conditions for the first disbursement, the Trump administration official said. During negotiations with the Department of Energy, they requested to push out part of the loan repayment into later years, the official said.</p><p>\"If we're going to push out part of the repayment into later years, then the administration would like a very small stake of equity to create essentially a cash buffer and eliminate some risk on behalf of taxpayers,\" the official said.</p><p>A deal has not been finalized but the Trump administration supports the project and the discussions are positive, the official said.
