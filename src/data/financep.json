    "body": "<div><div><p>Despite the prevalence of cervical cancer diagnoses and deaths in the United States, <a href=\"https://aacrjournals.org/cebp/article-abstract/34/6/836/762621/Prevalence-and-Review-of-Major-Modifiable-Cancer?redirectedFrom=fulltext\" target=\"_blank\">data</a> shows that screening for the cancer is on a consistent decline.</p><p>Each year in the U.S., around 4,000 women die from cervical cancer, and about 13,000 are diagnosed with the disease, according to the <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/cervical-cancer/statistics/index.html\" target=\"_blank\">Centers for Disease Control and Prevention</a>.</p><p>The most effective way to prevent cervical cancer is receiving the HPV vaccine, which offers protection against the HPV types that most frequently cause it, the <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/cervical-cancer/prevention/index.html\" target=\"_blank\">CDC states</a>. It's also important for women to get screened for the disease.</p><p>One common test for cervical cancer detection is a Pap smear, which doctors recommend once every three years for women between the ages of 21 and 65. Women ages 30 to 65 can also receive an HPV test and a Pap test every five years, or get tested for HPV alone every five years.</p><p>But, a recent report from the American Cancer Society shows that the <a href=\"https://www.cancer.org/research/acs-research-news/not-enough-females-are-being-screened-for-cervical-cancer.html\" target=\"_blank\">rate of cervical cancer screenings fell</a> during the Covid-19 pandemic, and haven't recovered.</p><p><a href=\"https://www.getteal.com/people/kara-egan\" target=\"_blank\">Kara Egan</a>, a health tech investor, saw a need for making Pap smears more accessible. She co-founded Teal Health, a healthcare company that created the <a href=\"https://www.getteal.com/teal-wand\" target=\"_blank\">Teal Wand</a>, the first FDA-approved cervical screening test that can be done at home.</p><p>\"What drove me to start Teal is just that women deserve better healthcare,\" says Egan, who is also the company's CEO.</p><p>\"And what does better look like? It looks like listening to a woman and seeing what she needs.\"</p></div><h2><a></a>'Even if the visit's free, you had to leave work, you had to get childcare'</h2><div><p>For Egan and her team, accessibility was a huge focus when creating the concept for the Teal Wand.</p><p>\"It's like, 'What are all of the touch points that we can do to make something easier for a woman, but to also build that trust with her, that she matters and that we care?\" Egan tells CNBC Make It.</p><p>\"I think a lot of them can be done in ways that you wouldn't expect or that healthcare doesn't do.\"</p><p>Before receiving a Teal Wand, customers must go through the screening process with a doctor who helps them determine their eligibility based on their insurance coverage, and teaches them how to properly use the wand to get an accurate sample.</p><p>\"We're doing the exact same test that's used in the doctor's office with the same accuracy, that's what our clinical trials show, but just you're collecting the sample at home,\" Egan explains.</p></div><div><p>The Teal Wand is the first FDA-approved cervical screening test that can be done at home.</p><p>Courtesy of Teal Health.</p></div><div><p>Once the sample is collected and tested, the results are shared via the company's online portal, and patients can connect to a medical provider<strong> </strong>via a tele-health visit to talk through next steps if a follow-up is needed.</p><p>What's unique about the process is that everything, from the screening process to the collection and receiving results is done from home. Egan says, that is by design, to make the process easier for people who struggle to get to in-person doctor's visits.</p><p>\"Cost is important, and it's critically important to us, [but] that's not the main barrier a lot of times for people,\" she says.</p><p>\"There's also the cost of going into the doctor's office. Even if the visit's free, you had to leave work, you had to get childcare, you had to [find] transportation.\"</p></div><h2><a></a>'Over 50% of women getting screened with Teal have been behind on their screening'</h2><div><p>The Teal Wand is now available in California, New York and Florida. Teal Health is in network with Cigna, Blue Cross Blue Shield, Aetna, Anthem Blue Cross and United Healthcare.</p><p>\"We're able to take [care of] the telehealth portion, and then a woman pays $99. But we are working with insurers to get the full thing covered,\" Egan says.</p><p>\"Even with a $99 charge, we're seeing over 50% of women who are getting screened with Teal have been behind on their screening, and 20% of them had never been screened before, and were well within screening age.\"</p><p>The driving factor for founding Teal Health for Egan and her team was to spread awareness of the importance of cervical cancer screening, and to offer a new option for testing, Egan notes.</p><p>\"Cervical cancer is entirely preventable if you get screened,\" she says. \"There are new ways to do it. One is in the office and one is at home, but they're highly accurate, and you should be doing it.\"</p><p><em><strong>Last chance to save: Want to be your own boss?</strong> Final days to get 30% off Smarter by CNBC Make It's new online course, </em><a href=\"https://smarter.cnbcmakeit.com/p/how-to-start-a-business-for-first-time-founders?utm_source=cnbc&utm_medium=makeitarticle&utm_campaign=bottom\" target=\"_blank\"><em>How To Start A Business: For First-Time Founders</em></a><em>.

    "description": "You've likely heard of the fight, flight and freeze responses. But there is also a fourth, lesser known one: fawn. It can make you feel insecure, and make it harder to set healthy boundaries. Psychotherapist Meg Josephson shares some tips about how to handle it.",
    "body": "<div><div><p>You may be familiar with the \"fight, flight, or <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2025/06/14/10-signs-youre-in-a-functional-freezeand-the-no-1-way-out-of-it.html\">freeze</a>\" survival responses. </p><p>But there's another \"F\" word:<a href=\"https://pete-walker.com/fourFs_TraumaTypologyComplexPTSD.htm\" target=\"_blank\"> the fawn response</a>, which is perhaps less recognized, but is the one I most commonly see as a psychotherapist, and one that I have experienced in my own life. </p><p>Fawning is about appeasing a threat, either real or perceived, and satisfying it. When we're in a fawn response, we move toward the threat instead of away from it. This people pleasing behavior can make you feel <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2025/03/14/if-you-answer-yes-to-these-questions-you-may-come-across-as-insecure.html\">insecure</a> when you have absolutely no reason to be.</p><p>Here's how to look out for the fawn response, and how to handle it. </p></div><h2><a></a>Where the fawn response comes from</h2><div><p>While there are many circumstances that feed the need to fawn, the thread is the same: \"I can't feel safe until everyone is happy with me.\"</p><p>When the body detects some sort of threat, whether it is real (a lion chasing you) or perceived (your boss being a little standoffish), it can feel the same to the nervous system. </p><p>Maybe you grew up in a home where you had to hold your breath and monitor a parent's moods because things could flip in an instant. Or maybe you had a highly critical parent, and being \"perfect\" was your way of staying ahead of criticism. I can certainly relate. </p><p>A prime example of the fawn response is the instinct you might have to ask someone, \"Are you mad at me?\" </p><p><em><strong>DON'T MISS</strong></em><a href=\"https://smarter.cnbcmakeit.com/p/how-to-start-a-business-for-first-time-founders?utm_source=cnbc&utm_medium=makeitarticle&utm_campaign=body\" target=\"_blank\"><em><strong>:</strong> <strong>The ultimate guide to starting a business—everything you need to know to be your own boss</strong></em></a> </p></div><h2><a></a>What the fawn response actually looks like</h2><div><p>To be clear, fawning isn't a bad thing. It's an automatic survival mechanism, and sometimes we need to fawn, whether it's to get a paycheck or to ensure immediate safety. </p><p>But in order to hyper-attune to other people's moods, reactions, and perceptions, we often disconnect from and neglect ourselves. Here are some common fawn response behaviors to watch out for:</p><ul><li>Constantly overthinking social interactions.</li><li>Not being able to say no or set boundaries, and then feeling resentful.</li><li>Feeling terrified of conflict or of people thinking you disagree with them.</li><li>Morphing yourself into a \"chameleon\" in relationships.</li><li>Fearing that you're about to get in trouble.</li><li>Being drawn to people who are emotionally unavailable, critical, or hard to please, because they feel like \"home.\"</li><li>Feeling like you don't know who you are anymore because you've silenced your own opinions.</li></ul><p>All of this adds up to seeming and feeling insecure. If these patterns resonate, I imagine that at some point they were genuinely helpful and protective. So the body thinks: <em>Hey, this works, let's keep doing it.</em> What feels familiar will always feel safe, even if it no longer serves us. </p></div><h2><a></a>How to break out of a fawn response cycle </h2><div><p>The fawn response is an unconscious pattern, so noticing it and bringing it into the forefront of your mind is the first step. Here are a few practices I like to recommend to my patients. </p><ol><li><strong>Pause. </strong>Before you go to over-apologize, shrink yourself, shove your needs down, get lost in an overthinking spiral — pause. Check in with yourself. Ask \"What do I need right now? What do I think of this? What am I feeling?\" It's great to care about others, but not if you abandon your needs in the process.</li><li><strong>Lean back. </strong>Let's say your parent sends you a text while you're in the middle of something, and your immediate instinct is to respond so you won't disappoint them. Instead, finish what you were doing and respond when you're free. This is all about releasing urgency where it's not necessary or helpful. By slowing down, we're communicating to our bodies that we're safe.</li><li><strong>Look inward. </strong>Practice expressing your needs in relationships that feel safest to you, in everyday ways. For example, when your partner asks what you want for dinner, instead of saying, \"Whatever you want!\" take a moment to ask yourself: \"What do I actually want?\" Can you allow yourself to express it? And then don't be afraid to do so. </li></ol><p>When we've been conditioned to believe that we aren't allowed to have needs, that we're responsible for managing other people's emotions, boundaries may be hard for us to set. Many of us may fear that if we set boundaries, we'll be seen as cold or mean. But I like to think of boundaries as a way to strengthen the relationships we really want in our lives. </p><p><a href=\"https://megjosephson.com/\" target=\"_blank\"><em><strong>Meg Josephson</strong></em></a><em> is a licensed psychotherapist and the author of the bestselling book, </em><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Are-You-Mad-Me-Focusing-ebook/dp/B0DQLMS9VG\" target=\"_blank\"><em>\"Are You Mad at Me?: How to Stop Focusing on What Others Think So You Can Start Living for You</em></a><em>.\"</em></p><p><em><strong>Last chance to save: Want to be your own boss?</strong> Final days to get 30% off Smarter by CNBC Make It's new online course, </em><a href=\"https://smarter.cnbcmakeit.com/p/how-to-start-a-business-for-first-time-founders?utm_source=cnbc&utm_medium=makeitarticle&utm_campaign=bottom\" target=\"_blank\"><em>How To Start A Business: For First-Time Founders</em></a><em>.

    "body": "<div><div><p>In 2015, I packed up my life in Austin, Texas and<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2024/12/07/i-help-americans-move-abroad-key-steps-to-take-before-you-go.html\"> moved to Madrid</a>. I was 35 and it wasn't my first attempt. I had spent more than a decade dreaming, trying, and failing to make Spain home.</p><p>Since then, I've built a life in Spain and created <a href=\"https://shehitrefresh.com/\" target=\"_blank\">She Hit Refresh</a>, where I've helped hundreds of other women move abroad. </p><p>Along the way, I've experienced moments when my life in Europe felt like a movie. Like the time I stumbled upon a flamenco dancer in a hidden square, sipped wine at a Parisian café while the world passed by, or rode a Vespa past the Colosseum in Rome.</p><p>But these moments aren't everyday life, and not everything about moving abroad is just as you imagine it to be. Here are the six myths I hear most often about relocating.</p></div><h2><a></a>1. 'It's so cheap'</h2><div><p>Many countries can feel more affordable than the U.S., but living abroad is probably not as cheap as you think. Costs are rising around the world, especially housing prices. <a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/web/products-eurostat-news/w/ddn-20250704-4\" target=\"_blank\">House prices in the EU went up</a> 57.9% between 2010 and the first quarter of 2025, while rents increased by 27.8%. </p><p>My advice: Run the numbers based on <em>today's</em> reality, not outdated blog posts. And remember, what feels affordable to you on a U.S. salary may still be unaffordable for locals. Don't overpay. It only fuels the problem.</p></div><h2><a></a>2. 'Americans aren't welcome'</h2><div><p>The real pressure comes from tourism, not the relatively small number of Americans moving abroad. And while anti-tourism sentiment exists in crowded cities, it's not really about Americans, or even expats at all. The bigger issue is affordable housing — or, as I mentioned, the lack of it.</p><p>But smaller towns across Europe <em>want</em> new residents due to depopulation. If you're serious about integrating, consider looking beyond hotspots like Lisbon, Barcelona, or Amsterdam. </p><p>Regardless, in my own experience, when you learn the language, contribute, and connect, you'll usually be <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2025/05/18/i-help-americans-move-abroad-most-welcoming-countries-in-europe.html\">welcomed with open arms</a>.</p></div><h2><a></a>3. 'You'll be lonely'</h2><div><p>Of course you'll miss family and friends, but community abroad often forms faster than you'd expect.</p><p>Other Americans and English-speaking foreigners are eager to connect. Between meetups, language exchanges, and expat events, you'll have no shortage of opportunities to meet people.</p><p>That said, deep friendships take time. I'm an extrovert, and it still took me around 2.5 years to feel like I had a strong community in Madrid. Many of <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2025/04/10/these-things-are-crucial-to-happy-friendships-says-connection-expert.html\">my closest friendships</a> came from hosting my own meetups.</p><p>For deeper integration, friendships with locals are key, though those are definitely harder to form. Many locals already have tight circles, and breaking in takes patience and persistence. Learning the language is essential, and it takes time. Most people are still beginners after a year.</p></div><h2><a></a>4. 'Life abroad is perfect'</h2><div><p>Living abroad can absolutely improve your quality of life — whether it's a slower pace, a relatively lower cost of living, or easier travel, there's a lot to love. But it's not a fairy tale.</p><p>You'll still deal with bureaucracy, taxes, and logistics like finding an apartment, setting up bank accounts, and making appointments with doctors. And sometimes the grocery store will just be closed on a Sunday when you need it most.</p><p>The hardest challenges are often personal. I'll never forget when I got the call that my father had passed away. It was in 2009, during one of my earlier stints in Spain, getting my master's degree. I learned then that the highs and lows of life still happen abroad, and the lows are tougher when you're far from home.</p></div><h2><a></a>5. 'Where you start is where you have to stay'</h2><div><p>Your first move abroad doesn't have to be your forever home. Think of it as a starting point, not a lifelong commitment. As someone once told me: It's a move, not a marriage. </p><p>When I moved to Madrid in 2015, I thought I'd never leave. But in 2020, I moved to Málaga, and now I'm considering heading back to Madrid again.</p><p>I've seen this with others, too. <a href=\"https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/still-saying-yes-how-cindy-built-a-life-abroad-in-her-60s-ep-56/id1449428314?i=1000694368757\" target=\"_blank\">Cindy Sheahan</a>, for example, moved to Porto, Portugal, but then decided Italy was a better fit and relocated there a year later.</p><p>Giving yourself permission to pivot can help you <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2025/06/02/avoid-this-common-trap-that-makes-decisions-harder-and-your-life-worse-take-simple-steps-instead.html\">avoid getting stuck in research paralysis</a>, trying to make the \"perfect\" choice before you even start. There are plenty of things you just won't know until you've actually moved.</p></div><h2><a></a>6. 'It's too late for me'</h2><div><p>I was 35 when I moved and thought I was already too old. At the time, I only knew of students and <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2025/06/03/55-year-old-american-who-retired-in-portugal-shares-myths-about-living-abroad-as-an-expat.html\">retirees moving abroad</a>, not people in the middle of their careers. But at 45, I can say without hesitation that it was the best decision I've ever made.</p><p>And once I got here, I met so many people my age and older who had done the same. People make the leap at every age — 30s, 40s, 50s, even 70s.</p><p>In fact, moving in your 30s or later has advantages, since people tend to arrive with more financial stability, better <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2024/08/01/wharton-psychologist-adam-grant-to-know-yourself-better-try-this.html\">self-awareness</a>, and the wisdom to navigate challenges with perspective.</p><p><em><strong>Cepee Tabibian</strong> is the founder of </em><a href=\"https://shehitrefresh.com/\" target=\"_blank\"><em>She Hit Refresh</em></a><em>, a community and resource platform that helps women aged 30+ move abroad.

In 2016, while living in Korea, Ryan got in trouble for breaking his curfew. He lost out on several months of pay, was restricted to his military base and demoted from staff sergeant to senior airman.</p><p>\"After this, I was very depressed and very sad,\" Ryan said. \"But that depression and sadness make you think about where your life is going and it makes you redirect your life into the right direction.\"</p></div><div><p>In Vietnam, Ryan lives off of roughly $4,000 a month.</p><p>Louis Corallo for CNBC Make It</p></div><div><p>In that period of time that Ryan was restricted to his military base, he planned a trip to visit a friend in Vietnam.</p><p>\"It just looked like so much fun and it really lived up to all the hype,\" he said. \"I ended up having the best time of my life, and that depression was [just] gone.\"</p><p>Ryan says that after that first trip to Vietnam and seeing how happy he was, he didn't want to let go of that feeling.

TipRanks' AI Analyst has an \"outperform\" rating on Nvidia stock with a price target of $204.</p><p>Highlighting the key takeaways from his conversation with the company's CFO, Lipacis said that Nvidia will be the preferred supplier to OpenAI, adding that the ChatGPT platform has underestimated demand for its solution and wants to get ahead of future demand. Nvidia is well-positioned to help OpenAI with this infrastructure buildout.</p><p>Lipacis noted that the deal specifies at least 10 GW (gigawatts) of AI infrastructure, and Nvidia management confirmed that, historically, the company's total addressable market (TAM) was $30 billion to $40 billion per GW, although it could increase in the future. The analyst increased his 2026 revenue and earnings per share (EPS) estimates by 2% for Nvidia, but thinks that his forecast may be conservative.</p><p>Lipacis ranks No. 53 among more than 10,000 analysts tracked by TipRanks. His ratings have been successful 66% of the time, delivering an average return of 26.5%. See Nvidia ETF Exposure on TipRanks.</p><h3>MongoDB</h3><p>Next is database management software company <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/\">MongoDB</a> (<a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/mdb\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>MDB</strong></a>). The company recently held a MongoDB.local event in New York City, hosting an Investor Session focused on profitable growth and providing a 3- to 5-year financial framework.</p><p>Following the event, Needham analyst Mike Cikos reiterated a buy rating on MongoDB and increased his <a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/mdb/forecast\" target=\"_blank\">price target to $365</a> from $325. TipRanks' AI Analyst is also bullish on MDB stock, giving it an \"outperform\" rating and a price target of $355.</p><p>Cikos said that while investors' initial reaction to the high-teens revenue growth forecast was underwhelming, he expects both AI and competitive migrations to drive incremental growth for MongoDB.</p><p>The 5-star analyst noted that management plans to continue investing in the business, though at a slower rate than revenue and gross profit growth. MongoDB's investments will mainly focus on developer awareness, research & development and its sales force.The company has also identified areas for optimization and expects its scale to drive profitable growth through efficiencies.</p><p>Cikos said that following the MongoDB.local event he is \"incrementally more positive on MongoDB's AI positioning,\" driven by embeddings, which bridge data and Large Language Models (LLMs), and the continued integration of Voyage's best-in-class models.</p><p>Cikos ranks No. 581 among more than 10,000 analysts tracked by TipRanks. His ratings have been profitable 59% of the time, delivering an average return of 14.1%.

The cloud-native platform offers security solutions for critical areas of enterprise risk — endpoints and cloud workloads, identity, and data.</p><p>Following CrowdStrike's recently held<strong> </strong>Fal.Con 2025 event, RBC Capital analyst Matthew Hedberg reiterated a buy rating on CrowdStrike with a <a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/crwd/forecast\" target=\"_blank\">12-month price target of $510</a>, saying the commentary from management, partners and customers reinforced his bullish long-term thesis. CrowdStrike remains one of RBC's top cybersecurity ideas, he added. TipRanks' AI Analyst has a \"neutral\" rating on CrowdStrike stock with a target price of $543.</p><p>\"Overall, we thought the event made a compelling case for the company's positioning as we enter the agentic era,\" said Hedberg.</p><p>The 5-star analyst mainly noted lucrative prospects in agentic security for CrowdStrike and the evolution of its agentic security operations center (SOC). He added that management views the agentic revolution as a huge opportunity (potentially over a 100x), with the rise of more identities and complexity creating new security needs.</p><p>Management sees a total addressable market (TAM) of $300 billion in 2030, up from $140 billion in 2026, with key tailwinds resulting from market consolidation, the evolving threat landscape and technological advancements. Helped by these tailwinds, Hedberg believes CrowdStrike is well-positioned for continued market consolidation as it secures an AI-led transformation.  </p><p>Hedberg noted that CrowdStrike is about halfway through its $10 billion annual recurring revenue (ARR) goal for fiscal 2031. While cloud, the Next-Gen Identity Security offering and the Next-Gen SIEM platform are the key drivers for the current ARR of $4.7 billion, management expects agentic SOC to be the main catalyst for achieving the $10 billion ARR target for fiscal 2031. CrowdStrike expects Agentic Everywhere to be the key driver for the newly introduced $20 billion ARR target for fiscal 2036.</p><p>Hedberg ranks No. 37 among more than 10,000 analysts tracked by TipRanks. His ratings have been successful 70% of the time, delivering an average return of 21.6%. See CrowdStrike Insider Trading Activity on TipRanks.</p></div></div>"

Behind them is a depiction of the seal of the Federal Reserve.</p><p>The image appears to be \"AI-generated or digitally illustrated,\" according to visual analysis by ChatGPT.</p><p>Trump has repeatedly criticized Powell for his cautious approach to cutting interest rates, nicknaming him \"Too Late Powell.\" The latest threat came even as the central bank lowered rates earlier this month for the first time this year. Powell's term as chair ends in May 2026.</p><p>The White House didn't immediately respond to CNBC's request for comment.</p><p>Firing the top central banker would be unprecedented as no U.S. president ever has attempted to do so, though others have criticized prior Fed chairs.

Although lately Trump has eased his criticisms of the Fed building, while continuing to be vocal about Powell hurting the economy by keeping rates too high in his view.</p><p>Trump attempted to fire Fed Governor Lisa Cook in August on alleged mortgage fraud.

Though many economists and investors believe firing Powell before his term ends could cause longer-term interest rates to rise on the notion the Fed would start to act in Trump's interests and not according to its dual mandate from Congress of stable inflation and low unemployment.</p></div></div>"

The company operates entirely within the United States, with assets including printed and digital billboards, transit displays, including airports, street furniture and wallscapes and other spectaculars. </p><p><strong>Stock Market Value</strong>: $755.45 million ($1.52 per share) </p></div><div><h3>Activist: Anson Funds</h3><p><strong>Ownership: </strong>3.65% </p><p><strong>Average Cost: </strong>n/a<strong> </strong></p><p><strong>Activist Commentary: </strong>Anson Funds is a multistrategy fund founded in 2007 by Moez Kassam and has over $2 billion in assets. While not historically activists, on Oct. 3, 2023, Anson hired Sagar Gupta, former senior analyst and head of TMT investing at Legion Partners, to build out their activism strategy. </p><h3>What's happening</h3><p>On Sept. 22, Anson Funds announced that they are calling for a sale of Clear Channel Outdoor Holdings. </p><h3>Behind the scenes</h3><p>Clear Channel Outdoor is one of the largest out-of-home advertising companies that offers a variety of advertising services, including through billboards, street furniture displays, transit displays, and airport displays. In the U.S., they are one of the three big companies in this sector, with <span><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/LAMR/\">Lamar Advertising</a><span><span></span></span></span> and <span><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/OUT/\">Outfront Media</a><span><span></span></span></span> numbers one and two, respectively.</p><p>Historically, the challenges for CCO have centered around the company's two business lines – Americas and Europe, each with very different business models and valuations. The European business worked on fixed limited-term contracts with municipalities, which were re-bided at maturity. Because of this, the European business traded around 8x EBITDA multiple, while the U.S., largely comprised of owned billboards, traded closer 13 – 15x EBITDA.</p><p>These problems prompted Legion Partners to launch an activist campaign at CCO in May 2023, urging the company to consider a broad strategic review process, including divesting non-U.S. assets or a sale of the entire company. Legion also highlighted CCO's potential value proposition through its transition to digital billboards, which would allow each billboard to generate about four times more revenue and six to 10 times more EBITDA. Ultimately, they settled for a board seat for Legion co-founder Ted White, who still serves as a director today. Since then, CCO has executed a series of divestures, including selling its European business to Bauer Media Group, its Latin America business to Global Vía Públic, and, just two weeks ago, its Spain business to Atresmedia. These moves have transformed CCO into a U.S. pureplay and allowed it to start paying down its debt. However, despite this successful activist catalyst, CCO is yet to achieve the rerating some expected - currently, CCO trades at approximately 13-14 times EBITDA, versus peers Lamar and Outfront at 16-18 times. As a result, the stock is down 26.56% since Legion filed its 13D and over 90% from its IPO price.</p><p>On Sept. 22, Anson Funds joined the party, announcing that they are calling for a sale of the company. While this is a new campaign for Anson, this is not the beginning of their investment story. Sagar Gupta, who runs Anson's activism strategy, was at Legion Partners when they launched their campaign, and, perhaps not coincidentally, CCO has appeared in Anson's 13F holdings every quarter since Gupta joined the fund, now with a 3.65% position as of their most recent filing. So, Anson's call for a sale of the company is not a short-term, opportunistic campaign, but a decision made after years of analysis and working amicably with the company and at a time when it has become most feasible.</p><p>The company is now a U.S. pureplay, making it more focused and more valuable from a multiple perspective and easier to acquire from a regulatory perspective. Possible acquirers include <span><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/DEC-FR/\">JCDecaux</a><span><span></span></span></span> and Lamar.</p><p>In fact, JCDecaux terminated an agreement to buy CCO's Spain assets after facing restrictive demands from Spanish regulators. More specifically, JCDecaux maintains major exposure in virtually every OOH market outside the U.S. and has been rumored to be interested in the company.</p><p>As for Lamar, it has a history of acquiring CCO's assets, including a $458.5 million transaction in 2016, and has publicly expressed potential interest in additional transactions. In addition, <span><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/BX/\">Blackstone</a><span><span></span></span></span>'s recent acquisition of New Tradition at 18x EBITDA, <span><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/BRK.B/\">Berkshire Hathaway</a><span><span></span></span></span>'s new position in Lamar, and Ares Management's 8% position in CCO, all underscore the private equity appetite for the OOH industry. </p><p>Before coming to a decision like this, it is important to see what the standalone alternative looks like and why a sale may be more compelling for shareholders. To really properly restructure this business in the public market it would certainly require the time and risk of reconstituting the board and likely many management changes. Even with that, the company would still carry approximately $5 billion of long-term debt making it difficult to attract capital.</p><p>Additionally, CCO's promising digital transformation has been very slow. Since Legion's campaign, digital billboards have only grown to 5% of the portfolio, though they already count for over a third of CCO's revenue. While this underscores the huge value opportunity with digital conversion, it requires approvals of individual municipalities, significantly slowing the speed at which CCO can roll out digital ads, and not ideal for a public company that reports quarterly progress. As a result, after years of analysis and support, Anson has concluded that a sale offers the best risk adjusted path forward, a position we imagine Legion and other shareholders likely share.</p><p><em>Ken Squire is the founder and president of 13D Monitor, an institutional research service on shareholder activism, and the founder and portfolio manager of the 13D Activist Fund, a mutual fund that invests in a portfolio of activist 13D investments.</em></p></div>"

This so-called \"silver tsunami\" poses a major challenge for Asia's fourth-largest economy as the young, working-age population declines and the cost of caring for the elderly escalates. And in remote, rural communities like Gunwi, which lies some 200 kilometers southeast of Seoul, the trend is exacerbated by a youth exodus to the cities for work.</p><p>Ed Jones | Afp | Getty Images</p></div><div><p>South Korea is staring down a demographic freight train. The country, known as one of the \"Four Asian Tigers\" for its meteoric economic rise from postwar poverty, is confronting a demographic cliff that could stall growth within two decades, studies warn.</p><p>The Bank of Korea in 2024 <a href=\"https://www.bok.or.kr/eng/bbs/B0000354/view.do?menuNo=400409&nttId=10090724\" target=\"_blank\">projected</a> that the nation's rock-bottom birth rate will be one of the factors that will push it into a prolonged downturn by the 2040s.</p><p>A <a href=\"https://www.kdi.re.kr/eng/research/analysisView?art_no=3671\" target=\"_blank\">separate study</a> by the Korea Development Institute in May said demographic shifts will keep dragging on potential growth, which could fall to near zero by the 2040s. In its projections, South Korea's economy could contract by 2047 in a neutral scenario — or as early as 2041 in a pessimistic one.</p><p>South Korea's <a href=\"https://kosis.kr/statHtml/statHtml.do?sso=ok&returnurl=https%3A%2F%2Fkosis.kr%3A443%2FstatHtml%2FstatHtml.do%3Fconn_path%3DI3%26tblId%3DDT_1B81A21%26language%3Den%26orgId%3D101%26\" target=\"_blank\">birth rate currently stands at 0.748 in 2024</a>, a slight rise from the record low of 0.721 in 2023. That compares with an Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development average of <a href=\"https://www.oecd.org/en/publications/korea-s-unborn-future_75aa749c-en.html\" target=\"_blank\">1.43 in 2023</a>. The commonly cited \"replacement rate\" for countries to prevent a declining population is 2.1.</p><p>What a 0.72 fertility rate means for South Korea is that for every 100 Koreans, they would have about 36 children at current levels, shrinking the workforce across generations. That would cut into productivity and slow growth, experts say.</p></div><h2><a></a>Miracle for 'miracle on the Han River'?</h2><div><p>If technological innovation fails to offset this decline, Korea will see a \"sustained economic slowdown,\" Lee In-sil, Director of the Korea Peninsula Population Institute for Future, told CNBC.</p><p>And it's not for lack of trying. The country has rolled out package after package of support measures for newlyweds to have children, including baby bonuses and cash rewards. Seoul expended over $270 billion over the past 16 years on incentives to promote childbirth, according to a <a href=\"https://jme.bmj.com/content/51/6/371\" target=\"_blank\">2024 paper in the Journal of Medical Ethics</a>.</p><p>In 2023, Seoul even mooted an idea to <a href=\"https://time.com/6265842/south-korea-birth-rate-military-service-exemption/\" target=\"_blank\">exempt men from its mandatory military service</a> if they had three or more children before the age of 30.</p><p>But such efforts have made little impact in a country hailed as the \"Miracle on the Han River\" for its rapid postwar rise. \"I don't think there's any way that population policy can effectively raise fertility levels in South Korea in any appreciable way,\" Nicholas Eberstadt, a political economist at the American Enterprise Institute, told CNBC.</p></div><div><p>People cycle along a track backdropped with the city skyline in Singapore on June 27, 2025.         </p><p>Roslan Rahman | Afp | Getty Images</p></div><p>While South Korea's total fertility rate had marginally increased in 2024, \"we should not be popping the champagne corks,\" Eberstadt said, as it is still far below the 2.1 replacement rate. He noted that the desired family size in South Korea is still below the 2.1 replacement rate, which means that while the TFR might climb higher, it will not reach the 2.1 figure.</p><h2><a></a>Pension impact</h2><div><p>A shrinking workforce will also squeeze the pension system. In March, South Korea passed its first <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/south-korea-approves-reforms-shore-up-830-bln-state-pension-fund-2025-03-20/\" target=\"_blank\">pension fund reform</a> in 18 years, extending the depletion of the state pension fund by 15 years to 2071.</p><p>Among South Korea's four major pension systems — military, private school employees, civil servants, and national pensions — the military pension and civil servants' pension have already been depleted, Lee said.</p><p>Current reforms will see a structure where younger generations pay higher premiums while receiving lower benefits, which will inevitably lead to criticism for transferring the burden to future generations, she added.</p><p>A smaller draft pool also has defense implications. South Korea's active troops <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/south-koreas-military-has-shrunk-by-20-six-years-male-population-drops-2025-08-10/#:~:text=SEOUL%2C%20Aug%2010%20(Reuters),a%20report%20said%20on%20Sunday.\" target=\"_blank\">have fallen 20%</a> to about 450,000, down from 690,000 in 2019. South Korean armed forces are augmented by 28,500 U.S. troops, and Seoul has a mutual defense treaty with Washington.</p><p>South Korea is still formally at war with North Korea, as the Korean War in 1953 ended with a ceasefire, not a peace treaty. North Korea boasts one of the largest standing military forces in the world, with around 1.23 million personnel.</p></div><h2><a></a>No reason to be pessimistic</h2><div><p>Despite the bleak outlook for Asia's fourth-largest economy, some analysts caution against despair.</p><p>Lee, who was also the former director general of the national statistics agency, said economies can find ways to adapt.</p><p>\"When an economy faces recession, it typically responds with various efforts to enhance productivity through technological innovation, immigration policies, and other measures to prevent further decline,\" she said.</p><p>AEI's Eberstadt also noted that South Korea can maintain and even increase its prosperity despite aging and shrinking. He pointed to the 1970s, when fears of resource scarcity grew as the world's population surged and doubts arose about how to feed it.</p><p>In 1968, the book The Population Bomb, co-authored by former Stanford University professor Paul Ehrlich and researcher Anne Ehrlich, predicted global famine and a rising death rate as the population grew.</p><p>However, 50 years later, the world is \"richer, better educated, better fed, better housed, more prosperous, much less absolute poverty, than when the world was smaller,\" Eberstadt said.</p><p>KPPIF's Lee said that, considering the Korean government's rapid policy changes and evolving public awareness in recent years, she is confident that breakthrough solutions will emerge.</p><p>Very few people would have bet that South Korea could accomplish what it has today when the Korean War halted in 1953, Eberstadt said<strong>.</strong></p><p>\"Human beings are a uniquely adaptable,\" he added. \"This is a very different sort of challenge, but I don't think that the record of the immediate past suggests that it's smart money to bet against South Korean population.\"</p></div></div>"

Differing from generative AI, agents act independently, can initiate actions, and recall previous work they performed.

They could also be lost time, which relates to money. It could also be a lot of things that you have to undo, which is costly from a financial standpoint. It burns people out to have to do it. It's all of the costs associated with poor implementation,\" Hoffman said.</p><p>The report outlined that the debt could manifest as security risks, poor data quality, low impact AI agents which will waste time and resources for human employees, and a management skills gap.</p><p>Hoffman said this is not an exhaustive list and the \"debt\" could look like a bunch of code created by AI that doesn't work right or AI-generated content that nobody is using.</p><p>New research from BetterUp Labs and Stanford Social Media Lab even found that 40% of desk workers in the U.S. have received <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2025/09/23/ai-generated-workslop-is-destroying-productivity-and-teams-researchers-say.html\">AI-generated \"workslop,\"</a> which the researchers defined as content that looks good but lacks any substance.</p></div><div><p><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2025/09/23/ai-generated-workslop-is-destroying-productivity-and-teams-researchers-say.html\"><img src=\"https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/108202475-1758579102271-gettyimages-700712909-bld240699.jpeg?v=1758579133&w=160&h=90\" /></a></p></div><div><p>It's created almost two hours of extra work for people who encountered it, a $186 invisible tax per month, and a $9 million hit to productivity in a year, per the research.</p><p>\"There's large investment going into this space right now, and ultimately it's a question of whether those investments will pay off,\" Hoffman said.</p><p>Henry Ajder, founder of AI consulting firm Latent Space Advisory, and an advisor to the U.K. government, Meta, and AI video startup Synthesia, emphasized the need for thoughtful implementation and structures.</p><p>\"People who are CTOs or innovation officers, the good ones I've worked with, the ones who I think I did the best position to succeed with it, they aren't sugar coating the disruption that this is going to cost ... as with any kind of fundamental rework, you are going to have problems, you're gonna have bumps in the road,\" Ajder said in an interview.</p></div><h2><a></a>'It's not a magical silver bullet'</h2><div><p>Asana's report found that despite AI adoption surging to 70% in 2025 from 52% in 2024, workers are also facing higher levels of digital burnout.</p><p>Digital exhaustion increased to 84% in 2025 from 75% the prior year, while unmanageable workloads also rose to 77%, per the report.</p><p>Mona Mourshed, founding global CEO of Generation, a U.S.-based employment organization, told CNBC that despite companies rolling out AI tools and encouraging the use of it, workers are still struggling.</p><p>\"The core reason that they're struggling, and we know this from also talking to our own alumni, is that the use case for how and why are you supposed to use this AI tool in the flow of your work is often missing,\" Mourshed said.</p><p>\"Without a clear understanding of what is the use case that's going to make this particular task better, faster, cheaper ... that's what leads to the exhaustion, because you don't know what the intended outcome is,\" she added.</p><p>Mourshed noted that companies are investing in AI in the hopes that overnight work will be performed better, faster and cheaper, but they aren't offering the necessary training or guidelines to enable improvements.</p><p>\"It's not a magical silver bullet, and all of a sudden it does everything you want once you install it ... it's going to be a much more painful journey to get to those benefits than companies that have thought it through.\"</p><p>AI expert Ajder said the correct strategy is carefully testing AI use and building infrastructure around it rather than rushing into the race unprepared.</p><p>\"You don't start by just embedding, you start by piloting, you start by scoping, by sandboxing, by trialing these systems,\" he said.</p><p>This includes everything from the correct training for employees, to thinking about the kind of AI models the business might need. It's much harder to respond to mistakes or malfunctions when there's no procedure in place.</p><p>\"So I'm not saying that you can't take risk thoughtfully when it comes to using AI, but it has to be calculated and it has to be scoped,\" Ajder said.</p></div></div>"

While Swig claims credit — and the trademark — for dirty soda, TikTok videos and the reality TV show \"The Secret Lives of Mormon Wives\" have helped the trend spread far and wide, outpacing even the soda chain's speedy expansion.</p><p>Now, consumers can find it nearly everywhere, from grocery store aisles to fast-food chains.</p><p>In a few weeks, Pepsi plans to unveil two ready-to-drink dirty soda-inspired beverages at the National Association of Convenience Stores trade show in Chicago. The new drinks, the Dirty Dew and the Mug Floats Vanilla Howler, follow on the heels of the Pepsi Wild Cherry & Cream flavor, which hit shelves earlier this year.</p><p>\"I think it's a great opportunity for people like us, like PepsiCo, and for consumers to experience soda in a new way — and in some ways, an old way,\" Pepsi Beverages North America Chief Marketing Officer Mark Kirkham told CNBC, comparing the rise of dirty soda to root beer floats and the soda shops of yore.</p></div><div><p>PepsiCo's lineup of dirty soda-inspired drinks includes Pepsi Wild Cherry & Cream, Dirty Mountain Dew and Mug Floats Vanilla Howler.</p><p>Source: PepsiCo</p></div><div><p>Dirty soda has also drawn new interest beyond beverage players. According to Datassential, 2.7% of U.S. eateries offer a carbonated soft drink that includes cream or milk, up from 1.5% a decade ago.</p><p>Newcomers to the trend include TGI Fridays, which launched dirty soda as a limited-time menu item this summer that could be spiked with alcohol. McDonald's is <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2025/07/24/mcdonalds-tests-cosmcs-drinks.html\">testing flavored sodas</a>, like a \"Sprite Lunar Splash,\" at more than 500 locations after winding down its drinks-focused spinoff CosMc's in June. <span><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/YUM/\">Yum Brands'</a><span><span></span></span></span> Taco Bell has also been offering limited-time menu items, like a dirty Mountain Dew Baja Blast.</p></div><h2><a></a>Swig sets a trend</h2><div><p>These days, Swig has grown to more than 140 locations across 16 states. So far this year, its same-store sales have risen 8.2%, according to the privately held company. The Larry H. Miller Company, an investment firm founded by the former Utah Jazz owner, bought a majority stake in Swig in 2022 for an undisclosed sum.</p><p>\"I think we're doing for soda what Starbucks did for coffee,\" Swig CEO Alex Dunn said.</p><p>As Swig has grown, so have the number of chains looking to emulate its success. Rival soda shops like Sodalicious, Fiiz and Cool Sips are also benefiting from the trend. Coffee shops, like <span><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/BROS/\">Dutch Bros.</a><span><span></span></span></span>, have also added it to their menus. And now fast-food chains are hopping on the bandwagon.</p><p>\"It validates that this is a category, and McDonald's and Taco Bell wouldn't be getting into it if it wasn't something that had broad appeal that they could sell everywhere, in thousands of locations,\" Dunn said. \"It's kind of flattering that we created a category that now everybody is copying.\"</p><p>For restaurants, adding dirty soda to the menu is easier than it might sound.</p><p>\"It's a custom drink offering that, one, allows the brands to leverage something that they already have right there: their soda machine,\" said Erica Holland-Toll, culinary director at The Culinary Edge, which advises restaurants on food and beverage innovation. \"Two, it incorporates either a one-touch ingredient, or if they're already open for breakfast, it's quite likely that they've got a creamer in house.\"</p><p>On the other hand, offering customizable coffee drinks is usually much more difficult — which has contributed to the struggles at Starbucks.</p><p>\"The espresso world — that's so much more complicated,\" Holland-Toll said.</p><p>Dirty soda also has wide appeal. With less caffeine than coffee, consumers can drink it all day long. Plus, it's \"much more accessible\" than some coffee house trends, like an espresso tonic, according to Holland-Toll. The bright colors of many dirty sodas also make them more attractive to consumers, who were likely introduced to the trend via a TikTok video.</p><p>But perhaps above all, dirty soda can help restaurants draw in customers who are otherwise feeling thrifty.</p><p>\"It's an affordable fun treat. You're not going out and spending $30 or $50, right?\" said Sally Lyons Watt, chief advisor of consumer goods and foodservice insights for Circana. \"It's something that people can walk away saying, 'Wow, that was yummy' or 'I feel better because I just had that.'\"</p></div><h2><a></a>A pop for beverage companies</h2><div><p>Swig drinks.</p><p>Courtesy: Swig</p></div><div><p>A \"fun treat\" for consumers is adding up for beverage companies, helping reverse the decades-long trend of declining soda consumption in the U.S.</p><p>As health concerns mount and the array of beverage options expands, Americans have been drinking less soda for roughly two decades. In 2004, soda consumption peaked at 15.3 billion gallons, according to Beverage Marketing; by 2024, that figure had slid to 11.87 billion gallons. But consumption of carbonated soft drinks has been ticking up in the last two years, with 2025 estimated to reach 11.88 billion gallons. The rise of dirty soda, plus the growing popularity of prebiotic sodas, has likely helped the segment halt its downward trajectory.</p></div><div><p>Over the years, iced coffee has been stealing what the beverage industry calls \"share of throat\" from soda. With dirty soda, consumers can marry their love of customizing a cold drink with the lower caffeine content and taste of soda.</p><p>\"The carbonation makes it feel lighter in your mouth than coffee, for example,\" Holland-Toll said.</p><p>Dirty soda has also been attracting younger consumers who previously didn't drink much Pepsi or Dr Pepper. Swig's core customer base is young women between the ages of 18 and 35, according to Dunn.</p><p>That's true for Holly Galvin, a 31-year-old human resources professional based in Davenport, Iowa. She told CNBC that she rarely drank soda — until she saw dirty soda take the spotlight in the \"The Secret Lives of Mormon Wives\" last year. Now she makes her own dirty soda once or twice a week at home. With the onset of autumn, her go-to recipe these days uses Diet Dr Pepper as a base, with pumpkin spice creamer and a sprinkle of pumpkin pie spice on top.</p><p>Broadly, younger consumers are more inclined to seek out new drinks compared with older cohorts. Nearly three-quarters of Generation Z try a new beverage every month on average, according to Keurig Dr Pepper's 2025 trend report.</p><p>Beverage companies say that they are seeing a broader halo effect for soda as a result of the trend.</p><p>\"For us, it serves as a recruitment tool, bringing new users into the trademark,\" said Katie Webb, vice president of innovation and transformation for <span><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/KDP/\">Keurig Dr Pepper</a><span><span></span></span></span>. \"It really draws them all the way back to the base brand, which ends up being extremely impact for us long after.\"</p><p>And just as craft cocktail culture led to the rise of canned cocktails, the popularity of dirty soda is leading beverage giants to cash in with ready-to-drink versions that capitalize on the trend. Dr Pepper Creamy Coconut was the company's most successful limited-time carbonated soft drink to date, based on retail dollar sales, according to Webb. And Kirkham said Pepsi Wild Cherry & Cream has been one of the fastest-growing flavor segments for the company.</p><p>\"Some trends start retail and move over to foodservice,\" Circana's Lyons Wyatt said. \"This one was a foodservice trend moving into retail.\"</p><p>With Pepsi Wild Cherry & Cream and next year's launch of Dirty Dew and the Mug Floats Vanilla Howler, Kirkham expects that consumers will become even more creative with their concoctions.</p><p>\"I think it's actually giving [consumers] the chance to experiment even more and customize more,\" he said. \"Now you have a brand new base.\"</p></div></div>"

We take seriously our responsibility as local broadcasters to provide programming that serves the interests of our communities, while also honoring our obligations to air national network programming,\" Sinclair said in a statement on Friday.</p><p>\"Over the last week, we have received thoughtful feedback from viewers, advertisers, and community leaders representing a wide range of perspectives,\" Sinclair said. \"We have also witnessed troubling acts of violence, including the despicable incident of a shooting at an ABC affiliate station in Sacramento. These events underscore why responsible broadcasting matters and why respectful dialogue between differing voices remains so important.\"</p><p>The broadcast station owners said earlier this week they would continue to <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2025/09/23/kimmel-abc-nexstar-sinclair-fcc.html\">preempt</a> Kimmel's late night show, meaning it would be unavailable on local stations for roughly 20% of the country, while they <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2025/09/24/jimmy-kimmel-live-nexstar-show-status-abc-stations.html\">evaluated</a> the situation and continued discussions with Disney.</p><p>Sinclair owns roughly 40 ABC affiliate stations in the U.S., including one in in Washington, D.C. Nexstar owns about 30 in markets including Salt Lake City and New Orleans.</p><p>Kimmel <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2025/09/23/jimmy-kimmel-returns-abc-disney-kirk.html\">addressed</a> the situation — and the ongoing preemptions — during his returning show this week.</p><p>\"We are still on the air in most of the country, except, ironically, from Washington, D.C., where we have been preempted,\" Kimmel said during Tuesday's monologue. \"After almost 23 years on the air, we're suddenly not being broadcast in 20% of the country, which is not a situation we relish.\"</p><p>Sinclair said Friday it had proposed measures to \"strengthen accountability, viewer feedback, and community dialogue\" at ABC and its affiliates.</p><p>\"While ABC and Disney have not yet adopted these measures, and Sinclair respects their right to make those decisions under our network affiliate agreements, we believe such measures could strengthen trust and accountability,\" it said.</p><p>Nexstar said in a statement: \"We have had discussions with executives at The Walt Disney Company and appreciate their constructive approach to addressing our concerns.\"</p><p>Disney declined to comment Friday.</p><p>Kimmel's suspension last week came shortly after Nexstar announced it would not air the program in light of the host's comments. Sinclair soon after said it would likewise preempt the program.</p><p>Those announcements followed comments from Federal Communications Commission Chairman Brendan Carr that <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2025/09/18/jimmy-kimmel-charlie-kirk-fcc-carr.html\">suggested</a> ABC affiliate stations could be at <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2025/09/19/trump-threatening-broadcast-station-licenses-explained.html\">risk of losing</a> broadcast station licenses over Kimmel's remarks, which came during a show monologue.</p><p>The series of events raised questions about influence by the Trump administration on the media and First Amendment protections.</p><p>\"Our decision to preempt this program was independent of any government interaction or influence,\" Sinclair said Friday. \"Free speech provides broadcasters with the right to exercise judgment as to the content on their local stations. While we understand that not everyone will agree with our decisions about programming, it is simply inconsistent to champion free speech while demanding that broadcasters air specific content.\"</p><p>Earlier this week, Sen. Maria Cantwell, D-Wash., <a href=\"https://www.cantwell.senate.gov/news/press-releases/cantwell-calls-on-sinclair-broadcasting-to-quit-blocking-publics-ability-to-watch-jimmy-kimmel-live\" target=\"_blank\">sent a letter</a> to Sinclair pushing to bring \"Jimmy Kimmel Live!\" back on air. Sinclair owns the Seattle ABC affiliate station.</p><p>Nexstar similarly denied any government influence. </p><p>\"As a local broadcaster, Nexstar remains committed to protecting the First Amendment while producing and airing local and national news that is fact-based and unbiased and, above all, broadcasting content that is in the best interest of the communities we serve,\" Nexstar said in a statement. </p><p>\"We stand apart from cable television, monolithic streaming services, and national networks in our commitment – and obligation – to be stewards of the public airwaves and to protect and reflect the specific sensibilities of our communities,\" the statement continued. \"To be clear, our commitment to those principles has guided our decisions throughout this process, independent of any external influence from government agencies or individuals.\"</p></div>"

They were rebuked for the move.</p><p>In a statement on Friday, the committee said that the batch included 8,544 documents in response to a subpoena in August, and that, \"Further review of the documents, which were redacted to protect the identity of victims, is ongoing.\" </p><p>The latest batch of documents received by the committee from the Justice Department contained itineraries and notes by Epstein memorializing invitations he'd sent, trips he'd planned and meetings he'd booked with tech and business leaders.</p></div><div><p>Demonstrators gather for a press conference calling for the release of the Jeffrey Epstein files outside the United States Captiol on Wednesday September 03, 2025 in Washington, DC. </p><p>The Washington Post | The Washington Post | Getty Images</p></div><div><p>One of the itineraries indicated that Epstein expected Musk to make a trip to his private island in the U.S. Virgin Islands on Dec. 6, 2014, but then asked \"is this still happening?\"</p><p>Musk told Vanity Fair in 2019 that he had visited Epstein's New York City mansion and that Epstein \"tried repeatedly to get me to visit his island,\" but the <span><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/TSLA/\">Tesla</a><span><span></span></span></span> CEO had declined.</p><p>In June, Musk wrote in a post on X, that he thought Trump and his administration were withholding Epstein-related files from the public view in order to protect the president's reputation.</p><p>\"Time to drop the really big bomb: @realDonaldTrump is in the Epstein files,\" Musk, who was in the midst of a public spat with the president, wrote at the time. \"That is the real reason they have not been made public. Have a nice day, DJT!\"</p><p>Trump was mentioned in previously released court documents from the Epstein case, but has not been formally accused of wrongdoing.</p><p>Musk started the year leading the Trump administration's Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), an effort to slash the size of the federal government and reduce the power of various regulatory agencies. He left DOGE in May, and he and the president proceeded to hurl insults at each other in public over a number of disagreements.</p><p>However, Trump and Musk remain close enough that they <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjWBqycptv0\" target=\"_blank\">sat together</a> at a memorial service for Charlie Kirk earlier this month after the right-wing activist was assassinated while speaking at a university in Utah.</p><p>The partially redacted files also indicated Epstein had breakfast with Bannon on Feb. 16, 2019, and lunch with investor Peter Thiel on Nov. 27, 2017.

But regardless of the political dividends, a shutdown will have a major impact on a wide array of services and programs.</p><p>And it could lead to unprecedented actions by the Trump administration, which has made shrinking the government a top priority.</p></div><h2><a></a>What is a government shutdown?</h2><div><p>Congress has to pass a series of 12 appropriations bills by Tuesday to finance government entities for the next fiscal year. But it has not passed any of the 12 bills ahead of that deadline.</p><p>If it cannot pass a short-term funding measure known as a \"continuing resolution,\" the government will shut down.</p><p>There have been <a href=\"https://bipartisanpolicy.org/explainer/what-happens-if-the-government-shuts-down/\" target=\"_blank\">14 such shutdowns</a> since 1980, according to the Bipartisan Policy Center.</p><p>If Congress can only pass some, but not all, of the annual appropriations bills in time, the government will experience a partial shutdown. </p><p>That happened in late 2018 — during Trump's first presidential term — when the government partially shut down for a record <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2019/01/25/senate-votes-to-reopen-government-and-end-shutdown-without-border-wall.html\">five weeks</a> amid disputes about the funding for Trump's U.S.-Mexico border wall.</p></div><h2><a></a>How will federal employees be affected?</h2><div><p>Non-essential government employees may be furloughed during a shutdown, meaning they are forced to take an unpaid leave of absence.</p><p>During the last full government shutdown in 2013, about 850,000 employees were furloughed, according to the <a href=\"https://www.crfb.org/papers/government-shutdowns-qa-everything-you-should-know\" target=\"_blank\">Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget.</a></p><p>There are more than two million civilian federal workers in the U.S.</p><p>While furloughed employees are guaranteed back pay once they return to work, federal contractors have historically not received back pay, according to CRFB.</p></div><h2><a></a>What services and agencies will be affected?</h2><div><p>A shutdown will directly affect non-essential government programs and services that rely on the spending that must be appropriated every year, known as discretionary spending.</p><p>In past shutdowns, that has led to the closures of hundreds of national parks and museums, the curtailment of veterans' services, suspension of health inspections, the postponement of immigration hearings and many other impacts.</p><p>Discretionary spending accounts for 27% of the fiscal 2024 budget, according to the <a href=\"https://www.pgpf.org/article/chart-pack-the-us-budget/\" target=\"_blank\">Peter G. Peterson Foundation</a>.</p><p>Services and programs deemed essential would continue to operate, but they may be indirectly affected. And some federal employees are classified as \"excepted,\" meaning they are still required to work during a shutdown.</p><p>Examples of essential services include those that are related to national security, law enforcement, air traffic control, and prison inmate control.</p><p>Programs funded through \"mandatory\" spending — which is authorized either permanently or for multiple years — would broadly continue, though they can still feel the effects of a shutdown.</p><p>In a 1996 shutdown, Social Security checks were still sent out. But Social Security Administration staff who handled new enrollments to the program and other services were <a href=\"https://www.crfb.org/papers/government-shutdowns-qa-everything-you-should-know#mandatoryprograms\" target=\"_blank\">initially furloughed</a>.</p></div><h2><a></a>What about economic reports?</h2><div><p>A shutdown could delay the release of key economic reports that the government regularly publishes, which are closely watched by financial markets.</p><p>If no deal is reached, the government will shut down just days before the Bureau of Labor Statistics is set to issue its monthly jobs report for September.</p><p>Wells Fargo economist Michael Pugliese <a href=\"https://wellsfargo.bluematrix.com/docs/html/70538749-ecdc-4d9c-90fb-7acc607da311.html\" target=\"_blank\">noted this week</a> that after the last full government shutdown in 2013, the monthly jobs and consumer price index reports \"were delayed by about two weeks.\"</p><p>\"Collection, processing and publication delays stretched into the following month as well,\" Pugliese noted.</p><p>The next BLS employment report is set to be released on Oct. 3. The BLS's Consumer Price Index reading for September is scheduled to be released on Oct. 15.</p><p>In the partial shutdown that began in late 2018, Pugliese noted, \"the first look at\" gross domestic product growth for the fourth quarter of that year \"was delayed about a month, as was December 2018 data on retail sales and personal income & spending.\"</p><p>— <em>CNBC's </em><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/emily-wilkins/\"><em>Emily Wilkins</em></a><em> contributed to this story.</em></p></div></div>"
