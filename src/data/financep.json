That's below the consensus forecast of 75,000 from economists polled by Dow Jones and marks a significant slowdown from the revised gain of 106,000 seen in the prior month.</p><p>\"The year started with strong job growth, but that momentum has been whipsawed by uncertainty,\" said Nela Richardson, ADP's chief economist, in a press release.</p><p>Richardson pointed to rising worries from consumers, labor shortages and disruptions tied to artificial intelligence as potential drivers of this decrease in growth.</p><p>Jobs tied to trade, transportation and utilities saw particular weakness in August, with the group losing 17,000 roles on net, according to the ADP. Education and health services followed, recording a decline of 12,000 jobs.</p><p>But those losses were offset in part by a boom in the leisure and hospitality industry, which added 50,000 jobs in the month.</p><p>Wage growth maintained the same pace in August. Those staying in their roles saw their pay rise 4.4% year-over-year, while job changes recorded a 7.1% increase over the same period.</p><p>Thursday's ADP report adds to an already concerning picture of the labor market.</p><p>Jobless claims increased to 237,000, up 8,000 from the prior week and above estimates, per data also published Thursday morning. The Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey registered <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2025/09/03/job-opening-data-falls-to-levels-rarely-seen-since-pandemic.html\">one of its worst levels</a> for job openings in July since 2020, according to government figures released Wednesday.</p><p>Now, attention will home in on the all-important jobs report slated for Friday morning. Economists expect the official government report to show 75,000 non-farm payrolls added in August, about even with the prior month, according to estimates collected by Dow Jones. Economists predict the unemployment rate inched up to 4.3% from 4.2%.</p><p>Labor market worries have pushed traders to build on already hefty bets that the Federal Reserve will cut rates at its meeting later this month. There's now a <a href=\"https://www.cmegroup.com/markets/interest-rates/cme-fedwatch-tool.html\" target=\"_blank\">97.4% chance</a> of a rate cut at the September gathering, up from 96.6% a day ago, according to the CME's FedWatch tool.</p><p><em>— CNBC's John Melloy contributed reporting.</em></p></div></div>"

The fully permitted project is 80% complete and would provide enough power for more than 350,000 homes across both states.</p><p>Orsted asked the United States District Court for the District of Columbia to set aside the stop-work order, calling it \"unlawful\" and \"issued in bad faith.\"</p><p>Orsted <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2025/08/25/orsted-shares-tumble-as-us-halts-wind-project-construction.html\">shares hit a record low</a> on Aug. 25 in the wake of the stop-work order.</p><p>The Bureau of Ocean Energy Management has justified the order on <a href=\"https://www.boem.gov/sites/default/files/documents/renewable-energy/Director%26%23039%3BsOrder-20250822.pdf?VersionId=Y674sNo8zi7jLu3VWRvq2hFb_8KtMldc\" target=\"_blank\">national security grounds</a> and concerns that Revolution Wind will interfere with other uses of U.S. territorial waters.

Federal agencies have uniformily concluded based on thousands of pages of data that the project is \"environmentally sound, safe and consistent with federal law,\" the company said.</p><p>Trump has targeted the wind industry since his first day in office, when he issued an order that closed federal waters to new leases for offshore projects. But the renewable industry had hoped that the White House would allow permitted projects such as Revolution Wind to proceed.</p><p>Trump has escalated his attacks on the renewable energy industry in recent weeks. The president said his administration <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2025/08/20/trump-says-us-will-not-approve-solar-or-wind-power-projects.html\">would not approve solar and wind projects</a> two days before Revolution Wind was hit with the stop-work order.</p><p>And the Trump administration on Friday canceled <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2025/08/29/trump-administration-cancels-679-million-for-offshore-wind-projects.html\">$679 million in funding</a> for a dozen infrastructure projects that support the offshore wind industry.</p></div></div>"

    "body": "<div><p>An American Eagle advertisement featuring actress Sydney Sweeney on billboards in New York, US, on Monday, Aug. 4, 2025. </p><p>Michael Nagle | Bloomberg | Getty Images</p></div><div><p><span><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/AEO/\">American Eagle</a><span><span></span></span></span> said Wednesday its <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2025/08/04/american-eagle-aeo-stock-sydney-sweeney-trump.html\">partnership with Sydney Sweeney</a> has been its \"best\" advertising campaign to date as it announced fiscal second-quarter earnings that beat expectations. </p><p>The company's splashy, <a href=\"https://investors.ae.com/press-releases/news-details/2025/Sydney-Sweeney-Has-Great-American-Eagle-Jeans/default.aspx\" target=\"_blank\">yet controversial</a>, campaign with the \"Euphoria\" star led to some criticism and blowback but the launch, coupled with a recent partnership with Taylor Swift's new fiancé <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2025/08/27/american-eagle-aeo-travis-kelce.html\">Travis Kelce,</a> has led to new customer acquisition and positive traffic across channels. </p><p>American Eagle stock soared more than 20% in after-hours trading Wednesday.</p><p>\"The fall season is off to a positive start. Fueled by stronger product offerings and the success of recent marketing campaigns with Sydney Sweeney and Travis Kelce, we have seen an uptick in customer awareness, engagement and comparable sales,\" CEO Jay Schottenstein said in a news release. \"We look forward to building on our progress and the continued strength of our iconic brands to drive higher profitability, long-term growth and shareholder value.\" </p><p>The company also re-issued its full-year guidance after <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2025/05/13/american-eagle-withdraws-2025-guidance-says-q1-worse-than-expected.html\">withdrawing it earlier this year</a>. It now expects comparable sales to be approximately flat, better than the 0.2% decline analysts had anticipated, according to StreetAccount. </p><p>It still expects gross margin to be down for the duration of the year, but it made key changes to its outlook for operating income, which is bearing the brunt of the tariff impact. The company is now expecting its full-year operating income to be between $255 million and $265 million, down from a previous range of between $360 million and $375 million. </p><p>Here's how American Eagle performed during the quarter compared with what Wall Street was anticipating, based on a survey of analysts by LSEG:</p><ul><li><strong>Earnings per share:</strong> 45 cents vs. 21 cents expected</li><li><strong>Revenue:</strong> $1.28 billion vs. $1.24 billion expected</li></ul><p>The company's reported net income for the three-month period that ended Aug. 2 was $77.6 million, or 45 cents per share, compared with $77.3 million, or 39 cents per share, a year earlier. </p><p>Sales fell to $1.28 billion, down slightly from $1.29 billion a year earlier. </p><p>For the current quarter, American Eagle is expecting comparable sales to be up in the low single digit range, better than the 0.9% uptick analysts had expected, according to StreetAccount. It's expecting the same trend during the fourth quarter. </p><p>So far this year, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2025/05/29/american-eagle-outfitters-aeo-earnings-q1-2025.html\">American Eagle's performance</a> has been marred by merchandising missteps, tariffs and an uncertain consumer that's being more selective when spending money on products like clothes and shoes. </p><p>To turn things around, American Eagle launched its campaign with Sweeney ahead of the crucial back-to-school shopping season, but in some ways, that also backfired when it incited outrage from some customers. </p><p>The slogan American Eagle chose for the campaign — \"Sydney Sweeney has great jeans\" — led some far-left critics to say the remark was a double entendre and a nod to eugenics. Meanwhile, those on the right celebrated the campaign, leading President <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/donald-trump/\">Donald Trump</a> to weigh in and call it the \"hottest\" ad around.</p><p>More widely, the campaign also faced pushback from some who said the ads were overly sexualized and out of touch, leading them to wonder what type of consumer the company was targeting. </p><p>The campaign launched on July 23 at the tail end of American Eagle's fiscal second quarter, but the company said it's so far been a success, despite the pushback it received. The Sweeney campaign, along with the partnership it launched with Kelce, has led to \"meaningful improvement in the business\" with comps so far this quarter up in the mid-single digits. American Eagle said it's gained 700,000 new customers and that traffic across channels has been \"consistently positive\" throughout August, despite some news reports indicating the contrary. </p><p>The Sweeney campaign has led to denim sellouts, double-digit traffic growth and increased awareness and engagement, the company said. The Sydney Jacket sold out in one day and The Sydney Jean, a custom style that donated 100% of proceeds to the Crisis Text Line, which provides mental health support, sold out in one day. </p><p>Meanwhile, American Eagle's launch with Kelce, the Kansas City Chiefs tight end, the day after he announced his <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2025/08/26/taylor-swift-is-engaged-to-nfl-star-travis-kelce.html\">engagement to the pop star</a>, drove three times more sales in one day than past collaborations did in a week, the company said. Many of the items, specifically ones worn by Kelce and his fellow athletes, sold out.</p><p>American Eagle's partnerships with Sweeney and Kelce highlight the work the retailer is doing to stay relevant with consumers and cut through the noise as spending remains soft. </p><p>It's also facing stiff competition from peers like <span><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/ANF/\">Abercrombie &amp; Fitch</a><span><span></span></span></span>, <span><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/GAP/\">Gap</a><span><span></span></span></span> and <span><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/LEVI/\">Levi's</a><span><span></span></span></span>. Recently, Gap launched its <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2025/08/28/gap-gap-q2-2025-earnings.html\">\"Better in Denim\" campaign</a> featuring Katseye and Kelis's 2003 hit \"Milkshake.\" Meanwhile, Levi's has had an ongoing campaign featuring <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2024/10/02/levi-strauss-ceo-says-beyonc-ads-could-help-boost-growth-in-womens-category.html\">Beyoncé</a> while Abercrombie has taken a sports focus and partnered with the NFL. </p><p>Compounding American Eagle's challenges is the uncertain <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2025/08/30/trump-trade-tariffs-appeals.html\">tariff environment</a>. American Eagle has been working to reduce its reliance on China to under 10% this year but it also has a heavy manufacturing presence in Vietnam and India, which have been the subject of reciprocal tariffs.</p></div>"

    "body": "<div><div><p>Artificial intelligence technology concept with text AI on electronic circuit board. </p><p>Teera Konakan | Moment | Getty Images</p></div><div><p>While there's <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2025/06/17/ai-godfather-geoffrey-hinton-theres-a-chance-that-ai-could-displace-humans.html\">mounting concerns</a> that artificial intelligence is replacing jobs, it's not all bad news for the labor market, particularly for workers with AI skills.</p><p>Rather than replacing roles with AI, many companies are hiring workers who can leverage artificial intelligence, <a href=\"https://lightcast.io/resources/research/beyond-the-buzz-developing-the-ai-skills-employers-actually-need\" target=\"_blank\">a new study published in July found</a>.</p><p>In an analysis of over a billion job postings, labor insight platform LightCast identified not only a surge in demand for AI skills, but also higher average pay for jobs that required them. </p><p>\"Job postings are increasingly emphasizing AI skills and there are signals that employers are willing to pay premium salaries for them,\" Elena Magrini, head of global research at LightCast, told CNBC. </p><p>Job postings that mentioned at least one AI skill advertised salaries 28% higher on average than those that listed none, representing roughly $18,000 more per year. For those with at least two AI skills, the premium was 43% higher. </p><p>The study also noted three fields with the largest premium: customer and client support, sales, and manufacturing and production.</p><p>Joshua Woo, founder of Recruit Fast, an employment agency in Singapore, made a similar observation that \"AI skills are paying above average in this market.\"</p><p>He added that they are no longer just nice to have, \"they're a differentiator.\"</p></div><h2><a></a>More accessible</h2><div><p>LightCast's report identified over 300 AI skills ranging from AI ethics and generative AI to machine learning. </p><p>The study also found that different career areas required fundamentally different AI skills. For example, roles in transportation were likely to require autonomous driving skills, while maintenance positions prioritized robotics capabilities. </p><p>Though many of the AI skills required high technical expertise, the most commonly-listed ones were often quite general, such as proficiency in the use of ChatGPT or Microsoft Copilot. </p><p>These basic skills are becoming more prevalent and accessible in the job market, according to Bridget Wong, head of human relations at Accenture Singapore. </p><p>\"While positions like decision scientist or LLM/data architect demand deep technical expertise, many operational and junior employees are also being equipped to work effectively with AI-enabled processes,\" Wong said.</p><p>Thus, \"there is no wrong stage in a career to learn AI—opportunities exist at every level, and organizations should invest in training and exposure to empower employees,\" she added. </p></div><h2><a></a>Demand in non-tech roles</h2><div><p>Notably, LightCast's study found that demand for AI skills was higher in non-tech sectors than in IT and computer science, which are normally associated with AI.</p><p>Since 2022, the year OpenAI launched ChatGPT, job postings mentioning generative AI skills were up 800% for non-tech roles, LightCast's study found.</p><p>While IT and computer science still reigned the list of sectors demanding AI skills, marketing and public relations came in second place. This was followed by science &amp; research, and social analysis and planning.</p><p>\"It's not just software developers or the data scientists that are benefiting from AI skills; It's something people in everything from marketing to finance to HR should be thinking about,\" Magrini said.</p></div><h2><a></a>'Be prepared'</h2><div><p>AI skills \"are coming to every job function, to every career area, but at different paces,\" which means everybody needs a layer of AI literacy, Magrini said.</p><p>Recruit Fast's Woo noted that AI skills are likely less relevant as prerequisites in blue-collar jobs as compared to other fields.</p><p>Still, Magrini said that \"AI is coming, but we don't need to be scared. We need to be prepared.\"</p><p><em><strong>Want to stand out, grow your network, and get more job opportunities?</strong> Sign up for Smarter by CNBC Make It's new online course, </em><a href=\"https://smarter.cnbcmakeit.com/p/how-to-build-a-personal-brand?utm_source=cnbc&amp;utm_medium=makeitarticle&amp;utm_campaign=bottom\" target=\"_blank\"><em>How to Build a Standout Personal Brand: Online, In Person, and At Work</em></a><em>.

    "body": "<div><div><p>The Nasdaq Marketsite is seen during morning trading on April 7, 2025 in New York City. </p><p>Michael M. Santiago | Getty Images</p></div><div><p>BEIJING — The Nasdaq stock exchange in the U.S. is planning listing requirements that will make it harder for small Chinese companies to list in New York, after a flood of tiny initial public offerings.</p><p>As part of proposed changes, companies operating primarily in China will <a href=\"https://ir.nasdaq.com/news-releases/news-release-details/nasdaq-proposes-changes-its-listing-standards\" target=\"_blank\">need to raise at least $25 million</a> in initial public offerings to list on the exchange, Nasdaq said late Wednesday local time.</p><p>The move comes as tensions between the U.S. and China simmer, and as the Nasdaq faces broader financial market issues.</p><p>\"It will be more difficult for small Chinese companies to go IPO [on the] Nasdaq under the new rule,\" said Winston Ma, adjunct professor at NYU School of Law. \"The new rule reacts to some IPO cases of 'pump and dump' due to small float size.\"</p><p>There have been been few large Chinese IPOs in the U.S. since the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2025/07/16/cnbcs-the-china-connection-newsletter-from-didi-to-deepseek.html\">fallout around ride-hailing company Didi's</a> New York listing in 2021. But in 2024, 35 small China-based companies listed in New York, roughly twice the 17 U.S.-based microcap listings, Renaissance Capital said in December.</p><p>Microcaps typically refer to stocks with market capitalizations of between $50 million and $300 million, meaning the companies raised only a few million in the initial public offering.</p><p>The rule change is \"a positive,\" said Gary Dvorchak, managing director at Blueshirt Group, whose business includes advising Chinese companies on IPOs. \"I think it's going to instill more confidence that the companies are listing are doing it for legitimate reasons and there's less likely to be games being played with the stock and it really protects the companies as well.\"</p></div><div><p><img src=\"https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/108194002-17569362831756936278-41481764034-1080pnbcnews.jpg?v=1756936283&amp;w=750&amp;h=422&amp;vtcrop=y\" alt=\"Nasdaq Private Market CEO Tom Callahan shares his bull case for private markets\" /><span></span><span><div><p><span>watch now</span><span></span></p></div></span></p></div><div><p>Nasdaq noted the Chinese listings pose greater risk to U.S. investors due to U.S. inability to take legal action \"against entities and individuals involved in potentially manipulative trading activities in these securities.\"</p><p>\"Further, the Exchange has observed that Chinese companies listing on Nasdaq in connection with an IPO with an offering size below $25 million have a higher rate of compliance concerns,\" Nasdaq said.</p><p>The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission needs to formally approve Nasdaq's proposal. Companies already in the IPO process would then have 30 days to complete the process under prior rules, Nasdaq said, while all subsequent listings would have to comply with the changes.</p><p>The New York Stock Exchange, which typically only handles far larger IPOs, did not immediately respond to a request for comment outside of U.S. business hours. The SEC and China's Securities Regulatory Commission did not immediately respond either.</p></div><h2><a></a>Tensions on the boil?</h2><div><p>The Nasdaq's listing requirement is \"another example of the multitude of ways in which conducting business, trade and investment relations between the two countries is growing more complex and difficult,\" said Stephen Olson, a visiting senior fellow at the ISEAS-Yusof Ishak Institute.</p><p>In fact, the New York exchange's rule change came on the heels of Beijing's announcement late Wednesday that it would <a href=\"https://www.mofcom.gov.cn/zwgk/zcfb/art/2025/art_b2c4d06f333445a99dcc6cf1bb75bb5b.html\" target=\"_blank\">slap new punitive tariffs on some U.S. optical fiber producers</a>, effective Thursday.</p><p>\"China is saying: we are prepared to fight fire with fire,\" Olson said. \"The trade truce is just a temporary band-aid. It could collapse at any time.\"</p><p>China's Ministry of Commerce cited a six-month investigation that found that some U.S. exporters had skirted China's anti-dumping levies by selling a modified version of the optical fiber.</p><p>New York-headquartered optical fiber producer <span><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/GLW/\">Corning </a><span><span></span></span></span>now faces a 37.9% duty on the product's exports to China, OFS Fitel 33.3% and Draka Communications Americas 78.2%.</p><p>For its overall business, Corning counted China as its largest source of revenue outside the U.S., contributing 32% of its total sales revenue in 2024, according to the company earnings report.</p><p>The company and the U.S. Commerce Department did not immediately respond to a request for comment.</p><p>China has a deficit of $57 million in optical fiber trade with the U.S. in the first seven months this year, according to the official customs figures.</p><p>That imbalance may have given Beijing the \"technical pretext to act,\" said Tianchen Xu, senior economist at Economist Intelligence Unit, noting that the items that China imports from the U.S. are largely more advanced and thus more expensive per item.</p><p>\"The exchange of fire [between the U.S. and China] will continue in many ways,\" Xu predicts, which might derail plans for a meeting between the two countries' presidents.</p><p>The decision came a day after Washington revoked <span><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/TSM/\">Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co's</a><span><span></span></span></span> authorization to ship key chipmaking equipment and technology to its manufacturing plant in China, the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2025/09/03/us-makes-it-harder-for-tsmc-sk-hynix-samsung-to-make-chips-in-china.html\">latest move to curb Beijing's semiconductor advances</a>.</p><p>China's optical fiber tariff \"signals displeasure\" on recent U.S. moves to restrict Beijing's access to advanced chips and participation in the undersea cable supply chain, said Alfredo Montufar-Helu, managing director at advisory firm GreenPoint.</p><p>But the tariff is \"also targeted and restrained enough to avoid shattering months of trade negotiations. And it also serves as a reminder that China's leverage extends beyond rare earths,\" Montufar-Helu said.</p></div><h2><a></a>Years of growing of scrutiny</h2><div><p>While China has sought to encourage domestic financial development, it has also been keen to control capital outflows, including stock offerings overseas. New policies in the last three years have required Chinese companies to get the securities regulator's approval for overseas listings, especially if their business has a large domestic user base.</p><p>Stateside, Nasdaq's move marks a big step in what's been growing regulatory scrutiny on tiny Chinese IPOs over the last several years.</p><p>Underwriters for IPOs with market capitalizations below $600 million saw their average commission <a href=\"https://www.sfc.hk/-/media/EN/files/COM/Statements/SFC-HKEX_Joint-Statement_EN.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">triple over four years to 12% in 2020</a>, the Hong Kong stock exchange and local securities regulator said in a joint statement back in May 2021.</p><p>Then in November 2022, the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority in the U.S. warned investors about \"<a href=\"https://www.finra.org/rules-guidance/notices/22-25\" target=\"_blank\">significant unusual price increases on the day of or shortly after the IPOs of certain small-cap issuers</a>, most of which involve issuers with operations in other countries.\" The notice mentioned China in particular.</p><p>FINRA added it \"has concerns\" about how foreign nationals have opened accounts at U.S. broker-dealers to invest in IPOs and then placed \"manipulative orders and trades to inflate aftermarket prices.\"</p><p>In a FINRA podcast dated Nov. 12, 2024, Peter Gonzalez of the special investigations unit said the <a href=\"https://www.finra.org/media-center/finra-unscripted/special-investigations-unit-combating-money-laundering-fraud-securities-industry\" target=\"_blank\">\"ramp and dump\" schemes have evolved</a> — now occurring weeks or months after the IPO, instead of only a few days.</p></div><div>\n\t\t<p><img src=\"https://fm.cnbc.com/applications/cnbc.com/resources/styles/skin/special-reports/the-china-connection/tcc_widget_logo.png\" />\n\t\t</p>\n\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t<p>Weekly analysis and insights from Asia's largest economy in your inbox<br />\n\t\t\t<a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/lander?id=chinaconnection-newsletter\" target=\"_blank\">Subscribe now</a></p>\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div><p><em>Correction: This story has been updated to reflect that Nasdaq is planning to require Chinese companies to raise at least $25 million in initial public offerings to list on the exchange.</em></p></div>"

Its rivals, meanwhile, are circling its customers, and one is preparing for the possibility the budget travel icon shuts down altogether.</p><p><span><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/UAL/\">United Airlines</a><span><span></span></span></span> on Thursday put on sale a slew of new flights in cities where Spirit operates, like its home base of Fort Lauderdale, Florida, and Orlando, Florida, as well as Las Vegas, Houston and Chicago.</p><p>\"If Spirit suddenly goes out of business it will be incredibly disruptive, so we're adding these flights to give their customers other options if they want or need them,\" Patrick Quayle, United's senior vice president of global network planning and alliances, said in a news release.</p><p>Spirit shot back at Quayle's comment.</p><p>\"While we appreciate the obsession certain airline executives have with us, we're focused on competing and running a great operation. Suggesting anything else is wishful thinking on the part of a high-cost airline looking to eliminate a low-cost competitor so they can fulfill their ultimate goal of charging American travelers the highest fares possible to visit the people and places they love,\" Duncan Dee, Spirit's senior vice president of corporate communications said in an emailed statement. </p><p>\"Spirit is responsible for making low fares available to consumers for more than 30 years, whether they fly with us or not,\" Dee continued. \"We have every expectation to continue doing so for many years to come.\"</p><p>United's new flights start Jan. 6.</p><p>Last week <span><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/ULCC/\">Frontier Airlines</a><span><span></span></span></span>, the second-largest budget airline in the U.S. behind Spirit, announced <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2025/08/26/frontier-routes-spirit-airlines.html\">20 new routes</a> that compete with Spirit.</p><p>Meanwhile, in October, Spirit is exiting Albuquerque, New Mexico; Birmingham, Alabama; Boise, Idaho; Chattanooga, Tennessee; Columbia, South Carolina; Portland, Oregon; and Salt Lake City, as well as Oakland, San Diego, Sacramento and San Jose in California, the carrier told CNBC on Wednesday. It is also axing plans to start service in Macon, Georgia, on Oct. 16.<em> </em></p><p>\"We apologize to our Guests for any inconvenience this may cause and will reach out to those with affected reservations to notify them of their options, including a refund,\" Spirit said in an emailed statement.</p><p>Some of United's additional flights include service between the New York area and Columbia and Chattanooga. United is also adding additional flights between Houston, Chicago and Los Angeles, as well as several additional daily roundtrip options like Los Angeles to Las Vegas, and Chicago to Orlando, Fort Lauderdale, New Orleans and Las Vegas, among others.</p><p>Frontier has the most seat overlap with Spirit at 39%, while United has 18%, according to TD Cowen analyst Tom Fitzgerald.</p><p>Several analysts have said they expect full-service airlines will benefit from <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2025/08/21/spirit-airlines-lessors-bankruptcy.html\">Spirit's troubles</a>.

But <a href=\"https://d18rn0p25nwr6d.cloudfront.net/CIK-0001498710/81fdccc5-e086-40d0-a49e-782d946ead78.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">in August</a>, it said it instead lost nearly $257 million since March 13, after it exited Chapter 11, through the end of June.</p><p>Spirit warned earlier in August that it might not be able to <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2025/08/12/spirit-airlines-warns-it-might-not-be-able-to-survive-without-more-cash.html\">survive a year </a>unless it significantly increased its cash.</p><p>It also said its credit card processor was seeking additional collateral.

While the market can weather a shortfall relatively well when inventories are high, low levels can lead to sharp price spikes if there's a new demand or supply shock, they wrote.</p></div><h2><a></a>How prices might impact coffee drinkers</h2><div><p>Consumers may also feel higher coffee prices differently depending on whether they shop at the grocery store for coffee to prepare at home or consume it away from home, at restaurants or coffee chains, for example, Gargiulo said.</p><p>Coffee prices in the grocery aisle tend to fluctuate more with the commodity cost, meaning they are generally more volatile, he said. Grocers may be quicker to raise store prices as coffee prices rise, and may offer promotions to consumers when coffee prices fall, he said.</p></div><div><p>But prices for food commodities like coffee generally move in cycles, and improving weather and capital investment to boost productivity signal lower prices are likely ahead, Gargiulo said.</p><p>Additionally, the Brazil tariff \"impact\" may be somewhat limited for consumers who buy from big coffee chains, Gargiulo said.</p><p>He estimates Starbucks would have to raise prices by 0.5% or less to recoup the full cost of Brazil tariffs, for example.</p><p><strong>More from Personal Finance:</strong><br /><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2025/09/03/4percent-rule-inflation-retirement.html\">Why inflation is retirees' 'greatest enemy'</a><br /><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2025/09/03/student-loan-borrowers-forbearances-deferments.html\">Student loan borrowers pausing payments have doubled since 2024</a><br /><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2025/09/03/treasury-trump-no-tax-on-tips-jobs.html\">68 jobs may qualify for Trump's $25,000 'no tax on tips' deduction</a></p><p>Over the longer term, consumers should brace for higher-than-average prices, analysts said.</p><p>Extreme weather that negatively impacts coffee harvests is expected to be more common, and coffee consumption worldwide continues to increase and bolster demand, they said.</p><p>\"The prices will continue to go up, in my mind,\" Hoffmann said.</p><p>\"Climate change isn't going away,\" he said. \"The severity of droughts, flooding, all of that will get worse.
