Economists surveyed by Dow Jones had been looking for an increase of 45,000.</p><p>In addition to the drop in September, the August payrolls number was revised to a loss of 3,000 from an initially reported increase of 54,000.</p><p>The report comes as the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2025/10/01/government-shutdown-trump-live-updates.html\">funding impasse in Washington, D.C.</a>, has led to the first government closure since late 2018 into early 2019. Failing a deal over the next two days, the Bureau of Labor Statistics' nonfarm payrolls report for September will not be released, nor will the Labor Department put out the weekly jobless claims count on Thursday. The last time the BLS payrolls report was delayed was in 2013.</p><p>Federal Reserve officials count on the payrolls releases as they make decisions on interest rates. The Fed next meets Oct. 28-29, meaning there won't be another payrolls report before then.</p><p>ADP's count, then, takes on added significance as markets widely expect the central bank to cut another quarter point off its key borrowing rate.</p><p>Job losses spread across sectors during September, offset by a 33,000 increase in education and health services as schools reopened and health care continued its long streak of hiring.</p><p>Elsewhere, leisure and hospitality, a key sector for consumer demand, saw a loss of 19,000 as vacation season wound down. The other services category posted a drop of 16,000, while professional and business services was off 13,000, trade, transportation and utilities declined by 7,000, and construction lost 5,000.</p><p>On a broad scale, service providers decreased 28,000 and goods producers shed 3,000. Businesses with fewer than 50 employees lost 40,000, while companies with 500 or more employees added 33,000.</p><p>\"Despite the strong economic growth we saw in the second quarter, this month's release further validates<br />what we've been seeing in the labor market, that U.S. employers have been cautious with hiring,\" ADP's chief economist, Nela Richardson, said.</p><p>The U.S. economy did expand 3.8% in the second quarter and is on pace for a 3.9% gain in the third quarter, according to the Atlanta Fed's GDPNow data tracker.</p><p>However, concerns have increased over the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2025/09/23/powell-says-slowing-labor-market-prompted-rate-cut-sees-challenging-situation-ahead.html\">state of the labor market</a>, even with the unemployment rate at a relatively low 4.3%.</p><p>\"My baseline outlook doesn't see the labor market softening much further – but there are risks,\" Boston Fed President Susan Collins said Tuesday. \"In particular, I see some increased risk that labor demand may fall significantly short of supply, leading to a more meaningful and unwelcome increase in the unemployment rate.\"</p><p>The consensus view for September was a nonfarm payrolls gain of 51,000 in the BLS report, which unlike ADP includes government jobs.</p><p>Even with the slowdown in hiring, wages in September grew 4.5% on an annual basis, little changed from August, ADP said. However, the rate of increase slowed to 6.6% for those changing positions, down half a percentage point from August.</p><p>ADP said it recalibrated past counts based on BLS benchmark revisions released in September. That resulted in the sharp downward move in the August figure of 43,000. \"The narrative remains the same ... of a slowing in hiring momentum,\" Richardson said on CNBC.</p></div>"

    "body": "<div><p>A DraftKings Sportsbook advertisement on an Outfront billboard on Jan. 25, 2025 in Kansas City, Missouri.</p><p>Aaron M. Sprecher | Getty Images</p></div><div><p>The booming business of betting across America has led to soaring concerns over problem gambling.</p><p>Generally, ads for legitimate, licensed casinos and sportsbooks carry some kind of disclaimer that gambling is supposed to be for entertainment. The small print might offer: \"Gambling problem? Call 1-800-GAMBLER.\"</p><p>That number is about as memorable and sticky as you can get. And it prompted a brief but intense legal battle over who has the right or the moral imperative to operate the closest thing the U.S. has to a national gambling hotline.</p><p>The National Council on Problem Gambling (NCPG) has been running the helpline since 2022, leasing it for $150,000 annually from the Council on Compulsive Gambling of New Jersey (CCGNJ), which had previously operated it since 1983.</p><p>Since the national organization took over, monthly call traffic has increased 34% and media mentions have soared more than 5,000%, leading to a third of Americans recognizing 1-800-GAMBLER as a national hotline, according to the NCPG.</p><p>Now the CCGNJ wants its number back.</p><p>The contract between the two groups ends Tuesday. The national group notified the New Jersey group of its intention to exercise its right of renewal and extend for another five years. CCGNJ refused.</p><p>\"It's our property, \" Luis Del Orbe, CCGNJ's executive director, told CNBC. The group also owns 800gambler.org.</p><p>The National Council sued for an emergency stay this summer to prevent the New Jersey council from taking back operations, arguing that the local group doesn't have the resources to staff or operate the hotline around the clock.</p><p>NCPG has significant financial backing from the NFL — more than $12 million over six years — and major sportsbook operators. The council spends $1.5 million annually providing infrastructure and connection for callers in 10 states and serving as a kind of call-in way station for dozens of other jurisdictions.</p><p>Lawyers for the national council argued that reverting it back under New Jersey's operation would have devastating consequences.</p><p>\"Thousands of individuals and families could suddenly find themselves without access to the only national lifeline for problem gambling,\" said Amanda Szmuc, an attorney with Offit Kurman.</p><p>Del Orbe of the New Jersey organization said his staff is prepared for an increase in calls. When calls come into his office after-hours, they're forwarded to a 24-hour call center in Louisiana — the same one that services many states and local jurisdictions that funnel through 1-800-GAMBLER, he said.</p><p>Del Orbe told CNBC his organization felt NCPG was \"weaponizing the number,\" demanding data on problem gambling from local councils and threatening to bar them from the hotline if they refused.</p><p>The NCPG collects and analyzes data from problem gambling calls, often to illustrate the danger of addiction to betting. But not every state that uses 1-800-GAMBLER shares its statistics with the national council.</p><p>The national council said, \"Despite repeated outreach and offers of consultation, training, and stipends, two state councils declined to participate, and one failed to meet requirements.\" It said it began rerouting calls from those states to the call center in Louisiana.</p><p>\"Our greatest fear is that people in crisis will pick up the phone, or send a text, and find no one on the other end,\" said Jaime Costello, director of programs at NCPG.</p><p>The NFL said in a statement to CNBC, \"Under NCPG's stewardship, 1-800-GAMBLER has been transformed into a vitally important national resource—making it easier for anyone, anywhere in the country to get quality care when they need it. Any disruption or degradation of that service is deeply concerning.\"</p><p>On Monday, the New Jersey Supreme Court denied NCPG's request for an emergency stay, a last ditch effort to keep the number from reverting to the local council.</p><p>The National Council on Problem Gambling says for now it will revert to using its old number, 1-800-522-4700, which isn't quite as easy to remember.</p></div>"

After dropping to a three-year low two weeks ago, rates then shot right back up again.</p><p>As a result, total mortgage application volume declined 12.7% last week compared with the previous week, according to the Mortgage Bankers Association's seasonally adjusted index. The drop was mostly driven by a pullback in refinancing.</p><p>Applications to refinance a home loan fell 21% for the week and were 16% higher than the same week one year ago. This, even though mortgage rates were 32 basis points higher last week than the year before. The refinance share of mortgage activity decreased to 55% of total applications from 60% the previous week.</p><p>The average contract interest rate for 30-year fixed-rate mortgages with conforming loan balances, $806,500 or less, increased to 6.46% from 6.34%, with points rising to 0.61 from 0.57, including the origination fee, for loans with a 20% down payment.</p><p>\"Mortgage rates increased to its highest level in three weeks as Treasury yields pushed higher on recent, stronger than expected economic data. After the burst in refinancing activity over the past month, this reversal in mortgage rates led to a sizeable drop in refinance applications, consistent with our view that refinance opportunities this year will be short-lived,\" said Joel Kan, vice president and deputy chief economist at the MBA.</p><p>Refinance activity pulled back for all loan types, including a 22% drop in conventional refinances and a 27% decline in VA refinances. The average loan size for refinances fell to $380,100 from $461,300 two weeks ago, \"as these higher rates eliminated the refinance incentive for many borrowers with large loans,\" added Kan.</p><p>Applications for a mortgage to purchase a home declined 1% for the week and were 16% higher than the same week one year ago. This is after three consecutive weeks of gains.</p><p>\"The strength of the purchase market has also been impacted by other factors such as broader economic conditions, the health of the job market, and housing inventory,\" said Kan.</p><p>Housing inventory in August fell for the first time since the beginning of this year, according to a recent report from the National Association of Realtors. While homes are sitting on the market longer now, keeping supply higher than a year ago, more sellers are starting to delist their properties. Other potential sellers are choosing to wait for a better market.</p><p>Mortgage rates haven't moved at all at the start of this week. The expectation was that rates could move more decisively on Friday, when the monthly employment report was set for release, but the government shutdown now has that in limbo.</p></div></div>"

Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick on Tuesday said he will let companies finish their negotiations with the administration before setting pharmaceutical-specific levies under the legal authority known as Section 232. </p><p>Trump on Tuesday said he's working with other drugmakers to secure similar pacts over the next week, and the White House confirmed that <span><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/LLY/\">Eli Lilly</a><span><span></span></span></span> is expected to strike the next drug-pricing deal. The vast majority of major pharmaceutical companies, including Eli Lilly, <span><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/JNJ/\">Johnson & Johnson</a><span><span></span></span></span>, <span><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/AZN/\">AstraZeneca</a><span><span></span></span></span>, <span><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/ABBV/\">AbbVie</a><span><span></span></span></span>, <span><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/ROG-CH/\">Roche</a><span><span></span></span></span>, <span><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/NVO/\">Novo Nordisk</a><span><span></span></span></span>, and <span><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/AMGN/\">Amgen</a><span><span></span></span></span> have unveiled new U.S. investments in manufacturing or research facilities in recent months to build goodwill with the president.</p><p>Shares of Pfizer and several other drugmakers rose on Tuesday following the agreement. Eli Lilly's stock ended 5% higher and shares of AbbVie and AstraZeneca climbed more than 3%, while J&J and Bristol Myers Squibb's stocks increased more than 2% each.</p><p>The Pfizer deal adds certainty for drugmakers and shifts the president's policies \"potentially away from Pharma tariffs,\" BMO Capital Markets analyst Evan Seigerman said in a note on Tuesday. </p><p>\"Today's deal seems to set a path for other pharmaceutical players to follow, allowing for headline pricing concessions and a Trump 'win' without more punitive implementation\" of the president's so-called most favored nation policy or tariffs, Seigerman added. </p><p>Trump in May signed an executive order reviving that controversial plan, which aims to <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2025/05/05/trump-order-us-drug-manufacturing.html\">tie</a> the prices of some medicines in the U.S. to the significantly lower ones abroad. As part of that effort, Trump in July sent <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2025/07/31/trump-drug-prices-eli-lilly.html\">letters</a> to 17 drugmakers — including Pfizer — calling on them to take steps to lower drug prices by Sept. 29. </p><p>\"As we think about the group more broadly, we would not be surprised to see a number of similar agreements to help remove uncertainty on the [most favored nation policy and] tariffs,\" JPMorgan analyst Chris Schott said in a note on Tuesday. </p></div><h2><a></a>'Most favored nation' risk may be manageable</h2><div><p>Tuesday's deal appeared to bring other good news to some drugmakers. </p><p>Pfizer agreed to sell its existing drugs to Medicaid patients at the lowest price offered in other developed nations, or what Trump calls the most-favored-nation price. But Schott said most-favored-nation pricing for Medicaid is \"highly manageable\" for Pfizer. He said that's in part because Medicaid pricing is already similar to international levels for most drugs. </p><p>Notably, Medicaid represents less than 5% of the company's U.S. sales and an \"even smaller percentage of global sales,\" Leerink Partners analyst David Risinger said in a note on Tuesday. </p><p>The same goes for many of the large drugmakers, according to data compiled by Schott. Medicaid makes up less than 5% of Bristol Myers Squibb's U.S. sales, less than 7% of Regeneron's domestic revenue and around 8% of Lilly and AbbVie's domestic sales. </p><p>Medicaid also represents around or less than 10% of U.S. sales for all of J&J, Merck, Amgen and Biogen.</p><p><span><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/GILD/\">Gilead</a><span><span></span></span></span> is among the drugmakers with greater exposure to Medicaid, with the program making up around 20% of its domestic sales. Medicaid plays a large role in HIV prevention and treatment, especially for underserved populations, which is a core focus for Gilead. </p><p>The other part of Pfizer's deal involves the company guaranteeing the same \"most-favored-nation\" pricing on its new drugs for Medicare, Medicaid and commercial payers. But Schott said he sees a \"limited impact\" of that provision, as he expects Pfizer and the broader industry to raise their prices for new drugs abroad rather than lower them in the U.S. </p><p>He added that it will likely apply to a small number of treatments each year and is \"much more digestible\" for the company than any broad implementation for products already on the market. </p></div></div>"

The focus has been on picking the right silicon — another shorthand term for semiconductor — that offers \"the best price performance\" per chip.</p><p>\"We're not religious about what the chips are. And ... that has meant the best price performance solution has been Nvidia for years and years now,\" Scott said. \"We we will literally entertain anything in order to ensure that we've got enough capacity to meet this demand.\"</p><p>At the same time, Microsoft has been using some of its own chips.</p><p>In 2023, Microsoft launched the Azure Maia AI Accelerator which is designed for AI workloads, as well as the Cobalt CPU. In addition, the firm is reportedly working on its next-generation of semiconductor products. Last week, the U.S. technology giant <a href=\"https://news.microsoft.com/source/features/innovation/microfluidics-liquid-cooling-ai-chips/\" target=\"_blank\">unveiled</a> new cooling technology using \"microfluids\" to solve the issue of overheating chips.</p><p>When asked if the longer term plan is to have mainly Microsoft chips in the firm's own data centers, Scott said: \"Absolutely,\" adding that the company is using \"lots of Microsoft\" silicon right now.</p><p>The focus on chips is part of a strategy to eventually design an entire system that goes into the data center, Scott said.</p><p>\"It's about the entire system design. It's the networks and the cooling and you want to be able to have the freedom to make the decisions that you need to make in order to really optimize your compute to the workload,\" Scott said.</p><p>Microsoft and its rivals <span><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/GOOGL/\">Google</a><span><span></span></span></span> and <span><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/AMZN/\">Amazon</a><span><span></span></span></span> are designing their own chips to not only reduce reliance on Nvidia and AMD, but also to make their products more efficient for their specific requirements.</p></div><h2><a></a>Compute capacity shortage</h2><div><p>Tech giants including Meta, Amazon, and Alphabet and Microsoft have committed to more than <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2025/02/08/tech-megacaps-to-spend-more-than-300-billion-in-2025-to-win-in-ai.html\">$300 billion of capital expenditures this year</a>, with much of that focused on AI investments as they look to satisfy booming demand for AI. </p><p>Scott flagged that there is still a shortage of computing capacity.</p><p>\"[A] massive crunch [in compute] is probably an understatement,\" Scott said. \"I think we have been in a mode where it's been almost impossible to build capacity fast enough since ChatGPT ... launched.\"</p><p>Microsoft has been building capacity through data centers but it's still not enough to meet demand, the CTO warned.</p><p>\"Even our most ambitious forecasts are just turning out to be insufficient on a regular basis.

That could leave advertisers and media companies, already clinging to what's left on live TV, with an even smaller pool of options.</p><p>The recent upheaval in late-night programming — namely the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2025/07/26/cbs-canceling-colbert-raises-late-night-questions.html\">cancellation</a> of \"The Late Show with Stephen Colbert\" and the temporary <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2025/09/17/charlie-kirk-jimmy-kimmel-abc-disney.html\">suspension</a> of \"Jimmy Kimmel Live!\" — has shown a spotlight on ratings and revenue for late-night standouts and spurred questions of political influence.</p><p>President <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/donald-trump/\">Donald Trump</a>, aggressively vocal about both Colbert's and Kimmel's bad fortune, has called for late-night shows on NBC hosted by Jimmy Fallon and Seth Meyers to be next on the chopping block.</p><p>The result is not just uncertainty for viewers, TV executives and show staffs, but a pall over an advertising category that's long been a staple of live TV.</p><p>\"Reaching a lot of people who are engaged because it's live TV — or live-to-tape — is really important, and when you think about it from the media company's perspective ... the live moments are live sports on most given nights, the nightly news and late-night talk shows. That's all you have,\" said Kevin Krim, CEO of ad data firm EDO.</p><p>\"To the people who think late night doesn't matter, they're not thinking about the economics and the goals and the incentives of both the advertisers and the media companies. They're ignoring some of the strategic value of the ecosystem,\" he added.</p><p>When <span><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/DIS/\">Disney's</a><span><span></span></span></span> ABC pulled \"Jimmy Kimmel Live!\" off the air in September, it was unclear for days if or when the program would return. While Disney reinstated Kimmel less than a week later, more than 20% of the country still couldn't watch the show for three additional days as two major broadcast station owners preempted the content.</p><p>Colbert's show will end next year after CBS parent <span><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/PSKY/\">Paramount </a><span><span></span></span></span>announced in July it wouldn't renew the program, citing financial considerations. The company has yet to reveal plans to fill the timeslot or give it back to the affiliate network owner.</p><p>The fervor around Colbert's upcoming cancellation caused a <a href=\"https://www.tvinsider.com/1208211/stephen-colbert-late-show-ratings-after-cancellation-fallon-kimmel/\" target=\"_blank\">temporary ratings</a> surge, and Kimmel's suspension led the show to rake in millions of viewers upon its return — way above the average and a missed opportunity for advertisers in the markets where Kimmel was preempted.</p></div><h2><a></a>Late-night draw</h2><div><p>Traditional TV viewership has decreased as the audience opts for streaming. But live content still garners the biggest ratings, which includes late-night talk shows.</p><p>As a result, late-night shows remain a valuable time slot for advertisers, especially for a younger demographic.</p><p>\"Late-night may not draw the same mass audiences it once did, but the viewers who tune in are highly intentional. For advertisers, that makes the space less about sheer scale and more about reaching a consistent, engaged community,\" said Julie Clark, longtime ad industry executive and current senior vice president of media and entertainment at TransUnion.</p><p>\"Jimmy Kimmel Live!\" was considered among the top 10 of ABC's best vehicles for advertising reach, with the show delivering 2.5% of the network's total ad exposures, or 11.8 billion national TV impressions, according to ad measurement firm iSpot.</p><p>According to EDO, in order to generate as much ad impact as one ad in the late-night comedy broadcast programs — that's Kimmel, Fallon, Meyers and Colbert — advertisers would need to air, on average, about four spots across competitive late-night programming this year. In this case, competitive late-night programming means everything aired on broadcast and cable TV, excluding the late-night hosts, during these time slots.</p><p>Brands launching new products still get their best success from live TV commercials, according to ad industry executives.</p><p>But advertisers have begun to cut back on ad spending in the face of macroeconomic headwinds and trade uncertainty. Recently, <a href=\"https://www.emarketer.com/press-releases/tariffs-cause-auto-and-retail-sectors-to-pull-back-on-digital-ads/\" target=\"_blank\">eMarketer</a> and the <a href=\"https://www.iab.com/insights/2025-outlook-study-september-update-a-snapshot-of-the-latest-ad-spend-trends-opportunities-and-strategies-for-growth/\" target=\"_blank\">Interactive Advertising Bureau</a> each released reports projecting a pullback in ad spending, not just for TV but also digital and streaming, due to higher costs for companies brought on by tariffs.</p><p>As advertisers trim spend and Trump puts late night in his crosshairs, the costs of these TV programs are coming under the microscope.</p></div><h2><a></a>Weighing the costs</h2><div><p>Media companies' priorities have shifted to building out their streaming platforms in a push for profits. Pay TV networks still make the majority of the profits, but that number is shrinking.</p><p>\"Generally speaking, viewership of late night talk shows has been low compared to what they once were, but it's less about a specific host or show and more about the shift in how people consume television,\" said Vicky Chang, vice president of media at Tatari, a digital ad platform.</p><p>Paramount said in July its move to end Colbert was \"purely a financial decision against a challenging backdrop in late night.\" Kimmel's show will face another test when his contract comes up in 2026.</p><p>\"Late-night TV and daytime morning shows used to be two of the most profitable areas of TV, more so than sports because of the big sports rights fees. Networks typically made a huge amount of money,\" said Jonathan Miller, longtime senior media industry executive who serves as CEO of Integrated Media. \"Initially late-night shows weren't very expensive, but the costs have gone up. But ratings have declined so it's less profitable – and hosts still want a lot of money.\"</p><p>The focus for media companies is increasingly on content that guarantees big live audiences — by and large, live sports. This has led to hefty spending on sports rights over other kinds of content.</p><p>Weeks after Colbert said this season would be his final, the newly merged Paramount Skydance announced a <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2025/08/11/paramount-buys-ufc-rights-skydance-merger.html\">$7.7 billion media rights deal with UFC</a>. ABC parent Disney and NBCUniversal last year signed a new media rights deal with the NBA worth $77 billion over 11 years.</p><p>Media companies are also facing the daunting cost of rising political pressure.</p><p>Trump and Federal Communications Commission Chair Brendan Carr have ramped up<strong> </strong>scrutiny of media companies during the president's second term in office.</p><p>Last year ABC News agreed to pay $15 million toward Trump's presidential library to <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2024/12/14/abc-agrees-to-give-15-million-to-donald-trumps-presidential-library-to-settle-defamation-lawsuit.html\">settle a lawsuit</a> over comments by TV anchor George Stephanopoulos that Trump called defamatory.

Soon after, the company announced the future end date of the late-night show.</p><p>Disney's suspension of Kimmel came on the heels of comments by the FCC's Carr that suggested affiliate ABC stations could lose their broadcast licenses if they aired content that was against the \"public interest.\" Trump made a similar threat regarding the broadcast networks that he said are \"against\" him.</p><p><em>Disclosure: Comcast is the parent company of NBCUniversal, which owns CNBC.

Involvement in these crypto ventures has led to accusations of corruption, conflicts of interest and self-dealing from opposition lawmakers, as well as calls for ethics investigations.</p><p>On Wednesday, Trump Jr. had in part, acknowledged some of these concerns, saying that the World Liberty Foundation was not a political organization. </p><p>However, he added that the company's aim is to benefit America's national interest, and that the USD1 stablecoin would help support the purchasing of U.S. treasuries and help create and maintain dollar hegemony. </p><p>\"We're flying to every single corner of this globe, convincing people to onboard to USD1 which, in effect, convinces those people to go buy U.S. Treasuries, and it's great for the U.S. dollar,\" said Witkoff.</p></div><div><p><img src=\"https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/108184685-17550019121755001906-41149394929-1080pnbcnews.jpg?v=1755001911&w=750&h=422&vtcrop=y\" alt=\"World Liberty Financial co-founders on $1.5 billion digital coin deal, growth of USD1 stablecoin\" /><span></span><span><div><p><span>watch now</span><span></span></p></div></span></p></div><div><p>The team announced Wednesday that USD1 would be launching on an additional blockchain network, Aptos.</p><p><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2025/06/03/trump-usd1-stablecoin.html\">Data</a> in June had found that demand for USD1 on centralized exchanges had been muted.
