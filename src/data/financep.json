More than 1 in 4 American adults currently have a side job in addition to their full-time occupation, according to a <a href=\"https://www.bankrate.com/loans/small-business/side-hustles-survey/\" target=\"_blank\">recent survey from Bankrate</a>.</p><p>But as soon as you dip your toes in working for yourself, it's essential to make sure your intellectual property is legally protected.</p><p>\"At the bare minimum, you need a trademark,\" says Darlene Harris, managing attorney at Power In Protection in Charlotte, North Carolina.</p><p>Even if your business is only making a few hundred bucks at the beginning, you could get yourself into trouble if you don't take a few small steps to protect your brand, your work and your personal liability, she says.</p><p>\"Anyone who is selling any product or service, if you are an entrepreneur in any way, shape or form, you need this,\" she says.</p></div><h2><a></a>Why you need to protect your brand</h2><div><p>Harris, who specializes in intellectual property law, compares a trademark to owning a deed to a house. Until you have a trademark, your name, the name of your business, your logo and your slogan are like property that other people could theoretically inhabit.</p><p>\"If someone else says, 'This is my house. I live here,' all you have to do is pull out the deed,\" Harris says. \"On the flip side, if you don't have a deed to your house, now you have to go through a whole squatter's rights fight.\"</p><p><em><strong>DON'T MISS</strong></em><strong>:</strong><a href=\"https://smarter.cnbcmakeit.com/p/how-to-start-a-business-for-first-time-founders?utm_source=cnbc&utm_medium=makeitarticle&utm_campaign=body\" target=\"_blank\"><strong> </strong><em><strong>The ultimate guide to starting a business—everything you need to know to be your own boss</strong></em></a></p><p>And fight you people will, Harris says.</p><p>\"If you go to get your business off the ground and you're using a name that's too similar to someone else's, they'll sue you,\" she says. \"They'll say, 'Hey, you've been using this name. I don't care if you've made $500. I want my percentage of that $500.'''</p></div><h2><a></a>Why it pays to speak with a lawyer</h2><div><p>The biggest mistake aspiring side hustlers make is not thinking about the future of their business, Harris says. While your content creation or crafting business may seem like small potatoes now, it will ideally grow into something bigger and in need of evolving legal protections.</p><p>\"You have to think big,\" Harris says. \"Where do you want to take this, and how do we protect not only what you're doing now, but your plans for the future?\"</p><p>The last thing you want to do, she says, is build a thriving and lucrative brand only to find out that someone else is legally entitled to a piece of your profits.</p><p>That's why an aspiring entrepreneur would be wise to sit down with an attorney, who can provide an intellectual property strategy that goes beyond a few legals documents you may be tempted to find for cheaper online, Harris says.</p><p>Harris says she'd be wary of any firm charging less than $1,500 to get your documents in place and to help you come up with a strategy.</p><p>Other protections to discuss with your attorney include <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2022/02/24/wordle-kind-of-rips-off-lingo-a-copyright-lawyer-says-thats-ok.html\">copyright</a> — similar to a trademark but for work you've authored, such as photographs, songs or articles — and forming a <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2018/04/20/llc-university-founder-how-to-form-an-llc-the-right-way.html\">limited liability partnership</a>, which helps separate your business and personal assets, and protects you financially in the event of a lawsuit.</p><p>\"A lot of times people underestimate what they're building.

But the reprieve didn't last — 30-year fixed rates are climbing again, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/US30YFRM\">back to about 6.37%</a>, as of Thursday. They've been stuck above 6% for the past three years.</p><p>So, what gives?</p><p>While the Fed's rate influences what you pay on credit cards, personal loans and auto financing, it isn't much of a driver behind mortgage rates.</p></div><h2><a></a>How mortgage rates really work</h2><div><p>Fixed mortgage rates — unlike variable mortgages that move more with Fed rate changes — are most closely tied to <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/US10Y\">10-year Treasury bonds</a>.</p><p>When a bank issues a mortgage, it usually bundles the loan with other mortgages and <a href=\"https://www.newyorkfed.org/medialibrary/media/research/staff_reports/sr674.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">sells it to investors as a bond</a>. The interest homeowners pay on their mortgages becomes a stream of payments to those bondholders. The return on those bonds is <a href=\"https://www.finra.org/investors/insights/bond-yield-return\" target=\"_blank\">called the yield</a>, expressed as a percentage of the price buyers paid.</p><p>To decide what return mortgage bond investors will accept, lenders <a href=\"https://www.richmondfed.org/publications/research/economic_brief/2023/eb_23-27\" target=\"_blank\">look to the 10-year Treasury</a> — a government bond that also pays interest and is seen as the best comparison, since most homeowners move or refinance after about a decade.</p><p>Mortgage rates usually end up <a href=\"https://fred.stlouisfed.org/graph/?g=i8HP\" target=\"_blank\">one to two points higher</a> than the 10-year yield to <a href=\"https://www.fanniemae.com/research-and-insights/publications/housing-insights/rate-30-year-mortgage\" target=\"_blank\">cover risks</a> that Treasuries don't face — like homeowners defaulting, borrowers refinancing early if rates fall or the fact that mortgage bonds are <a href=\"https://www.ginniemae.gov/newsroom/publications/Documents/agency_mbs_liquidity.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">harder to trade</a> than government securities.</p><p>Right now, that gap — known as <a href=\"https://fred.stlouisfed.org/graph/?g=i8HP\" target=\"_blank\">the spread</a> — is wider than historical norms, well above 2%. It's a big reason mortgage rates remain elevated above 6%.</p></div><h2><a></a>Why the spread is so wide</h2><div><p>The spread has been wider than normal for two main reasons, Selma Hepp, chief economist at Cotality, tells CNBC Make It.</p><p>Inflation \"remains sticky,\" especially for services and shelter, she says, with overall inflation climbing back to 2.9% year over year in August — above the Fed's 2% target. Since higher inflation erodes the value of mortgage bond payments, investors tend to seek higher yields.</p><p>And the Fed's pullback from buying mortgage-backed securities has left private investors to fill the gap. \"With less demand, [mortgage-backed security] prices fall, yields rise and mortgage rates increase. This widens the spread relative to Treasuries,\" says Hepp.</p><p>Considering that the <a href=\"https://fredblog.stlouisfed.org/2025/09/fomc-summary-of-economic-projections-september-2025/\" target=\"_blank\">Fed's own projections</a> don't have inflation reaching 2% until 2028, the \"current dynamic is likely to continue,\" says Christopher Hodge, chief economist for the U.S. at Natixis CIB Americas. \"This has increased longer-term inflation expectations, which increases the premium demanded for mortgages.\"</p><p>Those expectations help explain why Fannie Mae projects 30-year fixed rates will stay above 6% for another year, <a href=\"https://www.fanniemae.com/data-and-insights/forecast/economic-developments-september-2025\" target=\"_blank\">according to an updated forecast released Tuesday</a>.</p><p><em><strong>Want to be your own boss?</strong> Sign up for Smarter by CNBC Make It's new online course, </em><a href=\"https://smarter.cnbcmakeit.com/p/how-to-start-a-business-for-first-time-founders?utm_source=cnbc&utm_medium=makeitarticle&utm_campaign=bottom\" target=\"_blank\"><em>How To Start A Business: For First-Time Founders</em></a><em>.

One state-affiliated <a href=\"https://weibo.com/1277071452/Q5I7pi4BT?pagetype=profilefeed\" target=\"_blank\">Weibo account</a> cited a Fudan University professor, who described the agreement as a \"win-win\" for both countries.</p><p>During the signing of an executive order on the deal, Trump said that he had \"gotten the go ahead\" from Chinese President Xi Jinping.</p><p>No representatives from ByteDance were present at the signing, and ByteDance and the Chinese Embassy in Singapore did not respond to CNBC's requests for comments.</p><p>Meanwhile, certain details of the deal remain unclear. On Friday, Chinese media outlet LastPost reported that TikTok U.S.'s operations would be divided into two companies, citing unnamed sources.</p><p>A new joint-venture company, which was laid out in Trump's executive order on Thursday, would oversee TikTok's U.S. business, data and algorithm, with its China-based owner ByteDance retaining a less than 20% stake.</p><p>According to the order, this would satisfy the requirements of a U.S. national security law requiring ByteDance to divest from TikTok's U.S. operations or face an effective ban in the country. </p><p>ByteDance will also set up a new U.S. company responsible for e-commerce, brand advertising and managing ties with TikTok's international operations, LastPost reported, citing anonymous sources.</p></div><div><p><img src=\"https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/108204301-17588617611758861758-41820175401-1080pnbcnews.jpg?v=1758861760&w=750&h=422&vtcrop=y\" alt=\"TikTok deal does not address underlying national security concerns: JP Morgan\" /><span></span><span><div><p><span>watch now</span><span></span></p></div></span></p></div><div><p>The fate of TikTok in the U.S. has long hung in the balance, with lawmakers from both major political parties warning that Beijing could gain access to sensitive data or use TikTok to influence public opinion. </p><p>A fifth of adult Americans now regularly get news on TikTok, up from just 3% in 2020, according to a Pew Research <a href=\"https://www.pewresearch.org/short-reads/2025/09/25/1-in-5-americans-now-regularly-get-news-on-tiktok-up-sharply-from-2020/\" target=\"_blank\">survey</a> released on Friday.</p><p>Earlier this year, the Supreme Court upheld a law to ban the app unless ByteDance divests from it.

    "body": "<div><p>A Costco store in Richmond, California, US, on Thursday, May 29, 2025. </p><p>David Paul Morris | Bloomberg | Getty Images</p></div><div><p><span><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/COST/\">Costco</a><span><span></span></span></span> on Thursday topped Wall Street's expectations for quarterly earnings and revenue as the warehouse club posted double-digit gains in both membership income and its e-commerce business.</p><p>Unlike many other retailers, the company does not share an annual outlook.</p><p>On the company's earnings call, CFO Gary Millerchip said the retailer has worked hard to offset higher tariff costs. In some cases, it has introduced new items from its Kirkland Signature private-label brand as alternatives to goods hit by tariffs, he said. About a third of Costco's U.S. sales come from imported goods.</p><p>Costco is also changing its merchandise assortment in some cases, he said, such as buying more U.S.-made items or leaning into categories with less tariff exposure like health and beauty.</p><p>He said overall inflation remained in the low- to mid-single-digit range, with food price increases similar to last quarter. Yet for the second consecutive quarter, he said inflation returned for non-food merchandise, primarily driven by imported items.</p><p>Shares of the retailer fell slightly in extended trading.</p><p>Here's how Costco did in its fiscal fourth quarter compared with what Wall Street was expecting, based on a survey of analysts by LSEG:</p><ul><li><strong>Earnings per share:</strong> $5.87 vs $5.80 expected</li><li><strong>Revenue:</strong> $86.16 billion vs. $86.06 billion expected</li></ul><p>Costco's net income for the three-month period that rose to $2.61 billion, or $5.87 per share, compared with $2.35 billion, or $5.29 per share a year earlier. Revenue increased from $79.7 billion in the year-ago period.</p><p>Same-store sales, an industry metric that takes out one-time factors such as store openings and closures, rose 6.4% excluding the impact from changes in gas prices and foreign exchange. That result, which was reported along with Costco's August sales numbers, marks two quarters in a row of decelerating same-store sales.</p><p>E-commerce sales increased by 13.5% compared with the year-ago period, excluding the impacts from changes in gas prices and foreign exchange.</p><p>For the full year, e-commerce sales exceeded $19.6 billion, a 15% year over year increase, Vachris said on the company's earnings call. That amounts to a little over 7% of Costco's net sales for the year.</p><p>Vachris said Costco is adding more digital features, including the rollout of checkout technology to clubs that makes it faster for employees to scan small- and medium-sized transactions. It's improving the search features on its website and app. And, he said, it's created a virtual waiting room on its website for high-demand items like Pokemon cards during peak traffic periods.</p><p>As U.S. consumers look for value, Costco and its warehouse club competitors <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2025/09/20/costco-sams-club-and-bjs-open-new-stores-and-gain-members-.html\">have opened new locations and attracted more members</a>. Younger shoppers have signed up for the stores as the retailers offer more convenient ways to shop online, a wider variety of merchandise and cheaper meals.</p><p>In an interview this summer, Millerchip told CNBC that the average age of the company's members has fallen, and just under half of its new signups each year from people under 40.</p><p>As members across age groups join, Costco's revenue, which includes net sales and membership fees, has also grown. Its full-year revenue totaled $275.24 billion, up about 8.1% year over year.</p><p>In the quarter, its membership fee income jumped about 14%, which reflects its increase in paying shoppers, the rising number of members who are upgrading to higher-tier memberships and its higher annual fee. Last fall, it <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2024/07/10/costco-hikes-membership-fee-for-the-first-time-since-2017.html\">raised its membership fee</a> for the first time since 2017. Costco shoppers now pay $5 more per year or $10 more annually for its higher-tier membership when their annual fee renews.</p><p>Millerchip said on the company's earnings call that the membership fee increase accounted for a little less than half of its membership fee income growth in the quarter.</p><p>On the company's earnings call, CEO Ron Vachris said Costco opened 27 new warehouses, including three relocations. It plans to open another 35 warehouses in the coming fiscal year, including five relocations.</p><p>Traffic to stores and Costco's website rose 3.7% globally during the quarter, Millerchip said on the call. Meanwhile, average transaction size climbed 2.6% worldwide, excluding gas and foreign exchange changes, he added.</p><p>During the quarter, sales in Costco's fresh category, which includes perishable items, grew by high-single-digits led by double-digit gains in meat, Millerchip said on the company's earnings call. Non-food grew by high-single-digits, too, as jewelry, gift cards, toys and men's apparel all rose by double-digits year over year.</p><p>Gold bars, however, were less of a growth driver in the quarter because Costco is lapping a year-ago period when <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2024/04/09/costco-selling-up-to-200-million-in-gold-bars-a-month-wells-fargo-estimates.html\">it first started to sell the item,</a> Millerchip said.</p><p>Shares of Costco have jumped by about 180% over the past five years. Yet the retailer has underperformed the market more recently, as shares are up just over 2% so far this year compared to the S&P 500's more than 12% gains during the same time.</p></div>"

The president similarly used that power to impose tariffs on other goods, such as cars and aluminum. </p><p>The tariffs deal a long-awaited blow to pharmaceutical companies, many of which have <a href=\"https://www.regulations.gov/comment/BIS-2025-0022-0070\" target=\"_blank\">pushed back </a>and warned that the levies could drive up costs, deter <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2025/04/29/pfizer-ceo-trump-tariff-uncertainty-is-deterring-us-investment.html\">investments</a> in the U.S. and disrupt the drug supply chain, ultimately putting patients at risk.</p><p>In <a href=\"https://www.regulations.gov/comment/BIS-2025-0022-0196\" target=\"_blank\">public comments</a> to the government in May, Eli Lilly said tariffs will \"deprive manufacturers of necessary capital to both innovate and invest in reshoring\" since they will redirect capital to cushion the impact of the levies. That was among the hundreds of comments released by the Department of Commerce in late May in relation to its 232 investigation into the pharmaceutical industry.</p><p>Some health policy experts also say the move could disrupt the drug supply chain at the expense of U.S. patients, driving up costs for certain treatments or even exacerbating the medication shortages plaguing the nation. Drugmakers often rely on a global network of manufacturing sites for different steps of the production process. </p><p>There \"is the potential for higher prescription drug prices in an environment where we're already pushing very hard to try to get those prices down,\" Leigh Purvis, prescription drug policy principal in AARP's Public Policy Institute, told CNBC before the tariff announcement.</p><p>She added that there are \"a lot of generic drugs specifically that could potentially have to make decisions between being unprofitable and pulling from the market entirely.\"</p></div><h2><a></a>Tariff storm</h2><div><p>The levies are lower than the up to 250% tariff rate on pharmaceuticals that Trump floated in August in an interview with CNBC's<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2025/08/05/trump-says-pharma-tariffs-could-eventually-reach-up-to-250percent.html\"> \"Squawk Box.\"</a> Trump said he would initially impose a \"small tariff\" on pharmaceuticals, but then in a year to a year and a half \"maximum,\" he will raise that rate to 150% and then 250%.</p><p>The industry is already navigating the fallout from Trump's <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2025/05/12/trump-most-favored-nations-drug-price-order-what-to-know.html\">proposed drug pricing policies</a>, which drugmakers argue threaten both their bottom lines and their capacity to invest in research and development, and a massive overhaul at the Department of Health and Human Services under prominent vaccine skeptic Robert F. Kennedy Jr.</p><p>It's the latest development in Trump's evolving tariff policy, which aims to bring back manufacturing in the U.S.</p><p>The new duties follow the launch of fresh <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2025/09/25/trump-tariff-threat-looms-over-robotics-and-medical-devices-section232-import-investigation.html\">national security investigations</a> announced on Wednesday into imports of robotics, industrial machinery, and medical devices.</p><p>The latest probes by the Department of Commerce expand the list of goods that could face higher tariffs to include personal protective equipment such as surgical masks, N95 respirators, gloves and other medical consumables, including syringes and needles.</p><p>Any new duties resulting from the sector-specific probes would be stacked on top of Trump's country-specific tariffs, though the European Union and Japan have reached agreements that could shield them from extra levies.</p></div><h2><a></a>Shifting manufacturing</h2><div><p>Analysts have raised concerns that it will be difficult to reshore production in the country, which would be costly and could take several years.</p><p>\"Global supply chains are complex, with Pharma among the most–it's not as simple as moving where someone screws in little screws to make an iPhone,\" BMO Capital Markets analyst Evan Seigerman said in a note in April.</p><p>He said the tariffs will \"likely do little to shift manufacturing\" back to the U.S. since companies already have robust operations in the country. </p><p>Seigerman said he expects most large pharmaceutical companies will likely set a goal of \"waiting until the end of Trump's presidency to consider more permanent manufacturing decisions.\"</p><p>J&J in March also <a href=\"https://www.jnj.com/media-center/press-releases/johnson-johnson-increases-u-s-investment-to-more-than-55-billion-over-the-next-four-years\" target=\"_blank\">announced a new $55 billion investment </a>in U.S. manufacturing, research and development and technology over the next four years. </p><p>In April, J&J said it expects to record a $400 million tariff expense in 2025, which reflects already-announced levies and doesn't predict the effects of pharmaceutical-specific tariffs. It is primarily related to the company's medical device products, executives said on an earnings call at the time.</p><p>Other companies, including <span><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/PFE/\">Pfizer</a><span><span></span></span></span>, have <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2025/04/29/pfizer-pfe-earnings-q1-2025.html\">also recorded charges</a> related to the tariffs Trump announced in April.</p><p>J&J CEO Joaquin Duato echoed the warnings of health policy experts.</p><p>\"There's a reason...why pharmaceutical tariffs are zero. It's because tariffs can create disruptions in the supply chain, leading to shortages,\" Duato said during the call. He added that favorable tax policies would be a more effective tool to boost the U.S. manufacturing capacity of both drugs and medical devices.</p><p>Some drugmakers, such as Eli Lilly, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/BMY/\">Bristol Myers Squibb</a> and <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/ABBV/\">AbbVie</a>, may be better positioned than others to weather tariffs because they have more major manufacturing plants in the U.S. than internationally, TD Cowen analyst Steve Scala said in a note in April. The majority of their sites responsible for producing the active ingredients in drugs are also in the U.S., he added. </p><p>Meanwhile, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/NVS/\">Novartis</a> and <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/RHHBF/\">Roche</a> \"look more at risk\" because they have few U.S. plants and a higher share of active ingredient sites that are international, Scala said.</p></div></div>"

Economic ignorance from Trump is \"finishing the job,\" they said.</p><p>\"The U.S. shale business is broken,\" the executive said.</p><p>The Trump administration has effectively aligned itself with the decision by OPEC+ to increase oil supply, \"kneecapping U.S. producers in the process,\" the person said.</p><p>\"Guided by a U.S. Department of Energy that tells them what they want to hear instead of hard facts, they operate with little understanding of shale economics,\" the same executive said.</p><h3>Regulatory costs</h3><p>A White House spokesperson said Trump is \"rolling back burdensome regulations that were killing the industry,\" crediting the president's policies with record production in June. Energy Secretary Chris Wright has repeatedly argued that the administration is making drilling cheaper by cuting red tape. </p><p>But 57% of executives surveyed by the Dallas Fed said regulatory changes since January have reduced their breakeven costs by less than $1 per barrel.</p><p>Another executive warned that Trump's attacks on the renewable energy industry will come back to haunt the oil and gas sector in a few years. Investors are avoiding energy due to volatility and the \"stroke of pen\" risk that the White House wields over energy projects, the person said.</p><p>\"Life is long, and the sword being wielded against the renewables industry right now will likely boomerang back in 3.5 years against traditional energy,\" they said, warning the industry will face harsher methane penalties, permitting restrictions and environmental reviews when Democrats return to power.</p></div></div>"

Within days, it drew fiery social media backlash over the risk it posed to one of the world's most fragile ecosystems and prompted a government investigation.</p><p>The mountaineering brand's poor public response and reports of residual debris across the mountain slopes that followed has further fueled outrage and offered a cautionary tale in brand marketing.</p><p>The organizers claimed that precautions were taken in the lead up to the\"Rising Dragon\" event such as using biodegradable, environmentally-friendly materials and relocating nearby animals using salt bricks and cleaning up residues after the event.</p><p>Still, critics warned the campaign could cause lasting harm to the fragile Himalayan ecosystem, damaging the glaciers and soil stability, and disturbing wild animals' hibernation. They also accused Arc'teryx of hypocrisy for acting against its environmentally aware image and called for boycotts.</p></div><blockquote><div><p>The incident is an important and valuable reminder, especially for those who take consumers for granted and fail to adapt to these social and cultrual changes in China today.</p><div><p>Yaling Jiang</p><p>Founder of consumer consultancy firm ApertureChina</p></div></div></blockquote><div><p>\"The whole fireworks stunt is against the purpose of going hiking: nature, silience, tranquility, simplicity —doesn't matter if the material is environmentally friendly or not,\" said Amber Wu, a marketing consultant for international brands in China.</p><p>Sharing that sentiment, Calvin Yeap, a Shanghai-based marketing professional for consumer brands, said \"no one could say this stunt can be justified in any way for a brand that makes it money and reputation on nature.\"</p><p>\"The breach of trust [among consumers] is often more damaging than the incident itself and not easily forgotten,\" Wu added, noting that core outdoor enthusiasts, a core segment of consumers for Arc'teryx, may shift to rivals such as Patagonia, which is seen as more consistent and authentic in its environmental commitments.</p><p>The Tibetan plateau and its mountains are sacred to Tibetan buddists and have been tightly controlled since it was annexed by China in the 1950s. Shigatse, Tibet's second-largest city, has a population of about 800,000, with Tibetans making up around 90%.</p><p>In recent years, the region has become a popular tourist destination for travellers from other parts of China, stoking concerns over environmental damage and overcommercialization.</p></div><h2><a></a>What went wrong?</h2><div><p>The controversy has turned into a crash course in public relations, as professionals raised their eyebrows over how the idea was greenlit by the company and local authorities at all.</p><p>Many pointed to the disconnect between the global and local team on brand strategy and messaging.</p><p>In a <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/arcteryx/posts/pfbid02bCzyWeFQfBrvAWM47bS94XFfUsr7pZnzDubQweiHUzjuuxdX4roawR7HT3kWZ3RDl\" target=\"_blank\">statement</a> Sunday, Arc'teryx said the event was \"in direct opposition to our commitment to outdoor spaces,\" while seeking to distance itself from the collaborating artist, Cai Guoqiang, and their local team in China. \"We're addressing this directly with the local artist involved, our team in China, and will change the way we work to ensure this doesn't happen again,\" it said.</p><p>However, in a separate post in Chinese, Arc'teryx said the art project was intended to raise awareness of local cultures at high altitude but the execution \"strayed and at times ran counter to that goal,\" according to CNBC's translation.</p><p>\"It looked like the global team was not fully aware of this project [while] the local team seemed to have operated without a deep, ingrained understanding of the brand's core environmental value,\" said Wu, adding that the China team may have prioritized local trends over the company's broader brand vision.</p><p>Meanwhile, Chinese-born visual artist Cai, who oversaw similar shows for Beijing's Olympics Games in 2008, apologized for his artwork, saying he and his studio \"humbly accept all criticisms,\" and that there were \"many oversight on our part.\"</p><p>Public relations specialist Ivy Yang pointed out that Cai apologized on his studio's Chinese social media platforms, but not on his personal Instagram page in English. </p><p>\"Cai's value to Arc'teryx is his blue-chip credibility\" with high-profile collaborations with major global brands ... Arc'teryx helped him 'realize a dream' on a high-risk project,\" Yang said, adding that \"the same prestige that once helped win core enthusiasts can flip quickly when the narrative breaks.\"</p></div><h2><a></a>Government lapse</h2><div><p>While much of the blame has fallen on the brand and the artist, some argue that local authorities also failed in its role as a gatekeeper.</p><p>\"What surprises me most is that the local authority approved an event of this nature, [which] leads me to question the details of the approval process\" for events with potential environmental impact, said Echo Gong, an independent Shanghai-based retail consumer consultant. \"The regulators [ought] to be one of the guardians for the environment.\"</p><p>A county-level environmental bureau official told local media Saturday that Arc'teryx's event had been given prior approval and was compliant as the materials used were environmentally friendly.</p><p>However, shortly after the backlash, the Shigatse municipal government <a href=\"https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/JoV_riV8V9hQUDNjyfU-7A\" target=\"_blank\">said Sunday</a> it dispatched officials to the site to investigate whether any environmental rules and regulations had been violated.</p></div><h2><a></a>Controversy heightens</h2><div><p>Despite the apologies, controversy has continued to swirl as more video footages appear, showing fragments of copper, plastic packaging and unburned gunpowder scattered across the Himalayan slopes after the firework stunt, triggering another wave of public criticism.</p><p>Chinese state broadcaster CCTV aired a video Monday showing Tibetan villagers climbing up the mountain to clean up the debris.</p><p>\"You can't get more arrogant than this: you ruined their habitat, and they have to clean it up and live with the enduring consequences?\" said Yaling Jiang, founder of consumer consultancy firm ApertureChina.</p><p>\"The Arc'teryx and Cai firework incident is not merely a case of bad PR or environmental infringement, but an important and valuable reminder — especially for those who take consumers for granted and fail to adapt to these social and cultrual changes in China today,\" Jiang noted.</p></div></div>"

Under the terms, which China must still approve, a new joint-venture company will oversee TikTok's U.S. business, with ByteDance retaining less than a 20% stake.</p><p>Enterprise tech giant <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/ORCL/\">Oracle</a>, Silver Lake and the Abu Dhabi-based MGX investment fund will be main investors in TikTok's U.S. business, controlling a roughly 45% stake in the entity, while ByteDance investors and new holders will own 35%, CNBC's David Faber <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2025/09/25/oracle-silver-lake-mgx-tiktok.html\">reported</a> earlier Thursday. </p><p>No representatives from ByteDance were present at the signing, and the company hasn't acknowledged that a transaction is taking place. No purchase price was mentioned, and there's no indication that the Chinese government has made changes to laws that would be necessary for a deal to take place.</p><p>President Trump said Chinese President Xi Jinping gave the deal the go ahead. Vance said the Chinese government put up some resistance before the agreement.</p><p>Under the planned arrangement, <span><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/ORCL/\">Oracle</a><span><span></span></span></span> will oversee the app's security operations and continue providing cloud computing services for the new TikTok U.S. firm, Faber reported, citing sources familiar with the deal. Trump said Oracle CEO <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/larry-ellison/\">Larry Ellison</a> is involved in the ownership group and that his company is \"playing a very big part.\"</p><p>\"It's owned by Americans, and very sophisticated Americans,\" Trump said at the signing. \"This is going to be American operated all the way.\"</p><p>ByteDance investors like General Atlantic, Susquehanna and Sequoia, are expected to contribute equity in the new TikTok U.S. entity, sources told Faber.
