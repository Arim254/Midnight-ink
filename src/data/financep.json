    "body": "<div><p><span><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/NKE/\">Nike</a><span><span></span></span></span> on Tuesday posted surprise sales growth in its fiscal first quarter but said it still has work ahead to execute its turnaround as it warned it expects sales to fall again during most of the holiday shopping season.</p><p>Nike expects sales during its current quarter, which runs generally from early September to early December, to fall by a low single digit percentage, in line with expectations of a 3% decline, according to LSEG. Without favorable foreign exchange rates, sales could come in even lower, as the company said its guidance includes a 1 percentage point of positive impact from exchange rates.</p><p>Nike has made progress in its turnaround plan, but the expected decline during most of the holiday shopping months would follow an 8% drop in revenue in the year-ago period. It's a sign to investors that Nike's recovery is moving slowly, even during the busiest time of the year for retailers.</p><p>Higher tariff costs are hampering Nike's efforts to turn around its business. The company now expects tariffs to cost it $1.5 billion and hit its gross margin by 1.2 percentage points in its current fiscal year 2026. That's up from the $1 billion and 0.75 percentage point gross margin impact it projected in June. </p><p>During its current quarter, Nike said it expects its gross margin to fall between 3 and 3.75 percentage points.</p><p>In a press release, finance chief Matt Friend warned that \"progress will not be linear.\"</p><p>\"I'm encouraged by the momentum we generated in the quarter, but progress will not be linear as dimensions of our business recover on different timelines,\" said Friend. \"While we navigate several external headwinds, our teams are focused on executing against what we can control.\"</p><p>Here's how Nike performed during the quarter compared with what Wall Street was anticipating, according to consensus estimates from LSEG:</p><ul><li><strong>Earnings per share:</strong> 49 cents vs. 27 cents expected</li><li><strong>Revenue:</strong> $11.72 billion vs. $11.0 billion expected</li></ul><p>Nike's reported net income in the three months ended Aug. 31 was $727 million, or 49 cents per share, compared with earnings of $1.05 billion, or 70 cents per share, in the year-ago quarter.</p><p>Sales rose to $11.72 billion, up about 1% from $11.59 billion a year earlier.</p><p>Revenue rose 1% during the quarter after Nike previously said it anticipated sales would fall by a mid-single digit percentage in the period. Still, Nike's profits fell 31% while gross margin dropped 3.2 percentage points to 42.2% during the quarter — another warning sign to investors that its efforts to clear through old inventory are still ongoing.</p><p>In a statement, CEO Elliott Hill said the company is making strides in three key areas: wholesale, running and North America. During the quarter, wholesale revenue rose 7% to about $6.8 billion, while sales in North America climbed 4% to $5.02 billion — better than the $4.55 billion analysts were expecting, according to StreetAccount.</p><p>However, beyond those three areas, Hill acknowledged parts of the business are still struggling, primarily its China segment, Converse brand and its direct business, which includes stores and online <strong>sales</strong>.</p><p>During the quarter, Nike direct sales fell 4% to about $4.5 billion, while Converse sales dropped 27%. Revenue in China -- one of the company's most important markets — was down 9%.</p><p>\"Greater China, as I mentioned on the last call, is facing structural challenges in the marketplace,\" Hill told analysts on a conference call. \"Seasonal sell through continues to underperform. Our plans require larger investments to keep the marketplace clean.\"</p><p>The company said it expects revenue and gross margin headwinds to continue throughout fiscal 2026 in both China and at Converse. Nike does not expect its direct business to return to growth in fiscal 2026.</p><p>Since Hill took over nearly a year ago, he's been working to get Nike back to growth and undo some of the work his predecessor John Donahoe implemented. One of the most important parts of that strategy has been reigniting <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2024/04/12/nike-ceo-blames-remote-work-for-innovation-slowdown.html\">Nike's innovation engine</a> and clearing through stale inventory to make way for new styles.</p><p>Though the strategy is crucial to Nike's efforts to grow again and take back <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2025/05/24/on-running-shoes-nike-adidas.html\">market share</a>, it comes with pain in the short term. Clearing out old inventory has required Nike to rely on discounting and less profitable sales channels to move products, which has impacted its profitability.</p><p>During the quarter, inventories were down 2% compared to the prior year as units decreased, which was offset by increased product costs related to <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2025/05/21/nike-price-increases-tariffs.html\">higher tariffs.</a> Hill and Friend made it clear during the call with analysts that its inventory efforts are ongoing. While progress is going to depend on the respective geographies and channels, Nike said its expects its gross margin to benefit from less clearance in the second half of the year.</p><p>Beyond inventory management, Hill has also pledged to realign Nike's corporate structure so it would once again segment teams by sport instead of by women's, men's and kids. In late August, the company started shuffling teams. As part of the restructuring, Nike said it would <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2025/08/28/nike-to-lay-off-about-1percent-of-corporate-staff.html\">cut around 1% of its staff</a>, and most employees would be moved into new roles by Sept. 21. </p><p>The realignment impacted around 8,000 employees but is expected to drive growth as the teams get to work, said Hill. It is unclear how many of those employees were moved to new positions and how many were laid off. </p><p>\"This new formation and ways of working will align our three brands, Nike Jordan and Converse into more nimble focused teams by sport. We'll gain sharper insights to fuel innovation and storytelling and connect with the communities of each sport in more meaningful ways,\" said Hill. </p><p>\"Collectively, we'll have a better coordinated attack with each brand forming a distinct identity and delivering a clear attention to serve different consumers,\" he added. \"In the marketplace, organizing by sport, gives us a much clearer point of view.\"</p><p>Hill cited Nike's \"House of Innovation\" in New York, a redesigned retail experience that segments the store by sports, as an example of how the strategy works. He said the refresh has led to double-digit increases in revenue and a similar, smaller-format approach in Texas showed similar results.</p><p>Hill has said a focus on sports over lifestyle will help the company win back its crucial athlete consumer, but lifestyle merchandise is still an important part of the strategy because it allows Nike to reach a larger consumer segment, and more women. Growing the number of female customers has been another important part of Hill's strategy and Nike's recent partnership with Kim Kardashian's shapewear brand Skims is one of the ways it's getting there.</p><p>NikeSKIMS, originally slated to release in the spring, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2025/09/22/nikeskims-activewear-line-to-launch-this-week.html\">officially launched last week</a>. Hill told analysts the \"early consumer response\" has been \"very strong.\"</p></div>"

While schools like Stanford and Princeton also offer a great value to students, they come at a steeper cost with average net prices above $10,000, per WSJ.</p><p>Historically, families have felt it's <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2025/04/18/median-return-on-investment-for-a-college-degree.html\">worth it</a> to send their student to a top-ranked school, despite the cost. But these days, they'll \"trade in prestige for a college that's going to cost half as much,\" Selingo says.</p><p>\"They have the money, but they're unwilling to pay for a certain level of prestige,\" he adds. \"They want to save that money for other things, including their children after they get out of college.\"</p><p>While Baruch and the other best value CUNY schools don't rank nearly as high in The Wall Street Journal's <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/rankings/college-rankings/best-colleges-2026?mod=article_relatedinline\" target=\"_blank\">overall rankings</a>, \"location matters,\" Selingo says. And the fact that these colleges are in New York City — which is a hotspot for <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2025/01/16/these-us-cities-have-the-most-jobs-paying-over-500000.html\">high-paying jobs</a> in a variety of industries — can also give students a long-term career advantage. </p><p>However, living in New York for college may be expensive. CUNY schools have limited student housing, and it typically is not guaranteed for students.</p><p>That could mean living in an off-campus apartment in Manhattan, where the average rent is around $5,600 a month, according to <a href=\"https://www.rentcafe.com/average-rent-market-trends/us/ny/manhattan/\" target=\"_blank\">RentCafe</a>, although that figure can vary depending on the neighborhood, apartment size and number of roommates.</p><p><em><strong>Last chance to save: Want to be your own boss?</strong> Final days to get 30% off Smarter by CNBC Make It's new online course, </em><a href=\"https://smarter.cnbcmakeit.com/p/how-to-start-a-business-for-first-time-founders?utm_source=cnbc&utm_medium=makeitarticle&utm_campaign=bottom\" target=\"_blank\"><em>How To Start A Business: For First-Time Founders</em></a><em>.

    "body": "<div><p>A DraftKings Sportsbook advertisement on an Outfront billboard on Jan. 25, 2025 in Kansas City, Missouri.</p><p>Aaron M. Sprecher | Getty Images</p></div><div><p>The booming business of betting across America has led to soaring concerns over problem gambling.</p><p>Generally, ads for legitimate, licensed casinos and sportsbooks carry some kind of disclaimer that gambling is supposed to be for entertainment. The small print might offer: \"Gambling problem? Call 1-800-GAMBLER.\"</p><p>That number is about as memorable and sticky as you can get. And it prompted a brief but intense legal battle over who has the right or the moral imperative to operate the closest thing the U.S. has to a national gambling hotline.</p><p>The National Council on Problem Gambling (NCPG) has been running the helpline since 2022, leasing it for $150,000 annually from the Council on Compulsive Gambling of New Jersey (CCGNJ), which had previously operated it since 1983.</p><p>Since the national organization took over, monthly call traffic has increased 34% and media mentions have soared more than 5,000%, leading to a third of Americans recognizing 1-800-GAMBLER as a national hotline, according to the NCPG.</p><p>Now the CCGNJ wants its number back.</p><p>The contract between the two groups ends Tuesday. The national group notified the New Jersey group of its intention to exercise its right of renewal and extend for another five years. CCGNJ refused.</p><p>\"It's our property, \" Luis Del Orbe, CCGNJ's executive director, told CNBC. The group also owns 800gambler.org.</p><p>The National Council sued for an emergency stay this summer to prevent the New Jersey council from taking back operations, arguing that the local group doesn't have the resources to staff or operate the hotline around the clock.</p><p>NCPG has significant financial backing from the NFL — more than $12 million over six years — and major sportsbook operators. The council spends $1.5 million annually providing infrastructure and connection for callers in 10 states and serving as a kind of call-in way station for dozens of other jurisdictions.</p><p>Lawyers for the national council argued that reverting it back under New Jersey's operation would have devastating consequences.</p><p>\"Thousands of individuals and families could suddenly find themselves without access to the only national lifeline for problem gambling,\" said Amanda Szmuc, an attorney with Offit Kurman.</p><p>Del Orbe of the New Jersey organization said his staff is prepared for an increase in calls. When calls come into his office after-hours, they're forwarded to a 24-hour call center in Louisiana — the same one that services many states and local jurisdictions that funnel through 1-800-GAMBLER, he said.</p><p>Del Orbe told CNBC his organization felt NCPG was \"weaponizing the number,\" demanding data on problem gambling from local councils and threatening to bar them from the hotline if they refused.</p><p>The NCPG collects and analyzes data from problem gambling calls, often to illustrate the danger of addiction to betting. But not every state that uses 1-800-GAMBLER shares its statistics with the national council.</p><p>The national council said, \"Despite repeated outreach and offers of consultation, training, and stipends, two state councils declined to participate, and one failed to meet requirements.\" It said it began rerouting calls from those states to the call center in Louisiana.</p><p>\"Our greatest fear is that people in crisis will pick up the phone, or send a text, and find no one on the other end,\" said Jaime Costello, director of programs at NCPG.</p><p>The NFL said in a statement to CNBC, \"Under NCPG's stewardship, 1-800-GAMBLER has been transformed into a vitally important national resource—making it easier for anyone, anywhere in the country to get quality care when they need it. Any disruption or degradation of that service is deeply concerning.\"</p><p>On Monday, the New Jersey Supreme Court denied NCPG's request for an emergency stay, a last ditch effort to keep the number from reverting to the local council.</p><p>The National Council on Problem Gambling says for now it will revert to using its old number, 1-800-522-4700, which isn't quite as easy to remember.</p></div>"

It currently uses models from <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2025/06/10/openai-cnbc-disruptor-50.html\">OpenAI</a> and <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2025/06/10/anthropic-cnbc-disruptor-50.html\">Anthropic</a>.</p><p>Every eight weeks, LLM Suite is updated as the bank feeds it more from the vast databases and software applications of its major businesses, giving the platform more abilities, <a href=\"https://www.jpmorgan.com/technology/applied-ai-and-ml/machine-learning/derek-waldron\" target=\"_blank\">Derek Waldron</a>, JPMorgan chief analytics officer, told CNBC in an exclusive interview.</p><p>\"The broad vision that we're working towards is one where the JPMorgan Chase of the future is going to be a fully AI-connected enterprise,\" Waldron said.</p><p>JPMorgan, the world's largest bank by market capitalization, is being \"fundamentally rewired\" for the coming artificial intelligence era, according to Waldron. The bank, a heavyweight across Main Street and Wall Street finance, wants to provide every employee with AI agents, automate every behind-the-scenes process and have every client experience curated with AI concierges.</p><p>If the effort succeeds, the project could have profound implications for the bank's employees, customers and shareholders — even the nature of corporate labor itself.</p><p>Waldron, who gave CNBC the first demonstration of its AI platform seen by any outsider, showed the program creating an investment banking deck in about 30 seconds, work that would've previously taken a team of junior bankers hours to complete.</p></div><h2><a></a>Out of the box</h2><div><p>Since the arrival of OpenAI's <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2023/02/08/what-is-chatgpt-viral-ai-chatbot-at-heart-of-microsoft-google-fight.html\">ChatGPT</a> in late 2022, optimism over generative AI has driven markets higher on gains from the tech giants and chipmakers closest to the trade. Underpinning their growth is the expectation that corporate clients deploying AI will either boost worker productivity or lower expenses through layoffs — or both.</p><p>But similar to how the internet story played out in the 1990s, near-term expectations for AI may have outstripped reality. Most corporations had no tangible returns yet on their AI projects despite more than $30 billion in collective investments, according to an <a href=\"https://mlq.ai/media/quarterly_decks/v0.1_State_of_AI_in_Business_2025_Report.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">MIT report</a> from July.</p></div><div><p>Jamie Dimon, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of JPMorgan Chase & Co. speaks during an event honoring local construction workers who helped build the firm’s new headquarters at 270 Park Avenue, in the Midtown area of New York City, U.S., Sept. 9, 2025.  </p><p>Shannon Stapleton | Reuters</p></div><div><p>In the case of JPMorgan, even with it $18 billion annual tech budget, it will take years for the company to realize AI's potential by stitching the cognitive power of AI models together with the bank's proprietary data and software programs, said Waldron.</p><p>\"There is a value gap between what the technology is capable of and the ability to fully capture that within an enterprise,\" Waldron said.</p><p>Companies \"do work in thousands of different applications, there's a lot of work to connect those applications into an AI ecosystem and make them consumable,\" he said.</p><p>If JPMorgan can beat other banks to the punch on incorporating AI, it will enjoy a period of higher margins before the rest of the industry catches up. That first-mover advantage will allow it to grow revenues faster by going after a larger slice of the addressable market in global finance — enabling the bank to pitch more middle-market companies in investment banking, for instance.</p></div><h2><a></a>Change on the horizon</h2><div><p>AI was a major topic at a four-day executive retreat held in July by JPMorgan CEO <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/jamie-dimon/\">Jamie Dimon</a>, according to a person who attended but declined to be identified speaking about the private event.</p><p>Among concerns discussed at the off-site meeting, held at a resort outside Nashville, Tennessee, was how AI-driven changes will be adopted by the bank's 317,000-person workforce and its possible impacts to the apprenticeship model on areas including investment banking.</p><p>If JPMorgan succeeds with its AI goals, it will mean that a bank that is already the largest and most profitable in American history is set for new heights. Dimon has led the bank since 2005, guiding it through periods of upheaval to notch record profits in 7 of the last 10 years.</p><p>The end state for JPMorgan, as envisioned by Waldron, is a future in which AI is woven into the fabric of the company:</p><p>\"Every employee will have their own personalized AI assistant; every process is powered by AI agents, and every client experience has an AI concierge,\" he said.</p></div><div><p>JPMorgan <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2024/08/09/jpmorgan-chase-ai-artificial-intelligence-assistant-chatgpt-openai.html\">laid the groundwork</a> for this starting in 2023, when it gave employees access to OpenAI's models through LLM Suite; it was essentially a corporate ChatGPT tool used to draft emails and summarize documents.</p><p>About 250,000 JPMorgan employees have access to the platform today, which is the entire workforce except for branch and call center staff, said Waldron. Half of them use it roughly every day, he said.</p><p>JPMorgan is now early in the next phase of its AI blueprint: It has begun deploying <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2025/09/24/generative-ai-spending-investment-bubble.html\">agentic AI</a> to handle complex multistep tasks for employees, according to an internal road map provided by the bank.</p><p>\"As those agents become increasingly powerful in terms of their AI capabilities and increasingly connected into JPMorgan,\" Waldron said, \"they can take on more and more responsibilities.\"</p></div><h2><a></a>Nvidia deck</h2><div><p>Waldron, a former McKinsey partner with a Ph.D. in computational physics, recently demonstrated LLM Suite's capabilities to CNBC.</p><p>He gave the program a prompt: \"You are a technology banker at JPMorgan Chase preparing for a meeting with the CEO and CFO of <span><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/NVDA/\">Nvidia</a><span><span></span></span></span>. Prepare a five-page presentation that includes the latest news, earnings and a peer comparison.\"</p><p>LLM Suite created a credible-looking PowerPoint deck in about 30 seconds.</p><p>\"You can imagine in the past how that would have been done; we would've had teams of investment banking analysts working long hours at night to do this,\" said Waldron.</p><p>The bank is also training AI to draft other key investment banking documents including the \"inch thick\" confidential memos that JPMorgan produces for prospective M&A clients, said the person who attended the July executive meeting.</p></div><div><p>Derek Waldron, JPMorgan's chief analytics officer.</p><p>Courtesy: JP Morgan</p></div><div><p>The prospect of collapsing workloads means that fewer junior bankers may be needed even while AI-enabled teams handle more work and pitch more companies, according to senior Wall Street executives at several firms who spoke on the condition of anonymity to provide their candid thoughts.</p><p>But to extract the full value from this new, almost magical technology, it's not just about the tools: Changes to how employees and departments are organized may be needed.</p><p>One proposal being discussed at a major investment bank is reducing the ratio of <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2021/03/18/goldman-sachs-junior-bankers-complain-of-crushing-work-load-amid-spac-fueled-boom-in-wall-street-deals.html\">junior bankers</a> to senior managers from the current 6-1 to 4-1. In the new regime, half of those junior bankers would be working from cities with cheaper labor, say Bengaluru, India, and Buenos Aires, Argentina, instead of being clustered in expensive New York.</p><p>The AI-powered junior bankers could then work on deals in shifts around the clock, passing the baton from one time zone to the next.</p><p>With fewer bankers on the payroll, the cost structure of investment banking would fall, boosting the bottom line, said the executives.</p></div><h2><a></a>Structural shifts</h2><div><p>Unlike previous generations of technology, where bespoke automation tools had to be made for every distinct job, LLM Suite can service them all, from traders to wealth managers and risk officers, according to Waldron.</p><p>The implications for workers are profound. AI will empower some workers and give them more time, positioning them at the center of a team of AI agents. Others will be displaced by AI that takes over processes which no longer require human intervention.</p><p>That shift favors those who work directly with clients — a private banker with a roster of rich investors, traders who cater to hedge fund and pension managers, or investment bankers with relationships with Fortune 500 CEOs, for instance.</p><p>Those at risk of having to find new roles include operations and support staff who mainly deal in rote processes like setting up accounts, fraud detection or settling trades.</p><p>In May, JPMorgan's consumer banking chief told investors that operations staff would fall by <a href=\"https://www.jpmorganchase.com/content/dam/jpmc/jpmorgan-chase-and-co/investor-relations/documents/events/2025/jpmc-2025-investor-day/full-transcript.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">at least 10%</a> in the next five years thanks to artificial intelligence deployment.</p><p>\"In an AI world, you'll still have people at the top who are managing and have relationships with clients, but many, many of the processes underneath are now being done by AI systems,\" Waldron said.</p></div><h2><a></a>AI FOMO</h2><div><p>But it's still unwritten as to how that future will unfold; will corporations retain workers impacted by AI, retraining them for the new roles it creates? Or will they simply opt to cut their payroll?</p><p>\"Without a doubt, AI technology will have changes on the construction of the workforce,\" Waldron said. \"That is certain, but I think it's unclear as to exactly what those changes will look like.\"</p><p>More broadly, Waldron said that workers would shift from being creators of reports or software updates, or \"makers\" in his terminology, to \"checkers\" or managers of AI agents doing that work.</p><p>The bank is closing in on another frontier: It will soon allow generative AI to interact directly with customers, Waldron said. JPMorgan will start with limited cases, like allowing it to extract information for a user, before rolling out more advanced versions, he said.</p><p>Despite market concerns that the AI trade is a brewing bubble, corporate clients are actually more worried now that if they don't start adopting it soon, they'll fall behind and lose share, said <a href=\"https://www.debevoise.com/avigesser\" target=\"_blank\">Avi Gesser</a>, a Debevoise & Plimpton partner who advises corporations on issues around AI.</p><p>\"People are starting to see what these tools can do,\" Gesser said. \"They're sort of like, 'Wow, if you get the workflow right, implement it properly and have the right guardrails, I could see how that would save you a lot of time and a lot of money and deliver a better product.\"</p></div><div><p><img src=\"https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/108170748-6ED1-WEX-071125-Hugh.jpg?v=1752235424&w=750&h=422&vtcrop=y\" alt=\"Goldman Sachs tests agentic AI to automate software engineering\" /><span></span><span><div><p><span>watch now</span><span></span></p></div></span></p></div></div>"

Pfizer will also guarantee the same \"most-favored-nation\" pricing on its new drugs for Medicare, Medicaid and commercial payers.</p><p>As part of the deal, Pfizer has also agreed to a three-year grace period during which the company's products won't face <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2025/09/26/us-to-impose-100percent-tariff-on-branded-patented-drugs-unless-firms-build-plants-locally-trump-says.html\">pharmaceutical-specific tariffs</a> – as long as the drugmaker further invests in U.S. manufacturing. The company plans to invest $70 billion to reshore domestic drug manufacturing and research facilities.</p><p>Shares of Pfizer rose more than 4% on Tuesday after the announcement.</p><p>\"Pfizer has agreed to provide some of the most popular current medications to our consumers at heavily discounted prices anywhere between 50% and even 100%,\" Trump said, adding that those drugs will be available for direct purchase at a discount online on a website the administration is calling TrumpRx.gov.</p><p>Trump said he's working with other drugmakers to secure similar agreements over the next week, adding that Pfizer is the first.</p><p>\"If we don't make a deal, we're going to tariff them,\" he said of the other companies' drugs.</p><p>The White House confirmed with CNBC's Eamon Javers that Eli Lilly is in negotiations with Trump for the next drug pricing deal, without providing further details on how far along talks are. </p><p>The deal comes as Pfizer and 16 other drugmakers face Trump's Monday deadline to take steps to lower drug prices, as outlined in <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2025/07/31/trump-drug-prices-eli-lilly.html\">letters</a> from the president. Trump in May signed an executive order reviving a controversial plan, the \"most favored nation\" policy, that aims to <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2025/05/05/trump-order-us-drug-manufacturing.html\">tie</a> the prices of some medicines in the U.S. to the significantly lower ones abroad.</p><p>During the press conference, Pfizer CEO Albert Bourla said the company satisfied all four of the requests Trump outlined in his letter. Among the other steps is pursuing tougher price negotiations abroad and adopting models that sell its medicines directly to consumers or businesses.</p><p>\"The big winner clearly will be the American patients, there is no doubt,\" Bourla said. \"They are the ones that will see a significant impact on their ability to buy medicines.\" But he said \"American innovation and and the American economy\" will also be \"winners\" with the agreement.</p></div><h2><a></a>Pfizer's discounted drugs</h2><div><p>Pfizer said it will offer a large share of its primacy care treatments and certain specialty branded drugs at discounts of 50% on average and up to 85%, according to a release from the company.</p><p>In a separate statement Tuesday, Pfizer said more than 100 million patients are impacted by diseases those medicines treat, such as migraines, rheumatoid arthritis, menopause and atopic dermatitis.</p><p>The company provided examples of discounted drugs under TrumpRx.gov. <a href=\"https://www.duavee.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Duavee</a>, a treatment for certain menopause symptoms, will be available for as little as $30 on the site, which is an 85% discount to its current price.</p><p>Patients will also be able to pay as low as $162 – an 80% reduction to the current price – for prescription ointment Eucrisa, which is used to treat mild-to-moderate eczema. Tovias, a medication for overactive bladder, will also be available on TrumpRx.gov for as little as $42, which is a 85% discount to the current price.</p><p>Pfizer said it also plans to offer products such as Abrilada for autoimmune diseases at a 60% discount, Xeljanz for rheumatoid arthritis at a 40% discount and the migraine drug Zazvpret at 50% discount.</p><p>Those drugs don't appear to be significant revenue drivers for Pfizer. The company's quarterly and full-year earnings reports only include product-specific revenue for Xeljanz, which generated <a href=\"https://s206.q4cdn.com/795948973/files/doc_financials/2024/q4/Q4-2024-PFE-Earnings-Release-Final.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">$349 million in worldwide sales</a> in 2024. Sales of the drug fell 29% operationally from 2023, primarily due to lower demand globally as well as lower net prices in the U.S.</p><p>The deal comes as drugmakers brace for Trump's planned tariffs on pharmaceuticals imported into the country. Trump said in a Truth Social post Thursday that the U.S. will impose a 100% tariff on \"any branded or patented Pharmaceutical Product\" entering the country from Oct. 1.</p><p>The measure will not apply to companies building drug manufacturing plants in the U.S., Trump said. He added that the exemption covers projects where construction has started, including sites that have broken ground or are under construction.</p><p>In a note on Tuesday, BMO Capital Markets analyst Evan Seigerman said the deal is positive for Pfizer's stock and the broader pharmaceutical sector, as it \"adds certainty and shifts POTUS policies potentially away from Pharma tariffs.\"</p><p>\"Today's deal seems to set a path for other pharmaceutical players to follow, allowing for headline pricing concessions and a Trump 'win' without more punitive implementation\" of the most favored nation policy or tariffs, he added.</p></div><div><p><img src=\"https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/108205737-17592430481759243046-41886839877-1080pnbcnews.jpg?v=1759243048&w=750&h=422&vtcrop=y\" alt=\"President Trump to announce drug-pricing deal with Pfizer\" /><span></span><span><div><p><span>watch now</span><span></span></p></div></span></p></div></div>"
