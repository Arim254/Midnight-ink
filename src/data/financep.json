But after diving in, she burned out \"really bad at the end of my 20s,\" she told CNBC Make It at the <a href=\"https://events.fastcompany.com/innovationfestival25\" target=\"_blank\">Fast Company Innovation Festival</a> in New York City last week.</p><p>Burning out led to Wood's fascination with how the brain operates. She founded <a href=\"https://www.getautonomic.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Autonomic</a>, a brain wellness platform that analyzes user behavior and helps build new habits geared toward lowering stress and improving energy, focus, mood and sleep.</p><p>Wood calls the platform \"a personal trainer for your brain.\"</p><p>Wood has worked with neuroscience experts for years and used what she's learned to create some of her own habits for optimal cognitive functioning.</p><p>Here's her \"non-negotiable morning routine.\"</p></div><h2><a></a>1. She avoids looking at her phone first thing in the morning</h2><div><p>First, Wood avoids looking at a <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2020/03/13/why-you-should-be-reducing-screen-time-and-3-simple-tips-to-do-it.html\">digital device</a> for the first 30 minutes of her day.</p><p>\"Your first activities in the morning can strongly affect your ability to concentrate, stay motivated, and think clearly for the rest of the day,\" she says. \"Your prefrontal cortex, the part of your brain that helps you focus and make decisions, is especially influenced by what you do and experience soon after waking up.\"</p><p>Research <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2025/08/13/struggling-to-focus-it-could-be-popcorn-brain-heres-how-to-fix-it.html\">shows</a> that when looking at a screen, people's attention span decreased from an average of two and half minutes in 2004 to an average of 47 seconds in 2016.</p><p>Instead, Wood spends the first 30 minutes of her day brushing her teeth, taking a shower and getting dressed.</p></div><h2><a></a>2. She drinks 'a warm cup of water with a pinch of salt'</h2><div><p>Wood also makes sure <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2024/08/07/the-best-hydrating-foods-and-beverages-include-coconut-water-celery.html\">to hydrate</a>.</p><p>\"I boil the kettle and have a warm cup of water with a pinch of salt and some lemon or orange slice,\" she says. Staying hydrated improves quality of sleep, cognition and mood, according to the <a href=\"https://hsph.harvard.edu/news/the-importance-of-hydration/\" target=\"_blank\">Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health</a>.</p><p>\"A tiny pinch of salt or a balanced electrolyte solution — water with a pinch of salt, a splash of citrus, or a little honey — can enhance cognitive function and response times after overnight dehydration,\" she says.</p></div><h2><a></a>3. She spends time outside</h2><div><p>Wood then goes outside and looks in the direction of the sun or, if it's cold, sits by an open window facing East soon after waking up.</p><p>Light is considered a major stimulus in helping the body understand when it's time to do things like sleeping and being awake, according to the <a href=\"https://lifestylemedicine.stanford.edu/more-sunlight-exposure-may-improve-sleep/\" target=\"_blank\">Stanford University Lifestyle Medicine</a> Program.</p><p>\"Exposing the eyes to outdoor light within 30 to 60 minutes of waking, ideally for 1 to 3 minutes, even on overcast days, sets your brain's internal clock, circadian rhythm, correctly,\" says Wood.</p><p>\"This daily habit supports better energy, sharper thinking, and healthier sleep.\"</p><p>If you can't go outside immediately, natural light between 10 a.m. and 2 p.m. can also help, she says.</p></div><h2><a></a>4. She does some movement</h2><div><p>Finally, Wood gets in some movement in the morning, even for a few minutes. \"If it is nice I go for a little walk around the block,\" she says.</p><p>\"If it isn't nice out, I do gentle movement inside.\" That could mean jumping jacks, push-ups, or stretching.</p><p>\"Morning exercise releases dopamine and norepinephrine, the brain's focus and motivation chemicals,\" she says. \"This boosts mood, sharpens focus and improves attention, memory, cognitive flexibility and learning for hours afterward.\"</p><p>All of these habits help prep Wood for her schedule. \"I do all of this before to prime my brain for the day,\" she says. \"The effects I have noticed are significant.\"</p><p><em><strong>Want to be your own boss?</strong> Sign up for Smarter by CNBC Make It's new online course, </em><a href=\"https://smarter.cnbcmakeit.com/p/how-to-start-a-business-for-first-time-founders?utm_source=cnbc&utm_medium=makeitarticle&utm_campaign=bottom\" target=\"_blank\"><em>How To Start A Business: For First-Time Founders</em></a><em>.

I had so many birthday parties at Build-A-Bear,\" Craycroft told CNBC. \"It really is a nostalgic place, and I have so many happy memories there.\"</p><p>The company has recently been targeting adults like Craycroft as it diversifies its portfolio and leans into the nostalgia of the brand. Despite macroeconomic headwinds, the company posted record-breaking revenue in the first half of fiscal 2025, reaching $252.6 million, an increase of nearly 12% from the year-ago period.</p><p>And in its second-quarter <a href=\"https://buildabear.gcs-web.com/news-releases/news-release-details/build-bear-workshop-reports-record-second-quarter-and-first-0\" target=\"_blank\">earnings report</a> at the end of August, the retailer raised its outlook after the success of its tariff mitigation strategies — namely, increasing its inventory in the first quarter while operating under the assumption that tariffs would raise prices.</p><p>Build-A-Bear's stock is up roughly 60% year-to-date and is fast approaching a $1 billion market cap, even as other retailers struggle to recover losses from tariffs.</p></div><div><div><svg width=\"256\" height=\"256\">Stock Chart IconStock chart icon</svg><p><img src=\"https://static-redesign.cnbcfm.com/dist/a54b41835a8b60db28c2.svg\" alt=\"hide content\" /></p></div><p>Build-A-Bear Workshop stock</p></div><div><p>Founded in 1997, the company has been focused on scenario-planning and ensuring its brand stays true to its nostalgic roots while also adapting to the ever-changing macroenvironment, according to CEO Sharon Price John, who took over the company in 2013.</p><p>Though the \"retail apocalypse\" means retailers have seen less foot traffic in malls over the past decade, John said Build-A-Bear has evolved to be \"so much more\" than just a storefront. The company has diversified its positions beyond malls into cruise ships, amusement parks, hospitality and more.</p><p>\"It's a really emotional, memorable experience that creates a tremendous amount of of equity,\" John told CNBC. \"Those strong feelings that consumers have for brands are very stretchable beyond just that one experience.\"</p><p>With more than 600 stores across 32 countries, the company has been exploring new options to offer its signature experience in different ways, including expanding with a host of international stores and creating a line of \"Mini Beans,\" which are smaller, pre-stuffed toys.</p></div><div><p>Stuffed animals are seen at a Build-A-Bear Workshop in Herald Square, New York on Sept. 16, 2025. </p><p>Laya Neelakandan | CNBC</p></div><div><p>John attributed the company's success to its forward-looking strategies. Though Build-A-Bear imports a \"vast majority\" of its products from China and Vietnam, John said the tariff impacts were not as drastic as they could have been because the company planned ahead.</p><p>\"Success isn't an accident, and it often takes years of planning to be able to weather difficult situations,\" John said.</p><p>But the company's core brand success goes beyond just the keeping the balance sheet clean, she added.</p><p>\"The other piece is that I think that we're in the right place at the right time,\" John said. \"There's a lot of planning, but sometimes you just happen to be in the right zeitgeist. Gifting is in the zeitgeist, 'kidulting' is a part of the zeitgeist, personalization is a part of the zeitgeist, returning to comfort things is a part of the zeitgeist, stuffed animals is in the zeitgeist right now.\"</p><p>D. A. Davidson analyst Keegan Cox said there are a multitude of reasons that Build-A-Bear has seen growth even as the macroenvironment shows signs of a potential <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2025/08/04/contentious-july-jobs-report-confirms-the-us-economy-is-slowing-sharply.html\">economic slowdown</a>.</p><p>One of the factors that's helping the company, Cox said, is its ability to \"discreetly\" raise prices of certain items without customers noticing because it's constantly creating new products to stick with current trends that are priced differently.</p><p>\"No consumer is really going to be able to tell, because there's no direct comparable product,\" he told CNBC. \"I think that's a good little tariff mitigation strategy that's kind of just built into their model.\"</p><p>Cox said the company's diverse revenue stream, between new products and new demographics, has been significantly helping it to stay afloat and successful. The analyst said he's seeing \"momentum\" in the company, especially as it ramps up inventory ahead of the holiday season.</p></div><div><p>Stuffed animals are seen at a Build-A-Bear Workshop in Herald Square, New York on Sept. 16, 2025. </p><p>Laya Neelakandan | CNBC</p></div><div><p>Its expansion into international stores has been a particularly effective tool, he added.</p><p>\"In my opinion, those stores just are a super high return on capital, and there's a large runway for growth there that I think is finally starting to show up in the share price,\" Cox said.</p></div><h2><a></a>Embracing the nostalgia</h2><div><p>Craycroft and her friends are a prime example of one of the company's most effective strategies: marketing to adults who grew up with the iconic brand.</p><p>At her best friend's 26th birthday party, Craycroft said she and her friends all felt like children again – except this time, she came prepared with Pinterest research into the specific aesthetic of teddy bear that would match her room and her lifestyle.</p><p>Her golden brown bear, named Bearett, is styled with grey checkered pajamas and bunny-ear slippers.</p></div><div><p>Build-A-Bear teddy bear</p><p>Photo: Cammie Craycroft</p></div><div><p>\"It all just really reminded me of how sweet this is and how it can be something that you can connect with people on,\" she said. \"But it's also just fun and silly.\"</p><p>Craycroft and her friends aren't the only ones leaning into the brand. After making a <a href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/@cammiecraycroft/video/7512159308226809134\" target=\"_blank\">TikTok</a> about her adult relationship with the toy company, she said she saw most of her views on the video came from people searching for \"Build-A-Bear\" on the app.</p><p>According to a <a href=\"https://ir.buildabear.com/news-releases/news-release-details/new-national-teddy-bear-day-survey-finds-92-still-have-their\" target=\"_blank\">recent survey</a> conducted by Build-A-Bear, 92% of adults still own their childhood teddy bears, and nearly 100% of the respondents said stuffed animals are for all ages, not just kids.</p><p>The nostalgia of Build-A-Bear for its older customers, and those who want to carry it on for the next generation, is a huge factor in continuously driving sales, according to University of Pennsylvania marketing professor Americus Reed.</p><p>\"If we learn anything from the Cracker Barrel saga,\" Reed said, referring to the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2025/09/09/cracker-barrel-restaurant-remodels-logo-controversy.html\">internet turmoil</a> over the restaurant chain's attempt at a <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2025/08/27/cracker-barrel-rebrand-why-companies-retreat-from-consumer-criticism.html\">rebrand</a>, \"it is that nostalgia matters, and I think it's a big part of it.\"</p><p>In what's become an \"attention deficit\" economy, with a plethora of options available to consumers at all times, Reed said Build-A-Bear's ability to build upon its existing footprint while also innovating its digital and social media presence has helped it to retain its attention among consumers of all ages.</p><p>Because of the \"ritualistic\" experience of buying a stuffed animal at Build-A-Bear, Reed said, the identity of the brand becomes closely intertwined with the customers.</p><p>\"As you toil with putting something together and personalizing it, you're essentially creating this extension of yourself, and that's incredibly powerful,\" Reed said. \"And then you go home with it, and you can think about it and look at it. That's really hard to replicate.\"</p><p>Reed added that Build-A-Bear has become a good case example of how to effectively build a brand that creates deeper relationships with its consumers than others, creating a sense of loyalty.</p><p>\"The pressure to create something that's special enough to break through the sort of attention deficit economy is going to be the pressure test of who's going to be able to be successful in the future,\" he said. \"They're going to have the most traction.\"</p></div></div>"

    "body": "<div><div><p>Stephen Miran, chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers, following a television interview outside the White House in Washington, DC, US, on Tuesday, June 17, 2025. </p><p>Aaron Schwartz | Bloomberg | Getty Images</p></div><div><p>Less than a week after taking his seat, Federal Reserve Governor Stephen Miran on Monday outlined the reasons why he thinks the central bank's benchmark interest rate is far too high and should be lowered aggressively.</p><p>Changes in tax and immigration policy along with easing rental costs, deregulation and incoming revenue for tariffs are creating a different economic landscape that allow the Fed to cut its benchmark rate by nearly 2 percentage points from its current level, the central banker said in remarks before the Economic Club of New York.</p><p>\"The Federal Reserve has been entrusted with the important goal of promoting price stability for the good of all American households and businesses, and I am committed to bringing inflation sustainably back to 2 percent,\" he said. \"However, leaving policy restrictive by such a large degree brings significant risks for the Fed's employment mandate.\"</p><p>Miran sees the confluence of policy changes from the White House lowering the neutral level of interest that neither restricts nor promotes growth. In remarks heavy with data and citations on theory and interest rate models such as the Taylor Rule, Miran said current monetary policy is significantly more restrictive than the prevailing attitude among his fellow policymakers.</p><p>Using standard policy rules, Miran thinks the federal funds rate, a level that banks charge each other for overnight lending but that influences a wide variety of other rates, should be in the low-2% area. The current funds rate following last week's reduction is targeted between 4%-4.25%.</p><p>\"The upshot is that monetary policy is well into restrictive territory,\" he said. \"Leaving short-term interest rates roughly 2 percentage points too tight risks unnecessary layoffs and higher unemployment.\"</p><p>The views, however, put Miran well outside consensus on the Federal Open Market Committee, where the current approach advocates more caution and a tepid move lower in rates over the next several years.</p><p>At its <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2025/09/17/fed-rate-decision-september-2025.html\">meeting last week</a>, the FOMC voted 11-1 to lower by a quarter percentage point. Miran was the sole dissenter, opting for a half-point cut and putting his individual dot on the committee's \"dot plot\" of expectations in a place that would imply another 1.25 percentage points in reductions this year.</p><p>Earlier Monday, St. Louis Fed President Alberto Musalem, who like Miran is a voter on the FOMC this year, said <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2025/09/22/st-louis-fed-president-musalem-sees-limited-room-for-more-interest-rate-cuts.html\">he sees little room</a> for further cuts. Likewise, Atlanta President Raphael Bostic — who doesn't vote this year — also told The Wall Street Journal he would not support further reductions this year.</p><p>President Donald Trump appointed Miran to the Fed position following former Governor Adriana Kugler's surprise resignation in early August. Like Trump, Miran has been a harsh Fed critic, though he and others described the air at the meeting as collegial and professional.</p><p>Miran pressed his case Monday for lower rates, insisting that inflation is on its way down, particularly in the housing market where cooling rents that had not shown up in the data now will become more apparent.</p><p>He further cited other administration policies, such as its clamp down on immigration, its move to lower business regulations and cut taxes, and the revenue that will be generated from tariffs and its impact on the budget deficit as disinflationary factors.</p><p>\"Labor market statistics and anecdotal evidence suggest border policy is exerting a major impact on the economy,\" he said. \"America's regulatory patchwork has become a material impediment to growth.\"</p><p>Economists at the Fed and elsewhere continue to worry that Trump's tariffs will have a longer-term upward push on inflation. However, Miran said \"relatively small changes in some goods prices have led to what I view as unreasonable levels of concern.\"</p><p>Recent inflation readings, though, have shown prices moving higher and further away from the Fed's 2% inflation mandate.</p><p>Miran is expected to fill the remainder of a term that expires in Jan. 31, 2026, then move back to his position as chair of the Council of Economic Advisers. He peppered his speech with references to CEA research.</p></div></div>"

More Americans have literally joined the club — fueling growth for <span><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/COST/\">Costco</a><span><span></span></span></span>, <span><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/WMT/\">Walmart</a><span><span></span></span></span>-owned Sam's Club and <span><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/BJ/\">BJ's</a><span><span></span></span></span>.</p><p>All three retailers are opening more locations across the country. Shares of the companies have shot up in the past five years, with Costco's stock up about 215% and <span><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/BJ/\">BJ's</a><span><span></span></span></span> up about 305% since the day the Covid pandemic began in March 2020. And Gen Z and millennial shoppers have helped fuel the club channel's gains, as trendier brands and more convenient digital offerings attract younger shoppers.</p></div><div><p>High inflation \"brought the club channel more and more into focus,\" said Bobby Griffin, a consumer analyst at equity research firm Raymond James. The clubs have long been known as a place to buy cheaper gas or bulk packs of household staples for less.</p><p>Yet the companies have continued to \"up the ante,\" he said. Merchandise has gotten sharper, private label offerings have become stronger and the shopping experience has gotten more enjoyable as the retailers have spruced up stores and added more technology, he said.</p><p>Clubs have benefitted from an element of surprise, too. Along with selling bulk packs of paper towels and Keurig coffee pods, clubs have caught the attention of shoppers with items that tap into a desire for dupes or go viral on social media — such as Costco's <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2024/04/09/costco-selling-up-to-200-million-in-gold-bars-a-month-wells-fargo-estimates.html\">gold bars,</a> which <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2023/12/15/costco-sold-more-than-100-million-in-gold-bars-last-quarter.html\">racked up more than $100 million </a>in sales in a single quarter.</p><p>Along with the breakaway hit of gold bars, the many card-carrying members of Costco prompted an unusual message from the U.S. Transportation Security Administration this year. As the government agency phased in stricter requirements for ID cards, it announced across its social media accounts in June that Costco's membership cards don't count as a Real ID.</p><p>And Costco's loyal fan following helped it to post strong sales — and attract support — despite some backlash for <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2025/01/24/costco-shareholders-reject-call-for-review-of-diversity-programs.html\">sticking by its diversity, equity and inclusion policies.</a></p><p>As they pick up newer and younger members, the warehouse clubs see more room for growth.</p><p>Sam's Club earlier this year announced plans to <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2025/04/09/sams-club-to-expand-stores-amid-costco-bjs-competition.html\">open 15 clubs per year going forward</a>, along with renovating its approximately 600 current clubs. It's expanding its footprint again after shutting 63 locations across the country in 2018.</p><p>BJ's <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2024/03/27/bjs-wholesale-costco-and-sams-rival-will-open-clubs-in-southeast.html\">plans to open 25 to 30 new clubs</a> over the next two fiscal years. The smallest club player, which has historically had more locations on the East Coast, has broken into new markets like Texas by opening four locations in the Dallas-Fort Worth area.</p><p>And Costco has stuck with an aggressive expansion plan of opening about 30 clubs per year, with just over half of those in the U.S. and the rest in other parts of the globe, CFO Gary Millerchip told CNBC. In early August, Costco opened four clubs in three different countries: Quebec, Canada; North Guadalajara, Mexico; The Villages in Florida and Richland, Washington.</p><p>Costco is opening some of its new locations this year in existing markets where its clubs are crowded, Millerchip said.</p></div><div><p>Club retailers still face pressure, though, including <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2025/09/09/jobs-report-revisions-september-2025-.html\">an uncertain job market</a> and tariffs. The companies have laid out strategies to reduce their hit from the duties: Costco leaders, for example, said on an earnings call that they diverted imported merchandise with high tariffs to their warehouse clubs in other parts of the world instead of the U.S.</p><p>Clubs' rotating brands and treasure hunt approach could reduce their vulnerability to tariffs. While the retailers sell imported merchandise like furniture and clothing, the bulk of sales come from groceries, and the retailers could swap out or drop an item hit by high tariffs, Griffin said.</p><p>BJ's will carry more holiday items this year from the U.S. or countries with lower tariff exposure, said Bill Werner, BJ's executive vice president of strategy and development.</p><p>As retailers digest the long-term effects of tariffs, Costco will give the latest read on its business, and the club channel, when it reports earnings on Thursday.</p></div><h2><a></a>Sushi dinners and speedier shopping</h2><div><p>The desire for both convenience and cheaper food options has been a boon to warehouse clubs in recent years.<strong> </strong>Instead of ordering from a restaurant, customers have turned to club chains to deliver dinner.</p><p>Earlier this year, Sam's Club's rotisserie chicken, which costs $4.98, and its hot pizzas, which cost $8.98 apiece, joined the list of items that members can get dropped at their doors. And starting last year, the retailer began setting up sushi stations where chefs make fresh rolls, which start at around $8 for a roll, in front of customers each day. It recently made sushi available for curbside pickup and delivery, too.</p><p>Those are examples of the way that warehouse clubs — notoriously low-tech and low-frills — have flipped the script in the digital age.</p></div><div><p>Sam's Club has added sushi stations to its stores where chefs make the rolls fresh. The sushi can also be delivered by same-day delivery to customers' homes.</p><p>Courtesy of Sam's Club</p></div><div><p>In the past, shoppers made a tradeoff for lower prices at clubs, Sam's Club CFO Todd Sears said. They faced long lines, waited to get receipts checked at the store exit and navigated a maze of aisles when trying to find an item.</p><p>\"Experience wasn't a huge element of the club channel,\" Sears said in an interview. \"In fact, it was kind of billed as the experience might be a little bit worse, but you're going to make up for it with value.\"</p><p>Now, curbside pickup, home delivery and new store tech has made the shopping experience faster and more pleasant, he said.</p><p>\"Someone coming home for work can pop in and get out within three minutes and have a meal for home,\" Sears said, noting the company is seeing more frequent club visits instead of just huge stock-ups.</p><p>Sam's Club, in particular, has used tech to stand out from competitors. Customers can skip the checkout line by <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2024/10/07/sams-club-scan-and-go-technology.html\">using Scan & Go,</a> a feature in the retailer's app that allows shoppers to ring up their own items while browsing the aisles.<strong> </strong>About 40% of its transactions are through Scan & Go, Sears said.</p><p>It's leaned on other tech, too, including automated floor scrubbers that free up employees' time to help customers and high-tech archways at the exits that verify most purchases automatically instead of requiring an employee to manually check a receipt.</p><p>BJ's, too, has capitalized on speedier digital options that appeal to busy families and younger shoppers. E-commerce sales at the club jumped 34% in the most recent quarter compared to the year-ago period. CEO Bob Eddy described the digital gains as a \"generational unlock\" that's attracted busy families and younger shoppers.</p><p>Digital offerings have become a popular and lucrative part of BJ's business, Werner said. Same-day delivery orders tend to be about 25% to 30% bigger baskets than in-club shops, he said. It charges a $15 fee for the deliveries, or members can pay $100 per year for unlimited same-day deliveries.</p><p>Still, Werner said BJ's biggest selling point \"comes back to value\" with its pledge to undercut typical grocery store prices by roughly 25%. Food and household essentials like laundry detergent drive about 85% of its sales, he said.</p></div><div><p>At Costco, the largest club player by size and stock price, have more than doubled over the last decade. Yet digital sales, while growing, account for only a small part of its overall sales.</p><p>About 8% of Costco's business comes from e-commerce, excluding third-party deliveries from Instacart and travel bookings, CEO Ron Vachris said on the company's May earnings call.</p><p>Over half of members have downloaded Costco's app, but its digital business is still in the early stages, Millerchip said on the company's earnings call. He said as Costco will keep adding customer-friendly features, such as making it easier to search for items or save a credit card to speed up checkout.</p><p>\"We still see it [e-commerce] as an area where we'd expect to outpace our overall growth,\" he said on its earnings call.</p></div><div><p>A customer pushes a shopping cart towards the entrance of a BJ's Wholesale Club Holdings Inc. location in Miami, Florida.</p><p>Scott McIntyre | Bloomberg | Getty Images</p></div><h2><a></a>Younger shoppers, trendier brands</h2><div><p>The retailers' membership counts reflect how the U.S. has become a club nation.</p><p>Costco had nearly 80 million paid household members globally as of the end of its most recent quarter, which ended in mid-May. BJ's, the smallest of the three club names, has grown to about 8 million members as of the most recently reported quarter, a 55% increase since it went public seven years ago.</p><p>Sam's Club does not disclose its membership total, but its membership income grew nearly 8% in the U.S. in the most recent quarter. And its gains inspired the retailer to pledge this spring that it would double its membership over the next eight to 10 years.</p><p>Yet that growth is coming from a different kind of member. Along with soccer moms and big families, it's drawn more Gen Z and millennial consumers. Those members include new homeowners, households without kids, and city dwellers who don't have mortgages or abundant pantry space.</p><p>Sam's Club's fastest growing customer category is Gen Z and millennials, which have accounted for half of its membership growth for more than two years, Sears said.</p></div><div><p>Customers look over clothing items displayed on April 18, 2025 at a Costco branch in Niantic, Connecticut. </p><p>Robert Nickelsberg | Getty Images</p></div><div><p>Costco's Millerchip told CNBC that its average age of members has fallen, and just under half of its new members that sign up each year are now under age 40. He said the club's popularity during the Covid pandemic, the ease of digital sign-ups and increased social media attention on Costco all contributed to that trend.</p><p>Customers between the ages of 25 and 34 are the fastest growing spending segment of the club channel when it comes to merchandise outside of the grocery department, according to market research firm Circana.</p><p>That age group's spending on general merchandise at clubs rose by 3% for January to July 2025 compared to the same period in the year prior, according to Circana, which tracks checkout data across retailers.</p><p>All three warehouse clubs have broadened their merchandise and bulked up digital options, particularly since the Covid pandemic, said Marshal Cohen, a chief industry advisor for Circana.</p><p>Along with lower-priced private label versions of items like olive oil and paper towels, clubs carry children's clothing and back-to-school supplies, sell giftable items like jewelry and offer lower-priced health and wellness items like hearing aids, contact lenses and vitamins. That's given shoppers more reasons to return to their stores and websites between stock-ups.</p><p>\"They're curating not only the brands better, but creating a better sense of adventure for the shopper,\" he said.</p><p>Plus, he said the \"great migration\" of younger Americans during the pandemic from smaller apartments in cities to bigger homes in the suburbs or rural areas created a new customer base.</p><p>The improved merchandise at clubs has caught the attention and ire of competitors as well. <span><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/LULU/\">Lululemon</a><span><span></span></span></span> <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2025/07/01/lululemon-costco-lawsuit.html\">filed a lawsuit</a> against Costco in late June, alleging that the company violated patents by selling lower-priced dupes of its athleisurewear including hoodies, jackets and pants.</p><p>Costco's CFO Millerchip declined to comment on the lawsuit.</p><p>Clubs have drawn both young and more established brands that want to get picked up by the retailers.</p><p>Wellness brand Frida, best known for popular baby supplies like the NoseFrida, is exploring how its products could be packaged and sold in a club, founder and CEO Chelsea Hirschhorn said. She said the club channel has become more appealing as it moves away from generic products and adds more modern brands.</p><p>For some members, including Patrick Bannon, club retailers' eye-catching assortment can be a danger to the wallet. The 29-year-old graduate student joined Costco about two years ago. At least every other month, he drives to a nearby Costco for a shopping trip — even though the drive can take 45 minutes in traffic and on weekend and evening visits, it can be tricky to \"move your cart more than an inch without running into somebody.\"</p><p>For Bannon, it takes creativity to squeeze bulk purchases into the cabinets, freezer and fridge space of the one-bedroom apartment in the Boston area that he rents with his girlfriend.</p><p>In his apartment, he has currently stashed away five different types of protein bars, two pounds of frozen vegetables, two one-gallon jugs of vegetable oil and three or four pounds of frozen chicken.</p><p>He signed up for Costco to buy cheaper groceries and staples like trash bags, but he's wound up purchasing giant bags of snacks, a new brand of cold brew coffee and even khaki pants.</p><p>\"You get to be a kid in the candy store again,\" he said. \"Except it's not all candy.\"</p></div></div>"

A gigawatt is a measure of power that is increasingly being used to describe the biggest clusters of AI chips. </p><p>Nvidia stock rose 3% during trading on Monday. </p><p>The partnership highlights how linked OpenAI and Nvidia are as two of the biggest drivers of the recent artificial intelligence boom. Demand for Nvidia's GPUs first started rising when OpenAI first released ChatGPT in 2022, and OpenAI still relies on Nvidia's AI chips, called GPUs, to develop its software and deploy it to users. </p><p>It also signals just how many Nvidia chips OpenAI will need in order to develop next-generation artificial intelligence that can do more than its current models. It also suggests that OpenAI will need increasing amounts of chips to serve its users, and said it had 700 million active weekly users on Monday. </p><p>\"This is monumental in size,\" CEO Jensen Huang told CNBC's Jon Fortt in an interview in San Jose on Monday alongside OpenAI CEO Sam Altman and OpenAI president Greg Brockman.</p><p>\"You should expect a lot from us in the coming months,\" OpenAI CEO Sam Altman said. \"There are three things that OpenAI has to do well: we have to do great Ai research, we have to make these products people want to use, and we have to figure out how to do this unprecedented infrastructure challenge.\" </p></div><h2><a></a>'A giant project'</h2><div><p>Huang said that the 10 gigawatts is equal to between 4 million and 5 million GPUS, which is what the company will ship in total this year and \"twice as much as last year.\"\"This is a giant project,\" he said.</p><p>In August, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang told investors on an earnings call that building one gigawatt of data center capacity costs between $50 billion and $60 billion, of which about $35 billion of those costs are for Nvidia chips and systems.</p><p>The companies said that the first phase of the investment will come online in the second half of 2026, using Nvidia's next-generation Vera Rubin systems. </p><p>Nvidia will join a roster of investors that valued OpenAI at $500 billion in a recent secondary round. Microsoft was one of OpenAI's early investors, and has strategic partnership with it to integrate OpenAI models into its cloud service, Azure, and Microsoft Office. Other OpenAI investors include SoftBank and Thrive Capital. </p><p>The companies said that the partnership will compliment the infrastructure work it is doing with Microsoft, Oracle, SoftBank, and its Stargate project. </p><p>Altman referred to Nvidia and Microsoft as \"passive\" investors and two of the company's \"most critical partners\" in the CNBC interview.</p><p>Huang said Nvidia's investment is \"additive to everything that's been announced and contracted.\"</p><p>He indicated to Fortt that it's in addition to anything the company has told Wall Street about its financial expectations.</p><p>While this investment dwarfs Nvidia's prior commitments, the chipmaker has been opening its wallet of late to put funds in many companies in and around the industry.</p><p>Last week, Nvidia said it's <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2025/09/18/nvidias-huang-calls-5-billion-intel-stake-an-incredible-investment.html\">taken a $5 billion stake</a> in <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/INTC/\">Intel</a> and announced that the two companies will collaborate on AI processors.
