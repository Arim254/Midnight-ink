The White House has been actively promoting artificial intelligence and domestic manufacturing, with recent announcements including a plan to reduce regulation of artificial intelligence and support for leading AI chipmakers.

Google was found to hold an illegal monopoly in its core market of internet search last year. Deciding on the penalties this week, U.S. District Judge Amit Mehta <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2025/09/02/google-antitrust-search-ruling.html\">ruled</a> against the most severe consequences proposed by the DOJ, causing shares of the search company to jump.</p><p>\"I'm glad it's over,\" Pichai responded to Trump, causing an eruption of laughter from the other table guests.</p><p>\"It's a long process,\" Pichai said. \"Appreciate that your administration had a constructive dialogue, and we were able to get it to some resolution.\" </p><p>\"Right,\" Trump replied.</p><p>\"The AI moment is one of the most transformative moments any of us have ever seen or will see in our lifetimes, so making sure the U.S. is at the forefront — and I think your administration is investing a lot,\" Pichai said. \"Already the AI action plan under your leadership I think is a great start, and we look forward to working together. And thanks for your leadership.\"</p><p>The plan Pichai referred to is the administration's \"<a href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Americas-AI-Action-Plan.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">Winning the AI Race: America's AI Action Plan</a>,\" launched in July, which claims to identify 90 federal policy actions across three pillars: the acceleration of innovation, building of artificial intelligence infrastructure and leadership in international diplomacy and security. Part of that plan includes a <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2025/07/24/no-woke-ai-in-washington-says-trump-as-he-launches-ai-action-plan.html\">July executive order</a> that says AI models should not incorporate \"Woke AI\" or \"ideological dogmas such as DEI,\" meaning diversity, equity and inclusion.  </p><p>Google is also in discussions with Trump's lawyers for an ongoing <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2021/07/07/trump-says-he-is-suing-facebook-google-twitter-dorsey-zuckerberg-pichai.html\">lawsuit</a> that the president filed more than four years ago, accusing the online video platform YouTube of unlawful censorship. The lawsuit stemmed from the suspension of Trump's accounts on social media sites after the Jan. 6 U.S. Capitol riot.</p><p>Earlier Thursday, Pichai attended the White House \"AI Education Taskforce\" event hosted by First Lady Melania Trump.</p><p>Trump interrupted Pichai's Thursday evening response to say \"Biden was the one who prosecuted that lawsuit, you know that right?\" Trump said, referring to the search monopoly case.</p><p>The search case was brought by the DOJ while Trump was in office during his first term. Pichai did not correct him.</p><p><strong>WATCH: </strong><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/video/2025/09/03/alphabet-antitrust-ruling-the-dream-scenario-for-google-says-wedbushs-dan-ives.html\">Alphabet antitrust ruling the 'dream scenario' for Google, says Wedbush's Dan Ives</a></p></div><div><p><img src=\"https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/108193895-17569274411756927438-41480201527-1080pnbcnews.jpg?v=1756927440&amp;w=750&amp;h=422&amp;vtcrop=y\" alt=\"Alphabet antitrust ruling the 'dream scenario' for Google, says Wedbush's Dan Ives\" /><span></span><span><div><p><span>watch now</span><span></span></p></div></span></p></div></div>"

Ford said its most popular models are the Platinum, Tremor and King Ranch, at the higher end of the lineup. </p><p>The automaker unveiled the latest model of the Expedition in October, and it started shipping the SUV about five months ago. It's assembled at the company's Kentucky Truck Plant.</p><p>Ford's main rival in the segment has long been GM, with its Chevrolet Tahoe, Chevrolet Suburban and GMC Yukon vehicles. But new competitors such as the Jeep Wagoneer from <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/STLA/\">Stellantis</a> as well as large three-row crossovers from Kia and <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/HYMLF/\">Hyundai</a> have also come to market.</p></div></div>"

That's below the consensus forecast of 75,000 from economists polled by Dow Jones, and marks a significant slowdown from the revised gain of 106,000 seen in the prior month.</p><p>\"The year started with strong job growth, but that momentum has been whipsawed by uncertainty,\" said Nela Richardson, ADP's chief economist, in a press release.</p><p>Richardson pointed to rising worries from consumers, labor shortages and disruptions tied to artificial intelligence as potential drivers of this decrease in growth.</p><p>Jobs tied to trade, transportation and utilities saw particular weakness in August, with the group losing 17,000 roles on net, according to the ADP. Education and health services followed, recording a decline of 12,000 jobs.</p><p>But those losses were offset in part by a boom in the leisure and hospitality industry, which added 50,000 jobs in the month.</p><p>Wage growth maintained the same pace in August. Those staying in their roles saw their pay rise 4.4% year over year, while job changes recorded a 7.1% increase during the same period.</p><p>Thursday's ADP report adds to an already concerning picture of the labor market.</p><p>Jobless claims increased to 237,000, up 8,000 from the prior week and above estimates, per data also published Thursday morning. The Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey registered <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2025/09/03/job-opening-data-falls-to-levels-rarely-seen-since-pandemic.html\">one of its worst levels</a> for job openings in July since 2020, according to government figures released Wednesday.</p><p>Now, attention will home in on the all-important jobs report slated for Friday morning. Economists expect the official government report to show 75,000 nonfarm payrolls added in August, about even with the prior month, according to estimates collected by Dow Jones. Economists predict the unemployment rate inched up to 4.3% from 4.2%.</p><p>Labor market worries have pushed traders to build on already hefty bets that the Federal Reserve will cut rates at its meeting later this month. There's now a <a href=\"https://www.cmegroup.com/markets/interest-rates/cme-fedwatch-tool.html\" target=\"_blank\">97.4% chance</a> of a rate cut at the September gathering, up from 96.6% a day ago, according to the CME's FedWatch Tool.</p><p><em>— CNBC's John Melloy contributed reporting.</em></p></div></div>"

It said it expected tariffs to hit its full-year profits by $240 million.</p><p>Lululemon said it expects full fiscal-year earnings of $12.77 to $12.97 per share, well below Wall Street estimates of $14.45 per share. It also anticipates full-year revenue of $10.85 billion to $11 billion, compared with Wall Street expectations of $11.18 billion.</p><p>\"We are facing yet another shift today within the industry related to tariffs and the cost of doing business,\" CEO Calvin McDonald said on a call with analysts. \"The increased rates and removal of the de minimis provisions have played a large part in our guidance reduction for the year.\"</p><p>Here's how the company did for its second quarter compared with what Wall Street was expecting, based on a survey of analysts by LSEG:</p><ul><li><strong>Earnings per share:</strong> $3.10 vs. $2.88 expected</li><li><strong>Revenue:</strong> $2.53 billion vs. $2.54 billion expected</li></ul><p>Shares of the company sank more than 12% after the bell Thursday. The stock is down more than 45% this year.</p><p>Programming note: Lululemon CEO Calvin McDonald will be interviewed exclusively on CNBC's \"Squawk on the Street\" on Friday.</p><p>The company reported second-quarter net income of $370.9 million, or $3.10 per share, compared to $392.92 million, or $3.15 per share, in the year-ago period. Gross margin decreased 1.1 percentage points to 58.5%, and operating margin decreased 210 basis points to 20.7%.</p><p>Chief Financial Officer Meghan Frank said on the call that the removal of the de minimis exemption, which excluded some smaller shipments from tariffs, will significantly affect the company, representing roughly 1.7 percentage points of the 2.2 percentage-point tariff-related decline in profit expected for the year.</p><p>Same-store sales in the Americas were down 4%. Overall comparable sales increased just 1% compared to Wall Street estimates of 2.2%. Lululemon said it added 14 net new stores during the second quarter, bringing its total to 784 stores.</p><p>\"My view is that it's now time to reset many of our practices related to how we develop and create the range of products that will fuel the next phase of our growth,\" McDonald said Thursday. \"We have seen that when we get our product right, everything else can follow.\"</p><p>Lululemon projects third-quarter revenue will come in between $2.47 billion and $2.50 billion compared to Wall Street estimates of $2.57 billion. The company said it expects earnings per share in the next quarter to come in between $2.18 and $2.23 per share, compared to an estimate of $2.93 per share.</p><p>McDonald said on the Thursday call that he believes the company has let its product lifecycles \"run too long,\" particularly in its lounge and social categories.</p><p>\"We have become too predictable within our casual offerings and missed opportunities to create new trends,\" he said, identifying those issues as the \"root causes\" of the company's product challenges in the U.S.</p><p>\"Our lounge and social product offerings have become stale and have not been resonating with guests,\" McDonald added.</p><p>To regain its U.S. momentum, McDonald said the company plans to increase its new styles from 23% of its overall assortment to 35% next spring, and improve its fast-track design capabilities. He said Lululemon will not make any short-term decisions that \"could hurt or damage\" the brand in the long term.</p><p>\"We are not satisfied with the results for the quarter, and we know our brand can and will perform better than these results,\" McDonald said.</p></div>"

    "body": "<div><div><p>Open AI CEO Sam Altman speaks at the annual Snowflake Summit in San Francisco, California on June 02, 2025. </p><p>Justin Sullivan | Getty Images News | Getty Images</p></div><div><p>OpenAI is rapidly expanding its presence in India — one of the key markets for its flagship ChatGPT product.</p><p>India is an appealing destination for U.S. tech giants, with companies ranging from <span><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/GOOGL/\">Google</a><span><span></span></span></span> to <span><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/META/\">Meta</a><span><span></span></span></span> betting on its huge — and young — population over recent years.</p><p>OpenAI CEO Sam Altman visited the country in February this year and met with the country's IT Minister Ashwini Vaishnaw to discuss collaboration. During the visit, Altman said India was OpenAI's second-largest market by number of users.</p><p>He has subsequently said that AI adoption in India is \"amazing to watch.\"</p><p>\"We love to see the explosion of creativity--india is outpacing the world,\" he <a href=\"https://x.com/sama/status/1907451374809624813\" target=\"_blank\">said on X</a> earlier this year.</p><p>India is one of ChatGPT's fastest-growing markets globally, Nick Patience, practice lead for AI at tech research and analysis firm Futurum Group, told CNBC. \"OpenAI's India focus is a strategic move to gain a competitive edge,\" he added.</p><p>Here's a rundown of how OpenAI is expanding in India.</p></div><h2><a></a>ChatGPT explosion</h2><div><p>ChatGPT, OpenAI's core product, has seen strong growth in India. The app was downloaded 10.2 million times in India in August, a huge jump from the 2.5 million downloads seen during the same month last year, according to analytics firm Appfigures.</p><p>Since its launch, ChatGPT has 111 million downloads in India, ahead of its 80 million downloads in the U.S, Appfigures data shows.</p><p>Downloads do not necessarily equal daily or monthly users, but the figures emphasise OpenAI's growth trajectory in the country.</p><p>The download numbers are also far ahead of rivals, including Google's Gemini and Anthropic's Claude. The closest challenger was Perplexity, Appfigures said, which had 6.4 million downloads in August.</p></div><h2><a></a>India-specific product</h2><div><p>User spending on ChatGPT has been increasing. To date, Indian users have spent $21.3 million on ChatGPT, Appfigures data shows. In comparison, U.S. users have spent $784 million.</p><p>That underlines the fact that while the number of users in India is huge, it remains a price-sensitive market.</p><p>To address this, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2025/08/19/openai-chases-growth-india-with-cheapest-plan-at-chatgpt-plan-at-399-rupees-global-rollout.html\">OpenAI in August launched ChatGPT Go</a>, a low-cost 399-rupees-($4.53)-a-month plan for its AI app.</p></div><div><p><img src=\"https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/108188860-17557434751755743472-41276517400-1080pnbcnews.jpg?v=1755743474&amp;w=750&amp;h=422&amp;vtcrop=y\" alt=\"ChatGPT Go launches in India: OpenAI must forge local partnerships to increase adoption\" /><span></span><span><div><p><span>watch now</span><span></span></p></div></span></p></div><p>\"It's a classic wedge strategy to capture a price-sensitive market and build a user base that will be difficult for local players to dislodge later,\" Futurum Group's Patience said of the strategy.</p><h2><a></a>Infrastructure and hiring</h2><div><p>According to <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-09-01/openai-plans-india-data-center-in-major-stargate-expansion\" target=\"_blank\">Bloomberg</a>, OpenAI is scouting a location in India for a data center with at least 1-gigawatt capacity. The facility will be part of OpenAI's Stargate-branded infrastructure push, Bloomberg said this week, although CNBC was unable to verify the report.</p><p>The ChatGPT developer said last month that it would open a local office in the market and is currently advertising three sales roles in India.</p><p>It also announced last month an education program in India that will include funding for research and provide half a million ChatGPT licenses for educators and students across the country.</p></div><h2><a></a>India challenges</h2><div><p>While India doesn't have a home-grown artificial intelligence company as big as OpenAI, there are some challengers in the form of domestic startups, including Sarvam AI and Krutrim, and other American tech giants like Google and Meta.</p><p>Continued geopolitical tensions <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2025/09/02/trump-india-us-china-tariffs-trade.html\">between the U.S. and India over trade</a>, however, have the potential to cause complications if there's any backlash from New Delhi against American tech firms. </p><p>OpenAI is also locked in a legal battle with Asian News International in India, which has accused the ChatGPT developer of using copyrighted material illegally. It's a closely-watched case in the country for how copyright laws apply in the AI era.</p><p>\"OpenAI's success in India is not guaranteed and depends heavily on its ability to navigate these legal and political hurdles,\" Futurum Group's Patience said.</p><p>\"While the Indian market is vast, its diversity in languages and user needs presents challenges. OpenAI's ability to deliver a truly localized product and its long-term impact on India's AI talent remain uncertain.\"</p></div></div>"

Numerous studies have demonstrated that shots using mRNA technology, including Covid vaccines from <span><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/PFE/\">Pfizer</a><span><span></span></span></span> and <span><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/MRNA/\">Moderna</a><span><span></span></span></span>, are safe and effective, and serious side effects have happened in extremely rare cases.</p><p>Sen. Michael Bennet, D-Colo., noted that the committee member, Dr. Retsef Levi, has said that evidence is mounting that mRNA vaccines cause \"serious harm, including death, especially among young people,\" apparently referring to <a href=\"https://x.com/RetsefL/status/1619945525670981632\" target=\"_blank\">a post pinned on Levi's X account</a>. Kennedy appointed Levi to the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices, which advises the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention on vaccine recommendations and insurance coverage.</p><p>Kennedy said he wasn't aware of Levi's comments, but added, \"I agree with it.\"</p><p>He also claimed that anyone could get a Covid booster shot, while also acknowledging that access \"depends on the state\" and that the government no longer recommends the vaccines for healthy people.</p><p>The Food and Drug Administration approved a fresh round of Covid shots with new limits, only clearing them for adults aged 65 and older and people with a medical condition that puts them at risk of a severe illness. The CDC and its vaccine panel will decide who to recommend the shots to later this month.</p><p>\"I'm not taking them away from people,\" Kennedy said, referring to the vaccines.</p><p>But Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., argued that not everyone can walk into a pharmacy and get a Covid shot now.</p><p>The FDA's new limits have complicated Covid shot access in the U.S., which now depends on a patient's age and risk level, laws and policies in their state, insurance coverage, and health-care provider. Pending CDC guidance,<a href=\"https://www.cbsnews.com/news/cvs-walgreens-limit-access-covid-vaccines-required-state-guidelines/\" target=\"_blank\"> some pharmacies</a> have added prescription requirements for Covid vaccines in certain states.</p><p>\"You clearly are taking away vaccines,\" she said after a prolonged shouting match with Kennedy.</p></div><div><h2>More CNBC health coverage</h2><div><ul><li><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2025/05/05/from-cockroach-award-to-big-board-hinge-health-unlikely-path-to-ipo.html\">From ‘Cockroach Award’ to the Big Board: Hinge Health’s unlikely path to IPO</a></li><li><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2025/05/22/unitedhealth-news-backlash-stock-price.html\">How UnitedHealthcare became the face of America’s health insurance frustrations</a></li><li><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2025/05/22/apple-hospital-devices.html\">When 20,000 devices were paralyzed by a bad update, a Georgia health system turned to Apple</a></li></ul></div></div><div><p>Kennedy's comments before the Senate Finance Committee come after he repeatedly <a href=\"https://www.finance.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/responses_to_questions_for_the_record_to_robert_f_kennedy_jrpart2.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">promised the panel</a> in January that he would do nothing as HHS secretary that makes it more difficult or discourages people from taking vaccines. Since then, he has canceled <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2025/08/05/rfk-jr-pulls-500-million-in-funding-for-vaccine-development.html\">funding</a> for mRNA shot development and made other vaccine policy changes that could limit access to immunizations, including gutting the CDC vaccine panel and dropping Covid shot recommendations for certain groups.</p><p>His comments also follow a leadership shake-up at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The White House last week fired CDC Director Susan Monarez, and four senior agency officials resigned shortly after, with some of them citing the politicization of the agency and a threat to public health. In <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/opinion/robert-f-kennedy-jr-the-cdc-and-me-b4ca2eaa\" target=\"_blank\">an opinion piece on Thursday</a>, Monarez accused Kennedy of \"a deliberate effort to weaken America's public-health system and vaccine protections.\"</p><p>White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt posted on X in support of Kennedy on Thursday, writing that he \"is taking flak because he's over the target\" and saying Democrats were attacking the Trump administration's \"commonsense effort.\" </p><p>Kennedy touted skepticism around Covid vaccines, despite evidence of their safety and effectiveness. </p><p>\"We were told again and again the vaccines would prevent transmission, they prevent infection. It wasn't true. They knew it from the start,\" Kennedy said.  </p><p>He also said he does not know how many people died of Covid and whether the vaccines prevented deaths from the virus.</p><p>\"I would like to see the data and talk about the data,\" Kennedy said.</p><p>But data is readily available from dozens of studies. <a href=\"https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2837831#:~:text=COVID%2D19%20vaccinations%20prevented%20approximately,a%20comparative%20effectiveness%20study%20found.\" target=\"_blank\">One paper in August</a> estimates that Covid vaccines saved more than 2 million lives, mostly among older adults, worldwide between 2020 and October 2024. </p><p>The <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/covid/vaccines/benefits.html#:~:text=Reduce%20your%20risk%20for%20critical,your%20risk%20for%20Long%20COVID\" target=\"_blank\">CDC website</a> also says that Covid vaccines from the 2023 to 2024 season reduced the risk of severe illness from Covid by almost 70% in the first two months after vaccination in adults ages 18 and older, with protection gradually declining over time.</p><p>Those shots also decreased the risk of hospitalization due to Covid by around 50% in the first two months of vaccination in that same population. The Covid vaccines showed similar benefits in older adults.</p><p>Kennedy also defended his decision to fire all 17 previous members of the CDC vaccine panel, saying he didn't politicize the committee.</p><p>\"What we did is we got rid of the conflicts of interest. ... We depoliticized and put great scientists on it from a very diverse group,\" the HHS secretary said. \"They are very, very pro-vaccine.\"</p><p>But <a href=\"https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/article-abstract/2837784\" target=\"_blank\">a new analysis</a> published last month from USC researchers found that conflicts of interest on that panel had been at \"historic lows for years\" before Kennedy restacked it with new members, some of whom are widely known vaccine critics.</p><p><em>Correction: Kennedy testified before the Senate Finance Committee on Thursday.
