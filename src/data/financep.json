Examples including Nicolaus Copernicus who theorized the sun was at the center of the universe and other planets move round it.</p><p>Wolf explained a couple of issues with chatbots right now. The first is that these products like ChatGPT and others often agree or align with the person prompting it. Think back to if you've asked a chatbot a prompt and it will tell you how interesting or great that question is.</p><p>The second is that the models underpinning these chatbots are designed to \"predict the most likely next token\" or \"word\" in a sentence.</p><p>However, he noted two key traits of scientists. The first is that scientists who make major breakthroughs are often contrarian and question what others are saying.</p><p>\"The scientist is not trying to predict the most likely next word. He's trying to predict this very novel thing that's actually surprisingly unlikely, but actually is true,\" Wolf said.</p><p>The Hugging Face co-founder has been thinking about this topic for the last few months. His interest was sparked after he read an essay penned by Anthropic's Amodei, who posited that \"AI-enabled biology and medicine will allow us to compress the progress that human biologists would have achieved over the next 50-100 years into 5-10 years.\"</p><p>That got Wolf thinking about the state of AI and how this won't be possible, in his view, with the current crop of models.</p><p>Wolf said that these chatbots and tools will likely be used as a sort of \"co-pilot for a scientist\" where they are used for research to help the human generate new ideas.</p><p>To some extent, this has been happening already. Google DeepMind's AlphaFold product has helped to analyze protein structures which the company has promised could aid scientists in discovering new drugs.</p><p>But there are some new startups that are hoping to take AI one step further into being able to make scientific breakthroughs, including Lila Sciences and FutureHouse.</p></div></div>"

    "body": "<div><div><p>Qian Zhang has lived in Lisbon since 2023.</p></div><div><p>When Qian Zhang boarded a flight from Shanghai to Boston at age 18, she thought she was heading toward the \"best version\" of her life. It was 2009, during President Barack Obama's first term, when the U.S. economy was rebounding and opportunities for well-educated workers seemed plentiful.</p><p>She was bound for Dartmouth College, a top choice for many Chinese students, and later found her way to Harvard Business School.</p><p>Qian embraced the American dream: the promise of equal opportunity, a country that rewards talent and hard work, and a place where global citizens like her could belong.</p><p>By her early 30s, she was a vice president at a global firm in Boston, earning six figures a year. But behind the glittering resume was a reality defined by her immigration status.</p><p>Like hundreds of thousands of foreign professionals, Qian lived on an H-1B work visa — the document that tethered her job, her ability to travel, and her entire sense of security to the grace of her employer. \"Your entire life is tied to your job,\" she said. \"If you lose the job, you lose the visa. If you lose the visa, you lose the country.\"</p><p>At first, she pushed aside her anxieties. She bought property, built friendships, and told herself she was no different from her American colleagues.</p><p>But each year brought fresh reminders: vacations cut short to fly back to China for visa paperwork, discreet job searches because changing employers required fresh visa sponsorships, and the constant fear that one misstep could unravel her life. \"The H-1B made me feel like a second-class citizen,\" she said.</p></div><blockquote><div><p>Your entire life is tied to your job. If you lose the job, you lose the [H-1B] visa. If you lose the visa, you lose the country.</p><div><p>Qian Zhang</p><p>Former H-1B visa holder</p></div></div></blockquote><div><p>In 2022, four months after her promotion to vice president, Qian quit. A year later, she packed her life into suitcases again. This time, she was leaving for good.</p><p>Now, the 35-year-old resides in Portugal's capital, Lisbon, with her partner, Swiss artist-filmmaker Tobias Madison, and their newborn child. The Portuguese sun and slower pace, she says, have begun to heal the trauma of a decade in America, where every promotion, vacation and romantic entanglement felt shadowed by the same fear: what happens if her visa disappears?</p><h3>Chasing the dream — and the visa</h3><p>The H-1B visa fundamentally shaped her career path, Qian said. \"Only a handful of sectors even sponsor it — finance, tech, consulting, law and medicine. You don't have many options,\" she said.</p><p>She had done several stints in Boston, from strategy consulting to business development at a tech firm, before rising to become a vice president at a consumer products company.</p><p>\"When the economy is strong, you may have a chance to compete on an equal footing with other job seekers. But when the economy is bad, you're the last pick, if you're picked at all.\"</p><p>Her anxiety deepened during President Donald Trump's first term, when visa processing delays and audits rose. Even Qian, who seemed to embody the type of high-skilled worker the U.S. claimed to prize, felt vulnerable. \"I had a conflict at work once and thought, if I get fired, I might have to leave immediately,\" she recalled. \"I was so anxious I actually crashed my car.\"</p><p>The country was no longer the one she entered in 2009, she said. Reading the comments under news articles about immigration was sobering. \"The America I went to believed in openness, in welcoming talent,\" she said. \"The America I left was divided, suspicious, anxious.\"</p><p>Her disillusionment echoed a broader trend of slowing international student enrollment in the U.S. in recent years.</p><p>\"America used to be the dream,\" she said. \"Now people like me look elsewhere.\"</p><h3>A new chapter</h3><p>Lisbon, with its tiled streets and Atlantic sunsets, is a world away from Boston and New York. Qian and her partner are renovating a farmhouse in the Portuguese countryside. She is writing a book and exploring creative projects. Life is slower, cheaper, freer, she said.</p><p>Portugal has been a hotspot for digital nomads, luring foreign remote workers with friendly visa policies, a better quality of life, and a lower cost of living.</p><p>Her visa process in Portugal, she said, was \"the easiest of my life.\" When she pressed her lawyer for what could go wrong, the lawyer reassured her: \"Don't worry, we are not the U.S.\"</p></div><div><p>Qian Zhang has lived in Lisbon since 2023.</p></div><div><p>Her years in America gave her financial security — she graduated when the economy was strong, saved responsibly and invested prudently. That cushion allowed her to start over. \"I was lucky,\" she said. \"I caught the right wave.\"</p><p>Still, she is ambivalent about the country that shaped her adulthood. \"I used to see everything through the lens of the U.S.,\" she said. \"Now I see it's not the center of the world.\"</p><p>She hopes the U.S. can rediscover the openness that once drew her in. \"I want America to become the America we believed in,\" she said. \"Open. Confident. Free. Not this fearful, closed-off version of itself.\"</p><p>Until then, she said, more people like her will keep leaving. \"Maybe,\" she added with a small smile, \"America needs us more than we need America.\"</p><p><em><strong>Are you ready to buy a house?</strong> Take Smarter by CNBC Make It's new online course </em><a href=\"https://smarter.cnbcmakeit.com/p/how-to-buy-your-first-home?utm_source=cnbc&utm_medium=makeitarticle&utm_campaign=bottom\" target=\"_blank\"><em>How to Buy Your First Home</em></a><em>.

The department manages the government's $1.6 trillion student loan portfolio and disburses funding and grants to schools and individuals, along with other duties related to K-12 and higher education.</p><p>Here's what current borrowers, college students and those applying for federal aid need to know.</p></div><h2><a></a>Which Department of Education functions are impacted by the shutdown?</h2><div><p>During the shutdown, the Department of Education will pause new grantmaking activities and investigations into civil rights violations, according to the contingency plan. </p><p>But since most grants are disbursed over the summer, the impact to institutions and individual recipients should be minimal, the department says.</p></div><h2><a></a>Can I still apply for federal financial aid?</h2><div><p>Yes. The remaining Department of Education employees will ensure federally mandated programs like the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2025/09/08/fafsa-officially-opens-october-1-but-you-can-apply-for-aid-now.html\">Free Application for Federal Student Aid</a> and aid and loan disbursements can continue to operate, according to the department's contingency plan.<strong> </strong>The plan also explicitly states that FAFSA processing should not be impacted by the shutdown.</p><p>The FAFSA, the form millions of students and families need to submit to be considered for federal grants and loans, as well as institutional aid from their college, opened on Sept. 24 this year, ahead of its official Oct. 1 <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2025/09/08/fafsa-officially-opens-october-1-but-you-can-apply-for-aid-now.html\">opening date</a>.</p></div><h2><a></a>Do I still need to make student loan payments?</h2><div><p>Yes. Despite the shutdown, federal student loan <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2025/02/21/what-happens-to-student-loans-if-department-of-education-is-eliminated.html\">payments will still be due</a>.</p><p><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2025/08/12/where-borrowers-are-most-at-risk-of-student-loan-default.html\">Federal student loan borrowers</a> mainly interact with their loan servicers to make payments, change payment plans and resolve issues. While the federal government oversees those servicers, most borrowers shouldn't have issues getting the assistance they need during the shutdown unless they have a problem with their servicer.</p><p>\"The Education Department itself is not servicing your loan. You're paying your loan each month to a loan servicing company,\" Kate Wood, a lending expert at NerdWallet, tells CNBC Make It. \"Your servicer is definitely remaining open, and they are definitely collecting payments.\"'</p></div><h2><a></a>What can I do if I have an issue with my loans?</h2><div><p>Reaching out to your servicer if you're having trouble paying your loans or have questions about your account is still \"generally your best bet,\" Wood says.</p><p>Customer service had already slowed down at the Department of Education due to the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2025/07/18/how-department-of-education-layoffs-will-affect-student-loan-borrowers.html\">mass layoffs at the agency</a> earlier this year. So while it may still be difficult to get in touch with the department for those who need to, that's not necessarily a result of the shutdown. </p><p>Students who are in the process of getting aid or loans should connect with their school counselor or financial aid office if they need assistance with the FAFSA.</p><p><em><strong>Want to be your own boss?</strong> Sign up for CNBC's new online course, </em><a href=\"https://smarter.cnbcmakeit.com/p/how-to-start-a-business-for-first-time-founders?utm_source=cnbc&utm_medium=makeitarticle&utm_campaign=bottom\" target=\"_blank\"><em>How To Start A Business: For First-Time Founders</em></a><em>.

Economists surveyed by Dow Jones had been looking for an increase of 45,000.</p><p>In addition to the drop in September, the August payrolls number was revised to a loss of 3,000 from an initially reported increase of 54,000.</p><p>The report comes as the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2025/10/01/government-shutdown-trump-live-updates.html\">funding impasse in Washington, D.C.</a>, has led to the first government closure since late 2018 into early 2019. Failing a deal over the next two days, the Bureau of Labor Statistics' nonfarm payrolls report for September will not be released, nor will the Labor Department put out the weekly jobless claims count on Thursday. The last time the BLS payrolls report was delayed was in 2013.</p><p>Federal Reserve officials count on the payrolls releases as they make decisions on interest rates. The Fed next meets Oct. 28-29, meaning there won't be another payrolls report before then.</p><p>ADP's count, then, takes on added significance as markets widely expect the central bank to cut another quarter point off its key borrowing rate.</p><p>Job losses spread across sectors during September, offset by a 33,000 increase in education and health services as schools reopened and health care continued its long streak of hiring.</p><p>Elsewhere, leisure and hospitality, a key sector for consumer demand, saw a loss of 19,000 as vacation season wound down. The other services category posted a drop of 16,000, while professional and business services was off 13,000, trade, transportation and utilities declined by 7,000, and construction lost 5,000.</p><p>On a broad scale, service providers decreased 28,000 and goods producers shed 3,000. Businesses with fewer than 50 employees lost 40,000, while companies with 500 or more employees added 33,000.</p><p>\"Despite the strong economic growth we saw in the second quarter, this month's release further validates<br />what we've been seeing in the labor market, that U.S. employers have been cautious with hiring,\" ADP's chief economist, Nela Richardson, said.</p><p>The U.S. economy did expand 3.8% in the second quarter and is on pace for a 3.9% gain in the third quarter, according to the Atlanta Fed's GDPNow data tracker.</p><p>However, concerns have increased over the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2025/09/23/powell-says-slowing-labor-market-prompted-rate-cut-sees-challenging-situation-ahead.html\">state of the labor market</a>, even with the unemployment rate at a relatively low 4.3%.</p><p>\"My baseline outlook doesn't see the labor market softening much further – but there are risks,\" Boston Fed President Susan Collins said Tuesday. \"In particular, I see some increased risk that labor demand may fall significantly short of supply, leading to a more meaningful and unwelcome increase in the unemployment rate.\"</p><p>The consensus view for September was a nonfarm payrolls gain of 51,000 in the BLS report, which unlike ADP includes government jobs.</p><p>Even with the slowdown in hiring, wages in September grew 4.5% on an annual basis, little changed from August, ADP said.
