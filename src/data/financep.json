    "body": "<div><div><p>Companies are expecting to incur more costs as a result of poorly implemented autonomous systems.</p><p>Shapecharge | E+ | Getty Images</p></div><div><p>Artificial intelligence capabilities are developing rapidly and companies globally are frantically trying to keep up and implement AI tools, but there are consequences to sloppy execution.</p><p>In fact, 79% of companies globally expect to incur an \"AI debt\" as a result of poorly implemented autonomous tools, according to a new report by<a href=\"https://assets.asana.biz/m/10543e5e3bcb38f5/original/2025-Global-State-of-AI-at-Work.pdf\" target=\"_blank\"> Asana on the State of AI at Work</a> which surveyed over 9,000 knowledge workers across the U.S., U.K., Australia, Germany, and Japan.</p><p>The report highlighted that companies are unprepared and lack the infrastructure and oversight required to foster a smooth collaboration between human employees and autonomous <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2025/09/24/generative-ai-spending-investment-bubble.html\">AI agents</a>. Differing from generative AI, agents act independently, can initiate actions, and recall previous work they performed. Some examples include <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2025/01/23/openai-operator-ai-agent-can-automate-tasks-like-vacation-planning.html\">OpenAI's Operator</a> and Anthropic's Claude.</p><p>AI debt is the cost of not implementing nascent autonomous systems correctly, Mark Hoffman, an expert at Asana's Work Innovation Lab, told CNBC Make It.</p><p>\"Those costs could be money costs. They could also be lost time, which relates to money. It could also be a lot of things that you have to undo, which is costly from a financial standpoint. It burns people out to have to do it. It's all of the costs associated with poor implementation,\" Hoffman said.</p><p>The report outlined that the debt could manifest as security risks, poor data quality, low impact AI agents which will waste time and resources for human employees, and a management skills gap.</p><p>Hoffman said this is not an exhaustive list and the \"debt\" could look like a bunch of code created by AI that doesn't work right or AI-generated content that nobody is using.</p><p>New research from BetterUp Labs and Stanford Social Media Lab even found that 40% of desk workers in the U.S. have received <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2025/09/23/ai-generated-workslop-is-destroying-productivity-and-teams-researchers-say.html\">AI-generated \"workslop,\"</a> which the researchers defined as content that looks good but lacks any substance.</p></div><div><p><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2025/09/23/ai-generated-workslop-is-destroying-productivity-and-teams-researchers-say.html\"><img src=\"https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/108202475-1758579102271-gettyimages-700712909-bld240699.jpeg?v=1758579133&w=160&h=90\" /></a></p></div><div><p>It's created almost two hours of extra work for people who encountered it, a $186 invisible tax per month, and a $9 million hit to productivity in a year, per the research.</p><p>\"There's large investment going into this space right now, and ultimately it's a question of whether those investments will pay off,\" Hoffman said.</p><p>Henry Ajder, founder of AI consulting firm Latent Space Advisory, and an advisor to the U.K. government, Meta, and AI video startup Synthesia, emphasized the need for thoughtful implementation and structures.</p><p>\"People who are CTOs or innovation officers, the good ones I've worked with, the ones who I think I did the best position to succeed with it, they aren't sugar coating the disruption that this is going to cost ... as with any kind of fundamental rework, you are going to have problems, you're gonna have bumps in the road,\" Ajder said in an interview.</p></div><h2><a></a>'It's not a magical silver bullet'</h2><div><p>Asana's report found that despite AI adoption surging to 70% in 2025 from 52% in 2024, workers are also facing higher levels of digital burnout.</p><p>Digital exhaustion increased to 84% in 2025 from 75% the prior year, while unmanageable workloads also rose to 77%, per the report.</p><p>Mona Mourshed, founding global CEO of Generation, a U.S.-based employment organization, told CNBC that despite companies rolling out AI tools and encouraging the use of it, workers are still struggling.</p><p>\"The core reason that they're struggling, and we know this from also talking to our own alumni, is that the use case for how and why are you supposed to use this AI tool in the flow of your work is often missing,\" Mourshed said.</p><p>\"Without a clear understanding of what is the use case that's going to make this particular task better, faster, cheaper ... that's what leads to the exhaustion, because you don't know what the intended outcome is,\" she added.</p><p>Mourshed noted that companies are investing in AI in the hopes that overnight work will be performed better, faster and cheaper, but they aren't offering the necessary training or guidelines to enable improvements.</p><p>\"It's not a magical silver bullet, and all of a sudden it does everything you want once you install it ... it's going to be a much more painful journey to get to those benefits than companies that have thought it through.\"</p><p>AI expert Ajder said the correct strategy is carefully testing AI use and building infrastructure around it rather than rushing into the race unprepared.</p><p>\"You don't start by just embedding, you start by piloting, you start by scoping, by sandboxing, by trialing these systems,\" he said.</p><p>This includes everything from the correct training for employees, to thinking about the kind of AI models the business might need. It's much harder to respond to mistakes or malfunctions when there's no procedure in place.</p><p>\"So I'm not saying that you can't take risk thoughtfully when it comes to using AI, but it has to be calculated and it has to be scoped,\" Ajder said.</p></div></div>"

    "body": "<div><div><p>In 2015, I packed up my life in Austin, Texas and<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2024/12/07/i-help-americans-move-abroad-key-steps-to-take-before-you-go.html\"> moved to Madrid</a>. I was 35 and it wasn't my first attempt. I had spent more than a decade dreaming, trying, and failing to make Spain home.</p><p>Since then, I've built a life in Spain and created <a href=\"https://shehitrefresh.com/\" target=\"_blank\">She Hit Refresh</a>, where I've helped hundreds of other women move abroad. </p><p>Along the way, I've experienced moments when my life in Europe felt like a movie. Like the time I stumbled upon a flamenco dancer in a hidden square, sipped wine at a Parisian café while the world passed by, or rode a Vespa past the Colosseum in Rome.</p><p>But these moments aren't everyday life, and not everything about moving abroad is just as you imagine it to be. Here are the six myths I hear most often about relocating.</p></div><h2><a></a>1. 'It's so cheap'</h2><div><p>Many countries can feel more affordable than the U.S., but living abroad is probably not as cheap as you think. Costs are rising around the world, especially housing prices. <a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/web/products-eurostat-news/w/ddn-20250704-4\" target=\"_blank\">House prices in the EU went up</a> 57.9% between 2010 and the first quarter of 2025, while rents increased by 27.8%. </p><p>My advice: Run the numbers based on <em>today's</em> reality, not outdated blog posts. And remember, what feels affordable to you on a U.S. salary may still be unaffordable for locals. Don't overpay. It only fuels the problem.</p></div><h2><a></a>2. 'Americans aren't welcome'</h2><div><p>The real pressure comes from tourism, not the relatively small number of Americans moving abroad. And while anti-tourism sentiment exists in crowded cities, it's not really about Americans, or even expats at all. The bigger issue is affordable housing — or, as I mentioned, the lack of it.</p><p>But smaller towns across Europe <em>want</em> new residents due to depopulation. If you're serious about integrating, consider looking beyond hotspots like Lisbon, Barcelona, or Amsterdam. </p><p>Regardless, in my own experience, when you learn the language, contribute, and connect, you'll usually be <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2025/05/18/i-help-americans-move-abroad-most-welcoming-countries-in-europe.html\">welcomed with open arms</a>.</p></div><h2><a></a>3. 'You'll be lonely'</h2><div><p>Of course you'll miss family and friends, but community abroad often forms faster than you'd expect.</p><p>Other Americans and English-speaking foreigners are eager to connect. Between meetups, language exchanges, and expat events, you'll have no shortage of opportunities to meet people.</p><p>That said, deep friendships take time. I'm an extrovert, and it still took me around 2.5 years to feel like I had a strong community in Madrid. Many of <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2025/04/10/these-things-are-crucial-to-happy-friendships-says-connection-expert.html\">my closest friendships</a> came from hosting my own meetups.</p><p>For deeper integration, friendships with locals are key, though those are definitely harder to form. Many locals already have tight circles, and breaking in takes patience and persistence. Learning the language is essential, and it takes time. Most people are still beginners after a year.</p></div><h2><a></a>4. 'Life abroad is perfect'</h2><div><p>Living abroad can absolutely improve your quality of life — whether it's a slower pace, a relatively lower cost of living, or easier travel, there's a lot to love. But it's not a fairy tale.</p><p>You'll still deal with bureaucracy, taxes, and logistics like finding an apartment, setting up bank accounts, and making appointments with doctors. And sometimes the grocery store will just be closed on a Sunday when you need it most.</p><p>The hardest challenges are often personal. I'll never forget when I got the call that my father had passed away. It was in 2009, during one of my earlier stints in Spain, getting my master's degree. I learned then that the highs and lows of life still happen abroad, and the lows are tougher when you're far from home.</p></div><h2><a></a>5. 'Where you start is where you have to stay'</h2><div><p>Your first move abroad doesn't have to be your forever home. Think of it as a starting point, not a lifelong commitment. As someone once told me: It's a move, not a marriage. </p><p>When I moved to Madrid in 2015, I thought I'd never leave. But in 2020, I moved to Málaga, and now I'm considering heading back to Madrid again.</p><p>I've seen this with others, too. <a href=\"https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/still-saying-yes-how-cindy-built-a-life-abroad-in-her-60s-ep-56/id1449428314?i=1000694368757\" target=\"_blank\">Cindy Sheahan</a>, for example, moved to Porto, Portugal, but then decided Italy was a better fit and relocated there a year later.</p><p>Giving yourself permission to pivot can help you <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2025/06/02/avoid-this-common-trap-that-makes-decisions-harder-and-your-life-worse-take-simple-steps-instead.html\">avoid getting stuck in research paralysis</a>, trying to make the \"perfect\" choice before you even start. There are plenty of things you just won't know until you've actually moved.</p></div><h2><a></a>6. 'It's too late for me'</h2><div><p>I was 35 when I moved and thought I was already too old. At the time, I only knew of students and <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2025/06/03/55-year-old-american-who-retired-in-portugal-shares-myths-about-living-abroad-as-an-expat.html\">retirees moving abroad</a>, not people in the middle of their careers. But at 45, I can say without hesitation that it was the best decision I've ever made.</p><p>And once I got here, I met so many people my age and older who had done the same. People make the leap at every age — 30s, 40s, 50s, even 70s.</p><p>In fact, moving in your 30s or later has advantages, since people tend to arrive with more financial stability, better <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2024/08/01/wharton-psychologist-adam-grant-to-know-yourself-better-try-this.html\">self-awareness</a>, and the wisdom to navigate challenges with perspective.</p><p><em><strong>Cepee Tabibian</strong> is the founder of </em><a href=\"https://shehitrefresh.com/\" target=\"_blank\"><em>She Hit Refresh</em></a><em>, a community and resource platform that helps women aged 30+ move abroad.

    "body": "<div><div><p>Struggling to stay on top of your money is not a unique problem.</p><p>But neurodivergent people — such as those with <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2023/07/31/ellie-middleton-learned-she-has-adhd-autism-in-her-20s-now-she-shares-her-experiences.html\">autism or ADHD</a> — can face a unique set of challenges when managing their finances, says Andrea Ewalefo, founder of <a href=\"https://www.modernladyvibes.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Modern Lady Vibes</a>, a financial coaching business specializing in neurodivergent women of color.</p><p>One of these challenges is something called <a href=\"https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/symptoms/23224-executive-dysfunction\" target=\"_blank\">executive dysfunction</a>. It can crop up in variety of areas — \"anything from your impulsivity, to your ability to make decisions, to your to your ability to be consistent,\" Ewalefo says. \"Time blindness is another one, you get caught up in certain experiences. Or you don't have enough dopamine to keep you focused for a long period of time.\"</p><p>If any of this sounds like you, the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2023/05/23/why-the-50-30-20-budgeting-rule-is-out-of-reach-for-most-americans.html\">traditional approach to managing money</a> you've been taught may not work for you, says Ewalefo, herself a member of the neurodivergent community.</p><p>\"A lot of the things people in the financial education space get caught up in is throwing systems in people's faces,\" she says. For neurodivergent folks, \"we struggle with not only getting the systems set up, but sticking to them, or getting emotionally invested in them.\"</p><p>Ewalefo knows that no two people have the exact same concerns when it comes to money, and tries to meet clients where they are. Her advice for nearly all of them: \"Don't beat yourself up.\" And whenever possible, try to automate and delegate the financial tasks that drain you the most, so you can focus more on achieving your money goals.</p></div><h2><a></a>Removing decision fatigue can make it easier to manage your money</h2><div><p>For some neurodivergent people, the \"<a href=\"https://health.clevelandclinic.org/spoon-theory-chronic-illness\" target=\"_blank\">spoon theory</a>,\" can serve as a useful metaphor for a daily store of energy that's depleted by doing tasks.</p><p>\"Brushing your teeth — things that neurotypical people just wake up and do — we have to consciously think about, and it uses our energy, our spoons,\" Ewalefo says. \"This morning brushing my teeth might take ten spoons. Yesterday it took two.\"</p><p>The idea is that you have a set amount of spoons for the day, and once they're gone, you're completely mentally spent, \"a log on the floor,\" Ewalefo says.</p><p>For many of Ewalefo's clients, the first step to getting on track financially is about taking money-related spoons off the table.</p><p>\"If we can remove as much decision fatigue as possible, particularly within our financial planning, then that can help preserve our energy to do other things,\" she says. \"What that might look like is automating as much as possible.\"</p><p>Ewalefo recommends setting your bill due dates to align with the days you get paid. If you're paid once a month, for instance, set up autopay for all your bills on payday.</p><p>\"Since it's happening right when you get that paycheck, once your bills are paid, everything left is just free spending money,\" she says. \"Now have the freedom to enjoy your impulse buying without worrying about the fact that, oh no, I just spent my car payment.\"</p><p>What's more, setting rote financial tasks on autopilot can allow you to dedicate more of your mental energy to the money goals you really care about. To make progress on those, she says, you'll also have to pay yourself from each check — and that can be put on autopilot, too.</p><p>\"It's not just the bills or the debt, it's also auto-drafting your savings and investing needs so that those are prioritized just as much as your rent, just as much as your water bill,\" Ewalefo says. \"And all of that money has been set aside and put where it needs to go, so whatever is left in your account can literally just be spent on whatever you want.\"</p><p><em><strong>Last chance to save: Want to be your own boss?</strong> Final days to get 30% off Smarter by CNBC Make It's new online course, </em><a href=\"https://smarter.cnbcmakeit.com/p/how-to-start-a-business-for-first-time-founders?utm_source=cnbc&utm_medium=makeitarticle&utm_campaign=bottom\" target=\"_blank\"><em>How To Start A Business: For First-Time Founders</em></a><em>.

Maybe they come from a family of business owners, or never really felt fulfilled working a standard 9-to-5 job.</p><p>For others, the signs may not be so evident, leaving them to wonder, \"Am I ready to take the leap? Am I even supposed to be my own boss?\" According to Olipop co-founder and CEO Ben Goodwin, there's a tell-tale sign to watch out for. </p><p>\"If the excitement and fulfillment of the vision for what you want to do is more powerful than the fear and the excuses,\" then you should act on it, says Goodwin, 40. He adds that you have to have \"a lot of passion\" because when things inevitably get tough, that drive will keep you focused on your mission.</p><p><em><strong>DON'T MISS</strong></em><a href=\"https://smarter.cnbcmakeit.com/p/how-to-start-a-business-for-first-time-founders?utm_source=cnbc&utm_medium=makeitarticle&utm_campaign=body\" target=\"_blank\"><em><strong>:</strong> <strong>The ultimate guide to starting a business—everything you need to know to be your own boss</strong></em></a></p><p>Goodwin struggled with his physical and mental health as a teen who was regularly consuming unhealthy foods and beverages. Changing to a healthier diet and lifestyle made him feel much more fulfilled, he told <a href=\"https://fortune.com/well/article/olipop-cofounder-daily-habits-wellness-routine-ben-goodwin/\" target=\"_blank\">Fortune</a> in December 2023. So much so that he dropped out of college to pursue healthy drink alternatives to sodas and sugary juices. Goodwin left the University of California Santa Cruz in 2005, and 20 years later, he's still dedicated to his mission to help people lead healthier lives, he tells CNBC Make It.  </p><p>The journey wasn't linear. Goodwin's first venture, a water kefir beverage called Obi Probiotic Soda that launched in 2008, didn't gain the traction he'd hoped despite being in business for eight years. He and his business partner, David Lester, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2023/09/16/how-olipops-founders-turned-100k-investment-into-healthier-soda-brand.html\">sold the company</a> for an undisclosed amount in 2016, and used the money to get Olipop off the ground. The company made $852,000 in gross revenue in its first year of business, and was valued at <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2025/02/12/olipop-prebiotic-soda-valued-at-1point85-billion-in-funding-round.html\">$1.85 billion</a> in February.</p><p>Goodwin says that if you're able to bounce back from hardships and enjoy facing challenges head on, you're probably ready to be your own boss. </p><p>\"One of the things I really enjoy about entrepreneurialism is that it keeps challenging you,\" he says. \"You've got to make complex ethical decisions. You've got to make complex procedure decisions. You've got to operate under extreme pressure. And a lot of people want to avoid those things, logically, because they tend to make life a lot more complicated.\" </p><p>But if you're the kind of person that \"feels more alive when they're getting deeply or dynamically challenged, and recognize the value that that can provide to your interpersonal development,\" you should try your hand at entrepreneurship, says Goodwin. </p><p>Of course, everyone isn't innately open to failing or recovering from setbacks. But resilience is a skill that can be built and nurtured over time, according to author and mental performance coach Steve Magness. He recommends that people make a <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2022/07/01/how-changing-one-word-in-your-thoughts-can-boost-your-mental-toughness-and-resilience.html\">simple mindset shift</a> to start: \"Switch 'I' to 'you,\" he wrote for CNBC Make It in July 2022. </p><p>\"Using second- or third-person language in your self-talk creates distance between an experience and our emotional response,\" said Magness. \"This linguistic trick allows us to zoom out.\"</p><p>Next time you're facing a stressful challenge, tell yourself, \"You can do this,\" or, \"[Your name] can get through this,\" instead of, \"I've done this before,\"<strong> </strong>speaking to yourself like a friend or family member giving you a push.</p><p>\"When we broaden our worldview beyond a self-immersed world, we move from emotional reaction to action,\" Magness said.</p><p><em><strong>Want to be your own boss?</strong> Sign up for Smarter by CNBC Make It's new online course, </em><a href=\"https://smarter.cnbcmakeit.com/p/how-to-start-a-business-for-first-time-founders?utm_source=cnbc&utm_medium=makeitarticle&utm_campaign=bottom\" target=\"_blank\"><em>How To Start A Business: For First-Time Founders</em></a><em>.

    "body": "<div><div><p>Markeiz Ryan, 36, had a pretty good childhood growing up in Maryland, but the 2008 financial crisis changed things.</p><p>\"It wiped my mother's job away and it really made things tough for us around the time I graduated high school,\" Ryan tells CNBC Make It. \"I didn't have much of a financial security blanket to fall under. The best thing for me was to join the military so I wouldn't have to put my family into any more debt and I think that was the right decision.\"</p><p>Ryan joined the U.S. Air Force in 2010 and was stationed in various countries around the world, including Korea, Germany, and throughout Africa. In 2016, while living in Korea, Ryan got in trouble for breaking his curfew. He lost out on several months of pay, was restricted to his military base and demoted from staff sergeant to senior airman.</p><p>\"After this, I was very depressed and very sad,\" Ryan said. \"But that depression and sadness make you think about where your life is going and it makes you redirect your life into the right direction.\"</p></div><div><p>In Vietnam, Ryan lives off of roughly $4,000 a month.</p><p>Louis Corallo for CNBC Make It</p></div><div><p>In that period of time that Ryan was restricted to his military base, he planned a trip to visit a friend in Vietnam.</p><p>\"It just looked like so much fun and it really lived up to all the hype,\" he said. \"I ended up having the best time of my life, and that depression was [just] gone.\"</p><p>Ryan says that after that first trip to Vietnam and seeing how happy he was, he didn't want to let go of that feeling. He started planning his return to the country.</p><p>The veteran returned to his life in the Air Force and completed his service on a military base in Wyoming before being honorably discharged in 2019.</p></div><div><p>Ryan lives in a two-bedroom apartment in Ho Chi Minh City.</p><p>Louis Corallo for CNBC Make It</p></div><div><p>Soon after, Ryan relocated to Vietnam, where he lives off roughly $4,000 a month, according to documents reviewed by CNBC Make It.</p><p>Ryan suffers from spine arthritis, respiratory issues, auditory pain, and mental health challenges from his time in the military. He receives disability from Veterans Affairs.</p><p>His monthly income stems from several sources, including approximately $1,500 from VA disability, $1,000 from the GI Bill while he's pursuing a master's degree, and $900 to $1,300 from teaching English. Ryan also does occasional odd jobs like voiceover work, where his pay can range from $200 to $600 a month, and is an avid fan of day trading, where he averages about $300 a month.</p><p>\"This might not sound like a lot in America but trust me, this is more than enough to be middle or even above middle class in Vietnam,\" he says.</p></div><div><p>When Ryan moved to Vietnam, he bought a motorcycle to get around</p><p>Louis Corallo for CNBC Make It</p></div><div><p>Ryan lives in Ho Chi Minh City and has a two-bedroom, one-bathroom apartment in one of the country's tallest residential towers. He pays $850 a month in rent and his utilities round up to about $130, which includes electricity, water and housekeeping.</p><p>In addition to those expenses, Ryan also pays $1,000 a year for health insurance and $3 a week on gas for his motorcycle. What he spends on groceries varies from $100 to $400 a month, as he often alternates between cooking his own food or dining out frequently.</p><p>\"Vietnam is the number one safest place I've ever lived. I never have to look over my shoulder here. I noticed that there's this great level of calm,\" Ryan says. \"People are more focused on their day-to-day life and they're less focused on what's going on politically. It's a much more calm feeling.\"</p><p>Although Ryan loves living in Vietnam, one thing that irks him is the noise pollution.</p><p>\"There's a lot of honking, street sellers and sometimes karaoke really loudly, so if you are very intolerant to noise, this might not be the place for you,\" he says.</p></div><div><p>Ryan says Vietnam is now home and he has no plans of leaving.</p><p>Louis Corallo for CNBC Make It</p></div><div><p>Since moving to Vietnam, Ryan has made an effort to learn the language, but he admits he's still not the best at it.</p><p>\"I can never claim that I'm fluent in Vietnamese, but I do a lot better than most of my peers here,\" he says.</p><p>Ryan has been living in Vietnam for six years now, and says he has no plans of leaving.</p><p>\"If I leave, it's because Vietnam told me to leave. In America, I felt very unmotivated. I felt like no matter how hard you work, you're still in poverty. You're constantly chasing a standard that you can't really achieve,\" he says. \"Here in Vietnam, it takes a lot of the monetary pressure out of your day-to-day. You focus on what makes you happy, who you want to become and how you're going to get there.\"</p><p>This experience, he says, is the complete opposite of what his life was like back in the U.S.</p><p>\"Every day I wake up with a long to-do list of things I want to do, not the things that I need to do, and it's a completely different way of living. Even if you need to work 40 hours a week here, you're doing it as an investment in your future.

    "body": "<div><p>As a former world champion debater, Kate Mason, PhD, knows that the way you communicate can matter just as much as your message.</p><p>Mason, who lives in Sydney, Australia, spent a decade working in communications at companies like Google and YouTube before becoming an executive coach and founding her own strategic communications firm, <a href=\"https://www.wearehedgehogandfox.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Hedgehog + Fox</a>, in 2017.</p><p>Through her work as a <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2025/09/15/dont-ask-how-are-you-how-successful-people-get-others-to-like-and-trust-them-psychology-expert.html\">communications coach</a>, Mason noticed a pattern she calls \"imposing syndrome\": many professionals, particularly women, are overly self-conscious about ruffling feathers or \"being a bother\" at work, she says, which often causes them to stay quiet and minimize their accomplishments.</p><p>These self-deprecating habits have \"an insidious effect on their work and their standing,\" she says.</p><p>\"It leads to <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2025/08/04/people-wont-take-you-seriously-if-you-use-these-phrases-make-these-powerful-swaps-says-communication-expert.html\">underestimating themselves</a> and their work by extension,\" she continues.</p><p>Mason's goal in highlighting these communication patterns isn't to point out \"all the ways we're doing it wrong,\" she says. Instead, she hopes to provide resources for leaders, especially women, who are interested in changing their communication patterns.</p><p>\"It's more like a kind acknowledgment: this is a thing, and if that's not serving you, maybe you want to experiment a little bit,\" Mason says.</p><p>She shares her top insights in her first book, <a href=\"https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/745694/powerfully-likeable-by-kate-mason-phd/\" target=\"_blank\">\"Powerfully Likeable: A Woman's Guide to Effective Communication,\"</a> which debuted earlier this month.</p><p>Here are three phrases Mason recommends all professionals avoid in the workplace, along with stronger alternatives.</p><h3><strong>'It'll just take a second'</strong></h3><p>People who use this phrase are often acting on a \"very kind, emotionally aware impulse\" to demonstrate respect for others' time, Mason says.</p><p>In reality, prefacing your conversation with \"It'll just take a second\" can have the opposite effect, according to Mason.</p><p>Firstly, \"you've set an expectation to the other person that this will be very quick,\" she says, but \"literally nothing takes one second.\"</p><p>Providing an unrealistic time estimate can annoy or disappoint the person you're speaking to, Mason says.</p><p>\"That person, a couple minutes in, is already a bit irritated because they're like, 'Wait, this was only going to be a second.'\"</p><p>Moreover, the phrase also sets the expectation that whatever you have to say is minor or unimportant, Mason says, which can undercut your actual message.</p><p>A better way to articulate your request is, \"I'm going to put in an hour for us next week. I really want to talk through A, B and C. Let me know if that time works for you,\" Mason says.</p><p>With that rephrase, \"suddenly, I look like I'm coming to you with something substantive and meaty and worthy of us spending that time together,\" she says.</p><p>\"It just does the idea — and yourself — a lot more justice to reframe it that way,\" she continues.</p><h3><strong>'No worries if not'</strong></h3><p>This phrase is commonly used to 'soften' a direct request, Mason says, but it's usually not factually true.</p><p>\"There often <em>is </em>a pressing concern,\" she says. \"It's very rare that we make an ask and genuinely think, 'Oh well, if they get back to me, we'll see.'\"</p><p>Saying \"No worries if not\" communicates that your request is a low priority, Mason says: \"It does a bit of a disservice to the ask.\"</p><p>For her part, when Mason hears this phrase, she mentally places that task lower on her to-do list, she says.</p><p>\"If you're communicating with an exec or someone who's busy and you're telling them 'no worries if not,' and there is a worry, then we can get ourselves into a bit of an unnecessarily sticky situation,\" she says.</p><p>Instead, Mason suggests specifying the purpose and time frame of your request. For example, \"I would appreciate if you could send me your edits by this afternoon, because the final draft is due tomorrow.\"</p><p>As Mason cites in her book, a <a href=\"https://psycnet.apa.org/doi/10.1037/0022-3514.36.6.635\" target=\"_blank\">psychological study</a> from the 1970s<strong> </strong>found that people were more likely to comply with a request if they were given a reason behind it.</p><p>With that context, people are \"usually happy to help,\" she says.</p><h3><strong>'I'm not an expert, but…'</strong></h3><p>This phrase will instantly make you seem less credible, Mason says.</p><p>According to Mason, prefacing your point with \"I'm not an expert\" <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2025/08/14/ive-coached-leaders-at-google-and-amazon-highly-successful-people-use-these-phrases-to-command-attention.html\">reduces your authority</a> and telegraphs uncertainty: \"It immediately deescalates your status.\"</p><p>People often minimize their accomplishments when they're feeling self-conscious, Mason says, especially if they view themselves as the 'odd one out' in a group.</p><p>Whether you're the youngest in the room, or the newest to the company, \"whatever that imbalance may be, we're hyper-aware of it,\" she says.</p><p>Being conscious of your place in the professional hierarchy isn't necessarily a bad thing, Mason says, but instead of downplaying your value, she recommends embracing the unique qualities you bring to the table.</p><p>\"You weren't hired because you have the same expertise as that vice president or C-level exec,\" she says. \"You were hired because you have <em>your</em> expertise.\"</p><p>Leaning into your strengths can be \"really empowering,\" Mason says.</p><p>\"Once you start realizing like, this is the thing I was hired for, and that is the value I can bring, and that's what they want from me, it just lets you put down a lot of that hierarchical, status-oriented anxiety.\"</p><p><em><strong>Want to be your own boss?</strong> Sign up for Smarter by CNBC Make It's new online course, </em><a href=\"https://smarter.cnbcmakeit.com/p/how-to-start-a-business-for-first-time-founders?utm_source=cnbc&utm_medium=makeitarticle&utm_campaign=bottom\" target=\"_blank\"><em>How To Start A Business: For First-Time Founders</em></a><em>.

Cook's attorneys argued in a prior filing to the high court that her removal could ruin Fed independence.</p><p>So far, the financial markets have shown little reaction to Trump's Powell threats or Cook's attempted firing. Though many economists and investors believe firing Powell before his term ends could cause longer-term interest rates to rise on the notion the Fed would start to act in Trump's interests and not according to its dual mandate from Congress of stable inflation and low unemployment.</p></div></div>"

TipRanks' AI Analyst has an \"outperform\" rating on Nvidia stock with a price target of $204.</p><p>Highlighting the key takeaways from his conversation with the company's CFO, Lipacis said that Nvidia will be the preferred supplier to OpenAI, adding that the ChatGPT platform has underestimated demand for its solution and wants to get ahead of future demand. Nvidia is well-positioned to help OpenAI with this infrastructure buildout.</p><p>Lipacis noted that the deal specifies at least 10 GW (gigawatts) of AI infrastructure, and Nvidia management confirmed that, historically, the company's total addressable market (TAM) was $30 billion to $40 billion per GW, although it could increase in the future. The analyst increased his 2026 revenue and earnings per share (EPS) estimates by 2% for Nvidia, but thinks that his forecast may be conservative.</p><p>Lipacis ranks No. 53 among more than 10,000 analysts tracked by TipRanks. His ratings have been successful 66% of the time, delivering an average return of 26.5%. See Nvidia ETF Exposure on TipRanks.</p><h3>MongoDB</h3><p>Next is database management software company <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/\">MongoDB</a> (<a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/mdb\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>MDB</strong></a>). The company recently held a MongoDB.local event in New York City, hosting an Investor Session focused on profitable growth and providing a 3- to 5-year financial framework.</p><p>Following the event, Needham analyst Mike Cikos reiterated a buy rating on MongoDB and increased his <a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/mdb/forecast\" target=\"_blank\">price target to $365</a> from $325. TipRanks' AI Analyst is also bullish on MDB stock, giving it an \"outperform\" rating and a price target of $355.</p><p>Cikos said that while investors' initial reaction to the high-teens revenue growth forecast was underwhelming, he expects both AI and competitive migrations to drive incremental growth for MongoDB.</p><p>The 5-star analyst noted that management plans to continue investing in the business, though at a slower rate than revenue and gross profit growth. MongoDB's investments will mainly focus on developer awareness, research & development and its sales force.The company has also identified areas for optimization and expects its scale to drive profitable growth through efficiencies.</p><p>Cikos said that following the MongoDB.local event he is \"incrementally more positive on MongoDB's AI positioning,\" driven by embeddings, which bridge data and Large Language Models (LLMs), and the continued integration of Voyage's best-in-class models.</p><p>Cikos ranks No. 581 among more than 10,000 analysts tracked by TipRanks. His ratings have been profitable 59% of the time, delivering an average return of 14.1%.

The cloud-native platform offers security solutions for critical areas of enterprise risk — endpoints and cloud workloads, identity, and data.</p><p>Following CrowdStrike's recently held<strong> </strong>Fal.Con 2025 event, RBC Capital analyst Matthew Hedberg reiterated a buy rating on CrowdStrike with a <a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/crwd/forecast\" target=\"_blank\">12-month price target of $510</a>, saying the commentary from management, partners and customers reinforced his bullish long-term thesis. CrowdStrike remains one of RBC's top cybersecurity ideas, he added. TipRanks' AI Analyst has a \"neutral\" rating on CrowdStrike stock with a target price of $543.</p><p>\"Overall, we thought the event made a compelling case for the company's positioning as we enter the agentic era,\" said Hedberg.</p><p>The 5-star analyst mainly noted lucrative prospects in agentic security for CrowdStrike and the evolution of its agentic security operations center (SOC). He added that management views the agentic revolution as a huge opportunity (potentially over a 100x), with the rise of more identities and complexity creating new security needs.</p><p>Management sees a total addressable market (TAM) of $300 billion in 2030, up from $140 billion in 2026, with key tailwinds resulting from market consolidation, the evolving threat landscape and technological advancements. Helped by these tailwinds, Hedberg believes CrowdStrike is well-positioned for continued market consolidation as it secures an AI-led transformation.  </p><p>Hedberg noted that CrowdStrike is about halfway through its $10 billion annual recurring revenue (ARR) goal for fiscal 2031. While cloud, the Next-Gen Identity Security offering and the Next-Gen SIEM platform are the key drivers for the current ARR of $4.7 billion, management expects agentic SOC to be the main catalyst for achieving the $10 billion ARR target for fiscal 2031. CrowdStrike expects Agentic Everywhere to be the key driver for the newly introduced $20 billion ARR target for fiscal 2036.</p><p>Hedberg ranks No. 37 among more than 10,000 analysts tracked by TipRanks. His ratings have been successful 70% of the time, delivering an average return of 21.6%. See CrowdStrike Insider Trading Activity on TipRanks.</p></div></div>"

    "body": "<div><div><p>Utah-based drink chain Swig coined \"dirty soda\" back in 2010. Fifteen years later, the trend is fueling innovation everywhere from <span><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/PEP/\">PepsiCo</a><span><span></span></span></span> to <span><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/MCD/\">McDonald's</a><span><span></span></span></span>, infusing the sluggish beverage category with new life.</p><p>\"Dirty soda\" drinks use pop as a base, followed by flavored syrups, cream or other ingredients. While Swig claims credit — and the trademark — for dirty soda, TikTok videos and the reality TV show \"The Secret Lives of Mormon Wives\" have helped the trend spread far and wide, outpacing even the soda chain's speedy expansion.</p><p>Now, consumers can find it nearly everywhere, from grocery store aisles to fast-food chains.</p><p>In a few weeks, Pepsi plans to unveil two ready-to-drink dirty soda-inspired beverages at the National Association of Convenience Stores trade show in Chicago. The new drinks, the Dirty Dew and the Mug Floats Vanilla Howler, follow on the heels of the Pepsi Wild Cherry & Cream flavor, which hit shelves earlier this year.</p><p>\"I think it's a great opportunity for people like us, like PepsiCo, and for consumers to experience soda in a new way — and in some ways, an old way,\" Pepsi Beverages North America Chief Marketing Officer Mark Kirkham told CNBC, comparing the rise of dirty soda to root beer floats and the soda shops of yore.</p></div><div><p>PepsiCo's lineup of dirty soda-inspired drinks includes Pepsi Wild Cherry & Cream, Dirty Mountain Dew and Mug Floats Vanilla Howler.</p><p>Source: PepsiCo</p></div><div><p>Dirty soda has also drawn new interest beyond beverage players. According to Datassential, 2.7% of U.S. eateries offer a carbonated soft drink that includes cream or milk, up from 1.5% a decade ago.</p><p>Newcomers to the trend include TGI Fridays, which launched dirty soda as a limited-time menu item this summer that could be spiked with alcohol. McDonald's is <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2025/07/24/mcdonalds-tests-cosmcs-drinks.html\">testing flavored sodas</a>, like a \"Sprite Lunar Splash,\" at more than 500 locations after winding down its drinks-focused spinoff CosMc's in June. <span><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/YUM/\">Yum Brands'</a><span><span></span></span></span> Taco Bell has also been offering limited-time menu items, like a dirty Mountain Dew Baja Blast.</p></div><h2><a></a>Swig sets a trend</h2><div><p>These days, Swig has grown to more than 140 locations across 16 states. So far this year, its same-store sales have risen 8.2%, according to the privately held company. The Larry H. Miller Company, an investment firm founded by the former Utah Jazz owner, bought a majority stake in Swig in 2022 for an undisclosed sum.</p><p>\"I think we're doing for soda what Starbucks did for coffee,\" Swig CEO Alex Dunn said.</p><p>As Swig has grown, so have the number of chains looking to emulate its success. Rival soda shops like Sodalicious, Fiiz and Cool Sips are also benefiting from the trend. Coffee shops, like <span><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/BROS/\">Dutch Bros.</a><span><span></span></span></span>, have also added it to their menus. And now fast-food chains are hopping on the bandwagon.</p><p>\"It validates that this is a category, and McDonald's and Taco Bell wouldn't be getting into it if it wasn't something that had broad appeal that they could sell everywhere, in thousands of locations,\" Dunn said. \"It's kind of flattering that we created a category that now everybody is copying.\"</p><p>For restaurants, adding dirty soda to the menu is easier than it might sound.</p><p>\"It's a custom drink offering that, one, allows the brands to leverage something that they already have right there: their soda machine,\" said Erica Holland-Toll, culinary director at The Culinary Edge, which advises restaurants on food and beverage innovation. \"Two, it incorporates either a one-touch ingredient, or if they're already open for breakfast, it's quite likely that they've got a creamer in house.\"</p><p>On the other hand, offering customizable coffee drinks is usually much more difficult — which has contributed to the struggles at Starbucks.</p><p>\"The espresso world — that's so much more complicated,\" Holland-Toll said.</p><p>Dirty soda also has wide appeal. With less caffeine than coffee, consumers can drink it all day long. Plus, it's \"much more accessible\" than some coffee house trends, like an espresso tonic, according to Holland-Toll. The bright colors of many dirty sodas also make them more attractive to consumers, who were likely introduced to the trend via a TikTok video.</p><p>But perhaps above all, dirty soda can help restaurants draw in customers who are otherwise feeling thrifty.</p><p>\"It's an affordable fun treat. You're not going out and spending $30 or $50, right?\" said Sally Lyons Watt, chief advisor of consumer goods and foodservice insights for Circana. \"It's something that people can walk away saying, 'Wow, that was yummy' or 'I feel better because I just had that.'\"</p></div><h2><a></a>A pop for beverage companies</h2><div><p>Swig drinks.</p><p>Courtesy: Swig</p></div><div><p>A \"fun treat\" for consumers is adding up for beverage companies, helping reverse the decades-long trend of declining soda consumption in the U.S.</p><p>As health concerns mount and the array of beverage options expands, Americans have been drinking less soda for roughly two decades. In 2004, soda consumption peaked at 15.3 billion gallons, according to Beverage Marketing; by 2024, that figure had slid to 11.87 billion gallons. But consumption of carbonated soft drinks has been ticking up in the last two years, with 2025 estimated to reach 11.88 billion gallons. The rise of dirty soda, plus the growing popularity of prebiotic sodas, has likely helped the segment halt its downward trajectory.</p></div><div><p>Over the years, iced coffee has been stealing what the beverage industry calls \"share of throat\" from soda. With dirty soda, consumers can marry their love of customizing a cold drink with the lower caffeine content and taste of soda.</p><p>\"The carbonation makes it feel lighter in your mouth than coffee, for example,\" Holland-Toll said.</p><p>Dirty soda has also been attracting younger consumers who previously didn't drink much Pepsi or Dr Pepper. Swig's core customer base is young women between the ages of 18 and 35, according to Dunn.</p><p>That's true for Holly Galvin, a 31-year-old human resources professional based in Davenport, Iowa. She told CNBC that she rarely drank soda — until she saw dirty soda take the spotlight in the \"The Secret Lives of Mormon Wives\" last year. Now she makes her own dirty soda once or twice a week at home. With the onset of autumn, her go-to recipe these days uses Diet Dr Pepper as a base, with pumpkin spice creamer and a sprinkle of pumpkin pie spice on top.</p><p>Broadly, younger consumers are more inclined to seek out new drinks compared with older cohorts. Nearly three-quarters of Generation Z try a new beverage every month on average, according to Keurig Dr Pepper's 2025 trend report.</p><p>Beverage companies say that they are seeing a broader halo effect for soda as a result of the trend.</p><p>\"For us, it serves as a recruitment tool, bringing new users into the trademark,\" said Katie Webb, vice president of innovation and transformation for <span><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/KDP/\">Keurig Dr Pepper</a><span><span></span></span></span>. \"It really draws them all the way back to the base brand, which ends up being extremely impact for us long after.\"</p><p>And just as craft cocktail culture led to the rise of canned cocktails, the popularity of dirty soda is leading beverage giants to cash in with ready-to-drink versions that capitalize on the trend. Dr Pepper Creamy Coconut was the company's most successful limited-time carbonated soft drink to date, based on retail dollar sales, according to Webb. And Kirkham said Pepsi Wild Cherry & Cream has been one of the fastest-growing flavor segments for the company.</p><p>\"Some trends start retail and move over to foodservice,\" Circana's Lyons Wyatt said. \"This one was a foodservice trend moving into retail.\"</p><p>With Pepsi Wild Cherry & Cream and next year's launch of Dirty Dew and the Mug Floats Vanilla Howler, Kirkham expects that consumers will become even more creative with their concoctions.</p><p>\"I think it's actually giving [consumers] the chance to experiment even more and customize more,\" he said. \"Now you have a brand new base.\"</p></div></div>"

The U.S. is almost entirely dependent on China, which supplied 70% of rare earth imports in 2023, according to the <a href=\"https://pubs.usgs.gov/periodicals/mcs2025/mcs2025-rare-earths.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">U.S. Geological Survey</a>. </p><p>China has manipulated the market by suppressing prices to drive Western competition from the market, said Ryan Castilloux, founder of Adamas Intelligence, a critical mineral market research firm. The MP deal demonstrated that the U.S. is willing to break with free market ideals and push back against China by mimicking its model of strategic capitalism when necessary, Castilloux said.</p><p>\"We've seen just how disadvantaged the free market view is versus a long term, industrial policy driven market — and something needed to give,\" Castilloux, an expert on critical minerals, told CNBC.</p><h3>Possible rare earth targets</h3><p>Energy Fuels' stock has surged nearly 200% since the MP deal on July 10, as investors speculate that it could be a deal target for the Trump administration. Critical mineral miner <span><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/NB-CA/\">NioCorp Developments</a><span><span></span></span></span> is also up almost 200%, <span><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/METC/\">Ramaco Resources</a><span><span></span></span></span> has gained 140%, and <span><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/undefined/\">USA Rare Earth</a><span><span></span></span></span> is up more than 70%.</p><p>MP Materials will likely need more heavy rare earths as it develops a second facility to make magnets under the Defense Department deal, Castilloux said. Heavy rare earths are needed to produce magnets that can withstand high temperatures in EV motors and defense industry applications, he said.</p></div><div><p><img src=\"https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/108177847-1753717588660-250701-cn-28-tech-rare-earths-YT00_08_42_03Still003.jpg?v=1753717778&w=750&h=422&vtcrop=y\" alt=\"Can the U.S. break China’s rare earth dominance?\" /><span></span><span><div><p><span>watch now</span><span></span></p></div></span></p></div><div><p>Headquartered in Denver, Energy Fuels is the largest uranium miner in the U.S. and is forming a rare earth operation through mines it has acquired around the world. Its operation will produce heavy rare earths, Chalmers said.</p><p>Energy Fuels is focused on \"providing a product that is attractive to the U.S government\" and complements the strengths of MP Materials, the CEO said.</p><p>\"The government cannot bet on one horse — it just doesn't make sense,\" Chalmers said. \"We spend a lot of time in D.C. making sure they understand the merits of our strategy,\" he said.</p><h3>Trump eyes lithium</h3><p>Other critical minerals like lithium, cobalt and graphite are ripe for federal investment to smooth out volatile price fluctuations that undermine U.S. miners, said Rich Nolan, CEO of the National Mining Association. Those minerals are all used in batteries, among other applications.</p><p>The Trump administration has <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2025/09/24/lithium-americas-lac-equity-stake-trump-stock.html\">proposed an equity stake </a>in <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/\">Lithium Americas</a>, as the Canadian company renegotiates the terms of a $2.2 billion loan from the Department of Energy for its Thacker Pass mine in northern Nevada. The mine is expected to become one of the largest sources of lithium in North America, with the first phase of the project scheduled to start operations in late 2027.</p><p>Lithium Americas stock surged more than 90% this week on news of the potential government stake.</p><p><span><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/ALB/\">Albemarle</a><span><span></span></span></span> CEO Kent Masters told CNBC that something \"in the ballpark\" of the MP deal could apply to the lithium sector. Albemarle, headquartered in Charlotte, North Carolina, is one of the largest lithium producers in the world.</p><p>\"What you want to do is move the market such that private industry can invest behind it,\" Masters told CNBC in July, pointing to <span><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/AAPL/\">Apple</a><span><span></span></span></span>'s <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2025/07/15/apple-mp-materials-magnets-rare-earths.html\">offtake agreement</a> with MP just days after the Defense Department deal.</p></div><div><p><img src=\"https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/108204619-17589102751758910272-41828786297-1080pnbcnews.jpg?v=1758910274&w=750&h=422&vtcrop=y\" alt=\"MP Materials appears to be the U.S. rare earths champion, says Canaccord Genuity's George Gianarikas\" /><span></span><span><div><p><span>watch now</span><span></span></p></div></span></p></div><div><h3>Miners seek price floors</h3><p>While it might take a government equity stake to move the market in some cases, the price floor established by the Pentagon in the MP deal is the \"critical part\" that allows private industry to invest and build out the supply chain, Masters said.</p><p>Price support from the federal government \"sends a true market signal that these investments are long term, that they are here to stay,\" the National Mining Association's Nolan said.</p><p>Under the MP deal, the Pentagon set a price floor of $110 per kilogram for neodymium-praseodymium oxide, or<strong> </strong>NdPr, a key input in rare-earth magnets. The government pays MP the difference when the market price is below $110 but in turn takes 30% of the upside when the price is above $110.</p><p>The price of NdPr surged 40% in the wake of the MP deal, Castilloux said.</p><p>\"It serves as a blueprint for any market where suppressed pricing is slanting the competitive playing field against the U.S. and its allies,\" the analyst said of the price floor. The deal signals that \"there is a way to break free of China's artificially suppressed pricing,\" he said.</p></div></div>"

The CSI 300 Information Technology Index, which measures the performance of tech companies within the CSI 300, last week hit its highest level since 2015.</p><p>\"China's ongoing equity rally appears disconnected with the economic fundamentals,\" said Raymond Cheng, regional CIO for North Asia at Standard Chartered, adding that \"retail investors have played a key role as they have been shifting some of their bank deposits into equity markets.\"</p><p>Retail investors dominate China's onshore stock markets, accounting for around 90% of daily trading, according to HSBC data. That's a sharp contrast with major global exchanges, where institutions lead activity — on the New York Stock Exchange, for example, individual investors make up only <a href=\"https://www.nyse.com/data-insights/market-rules-are-making-more-liquidity-inaccessible-to-institutional-investors#fn2\" target=\"_blank\">20%–25% of trading volume</a>.</p><p>Total Chinese household savings currently stand <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2025/08/25/china-stock-market-boom-record-savings.html\">at more than 160 trillion yuan ($22 trillion)</a>, a record high, according to HSBC. However, <a href=\"https://www.globalxetfs.com.hk/research/how-much-can-the-rmb-150trn-household-deposits-be-reallocated-to-equity-market/\" target=\"_blank\">only 5%</a> is allocated to equities, which means there is room for retail participation to deepen, especially as deposit rates fall and property remains out of favor, analysts told CNBC.</p></div><h2><a></a>Fundamentals vs. momentum</h2><div><p>\"Fundamentals do not well support the momentum, but markets always lead fundamentals,\" said Hao Hong, managing partner and CIO at Lotus Asset Management. \"There are few signs of overheating in the overall market, but pockets of the market are a little too hot.\"</p><p>\"This is not yet a bubble, but it is going that way,\" said Hong. He pointed to contract research organizations — firms providing research and development services to pharma, biotech, medical device companies — and technology names as the riskiest segments, but stopped short of labeling them as bubbles.</p><p>More than $3 trillion in market capitalization has been added across Chinese and Hong Kong equities this year, according to Goldman Sachs. But China's economic data offers little confirmation that a genuine and sustainable rebound is underway, market watchers said.</p><p>Japanese financial holdings company Nomura last month warned of excessive leverage and potential \"bubbles\" as the stock market continues to surge even as China's economy shows signs of sputtering in the second half of the year. </p><p>China's economic slowdown worsened in August as a series of <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2025/09/15/china-retail-sales-industrial-output-slow-in-august-missing-estimates-as-real-estate-slump-worsens.html\">key indicators fell short of expectations</a>. Persistent weak domestic demand and Beijing's efforts to reduce industrial overcapacity weighed on production.</p></div><div><p><img src=\"https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/108192772-17567012191756701216-41440874087-1080pnbcnews.jpg?v=1756701218&w=750&h=422&vtcrop=y\" alt=\"China a 'buy-and-hold trade' as we expect more domestic policy support: Research head\" /><span></span><span><div><p><span>watch now</span><span></span></p></div></span></p></div><div><p>Industrial output rose 5.2% last month, easing from July's 5.7% growth and marking its weakest pace since August 2024. Retail sales grew 3.4% year on year, below analysts' forecast of 3.9% in a Reuters survey and slower than July's 3.7% growth.</p><p>\"So far, we have not seen signs of a turnaround in macro fundamentals, although the current momentum might be supported by expectations for structural improvements in the economy,\" said Chaoping Zhu, global market strategist at J.P. Morgan Asset Management.</p><p>Semi-annual reports suggest some stabilization in sectors such as AI, semiconductors and renewables, and Beijing's \"anti-involution\" push — aimed at reining in price wars — could improve corporate earnings capacity, Zhu said.</p><p>For example, Chinese chipmaker Cambricon reported record profits in the first half of the year, jumping more than 4,000% year on year to 2.88 billion yuan ($402.7 million) in the first six months, highlighting the growing momentum of domestic chip companies as Beijing pushes to strengthen its homegrown semiconductor sector.</p><p>Still, Zhu cautions that technology valuations may have \"priced in very optimistic expectations,\" leaving the market vulnerable to pulling back before earnings catch up.</p></div></div>"
