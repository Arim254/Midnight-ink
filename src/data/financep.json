    "body": "<div><div><p>Household incomes throughout the U.S. stayed fairly flat between 2023 and 2024, with the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2025/09/11/us-median-household-income-2024.html\">national median household income</a> rising just over 1%, according to Census Bureau estimates.</p><p>But in some cities, even a 1% increase would have seemed somewhat like a boon. The median household income declined in seven of the 50 largest U.S. cities between 2023 and 2024, a <a href=\"https://smartasset.com/data-studies/income-growth-2025\" target=\"_blank\">recent SmartAsset analysis</a> of Census Bureau data found.</p><p>Incomes in Minneapolis fell by the largest percentage at just over 4%, bringing the median household income there down to $77,732 from around $81,000 in 2023, SmartAsset found.</p></div><h2><a></a>Families (and their money) on the move</h2><div><p>Among households with children in Minneapolis, median incomes fell by over 19% between 2023 and 2024, per SmartAsset. That doesn't necessarily mean families aren't seeing the same wage gains <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2025/08/27/americans-less-confident-about-financial-futures.html\">other households</a> are, though, says Jaclyn DeJohn, director of economic analysis at SmartAsset.</p><p>\"While [the negative trend] may be indicative of families struggling to keep up with wage growth, it may also indicate other social or demographic trends,\" she says. </p><p>Families that experience a divorce that leads to separated households and split incomes could contribute to the overall income decline among family households, she says. Or one parent may leave the workforce to stay home with the children.</p></div><h2><a></a>Earning less than the previous year, but still more than the national median</h2><div><p>In four of the seven major cities where incomes fell between 2023 and 2024, incomes were higher than the national median household income of $82,690 in 2023. The relatively high-earning cities like Denver, Seattle and Austin, Texas, may have seen declines, but incomes there are still well above the national median.</p><p>Big cities can be more prone to \"volatility and potential for wage-growth events\" due to economic dynamics like new businesses moving in and changes to local demographics, DeJohn says.</p><p>And though incomes grew at a rate of just over 1% nationwide between 2023 and 2024, they rose even slower in five of the largest U.S. cities:</p><ul><li>Philadelphia (0.36%)</li><li>Indianapolis (0.41%)</li><li>Colorado Springs, Colorado (0.55%)</li><li>Omaha, Nebraska (0.56%)</li><li>Boston (0.89%)</li></ul><p><em><strong>Want to be your own boss?</strong> Sign up for Smarter by CNBC Make It's new online course, </em><a href=\"https://smarter.cnbcmakeit.com/p/how-to-start-a-business-for-first-time-founders?utm_source=cnbc&utm_medium=makeitarticle&utm_campaign=bottom\" target=\"_blank\"><em>How To Start A Business: For First-Time Founders</em></a><em>.

It will include around 40 new styles and pieces that can be worn in and outside of the gym. </p><p>Beyond the core apparel line, NikeSKIMS will also debut a handful of seasonal collections – including a vintage line and layering pieces that can be used to create an activewear look. </p><p>After the companies announced the partnership in February, they were set to launch an initial collection in the spring, with a global rollout planned for 2026. But they pushed it<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2025/06/18/nike-skims-kim-kardashian.html\"> back in early June</a> due to internal production delays that weren't related to a supplier or shipping issue. </p><p>NikeSKIMS is marketing the new line alongside a slew of top female athletes, including former tennis star Serena Williams, track and field Olympian Sha'Carri Richardson, gymnast Jordan Chiles and snowboarder Chloe Kim. </p><p>The launch will help Nike move toward a number of goals it set under new CEO Elliott Hill. The assortment's dual focus on performance and lifestyle will allow Nike to capture both female athletes and regular shoppers who are spending on activewear at competitors. The new styles include Nike's drying technology, making them suitable for intense exercise, but also knit pieces and layers that can be incorporated into everyday outfits.</p><p>Under Nike's former CEO John Donahoe, the company focused on its lifestyle side of the business – shoes and apparel that weren't just for exercising – which helped it grow its annual sales to north of $50 billion. However, that heavy focus on lifestyle led some of Nike's core athlete customers to shop elsewhere over criticisms it lost sight of innovation.</p><p>Hill, who <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2024/09/19/nike-ceo-john-donahoe-is-out-replaced-by-elliott-hill.html\">took over as Nike's top executive</a> in October, is working to bring <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2025/08/28/nike-to-lay-off-about-1percent-of-corporate-staff.html\">sports and athletes back</a> into the center of Nike's strategy. The partnership with Skims helps the company reach athletes but also has a lifestyle bent, which expands its total addressable market. </p><p>In turn, Skims, which was <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2022/01/27/kim-kardashians-skims-doubles-valuation-to-3point2-billion-after-latest-fundraise-.html\">last valued at $4 billion</a>, will get access to Nike's manufacturing and development capabilities and gains the opportunity for more growth. While buzzy and well known because of its connection to Kardashian, the brand is still relatively small compared to competitors. </p><p>\"NikeSKIMS is more than a collaboration — it's a new brand redefining activewear,\" Skims CEO Jens Grede said in a news release. \"With this launch, we are establishing a platform to grow NikeSKIMS, reach consumers worldwide, and set a new benchmark for how activewear is experienced across retail, digital, and cultural touch points.\"</p><p>Nike President Amy Montagne added the partnership is part of a \"broader commitment\" to women.</p></div></div>"

New Delhi's \"Semiconductor Mission\" aims to change that.</p><p>The ambition is bold. It wants to create a full supply chain — from design to fabrication, testing and packaging — on Indian soil.</p><p>As of this month, the country has approved 10 semiconductor projects with total investment of 1.6 trillion rupees ($18.2 billion). These include two semiconductor fabrication plants, and multiple testing and packing factories.</p><p>India also has a pool of engineering talent that is already employed by global chip design companies.</p><p>Yet progress so far has been uneven, and neither the investments nor talent pool is enough to make India's chip ambitions a reality, say experts.</p><p>\"India needs more than a few fabs or ATP facilities (i.e., more than a few \"shiny objects.\") It needs a dynamic and deep and long-term ecosystem,\" said Stephen Ezell, vice president for global innovation policy at the Information Technology and Innovation Foundation, a science and technology policy think tank.</p><p>Ezell says that leading semiconductor manufacturers consider \"as many as 500 discrete factors\" before they set up multi-billion-dollar fab investments. These include talent, tax, trade, technology policies, labor rates and laws and customs policies — all areas where India has work to do.</p></div><h2><a></a>New Delhi's policy push</h2><div><p>In May, the Indian government added a new element to its chip ambition: a scheme to support electronic component manufacturing, addressing a critical bottleneck.</p><p>Until now, chipmakers had no local demand for their product as there are hardly any electronic component manufacturing companies, such as phone camera companies, in India.</p></div><div><p>Researchers inside the semiconductor fabrication lab at the Centre for Nano Science and Engineering, at the Indian Institute of Science, in Bangalore.</p><p>Manjunath Kiran | Afp | Getty Images</p></div><div><p>But the new policy offers financial support to companies producing active and passive electronic components, creating a potential domestic buyer-supplier base that chip manufacturers can plug into.</p><p>In 2022, the country also pivoted from its strategy of providing superior incentives to fabrication units making chips of 28nm or less. When it comes to chips, the smaller the size, the higher the performance with improved energy efficiency. These chips can be used in new technologies like advanced AI and quantum computing by packing more transistors into the same space.</p><p>But this approach wasn't helping India develop its nascent semiconductor industry, so New Delhi now covers 50% of the project costs of all fabrication units, regardless of chip size, and of chip testing and packing units.</p><p>Fab companies from Taiwan and the U.K., and semiconductor packaging companies from the U.S. and South Korea have all shown interest in aiding India's semiconductor ambitions.</p><p>\"The Indian government has doled out generous incentives to attract semiconductor manufacturers to India,\" said Ezell, but he stressed that \"those sorts of investments aren't sustainable forever.\"</p></div><h2><a></a>The long road</h2><div><p>The biggest chip project in India currently is the 910-billion-rupee ($11 billion) semiconductor fabrication plant being built in Prime Minister Narendra Modi's home state of Gujarat by Tata Electronics, in partnership with Taiwan's Powerchip Semiconductor Manufacturing Corp.</p><p>The unit will make chips for power management integrated circuits, display drivers, microcontrollers and high-performance computing logic, <a href=\"https://www.tataelectronics.com/w/manufacturing-corporation-psmc-complete-landmark-agreement-for-technology-transfer-to-build-india-s-first-semiconductor-fab\" target=\"_blank\">Tata Electronics said</a>, which can be used in AI, automotive, computing and data storage industries.</p><p>The U.K.'s Clas-SiC Wafer Fab has also tied up with India's SiCSem to set up the country's first commercial compound fab in the eastern state of Odisha.</p><p>These compound semiconductors can be used in missiles, defence equipment, electric vehicles, consumer appliances and solar power inverters, according to a government press release.</p><p>\"The coming 3-4 years is pivotal for advancing India's semiconductor goals,\" said Sujay Shetty, managing director of semiconductor at PwC India.</p><p>Establishing operational silicon fabrication facilities and overcoming technical and infrastructural hurdles that extend beyond incentives will be a key milestone, according to Shetty.</p></div><h2><a></a>Opportunities beyond fab</h2><div><p>Fabrication sites need to meet stringent requirements, such as being in areas free from floods and vibrations, with reliable road connectivity — which can present ongoing logistical considerations for some regions.</p><p>India also needs specialty chemical suppliers that meet \"ultra-high purity standards essential for advanced semiconductor manufacturing,\" Shetty added.</p><p>Beyond chip fabrication plants, many medium-sized companies in India have shown interest in setting up chip testing and packaging units. Several Indian groups are also entering the segment, attracted by its higher margins and lower capital intensity compared to fabs.</p><p>\"Outsourced semiconductor assembly and testing (OSAT) represents a significant opportunity for India, though clarifying market access and demand channels will be important for sustained growth,\" says Shetty.</p><p>Success in this area will see India enter the global chip industry, but New Delhi is still a long way from locally developing and manufacturing the cutting-edge of chip technology: 2nm semiconductors.</p><p>These 2nm chips offer better performance and power efficiency due to their smaller transistor size. Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Corporation will start mass-producing cutting-edge 2nm chips later this year, <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/8fd79522-e34f-4633-bc87-ef0aae2d9159\" target=\"_blank\">according to an FT report</a>.</p></div><div><p>NEW DELHI, INDIA - MAY 14: Union Minister of Railways, Information and Broadcasting, Electronics and Information Technology Ashwini Vaishnaw  briefing the media on Cabinet decisions at National Media Centre  on May 14, 2025 in New Delhi, India. </p><p>Hindustan Times | Hindustan Times | Getty Images</p></div><div><p>Last week, Indian minister Ashwini Vaishnaw, who was in Bengaluru to inaugurate a new office of semiconductor design firm ARM, said the British company will design the \"most advanced chips used in AI servers, drones, mobile phone chips of 2 nm\" from the south Indian city.</p><p>But experts say the role of local talent is likely to be limited to non-core design testing and validation, as the core intellectual property for chip designs is often held in locations like the U.S. or Singapore, where established IP regimes support such activities.</p><p>\"India has sufficient talent in design space, because unlike semiconductor manufacturing and testing that has come up in the last 2 years, design has been there since 1990s,\" said Jayanth BR, a recruiter with over 15 years of experience in hiring for global semiconductor companies in India.</p><p>He said global companies usually outsource \"block-level\" design validation work to India.</p><p>Going beyond this is something India's government will need to solve if it wants to fulfil its semiconductor ambitions.</p><p>\"India may consider updating its IP laws to address new forms of IP, like digital content and software. Of course, improving enforcement mechanisms will go a long way in protecting IP rights,\" says Sajai Singh, a partner at Mumbai-based JSA Advocates & Solicitors.</p><p>\"Our competition is with countries like the U.S., Europe, and Taiwan, which not only have strong IP laws, but also a more established ecosystem for chip design.\"</p></div></div>"

    "body": "<div><p>Stephen Miran, chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers, following a television interview outside the White House in Washington, DC, US, on Tuesday, June 17, 2025. </p><p>Aaron Schwartz | Bloomberg | Getty Images</p></div><div><p>Less than a week after taking his seat, Federal Reserve Governor Stephen Miran on Monday outlined the reasons why he thinks the central bank's benchmark interest rate is far too high and should be lowered aggressively.</p><p>Changes in tax and immigration policy along with easing rental costs, deregulation and incoming revenue for tariffs are creating a different economic landscape that allow the Fed to cut its benchmark rate by nearly 2 percentage points from its current level, the central banker said in remarks before the Economic Club of New York.</p><p>\"The Federal Reserve has been entrusted with the important goal of promoting price stability for the good of all American households and businesses, and I am committed to bringing inflation sustainably back to 2 percent,\" he said. \"However, leaving policy restrictive by such a large degree brings significant risks for the Fed's employment mandate.\"</p><p>Miran sees the confluence of policy changes from the White House lowering the neutral level of interest that neither restricts nor promotes growth. In remarks heavy with data and citations on theory and interest rate models such as the Taylor Rule, Miran said current monetary policy is significantly more restrictive than the prevailing attitude among his fellow policymakers.</p><p>Using standard policy rules, Miran thinks the federal funds rate, a level that banks charge each other for overnight lending but that influences a wide variety of other rates, should be in the low-2% area. The current funds rate following last week's reduction is targeted between 4%-4.25%.</p><p>\"The upshot is that monetary policy is well into restrictive territory,\" he said. \"Leaving short-term interest rates roughly 2 percentage points too tight risks unnecessary layoffs and higher unemployment.\"</p><p>The views, however, put Miran well outside consensus on the Federal Open Market Committee, where the current approach advocates more caution and a tepid move lower in rates over the next several years.</p><p>At its <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2025/09/17/fed-rate-decision-september-2025.html\">meeting last week</a>, the FOMC voted 11-1 to lower by a quarter percentage point. Miran was the sole dissenter, opting for a half-point cut and putting his individual dot on the committee's \"dot plot\" of expectations in a place that would imply another 1.25 percentage points in reductions this year.</p><p>Earlier Monday, St. Louis Fed President Alberto Musalem, who like Miran is a voter on the FOMC this year, said <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2025/09/22/st-louis-fed-president-musalem-sees-limited-room-for-more-interest-rate-cuts.html\">he sees little room</a> for further cuts. Likewise, Atlanta President Raphael Bostic — who doesn't vote this year — also told The Wall Street Journal he would not support further reductions this year.</p><p>President Donald Trump appointed Miran to the Fed position following former Governor Adriana Kugler's surprise resignation in early August. Like Trump, Miran has been a harsh Fed critic, though he and others described the air at the meeting as collegial and professional.</p><p>Miran pressed his case Monday for lower rates, insisting that inflation is on its way down, particularly in the housing market where cooling rents that had not shown up in the data now will become more apparent.</p><p>Though pushing for cuts, Miran said he is optimistic about economic growth, two positions that under conventional thinking would be at odds. </p><p>\"My view is that policy is roughly 2 points too restrictive, which is considerably restrictive,\" he said during a question-and-answer session after his speech. \"Even though I am expecting growth to be a little better in the future, that could get derailed unnecessarily so and create an output gap where one need not exist if we don't get policy closer to neutral.\"</p><p>He further cited other administration policies, such as its clamp down on immigration, its move to lower business regulations and cut taxes, and the revenue that will be generated from tariffs and its impact on the budget deficit as disinflationary factors.</p><p>\"Labor market statistics and anecdotal evidence suggest border policy is exerting a major impact on the economy,\" he said. \"America's regulatory patchwork has become a material impediment to growth.\"</p><p>Economists at the Fed and elsewhere continue to worry that Trump's tariffs will have a longer-term upward push on inflation. However, Miran said \"relatively small changes in some goods prices have led to what I view as unreasonable levels of concern.\"</p><p>Recent inflation readings, though, have shown prices moving higher and further away from the Fed's 2% inflation mandate.</p><p>Miran is expected to fill the remainder of a term that expires in Jan. 31, 2026, then move back to his position as chair of the Council of Economic Advisers. He peppered his speech with references to CEA research.</p></div>"

That gives the deal an enterprise value of $4.9 billion. </p><p>The pact also includes a contingent value right worth up to $22.50 a share based on potential clinical and regulatory achievements for Metsera's medicines, which could bring the total value to $70 a share. </p><p>The deal is expected to close at the end of the year. Shares of Metsera rose more than 60% in premarket trading on Monday, while Pfizer's stock rose more than 1%. </p><p>The move comes after a string of setbacks for Pfizer in the obesity space. The pharmaceutical giant struggled to develop its own lead obesity drug candidate, danuglipron, before deciding to <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2025/04/14/pfizer-scraps-daily-weight-loss-pill-danuglipron.html\">scrap it entirely in April </a>due to safety concerns. Pfizer <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2023/06/26/pfizer-to-end-development-of-experimental-obesity-pill-lotiglipron.html\">also discontinued</a> a different once-daily pill in June 2023 due to elevated liver enzymes in patients who received it. </p><p>Pfizer has earlier-stage obesity drugs in its pipeline that work in different ways, but the company has faced mounting investor pressure to accelerate its push into the market.</p><p>The opportunity could be huge. Some analysts expect the weight loss drug space could be worth roughly $100 billion by the 2030s, with room for new rivals to compete with popular injections from <span><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/LLY/\">Eli Lilly</a><span><span></span></span></span> and <span><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/NVO/\">Novo Nordisk</a><span><span></span></span></span>.</p><p>Metsera, founded in 2022, brings a pipeline of both oral and injectable treatments with different targets that the company had picked up through its own licensing and acquisition deals. That includes a GLP-1 drug called MET-233i, which helped patients lose up to 8.4% of their weight in 36 days in a small, early-stage trial. Metsera is developing that treatment as a potential once-monthly injectable, meaning that patients can take it less frequently than existing weekly injections.</p><p>Metsera's pipeline also includes a monthly drug targeting a hormone called amylin, along with two oral GLP-1 candidates \"expected to begin trials imminently,\" Pfizer said in a release. </p><p>\"The proposed acquisition of Metsera aligns with our focus on directing our investments to the most impactful opportunities and propels Pfizer into this key therapeutic area,\" Pfizer CEO Albert Bourla said in a statement. \"We are excited to apply our deep cardiometabolic experience and manufacturing and commercial infrastructure to accelerate a portfolio that includes potential best-in-class injectables.\"</p><p>In a note on Monday, Leerink Partners analyst David Risinger said the firm estimates Metsera's obesity candidates have the potential to generate more than $5 billion in combined peak annual sales. In a separate note on Monday, JPMorgan analyst Chris Schott said Metsera's experimental drugs \"should accelerate\" Pfizer's entry into the market. </p><p>The New York-based Metsera went public this year in one of the biggest biotech listings of 2025. It is among several companies racing to develop next-generation obesity treatments following the success of weekly injections such as Eli Lilly's obesity drug Zepbound and Novo Nordisk's rival Wegovy. </p></div></div>"

    "body": "<div><p>President Donald Trump on Friday announced that the fee employers must pay for an H-1B visa will be <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2025/09/19/trump-overhaul-h-1b-visa.html\">raised</a> to $100,000.</p><p><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2025/09/20/trump-h-1b-visa-tech-foreign-governments.html\">Companies scrambled to respond</a>, CNBC reported Saturday, and social media users are posting about what this change means for H-1B visa workers.</p><p>Here's a breakdown of the new H-1B fees:</p><h3>What did Trump change?</h3><p>As of Sunday, H-1B visa applications will require a $100,000 payment. Previously, visa fees ranged from $2,000 to $5,000 per application, depending on the size of the company, according to the Immigration Law Group.</p><p>Employers now must have documentation of the payment prior to filing an H-1B petition on behalf of a worker. Applicants will have their petitions restricted for 12 months until the payment is made, according to the <a href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/09/restriction-on-entry-of-certain-nonimmigrant-workers/\" target=\"_blank\">White House</a>.</p><h3>Who does this affect?</h3><p>The fee will be applied only to new H-1B applicants, not renewals or current visa holders, and will be implemented in the upcoming lottery cycle, according to White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt.</p><p>Those who already have H-1B visas and are located outside the U.S. will not be required to pay the fee in order to reenter, she said.</p><p>Leavitt also clarified that the $100,000 is a one-time payment and not an annual charge, after Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick said Friday that the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2025/09/19/trump-overhaul-h-1b-visa.html\">fee would be annual</a>.</p><p>Exceptions can be made for any immigrant whose employment is deemed essential in the national interest by the Secretary of Homeland Security and does not pose a threat to the security or welfare of the U.S., according to the White House.</p><p>Employees with B visas who have start dates prior to October 2026 will receive additional guidance in order to prevent those temporary business visas being used as a workaround for H-1B visas, the White House said.</p><h3>Who are these workers and why are they needed?</h3><p>H-1B visas are designed to allow highly skilled foreign professionals to work in specialty occupations when employers can't find qualified American workers to fill the roles. Many jobs in the fields of science, technology, engineering and math, or STEM, that generally require at least a bachelor's degree qualify.</p><p>Companies in the tech and finance sectors rely heavily on these specially skilled immigrants, particularly from India and China, which accounted for 71% and 11.7% of visa holders last year, respectively, according to U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services.</p><h3>How many H-1B visas does the tech industry use every year?</h3><p>The current annual cap for H-1B visas is 65,000, along with an additional 20,000 visas for foreign professionals with a master's degree or doctorate from a U.S. institution, according to USCIS. A lottery system is used to select additional petitions if demand exceeds the cap.</p><p>Since 2012, about 60% or more of approved H-1B workers had computer-related jobs, according to Pew Research.</p><p><span><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/AMZN/\">Amazon</a><span><span></span></span></span> was the top employer for H-1B holders in fiscal year 2025, sponsoring more than 10,000 applicants by the end of June, according to USCIS. <span><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/MSFT/\">Microsoft</a><span><span></span></span></span>, <span><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/META/\">Meta</a><span><span></span></span></span> and IT company Tata Consulting Services had more than 5,000 each, while <span><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/AAPL/\">Apple</a><span><span></span></span></span> and <span><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/GOOGL/\">Google</a><span><span></span></span></span> rounded out the top six with more than 4,000 approvals each.</p><p><strong>WATCH: </strong><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/video/2025/09/22/coreweave-ceo-on-h-1b-visas-additional-fee-is-sand-in-the-gears-access-to-talent.html\">CoreWeave CEO on H-1B visas: Additional fee is 'sand in the gears' for access to talent</a></p></div>"

The two executives informed Kimmel on Monday, the person added.</p><p>Local station owners learned of the show's return on Monday when Disney made the public announcement, according to two people familiar with the matter.</p></div><div><p>Jimmy Kimmel at the Disney Advertising Upfront on Tuesday, May 13, 2025.</p><p>Michael Le Brecht | Disney General Entertainment Content | Getty Images</p></div><h2><a></a>Broadcast pushback</h2><div><p>\"Jimmy Kimmel Live!\" was suspended after <span><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/NXST/\">Nexstar Media Group</a><span><span></span></span></span>, which owns more than 200 broadcast TV stations across the U.S., announced its stations affiliated with ABC would <a href=\"https://www.nexstar.tv/nexstar-abc-affiliates-to-preempt-jimmy-kimmel-live-indefinitely-beginning-tonight/\" target=\"_blank\">preempt</a> Kimmel's show. <span><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/SBGI/\">Sinclair</a><span><span></span></span></span>, another large broadcast TV station owner, similarly threatened to preempt the program.</p><p>Sinclair said in a <a href=\"https://sbgi.net/sinclair-says-kimmel-suspension-is-not-enough-calls-on-fcc-and-abc-to-take-additional-action/\" target=\"_blank\">release</a> last week that it would not lift the suspension on \"Jimmy Kimmel Live!\" until it had formal discussions with ABC \"regarding the network's commitment to professionalism and accountability.\"</p><p>As of Monday evening, a Sinclair representative said the company still planned to preempt the broadcast.</p><p>\"Beginning Tuesday night, Sinclair will be preempting Jimmy Kimmel Live! across our ABC affiliate stations and replacing it with news programming,\" according to a statement from Sinclair. \"Discussions with ABC are ongoing as we evaluate the show's potential return.\"</p><p>Sinclair owns and operates nearly 40 ABC-affiliate stations across the U.S.,  including one in Washington, D.C., according to its <a href=\"https://sbgi.net/tv-stations/\" target=\"_blank\">website</a>.</p><p>A Nexstar representative didn't comment on the matter.</p><p>Kimmel said during his monologue last Monday that the \"MAGA gang\" was \"desperately trying to characterize this kid who murdered Charlie Kirk as anything other than one of them and doing everything they can to score political points from it.\"</p><p>\"In between the finger-pointing there was grieving. On Friday the White House flew the flags at half-staff, which got some criticism, but on a human level you can see how hard the president is taking this,\" he continued, teeing up a clip of Trump on the White House lawn in which the president fields a question on Kirk but swiftly pivots to talking about construction.</p><p>Immediately following ABC's suspension of the show, everyone from entertainers to politicians weighed in on whether Kimmel should return to air, and whether the incident should affect station owners' broadcast licenses.</p><p><a href=\"https://www.fcc.gov/\" target=\"_blank\">Federal Communications Commission</a> Chair Brendan Carr had suggested ABC's broadcast license was at risk in light of Kimmel's comments, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2025/09/18/jimmy-kimmel-charlie-kirk-fcc-carr.html\">telling CNBC last week, \"we're not done yet\"</a> with changes to the media landscape.</p><p>Trump <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2025/09/18/trump-jimmy-kimmel-tv-network-licenses.html\">suggested</a> the federal government might revoke broadcast station licenses for the networks that are \"against\" him.</p><p>The FCC didn't immediately respond to a request for comment Monday.</p><p>Networks like ABC are part of a system that requires them to obtain over-the-air spectrum licenses from the federal government in order to broadcast across local stations.

He's <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2025/09/18/trump-jimmy-kimmel-tv-network-licenses.html\">particularly singled out ABC and NBC</a> for what he called \"unfair coverage of Republicans and/or Conservatives.\"</p><p>Current and former late show hosts <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2025/09/18/jimmy-kimmel-kirk-colbert-letterman-trump.html\">rallied behind Kimmel</a> after his suspension and said the president's influence amounted to censorship.
