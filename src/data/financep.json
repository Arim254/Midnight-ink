The reading was the lowest since April and comes with nonessential government operations slated to close at midnight.</p><p>In addition to the weakness on the main reading, the \"present situation\" index hit its lowest in a year.</p><p>\"Consumers' assessment of business conditions was much less positive than in recent months, while their appraisal of current job availability fell for the ninth straight month to reach a new multiyear low,\" said Stephanie Guichard, the organization's senior economist for global indicators.</p><p>Though the labor market has shown considerable weakness this year, employment availability in August was slightly better than the prior month.</p><p>The Bureau of Labor Statistics, in what could be its last data release until the spending impasse on Capitol Hill is resolved, said job openings totaled 7.23 million, up 19,000 from July though down 422,000, or 5.5%, from the same period a year ago.</p><p>The bureau's Job Openings and Labor Statistics report, which Federal Reserve officials watch closely to gauge labor market slack, showed a slower pace in both hiring and total separations. Quits fell by 75,000  for a category looked at as a gauge of worker confidence for finding new jobs after leaving their present one.</p><p>Labor market stability is an important consideration for the Fed as officials contemplate the next move for interest rates. Markets widely expect the central bank to lower its benchmark borrowing rate by half a percentage point by the end of the year, with cuts at the October and December meetings.</p><p>\"My baseline outlook doesn't see the labor market softening much further – but there are risks,\" Boston Fed President Susan Collins said Tuesday. \"In particular, I see some increased risk that labor demand may fall significantly short of supply, leading to a more meaningful and unwelcome increase in the unemployment rate.\"</p><p>Should the spending impasse be resolved by Friday, the BLS is expected to show payroll growth of 51,000 in September, following just 22,000 in August.</p><p><strong>This is breaking news.

The Labor Department has indicated it will cease data collection and releases on jobs while the impasse continues, as the pivotal nonfarm payrolls report looms Friday.</p><p>Earlier in the day, Fed Governor Philip Jefferson also noted that he supported the FOMC's decision earlier in September to lower its benchmark borrowing rate by a quarter percentage point. Jefferson, a permanent FOMC voter, did not provide guidance on where he expects policy to go.</p><p>\"Considering the outlook I described, I see the risks to employment as tilted to the downside and risks to inflation to the upside. It follows that both sides of our mandate are under pressure,\" he said.</p><p>Market pricing indicates a near-certainty that the FOMC will approve another cut at its October meeting.</p></div></div>"

    "body": "<div><div><p>Venture capitalist Chamath Palihapitiya.</p><p>Mark Kauzlarich/Bloomberg via Getty Images</p></div><div><p>Chamath Palihapitiya, once dubbed Wall Street's \"SPAC King,\" is back with a new blank-check vehicle and a promise to do better after a bruising track record.</p><p>Palihapitiya on Monday launched the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/AEXA\">American Exceptionalism Acquisition Corp. A (AEXA)</a>, a $345 million SPAC that he said was more than five times oversubscribed, drawing $1.4 billion in demand. The vehicle, which will trade on the New York Stock Exchange, is designed to target companies in AI, energy, defense and decentralized finance.</p><p>\"These are areas where I believe American entrepreneurship can still lead the world, and where a disciplined, institutionally backed vehicle can add value,\" the 49-year-old the Social Capital CEO and former Facebook executive said <a href=\"https://x.com/chamath/status/1972776673495097456\" target=\"_blank\">in a post on X.</a></p><p>The SPAC was up 3% in early trading Tuesday.</p><p>Palihapitiya once helped ignite the SPAC boom among retail investors during the pandemic in 2020, but his first wave of deals mostly lead to poor returns. <span><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/SPCE/\">Virgin Galactic</a><span><span></span></span></span> lost more than 90% of its value, while <span><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/CLOV/\">Clover Health</a><span><span></span></span></span> trades around only $3 compared to the $15 peak after regulatory scrutiny and a short-seller report. <span><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/OPEN/\">Opendoor</a><span><span></span></span></span>, which had fallen into a penny stock earlier this year, became a meme name supported by retail traders, but the stock is still about half of its record price in 2021.</p><p>SPACs are <a href=\"https://hbr.org/2021/07/spacs-what-you-need-to-know\" target=\"_blank\">special purpose acquisition companies</a>, which raise capital and use the cash to merge with a private company and take it public, usually within two years.</p></div><h2><a></a>Improving the SPAC structure</h2><div><p>Now, Palihapitiya said AEXA is structured differently. The SPAC will carry no warrants, and his compensation vests only if shares rise at least 50% after a deal. Meanwhile, just 1.3% of the allocation went to retail investors, he said.</p><p>\"I want to temper retail investors' involvement with my SPACs,\" he said. \"This deal was built for institutional investors. Specifically, 98.7 percent went to large institutions, each picked explicitly by me.\"</p><p>Palihapitiya's return comes as he has recast himself both politically and publicly. A longtime Democrat donor who once floated a run for California governor, he has more recently aligned with President Donald Trump's politics. At the same time, he has built a media platform through the All-In Podcast, where he and other tech investors debate politics and markets, often favoring the views of the Trump Administration.</p><p>SPACs are <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2025/09/14/wall-streets-spac-engine-restarts-as-deal-volume-hits-post-2021-high.html\">having a resurgence</a> after a sharp, two-year slowdown as <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2021/04/21/spac-transactions-come-to-a-halt-amid-sec-crackdown-cooling-retail-investor-interest.html\">regulatory scrutiny</a>, disappointing post-merger performance and rising rates dampened investor appetite. Many SPACs liquidated rather than find deals, and the once red-hot sector became a cautionary tale. Now, with traditional initial public offerings returning and the broader stock market charging ahead, dealmakers are dusting off the structure.</p><p>\"No one can predict what will happen in the future so be safe out there and no crying in the casino,\" Palihapitiya said.</p></div></div>"

    "body": "<div><div><p>Flags flutter in front of the Hollywood Sign after U.S. President Donald Trump ordered a 100% tariff on foreign-made films in Los Angeles, California, U.S., Sept. 29, 2025. </p><p>Daniel Cole | Reuters</p></div><div><p>There was a time when Hollywood simply referred to a neighborhood in the central region of Los Angeles.</p><p>These days, \"Hollywood\" has come to represent the entire domestic entertainment business — and it's at a crossroads.</p><p>Its namesake area is no longer the bustling production hub it once was, as studios have chased tax benefits and lower labor costs overseas. It's more expensive than ever to make a movie or television series, especially after the pandemic and the writers and actors strikes which reshaped how creatives are paid in the new streaming economy.</p><p>Many in the industry have sought to rectify the movement of thousands of jobs to other domestic filming hubs — like Georgia, New York, Texas, New Mexico and North Carolina — and international locations including Canada, the United Kingdom, Ireland, Hungary, Croatia, Romania, Australia and New Zealand.</p><p>In July, California Gov. Gavin Newsom increased the state's total film and TV tax credit to $750 million, nearly doubling the previous cap, to try to encourage more productions to film in Los Angeles.</p><p>President Donald Trump put a spotlight on the issue again Monday when he <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2025/09/29/trump-movie-furniture-tariffs.html\">reiterated tariff threats</a> on films made outside of the United States.</p><p>\"Our movie making business has been stolen from the United States of America, by other Countries, just like stealing 'candy from a baby,'\" he wrote in a post on social media, adding that he would impose a 100% tariff on \"any and all movies that are made outside of the United States.\"</p><p>Trump made similar comments in May. Then as now, it is unclear how he plans to implement these duties, who they would target and who would foot the potential bill. Actor Jon Voight, who Trump appointed as \"special ambassador\" to Hollywood, said tariffs would only be implemented in \"certain limited circumstances,\" and the administration would focus on <a href=\"http://rollingstone.com/tv-movies/tv-movie-news/donald-trump-revives-tariffs-movies-made-outside-us-1235437188/#:~:text=Following%20Trump's%20initial%20tariff%20announcement,on%20Trump's%20latest%20tariff%20call.\" target=\"_blank\">developing federal tax incentives</a>, revising the tax code, creating co-production treaties with other countries and offering subsidies for infrastructure.</p><p>As Trump revives his threats, there are still numerous unanswered questions about how the U.S. could put a tariff on movies — and whether the move would really help bring production back to Hollywood.</p><p>\"Since movies aren't goods, they're services, it remains unclear how a tariff could be placed on a service, but should some logistical loophole be found and enforced, it'll cause chaos within the entertainment industry,\" said Mike Proulx, vice president and research director at Forrester, in a statement Monday. \"Then the question becomes what's next? Where's the line between a movie and a limited time series? What about the ad industry that saves money by shooting commercials outside the US?\" </p><p>The production of film and TV isn't always simple. Some productions will shoot parts of a film internationally and pieces of it domestically. Would films be taxed based on the percentage of the film that was shot outside the U.S.? What would that mean for foreign films seeking release in the the country?</p><p>\"What if the primary studio is in the U.S., but the film has to shoot on location, because the ... story takes the ... characters on a journey. Is there a threshold?\" asked Alicia Reese, analyst at Wedbush. \"There are just too many questions.\"</p><p>Industry experts also worry about how the duties, if they are even enforceable, could affect relationships with other countries. Hollywood relies on international box office sales to recoup lofty film budgets. China has already limited the number of Hollywood-made movies it will showcases on screens. Other regions <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2025/02/03/trump-tariffs-could-threaten-hollywood-production-box-office-recovery.html\">could retaliate and do the same</a>.</p><p>\"I strongly support bringing movie making back to California and the U.S.,\" Democratic Sen. Adam Schiff of California said in a statement Monday. \"Congress should pass a bipartisan globally-competitive federal film incentive to bring back production and jobs, rather than levy a tariff that could have unintended and damaging consequences.\"</p></div><h2><a></a>Dollars and cents</h2><div><p>At the end of the day, Hollywood's productions woes all come down to one thing — money.</p><p>Budgets are getting tighter. Streaming fundamentally changed the media landscape, fewer people are going to movie theaters and studios are no longer generating significant revenue from DVD sales. So studios have to grip their purse strings tighter or face the wrath of investors who are still trying to calculate what the dissolution of linear TV, and its lucrative ad revenue, means for media titans like <span><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/DIS/\">Disney</a><span><span></span></span></span>, <span><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/CMCSA/\">Universal</a><span><span></span></span></span>, <span><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/WBD/\">Warner Bros.</a><span><span></span></span></span> and <span><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/PSKY/\">Paramount</a><span><span></span></span></span>.</p><p>Even before the pandemic and the dual labor strikes, Hollywood was filming movies and television in other parts of the U.S. and internationally.</p><p>In some cases, this was because the script dictated a specific international city or naturally occurring landscape to suit the story being told. It would have been difficult, for example, to film the Lord of the Rings franchise or \"Game Of Thrones\" entirely on the backlot of a Los Angeles studio.</p><p>The crux of the issue comes down to the sound stages.</p><p>Part of the exodus from Los Angeles is also the result of the development of domestic production hubs that offer better financial rewards, like tax credits and cash rebates, than what is available on the West Coast. Over the last two decades, 38 states have shelled out <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2024/03/21/arts/states-hollywood-film-tax-incentives.html\" target=\"_blank\">more than $25 billion in filming incentives</a>, according to a report from The New York Times.</p><p>These incentives have allowed states like Georgia to develop infrastructure for big-budget productions and build out a skilled workforce of local crew members, craftsmen and technicians. Georgia offers these monetary perks as a way of not only creating jobs in production, but bolstering economic growth in the communities around those filming locations. Hotels, restaurants, lumber yards, vehicle rental companies and even gas stations get a bump from having projects produced locally.</p><p>International production hubs are the second piece of this puzzle. Sites outside the U.S. not only offer enticing film incentives, but also cheaper labor and even health care. In fact, Los Angeles ranked as the sixth-best location for filming according to a <a href=\"https://prodpro.com/blog/2025-tv-film-outlook-report/\" target=\"_blank\">survey of studio executives published in January by ProdPro</a>, a company that tracks production trends. Toronto, Canada; the U.K.; Vancouver, Canada; Central Europe and Australia all ranked higher than Los Angeles.</p><p>Canada, known as Hollywood North, has been the home of Hollywood film and television production for decades. Shows like \"Riverdale,\" \"Suits,\" \"Supernatural,\" \"Once Upon a Time,\" \"Schitt's Creek\" and \"The Handsmaid's Tale\" were all filmed just north of the border from Los Angeles. On the movie front, \"Mean Girls,\" \"Twilight,\" \"My Big Fat Greek Wedding,\" \"American Psycho\" and \"Scream VI\" are some of the titles that were shot in Canada.</p><p>Like Georgia, Canada offers an enticing tax credit for stateside studios, but has also has developed a top-notch workforce of industry talent in front of and behind the camera.</p><p>And competition abroad is heating up. More countries have bolstered their filming infrastructure, and increased their generous tax incentives. Many nations also have looser rules on what kinds of projects qualify for the financial benefits. New Zealand, the U.K., Ireland, Iceland, Australia, Norway, Italy, Hungary, Germany and the Czech Republic are all jockeying for productions — <a href=\"https://prodpro.com/blog/2025-tv-film-outlook-report/\" target=\"_blank\">and they are taking share</a>, according to data from ProdPro.</p><p>For example, Australia and New Zealand saw a 14% increase in the production of projects costing $40 million or more between 2022 and 2024. Meanwhile, the U.S. experienced a 26% decline.</p><p>\"People are still going to have to film on location,\" Wedbush's Reese said, noting that the industry is not going to completely shift the kinds of stories being told to adhere to filming locations only available in the U.S. \"There are plenty of pieces of that movie, or parts of that movie, that are filmed on a sound stage and that sound stage could just as easily exist in the U.S. as it could anywhere else.\"</p><p>\"And that's where the question lies: how do we get the sound stages?\" she continued.</p><p>Reese noted that Los Angeles has already made moves to encourage studios to use its existing infrastructure with Newsom's new tax incentives.</p><p>\"We need to create a better tax structure to encourage more productions, the base of the production, the sound stages, to be located in the U.S.,\" she said.</p><p><em>Disclosure: Comcast is the parent company of Fandango and NBCUniversal, which owns CNBC. Versant would become the new parent company of Fandango and CNBC upon Comcast's planned spinoff of Versant.</em></p></div></div>"

Decisions that will not always be comfortable for our party,\" Starmer said, adding that the result of hard work would be \"a new country, a fairer country, a land of dignity and respect.\"</p></div><h2><a></a>Under pressure</h2><div><p>Starmer is undoubtedly under pressure given Labour's falling poll ratings but division within the party's rank and file means his leadership appears to be under increasing threat, with Andy Burnham, the current Labour Mayor of Manchester, seen as the main potential challenger.</p><p>It's a significant fall from grace for Starmer after his party won 34% of the vote in the July 2024 election. The party's support has slipped to 21% while Reform UK is seen with 27% of the vote, <a href=\"https://yougov.co.uk/politics/articles/53059-yougov-mrp-shows-a-reform-uk-government-a-near-certainty-if-an-election-were-held-tomorrow\" target=\"_blank\">according to the latest YouGov poll</a>, meaning a Reform UK government would be a \"near-certainty if an election were held tomorrow,\" according to YouGov.</p><p>Secretary of State for Work and Pensions Pat McFadden told CNBC Monday that Labour had to face up to the threat posed by Reform UK.</p><p>\"I was a campaign coordinator at the last election and I said within days of it that we would be facing different opponents on the right next time. I think what it really comes down to is a fight between opportunity and grievance and I'm very happy to stand on [the] side of opportunity,\" he told CNBC's Ritika Gupta on the sidelines of the conference. </p><p>Aside from external threats, there are internal divisions, with wrangling among Labour lawmakers limiting the ruling party's ability to change policy, with several significant U-turns on welfare spending reforms in recent months.</p><p>As such, anticipated spending cuts have not materialized and British Chancellor Rachel Reeves is expected to announced tax hikes in her next Autumn Budget to fill a yawning fiscal hole <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2025/08/08/the-uk-government-wont-admit-it-but-tax-rises-are-coming.html\">that could be as much as £50 billion ($67.2 billion), although estimates vary</a>.</p></div><div><p><img src=\"https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/108204894-17591375051759137502-41868968199-1080pnbcnews.jpg?v=1759137504&w=750&h=422&vtcrop=y\" alt=\"Resolution Foundation: Reeves will probably look at personal taxes\" /><span></span><span><div><p><span>watch now</span><span></span></p></div></span></p></div><div><p>Reeves has repeatedly refused to break self-imposed fiscal rules that constrain borrowing and aim to balance the budget and reduce debt by 2029/2030.</p><p>In another potential blow to the Labour leadership, Reeves could be forced to break <a href=\"https://labour.org.uk/change/strong-foundations/\" target=\"_blank\">a Labour manifesto pledge</a> to not raise taxes on working people, specifically National Insurance contributions (which fund social security and pensions), Income tax thresholds, or VAT.</p><p>In last year's budget, businesses bore the brunt of <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2024/10/30/uk-budget-labour-rachel-reeves-october-2024.html\">£40 billion worth of tax hikes</a> and since then, industry heads have pressed the government to resist another tax raid that they say has harmed jobs, investment and, ultimately, growth.</p></div><div><p><img src=\"https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/108204890-17591369001759136898-41868873000-1080pnbcnews.jpg?v=1759136899&w=750&h=422&vtcrop=y\" alt=\"CBI: UK government must not raise taxes further on businesses\" /><span></span><span><div><p><span>watch now</span><span></span></p></div></span></p></div><div><p>In her own conference speech on Monday, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2025/09/29/the-uks-finance-minister-keeps-public-guessing-over-tax-hikes.html\">Reeves hinted that further tax rises could be on the horizon</a> but gave little detail on where the axe might fall, saying, \"in the months ahead, we will face further tests. With the choices to come made all the harder by harsh global headwinds and the long-term damage done to our economy, which is becoming ever clearer.\"</p><p>Secretary of State for Business and Trade Peter Kyle, told CNBC Tuesday that the \"manifesto stands\" but that the party was \"very clear that these decisions are made at the point of the budget,\" he told CNBC's Ritika Gupta.</p></div></div>"
