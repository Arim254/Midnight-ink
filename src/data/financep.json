Differing from generative AI, agents act independently, can initiate actions, and recall previous work they performed. Some examples include <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2025/01/23/openai-operator-ai-agent-can-automate-tasks-like-vacation-planning.html\">OpenAI's Operator</a> and Anthropic's Claude.</p><p>AI debt is the cost of not implementing nascent autonomous systems correctly, Mark Hoffman, an expert at Asana's Work Innovation Lab, told CNBC Make It.</p><p>\"Those costs could be money costs. They could also be lost time, which relates to money. It could also be a lot of things that you have to undo, which is costly from a financial standpoint. It burns people out to have to do it. It's all of the costs associated with poor implementation,\" Hoffman said.</p><p>The report outlined that the debt could manifest as security risks, poor data quality, low impact AI agents which will waste time and resources for human employees, and a management skills gap.</p><p>Hoffman said this is not an exhaustive list and the \"debt\" could look like a bunch of code created by AI that doesn't work right or AI-generated content that nobody is using.</p><p>New research from BetterUp Labs and Stanford Social Media Lab even found that 40% of desk workers in the U.S. have received <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2025/09/23/ai-generated-workslop-is-destroying-productivity-and-teams-researchers-say.html\">AI-generated \"workslop,\"</a> which the researchers defined as content that looks good but lacks any substance.</p></div><div><p><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2025/09/23/ai-generated-workslop-is-destroying-productivity-and-teams-researchers-say.html\"><img src=\"https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/108202475-1758579102271-gettyimages-700712909-bld240699.jpeg?v=1758579133&w=160&h=90\" /></a></p></div><div><p>It's created almost two hours of extra work for people who encountered it, a $186 invisible tax per month, and a $9 million hit to productivity in a year, per the research.</p><p>\"There's large investment going into this space right now, and ultimately it's a question of whether those investments will pay off,\" Hoffman said.</p><p>Henry Ajder, founder of AI consulting firm Latent Space Advisory, and an advisor to the U.K. government, Meta, and AI video startup Synthesia, emphasized the need for thoughtful implementation and structures.</p><p>\"People who are CTOs or innovation officers, the good ones I've worked with, the ones who I think I did the best position to succeed with it, they aren't sugar coating the disruption that this is going to cost ... as with any kind of fundamental rework, you are going to have problems, you're gonna have bumps in the road,\" Ajder said in an interview.</p></div><h2><a></a>'It's not a magical silver bullet'</h2><div><p>Asana's report found that despite AI adoption surging to 70% in 2025 from 52% in 2024, workers are also facing higher levels of digital burnout.</p><p>Digital exhaustion increased to 84% in 2025 from 75% the prior year, while unmanageable workloads also rose to 77%, per the report.</p><p>Mona Mourshed, founding global CEO of Generation, a U.S.-based employment organization, told CNBC that despite companies rolling out AI tools and encouraging the use of it, workers are still struggling.</p><p>\"The core reason that they're struggling, and we know this from also talking to our own alumni, is that the use case for how and why are you supposed to use this AI tool in the flow of your work is often missing,\" Mourshed said.</p><p>\"Without a clear understanding of what is the use case that's going to make this particular task better, faster, cheaper ... that's what leads to the exhaustion, because you don't know what the intended outcome is,\" she added.</p><p>Mourshed noted that companies are investing in AI in the hopes that overnight work will be performed better, faster and cheaper, but they aren't offering the necessary training or guidelines to enable improvements.</p><p>\"It's not a magical silver bullet, and all of a sudden it does everything you want once you install it ... it's going to be a much more painful journey to get to those benefits than companies that have thought it through.\"</p><p>AI expert Ajder said the correct strategy is carefully testing AI use and building infrastructure around it rather than rushing into the race unprepared.</p><p>\"You don't start by just embedding, you start by piloting, you start by scoping, by sandboxing, by trialing these systems,\" he said.</p><p>This includes everything from the correct training for employees, to thinking about the kind of AI models the business might need. It's much harder to respond to mistakes or malfunctions when there's no procedure in place.</p><p>\"So I'm not saying that you can't take risk thoughtfully when it comes to using AI, but it has to be calculated and it has to be scoped,\" Ajder said.</p></div></div>"

Behind them is a depiction of the seal of the Federal Reserve.</p><p>The image appears to be \"AI-generated or digitally illustrated,\" according to visual analysis by ChatGPT.</p><p>Trump has repeatedly criticized Powell for his cautious approach to cutting interest rates, nicknaming him \"Too Late Powell.\" The latest threat came even as the central bank lowered rates earlier this month for the first time this year. Powell's term as chair ends in May 2026.</p><p>The White House didn't immediately respond to CNBC's request for comment.</p><p>Firing the top central banker would be unprecedented as no U.S. president ever has attempted to do so, though others have criticized prior Fed chairs. A recent <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2025/05/22/supreme-court-federal-reserve-trump.html\">Supreme Court decision</a> indicated that the president does not have the authority to remove Fed officials at will.  Powell has said repeatedly that his firing is \"not permitted under the law.\"</p><p>The Trump White House has blasted Powell over renovations to the Fed's Washington headquarters, raising suspicion that Trump could try to remove the Fed leader for cause. Although lately Trump has eased his criticisms of the Fed building, while continuing to be vocal about Powell hurting the economy by keeping rates too high in his view.</p><p>Trump attempted to fire Fed Governor Lisa Cook in August on alleged mortgage fraud. The Supreme Court is set to rule on that matter soon. The Department of Justice on Friday <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2025/09/26/trump-fed-cook-scotus-markets.html\">said</a> in a Supreme Court filing that firing Cook for alleged misconduct would not harm the financial markets. Cook's attorneys argued in a prior filing to the high court that her removal could ruin Fed independence.</p><p>So far, the financial markets have shown little reaction to Trump's Powell threats or Cook's attempted firing. Though many economists and investors believe firing Powell before his term ends could cause longer-term interest rates to rise on the notion the Fed would start to act in Trump's interests and not according to its dual mandate from Congress of stable inflation and low unemployment.</p></div></div>"

    "body": "<div><div><p>Markeiz Ryan, 36, had a pretty good childhood growing up in Maryland, but the 2008 financial crisis changed things.</p><p>\"It wiped my mother's job away and it really made things tough for us around the time I graduated high school,\" Ryan tells CNBC Make It. \"I didn't have much of a financial security blanket to fall under. The best thing for me was to join the military so I wouldn't have to put my family into any more debt and I think that was the right decision.\"</p><p>Ryan joined the U.S. Air Force in 2010 and was stationed in various countries around the world, including Korea, Germany, and throughout Africa. In 2016, while living in Korea, Ryan got in trouble for breaking his curfew. He lost out on several months of pay, was restricted to his military base and demoted from staff sergeant to senior airman.</p><p>\"After this, I was very depressed and very sad,\" Ryan said. \"But that depression and sadness make you think about where your life is going and it makes you redirect your life into the right direction.\"</p></div><div><p>In Vietnam, Ryan lives off of roughly $4,000 a month.</p><p>Louis Corallo for CNBC Make It</p></div><div><p>In that period of time that Ryan was restricted to his military base, he planned a trip to visit a friend in Vietnam.</p><p>\"It just looked like so much fun and it really lived up to all the hype,\" he said. \"I ended up having the best time of my life, and that depression was [just] gone.\"</p><p>Ryan says that after that first trip to Vietnam and seeing how happy he was, he didn't want to let go of that feeling. He started planning his return to the country.</p><p>The veteran returned to his life in the Air Force and completed his service on a military base in Wyoming before being honorably discharged in 2019.</p></div><div><p>Ryan lives in a two-bedroom apartment in Ho Chi Minh City.</p><p>Louis Corallo for CNBC Make It</p></div><div><p>Soon after, Ryan relocated to Vietnam, where he lives off roughly $4,000 a month, according to documents reviewed by CNBC Make It.</p><p>Ryan suffers from spine arthritis, respiratory issues, auditory pain, and mental health challenges from his time in the military. He receives disability from Veterans Affairs.</p><p>His monthly income stems from several sources, including approximately $1,500 from VA disability, $1,000 from the GI Bill while he's pursuing a master's degree, and $900 to $1,300 from teaching English. Ryan also does occasional odd jobs like voiceover work, where his pay can range from $200 to $600 a month, and is an avid fan of day trading, where he averages about $300 a month.</p><p>\"This might not sound like a lot in America but trust me, this is more than enough to be middle or even above middle class in Vietnam,\" he says.</p></div><div><p>When Ryan moved to Vietnam, he bought a motorcycle to get around</p><p>Louis Corallo for CNBC Make It</p></div><div><p>Ryan lives in Ho Chi Minh City and has a two-bedroom, one-bathroom apartment in one of the country's tallest residential towers. He pays $850 a month in rent and his utilities round up to about $130, which includes electricity, water and housekeeping.</p><p>In addition to those expenses, Ryan also pays $1,000 a year for health insurance and $3 a week on gas for his motorcycle. What he spends on groceries varies from $100 to $400 a month, as he often alternates between cooking his own food or dining out frequently.</p><p>\"Vietnam is the number one safest place I've ever lived. I never have to look over my shoulder here. I noticed that there's this great level of calm,\" Ryan says. \"People are more focused on their day-to-day life and they're less focused on what's going on politically. It's a much more calm feeling.\"</p><p>Although Ryan loves living in Vietnam, one thing that irks him is the noise pollution.</p><p>\"There's a lot of honking, street sellers and sometimes karaoke really loudly, so if you are very intolerant to noise, this might not be the place for you,\" he says.</p></div><div><p>Ryan says Vietnam is now home and he has no plans of leaving.</p><p>Louis Corallo for CNBC Make It</p></div><div><p>Since moving to Vietnam, Ryan has made an effort to learn the language, but he admits he's still not the best at it.</p><p>\"I can never claim that I'm fluent in Vietnamese, but I do a lot better than most of my peers here,\" he says.</p><p>Ryan has been living in Vietnam for six years now, and says he has no plans of leaving.</p><p>\"If I leave, it's because Vietnam told me to leave. In America, I felt very unmotivated. I felt like no matter how hard you work, you're still in poverty. You're constantly chasing a standard that you can't really achieve,\" he says. \"Here in Vietnam, it takes a lot of the monetary pressure out of your day-to-day. You focus on what makes you happy, who you want to become and how you're going to get there.\"</p><p>This experience, he says, is the complete opposite of what his life was like back in the U.S.</p><p>\"Every day I wake up with a long to-do list of things I want to do, not the things that I need to do, and it's a completely different way of living. Even if you need to work 40 hours a week here, you're doing it as an investment in your future.

You should know how to do this by now</h2><div><p>Good money management, including finding ways to supplement your income if you're not making enough, is a skill that nobody is born with, Sethi said. Yet, many folks still feel ashamed when they don't know the next step they should take to boost their income or accomplish some other money goal.</p><p>\"If you're good at your job, if you've always been praised for being smart or capable, it can feel embarrassing to admit you don't know how to make more money outside of a paycheck,\" he wrote.</p><p>The truth is, you may need to ask for help, get some additional training or teach yourself through books or <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/make-it-smarter/\">online resources</a> in order to reach your goal. Negotiating your salary, for example, is a skill that certainly isn't innate, but can help you level up your income significantly if you learn the strategies that <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2025/05/20/tips-for-new-grads-to-negotiate-their-salaries.html\">career experts</a> and other <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2025/05/05/22-year-old-grad-says-shes-negotiated-every-job-offer-shes-gottenher-best-tip.html\">successful negotiators recommend</a>.</p></div><h2><a></a>2. Your talent should make achieving your goal easy</h2><div><p>Even if you have the skills and talent that make it seem like success will come easy, you'll probably need a bit of patience and sustained action, Sethi wrote.</p><p>Our culture that celebrates \"viral success stories\"<strong> </strong>and \"overnight millionaires\" makes it even easier to fall into the trap of believing your journey should be easy, \"But that's not how lasting success is built,\" he wrote.</p><p>Growing your income, especially if that involves adding a second income stream \"takes more than talent. It takes systems. It <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2025/09/01/sustainable-ambition-is-the-key-to-success-two-time-founder-says.html\">takes patience</a>. It takes smart, repeated action,\" Sethi wrote.</p><p>You may have to try a few different side hustles before you find the one that's lucrative and enjoyable to you. <a href=\"https://smarter.cnbcmakeit.com/p/how-to-start-a-business-for-first-time-founders?utm_source=cnbc&utm_medium=cnbclander&utm_campaign=smartercourse\" target=\"_blank\">Building your own business</a> may take some trial and error to figure out how to best market yourself or your product. You may even have to <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2025/07/25/39-year-old-dermatologist-spent-180000-to-get-licensed-nationwide-and-made-870000-last-year.html\">invest a decent amount of money</a> in order to get the returns you're looking for. But all of these plans take time and concerted effort.</p><p>\"Once you let go of the fantasy that it should be easy, you can finally start doing what actually works,\" Sethi added. \"And you'll be amazed at how fast things move once you stop waiting for it to feel effortless.\"</p></div><h2><a></a>3. You can start later</h2><div><p>Sometimes life gets in the way of you making progress toward your goals. You finally see progress on your savings journey then get hit with a <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2022/12/23/how-to-build-an-emergenc\">necessary car repair</a> or medical bill. You're finally ready to buy a house but mortgage rates tick up and suddenly it's unaffordable. </p><p>These roadblocks may be out of your control — and highlight the importance of prioritizing a well-funded <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2025/09/15/american-emergency-funds-shrinking.html\">emergency savings account</a> — but others aren't. Telling yourself you'll start that business or start investing \"once work slows down\" or \"when the kids are out of the house\" or \"in the new year,\" can actually be a non-starter, Sethi says. </p><p>Putting off your goals until \"'Later' is how entire decades disappear,\" he wrote.</p><p>This belief can trick you into thinking you're making progress because you're not saying \"never,\" you're just saying \"not now.\" And that procrastination can end up killing your dreams.</p><p>\"The timing will never be perfect. Life won't get magically simpler. The calendar won't suddenly free up three months for you to get your act together,\" Sethi wrote. </p><p>You need to take action. And that doesn't mean trying to build a six-figure business in a day, but it does mean <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2024/01/03/barbara-corcoran-2-step-strategy-for-organizing-and-achieving-goals.html\">making a plan</a>, breaking it down into manageable steps then working through them over time.</p><p>\"At some point, you stop 'waiting for the right time' and admit: you're either going to do this or you're not,\" Sethi said.</p><p><em><strong>Want to be your own boss?</strong> Sign up for Smarter by CNBC Make It's new online course, </em><a href=\"https://smarter.cnbcmakeit.com/p/how-to-start-a-business-for-first-time-founders?utm_source=cnbc&utm_medium=makeitarticle&utm_campaign=bottom\" target=\"_blank\"><em>How To Start A Business: For First-Time Founders</em></a><em>.

It's also important for women to get screened for the disease.</p><p>One common test for cervical cancer detection is a Pap smear, which doctors recommend once every three years for women between the ages of 21 and 65. Women ages 30 to 65 can also receive an HPV test and a Pap test every five years, or get tested for HPV alone every five years.</p><p>But, a recent report from the American Cancer Society shows that the <a href=\"https://www.cancer.org/research/acs-research-news/not-enough-females-are-being-screened-for-cervical-cancer.html\" target=\"_blank\">rate of cervical cancer screenings fell</a> during the Covid-19 pandemic, and haven't recovered.</p><p><a href=\"https://www.getteal.com/people/kara-egan\" target=\"_blank\">Kara Egan</a>, a health tech investor, saw a need for making Pap smears more accessible. She co-founded Teal Health, a healthcare company that created the <a href=\"https://www.getteal.com/teal-wand\" target=\"_blank\">Teal Wand</a>, the first FDA-approved cervical screening test that can be done at home.</p><p>\"What drove me to start Teal is just that women deserve better healthcare,\" says Egan, who is also the company's CEO.</p><p>\"And what does better look like? It looks like listening to a woman and seeing what she needs.\"</p></div><h2><a></a>'Even if the visit's free, you had to leave work, you had to get childcare'</h2><div><p>For Egan and her team, accessibility was a huge focus when creating the concept for the Teal Wand.</p><p>\"It's like, 'What are all of the touch points that we can do to make something easier for a woman, but to also build that trust with her, that she matters and that we care?\" Egan tells CNBC Make It.</p><p>\"I think a lot of them can be done in ways that you wouldn't expect or that healthcare doesn't do.\"</p><p>Before receiving a Teal Wand, customers must go through the screening process with a doctor who helps them determine their eligibility based on their insurance coverage, and teaches them how to properly use the wand to get an accurate sample.</p><p>\"We're doing the exact same test that's used in the doctor's office with the same accuracy, that's what our clinical trials show, but just you're collecting the sample at home,\" Egan explains.</p></div><div><p>The Teal Wand is the first FDA-approved cervical screening test that can be done at home.</p><p>Courtesy of Teal Health.</p></div><div><p>Once the sample is collected and tested, the results are shared via the company's online portal, and patients can connect to a medical provider<strong> </strong>via a tele-health visit to talk through next steps if a follow-up is needed.</p><p>What's unique about the process is that everything, from the screening process to the collection and receiving results is done from home. Egan says, that is by design, to make the process easier for people who struggle to get to in-person doctor's visits.</p><p>\"Cost is important, and it's critically important to us, [but] that's not the main barrier a lot of times for people,\" she says.</p><p>\"There's also the cost of going into the doctor's office. Even if the visit's free, you had to leave work, you had to get childcare, you had to [find] transportation.\"</p></div><h2><a></a>'Over 50% of women getting screened with Teal have been behind on their screening'</h2><div><p>The Teal Wand is now available in California, New York and Florida. Teal Health is in network with Cigna, Blue Cross Blue Shield, Aetna, Anthem Blue Cross and United Healthcare.</p><p>\"We're able to take [care of] the telehealth portion, and then a woman pays $99. But we are working with insurers to get the full thing covered,\" Egan says.</p><p>\"Even with a $99 charge, we're seeing over 50% of women who are getting screened with Teal have been behind on their screening, and 20% of them had never been screened before, and were well within screening age.\"</p><p>The driving factor for founding Teal Health for Egan and her team was to spread awareness of the importance of cervical cancer screening, and to offer a new option for testing, Egan notes.</p><p>\"Cervical cancer is entirely preventable if you get screened,\" she says. \"There are new ways to do it. One is in the office and one is at home, but they're highly accurate, and you should be doing it.\"</p><p><em><strong>Last chance to save: Want to be your own boss?</strong> Final days to get 30% off Smarter by CNBC Make It's new online course, </em><a href=\"https://smarter.cnbcmakeit.com/p/how-to-start-a-business-for-first-time-founders?utm_source=cnbc&utm_medium=makeitarticle&utm_campaign=bottom\" target=\"_blank\"><em>How To Start A Business: For First-Time Founders</em></a><em>.

Since 1994, the five-year survival rate of small businesses in the U.S. has hovered around just over 50%, per the <a href=\"https://www.bls.gov/spotlight/2024/business-employment-dynamics-twentieth-anniversary/?utm_source=chatgpt.com\" target=\"_blank\">Bureau of Labor Statistics</a>.

But even working on these companies began to feel \"soulless and hollow after a while,\" he added.</p><p>Entrepreneurship is often sold as something of a utopia — unshackled from the bureaucracy and politics of corporate life. But over the past few decades, founder life has also become synonymous with <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2024/09/24/this-29-year-old-millionaire-says-having-work-life-balance-is-a-myth.html\">hustle culture</a>.</p><p>Silicon Valley's startup scene mythologizes seven-day work weeks, while China's tech companies are infamous for the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2025/06/08/europe-startups-resists-pressure-to-adopt-chinas-996-work-culture.html\">996 culture</a> – working 9 a.m. to 9 p.m., six days a week.</p></div><div><p><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2025/07/08/vc-behind-996-work-culture-debate-defends-7-day-work-weeks-.html\"><img src=\"https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/108166954-1751461509661-2024_10_02HARRYSTEBBINGS7781_4.png?v=1751899126&w=160&h=90\" alt=\"Harry Stebbings, founder of 20VC, says billion-dollar firms aren't built on five-day work weeks.\" /></a></p></div><p>So how do founders — who are used to this all-encompassing and high-pressure life — bounce back from failure?</p><h2><a></a>'I lost a lot of my identity'</h2><div><p>Moving on from a failed business can require owning up to mistakes and disappointing people, including employees and investors.</p><p>Klaas Ardinois founded CommVision in 2024, a U.K.-based software development company that shut down a year later. He said the biggest emotional challenge of failing was disappointing investors who put money in the company, and laying off employees whose lives were upended.</p><p>Ardinois, who pins the failure on a market mismatch and being misled by a venture capital firm, said he had persuaded employees from a previous company to join CommVision.</p><p>\"Emotionally, it was really hard to get to that point of A: admitting that your business is failing. Then B: having to deal with the fallout of 'I'm about to upset people's lives quite dramatically,\" he said.</p><p>\"It's not like: 'Hey we could work something out.' It's: 'You've got four weeks, and I know you're financially stretched because you bought a house and you're about to have a baby,' so that was really hard.'\"</p><p>Meanwhile, Latvia-based Ainars Klavin founded augmented reality agency Overly in 2013, which nearly went bankrupt twice. But despite turning it around and making 1.5 million euro ($1.75 million) turnover in 2022, Klavins quit as a result of burnout.</p><p>He then gave startup life another chance and poured 500,000 euros into his next startup, which he left in 2024 as it was struggling.</p></div><blockquote><div><p>\"The biggest risk isn't failure, the biggest risk is success without clarity.\"</p><div><p>Ismael Dainehine</p><p>Co-founder of EverGive</p></div></div></blockquote><div><p>Now a lead product manager at proptech startup Giraffe360, Klavins told CNBC Make It that he experienced an identity crisis when transitioning from being a founder to a corporate employee.</p><p>\"When you exit through an unsuccessful business, you really start to question: what are you good at? Because at that point it seemed like I'm not good at anything,\" he said.</p><p>\"I have sacrificed so much to make this successful that I have lost a lot of my identity … It's very scary to lose your identity, because you have sacrificed a lot of other things that were part of your identity to make this one work, and if you lose it, you have nothing.\"</p></div><h2><a></a>Founders are the best employees</h2><div><p>Founders who return to corporate life as an employee may feel some shame or stigma attached to the transition, and employers could even discriminate against them.</p><p>A <a href=\"https://www.business.rutgers.edu/news/study-reveals-hiring-bias-against-former-business-owners\" target=\"_blank\">2024 study</a>, led by Rutgers Business School, sent fake resumes to 219 people with corporate recruiting experience. The fictional applications had identical qualifications, but some were former business owners.</p><p>It found that recruiters were less likely to recommend former business owners for a role, in what's described as an \"entrepreneurship penalty\" in the study. Recruiters appeared to be more hesitant to hire someone who is used to being their own boss and working autonomously.</p><p>However, public relations specialist Alain Rapallo said that founders can actually make the best employees.</p><p>Rapallo left his corporate role as a PR director to start his own agency in 2021, but returned to employee life just three years later.</p><p>Entrepreneurship is an advantage, he said, \"because when you are a founder and you work by yourself, if you make it past that first year, you pretty much did every role that any company does on a smaller scale, but you pretty much did it.\"</p><p>Rapallo said running a business also sharpens skills like multitasking and time management.</p><p>\"Startups are scrappy, but you [as an employee] don't necessarily do every single job. You don't have the mentality of growing the business. You usually just have the mentality of taking care of the client or the account,\" he added.</p><p>Product manager Klavins agreed that his understanding of numerous business functions was what got him his current role.</p><p>Being an employee has also been an important lesson in humility, he said, as it eliminated his ego and allowed him to start fresh.</p></div><h2><a></a>Reframing success and failure</h2><div><p>Serial entrepreneur Dainehine said it was important to redefine what success and failure meant to him in order to move forward.</p><p>\"The biggest risk isn't failure, the biggest risk is success without clarity,\" he explained, saying that without a clear set of principles, success will always be elusive.</p><p>\"The biggest advice I've had for entrepreneurs in that stage is to develop or commit to something that has a very deep sense of purpose and mission to you. A weak or opportunistic mission can't carry you through the hardest days,\" he said.</p><p>\"Once I focused on a mission I actually believed in, the same setbacks became survivable. So, if they can either pivot into something that adheres to that or find that within their current companies, I think that will build up their resilience to power through and reframe failure.\"</p></div></div>"

    "body": "<div><div><p>Utah-based drink chain Swig coined \"dirty soda\" back in 2010. Fifteen years later, the trend is fueling innovation everywhere from <span><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/PEP/\">PepsiCo</a><span><span></span></span></span> to <span><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/MCD/\">McDonald's</a><span><span></span></span></span>, infusing the sluggish beverage category with new life.</p><p>\"Dirty soda\" drinks use pop as a base, followed by flavored syrups, cream or other ingredients. While Swig claims credit — and the trademark — for dirty soda, TikTok videos and the reality TV show \"The Secret Lives of Mormon Wives\" have helped the trend spread far and wide, outpacing even the soda chain's speedy expansion.</p><p>Now, consumers can find it nearly everywhere, from grocery store aisles to fast-food chains.</p><p>In a few weeks, Pepsi plans to unveil two ready-to-drink dirty soda-inspired beverages at the National Association of Convenience Stores trade show in Chicago. The new drinks, the Dirty Dew and the Mug Floats Vanilla Howler, follow on the heels of the Pepsi Wild Cherry & Cream flavor, which hit shelves earlier this year.</p><p>\"I think it's a great opportunity for people like us, like PepsiCo, and for consumers to experience soda in a new way — and in some ways, an old way,\" Pepsi Beverages North America Chief Marketing Officer Mark Kirkham told CNBC, comparing the rise of dirty soda to root beer floats and the soda shops of yore.</p></div><div><p>PepsiCo's lineup of dirty soda-inspired drinks includes Pepsi Wild Cherry & Cream, Dirty Mountain Dew and Mug Floats Vanilla Howler.</p><p>Source: PepsiCo</p></div><div><p>Dirty soda has also drawn new interest beyond beverage players. According to Datassential, 2.7% of U.S. eateries offer a carbonated soft drink that includes cream or milk, up from 1.5% a decade ago.</p><p>Newcomers to the trend include TGI Fridays, which launched dirty soda as a limited-time menu item this summer that could be spiked with alcohol. McDonald's is <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2025/07/24/mcdonalds-tests-cosmcs-drinks.html\">testing flavored sodas</a>, like a \"Sprite Lunar Splash,\" at more than 500 locations after winding down its drinks-focused spinoff CosMc's in June. <span><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/YUM/\">Yum Brands'</a><span><span></span></span></span> Taco Bell has also been offering limited-time menu items, like a dirty Mountain Dew Baja Blast.</p></div><h2><a></a>Swig sets a trend</h2><div><p>These days, Swig has grown to more than 140 locations across 16 states. So far this year, its same-store sales have risen 8.2%, according to the privately held company. The Larry H. Miller Company, an investment firm founded by the former Utah Jazz owner, bought a majority stake in Swig in 2022 for an undisclosed sum.</p><p>\"I think we're doing for soda what Starbucks did for coffee,\" Swig CEO Alex Dunn said.</p><p>As Swig has grown, so have the number of chains looking to emulate its success. Rival soda shops like Sodalicious, Fiiz and Cool Sips are also benefiting from the trend. Coffee shops, like <span><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/BROS/\">Dutch Bros.</a><span><span></span></span></span>, have also added it to their menus. And now fast-food chains are hopping on the bandwagon.</p><p>\"It validates that this is a category, and McDonald's and Taco Bell wouldn't be getting into it if it wasn't something that had broad appeal that they could sell everywhere, in thousands of locations,\" Dunn said. \"It's kind of flattering that we created a category that now everybody is copying.\"</p><p>For restaurants, adding dirty soda to the menu is easier than it might sound.</p><p>\"It's a custom drink offering that, one, allows the brands to leverage something that they already have right there: their soda machine,\" said Erica Holland-Toll, culinary director at The Culinary Edge, which advises restaurants on food and beverage innovation. \"Two, it incorporates either a one-touch ingredient, or if they're already open for breakfast, it's quite likely that they've got a creamer in house.\"</p><p>On the other hand, offering customizable coffee drinks is usually much more difficult — which has contributed to the struggles at Starbucks.</p><p>\"The espresso world — that's so much more complicated,\" Holland-Toll said.</p><p>Dirty soda also has wide appeal. With less caffeine than coffee, consumers can drink it all day long. Plus, it's \"much more accessible\" than some coffee house trends, like an espresso tonic, according to Holland-Toll. The bright colors of many dirty sodas also make them more attractive to consumers, who were likely introduced to the trend via a TikTok video.</p><p>But perhaps above all, dirty soda can help restaurants draw in customers who are otherwise feeling thrifty.</p><p>\"It's an affordable fun treat. You're not going out and spending $30 or $50, right?\" said Sally Lyons Watt, chief advisor of consumer goods and foodservice insights for Circana. \"It's something that people can walk away saying, 'Wow, that was yummy' or 'I feel better because I just had that.'\"</p></div><h2><a></a>A pop for beverage companies</h2><div><p>Swig drinks.</p><p>Courtesy: Swig</p></div><div><p>A \"fun treat\" for consumers is adding up for beverage companies, helping reverse the decades-long trend of declining soda consumption in the U.S.</p><p>As health concerns mount and the array of beverage options expands, Americans have been drinking less soda for roughly two decades. In 2004, soda consumption peaked at 15.3 billion gallons, according to Beverage Marketing; by 2024, that figure had slid to 11.87 billion gallons. But consumption of carbonated soft drinks has been ticking up in the last two years, with 2025 estimated to reach 11.88 billion gallons. The rise of dirty soda, plus the growing popularity of prebiotic sodas, has likely helped the segment halt its downward trajectory.</p></div><div><p>Over the years, iced coffee has been stealing what the beverage industry calls \"share of throat\" from soda. With dirty soda, consumers can marry their love of customizing a cold drink with the lower caffeine content and taste of soda.</p><p>\"The carbonation makes it feel lighter in your mouth than coffee, for example,\" Holland-Toll said.</p><p>Dirty soda has also been attracting younger consumers who previously didn't drink much Pepsi or Dr Pepper. Swig's core customer base is young women between the ages of 18 and 35, according to Dunn.</p><p>That's true for Holly Galvin, a 31-year-old human resources professional based in Davenport, Iowa. She told CNBC that she rarely drank soda — until she saw dirty soda take the spotlight in the \"The Secret Lives of Mormon Wives\" last year. Now she makes her own dirty soda once or twice a week at home. With the onset of autumn, her go-to recipe these days uses Diet Dr Pepper as a base, with pumpkin spice creamer and a sprinkle of pumpkin pie spice on top.</p><p>Broadly, younger consumers are more inclined to seek out new drinks compared with older cohorts. Nearly three-quarters of Generation Z try a new beverage every month on average, according to Keurig Dr Pepper's 2025 trend report.</p><p>Beverage companies say that they are seeing a broader halo effect for soda as a result of the trend.</p><p>\"For us, it serves as a recruitment tool, bringing new users into the trademark,\" said Katie Webb, vice president of innovation and transformation for <span><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/KDP/\">Keurig Dr Pepper</a><span><span></span></span></span>. \"It really draws them all the way back to the base brand, which ends up being extremely impact for us long after.\"</p><p>And just as craft cocktail culture led to the rise of canned cocktails, the popularity of dirty soda is leading beverage giants to cash in with ready-to-drink versions that capitalize on the trend. Dr Pepper Creamy Coconut was the company's most successful limited-time carbonated soft drink to date, based on retail dollar sales, according to Webb. And Kirkham said Pepsi Wild Cherry & Cream has been one of the fastest-growing flavor segments for the company.</p><p>\"Some trends start retail and move over to foodservice,\" Circana's Lyons Wyatt said. \"This one was a foodservice trend moving into retail.\"</p><p>With Pepsi Wild Cherry & Cream and next year's launch of Dirty Dew and the Mug Floats Vanilla Howler, Kirkham expects that consumers will become even more creative with their concoctions.</p><p>\"I think it's actually giving [consumers] the chance to experiment even more and customize more,\" he said. \"Now you have a brand new base.\"</p></div></div>"

    "body": "<div><div><p>Work conflicts can be uncomfortable, but managing them effectively is essential to your success, says workplace expert Henna Pryor.</p><p>Whether you're asking your boss for a raise or receiving difficult feedback from a colleague, try memorizing a handful of go-to phrases, so you feel more prepared and at ease — no matter what awkward situation or conflict is thrown at you, says Pryor, the founder and CEO of Philadelphia-based leadership coaching firm Pryority Group.</p><p>If you can navigate conflict well, your colleagues will see you as someone who stays calm under pressure, holds themselves accountable and can help solve problems, Pryor adds. The more people want to work with you and seek out your opinion, the more influential you become.</p><p>CNBC Make It surveyed a group of five communication experts, including Pryor, who shared their favorite phrases to use in three types of workplace conflicts:</p><h3>When you need to initiate a difficult conversation</h3><p>Approaching a peer or manager about a problem can feel daunting, Pryor says. If you have to initiate a potentially tricky conversation with a coworker, try using phrases that let the other person know you're on the same problem-solving team.</p><ul><li><strong>\"I'm head-to-toe uncomfortable, but I feel it's important I bring up...\" </strong>Acknowledging awkwardness with levity at the start of a conversation emphasizes to the other person that there's an issue you need to solve together, and it's \"more important than our collective comfort,\" Pryor says.</li></ul><ul><li><strong>\"I'm seeking clarity.\" </strong>A lot of conflict can arise from miscommunication. Asking for clarity when something feels ambiguous can help you both feel less defensive, and set you on a calmer path to align your goals, Pryor says.</li></ul><ul><li><strong>\"I'm feeling anxious.\"</strong> If you know there's a difficult conversation heading your way, you can ask to practice with someone you trust, says <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/phoebe-gavin/\">Phoebe Gavin</a>, a Washington D.C.-based career and leadership coach. Then, ask if they're open to providing feedback. \"Anxiety is a [totally] normal emotion and a sign of investment,\" she explains. \"Saying it out loud can humanize you and get you helpful support.\"</li></ul><h3>When someone approaches you with a problem</h3><p>If a peer or boss approaches you about an issue, first try asking some questions to understand the main obstacle, before trying to solve the large problem, suggests <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/matt-abrahams/\">Matt Abrahams</a>, a Stanford University organizational behavior lecturer.</p><ul><li><strong>\"What does success look like?\" </strong>Abrahams says that he asks this question so he can better understand the other person's goals. That way, he can offer guidance that aligns with their objectives.</li></ul><ul><li><strong>\"In the past, how have you handled situations like this?\" </strong>Once Abrahams has a firm understanding of the problem, he tries to encourage the other person to relate it back to their own experience. \"[These questions] get people away from personality challenges … and focuses on the collaboration around a common goal,\" he says.</li></ul><ul><li><strong>\"I'd love to talk about this later. Is that OK?\"</strong> Use this phrase if the other person is emotional, or if you're too busy in the moment to devote your full attention, says <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2025/07/26/harvard-expert-easy-way-to-be-more-influential-in-everyday-conversations.html\">Alison Wood Brooks</a>, an associate professor at Harvard University who studies negotiation and conversational skills. Once you've had some time to prepare, find a neutral, private place to discuss further. \"It's extremely difficult to make conversational progress when tempers are flaring,\" Wood Brooks says. It never hurts to take a few minutes or even a few days to cool down and circle back.</li></ul><h3>When you need to keep your cool during a disagreement</h3><p>If you notice emotions are high in the middle of a workplace argument, you can redirect the conversation by deploying phrases to make the other person laugh or feel heard.</p><ul><li><strong>\"I want to make sure I understand.\" </strong>The most important thing to remember in the face of conflict is to initially, and then repeatedly, validate the other person's feelings and perspectives, multiple experts say.</li></ul><ul><li><strong>\"It sounds like what's most important to you in this situation is...\"</strong> Gavin likes to paraphrase the most central point in the other person's argument, so she can demonstrate that she's listening, she says.</li></ul><ul><li><strong>\"It makes sense that you feel that way.\" </strong>Use this phrase if the person you're speaking with seems especially vulnerable or upset. Lead with empathy, Wood Brooks says.</li></ul><ul><li><strong>\"How dare you!\"</strong> If the tone of the conversation is generally light-hearted, you can also respond with playfulness, Wood Brooks adds. \"I like to say this when someone raises a spicy or controversial point — but you have to deliver it dripping with obvious, over-the-top sarcasm,\" she says. \"If done well, it will always get a laugh, which immediately helps cut [tension]. It's a jovial way of saying, 'I love what you've said. It took courage. Let's address this together.'\"</li></ul><ul><li><strong>'\"From my perspective...\"</strong> Encouraging your conversation partner to see your perspective can lower the temperature of the conversation — but you should keep the tone curious and open to collaboration, says <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/lorraine-k-lee/\">Lorraine K. Lee</a>, author of \"<a href=\"https://lorraineklee.com/unforgettable-presence/\" target=\"_blank\">Unforgettable Presence: Get Seen, Gain Influence, and Catapult Your Career</a>.\" Regardless of the conflict, she adds, you should still be respectful and honest with the other person about how you're feeling.</li></ul><p>Most workplace conflicts, Gavin says, \"stem from mismatched expectations, priorities or incentives.\" When you are able to effectively talk about them, and bring those misalignments to the surface, \"you can resolve them and unblock progress.\"</p><p><em><strong>Want to stand out, grow your network, and get more job opportunities?</strong> Sign up for Smarter by CNBC Make It's new online course, </em><a href=\"https://smarter.cnbcmakeit.com/p/how-to-build-a-personal-brand?utm_source=cnbc&utm_medium=makeitarticle&utm_campaign=bottom\" target=\"_blank\"><em>How to Build a Standout Personal Brand: Online, In Person, and At Work</em></a><em>.

    "body": "<div><div><p>You may be familiar with the \"fight, flight, or <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2025/06/14/10-signs-youre-in-a-functional-freezeand-the-no-1-way-out-of-it.html\">freeze</a>\" survival responses. </p><p>But there's another \"F\" word:<a href=\"https://pete-walker.com/fourFs_TraumaTypologyComplexPTSD.htm\" target=\"_blank\"> the fawn response</a>, which is perhaps less recognized, but is the one I most commonly see as a psychotherapist, and one that I have experienced in my own life. </p><p>Fawning is about appeasing a threat, either real or perceived, and satisfying it. When we're in a fawn response, we move toward the threat instead of away from it. This people pleasing behavior can make you feel <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2025/03/14/if-you-answer-yes-to-these-questions-you-may-come-across-as-insecure.html\">insecure</a> when you have absolutely no reason to be.</p><p>Here's how to look out for the fawn response, and how to handle it. </p></div><h2><a></a>Where the fawn response comes from</h2><div><p>While there are many circumstances that feed the need to fawn, the thread is the same: \"I can't feel safe until everyone is happy with me.\"</p><p>When the body detects some sort of threat, whether it is real (a lion chasing you) or perceived (your boss being a little standoffish), it can feel the same to the nervous system. </p><p>Maybe you grew up in a home where you had to hold your breath and monitor a parent's moods because things could flip in an instant. Or maybe you had a highly critical parent, and being \"perfect\" was your way of staying ahead of criticism. I can certainly relate. </p><p>A prime example of the fawn response is the instinct you might have to ask someone, \"Are you mad at me?\" </p><p><em><strong>DON'T MISS</strong></em><a href=\"https://smarter.cnbcmakeit.com/p/how-to-start-a-business-for-first-time-founders?utm_source=cnbc&utm_medium=makeitarticle&utm_campaign=body\" target=\"_blank\"><em><strong>:</strong> <strong>The ultimate guide to starting a business—everything you need to know to be your own boss</strong></em></a> </p></div><h2><a></a>What the fawn response actually looks like</h2><div><p>To be clear, fawning isn't a bad thing. It's an automatic survival mechanism, and sometimes we need to fawn, whether it's to get a paycheck or to ensure immediate safety. </p><p>But in order to hyper-attune to other people's moods, reactions, and perceptions, we often disconnect from and neglect ourselves. Here are some common fawn response behaviors to watch out for:</p><ul><li>Constantly overthinking social interactions.</li><li>Not being able to say no or set boundaries, and then feeling resentful.</li><li>Feeling terrified of conflict or of people thinking you disagree with them.</li><li>Morphing yourself into a \"chameleon\" in relationships.</li><li>Fearing that you're about to get in trouble.</li><li>Being drawn to people who are emotionally unavailable, critical, or hard to please, because they feel like \"home.\"</li><li>Feeling like you don't know who you are anymore because you've silenced your own opinions.</li></ul><p>All of this adds up to seeming and feeling insecure. If these patterns resonate, I imagine that at some point they were genuinely helpful and protective. So the body thinks: <em>Hey, this works, let's keep doing it.</em> What feels familiar will always feel safe, even if it no longer serves us. </p></div><h2><a></a>How to break out of a fawn response cycle </h2><div><p>The fawn response is an unconscious pattern, so noticing it and bringing it into the forefront of your mind is the first step. Here are a few practices I like to recommend to my patients. </p><ol><li><strong>Pause. </strong>Before you go to over-apologize, shrink yourself, shove your needs down, get lost in an overthinking spiral — pause. Check in with yourself. Ask \"What do I need right now? What do I think of this? What am I feeling?\" It's great to care about others, but not if you abandon your needs in the process.</li><li><strong>Lean back. </strong>Let's say your parent sends you a text while you're in the middle of something, and your immediate instinct is to respond so you won't disappoint them. Instead, finish what you were doing and respond when you're free. This is all about releasing urgency where it's not necessary or helpful. By slowing down, we're communicating to our bodies that we're safe.</li><li><strong>Look inward. </strong>Practice expressing your needs in relationships that feel safest to you, in everyday ways. For example, when your partner asks what you want for dinner, instead of saying, \"Whatever you want!\" take a moment to ask yourself: \"What do I actually want?\" Can you allow yourself to express it? And then don't be afraid to do so. </li></ol><p>When we've been conditioned to believe that we aren't allowed to have needs, that we're responsible for managing other people's emotions, boundaries may be hard for us to set. Many of us may fear that if we set boundaries, we'll be seen as cold or mean. But I like to think of boundaries as a way to strengthen the relationships we really want in our lives. </p><p><a href=\"https://megjosephson.com/\" target=\"_blank\"><em><strong>Meg Josephson</strong></em></a><em> is a licensed psychotherapist and the author of the bestselling book, </em><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Are-You-Mad-Me-Focusing-ebook/dp/B0DQLMS9VG\" target=\"_blank\"><em>\"Are You Mad at Me?: How to Stop Focusing on What Others Think So You Can Start Living for You</em></a><em>.\"</em></p><p><em><strong>Last chance to save: Want to be your own boss?</strong> Final days to get 30% off Smarter by CNBC Make It's new online course, </em><a href=\"https://smarter.cnbcmakeit.com/p/how-to-start-a-business-for-first-time-founders?utm_source=cnbc&utm_medium=makeitarticle&utm_campaign=bottom\" target=\"_blank\"><em>How To Start A Business: For First-Time Founders</em></a><em>.

The company operates entirely within the United States, with assets including printed and digital billboards, transit displays, including airports, street furniture and wallscapes and other spectaculars. </p><p><strong>Stock Market Value</strong>: $755.45 million ($1.52 per share) </p></div><div><h3>Activist: Anson Funds</h3><p><strong>Ownership: </strong>3.65% </p><p><strong>Average Cost: </strong>n/a<strong> </strong></p><p><strong>Activist Commentary: </strong>Anson Funds is a multistrategy fund founded in 2007 by Moez Kassam and has over $2 billion in assets. While not historically activists, on Oct. 3, 2023, Anson hired Sagar Gupta, former senior analyst and head of TMT investing at Legion Partners, to build out their activism strategy. </p><h3>What's happening</h3><p>On Sept. 22, Anson Funds announced that they are calling for a sale of Clear Channel Outdoor Holdings. </p><h3>Behind the scenes</h3><p>Clear Channel Outdoor is one of the largest out-of-home advertising companies that offers a variety of advertising services, including through billboards, street furniture displays, transit displays, and airport displays. In the U.S., they are one of the three big companies in this sector, with <span><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/LAMR/\">Lamar Advertising</a><span><span></span></span></span> and <span><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/OUT/\">Outfront Media</a><span><span></span></span></span> numbers one and two, respectively.</p><p>Historically, the challenges for CCO have centered around the company's two business lines – Americas and Europe, each with very different business models and valuations. The European business worked on fixed limited-term contracts with municipalities, which were re-bided at maturity. Because of this, the European business traded around 8x EBITDA multiple, while the U.S., largely comprised of owned billboards, traded closer 13 – 15x EBITDA.</p><p>These problems prompted Legion Partners to launch an activist campaign at CCO in May 2023, urging the company to consider a broad strategic review process, including divesting non-U.S. assets or a sale of the entire company. Legion also highlighted CCO's potential value proposition through its transition to digital billboards, which would allow each billboard to generate about four times more revenue and six to 10 times more EBITDA. Ultimately, they settled for a board seat for Legion co-founder Ted White, who still serves as a director today. Since then, CCO has executed a series of divestures, including selling its European business to Bauer Media Group, its Latin America business to Global Vía Públic, and, just two weeks ago, its Spain business to Atresmedia. These moves have transformed CCO into a U.S. pureplay and allowed it to start paying down its debt. However, despite this successful activist catalyst, CCO is yet to achieve the rerating some expected - currently, CCO trades at approximately 13-14 times EBITDA, versus peers Lamar and Outfront at 16-18 times. As a result, the stock is down 26.56% since Legion filed its 13D and over 90% from its IPO price.</p><p>On Sept. 22, Anson Funds joined the party, announcing that they are calling for a sale of the company. While this is a new campaign for Anson, this is not the beginning of their investment story. Sagar Gupta, who runs Anson's activism strategy, was at Legion Partners when they launched their campaign, and, perhaps not coincidentally, CCO has appeared in Anson's 13F holdings every quarter since Gupta joined the fund, now with a 3.65% position as of their most recent filing. So, Anson's call for a sale of the company is not a short-term, opportunistic campaign, but a decision made after years of analysis and working amicably with the company and at a time when it has become most feasible.</p><p>The company is now a U.S. pureplay, making it more focused and more valuable from a multiple perspective and easier to acquire from a regulatory perspective. Possible acquirers include <span><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/DEC-FR/\">JCDecaux</a><span><span></span></span></span> and Lamar.</p><p>In fact, JCDecaux terminated an agreement to buy CCO's Spain assets after facing restrictive demands from Spanish regulators. More specifically, JCDecaux maintains major exposure in virtually every OOH market outside the U.S. and has been rumored to be interested in the company.</p><p>As for Lamar, it has a history of acquiring CCO's assets, including a $458.5 million transaction in 2016, and has publicly expressed potential interest in additional transactions. In addition, <span><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/BX/\">Blackstone</a><span><span></span></span></span>'s recent acquisition of New Tradition at 18x EBITDA, <span><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/BRK.B/\">Berkshire Hathaway</a><span><span></span></span></span>'s new position in Lamar, and Ares Management's 8% position in CCO, all underscore the private equity appetite for the OOH industry. </p><p>Before coming to a decision like this, it is important to see what the standalone alternative looks like and why a sale may be more compelling for shareholders. To really properly restructure this business in the public market it would certainly require the time and risk of reconstituting the board and likely many management changes. Even with that, the company would still carry approximately $5 billion of long-term debt making it difficult to attract capital.</p><p>Additionally, CCO's promising digital transformation has been very slow. Since Legion's campaign, digital billboards have only grown to 5% of the portfolio, though they already count for over a third of CCO's revenue. While this underscores the huge value opportunity with digital conversion, it requires approvals of individual municipalities, significantly slowing the speed at which CCO can roll out digital ads, and not ideal for a public company that reports quarterly progress. As a result, after years of analysis and support, Anson has concluded that a sale offers the best risk adjusted path forward, a position we imagine Legion and other shareholders likely share.</p><p><em>Ken Squire is the founder and president of 13D Monitor, an institutional research service on shareholder activism, and the founder and portfolio manager of the 13D Activist Fund, a mutual fund that invests in a portfolio of activist 13D investments.</em></p></div>"

Disney had temporarily <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2025/09/17/charlie-kirk-jimmy-kimmel-abc-disney.html\">suspended</a> the late night show following comments Kimmel made about the alleged murder of conservative activist Charlie Kirk and President Donald Trump's MAGA movement.</p><p>\"Our objective throughout this process has been to ensure that programming remains accurate and engaging for the widest possible audience. We take seriously our responsibility as local broadcasters to provide programming that serves the interests of our communities, while also honoring our obligations to air national network programming,\" Sinclair said in a statement on Friday.</p><p>\"Over the last week, we have received thoughtful feedback from viewers, advertisers, and community leaders representing a wide range of perspectives,\" Sinclair said. \"We have also witnessed troubling acts of violence, including the despicable incident of a shooting at an ABC affiliate station in Sacramento. These events underscore why responsible broadcasting matters and why respectful dialogue between differing voices remains so important.\"</p><p>The broadcast station owners said earlier this week they would continue to <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2025/09/23/kimmel-abc-nexstar-sinclair-fcc.html\">preempt</a> Kimmel's late night show, meaning it would be unavailable on local stations for roughly 20% of the country, while they <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2025/09/24/jimmy-kimmel-live-nexstar-show-status-abc-stations.html\">evaluated</a> the situation and continued discussions with Disney.</p><p>Sinclair owns roughly 40 ABC affiliate stations in the U.S., including one in in Washington, D.C. Nexstar owns about 30 in markets including Salt Lake City and New Orleans.</p><p>Kimmel <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2025/09/23/jimmy-kimmel-returns-abc-disney-kirk.html\">addressed</a> the situation — and the ongoing preemptions — during his returning show this week.</p><p>\"We are still on the air in most of the country, except, ironically, from Washington, D.C., where we have been preempted,\" Kimmel said during Tuesday's monologue. \"After almost 23 years on the air, we're suddenly not being broadcast in 20% of the country, which is not a situation we relish.\"</p><p>Sinclair said Friday it had proposed measures to \"strengthen accountability, viewer feedback, and community dialogue\" at ABC and its affiliates.</p><p>\"While ABC and Disney have not yet adopted these measures, and Sinclair respects their right to make those decisions under our network affiliate agreements, we believe such measures could strengthen trust and accountability,\" it said.</p><p>Nexstar said in a statement: \"We have had discussions with executives at The Walt Disney Company and appreciate their constructive approach to addressing our concerns.\"</p><p>Disney declined to comment Friday.</p><p>Kimmel's suspension last week came shortly after Nexstar announced it would not air the program in light of the host's comments. Sinclair soon after said it would likewise preempt the program.</p><p>Those announcements followed comments from Federal Communications Commission Chairman Brendan Carr that <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2025/09/18/jimmy-kimmel-charlie-kirk-fcc-carr.html\">suggested</a> ABC affiliate stations could be at <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2025/09/19/trump-threatening-broadcast-station-licenses-explained.html\">risk of losing</a> broadcast station licenses over Kimmel's remarks, which came during a show monologue.</p><p>The series of events raised questions about influence by the Trump administration on the media and First Amendment protections.</p><p>\"Our decision to preempt this program was independent of any government interaction or influence,\" Sinclair said Friday. \"Free speech provides broadcasters with the right to exercise judgment as to the content on their local stations. While we understand that not everyone will agree with our decisions about programming, it is simply inconsistent to champion free speech while demanding that broadcasters air specific content.\"</p><p>Earlier this week, Sen. Maria Cantwell, D-Wash., <a href=\"https://www.cantwell.senate.gov/news/press-releases/cantwell-calls-on-sinclair-broadcasting-to-quit-blocking-publics-ability-to-watch-jimmy-kimmel-live\" target=\"_blank\">sent a letter</a> to Sinclair pushing to bring \"Jimmy Kimmel Live!\" back on air. Sinclair owns the Seattle ABC affiliate station.</p><p>Nexstar similarly denied any government influence. </p><p>\"As a local broadcaster, Nexstar remains committed to protecting the First Amendment while producing and airing local and national news that is fact-based and unbiased and, above all, broadcasting content that is in the best interest of the communities we serve,\" Nexstar said in a statement. </p><p>\"We stand apart from cable television, monolithic streaming services, and national networks in our commitment – and obligation – to be stewards of the public airwaves and to protect and reflect the specific sensibilities of our communities,\" the statement continued. \"To be clear, our commitment to those principles has guided our decisions throughout this process, independent of any external influence from government agencies or individuals.\"</p></div>"
