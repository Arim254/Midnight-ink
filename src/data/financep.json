    "body": "<div><p><span>A new system developed by Cornell Tech researchers helps users detect when their online accounts have been compromised — without exposing their personal devices to invasive tracking by web services.</span></p><p><span>The researchers presented the system, called Client-Side Encrypted Access Logging (CSAL), at the </span><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.usenix.org/conference/usenixsecurity25/presentation/ortega-perez\"><span>USENIX Security Symposium</span></a><span> on Aug. 15 in Seattle. Its “privacy-first” method verifies whether a login came from a user’s own device, addressing a flaw in how major platforms like Google and Facebook currently log account access.</span></p><p><span>The new system could be especially useful for users at heightened risk of targeted cyberattacks, such as journalists, activists and public figures, who need to verify account activity, the researchers said. The study was motivated by the authors’ work with survivors of intimate partner violence at Cornell Tech’s </span><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://ceta.tech.cornell.edu/\"><span>Clinic to End Tech Abuse</span></a><span> (CETA); the safety of survivors often relies on knowing if and when their partners have been accessing their accounts.</span></p><p><span>The research was led by Carolina Ortega Pérez and Alaa Daffalla, both Ph.D. candidates in computer science, and </span><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://tech.cornell.edu/people/thomas-ristenpart/\"><span>Thomas Ristenpart</span></a><span>, professor at Cornell Tech and the Cornell Ann S. Bowers College of Computing and Information Science. The team found that existing access logs rely on client-side data – such as device identifiers and IP addresses — that attackers can easily spoof. Even after an account is compromised, the logs may misleadingly suggest that the login came from a familiar device.</span></p><p><span>“For at-risk users, an incident of account compromise could be life-threatening. Tools such as CSAL empower these users to diagnose illicit accesses to their online accounts, which is crucial for their safety,” said Daffalla.</span></p><p><span>CSAL offers a cryptographic alternative. Instead of sending service providers client-side data, the system encrypts it end-to-end using a key known only to the client devices. During login, the client device’s operating system generates a cryptographic token containing device identifiers, which is encrypted end-to-end and stored by the service provider, ensuring that only the user can later decrypt and verify the login’s origin.</span></p><p><span>This approach allows users to detect unauthorized access without revealing their identifying information to the platform they are using. It also avoids the need for platforms to collect and store detailed device fingerprints, which are often used for tracking, the team said.</span></p><p><span>The research shows how this system can be integrated into existing authentication workflows with minimal overhead. The system is also compatible with widely used security protocols, making it feasible for adoption by major platforms, the researchers said. By rethinking how access logs are generated and interpreted, the team said, CSAL offers a promising path forward for balancing security and privacy in digital account management.</span></p><p><span>The research was supported in part by a grant from the National Science Foundation and funding from Google.</span></p><p><em><span>Grace Stanley is a staff writer-editor for Cornell Tech.</span></em></p></div>"

rumored CR7 memecoin caused a frenzy before collapsing in a rugpull, showing how easily celebrity names are exploited in crypto scams.</em></p>\n<hr />\n<p><span>After a whirlwind of celebrity-backed <a href=\"https://ambcrypto.com/category/memecoins/\" target=\"_blank\">memecoins</a> in 2024, some skyrocketing in popularity while others collapsed into outright scams, the trend is showing no signs of slowing down in 2025. </span></p>\n<p><span>Big names continue to pour into the $4 trillion crypto market, with figures as prominent as U.S. President Donald Trump stepping into the space.</span></p>\n<h2>Is Cristiano Ronaldo’s memecoin being launched?</h2>\n<p><span>Now, the spotlight has shifted to Portuguese football icon Cristiano Ronaldo. </span></p>\n<p><span>Rumors of a Cristiano Ronaldo-themed memecoin, dubbed CR7, recently swept through the crypto community after multiple X (formerly Twitter) accounts began circulating alleged launch posts.</span></p>\n<div><p><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://ambcrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/sarah-milady.webp\"><img src=\"https://ambcrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/sarah-milady.webp\" alt=\"sarah milady on

https://ambcrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/sarah-milady-768x436.webp 768w\" /></a></p><p>Source: Sarah milady/X</p></div>\n<p><span>These posts, packed with flashy claims and bold predictions, suggested that the token could quickly rise to become one of the market’s largest memecoins.</span></p>\n<p><span>However, the frenzy was short-lived but dramatic. </span></p>\n<p><span>Within hours, the coin reportedly <a href=\"https://x.com/greybtc/status/1959886315324911945\" target=\"_blank\">surged</a> to a market cap of $140 million before collapsing just as fast. </span></p>\n<p><span>Crypto investor Loudspotter noted that promotional tweets briefly fueled a surge to nearly $100 million in market value in mere minutes.</span></p>\n<div><p><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://ambcrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Loudspotter.webp\"><img src=\"https://ambcrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Loudspotter.webp\" alt=\"Loudspotter\"

https://ambcrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Loudspotter-768x833.webp 768w\" /></a></p><p>Source: Loudspotter/X</p></div>\n<h2>Why is this sounding more like a scam?</h2>\n<p><span>Some of the posts were swiftly deleted, and the project unraveled into what many described as a classic rugpull.</span></p>\n<p><span>According to several community accounts, the scam unfolded on the <a href=\"https://ambcrypto.com/category/solana-news/\" target=\"_blank\">Solana [SOL]</a> blockchain, where influencers launched the token, drove up hype, and exited within 20 minutes, pocketing an estimated $50,000 across multiple wallets. </span></p>\n<p><span>The incident has now been <a href=\"https://x.com/Cryptowithkhan/status/1959696205946167680\" target=\"_blank\">dubbed</a> a “$100 million scam under Ronaldo’s name,” underscoring how quickly celebrity-linked narratives can be exploited in the memecoin space.</span></p>\n<p><span>Seeing this, legitimate efforts around football-related digital assets are also gaining traction.</span></p>\n<h2>What’s more?</h2>\n<p><span>Ezzak from Messari <a href=\"https://x.com/ItsEzak/status/1959396742677287176\" target=\"_blank\">released</a> a research note on Football.fun, a rising consumer app on Base.</span></p>\n<p><span> The analysis focused on the top 10 footballers available on the platform, many of whom are shortlisted for the 2025 Ballon d’Or, highlighting their current token prices, average buy levels, and weekly trading volumes. </span></p>\n<p><span>By surfacing these insights, the report aims to help collectors and investors identify potential value plays ahead of the prestigious award announcement, without having to comb through the data themselves.</span></p>\n<p><span>As of now, Cristiano Ronaldo and his team have made no announcements about a CR7 memecoin, with the rumor likely tied to his earlier NFT collaboration with Binance. </span></p>\n<p><span>This coincided with Kanye West’s YZY coin <a href=\"https://ambcrypto.com/kanye-wests-yzy-memecoin-hits-3-2-before-crashing-70-details/amp/\" target=\"_blank\">spiking</a> 1,400% to $3 billion just days ago, before crashing 70%. </span></p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t</div><div>\n\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<p><img alt=\"Avatar\"

    "body": "<article><p><a href=\"https://www.irishtimes.com/tags/tesla\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://www.irishtimes.com/tags/tesla\">Tesla</a> was valued at more than $1 trillion dollars when we checked last week, but it is very careful when watching the pennies if the experience of one of our readers is anything to go by. </p><p>Last April, John put in an order for a new Tesla Model Y but has been left aggravated by the company’s failure to honour what he believes is a firm commitment made by not one but two of its representatives to give him €500 back.</p><p>“When in the shop earlier that day, the sales assistant specified to me that because my mam is a Tesla owner, she could share a referral link with me which would save me €500 on my car order,” he writes. </p><p>“When I processed my order by paying the deposit of €250, it notified me that my referral was accepted. However, when my receipt was emailed to me with line item pricing, the €500 referral was never included in the receipt,” he says. </p><p>“Concerned, I then called Tesla (on a recorded line), where the agent clarified that ‘the €500 would be taken off my order once I proceeded to make my final payment which is when the app notifies me that a car has been assigned to me. “</p><p>Fast-forward to last month when the car was eventually assigned to him.</p><p>“Again, no sign of the €500 being deducted,” writes John. “I called Tesla and emailed them to voice my frustration on the shocking service.” </p><p>He also sent us the company’s long-winded response .</p><p>“We are writing to confirm receipt of your letter of complaint. We are sorry to learn of your experience surrounding referral credits when placing your new Model Y order. </p><p>“We are sorry if you feel the support fell short of your expectations and appreciate the time you took to share your concerns with us. Please be assured that we take all feedback seriously and have a team dedicated to reviewing and addressing each issue. Your feedback has been documented and shared with our management team, who will use it to drive improvements and provide additional training to our staff. Your input is crucial in helping us to identify areas for improvement, refine our processes, and deliver exceptional customer service.”</p><p>The response goes on.</p><p>“Please accept our apologies for any miscommunication received and for any disappointment or frustration this may have caused. Whilst we understand there may have been some confusion surrounding this incentive, we must also advise that the onus is on the customer, yourself, to carefully read and understand the terms and conditions of the program before using a referral link. </p><p>“Our referral credit program rewards both the referrer and the buyer with credits when a valid referral code is used at the time of purchase. However, our Refer and Earn terms and conditions detail the qualifying products, and excludes new Model Y purchases from this incentive. Although you were able to apply a referral code, it does not qualify you for buyer credits; only the referrer would receive credits in this case.</p><p>“We appreciate that the incentive may not have been clearly communicated by the sales team. Prior to the new Model Y launch, all Tesla products qualified for refer and earn credits, so we apologise for any confusion, disappointment, or frustration this may have caused. We have taken steps to address this internally and put measures in place to prevent it from happening again.</p><p>“Due to system constraints, we are unable to apply referral discounts or credits to products that don’t meet the specified requirements. However, as a gesture of goodwill and a sincere apology for the inconvenience you’ve experienced, we are pleased to hear that the Dublin store manager has offered you a €200 goodwill voucher. We appreciate your understanding that this is a final gesture, and we regret to inform you that we cannot apply the referral discount, offer any further compensation or make exceptions in this case.</p><p>“Once again we apologise for any disappointment and frustration this may have caused and appreciate your understanding. We recognise this is not likely to be the response you sought but must assure you we are responding to you in a way consistent to how we would support any equivalent customers and making an exception would be at the detriment to equivalent customers, which would be unfair under the circumstances.”</p><p>John was not happy with this response at all and says he bought the car “on the premise that I was informed twice that the referral would be accepted. However, I now find myself in a standoff with Tesla, [as I’m] refusing to pay the full amount and feel they’ll likely give the car to the next customer in line.” </p><p>We got in touch with Tesla and we have to say that while John might have been left miffed by the EV maker, at least he heard back from the company. At the time of writing we had had no response to our query. </p></article>"
