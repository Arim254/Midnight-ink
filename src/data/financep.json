    "body": "<div><div><p>Despite the prevalence of cervical cancer diagnoses and deaths in the United States, <a href=\"https://aacrjournals.org/cebp/article-abstract/34/6/836/762621/Prevalence-and-Review-of-Major-Modifiable-Cancer?redirectedFrom=fulltext\" target=\"_blank\">data</a> shows that screening for the cancer is on a consistent decline.</p><p>Each year in the U.S., around 4,000 women die from cervical cancer, and about 13,000 are diagnosed with the disease, according to the <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/cervical-cancer/statistics/index.html\" target=\"_blank\">Centers for Disease Control and Prevention</a>.</p><p>The most effective way to prevent cervical cancer is receiving the HPV vaccine, which offers protection against the HPV types that most frequently cause it, the <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/cervical-cancer/prevention/index.html\" target=\"_blank\">CDC states</a>. It's also important for women to get screened for the disease.</p><p>One common test for cervical cancer detection is a Pap smear, which doctors recommend once every three years for women between the ages of 21 and 65. Women ages 30 to 65 can also receive an HPV test and a Pap test every five years, or get tested for HPV alone every five years.</p><p>But, a recent report from the American Cancer Society shows that the <a href=\"https://www.cancer.org/research/acs-research-news/not-enough-females-are-being-screened-for-cervical-cancer.html\" target=\"_blank\">rate of cervical cancer screenings fell</a> during the Covid-19 pandemic, and haven't recovered.</p><p><a href=\"https://www.getteal.com/people/kara-egan\" target=\"_blank\">Kara Egan</a>, a health tech investor, saw a need for making Pap smears more accessible. She co-founded Teal Health, a healthcare company that created the <a href=\"https://www.getteal.com/teal-wand\" target=\"_blank\">Teal Wand</a>, the first FDA-approved cervical screening test that can be done at home.</p><p>\"What drove me to start Teal is just that women deserve better healthcare,\" says Egan, who is also the company's CEO.</p><p>\"And what does better look like? It looks like listening to a woman and seeing what she needs.\"</p></div><h2><a></a>'Even if the visit's free, you had to leave work, you had to get childcare'</h2><div><p>For Egan and her team, accessibility was a huge focus when creating the concept for the Teal Wand.</p><p>\"It's like, 'What are all of the touch points that we can do to make something easier for a woman, but to also build that trust with her, that she matters and that we care?\" Egan tells CNBC Make It.</p><p>\"I think a lot of them can be done in ways that you wouldn't expect or that healthcare doesn't do.\"</p><p>Before receiving a Teal Wand, customers must go through the screening process with a doctor who helps them determine their eligibility based on their insurance coverage, and teaches them how to properly use the wand to get an accurate sample.</p><p>\"We're doing the exact same test that's used in the doctor's office with the same accuracy, that's what our clinical trials show, but just you're collecting the sample at home,\" Egan explains.</p></div><div><p>The Teal Wand is the first FDA-approved cervical screening test that can be done at home.</p><p>Courtesy of Teal Health.</p></div><div><p>Once the sample is collected and tested, the results are shared via the company's online portal, and patients can connect to a medical provider<strong> </strong>via a tele-health visit to talk through next steps if a follow-up is needed.</p><p>What's unique about the process is that everything, from the screening process to the collection and receiving results is done from home. Egan says, that is by design, to make the process easier for people who struggle to get to in-person doctor's visits.</p><p>\"Cost is important, and it's critically important to us, [but] that's not the main barrier a lot of times for people,\" she says.</p><p>\"There's also the cost of going into the doctor's office. Even if the visit's free, you had to leave work, you had to get childcare, you had to [find] transportation.\"</p></div><h2><a></a>'Over 50% of women getting screened with Teal have been behind on their screening'</h2><div><p>The Teal Wand is now available in California, New York and Florida. Teal Health is in network with Cigna, Blue Cross Blue Shield, Aetna, Anthem Blue Cross and United Healthcare.</p><p>\"We're able to take [care of] the telehealth portion, and then a woman pays $99. But we are working with insurers to get the full thing covered,\" Egan says.</p><p>\"Even with a $99 charge, we're seeing over 50% of women who are getting screened with Teal have been behind on their screening, and 20% of them had never been screened before, and were well within screening age.\"</p><p>The driving factor for founding Teal Health for Egan and her team was to spread awareness of the importance of cervical cancer screening, and to offer a new option for testing, Egan notes.</p><p>\"Cervical cancer is entirely preventable if you get screened,\" she says. \"There are new ways to do it. One is in the office and one is at home, but they're highly accurate, and you should be doing it.\"</p><p><em><strong>Last chance to save: Want to be your own boss?</strong> Final days to get 30% off Smarter by CNBC Make It's new online course, </em><a href=\"https://smarter.cnbcmakeit.com/p/how-to-start-a-business-for-first-time-founders?utm_source=cnbc&utm_medium=makeitarticle&utm_campaign=bottom\" target=\"_blank\"><em>How To Start A Business: For First-Time Founders</em></a><em>.

Behind them is a depiction of the seal of the Federal Reserve.</p><p>The image appears to be \"AI-generated or digitally illustrated,\" according to visual analysis by ChatGPT.</p><p>Trump has repeatedly criticized Powell for his cautious approach to cutting interest rates, nicknaming him \"Too Late Powell.\" The latest threat came even as the central bank lowered rates earlier this month for the first time this year. Powell's term as chair ends in May 2026.</p><p>The White House didn't immediately respond to CNBC's request for comment.</p><p>Firing the top central banker would be unprecedented as no U.S. president ever has attempted to do so, though others have criticized prior Fed chairs. A recent <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2025/05/22/supreme-court-federal-reserve-trump.html\">Supreme Court decision</a> indicated that the president does not have the authority to remove Fed officials at will.  Powell has said repeatedly that his firing is \"not permitted under the law.\"</p><p>The Trump White House has blasted Powell over renovations to the Fed's Washington headquarters, raising suspicion that Trump could try to remove the Fed leader for cause. Although lately Trump has eased his criticisms of the Fed building, while continuing to be vocal about Powell hurting the economy by keeping rates too high in his view.</p><p>Trump attempted to fire Fed Governor Lisa Cook in August on alleged mortgage fraud. The Supreme Court is set to rule on that matter soon. The Department of Justice on Friday <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2025/09/26/trump-fed-cook-scotus-markets.html\">said</a> in a Supreme Court filing that firing Cook for alleged misconduct would not harm the financial markets. Cook's attorneys argued in a prior filing to the high court that her removal could ruin Fed independence.</p><p>So far, the financial markets have shown little reaction to Trump's Powell threats or Cook's attempted firing. Though many economists and investors believe firing Powell before his term ends could cause longer-term interest rates to rise on the notion the Fed would start to act in Trump's interests and not according to its dual mandate from Congress of stable inflation and low unemployment.</p></div></div>"

    "body": "<div><div><p>You may be familiar with the \"fight, flight, or <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2025/06/14/10-signs-youre-in-a-functional-freezeand-the-no-1-way-out-of-it.html\">freeze</a>\" survival responses. </p><p>But there's another \"F\" word:<a href=\"https://pete-walker.com/fourFs_TraumaTypologyComplexPTSD.htm\" target=\"_blank\"> the fawn response</a>, which is perhaps less recognized, but is the one I most commonly see as a psychotherapist, and one that I have experienced in my own life. </p><p>Fawning is about appeasing a threat, either real or perceived, and satisfying it. When we're in a fawn response, we move toward the threat instead of away from it. This people pleasing behavior can make you feel <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2025/03/14/if-you-answer-yes-to-these-questions-you-may-come-across-as-insecure.html\">insecure</a> when you have absolutely no reason to be.</p><p>Here's how to look out for the fawn response, and how to handle it. </p></div><h2><a></a>Where the fawn response comes from</h2><div><p>While there are many circumstances that feed the need to fawn, the thread is the same: \"I can't feel safe until everyone is happy with me.\"</p><p>When the body detects some sort of threat, whether it is real (a lion chasing you) or perceived (your boss being a little standoffish), it can feel the same to the nervous system. </p><p>Maybe you grew up in a home where you had to hold your breath and monitor a parent's moods because things could flip in an instant. Or maybe you had a highly critical parent, and being \"perfect\" was your way of staying ahead of criticism. I can certainly relate. </p><p>A prime example of the fawn response is the instinct you might have to ask someone, \"Are you mad at me?\" </p><p><em><strong>DON'T MISS</strong></em><a href=\"https://smarter.cnbcmakeit.com/p/how-to-start-a-business-for-first-time-founders?utm_source=cnbc&utm_medium=makeitarticle&utm_campaign=body\" target=\"_blank\"><em><strong>:</strong> <strong>The ultimate guide to starting a business—everything you need to know to be your own boss</strong></em></a> </p></div><h2><a></a>What the fawn response actually looks like</h2><div><p>To be clear, fawning isn't a bad thing. It's an automatic survival mechanism, and sometimes we need to fawn, whether it's to get a paycheck or to ensure immediate safety. </p><p>But in order to hyper-attune to other people's moods, reactions, and perceptions, we often disconnect from and neglect ourselves. Here are some common fawn response behaviors to watch out for:</p><ul><li>Constantly overthinking social interactions.</li><li>Not being able to say no or set boundaries, and then feeling resentful.</li><li>Feeling terrified of conflict or of people thinking you disagree with them.</li><li>Morphing yourself into a \"chameleon\" in relationships.</li><li>Fearing that you're about to get in trouble.</li><li>Being drawn to people who are emotionally unavailable, critical, or hard to please, because they feel like \"home.\"</li><li>Feeling like you don't know who you are anymore because you've silenced your own opinions.</li></ul><p>All of this adds up to seeming and feeling insecure. If these patterns resonate, I imagine that at some point they were genuinely helpful and protective. So the body thinks: <em>Hey, this works, let's keep doing it.</em> What feels familiar will always feel safe, even if it no longer serves us. </p></div><h2><a></a>How to break out of a fawn response cycle </h2><div><p>The fawn response is an unconscious pattern, so noticing it and bringing it into the forefront of your mind is the first step. Here are a few practices I like to recommend to my patients. </p><ol><li><strong>Pause. </strong>Before you go to over-apologize, shrink yourself, shove your needs down, get lost in an overthinking spiral — pause. Check in with yourself. Ask \"What do I need right now? What do I think of this? What am I feeling?\" It's great to care about others, but not if you abandon your needs in the process.</li><li><strong>Lean back. </strong>Let's say your parent sends you a text while you're in the middle of something, and your immediate instinct is to respond so you won't disappoint them. Instead, finish what you were doing and respond when you're free. This is all about releasing urgency where it's not necessary or helpful. By slowing down, we're communicating to our bodies that we're safe.</li><li><strong>Look inward. </strong>Practice expressing your needs in relationships that feel safest to you, in everyday ways. For example, when your partner asks what you want for dinner, instead of saying, \"Whatever you want!\" take a moment to ask yourself: \"What do I actually want?\" Can you allow yourself to express it? And then don't be afraid to do so. </li></ol><p>When we've been conditioned to believe that we aren't allowed to have needs, that we're responsible for managing other people's emotions, boundaries may be hard for us to set. Many of us may fear that if we set boundaries, we'll be seen as cold or mean. But I like to think of boundaries as a way to strengthen the relationships we really want in our lives. </p><p><a href=\"https://megjosephson.com/\" target=\"_blank\"><em><strong>Meg Josephson</strong></em></a><em> is a licensed psychotherapist and the author of the bestselling book, </em><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Are-You-Mad-Me-Focusing-ebook/dp/B0DQLMS9VG\" target=\"_blank\"><em>\"Are You Mad at Me?: How to Stop Focusing on What Others Think So You Can Start Living for You</em></a><em>.\"</em></p><p><em><strong>Last chance to save: Want to be your own boss?</strong> Final days to get 30% off Smarter by CNBC Make It's new online course, </em><a href=\"https://smarter.cnbcmakeit.com/p/how-to-start-a-business-for-first-time-founders?utm_source=cnbc&utm_medium=makeitarticle&utm_campaign=bottom\" target=\"_blank\"><em>How To Start A Business: For First-Time Founders</em></a><em>.

    "body": "<div><div><p>Utah-based drink chain Swig coined \"dirty soda\" back in 2010. Fifteen years later, the trend is fueling innovation everywhere from <span><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/PEP/\">PepsiCo</a><span><span></span></span></span> to <span><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/MCD/\">McDonald's</a><span><span></span></span></span>, infusing the sluggish beverage category with new life.</p><p>\"Dirty soda\" drinks use pop as a base, followed by flavored syrups, cream or other ingredients. While Swig claims credit — and the trademark — for dirty soda, TikTok videos and the reality TV show \"The Secret Lives of Mormon Wives\" have helped the trend spread far and wide, outpacing even the soda chain's speedy expansion.</p><p>Now, consumers can find it nearly everywhere, from grocery store aisles to fast-food chains.</p><p>In a few weeks, Pepsi plans to unveil two ready-to-drink dirty soda-inspired beverages at the National Association of Convenience Stores trade show in Chicago. The new drinks, the Dirty Dew and the Mug Floats Vanilla Howler, follow on the heels of the Pepsi Wild Cherry & Cream flavor, which hit shelves earlier this year.</p><p>\"I think it's a great opportunity for people like us, like PepsiCo, and for consumers to experience soda in a new way — and in some ways, an old way,\" Pepsi Beverages North America Chief Marketing Officer Mark Kirkham told CNBC, comparing the rise of dirty soda to root beer floats and the soda shops of yore.</p></div><div><p>PepsiCo's lineup of dirty soda-inspired drinks includes Pepsi Wild Cherry & Cream, Dirty Mountain Dew and Mug Floats Vanilla Howler.</p><p>Source: PepsiCo</p></div><div><p>Dirty soda has also drawn new interest beyond beverage players. According to Datassential, 2.7% of U.S. eateries offer a carbonated soft drink that includes cream or milk, up from 1.5% a decade ago.</p><p>Newcomers to the trend include TGI Fridays, which launched dirty soda as a limited-time menu item this summer that could be spiked with alcohol. McDonald's is <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2025/07/24/mcdonalds-tests-cosmcs-drinks.html\">testing flavored sodas</a>, like a \"Sprite Lunar Splash,\" at more than 500 locations after winding down its drinks-focused spinoff CosMc's in June. <span><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/YUM/\">Yum Brands'</a><span><span></span></span></span> Taco Bell has also been offering limited-time menu items, like a dirty Mountain Dew Baja Blast.</p></div><h2><a></a>Swig sets a trend</h2><div><p>These days, Swig has grown to more than 140 locations across 16 states. So far this year, its same-store sales have risen 8.2%, according to the privately held company. The Larry H. Miller Company, an investment firm founded by the former Utah Jazz owner, bought a majority stake in Swig in 2022 for an undisclosed sum.</p><p>\"I think we're doing for soda what Starbucks did for coffee,\" Swig CEO Alex Dunn said.</p><p>As Swig has grown, so have the number of chains looking to emulate its success. Rival soda shops like Sodalicious, Fiiz and Cool Sips are also benefiting from the trend. Coffee shops, like <span><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/BROS/\">Dutch Bros.</a><span><span></span></span></span>, have also added it to their menus. And now fast-food chains are hopping on the bandwagon.</p><p>\"It validates that this is a category, and McDonald's and Taco Bell wouldn't be getting into it if it wasn't something that had broad appeal that they could sell everywhere, in thousands of locations,\" Dunn said. \"It's kind of flattering that we created a category that now everybody is copying.\"</p><p>For restaurants, adding dirty soda to the menu is easier than it might sound.</p><p>\"It's a custom drink offering that, one, allows the brands to leverage something that they already have right there: their soda machine,\" said Erica Holland-Toll, culinary director at The Culinary Edge, which advises restaurants on food and beverage innovation. \"Two, it incorporates either a one-touch ingredient, or if they're already open for breakfast, it's quite likely that they've got a creamer in house.\"</p><p>On the other hand, offering customizable coffee drinks is usually much more difficult — which has contributed to the struggles at Starbucks.</p><p>\"The espresso world — that's so much more complicated,\" Holland-Toll said.</p><p>Dirty soda also has wide appeal. With less caffeine than coffee, consumers can drink it all day long. Plus, it's \"much more accessible\" than some coffee house trends, like an espresso tonic, according to Holland-Toll. The bright colors of many dirty sodas also make them more attractive to consumers, who were likely introduced to the trend via a TikTok video.</p><p>But perhaps above all, dirty soda can help restaurants draw in customers who are otherwise feeling thrifty.</p><p>\"It's an affordable fun treat. You're not going out and spending $30 or $50, right?\" said Sally Lyons Watt, chief advisor of consumer goods and foodservice insights for Circana. \"It's something that people can walk away saying, 'Wow, that was yummy' or 'I feel better because I just had that.'\"</p></div><h2><a></a>A pop for beverage companies</h2><div><p>Swig drinks.</p><p>Courtesy: Swig</p></div><div><p>A \"fun treat\" for consumers is adding up for beverage companies, helping reverse the decades-long trend of declining soda consumption in the U.S.</p><p>As health concerns mount and the array of beverage options expands, Americans have been drinking less soda for roughly two decades. In 2004, soda consumption peaked at 15.3 billion gallons, according to Beverage Marketing; by 2024, that figure had slid to 11.87 billion gallons. But consumption of carbonated soft drinks has been ticking up in the last two years, with 2025 estimated to reach 11.88 billion gallons. The rise of dirty soda, plus the growing popularity of prebiotic sodas, has likely helped the segment halt its downward trajectory.</p></div><div><p>Over the years, iced coffee has been stealing what the beverage industry calls \"share of throat\" from soda. With dirty soda, consumers can marry their love of customizing a cold drink with the lower caffeine content and taste of soda.</p><p>\"The carbonation makes it feel lighter in your mouth than coffee, for example,\" Holland-Toll said.</p><p>Dirty soda has also been attracting younger consumers who previously didn't drink much Pepsi or Dr Pepper. Swig's core customer base is young women between the ages of 18 and 35, according to Dunn.</p><p>That's true for Holly Galvin, a 31-year-old human resources professional based in Davenport, Iowa. She told CNBC that she rarely drank soda — until she saw dirty soda take the spotlight in the \"The Secret Lives of Mormon Wives\" last year. Now she makes her own dirty soda once or twice a week at home. With the onset of autumn, her go-to recipe these days uses Diet Dr Pepper as a base, with pumpkin spice creamer and a sprinkle of pumpkin pie spice on top.</p><p>Broadly, younger consumers are more inclined to seek out new drinks compared with older cohorts. Nearly three-quarters of Generation Z try a new beverage every month on average, according to Keurig Dr Pepper's 2025 trend report.</p><p>Beverage companies say that they are seeing a broader halo effect for soda as a result of the trend.</p><p>\"For us, it serves as a recruitment tool, bringing new users into the trademark,\" said Katie Webb, vice president of innovation and transformation for <span><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/KDP/\">Keurig Dr Pepper</a><span><span></span></span></span>. \"It really draws them all the way back to the base brand, which ends up being extremely impact for us long after.\"</p><p>And just as craft cocktail culture led to the rise of canned cocktails, the popularity of dirty soda is leading beverage giants to cash in with ready-to-drink versions that capitalize on the trend. Dr Pepper Creamy Coconut was the company's most successful limited-time carbonated soft drink to date, based on retail dollar sales, according to Webb. And Kirkham said Pepsi Wild Cherry & Cream has been one of the fastest-growing flavor segments for the company.</p><p>\"Some trends start retail and move over to foodservice,\" Circana's Lyons Wyatt said. \"This one was a foodservice trend moving into retail.\"</p><p>With Pepsi Wild Cherry & Cream and next year's launch of Dirty Dew and the Mug Floats Vanilla Howler, Kirkham expects that consumers will become even more creative with their concoctions.</p><p>\"I think it's actually giving [consumers] the chance to experiment even more and customize more,\" he said. \"Now you have a brand new base.\"</p></div></div>"

In 2016, while living in Korea, Ryan got in trouble for breaking his curfew. He lost out on several months of pay, was restricted to his military base and demoted from staff sergeant to senior airman.</p><p>\"After this, I was very depressed and very sad,\" Ryan said. \"But that depression and sadness make you think about where your life is going and it makes you redirect your life into the right direction.\"</p></div><div><p>In Vietnam, Ryan lives off of roughly $4,000 a month.</p><p>Louis Corallo for CNBC Make It</p></div><div><p>In that period of time that Ryan was restricted to his military base, he planned a trip to visit a friend in Vietnam.</p><p>\"It just looked like so much fun and it really lived up to all the hype,\" he said. \"I ended up having the best time of my life, and that depression was [just] gone.\"</p><p>Ryan says that after that first trip to Vietnam and seeing how happy he was, he didn't want to let go of that feeling.

Ryan also does occasional odd jobs like voiceover work, where his pay can range from $200 to $600 a month, and is an avid fan of day trading, where he averages about $300 a month.</p><p>\"This might not sound like a lot in America but trust me, this is more than enough to be middle or even above middle class in Vietnam,\" he says.</p></div><div><p>When Ryan moved to Vietnam, he bought a motorcycle to get around</p><p>Louis Corallo for CNBC Make It</p></div><div><p>Ryan lives in Ho Chi Minh City and has a two-bedroom, one-bathroom apartment in one of the country's tallest residential towers.

What he spends on groceries varies from $100 to $400 a month, as he often alternates between cooking his own food or dining out frequently.</p><p>\"Vietnam is the number one safest place I've ever lived.

The company operates entirely within the United States, with assets including printed and digital billboards, transit displays, including airports, street furniture and wallscapes and other spectaculars. </p><p><strong>Stock Market Value</strong>: $755.45 million ($1.52 per share) </p></div><div><h3>Activist: Anson Funds</h3><p><strong>Ownership: </strong>3.65% </p><p><strong>Average Cost: </strong>n/a<strong> </strong></p><p><strong>Activist Commentary: </strong>Anson Funds is a multistrategy fund founded in 2007 by Moez Kassam and has over $2 billion in assets. While not historically activists, on Oct. 3, 2023, Anson hired Sagar Gupta, former senior analyst and head of TMT investing at Legion Partners, to build out their activism strategy. </p><h3>What's happening</h3><p>On Sept. 22, Anson Funds announced that they are calling for a sale of Clear Channel Outdoor Holdings. </p><h3>Behind the scenes</h3><p>Clear Channel Outdoor is one of the largest out-of-home advertising companies that offers a variety of advertising services, including through billboards, street furniture displays, transit displays, and airport displays. In the U.S., they are one of the three big companies in this sector, with <span><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/LAMR/\">Lamar Advertising</a><span><span></span></span></span> and <span><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/OUT/\">Outfront Media</a><span><span></span></span></span> numbers one and two, respectively.</p><p>Historically, the challenges for CCO have centered around the company's two business lines – Americas and Europe, each with very different business models and valuations. The European business worked on fixed limited-term contracts with municipalities, which were re-bided at maturity. Because of this, the European business traded around 8x EBITDA multiple, while the U.S., largely comprised of owned billboards, traded closer 13 – 15x EBITDA.</p><p>These problems prompted Legion Partners to launch an activist campaign at CCO in May 2023, urging the company to consider a broad strategic review process, including divesting non-U.S. assets or a sale of the entire company. Legion also highlighted CCO's potential value proposition through its transition to digital billboards, which would allow each billboard to generate about four times more revenue and six to 10 times more EBITDA. Ultimately, they settled for a board seat for Legion co-founder Ted White, who still serves as a director today. Since then, CCO has executed a series of divestures, including selling its European business to Bauer Media Group, its Latin America business to Global Vía Públic, and, just two weeks ago, its Spain business to Atresmedia. These moves have transformed CCO into a U.S. pureplay and allowed it to start paying down its debt. However, despite this successful activist catalyst, CCO is yet to achieve the rerating some expected - currently, CCO trades at approximately 13-14 times EBITDA, versus peers Lamar and Outfront at 16-18 times. As a result, the stock is down 26.56% since Legion filed its 13D and over 90% from its IPO price.</p><p>On Sept. 22, Anson Funds joined the party, announcing that they are calling for a sale of the company. While this is a new campaign for Anson, this is not the beginning of their investment story. Sagar Gupta, who runs Anson's activism strategy, was at Legion Partners when they launched their campaign, and, perhaps not coincidentally, CCO has appeared in Anson's 13F holdings every quarter since Gupta joined the fund, now with a 3.65% position as of their most recent filing. So, Anson's call for a sale of the company is not a short-term, opportunistic campaign, but a decision made after years of analysis and working amicably with the company and at a time when it has become most feasible.</p><p>The company is now a U.S. pureplay, making it more focused and more valuable from a multiple perspective and easier to acquire from a regulatory perspective. Possible acquirers include <span><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/DEC-FR/\">JCDecaux</a><span><span></span></span></span> and Lamar.</p><p>In fact, JCDecaux terminated an agreement to buy CCO's Spain assets after facing restrictive demands from Spanish regulators. More specifically, JCDecaux maintains major exposure in virtually every OOH market outside the U.S. and has been rumored to be interested in the company.</p><p>As for Lamar, it has a history of acquiring CCO's assets, including a $458.5 million transaction in 2016, and has publicly expressed potential interest in additional transactions. In addition, <span><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/BX/\">Blackstone</a><span><span></span></span></span>'s recent acquisition of New Tradition at 18x EBITDA, <span><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/BRK.B/\">Berkshire Hathaway</a><span><span></span></span></span>'s new position in Lamar, and Ares Management's 8% position in CCO, all underscore the private equity appetite for the OOH industry. </p><p>Before coming to a decision like this, it is important to see what the standalone alternative looks like and why a sale may be more compelling for shareholders. To really properly restructure this business in the public market it would certainly require the time and risk of reconstituting the board and likely many management changes. Even with that, the company would still carry approximately $5 billion of long-term debt making it difficult to attract capital.</p><p>Additionally, CCO's promising digital transformation has been very slow. Since Legion's campaign, digital billboards have only grown to 5% of the portfolio, though they already count for over a third of CCO's revenue. While this underscores the huge value opportunity with digital conversion, it requires approvals of individual municipalities, significantly slowing the speed at which CCO can roll out digital ads, and not ideal for a public company that reports quarterly progress. As a result, after years of analysis and support, Anson has concluded that a sale offers the best risk adjusted path forward, a position we imagine Legion and other shareholders likely share.</p><p><em>Ken Squire is the founder and president of 13D Monitor, an institutional research service on shareholder activism, and the founder and portfolio manager of the 13D Activist Fund, a mutual fund that invests in a portfolio of activist 13D investments.</em></p></div>"

    "body": "<div><div><p>In a photo taken on May 26, 2016 a mobility scooter sits parked before rice fields in Gunwi, some 200 kilometres south of Seoul.\nBy 2030, a quarter of all South Koreans will be over 65 years old, and the overall population is expected to peak at around 52 million the same year before entering a period of steady decline. This so-called \"silver tsunami\" poses a major challenge for Asia's fourth-largest economy as the young, working-age population declines and the cost of caring for the elderly escalates. And in remote, rural communities like Gunwi, which lies some 200 kilometers southeast of Seoul, the trend is exacerbated by a youth exodus to the cities for work.</p><p>Ed Jones | Afp | Getty Images</p></div><div><p>South Korea is staring down a demographic freight train. The country, known as one of the \"Four Asian Tigers\" for its meteoric economic rise from postwar poverty, is confronting a demographic cliff that could stall growth within two decades, studies warn.</p><p>The Bank of Korea in 2024 <a href=\"https://www.bok.or.kr/eng/bbs/B0000354/view.do?menuNo=400409&nttId=10090724\" target=\"_blank\">projected</a> that the nation's rock-bottom birth rate will be one of the factors that will push it into a prolonged downturn by the 2040s.</p><p>A <a href=\"https://www.kdi.re.kr/eng/research/analysisView?art_no=3671\" target=\"_blank\">separate study</a> by the Korea Development Institute in May said demographic shifts will keep dragging on potential growth, which could fall to near zero by the 2040s. In its projections, South Korea's economy could contract by 2047 in a neutral scenario — or as early as 2041 in a pessimistic one.</p><p>South Korea's <a href=\"https://kosis.kr/statHtml/statHtml.do?sso=ok&returnurl=https%3A%2F%2Fkosis.kr%3A443%2FstatHtml%2FstatHtml.do%3Fconn_path%3DI3%26tblId%3DDT_1B81A21%26language%3Den%26orgId%3D101%26\" target=\"_blank\">birth rate currently stands at 0.748 in 2024</a>, a slight rise from the record low of 0.721 in 2023. That compares with an Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development average of <a href=\"https://www.oecd.org/en/publications/korea-s-unborn-future_75aa749c-en.html\" target=\"_blank\">1.43 in 2023</a>. The commonly cited \"replacement rate\" for countries to prevent a declining population is 2.1.</p><p>What a 0.72 fertility rate means for South Korea is that for every 100 Koreans, they would have about 36 children at current levels, shrinking the workforce across generations. That would cut into productivity and slow growth, experts say.</p></div><h2><a></a>Miracle for 'miracle on the Han River'?</h2><div><p>If technological innovation fails to offset this decline, Korea will see a \"sustained economic slowdown,\" Lee In-sil, Director of the Korea Peninsula Population Institute for Future, told CNBC.</p><p>And it's not for lack of trying. The country has rolled out package after package of support measures for newlyweds to have children, including baby bonuses and cash rewards. Seoul expended over $270 billion over the past 16 years on incentives to promote childbirth, according to a <a href=\"https://jme.bmj.com/content/51/6/371\" target=\"_blank\">2024 paper in the Journal of Medical Ethics</a>.</p><p>In 2023, Seoul even mooted an idea to <a href=\"https://time.com/6265842/south-korea-birth-rate-military-service-exemption/\" target=\"_blank\">exempt men from its mandatory military service</a> if they had three or more children before the age of 30.</p><p>But such efforts have made little impact in a country hailed as the \"Miracle on the Han River\" for its rapid postwar rise. \"I don't think there's any way that population policy can effectively raise fertility levels in South Korea in any appreciable way,\" Nicholas Eberstadt, a political economist at the American Enterprise Institute, told CNBC.</p></div><div><p>People cycle along a track backdropped with the city skyline in Singapore on June 27, 2025.         </p><p>Roslan Rahman | Afp | Getty Images</p></div><p>While South Korea's total fertility rate had marginally increased in 2024, \"we should not be popping the champagne corks,\" Eberstadt said, as it is still far below the 2.1 replacement rate. He noted that the desired family size in South Korea is still below the 2.1 replacement rate, which means that while the TFR might climb higher, it will not reach the 2.1 figure.</p><h2><a></a>Pension impact</h2><div><p>A shrinking workforce will also squeeze the pension system. In March, South Korea passed its first <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/south-korea-approves-reforms-shore-up-830-bln-state-pension-fund-2025-03-20/\" target=\"_blank\">pension fund reform</a> in 18 years, extending the depletion of the state pension fund by 15 years to 2071.</p><p>Among South Korea's four major pension systems — military, private school employees, civil servants, and national pensions — the military pension and civil servants' pension have already been depleted, Lee said.</p><p>Current reforms will see a structure where younger generations pay higher premiums while receiving lower benefits, which will inevitably lead to criticism for transferring the burden to future generations, she added.</p><p>A smaller draft pool also has defense implications. South Korea's active troops <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/south-koreas-military-has-shrunk-by-20-six-years-male-population-drops-2025-08-10/#:~:text=SEOUL%2C%20Aug%2010%20(Reuters),a%20report%20said%20on%20Sunday.\" target=\"_blank\">have fallen 20%</a> to about 450,000, down from 690,000 in 2019. South Korean armed forces are augmented by 28,500 U.S. troops, and Seoul has a mutual defense treaty with Washington.</p><p>South Korea is still formally at war with North Korea, as the Korean War in 1953 ended with a ceasefire, not a peace treaty. North Korea boasts one of the largest standing military forces in the world, with around 1.23 million personnel.</p></div><h2><a></a>No reason to be pessimistic</h2><div><p>Despite the bleak outlook for Asia's fourth-largest economy, some analysts caution against despair.</p><p>Lee, who was also the former director general of the national statistics agency, said economies can find ways to adapt.</p><p>\"When an economy faces recession, it typically responds with various efforts to enhance productivity through technological innovation, immigration policies, and other measures to prevent further decline,\" she said.</p><p>AEI's Eberstadt also noted that South Korea can maintain and even increase its prosperity despite aging and shrinking. He pointed to the 1970s, when fears of resource scarcity grew as the world's population surged and doubts arose about how to feed it.</p><p>In 1968, the book The Population Bomb, co-authored by former Stanford University professor Paul Ehrlich and researcher Anne Ehrlich, predicted global famine and a rising death rate as the population grew.</p><p>However, 50 years later, the world is \"richer, better educated, better fed, better housed, more prosperous, much less absolute poverty, than when the world was smaller,\" Eberstadt said.</p><p>KPPIF's Lee said that, considering the Korean government's rapid policy changes and evolving public awareness in recent years, she is confident that breakthrough solutions will emerge.</p><p>Very few people would have bet that South Korea could accomplish what it has today when the Korean War halted in 1953, Eberstadt said<strong>.</strong></p><p>\"Human beings are a uniquely adaptable,\" he added. \"This is a very different sort of challenge, but I don't think that the record of the immediate past suggests that it's smart money to bet against South Korean population.\"</p></div></div>"

Spending adjusted for inflation rose 0.4%, indicating consumers are still able to weather price increases.</p><p>On inflation, the annual rate is still well in excess of the Fed's 2% target, with core holding at 2.9%. But monthly increases are about in line with previous trends and Wall Street forecasts, putting the Fed on target almost certainly for an October rate cut and perhaps another when it meets again in December.</p><p>\"The economy has continued to surprise to the upside and despite the negativity captured in surveys and expressed by commentators, actions speak louder than words and consumers continue to spend, which is why corporate profits continue to exceed expectations,\" said Chris Zaccarelli, chief investment officer for Northlight Asset Management.</p><h3>More good news, more danger</h3><p>There was other good economic news this week as well.</p><p>Gross domestic product grew at a 3.8% annualized pace in the second quarter, according to a revision Thursday that was half a percentage point higher than previously thought. Again, the reason for the upside surprise was because consumer spending was considerably stronger than the prior estimate. Moreover, the Atlanta Fed raised its <a href=\"https://www.atlantafed.org/cqer/research/gdpnow\" target=\"_blank\">GDP tracking estimate</a> for the third quarter, pushing the expected growth rate up to 3.9%, or 0.6 percentage point higher than the last update a week ago.</p><p>Also, durable goods orders unexpectedly increased while new home sales surged 20%. All that came as a rise in <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2025/09/25/jobless-claims-tumble-to-218000-well-below-estimate-despite-fears-of-labor-market-weakness.html\">jobless claims</a> a couple weeks ago turned out to be a blip, with layoffs remaining low, though payroll growth has also been static at best.</p><p>Even if it's primarily consumers at the top end driving the growth, the macroeconomic numbers are at the very least telling a story of stability.</p><p>\"Often, when people feel pessimistic about the near-future economy, they begin reigning in spending, but that hasn't been the case thus far,\" said Elizabeth Renter, senior economist at consumer site NerdWallet. \"In fact, the strength of the consumer is credited with keeping the economy strong for the past handful of years, despite high inflation, high [interest] rates and great uncertainty.\"</p><p>However, Renter also noted the knife's edge that the economy sits on, with a broad swath of consumers not joining the stock market party and thus feeling down, and overall sentiment levels consistent with recessions.</p><p>\"Wealth provides some insulation from perceived economic volatility, and investors have been largely doing OK,\" she said. \"Consumers are attuned to the current economic risks — inflation and labor market weakness. This could be due to first-hand experiences — food prices rose significantly last month — or because they're on edge from headlines tracking key economic data.

They were rebuked for the move.</p><p>In a statement on Friday, the committee said that the batch included 8,544 documents in response to a subpoena in August, and that, \"Further review of the documents, which were redacted to protect the identity of victims, is ongoing.\" </p><p>The latest batch of documents received by the committee from the Justice Department contained itineraries and notes by Epstein memorializing invitations he'd sent, trips he'd planned and meetings he'd booked with tech and business leaders.</p></div><div><p>Demonstrators gather for a press conference calling for the release of the Jeffrey Epstein files outside the United States Captiol on Wednesday September 03, 2025 in Washington, DC. </p><p>The Washington Post | The Washington Post | Getty Images</p></div><div><p>One of the itineraries indicated that Epstein expected Musk to make a trip to his private island in the U.S. Virgin Islands on Dec. 6, 2014, but then asked \"is this still happening?\"</p><p>Musk told Vanity Fair in 2019 that he had visited Epstein's New York City mansion and that Epstein \"tried repeatedly to get me to visit his island,\" but the <span><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/TSLA/\">Tesla</a><span><span></span></span></span> CEO had declined.</p><p>In June, Musk wrote in a post on X, that he thought Trump and his administration were withholding Epstein-related files from the public view in order to protect the president's reputation.</p><p>\"Time to drop the really big bomb: @realDonaldTrump is in the Epstein files,\" Musk, who was in the midst of a public spat with the president, wrote at the time. \"That is the real reason they have not been made public.

Kirk Vining late last month put the alerts — called Surface Alert, or SURF-A — to the test by recreating some of the most serious <a href=\"https://www.ntsb.gov/investigations/Pages/DCA23FA149.aspx\" target=\"_blank\">near disasters</a> at airports in recent aviation history.</p><p>Moments before landing at Topeka Regional Airport, a Gulfstream G550 business jet was stopped on the same runway where Vining was about to touch down at the Kansas airport.</p><p>\"Traffic on runway!\" called out the automated alert in the cockpit of Honeywell's test plane: a 43-year-old Boeing 757, as Vining pulled up, aborted his landing and flew around the airport safely.</p></div><div><p>Honeywell's Boeing 757 test plane on the ground in Topeka, Kansas.</p><p>Erin Black/CNBC</p></div><div><p>A host of serious close calls in recent years has raised concerns about how to better avoid them in ever-more <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2025/01/30/american-airlines-plane-crash-military-helicopter-airspace.html\">congested airports</a>. The National Transportation Safety Board and other safety experts have <a href=\"https://www.ntsb.gov/news/press-releases/Pages/NR20240606.aspx\" target=\"_blank\">urged</a> more advanced cockpit alerts like the ones Honeywell is testing.</p><p>Runway incursions, when a plane, person or vehicle is on the runway when they shouldn't be, averaged 4.5 a day last year. The Federal Aviation Administration categorizes them by severity, where the top and rarest two are: \"a serious incident in which a collision was narrowly avoided\" followed by \"an incident in which separation decreases and there is a significant potential for collision may result in a time-critical corrective/evasive response to avoid a collision.\"</p><p>Serious runway incursions at U.S. airports peaked at 22 in 2023, the most in at least a decade. The FAA has added new lighting and other safety technology at airports around the country to try to get to its goal of zero close calls.</p></div><h2><a></a>'Good at being a bad pilot'</h2><div><p>\"He's very good at being a bad pilot,\" Thea Feyereisen, a distinguished technical fellow for Honeywell Aerospace Technologies, said of Vining. Her unit develops new cockpit features for aviators, and she said she expects the new suite to win regulator certification next year.</p><p>\"Seconds count when you're operating near the runway, and the sooner you can let the pilots know of a potential serious situation, the better,\" Feyereisen said.</p><p>The Honeywell test plane wasn't configured like a regular passenger jet, and there weren't any paying customers on board. It had a set of roomy seats toward the front of the plane, but in the back, Honeywell flight engineers were positioned at consoles, monitoring flight data and the alerts in real time. Earlier that day, Honeywell demonstrated the technology on a flight with Department of Transportation, FAA and NTSB officials on board, a company spokesman told CNBC.</p><p>Vining performed a simulation of another incident from 2023, when an <span><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/AAL/\">American Airlines</a><span><span></span></span></span> 777 bound for London crossed a runway where a <span><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/DAL/\">Delta Air Lines</a><span><span></span></span></span> 737 was taking off instead of holding short of the runway as an air traffic controller instructed. The Delta pilot in that situation aborted takeoff and both planes landed safely at their destinations.</p></div><div><p>Consoles aboard Honeywell's test plane, a Boeing 757.</p><p>Magdalena Petrova/CNBC</p></div><div><p>Honeywell said its SURF-A alerts could have given the pilots 10 additional seconds of reaction time with a potential collision notice. The new program Honeywell is testing uses Automatic Dependent Surveillance – Broadcast, or ADS-B data, a GPS for an airplane.</p><p>\"It's usually a very good working environment between pilots, air traffic control, airport management,\" Vining said. \"We get it done safely, efficiently and smoothly. But you could also see just the slightest interruption, a little variation, and things can go wrong very quickly.\"</p><p>The aerospace giant already offers another suite of alerts that tells pilots if they're about to make a mistake like landing or taking off on a taxiway instead of a runway, for example, with visual alerts on a screen as well as aural warnings — \"Caution! Taxiway!\" The so-called Smart X package also alerts pilots if flaps are not set correctly, if the runway is too short, or if they are coming in too high or too fast, among other situations.</p><p>\"As aircraft get closer to the airports where there are other airplanes that are also flying low to the ground, attempting to land, that's the most dangerous spot to have a collision occur,\" said Jeff Guzzetti, a retired air safety investigator with the NTSB and the FAA. </p><p>Those alerts have been on <span><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/ALK/\">Alaska Airlines</a><span><span></span></span></span> planes for years and, more recently, <span><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/LUV/\">Southwest Airlines</a><span><span></span></span></span> has added them. Honeywell said the alerts are currently flying on more than 3,000 planes operated by 20 airlines, but that's still limited adoption with hundreds of carriers operating worldwide.</p><p>\"Since we've implemented the software, I can't think of an instance where we've had a runway incursion,\" said Dave Hunt, Southwest's vice president of safety and security and a 737 pilot.</p><p><span><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/AAL/\">American Airlines</a><span><span></span></span></span> was also training its pilots on those alerts in the second quarter of the year, according to a lesson plan that was seen by CNBC. Last month, American received its first aircraft with the runway awareness and other alerts on board, a spokeswoman said, adding that its Boeing 737 pilots have now been trained on the tools.</p><p>The alerts aren't required by regulators, but the FAA said it is \"reviewing recommendations\" from the Runway Safety Alerting Subgroup \"to determine next steps,\" referring to a group of airline, aerospace, pilot union, government and industry officials that <a href=\"https://www.faa.gov/media/88956\" target=\"_blank\">last year</a> recommended new planes include more advanced cockpit alerts in case of situational awareness issues at airports.</p><p>\"The alerts occur further away from the runway so that if there's an aircraft on the runway, you're not having to make that decision very low to the ground,\" said Jon Sites, director of flight operations safety at Alaska Airlines.</p></div><h2><a></a>The Swiss cheese model</h2><div><p>Honeywell's test plane during a demonstration of new anti-collision warning technology.</p><p>Leslie Josephs/CNBC</p></div><div><p>The United States is the busiest aviation market in the world, with 44,000 flights, carrying 3 million travelers a day. Serious aviation accidents are rare, and fatal crashes are rarer still.</p><p>But a nearly 16-year streak without a fatal incident was broken on Jan. 29 when an Army Black Hawk helicopter <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2025/01/30/aircraft-down-in-potomic-river-near-dca-airport.html\">collided</a> into an American Airlines regional jet that was moments away from landing at Washington Reagan National Airport, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2025/01/30/american-airlines-helicopter-collision-worst-air-disaster-in-years.html\">killing the 67 people</a> aboard the two aircraft and raising <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2025/01/30/american-airlines-plane-crash-military-helicopter-airspace.html\">concerns</a> about congested U.S. airspace to a fever pitch. </p><p>The aviation industry relies on a so-called Swiss cheese safety model, where each slice provides protection but comes with holes that are ideally covered when safety measures are stacked on top of one another.</p><p>\"Aviation is built on layers of safety upon layers,\" said Sites at Alaska Airlines.</p><p>Honeywell's demonstration flight last month from Charles B. Wheeler Downtown Airport in Kansas City, Missouri, recreated a real incident that took place on a foggy morning in February 2023 in Austin, Texas, when a <span><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/FDX/\">FedEx</a><span><span></span></span></span> Boeing 767 plane aborted landing seconds before touching down on the same runway from which an air traffic controller cleared a <span><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/LUV/\">Southwest</a><span><span></span></span></span> 737 to take off.</p><p>The FedEx pilot had seen the outline of the Southwest plane through the fog and pulled up and later landed safely. Both flights continued to their destinations safely, but the two aircraft had gotten as close as 150 feet apart, less than the length of the FedEx 767, according to federal safety investigators.</p><p>Feyereisen said Honeywell's technology could have provided the FedEx pilots in the 2023 Austin incident 28 seconds of advanced notice of traffic on the runway, when they only had a few moments to react, according to a report from the NTSB.</p></div><h2><a></a>Not yet required</h2><div><p>Engineers collect data aboard a Honeywell test plane.</p><p>Magdalena Petrova/CNBC</p></div><div><p>Feyereisen said the new technology could be retrofitted on older aircraft and is available for new jets.</p><p>\"In general, the software costs tens of thousands of dollars [per plane], but not hundreds of thousands of dollars,\" Feyereisen said. \"So if you're looking at [a] $150 million aircraft … it is less than a half a penny per passenger cost to the operation.\"</p><p>Southwest this year added the software to its fleet of about 800 Boeing 737s. It cost between $20 million and $30 million to outfit the planes, Hunt said.</p><p>\"It is cheaper than an accident,\" he said.</p><p>On Feb. 25, a Southwest plane aborted its arrival after it was cleared to land at Chicago Midway International Airport when a Bombardier Challenger 350 business jet advanced onto its runway, with the Southwest jet passing less than 200 feet between the aircraft, before safely landing after a go-around, according to the NTSB.</p><p>Such close calls \"are very, very rare, but obviously they're something that are concerning and that we would try to mitigate as much as possible,\" said Hunt. The Honeywell software is \"very effective at ensuring our pilots are aware of where they are on the airport\" and \"does a really good job of preventing inadvertent runway incursions while taxiing,\" he added.</p></div><h2><a></a>Limitations</h2><div><p>A Honeywell test pilot performs a go-around because of traffic on the runway at Topeka Regional Airport in Kansas as part of a demonstration.</p><p>Erin Black/CNBC</p></div><div><p>When developing the warnings, Feyereisen said it's key not to overwhelm pilots with too much information, known as \"nuisance alerts,\" which could end up being a distraction from critical safety tasks rather than a help.</p><p>\"If you're blasting alerts through a cockpit speaker at low altitudes during a critical phase of flight, such as approach to landing or takeoff, where pilots' attention needs to be fully focused … you create too many distractions,\" Southwest's Hunt said.</p><p>There are also limitations to the existing alerts and the new programs Honeywell is testing. To avoid in-air collisions, commercial aircraft are required to have what's called the Traffic Alert and Collision Avoidance System, or TCAS, which helps them see traffic around them in displays in the cockpit. But that system is generally used for altitudes of at least 1,000 feet.</p><p>That would not have necessarily helped the pilots on the American Airlines plane that was below 400 feet in the fatal collision with the Black Hawk helicopter in January in Washington, D.C.</p><p>\"We are exploring alternatives to close that gap where you kind of can merge TCAS and ADS-B-type information together,\" Feyereisen said. </p><p>Sites, the safety director at Alaska, said the D.C. crash was \"a huge, unexpected event in the industry, but it's just, I think, our track record through the last 50 years shows that this is a very, very rare event.\"</p><p>\"That's why we continue as an industry to try to find even better technology out there and enhancements to the current technology to keep this from ever happening and take the probability down to as low a level as possible,\" he said. \"I don't know if in any aviation system you'll ever get to zero, but I mean, we're going to try to get as close to zero probability as we can.\"</p><p>— <em>CNBC's</em><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/erin-black/\"> <em>Erin Black</em></a><em> contributed to this report.</em></p></div></div>"
