Walmart plans to freeze the company's global headcount of 2.1 million workers for the next three years while still forecasting revenue growth the company says will come from wider adoption of AI technologies, according to the Journal.</p><p>McMillon expects white-collar office jobs to be among the first to be affected, as Walmart rolls out more AI-powered chatbots and other tools to handle tasks related to customer service and supply chain tracking.</p><p>Ultimately, even workers in Walmart stores and warehouses will eventually see more tasks taken on by AI tools, and those remaining workers will also need to be willing to embrace the new technologies to stay relevant, McMillon said in another recent interview, published Sunday by the <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/walmart-ceo-mcmillon-ai-workers-154ece8ba303ce6ac8c5030e6f719aa1\" target=\"_blank\">Associated Press</a>.</p><p>\"I think no one knows how this is going to play out exactly,\" he said, reiterating his expectation that \"basically, every job gets changed.\"</p></div><h2><a></a>Workers need to get 'plussed up,' adapt to using AI at work</h2><div><p>McMillon's recommendation for how workers can best prepare for the age of AI at work is for them to <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2025/01/07/how-to-use-ai-to-be-more-productive-and-successful-at-work.html\">familiarize themselves with new AI tools</a> and technologies to become as efficient and productive as possible.</p><p>\"I think the best way to think about it is getting 'plussed up,'\" he told the AP. \"'How can I lean in the role that I have, regardless what that role is, to adopt new tools, leverage them and make things better than they would've otherwise been?'\"</p><p>As more and more companies expand their use of AI tools in the workplace, recruiters say they are specifically targeting prospective employees with the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2024/02/09/the-no-1-soft-skill-you-need-to-get-hired-now-according-to-linkedin.html\">open-mindedness and adaptability</a> to keep up with any fast-paced changes at work, according to a <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/business/learning/blog/top-skills-and-courses/most-in-demand-skills\" target=\"_blank\">LinkedIn blog post</a> published in February 2024.</p><p>The ability to use these new AI tools effectively and productively is already a<strong> </strong>major challenge for many workers. In a September <a href=\"https://www.betterup.com/workslop\" target=\"_blank\">survey</a> of 1,150 full-time U.S. desk workers, conducted by BetterUp and Stanford University, 40% of respondents reported <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2025/09/23/ai-generated-workslop-is-destroying-productivity-and-teams-researchers-say.html\">receiving AI-generated \"workslop\"</a> — work produced by AI tools that \"masquerades as productivity\" but actually falls short of human-produced work and can typically take hours for a human worker to fix.</p><p>As much as skilled human workers are still needed to ensure new AI tools are integrated efficiently into companies' workflows, humans surpass AI in terms of soft skills like <a href=\"https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10502005/\" target=\"_blank\">communication and critical thinking</a> that will make them valuable for the foreseeable future, Amazon Web Services CEO <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/video/2025/08/08/pro-watch-cnbcas-full-interview-with-aws-ceo-matt-garman.html\">Matt Garman told</a> CNBC's \"Closing Bell Overtime\" in August.</p><p>″[Those skills] are important today. I think they'll be just as important, if not more important [in the future],\" said Garman.</p><p>McMillon agrees that human workers bring certain skills that Walmart will always need in a wide variety of roles, especially when it comes to communicating with customers. \"Until we're serving humanoid robots and they have the ability to spend money, we're serving people,\" McMillon said about customers' preference to interact with human employees, according to the Journal. \"We are going to put people in front of people.\"</p><p>The most coveted workers will always be those with the flexibility to combine soft skills with technical skills, McMillon told the AP. He pointed to Walmart store managers as a prime example, as they have to communicate effectively with customers, sales associates and supply chain workers.</p><p>\"Those skills that the store manager has are both human and technical,\" involving communication and critical thinking along with the ability to implement AI tools that track everything from sales trends to supply chain logistics, McMillon said.</p><p>\"I think the skills that we have as human beings are valuable,\" said McMillon. \"They always have been, and that'll be even more true in the future.\"</p><p><em><strong>Want to up your AI skills and be more productive?</strong> Sign up now for CNBC's new online course, </em><a href=\"http://smarter.cnbcmakeit.com/p/how-to-use-ai-at-work?utm_source=cnbc&utm_medium=makeitarticle&utm_campaign=bottom\" target=\"_blank\"><em><strong>How to Use AI to Be More Successful at Work</strong></em></a><em><strong>.</strong></em> <em>Expert instructors will teach you how to get started, practical uses, tips for effective prompt-writing, and mistakes to avoid..</em></p><p><em>Plus, </em><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/make-it-newsletters/\"><em>sign up for CNBC Make It's newsletter</em></a><em> to get tips and tricks for success at work, with money and in life, and </em><a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/groups/13194471/\" target=\"_blank\"><em>request to join our exclusive community on LinkedIn</em></a><em> to connect with experts and peers.</em></p></div><div><p><img src=\"https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/108199266-1758027174439-GettyImages-1056373084.jpg?v=1758027217&w=750&h=422&vtcrop=y\" alt=\"The ultimate guide to starting your own business: A CNBC Make It course\" /><span></span><span><span></span></span></p></div></div>"

When asked what kind of irrational financial advice and moves she sees too many people taking, she said that \"manifesting\" has too many individuals thinking they can believe their way to a better financial future.</p><p>Her colloquial response played on the internet phrase, \"delulu,\" which isn't just short for delusional, but often directly refers to an individual's self-confidence, according to <a href=\"https://www.merriam-webster.com/slang/delulu\" target=\"_blank\">Merriam-Webster's definition</a>. </p><p>\"I'm an optimist, so I want to believe in the abundance, and I do, but I also want people to ground themselves in reality as well,\" Evans added.</p></div><h2><a></a>The problem with positive thinking alone</h2><div><p><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2022/12/08/how-greys-anatomy-star-ellen-pompeo-manifested-her-beach-house.html\">Manifesting is a popular strategy</a> for getting virtually anything in life, especially on TikTok where the \"manifestation\" tag has nearly 9 million videos often featuring manifesting experts or everyday practitioners claiming they've manifested their romantic partners, dream jobs or even large sums of money. Over 307,000 videos feature the tag \"<a href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/tag/manifestmoney\" target=\"_blank\">manifestmoney</a>.\"</p><p>One user with nearly 2 million followers <a href=\"http://tiktok.com/@somachhaya/video/7524422483366120735?_t=ZP-8zy4uyOTXAM&_r=1\" target=\"_blank\">claims she earned $50,000</a> in a single day thanks to the power of manifesting. CNBC Make It reached out to the user for comment, but did not hear back. </p><p>The belief is especially common among younger Americans, with 48% of adults ages 18 to 29 saying they believe that manifestation, defined as \"thinking positively or visualizing something can help make it happen, even without taking any other action\" works, according to a <a href=\"https://today.yougov.com/topics/politics/survey-results/daily/2025/05/28/451be/1\" target=\"_blank\">YouGov poll</a> from May 2025. That share drops slightly to 46% for Americans ages 30 to 44 who believe manifesting works.</p><p>While manifesting isn't<strong> </strong>necessarily a bad habit, it will probably be difficult for you to actually see changes in your life without taking concrete action. Believing you will land a six-figure job or find your dream apartment in your price range is a good place to start, for example, but you will most likely have to go looking for those things and take action like applying to jobs or working with a broker <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2025/01/03/to-be-successful-in-2025-a-therapist-says-do-these-5-things.html\">to be successful</a>.</p><p>Manifesting may seem to work in some situations because of confirmation bias, Evans says. For example, if you're manifesting that money will come to you and then you happen to find $20 on the ground, believers may argue that the manifestation is working. But if you're manifesting thousands of dollars to make your rent or pay off a large debt, you're most likely going to have to take a more active approach than assuming money is going to keep falling into your lap.</p><p>That doesn't mean you should take the opposite approach and tell yourself <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2024/05/19/neuropsychologist-4-tips-to-stop-the-cycle-of-negative-self-talk.html\">you're not going to</a> accomplish the goal.</p><p>\"We believe the things that we say to ourselves,\" Evans says. \"If you're telling yourself over and over and over again, 'it's not going to work out for me,' you're going to find ways to confirm that bias versus: 'It is going to work out for me.'\"</p><p>But on top of telling yourself it's going to work out, you should be taking steps in that direction.</p><p>\"Taking action along side the [abundance] mindset work is imperative. Whether that means applying while you manifest your dream job, creating a financial plan or getting support to help you navigate getting out of debt, action is needed,\" Evans says. \"Your manifestations may set the direction you want to go, but I need your actions to build out the path for your financial wellness.\"</p><p><em><strong>Want to be your own boss?</strong> Sign up for Smarter by CNBC Make It's new online course, </em><a href=\"https://smarter.cnbcmakeit.com/p/how-to-start-a-business-for-first-time-founders?utm_source=cnbc&utm_medium=makeitarticle&utm_campaign=bottom\" target=\"_blank\"><em>How To Start A Business: For First-Time Founders</em></a><em>.

Prosecutors had sought a sentence of 12 years.</p><p>Javice, 33, cried as she delivered an emotional statement to the court Monday. Standing to address the judge, Javice said she felt profound remorse for her actions and asked for forgiveness from JPMorgan, employees of the startup, shareholders and investors.</p><p>At one point, Javice turned and directly addressed her family, sitting in the front row, to apologize and thank them for what she called unwavering support.</p><p>\"I will spend my entire life regretting these errors,\" Javice said.</p><p>\"I'm asking with all of my heart for forgiveness,\" she said. \"I ask your Honor to temper justice with mercy … I will accept your judgment with dignity and humility.\"</p><p>Judge Alvin Hellerstein told Javice her words were \"very moving\" and that the way she's devoted her life is \"highly commendable,\" but that he couldn't give her the forgiveness she sought.</p><p>\"I sentence people not because they're bad, but because they do bad things,\" Hellerstein told Javice before delivering the 85-month prison sentence. \"I don't think you'll be committing other crimes and that you'll be devoting your life to service, but others have to be deterred.\"</p><p>In addition to prison, Javice was sentenced to three years of supervision, along with $22.36 million in forfeiture and $287 million in restitution to JPMorgan.

For growth, most economists calculate the impact as about 0.1 percentage point off gross domestic product for week. Being that the longest closure lasted 35 days, from-late 2018 until the following January, that's not a lot for a $30 trillion economy. The short-term losses are usually easily recouped in subsequent quarters, according to Bank of America.</p></div><h2><a></a>Labor market trouble</h2><div><p>However, in this case the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2025/09/23/powell-says-slowing-labor-market-prompted-rate-cut-sees-challenging-situation-ahead.html\">labor market already has been wobbly</a>. In particular, the Washington, D.C. region, where a large share of federal government employees call home, has taken a hit from the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2025/07/02/doge-government-layoffs-could-start-becoming-a-factor-in-jobs-report.html\">layoffs earlier this year</a> advocated by Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency advisory board.</p><p>Shutdowns automatically mean that employees not deemed essential are furloughed, but are always summoned back once the impasse ends. Trump threatened, in an NBC News interview Sunday, that \"we are going to cut a lot of the people that ... we're able to cut on a permanent basis.\"</p><p>The impact on the monthly nonfarm payrolls report wouldn't show up until the October count is released in November, where Trump's threat \"could have a more severe near-term impact\" than usual, wrote Nomura economist David Seif.</p><p>But that brings up another wrinkle: Should the shutdown last any significant amount of time, it could delay the release of key economic data.</p></div><h2><a></a>Impact on the BLS</h2><div><p>The Labor Department said Friday it will shut down virtually all activity. The department's Bureau of Labor Statistics, which releases multiple key economic reports including the monthly jobs count, would be shuttered as long as the shutdown lasts. In an action plan to address the situation, the department warned of delays and also said a \"reduction in quality\" for the data could occur.</p><p>For Social Security recipients, a delay in the release of the consumer price index inflation reading could impact cost-of-living adjustments.</p><p>The situation also could impact the Federal Reserve, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2023/09/20/fed-interest-rate-moves-affected-by-government-shutdown.html\">which relies on BLS data</a> when making its decisions on interest rates and other matters relating to monetary policy.</p><p>\"While the US government may be headed for a shutdown, we expect little economic impact,\" Mark Cabana, head of rates strategy at Bank of America, said in a note. \"A shutdown would pause economic data releases, leaving the Fed reliant on private data for its policy decisions if the shutdown extends.\"</p><p>One corollary would be the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2023/09/20/fed-interest-rate-moves-affected-by-government-shutdown.html\">2013 shutdown</a>, when the September jobs report was delayed until Oct. 22. That month's CPI also was postponed by two weeks.</p><p>Elizabeth Renter, senior economist at NerdWallet, concurred with most Wall Street analyses in that the ultimate impact should be \"relatively mild.\" However, she noted the potential hit to the labor market.</p><p>\"The most immediate and impactful effect is on furloughed federal employees and contractors,\" she said. \"When households are forced to go without income, even for a week, it can set back their financial stability significantly.\"</p></div></div>"

    "body": "<div><div><p>Utah-based drink chain Swig coined \"dirty soda\" back in 2010. Fifteen years later, the trend is fueling innovation everywhere from <span><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/PEP/\">PepsiCo</a><span><span></span></span></span> to <span><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/MCD/\">McDonald's</a><span><span></span></span></span>, infusing the sluggish beverage category with new life.</p><p>\"Dirty soda\" drinks use pop as a base, followed by flavored syrups, cream or other ingredients. While Swig claims credit — and the trademark — for dirty soda, TikTok videos and the reality TV show \"The Secret Lives of Mormon Wives\" have helped the trend spread far and wide, outpacing even the soda chain's speedy expansion.</p><p>Now, consumers can find it nearly everywhere, from grocery store aisles to fast-food chains.</p><p>In a few weeks, Pepsi plans to unveil two ready-to-drink dirty soda-inspired beverages at the National Association of Convenience Stores trade show in Chicago. The new drinks, the Dirty Dew and the Mug Floats Vanilla Howler, follow on the heels of the Pepsi Wild Cherry & Cream flavor, which hit shelves earlier this year.</p><p>\"I think it's a great opportunity for people like us, like PepsiCo, and for consumers to experience soda in a new way — and in some ways, an old way,\" Pepsi Beverages North America Chief Marketing Officer Mark Kirkham told CNBC, comparing the rise of dirty soda to root beer floats and the soda shops of yore.</p></div><div><p>PepsiCo's lineup of dirty soda-inspired drinks includes Pepsi Wild Cherry & Cream, Dirty Mountain Dew and Mug Floats Vanilla Howler.</p><p>Source: PepsiCo</p></div><div><p>Dirty soda has also drawn new interest beyond beverage players. According to Datassential, 2.7% of U.S. eateries offer a carbonated soft drink that includes cream or milk, up from 1.5% a decade ago.</p><p>Newcomers to the trend include TGI Fridays, which launched dirty soda as a limited-time menu item this summer that could be spiked with alcohol. McDonald's is <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2025/07/24/mcdonalds-tests-cosmcs-drinks.html\">testing flavored sodas</a>, like a \"Sprite Lunar Splash,\" at more than 500 locations after winding down its drinks-focused spinoff CosMc's in June. <span><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/YUM/\">Yum Brands'</a><span><span></span></span></span> Taco Bell has also been offering limited-time menu items, like a dirty Mountain Dew Baja Blast.</p></div><h2><a></a>Swig sets a trend</h2><div><p>These days, Swig has grown to more than 140 locations across 16 states. So far this year, its same-store sales have risen 8.2%, according to the privately held company. The Larry H. Miller Company, an investment firm founded by the former Utah Jazz owner, bought a majority stake in Swig in 2022 for an undisclosed sum.</p><p>\"I think we're doing for soda what Starbucks did for coffee,\" Swig CEO Alex Dunn said.</p><p>As Swig has grown, so have the number of chains looking to emulate its success. Rival soda shops like Sodalicious, Fiiz and Cool Sips are also benefiting from the trend. Coffee shops, like <span><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/BROS/\">Dutch Bros.</a><span><span></span></span></span>, have also added it to their menus. And now fast-food chains are hopping on the bandwagon.</p><p>\"It validates that this is a category, and McDonald's and Taco Bell wouldn't be getting into it if it wasn't something that had broad appeal that they could sell everywhere, in thousands of locations,\" Dunn said. \"It's kind of flattering that we created a category that now everybody is copying.\"</p><p>For restaurants, adding dirty soda to the menu is easier than it might sound.</p><p>\"It's a custom drink offering that, one, allows the brands to leverage something that they already have right there: their soda machine,\" said Erica Holland-Toll, culinary director at The Culinary Edge, which advises restaurants on food and beverage innovation. \"Two, it incorporates either a one-touch ingredient, or if they're already open for breakfast, it's quite likely that they've got a creamer in house.\"</p><p>On the other hand, offering customizable coffee drinks is usually much more difficult — which has contributed to the struggles at Starbucks.</p><p>\"The espresso world — that's so much more complicated,\" Holland-Toll said.</p><p>Dirty soda also has wide appeal. With less caffeine than coffee, consumers can drink it all day long. Plus, it's \"much more accessible\" than some coffee house trends, like an espresso tonic, according to Holland-Toll. The bright colors of many dirty sodas also make them more attractive to consumers, who were likely introduced to the trend via a TikTok video.</p><p>But perhaps above all, dirty soda can help restaurants draw in customers who are otherwise feeling thrifty.</p><p>\"It's an affordable fun treat. You're not going out and spending $30 or $50, right?\" said Sally Lyons Watt, chief advisor of consumer goods and foodservice insights for Circana. \"It's something that people can walk away saying, 'Wow, that was yummy' or 'I feel better because I just had that.'\"</p></div><h2><a></a>A pop for beverage companies</h2><div><p>Swig drinks.</p><p>Courtesy: Swig</p></div><div><p>A \"fun treat\" for consumers is adding up for beverage companies, helping reverse the decades-long trend of declining soda consumption in the U.S.</p><p>As health concerns mount and the array of beverage options expands, Americans have been drinking less soda for roughly two decades. In 2004, soda consumption peaked at 15.3 billion gallons, according to Beverage Marketing; by 2024, that figure had slid to 11.87 billion gallons. But consumption of carbonated soft drinks has been ticking up in the last two years, with 2025 estimated to reach 11.88 billion gallons. The rise of dirty soda, plus the growing popularity of prebiotic sodas, has likely helped the segment halt its downward trajectory.</p></div><div><p>Over the years, iced coffee has been stealing what the beverage industry calls \"share of throat\" from soda. With dirty soda, consumers can marry their love of customizing a cold drink with the lower caffeine content and taste of soda.</p><p>\"The carbonation makes it feel lighter in your mouth than coffee, for example,\" Holland-Toll said.</p><p>Dirty soda has also been attracting younger consumers who previously didn't drink much Pepsi or Dr Pepper. Swig's core customer base is young women between the ages of 18 and 35, according to Dunn.</p><p>That's true for Holly Galvin, a 31-year-old human resources professional based in Davenport, Iowa. She told CNBC that she rarely drank soda — until she saw dirty soda take the spotlight in the \"The Secret Lives of Mormon Wives\" last year. Now she makes her own dirty soda once or twice a week at home. With the onset of autumn, her go-to recipe these days uses Diet Dr Pepper as a base, with pumpkin spice creamer and a sprinkle of pumpkin pie spice on top.</p><p>Broadly, younger consumers are more inclined to seek out new drinks compared with older cohorts. Nearly three-quarters of Generation Z try a new beverage every month on average, according to Keurig Dr Pepper's 2025 trend report.</p><p>Beverage companies say that they are seeing a broader halo effect for soda as a result of the trend.</p><p>\"For us, it serves as a recruitment tool, bringing new users into the trademark,\" said Katie Webb, vice president of innovation and transformation for <span><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/KDP/\">Keurig Dr Pepper</a><span><span></span></span></span>. \"It really draws them all the way back to the base brand, which ends up being extremely impact for us long after.\"</p><p>And just as craft cocktail culture led to the rise of canned cocktails, the popularity of dirty soda is leading beverage giants to cash in with ready-to-drink versions that capitalize on the trend. Dr Pepper Creamy Coconut was the company's most successful limited-time carbonated soft drink to date, based on retail dollar sales, according to Webb. And Kirkham said Pepsi Wild Cherry & Cream has been one of the fastest-growing flavor segments for the company.</p><p>\"Some trends start retail and move over to foodservice,\" Circana's Lyons Wyatt said. \"This one was a foodservice trend moving into retail.\"</p><p>With Pepsi Wild Cherry & Cream and next year's launch of Dirty Dew and the Mug Floats Vanilla Howler, Kirkham expects that consumers will become even more creative with their concoctions.</p><p>\"I think it's actually giving [consumers] the chance to experiment even more and customize more,\" he said. \"Now you have a brand new base.\"</p></div></div>"

    "body": "<div><div><p>The Hollywood sign in Los Angeles on Jan. 22, 2024</p><p>Mario Tama | Getty Images News | Getty Images</p></div><div><p>There was a time when Hollywood simply referred to a neighborhood in the central region of Los Angeles.</p><p>These days, \"Hollywood\" has come to represent the entire domestic entertainment business — and it's at a crossroads.</p><p>Its namesake area is no longer the bustling production hub it once was, as studios have chased tax benefits and lower labor costs overseas. It's more expensive than ever to make a movie or television series, especially after the pandemic and the writers and actors strikes which reshaped how creatives are paid in the new streaming economy.</p><p>Many in the industry have sought to rectify the movement of thousands of jobs to other domestic filming hubs — like Georgia, New York, Texas, New Mexico and North Carolina — and international locations including Canada, the United Kingdom, Ireland, Hungary, Croatia, Romania, Australia and New Zealand.</p><p>In July, California Gov. Gavin Newsom increased the state's total film and TV tax credit to $750 million, nearly doubling the previous cap, to try to encourage more productions to film in Los Angeles.</p><p>President Donald Trump put a spotlight on the issue again Monday when he <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2025/09/29/trump-movie-furniture-tariffs.html\">reiterated tariff threats</a> on films made outside of the United States.</p><p>\"Our movie making business has been stolen from the United States of America, by other Countries, just like stealing 'candy from a baby,'\" he wrote in a post on social media, adding that he would impose a 100% tariff on \"any and all movies that are made outside of the United States.\"</p><p>Trump made similar comments in May. Then as now, it is unclear how he plans to implement these duties, who they would target and who would foot the potential bill. Actor Jon Voight, who Trump appointed as \"special ambassador\" to Hollywood, said tariffs would only be implemented in \"certain limited circumstances,\" and the administration would focus on <a href=\"http://rollingstone.com/tv-movies/tv-movie-news/donald-trump-revives-tariffs-movies-made-outside-us-1235437188/#:~:text=Following%20Trump's%20initial%20tariff%20announcement,on%20Trump's%20latest%20tariff%20call.\" target=\"_blank\">developing federal tax incentives</a>, revising the tax code, creating co-production treaties with other countries and offering subsidies for infrastructure.</p><p>As Trump revives his threats, there are still numerous unanswered questions about how the U.S. could put a tariff on movies — and whether the move would really help bring production back to Hollywood.</p><p>\"Since movies aren't goods, they're services, it remains unclear how a tariff could be placed on a service, but should some logistical loophole be found and enforced, it'll cause chaos within the entertainment industry,\" said Mike Proulx, vice president and research director at Forrester, in a statement Monday. \"Then the question becomes what's next? Where's the line between a movie and a limited time series? What about the ad industry that saves money by shooting commercials outside the US?\" </p><p>The production of film and TV isn't always simple. Some productions will shoot parts of a film internationally and pieces of it domestically. Would films be taxed based on the percentage of the film that was shot outside the U.S.? What would that mean for foreign films seeking release in the the country?</p><p>\"What if the primary studio is in the U.S., but the film has to shoot on location, because the ... story takes the ... characters on a journey. Is there a threshold?\" asked Alicia Reese, analyst at Wedbush. \"There are just too many questions.\"</p><p>Industry experts also worry about how the duties, if they are even enforceable, could affect relationships with other countries. Hollywood relies on international box office sales to recoup lofty film budgets. China has already limited the number of Hollywood-made movies it will showcases on screens. Other regions <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2025/02/03/trump-tariffs-could-threaten-hollywood-production-box-office-recovery.html\">could retaliate and do the same</a>.</p><p>\"I strongly support bringing movie making back to California and the U.S.,\" Democratic Sen. Adam Schiff of California said in a statement Monday. \"Congress should pass a bipartisan globally-competitive federal film incentive to bring back production and jobs, rather than levy a tariff that could have unintended and damaging consequences.\"</p></div><h2><a></a>Dollars and cents</h2><div><p>At the end of the day, Hollywood's productions woes all come down to one thing — money.</p><p>Budgets are getting tighter. Streaming fundamentally changed the media landscape, fewer people are going to movie theaters and studios are no longer generating significant revenue from DVD sales. So studios have to grip their purse strings tighter or face the wrath of investors who are still trying to calculate what the dissolution of linear TV, and its lucrative ad revenue, means for media titans like <span><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/DIS/\">Disney</a><span><span></span></span></span>, <span><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/CMCSA/\">Universal</a><span><span></span></span></span>, <span><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/WBD/\">Warner Bros.</a><span><span></span></span></span> and <span><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/PSKY/\">Paramount</a><span><span></span></span></span>.</p><p>Even before the pandemic and the dual labor strikes, Hollywood was filming movies and television in other parts of the U.S. and internationally.</p><p>In some cases, this was because the script dictated a specific international city or naturally occurring landscape to suit the story being told. It would have been difficult, for example, to film the Lord of the Rings franchise or \"Game Of Thrones\" entirely on the backlot of a Los Angeles studio.</p><p>The crux of the issue comes down to the sound stages.</p><p>Part of the exodus from Los Angeles is also the result of the development of domestic production hubs that offer better financial rewards, like tax credits and cash rebates, than what is available on the West Coast. Over the last two decades, 38 states have shelled out <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2024/03/21/arts/states-hollywood-film-tax-incentives.html\" target=\"_blank\">more than $25 billion in filming incentives</a>, according to a report from The New York Times.</p><p>These incentives have allowed states like Georgia to develop infrastructure for big-budget productions and build out a skilled workforce of local crew members, craftsmen and technicians. Georgia offers these monetary perks as a way of not only creating jobs in production, but bolstering economic growth in the communities around those filming locations. Hotels, restaurants, lumber yards, vehicle rental companies and even gas stations get a bump from having projects produced locally.</p><p>International production hubs are the second piece of this puzzle. Sites outside the U.S. not only offer enticing film incentives, but also cheaper labor and even health care. In fact, Los Angeles ranked as the sixth-best location for filming according to a <a href=\"https://prodpro.com/blog/2025-tv-film-outlook-report/\" target=\"_blank\">survey of studio executives published in January by ProdPro</a>, a company that tracks production trends. Toronto, Canada; the U.K.; Vancouver, Canada; Central Europe and Australia all ranked higher than Los Angeles.</p><p>Canada, known as Hollywood North, has been the home of Hollywood film and television production for decades. Shows like \"Riverdale,\" \"Suits,\" \"Supernatural,\" \"Once Upon a Time,\" \"Schitt's Creek\" and \"The Handsmaid's Tale\" were all filmed just north of the border from Los Angeles. On the movie front, \"Mean Girls,\" \"Twilight,\" \"My Big Fat Greek Wedding,\" \"American Psycho\" and \"Scream VI\" are some of the titles that were shot in Canada.</p><p>Like Georgia, Canada offers an enticing tax credit for stateside studios, but has also has developed a top-notch workforce of industry talent in front of and behind the camera.</p><p>And competition abroad is heating up. More countries have bolstered their filming infrastructure, and increased their generous tax incentives. Many nations also have looser rules on what kinds of projects qualify for the financial benefits. New Zealand, the U.K., Ireland, Iceland, Australia, Norway, Italy, Hungary, Germany and the Czech Republic are all jockeying for productions — <a href=\"https://prodpro.com/blog/2025-tv-film-outlook-report/\" target=\"_blank\">and they are taking share</a>, according to data from ProdPro.</p><p>For example, Australia and New Zealand saw a 14% increase in the production of projects costing $40 million or more between 2022 and 2024. Meanwhile, the U.S. experienced a 26% decline.</p><p>\"People are still going to have to film on location,\" Wedbush's Reese said, noting that the industry is not going to completely shift the kinds of stories being told to adhere to filming locations only available in the U.S. \"There are plenty of pieces of that movie, or parts of that movie, that are filmed on a sound stage and that sound stage could just as easily exist in the U.S. as it could anywhere else.\"</p><p>\"And that's where the question lies: how do we get the sound stages?\" she continued.</p><p>Reese noted that Los Angeles has already made moves to encourage studios to use its existing infrastructure with Newsom's new tax incentives.</p><p>\"We need to create a better tax structure to encourage more productions, the base of the production, the sound stages, to be located in the U.S.,\" she said.</p><p><em>Disclosure: Comcast is the parent company of Fandango and NBCUniversal, which owns CNBC. Versant would become the new parent company of Fandango and CNBC upon Comcast's planned spinoff of Versant.</em></p></div></div>"

Obviously the name of the game is to resell it at the highest price possible.\"</p><p>Amazon provides another channel for that. The e-commerce giant first announced it was entering car sales in 2023, through a partnership with <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2023/11/16/amazon-to-let-dealers-sell-cars-on-its-site-starting-with-hyundai.html\">Hyundai dealers</a>, which it has since expanded.</p><p>Shoppers on Amazon can secure financing and fill out paperwork, but they have to still head to a lot to pick up the car. In the U.S., new car sales are governed by laws protecting dealers against direct sales, though some companies such as <span><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/TSLA/\">Tesla</a><span><span></span></span></span>, <span><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/LCID/\">Lucid</a><span><span></span></span></span>, and <span><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/RIVN/\">Rivian</a><span><span></span></span></span> have found a way to sell directly to the public by opting not to have any dealers in the first place.</p><p>The Hertz partnership is essentially the same as the Hyundai tie-up. So far, Amazon is keeping no inventory of its own. Instead, it is providing the software to execute sales online through its own website.</p><p>It is quite a different way of doing things than Amazon — which is known for keeping warehouses of goods — is used to.</p><p>\"Amazon, ironically enough, has been trying for 15 or 20 years to get into the automotive retail segment,\" said Steve Greenfield, a general partner at Automotive Ventures, which invests in mobility companies. \"Ultimately, what's giving them heartburn consistently is the fact that with any other product category, they can control the unpacking experience. When a box lands on your doorstep, they know exactly what you're unpacking. With automotive retail. It's totally different. That last mile is fulfilled at a dealership where they have almost zero visibility and zero control of the unpacking experience.\"</p><p>But John Possumato, a former Chrysler Plymouth dealer and entrepreneur, said the Hertz-Amazon partnership should give dealers reason to worry.</p><p>In an <a href=\"https://www.wardsauto.com/retail/industry-voices-a-strategic-inflection-point-\" target=\"_blank\">open letter to the National Automobile Dealers Association</a>, Possumato said rental companies like Hertz can buy cars in bulk, which qualifies them for discounts. This enables the company to sell cars for less than a dealer can afford. That's been an issue in the past, Possumato said. Hertz already runs 45 retail lots around the United States.</p><p>But the digital era supercharges the problem, he said.</p><p>\"You have Amazon, the biggest merchandizer retailer in the country, and you've got the biggest or one of the biggest rental fleets, and they're pairing together to sell these cars,\" he said.</p><p><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/video/2025/09/29/heres-how-the-amazon-hertz-deal-could-threaten-dealers.html\"><strong>Watch the video to learn more</strong></a><strong>.</strong></p></div>"
