    "description": "Want your kids to be emotionally intelligent with good people skills? Child psychologist Reem Raouda has studied more than 200 child-parent relationships. Based on her research, she's identified the nine things successful parents do to raise kids with strong social skills.",
    "body": "<div><div><p>Many parents think kids develop <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2025/02/23/kids-with-the-best-people-skills-have-parents-who-do-these-things-therapist.html\">strong social skills</a> from memorizing phrases like \"please\" and \"thank you.\" But the real foundation is built much earlier, at home and through everyday interactions.</p><p>I've studied over <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/reem-raouda/\">200 parent-child relationships</a>, and I'm a mother myself. I've found that kids learn to communicate and connect by watching how their parents behave. And being raised in an environment where <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2025/05/25/ive-studied-over-200-kids-emotionally-safe-parenting-is-the-new-parenting-style-that-works-better-than-the-rest.html\">emotional safety</a> and <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2025/03/30/psychologist-parents-who-have-close-bonds-with-their-adult-kids-do-7-things.html\">authentic connection</a> are modeled makes a world of difference.</p><p>Here are nine things that parents who raise kids with exceptional social skills do early on.</p></div><h2><a></a>1. They talk openly about feelings and emotions</h2><div><p>Kids learn emotional vocabulary when parents name and normalize feelings.</p><p>Parents who say things like, \"I feel disappointed we can't go today, but I'll take a deep breath and try again tomorrow,\" are modeling <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2025/09/14/ive-worked-with-over-1000-kids-the-no-1-phrase-to-validate-your-child-at-every-age.html\">emotional regulation</a> in real time. It helps kids later express themselves with friends, like saying, \"I'm sad you didn't play with me,\" instead of lashing out.</p></div><h2><a></a>2. They model empathy in everyday life</h2><div><p>Children absorb how parents treat others: the neighbor, the cashier, and even each other.</p><p>A simple, “She has her hands full, so let's hold the door for her,” teaches more about empathy than any lecture. Small daily acts of kindness become the blueprint for lifelong social awareness.</p></div><h2><a></a>3. They foster real, authentic confidence</h2><div><p>True confidence comes from being loved as you are and from being given the chance to try (and sometimes fail).</p><p>Letting kids try out for the team or pour their own milk, even if it gets messy, says: \"I trust you.\" When paired with encouragement like, \"I love how you kept trying,\" kids feel capable and connected, without needing to be perfect.</p></div><h2><a></a>4. They teach how to make things right after conflict</h2><div><p>Every relationship includes conflict. What matters is whether kids learn how to repair.</p><p>Parents who say, \"You hurt your sister's feelings. Let’s think of what we can say or do to make it right,\" are teaching a critical life skill: Repair strengthens relationships, and kids who learn it early grow into adults who can sustain healthy bonds.</p></div><h2><a></a>5. They validate their child's feelings</h2><h2><a></a>6. They help their kids recognize social cues</h2><div><p>Kids don't always pick up on social dynamics naturally. Parents who gently point out, \"Did you notice how his voice got quiet? He might be feeling shy,\" help kids tune into the subtleties of human interaction.</p><p>These micro-lessons add up and shape <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2025/02/23/kids-with-the-best-people-skills-have-parents-who-do-these-things-therapist.html\">socially aware</a>, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2023/07/27/quiz-do-you-have-high-emotional-intelligence.html\">emotionally intelligent adults</a>.</p></div><h2><a></a>7. They don't rush in to solve every conflict for their child</h2><div><p>The second kids argue, the impulse is often to intervene. But the best social learning happens when parents step back just enough.</p><p>Saying, \"I'm here if you need help, but I think you two can work it out,\" creates space for problem-solving and compromise. With time, kids learn they can handle conflict themselves because they were trusted to practice.</p></div><h2><a></a>8. They treat mistakes as learning opportunities</h2><div><p>When parents treat mistakes as evidence of growth, kids build resilience instead of shame.</p><p>A parent who calmly says, “You spilled the juice. Let’s grab a towel and clean it up,” models accountability without humiliation. Children raised this way see mistakes as opportunities to learn. That mindset makes them more adaptable and compassionate with others.</p></div><h2><a></a>9. They listen more than they lecture</h2><div><p>Kids need to see what good listening looks like.</p><p>When parents pause, make eye contact, give full attention (without rushing to fix or interrupt) and say, \"Tell me more about that,\" they teach how to be patient and respectful. Over time, kids carry this into friendships, becoming the kind of people others feel safe opening up to.</p><p>Good social skills are becoming more and more important in today's world, and those skills grow from connection and emotional safety. By practicing early, you're ensuring that your kid will grow up to be empathetic humans who are ready for real-world relationships.</p><p><a href=\"https://www.highloveparenting.com/\" target=\"_blank\"><em><strong>Reem Raouda</strong></em></a><em> is a leading voice in conscious parenting and the creator of </em><a href=\"https://parentingwithreem.com/foundations\" target=\"_blank\"><em>FOUNDATIONS</em></a><em>, a step-by-step guide that helps parents heal and become emotionally safe. She is widely recognized for her expertise in children's emotional safety and for redefining what it means to raise emotionally healthy kids.

    "body": "<div><p>For some brides and grooms, the prospect of writing and publicly reciting their wedding vows can be daunting.</p><p>That's where Katelyn Peterson comes in.</p><p>Peterson, 37, is the founder and CEO of Wedding Words, a wedding vow and speech-writing business, and she's passionate about helping \"tongue-tied\" couples express themselves.</p><p>\"I got into this business to help people put their heart into words,\" Peterson says.</p><p>Since founding Wedding Words eight years ago, Peterson has turned her writing talent into business bringing in six figures a year, and she's written over 700 speeches for couples, bridal party members and parents.</p><p>Peterson worked in sales for years before founding Wedding Words, but she's always considered herself \"a writer at heart.\"</p><p>The catalyst for her career change came in 2017, when Peterson's father asked her for help writing her grandfather's eulogy.</p><p>Her father's original draft sounded \"like it could have been written about anyone's dad or anyone's grandpa,\" Peterson recalls.</p><p>Peterson helped her father rewrite the eulogy to include meaningful memories and details about her grandfather.</p><p>Her father's response touched her: \"He said, 'This is exactly what I wanted to say. I just didn't know how to put it into words,' and he had tears in his eyes,\" Peterson recalls.</p><p>That experience inspired Peterson to start Wedding Words just a few months later.</p><p>\"I thought, there have to be other people that have these milestone moments that they really want to do emotional justice to, but they just don't know how to put it into words,\" she says.</p><h3><strong>Hitting 'an emotional chord'</strong></h3><p>One of the most common misconceptions Peterson hears about her work is that people who hire her \"just don't care enough\" to write their speeches themselves.</p><p>\"I think it's quite the opposite,\" she says. \"I think you care so much that you feel like you can't do it on your own.\"</p><p>Peterson begins her process with an introductory video call, during which she and the client talk about their goals for the speech, and Peterson teases out significant details and key stories to include.</p><p>The process is often emotional, Peterson says, and clients cry \"all the time.\"</p><p>\"We're hitting an emotional chord,\" she says. \"We're getting somewhere deep, and that's a good thing.\"</p><p>After Peterson drafts the speech, she and the client go over revisions in another video call, before finalizing the speech and practicing it out loud.</p><p>\"Writing is half of it, but it's also making sure your delivery is done in a way that hits those emotional and humorous beats,\" Peterson says.</p><p>By the end of the last call, clients almost always let out a visible sigh of relief, Peterson says.</p><p>\"They're like, 'I feel so much better. I can't believe I'm actually excited to say this speech in front of 200 people,'\" she says. \"That's the moment that I know, OK, I did my job.\"</p><h3><strong>The need for 'human storytelling'</strong></h3><p>Starting a speech-writing business from scratch wasn't easy. In the beginning, Peterson spent hours scouring wedding Facebook groups in search of potential clients.</p><p>She took on her first clients for free, instead asking them to share a review or testimonial on her site.</p><p>\"I found that people weren't ready to pay me to write something so personal without hearing what the experience is like from other people,\" she says.</p><p>Soon, Peterson was able to start charging a \"nominal fee\" of $350 for speechwriting services, and the business grew from there, she says.</p><p>Peterson currently charges $999 to write and edit wedding speeches, and $499 for a \"Power Hour\" editing session.</p><p>Wedding Words' monthly revenue was over $8,000 in August, according to documents reviewed by CNBC Make It, and the company consistently brings in six figures in gross revenue each year.</p><p>A point of pride for Peterson is that Wedding Words is entirely self-funded, and the business has been profitable since day one, she says.</p><p>Until this year, Peterson was the company's only employee — \"I was super, super precious with not outsourcing my writing for the longest time,\" she says — but she realized that scaling the business would require some extra hands.</p><p>Peterson hired a full-time writer earlier this year, and she's in the process of onboarding a second.</p><p>\"The goal is to be able to serve more clients more quickly and keep it a lower price point as a result,\" she says.</p><p>As a writer, Peterson's business has definitely been impacted by AI.</p><p>She says Wedding Words' blog has lost half of its web traffic in the past year, and some of her competitors are churning out content at a rapid rate using AI tools.</p><p>Still, Peterson is less concerned about AI impacting Wedding Words' long term revenue.</p><p>\"The people that are happy using AI tools to write their wedding speech are not my clients,\" she says. \"My clients value human storytelling.\"</p><p>\"No matter what changes in the technical world, there is still a need for human touch and the human heart, and I don't think that that's ever gonna go away,\" she continues.</p><p><em><strong>Want to be your own boss?</strong> Sign up for Smarter by CNBC Make It's new online course, </em><a href=\"https://smarter.cnbcmakeit.com/p/how-to-start-a-business-for-first-time-founders?utm_source=cnbc&utm_medium=makeitarticle&utm_campaign=bottom\" target=\"_blank\"><em>How To Start A Business: For First-Time Founders</em></a><em>.

When it comes to buying a home, it's very similar in many ways to falling in love or choosing a partner,\" he says.</p><p>\"There are so many boxes to check and sometimes you have to compromise but understanding what really matters and what your core values are and what the core characteristics of a partner or home is and being able to help someone discuss that and discover it for themselves and community it to me is a very meaningful bonus, having done it for the past 15 years.\"</p></div><div><p>Schulman started working as a licensed real estate agent in August of this year.</p><p>Coldwell Banker Warburg</p></div><div><p>Schulman says hosting \"Catfish: The TV Show\" taught him how to find workarounds that he is using now to do things like get appointments for his clients.</p><p>\"I'm so used to being told no and hitting dead ends, especially when it comes to searching for things,\" he adds. \"I think not getting discouraged and not taking no for an answer is a really good skill that I've built over the years making the show.\"</p><p>Getting into real estate was something that felt very natural to Schulman. He was born in New York City and grew up watching his dad, Robert Schulman, working as a broker at Coldwell Banker Warburg. His grandfather, Lowell Schulman, also worked in the industry, but as a builder and developer, before he died in 2017.</p><p>\"I've grown up in the city and have lived in so many different neighborhoods.

I had so many birthday parties at Build-A-Bear,\" Craycroft told CNBC. \"It really is a nostalgic place, and I have so many happy memories there.\"</p><p>The company has recently been targeting adults like Craycroft as it diversifies its portfolio and leans into the nostalgia of the brand. Despite macroeconomic headwinds, the company posted record-breaking revenue in the first half of fiscal 2025, reaching $252.6 million, an increase of nearly 12% from the year-ago period.</p><p>And in its second-quarter <a href=\"https://buildabear.gcs-web.com/news-releases/news-release-details/build-bear-workshop-reports-record-second-quarter-and-first-0\" target=\"_blank\">earnings report</a> at the end of August, the retailer raised its outlook after the success of its tariff mitigation strategies — namely, increasing its inventory in the first quarter while operating under the assumption that tariffs would raise prices.</p><p>Build-A-Bear's stock is up roughly 60% year-to-date and is fast approaching a $1 billion market cap, even as other retailers struggle to recover losses from tariffs.</p></div><div><div><svg width=\"256\" height=\"256\">Stock Chart IconStock chart icon</svg><p><img src=\"https://static-redesign.cnbcfm.com/dist/a54b41835a8b60db28c2.svg\" alt=\"hide content\" /></p></div><p>Build-A-Bear Workshop stock</p></div><div><p>Founded in 1997, the company has been focused on scenario-planning and ensuring its brand stays true to its nostalgic roots while also adapting to the ever-changing macroenvironment, according to CEO Sharon Price John, who took over the company in 2013.</p><p>Though the \"retail apocalypse\" means retailers have seen less foot traffic in malls over the past decade, John said Build-A-Bear has evolved to be \"so much more\" than just a storefront. The company has diversified its positions beyond malls into cruise ships, amusement parks, hospitality and more.</p><p>\"It's a really emotional, memorable experience that creates a tremendous amount of of equity,\" John told CNBC. \"Those strong feelings that consumers have for brands are very stretchable beyond just that one experience.\"</p><p>With more than 600 stores across 32 countries, the company has been exploring new options to offer its signature experience in different ways, including expanding with a host of international stores and creating a line of \"Mini Beans,\" which are smaller, pre-stuffed toys.</p></div><div><p>Stuffed animals are seen at a Build-A-Bear Workshop in Herald Square, New York on Sept. 16, 2025. </p><p>Laya Neelakandan | CNBC</p></div><div><p>John attributed the company's success to its forward-looking strategies. Though Build-A-Bear imports a \"vast majority\" of its products from China and Vietnam, John said the tariff impacts were not as drastic as they could have been because the company planned ahead.</p><p>\"Success isn't an accident, and it often takes years of planning to be able to weather difficult situations,\" John said.</p><p>But the company's core brand success goes beyond just the keeping the balance sheet clean, she added.</p><p>\"The other piece is that I think that we're in the right place at the right time,\" John said. \"There's a lot of planning, but sometimes you just happen to be in the right zeitgeist. Gifting is in the zeitgeist, 'kidulting' is a part of the zeitgeist, personalization is a part of the zeitgeist, returning to comfort things is a part of the zeitgeist, stuffed animals is in the zeitgeist right now.\"</p><p>D. A. Davidson analyst Keegan Cox said there are a multitude of reasons that Build-A-Bear has seen growth even as the macroenvironment shows signs of a potential <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2025/08/04/contentious-july-jobs-report-confirms-the-us-economy-is-slowing-sharply.html\">economic slowdown</a>.</p><p>One of the factors that's helping the company, Cox said, is its ability to \"discreetly\" raise prices of certain items without customers noticing because it's constantly creating new products to stick with current trends that are priced differently.</p><p>\"No consumer is really going to be able to tell, because there's no direct comparable product,\" he told CNBC. \"I think that's a good little tariff mitigation strategy that's kind of just built into their model.\"</p><p>Cox said the company's diverse revenue stream, between new products and new demographics, has been significantly helping it to stay afloat and successful. The analyst said he's seeing \"momentum\" in the company, especially as it ramps up inventory ahead of the holiday season.</p></div><div><p>Stuffed animals are seen at a Build-A-Bear Workshop in Herald Square, New York on Sept. 16, 2025. </p><p>Laya Neelakandan | CNBC</p></div><div><p>Its expansion into international stores has been a particularly effective tool, he added.</p><p>\"In my opinion, those stores just are a super high return on capital, and there's a large runway for growth there that I think is finally starting to show up in the share price,\" Cox said.</p></div><h2><a></a>Embracing the nostalgia</h2><div><p>Craycroft and her friends are a prime example of one of the company's most effective strategies: marketing to adults who grew up with the iconic brand.</p><p>At her best friend's 26th birthday party, Craycroft said she and her friends all felt like children again – except this time, she came prepared with Pinterest research into the specific aesthetic of teddy bear that would match her room and her lifestyle.</p><p>Her golden brown bear, named Bearett, is styled with grey checkered pajamas and bunny-ear slippers.</p></div><div><p>Build-A-Bear teddy bear</p><p>Photo: Cammie Craycroft</p></div><div><p>\"It all just really reminded me of how sweet this is and how it can be something that you can connect with people on,\" she said. \"But it's also just fun and silly.\"</p><p>Craycroft and her friends aren't the only ones leaning into the brand. After making a <a href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/@cammiecraycroft/video/7512159308226809134\" target=\"_blank\">TikTok</a> about her adult relationship with the toy company, she said she saw most of her views on the video came from people searching for \"Build-A-Bear\" on the app.</p><p>According to a <a href=\"https://ir.buildabear.com/news-releases/news-release-details/new-national-teddy-bear-day-survey-finds-92-still-have-their\" target=\"_blank\">recent survey</a> conducted by Build-A-Bear, 92% of adults still own their childhood teddy bears, and nearly 100% of the respondents said stuffed animals are for all ages, not just kids.</p><p>The nostalgia of Build-A-Bear for its older customers, and those who want to carry it on for the next generation, is a huge factor in continuously driving sales, according to University of Pennsylvania marketing professor Americus Reed.</p><p>\"If we learn anything from the Cracker Barrel saga,\" Reed said, referring to the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2025/09/09/cracker-barrel-restaurant-remodels-logo-controversy.html\">internet turmoil</a> over the restaurant chain's attempt at a <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2025/08/27/cracker-barrel-rebrand-why-companies-retreat-from-consumer-criticism.html\">rebrand</a>, \"it is that nostalgia matters, and I think it's a big part of it.\"</p><p>In what's become an \"attention deficit\" economy, with a plethora of options available to consumers at all times, Reed said Build-A-Bear's ability to build upon its existing footprint while also innovating its digital and social media presence has helped it to retain its attention among consumers of all ages.</p><p>Because of the \"ritualistic\" experience of buying a stuffed animal at Build-A-Bear, Reed said, the identity of the brand becomes closely intertwined with the customers.</p><p>\"As you toil with putting something together and personalizing it, you're essentially creating this extension of yourself, and that's incredibly powerful,\" Reed said. \"And then you go home with it, and you can think about it and look at it. That's really hard to replicate.\"</p><p>Reed added that Build-A-Bear has become a good case example of how to effectively build a brand that creates deeper relationships with its consumers than others, creating a sense of loyalty.</p><p>\"The pressure to create something that's special enough to break through the sort of attention deficit economy is going to be the pressure test of who's going to be able to be successful in the future,\" he said. \"They're going to have the most traction.\"</p></div></div>"

But bond traders saw the move as an opportunity to \"sell the news\" after recent bond gains, according to Peter Boockvar, chief investment officer at One Point BFG Wealth Partners.</p><p>Traders of longer-dated bonds \"don't want the Fed to be cutting interest rates,\" Boockvar said.</p><p>Their selling of long-term bonds drove down the price and drove up the yield. Prices and yields for bonds move in an inverse direction.</p><p>Easing monetary policy at a time when inflation is running above the Fed's 2% target and the economy looks steady can indicate the central bank is \"taking the eye off\" inflation, Boockvar said, a key risk to longer duration securities. Updated economic projections from the Fed released Wednesday showed policymakers seeing <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2025/09/17/fed-forecasts-only-one-rate-cut-in-2026-a-more-conservative-outlook-than-expected.html\">slightly faster inflation </a>next year<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2025/09/17/fed-forecasts-only-one-rate-cut-in-2026-a-more-conservative-outlook-than-expected.html\">.</a></p></div><div><div><svg width=\"256\" height=\"256\">Stock Chart IconStock chart icon</svg><p><img src=\"https://static-redesign.cnbcfm.com/dist/a54b41835a8b60db28c2.svg\" alt=\"hide content\" /></p></div><p>30-year Treasury yield, 1 month</p></div><div><p>Investors have been looking for the Fed to shift its emphasis from fighting inflation to boosting the labor market following <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2025/09/09/jobs-report-revisions-september-2025-.html\">weak employment data earlier this month.</a> Fed Chair Jerome Powell <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2025/09/17/fed-meeting-today-live-updates.html\">called Wednesday's rate cut </a>a \"risk management\" move, pointing to the softening labor market.</p><p>\"The bond market, if [longer yields] continue higher, would be sending a message that, 'We don't think you should be aggressively cutting interest rates with inflation stuck at 3%,'\" Boockvar said.</p><p>Additionally, Boockvar said higher yields this week came after longer-dated bond prices had steadily risen in recent months, sending yields lower. It was a similar move as was seen following the Fed's rate cut in September of last year, he noted.</p></div><div><div><svg width=\"256\" height=\"256\">Stock Chart IconStock chart icon</svg><p><img src=\"https://static-redesign.cnbcfm.com/dist/a54b41835a8b60db28c2.svg\" alt=\"hide content\" /></p></div><p>10-year Treasury yield, 6 months</p></div><div><p>But Boockvar said it's noteworthy that the 10-year note yield is little changed compared with early 2024, despite the Fed cutting rates multiple times since then.</p><p>A rise in longer-term yields can have implications for mortgage loans on big-ticket purchases like homes and autos as well as credit card costs. Mortgage rates <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/video/2025/09/18/mortgage-rates-up-after-fed-rate-cut.html\">rose following the Fed rate cut this week</a> after reaching <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2025/09/16/mortgage-rates-drop-to-3-year-low-ahead-of-fed-meeting.html\">a three-year low</a> ahead of the central bank action.</p><p>Homebuilder <span><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/LEN/\">Lennar</a><span><span></span></span></span> on Thursday missed Wall Street's revenue expectations for the third quarter and gave weak guidance for deliveries in the current quarter. Co-CEO Stuart Miller said in a statement that Miami-based Lennar faced \"continued pressures\" in today's housing market and \"elevated\" interest rates for much of the third quarter.</p><h3>Looking for 'terrible news'</h3><p>While the stock market can move significantly on one rate cut, bond investors are trying to make decisions based on what it sees as the bigger picture, according to Chris Rupkey, chief economist at FWDBONDS.</p><p>\"It's not the journey, it's the destination,\" he said. That can be determined in part by looking at the central bank's projections for future rate cuts and the perceived neutral rate on the Fed funds rate.</p><p>\"They're trying to assess: What's the end game in this?,\" Rupkey said. \"The bond market really will react once it is assured that the central bank is going to lower the rates dramatically.\"</p><p>One Point's Boockvar said longer-term U.S. yields can also be influenced by their international counterparts, which also tend to be moving higher, making it key to follow overseas economic developments and moves by foreign central banks.</p><p>Still, investors should be careful what they wish for when it comes to long-dated yields, Rupkey warned.</p><p>Yield declines often signal a recession on the horizon, the economist said. In fact, Rupkey attributed this week's yield jumps in part to falling unemployment filings, which suggest less risk of an economic downturn anytime soon.</p><p>\"Don't rejoice so much about getting bond yields down, because it may mean that it's impossible for you to find work,\" Rupkey said.</p><p>\"Unfortunately, the bond market only really embraces bad news,\" he added. And \"not just bad news ... terrible news.\"</p><p><em>— CNBC's Fred Imbert and Diana Olick contributed to this report.</em></p></div></div>"

    "body": "<div><div><p>Mark Zuckerberg, chief executive officer of Meta Platforms Inc., wears a pair of Meta Ray-Ban Display AI glasses during the Meta Connect event in Menlo Park, California, US, on Wednesday, Sept. 17, 2025.</p><p>David Paul Morris | Bloomberg | Getty Images</p></div><div><p>When it comes to the new $799 <span><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/META/\">Meta</a><span><span></span></span></span> Ray-Ban Display glasses, it's the device's accompanying fuzzy, gray wristband that truly dazzles.</p><p>I was able to try out Meta's next-generation smart glasses that the social media company <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2025/09/17/zuckerberg-799-meta-ray-ban-display-glasses.html\">announced</a> Wednesday at its annual Connect event. These are the first glasses that Meta sells to consumers with a built-in display, marking an important step for the company as it works toward CEO Mark Zuckerberg's vision of having headsets and glasses overtake smartphones as people's preferred form of computing.</p><p>The display on the new glasses, though, is still quite simplistic. Last year at Connect, Meta unveiled its Orion glasses, which are a prototype capable of overlaying complex 3D visuals onto the physical world. Those glasses were thick, required a computing puck and were built for demo purposes only.</p><p>The Meta Ray-Ban Display, however, is going on sale to the public, starting in the U.S. on Sept. 30.</p><p>Though the new glasses include just a small digital display in their right lens, that screen enables unique visual functions, like reading messages, seeing photo previews and reading live captions while having a conversation with someone.</p><p>Controlling the device requires putting on its EMG sensor wristband that detects the electrical signals generated by a person's body so they can control the glasses via hand gestures. Putting it on was just like strapping on a watch, except for the small, electric jolt I felt when it activated. It wasn't as much of a shock as you feel taking clothes out of the dryer, but it was noticeable.</p><p>Donning the new glasses was less shocking, until I had them on and saw the little display emerge, just below my right cheek. The display is like a miniaturized smartphone screen but translucent so as to not obscure real-world objects.</p><p>Despite being a high-resolution display, the icons weren't always clear when contrasted with my real-world field of view, causing the letters to appear a bit murky. These visuals aren't meant to wrap around your head in crystal-clear fidelity, but are there for you to perform simple actions, like activating the glasses' camera and glancing at the songs on Spotify. It's more utility than entertainment.</p></div><div><p>The Meta Ray-Ban Display AI glasses with the Meta Neural Band wristband at Meta headquarters in Menlo Park, California, US, on Tuesday, Sept. 16, 2025. </p><p>David Paul Morris | Bloomberg | Getty Images</p></div><div><p>I had the most fun trying to perform hand gestures to navigate the display and open apps. By clenching my fist and swiping my thumb on the surface of my pointer finger, I was able to scroll through the apps like I was using a touchpad.</p><p>It took me several attempts at first to open the camera app through pinching my index finger and thumb together, and when the app wouldn't activate I would find myself pinching twice, mimicking the double clicking of a mouse on a computer. But whereas using a mouse is second nature to me, I learned I have subpar pinching skills that lack the correct cadence and timing required to consistently open the app.</p><p>It was a bit strange and amusing to see people in front of me while I continuously pinched my fingers to interact with the screen. I felt like I was reenacting an <a href=\"https://www.cbc.ca/comedy/between-two-fingers-kids-in-the-hall-look-back-at-creating-headcrusher-1.5690884\" target=\"_blank\">infamous comedy scene</a> from the TV show \"The Kids in The Hall\" in which a misanthrope watches people from afar while pinching his fingers and saying, \"I'm crushing your head, I'm crushing your head!\"</p><p>With the camera app finally opened, the display showed what I was looking at in front of me, giving me a preview of how my photos and videos would turn out. It was like having my own personal picture-in-picture feature like you would on a TV.</p><p>I found myself experiencing some cognitive dissonance at times as my eyes were constantly figuring out what to focus on due to the display always sitting just outside the center of my field of view. If you've ever taken a vision test that involves identifying when you see squiggly lines appearing in your periphery, you have a sense of what I was feeling.</p><p>Besides pinching, the Meta Ray-Ban Display glasses can also be controlled using the Meta AI voice assistant, just as users can with the device's predecessors.</p><div><p>When I took a photo of some of the paintings decorating the demo room's halls, I was told by support staff to ask Meta AI to explain to me what I was looking at. Presumably, Meta AI would have told me I was looking at various paintings from the Bauhaus art movement, but the digital assistant never activated correctly before I was escorted to another part of the demo.</p><p>I could see the Meta Ray-Ban Display's live captions feature being helpful in noisy situations, as it successfully picked up the voice of the demo's tour guide while dance music from the Connect event blared in the background. When he said \"Let's all head to the next room,\" I saw his words appear in the display like closed-captions on a TV show.</p></div><p>But ultimately, I was most drawn to the wristband, particularly when I listened to some music with the glasses via Spotify. By rotating my thumb and index finger as if I was turning an invisible stereo knob, <br />I was able to adjust the volume, an expectedly delightful experience.</p><p>It was this neural wristband that really drilled into my brain how much cutting-edge technology has been crammed into the new Meta Ray-Ban Display glasses. And while the device's high price may turn off consumers, the glasses are novel enough to potentially attract developers seeking more computing platforms to build apps for.</p><p><strong>WATCH</strong>: <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/video/2025/09/18/metas-chief-product-officer-on-its-latest-ai-smart-glasses.html\">Next important wearable tech will be glasses, says Meta's chief product officer</a>.</p></div><div><p><img src=\"https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/108200777-17582096881758209685-41705567207-1080pnbcnews.jpg?v=1758209687&w=750&h=422&vtcrop=y\" alt=\"Meta's chief product officer on its latest AI smart glasses\" /><span></span><span><div><p><span>watch now</span><span></span></p></div></span></p></div></div>"
