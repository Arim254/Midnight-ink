U.S. crude oil prices are currently trading around $65 per barrel, just above the level producers need to drill profitably.</p><p>The shale industry has been \"gutted\" over the course of the Biden and Trump administrations, another executive said.

Energy Secretary Chris Wright has repeatedly argued that the administration is making drilling cheaper by cuting red tape. </p><p>But 57% of executives surveyed by the Dallas Fed said regulatory changes since January have reduced their breakeven costs by less than $1 per barrel.</p><p>Another executive warned that Trump's attacks on the renewable energy industry will come back to haunt the oil and gas sector in a few years. Investors are avoiding energy due to volatility and the \"stroke of pen\" risk that the White House wields over energy projects, the person said.</p><p>\"Life is long, and the sword being wielded against the renewables industry right now will likely boomerang back in 3.5 years against traditional energy,\" they said, warning the industry will face harsher methane penalties, permitting restrictions and environmental reviews when Democrats return to power.</p></div></div>"

The enhanced credits cap out-of-pocket health-care premiums for a wider swath of Obamacare enrollees.</p><p>A funding bill needs 60 votes to be adopted in the Senate, which means it cannot pass on a party-line vote.</p><p>President <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/donald-trump/\">Donald Trump</a> ratcheted up the political brinksmanship this week by canceling a scheduled meeting with the top House and Senate Democrats. And his Office of Management and Budget appeared to raise the stakes further on Wednesday, when it sent a memo warning federal agencies to prepare for <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2025/09/25/trump-government-shutdown-layoffs-omb.html\">mass firings</a> in the event of a shutdown.</p><p>Each side is betting that Americans will blame the other for a shutdown. But regardless of the political dividends, a shutdown will have a major impact on a wide array of services and programs — and it could lead to unprecedented actions by the Trump administration, which has made shrinking the government a top priority.</p><p>Here's what to know:</p></div><h2><a></a>What is a government shutdown?</h2><div><p>Congress has to pass a series of 12 appropriations bills by September 30 to finance government entities for the next fiscal year.</p><p>If it does not, or if it cannot pass a short-term funding measure known as a \"continuing resolution,\" the government shuts down. There have been <a href=\"https://bipartisanpolicy.org/explainer/what-happens-if-the-government-shuts-down/\" target=\"_blank\">14 shutdowns</a> since 1980, according to the Bipartisan Policy Center.</p><p>If Congress can only pass some, but not all, of the annual appropriations bills in time, the government will experience a partial shutdown. That happened in late 2018 during Trump's first presidential term, when the government partially shut down for a record <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2019/01/25/senate-votes-to-reopen-government-and-end-shutdown-without-border-wall.html\">five weeks</a> amid disputes about funding Trump's U.S.-Mexico border wall.</p><p>The current Congress has not passed any of the 12 bills ahead of next week's deadline.</p></div><h2><a></a>How will federal employees be affected?</h2><div><p>Non-essential government employees may be furloughed during a shutdown, meaning they are forced to take an unpaid leave of absence.</p><p>During the last full government shutdown in 2013, about 850,000 employees were furloughed, according to the <a href=\"https://www.crfb.org/papers/government-shutdowns-qa-everything-you-should-know\" target=\"_blank\">Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget.</a></p><p>There are more than two million civilian federal workers in the U.S.</p><p>While furloughed employees are guaranteed back pay once they return to work, federal contractors have historically not received back pay, according to CRFB.</p></div><h2><a></a>What services and agencies will be affected?</h2><div><p>A shutdown will directly affect the non-essential government programs and services that rely on the spending that must be appropriated every year, which is known as discretionary spending.</p><p>In past shutdowns, that has led to the closures of hundreds of national parks and museums, the curtailment of veterans' services, the suspension of health inspections, the postponement of immigration hearings and a slew of other impacts.</p><p>Discretionary spending accounts for 27% of the fiscal 2024 budget, according to the <a href=\"https://www.pgpf.org/article/chart-pack-the-us-budget/\" target=\"_blank\">Peter G. Peterson Foundation</a>.</p><p>Services and programs deemed essential would continue to operate, though they may be affected indirectly. And some federal employees are classified as \"excepted,\" meaning they are still required to work during a shutdown.</p><p>Examples of essential services include those that are related to national security, law enforcement, air traffic control and inmate control.</p><p>Programs funded through \"mandatory\" spending — which is authorized either permanently or for multiple years — broadly continue, though they can still feel the effects of a shutdown.</p><p>For example, in a 1996 shutdown, Social Security checks were still sent out, but staff who handled new enrollments to the program and other services were <a href=\"https://www.crfb.org/papers/government-shutdowns-qa-everything-you-should-know#mandatoryprograms\" target=\"_blank\">initially furloughed</a>.</p></div><h2><a></a>What about economic reports?</h2><div><p>A shutdown could delay the release of key economic reports that are regularly published by the government.</p><p>If no deal is reached, the government will shut down just days before the Bureau of Labor Statistics is set to issue its monthly jobs report for September.</p><p>Wells Fargo economist Michael Pugliese <a href=\"https://wellsfargo.bluematrix.com/docs/html/70538749-ecdc-4d9c-90fb-7acc607da311.html\" target=\"_blank\">noted this week</a> that after the last full government shutdown in 2013, the monthly jobs and consumer price index reports \"were delayed by about two weeks.\"</p><p>\"Collection, processing and publication delays stretched into the following month as well,\" the economist noted.</p><p>The next BLS employment report is set to come out Oct. 3, while the CPI reading for September is due Oct. 15.</p><p>In the partial shutdown that began in late 2018, \"The first look at GDP growth for Q4-2018 was delayed about a month, as was December 2018 data on retail sales and personal income & spending,\" Pugliese wrote.</p><p>— <em>CNBC's </em><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/emily-wilkins/\"><em>Emily Wilkins</em></a><em> contributed to this report.</em></p></div></div>"

Both were 0.1 percentage point above the respective estimates.</p><p>Though the Fed targets inflation at 2%, the readings are unlikely to change course for policymakers who last week indicated they see two more quarter percentage point reductions before the end of the year. </p><p>While the central bank takes in a wide dashboard of data points, it uses PCE as its forecasting measure for inflation as officials believe it provides a wider view than other reports such as the consumer price index, and takes into account changes in consumer spending habits.</p><p>Stock market <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2025/09/25/stock-market-today-live-updates.html\">futures</a> added to gains after the report while Treasury yields edged lower.</p><p>The report further indicates that President <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/donald-trump/\">Donald Trump</a>'s tariffs have had only a limited pass-through effect on consumer prices. Though many economists expected Trump's expansive levies to juice prices, companies have relied on a mixture of pre-tariff inventory accumulations and cost-absorbing measures to limit the impact.</p><p>Goods prices increased 0.1% while services rose 0.3%. Food showed a gain of 0.5% while energy goods and services jumped 0.8%. Housing costs posted a 0.4% rise.</p><p>Moreover, the data showed that consumers have been resilient despite the round of tariffs, continuing to spend strongly as incomes have held up. The personal saving rate also increased on the month, rising to 4.6%, up 0.2 percentage point.</p><p>\"Net, net, consumers literally hit it out of the park with very strong gains in spending not just for August, but June and July as well,\" said Chris Rupkey, chief economist at Fwdbonds. \"Summer was the time for consumer revenge spending after hunkering down in retreat from the shops and malls during the uncertainty and fear produced by the White House tariff rollout in April and May.\"</p><p>Fed officials including Chair <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/jay-powell/\">Jerome Powell</a> say a likely scenario for the tariffs is that they are a one-time boost to prices rather than a longer-term cause of underlying inflation. However, some policymakers have continued to express reservations and see limited room for further rate cuts.</p><p>Markets are strongly betting on a rate cut in October, though there's a bit less enthusiasm for another move in December. The Federal Open Market Committee last week approved a quarter percentage point reduction in the fed funds rate, the first easing of the year that took the benchmark down to a target range of 4%-4.25%.</p></div></div>"

    "body": "<div><div><p>Shelf of pharmaceutical products. </p><p>D3sign | Moment | Getty Images</p></div><div><p>President Donald Trump announced Thursday that the U.S. will impose a 100% tariff on \"any branded or patented Pharmaceutical Product\" entering the country from Oct. 1.</p><p>The measure will not apply to companies building drug manufacturing plants in the U.S., Trump said. He added that the exemption covers projects where construction has started, including sites that have broken ground or are under construction.</p><p>\"There will, therefore, be no Tariff on these Pharmaceutical Products if construction has started,\" Trump said in a post on <a href=\"https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/posts/115267512131958759\" target=\"_blank\">Truth Social</a>.</p><p>Branded or patented pharmaceutical products are drugs sold under trade names and protected by patents or other intellectual property, which block generic competition until those protections expire.</p><p>Trump has said tariffs will incentivize drug companies to move manufacturing operations to the U.S. That is an effort that <span><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/LLY/\">Eli Lilly</a><span><span></span></span></span>, <span><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/JNJ/\">Johnson & Johnson</a><span><span></span></span></span>, <span><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/ABBV/\">AbbVie</a><span><span></span></span></span> and others are already pursuing at a time when domestic drug manufacturing has shrunk dramatically over the last few decades. </p><p>CNBC reached out to major drugmakers for comment on the tariffs but did not receive an immediate response.</p></div><h2><a></a>Risks to the drug supply chain</h2><div><p>In 2024, U.S. imports of pharmaceuticals nearly tripled to around $213 billion from a decade earlier, according to data from the United Nations Comtrade Database.</p><p>The Trump administration in April initiated a so-called Section 232 <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2025/04/16/healthy-returns-drugmakers-comment-on-trumps-pharmaceutical-tariffs.html\">investigation</a> into pharmaceutical products, which allows the Secretary of Commerce to examine the impact of imports on national security. The president similarly used that power to impose tariffs on other goods, such as cars and aluminum. </p><p>The tariffs deal a long-awaited blow to pharmaceutical companies, many of which have <a href=\"https://www.regulations.gov/comment/BIS-2025-0022-0070\" target=\"_blank\">pushed back </a>and warned that the levies could drive up costs, deter <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2025/04/29/pfizer-ceo-trump-tariff-uncertainty-is-deterring-us-investment.html\">investments</a> in the U.S. and disrupt the drug supply chain, ultimately putting patients at risk.</p><p>In <a href=\"https://www.regulations.gov/comment/BIS-2025-0022-0196\" target=\"_blank\">public comments</a> to the government in May, Eli Lilly said tariffs will \"deprive manufacturers of necessary capital to both innovate and invest in reshoring\" since they will redirect capital to cushion the impact of the levies. That was among the hundreds of comments released by the Department of Commerce in late May in relation to its 232 investigation into the pharmaceutical industry.</p><p>Some health policy experts also say the move could disrupt the drug supply chain at the expense of U.S. patients, driving up costs for certain treatments or even exacerbating the medication shortages plaguing the nation. Drugmakers often rely on a global network of manufacturing sites for different steps of the production process. </p><p>There \"is the potential for higher prescription drug prices in an environment where we're already pushing very hard to try to get those prices down,\" Leigh Purvis, prescription drug policy principal in AARP's Public Policy Institute, told CNBC before the tariff announcement.</p><p>She added that there are \"a lot of generic drugs specifically that could potentially have to make decisions between being unprofitable and pulling from the market entirely.\"</p></div><h2><a></a>Tariff storm</h2><div><p>The levies are lower than the up to 250% tariff rate on pharmaceuticals that Trump floated in August in an interview with CNBC's<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2025/08/05/trump-says-pharma-tariffs-could-eventually-reach-up-to-250percent.html\"> \"Squawk Box.\"</a> Trump said he would initially impose a \"small tariff\" on pharmaceuticals, but then in a year to a year and a half \"maximum,\" he will raise that rate to 150% and then 250%.</p><p>The industry is already navigating the fallout from Trump's <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2025/05/12/trump-most-favored-nations-drug-price-order-what-to-know.html\">proposed drug pricing policies</a>, which drugmakers argue threaten both their bottom lines and their capacity to invest in research and development, and a massive overhaul at the Department of Health and Human Services under prominent vaccine skeptic Robert F. Kennedy Jr.</p><p>It's the latest development in Trump's evolving tariff policy, which aims to bring back manufacturing in the U.S.</p><p>The new duties follow the launch of fresh <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2025/09/25/trump-tariff-threat-looms-over-robotics-and-medical-devices-section232-import-investigation.html\">national security investigations</a> announced on Wednesday into imports of robotics, industrial machinery, and medical devices.</p><p>The latest probes by the Department of Commerce expand the list of goods that could face higher tariffs to include personal protective equipment such as surgical masks, N95 respirators, gloves and other medical consumables, including syringes and needles.</p><p>Any new duties resulting from the sector-specific probes would be stacked on top of Trump's country-specific tariffs, though the European Union and Japan have reached agreements that could shield them from extra levies.</p></div><h2><a></a>Shifting manufacturing</h2><div><p>Analysts have raised concerns that it will be difficult to reshore production in the country, which would be costly and could take several years.</p><p>\"Global supply chains are complex, with Pharma among the most–it's not as simple as moving where someone screws in little screws to make an iPhone,\" BMO Capital Markets analyst Evan Seigerman said in a note in April.</p><p>He said the tariffs will \"likely do little to shift manufacturing\" back to the U.S. since companies already have robust operations in the country. </p><p>Seigerman said he expects most large pharmaceutical companies will likely set a goal of \"waiting until the end of Trump's presidency to consider more permanent manufacturing decisions.\"</p><p>J&J in March also <a href=\"https://www.jnj.com/media-center/press-releases/johnson-johnson-increases-u-s-investment-to-more-than-55-billion-over-the-next-four-years\" target=\"_blank\">announced a new $55 billion investment </a>in U.S. manufacturing, research and development and technology over the next four years. </p><p>In April, J&J said it expects to record a $400 million tariff expense in 2025, which reflects already-announced levies and doesn't predict the effects of pharmaceutical-specific tariffs. It is primarily related to the company's medical device products, executives said on an earnings call at the time.</p><p>Other companies, including <span><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/PFE/\">Pfizer</a><span><span></span></span></span>, have <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2025/04/29/pfizer-pfe-earnings-q1-2025.html\">also recorded charges</a> related to the tariffs Trump announced in April.</p><p>J&J CEO Joaquin Duato echoed the warnings of health policy experts.</p><p>\"There's a reason...why pharmaceutical tariffs are zero. It's because tariffs can create disruptions in the supply chain, leading to shortages,\" Duato said during the call. He added that favorable tax policies would be a more effective tool to boost the U.S. manufacturing capacity of both drugs and medical devices.</p><p>Some drugmakers, such as Eli Lilly, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/BMY/\">Bristol Myers Squibb</a> and <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/ABBV/\">AbbVie</a>, may be better positioned than others to weather tariffs because they have more major manufacturing plants in the U.S. than internationally, TD Cowen analyst Steve Scala said in a note in April. The majority of their sites responsible for producing the active ingredients in drugs are also in the U.S., he added. </p><p>Meanwhile, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/NVS/\">Novartis</a> and <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/RHHBF/\">Roche</a> \"look more at risk\" because they have few U.S. plants and a higher share of active ingredient sites that are international, Scala said.</p></div></div>"

Disney had temporarily <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2025/09/17/charlie-kirk-jimmy-kimmel-abc-disney.html\">suspended</a> the late night show following comments Kimmel made about the alleged murder of conservative activist Charlie Kirk and President Donald Trump's MAGA movement.</p><p>\"Our objective throughout this process has been to ensure that programming remains accurate and engaging for the widest possible audience. We take seriously our responsibility as local broadcasters to provide programming that serves the interests of our communities, while also honoring our obligations to air national network programming,\" Sinclair said in a statement on Friday.</p><p>\"Over the last week, we have received thoughtful feedback from viewers, advertisers, and community leaders representing a wide range of perspectives,\" Sinclair said. \"We have also witnessed troubling acts of violence, including the despicable incident of a shooting at an ABC affiliate station in Sacramento.

While we understand that not everyone will agree with our decisions about programming, it is simply inconsistent to champion free speech while demanding that broadcasters air specific content.\"</p><p>Earlier this week, Sen.
