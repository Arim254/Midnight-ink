    "body": "<div><div><p>Despite the prevalence of cervical cancer diagnoses and deaths in the United States, <a href=\"https://aacrjournals.org/cebp/article-abstract/34/6/836/762621/Prevalence-and-Review-of-Major-Modifiable-Cancer?redirectedFrom=fulltext\" target=\"_blank\">data</a> shows that screening for the cancer is on a consistent decline.</p><p>Each year in the U.S., around 4,000 women die from cervical cancer, and about 13,000 are diagnosed with the disease, according to the <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/cervical-cancer/statistics/index.html\" target=\"_blank\">Centers for Disease Control and Prevention</a>.</p><p>The most effective way to prevent cervical cancer is receiving the HPV vaccine, which offers protection against the HPV types that most frequently cause it, the <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/cervical-cancer/prevention/index.html\" target=\"_blank\">CDC states</a>. It's also important for women to get screened for the disease.</p><p>One common test for cervical cancer detection is a Pap smear, which doctors recommend once every three years for women between the ages of 21 and 65. Women ages 30 to 65 can also receive an HPV test and a Pap test every five years, or get tested for HPV alone every five years.</p><p>But, a recent report from the American Cancer Society shows that the <a href=\"https://www.cancer.org/research/acs-research-news/not-enough-females-are-being-screened-for-cervical-cancer.html\" target=\"_blank\">rate of cervical cancer screenings fell</a> during the Covid-19 pandemic, and haven't recovered.</p><p><a href=\"https://www.getteal.com/people/kara-egan\" target=\"_blank\">Kara Egan</a>, a health tech investor, saw a need for making Pap smears more accessible. She co-founded Teal Health, a healthcare company that created the <a href=\"https://www.getteal.com/teal-wand\" target=\"_blank\">Teal Wand</a>, the first FDA-approved cervical screening test that can be done at home.</p><p>\"What drove me to start Teal is just that women deserve better healthcare,\" says Egan, who is also the company's CEO.</p><p>\"And what does better look like? It looks like listening to a woman and seeing what she needs.\"</p></div><h2><a></a>'Even if the visit's free, you had to leave work, you had to get childcare'</h2><div><p>For Egan and her team, accessibility was a huge focus when creating the concept for the Teal Wand.</p><p>\"It's like, 'What are all of the touch points that we can do to make something easier for a woman, but to also build that trust with her, that she matters and that we care?\" Egan tells CNBC Make It.</p><p>\"I think a lot of them can be done in ways that you wouldn't expect or that healthcare doesn't do.\"</p><p>Before receiving a Teal Wand, customers must go through the screening process with a doctor who helps them determine their eligibility based on their insurance coverage, and teaches them how to properly use the wand to get an accurate sample.</p><p>\"We're doing the exact same test that's used in the doctor's office with the same accuracy, that's what our clinical trials show, but just you're collecting the sample at home,\" Egan explains.</p></div><div><p>The Teal Wand is the first FDA-approved cervical screening test that can be done at home.</p><p>Courtesy of Teal Health.</p></div><div><p>Once the sample is collected and tested, the results are shared via the company's online portal, and patients can connect to a medical provider<strong> </strong>via a tele-health visit to talk through next steps if a follow-up is needed.</p><p>What's unique about the process is that everything, from the screening process to the collection and receiving results is done from home. Egan says, that is by design, to make the process easier for people who struggle to get to in-person doctor's visits.</p><p>\"Cost is important, and it's critically important to us, [but] that's not the main barrier a lot of times for people,\" she says.</p><p>\"There's also the cost of going into the doctor's office. Even if the visit's free, you had to leave work, you had to get childcare, you had to [find] transportation.\"</p></div><h2><a></a>'Over 50% of women getting screened with Teal have been behind on their screening'</h2><div><p>The Teal Wand is now available in California, New York and Florida. Teal Health is in network with Cigna, Blue Cross Blue Shield, Aetna, Anthem Blue Cross and United Healthcare.</p><p>\"We're able to take [care of] the telehealth portion, and then a woman pays $99. But we are working with insurers to get the full thing covered,\" Egan says.</p><p>\"Even with a $99 charge, we're seeing over 50% of women who are getting screened with Teal have been behind on their screening, and 20% of them had never been screened before, and were well within screening age.\"</p><p>The driving factor for founding Teal Health for Egan and her team was to spread awareness of the importance of cervical cancer screening, and to offer a new option for testing, Egan notes.</p><p>\"Cervical cancer is entirely preventable if you get screened,\" she says. \"There are new ways to do it. One is in the office and one is at home, but they're highly accurate, and you should be doing it.\"</p><p><em><strong>Last chance to save: Want to be your own boss?</strong> Final days to get 30% off Smarter by CNBC Make It's new online course, </em><a href=\"https://smarter.cnbcmakeit.com/p/how-to-start-a-business-for-first-time-founders?utm_source=cnbc&utm_medium=makeitarticle&utm_campaign=bottom\" target=\"_blank\"><em>How To Start A Business: For First-Time Founders</em></a><em>.

    "body": "<div><div><p>Markeiz Ryan, 36, had a pretty good childhood growing up in Maryland, but the 2008 financial crisis changed things.</p><p>\"It wiped my mother's job away and it really made things tough for us around the time I graduated high school,\" Ryan tells CNBC Make It. \"I didn't have much of a financial security blanket to fall under. The best thing for me was to join the military so I wouldn't have to put my family into any more debt and I think that was the right decision.\"</p><p>Ryan joined the U.S. Air Force in 2010 and was stationed in various countries around the world, including Korea, Germany, and throughout Africa. In 2016, while living in Korea, Ryan got in trouble for breaking his curfew. He lost out on several months of pay, was restricted to his military base and demoted from staff sergeant to senior airman.</p><p>\"After this, I was very depressed and very sad,\" Ryan said. \"But that depression and sadness make you think about where your life is going and it makes you redirect your life into the right direction.\"</p></div><div><p>In Vietnam, Ryan lives off of roughly $4,000 a month.</p><p>Louis Corallo for CNBC Make It</p></div><div><p>In that period of time that Ryan was restricted to his military base, he planned a trip to visit a friend in Vietnam.</p><p>\"It just looked like so much fun and it really lived up to all the hype,\" he said. \"I ended up having the best time of my life, and that depression was [just] gone.\"</p><p>Ryan says that after that first trip to Vietnam and seeing how happy he was, he didn't want to let go of that feeling. He started planning his return to the country.</p><p>The veteran returned to his life in the Air Force and completed his service on a military base in Wyoming before being honorably discharged in 2019.</p></div><div><p>Ryan lives in a two-bedroom apartment in Ho Chi Minh City.</p><p>Louis Corallo for CNBC Make It</p></div><div><p>Soon after, Ryan relocated to Vietnam, where he lives off roughly $4,000 a month, according to documents reviewed by CNBC Make It.</p><p>Ryan suffers from spine arthritis, respiratory issues, auditory pain, and mental health challenges from his time in the military. He receives disability from Veterans Affairs.</p><p>His monthly income stems from several sources, including approximately $1,500 from VA disability, $1,000 from the GI Bill while he's pursuing a master's degree, and $900 to $1,300 from teaching English. Ryan also does occasional odd jobs like voiceover work, where his pay can range from $200 to $600 a month, and is an avid fan of day trading, where he averages about $300 a month.</p><p>\"This might not sound like a lot in America but trust me, this is more than enough to be middle or even above middle class in Vietnam,\" he says.</p></div><div><p>When Ryan moved to Vietnam, he bought a motorcycle to get around</p><p>Louis Corallo for CNBC Make It</p></div><div><p>Ryan lives in Ho Chi Minh City and has a two-bedroom, one-bathroom apartment in one of the country's tallest residential towers. He pays $850 a month in rent and his utilities round up to about $130, which includes electricity, water and housekeeping.</p><p>In addition to those expenses, Ryan also pays $1,000 a year for health insurance and $3 a week on gas for his motorcycle. What he spends on groceries varies from $100 to $400 a month, as he often alternates between cooking his own food or dining out frequently.</p><p>\"Vietnam is the number one safest place I've ever lived. I never have to look over my shoulder here. I noticed that there's this great level of calm,\" Ryan says. \"People are more focused on their day-to-day life and they're less focused on what's going on politically. It's a much more calm feeling.\"</p><p>Although Ryan loves living in Vietnam, one thing that irks him is the noise pollution.</p><p>\"There's a lot of honking, street sellers and sometimes karaoke really loudly, so if you are very intolerant to noise, this might not be the place for you,\" he says.</p></div><div><p>Ryan says Vietnam is now home and he has no plans of leaving.</p><p>Louis Corallo for CNBC Make It</p></div><div><p>Since moving to Vietnam, Ryan has made an effort to learn the language, but he admits he's still not the best at it.</p><p>\"I can never claim that I'm fluent in Vietnamese, but I do a lot better than most of my peers here,\" he says.</p><p>Ryan has been living in Vietnam for six years now, and says he has no plans of leaving.</p><p>\"If I leave, it's because Vietnam told me to leave. In America, I felt very unmotivated. I felt like no matter how hard you work, you're still in poverty. You're constantly chasing a standard that you can't really achieve,\" he says. \"Here in Vietnam, it takes a lot of the monetary pressure out of your day-to-day. You focus on what makes you happy, who you want to become and how you're going to get there.\"</p><p>This experience, he says, is the complete opposite of what his life was like back in the U.S.</p><p>\"Every day I wake up with a long to-do list of things I want to do, not the things that I need to do, and it's a completely different way of living. Even if you need to work 40 hours a week here, you're doing it as an investment in your future.

    "body": "<div><div><p>You may be familiar with the \"fight, flight, or <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2025/06/14/10-signs-youre-in-a-functional-freezeand-the-no-1-way-out-of-it.html\">freeze</a>\" survival responses. </p><p>But there's another \"F\" word:<a href=\"https://pete-walker.com/fourFs_TraumaTypologyComplexPTSD.htm\" target=\"_blank\"> the fawn response</a>, which is perhaps less recognized, but is the one I most commonly see as a psychotherapist, and one that I have experienced in my own life. </p><p>Fawning is about appeasing a threat, either real or perceived, and satisfying it. When we're in a fawn response, we move toward the threat instead of away from it. This people pleasing behavior can make you feel <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2025/03/14/if-you-answer-yes-to-these-questions-you-may-come-across-as-insecure.html\">insecure</a> when you have absolutely no reason to be.</p><p>Here's how to look out for the fawn response, and how to handle it. </p></div><h2><a></a>Where the fawn response comes from</h2><div><p>While there are many circumstances that feed the need to fawn, the thread is the same: \"I can't feel safe until everyone is happy with me.\"</p><p>When the body detects some sort of threat, whether it is real (a lion chasing you) or perceived (your boss being a little standoffish), it can feel the same to the nervous system. </p><p>Maybe you grew up in a home where you had to hold your breath and monitor a parent's moods because things could flip in an instant. Or maybe you had a highly critical parent, and being \"perfect\" was your way of staying ahead of criticism. I can certainly relate. </p><p>A prime example of the fawn response is the instinct you might have to ask someone, \"Are you mad at me?\" </p><p><em><strong>DON'T MISS</strong></em><a href=\"https://smarter.cnbcmakeit.com/p/how-to-start-a-business-for-first-time-founders?utm_source=cnbc&utm_medium=makeitarticle&utm_campaign=body\" target=\"_blank\"><em><strong>:</strong> <strong>The ultimate guide to starting a business—everything you need to know to be your own boss</strong></em></a> </p></div><h2><a></a>What the fawn response actually looks like</h2><div><p>To be clear, fawning isn't a bad thing. It's an automatic survival mechanism, and sometimes we need to fawn, whether it's to get a paycheck or to ensure immediate safety. </p><p>But in order to hyper-attune to other people's moods, reactions, and perceptions, we often disconnect from and neglect ourselves. Here are some common fawn response behaviors to watch out for:</p><ul><li>Constantly overthinking social interactions.</li><li>Not being able to say no or set boundaries, and then feeling resentful.</li><li>Feeling terrified of conflict or of people thinking you disagree with them.</li><li>Morphing yourself into a \"chameleon\" in relationships.</li><li>Fearing that you're about to get in trouble.</li><li>Being drawn to people who are emotionally unavailable, critical, or hard to please, because they feel like \"home.\"</li><li>Feeling like you don't know who you are anymore because you've silenced your own opinions.</li></ul><p>All of this adds up to seeming and feeling insecure. If these patterns resonate, I imagine that at some point they were genuinely helpful and protective. So the body thinks: <em>Hey, this works, let's keep doing it.</em> What feels familiar will always feel safe, even if it no longer serves us. </p></div><h2><a></a>How to break out of a fawn response cycle </h2><div><p>The fawn response is an unconscious pattern, so noticing it and bringing it into the forefront of your mind is the first step. Here are a few practices I like to recommend to my patients. </p><ol><li><strong>Pause. </strong>Before you go to over-apologize, shrink yourself, shove your needs down, get lost in an overthinking spiral — pause. Check in with yourself. Ask \"What do I need right now? What do I think of this? What am I feeling?\" It's great to care about others, but not if you abandon your needs in the process.</li><li><strong>Lean back. </strong>Let's say your parent sends you a text while you're in the middle of something, and your immediate instinct is to respond so you won't disappoint them. Instead, finish what you were doing and respond when you're free. This is all about releasing urgency where it's not necessary or helpful. By slowing down, we're communicating to our bodies that we're safe.</li><li><strong>Look inward. </strong>Practice expressing your needs in relationships that feel safest to you, in everyday ways. For example, when your partner asks what you want for dinner, instead of saying, \"Whatever you want!\" take a moment to ask yourself: \"What do I actually want?\" Can you allow yourself to express it? And then don't be afraid to do so. </li></ol><p>When we've been conditioned to believe that we aren't allowed to have needs, that we're responsible for managing other people's emotions, boundaries may be hard for us to set. Many of us may fear that if we set boundaries, we'll be seen as cold or mean. But I like to think of boundaries as a way to strengthen the relationships we really want in our lives. </p><p><a href=\"https://megjosephson.com/\" target=\"_blank\"><em><strong>Meg Josephson</strong></em></a><em> is a licensed psychotherapist and the author of the bestselling book, </em><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Are-You-Mad-Me-Focusing-ebook/dp/B0DQLMS9VG\" target=\"_blank\"><em>\"Are You Mad at Me?: How to Stop Focusing on What Others Think So You Can Start Living for You</em></a><em>.\"</em></p><p><em><strong>Last chance to save: Want to be your own boss?</strong> Final days to get 30% off Smarter by CNBC Make It's new online course, </em><a href=\"https://smarter.cnbcmakeit.com/p/how-to-start-a-business-for-first-time-founders?utm_source=cnbc&utm_medium=makeitarticle&utm_campaign=bottom\" target=\"_blank\"><em>How To Start A Business: For First-Time Founders</em></a><em>.

The credits reduce the costs of health insurance premiums for a wider swath of Obamacare enrollees.</p><p>A funding bill requires 60 votes to be adopted in the Senate, which means it cannot pass if only the 53 Republicans in that chamber vote for it.</p><p>President <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/donald-trump/\">Donald Trump</a> ratcheted up the political brinksmanship this week by <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2025/09/23/trump-democrats-shutdown-schumer-jeffries.html\">canceling a scheduled meeting</a> with Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer and House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, the New Yorkers who head the Democratic caucuses in their chambers.</p><p>Trump's Office of Management and Budget raised the human stakes further on Wednesday, when it issued a memo warning federal agencies to prepare for <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2025/09/25/trump-government-shutdown-layoffs-omb.html\">mass firings</a> in the event of a shutdown.</p><p>Each side is betting that Americans will blame the other for a shutdown. But regardless of the political dividends, a shutdown will have a major impact on a wide array of services and programs.</p><p>And it could lead to unprecedented actions by the Trump administration, which has made shrinking the government a top priority.</p></div><h2><a></a>What is a government shutdown?</h2><div><p>Congress has to pass a series of 12 appropriations bills by Tuesday to finance government entities for the next fiscal year. But it has not passed any of the 12 bills ahead of that deadline.</p><p>If it cannot pass a short-term funding measure known as a \"continuing resolution,\" the government will shut down.</p><p>There have been <a href=\"https://bipartisanpolicy.org/explainer/what-happens-if-the-government-shuts-down/\" target=\"_blank\">14 such shutdowns</a> since 1980, according to the Bipartisan Policy Center.</p><p>If Congress can only pass some, but not all, of the annual appropriations bills in time, the government will experience a partial shutdown. </p><p>That happened in late 2018 — during Trump's first presidential term — when the government partially shut down for a record <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2019/01/25/senate-votes-to-reopen-government-and-end-shutdown-without-border-wall.html\">five weeks</a> amid disputes about the funding for Trump's U.S.-Mexico border wall.</p></div><h2><a></a>How will federal employees be affected?</h2><div><p>Non-essential government employees may be furloughed during a shutdown, meaning they are forced to take an unpaid leave of absence.</p><p>During the last full government shutdown in 2013, about 850,000 employees were furloughed, according to the <a href=\"https://www.crfb.org/papers/government-shutdowns-qa-everything-you-should-know\" target=\"_blank\">Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget.</a></p><p>There are more than two million civilian federal workers in the U.S.</p><p>While furloughed employees are guaranteed back pay once they return to work, federal contractors have historically not received back pay, according to CRFB.</p></div><h2><a></a>What services and agencies will be affected?</h2><div><p>A shutdown will directly affect non-essential government programs and services that rely on the spending that must be appropriated every year, known as discretionary spending.</p><p>In past shutdowns, that has led to the closures of hundreds of national parks and museums, the curtailment of veterans' services, suspension of health inspections, the postponement of immigration hearings and many other impacts.</p><p>Discretionary spending accounts for 27% of the fiscal 2024 budget, according to the <a href=\"https://www.pgpf.org/article/chart-pack-the-us-budget/\" target=\"_blank\">Peter G. Peterson Foundation</a>.</p><p>Services and programs deemed essential would continue to operate, but they may be indirectly affected. And some federal employees are classified as \"excepted,\" meaning they are still required to work during a shutdown.</p><p>Examples of essential services include those that are related to national security, law enforcement, air traffic control, and prison inmate control.</p><p>Programs funded through \"mandatory\" spending — which is authorized either permanently or for multiple years — would broadly continue, though they can still feel the effects of a shutdown.</p><p>In a 1996 shutdown, Social Security checks were still sent out. But Social Security Administration staff who handled new enrollments to the program and other services were <a href=\"https://www.crfb.org/papers/government-shutdowns-qa-everything-you-should-know#mandatoryprograms\" target=\"_blank\">initially furloughed</a>.</p></div><h2><a></a>What about economic reports?</h2><div><p>A shutdown could delay the release of key economic reports that the government regularly publishes, which are closely watched by financial markets.</p><p>If no deal is reached, the government will shut down just days before the Bureau of Labor Statistics is set to issue its monthly jobs report for September.</p><p>Wells Fargo economist Michael Pugliese <a href=\"https://wellsfargo.bluematrix.com/docs/html/70538749-ecdc-4d9c-90fb-7acc607da311.html\" target=\"_blank\">noted this week</a> that after the last full government shutdown in 2013, the monthly jobs and consumer price index reports \"were delayed by about two weeks.\"</p><p>\"Collection, processing and publication delays stretched into the following month as well,\" Pugliese noted.</p><p>The next BLS employment report is set to be released on Oct. 3. The BLS's Consumer Price Index reading for September is scheduled to be released on Oct. 15.</p><p>In the partial shutdown that began in late 2018, Pugliese noted, \"the first look at\" gross domestic product growth for the fourth quarter of that year \"was delayed about a month, as was December 2018 data on retail sales and personal income & spending.\"</p><p>— <em>CNBC's </em><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/emily-wilkins/\"><em>Emily Wilkins</em></a><em> contributed to this story.</em></p></div></div>"

They were rebuked for the move.</p><p>In a statement on Friday, the committee said that the batch included 8,544 documents in response to a subpoena in August, and that, \"Further review of the documents, which were redacted to protect the identity of victims, is ongoing.\" </p><p>The latest batch of documents received by the committee from the Justice Department contained itineraries and notes by Epstein memorializing invitations he'd sent, trips he'd planned and meetings he'd booked with tech and business leaders.</p></div><div><p>Demonstrators gather for a press conference calling for the release of the Jeffrey Epstein files outside the United States Captiol on Wednesday September 03, 2025 in Washington, DC. </p><p>The Washington Post | The Washington Post | Getty Images</p></div><div><p>One of the itineraries indicated that Epstein expected Musk to make a trip to his private island in the U.S. Virgin Islands on Dec. 6, 2014, but then asked \"is this still happening?\"</p><p>Musk told Vanity Fair in 2019 that he had visited Epstein's New York City mansion and that Epstein \"tried repeatedly to get me to visit his island,\" but the <span><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/TSLA/\">Tesla</a><span><span></span></span></span> CEO had declined.</p><p>In June, Musk wrote in a post on X, that he thought Trump and his administration were withholding Epstein-related files from the public view in order to protect the president's reputation.</p><p>\"Time to drop the really big bomb: @realDonaldTrump is in the Epstein files,\" Musk, who was in the midst of a public spat with the president, wrote at the time. \"That is the real reason they have not been made public.

    "body": "<div><div><p>Utah-based drink chain Swig coined \"dirty soda\" back in 2010. Fifteen years later, the trend is fueling innovation everywhere from <span><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/PEP/\">PepsiCo</a><span><span></span></span></span> to <span><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/MCD/\">McDonald's</a><span><span></span></span></span>, infusing the sluggish beverage category with new life.</p><p>\"Dirty soda\" drinks use pop as a base, followed by flavored syrups, cream or other ingredients. While Swig claims credit — and the trademark — for dirty soda, TikTok videos and the reality TV show \"The Secret Lives of Mormon Wives\" have helped the trend spread far and wide, outpacing even the soda chain's speedy expansion.</p><p>Now, consumers can find it nearly everywhere, from grocery store aisles to fast-food chains.</p><p>In a few weeks, Pepsi plans to unveil two ready-to-drink dirty soda-inspired beverages at the National Association of Convenience Stores trade show in Chicago. The new drinks, the Dirty Dew and the Mug Floats Vanilla Howler, follow on the heels of the Pepsi Wild Cherry & Cream flavor, which hit shelves earlier this year.</p><p>\"I think it's a great opportunity for people like us, like PepsiCo, and for consumers to experience soda in a new way — and in some ways, an old way,\" Pepsi Beverages North America Chief Marketing Officer Mark Kirkham told CNBC, comparing the rise of dirty soda to root beer floats and the soda shops of yore.</p></div><div><p>PepsiCo's lineup of dirty soda-inspired drinks includes Pepsi Wild Cherry & Cream, Dirty Mountain Dew and Mug Floats Vanilla Howler.</p><p>Source: PepsiCo</p></div><div><p>Dirty soda has also drawn new interest beyond beverage players. According to Datassential, 2.7% of U.S. eateries offer a carbonated soft drink that includes cream or milk, up from 1.5% a decade ago.</p><p>Newcomers to the trend include TGI Fridays, which launched dirty soda as a limited-time menu item this summer that could be spiked with alcohol. McDonald's is <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2025/07/24/mcdonalds-tests-cosmcs-drinks.html\">testing flavored sodas</a>, like a \"Sprite Lunar Splash,\" at more than 500 locations after winding down its drinks-focused spinoff CosMc's in June. <span><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/YUM/\">Yum Brands'</a><span><span></span></span></span> Taco Bell has also been offering limited-time menu items, like a dirty Mountain Dew Baja Blast.</p></div><h2><a></a>Swig sets a trend</h2><div><p>These days, Swig has grown to more than 140 locations across 16 states. So far this year, its same-store sales have risen 8.2%, according to the privately held company. The Larry H. Miller Company, an investment firm founded by the former Utah Jazz owner, bought a majority stake in Swig in 2022 for an undisclosed sum.</p><p>\"I think we're doing for soda what Starbucks did for coffee,\" Swig CEO Alex Dunn said.</p><p>As Swig has grown, so have the number of chains looking to emulate its success. Rival soda shops like Sodalicious, Fiiz and Cool Sips are also benefiting from the trend. Coffee shops, like <span><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/BROS/\">Dutch Bros.</a><span><span></span></span></span>, have also added it to their menus. And now fast-food chains are hopping on the bandwagon.</p><p>\"It validates that this is a category, and McDonald's and Taco Bell wouldn't be getting into it if it wasn't something that had broad appeal that they could sell everywhere, in thousands of locations,\" Dunn said. \"It's kind of flattering that we created a category that now everybody is copying.\"</p><p>For restaurants, adding dirty soda to the menu is easier than it might sound.</p><p>\"It's a custom drink offering that, one, allows the brands to leverage something that they already have right there: their soda machine,\" said Erica Holland-Toll, culinary director at The Culinary Edge, which advises restaurants on food and beverage innovation. \"Two, it incorporates either a one-touch ingredient, or if they're already open for breakfast, it's quite likely that they've got a creamer in house.\"</p><p>On the other hand, offering customizable coffee drinks is usually much more difficult — which has contributed to the struggles at Starbucks.</p><p>\"The espresso world — that's so much more complicated,\" Holland-Toll said.</p><p>Dirty soda also has wide appeal. With less caffeine than coffee, consumers can drink it all day long. Plus, it's \"much more accessible\" than some coffee house trends, like an espresso tonic, according to Holland-Toll. The bright colors of many dirty sodas also make them more attractive to consumers, who were likely introduced to the trend via a TikTok video.</p><p>But perhaps above all, dirty soda can help restaurants draw in customers who are otherwise feeling thrifty.</p><p>\"It's an affordable fun treat. You're not going out and spending $30 or $50, right?\" said Sally Lyons Watt, chief advisor of consumer goods and foodservice insights for Circana. \"It's something that people can walk away saying, 'Wow, that was yummy' or 'I feel better because I just had that.'\"</p></div><h2><a></a>A pop for beverage companies</h2><div><p>Swig drinks.</p><p>Courtesy: Swig</p></div><div><p>A \"fun treat\" for consumers is adding up for beverage companies, helping reverse the decades-long trend of declining soda consumption in the U.S.</p><p>As health concerns mount and the array of beverage options expands, Americans have been drinking less soda for roughly two decades. In 2004, soda consumption peaked at 15.3 billion gallons, according to Beverage Marketing; by 2024, that figure had slid to 11.87 billion gallons. But consumption of carbonated soft drinks has been ticking up in the last two years, with 2025 estimated to reach 11.88 billion gallons. The rise of dirty soda, plus the growing popularity of prebiotic sodas, has likely helped the segment halt its downward trajectory.</p></div><div><p>Over the years, iced coffee has been stealing what the beverage industry calls \"share of throat\" from soda. With dirty soda, consumers can marry their love of customizing a cold drink with the lower caffeine content and taste of soda.</p><p>\"The carbonation makes it feel lighter in your mouth than coffee, for example,\" Holland-Toll said.</p><p>Dirty soda has also been attracting younger consumers who previously didn't drink much Pepsi or Dr Pepper. Swig's core customer base is young women between the ages of 18 and 35, according to Dunn.</p><p>That's true for Holly Galvin, a 31-year-old human resources professional based in Davenport, Iowa. She told CNBC that she rarely drank soda — until she saw dirty soda take the spotlight in the \"The Secret Lives of Mormon Wives\" last year. Now she makes her own dirty soda once or twice a week at home. With the onset of autumn, her go-to recipe these days uses Diet Dr Pepper as a base, with pumpkin spice creamer and a sprinkle of pumpkin pie spice on top.</p><p>Broadly, younger consumers are more inclined to seek out new drinks compared with older cohorts. Nearly three-quarters of Generation Z try a new beverage every month on average, according to Keurig Dr Pepper's 2025 trend report.</p><p>Beverage companies say that they are seeing a broader halo effect for soda as a result of the trend.</p><p>\"For us, it serves as a recruitment tool, bringing new users into the trademark,\" said Katie Webb, vice president of innovation and transformation for <span><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/KDP/\">Keurig Dr Pepper</a><span><span></span></span></span>. \"It really draws them all the way back to the base brand, which ends up being extremely impact for us long after.\"</p><p>And just as craft cocktail culture led to the rise of canned cocktails, the popularity of dirty soda is leading beverage giants to cash in with ready-to-drink versions that capitalize on the trend. Dr Pepper Creamy Coconut was the company's most successful limited-time carbonated soft drink to date, based on retail dollar sales, according to Webb. And Kirkham said Pepsi Wild Cherry & Cream has been one of the fastest-growing flavor segments for the company.</p><p>\"Some trends start retail and move over to foodservice,\" Circana's Lyons Wyatt said. \"This one was a foodservice trend moving into retail.\"</p><p>With Pepsi Wild Cherry & Cream and next year's launch of Dirty Dew and the Mug Floats Vanilla Howler, Kirkham expects that consumers will become even more creative with their concoctions.</p><p>\"I think it's actually giving [consumers] the chance to experiment even more and customize more,\" he said. \"Now you have a brand new base.\"</p></div></div>"

This so-called \"silver tsunami\" poses a major challenge for Asia's fourth-largest economy as the young, working-age population declines and the cost of caring for the elderly escalates. And in remote, rural communities like Gunwi, which lies some 200 kilometers southeast of Seoul, the trend is exacerbated by a youth exodus to the cities for work.</p><p>Ed Jones | Afp | Getty Images</p></div><div><p>South Korea is staring down a demographic freight train. The country, known as one of the \"Four Asian Tigers\" for its meteoric economic rise from postwar poverty, is confronting a demographic cliff that could stall growth within two decades, studies warn.</p><p>The Bank of Korea in 2024 <a href=\"https://www.bok.or.kr/eng/bbs/B0000354/view.do?menuNo=400409&nttId=10090724\" target=\"_blank\">projected</a> that the nation's rock-bottom birth rate will be one of the factors that will push it into a prolonged downturn by the 2040s.</p><p>A <a href=\"https://www.kdi.re.kr/eng/research/analysisView?art_no=3671\" target=\"_blank\">separate study</a> by the Korea Development Institute in May said demographic shifts will keep dragging on potential growth, which could fall to near zero by the 2040s. In its projections, South Korea's economy could contract by 2047 in a neutral scenario — or as early as 2041 in a pessimistic one.</p><p>South Korea's <a href=\"https://kosis.kr/statHtml/statHtml.do?sso=ok&returnurl=https%3A%2F%2Fkosis.kr%3A443%2FstatHtml%2FstatHtml.do%3Fconn_path%3DI3%26tblId%3DDT_1B81A21%26language%3Den%26orgId%3D101%26\" target=\"_blank\">birth rate currently stands at 0.748 in 2024</a>, a slight rise from the record low of 0.721 in 2023. That compares with an Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development average of <a href=\"https://www.oecd.org/en/publications/korea-s-unborn-future_75aa749c-en.html\" target=\"_blank\">1.43 in 2023</a>. The commonly cited \"replacement rate\" for countries to prevent a declining population is 2.1.</p><p>What a 0.72 fertility rate means for South Korea is that for every 100 Koreans, they would have about 36 children at current levels, shrinking the workforce across generations. That would cut into productivity and slow growth, experts say.</p></div><h2><a></a>Miracle for 'miracle on the Han River'?</h2><div><p>If technological innovation fails to offset this decline, Korea will see a \"sustained economic slowdown,\" Lee In-sil, Director of the Korea Peninsula Population Institute for Future, told CNBC.</p><p>And it's not for lack of trying. The country has rolled out package after package of support measures for newlyweds to have children, including baby bonuses and cash rewards. Seoul expended over $270 billion over the past 16 years on incentives to promote childbirth, according to a <a href=\"https://jme.bmj.com/content/51/6/371\" target=\"_blank\">2024 paper in the Journal of Medical Ethics</a>.</p><p>In 2023, Seoul even mooted an idea to <a href=\"https://time.com/6265842/south-korea-birth-rate-military-service-exemption/\" target=\"_blank\">exempt men from its mandatory military service</a> if they had three or more children before the age of 30.</p><p>But such efforts have made little impact in a country hailed as the \"Miracle on the Han River\" for its rapid postwar rise. \"I don't think there's any way that population policy can effectively raise fertility levels in South Korea in any appreciable way,\" Nicholas Eberstadt, a political economist at the American Enterprise Institute, told CNBC.</p></div><div><p>People cycle along a track backdropped with the city skyline in Singapore on June 27, 2025.         </p><p>Roslan Rahman | Afp | Getty Images</p></div><p>While South Korea's total fertility rate had marginally increased in 2024, \"we should not be popping the champagne corks,\" Eberstadt said, as it is still far below the 2.1 replacement rate. He noted that the desired family size in South Korea is still below the 2.1 replacement rate, which means that while the TFR might climb higher, it will not reach the 2.1 figure.</p><h2><a></a>Pension impact</h2><div><p>A shrinking workforce will also squeeze the pension system. In March, South Korea passed its first <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/south-korea-approves-reforms-shore-up-830-bln-state-pension-fund-2025-03-20/\" target=\"_blank\">pension fund reform</a> in 18 years, extending the depletion of the state pension fund by 15 years to 2071.</p><p>Among South Korea's four major pension systems — military, private school employees, civil servants, and national pensions — the military pension and civil servants' pension have already been depleted, Lee said.</p><p>Current reforms will see a structure where younger generations pay higher premiums while receiving lower benefits, which will inevitably lead to criticism for transferring the burden to future generations, she added.</p><p>A smaller draft pool also has defense implications. South Korea's active troops <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/south-koreas-military-has-shrunk-by-20-six-years-male-population-drops-2025-08-10/#:~:text=SEOUL%2C%20Aug%2010%20(Reuters),a%20report%20said%20on%20Sunday.\" target=\"_blank\">have fallen 20%</a> to about 450,000, down from 690,000 in 2019. South Korean armed forces are augmented by 28,500 U.S. troops, and Seoul has a mutual defense treaty with Washington.</p><p>South Korea is still formally at war with North Korea, as the Korean War in 1953 ended with a ceasefire, not a peace treaty. North Korea boasts one of the largest standing military forces in the world, with around 1.23 million personnel.</p></div><h2><a></a>No reason to be pessimistic</h2><div><p>Despite the bleak outlook for Asia's fourth-largest economy, some analysts caution against despair.</p><p>Lee, who was also the former director general of the national statistics agency, said economies can find ways to adapt.</p><p>\"When an economy faces recession, it typically responds with various efforts to enhance productivity through technological innovation, immigration policies, and other measures to prevent further decline,\" she said.</p><p>AEI's Eberstadt also noted that South Korea can maintain and even increase its prosperity despite aging and shrinking. He pointed to the 1970s, when fears of resource scarcity grew as the world's population surged and doubts arose about how to feed it.</p><p>In 1968, the book The Population Bomb, co-authored by former Stanford University professor Paul Ehrlich and researcher Anne Ehrlich, predicted global famine and a rising death rate as the population grew.</p><p>However, 50 years later, the world is \"richer, better educated, better fed, better housed, more prosperous, much less absolute poverty, than when the world was smaller,\" Eberstadt said.</p><p>KPPIF's Lee said that, considering the Korean government's rapid policy changes and evolving public awareness in recent years, she is confident that breakthrough solutions will emerge.</p><p>Very few people would have bet that South Korea could accomplish what it has today when the Korean War halted in 1953, Eberstadt said<strong>.</strong></p><p>\"Human beings are a uniquely adaptable,\" he added. \"This is a very different sort of challenge, but I don't think that the record of the immediate past suggests that it's smart money to bet against South Korean population.\"</p></div></div>"

The National Transportation Safety Board and other safety experts have <a href=\"https://www.ntsb.gov/news/press-releases/Pages/NR20240606.aspx\" target=\"_blank\">urged</a> more advanced cockpit alerts like the ones Honeywell is testing.</p><p>Runway incursions, when a plane, person or vehicle is on the runway when they shouldn't be, averaged 4.5 a day last year. The Federal Aviation Administration categorizes them by severity, where the top and rarest two are: \"a serious incident in which a collision was narrowly avoided\" followed by \"an incident in which separation decreases and there is a significant potential for collision may result in a time-critical corrective/evasive response to avoid a collision.\"</p><p>Serious runway incursions at U.S. airports peaked at 22 in 2023, the most in at least a decade. The FAA has added new lighting and other safety technology at airports around the country to try to get to its goal of zero close calls.</p></div><h2><a></a>'Good at being a bad pilot'</h2><div><p>\"He's very good at being a bad pilot,\" Thea Feyereisen, a distinguished technical fellow for Honeywell Aerospace Technologies, said of Vining. Her unit develops new cockpit features for aviators, and she said she expects the new suite to win regulator certification next year.</p><p>\"Seconds count when you're operating near the runway, and the sooner you can let the pilots know of a potential serious situation, the better,\" Feyereisen said.</p><p>The Honeywell test plane wasn't configured like a regular passenger jet, and there weren't any paying customers on board. It had a set of roomy seats toward the front of the plane, but in the back, Honeywell flight engineers were positioned at consoles, monitoring flight data and the alerts in real time. Earlier that day, Honeywell demonstrated the technology on a flight with Department of Transportation, FAA and NTSB officials on board, a company spokesman told CNBC.</p><p>Vining performed a simulation of another incident from 2023, when an <span><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/AAL/\">American Airlines</a><span><span></span></span></span> 777 bound for London crossed a runway where a <span><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/DAL/\">Delta Air Lines</a><span><span></span></span></span> 737 was taking off instead of holding short of the runway as an air traffic controller instructed.

The new program Honeywell is testing uses Automatic Dependent Surveillance – Broadcast, or ADS-B data, a GPS for an airplane.</p><p>\"It's usually a very good working environment between pilots, air traffic control, airport management,\" Vining said. \"We get it done safely, efficiently and smoothly. But you could also see just the slightest interruption, a little variation, and things can go wrong very quickly.\"</p><p>The aerospace giant already offers another suite of alerts that tells pilots if they're about to make a mistake like landing or taking off on a taxiway instead of a runway, for example, with visual alerts on a screen as well as aural warnings — \"Caution! Taxiway!\" The so-called Smart X package also alerts pilots if flaps are not set correctly, if the runway is too short, or if they are coming in too high or too fast, among other situations.</p><p>\"As aircraft get closer to the airports where there are other airplanes that are also flying low to the ground, attempting to land, that's the most dangerous spot to have a collision occur,\" said Jeff Guzzetti, a retired air safety investigator with the NTSB and the FAA. </p><p>Those alerts have been on <span><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/ALK/\">Alaska Airlines</a><span><span></span></span></span> planes for years and, more recently, <span><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/LUV/\">Southwest Airlines</a><span><span></span></span></span> has added them. Honeywell said the alerts are currently flying on more than 3,000 planes operated by 20 airlines, but that's still limited adoption with hundreds of carriers operating worldwide.</p><p>\"Since we've implemented the software, I can't think of an instance where we've had a runway incursion,\" said Dave Hunt, Southwest's vice president of safety and security and a 737 pilot.</p><p><span><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/AAL/\">American Airlines</a><span><span></span></span></span> was also training its pilots on those alerts in the second quarter of the year, according to a lesson plan that was seen by CNBC. Last month, American received its first aircraft with the runway awareness and other alerts on board, a spokeswoman said, adding that its Boeing 737 pilots have now been trained on the tools.</p><p>The alerts aren't required by regulators, but the FAA said it is \"reviewing recommendations\" from the Runway Safety Alerting Subgroup \"to determine next steps,\" referring to a group of airline, aerospace, pilot union, government and industry officials that <a href=\"https://www.faa.gov/media/88956\" target=\"_blank\">last year</a> recommended new planes include more advanced cockpit alerts in case of situational awareness issues at airports.</p><p>\"The alerts occur further away from the runway so that if there's an aircraft on the runway, you're not having to make that decision very low to the ground,\" said Jon Sites, director of flight operations safety at Alaska Airlines.</p></div><h2><a></a>The Swiss cheese model</h2><div><p>Honeywell's test plane during a demonstration of new anti-collision warning technology.</p><p>Leslie Josephs/CNBC</p></div><div><p>The United States is the busiest aviation market in the world, with 44,000 flights, carrying 3 million travelers a day. Serious aviation accidents are rare, and fatal crashes are rarer still.</p><p>But a nearly 16-year streak without a fatal incident was broken on Jan. 29 when an Army Black Hawk helicopter <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2025/01/30/aircraft-down-in-potomic-river-near-dca-airport.html\">collided</a> into an American Airlines regional jet that was moments away from landing at Washington Reagan National Airport, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2025/01/30/american-airlines-helicopter-collision-worst-air-disaster-in-years.html\">killing the 67 people</a> aboard the two aircraft and raising <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2025/01/30/american-airlines-plane-crash-military-helicopter-airspace.html\">concerns</a> about congested U.S. airspace to a fever pitch. </p><p>The aviation industry relies on a so-called Swiss cheese safety model, where each slice provides protection but comes with holes that are ideally covered when safety measures are stacked on top of one another.</p><p>\"Aviation is built on layers of safety upon layers,\" said Sites at Alaska Airlines.</p><p>Honeywell's demonstration flight last month from Charles B. Wheeler Downtown Airport in Kansas City, Missouri, recreated a real incident that took place on a foggy morning in February 2023 in Austin, Texas, when a <span><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/FDX/\">FedEx</a><span><span></span></span></span> Boeing 767 plane aborted landing seconds before touching down on the same runway from which an air traffic controller cleared a <span><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/LUV/\">Southwest</a><span><span></span></span></span> 737 to take off.</p><p>The FedEx pilot had seen the outline of the Southwest plane through the fog and pulled up and later landed safely. Both flights continued to their destinations safely, but the two aircraft had gotten as close as 150 feet apart, less than the length of the FedEx 767, according to federal safety investigators.</p><p>Feyereisen said Honeywell's technology could have provided the FedEx pilots in the 2023 Austin incident 28 seconds of advanced notice of traffic on the runway, when they only had a few moments to react, according to a report from the NTSB.</p></div><h2><a></a>Not yet required</h2><div><p>Engineers collect data aboard a Honeywell test plane.</p><p>Magdalena Petrova/CNBC</p></div><div><p>Feyereisen said the new technology could be retrofitted on older aircraft and is available for new jets.</p><p>\"In general, the software costs tens of thousands of dollars [per plane], but not hundreds of thousands of dollars,\" Feyereisen said. \"So if you're looking at [a] $150 million aircraft … it is less than a half a penny per passenger cost to the operation.\"</p><p>Southwest this year added the software to its fleet of about 800 Boeing 737s. It cost between $20 million and $30 million to outfit the planes, Hunt said.</p><p>\"It is cheaper than an accident,\" he said.</p><p>On Feb. 25, a Southwest plane aborted its arrival after it was cleared to land at Chicago Midway International Airport when a Bombardier Challenger 350 business jet advanced onto its runway, with the Southwest jet passing less than 200 feet between the aircraft, before safely landing after a go-around, according to the NTSB.</p><p>Such close calls \"are very, very rare, but obviously they're something that are concerning and that we would try to mitigate as much as possible,\" said Hunt.

    "body": "<div><div><p>People walk by a Claire's store on December 11, 2024 in San Rafael, California.</p><p>Justin Sullivan | Getty Images</p></div><div><p>Claire's is headed for a major makeover.</p><p>The tween retailer, known for its ear piercing stations, jewelry and purple carpeting, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2025/08/06/claires-files-for-bankruptcy-again-as-debt-pile-looms.html\">declared bankruptcy</a> in early August, the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2018/10/05/here-are-the-retailers-that-have-filed-for-bankruptcy-so-far-this-year.html\">second time</a> in seven years, citing nearly $500 million in debt and an increasingly competitive environment.</p><p>Weeks later, private holding company Ames Watson <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2025/08/20/claires-bankrupt-ames-watson-sale.html\">announced</a> it was buying up roughly 1,000 Claire's stores across North America in a $140 million deal to rebuild the brand. The announcement paused the liquidation process at most Claire's stores.</p><p>\"We went and started to do some very deep due diligence, and we came to the conclusion that this was a broken business, not a broken brand,\" Ames Watson co-founder Lawrence Berger told CNBC.</p><p>Ames Watson's portfolio includes makeovers of other businesses, including hat retailer Lids and women's retailer South Moon Under. Berger said the company, which has more than $2 billion in revenue, thinks of itself as a \"mini Berkshire Hathaway,\" buying and transforming companies without any intentions of selling them.</p><p>On top of its mounting debt, Claire's has been facing a multitude of challenges. The retailer is expected to face headwinds from President <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/donald-trump/\">Donald Trump</a>'s global tariffs, and malls have seen dwindling traffic over the past few years. Competitors, like Studs and Lovisa, have also popped up, aiming to offer sleeker ear piercing experiences.</p><p>Fellow Ames Watson co-founder Tom Ripley said he was first introduced to Claire's through his twin daughters, who both got their ears pierced at one of the retailer's stores over a decade ago. Ripley said that experience, coupled with customers' loyalty to the brand, showed him that it was worth investing in.</p><p>\"It's a temple to girlhood and that place you buy your first lip gloss, a friendship bracelet and your first piercing,\" Ripley told CNBC. \"Claire's has been a rite of passage to generations.\"</p></div><div><p><img src=\"https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/108183262-1754598339126-gettyimages-2221758888-img_6156_9f8o11ui.jpeg?v=1755707326&w=750&h=422&vtcrop=y\" alt=\"The rise and fall of Claire's\" /><span></span><span><div><p><span>watch now</span><span></span></p></div></span></p></div><h2><a></a>Revitalization plan</h2><div><p>Ames Watson identified three core areas from the company's research that it believes are central to a Claire's rebirth: merchandising, labor and marketing. At the same time, the co-founders said they're intent on retaining the Claire's identity that was so central to millennials.</p><p>With merchandising, Berger said the company plans to update the products in the store to reflect current trends while also retaining the classic look of Claire's products. The new products might include collaborations or exclusives, he added, with the company eyeing a line of products specifically curated for sleepovers.</p><p>\"I think the merchandising, probably 70% of it is pretty good, but there's 30% that I think we need to change,\" Berger said. \"So I think it'll take us six to nine months for the customers to see that.\"</p><p>Ames Watson also plans on increasing pay, benefits and training for store employees, including having a dedicated \"piercing excellence team\" that will travel around the country and train piercers at every store. The piercing stations themselves will also be receiving an upgrade, Berger added.</p><p>Finally, the new Claire's will lean into fresh marketing that connects with the company's nostalgia and will bring customers along for each new step of its makeover, the co-founders said.</p><p>\"We're going to be very, very open with our community about what we're changing, in the hope that we can really connect with them and build a relationship that lasts for many, many years,\" Berger said.</p></div><div><p>Claire's co-founders Tom Ripley and Lawrence Berger</p><p>Photo: Ames Watson</p></div><div><p>The co-founders said their strategy with taking Lids from a struggling retailer to a revitalized business is informing the way they're approaching Claire's. Ames Watson <a href=\"https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/18498/000001849818000050/ex991lids121418.htm\" target=\"_blank\">acquired</a> Lids in 2019 for $100 million<strong> </strong>and grew the company's revenue, enhanced its in-store embroidery experiences and raised pay for employees.</p><p>For Claire's, its piercing business is just as central to its brand as embroidery is to Lids because they're both experiences that customers can't get online, Ripley said. The framework for modernizing Lids without losing its essential business pieces — focusing on product, experience and people — is the same that Ames Watson plans to use for Claire's.</p><p>\"We don't over-leverage, we don't outsource the hard work and we don't flip businesses,\" Ripley said. \"We roll up our sleeves, do the work ourselves and build for the next generation.\"</p><p>Ripley said nostalgia is at the heart of the Claire's brand, and the company is focused on modernizing Claire's without losing its \"magic.\"</p><p>The storefronts will also get revamps, with the iconic purple carpets getting a fresh cleaning and the presentation of the merchandise getting an upgrade.</p><p>\"Part of the wonder and fun of Claire's is the ability to walk in that store, and you don't know what to expect. You sort of meander around, and you discover things,\" Berger said. \"We don't want to change that.\"</p></div><div><p>The co-founders said they hope the rebirth of Claire's will also speak to the millennial moms who would bring their children to stores. The pair said the company is experimenting with adding products in the store for the generation of women who grew up with Claire's at its height.</p><p>With these changes, Ripley and Berger said they hope Claire's will reemerge as the major player it once was in malls across America.</p><p>\"Our hope is that we'll be profitable from day one — that's what our investment thesis is and, to be frank, that's what healthy companies are,\" Berger said. \"We believe that it's structured in a way that it should be profitable, but that means that we've got to do our jobs right.\"</p></div></div>"

He would not reveal where his passport was, and did not surrender it when arrested. </p><p>Rubin's lawyer argued he was not a flight risk because two of his adult children and his grandchildren live near him.</p><p>The lawyer also cited Rubin's health condition, saying he had a stroke in July.</p><p>Kuo rejected that argument, but Rubin's defense team could make a new bail application.

So, we're continuing to call the universe and make sure that it's appropriate, and it's accessible for investors,\" said Todd Rosenbluth, the firm's head of research, said in the same interview.</p><p>And he anticipates the new offering will grab investors' attention.</p></div><h2><a></a>Private credit vs. bitcoin</h2><div><p>\"We recently at VettaFi did a survey for advisors as to how they were looking to diversify their portfolio, and what was compelling to me was more people chose private credit than digital assets,\" Rosenbluth said. \"So, more people were interested in getting exposure to the ETF wrapper through something that is very hard to find right now as opposed to bitcoin.\"</p><p>He views private credit a <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2025/09/26/gold-bitcoin-market-hedge-income-yield-opportunities-blackrock-etf.html\">portfolio diversifier</a> — suggesting an allocation of 5% to 10%.</p><p>As of Friday's close, the Simplify VettaFi Private Credit Strategy ETF is virtually flat since its Wednesday debut.</p></div></div>"
