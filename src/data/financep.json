Differing from generative AI, agents act independently, can initiate actions, and recall previous work they performed. Some examples include <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2025/01/23/openai-operator-ai-agent-can-automate-tasks-like-vacation-planning.html\">OpenAI's Operator</a> and Anthropic's Claude.</p><p>AI debt is the cost of not implementing nascent autonomous systems correctly, Mark Hoffman, an expert at Asana's Work Innovation Lab, told CNBC Make It.</p><p>\"Those costs could be money costs. They could also be lost time, which relates to money. It could also be a lot of things that you have to undo, which is costly from a financial standpoint. It burns people out to have to do it. It's all of the costs associated with poor implementation,\" Hoffman said.</p><p>The report outlined that the debt could manifest as security risks, poor data quality, low impact AI agents which will waste time and resources for human employees, and a management skills gap.</p><p>Hoffman said this is not an exhaustive list and the \"debt\" could look like a bunch of code created by AI that doesn't work right or AI-generated content that nobody is using.</p><p>New research from BetterUp Labs and Stanford Social Media LabÂ even found that 40% of desk workers in the U.S. have received <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2025/09/23/ai-generated-workslop-is-destroying-productivity-and-teams-researchers-say.html\">AI-generated \"workslop,\"</a> which the researchers defined as content that looks good but lacks any substance.</p></div><div><p><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2025/09/23/ai-generated-workslop-is-destroying-productivity-and-teams-researchers-say.html\"><img src=\"https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/108202475-1758579102271-gettyimages-700712909-bld240699.jpeg?v=1758579133&w=160&h=90\" /></a></p></div><div><p>It's created almost two hours of extra work for people who encountered it, a $186 invisible tax per month, and a $9 million hit to productivity in a year, per the research.</p><p>\"There's large investment going into this space right now, and ultimately it's a question of whether those investments will pay off,\" Hoffman said.</p><p>Henry Ajder, founder of AI consulting firm Latent Space Advisory, and an advisor to the U.K. government, Meta, and AI video startup Synthesia, emphasized the need for thoughtful implementation and structures.</p><p>\"People who are CTOs or innovation officers, the good ones I've worked with, the ones who I think I did the best position to succeed with it, they aren't sugar coating the disruption that this is going to cost ... as with any kind of fundamental rework, you are going to have problems, you're gonna have bumps in the road,\" Ajder said in an interview.</p></div><h2><a></a>'It's not a magical silver bullet'</h2><div><p>Asana's report found that despite AI adoption surging to 70% in 2025 from 52% in 2024, workers are also facing higher levels of digital burnout.</p><p>Digital exhaustion increased to 84% in 2025 from 75% the prior year, while unmanageable workloads also rose to 77%, per the report.</p><p>Mona Mourshed, founding global CEO of Generation, a U.S.-based employment organization, told CNBC that despite companies rolling out AI tools and encouraging the use of it, workers are still struggling.</p><p>\"The core reason that they're struggling, and we know this from also talking to our own alumni, is that the use case for how and why are you supposed to use this AI tool in the flow of your work is often missing,\" Mourshed said.</p><p>\"Without a clear understanding of what is the use case that's going to make this particular task better, faster, cheaper ... that's what leads to the exhaustion, because you don't know what the intended outcome is,\" she added.</p><p>Mourshed noted that companies are investing in AI in the hopes that overnight work will be performed better, faster and cheaper, but they aren't offering the necessary training or guidelines to enable improvements.</p><p>\"It's not a magical silver bullet, and all of a sudden it does everything you want once you install it ... it's going to be a much more painful journey to get to those benefits than companies that have thought it through.\"</p><p>AI expert Ajder said the correct strategy is carefully testing AI use and building infrastructure around it rather than rushing into the race unprepared.</p><p>\"You don't start by just embedding, you start by piloting, you start by scoping, by sandboxing, by trialing these systems,\" he said.</p><p>This includes everything from the correct training for employees, to thinking about the kind of AI models the business might need. It's much harder to respond to mistakes or malfunctions when there's no procedure in place.</p><p>\"So I'm not saying that you can't take risk thoughtfully when it comes to using AI, but it has to be calculated and it has to be scoped,\" Ajder said.</p></div></div>"

    "body": "<div><p>As a former world champion debater, Kate Mason, PhD, knows that the way you communicate can matter just as much as your message.</p><p>Mason, who lives in Sydney, Australia, spent a decade working in communications at companies like Google and YouTube before becoming an executive coach and founding her own strategic communications firm, <a href=\"https://www.wearehedgehogandfox.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Hedgehog + Fox</a>, in 2017.</p><p>Through her work as a <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2025/09/15/dont-ask-how-are-you-how-successful-people-get-others-to-like-and-trust-them-psychology-expert.html\">communications coach</a>, Mason noticed a pattern she calls \"imposing syndrome\": many professionals, particularly women, are overly self-conscious about ruffling feathers or \"being a bother\" at work, she says, which often causes them to stay quiet and minimize their accomplishments.</p><p>These self-deprecating habits have \"an insidious effect on their work and their standing,\" she says.</p><p>\"It leads to <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2025/08/04/people-wont-take-you-seriously-if-you-use-these-phrases-make-these-powerful-swaps-says-communication-expert.html\">underestimating themselves</a> and their work by extension,\" she continues.</p><p>Mason's goal in highlighting these communication patterns isn't to point out \"all the ways we're doing it wrong,\" she says. Instead, she hopes to provide resources for leaders, especially women, who are interested in changing their communication patterns.</p><p>\"It's more like a kind acknowledgment: this is a thing, and if that's not serving you, maybe you want to experiment a little bit,\" Mason says.</p><p>She shares her top insights in her first book, <a href=\"https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/745694/powerfully-likeable-by-kate-mason-phd/\" target=\"_blank\">\"Powerfully Likeable: A Woman's Guide to Effective Communication,\"</a> which debuted earlier this month.</p><p>Here are three phrases Mason recommends all professionals avoid in the workplace, along with stronger alternatives.</p><h3><strong>'It'll just take a second'</strong></h3><p>People who use this phrase are often acting on a \"very kind, emotionally aware impulse\" to demonstrate respect for others' time, Mason says.</p><p>In reality, prefacing your conversation with \"It'll just take a second\" can have the opposite effect, according to Mason.</p><p>Firstly, \"you've set an expectation to the other person that this will be very quick,\" she says, but \"literally nothing takes one second.\"</p><p>Providing an unrealistic time estimate can annoy or disappoint the person you're speaking to, Mason says.</p><p>\"That person, a couple minutes in, is already a bit irritated because they're like, 'Wait, this was only going to be a second.'\"</p><p>Moreover, the phrase also sets the expectation that whatever you have to say is minor or unimportant, Mason says, which can undercut your actual message.</p><p>A better way to articulate your request is, \"I'm going to put in an hour for us next week. I really want to talk through A, B and C. Let me know if that time works for you,\" Mason says.</p><p>With that rephrase, \"suddenly, I look like I'm coming to you with something substantive and meaty and worthy of us spending that time together,\" she says.</p><p>\"It just does the idea â and yourself â a lot more justice to reframe it that way,\" she continues.</p><h3><strong>'No worries if not'</strong></h3><p>This phrase is commonly used to 'soften' a direct request, Mason says, but it's usually not factually true.</p><p>\"There often <em>is </em>a pressing concern,\" she says. \"It's very rare that we make an ask and genuinely think, 'Oh well, if they get back to me, we'll see.'\"</p><p>Saying \"No worries if not\" communicates that your request is a low priority, Mason says: \"It does a bit of a disservice to the ask.\"</p><p>For her part, when Mason hears this phrase, she mentally places that task lower on her to-do list, she says.</p><p>\"If you're communicating with an exec or someone who's busy and you're telling them 'no worries if not,' and there is a worry, then we can get ourselves into a bit of an unnecessarily sticky situation,\" she says.</p><p>Instead, Mason suggests specifying the purpose and time frame of your request. For example, \"I would appreciate if you could send me your edits by this afternoon, because the final draft is due tomorrow.\"</p><p>As Mason cites in her book, a <a href=\"https://psycnet.apa.org/doi/10.1037/0022-3514.36.6.635\" target=\"_blank\">psychological study</a> from the 1970s<strong> </strong>found that people were more likely to comply with a request if they were given a reason behind it.</p><p>With that context, people are \"usually happy to help,\" she says.</p><h3><strong>'I'm not an expert, butâ¦'</strong></h3><p>This phrase will instantly make you seem less credible, Mason says.</p><p>According to Mason, prefacing your point with \"I'm not an expert\" <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2025/08/14/ive-coached-leaders-at-google-and-amazon-highly-successful-people-use-these-phrases-to-command-attention.html\">reduces your authority</a> and telegraphs uncertainty: \"It immediately deescalates your status.\"</p><p>People often minimize their accomplishments when they're feeling self-conscious, Mason says, especially if they view themselves as the 'odd one out' in a group.</p><p>Whether you're the youngest in the room, or the newest to the company, \"whatever that imbalance may be, we're hyper-aware of it,\" she says.</p><p>Being conscious of your place in the professional hierarchy isn't necessarily a bad thing, Mason says, but instead of downplaying your value, she recommends embracing the unique qualities you bring to the table.</p><p>\"You weren't hired because you have the same expertise as that vice president or C-level exec,\" she says. \"You were hired because you have <em>your</em> expertise.\"</p><p>Leaning into your strengths can be \"really empowering,\" Mason says.</p><p>\"Once you start realizing like, this is the thing I was hired for, and that is the value I can bring, and that's what they want from me, it just lets you put down a lot of that hierarchical, status-oriented anxiety.\"</p><p><em><strong>Want to be your own boss?</strong>Â Sign up for Smarter by CNBC Make It's new online course,Â </em><a href=\"https://smarter.cnbcmakeit.com/p/how-to-start-a-business-for-first-time-founders?utm_source=cnbc&utm_medium=makeitarticle&utm_campaign=bottom\" target=\"_blank\"><em>How To Start A Business: For First-Time Founders</em></a><em>.

    "body": "<div><div><p>Struggling to stay on top of your money is not a unique problem.</p><p>But neurodivergent people â such as those with <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2023/07/31/ellie-middleton-learned-she-has-adhd-autism-in-her-20s-now-she-shares-her-experiences.html\">autism or ADHD</a> â can face a unique set of challenges when managing their finances, says Andrea Ewalefo, founder of <a href=\"https://www.modernladyvibes.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Modern Lady Vibes</a>, a financial coaching business specializing in neurodivergent women of color.</p><p>One of these challenges is something called <a href=\"https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/symptoms/23224-executive-dysfunction\" target=\"_blank\">executive dysfunction</a>. It can crop up in variety of areas â \"anything from your impulsivity, to your ability to make decisions, to your to your ability to be consistent,\" Ewalefo says. \"Time blindness is another one, you get caught up in certain experiences. Or you don't have enough dopamine to keep you focused for a long period of time.\"</p><p>If any of this sounds like you, the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2023/05/23/why-the-50-30-20-budgeting-rule-is-out-of-reach-for-most-americans.html\">traditional approach to managing money</a> you've been taught may not work for you, says Ewalefo, herself a member of the neurodivergent community.</p><p>\"A lot of the things people in the financial education space get caught up in is throwing systems in people's faces,\" she says. For neurodivergent folks, \"we struggle with not only getting the systems set up, but sticking to them, or getting emotionally invested in them.\"</p><p>Ewalefo knows that no two people have the exact same concerns when it comes to money, and tries to meet clients where they are. Her advice for nearly all of them: \"Don't beat yourself up.\" And whenever possible, try to automate and delegate the financial tasks that drain you the most, so you can focus more on achieving your money goals.</p></div><h2><a></a>Removing decision fatigue can make it easier to manage your money</h2><div><p>For some neurodivergent people, the \"<a href=\"https://health.clevelandclinic.org/spoon-theory-chronic-illness\" target=\"_blank\">spoon theory</a>,\" can serve as a useful metaphor for a daily store of energy that's depleted by doing tasks.</p><p>\"Brushing your teeth â things that neurotypical people just wake up and do â we have to consciously think about, and it uses our energy, our spoons,\" Ewalefo says. \"This morning brushing my teeth might take ten spoons. Yesterday it took two.\"</p><p>The idea is that you have a set amount of spoons for the day, and once they're gone, you're completely mentally spent, \"a log on the floor,\" Ewalefo says.</p><p>For many of Ewalefo's clients, the first step to getting on track financially is about taking money-related spoons off the table.</p><p>\"If we can remove as much decision fatigue as possible, particularly within our financial planning, then that can help preserve our energy to do other things,\" she says. \"What that might look like is automating as much as possible.\"</p><p>Ewalefo recommends setting your bill due dates to align with the days you get paid. If you're paid once a month, for instance, set up autopay for all your bills on payday.</p><p>\"Since it's happening right when you get that paycheck, once your bills are paid, everything left is just free spending money,\" she says. \"Now have the freedom to enjoy your impulse buying without worrying about the fact that, oh no, I just spent my car payment.\"</p><p>What's more, setting rote financial tasks on autopilot can allow you to dedicate more of your mental energy to the money goals you really care about. To make progress on those, she says, you'll also have to pay yourself from each check â and that can be put on autopilot, too.</p><p>\"It's not just the bills or the debt, it's also auto-drafting your savings and investing needs so that those are prioritized just as much as your rent, just as much as your water bill,\" Ewalefo says. \"And all of that money has been set aside and put where it needs to go, so whatever is left in your account can literally just be spent on whatever you want.\"</p><p><em><strong>Last chance to save: Want to be your own boss?</strong>Â Final days to get 30% off Smarter by CNBC Make It's new online course,Â </em><a href=\"https://smarter.cnbcmakeit.com/p/how-to-start-a-business-for-first-time-founders?utm_source=cnbc&utm_medium=makeitarticle&utm_campaign=bottom\" target=\"_blank\"><em>How To Start A Business: For First-Time Founders</em></a><em>.

I had spent more than a decade dreaming, trying, and failing to make Spain home.</p><p>Since then, I've built a life in Spain and created <a href=\"https://shehitrefresh.com/\" target=\"_blank\">She Hit Refresh</a>, where I've helped hundreds of other women move abroad.Â </p><p>Along the way, I've experienced moments when my life in Europe felt like a movie. Like the time I stumbled upon a flamenco dancer in a hidden square, sipped wine at a Parisian cafÃ© while the world passed by, or rode a Vespa past the Colosseum in Rome.</p><p>But these moments aren't everyday life, and not everything about moving abroad is just as you imagine it to be. Here are the six myths I hear most often about relocating.</p></div><h2><a></a>1. 'It's so cheap'</h2><div><p>Many countries can feel more affordable than the U.S.,Â but living abroad is probably not as cheap as you think. Costs are rising around the world, especially housing prices. <a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/web/products-eurostat-news/w/ddn-20250704-4\" target=\"_blank\">House prices in the EU went up</a> 57.9% between 2010 and the first quarter of 2025, while rents increased by 27.8%.Â </p><p>My advice: Run the numbers based on <em>today's</em> reality, not outdated blog posts. And remember, what feels affordable to you on a U.S. salary may still be unaffordable for locals. Don't overpay. It only fuels the problem.</p></div><h2><a></a>2. 'Americans aren't welcome'</h2><div><p>The real pressure comes from tourism, not the relatively small number of Americans moving abroad. And while anti-tourism sentiment exists in crowded cities, it's not really about Americans, or even expats at all. The bigger issue is affordable housing â or, as I mentioned, the lack of it.</p><p>But smaller towns across Europe <em>want</em> new residents due to depopulation. If you're serious about integrating, consider looking beyond hotspots like Lisbon, Barcelona, or Amsterdam.Â </p><p>Regardless, in my own experience, when you learn the language, contribute, and connect, you'll usually be <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2025/05/18/i-help-americans-move-abroad-most-welcoming-countries-in-europe.html\">welcomed with open arms</a>.</p></div><h2><a></a>3. 'You'll be lonely'</h2><div><p>Of course you'll miss family and friends, but community abroad often forms faster than you'd expect.</p><p>Other Americans and English-speaking foreigners are eager to connect. Between meetups, language exchanges, and expat events, you'll have no shortage of opportunities to meet people.</p><p>That said, deep friendships take time. I'm an extrovert, and it still took me around 2.5 years to feel like I had a strong community in Madrid. Many of <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2025/04/10/these-things-are-crucial-to-happy-friendships-says-connection-expert.html\">my closest friendships</a> came from hosting my own meetups.</p><p>For deeper integration, friendships with locals are key, though those are definitely harder to form. Many locals already have tight circles, and breaking in takes patience and persistence. Learning the language is essential, and it takes time. Most people are still beginners after a year.</p></div><h2><a></a>4. 'Life abroad is perfect'</h2><div><p>Living abroad can absolutely improve your quality of life â whether it's a slower pace, a relatively lower cost of living, or easier travel, there's a lot to love. But it's not a fairy tale.</p><p>You'll still deal with bureaucracy, taxes, and logistics like finding an apartment, setting up bank accounts, and making appointments with doctors. And sometimes the grocery store will just be closed on a Sunday when you need it most.</p><p>The hardest challenges are often personal. I'll never forget when I got the call that my father had passed away. It was in 2009, during one of my earlier stints in Spain, getting my master's degree. I learned then that the highs and lows of life still happen abroad, and the lows are tougher when you're far from home.</p></div><h2><a></a>5. 'Where you start is where you have to stay'</h2><div><p>Your first move abroad doesn't have to be your forever home. Think of it as a starting point, not a lifelong commitment. As someone once told me: It's a move, not a marriage.Â </p><p>When I moved to Madrid in 2015, I thought I'd never leave. But in 2020, I moved to MÃ¡laga, and now I'm considering heading back to Madrid again.</p><p>I've seen this with others, too. <a href=\"https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/still-saying-yes-how-cindy-built-a-life-abroad-in-her-60s-ep-56/id1449428314?i=1000694368757\" target=\"_blank\">Cindy Sheahan</a>, for example, moved to Porto, Portugal, but then decided Italy was a better fit and relocated there a year later.</p><p>Giving yourself permission to pivot can help you <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2025/06/02/avoid-this-common-trap-that-makes-decisions-harder-and-your-life-worse-take-simple-steps-instead.html\">avoid getting stuck in research paralysis</a>, trying to make the \"perfect\" choice before you even start. There are plenty of things you just won't know until you've actually moved.</p></div><h2><a></a>6. 'It's too late for me'</h2><div><p>I was 35 when I moved and thought I was already too old. At the time, I only knew of students and <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2025/06/03/55-year-old-american-who-retired-in-portugal-shares-myths-about-living-abroad-as-an-expat.html\">retirees moving abroad</a>, not people in the middle of their careers. But at 45, I can say without hesitation that it was the best decision I've ever made.</p><p>And once I got here, I met so many people my age and older who had done the same. People make the leap at every age â 30s, 40s, 50s, even 70s.</p><p>In fact, moving in your 30s or later has advantages, since people tend to arrive with more financial stability, better <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2024/08/01/wharton-psychologist-adam-grant-to-know-yourself-better-try-this.html\">self-awareness</a>, and the wisdom to navigate challenges with perspective.</p><p><em><strong>Cepee Tabibian</strong> is the founder of </em><a href=\"https://shehitrefresh.com/\" target=\"_blank\"><em>She Hit Refresh</em></a><em>, a community and resource platform that helps women aged 30+ move abroad.

    "body": "<div><p>For some entrepreneurs, becoming their own boss was a no-brainer. Maybe they come from a family of business owners, or never really felt fulfilled working a standard 9-to-5 job.</p><p>For others, the signs may not be so evident, leaving them to wonder, \"Am I ready to take the leap? Am I even supposed to be my own boss?\" According to Olipop co-founder and CEO Ben Goodwin, there's a tell-tale sign to watch out for.Â </p><p>\"If the excitement and fulfillment of the vision for what you want to do is more powerful than the fear and the excuses,\" then you should act on it, says Goodwin, 40. He adds that you have to have \"a lot of passion\" because when things inevitably get tough, that drive will keep you focused on your mission.</p><p><em><strong>DON'T MISS</strong></em><a href=\"https://smarter.cnbcmakeit.com/p/how-to-start-a-business-for-first-time-founders?utm_source=cnbc&utm_medium=makeitarticle&utm_campaign=body\" target=\"_blank\"><em><strong>:</strong>Â <strong>The ultimate guide to starting a businessâeverything you need to know to be your own boss</strong></em></a></p><p>Goodwin struggled with his physical and mental health as a teen who was regularly consuming unhealthy foods and beverages. Changing to a healthier diet and lifestyle made him feel much more fulfilled, he told <a href=\"https://fortune.com/well/article/olipop-cofounder-daily-habits-wellness-routine-ben-goodwin/\" target=\"_blank\">Fortune</a> in December 2023. So much so that he dropped out of college to pursue healthy drink alternatives to sodas and sugary juices. Goodwin left the University of California Santa Cruz in 2005, and 20 years later, he's still dedicated to his mission to help people lead healthier lives, he tells CNBC Make It.Â Â </p><p>The journey wasn't linear. Goodwin's first venture, a water kefir beverage called Obi Probiotic Soda that launched in 2008, didn't gain the traction he'd hoped despite being in business for eight years. He and his business partner, David Lester, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2023/09/16/how-olipops-founders-turned-100k-investment-into-healthier-soda-brand.html\">sold the company</a> for an undisclosed amount in 2016, and used the money to get Olipop off the ground. The company made $852,000 in gross revenue in its first year of business, and was valued at <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2025/02/12/olipop-prebiotic-soda-valued-at-1point85-billion-in-funding-round.html\">$1.85 billion</a> in February.</p><p>Goodwin says that if you're able to bounce back from hardships and enjoy facing challenges head on, you're probably ready to be your own boss.Â </p><p>\"One of the things I really enjoy about entrepreneurialism is that it keeps challenging you,\" he says. \"You've got to make complex ethical decisions. You've got to make complex procedure decisions. You've got to operate under extreme pressure. And a lot of people want to avoid those things, logically, because they tend to make life a lot more complicated.\"Â </p><p>But if you're the kind of person that \"feels more alive when they're getting deeply or dynamically challenged, and recognize the value that that can provide to your interpersonal development,\" you should try your hand at entrepreneurship, says Goodwin.Â </p><p>Of course, everyone isn't innately open to failing or recovering from setbacks. But resilience is a skill that can be built and nurtured over time, according to author and mental performance coach Steve Magness. He recommends that people make a <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2022/07/01/how-changing-one-word-in-your-thoughts-can-boost-your-mental-toughness-and-resilience.html\">simple mindset shift</a> to start: \"Switch 'I' to 'you,\" he wrote for CNBC Make It in July 2022.Â </p><p>\"Using second- or third-person language in your self-talk creates distance between an experience and our emotional response,\" said Magness. \"This linguistic trick allows us to zoom out.\"</p><p>Next time you're facing a stressful challenge, tell yourself, \"You can do this,\" or, \"[Your name] can get through this,\" instead of, \"I've done this before,\"<strong> </strong>speaking to yourself like a friend or family member giving you a push.</p><p>\"When we broaden our worldview beyond a self-immersed world, we move from emotional reaction to action,\" Magness said.</p><p><em><strong>Want to be your own boss?</strong>Â Sign up for Smarter by CNBC Make It's new online course,Â </em><a href=\"https://smarter.cnbcmakeit.com/p/how-to-start-a-business-for-first-time-founders?utm_source=cnbc&utm_medium=makeitarticle&utm_campaign=bottom\" target=\"_blank\"><em>How To Start A Business: For First-Time Founders</em></a><em>.

Behind them is a depiction of the seal of the Federal Reserve.</p><p>The image appears to be \"AI-generated or digitally illustrated,\" according to visual analysis by ChatGPT.</p><p>Trump has repeatedly criticized Powell for his cautious approach to cutting interest rates, nicknaming him \"Too Late Powell.\" The latest threat came even as the central bank lowered rates earlier this month for the first time this year. Powell's term as chair ends in May 2026.</p><p>The White House didn't immediately respond to CNBC's request for comment.</p><p>Firing the top central banker would be unprecedented as no U.S. president ever has attempted to do so, though others have criticized prior Fed chairs. A recentÂ <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2025/05/22/supreme-court-federal-reserve-trump.html\">Supreme Court decision</a>Â indicated that the president does not have the authority to remove Fed officials at will. Â Powell has said repeatedly that his firing is \"not permitted under the law.\"</p><p>The Trump White House has blasted Powell over renovations to the Fed's Washington headquarters, raising suspicion that Trump could try to remove the Fed leader for cause. Although lately Trump has eased his criticisms of the Fed building, while continuing to be vocal about Powell hurting the economy by keeping rates too high in his view.</p><p>Trump attempted to fire Fed Governor Lisa Cook in August on alleged mortgage fraud. The Supreme Court is set to rule on that matter soon. The Department of Justice on Friday <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2025/09/26/trump-fed-cook-scotus-markets.html\">said</a> in a Supreme Court filing that firing Cook for alleged misconduct would not harm the financial markets. Cook's attorneys argued in a prior filing to the high court that her removal could ruin Fed independence.</p><p>So far, the financial markets have shown little reaction to Trump's Powell threats or Cook's attempted firing. Though many economists and investors believe firing Powell before his term ends could cause longer-term interest rates to rise on the notion the Fed would start to act in Trump's interests and not according to its dual mandate from Congress of stable inflation and low unemployment.</p></div></div>"

TipRanks' AI Analyst has an \"outperform\" rating on Nvidia stock with a price target of $204.</p><p>Highlighting the key takeaways from his conversation with the company's CFO, Lipacis said that Nvidia will be the preferred supplier to OpenAI, adding that the ChatGPT platform has underestimated demand for its solution and wants to get ahead of future demand. Nvidia is well-positioned to help OpenAI with this infrastructure buildout.</p><p>Lipacis noted that the deal specifies at least 10 GW (gigawatts) of AI infrastructure, and Nvidia management confirmed that, historically, the company's total addressable market (TAM) was $30 billion to $40 billion per GW, although it could increase in the future. The analyst increased his 2026 revenue and earnings per share (EPS) estimates by 2% for Nvidia, but thinks that his forecast may be conservative.</p><p>Lipacis ranks No. 53 among more than 10,000 analysts tracked by TipRanks.

TipRanks' AI Analyst is also bullish on MDB stock, giving it an \"outperform\" rating and a price target of $355.</p><p>Cikos said that while investors' initial reaction to the high-teens revenue growth forecast was underwhelming, he expects both AI and competitive migrations to drive incremental growth for MongoDB.</p><p>The 5-star analyst noted that management plans to continue investing in the business, though at a slower rate than revenue and gross profit growth. MongoDB's investments will mainly focus on developer awareness, research & development and its sales force.The company has also identified areas for optimization and expects its scale to drive profitable growth through efficiencies.</p><p>Cikos said that following the MongoDB.local event he is \"incrementally more positive on MongoDB's AI positioning,\" driven by embeddings, which bridge data and Large Language Models (LLMs), and the continued integration of Voyage's best-in-class models.</p><p>Cikos ranks No. 581 among more than 10,000 analysts tracked by TipRanks.

CrowdStrike remains one of RBC's top cybersecurity ideas, he added. TipRanks' AI Analyst has a \"neutral\" rating on CrowdStrike stock with a target price of $543.</p><p>\"Overall, we thought the event made a compelling case for the company's positioning as we enter the agentic era,\" said Hedberg.</p><p>The 5-star analyst mainly noted lucrative prospects in agentic security for CrowdStrike and the evolution of its agentic security operations center (SOC). He added that management views the agentic revolution as a huge opportunity (potentially over a 100x), with the rise of more identities and complexity creating new security needs.</p><p>Management sees a total addressable market (TAM) of $300 billion in 2030, up from $140 billion in 2026, with key tailwinds resulting from market consolidation, the evolving threat landscape and technological advancements. Helped by these tailwinds, Hedberg believes CrowdStrike is well-positioned for continued market consolidation as it secures an AI-led transformation. Â </p><p>Hedberg noted that CrowdStrike is about halfway through its $10 billion annual recurring revenue (ARR) goal for fiscal 2031. While cloud, the Next-Gen Identity Security offering and the Next-Gen SIEM platform are the key drivers for the current ARR of $4.7 billion, management expects agentic SOC to be the main catalyst for achieving the $10 billion ARR target for fiscal 2031. CrowdStrike expects Agentic Everywhere to be the key driver for the newly introduced $20 billion ARR target for fiscal 2036.</p><p>Hedberg ranks No. 37 among more than 10,000 analysts tracked by TipRanks.

The best thing for me was to join the military so I wouldn't have to put my family into any more debt and I think that was the right decision.\"</p><p>Ryan joined the U.S. Air Force in 2010 and was stationed in various countries around the world, including Korea, Germany, and throughout Africa. In 2016, while living in Korea, Ryan got in trouble for breaking his curfew. He lost out on several months of pay, was restricted to his military base and demoted from staff sergeant to senior airman.</p><p>\"After this, I was very depressed and very sad,\" Ryan said. \"But that depression and sadness make you think about where your life is going and it makes you redirect your life into the right direction.\"</p></div><div><p>In Vietnam, Ryan lives off of roughly $4,000 a month.</p><p>Louis Corallo for CNBC Make It</p></div><div><p>In that period of time that Ryan was restricted to his military base, he planned a trip to visit a friend in Vietnam.</p><p>\"It just looked like so much fun and it really lived up to all the hype,\" he said. \"I ended up having the best time of my life, and that depression was [just] gone.\"</p><p>Ryan says that after that first trip to Vietnam and seeing how happy he was, he didn't want to let go of that feeling. He started planning his return to the country.</p><p>The veteran returned to his life in the Air Force and completed his service on a military baseÂ in Wyoming before being honorably discharged in 2019.</p></div><div><p>Ryan lives in a two-bedroom apartment in Ho Chi Minh City.</p><p>Louis Corallo for CNBC Make It</p></div><div><p>Soon after, Ryan relocated to Vietnam, where he lives off roughly $4,000 a month, according to documents reviewed by CNBC Make It.</p><p>Ryan suffers from spine arthritis, respiratory issues, auditory pain, and mental health challenges from his time in the military. He receives disability from Veterans Affairs.</p><p>His monthly income stems from several sources, including approximately $1,500 from VA disability, $1,000 from the GI Bill while he's pursuing a master's degree, and $900 to $1,300 from teaching English. Ryan also does occasional odd jobs like voiceover work, where his pay can range from $200 to $600 a month, and is an avid fan of day trading, where he averages about $300 a month.</p><p>\"This might not sound like a lot in America but trust me, this is more than enough to be middle or even above middle class in Vietnam,\" he says.</p></div><div><p>When Ryan moved to Vietnam, he bought a motorcycle to get around</p><p>Louis Corallo for CNBC Make It</p></div><div><p>Ryan lives in Ho Chi Minh City and has a two-bedroom, one-bathroom apartment in one of the country's tallest residential towers. He pays $850 a month in rent and his utilities round up to about $130, which includes electricity, water and housekeeping.</p><p>In addition to those expenses, Ryan also pays $1,000 a year for health insurance and $3 a week on gas for his motorcycle. What he spends on groceries varies from $100 to $400 a month, as he often alternates between cooking his own food or dining out frequently.</p><p>\"Vietnam is the number one safest place I've ever lived. I never have to look over my shoulder here. I noticed that there's this great level of calm,\" Ryan says. \"People are more focused on their day-to-day life and they're less focused on what's going on politically. It's a much more calm feeling.\"</p><p>Although Ryan loves living in Vietnam, one thing that irks him is the noise pollution.</p><p>\"There's a lot of honking, street sellers and sometimes karaoke really loudly, so if you are very intolerant to noise, this might not be the place for you,\" he says.</p></div><div><p>Ryan says Vietnam is now home and he has no plans of leaving.</p><p>Louis Corallo for CNBC Make It</p></div><div><p>Since moving to Vietnam, Ryan has made an effort to learn the language, but he admits he's still not the best at it.</p><p>\"I can never claim that I'm fluent in Vietnamese, but I do a lot better than most of my peers here,\" he says.</p><p>Ryan has been living in Vietnam for six years now, and says he has no plans of leaving.</p><p>\"If I leave, it's because Vietnam told me to leave. In America, I felt very unmotivated. I felt like no matter how hard you work, you're still in poverty. You're constantly chasing a standard that you can't really achieve,\" he says. \"Here in Vietnam, it takes a lot of the monetary pressure out of your day-to-day. You focus on what makes you happy, who you want to become and how you're going to get there.\"</p><p>This experience, he says, is the complete opposite of what his life was like back in the U.S.</p><p>\"Every day I wake up with a long to-do list of things I want to do, not the things that I need to do, and it's a completely different way of living. Even if you need to work 40 hours a week here, you're doing it as an investment in your future.

The company operates entirely within the United States, with assets including printed and digital billboards, transit displays, including airports, street furniture and wallscapes and other spectaculars.Â </p><p><strong>Stock Market Value</strong>: $755.45 million ($1.52 per share)Â </p></div><div><h3>Activist: Anson Funds</h3><p><strong>Ownership: </strong>3.65%Â </p><p><strong>Average Cost: </strong>n/a<strong>Â </strong></p><p><strong>Activist Commentary: </strong>Anson Funds is a multistrategy fund founded in 2007 by Moez Kassam and has over $2 billion in assets. While not historically activists, on Oct. 3, 2023, Anson hired Sagar Gupta, former senior analyst and head of TMT investing at Legion Partners, to build out their activism strategy.Â </p><h3>What's happening</h3><p>On Sept. 22, Anson Funds announced that they are calling for a sale of Clear Channel Outdoor Holdings.Â </p><h3>Behind the scenes</h3><p>Clear Channel Outdoor is one of the largest out-of-home advertising companies that offers a variety of advertising services, including through billboards, street furniture displays, transit displays, and airport displays. In the U.S., they are one of the three big companies in this sector, with <span><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/LAMR/\">Lamar Advertising</a><span><span></span></span></span> and <span><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/OUT/\">Outfront Media</a><span><span></span></span></span> numbers one and two, respectively.</p><p>Historically, the challenges for CCO have centered around the company's two business lines â Americas and Europe, each with very different business models and valuations. The European business worked on fixed limited-term contracts with municipalities, which were re-bided at maturity. Because of this, the European business traded around 8x EBITDA multiple, while the U.S., largely comprised of owned billboards, traded closer 13 â 15x EBITDA.</p><p>These problems prompted Legion Partners to launch an activist campaign at CCO in May 2023, urging the company to consider a broad strategic review process, including divesting non-U.S. assets or a sale of the entire company. Legion also highlighted CCO's potential value proposition through its transition to digital billboards, which would allow each billboard to generate about four times more revenue and six to 10 times more EBITDA. Ultimately, they settled for a board seat for Legion co-founder Ted White, who still serves as a director today. Since then, CCO has executed a series of divestures, including selling its European business to Bauer Media Group, its Latin America business to Global VÃ­a PÃºblic, and, just two weeks ago, its Spain business to Atresmedia. These moves have transformed CCO into a U.S. pureplay and allowed it to start paying down its debt. However, despite this successful activist catalyst, CCO is yet to achieve the rerating some expected - currently, CCO trades at approximately 13-14 times EBITDA, versus peers Lamar and Outfront at 16-18 times. As a result, the stock is down 26.56% since Legion filed its 13D and over 90% from its IPO price.</p><p>On Sept. 22, Anson Funds joined the party, announcing that they are calling for a sale of the company. While this is a new campaign for Anson, this is not the beginning of their investment story. Sagar Gupta, who runs Anson's activism strategy, was at Legion Partners when they launched their campaign, and, perhaps not coincidentally, CCO has appeared in Anson's 13F holdings every quarter since Gupta joined the fund, now with a 3.65% position as of their most recent filing. So, Anson's call for a sale of the company is not a short-term, opportunistic campaign, but a decision made after years of analysis and working amicably with the company and at a time when it has become most feasible.</p><p>The company is now a U.S. pureplay, making it more focused and more valuable from a multiple perspective and easier to acquire from a regulatory perspective. Possible acquirers include <span><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/DEC-FR/\">JCDecaux</a><span><span></span></span></span> and Lamar.</p><p>In fact, JCDecaux terminated an agreement to buy CCO's Spain assets after facing restrictive demands from Spanish regulators. More specifically, JCDecaux maintains major exposure in virtually every OOH market outside the U.S. and has been rumored to be interested in the company.</p><p>As for Lamar, it has a history of acquiring CCO's assets, including a $458.5 million transaction in 2016, and has publicly expressed potential interest in additional transactions. In addition, <span><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/BX/\">Blackstone</a><span><span></span></span></span>'s recent acquisition of New Tradition at 18x EBITDA, <span><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/BRK.B/\">Berkshire Hathaway</a><span><span></span></span></span>'s new position in Lamar, and Ares Management's 8% position in CCO, all underscore the private equity appetite for the OOH industry.â¯</p><p>Before coming to a decision like this, it is important to see what the standalone alternative looks like and why a sale may be more compelling for shareholders. To really properly restructure this business in the public market it would certainly require the time and risk of reconstituting the board and likely many management changes. Even with that, the company would still carry approximately $5 billion of long-term debt making it difficult to attract capital.</p><p>Additionally, CCO's promising digital transformation has been very slow. Since Legion's campaign, digital billboards have only grown to 5% of the portfolio, though they already count for over a third of CCO's revenue. While this underscores the huge value opportunity with digital conversion, it requires approvals of individual municipalities, significantly slowing the speed at which CCO can roll out digital ads, and not ideal for a public company that reports quarterly progress. As a result, after years of analysis and support, Anson has concluded that a sale offers the best risk adjusted path forward, a position we imagine Legion and other shareholders likely share.</p><p><em>Ken Squire is the founder and president of 13D Monitor, an institutional research service on shareholder activism, and the founder and portfolio manager of the 13D Activist Fund, a mutual fund that invests in a portfolio of activist 13D investments.</em></p></div>"

Â Â </p><p>Using an AI site called DeepSwap, the man secretly created deepfakes of the friends and over 80 women in the Twin Cities region. The discovery created emotional trauma and led the group to seek the help of a sympathetic state senator.</p><p>As a <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2025/09/27/nudify-ai-generated-deepfake-fbi.html\">CNBC investigation shows</a>, the rise of \"nudify\" apps and sites has made it easier than ever for people to create nonconsensual, explicit deepfakes. Experts said these services are all over the Internet, with many being promoted via Facebook ads, available for download on the Apple and Google app stores and easily accessed using simple web searches.</p><p>\"That's the reality of where the technology is right now, and that means that any person can really be victimized,\" said Haley McNamara, senior vice president of strategic initiatives and programs at the National Center on Sexual Exploitation.</p><p>CNBC's <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2025/09/27/nudify-ai-generated-deepfake-fbi.html\">reporting</a> shines a light on the legal quagmire surrounding AI, and how a group of friends became key figures in the fight against nonconsensual, AI-generated porn.</p><p>Here are five takeaways from the investigation.</p></div><h2><a></a>The women lack legal recourse</h2><div><p>Because the women weren't underage and the man who created the deepfakes never distributed the content, there was no apparent crime.</p><p>\"He did not break any laws that we're aware of,\" said Molly Kelley, one of the Minnesota victims and a law student. \"And that is problematic.\"</p><p>Now, Kelley and the women are advocating for a local bill in their state, proposed by Democratic state Senator Erin Maye Quade, intended to block nudify services in Minnesota. Should the bill become law, it would levy fines on the entities enabling the creation of the deepfakes.</p><p>Maye Quade said the bill is reminiscent of laws that prohibit peeping into windows to snap explicit photos without consent.</p><p>\"We just haven't grappled with the emergence of AI technology in the same way,\" Maye Quade said in an interview with CNBC, referring to the speed of AI development.</p></div><h2><a></a>The harm is real</h2><div><p>Jessica Guistolise, one of the Minnesota victims, said she continues to suffer from panic and anxiety stemming from the incident last year.</p><p>Sometimes, she said, a simple click of a camera shutter can cause her to lose her breath and begin trembling, her eyes swelling with tears. That's what happened at a conference she attended a month after first learning about the images.</p><p>\"I heard that camera click, and I was quite literally in the darkest corners of the internet,\" Guistolise said. \"Because I've seen myself doing things that are not me doing things.\"</p><p>Mary Anne Franks, professor at the George Washington University Law School, compared the experience to the feelings victims describe when talking about so-called revenge porn, or the posting of a person's sexual photos and videos online, often by a former romantic partner.</p><p>\"It makes you feel like you don't own your own body, that you'll never be able to take back your own identity,\" said Franks, who is also president of the Cyber Civil Rights Initiative, a nonprofit organization dedicated to combating online abuse and discrimination.</p></div><h2><a></a>Deepfakes are easier to create than ever</h2><div><p>Less than a decade ago, a person would need to be an AI expert to make explicit deepfakes. Thanks to nudifier services, all that's required is an internet connection and a Facebook photo.</p><p>Researchers said new AI models have helped usher in a wave of nudify services. The models are often bundled within easy-to-use apps, so that people lacking technical skills can create the content.</p><p>And while nudify services can contain disclaimers about obtaining consent, it's unclear whether there is any enforcement mechanism. Additionally, many nudify sites market themselves simply as so-called face-swapping tools.</p><p>\"There are apps that present as playful and they are actually primarily meant as pornographic in purpose,\" said Alexios Mantzarlis, an AI security expert at Cornell Tech. \"That's another wrinkle in this space.\"</p></div><h2><a></a>Nudify service DeepSwap is hard to find</h2><div><p>The site that was used to create the content is called DeepSwap, and there's not much information about it online.</p><p>In aÂ <a href=\"https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2025/07/14/3114645/0/en/DeepSwap-Redefines-the-Best-AI-Video-Generator-with-Industry-leading-Character-Consistency.html\" target=\"_blank\">press release</a>Â published in July, DeepSwap used a Hong Kong dateline and included a quote from Penyne Wu, who was identified in the release as CEO and co-founder. The media contact on the release was Shawn Banks, who was listed as marketing manager.Â </p><p>CNBC was unable to find information online about Wu, and sent multiple emails to the address provided for Banks, but received no response.</p><p>DeepSwap's website currently lists \"MINDSPARK AI LIMITED\" as its company name, provides an address in Dublin, and states that its terms of service are \"governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of Ireland.\"</p><p>However, in July, the same DeepSwap page had no mention of Mindspark, and references to Ireland instead said Hong Kong.Â </p></div><h2><a></a>AI's collateral damage</h2><div><div><p>Maye Quade's bill, which is still being considered, would fine tech companies that offer nudify services $500,000 for every nonconsensual, explicit deepfake that they generate in the state of Minnesota.</p><p>Some experts are concerned, however, that the Trump administration's plans to bolster the AI sector will undercut states' efforts. </p><p>In late July, Trump signed executive orders as part of the White House's<a href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Americas-AI-Action-Plan.pdf\" target=\"_blank\"> AI Action Plan</a>, underscoring AI development as a \"national security imperative.\"</p></div><p>Kelley hopes that any federal AI push doesn't jeopardize the efforts of the Minnesota women.</p></div><div><p><img src=\"https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/108202439-1758576040043-thumb_1.jpg?v=1758843887&w=750&h=422&vtcrop=y\" alt=\"The alarming rise of AI ânudifyâ apps that create explicit images of real people\" /><span></span><span><div><p><span>watch now</span><span></span></p></div></span></p></div></div>"

As linear TV has given way to streaming, studios are looking for ways to drive and sustain subscriber growth. For \"Gabby's Dollhouse,\" establishing a theatrical presence increases awareness of the brand, stirs up fresh excitement from existing fans and spurs new opportunities for products in the retail market.</p><p>\"Gabby's Dollhouse,\" created by \"Blue's Clues\" veterans Traci Paige Johnson and Jennifer Twomey, launched on <span><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/NFLX/\">Netflix</a><span><span></span></span></span> in 2021. It's already run for 11 seasons, and a 12th is on due out in November. Each season has six to 10 episodes, about 25 minutes each.</p><p>It's been the most-viewed streaming original series for kids this year, according to Nielsen.</p><p>Each episode begins with a live-action Gabby, played by Laila Lockhart Kraner, as she unboxes a miniature package that sparks an adventure in her magical dollhouse. She dons her cat-ear headband, shrinks down to become an animated character and joins her cat friends, called Gabby's cats. Like a lot of preschool shows, Gabby pauses to ask the audience questions and invite them to play along.</p><p>Those elements all appear in the full-length feature film, which arrived in theaters Friday. It melds animation and live-action, but at a bigger scale.</p><p>Cohn said the goal was to create a theatrical experience, akin to a \"'Rocky Horror Picture Show' for little kids.' Invite them to sing, dance, clap.\"</p><p>\"Gabby's Dollhouse: The Movie\" debuts at a time when the movie calendar has limited family-friendly options. The most recent major releases in this genre were Disney's \"Freakier Friday\" and Universal's \"The Bad Guys 2,\" both of which were released in early August.</p><p>While there has been a steady stream of family-friendly fare in recent years, it comes after a considerable dry spell caused by the pandemic and dual Hollywood labor strikes shutting down production. At the same time, consumers' habits shifted as streaming services grew in popularity and studios shortened the time it took for movies released in cinemas to reach the home market.</p><p>But younger viewers are some of the most engaged, and a primary driver to get families out to the theater.</p><p>Kids are some of the most fervent streaming users, too, as they tend to watch the same content over and over again, leading to high engagement. That's why <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2025/07/18/kids-content-streaming-companies-chase-profits.html\">kid-friendly shows have offer a unique value proposition</a> for studios even as traditional linear television and the theatrical landscape has become less reliable.</p><p>Presenting their favorite characters in more places can mean spreading the wealth and ultimately fueling their appetites for more.</p><p>\"One need only look at the big screen-small screen synergies that were created by 'KPop Demon Hunters' to see how 'Gabby's Dollhouse: The Movie' could similarly make the leap from a small screen 2021 series into a big screen cinematic event in 2025,\" said Paul Dergarabedian, senior media analyst at Comscore.</p></div><h2><a></a>Heading to the big screen</h2><div><p>A global theatrical release not only serves the strong domestic market, but extends the reach of \"Gabby's Dollhouse\" internationally. Cohn noted that Europe is one region where the show is gaining traction.</p><p>\"As a relatively new franchise with notable reach into the marketing world aimed at today's youngest generations, this is a film that should capture the interest of that audience and continue showcasing its strengths as a fresh brand,\" said Shawn Robbins, director of analytics at Fandango and founder of Box Office Theory.</p><p>And it can be a relatively affordable way to extend a franchise's reach.</p><p>\"Gabby's Dollhouse: The Movie\" had a production budget of just over $30 million, a small investment for the likes of Universal and DreamWorks Animation compared to other theatrical kids films. For example, franchise films from Disney's Pixar and Universal's other animation arm, Illumination, can cost upwards of $200 million to create.</p></div><div><p>Still from Universal and Dreamworks Animation's \"Gabby's Dollhouse: The Movie.\"</p><p>Universal | Dreamworks Animation</p></div><div><p>\"At DreamWorks, we know how to make a budget fit,\" Cohn said. \"We make some really big, high-budget, all-audience animated films. But then we also do smaller films like 'Captain Underpants' or the most recent one with 'Dog Man.' We know how to make high-quality movies for a lower price point.\"</p><p><span><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/PSKY/\">Paramount's</a><span><span></span></span></span> two Paw Patrol films had similarly small budgets, according to media reports. \"Paw Patrol: The Movie,\" released in 2021, generated $40 million domestically and more than $145 million globally, according to data from Comscore. Meanwhile, 2023's \"Paw Patrol: The Mighty Movie\" collected $65 million domestically and $200 globally.</p><p>Universal estimated that \"Gabby's Dollhouse: The Movie\" snared $13.7 million in domestic ticket sales during its opening weekend. That's just shy of the $15 million to $25 million that box office analysts had predicted.</p></div><h2><a></a>More than just a movie</h2><div><p>While theatrical revenues are important, bringing \"Gabby's Dollhouse\" to the big screen is part of a wider strategy. The content is part of an interconnected ecosystem that includes toys, books, merchandise and live events.</p><p>\"I came from Nickelodeon,\" Cohn said. \"We studied the audience a lot, and we knew that they liked to watch a show, but then they wanted to play it, iterate on it, and experience the characters and ideas in their own way, in their own form. And so we developed the Gabby franchise to let them do just that.\"</p><p>DreamWorks partnered with toy company <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/\">Spin Master</a> to manufacture a line of toys tied to \"Gabby's Dollhouse.\" The range of products includes playsets, figures, plush toys, games and puzzles. Since launching the line, Spin Master has sold four million dollhouses tied to the show.</p><p>Cohn said DreamWorks Animation \"nurtured and brewed success\" for \"Gabby's Dollhouse\" with through the Spin Master partnership as well as through the production of YouTube shorts, grassroots marketing and a traveling live show presented by <span><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/WMT/\">Walmart</a><span><span></span></span></span>.</p><p>\"The series just grew and grew and grew,\" Cohn said. \"And then it gets to a certain point you're able to deliver on bigger strategic franchise expansion with live entertainment and shows in museums and presence in the parks and music, you know, all that comes when you have a property that kids respond to.\"</p><p>\"Gabby's Dollhouse\" has been a top five preschool toy property for five of the last eight quarters, according to data from Circana. It has been a top 10 property for 10 straight quarters.</p><p>In addition to toys, \"Gabby's Dollhouse\" has merchandise collections with Walmart, <span><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/TGT/\">Target</a><span><span></span></span></span> and <span><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/AMZN/\">Amazon,</a><span><span></span></span></span> that include apparel, home goods, games and even toothbrushes. As the film heads to theaters, audiences will be able to buy <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2025/02/16/popcorn-buckets-big-business-for-movie-theaters.html\">themed popcorn buckets</a>, drink tumblers and other specialty items.</p><p>The franchise has also become part of Universal's theme parks, with character meet-and-greets with Gabby and retail areas where guests can buy headbands, plush and apparel.</p><p>And Universal isn't stopping there. \"Gabby's Dollhouse: The Movie\" sets up a bigger future for Gabby and a potential spin-off series. As the film credits roll, Gabby puts the finishing touches on a new dollhouse â a dog dollhouse that she says her little sister will love.</p><p>When asked about what \"Gabby Dollhouse\" fans can expect following the reveal, Cohn teased, \"You're gonna have to wait and see.\"</p><p><em>Disclosure: Comcast is the parent company of Fandango and NBCUniversal, which owns CNBC. Versant would become the new parent company of Fandango and CNBC upon Comcast's planned spinoff of Versant.</em></p></div></div>"
