(Photo by Costfoto/NurPhoto via Getty Images)</p><p>Costfoto| Nurphoto | Getty Images</p></div><div><p>The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development upgraded its global economic growth forecast on Tuesday, with many economies appearing more resilient than expected so far this year.</p><p>The OECD now expects global growth of 3.2% this year, compared to the 2.9% expansion it had forecast in June. Expectations for 2026 were unchanged at 2.9%. This would mark a slowdown from the 3.3% growth seen in 2024.</p><p>Growth expectations for the U.S. were also lifted, to 1.8% for 2025, compared to June's 1.6% estimate. This still marks a significant fall from 2024's 2.8% growth, however. The organization forecasts 1.5% growth for the U.S. in 2026.</p><p>\"Global growth was more resilient than anticipated in the first half of 2025, especially in many emerging-market economies,\" the organisation said in a new report.</p><p>\"Industrial production and trade were supported by front-loading ahead of higher tariffs. Strong AI-related investment boosted outcomes in the United States and fiscal support in China outweighed the drag from trade headwinds and property market weakness,\" it noted.</p><p>Alvaro Pereira, chief economist of the OECD, on Tuesday told CNBC's Charlotte Reed that individual economic events in emerging markets including Brazil, Indonesia and India also boosted the world economy.</p><p>\"But to be honest with you, for most of our forecasts we have not changed significantly the forecast for virtually all the G20 countries and we still expect a slowing in the second part of the year after this front loading took place in the first quarter,\" he said.</p></div><h2><a></a>Tariff impact still to come</h2><div><p>The OECD warned, however, that \"significant risks to the economic outlook remain,\" as investment and trade continue to be hit by high levels of policy uncertainty and elevated tariffs.</p><p>Sweeping duties on goods entering the U.S. came into effect in August after months of policy changes, temporary pauses, and threats from U.S. President Donald Trump.</p><p>Countries and regions around the world now face tariff rates as high as 50% on their exports to the U.S., with some still trying to negotiate trade frameworks.</p><p>\"US bilateral tariff rates have increased on almost all countries since May. The overall effective US tariff rate rose to an estimated 19.5% at the end of August, the highest rate since 1933,\" the OECD said.</p><p>\"The full effects of tariff increases have yet to be felt – with many changes being phased in over time and companies initially absorbing some tariff increases through margins – but are becoming increasingly visible in spending choices, labour markets and consumer prices,\" it added.</p><p>Labour markets are showing signs of softening as some countries see higher unemployment and fewer job openings, according to the report, while the disinflation process appears to have flattened.</p><p>The OECD's Pereira said that \"the tariff shock is bringing more inflationary pressures in many countries.\"</p><p>\"We expect it will be additional price impacts for firms not only in the United States but other parts of the world too,\" he said.</p><p>The OECD now expects headline inflation to amount to 3.4% across G20 countries in 2025, slightly lower than June's 3.6% projection. Inflation expectations for the U.S. were revised down more sharply, with the OECD now forecasting price rises of 2.7% in 2025, down from the previous 3.2% forecast.</p><p>Looking ahead, further tariff increases and a return of inflationary pressures were flagged in the organization's report as two key risks, alongside growing concerns about the fiscal situation and the possibility of repricing in financial markets.</p><p>\"High and volatile crypto-asset valuations also raise financial stability risks given growing interconnectedness with the traditional financial system. On the upside, reductions in trade restrictions or faster development and adoption of artificial intelligence technologies could strengthen growth prospects,\" the OECD noted.</p></div></div>"

    "body": "<div><p>Stephen Miran, chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers, following a television interview outside the White House in Washington, DC, US, on Tuesday, June 17, 2025. </p><p>Aaron Schwartz | Bloomberg | Getty Images</p></div><div><p>Less than a week after taking his seat, Federal Reserve Governor Stephen Miran on Monday outlined the reasons why he thinks the central bank's benchmark interest rate is far too high and should be lowered aggressively.</p><p>Changes in tax and immigration policy along with easing rental costs, deregulation and incoming revenue for tariffs are creating a different economic landscape that allow the Fed to cut its benchmark rate by nearly 2 percentage points from its current level, the central banker said in remarks before the Economic Club of New York.</p><p>\"The Federal Reserve has been entrusted with the important goal of promoting price stability for the good of all American households and businesses, and I am committed to bringing inflation sustainably back to 2 percent,\" he said. \"However, leaving policy restrictive by such a large degree brings significant risks for the Fed's employment mandate.\"</p><p>Miran sees the confluence of policy changes from the White House lowering the neutral level of interest that neither restricts nor promotes growth. In remarks heavy with data and citations on theory and interest rate models such as the Taylor Rule, Miran said current monetary policy is significantly more restrictive than the prevailing attitude among his fellow policymakers.</p><p>Using standard policy rules, Miran thinks the federal funds rate, a level that banks charge each other for overnight lending but that influences a wide variety of other rates, should be in the low-2% area. The current funds rate following last week's reduction is targeted between 4%-4.25%.</p><p>\"The upshot is that monetary policy is well into restrictive territory,\" he said. \"Leaving short-term interest rates roughly 2 percentage points too tight risks unnecessary layoffs and higher unemployment.\"</p><p>The views, however, put Miran well outside consensus on the Federal Open Market Committee, where the current approach advocates more caution and a tepid move lower in rates over the next several years.</p><p>At its <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2025/09/17/fed-rate-decision-september-2025.html\">meeting last week</a>, the FOMC voted 11-1 to lower by a quarter percentage point. Miran was the sole dissenter, opting for a half-point cut and putting his individual dot on the committee's \"dot plot\" of expectations in a place that would imply another 1.25 percentage points in reductions this year.</p><p>Earlier Monday, St. Louis Fed President Alberto Musalem, who like Miran is a voter on the FOMC this year, said <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2025/09/22/st-louis-fed-president-musalem-sees-limited-room-for-more-interest-rate-cuts.html\">he sees little room</a> for further cuts. Likewise, Atlanta President Raphael Bostic — who doesn't vote this year — also told The Wall Street Journal he would not support further reductions this year.</p><p>President Donald Trump appointed Miran to the Fed position following former Governor Adriana Kugler's surprise resignation in early August. Like Trump, Miran has been a harsh Fed critic, though he and others described the air at the meeting as collegial and professional.</p><p>Miran pressed his case Monday for lower rates, insisting that inflation is on its way down, particularly in the housing market where cooling rents that had not shown up in the data now will become more apparent.</p><p>Though pushing for cuts, Miran said he is optimistic about economic growth, two positions that under conventional thinking would be at odds. </p><p>\"My view is that policy is roughly 2 points too restrictive, which is considerably restrictive,\" he said during a question-and-answer session after his speech. \"Even though I am expecting growth to be a little better in the future, that could get derailed unnecessarily so and create an output gap where one need not exist if we don't get policy closer to neutral.\"</p><p>He further cited other administration policies, such as its clamp down on immigration, its move to lower business regulations and cut taxes, and the revenue that will be generated from tariffs and its impact on the budget deficit as disinflationary factors.</p><p>\"Labor market statistics and anecdotal evidence suggest border policy is exerting a major impact on the economy,\" he said. \"America's regulatory patchwork has become a material impediment to growth.\"</p><p>Economists at the Fed and elsewhere continue to worry that Trump's tariffs will have a longer-term upward push on inflation. However, Miran said \"relatively small changes in some goods prices have led to what I view as unreasonable levels of concern.\"</p><p>Recent inflation readings, though, have shown prices moving higher and further away from the Fed's 2% inflation mandate.</p><p>Miran is expected to fill the remainder of a term that expires in Jan. 31, 2026, then move back to his position as chair of the Council of Economic Advisers. He peppered his speech with references to CEA research.</p></div>"

New Delhi's \"Semiconductor Mission\" aims to change that.</p><p>The ambition is bold. It wants to create a full supply chain — from design to fabrication, testing and packaging — on Indian soil.</p><p>As of this month, the country has approved 10 semiconductor projects with total investment of 1.6 trillion rupees ($18.2 billion). These include two semiconductor fabrication plants, and multiple testing and packing factories.</p><p>India also has a pool of engineering talent that is already employed by global chip design companies.</p><p>Yet progress so far has been uneven, and neither the investments nor talent pool is enough to make India's chip ambitions a reality, say experts.</p><p>\"India needs more than a few fabs or ATP facilities (i.e., more than a few \"shiny objects.\") It needs a dynamic and deep and long-term ecosystem,\" said Stephen Ezell, vice president for global innovation policy at the Information Technology and Innovation Foundation, a science and technology policy think tank.</p><p>Ezell says that leading semiconductor manufacturers consider \"as many as 500 discrete factors\" before they set up multi-billion-dollar fab investments. These include talent, tax, trade, technology policies, labor rates and laws and customs policies — all areas where India has work to do.</p></div><h2><a></a>New Delhi's policy push</h2><div><p>In May, the Indian government added a new element to its chip ambition: a scheme to support electronic component manufacturing, addressing a critical bottleneck.</p><p>Until now, chipmakers had no local demand for their product as there are hardly any electronic component manufacturing companies, such as phone camera companies, in India.</p></div><div><p>Researchers inside the semiconductor fabrication lab at the Centre for Nano Science and Engineering, at the Indian Institute of Science, in Bangalore.</p><p>Manjunath Kiran | Afp | Getty Images</p></div><div><p>But the new policy offers financial support to companies producing active and passive electronic components, creating a potential domestic buyer-supplier base that chip manufacturers can plug into.</p><p>In 2022, the country also pivoted from its strategy of providing superior incentives to fabrication units making chips of 28nm or less. When it comes to chips, the smaller the size, the higher the performance with improved energy efficiency. These chips can be used in new technologies like advanced AI and quantum computing by packing more transistors into the same space.</p><p>But this approach wasn't helping India develop its nascent semiconductor industry, so New Delhi now covers 50% of the project costs of all fabrication units, regardless of chip size, and of chip testing and packing units.</p><p>Fab companies from Taiwan and the U.K., and semiconductor packaging companies from the U.S. and South Korea have all shown interest in aiding India's semiconductor ambitions.</p><p>\"The Indian government has doled out generous incentives to attract semiconductor manufacturers to India,\" said Ezell, but he stressed that \"those sorts of investments aren't sustainable forever.\"</p></div><h2><a></a>The long road</h2><div><p>The biggest chip project in India currently is the 910-billion-rupee ($11 billion) semiconductor fabrication plant being built in Prime Minister Narendra Modi's home state of Gujarat by Tata Electronics, in partnership with Taiwan's Powerchip Semiconductor Manufacturing Corp.</p><p>The unit will make chips for power management integrated circuits, display drivers, microcontrollers and high-performance computing logic, <a href=\"https://www.tataelectronics.com/w/manufacturing-corporation-psmc-complete-landmark-agreement-for-technology-transfer-to-build-india-s-first-semiconductor-fab\" target=\"_blank\">Tata Electronics said</a>, which can be used in AI, automotive, computing and data storage industries.</p><p>The U.K.'s Clas-SiC Wafer Fab has also tied up with India's SiCSem to set up the country's first commercial compound fab in the eastern state of Odisha.</p><p>These compound semiconductors can be used in missiles, defence equipment, electric vehicles, consumer appliances and solar power inverters, according to a government press release.</p><p>\"The coming 3-4 years is pivotal for advancing India's semiconductor goals,\" said Sujay Shetty, managing director of semiconductor at PwC India.</p><p>Establishing operational silicon fabrication facilities and overcoming technical and infrastructural hurdles that extend beyond incentives will be a key milestone, according to Shetty.</p></div><h2><a></a>Opportunities beyond fab</h2><div><p>Fabrication sites need to meet stringent requirements, such as being in areas free from floods and vibrations, with reliable road connectivity — which can present ongoing logistical considerations for some regions.</p><p>India also needs specialty chemical suppliers that meet \"ultra-high purity standards essential for advanced semiconductor manufacturing,\" Shetty added.</p><p>Beyond chip fabrication plants, many medium-sized companies in India have shown interest in setting up chip testing and packaging units. Several Indian groups are also entering the segment, attracted by its higher margins and lower capital intensity compared to fabs.</p><p>\"Outsourced semiconductor assembly and testing (OSAT) represents a significant opportunity for India, though clarifying market access and demand channels will be important for sustained growth,\" says Shetty.</p><p>Success in this area will see India enter the global chip industry, but New Delhi is still a long way from locally developing and manufacturing the cutting-edge of chip technology: 2nm semiconductors.</p><p>These 2nm chips offer better performance and power efficiency due to their smaller transistor size. Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Corporation will start mass-producing cutting-edge 2nm chips later this year, <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/8fd79522-e34f-4633-bc87-ef0aae2d9159\" target=\"_blank\">according to an FT report</a>.</p></div><div><p>NEW DELHI, INDIA - MAY 14: Union Minister of Railways, Information and Broadcasting, Electronics and Information Technology Ashwini Vaishnaw  briefing the media on Cabinet decisions at National Media Centre  on May 14, 2025 in New Delhi, India. </p><p>Hindustan Times | Hindustan Times | Getty Images</p></div><div><p>Last week, Indian minister Ashwini Vaishnaw, who was in Bengaluru to inaugurate a new office of semiconductor design firm ARM, said the British company will design the \"most advanced chips used in AI servers, drones, mobile phone chips of 2 nm\" from the south Indian city.</p><p>But experts say the role of local talent is likely to be limited to non-core design testing and validation, as the core intellectual property for chip designs is often held in locations like the U.S. or Singapore, where established IP regimes support such activities.</p><p>\"India has sufficient talent in design space, because unlike semiconductor manufacturing and testing that has come up in the last 2 years, design has been there since 1990s,\" said Jayanth BR, a recruiter with over 15 years of experience in hiring for global semiconductor companies in India.</p><p>He said global companies usually outsource \"block-level\" design validation work to India.</p><p>Going beyond this is something India's government will need to solve if it wants to fulfil its semiconductor ambitions.</p><p>\"India may consider updating its IP laws to address new forms of IP, like digital content and software. Of course, improving enforcement mechanisms will go a long way in protecting IP rights,\" says Sajai Singh, a partner at Mumbai-based JSA Advocates & Solicitors.</p><p>\"Our competition is with countries like the U.S., Europe, and Taiwan, which not only have strong IP laws, but also a more established ecosystem for chip design.\"</p></div></div>"
