Five years ago, like many people, Sunga took up baking during the pandemic \"and just fell in love with it,\" she tells CNBC Make It.</p><p>Then, about a year ago, her sweet tooth got the best of her: \"I really wanted to eat a lot of cake, to be honest,\" she says. \"But at the same time, I didn't want to bake all of the cake, and so I thought to myself, 'What if I just created an event, and the requirement was everyone coming needed to bring a whole cake?'\"</p><p>Thus began her idea of Cake Picnic, where the main rule is \"no cake, no entry.\"</p><p>Sunga initially posted her plans for an informal cake gathering on Instagram thinking 15 people would show up.</p><p>As it turns out, a lot more people wanted in on the sweet chaos. \"Every time I would refresh the RSVP page,\" Sunga says, \"it would just be up 50, 100, 150, 200. It capped at 300.\"</p><p>In April 2024, she hosted her first Cake Picnic event in San Francisco with 183 cakes.</p></div><div><p>Cake Picnic is the brainchild of Elisa Sunga, a San Francisco tech worker who picked up baking during the pandemic and wanted to throw an event for fellow dessert enthusiasts.</p><p>Anadolu | Getty Images</p></div><div><p>Throughout the year, Sunga took Cake Picnic on tour to Los Angeles and New York before hosting a second San Francisco stop in the fall. Things really took off during a March 2025 event, where people brought and tasted over 1,300 cakes at San Francisco's Legion of Honor.</p><p>Cake Picnic's Instagram page went from 20,000 followers to over 100,000 within a day, Sunga says.</p><p>\"It literally changed the Cake Picnic game,\" she says.</p></div><h2><a></a>Why people are drawn to Cake Picnic</h2><div><p>What motivates hundreds of people at a time to bake an entire cake to share with strangers at a park?</p><p>Sunga points to the unique experience, for one. \"It's the opportunity to just see hundreds of cakes at one time, where you have the opportunity to eat a matcha cake, a raspberry cake, an ube cake, a chocolate cake, all in the span of three minutes,\" she says. \"When do you ever really get a cake buffet experience like that?\"</p><p>Events also bring together the baking community, Sunga adds, from beginners to pastry chefs. \"No matter what skills you have, we are all truly just here because we love cake,\" she says.</p></div><div><p>1,387 cakes counted during the massive cake picnic at the Legion Of Honor as hundreds of people attended in San Francisco, California, United States on March 29, 2025.</p><p>Anadolu | Getty Images</p></div><div><p>Gatherings are a source of inspiration where bakers see how other experiment with flavors and designs.</p><p>Then, there's the joy of it all. \"You are attending this event because you love cake, you probably bake, you choose happiness and joy and delightful things,\" Sunga says. \"So the people that come to Cake Picnic are like friends of your heart.\"</p></div><h2><a></a>Keeping up with a growing passion project</h2><div><p>Sunga works on Cake Picnic a few hours each week on nights and weekends, with hours swelling in the weeks leading up to an event date. The project's team consists of Sunga's partner and co-founder, Danny Knight, and a network of friends and collaborators across the U.S.</p><p>Cake Picnic also relies on volunteers in each tour city to bring events to life on the day-of.</p><p>Sunga says managing a sprawling team has helped her practice communication, leadership and delegation skills. \"Ultimately, I think that it's just so fun that our project is cake\" and so \"I don't mind working on it 6 to 9 p.m. every day.\"</p><p>Sunga aims to standardize event tickets to $30 across all tour stops in order to pay herself and Knight for the time they spend on the project (she declined to share how much she and Knight draw from sales). They're also getting to the point of bringing in some profit, Sunga says, which she wants to invest back into the cake community like by commissioning artists to create pieces for events.</p><p>At this time, Sunga has no plans of making Cake Picnic her full-time job but hopes to grow a team to be able to manage it globally.</p><p>Leaning into the project full-time would change her relationship to the joy it brings her, she says.</p><p>\"Initially, I started Cake Picnic because I wanted to eat cakes, and I wanted to meet baker friends,\" Sunga says. \"I think that if I did it full time, that would change how I feel about the event. Like, rather than being excited about eating cake and meeting friends, it would be focused on, like, how do I grow this thing?\"</p><p>Plus, she adds, she likes her job at Google, where she works on community and learning initiatives, which \"keeps me happy.\"</p></div><div><p>Cake Picnic is a gathering for the love of cake and celebrates cake in all of its forms as brings communities and friends together for the sole purpose of breaking cake and enjoying the following butter and sugar highs. </p><p>Anadolu | Getty Images</p></div><h2><a></a>'It's such an honor for me'</h2><div><p>So far, Cake Picnic has hosted seven events featuring over 3,500 cakes. It held its first international picnic in London in July, where guests brought over 400 cakes.</p><p>Tickets for the next event on Saturday in LA sold out in seconds, Sunga says, and resulted in a 11,000-person wait list.</p><p>Attendees have come from out-of-state and countries around the world like Malaysia, Singapore, South Africa, Kuwait, Spain and Ireland, to name a few.</p><p>The project will head to Minneapolis, San Francisco and New York later in the fall.</p><p>Cake Picnic's rapid growth continues to be \"pretty mind-boggling,\"<strong> </strong>Sunga says. \"It's such an honor for me. We have so many options of what we could be doing with our time. There's concerts, there's dinners, there's brunches, there's rotting time at home. And it's such an honor that people are like, 'I'm gonna come to Cake Picnic.'\"</p><p><em><strong>Want to be your own boss?</strong> Sign up for Smarter by CNBC Make It's new online course, </em><a href=\"https://smarter.cnbcmakeit.com/p/how-to-start-a-business-for-first-time-founders?utm_source=cnbc&utm_medium=makeitarticle&utm_campaign=bottom\" target=\"_blank\"><em>How To Start A Business: For First-Time Founders</em></a><em>.

That is a 0.2% drop from July and an increase of 1.8% from August of last year. Sales were strongest in the Midwest and weakest in the Northeast.</p><p>This count is based on closings, so people signing their deals in June and July, when mortgage rates were about 50 basis points higher than they are today. Rates began dropping sharply at the start of September, which would not figure into these numbers.  </p><p>The upper end of the market is moving better than the lower end. Sales of homes priced above $1 million gained 8% year over year, the top performer. Sales of homes priced below $100,000, however, dropped more than 10% from a year ago. </p><p>\"Record-high housing wealth and a record-high stock market will help current homeowners trade up and benefit the upper end of the market. However, sales of affordable homes are constrained by the lack of inventory,\" said Lawrence Yun, chief economist for the Realtors, in a release.</p><p>The Midwest was the best-performing region in August, NAR said, noting affordable market conditions.

It is also the largest one-month gain since August 2022. Sales were 15.4% higher than August 2024.</p><p>This count is based on people out shopping in August and signing deals, when the average rate on the 30-year fixed mortgage was higher than it is today. That rate started August at 6.63%, according to Mortgage News Daily, and didn't really move much during the month.</p><p>The sharp decline in rates began in September, when it <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2025/09/16/mortgage-rates-drop-to-3-year-low-ahead-of-fed-meeting.html\">fell to a three-year low</a> of 6.13% the day before the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2025/09/17/fed-rate-decision-september-2025.html\">Federal Reserve cut its lending rate</a>, and then moved higher to where it is now at 6.37%.</p><p>Given that rates hadn't fallen yet, it's curious that August sales jumped so high.

In a separate survey on builder sentiment from the National Association of Home Builders, 39% of builders reported cutting prices in September, up from 37% in August and the highest percentage in the post-Covid period.</p><p>New home sales were strongest in the Northeast, where overall new construction is low, so swings can be large. It was also strong in the South, where homebuilding is busiest. Sales, while higher, were weakest in the West, where prices are highest.</p><p>\"While a volatile figure each month and always best to smooth out, I have to believe that the elevated level of home builder incentives was the main catalyst for the large upside surprise to new home sales,\" wrote Peter Boockvar, chief investment officer of One Point BFG Wealth Partner.  \"And we'll, of course, see the impact of lower mortgage rates when the September figure comes out, but keep in mind, if mortgage rates continue down ... builders will then reduce the pace at which they are implementing incentives and thus possibly offsetting the benefit of lower mortgage rates for new homes.\"</p><p>Strong sales took inventory down to a 7.4-month supply in August from a nine-month supply in July, a nearly 18% drop. Single-family housing starts and permits slowed in August both from July and from August of last year. This would seem to indicate that builders expected slower sales.</p></div></div>"

But even one of the remaining plans — known as the <a href=\"https://studentaid.gov/help-center/answers/article/ibr-plan\" target=\"_blank\">Income-Based Repayment plan</a>, or IBR — is proving hard to access.</p><p>\"Applications are being rejected without clear or logical explanations,\" said Carolina Rodriguez, director of the Education Debt Consumer Assistance Program. Rodriguez and her team members work with clients with student loans.</p><p>\"These ongoing delays continue to erode public trust in the student loan system and are likely to worsen the delinquency and default rates we're already seeing,\" Rodriguez said.</p><p>IBR will be one of only a few repayment options left to many borrowers after recent court actions and the passage by Congress of President <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/donald-trump/\">Donald Trump</a>'s \"<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/guide/what-trumps-one-big-beautiful-bill-means-for-your-money/\">big beautiful bill</a>.\" That legislation phases out several existing student loan repayment plans.</p><p>Here's what student loan borrowers need to know about the challenges with IBR.</p></div><h2><a></a>IBR debt forgiveness is still frozen</h2><div><p>Over the summer, the U.S. Department of Education announced that it would temporarily stop forgiving the debt of borrowers enrolled in IBR. According to the plan's terms, IBR concludes in debt erasure after 20 years or 25 years of payments, depending on the age of a borrower's loans.</p><p>The Education Department told CNBC in July that it paused loan forgiveness under IBR while it responds to recent court actions involving the Biden administration-era SAVE, or Saving on a Valuable Education, plan.</p><p>The department said that the 8th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2025/02/18/us-appeals-court-blocks-biden-save-plan-for-student-loans.html\">decision</a> in February, which blocked the SAVE plan, had other impacts on student loan repayment. For example, under the rule involving SAVE, certain periods during which borrowers postponed their payments would count toward their forgiveness timeline. With SAVE blocked now, borrowers no longer get credit during those forbearances.</p><p><strong>More from Personal Finance:</strong><br /><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2025/09/11/social-security-cola-cost-of-living-adjustment-may-be-higher-in-2026-estimates.html\">Social Security cost-of-living adjustment may be slightly higher in 2026</a><br /><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2025/09/10/no-tax-on-tips-deduction-who-qualifies.html\">Some jobs may not qualify for the 'no tax on tips' policy</a><br /><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2025/09/10/trump-student-loan-risks.html\">Trump administration to warn families about student debt risks</a></p><p>\"The Department has temporarily paused discharges for IBR borrowers in order to correctly count loan forgiveness amounts under a court injunction regarding the Biden Administration's illegal SAVE repayment plan,\" said Ellen Keast, deputy press secretary at the Education Department.</p><p>\"For any borrower that makes a payment after they became eligible for forgiveness, the Department will refund overpayments when the discharges resume,\" Keast said.</p><p>Earlier this month, the department wrote on its website that the system changes to IBR could take until \"<a href=\"https://studentaid.gov/announcements-events/big-updates\" target=\"_blank\">winter 2025</a>.\"</p><p>\"More than enough time has passed for the Department to fix whatever issues were supposedly affecting IBR forgiveness,\" said higher education expert Mark Kantrowitz. \"That suggests the holdup is intentional.\"</p><p>The pause puts many student loan borrowers who've been in repayment for decades and are now eligible for forgiveness in an especially frustrating bind, Kantrowitz said. IBR is the only income-driven repayment plan still available that leads to loan erasure, he said.</p></div><h2><a></a>Wrongful IBR denials</h2><div><p>When lawmakers <a href=\"https://www.nasfaa.org/uploads/documents/Federal_Student_Aid_Change_OB3.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">phased out several student loan repayment plans</a> over the summer in the <a href=\"https://www.congress.gov/bill/119th-congress/house-bill/1/text\" target=\"_blank\">One Big Beautiful Bill Act</a>, they made a change to IBR aimed at expanding people's eligibility for the program. Experts say that's likely because many borrowers would need access to the plan after the other options became defunct or are set to expire.</p><p>The change eliminated the former requirement that borrowers prove a partial financial hardship to qualify for IBR. In the past, borrowers needed to show, based on their income, that their monthly IBR payment would be less than their bill on the department's standard plan.</p><p>However, \"borrowers are still being rejected due to their income,\" said Elaine Rubin, director of corporate communications at Edvisors.</p><p>Kantrowitz said the same: \"I've heard that some borrowers were denied IBR even though the change was supposed to be effective upon enactment on July 4, 2025.\"</p></div><div><p>There are similar accounts in the American Federation of Teacher's <a href=\"https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.dcd.278527/gov.uscourts.dcd.278527.41.0.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">lawsuit</a> against the U.S. Department of Education. The union, which represents some 2 million members, has said the Trump administration is depriving borrowers of their rights.</p><p>One plaintiff, who owes approximately $252,659 in federal student loan debt, has been paying for over 25 years, according to a September court filing in the AFT legal challenge. The woman applied for IBR in July but said that she was denied in August \"on the grounds that she does not have a 'partial financial hardship,' which has not been a requirement for the IBR plan since the enactment of the One Big Beautiful Bill Act,\" the AFT said.</p><p>\"The Department therefore improperly denied her access to a payment plan for which she is eligible and is withholding loan cancellation,\" the union said.</p></div></div>"

The 2023 data is the most recent year included in the study.</p><p>U.S. Latino gross domestic product, measuring the economic impact of the cohort, was up 50% in 2023 from 2015, boosted by increasing education, entrepreneurship and labor force participation, said economists with Arizona State University, who conducted the research. For comparison, the estimated GDP of non-Latinos in the U.S. grew by 17% over the same time frame.</p><p>The report comes as the Trump administration is charging ahead with an unprecedented effort to <a href=\"https://www.dhs.gov/news/2025/09/23/new-milestone-over-2-million-illegal-aliens-out-united-states-less-250-days\" target=\"_blank\">remove undocumented immigrants from the U.S.</a></p><p>California's economy alone saw $989 billion of Latino GDP in 2023 and is projected to surpass a trillion dollars in 2025, according to the report. Texas, Florida and New York each also have Latino GDPs worth hundreds of billions of dollars.</p><p>And Latino spending is making up a larger share of the overall economy.</p><p>As baby boomers age, their share of spending declines by about 4% annually, according to the report, and U.S. Latinos are poised to fill the spending gap. Their share of U.S. consumption is growing by more than 3% annually. Actual consumer spending is up nearly 5% annually compared with 2.4% for non-Latinos, driven by population changes and a rise in disposable income.</p><p>\"It's very clear — if there's a silver bullet for the economy beyond [artificial intelligence], it's the Latino consumer.
