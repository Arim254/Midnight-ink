While the federal government oversees those servicers, most borrowers shouldn't have issues getting the assistance they need during the shutdown unless they have a problem with their servicer.</p><p>\"The Education Department itself is not servicing your loan.

    "body": "<div><p>Private payrolls saw their biggest decline in 2½ years during September, a further sign of labor market weakening that compounds the data blackout accompanying the U.S. government shutdown.</p><p>Companies shed a seasonally adjusted 32,000 jobs during the month, the biggest slide since March 2023, payrolls processing firm ADP reported Wednesday. Economists surveyed by Dow Jones had been looking for an increase of 45,000.</p><p>In addition to the drop in September, the August payrolls number was revised to a loss of 3,000 from an initially reported increase of 54,000.</p><p>The report comes as the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2025/10/01/government-shutdown-trump-live-updates.html\">funding impasse in Washington, D.C.</a>, has led to the first government closure since late 2018 into early 2019. Failing a deal over the next two days, the Bureau of Labor Statistics' nonfarm payrolls report for September will not be released, nor will the Labor Department put out the weekly jobless claims count on Thursday. The last time the BLS payrolls report was delayed was in 2013.</p><p>Federal Reserve officials count on the payrolls releases as they make decisions on interest rates. The Fed next meets Oct. 28-29, meaning there won't be another payrolls report before then.</p><p>ADP's count, then, takes on added significance as markets widely expect the central bank to cut another quarter point off its key borrowing rate.</p><p>Job losses spread across sectors during September, offset by a 33,000 increase in education and health services as schools reopened and health care continued its long streak of hiring.</p><p>Elsewhere, leisure and hospitality, a key sector for consumer demand, saw a loss of 19,000 as vacation season wound down. The other services category posted a drop of 16,000, while professional and business services was off 13,000, trade, transportation and utilities declined by 7,000, and construction lost 5,000.</p><p>On a broad scale, service providers decreased 28,000 and goods producers shed 3,000. Businesses with fewer than 50 employees lost 40,000, while companies with 500 or more employees added 33,000.</p><p>\"Despite the strong economic growth we saw in the second quarter, this month's release further validates<br />what we've been seeing in the labor market, that U.S. employers have been cautious with hiring,\" ADP's chief economist, Nela Richardson, said.</p><p>The U.S. economy did expand 3.8% in the second quarter and is on pace for a 3.9% gain in the third quarter, according to the Atlanta Fed's GDPNow data tracker.</p><p>However, concerns have increased over the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2025/09/23/powell-says-slowing-labor-market-prompted-rate-cut-sees-challenging-situation-ahead.html\">state of the labor market</a>, even with the unemployment rate at a relatively low 4.3%.</p><p>\"My baseline outlook doesn't see the labor market softening much further – but there are risks,\" Boston Fed President Susan Collins said Tuesday. \"In particular, I see some increased risk that labor demand may fall significantly short of supply, leading to a more meaningful and unwelcome increase in the unemployment rate.\"</p><p>The consensus view for September was a nonfarm payrolls gain of 51,000 in the BLS report, which unlike ADP includes government jobs.</p><p>Even with the slowdown in hiring, wages in September grew 4.5% on an annual basis, little changed from August, ADP said. However, the rate of increase slowed to 6.6% for those changing positions, down half a percentage point from August.</p><p>ADP said it recalibrated past counts based on BLS benchmark revisions released in September. That resulted in the sharp downward move in the September figure of 43,000. \"The narrative remains the same ... of a slowing in hiring momentum,\" Richardson said on CNBC.</p><p><em>Correction: ADP recalibrated past counts based on BLS benchmark revisions released in September and that resulted in a downward move in the September figure of 43,000. An earlier version misstated a month.</em></p></div>"

The rally has been led by mega-cap tech giants, which have invested billions in artificial intelligence and are being valued richly on the potential of this emerging era.</p></div><div><p>The famous Buffett Indicator — the ratio of total U.S. stock market value to GDP — is also flashing one of the clearest signs of market exuberance<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2025/09/28/buffett-indicator-stock-market-overvalued.html\">. The gauge is sitting at record highs</a> well above the peaks reached during the Dotcom Bubble as well as the pandemic-era rally in 2021, suggesting equity prices are running far ahead of the underlying economy. At 217%, it's also beyond the level Buffett once said is \"playing with fire.\"</p><p>While Cooperman thinks stocks could be risky with the late-cycle crowd behavior, he dislikes government bonds even more due to elevated inflation. Bonds pay fixed nominal interest, so higher inflation erodes their real returns.</p><p>\"Stocks are less risky than bonds at these levels,\" he said.</p></div></div>"

After dropping to a three-year low two weeks ago, rates then shot right back up again.</p><p>As a result, total mortgage application volume declined 12.7% last week compared with the previous week, according to the Mortgage Bankers Association's seasonally adjusted index. The drop was mostly driven by a pullback in refinancing.</p><p>Applications to refinance a home loan fell 21% for the week and were 16% higher than the same week one year ago. This, even though mortgage rates were 32 basis points higher last week than the year before. The refinance share of mortgage activity decreased to 55% of total applications from 60% the previous week.</p><p>The average contract interest rate for 30-year fixed-rate mortgages with conforming loan balances, $806,500 or less, increased to 6.46% from 6.34%, with points rising to 0.61 from 0.57, including the origination fee, for loans with a 20% down payment.</p><p>Joel Kan, vice president and deputy chief economist at the MBA, said mortgage rates increased to their highest level in three weeks \"as Treasury yields pushed higher on recent, stronger than expected economic data. After the burst in refinancing activity over the past month, this reversal in mortgage rates led to a sizeable drop in refinance applications, consistent with our view that refinance opportunities this year will be short-lived.\"</p><p>Refinance activity pulled back for all loan types, including a 22% drop in conventional refinances and a 27% decline in VA refinances. The average loan size for refinances fell to $380,100 from $461,300 two weeks ago, \"as these higher rates eliminated the refinance incentive for many borrowers with large loans,\" added Kan.</p><p>Applications for a mortgage to purchase a home declined 1% for the week and were 16% higher than the same week one year ago. This is after three consecutive weeks of gains.</p><p>\"The strength of the purchase market has also been impacted by other factors such as broader economic conditions, the health of the job market, and housing inventory,\" said Kan.</p><p>Housing inventory in August fell for the first time since the beginning of this year, according to a recent report from the National Association of Realtors. While homes are sitting on the market longer now, keeping supply higher than a year ago, more sellers are starting to delist their properties. Other potential sellers are choosing to wait for a better market.</p><p>Mortgage rates haven't moved at all at the start of this week.
