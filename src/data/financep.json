That was really the opposite of the point I was trying to make. But I understand that to some that felt either ill-timed or unclear, or maybe both. And for those who think I did point a finger, I get why you're upset. If the situation was reversed, it's a good chance I'd have felt the same way.\" </p><p>The comedian's pre-taped monologue marked the first time he had publicly addressed the matter. </p><p>\"I'm happy to be here tonight,\" Kimmel said to massive applause from the audience. \"It's been overwhelming. I've heard from a lot of people over the last six days. I've heard from all the people in the world over the last six days.

What is important is that we get to live in a country that allows us to have a show like this,\" he said. \"I had the opportunity to meet and spend time with comedians and talk show hosts from countries like Russia, countries in the Middle East, who told me they would get thrown in prison for making fun of those in power ... They know how lucky we are here. Our freedom to speak is what they admire most about this country.\" </p><p>Audience members leaving the taping described the monologue as \"emotional\" and described a warm reception from fans. </p><p>\"It was just standing ovation after standing ovation,\" said Veronica Ament of Fresno, California, who secured her tickets for the taping weeks ago. \"My voice is almost gone.\"</p></div><h2><a></a>Political pressure</h2><div><p>Disney <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2025/09/22/disney-abc-jimmy-kimmel-return.html\">said in a statement Monday</a> it made the decision to suspend production of \"Jimmy Kimmel Live!\" following comments that were \"ill-timed and thus insensitive.\"</p><p>Those comments came during Kimmel's monologue last Monday, in reference to <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2025/09/16/charlie-kirk-tyler-robinson-charges.html\">Tyler Robinson</a>, who is <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2025/09/14/charlie-kirk-shooting-utah-gov-cox-.html\">charged with fatally shooting Kirk</a> on Sept. 10. Kimmel said then the \"MAGA gang\" was \"desperately trying to characterize this kid who murdered Charlie Kirk as anything other than one of them and doing everything they can to score political points from it.\"</p><p>\"In between the finger-pointing there was grieving. On Friday the White House flew the flags at half-staff, which got some criticism, but on a human level you can see how hard the president is taking this,\" he continued, teeing up a clip of Trump on the White House lawn in which the president fields a question on Kirk but swiftly pivots to talking about construction.</p></div><div><h2>Read more CNBC Jimmy Kimmel coverage</h2><div><ul><li><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2025/09/23/kimmel-abc-nexstar-sinclair-fcc.html\">Nexstar, Sinclair won't air Jimmy Kimmel's return on ABC affiliates</a></li><li><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2025/09/22/disney-abc-jimmy-kimmel-return.html\">Disney says 'Jimmy Kimmel Live' will return to ABC on Tuesday</a></li><li><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2025/09/22/jimmy-kimmel-abc-mamdani-hollywood-charlie-kirk.html\">NYC mayor candidate Mamdani withdraws from ABC town hall over Jimmy Kimmel suspensio</a>n</li><li><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2025/09/22/jimmy-kimmel-abc-sacramento-shooting-epstein-kirk.html\">Jimmy Kimmel suspension, Trump book, Epstein note eyed in ABC affiliate shooting</a></li><li><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2025/09/20/jimmy-kimmel-disney-abc-trump-fcc.html\">Trump aide denies Kimmel suspended because of WH pressure despite Carr threat</a></li><li><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2025/09/18/jimmy-kimmel-kirk-colbert-letterman-trump.html\">'Tonight, we are all Jimmy Kimmel,' Stephen Colbert says, calling Trump an 'autocrat'</a></li><li><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2025/09/19/jimmy-kimmel-disney-eisner-fcc-abc.html\">Former Disney CEO Eisner backs Jimmy Kimmel, blasts FCC 'intimidation' of ABC</a></li><li><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2025/09/18/trump-jimmy-kimmel-tv-network-licenses.html\">Trump floats pulling licenses if networks are 'against' him after Jimmy Kimmel suspended</a></li><li><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2025/09/18/jimmy-kimmel-charlie-kirk-fcc-carr.html\">FCC Chair Carr says 'we're not done yet' after Jimmy Kimmel suspension by ABC</a></li><li><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2025/09/17/charlie-kirk-jimmy-kimmel-abc-disney.html\">ABC pulls Jimmy Kimmel show off air 'indefinitely' over Charlie Kirk comments</a></li></ul></div></div><div><p>Kimmel's suspension came amid statements from <a href=\"https://www.fcc.gov/\" target=\"_blank\">Federal Communications Commission</a> Chair Brendan Carr that suggested ABC and its affiliate stations <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2025/09/18/jimmy-kimmel-charlie-kirk-fcc-carr.html\">could be at risk of losing broadcast licenses</a> over the comments.</p><p>Local station owners <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/NXST/\">Nexstar Media Group</a> and <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/SBGI/\">Sinclair</a> both said they would <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2025/09/23/kimmel-abc-nexstar-sinclair-fcc.html\">preempt the show's return on Tuesday</a>, meaning many markets across the country were not able to watch the program through local channels.

While the current situation is far less severe than what the U.S. encountered in the 1970s and early '80s, it nonetheless has presented a policy challenge for the Fed.</p><p>Powell, however, said he is comfortable with the central bank's current policy path though he indicated the possibility of additional cuts should the FOMC see the need to be more accommodative.</p><p>\"The increased downside risks to employment have shifted the balance of risks to achieving our goals,\" he said. \"This policy stance, which I see as still modestly restrictive, leaves us well positioned to respond to potential economic developments.\"</p><p>Stocks took a turn lower during Powell's presentation as he said during a question-and-answer period that <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2025/09/23/fed-powell-stock-prices-appear-fairly-highly-valued.html\">assets are \"fairly highly valued.\"</a></p></div><h2><a></a>Watching jobs, inflation</h2><div><p>On the labor market, Powell noted \"a marked slowdown\" in supply and demand. \"In this less dynamic and somewhat softer labor market, the downside risks to employment have risen,\" he said.</p><p>Indeed, payroll growth has slowed dramatically, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2025/09/05/jobs-report-august-2025.html\">averaging below 30,000</a> during the summer months while <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2025/09/09/jobs-report-revisions-september-2025-.html\">benchmark revisions</a> showed nearly a million fewer jobs created in the 12 months prior to March 2025.</p><p>At the same time, inflation has cooled substantially since hitting a more than 40-year peak in 2022 but is still considerably above the Fed's 2% goal. Commerce Department data to be released Friday is expected to indicate that personal consumption prices rose 2.7% on an annual all-items basis and 2.9% when excluding food and energy, Powell said.</p><p>Adding to uncertainty is the impact of President <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/donald-trump/\">Donald Trump</a>'s tariffs. The president continues to negotiate with major U.S. trading partners about the ultimate level for the duties, with a key deadline with China coming up in early November. Fed economists for now are viewing the tariffs as mostly a temporary rise in prices, though that could change.</p><p>\"Uncertainty around the path of inflation remains high,\" Powell said. \"We will carefully assess and manage the risk of higher and more persistent inflation. We will make sure that this one-time increase in prices does not become an ongoing inflation problem.\"</p><p>Powell is presiding over a Fed that has come under intense criticism from the White House and is seeing an unusually wide dispersion in views among officials. The FOMC meeting concluded with participants narrowly split, 10-9, over whether one or two more quarter-point cuts would be appropriate this year. Trump appointee Stephen Miran has pushed for a much more aggressive course, but his term as governor ends in January.</p><p>Earlier Tuesday, Governor Michelle Bowman warned about the dangers of moving too slowly to address the labor market. Bowman, also a Trump appointee, said \"we are at serious risk of already being behind the curve in addressing deteriorating labor market conditions.\"</p><p>\"I am concerned that the labor market could enter into a precarious phase and there is a risk that a shock could tip it into a sudden and significant deterioration,\" she said.</p><p>While Powell has not provided his expectations for future rate moves, Bowman said she hopes the recent action is \"the first step\" in an ongoing move back to a neutral interest rate level.</p></div><div><h2>Don’t miss these insights from CNBC PRO</h2><div><ul><li><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2025/09/16/market-track-record-is-stellar-when-fed-cuts-rates-with-sp-500-at-record.html\">Market track record is flawless when the Fed cuts rates with S&P 500 near record high</a></li><li><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2025/09/16/fed-rate-cuts-will-make-dividend-stocks-more-appealing-for-income-investors-here-are-a-few-standouts.html\">Fed rate cuts will make dividend stocks more appealing for income investors.

During tax year 2022, only <a href=\"https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/p4801.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">10% of filers</a> itemized deductions, and those taxpayers were <a href=\"https://taxpolicycenter.org/briefing-book/what-are-itemized-deductions-and-who-claims-them\" target=\"_blank\">more likely to be higher earners</a>, according to the latest IRS data.</p><p>Here is where taxpayers could see the biggest benefit from the $40,000 SALT deduction cap for 2025.</p></div><h2><a></a>States with the biggest SALT savings</h2><div><p>Trump's legislation temporarily raised the SALT deduction limit to $40,000 starting in 2025. That benefit starts to phase out, or decrease, for consumers making more than $500,000. Both figures will increase by 1% yearly through 2029, and the higher deduction limit will revert to $10,000 in 2030.</p><p>But itemizers in certain states could see a greater benefit, according to the Redfin report. Here are the 5 states where residents could see the biggest median savings from the new law.</p><ol><li>New York: $7,092</li><li>California: $3,995</li><li>New Jersey: $3,897</li><li>Massachusetts: $3,835</li><li>Connecticut: $3,133</li></ol><p>Meanwhile, these five states are where itemizers would see the smallest median savings from Trump's law.</p><ol><li>South Dakota: $1,033</li><li>Alaska: $1,052</li><li>Nevada: $1,090</li><li>Tennessee: $1,097</li><li>New Hampshire: $1,101</li></ol><p>To estimate savings, Redfin calculated how much the typical impacted homeowner could deduct under the new SALT legislation. Then, they applied the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2024/10/22/irs-2025-federal-income-tax-brackets.html\">24% marginal tax rate</a> to the amount over the previous $10,000 SALT cap.</p><p>However, this is \"very much a simulation,\" with a lot of assumptions, including property values, estimates for property taxes and estimates for state income taxes, Zhao said. The report does not consider local income taxes, which can vary significantly by jurisdiction.</p></div><h2><a></a>Other measures of the SALT deduction benefit</h2><div><p>A separate report released by the Bipartisan Policy Center in May also analyzed <a href=\"https://bipartisanpolicy.org/explainer/which-states-benefit-most-from-the-salt-deduction/\" target=\"_blank\">which states benefit most</a> from the SALT deduction, based on the number of residents paying SALT, and where taxpayers have the largest SALT deductions.</p><p>In 2022, the average SALT deduction was close to $10,000 in states such as Connecticut, New York, New Jersey, California and Massachusetts, according to the analysis, based on the latest IRS data. The bottom five were Wyoming, Tennessee, Nevada, North Dakota and South Dakota.</p><p>Those higher averages suggest a large portion of taxpayers claiming the deduction came close to the $10,000 cap, the researchers wrote.</p></div><div><p>Meanwhile, the states and district with the highest share of SALT claimants were Washington, D.C., Maryland, California, Utah and Virginia, the Bipartisan Policy Center analysis found. The bottom five were West Virginia, South Dakota, North Dakota, Ohio and Wyoming.</p><p>However, \"neither of these measures is a perfect proxy for how states benefit from the SALT deduction—or are impacted by the SALT cap,\" the researchers said.</p></div><div><p><img src=\"https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/108194853-1757079381362-salt_cap_thumb_carbon_720.jpg?v=1757079536&w=750&h=422&vtcrop=y\" alt=\"Why Congress raised the SALT cap\" /><span></span><span><div><p><span>watch now</span><span></span></p></div></span></p></div></div>"

Over $2 trillion in AI infrastructure has been planned around the world, according to an HSBC estimate this week.</p><p>OpenAI is leading the way.</p><p>In addition to the $500 billion Stargate project, the startup on Monday announced an equity investment <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2025/09/22/nvidia-openai-data-center.html\">deal</a> with <span><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/NVDA/\">Nvidia</a><span><span></span></span></span> that will add an estimated $500 billion worth of data centers in the coming years.

Although Nvidia is putting in equity to jumpstart the project, Friar said the chipmaker will get paid for all graphics processing units (GPUs) that it provides as those chips get deployed.</p><p>Friar said OpenAI will generate $13 billion in revenue this year, and that the company plans to help pay for the construction using its own cash flow and debt financing.</p><p>The Stargate name will refer to all OpenAI infrastructure projects going forward, CNBC <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2025/09/23/altman-huang-negotiations-that-sealed-100-billion-openai-nvidia-deal.html\">reported this week</a>.

    "body": "<div><div><p>Sam Altman, CEO of OpenAI (L), and Jensen Huang CEO of Nvidia.</p><p>Reuters</p></div><div><p>ABILENE, Texas – <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/sam-altman/\">Sam Altman</a> had a deadline. <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2025/06/10/openai-cnbc-disruptor-50.html\">OpenAI's</a> CEO was headed to Texas to unveil his company's next big infrastructure push, and <span><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/NVDA/\">Nvidia</a><span><span></span></span></span> CEO Jensen Huang wanted in on the action.</p><p>Through a series of hurried negotiations, late-night calls and last-minute contract tweaks, the two giants of <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/ai-artificial-intelligence/\">artificial intelligence</a> struck a <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2025/09/22/nvidia-openai-data-center.html\">$100 billion partnership</a> on Monday, hours before Altman boarded his flight to Abilene, a city of about 130,000 residents roughly 180 miles west of Dallas.</p><p>It helped that Huang and Altman had been part of <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/donald-trump/\">President Donald Trump's</a> state visit to the U.K. a week earlier, allowing the president to be briefed on the agreement days in advance. </p><p>The deal, which Huang described to CNBC as \"monumental in size,\" marks a watershed moment in the tech industry, as capital and influence are increasingly concentrated in the hands of the two companies closest to the heart of the artificial intelligence boom.</p><p>Huang now presides over the world's most valuable public company, worth nearly $4.5 trillion after gaining $170 billion following Monday's announcement, while Altman runs the most prominent startup on the planet, valued at half a trillion dollars.</p><p>OpenAI's ascent to the forefront of generative AI has relied on Nvidia's high-powered graphics processing units (GPUs). Now the companies are more intimately linked than ever, as they plan to carve a path to jointly building the next wave of AI supercomputing facilities.</p></div><div><p>\"You should expect a lot from us in the coming months,\" Altman told CNBC's Jon Fortt in an interview at Nvidia's Silicon Valley headquarters on Monday. \"There are three things that OpenAI has to do well: we have to do great AI research, we have to make these products people want to use, and we have to figure out how to do this unprecedented infrastructure challenge.\"</p><p>Altman and Huang negotiated their pact largely through a mix of virtual discussions and one-on-one meetings in London, San Francisco, and Washington, D.C., with no bankers involved, according to people close to the talks who declined to be named because they weren't authorized to speak publicly on the matter.</p><p>The arrangement calls for Nvidia to invest $10 billion at a time in OpenAI, the company behind ChatGPT. As the buildout unfolds, Nvidia will also supply the cutting-edge processors powering a host of new data centers.</p><p>While OpenAI gets more intimate with Nvidia, it has to maneuver through a number of high-stakes relationships with other key partners.</p><p>OpenAI only informed <span><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/MSFT/\">Microsoft</a><span><span></span></span></span>, its principal shareholder and primary cloud provider, a day before the deal was signed, the people familiar with the matter said. Earlier this year, Microsoft <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2025/01/21/microsoft-loses-status-as-openais-exclusive-cloud-provider.html\">lost its status</a> as OpenAI's exclusive provider of computing capacity.<strong> </strong>In June, Huang informed Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella that Nvidia was working toward a deal with OpenAI, said a person briefed on the conversation.</p><p>The pact also comes less than two weeks after a <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2025/09/13/openai-spending-spree-powering-much-of-tech-oracle-latest-example.html\">disclosure</a> from <span><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/ORCL/\">Oracle</a><span><span></span></span></span> indicated that OpenAI agreed to spend $300 billion in computing power with the company over about five years, starting in 2027. At the start of the year, OpenAI joined <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2025/07/22/openai-oracle-stargate-texas.html\">Stargate</a>, a multibillion-dollar project announced by President Trump and backed by Oracle and <span><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/3AG1-FF/\">SoftBank,</a><span><span></span></span></span> to build out next-generation AI infrastructure.</p><p>Going forward, all of OpenAI's infrastructure projects will fall under the Stargate umbrella.</p><p>Representatives from Microsoft, Oracle and SoftBank didn't immediately respond to requests for comment.</p><p>Nvidia and OpenAI provided scant details about where and when the buildout will take place, other than to say that the first of the 10 gigawatt sites will go online in the back half of next year.</p><p>Executives said they've reviewed between 700 and 800 potential locations since unveiling Stargate in January. In the months that followed, they fielded a flood of proposals from developers across North America offering land, power, and facilities. That list has been narrowed as OpenAI weighs energy availability, permitting timelines, and financing terms, the company said.</p><p>In Monday's announcement, OpenAI described Nvidia as a \"preferred\" partner. But executives told CNBC that it's not an exclusive relationship, and the company is continuing to work with large cloud companies and other chipmakers to avoid being locked in to a single vendor.</p></div><div><p>OpenAI CEO Sam Altman and Nvidia CEO, Jensen Huang arrive to attend the State Banquet during U.S. President Donald Trump's state visit, at Windsor Castle, in Windsor, Britain, September 17, 2025.</p><p>Phil Noble | Reuters</p></div><div><p>For Nvidia, the investment in OpenAI is historic in size, but it's just a big piece of a rapidly expanding portfolio.</p><p>Last week, Nvidia put $5 billion into <span><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/INTC/\">Intel</a><span><span></span></span></span> as part of a joint venture to co-develop data center and PC chips with the troubled chipmaker. Nvidia also said it invested close to $700 million in U.K. data center <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2025/09/17/ai-startup-nscale-from-uk-is-blowing-away-nvidia-ceo-jensen-huang.html\">startup Nscale</a>, a move that resembles Nvidia's backing of U.S. AI infrastructure provider <span><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/CRWV/\">CoreWeave</a><span><span></span></span></span>, which held its <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2025/03/27/nvidia-to-anchor-coreweave-ipo-at-40-a-share-source-says.html\">IPO</a> in March.</p></div><h2><a></a>Tranches of money</h2><div><p>The financing structure for the OpenAI deal is designed to avoid hefty dilution. The initial $10 billion tranche is locked in at a $500 billion valuation and expected to close within a month or so once the transaction has been finalized, people familiar with the matter said. Nine successive $10 billion rounds are planned, each to be priced at the company's then-current valuation as new capacity comes online, they said.</p><p>The relationship between Nvidia and OpenAI long predates the launch of ChatGPT in 2022.</p><p>Back when OpenAI was still a small nonprofit research lab and Nvidia was best known for building graphics chips for video games, Huang personally delivered his company's first DGX supercomputer to OpenAI's office in 2016. At the time, the startup was located in San Francisco's Mission District, in a building that's now home to <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/elon-musk/\">Elon Musk's</a> xAI.</p><p>Almost a decade and trillions of dollars in value later, Huang and Altman are perhaps the most significant power players in the tech industry.</p><p>In October of last year, Nvidia formalized its financial stake in OpenAI, joining a $6.6 billion <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2024/10/02/openai-raises-at-157-billion-valuation-microsoft-nvidia-join-round.html\">funding round</a> that valued the company at $157 billion. A month later, in Tokyo, OpenAI executives met with SoftBank CEO Masayoshi Son to brainstorm what to call their next phase of expansion. Out of that session came \"Stargate,\" a codename that has since become shorthand for OpenAI's most ambitious buildout plans.</p><p>Stargate now encompasses every major deal for compute capacity, including this week's partnership with Nvidia. Securing the rights to the name required some careful maneuvering, but OpenAI has embraced it as the banner for its long-term infrastructure strategy.</p></div><div><p><img src=\"https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/108188486-17556935481755693544-41267511116-1080pnbcnews.jpg?v=1755693547&w=750&h=422&vtcrop=y\" alt=\"OpenAI CFO Sarah Friar: Biggest issue we face is being 'constantly under compute'\" /><span></span><span><div><p><span>watch now</span><span></span></p></div></span></p></div><div><p>The $100 billion commitment from Nvidia represents only part of what's required for the planned 10-gigawatt buildout. OpenAI will lease Nvidia's chips for deployment, but financing the broader effort will require other avenues. Executives have called equity the most expensive way to fund data centers, and they say the startup is preparing to take on debt to cover the remainder of the expansion. </p><p>As OpenAI's compute necessities increase, a big question is where the company will host its workloads, which have to date been largely housed in Microsoft Azure. Taking the work in-house would push OpenAI closer to operating as a first-party cloud provider, a market led by <span><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/AMZN/\">Amazon</a><span><span></span></span></span> Web Services, followed by Azure, <span><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/GOOGL/\">Google</a><span><span></span></span></span> and Oracle.</p><p>Executives have openly floated the idea, suggesting it may not be far off. Some even indicated to CNBC that a commercial cloud offering could emerge within a year or two, once OpenAI has secured enough compute to cover its own needs. For now, demand for training frontier models leaves little capacity to spare, but OpenAI isn't done looking for new opportunities.</p><p>As Altman and Huang hammered out details of the arrangement that was announced this week, OpenAI's infrastructure team was in Tokyo meeting with SoftBank's Son to discuss broader financing and manufacturing support.</p><p>The parallel talks underscored the scale of Altman's ambition, and the web of global players now involved in bringing it to life.</p><p><em>-- CNBC's Jordan Novet contributed to this story.</em></p><p><strong>WATCH:</strong> <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/video/2025/09/12/openai-restructuring-clears-hurdle.html\">OpenAI restructuring clears hurdle</a></p></div><div><p><img src=\"https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/108198298-17576995531757699550-41614048656-1080pnbcnews.jpg?v=1757700378&w=750&h=422&vtcrop=y\" alt=\"OpenAI restructuring clears hurdle\" /><span></span><span><div><p><span>watch now</span><span></span></p></div></span></p></div></div>"

This could be a sign that as the consumer struggles, landlords are going to have to move to meet them. </p><p>Single-family rent prices in July increased 2.3% from the same month last year, which is slower than the 3.1% average rise a year ago, according to the latest data from Cotality. Rent growth has now fallen below the lower end of the 10-year average range of pre-pandemic growth. </p><p>\"After a strong start to the year, single-family rent growth is clearly losing steam,\" said Molly Boesel, senior principal economist at Cotality. \"In July, we broadly saw weakening in annual single-family rent growth across metro areas and price tiers.\"</p><p>Rent growth was just 0.2% higher in July compared with June, which is far below the historical July average monthly growth of 0.7%. That is a notable shift from monthly gains that had been stronger than usual earlier this year. </p></div><div><h2>Get Property Play directly to your inbox</h2><div><p>CNBC's Property Play with Diana Olick covers new and evolving opportunities for the real estate investor, delivered weekly to your inbox.</p><p><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/lander?id=propertyplay-newsletter\">Subscribe here to get access today</a>.</p></div></div><div><p>\"Even markets like Los Angeles, which had been buoyed by post-wildfire demand, are now cooling off. Chicago stands out as the exception, leading the nation in rent growth amid tight inventory and resilient demand,\" said Boesel. </p><p>Looking just at the 10 largest metropolitan markets, Chicago was in the lead at 5.1% rent growth, and the New York City metropolitan area came in second at 3.7%. Philadelphia and Washington, D.C., followed, and while Los Angeles is slowing, it still rounds out the top five for rent growth. </p><p>Dallas and Miami were the lowest of the 10, with Miami seeing no rent growth at all. Compare that with 2022, when pandemic-driven migration to the South caused Miami's annual rent growth to soar 40%.</p><p>Rent growth also weakened at all price points. For high-end properties, national average rents increased 2.9% from a year ago, down from the 3.2% annual gain seen last July. The same trend was seen in low-end rents, which rose 1.6% annually in July, down from the 2.8% gain in July 2024.</p><p>Single-family rents had been doing much better than apartment rents over the last few years, as an enormous amount of supply came on the multifamily market. Single-family rentals were also in high demand due to the skyrocketing prices in the for-sale market. Families, which tend to be buyers, were opting for rental homes in good school districts instead. </p><p>Single-family rental REITs, like Invitation Homes and American Homes 4 Rent, have actually been building more rental communities just to keep up with that demand, so it will be interesting to see if this latest weakening causes them to pull back. </p><p>As Property Play noted in July, the largest single-family rental REITs were selling more homes than they were buying, according to a count by Parcl Labs. That, however, was because they were trying to consolidate away from stand-alone properties and more into full rental communities, some of which they were building. </p></div></div>"

(Photo by Costfoto/NurPhoto via Getty Images)</p><p>Costfoto| Nurphoto | Getty Images</p></div><div><p>The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development upgraded its global economic growth forecast on Tuesday, with many economies appearing more resilient than expected so far this year.</p><p>The OECD now expects global growth of 3.2% this year, compared to the 2.9% expansion it had forecast in June. Expectations for 2026 were unchanged at 2.9%. This would mark a slowdown from the 3.3% growth seen in 2024.</p><p>Growth expectations for the U.S. were also lifted, to 1.8% for 2025, compared to June's 1.6% estimate. This still marks a significant fall from 2024's 2.8% growth, however. The organization forecasts 1.5% growth for the U.S. in 2026.</p><p>\"Global growth was more resilient than anticipated in the first half of 2025, especially in many emerging-market economies,\" the organisation said in a new report.</p><p>\"Industrial production and trade were supported by front-loading ahead of higher tariffs. Strong AI-related investment boosted outcomes in the United States and fiscal support in China outweighed the drag from trade headwinds and property market weakness,\" it noted.</p><p>Alvaro Pereira, chief economist of the OECD, on Tuesday told CNBC's Charlotte Reed that individual economic events in emerging markets including Brazil, Indonesia and India also boosted the world economy.</p><p>\"But to be honest with you, for most of our forecasts we have not changed significantly the forecast for virtually all the G20 countries and we still expect a slowing in the second part of the year after this front loading took place in the first quarter,\" he said.</p></div><h2><a></a>Tariff impact still to come</h2><div><p>The OECD warned, however, that \"significant risks to the economic outlook remain,\" as investment and trade continue to be hit by high levels of policy uncertainty and elevated tariffs.</p><p>Sweeping duties on goods entering the U.S. came into effect in August after months of policy changes, temporary pauses, and threats from U.S. President Donald Trump.</p><p>Countries and regions around the world now face tariff rates as high as 50% on their exports to the U.S., with some still trying to negotiate trade frameworks.</p><p>\"US bilateral tariff rates have increased on almost all countries since May. The overall effective US tariff rate rose to an estimated 19.5% at the end of August, the highest rate since 1933,\" the OECD said.</p><p>\"The full effects of tariff increases have yet to be felt – with many changes being phased in over time and companies initially absorbing some tariff increases through margins – but are becoming increasingly visible in spending choices, labour markets and consumer prices,\" it added.</p><p>Labour markets are showing signs of softening as some countries see higher unemployment and fewer job openings, according to the report, while the disinflation process appears to have flattened.</p><p>The OECD's Pereira said that \"the tariff shock is bringing more inflationary pressures in many countries.\"</p><p>\"We expect it will be additional price impacts for firms not only in the United States but other parts of the world too,\" he said.</p><p>The OECD now expects headline inflation to amount to 3.4% across G20 countries in 2025, slightly lower than June's 3.6% projection. Inflation expectations for the U.S. were revised down more sharply, with the OECD now forecasting price rises of 2.7% in 2025, down from the previous 3.2% forecast.</p><p>Looking ahead, further tariff increases and a return of inflationary pressures were flagged in the organization's report as two key risks, alongside growing concerns about the fiscal situation and the possibility of repricing in financial markets.</p><p>\"High and volatile crypto-asset valuations also raise financial stability risks given growing interconnectedness with the traditional financial system. On the upside, reductions in trade restrictions or faster development and adoption of artificial intelligence technologies could strengthen growth prospects,\" the OECD noted.</p></div></div>"
