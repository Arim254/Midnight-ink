Small molecule drugs, which often come in pill form, are more convenient for patients to take than injectable medications and are generally easier and cheaper to manufacture at scale.  </p><p>Eli Lilly said the site will bring 615 jobs to the Greater Houston area, including highly skilled engineers, scientists, operations personnel and lab technicians, and 4,000 construction jobs.</p></div></div>"

    "body": "<div><div><p>A robotic machine manufactures a semiconductor chip at a stall to show investors during The Advantage Assam 2.0 Investment Summit in Guwahati, India, on Feb. 25, 2025.</p><p>Nurphoto | Nurphoto | Getty Images</p></div><div><p>India wants to become a global chip major, but the odds are steep: competition is fierce, and India is a late entrant in the race to make the most advanced chips.</p><p>In 2022, when the U.S. restricted exports of its advanced AI chips to China to curb Beijing's access to cutting-edge technology, a global race for semiconductor self-reliance began.</p><p>For India, it offered an opportunity: the country wants to reduce dependence on imports, secure chips for strategic sectors, and capture a bigger share of the global electronics market shifting away from China.</p><p>India is one of the world's largest consumers of electronics, but it has no local chip industry and plays a minimal role in the global supply chain. New Delhi's \"Semiconductor Mission\" aims to change that.</p><p>The ambition is bold. It wants to create a full supply chain — from design to fabrication, testing and packaging — on Indian soil.</p><p>As of this month, the country has approved 10 semiconductor projects with total investment of 1.6 trillion rupees ($18.2 billion). These include two semiconductor fabrication plants, and multiple testing and packing factories.</p><p>India also has a pool of engineering talent that is already employed by global chip design companies.</p><p>Yet progress so far has been uneven, and neither the investments nor talent pool is enough to make India's chip ambitions a reality, say experts.</p><p>\"India needs more than a few fabs or ATP facilities (i.e., more than a few \"shiny objects.\") It needs a dynamic and deep and long-term ecosystem,\" said Stephen Ezell, vice president for global innovation policy at the Information Technology and Innovation Foundation, a science and technology policy think tank.</p><p>Ezell says that leading semiconductor manufacturers consider \"as many as 500 discrete factors\" before they set up multi-billion-dollar fab investments. These include talent, tax, trade, technology policies, labor rates and laws and customs policies — all areas where India has work to do.</p></div><h2><a></a>New Delhi's policy push</h2><div><p>In May, the Indian government added a new element to its chip ambition: a scheme to support electronic component manufacturing, addressing a critical bottleneck.</p><p>Until now, chipmakers had no local demand for their product as there are hardly any electronic component manufacturing companies, such as phone camera companies, in India.</p></div><div><p>Researchers inside the semiconductor fabrication lab at the Centre for Nano Science and Engineering, at the Indian Institute of Science, in Bangalore.</p><p>Manjunath Kiran | Afp | Getty Images</p></div><div><p>But the new policy offers financial support to companies producing active and passive electronic components, creating a potential domestic buyer-supplier base that chip manufacturers can plug into.</p><p>In 2022, the country also pivoted from its strategy of providing superior incentives to fabrication units making chips of 28nm or less. When it comes to chips, the smaller the size, the higher the performance with improved energy efficiency. These chips can be used in new technologies like advanced AI and quantum computing by packing more transistors into the same space.</p><p>But this approach wasn't helping India develop its nascent semiconductor industry, so New Delhi now covers 50% of the project costs of all fabrication units, regardless of chip size, and of chip testing and packing units.</p><p>Fab companies from Taiwan and the U.K., and semiconductor packaging companies from the U.S. and South Korea have all shown interest in aiding India's semiconductor ambitions.</p><p>\"The Indian government has doled out generous incentives to attract semiconductor manufacturers to India,\" said Ezell, but he stressed that \"those sorts of investments aren't sustainable forever.\"</p></div><h2><a></a>The long road</h2><div><p>The biggest chip project in India currently is the 910-billion-rupee ($11 billion) semiconductor fabrication plant being built in Prime Minister Narendra Modi's home state of Gujarat by Tata Electronics, in partnership with Taiwan's Powerchip Semiconductor Manufacturing Corp.</p><p>The unit will make chips for power management integrated circuits, display drivers, microcontrollers and high-performance computing logic, <a href=\"https://www.tataelectronics.com/w/manufacturing-corporation-psmc-complete-landmark-agreement-for-technology-transfer-to-build-india-s-first-semiconductor-fab\" target=\"_blank\">Tata Electronics said</a>, which can be used in AI, automotive, computing and data storage industries.</p><p>The U.K.'s Clas-SiC Wafer Fab has also tied up with India's SiCSem to set up the country's first commercial compound fab in the eastern state of Odisha.</p><p>These compound semiconductors can be used in missiles, defence equipment, electric vehicles, consumer appliances and solar power inverters, according to a government press release.</p><p>\"The coming 3-4 years is pivotal for advancing India's semiconductor goals,\" said Sujay Shetty, managing director of semiconductor at PwC India.</p><p>Establishing operational silicon fabrication facilities and overcoming technical and infrastructural hurdles that extend beyond incentives will be a key milestone, according to Shetty.</p></div><h2><a></a>Opportunities beyond fab</h2><div><p>Fabrication sites need to meet stringent requirements, such as being in areas free from floods and vibrations, with reliable road connectivity — which can present ongoing logistical considerations for some regions.</p><p>India also needs specialty chemical suppliers that meet \"ultra-high purity standards essential for advanced semiconductor manufacturing,\" Shetty added.</p><p>Beyond chip fabrication plants, many medium-sized companies in India have shown interest in setting up chip testing and packaging units. Several Indian groups are also entering the segment, attracted by its higher margins and lower capital intensity compared to fabs.</p><p>\"Outsourced semiconductor assembly and testing (OSAT) represents a significant opportunity for India, though clarifying market access and demand channels will be important for sustained growth,\" says Shetty.</p><p>Success in this area will see India enter the global chip industry, but New Delhi is still a long way from locally developing and manufacturing the cutting-edge of chip technology: 2nm semiconductors.</p><p>These 2nm chips offer better performance and power efficiency due to their smaller transistor size. Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Corporation will start mass-producing cutting-edge 2nm chips later this year, <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/8fd79522-e34f-4633-bc87-ef0aae2d9159\" target=\"_blank\">according to an FT report</a>.</p></div><div><p>NEW DELHI, INDIA - MAY 14: Union Minister of Railways, Information and Broadcasting, Electronics and Information Technology Ashwini Vaishnaw  briefing the media on Cabinet decisions at National Media Centre  on May 14, 2025 in New Delhi, India. </p><p>Hindustan Times | Hindustan Times | Getty Images</p></div><div><p>Last week, Indian minister Ashwini Vaishnaw, who was in Bengaluru to inaugurate a new office of semiconductor design firm ARM, said the British company will design the \"most advanced chips used in AI servers, drones, mobile phone chips of 2 nm\" from the south Indian city.</p><p>But experts say the role of local talent is likely to be limited to non-core design testing and validation, as the core intellectual property for chip designs is often held in locations like the U.S. or Singapore, where established IP regimes support such activities.</p><p>\"India has sufficient talent in design space, because unlike semiconductor manufacturing and testing that has come up in the last 2 years, design has been there since 1990s,\" said Jayanth BR, a recruiter with over 15 years of experience in hiring for global semiconductor companies in India.</p><p>He said global companies usually outsource \"block-level\" design validation work to India.</p><p>Going beyond this is something India's government will need to solve if it wants to fulfil its semiconductor ambitions.</p><p>\"India may consider updating its IP laws to address new forms of IP, like digital content and software. Of course, improving enforcement mechanisms will go a long way in protecting IP rights,\" says Sajai Singh, a partner at Mumbai-based JSA Advocates & Solicitors.</p><p>\"Our competition is with countries like the U.S., Europe, and Taiwan, which not only have strong IP laws, but also a more established ecosystem for chip design.\"</p></div></div>"

Amazon has denied any wrongdoing.</p><p>The trial is being held in a federal court in Seattle, Amazon's backyard. Jury selection began Monday and opening arguments are slated for Tuesday, with the trial expected to last about a month.</p><p>Launched in 2005, Amazon's Prime program has grown to become one of the most popular subscription services in the world, with more than 200 million members globally, and it has generated billions of dollars for the company. Membership costs $139 a year and includes perks like free shipping and access to streaming content. <a href=\"https://www.numerator.com/resources/blog/retailer-membership-walmart-plus-amazon-prime/\" target=\"_blank\">Data has shown</a> that Prime members spend more and shop more often than non-Prime members.</p><p>Amazon founder and Executive Chairman <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/jeff-bezos/\">Jeff Bezo</a>s famously <a href=\"https://s2.q4cdn.com/299287126/files/doc_financials/annual/2015-Letter-to-Shareholders.PDF\" target=\"_blank\">said</a> the company wanted Prime \"to be such a good value, you'd be irresponsible not to be a member.\"</p><p>Regulators argue Amazon broke competition and consumer protection laws by tricking customers into subscribing to Prime. They pointed to examples like a button on its site that instructed users to complete their transaction and did not clearly state they were also agreeing to join Prime for a recurring subscription.</p><p>\"Millions of consumers accidentally enrolled in Prime without knowledge or consent, but Amazon refused to fix this known problem, described internally by employees as an 'unspoken cancer' because clarity adjustments would lead to a drop in subscribers,\" the agency wrote in a court filing last week.</p><p>The FTC says the cancellation process is equally confusing, requiring users to navigate four webpages and choose from 15 options — a \"labyrinthian mechanism\" that the company referred to internally as \"Iliad,\" referencing Homer's epic poem about the Trojan War.</p><p>Amazon has argued that the Prime sign-up and cancellation processes are \"clear and simple,\" adding that the company has \"always been transparent about Prime's terms.\"</p><p>\"Occasional customer frustrations and mistakes are inevitable — especially for a program as popular as Amazon Prime,\" the company wrote in a recent court filing. \"Evidence that a small percentage of customers misunderstood Prime enrollment or cancellation does not prove that Amazon violated the law.\"</p></div><h2><a></a>A crackdown on 'dark patterns'</h2><div><p>The FTC notched <a href=\"https://www.courtlistener.com/docket/67515622/federal-trade-commission-v-amazoncom-inc/?order_by=desc#entry-490\" target=\"_blank\">an early win</a> in the case last week when U.S. District Court Judge John Chun ruled Amazon and two senior executives violated the Restore Online Shoppers' Confidence Act by gathering Prime members' billing information before disclosing the terms of the service.</p><p>Chun also said that the two senior Amazon executives would be individually liable if a jury sides with the FTC due to the level of oversight they maintained over the Prime enrollment and cancellation process.</p><p>Amazon's Prime boss, Jamil Ghani, and Neil Lindsay, a senior vice president in its health division who previously oversaw Prime's technology and business operations, are <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2023/09/20/ftc-charges-three-amazon-executives-in-amended-complaint-over-prime.html\">named defendants</a> in the complaint.</p><p>Russell Grandinetti, Amazon senior vice president of international consumer, is also named in the suit, but Chun argued he had \"less involvement in the operation of the Prime organization\" compared with Ghani and Lindsay.</p><p>Chun also scolded attorneys for Amazon in July for withholding thousands of documents from the FTC and abusing a legal privilege to shield them from scrutiny. Among the documents was a 2020 email where Amazon's retail chief, Doug Herrington, said \"subscription driving\" was a \"shady\" practice and referred to Bezos as the company's \"chief dark arts officer.\"</p><p>Amazon spokesperson Maxine Tagay told CNBC in a statement, \"The bottom line is that neither Amazon nor the individual defendants did anything wrong — we remain confident that the facts will show these executives acted properly and we always put customers first.\"</p><p>The company also faces <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2023/09/26/ftc-and-17-states-sue-amazon-on-antitrust-charges.html\">a separate lawsuit</a> brought by the FTC in 2023 accusing it of wielding an illegal monopoly. That case is set to go to trial in February 2027.</p><p>The Prime case is part of the FTC's broader crackdown on so-called <a href=\"https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/news/press-releases/2022/09/ftc-report-shows-rise-sophisticated-dark-patterns-designed-trick-trap-consumers\" target=\"_blank\">dark patterns,</a> which it began examining in 2022. The phrase refers to deceptive design tactics meant to steer users toward buying products or services or giving up their privacy.</p><p>The agency brought a similar <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2025/04/21/ftc-sues-uber-says-company-charged-for-uber-one-without-consent.html\">dark patterns lawsuit</a> against <span><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/UBER/\">Uber</a><span><span></span></span></span> in April, accusing the ride-hailing and delivery company of deceptive billing and cancellation practices tied to its Uber One subscription service. Uber has disputed the FTC's allegations.</p><p>Earlier this year, it reached settlements with online dating service <span><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/MTCH/\">Match</a><span><span></span></span></span> and online education firm <span><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/CHGG/\">Chegg</a><span><span></span></span></span> over claims that their subscription practices were deceptive or hard to cancel.</p></div><div><h2>Don’t miss these insights from CNBC PRO</h2><div><ul><li><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2025/09/16/market-track-record-is-stellar-when-fed-cuts-rates-with-sp-500-at-record.html\">Market track record is flawless when the Fed cuts rates with S&P 500 near record high</a></li><li><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2025/09/16/fed-rate-cuts-will-make-dividend-stocks-more-appealing-for-income-investors-here-are-a-few-standouts.html\">Fed rate cuts will make dividend stocks more appealing for income investors.

That was really the opposite of the point I was trying to make. But I understand that to some that felt either ill-timed or unclear, or maybe both. And for those who think I did point a finger, I get why you're upset.

What is important is that we get to live in a country that allows us to have a show like this,\" he said. \"I had the opportunity to meet and spend time with comedians and talk show hosts from countries like Russia, countries in the Middle East, who told me they would get thrown in prison for making fun of those in power ... They know how lucky we are here. Our freedom to speak is what they admire most about this country.\" </p><p>Audience members leaving the taping described the monologue as \"emotional\" and described a warm reception from fans. </p><p>\"It was just standing ovation after standing ovation,\" said Veronica Ament of Fresno, California, who secured her tickets for the taping weeks ago. \"My voice is almost gone.\"</p></div><h2><a></a>Political pressure</h2><div><p>Disney <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2025/09/22/disney-abc-jimmy-kimmel-return.html\">said in a statement Monday</a> it made the decision to suspend production of \"Jimmy Kimmel Live!\" following comments that were \"ill-timed and thus insensitive.\"</p><p>Those comments came during Kimmel's monologue last Monday, in reference to <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2025/09/16/charlie-kirk-tyler-robinson-charges.html\">Tyler Robinson</a>, who is <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2025/09/14/charlie-kirk-shooting-utah-gov-cox-.html\">charged with fatally shooting Kirk</a> on Sept. 10.

(Photo by Costfoto/NurPhoto via Getty Images)</p><p>Costfoto| Nurphoto | Getty Images</p></div><div><p>The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development upgraded its global economic growth forecast on Tuesday, with many economies appearing more resilient than expected so far this year.</p><p>The OECD now expects global growth of 3.2% this year, compared to the 2.9% expansion it had forecast in June. Expectations for 2026 were unchanged at 2.9%. This would mark a slowdown from the 3.3% growth seen in 2024.</p><p>Growth expectations for the U.S. were also lifted, to 1.8% for 2025, compared to June's 1.6% estimate. This still marks a significant fall from 2024's 2.8% growth, however. The organization forecasts 1.5% growth for the U.S. in 2026.</p><p>\"Global growth was more resilient than anticipated in the first half of 2025, especially in many emerging-market economies,\" the organisation said in a new report.</p><p>\"Industrial production and trade were supported by front-loading ahead of higher tariffs. Strong AI-related investment boosted outcomes in the United States and fiscal support in China outweighed the drag from trade headwinds and property market weakness,\" it noted.</p><p>Alvaro Pereira, chief economist of the OECD, on Tuesday told CNBC's Charlotte Reed that individual economic events in emerging markets including Brazil, Indonesia and India also boosted the world economy.</p><p>\"But to be honest with you, for most of our forecasts we have not changed significantly the forecast for virtually all the G20 countries and we still expect a slowing in the second part of the year after this front loading took place in the first quarter,\" he said.</p></div><h2><a></a>Tariff impact still to come</h2><div><p>The OECD warned, however, that \"significant risks to the economic outlook remain,\" as investment and trade continue to be hit by high levels of policy uncertainty and elevated tariffs.</p><p>Sweeping duties on goods entering the U.S. came into effect in August after months of policy changes, temporary pauses, and threats from U.S. President Donald Trump.</p><p>Countries and regions around the world now face tariff rates as high as 50% on their exports to the U.S., with some still trying to negotiate trade frameworks.</p><p>\"US bilateral tariff rates have increased on almost all countries since May. The overall effective US tariff rate rose to an estimated 19.5% at the end of August, the highest rate since 1933,\" the OECD said.</p><p>\"The full effects of tariff increases have yet to be felt – with many changes being phased in over time and companies initially absorbing some tariff increases through margins – but are becoming increasingly visible in spending choices, labour markets and consumer prices,\" it added.</p><p>Labour markets are showing signs of softening as some countries see higher unemployment and fewer job openings, according to the report, while the disinflation process appears to have flattened.</p><p>The OECD's Pereira said that \"the tariff shock is bringing more inflationary pressures in many countries.\"</p><p>\"We expect it will be additional price impacts for firms not only in the United States but other parts of the world too,\" he said.</p><p>The OECD now expects headline inflation to amount to 3.4% across G20 countries in 2025, slightly lower than June's 3.6% projection. Inflation expectations for the U.S. were revised down more sharply, with the OECD now forecasting price rises of 2.7% in 2025, down from the previous 3.2% forecast.</p><p>Looking ahead, further tariff increases and a return of inflationary pressures were flagged in the organization's report as two key risks, alongside growing concerns about the fiscal situation and the possibility of repricing in financial markets.</p><p>\"High and volatile crypto-asset valuations also raise financial stability risks given growing interconnectedness with the traditional financial system. On the upside, reductions in trade restrictions or faster development and adoption of artificial intelligence technologies could strengthen growth prospects,\" the OECD noted.</p></div></div>"
