Taiwan currently faces a \"reciprocal\" tariff rate of 20%.</p><p>Washington has held discussions with Taipei about the \"50-50\" split in semiconductor production, which would cut American reliance on Taiwan, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2025/09/30/taiwan-should-only-produce-half-of-americas-chips-says-us-commerce-chief.html\">Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick</a> said last weekend in an interview to NewsNation, adding that currently 95% of the U.S. demand was met via chips produced within Taiwan.  </p><p>\"My objective, and this administration's objective, is to get chip manufacturing significantly onshored — we need to make our own chips,\" Lutnick said. \"The idea that I pitched [Taiwan] was, let's get to 50-50. We're producing half, and you're producing half.\" </p><p>U.S. President Donald Trump had also taken aim at the island's dominance in chips earlier this year, accusing it of \"stealing\" the U.S.' chip business.</p><p>The Office of the U.S. Trade Representative and Taiwan's Ministry of Economic Affairs did not immediately respond to CNBC's request for comments.</p><p>Lutnick's proposal has been condemned by Taiwan's politicians, with Eric Chu, chairman of the island's principal opposition party Kuomintang, calling it \"an act of exploitation and plunder,\" according to the Central News Agency report.</p><p>\"No one can sell out Taiwan or TSMC, and no one can undermine Taiwan's silicon shield,\" Chu said, referring to <span><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/2330-TW/\">Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company</a><span><span></span></span></span>, the world's leader in advanced chip manufacturing.</p><p>Taiwan's critical position in global chips production is believed to have assured the island nation's defense against direct military action from China, often referred to as the \"Silicon Shield\" theory.</p><p>In his NewsNation interview, Lutnick downplayed the \"Silicon Shield,\" arguing that Taiwan would be safer with more balanced chip production between Washington and Taipei. Beijing views the democratically governed island of Taiwan as its own territory and has vowed to reclaim it <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/world/china/xi-china-will-never-renounce-right-use-force-over-taiwan-2022-10-16/\" target=\"_blank\">by force if necessary</a>, while Taipei rejects those claims<em>. </em></p><p>Taiwan People's Party Chairman Huang Kuo-chang reportedly called Lutnick's proposal an attempt to \"hollow out the foundations of Taiwan's technology sector.\"</p></div></div>"

Examples including Nicolaus Copernicus who theorized the sun was at the center of the universe and other planets move round it.</p><p>Wolf explained a couple of issues with chatbots right now. The first is that these products like ChatGPT and others often agree or align with the person prompting it. Think back to if you've asked a chatbot a prompt and it will tell you how interesting or great that question is.</p><p>The second is that the models underpinning these chatbots are designed to \"predict the most likely next token\" or \"word\" in a sentence.</p><p>However, he noted two key traits of scientists. The first is that scientists who make major breakthroughs are often contrarian and question what others are saying.</p><p>\"The scientist is not trying to predict the most likely next word. He's trying to predict this very novel thing that's actually surprisingly unlikely, but actually is true,\" Wolf said.</p><p>The Hugging Face co-founder has been thinking about this topic for the last few months. His interest was sparked after he read an essay penned by Anthropic's Amodei, who posited that \"AI-enabled biology and medicine will allow us to compress the progress that human biologists would have achieved over the next 50-100 years into 5-10 years.\"</p><p>That got Wolf thinking about the state of AI and how this won't be possible, in his view, with the current crop of models.</p><p>Wolf said that these chatbots and tools will likely be used as a sort of \"co-pilot for a scientist\" where they are used for research to help the human generate new ideas.</p><p>To some extent, this has been happening already. Google DeepMind's AlphaFold product has helped to analyze protein structures which the company has promised could aid scientists in discovering new drugs.</p><p>But there are some new startups that are hoping to take AI one step further into being able to make scientific breakthroughs, including Lila Sciences and FutureHouse.</p></div></div>"

Clary | Afp | Getty Images</p></div><div><p>PIMCO President Christian Stracke is upbeat on the asset-based finance segment of the private credit market, but warns of \"cracks\" in corporate direct lending, which makes up the bulk of the sector.</p><p>Speaking with CNBC at the annual Milken Asia Summit in Singapore Wednesday, Stracke highlighted the widening gap between the two lending spheres.</p><p>\"There are problems [in corporate private credit] where borrowers are going to their lenders and saying, 'Can I not pay you cash interest now, but basically borrow the interest from you and pay it later?' It's called Payment-in-Kind [PIK], and it's fairly prevalent right now,\" Stracke said.</p><p>He referred to asset-based financing as a \"much healthier\" credit environment.</p><p>\"In asset-based financing — residential mortgages, consumer loans, student loans and auto loans — the economy is strong, households are strong, the consumer is strong, and we really aren't seeing cracks that way,\" he added.</p><p>The widening gap stems from the aftermath of the 2008 Global Financial Crisis, which saw consumer borrowers scale back their borrowing and deleverage their household balance sheets, which has helped boost asset-based financing activity. Corporate borrowers, in contrast, have built up their leverage and have \"less clean\" balance sheets.</p><p>In October last year, PIMCO raised more than $2 billion for asset-based specialty financing strategy as part of its continued push into private credit.</p></div><div><p><img src=\"https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/108206130-17592796421759279639-41893235216-1080pnbcnews.jpg?v=1759279641&w=750&h=422&vtcrop=y\" alt=\"'Real cracks' showing in the direct lending market within private credit: PIMCO\" /><span></span><span><div><p><span>watch now</span><span></span></p></div></span></p></div><div><p>Corporate borrowers also face a trade-off in public versus private debt markets, according to Stracke.</p><p>The smaller number of lenders in private markets means it can be easier for borrowers to renegotiate loan terms in the event of loan pressure — albeit with higher costs.</p><p>More liquid bank debt, on the other hand, comes at a much lower cost, though the refinancing process can be trickier.</p><p>\"It's more difficult with a broadly syndicated bank loan or bond,\" Stracke said. \"We're seeing some real problem in the credit markets. There have been some high-profile defaults in the credit markets — in the public markets — where it's very difficult for the company to negotiate with the lenders to preserve value in the company.\"</p><p>Looking ahead, Stracke said that as the Federal Reserve continues on its path of interest rate cuts, and the overall all-in cost of borrowing comes down, particularly in mortgage rates, there will be more opportunities for PIMCO to take advantage of that demand for credit.</p></div><div><p><img src=\"https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/108206122-17592776821759277679-41892888085-1080pnbcnews.jpg?v=1759277682&w=750&h=422&vtcrop=y\" alt=\"We are going to see more IPOs in the first half of next year: Hostplus CEO\" /><span></span><span><div><p><span>watch now</span><span></span></p></div></span></p></div><div><p>Meanwhile, David Elia, CEO of Australian superannuation fund Hostplus, said institutional investors in search of portfolio diversification are increasingly drawn to the private markets space – but said regulation should be focused on the retail wealth space.</p><p>Elia told CNBC at the Milken Asia summit that any push for tougher regulation of private markets should center around \"mom-and-dad\" investors who are attracted to the diversifying benefits of the asset class, rather than sophisticated institutional investors.</p><p>\"There are probably about 19,000 companies that are listed on global markets. There are 140,000 private companies who generate in excess of $100 million in U.S. revenue,\" Elia said.</p><p>\"As long-term institutional investors, you will not see the level of concentration, if you're genuine about diversification, in listed markets.

    "body": "<div><div><p>Qian Zhang has lived in Lisbon since 2023.</p></div><div><p>When Qian Zhang boarded a flight from Shanghai to Boston at age 18, she thought she was heading toward the \"best version\" of her life. It was 2009, during President Barack Obama's first term, when the U.S. economy was rebounding and opportunities for well-educated workers seemed plentiful.</p><p>She was bound for Dartmouth College, a top choice for many Chinese students, and later found her way to Harvard Business School.</p><p>Qian embraced the American dream: the promise of equal opportunity, a country that rewards talent and hard work, and a place where global citizens like her could belong.</p><p>By her early 30s, she was a vice president at a global firm in Boston, earning six figures a year. But behind the glittering resume was a reality defined by her immigration status.</p><p>Like hundreds of thousands of foreign professionals, Qian lived on an H-1B work visa — the document that tethered her job, her ability to travel, and her entire sense of security to the grace of her employer. \"Your entire life is tied to your job,\" she said. \"If you lose the job, you lose the visa. If you lose the visa, you lose the country.\"</p><p>At first, she pushed aside her anxieties. She bought property, built friendships, and told herself she was no different from her American colleagues.</p><p>But each year brought fresh reminders: vacations cut short to fly back to China for visa paperwork, discreet job searches because changing employers required fresh visa sponsorships, and the constant fear that one misstep could unravel her life. \"The H-1B made me feel like a second-class citizen,\" she said.</p></div><blockquote><div><p>Your entire life is tied to your job. If you lose the job, you lose the [H-1B] visa. If you lose the visa, you lose the country.</p><div><p>Qian Zhang</p><p>Former H-1B visa holder</p></div></div></blockquote><div><p>In 2022, four months after her promotion to vice president, Qian quit. A year later, she packed her life into suitcases again. This time, she was leaving for good.</p><p>Now, the 35-year-old resides in Portugal's capital, Lisbon, with her partner, Swiss artist-filmmaker Tobias Madison, and their newborn child. The Portuguese sun and slower pace, she says, have begun to heal the trauma of a decade in America, where every promotion, vacation and romantic entanglement felt shadowed by the same fear: what happens if her visa disappears?</p><h3>Chasing the dream — and the visa</h3><p>The H-1B visa fundamentally shaped her career path, Qian said. \"Only a handful of sectors even sponsor it — finance, tech, consulting, law and medicine. You don't have many options,\" she said.</p><p>She had done several stints in Boston, from strategy consulting to business development at a tech firm, before rising to become a vice president at a consumer products company.</p><p>\"When the economy is strong, you may have a chance to compete on an equal footing with other job seekers. But when the economy is bad, you're the last pick, if you're picked at all.\"</p><p>Her anxiety deepened during President Donald Trump's first term, when visa processing delays and audits rose. Even Qian, who seemed to embody the type of high-skilled worker the U.S. claimed to prize, felt vulnerable. \"I had a conflict at work once and thought, if I get fired, I might have to leave immediately,\" she recalled. \"I was so anxious I actually crashed my car.\"</p><p>The country was no longer the one she entered in 2009, she said. Reading the comments under news articles about immigration was sobering. \"The America I went to believed in openness, in welcoming talent,\" she said. \"The America I left was divided, suspicious, anxious.\"</p><p>Her disillusionment echoed a broader trend of slowing international student enrollment in the U.S. in recent years.</p><p>\"America used to be the dream,\" she said. \"Now people like me look elsewhere.\"</p><h3>A new chapter</h3><p>Lisbon, with its tiled streets and Atlantic sunsets, is a world away from Boston and New York. Qian and her partner are renovating a farmhouse in the Portuguese countryside. She is writing a book and exploring creative projects. Life is slower, cheaper, freer, she said.</p><p>Portugal has been a hotspot for digital nomads, luring foreign remote workers with friendly visa policies, a better quality of life, and a lower cost of living.</p><p>Her visa process in Portugal, she said, was \"the easiest of my life.\" When she pressed her lawyer for what could go wrong, the lawyer reassured her: \"Don't worry, we are not the U.S.\"</p></div><div><p>Qian Zhang has lived in Lisbon since 2023.</p></div><div><p>Her years in America gave her financial security — she graduated when the economy was strong, saved responsibly and invested prudently.

The department manages the government's $1.6 trillion student loan portfolio and disburses funding and grants to schools and individuals, along with other duties related to K-12 and higher education.</p><p>Here's what current borrowers, college students and those applying for federal aid need to know.</p></div><h2><a></a>Which Department of Education functions are impacted by the shutdown?</h2><div><p>During the shutdown, the Department of Education will pause new grantmaking activities and investigations into civil rights violations, according to the contingency plan. </p><p>But since most grants are disbursed over the summer, the impact to institutions and individual recipients should be minimal, the department says.</p></div><h2><a></a>Can I still apply for federal financial aid?</h2><div><p>Yes. The remaining Department of Education employees will ensure federally mandated programs like the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2025/09/08/fafsa-officially-opens-october-1-but-you-can-apply-for-aid-now.html\">Free Application for Federal Student Aid</a> and aid and loan disbursements can continue to operate, according to the department's contingency plan.<strong> </strong>The plan also explicitly states that FAFSA processing should not be impacted by the shutdown.</p><p>The FAFSA, the form millions of students and families need to submit to be considered for federal grants and loans, as well as institutional aid from their college, opened on Sept. 24 this year, ahead of its official Oct. 1 <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2025/09/08/fafsa-officially-opens-october-1-but-you-can-apply-for-aid-now.html\">opening date</a>.</p></div><h2><a></a>Do I still need to make student loan payments?</h2><div><p>Yes. Despite the shutdown, federal student loan <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2025/02/21/what-happens-to-student-loans-if-department-of-education-is-eliminated.html\">payments will still be due</a>.</p><p><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2025/08/12/where-borrowers-are-most-at-risk-of-student-loan-default.html\">Federal student loan borrowers</a> mainly interact with their loan servicers to make payments, change payment plans and resolve issues. While the federal government oversees those servicers, most borrowers shouldn't have issues getting the assistance they need during the shutdown unless they have a problem with their servicer.</p><p>\"The Education Department itself is not servicing your loan. You're paying your loan each month to a loan servicing company,\" Kate Wood, a lending expert at NerdWallet, tells CNBC Make It. \"Your servicer is definitely remaining open, and they are definitely collecting payments.\"'</p></div><h2><a></a>What can I do if I have an issue with my loans?</h2><div><p>Reaching out to your servicer if you're having trouble paying your loans or have questions about your account is still \"generally your best bet,\" Wood says.</p><p>Customer service had already slowed down at the Department of Education due to the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2025/07/18/how-department-of-education-layoffs-will-affect-student-loan-borrowers.html\">mass layoffs at the agency</a> earlier this year. So while it may still be difficult to get in touch with the department for those who need to, that's not necessarily a result of the shutdown. </p><p>Students who are in the process of getting aid or loans should connect with their school counselor or financial aid office if they need assistance with the FAFSA.</p><p><em><strong>Want to be your own boss?</strong> Sign up for CNBC's new online course, </em><a href=\"https://smarter.cnbcmakeit.com/p/how-to-start-a-business-for-first-time-founders?utm_source=cnbc&utm_medium=makeitarticle&utm_campaign=bottom\" target=\"_blank\"><em>How To Start A Business: For First-Time Founders</em></a><em>.

The rally has been led by mega-cap tech giants, which have invested billions in artificial intelligence and are being valued richly on the potential of this emerging era.</p></div><div><p>The famous Buffett Indicator — the ratio of total U.S. stock market value to GDP — is also flashing one of the clearest signs of market exuberance<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2025/09/28/buffett-indicator-stock-market-overvalued.html\">. The gauge is sitting at record highs</a> well above the peaks reached during the Dotcom Bubble as well as the pandemic-era rally in 2021, suggesting equity prices are running far ahead of the underlying economy. At 217%, it's also beyond the level Buffett once said is \"playing with fire.\"</p><p>While Cooperman thinks stocks could be risky with the late-cycle crowd behavior, he dislikes government bonds even more due to elevated inflation. Bonds pay fixed nominal interest, so higher inflation erodes their real returns.</p><p>\"Stocks are less risky than bonds at these levels,\" he said.</p></div></div>"

It also claims that Redfin fired hundreds of employees and then worked with Zillow to rehire some of them.</p><p>\"Millions of New Yorkers rely on online apartment listings to find an affordable and safe place to live,\" James said in a statement. \"Zillow's attempt to shut down its competition could drive up costs for advertisers and leave renters with fewer options when searching for a new apartment.\"</p><p>Zillow, Redfin and CoStar, which owns Apartments.com, are the three largest players in the market and account for 85% of all market revenue, according to James' office.</p><p>The AGs are seeking an injunction to bar the two companies from allegedly scheming and proposes a possible restructuring of the businesses to maintain competition.</p><p>\"Redfin strongly disagrees with the allegations and is confident we will be vindicated by a court of law,\" a spokesperson for the company said in a statement. \"Our partnership with Zillow has given <a href=\"http://redfin.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Redfin.com</a> visitors access to more rental listings and our advertising customers access to more renters. By the end of 2024, it was clear that the existing number of Redfin advertising customers couldn't justify the cost of maintaining our rentals sales force. Partnering with Zillow cut those costs and enabled us to invest more in rental-search innovations on <a href=\"http://redfin.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Redfin.com</a>, directly benefiting apartment seekers.\"</p><p>A Zillow spokesperson said the company maintains that its partnership with Redfin is \"pro-competitive and pro-consumer by connecting property managers to more high-intent renters so they can fill their vacancies and more renters can get home.\"</p><p>Shares of Zillow and Redfin's parent company <span><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/RKT/\">Rocket Companies</a><span><span></span></span></span> initially traded lower following the announcement, after each losing ground on Tuesday following the FTC's lawsuit.</p><p>The FTC's complaint cites a similar alleged scheme between the two companies. Zillow and Redfin both disagreed with those allegations and said they remained confident in their partnership.</p></div></div>"
