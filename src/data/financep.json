    "body": "<div><p>Dan Porter, founder and CEO of digital sports media company Overtime, can quickly point out a candidate who isn't the right fit for his company.</p><p>He uses his go-to interview question, one that you've likely heard before: \"Do you have any questions for me?\" The interviewee's answer paints a picture about what kind of employee they'd be, Porter told LinkedIn's \"This Is Working\" <a href=\"https://podcasts.apple.com/gb/podcast/this-is-quick-why-overtimes-ceo-prioritizes-personality/id1475838548?i=1000727304740\" target=\"_blank\">podcast</a> on Sept. 18.</p><p>\"Bad employees, or bad interviewers, ask me about a dental plan or how I started Overtime when there's, like,100 podcasts,\" he said. \"And good people are like, 'Oh, I'm glad you asked that.' And they have like 20 questions.\"</p><p>Make no mistake, the interview process is typically the time to ask about benefits, says Suzy Welch, a <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/suzy-welch-cnbc-make-it/\">career expert</a>, NYU Stern School of Business professor and three-time New York Times best-selling author. \"After all, people work for the love of it, for meaning, for growth — but also to pay the bills,\" she says. \"To ignore this reality, especially in 2025, is ridiculous.\"</p><p>\"But I agree, these are not matters to discuss with the CEO, and frankly, not matters to raise until you have an offer in hand. … Frankly, they may not even know about the dental benefits in any detail, and if you ask, they could very possibly think, 'Well, I know why this person wants to work here,'\" Welch adds. \"With the CEO, use your time to talk about the markets, competitors and any ideas you have about the many ways you will make the company better, smarter and stronger.\"</p><p>Candidates can also ask about the company culture and how employees at the organization collaborate, says Welch. Just be sure to ask specific, particular questions, not those with \"fluffy, jargon-addled terms.\"</p><p>Something like \"How do the managers here support work-life balance?\" for example, sounds good on the surface, but doesn't really get down to what day-to-day life at the organization looks like and can prompt a broad answer. Using Welch's advice, a question like, \"<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2025/07/01/ceo-the-no-1-question-that-cuts-through-the-bs-at-job-interviews-people-who-ask-it-are-stunned.html\">What kind of person should not work at this company?</a>\" is much more pointed, eliminates buzzwords and prompts less rehearsed answers.</p><p>\"Use your time wisely in the interview,\" says Welch. \"You're not wrong to care about benefits, just do it with the right people at the right time.\"</p><p>As for what green-flag qualities Porter looks for when hiring someone, he values character and intelligence over a lengthy resume, he says.</p><p>\"I prioritize personality and intelligence, but not academic intelligence, intelligence to think about the world,\" said Porter, 59, using his experience running social game company, OMGPOP — which was <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/danporter/\" target=\"_blank\">acquired by Zynga</a> for $180 million in 2012 — as an example. \"When I ran a gaming company, I used to only ask one question: What's your favorite game and why?\"</p><p>When a person could give a detailed answer about what makes that specific game better than all the others, \"I knew they would be great to work at a game company,\" he added.</p><p><em><strong>Want to be your own boss?</strong> Sign up for Smarter by CNBC Make It's new online course, </em><a href=\"https://smarter.cnbcmakeit.com/p/how-to-start-a-business-for-first-time-founders?utm_source=cnbc&utm_medium=makeitarticle&utm_campaign=bottom\" target=\"_blank\"><em>How To Start A Business: For First-Time Founders</em></a><em>.

    "body": "<div><div><p>Most stress management advice gets it completely wrong. We're often told to focus inward — practice self-care, take bubble baths, meditate in quiet rooms, get massages. While <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2025/08/12/self-care-or-escapism-how-to-spot-the-difference-says-therapist.html\">these activities aren't harmful, they're missing something crucial.</a></p><p>As a stress physiologist who has studied over 750 Americans, over the course of nearly a year, I've found that 58% of people actually stress out more when <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2025/03/30/how-to-reduce-stress-things-that-actually-help-from-a-doctor.html\">trying to <em>control</em> their stress</a>.</p><p>But here's what really caught my attention: When researchers <a href=\"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/irj.12418\" target=\"_blank\">analyzed </a>more than 90 workplace wellness programs, nearly all failed to improve employee well-being. The one notable exception? Programs that encouraged employees to do charity or volunteer work. These actually worked.</p><p>This aligns with what I've discovered in my own research: The most underrated way to manage stress isn't to try to \"cure\" it by attempting to eliminate or hide from it — it's to channel that stress energy outward.</p><p><em><strong>DON'T MISS</strong></em><a href=\"https://smarter.cnbcmakeit.com/p/how-to-start-a-business-for-first-time-founders?utm_source=cnbc&utm_medium=makeitarticle&utm_campaign=body\" target=\"_blank\"><em><strong>:</strong> <strong>The ultimate guide to starting a business—everything you need to know to be your own boss</strong></em></a> </p></div><h2><a></a>Why helping others reduces your stress</h2><div><p>When we experience stress, our bodies release a cocktail of hormones. Most people focus on cortisol and adrenaline, but there's another key player: oxytocin. Often called the \"cuddle hormone,\" oxytocin serves a specific purpose. It motivates us to connect with others and seek support.</p><p>What that means is that stress is designed to be a social experience. Not one you're supposed to conquer on your own. No wonder our attempts at resolving our stress by ourselves often leave us feeling worse when we fail. For much of human history, we faced challenges as groups, not individuals.</p><p>I'm not suggesting you ignore your own needs or become a martyr. Instead, try what I call \"stress springboarding\" — using your stress energy as fuel for meaningful action that benefits others.</p></div><h2><a></a>How to put 'stress springboarding' into practice</h2><div><p>If you start to feel overwhelmed at work, instead of retreating, look for a colleague who might be struggling and offer specific help. This could mean covering a meeting for someone dealing with a sick child, sharing a useful template you've created, or simply asking, \"What's your biggest challenge today?\" before diving into solutions. </p><p>Volunteer for the project everyone's avoiding, or offer to onboard the new team member when others are too busy. The key is to act while you're feeling that stress energy, not after you've \"calmed down.\"</p><p>If you are experiencing personal stress, rather than just venting to friends, ask how you can support <em>them</em>. Cook dinner for someone going through a breakup, help a neighbor with yard work, or organize a group activity that benefits everyone. Often, stressed people bond when they help each other through difficulties simultaneously.</p><p>In your broader community, channel stress about local or global issues into concrete action. Volunteer for causes you care about, organize community solutions, or use your professional skills to help nonprofits.</p><p>And lastly, with your family, when those well-worn family dynamics generate stress, focus on how you can contribute to solutions rather than just managing your own reactions.</p><p>This isn't just feel-good advice. Brain imaging shows that helping others <a href=\"https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4851591/\" target=\"_blank\">activates reward centers </a>and reduces activity in stress-related regions. When we focus on contributing to our communities, we literally rewire our brains to handle stress more effectively.</p></div><h2><a></a>Why this matters for your long-term goals and aspirations</h2><div><p>This approach has professional benefits, too. Leaders who channel stress into supporting their teams see better performance across the board.</p><p>Employees who help colleagues during high-pressure periods are more likely to <a href=\"https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/23311975.2024.2418422\" target=\"_blank\">report higher job satisfaction</a> and engagement.</p><p>Instead of fighting your stress response, learn to use it as a competitive advantage. The next time you feel that familiar knot in your stomach or racing heart, ask yourself: \"How can I use this energy to help someone else?\"</p><p>You might be surprised to find that the best \"cure\" for your stress is actually a balm for others.</p><p><a href=\"https://rebeccaheiss.com/\" target=\"_blank\"><em><strong>Dr. Rebecca Heiss</strong></em></a><em> is a stress expert, keynote speaker and the author of \"</em><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0806541032/\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Instinct: Rewire Your Brain with Science-Backed Solutions to Increase Productivity and Achieve Success</em></a><em>,\" and \"</em><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Springboard-Transform-Stress-Work-You/dp/1646871995/\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Springboard: Transform Stress to Work for You</em></a><em>.\" Her research has been designated \"transformative\" by the National Science Foundation.

Especially if your goal is something concrete like having a certain amount of money <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2025/05/31/how-much-money-you-should-have-saved-by-50.html\">saved for retirement</a> or a <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2025/07/29/median-home-price-hits-record-high-monthly-mortgage-cost.html\">down payment on a home</a> or <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2025/02/26/suze-ormans-advice-for-paying-off-credit-card-debt-faster.html\">paying off a mountain of debt</a>, you must take action.</p><p>\"Delulu is not a solulu,\" Aja Evans, a financial therapist told reporters at a Northwestern Mutual Psychology and Money luncheon on Sept. 18. When asked what kind of irrational financial advice and moves she sees too many people taking, she said that \"manifesting\" has too many individuals thinking they can believe their way to a better financial future.</p><p>Her colloquial response played on the internet phrase, \"delulu,\" which isn't just short for delusional, but often directly refers to an individual's self-confidence, according to <a href=\"https://www.merriam-webster.com/slang/delulu\" target=\"_blank\">Merriam-Webster's definition</a>. </p><p>\"I'm an optimist, so I want to believe in the abundance, and I do, but I also want people to ground themselves in reality as well,\" Evans added.</p></div><h2><a></a>The problem with positive thinking alone</h2><div><p><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2022/12/08/how-greys-anatomy-star-ellen-pompeo-manifested-her-beach-house.html\">Manifesting is a popular strategy</a> for getting virtually anything in life, especially on TikTok where the \"manifestation\" tag has nearly 9 million videos often featuring manifesting experts or everyday practitioners claiming they've manifested their romantic partners, dream jobs or even large sums of money. Over 307,000 videos feature the tag \"<a href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/tag/manifestmoney\" target=\"_blank\">manifestmoney</a>.\"</p><p>One user with nearly 2 million followers <a href=\"http://tiktok.com/@somachhaya/video/7524422483366120735?_t=ZP-8zy4uyOTXAM&_r=1\" target=\"_blank\">claims she earned $50,000</a> in a single day thanks to the power of manifesting. CNBC Make It reached out to the user for comment, but did not hear back. </p><p>The belief is especially common among younger Americans, with 48% of adults ages 18 to 29 saying they believe that manifestation, defined as \"thinking positively or visualizing something can help make it happen, even without taking any other action\" works, according to a <a href=\"https://today.yougov.com/topics/politics/survey-results/daily/2025/05/28/451be/1\" target=\"_blank\">YouGov poll</a> from May 2025. That share drops slightly to 46% for Americans ages 30 to 44 who believe manifesting works.</p><p>While manifesting isn't<strong> </strong>necessarily a bad habit, it will probably be difficult for you to actually see changes in your life without taking concrete action. Believing you will land a six-figure job or find your dream apartment in your price range is a good place to start, for example, but you will most likely have to go looking for those things and take action like applying to jobs or working with a broker <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2025/01/03/to-be-successful-in-2025-a-therapist-says-do-these-5-things.html\">to be successful</a>.</p><p>Manifesting may seem to work in some situations because of confirmation bias, Evans says. For example, if you're manifesting that money will come to you and then you happen to find $20 on the ground, believers may argue that the manifestation is working. But if you're manifesting thousands of dollars to make your rent or pay off a large debt, you're most likely going to have to take a more active approach than assuming money is going to keep falling into your lap.</p><p>That doesn't mean you should take the opposite approach and tell yourself <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2024/05/19/neuropsychologist-4-tips-to-stop-the-cycle-of-negative-self-talk.html\">you're not going to</a> accomplish the goal.</p><p>\"We believe the things that we say to ourselves,\" Evans says. \"If you're telling yourself over and over and over again, 'it's not going to work out for me,' you're going to find ways to confirm that bias versus: 'It is going to work out for me.'\"</p><p>But on top of telling yourself it's going to work out, you should be taking steps in that direction.</p><p>\"Taking action along side the [abundance] mindset work is imperative. Whether that means applying while you manifest your dream job, creating a financial plan or getting support to help you navigate getting out of debt, action is needed,\" Evans says. \"Your manifestations may set the direction you want to go, but I need your actions to build out the path for your financial wellness.\"</p><p><em><strong>Want to be your own boss?</strong> Sign up for Smarter by CNBC Make It's new online course, </em><a href=\"https://smarter.cnbcmakeit.com/p/how-to-start-a-business-for-first-time-founders?utm_source=cnbc&utm_medium=makeitarticle&utm_campaign=bottom\" target=\"_blank\"><em>How To Start A Business: For First-Time Founders</em></a><em>.

Behind them is a depiction of the seal of the Federal Reserve.</p><p>The image appears to be \"AI-generated or digitally illustrated,\" according to visual analysis by ChatGPT.</p><p>Trump has repeatedly criticized Powell for his cautious approach to cutting interest rates, nicknaming him \"Too Late Powell.\" The latest threat came even as the central bank lowered rates earlier this month for the first time this year. Powell's term as chair ends in May 2026.</p><p>The White House didn't immediately respond to CNBC's request for comment.</p><p>Firing the top central banker would be unprecedented as no U.S. president ever has attempted to do so, though others have criticized prior Fed chairs. A recent <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2025/05/22/supreme-court-federal-reserve-trump.html\">Supreme Court decision</a> indicated that the president does not have the authority to remove Fed officials at will.  Powell has said repeatedly that his firing is \"not permitted under the law.\"</p><p>The Trump White House has blasted Powell over renovations to the Fed's Washington headquarters, raising suspicion that Trump could try to remove the Fed leader for cause. Although lately Trump has eased his criticisms of the Fed building, while continuing to be vocal about Powell hurting the economy by keeping rates too high in his view.</p><p>Trump attempted to fire Fed Governor Lisa Cook in August on alleged mortgage fraud. The Supreme Court is set to rule on that matter soon. The Department of Justice on Friday <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2025/09/26/trump-fed-cook-scotus-markets.html\">said</a> in a Supreme Court filing that firing Cook for alleged misconduct would not harm the financial markets. Cook's attorneys argued in a prior filing to the high court that her removal could ruin Fed independence.</p><p>So far, the financial markets have shown little reaction to Trump's Powell threats or Cook's attempted firing. Though many economists and investors believe firing Powell before his term ends could cause longer-term interest rates to rise on the notion the Fed would start to act in Trump's interests and not according to its dual mandate from Congress of stable inflation and low unemployment.</p></div></div>"

Differing from generative AI, agents act independently, can initiate actions, and recall previous work they performed.

They could also be lost time, which relates to money. It could also be a lot of things that you have to undo, which is costly from a financial standpoint. It burns people out to have to do it. It's all of the costs associated with poor implementation,\" Hoffman said.</p><p>The report outlined that the debt could manifest as security risks, poor data quality, low impact AI agents which will waste time and resources for human employees, and a management skills gap.</p><p>Hoffman said this is not an exhaustive list and the \"debt\" could look like a bunch of code created by AI that doesn't work right or AI-generated content that nobody is using.</p><p>New research from BetterUp Labs and Stanford Social Media Lab even found that 40% of desk workers in the U.S. have received <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2025/09/23/ai-generated-workslop-is-destroying-productivity-and-teams-researchers-say.html\">AI-generated \"workslop,\"</a> which the researchers defined as content that looks good but lacks any substance.</p></div><div><p><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2025/09/23/ai-generated-workslop-is-destroying-productivity-and-teams-researchers-say.html\"><img src=\"https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/108202475-1758579102271-gettyimages-700712909-bld240699.jpeg?v=1758579133&w=160&h=90\" /></a></p></div><div><p>It's created almost two hours of extra work for people who encountered it, a $186 invisible tax per month, and a $9 million hit to productivity in a year, per the research.</p><p>\"There's large investment going into this space right now, and ultimately it's a question of whether those investments will pay off,\" Hoffman said.</p><p>Henry Ajder, founder of AI consulting firm Latent Space Advisory, and an advisor to the U.K. government, Meta, and AI video startup Synthesia, emphasized the need for thoughtful implementation and structures.</p><p>\"People who are CTOs or innovation officers, the good ones I've worked with, the ones who I think I did the best position to succeed with it, they aren't sugar coating the disruption that this is going to cost ... as with any kind of fundamental rework, you are going to have problems, you're gonna have bumps in the road,\" Ajder said in an interview.</p></div><h2><a></a>'It's not a magical silver bullet'</h2><div><p>Asana's report found that despite AI adoption surging to 70% in 2025 from 52% in 2024, workers are also facing higher levels of digital burnout.</p><p>Digital exhaustion increased to 84% in 2025 from 75% the prior year, while unmanageable workloads also rose to 77%, per the report.</p><p>Mona Mourshed, founding global CEO of Generation, a U.S.-based employment organization, told CNBC that despite companies rolling out AI tools and encouraging the use of it, workers are still struggling.</p><p>\"The core reason that they're struggling, and we know this from also talking to our own alumni, is that the use case for how and why are you supposed to use this AI tool in the flow of your work is often missing,\" Mourshed said.</p><p>\"Without a clear understanding of what is the use case that's going to make this particular task better, faster, cheaper ... that's what leads to the exhaustion, because you don't know what the intended outcome is,\" she added.</p><p>Mourshed noted that companies are investing in AI in the hopes that overnight work will be performed better, faster and cheaper, but they aren't offering the necessary training or guidelines to enable improvements.</p><p>\"It's not a magical silver bullet, and all of a sudden it does everything you want once you install it ... it's going to be a much more painful journey to get to those benefits than companies that have thought it through.\"</p><p>AI expert Ajder said the correct strategy is carefully testing AI use and building infrastructure around it rather than rushing into the race unprepared.</p><p>\"You don't start by just embedding, you start by piloting, you start by scoping, by sandboxing, by trialing these systems,\" he said.</p><p>This includes everything from the correct training for employees, to thinking about the kind of AI models the business might need. It's much harder to respond to mistakes or malfunctions when there's no procedure in place.</p><p>\"So I'm not saying that you can't take risk thoughtfully when it comes to using AI, but it has to be calculated and it has to be scoped,\" Ajder said.</p></div></div>"

McDonald's is <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2025/07/24/mcdonalds-tests-cosmcs-drinks.html\">testing flavored sodas</a>, like a \"Sprite Lunar Splash,\" at more than 500 locations after winding down its drinks-focused spinoff CosMc's in June. <span><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/YUM/\">Yum Brands'</a><span><span></span></span></span> Taco Bell has also been offering limited-time menu items, like a dirty Mountain Dew Baja Blast.</p></div><h2><a></a>Swig sets a trend</h2><div><p>These days, Swig has grown to more than 140 locations across 16 states. So far this year, its same-store sales have risen 8.2%, according to the privately held company. The Larry H. Miller Company, an investment firm founded by the former Utah Jazz owner, bought a majority stake in Swig in 2022 for an undisclosed sum.</p><p>\"I think we're doing for soda what Starbucks did for coffee,\" Swig CEO Alex Dunn said.</p><p>As Swig has grown, so have the number of chains looking to emulate its success. Rival soda shops like Sodalicious, Fiiz and Cool Sips are also benefiting from the trend. Coffee shops, like <span><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/BROS/\">Dutch Bros.</a><span><span></span></span></span>, have also added it to their menus. And now fast-food chains are hopping on the bandwagon.</p><p>\"It validates that this is a category, and McDonald's and Taco Bell wouldn't be getting into it if it wasn't something that had broad appeal that they could sell everywhere, in thousands of locations,\" Dunn said. \"It's kind of flattering that we created a category that now everybody is copying.\"</p><p>For restaurants, adding dirty soda to the menu is easier than it might sound.</p><p>\"It's a custom drink offering that, one, allows the brands to leverage something that they already have right there: their soda machine,\" said Erica Holland-Toll, culinary director at The Culinary Edge, which advises restaurants on food and beverage innovation. \"Two, it incorporates either a one-touch ingredient, or if they're already open for breakfast, it's quite likely that they've got a creamer in house.\"</p><p>On the other hand, offering customizable coffee drinks is usually much more difficult — which has contributed to the struggles at Starbucks.</p><p>\"The espresso world — that's so much more complicated,\" Holland-Toll said.</p><p>Dirty soda also has wide appeal. With less caffeine than coffee, consumers can drink it all day long. Plus, it's \"much more accessible\" than some coffee house trends, like an espresso tonic, according to Holland-Toll. The bright colors of many dirty sodas also make them more attractive to consumers, who were likely introduced to the trend via a TikTok video.</p><p>But perhaps above all, dirty soda can help restaurants draw in customers who are otherwise feeling thrifty.</p><p>\"It's an affordable fun treat. You're not going out and spending $30 or $50, right?\" said Sally Lyons Watt, chief advisor of consumer goods and foodservice insights for Circana. \"It's something that people can walk away saying, 'Wow, that was yummy' or 'I feel better because I just had that.'\"</p></div><h2><a></a>A pop for beverage companies</h2><div><p>Swig drinks.</p><p>Courtesy: Swig</p></div><div><p>A \"fun treat\" for consumers is adding up for beverage companies, helping reverse the decades-long trend of declining soda consumption in the U.S.</p><p>As health concerns mount and the array of beverage options expands, Americans have been drinking less soda for roughly two decades. In 2004, soda consumption peaked at 15.3 billion gallons, according to Beverage Marketing; by 2024, that figure had slid to 11.87 billion gallons. But consumption of carbonated soft drinks has been ticking up in the last two years, with 2025 estimated to reach 11.88 billion gallons. The rise of dirty soda, plus the growing popularity of prebiotic sodas, has likely helped the segment halt its downward trajectory.</p></div><div><p>Over the years, iced coffee has been stealing what the beverage industry calls \"share of throat\" from soda. With dirty soda, consumers can marry their love of customizing a cold drink with the lower caffeine content and taste of soda.</p><p>\"The carbonation makes it feel lighter in your mouth than coffee, for example,\" Holland-Toll said.</p><p>Dirty soda has also been attracting younger consumers who previously didn't drink much Pepsi or Dr Pepper. Swig's core customer base is young women between the ages of 18 and 35, according to Dunn.</p><p>That's true for Holly Galvin, a 31-year-old human resources professional based in Davenport, Iowa. She told CNBC that she rarely drank soda — until she saw dirty soda take the spotlight in the \"The Secret Lives of Mormon Wives\" last year. Now she makes her own dirty soda once or twice a week at home. With the onset of autumn, her go-to recipe these days uses Diet Dr Pepper as a base, with pumpkin spice creamer and a sprinkle of pumpkin pie spice on top.</p><p>Broadly, younger consumers are more inclined to seek out new drinks compared with older cohorts. Nearly three-quarters of Generation Z try a new beverage every month on average, according to Keurig Dr Pepper's 2025 trend report.</p><p>Beverage companies say that they are seeing a broader halo effect for soda as a result of the trend.</p><p>\"For us, it serves as a recruitment tool, bringing new users into the trademark,\" said Katie Webb, vice president of innovation and transformation for <span><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/KDP/\">Keurig Dr Pepper</a><span><span></span></span></span>. \"It really draws them all the way back to the base brand, which ends up being extremely impact for us long after.\"</p><p>And just as craft cocktail culture led to the rise of canned cocktails, the popularity of dirty soda is leading beverage giants to cash in with ready-to-drink versions that capitalize on the trend. Dr Pepper Creamy Coconut was the company's most successful limited-time carbonated soft drink to date, based on retail dollar sales, according to Webb. And Kirkham said Pepsi Wild Cherry & Cream has been one of the fastest-growing flavor segments for the company.</p><p>\"Some trends start retail and move over to foodservice,\" Circana's Lyons Wyatt said. \"This one was a foodservice trend moving into retail.\"</p><p>With Pepsi Wild Cherry & Cream and next year's launch of Dirty Dew and the Mug Floats Vanilla Howler, Kirkham expects that consumers will become even more creative with their concoctions.</p><p>\"I think it's actually giving [consumers] the chance to experiment even more and customize more,\" he said. \"Now you have a brand new base.\"</p></div></div>"

    "body": "<div><div><p>After decades in the business world, Maya Rogers knows that not all career advice is worth taking.</p><p>Rogers, 47, is the CEO of Tetris, the video game her dad, Henk Rogers, helped bring to the world in the 1980s and created a company around in 1996.</p><p>Rogers was charting her own path at companies like Honda and Sony when, in 2005, her father had a near-fatal heart attack at age 52. It was a \"wakeup call,\" Rogers tells CNBC Make It, and so she moved home from LA to Honolulu to learn from and work with him.</p><p>Rogers joined the company as a director of business development in 2007 and took over as president and CEO by 2014.</p><p>She's since gotten <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2025/05/21/i-asked-3000-highly-successful-people-for-their-best-career-advice-here-are-their-top-tips.html\">a lot of advice</a> as the boss of Tetris, but not all of it has been worthwhile.</p><p>She once consulted a trusted advisor about an opportunity to create a crossover project with Puyo Puyo, a popular puzzle game series in Japan. At the time, it was largely unknown outside of Japan, Rogers says, and the advisor cautioned that the partnership could dilute the Tetris brand.</p><p>\"After careful consideration, I decided to move forward, believing it was an opportunity to bring a fresh twist to Tetris and expand our audience,\" Rogers says.</p><p><a href=\"https://tetris.com/products/video-game/puyo-puyo-tetris\" target=\"_blank\">Puyo Puyo Tetris</a> launched in 2014 and has grown into a series with several installments that have sold millions of copies worldwide, Rogers says. The opportunity strengthened Tetris' presence in Japan, introduced Puyo Puyo to new audiences globally, and inspired a competitive esports scene, she adds.</p><p>\"This experience taught me that trusted advice is valuable, but sometimes the boldest decisions come from trusting your own instincts,\" Rogers says.</p><p>\"Seek as much advice as possible,\" she says. \"But also, at the end of the day, you've got to make mistakes. You might fail. But that's part of the journey. And that's how you learn and grow.\"</p><p>Thoughtful risks can lead to growth, even when they go against conventional advice, she adds: \"You cannot innovate if you never take risks.\"</p></div><h2><a></a>'Nobody succeeds alone'</h2><div><p>In the vein of helping other entrepreneurs take calculated risks, Rogers co-founded Blue Startups in 2012, a venture accelerator that aims to support Hawaii-based and women-led businesses.</p><p>Supporting <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2025/02/24/cnbc-changemakers-how-success-formula-is-evolving-for-women-leaders.html\">women in business</a> is a key issue for Rogers, considering just over <a href=\"https://pitchbook.com/news/articles/the-vc-female-founders-dashboard\" target=\"_blank\">2% of venture capital</a> funding goes to companies with women-only founders, as of 2024 data.</p><p>The accelerator has invested in over 100 businesses and includes a network of over 250 mentors, Rogers says. Some businesses focus on solving issues specific to women, including one that helps military wives find jobs, and another that helps women access medical care.</p><p>\"It's not that women aren't capable, it's just that we're not getting the right exposure to be funded to grow our businesses,\" Rogers says.</p><p>Beyond funding, Rogers says the the accelerator's network of mentors has been invaluable: \"Nobody succeeds alone,\" she says. \"You hear time and time again that when people start a company, they had somebody that helped them along the way.\"</p><p>Mentorship has played a role her in own career by providing a community of supporters to help her recognize achievements she's quick to downplay, like <a href=\"https://licensinginternational.org/news/women-in-toys-licensing-entertainment-presents-2025-wonder-women-award-winners-in-los-angeles/\" target=\"_blank\">a recent award</a> from the Women in Toys industry group.</p><p>\"It's so hard to take compliments, especially as women. But we're the biggest champions of other people,\" Rogers says. \"As women we lead with heart, we can lead with confidence [and] intuition. Getting validation from mentors is a big part of it, like 'Oh yeah, I should be proud.'\"</p><p><em><strong>Want to be your own boss?</strong> Sign up for Smarter by CNBC Make It's new online course, </em><a href=\"https://smarter.cnbcmakeit.com/p/how-to-start-a-business-for-first-time-founders?utm_source=cnbc&utm_medium=makeitarticle&utm_campaign=bottom\" target=\"_blank\"><em>How To Start A Business: For First-Time Founders</em></a><em>.
