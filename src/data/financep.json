    "body": "<div><div><p>In a photo taken on May 26, 2016 a mobility scooter sits parked before rice fields in Gunwi, some 200 kilometres south of Seoul.\nBy 2030, a quarter of all South Koreans will be over 65 years old, and the overall population is expected to peak at around 52 million the same year before entering a period of steady decline. This so-called \"silver tsunami\" poses a major challenge for Asia's fourth-largest economy as the young, working-age population declines and the cost of caring for the elderly escalates. And in remote, rural communities like Gunwi, which lies some 200 kilometers southeast of Seoul, the trend is exacerbated by a youth exodus to the cities for work.</p><p>Ed Jones | Afp | Getty Images</p></div><div><p>South Korea is staring down a demographic freight train. The country, known as one of the \"Four Asian Tigers\" for its meteoric economic rise from postwar poverty, is confronting a demographic cliff that could stall growth within two decades, studies warn.</p><p>The Bank of Korea in 2024 <a href=\"https://www.bok.or.kr/eng/bbs/B0000354/view.do?menuNo=400409&nttId=10090724\" target=\"_blank\">projected</a> that the nation's rock-bottom birth rate will be one of the factors that will push it into a prolonged downturn by the 2040s.</p><p>A <a href=\"https://www.kdi.re.kr/eng/research/analysisView?art_no=3671\" target=\"_blank\">separate study</a> by the Korea Development Institute in May said demographic shifts will keep dragging on potential growth, which could fall to near zero by the 2040s. In its projections, South Korea's economy could contract by 2047 in a neutral scenario — or as early as 2041 in a pessimistic one.</p><p>South Korea's <a href=\"https://kosis.kr/statHtml/statHtml.do?sso=ok&returnurl=https%3A%2F%2Fkosis.kr%3A443%2FstatHtml%2FstatHtml.do%3Fconn_path%3DI3%26tblId%3DDT_1B81A21%26language%3Den%26orgId%3D101%26\" target=\"_blank\">birth rate currently stands at 0.748 in 2024</a>, a slight rise from the record low of 0.721 in 2023. That compares with an Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development average of <a href=\"https://www.oecd.org/en/publications/korea-s-unborn-future_75aa749c-en.html\" target=\"_blank\">1.43 in 2023</a>. The commonly cited \"replacement rate\" for countries to prevent a declining population is 2.1.</p><p>What a 0.72 fertility rate means for South Korea is that for every 100 Koreans, they would have about 36 children at current levels, shrinking the workforce across generations. That would cut into productivity and slow growth, experts say.</p></div><h2><a></a>Miracle for 'miracle on the Han River'?</h2><div><p>If technological innovation fails to offset this decline, Korea will see a \"sustained economic slowdown,\" Lee In-sil, Director of the Korea Peninsula Population Institute for Future, told CNBC.</p><p>And it's not for lack of trying. The country has rolled out package after package of support measures for newlyweds to have children, including baby bonuses and cash rewards. Seoul expended over $270 billion over the past 16 years on incentives to promote childbirth, according to a <a href=\"https://jme.bmj.com/content/51/6/371\" target=\"_blank\">2024 paper in the Journal of Medical Ethics</a>.</p><p>In 2023, Seoul even mooted an idea to <a href=\"https://time.com/6265842/south-korea-birth-rate-military-service-exemption/\" target=\"_blank\">exempt men from its mandatory military service</a> if they had three or more children before the age of 30.</p><p>But such efforts have made little impact in a country hailed as the \"Miracle on the Han River\" for its rapid postwar rise. \"I don't think there's any way that population policy can effectively raise fertility levels in South Korea in any appreciable way,\" Nicholas Eberstadt, a political economist at the American Enterprise Institute, told CNBC.</p></div><div><p>People cycle along a track backdropped with the city skyline in Singapore on June 27, 2025.         </p><p>Roslan Rahman | Afp | Getty Images</p></div><p>While South Korea's total fertility rate had marginally increased in 2024, \"we should not be popping the champagne corks,\" Eberstadt said, as it is still far below the 2.1 replacement rate. He noted that the desired family size in South Korea is still below the 2.1 replacement rate, which means that while the TFR might climb higher, it will not reach the 2.1 figure.</p><h2><a></a>Pension impact</h2><div><p>A shrinking workforce will also squeeze the pension system. In March, South Korea passed its first <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/south-korea-approves-reforms-shore-up-830-bln-state-pension-fund-2025-03-20/\" target=\"_blank\">pension fund reform</a> in 18 years, extending the depletion of the state pension fund by 15 years to 2071.</p><p>Among South Korea's four major pension systems — military, private school employees, civil servants, and national pensions — the military pension and civil servants' pension have already been depleted, Lee said.</p><p>Current reforms will see a structure where younger generations pay higher premiums while receiving lower benefits, which will inevitably lead to criticism for transferring the burden to future generations, she added.</p><p>A smaller draft pool also has defense implications. South Korea's active troops <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/south-koreas-military-has-shrunk-by-20-six-years-male-population-drops-2025-08-10/#:~:text=SEOUL%2C%20Aug%2010%20(Reuters),a%20report%20said%20on%20Sunday.\" target=\"_blank\">have fallen 20%</a> to about 450,000, down from 690,000 in 2019. South Korean armed forces are augmented by 28,500 U.S. troops, and Seoul has a mutual defense treaty with Washington.</p><p>South Korea is still formally at war with North Korea, as the Korean War in 1953 ended with a ceasefire, not a peace treaty. North Korea boasts one of the largest standing military forces in the world, with around 1.23 million personnel.</p></div><h2><a></a>No reason to be pessimistic</h2><div><p>Despite the bleak outlook for Asia's fourth-largest economy, some analysts caution against despair.</p><p>Lee, who was also the former director general of the national statistics agency, said economies can find ways to adapt.</p><p>\"When an economy faces recession, it typically responds with various efforts to enhance productivity through technological innovation, immigration policies, and other measures to prevent further decline,\" she said.</p><p>AEI's Eberstadt also noted that South Korea can maintain and even increase its prosperity despite aging and shrinking. He pointed to the 1970s, when fears of resource scarcity grew as the world's population surged and doubts arose about how to feed it.</p><p>In 1968, the book The Population Bomb, co-authored by former Stanford University professor Paul Ehrlich and researcher Anne Ehrlich, predicted global famine and a rising death rate as the population grew.</p><p>However, 50 years later, the world is \"richer, better educated, better fed, better housed, more prosperous, much less absolute poverty, than when the world was smaller,\" Eberstadt said.</p><p>KPPIF's Lee said that, considering the Korean government's rapid policy changes and evolving public awareness in recent years, she is confident that breakthrough solutions will emerge.</p><p>Very few people would have bet that South Korea could accomplish what it has today when the Korean War halted in 1953, Eberstadt said<strong>.</strong></p><p>\"Human beings are a uniquely adaptable,\" he added. \"This is a very different sort of challenge, but I don't think that the record of the immediate past suggests that it's smart money to bet against South Korean population.\"</p></div></div>"

Since 1994, the five-year survival rate of small businesses in the U.S. has hovered around just over 50%, per the <a href=\"https://www.bls.gov/spotlight/2024/business-employment-dynamics-twentieth-anniversary/?utm_source=chatgpt.com\" target=\"_blank\">Bureau of Labor Statistics</a>.

But even working on these companies began to feel \"soulless and hollow after a while,\" he added.</p><p>Entrepreneurship is often sold as something of a utopia — unshackled from the bureaucracy and politics of corporate life. But over the past few decades, founder life has also become synonymous with <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2024/09/24/this-29-year-old-millionaire-says-having-work-life-balance-is-a-myth.html\">hustle culture</a>.</p><p>Silicon Valley's startup scene mythologizes seven-day work weeks, while China's tech companies are infamous for the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2025/06/08/europe-startups-resists-pressure-to-adopt-chinas-996-work-culture.html\">996 culture</a> – working 9 a.m. to 9 p.m., six days a week.</p></div><div><p><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2025/07/08/vc-behind-996-work-culture-debate-defends-7-day-work-weeks-.html\"><img src=\"https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/108166954-1751461509661-2024_10_02HARRYSTEBBINGS7781_4.png?v=1751899126&w=160&h=90\" alt=\"Harry Stebbings, founder of 20VC, says billion-dollar firms aren't built on five-day work weeks.\" /></a></p></div><p>So how do founders — who are used to this all-encompassing and high-pressure life — bounce back from failure?</p><h2><a></a>'I lost a lot of my identity'</h2><div><p>Moving on from a failed business can require owning up to mistakes and disappointing people, including employees and investors.</p><p>Klaas Ardinois founded CommVision in 2024, a U.K.-based software development company that shut down a year later. He said the biggest emotional challenge of failing was disappointing investors who put money in the company, and laying off employees whose lives were upended.</p><p>Ardinois, who pins the failure on a market mismatch and being misled by a venture capital firm, said he had persuaded employees from a previous company to join CommVision.</p><p>\"Emotionally, it was really hard to get to that point of A: admitting that your business is failing. Then B: having to deal with the fallout of 'I'm about to upset people's lives quite dramatically,\" he said.</p><p>\"It's not like: 'Hey we could work something out.' It's: 'You've got four weeks, and I know you're financially stretched because you bought a house and you're about to have a baby,' so that was really hard.'\"</p><p>Meanwhile, Latvia-based Ainars Klavin founded augmented reality agency Overly in 2013, which nearly went bankrupt twice. But despite turning it around and making 1.5 million euro ($1.75 million) turnover in 2022, Klavins quit as a result of burnout.</p><p>He then gave startup life another chance and poured 500,000 euros into his next startup, which he left in 2024 as it was struggling.</p></div><blockquote><div><p>\"The biggest risk isn't failure, the biggest risk is success without clarity.\"</p><div><p>Ismael Dainehine</p><p>Co-founder of EverGive</p></div></div></blockquote><div><p>Now a lead product manager at proptech startup Giraffe360, Klavins told CNBC Make It that he experienced an identity crisis when transitioning from being a founder to a corporate employee.</p><p>\"When you exit through an unsuccessful business, you really start to question: what are you good at? Because at that point it seemed like I'm not good at anything,\" he said.</p><p>\"I have sacrificed so much to make this successful that I have lost a lot of my identity … It's very scary to lose your identity, because you have sacrificed a lot of other things that were part of your identity to make this one work, and if you lose it, you have nothing.\"</p></div><h2><a></a>Founders are the best employees</h2><div><p>Founders who return to corporate life as an employee may feel some shame or stigma attached to the transition, and employers could even discriminate against them.</p><p>A <a href=\"https://www.business.rutgers.edu/news/study-reveals-hiring-bias-against-former-business-owners\" target=\"_blank\">2024 study</a>, led by Rutgers Business School, sent fake resumes to 219 people with corporate recruiting experience. The fictional applications had identical qualifications, but some were former business owners.</p><p>It found that recruiters were less likely to recommend former business owners for a role, in what's described as an \"entrepreneurship penalty\" in the study. Recruiters appeared to be more hesitant to hire someone who is used to being their own boss and working autonomously.</p><p>However, public relations specialist Alain Rapallo said that founders can actually make the best employees.</p><p>Rapallo left his corporate role as a PR director to start his own agency in 2021, but returned to employee life just three years later.</p><p>Entrepreneurship is an advantage, he said, \"because when you are a founder and you work by yourself, if you make it past that first year, you pretty much did every role that any company does on a smaller scale, but you pretty much did it.\"</p><p>Rapallo said running a business also sharpens skills like multitasking and time management.</p><p>\"Startups are scrappy, but you [as an employee] don't necessarily do every single job. You don't have the mentality of growing the business. You usually just have the mentality of taking care of the client or the account,\" he added.</p><p>Product manager Klavins agreed that his understanding of numerous business functions was what got him his current role.</p><p>Being an employee has also been an important lesson in humility, he said, as it eliminated his ego and allowed him to start fresh.</p></div><h2><a></a>Reframing success and failure</h2><div><p>Serial entrepreneur Dainehine said it was important to redefine what success and failure meant to him in order to move forward.</p><p>\"The biggest risk isn't failure, the biggest risk is success without clarity,\" he explained, saying that without a clear set of principles, success will always be elusive.</p><p>\"The biggest advice I've had for entrepreneurs in that stage is to develop or commit to something that has a very deep sense of purpose and mission to you. A weak or opportunistic mission can't carry you through the hardest days,\" he said.</p><p>\"Once I focused on a mission I actually believed in, the same setbacks became survivable. So, if they can either pivot into something that adheres to that or find that within their current companies, I think that will build up their resilience to power through and reframe failure.\"</p></div></div>"

Nexstar owns about 30 in markets including Salt Lake City and New Orleans.</p><p>Kimmel <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2025/09/23/jimmy-kimmel-returns-abc-disney-kirk.html\">addressed</a> the situation — and the ongoing preemptions — during his returning show this week.</p><p>\"We are still on the air in most of the country, except, ironically, from Washington, D.C., where we have been preempted,\" Kimmel said during Tuesday's monologue. \"After almost 23 years on the air, we're suddenly not being broadcast in 20% of the country, which is not a situation we relish.\"</p><p>Sinclair said Friday it had proposed measures to \"strengthen accountability, viewer feedback, and community dialogue\" at ABC and its affiliates.</p><p>\"While ABC and Disney have not yet adopted these measures, and Sinclair respects their right to make those decisions under our network affiliate agreements, we believe such measures could strengthen trust and accountability,\" it said.</p><p>Nexstar said in a statement: \"We have had discussions with executives at The Walt Disney Company and appreciate their constructive approach to addressing our concerns.\"</p><p>Disney declined to comment Friday.</p><p>Kimmel's suspension last week came shortly after Nexstar announced it would not air the program in light of the host's comments. Sinclair soon after said it would likewise preempt the program.</p><p>Those announcements followed comments from Federal Communications Commission Chairman Brendan Carr that <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2025/09/18/jimmy-kimmel-charlie-kirk-fcc-carr.html\">suggested</a> ABC affiliate stations could be at <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2025/09/19/trump-threatening-broadcast-station-licenses-explained.html\">risk of losing</a> broadcast station licenses over Kimmel's remarks, which came during a show monologue.</p><p>The series of events raised questions about influence by the Trump administration on the media and First Amendment protections.</p><p>\"Our decision to preempt this program was independent of any government interaction or influence,\" Sinclair said Friday. \"Free speech provides broadcasters with the right to exercise judgment as to the content on their local stations. While we understand that not everyone will agree with our decisions about programming, it is simply inconsistent to champion free speech while demanding that broadcasters air specific content.\"</p><p>Earlier this week, Sen. Maria Cantwell, D-Wash., <a href=\"https://www.cantwell.senate.gov/news/press-releases/cantwell-calls-on-sinclair-broadcasting-to-quit-blocking-publics-ability-to-watch-jimmy-kimmel-live\" target=\"_blank\">sent a letter</a> to Sinclair pushing to bring \"Jimmy Kimmel Live!\" back on air. Sinclair owns the Seattle ABC affiliate station.</p><p>Nexstar similarly denied any government influence. </p><p>\"As a local broadcaster, Nexstar remains committed to protecting the First Amendment while producing and airing local and national news that is fact-based and unbiased and, above all, broadcasting content that is in the best interest of the communities we serve,\" Nexstar said in a statement. </p><p>\"We stand apart from cable television, monolithic streaming services, and national networks in our commitment – and obligation – to be stewards of the public airwaves and to protect and reflect the specific sensibilities of our communities,\" the statement continued. \"To be clear, our commitment to those principles has guided our decisions throughout this process, independent of any external influence from government agencies or individuals.\"</p></div>"

The announcement paused the liquidation process at most Claire's stores.</p><p>\"We went and started to do some very deep due diligence, and we came to the conclusion that this was a broken business, not a broken brand,\" Ames Watson co-founder Lawrence Berger told CNBC.</p><p>Ames Watson's portfolio includes makeovers of other businesses, including hat retailer Lids and women's retailer South Moon Under. Berger said the company, which has more than $2 billion in revenue, thinks of itself as a \"mini Berkshire Hathaway,\" buying and transforming companies without any intentions of selling them.</p><p>On top of its mounting debt, Claire's has been facing a multitude of challenges. The retailer is expected to face headwinds from President <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/donald-trump/\">Donald Trump</a>'s global tariffs, and malls have seen dwindling traffic over the past few years. Competitors, like Studs and Lovisa, have also popped up, aiming to offer sleeker ear piercing experiences.</p><p>Fellow Ames Watson co-founder Tom Ripley said he was first introduced to Claire's through his twin daughters, who both got their ears pierced at one of the retailer's stores over a decade ago. Ripley said that experience, coupled with customers' loyalty to the brand, showed him that it was worth investing in.</p><p>\"It's a temple to girlhood and that place you buy your first lip gloss, a friendship bracelet and your first piercing,\" Ripley told CNBC. \"Claire's has been a rite of passage to generations.\"</p></div><div><p><img src=\"https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/108183262-1754598339126-gettyimages-2221758888-img_6156_9f8o11ui.jpeg?v=1755707326&w=750&h=422&vtcrop=y\" alt=\"The rise and fall of Claire's\" /><span></span><span><div><p><span>watch now</span><span></span></p></div></span></p></div><h2><a></a>Revitalization plan</h2><div><p>Ames Watson identified three core areas from the company's research that it believes are central to a Claire's rebirth: merchandising, labor and marketing. At the same time, the co-founders said they're intent on retaining the Claire's identity that was so central to millennials.</p><p>With merchandising, Berger said the company plans to update the products in the store to reflect current trends while also retaining the classic look of Claire's products. The new products might include collaborations or exclusives, he added, with the company eyeing a line of products specifically curated for sleepovers.</p><p>\"I think the merchandising, probably 70% of it is pretty good, but there's 30% that I think we need to change,\" Berger said. \"So I think it'll take us six to nine months for the customers to see that.\"</p><p>Ames Watson also plans on increasing pay, benefits and training for store employees, including having a dedicated \"piercing excellence team\" that will travel around the country and train piercers at every store. The piercing stations themselves will also be receiving an upgrade, Berger added.</p><p>Finally, the new Claire's will lean into fresh marketing that connects with the company's nostalgia and will bring customers along for each new step of its makeover, the co-founders said.</p><p>\"We're going to be very, very open with our community about what we're changing, in the hope that we can really connect with them and build a relationship that lasts for many, many years,\" Berger said.</p></div><div><p>Claire's co-founders Tom Ripley and Lawrence Berger</p><p>Photo: Ames Watson</p></div><div><p>The co-founders said their strategy with taking Lids from a struggling retailer to a revitalized business is informing the way they're approaching Claire's. Ames Watson <a href=\"https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/18498/000001849818000050/ex991lids121418.htm\" target=\"_blank\">acquired</a> Lids in 2019 for $100 million<strong> </strong>and grew the company's revenue, enhanced its in-store embroidery experiences and raised pay for employees.</p><p>For Claire's, its piercing business is just as central to its brand as embroidery is to Lids because they're both experiences that customers can't get online, Ripley said. The framework for modernizing Lids without losing its essential business pieces — focusing on product, experience and people — is the same that Ames Watson plans to use for Claire's.</p><p>\"We don't over-leverage, we don't outsource the hard work and we don't flip businesses,\" Ripley said. \"We roll up our sleeves, do the work ourselves and build for the next generation.\"</p><p>Ripley said nostalgia is at the heart of the Claire's brand, and the company is focused on modernizing Claire's without losing its \"magic.\"</p><p>The storefronts will also get revamps, with the iconic purple carpets getting a fresh cleaning and the presentation of the merchandise getting an upgrade.</p><p>\"Part of the wonder and fun of Claire's is the ability to walk in that store, and you don't know what to expect. You sort of meander around, and you discover things,\" Berger said. \"We don't want to change that.\"</p></div><div><p>The co-founders said they hope the rebirth of Claire's will also speak to the millennial moms who would bring their children to stores. The pair said the company is experimenting with adding products in the store for the generation of women who grew up with Claire's at its height.</p><p>With these changes, Ripley and Berger said they hope Claire's will reemerge as the major player it once was in malls across America.</p><p>\"Our hope is that we'll be profitable from day one — that's what our investment thesis is and, to be frank, that's what healthy companies are,\" Berger said. \"We believe that it's structured in a way that it should be profitable, but that means that we've got to do our jobs right.\"</p></div></div>"

    "body": "<div><div><p>Google CEO Sundar Pichai waves as he arrives to attend the Artificial Intelligence (AI) Action Summit at the Grand Palais in Paris, France, February 11, 2025. </p><p>Benoit Tessier | Reuters</p></div><div><p><span><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/GOOGL/\">Google</a><span><span></span></span></span> long touted the need for factually accurate information on its platforms, but a letter submitted to Congress this week demonstrates how the tech company is shifting to prioritize \"free expression.\"</p><p>The company's YouTube division on Tuesday <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2025/09/23/youtube-creators-banned-covid-election-misinformation-apply-reinstatement.html\">said</a> it will soon allow accounts that were previously banned for spreading misinformation related to Covid-19 and the 2020 U.S. election to apply for reinstatement. The company made the announcement through the <a href=\"https://judiciary.house.gov/sites/evo-subsites/republicans-judiciary.house.gov/files/evo-media-document/2025-09-23-letter-to-hjc.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">letter</a>, which was penned by Alphabet lawyer Daniel Donovan and sent to House Judiciary Chair Jim Jordan, R-Ohio.</p><p>That announcement effectively rolled back a policy that had treated violations as lifetime bans.</p><p>Google's new stance comes despite the company touting the need for accuracy and fact-checking as far back as 2016 and throughout the pandemic. During that time, the company has used third party fact-checkers and trust and safety teams monitoring misinformation.</p><p>Donovan's letter is the latest backtrack from the company that once positioned itself as a bastion for accurate information but is increasingly touting \"free expression.\" Google isn't alone. Meta similarly <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2025/01/07/meta-eliminates-third-party-fact-checking-moves-to-community-notes.html\">changed</a> its speech policies in January, just before the second inauguration of <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/donald-trump/\">President Donald Trump</a>.</p><p>YouTube's new reinstatement policy comes as Alphabet is under heavy regulatory pressure. The company <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2024/08/05/google-loses-antitrust-case-over-search.html\">lost</a> back-to-back antitrust cases brought by the Department of Justice related to Google's dominance in online search and advertising. Google is also <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2025/08/07/google-trump-settlement-democrats.html\">in talks</a> with Trump lawyers after a lawsuit stemmed from the suspension of the president's social media accounts after the Jan. 6 Capitol riot. Trump <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2021/07/07/trump-says-he-is-suing-facebook-google-twitter-dorsey-zuckerberg-pichai.html\">filed suits</a> against Facebook, the company formerly known as Twitter and YouTube later in 2021, and he settled with Meta and X earlier this year. </p><p>\"Google is committed to free expression and works to connect users with a broad range of high quality, relevant information,\" the company told CNBC in a statement, adding that it does not rely on external fact checkers for ranking content in products like Search or YouTube.</p><p>The company added that it is continue to invest in new technologies like SynthID, a watermarking tool that shows when content is AI-generated, and Community Notes, a feature that allows users to annotate content on YouTube with additional context.</p></div><div><p>Republican presidential nominee and former U.S. President Donald Trump and Representative Jim Jordan (R-OH) speak on Day 2 of the Republican National Convention (RNC), at the Fiserv Forum in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, U.S., July 16, 2024. </p><p>Mike Segar | Reuters</p></div><h2><a></a>The importance of 'accurate information'</h2><div><p>Google first ramped up its fact-checking operations ahead of the 2016 U.S. elections.</p><p>The company had faced growing concerns over misinformation, and false or misleading stories often ranked highly in Search or appearing in Google News.</p><p>Alphabet <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2016/10/14/google-news-launches-fact-check-tab-in-search-results-just-ahead-of-the-us-elections.html\">added</a> a fact-checking category to Google News in October 2016. The \"Fact Check\" tag used the program ClaimReview to highlight articles from verified fact-checking organizations like PolitiFact and Snopes. With the new tag, Google said it wanted \"to help readers find fact checking in major news stories.\"</p><p>\"We're excited to see the growth of the Fact Check community and to shine a light on its efforts to divine fact from fiction, wisdom from spin,\" Google <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2016/10/14/google-news-launches-fact-check-tab-in-search-results-just-ahead-of-the-us-elections.html\">said</a> at the time.</p><p>In 2017, Google <a href=\"https://blog.google/products/search/fact-check-now-available-google-search-and-news-around-world/#:~:text=For%20the%20first%20time%2C%20when,making%20their%20own%20informed%20opinions.\" target=\"_blank\">expanded</a> its \"Fact Check\" tag globally and to its search results. It showed results from third-party fact-checking organizations that were verified by the International Fact-Checking Network (IFCN) or similar bodies. The fact-checked tags in search results showed information about the accuracy of a claim, who made the claim and who fact checked the claim.</p><p>\"Even though differing conclusions may be presented, we think it's still helpful for people to understand the degree of consensus around a particular claim and have clear information on which sources agree,\" the company <a href=\"https://blog.google/products/search/fact-check-now-available-google-search-and-news-around-world/\" target=\"_blank\">said</a> at the time.</p><p>In 2018, YouTube's then-CEO Susan Wojcicki said the video service would begin including text boxes with \"information cues\" on videos that promote conspiracy theories. The boxes would link to third-party sources that debunk the hoaxes in question, CNBC <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2018/03/13/youtube-wikipedia-links-debunk-conspiracy.html\">reported</a> at the time.</p><p>At a U.S. Congressional testimony that December, Alphabet CEO <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/sundar-pichai/\">Sundar Pichai</a> <a href=\"https://nsarchive.gwu.edu/sites/default/files/documents/5686137/Sundar-Pichai-CEO-Google-Statement-for-the.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">said</a> that users \"look to us to provide accurate, trusted information.\"</p><p>Google's fact-checking efforts took on greater importance following the Covid-19 outbreak. The company faced criticism for misinformation going viral on its properties, including videos on YouTube related to elections, Covid-19 and vaccines.</p><p>In an April 2020 <a href=\"https://blog.youtube/news-and-events/expanding-fact-checks-on-youtube-to-united-states/\" target=\"_blank\">blog</a>, Google said more people were coming to YouTube for news, so it would be \"expanding fact checks on YouTube to the United States.\" To do this, YouTube said it would use the information panels introduced in 2018 to link users to information about Covid-19 from sources like the World Health Organization, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and local health authorities.</p><p>\"The outbreak of COVID-19 and its spread around the world has reaffirmed how important it is for viewers to get accurate information during fast-moving events,\" it said at the time.</p><p>In a May 2020 <a href=\"https://blog.google/inside-google/company-announcements/coronavirus-covid19-response/\" target=\"_blank\">blog </a>titled \"CoronaVirus: How We're Helping,\" Pichai wrote that Google is protecting people from misinformation. </p><p>\"Our Trust and Safety team has been working around the clock and across the globe to safeguard our users from phishing, conspiracy theories, malware and misinformation, and we are constantly on the lookout for new threats,\" Pichai wrote. \"On YouTube, we are working to quickly remove any content that claims to prevent the coronavirus in place of seeking medical treatment.\"</p><p>Still, videos containing inaccurate information began to go viral faster than YouTube could manage by November 2020.</p><p>A <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U4c5dYDD9xw\" target=\"_blank\">video</a> titled \"Trump won\" posted by right-leaning media organization One American News Network on YouTube showed OAN anchor Christina Bobb saying, \"President Trump won four more years in the office last night.\" The video also included unsubstantiated claims of \"rampant voter fraud\" against Republican ballots and urged viewers to \"take action\" against Democrats. The video had more than 300,000 views before YouTube stopped running ads alongside it.</p><p>YouTube does not \"allow ads to run on content that undermines confidence in elections with demonstrably false information,\" a spokesperson for the service <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2020/11/04/youtube-refuses-to-remove-video-that-appears-to-violate-its-policies.html\">said</a> at the time.</p><p>Asked why the video was left up, another YouTube spokesperson said that the service's \"Community Guidelines\" for taking videos down applied to videos that discouraged voting but not to videos that advocate for interference after votes have already been cast.</p><p>Later that month, YouTube <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2020/11/24/youtube-suspends-oann-for-a-week-after-it-posted-fake-covid-19-cure.html\">suspended</a> OAN's account, saying it was \"due to repeated violations of its Covid-19 misinformation policy and other channel monetization policies.\"</p><p>Days after the Jan. 6, 2021, Capitol riot, the company <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2021/01/12/google-suspends-trumps-youtube-account-disables-comments.html\">suspended</a> Trump's YouTube account, saying that the outgoing president's videos violated the service's policies that prohibit content from inciting violence.</p></div><h2><a></a>The importance of 'free expression'</h2><div><p>In 2023, Google began changing its tune.</p><p>That June, Google said that effective immediately it would <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2023/06/02/youtube-will-stop-removing-false-claims-about-2020-election-fraud.html\">stop removing</a> false claims of widespread election fraud in the 2020 presidential race from YouTube.</p><p>YouTube said in a <a href=\"https://blog.youtube/inside-youtube/us-election-misinformation-update-2023/\" target=\"_blank\">blog</a> that it made the decision to balance its twin goals of \"protecting our community and providing a home for open discussion and debate.\" The decision, which came ahead of the 2024 mid-term U.S. elections, undid a policy implemented in December 2020 after President Joe Biden won the 2020 U.S. election.  </p><p>\"In the current environment, we find that while removing this content does curb some misinformation, it could also have the unintended effect of curtailing political speech without meaningfully reducing the risk of violence or other real-world harm,\" the company wrote.</p><p>In March 2023, YouTube <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2023/03/17/trump-youtube-account-restrictions-lifted.html\">reinstated</a> Trump's YouTube channel, allowing him to upload videos once again.</p><p>A year later, Google and YouTube in March 2024 <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-03-01/google-trims-jobs-in-trust-and-safety-while-others-work-around-the-clock\" target=\"_blank\">laid off</a> employees from its trust and safety team as part of broader staff cuts across the company. Those cuts came as others in tech, including Meta, Amazon and the company then known as Twitter, also <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2024/10/23/how-trolls-lawsuits-caused-trust-and-safety-winter-before-election.html\">reduced</a> the size of their respective trust and safety teams.</p><p>The velocity of YouTube's changing speech policies accelerated in 2025.</p></div><div><p>Kent Walker, president and chief legal officer at Alphabet Inc., during an interview in New York, US, on Tuesday, Nov. 19, 2024. </p><p>Victor J. Blue | Bloomberg | Getty Images</p></div><div><p>Google Global Affairs President Kent Walker told a deputy director of the European Commission that it would \"pull out of all fact-checking commitments\" from its software code before letting its services become a code of conduct for the EU's Digital Services Act, according to a January <a href=\"https://www.axios.com/2025/01/16/google-fact-check-eu?\" target=\"_blank\">report</a> by Axios.</p><p>The fact-checking integration required by the European Commission \"simply isn't appropriate or effective for our services,\" Walker wrote in a letter to the deputy director, according to the report.</p><p>The company expanded on this notion in a <a href=\"https://developers.google.com/search/blog/2025/06/simplifying-search-results?hl=en\" target=\"_blank\">blog</a> for developers published in June, saying that it would phase out \"support for a few structured data features in Search,\" including the ClaimReview fact-checking snippets.</p><p>\"Google did not inform fact-checkers that the 10-year collaboration was coming to an end, let alone consult with us on the decision to stop using the fact-checks that we provided for free,\" <a href=\"https://www.niemanlab.org/2025/06/google-kills-the-fact-checking-snippet/\" target=\"_blank\">wrote</a> Clara Jiménez Cruz, CEO of fact-checking foundation <a href=\"http://maldita.es/\" target=\"_blank\">Maldita.es</a> and chair of the European Fact-Checking Standards Network.</p><p>Google told CNBC it never integrated fact checking at scale. The company added that the phase out of ClaimReview was done as part of an effort to simplify its Search results page.</p><p>In August, YouTube TV signed <a href=\"https://variety.com/2025/tv/news/youtube-tv-pro-trump-oan-fox-news-contract-expire-1236499981/\" target=\"_blank\">a multi-year deal</a> with OAN, the same network it had suspended from YouTube after the 2020 U.S. election.</p><p>And with Tuesday's letter, YouTube said it would allow accounts previously banned for spreading misinformation about Covid-19 and the 2020 U.S. election to apply for reinstatement. Among channels previously banned under those rules were some associated with Deputy FBI Director Dan Bongino, former Trump chief strategist Steve Bannon and Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.</p><p>YouTube on Thursday <a href=\"https://x.com/UpdatesFromYT/status/1971208671930556479\" target=\"_blank\">posted</a> on X saying that previously terminated creators had already begun attempting to create new channels. It clarified that the new policy is a \"limited pilot program\" that hasn't formally opened yet.</p><p>\"YouTube has not and will not empower fact-checkers to take action on or label content across the Company's services,\" Alphabet's counsel wrote in its letter to Rep. Jordan.</p><p>In contrast to the letter, YouTube's <a href=\"https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/7630512?hl=en&visit_id=638943356153281683-787288782&rd=1\" target=\"_blank\">help page</a> as of Thursday says the service will display information panels with links to independent fact checks under videos.</p><p>\"If a channel is owned by a news publisher that is funded by a government, or publicly funded, an information panel providing publisher context may be displayed on the watch page of the videos on its channel,\" the help page states.</p><p>Google said it will continue to use information panels on topics that warrant additional context, such as videos that discuss the moon landing. Google said the panels link to more information but never refute claims made within a particular video.</p><p>In the letter, Alphabet's Donovan also wrote that senior Biden administration officials pressed the company to remove \"non-violative user-generated content.\" Donovan wrote that the Biden administration \"sought to influence the actions of platforms based on their concerns regarding misinformation.\"</p><p>\"It is unacceptable and wrong when any government, including the Biden Administration, attempts to dictate how the Company moderates content,\" Donovan wrote. Alphabet \"has consistently fought against those efforts on First Amendment grounds.\"</p><p>Donovan wrote that while YouTube's reliance on health authorities during the pandemic was well intentioned, it \"should never have come at the expense of public debate.\"</p><p>In that five-page letter, Alphabet appeared to take a different tone than it had in the past. There were no mentions of accurate, factual or highly-reliable information, but the company made several mentions of protecting \"free expression.\"</p><p>\"﻿﻿﻿The Company has a commitment to freedom of expression,\" Donovan wrote. \"This commitment is unwavering and will not bend to political pressure.\"</p><p>The House Judiciary Committee published its own press release alongside the Alphabet letter, writing \"Google admits Censorship Under Biden.\"</p><p><strong>WATCH: </strong><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/video/2025/09/24/rep-jim-jordan-on-google-reinstating-banned-youtube-accounts-return-of-jimmy-kimmel.html\">Rep.
