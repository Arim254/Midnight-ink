These visas have underpinned the U.S. tech workforce for decades.</p><p>Some tech executives, including <span><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/NFLX/\">Netflix</a><span><span></span></span></span> co-founder Reed Hastings and <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2025/06/10/openai-cnbc-disruptor-50.html\">OpenAI</a> CEO Sam Altman, have lauded the changes to the H-1B program, but experts told CNBC that the Trump administration's changes could prevent some tech companies — namely startups — from securing top foreign talent. These experts said the changes also run the risk of driving top talent toward other countries.</p><p>\"The short of it is, it would be a disaster for America, for American companies, American competitiveness, American innovation,\" said Exequiel Hernandez, an associate professor at the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania.</p></div><h2><a></a>Tech's reliance on the H-1B program</h2><div><p>The current annual cap for H-1B visas is at 65,000, along with 20,000 additional visas for foreign professionals with advanced degrees.</p><p>In fiscal 2025, <span><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/AMZN/\">Amazon</a><span><span></span></span></span>, <span><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/MSFT/\">Microsoft</a><span><span></span></span></span>, <span><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/META/\">Meta</a><span><span></span></span></span>, <span><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/AAPL/\">Apple</a><span><span></span></span></span> and <span><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/GOOGL/\">Google</a><span><span></span></span></span> are among the top 10 companies that employ the most H-1B holders.

The weighted process would take place when the number of requests for visas exceeds the limit of available spots, and it would be based on wage levels, the proposal said.</p><p>The proposed rule will officially publish in the Federal Register on Wednesday, and it's still subject to change after the administration reviews initial public feedback.</p><p>Hastings called the Trump administration's $100,000 fee a \"great solution,\" in <a href=\"https://x.com/reedhastings/status/1969828972688248953\" target=\"_blank\">a post </a>on X on Sunday.</p><p>\"It will mean H1-B is used just for very high value jobs, which will mean no lottery needed, and more certainty for those jobs,\" he wrote.</p><p>OpenAI's Altman <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2025/09/22/nvidia-openai-ceos-huang-altman-trump-h1b-visas.html\">expressed support</a> for the updates during an interview with CNBC's Jon Fortt on Monday.</p><p>\"We need to get the smartest people in the country, and streamlining that process and also sort of outlining financial incentives seems good to me,\" Altman said.</p></div><h2><a></a>'It kneecaps startups'</h2><div><p>Historically, H-1B visas have cost employers somewhere between $2,000 to $5,000 per application, depending on the size of the company, according to the Immigration Law Group. </p><p>The new $100,000 fee is a big jump for small, cash-strapped startups.</p><p>\"You're not going to find many startups who are going to be willing to pay $100,000 per H-1B, in addition to salary for that H-1B,\" said Adam Kovacevich, CEO of Chamber of Progress, a left-leaning tech industry trade association.</p><p>Even big tech companies could feel some pain and have to reassess who they use H-1Bs for. But their deep pockets come with advantages. </p><p>\"A big firm like Microsoft or Google, even though it's not ideal for them, they have workarounds,\" said Wharton's Hernandez. \"They can offshore jobs, or they're the ones who can make acquisitions.\"</p><p>Garry Tan, the CEO of the popular startup accelerator Y Combinator, criticized the Trump administration's new fee, writing in a LinkedIn<a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/posts/garrytan_a-100k-h1b-fee-wont-bother-big-tech-but-activity-7375204927826169857-Mmr_?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop&rcm=ACoAAClBTFwB3e8ij9qjwcRz2ZX6ZrzRUoQ467w\" target=\"_blank\"> post</a> that \"it kneecaps startups\" and is a \"massive gift\" to overseas tech hubs.</p><p>\"In the middle of an AI arms race, we're telling builders to build elsewhere,\" Tan wrote. \"We need American Little Tech to win—not $100K toll booths.\"</p></div><div><p>A picture shows logos of the Big Tech companies named GAFAM, for Google, Apple, Facebook, Amazon and Microsoft, on June 2, 2023.</p><p>Sebastien Bozon | AFP | Getty Images</p></div><div><h3><strong>China and other competitors loom large</strong></h3><p>U.S. tech companies big and small are fiercely competing with one another – and the rest of the world – as they race to develop the most advanced AI models and applications. Organizations like Meta have shelled out <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2025/06/12/scale-ai-founder-wang-announces-exit-for-meta-part-of-14-billion-deal.html\">billions of dollars</a> to recruit top AI talent in an effort to try and gain an edge.  </p><p>The Trump administration's changes to the H-1B program could complicate similar recruiting efforts. </p><p>\"What this does is that it gives our competitors, other countries, places like Asia, Canada, Europe, they can then attract these employees to create new innovations,\" said Steven Hubbard, a data scientist at the American Immigration Council, which is a nonprofit for immigration advocacy and research. </p><p>One big competitor in the war for talent is China. The world's second-largest economy has long fought against the U.S. for tech dominance, and more recently the AI race.</p><p>Earlier this year, Chinese AI firm <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2025/01/24/how-chinas-new-ai-model-deepseek-is-threatening-us-dominance.html\">DeepSeek</a> rattled global markets after claiming to create a large language chatbot that outperformed competitors at a fraction of the cost. The news raised questions over the significant sums that American tech companies are shelling out on AI.</p><p>Some experts worry that visa changes could deal a victory into China's hands, sending top talent overseas. The move may also deter foreign students from attending university in the U.S. as uncertainty hangs over their post-graduation job prospects.</p><p>\"Those students are going to look at this environment and stay home,\" said Greg Morrisett, vice provost at Cornell Tech. \"It's giving a leg up to both China and India in terms of feeding their startup ecosystems.\"</p><p>For Bradley Tusk, the CEO of Tusk Venture Partners, the changes to the H-1B program are simply \"terrible.\" American companies have to have access to top talent in order to compete at the highest levels, he said.  </p><p>\"America's competitive advantage has always been the ability to attract the best talent from around the world,\" Tusk said. \"To limit our ability to recruit and compete is illogical.\"</p><p><strong>WATCH:</strong> <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/video/2025/09/23/jpmorgan-ceo-jamie-dimon-speaks-out-on-h-1b-visa-changes.html\">JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon speaks out on H-1B visa changes</a></p></div><div><p><img src=\"https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/108202630-17586241471758624144-41778724428-1080pnbcnews.jpg?v=1758624146&w=750&h=422&vtcrop=y\" alt=\"JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon speaks out on H-1B visa changes\" /><span></span><span><div><p><span>watch now</span><span></span></p></div></span></p></div></div>"

Reuters first reported the equity stake proposal.</p><p>Lithium Americas' shares hit a session high of $6.23, up more than 100% over Tuesday's close of $3.07. The miner has a market cap of about $1.5 billion.</p><p>It is the latest move by the White House to take direct ownership in the mineral supply chain critical to U.S. interests, but the first such stake proposed for a Canadian company.

GM has a 38% stake and has agreed to buy offtake from the mine when it is operational. Lithium is a critical material for electric vehicle batteries.</p><p>Lithium Americas and GM had to renegotiate the terms of the loan for Thacker Pass because they did not meet the conditions for the first disbursement, the Trump administration official said. During negotiations with the Department of Energy, they requested to push out part of the loan repayment into later years, the official said.</p><p>\"If we're going to push out part of the repayment into later years, then the administration would like a very small stake of equity to create essentially a cash buffer and eliminate some risk on behalf of taxpayers,\" the official said.</p><p>A deal has not been finalized but the Trump administration supports the project and the discussions are positive, the official said.

    "body": "<div><div><p>U.S. Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell speaks during a press conference, following the issuance of the Federal Open Market Committee's statement on interest rate policy, in Washington, D.C., U.S., Sept. 17, 2025. </p><p>Elizabeth Frantz | Reuters</p></div><div><p>Federal Reserve Chair <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/jay-powell/\">Jerome Powell</a> said Tuesday that weakness in the labor market is outweighing concerns about stubborn inflation, leading to a decision he backed to lower the central bank's key interest rate last week.</p><p>The Federal Open Market Committee's <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2025/09/17/fed-rate-decision-september-2025.html\">first cut of the year</a> came amid signs that both supply and demand of workers is waning at the same time that near-term impact from tariffs has pushed inflation higher.</p><p>At such times, Powell said, during a speech to business leaders in Providence, Rhode Island, the Fed's job is to \"balance both sides of our dual mandate\" for stable prices and low unemployment.</p><p>\"Near-term risks to inflation are tilted to the upside and risks to employment to the downside — a challenging situation,\" he said. \"Two-sided risks mean that there is no risk-free path.\"</p><p>The conditions Powell described in the speech are consistent with stagflation, in which growth slows and inflation is high. While the current situation is far less severe than what the U.S. encountered in the 1970s and early '80s, it nonetheless has presented a policy challenge for the Fed.</p><p>Powell, however, said he is comfortable with the central bank's current policy path though he indicated the possibility of additional cuts should the FOMC see the need to be more accommodative.</p><p>\"The increased downside risks to employment have shifted the balance of risks to achieving our goals,\" he said. \"This policy stance, which I see as still modestly restrictive, leaves us well positioned to respond to potential economic developments.\"</p><p>Stocks took a turn lower during Powell's presentation as he said during a question-and-answer period that <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2025/09/23/fed-powell-stock-prices-appear-fairly-highly-valued.html\">assets are \"fairly highly valued.\"</a></p></div><h2><a></a>Watching jobs, inflation</h2><div><p>On the labor market, Powell noted \"a marked slowdown\" in supply and demand. \"In this less dynamic and somewhat softer labor market, the downside risks to employment have risen,\" he said.</p><p>Indeed, payroll growth has slowed dramatically, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2025/09/05/jobs-report-august-2025.html\">averaging below 30,000</a> during the summer months while <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2025/09/09/jobs-report-revisions-september-2025-.html\">benchmark revisions</a> showed nearly a million fewer jobs created in the 12 months prior to March 2025.</p><p>At the same time, inflation has cooled substantially since hitting a more than 40-year peak in 2022 but is still considerably above the Fed's 2% goal. Commerce Department data to be released Friday is expected to indicate that personal consumption prices rose 2.7% on an annual all-items basis and 2.9% when excluding food and energy, Powell said.</p><p>Adding to uncertainty is the impact of President <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/donald-trump/\">Donald Trump</a>'s tariffs. The president continues to negotiate with major U.S. trading partners about the ultimate level for the duties, with a key deadline with China coming up in early November. Fed economists for now are viewing the tariffs as mostly a temporary rise in prices, though that could change.</p><p>\"Uncertainty around the path of inflation remains high,\" Powell said. \"We will carefully assess and manage the risk of higher and more persistent inflation. We will make sure that this one-time increase in prices does not become an ongoing inflation problem.\"</p><p>Powell is presiding over a Fed that has come under intense criticism from the White House and is seeing an unusually wide dispersion in views among officials. The FOMC meeting concluded with participants narrowly split, 10-9, over whether one or two more quarter-point cuts would be appropriate this year. Trump appointee Stephen Miran has pushed for a much more aggressive course, but his term as governor ends in January.</p><p>Earlier Tuesday, Governor Michelle Bowman warned about the dangers of moving too slowly to address the labor market. Bowman, also a Trump appointee, said \"we are at serious risk of already being behind the curve in addressing deteriorating labor market conditions.\"</p><p>\"I am concerned that the labor market could enter into a precarious phase and there is a risk that a shock could tip it into a sudden and significant deterioration,\" she said.</p><p>While Powell has not provided his expectations for future rate moves, Bowman said she hopes the recent action is \"the first step\" in an ongoing move back to a neutral interest rate level.</p></div><div><h2>Don’t miss these insights from CNBC PRO</h2><div><ul><li><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2025/09/16/market-track-record-is-stellar-when-fed-cuts-rates-with-sp-500-at-record.html\">Market track record is flawless when the Fed cuts rates with S&P 500 near record high</a></li><li><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2025/09/16/fed-rate-cuts-will-make-dividend-stocks-more-appealing-for-income-investors-here-are-a-few-standouts.html\">Fed rate cuts will make dividend stocks more appealing for income investors.

However, the technology has evolved so rapidly that the researchers wanted to know whether the models could handle, \"specialized, high-stakes analytical reasoning required for professional financial decision-making.\" The third CFA exam is primarily focused on portfolio management and wealth planning.</p><p>\"I think there's absolutely a future where this technology transforms the industry,\" said Anna Joo Fee, founder and CEO of Goodfin, which contributed to – but did not pay for – the research.</p><p>Still, Fee said she does not think the AI will ultimately replace the CFA.</p><p>\"There are things like context and intent that are hard for the machine to assess right now,\" Fee said. \"That's where a human shines, in understanding your body language and cues.\"</p></div><div><h2>Don’t miss these insights from CNBC PRO</h2><div><ul><li><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2025/09/16/market-track-record-is-stellar-when-fed-cuts-rates-with-sp-500-at-record.html\">Market track record is flawless when the Fed cuts rates with S&P 500 near record high</a></li><li><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2025/09/16/fed-rate-cuts-will-make-dividend-stocks-more-appealing-for-income-investors-here-are-a-few-standouts.html\">Fed rate cuts will make dividend stocks more appealing for income investors.

It is also the largest one-month gain since August 2022. Sales were 15.4% higher than August 2024.</p><p>This count is based on people out shopping in August and signing deals, when the average rate on the 30-year fixed mortgage was higher than it is today. That rate started August at 6.63%, according to Mortgage News Daily, and didn't really move much during the month.</p><p>The sharp decline in rates began in September, when it <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2025/09/16/mortgage-rates-drop-to-3-year-low-ahead-of-fed-meeting.html\">fell to a three-year low</a> of 6.13% the day before the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2025/09/17/fed-rate-decision-september-2025.html\">Federal Reserve cut its lending rate</a>, and then moved higher to where it is now at 6.37%.</p><p>Given that rates hadn't fallen yet, it's curious that August sales jumped so high. Part of the answer may be in the survey itself.</p><p>\"We were expecting a gain but not that large,\" said Robert Dietz, chief economist at the National Association of Home Builders. \"Always important to remember the margin of error for new home sales is large. We'll need to wait for revisions next month and the September data point to see if this is smoothed out.\"</p></div><div><h2>Get Property Play directly to your inbox</h2><div><p>CNBC's Property Play with Diana Olick covers new and evolving opportunities for the real estate investor, delivered weekly to your inbox.</p><p><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/lander?id=propertyplay-newsletter\">Subscribe here to get access today</a>.</p></div></div><div><p>Homebuilder analyst Ivy Zelman of Zelman & Associates said the number was \"directionally right, but the magnitude was way too high.\" She also noted that the Census report has a very small sample size and the big public builders, who together have 60% market share, don't participate. </p><p>Zelman conducts her own survey, which has a higher sample size spanning 15% of homebuilders, and it showed a sales increase of 6% year over year, she said.</p><p>While builders have talked a lot about cutting prices and incentives, the median price of a new home sold in August was $413,500, in increase of 1.9% year over year. In a separate survey on builder sentiment from the National Association of Home Builders, 39% of builders reported cutting prices in September, up from 37% in August and the highest percentage in the post-Covid period.</p><p>New home sales were strongest in the Northeast, where overall new construction is low, so swings can be large. It was also strong in the South, where homebuilding is busiest. Sales, while higher, were weakest in the West, where prices are highest.</p><p>\"While a volatile figure each month and always best to smooth out, I have to believe that the elevated level of home builder incentives was the main catalyst for the large upside surprise to new home sales,\" wrote Peter Boockvar, chief investment officer of One Point BFG Wealth Partner.  \"And we'll, of course, see the impact of lower mortgage rates when the September figure comes out, but keep in mind, if mortgage rates continue down ... builders will then reduce the pace at which they are implementing incentives and thus possibly offsetting the benefit of lower mortgage rates for new homes.\"</p><p>Strong sales took inventory down to a 7.4-month supply in August from a 9-month supply in July, a nearly 18% drop. Single-family housing starts and permits slowed in August both from July and from August of last year. This would seem to indicate that builders expected slower sales.</p></div></div>"
