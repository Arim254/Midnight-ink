The key is to calmly and respectfully acknowledge it, but never surrender your agency. Here are five simple, effective ways to respond. </p><p><em><strong>DON'T MISS</strong></em><a href=\"https://smarter.cnbcmakeit.com/p/how-to-start-a-business-for-first-time-founders?utm_source=cnbc&utm_medium=makeitarticle&utm_campaign=body\" target=\"_blank\"><em><strong>:</strong> <strong>The ultimate guide to starting a business—everything you need to know to be your own boss</strong></em></a> </p></div><h2><a></a>1. 'Thanks for sharing. I'll consider it.'</h2><div><p>This is a polite way to acknowledge someone's input without locking yourself in. It keeps the peace and acknowledges the other person's contribution, while keeping the decision-making power firmly with you.</p><p>This is the softest boundary, best in instances like a colleague weighing in on how you should run your project, or a relative chiming in about your personal choices.</p><p>It is ideal for professional and personal contexts where you want to stay courteous, but not invite any more input. </p></div><h2><a></a>2. 'That's a useful view. I prefer to handle it this way.'</h2><div><p>This shows you're listening to their perspective while keeping the choice of how to act in your hands. It balances respect while honoring your own autonomy, and <a href=\"https://research-repository.griffith.edu.au/server/api/core/bitstreams/ed00d742-1b14-462d-96d6-c7dfa663cc18/content\" target=\"_blank\">research</a> shows that protecting autonomy is key to wellbeing, motivation, and self-belief. </p><p>This is ideal when the advice-giver is senior to you, maybe a boss or mentor. It lets you acknowledge their authority while standing firm in your approach. It's useful when you <em>haven't </em>made a decision yet, but know the direction you want. </p><p>That said, if the advice comes from someone with more experience or oversight, it may make sense to follow their direction unless you have a very strong reason not to. You could add add a brief explanation: \"I prefer to handle it this way, and here's why…\"</p></div><h2><a></a>3. 'I appreciate your input. I already have a plan for how I'll move forward.'</h2><div><p>This respectfully closes the loop while signaling you've got things under control. It also reduces the chance that they'll keep offering repeat advice because you've been clear about having a direction. </p><p>Use this for repeated or insistent advice, like a coworker who keeps pushing their \"better way\" of doing something, or a family member who doesn't trust you to make your own choices. </p><p>It's a firmer step up from \"That's a useful view. I prefer to handle it this way,\" because it explicitly states that you <em>already</em> have<em> </em>a plan.</p></div><h2><a></a>4. 'That means a lot. Right now I'd really value support more than solutions.'</h2><div><p>This reframes the interaction by guiding them toward what you <em>do</em> need, which is emotional support instead of instruction. It channels their good intentions while protecting your sense of control.</p><p>It shines in personal situations, like when friends or family jump in with advice, but what you really need is empathy, and someone to listen.</p><p><a href=\"https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4516598/pdf/nihms686863.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">Research</a> finds that emotional support often help us feel better when we're stressed, while solution-giving can sometimes miss the mark or even backfire. </p></div><h2><a></a>5. 'I hear you. If I need more guidance, I'll reach out.'</h2><div><p>This validates their effort but sets a clear boundary. This approach prevents further unsolicited input while leaving the door open for you to seek advice on your terms.</p><p>It's useful when you need to firmly close the conversation, like when you're getting bombarded with \"shoulds\" at work, or when someone keeps overstepping in your personal life.</p><p>One important thing to keep in mind: Tone changes everything. The very same words can come across as gracious or defensive depending on how you deliver them. Aim for calm, steady, and respectful. That's what makes these responses work.</p><p>Advice will always come, whether you want it to or not.

In remarks heavy with data and citations on theory and interest rate models such as the Taylor Rule, Miran said current monetary policy is significantly more restrictive than the prevailing attitude among his fellow policymakers.</p><p>Using standard policy rules, Miran thinks the federal funds rate, a level that banks charge each other for overnight lending but that influences a wide variety of other rates, should be in the low-2% area. The current funds rate following last week's reduction is targeted between 4%-4.25%.</p><p>\"The upshot is that monetary policy is well into restrictive territory,\" he said. \"Leaving short-term interest rates roughly 2 percentage points too tight risks unnecessary layoffs and higher unemployment.\"</p><p>The views, however, put Miran well outside consensus on the Federal Open Market Committee, where the current approach advocates more caution and a tepid move lower in rates over the next several years.</p><p>At its <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2025/09/17/fed-rate-decision-september-2025.html\">meeting last week</a>, the FOMC voted 11-1 to lower by a quarter percentage point. Miran was the sole dissenter, opting for a half-point cut and putting his individual dot on the committee's \"dot plot\" of expectations in a place that would imply another 1.25 percentage points in reductions this year.</p><p>Earlier Monday, St. Louis Fed President Alberto Musalem, who like Miran is a voter on the FOMC this year, said <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2025/09/22/st-louis-fed-president-musalem-sees-limited-room-for-more-interest-rate-cuts.html\">he sees little room</a> for further cuts. Likewise, Atlanta President Raphael Bostic — who doesn't vote this year — also told The Wall Street Journal he would not support further reductions this year.</p><p>President Donald Trump appointed Miran to the Fed position following former Governor Adriana Kugler's surprise resignation in early August. Like Trump, Miran has been a harsh Fed critic, though he and others described the air at the meeting as collegial and professional.</p><p>Miran pressed his case Monday for lower rates, insisting that inflation is on its way down, particularly in the housing market where cooling rents that had not shown up in the data now will become more apparent.</p><p>Though pushing for cuts, Miran said he is optimistic about economic growth, two positions that under conventional thinking would be at odds. </p><p>\"My view is that policy is roughly 2 points too restrictive, which is considerably restrictive,\" he said during a question-and-answer session after his speech. \"Even though I am expecting growth to be a little better in the future, that could get derailed unnecessarily so and create an output gap where one need not exist if we don't get policy closer to neutral.\"</p><p>He further cited other administration policies, such as its clamp down on immigration, its move to lower business regulations and cut taxes, and the revenue that will be generated from tariffs and its impact on the budget deficit as disinflationary factors.</p><p>\"Labor market statistics and anecdotal evidence suggest border policy is exerting a major impact on the economy,\" he said. \"America's regulatory patchwork has become a material impediment to growth.\"</p><p>Economists at the Fed and elsewhere continue to worry that Trump's tariffs will have a longer-term upward push on inflation. However, Miran said \"relatively small changes in some goods prices have led to what I view as unreasonable levels of concern.\"</p><p>Recent inflation readings, though, have shown prices moving higher and further away from the Fed's 2% inflation mandate.</p><p>Miran is expected to fill the remainder of a term that expires in Jan. 31, 2026, then move back to his position as chair of the Council of Economic Advisers. He peppered his speech with references to CEA research.</p></div>"

It will include around 40 new styles and pieces that can be worn in and outside of the gym. </p><p>Beyond the core apparel line, NikeSKIMS will also debut a handful of seasonal collections – including a vintage line and layering pieces that can be used to create an activewear look. </p><p>After the companies announced the partnership in February, they were set to launch an initial collection in the spring, with a global rollout planned for 2026. But they pushed it<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2025/06/18/nike-skims-kim-kardashian.html\"> back in early June</a> due to internal production delays that weren't related to a supplier or shipping issue. </p><p>NikeSKIMS is marketing the new line alongside a slew of top female athletes, including former tennis star Serena Williams, track and field Olympian Sha'Carri Richardson, gymnast Jordan Chiles and snowboarder Chloe Kim. </p><p>The launch will help Nike move toward a number of goals it set under new CEO Elliott Hill. The assortment's dual focus on performance and lifestyle will allow Nike to capture both female athletes and regular shoppers who are spending on activewear at competitors. The new styles include Nike's drying technology, making them suitable for intense exercise, but also knit pieces and layers that can be incorporated into everyday outfits.</p><p>Under Nike's former CEO John Donahoe, the company focused on its lifestyle side of the business – shoes and apparel that weren't just for exercising – which helped it grow its annual sales <strong>to </strong>north of $50 billion. However, that heavy focus on lifestyle led some of Nike's core athlete customers to shop elsewhere over criticisms it lost sight of innovation.</p><p>Hill, who <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2024/09/19/nike-ceo-john-donahoe-is-out-replaced-by-elliott-hill.html\">took over as Nike's top executive</a> in October, is working to bring <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2025/08/28/nike-to-lay-off-about-1percent-of-corporate-staff.html\">sports and athletes back</a> into the center of Nike's strategy. The partnership with Skims helps the company reach athletes but also has a lifestyle bent, which expands its total addressable market. </p><p>In turn, Skims, which was <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2022/01/27/kim-kardashians-skims-doubles-valuation-to-3point2-billion-after-latest-fundraise-.html\">last valued at $4 billion</a>, will get access to Nike's manufacturing and development capabilities and gains the opportunity for more growth. While buzzy and well known because of its connection to Kardashian, the brand is still relatively small compared to competitors. </p><p>\"NikeSKIMS is more than a collaboration — it's a new brand redefining activewear,\" Skims CEO Jens Grede said in a news release. \"With this launch, we are establishing a platform to grow NikeSKIMS, reach consumers worldwide, and set a new benchmark for how activewear is experienced across retail, digital, and cultural touch points.\"</p><p>Nike President Amy Montagne added the partnership is part of a \"broader commitment\" to women.</p></div></div>"
