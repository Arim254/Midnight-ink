    "body": "<div><p>Stephen Miran, chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers, following a television interview outside the White House in Washington, DC, US, on Tuesday, June 17, 2025. </p><p>Aaron Schwartz | Bloomberg | Getty Images</p></div><div><p>Less than a week after taking his seat, Federal Reserve Governor Stephen Miran on Monday outlined the reasons why he thinks the central bank's benchmark interest rate is far too high and should be lowered aggressively.</p><p>Changes in tax and immigration policy along with easing rental costs, deregulation and incoming revenue for tariffs are creating a different economic landscape that allow the Fed to cut its benchmark rate by nearly 2 percentage points from its current level, the central banker said in remarks before the Economic Club of New York.</p><p>\"The Federal Reserve has been entrusted with the important goal of promoting price stability for the good of all American households and businesses, and I am committed to bringing inflation sustainably back to 2 percent,\" he said. \"However, leaving policy restrictive by such a large degree brings significant risks for the Fed's employment mandate.\"</p><p>Miran sees the confluence of policy changes from the White House lowering the neutral level of interest that neither restricts nor promotes growth. In remarks heavy with data and citations on theory and interest rate models such as the Taylor Rule, Miran said current monetary policy is significantly more restrictive than the prevailing attitude among his fellow policymakers.</p><p>Using standard policy rules, Miran thinks the federal funds rate, a level that banks charge each other for overnight lending but that influences a wide variety of other rates, should be in the low-2% area. The current funds rate following last week's reduction is targeted between 4%-4.25%.</p><p>\"The upshot is that monetary policy is well into restrictive territory,\" he said. \"Leaving short-term interest rates roughly 2 percentage points too tight risks unnecessary layoffs and higher unemployment.\"</p><p>The views, however, put Miran well outside consensus on the Federal Open Market Committee, where the current approach advocates more caution and a tepid move lower in rates over the next several years.</p><p>At its <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2025/09/17/fed-rate-decision-september-2025.html\">meeting last week</a>, the FOMC voted 11-1 to lower by a quarter percentage point. Miran was the sole dissenter, opting for a half-point cut and putting his individual dot on the committee's \"dot plot\" of expectations in a place that would imply another 1.25 percentage points in reductions this year.</p><p>Earlier Monday, St. Louis Fed President Alberto Musalem, who like Miran is a voter on the FOMC this year, said <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2025/09/22/st-louis-fed-president-musalem-sees-limited-room-for-more-interest-rate-cuts.html\">he sees little room</a> for further cuts. Likewise, Atlanta President Raphael Bostic — who doesn't vote this year — also told The Wall Street Journal he would not support further reductions this year.</p><p>President Donald Trump appointed Miran to the Fed position following former Governor Adriana Kugler's surprise resignation in early August. Like Trump, Miran has been a harsh Fed critic, though he and others described the air at the meeting as collegial and professional.</p><p>Miran pressed his case Monday for lower rates, insisting that inflation is on its way down, particularly in the housing market where cooling rents that had not shown up in the data now will become more apparent.</p><p>Though pushing for cuts, Miran said he is optimistic about economic growth, two positions that under conventional thinking would be at odds. </p><p>\"My view is that policy is roughly 2 points too restrictive, which is considerably restrictive,\" he said during a question-and-answer session after his speech. \"Even though I am expecting growth to be a little better in the future, that could get derailed unnecessarily so and create an output gap where one need not exist if we don't get policy closer to neutral.\"</p><p>He further cited other administration policies, such as its clamp down on immigration, its move to lower business regulations and cut taxes, and the revenue that will be generated from tariffs and its impact on the budget deficit as disinflationary factors.</p><p>\"Labor market statistics and anecdotal evidence suggest border policy is exerting a major impact on the economy,\" he said. \"America's regulatory patchwork has become a material impediment to growth.\"</p><p>Economists at the Fed and elsewhere continue to worry that Trump's tariffs will have a longer-term upward push on inflation. However, Miran said \"relatively small changes in some goods prices have led to what I view as unreasonable levels of concern.\"</p><p>Recent inflation readings, though, have shown prices moving higher and further away from the Fed's 2% inflation mandate.</p><p>Miran is expected to fill the remainder of a term that expires in Jan. 31, 2026, then move back to his position as chair of the Council of Economic Advisers. He peppered his speech with references to CEA research.</p></div>"

And he may thereby extinguish the agencies' bipartisanship and independence.\"</p><p>Kagan said the court's conservative majority — which includes three justices whom Trump appointed — may be \"raring\" to overturn Humphrey's.</p><p>\"But until the deed is done, Humphrey's controls, and prevents the majority from giving the President the unlimited removal power Congress denied him,\" she wrote. </p><p>\"Because the majority's stay does just that, I respectfully dissent. Our emergency docket should never be used, as it has been this year, to permit what our own precedent bars.\"</p></div></div>"

Previously, visa fees ranged from $2,000 to $5,000 per application, depending on the size of the company, according to the Immigration Law Group.</p><p>Employers now must have documentation of the payment prior to filing an H-1B petition on behalf of a worker.

Many jobs in the fields of science, technology, engineering and math, or STEM, that generally require at least a bachelor's degree qualify.</p><p>Companies in the tech and finance sectors rely heavily on these specially skilled immigrants, particularly from India and China, which accounted for 71% and 11.7% of visa holders last year, respectively, according to U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services.</p><h3>How many H-1B visas does the tech industry use every year?</h3><p>The current annual cap for H-1B visas is 65,000, along with an additional 20,000 visas for foreign professionals with a master's degree or doctorate from a U.S. institution, according to USCIS. A lottery system is used to select additional petitions if demand exceeds the cap.</p><p>Since 2012, about 60% or more of approved H-1B workers had computer-related jobs, according to Pew Research.</p><p><span><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/AMZN/\">Amazon</a><span><span></span></span></span> was the top employer for H-1B holders in fiscal year 2025, sponsoring more than 10,000 applicants by the end of June, according to USCIS. <span><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/MSFT/\">Microsoft</a><span><span></span></span></span>, <span><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/META/\">Meta</a><span><span></span></span></span> and IT company Tata Consulting Services had more than 5,000 each, while <span><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/AAPL/\">Apple</a><span><span></span></span></span> and <span><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/GOOGL/\">Google</a><span><span></span></span></span> rounded out the top six with more than 4,000 approvals each.</p><p><strong>WATCH: </strong><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/video/2025/09/22/coreweave-ceo-on-h-1b-visas-additional-fee-is-sand-in-the-gears-access-to-talent.html\">CoreWeave CEO on H-1B visas: Additional fee is 'sand in the gears' for access to talent</a></p></div>"

The change will allow children with autism to be treated with the drug, with continued use if kids show language, social or adaptive gains, according to an HHS release.</p><p>But HHS said leucovorin is not a cure for autism and may only lead to improvements in speech-related deficits for a subset of children with the disorder. State Medicaid programs will be able to cover the drug for autism after the label update. The NIH will also start trials to confirm the effects of leucovorin on the disorder, including studies into the medicine's safety.</p><p>While promising, it is important to note that leucovorin is not a cure for ASD and may only lead to improvements in speech-related deficits for a subset of children with ASD. Furthermore, this treatment must be administered under close medical supervision and in conjunction with other non-pharmacological approaches for children with ASD (e.g., behavioral therapy). </p><p>Leucovorin is a form of folate, a B vitamin, that is<a href=\"https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/drugs/19704-leucovorin-tablets\" target=\"_blank\"> typically prescribed to counteract</a> some medications' side effects, including chemotherapy, and to treat vitamin B9 deficiency. Some early<a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39243316/\" target=\"_blank\"> placebo-controlled clinical trials</a> have shown that oral leucovorin, also known as folinic acid, has the potential to improve symptoms in children with autism spectrum disorder.</p><p>The Food and Drug Administration early Monday published a notice saying it is approving a version of leucovorin that was previously made by GSK, the Wall Street Journal reported. But as of Monday afternoon, the<a href=\"https://www.federalregister.gov/public-inspection/current#:~:text=Wellcovorin%20(leucovorin%20calcium)%20Tablets&text=Editorial%20Note:%20An%20agency%20letter%20requesting%20withdraw,document%20was%20received%20after%20placement%20on%20public\" target=\"_blank\"> Federal Register's website</a> said it has received an \"agency letter\" asking to withdraw the notice.</p><p>In a statement, a GSK spokesperson said it does not intend to market leucovorin. The company marketed the drug from 1983 to 1999 under the name Wellcovorin, but the product was withdrawn from the market and has since been available as a generic drug. The spokesperson said label changes made to Wellcovorin will help allow generics already on the market to add this new approval for autism to their labeling.</p><p>Acetaminophen is the latest widely used and accepted treatment that Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has undermined at the helm of the Health and Human Services department, which oversees federal health agencies that regulate drugs and other therapies. Kennedy has also taken steps to change vaccine policy in the U.S., and has <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2025/09/04/rfk-jr-spreads-vaccine-misinformation-during-congressional-testimony.html\">amplified false claims</a> about safe and effective shots that use mRNA technology.</p><p>Kennedy has made autism a key focus of HHS, <a href=\"https://abcnews.go.com/Health/rfk-jr-pledges-answer-autism-epidemic-september/story?id=120694914\" target=\"_blank\">pledging in April</a> that the agency will \"know what has caused the autism epidemic\" by September and eliminate exposures. He <a href=\"https://x.com/SecKennedy/status/1910408577732534570\" target=\"_blank\">also said that month</a> that the agency has launched a \"massive testing and research effort\" involving hundreds of scientists worldwide that will determine the cause.</p><p>Much of the scientific community agrees that autism results from a complex mix of genetic and environmental factors, making it unlikely that rising rates of the disorder are due to a single cause.</p><p>Kennedy said HHS expects several announcements over the coming years that inform parents about the underlying cause of autism and \"potential paths for prevention and reversal.\" He acknowledged that autism is a complex disorder caused by a combination of factors and said HHS is continuing to investigate other factors, such as vaccines.</p><p>\"One area that we are closely examining ... some 40% to 70% of mothers with autism believes that her child was injured by a vaccine,\" Kennedy said. \"President Trump believes that we should be listening to these mothers instead of gaslighting like prior administrations.\"</p><p>Extensive research has debunked longstanding concerns that vaccines are linked to autism, a claim that Kennedy and other immunization critics have pushed for several years.</p></div><h2><a></a>Research on acetaminophen use and autism</h2><div><p>The Washington Post on Friday reported that Trump administration officials have been reviewing previous research that suggests a link between the use of acetaminophen during pregnancy and an increased risk of autism. The Post said that includes <a href=\"https://ehjournal.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12940-025-01208-0\" target=\"_blank\">an August review</a> by Mount Sinai and Harvard researchers on 46 earlier studies that <a href=\"https://www.mountsinai.org/about/newsroom/2025/mount-sinai-study-supports-evidence-that-prenatal-acetaminophen-use-may-be-linked-to-increased-risk-of-autism-and-adhd\" target=\"_blank\">suggest a link</a> between prenatal exposure to the drug and increased risks of neurodevelopmental disorders, such as autism or attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, or ADHD. </p><p>The review found the association is strongest when acetaminophen is taken for four weeks or longer, Dr. Andrea Baccarelli, one of its authors and dean of the faculty at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health, said in a statement. The review was funded by a grant from the National Institutes of Health.</p><p>\"This biological evidence lends support to the possibility of a causal relationship between prenatal acetaminophen exposure and neurodevelopmental disorders, including autism,\" Baccarelli said, adding that further research is needed to \"confirm the association and determine causality.\"</p><p>He said based on existing evidence, he believes that \"caution about acetaminophen use during pregnancy—especially heavy or prolonged use—is warranted.\" But Baccarelli said acetaminophen remains a critical tool for pregnant women and their physicians, as the drug is the only approved medication for pain and fever relief during pregnancy.</p><p>He said he and his colleagues recommend a \"balanced approach based on the precautionary principle:\" patients who need fever or pain reduction during pregnancy should take the lowest effective dose of the drug for the shortest possible duration, after consulting their physician about their individual risks and benefits of doing so. Baccarelli said he discussed that recommendation and the review's findings with NIH Director Jay Bhattacharya and Kennedy in recent weeks.</p><p>The findings of the studies reviewed by the researchers<strong> </strong>are at odds with other robust studies, including one <a href=\"https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2817406\" target=\"_blank\">published last year in the Journal of the American Medical Association</a> that found acetaminophen use during pregnancy was not linked to autism, ADHD or intellectual disability. Researchers analyzed health records of 2.5 million children in Sweden.</p><p>When researchers looked at the general population initially, there was a very small increased risk of the disorder in children whose mothers took the drug while pregnant.
