They found frontier reasoning models, including o4-mini, Gemini 2.5 Pro, and Claude Opus, were able to use \"chain-of-thought prompting\" to successfully pass.</p><p>Previous research, particularly from two years ago, had found AI could clear Levels I and II of the exam, but it struggled with Level III, due to the essay questions. However, the technology has evolved so rapidly that the researchers wanted to know whether the models could handle, \"specialized, high-stakes analytical reasoning required for professional financial decision-making.\" The third CFA exam is primarily focused on portfolio management and wealth planning.</p><p>\"I think there's absolutely a future where this technology transforms the industry,\" said Anna Joo Fee, founder and CEO of GoodFin, which contributed to – but did not pay for – the research.</p><p>Still, Fee said she does not think the AI will ultimately replace the CFA.</p><p>\"There are things like context and intent that are hard for the machine to assess right now,\" Fee said. \"That's where a human shines, in understanding your body language and cues.\"</p></div><div><h2>Don’t miss these insights from CNBC PRO</h2><div><ul><li><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2025/09/16/market-track-record-is-stellar-when-fed-cuts-rates-with-sp-500-at-record.html\">Market track record is flawless when the Fed cuts rates with S&P 500 near record high</a></li><li><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2025/09/16/fed-rate-cuts-will-make-dividend-stocks-more-appealing-for-income-investors-here-are-a-few-standouts.html\">Fed rate cuts will make dividend stocks more appealing for income investors.

Eli Lilly announced in February that it would <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2025/02/26/eli-lilly-to-invest-27-billion-in-new-us-manufacturing.html\">spend at least $27 billion</a> to build four new domestic manufacturing plants, adding to $23 billion in previous investments since 2020. </p><p>Eli Lilly said it will announce the two remaining U.S. sites this year. The company expects to begin making medicines at all four facilities within five years. </p><p>That added production capacity for Eli Lilly's obesity pill, orforglipron, is crucial as the company races to bring it to market and tries to maintain its dominance in the booming market for GLP-1s.

Small molecule drugs, which often come in pill form, are more convenient for patients to take than injectable medications and are generally easier and cheaper to manufacture at scale.  </p><p>Eli Lilly said the site will bring 615 jobs to the Greater Houston area, including highly skilled engineers, scientists, operations personnel and lab technicians, and 4,000 construction jobs.</p></div></div>"

While the current situation is far less severe than what the U.S. encountered in the 1970s and early '80s, it nonetheless has presented a policy challenge for the Fed.</p><p>Powell, however, said he is comfortable with the central bank's current policy path though he indicated the possibility of additional cuts should the FOMC see the need to be more accommodative.</p><p>\"The increased downside risks to employment have shifted the balance of risks to achieving our goals,\" he said. \"This policy stance, which I see as still modestly restrictive, leaves us well positioned to respond to potential economic developments.\"</p><p>Stocks took a turn lower during Powell's presentation as he said during a question-and-answer period that <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2025/09/23/fed-powell-stock-prices-appear-fairly-highly-valued.html\">assets are \"fairly highly valued.\"</a></p></div><h2><a></a>Watching jobs, inflation</h2><div><p>On the labor market, Powell noted \"a marked slowdown\" in supply and demand. \"In this less dynamic and somewhat softer labor market, the downside risks to employment have risen,\" he said.</p><p>Indeed, payroll growth has slowed dramatically, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2025/09/05/jobs-report-august-2025.html\">averaging below 30,000</a> during the summer months while <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2025/09/09/jobs-report-revisions-september-2025-.html\">benchmark revisions</a> showed nearly a million fewer jobs created in the 12 months prior to March 2025.</p><p>At the same time, inflation has cooled substantially since hitting a more than 40-year peak in 2022 but is still considerably above the Fed's 2% goal. Commerce Department data to be released Friday is expected to indicate that personal consumption prices rose 2.7% on an annual all-items basis and 2.9% when excluding food and energy, Powell said.</p><p>Adding to uncertainty is the impact of President <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/donald-trump/\">Donald Trump</a>'s tariffs. The president continues to negotiate with major U.S. trading partners about the ultimate level for the duties, with a key deadline with China coming up in early November. Fed economists for now are viewing the tariffs as mostly a temporary rise in prices, though that could change.</p><p>\"Uncertainty around the path of inflation remains high,\" Powell said. \"We will carefully assess and manage the risk of higher and more persistent inflation. We will make sure that this one-time increase in prices does not become an ongoing inflation problem.\"</p><p>Powell is presiding over a Fed that has come under intense criticism from the White House and is seeing an unusually wide dispersion in views among officials. The FOMC meeting concluded with participants narrowly split, 10-9, over whether one or two more quarter-point cuts would be appropriate this year. Trump appointee Stephen Miran has pushed for a much more aggressive course, but his term as governor ends in January.</p><p>Earlier Tuesday, Governor Michelle Bowman warned about the dangers of moving too slowly to address the labor market. Bowman, also a Trump appointee, said \"we are at serious risk of already being behind the curve in addressing deteriorating labor market conditions.\"</p><p>\"I am concerned that the labor market could enter into a precarious phase and there is a risk that a shock could tip it into a sudden and significant deterioration,\" she said.</p><p>While Powell has not provided his expectations for future rate moves, Bowman said she hopes the recent action is \"the first step\" in an ongoing move back to a neutral interest rate level.</p></div><div><h2>Don’t miss these insights from CNBC PRO</h2><div><ul><li><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2025/09/16/market-track-record-is-stellar-when-fed-cuts-rates-with-sp-500-at-record.html\">Market track record is flawless when the Fed cuts rates with S&P 500 near record high</a></li><li><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2025/09/16/fed-rate-cuts-will-make-dividend-stocks-more-appealing-for-income-investors-here-are-a-few-standouts.html\">Fed rate cuts will make dividend stocks more appealing for income investors.

Previously, those types of offenses carried lifetime bans.</p><p>\"Today, YouTube's Community Guidelines allow for a wider range of content regarding Covid and elections integrity,\" Donovan wrote.</p><p>YouTube <a href=\"https://x.com/UpdatesFromYT/status/1970549152699543938\" target=\"_blank\">wrote</a> on X that it will be a limited pilot project open to a subset of creators as well as channels that were terminated under policies the company has since retired.

Amazon has denied any wrongdoing.</p><p>The trial is being held in a federal court in Seattle, Amazon's backyard. Jury selection began Monday and opening arguments are slated for Tuesday, with the trial expected to last about a month.</p><p>Launched in 2005, Amazon's Prime program has grown to become one of the most popular subscription services in the world, with more than 200 million members globally, and it has generated billions of dollars for the company. Membership costs $139 a year and includes perks like free shipping and access to streaming content. <a href=\"https://www.numerator.com/resources/blog/retailer-membership-walmart-plus-amazon-prime/\" target=\"_blank\">Data has shown</a> that Prime members spend more and shop more often than non-Prime members.</p><p>Amazon founder and Executive Chairman <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/jeff-bezos/\">Jeff Bezo</a>s famously <a href=\"https://s2.q4cdn.com/299287126/files/doc_financials/annual/2015-Letter-to-Shareholders.PDF\" target=\"_blank\">said</a> the company wanted Prime \"to be such a good value, you'd be irresponsible not to be a member.\"</p><p>Regulators argue Amazon broke competition and consumer protection laws by tricking customers into subscribing to Prime. They pointed to examples like a button on its site that instructed users to complete their transaction and did not clearly state they were also agreeing to join Prime for a recurring subscription.</p><p>\"Millions of consumers accidentally enrolled in Prime without knowledge or consent, but Amazon refused to fix this known problem, described internally by employees as an 'unspoken cancer' because clarity adjustments would lead to a drop in subscribers,\" the agency wrote in a court filing last week.</p><p>The FTC says the cancellation process is equally confusing, requiring users to navigate four webpages and choose from 15 options — a \"labyrinthian mechanism\" that the company referred to internally as \"Iliad,\" referencing Homer's epic poem about the Trojan War.</p><p>Amazon has argued that the Prime sign-up and cancellation processes are \"clear and simple,\" adding that the company has \"always been transparent about Prime's terms.\"</p><p>\"Occasional customer frustrations and mistakes are inevitable — especially for a program as popular as Amazon Prime,\" the company wrote in a recent court filing. \"Evidence that a small percentage of customers misunderstood Prime enrollment or cancellation does not prove that Amazon violated the law.\"</p></div><h2><a></a>A crackdown on 'dark patterns'</h2><div><p>The FTC notched <a href=\"https://www.courtlistener.com/docket/67515622/federal-trade-commission-v-amazoncom-inc/?order_by=desc#entry-490\" target=\"_blank\">an early win</a> in the case last week when U.S. District Court Judge John Chun ruled Amazon and two senior executives violated the Restore Online Shoppers' Confidence Act by gathering Prime members' billing information before disclosing the terms of the service.</p><p>Chun also said that the two senior Amazon executives would be individually liable if a jury sides with the FTC due to the level of oversight they maintained over the Prime enrollment and cancellation process.</p><p>Amazon's Prime boss, Jamil Ghani, and Neil Lindsay, a senior vice president in its health division who previously oversaw Prime's technology and business operations, are <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2023/09/20/ftc-charges-three-amazon-executives-in-amended-complaint-over-prime.html\">named defendants</a> in the complaint.</p><p>Russell Grandinetti, Amazon senior vice president of international consumer, is also named in the suit, but Chun argued he had \"less involvement in the operation of the Prime organization\" compared with Ghani and Lindsay.</p><p>Chun also scolded attorneys for Amazon in July for withholding thousands of documents from the FTC and abusing a legal privilege to shield them from scrutiny. Among the documents was a 2020 email where Amazon's retail chief, Doug Herrington, said \"subscription driving\" was a \"shady\" practice and referred to Bezos as the company's \"chief dark arts officer.\"</p><p>Amazon spokesperson Maxine Tagay told CNBC in a statement, \"The bottom line is that neither Amazon nor the individual defendants did anything wrong — we remain confident that the facts will show these executives acted properly and we always put customers first.\"</p><p>The company also faces <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2023/09/26/ftc-and-17-states-sue-amazon-on-antitrust-charges.html\">a separate lawsuit</a> brought by the FTC in 2023 accusing it of wielding an illegal monopoly.

Organizations like Meta have shelled out <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2025/06/12/scale-ai-founder-wang-announces-exit-for-meta-part-of-14-billion-deal.html\">billions of dollars</a> to recruit top AI talent in an effort to try and gain an edge.  </p><p>The Trump administration's changes to the H-1B program could complicate similar recruiting efforts. </p><p>\"What this does is that it gives our competitors, other countries, places like Asia, Canada, Europe, they can then attract these employees to create new innovations,\" said Steven Hubbard, a data scientist at the American Immigration Council, which is a nonprofit for immigration advocacy and research. </p><p>One big competitor in the war for talent is China. The world's second-largest economy has long fought against the U.S. for tech dominance, and more recently the AI race.</p><p>Earlier this year, Chinese AI firm <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2025/01/24/how-chinas-new-ai-model-deepseek-is-threatening-us-dominance.html\">DeepSeek</a> rattled global markets after claiming to create a large language chatbot that outperformed competitors at a fraction of the cost. The news raised questions over the significant sums that American tech companies are shelling out on AI.</p><p>Some experts worry that visa changes could deal a victory into China's hands, sending top talent overseas. The move may also deter foreign students from attending university in the U.S. as uncertainty hangs over their post-graduation job prospects.</p><p>\"Those students are going to look at this environment and stay home,\" said Greg Morrisett, vice provost at Cornell Tech. \"It's giving a leg up to both China and India in terms of feeding their startup ecosystems.\"</p><p>For Bradley Tusk, the CEO of Tusk Venture Partners, the changes to the H-1B program are simply \"terrible.\" American companies have to have access to top talent in order to compete at the highest levels, he said.  </p><p>\"America's competitive advantage has always been the ability to attract the best talent from around the world,\" Tusk said. \"To limit our ability to recruit and compete is illogical.\"</p><p><strong>WATCH:</strong> <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/video/2025/09/23/jpmorgan-ceo-jamie-dimon-speaks-out-on-h-1b-visa-changes.html\">JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon speaks out on H-1B visa changes</a></p></div><div><p><img src=\"https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/108202630-17586241471758624144-41778724428-1080pnbcnews.jpg?v=1758624146&w=750&h=422&vtcrop=y\" alt=\"JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon speaks out on H-1B visa changes\" /><span></span><span><div><p><span>watch now</span><span></span></p></div></span></p></div></div>"
