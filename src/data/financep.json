    "body": "<div><div><p>Champpixs | Istock | Getty Images</p></div><div><p>Brian Lovern started his career pointing at storm systems on a green screen as a local TV weatherman in western Kentucky. More than two decades later, he was staring at natural-gas price charts, turning forecasts into profits, producing annual returns upwards of 100%.</p><p>Lovern, 49, had made the unusual jump from broadcast meteorology to Wall Street, working on weather desks at hedge funds and investment banks. But trading wasn't part of the job.</p><p>\"On the trade floors, in most cases, that's not going to happen,\" he said in an interview. \"They kind of frown upon weather guys who trade.\"</p><p>So in 2016, he started trading his own money. For four years, Lovern ran a strategy that combined his expertise in weather models with fundamentals like daily gas production and export flows. He scored his best year in 2018 with a 140% gain.</p><p>\"It's one thing to have the data and say, 'this is what it shows.' But interpreting it, and being able to make a good determination of how that data is going to change—that's really where the money is,\" he said.</p><p>His success didn't go unnoticed. Lovern was identified as one of the top traders by FundSeeder, a platform founded by \"Market Wizards\" author Jack Schwager and Emanuel Balarie that searches for under-the-radar trading talent worldwide and provides them with capital to scale.</p><h3>Finding 'Wizards'</h3><p>Schwager, a longtime trader in his own right and market historian best known for his \"Market Wizards\" book series, which profiled some of the most successful traders of the past half-century, including Paul Tudor Jones and Stanley Druckenmiller.</p><p>His books are required reading for many aspiring traders, making his endorsement a rare seal of legitimacy for investors outside Wall Street's traditional pipelines.</p><p>\"There are lots of great traders globally that are completely unknown,\" Schwager said in an interview. \"They don't know anybody in the finance industry. They have no connections. They may be in an undeveloped or partially developed country, but they've been trading very successfully.\"</p><p>Among the thousands of accounts FundSeeder has reviewed, Lovern stood out as one of the top performers. Earlier this year, the firm backed him with $3 million to scale his strategy. FundSeeder has also seeded a 35-year-old energy derivatives trader in the U.K., Adam Williams, with $10 million in March, and even funded a dentist in Europe who trades markets on the side.</p><h3>Global casting call</h3><p>FundSeeder is now expanding with the launch of the <a href=\"https://www.fundseeder.com/rise\" target=\"_blank\">FundSeeder Accelerator</a>, which aims to do for traders what Y Combinator did for Silicon Valley entrepreneurs: provide infrastructure, mentorship, and, crucially, capital to scale.</p><p>\"It's a global casting call for the next top fund manager,\" Balarie, senior vice president of business development at RQSI, which bought FundSeeder last year. \"We don't believe that Wall Street as a monopoly on the best traders. The problem is not the lack of trading talent, but it's really the barriers to entry that prohibits these traders.\"</p><p>The financial backing could be critical for emerging managers who are trying to raise funds.</p><p>\"There's kind of a chicken and egg problem in hedge funds — you need money to raise money,\" Williams said. \"If we were to approach investors, let's say we just started with $4 million, it will be significantly more difficult for people to write larger checks because they don't want to be a certain percentage of the fund.\"</p><p>Traders selected for FundSeeder Accelerator will present their strategies at an industry conference in Miami early 2026.</p></div></div>"

The company <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2023/09/16/how-olipops-founders-turned-100k-investment-into-healthier-soda-brand.html\">made $852,000</a> in gross revenue in its first year of business. Fast-forward to February 2025, Olipop was valued at $1.85 billion after <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2025/02/12/olipop-prebiotic-soda-valued-at-1point85-billion-in-funding-round.html\">raising $50 million</a> in a Series C funding round.</p><p>Though Goodwin also serves as the company's lead formulator, making him hands-on in creating new Olipop flavors, he says empathy, having a clear vision for the brand and connecting with others are the traits and skills he's needed most to help drive the business forward as CEO. </p><p>'When I think of the arc of all the stuff where I actually can provide long-term value … It's just keeping us really locked on target for the vision of the mission, making sure standards are being set correctly, and just providing that connection and leadership glue,\" says Goodwin. \"Almost all of this is interpersonal.\"</p><p>That's why, though <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2025/09/04/employers-are-paying-a-premium-for-ai-skills-most-non-tech-jobs.html\">AI-relevant technical skills are in high demand</a> and many employers and business leaders view them as a nonnegotiable as more work becomes automated, those skills are simply not as important for Goodwin, he says.</p><p>\"I actually have been avoiding AI,\" he says. \"I don't need anything else to chip away at my critical thinking skills. I've not been investing in [my own] AI skills.\"</p></div><h2><a></a>\"Soft skills' aren't so soft</h2><div><p>Goodwin isn't the only CEO touting the importance of soft skills — and the reason actually has everything to do with AI. As workplaces become more automated, employers are <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2025/08/13/amazon-aws-ceo-the-most-important-skill-you-need-to-succeed-in-ai-age.html\">placing a lot of value on those interpersonal skills</a> that humans can still master far better than any AI programs, according to Amazon Web Services CEO Matt Garman.

Under the terms, which China must still approve, a new joint-venture company will oversee TikTok's U.S. business, with ByteDance retaining less than a 20% stake.</p><p>Enterprise tech giant <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/ORCL/\">Oracle</a>, Silver Lake and the Abu Dhabi-based MGX investment fund will be main investors in TikTok's U.S. business, controlling a roughly 45% stake in the entity, while ByteDance investors and new holders will own 35%, CNBC's David Faber <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2025/09/25/oracle-silver-lake-mgx-tiktok.html\">reported</a> earlier Thursday. </p><p>No representatives from ByteDance were present at the signing, and the company hasn't acknowledged that a transaction is taking place. No purchase price was mentioned, and there's no indication that the Chinese government has made changes to laws that would be necessary for a deal to take place.</p><p>President Trump said Chinese President Xi Jinping gave the deal the go ahead. Vance said the Chinese government put up some resistance before the agreement.</p><p>Under the planned arrangement, <span><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/ORCL/\">Oracle</a><span><span></span></span></span> will oversee the app's security operations and continue providing cloud computing services for the new TikTok U.S. firm, Faber reported, citing sources familiar with the deal. Trump said Oracle CEO <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/larry-ellison/\">Larry Ellison</a> is involved in the ownership group and that his company is \"playing a very big part.\"</p><p>\"It's owned by Americans, and very sophisticated Americans,\" Trump said at the signing. \"This is going to be American operated all the way.\"</p><p>ByteDance investors like General Atlantic, Susquehanna and Sequoia, are expected to contribute equity in the new TikTok U.S. entity, sources told Faber.

The Fed last week lowered its benchmark overnight lending rate by a quarter percentage point, with Cook participating in that decision.</p><p>\"This Court should deny the President's extraordinary application because his arguments defy established precedent and longstanding practice,\" Cook's lawyers said in their filing.</p><p>\"This litigation has barely begun, and further factfinding could avoid the need for this Court to decide the high-stakes legal issues raised in the President's application,\" her lawyers wrote. \"On the merits, this Court is likely to reject each of the President's legal theories.\"</p><p>\"Specifically, the Court is likely to hold that because Governor Cook is removable only for cause, she is entitled to notice, opportunity for a hearing, and judicial review before she is removed.\"</p><p>The lawyers wrote that the Supreme Court is \"likely\" to ultimately ruled that the \"for cause\" standard provided by the Federal Reserve Act is meaningful protection for a Fed governor, \"and is not satisfied by manufactured charges based on conduct that pre-dates her service on the Board.\"</p><p>\"The bottom line is this: Contrary to the President's boundless assertion of authority, there must be some meaningful check on the President's ability to remove Governor Cook,\" the lawyers wrote. \"Otherwise, any president could remove any governor based on any charge of wrongdoing, however flawed.

In the first eight months of this year, Tesla EV registrations in Europe declined 32.6%, the ACEA said.</p><p>Meanwhile, total EV registrations throughout the region rose by around 26% through August compared to the same period in 2024. By contrast, registrations for petrol and diesel-powered vehicles declined by more than 20% over that stretch.</p><p>Still, RBC analysts wrote in a note on Thursday that they expect Tesla's total deliveries for the third quarter could amount to 456,000, above a FactSet-compiled consensus of 448,000 deliveries and a Visible Alpha consensus of 440,000 deliveries.</p><p>The analysts expect a bump for Tesla as <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2025/08/08/ev-sales-trump-tax-credit.html\">consumers rush</a> to buy EVs in the U.S. before a $7,500 federal tax credit expires at the end of September.</p><p>Even with Thursday's slide, Tesla's stock has bounced back following a brutal start to the year.

The rally was led by activist Tommy Robinson, a convicted fraudster with a violent criminal record.</p><p>British Prime Minister Keir Starmer rebuked Musk for \"dangerous\" comments that he made at the rally, where 26 police officers were injured. Musk told attendees, \"violence is coming to you\" and \"you either fight back or you die.\"</p><p>To revitalize interest in the brand, Tesla has said an affordable new model is in the works, which could help it fend off increased competition from the likes of Volkswagen, BYD and other EV makers that have been picking up market share. </p><p><strong>WATCH:</strong> <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/video/2025/09/16/cfra-downgrades-tesla-to-sell-the-analyst-garrett-nelson-behind-the-call-breaks-it-down.html\">CFRA downgrades Tesla</a></p></div><div><p><img src=\"https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/108199391-17580375141758037511-41675403985-1080pnbcnews.jpg?v=1758037513&w=750&h=422&vtcrop=y\" alt=\"CFRA downgrades Tesla to sell.

The 139 companies that responded operate predominantly in Texas as well as northern Louisiana and southern New Mexico.</p><p>Trump has championed fossil fuels while attacking the renewable energy industry since taking office in January. His <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2025/07/03/trump-one-big-beautiful-bill-oil-gas-coal-solar-wind-ira-tax-incentive-repeal.html\">One Big Beautiful Bill Act</a>, passed by Congress in July, delivered virtually everything the oil lobby wanted.</p><p>But Trump's push for lower crude prices, higher tariffs, and the resulting uncertainty caused by his \"stroke of pen\" policies are hurting investment, executives at independent oil and gas producers told the Dallas Fed.</p><p>Nearly 80% of executives who participated in the survey said they have delayed investment decisions in response to heightened uncertainty about the future price of oil and the cost of producing crude.</p><p>\"We have begun the twilight of shale,\" one executive said, pointing to layoffs by the thousands and industry consolidation under big companies like <span><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/XOM/\">Exxon Mobil</a><span><span></span></span></span>. \"The writing is on the wall,\" the unnamed manager said.</p><h3>'Drilling is going to disappear'</h3><p>Another executive warned that \"drilling is going to disappear\" as Trump pushes for $40 per barrel crude oil at the same time his steel tariffs are raising costs. U.S. crude oil prices are currently trading around $65 per barrel, just above the level producers need to drill profitably.</p><p>The shale industry has been \"gutted\" over the course of the Biden and Trump administrations, another executive said. Political hostility from Biden chased away capital from the industry, the person said. Economic ignorance from Trump is \"finishing the job,\" they said.</p><p>\"The U.S. shale business is broken,\" the executive said.</p><p>The Trump administration has effectively aligned itself with the decision by OPEC+ to increase oil supply, \"kneecapping U.S. producers in the process,\" the person said.</p><p>\"Guided by a U.S. Department of Energy that tells them what they want to hear instead of hard facts, they operate with little understanding of shale economics,\" the same executive said.</p><h3>Regulatory costs</h3><p>A White House spokesperson said Trump is \"rolling back burdensome regulations that were killing the industry,\" crediting the president's policies with record production in June. Energy Secretary Chris Wright has repeatedly argued that the administration is making drilling cheaper by cuting red tape. </p><p>But 57% of executives surveyed by the Dallas Fed said regulatory changes since January have reduced their breakeven costs by less than $1 per barrel.</p><p>Another executive warned that Trump's attacks on the renewable energy industry will come back to haunt the oil and gas sector in a few years. Investors are avoiding energy due to volatility and the \"stroke of pen\" risk that the White House wields over energy projects, the person said.</p><p>\"Life is long, and the sword being wielded against the renewables industry right now will likely boomerang back in 3.5 years against traditional energy,\" they said, warning the industry will face harsher methane penalties, permitting restrictions and environmental reviews when Democrats return to power.</p></div></div>"
