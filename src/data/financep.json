That's up from 72,730 in July and 65,448 borrowers as of the end of June.

During those payment pauses, borrowers typically don't get credit toward PSLF.</p><p>The Buyback program became especially popular after courts blocked the Biden-era Saving on a Valuable Education, or SAVE, plan in <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2024/07/19/education-department-to-pause-save-student-loan-payments-amid-legal-battle.html\">the summer of 2024</a>. Millions of student loan borrowers who signed up for SAVE were automatically enrolled in a forbearance during that legal battle. Those borrowers found their progress towards PSLF frozen throughout the payment pause, even as they continued to work in eligible public service.</p><p>Now applications have piled up under the Trump administration. In March, Trump officials <a href=\"https://www.ed.gov/about/news/press-release/us-department-of-education-initiates-reduction-force\" target=\"_blank\">terminated</a> nearly half of the staff at the Education Department, including many of the people who assisted borrowers.</p></div><h2><a></a>Student loan borrowers should still apply</h2><div><p>Despite the PSLF buyback delays, \"if you are eligible, there's no harm in submitting the application,\" said Nancy Nierman, assistant director of the Education Debt Consumer Assistance Program in New York.</p><p>\"But if you can afford payments in other repayment plans, don't rely solely on the Buyback to get you to 120 qualifying payments, particularly if you only need a few months of credit to reach forgiveness,\" she said.</p></div><div><p>You can apply for Buyback and also submit paperwork to switch into another repayment plan at the same time. But there's a backlog of repayment plan applications, too. More than one million requests for a new plan are pending with the department, court records also show.</p><p>While you can remain in the SAVE forbearance for now, borrowers' debts began accruing interest again in <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2025/08/01/student-loan-interest-free-save-forbearance-ends.html\">August</a>.</p><p>If you continue making payments on your loans after you've applied for a buyback offer, or if the Education Department finds you've made more than the required 120 qualifying payments for PSLF, you're entitled to a refund from the government, said higher education expert Mark Kantrowitz. He has heard from people who've gotten one in this scenario.</p></div><h2><a></a>How to apply for PSLF Buyback</h2><div><p>You can apply for the Buyback program through the <a href=\"https://urldefense.com/v3/__https:/studentaid.gov/fsa-id/sign-in/landing?redirectTo=*2Fpslf*2Freconsideration*2Fborrower-information__;JSUl!!PIZeeW5wscynRQ!sAp5wOCu0sF64yGKXMfYR3h3eLzgg75x8b2uEfKDQXpVHJRfNk0YqT6ZfnLCprUpZlB941UdJJ_8RglWcWw$\" target=\"_blank\">PSLF Reconsideration portal</a> on your Federal Student Aid account, Nierman said</p><p>Consumer advocates recommend keeping track of when you submitted your buyback request (you should receive a confirmation email) and the number of your qualifying PSLF payments. That figure should be accessible on your student loan account.</p></div><h2><a></a>How your buyback offer is calculated</h2><div><p>After you've submitted your buyback request, the Education Dept. is supposed to send you an offer letter. That should include the number of monthly payments you missed during your public service history, and a chance to pay that bill now in exchange for student loan forgiveness.</p><p>How the government calculates your missed monthly payments is complicated, said Kantrowitz. But it's usually based on what your bills were before and after the period during which you weren't making qualifying payments, Kantrowitz said.</p><p>Some people who have low incomes are eligible for zero-dollar payments, and they might not have to pay anything to get their debt cleared.</p><p>Once you get the offer letter, Kantrowitz said, \"You must pay the amount to your loan servicer within 90 days.\"</p></div></div>"

He would not reveal where his passport was, and did not surrender it when arrested. </p><p>Rubin's lawyer argued he was not a flight risk because two of his adult children and his grandchildren live near him.</p><p>The lawyer also cited Rubin's health condition, saying he had a stroke in July.</p><p>Kuo rejected that argument, but Rubin's defense team could make a new bail application. He is next scheduled to be in court on Oct. 20.</p><p>Powers was arrested at her home in Soutlake, Texas, and is scheduled to appear in U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Texas next week. She is also charged with bank fraud in connection with alleged misrepresentations she made to a bank while financing the mortgage for her and her husband's home in Southlake, Texas, authorities said.</p><p>Prosecutors want a \"substantial bail package\" for Powers.</p><p>If convicted of sex trafficking, Rubin and Powers each face a maximum possible sentence of life in prison and a mandatory minimum sentence of 15 years in prison.</p></div><div><p>Rubin was sued in November 2017 by two self-identified Playboy models and another model from Florida, who claimed they were beaten, sexually abused and raped by Rubin in multiple incidents in New York City in 2016.</p><p>In April 2022, a civil jury in Brooklyn federal court found Rubin liable for sex trafficking six women who had sued him and Powers, and ordered him to pay them a total of $3.85 million in compensatory and punitive damages. Powers was not found liable by that jury.</p><p>Rubin is currently appealing the civil judgment.</p><p>A spokesman for the U.S. Attorney's Office in Brooklyn had no comment when asked why there was a lag of nearly eight years between the filing of the civil lawsuit against Rubin and the office obtaining a criminal indictment against him. At the time the lawsuit was filed, a lawyer for women who sued Rubin told CNBC that the U.S. Attorney's Office had reached out to him about potentially investigating the financier.</p><p>The detention letter by prosecutors says that after Rubin was sued, he told a woman whom he had seen for commercial sex from 20014 through to 2019, \"that pursuant to his arrangements, a hitman was contacted on the dark web to target women who had filed a civil suit against him, but he did not ultimately retain the hitman.\"</p><p>Rubin, after working as a bond trader at Salomon Brothers, also did stints at Bear, Stearns and Merrill Lynch.</p><p>He first gained public notoriety in 1987 for <a href=\"https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-1987-04-30-mn-2844-story.html\" target=\"_blank\">making unauthorized trades at Merrill Lynch</a>, which the firm at the time said contributed to a massive $250 million loss from mortgage securities.

But as the clock runs out, party leaders are only growing more entrenched in their opposition.</p><p>Republicans, who hold narrow majorities in the House and Senate, want to pass a \"clean\" resolution to temporarily extend funding. Democrats want the stopgap to include health-care protections, including extensions of enhanced premium tax credits under the Affordable Care Act that are set to expire at the end of the year. The enhanced credits cap out-of-pocket health-care premiums for a wider swath of Obamacare enrollees.</p><p>A funding bill needs 60 votes to be adopted in the Senate, which means it cannot pass on a party-line vote.</p><p>President <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/donald-trump/\">Donald Trump</a> ratcheted up the political brinksmanship this week by canceling a scheduled meeting with the top House and Senate Democrats. And his Office of Management and Budget appeared to raise the stakes further on Wednesday, when it sent a memo warning federal agencies to prepare for <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2025/09/25/trump-government-shutdown-layoffs-omb.html\">mass firings</a> in the event of a shutdown.</p><p>Each side is betting that Americans will blame the other for a shutdown. But regardless of the political dividends, a shutdown will have a major impact on a wide array of services and programs — and it could lead to unprecedented actions by the Trump administration, which has made shrinking the government a top priority.</p><p>Here's what to know:</p></div><h2><a></a>What is a government shutdown?</h2><div><p>Congress has to pass a series of 12 appropriations bills by September 30 to finance government entities for the next fiscal year.</p><p>If it does not, or if it cannot pass a short-term funding measure known as a \"continuing resolution,\" the government shuts down. There have been <a href=\"https://bipartisanpolicy.org/explainer/what-happens-if-the-government-shuts-down/\" target=\"_blank\">14 shutdowns</a> since 1980, according to the Bipartisan Policy Center.</p><p>If Congress can only pass some, but not all, of the annual appropriations bills in time, the government will experience a partial shutdown. That happened in late 2018 during Trump's first presidential term, when the government partially shut down for a record <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2019/01/25/senate-votes-to-reopen-government-and-end-shutdown-without-border-wall.html\">five weeks</a> amid disputes about funding Trump's U.S.-Mexico border wall.</p><p>The current Congress has not passed any of the 12 bills ahead of next week's deadline.</p></div><h2><a></a>How will federal employees be affected?</h2><div><p>Non-essential government employees may be furloughed during a shutdown, meaning they are forced to take an unpaid leave of absence.</p><p>During the last full government shutdown in 2013, about 850,000 employees were furloughed, according to the <a href=\"https://www.crfb.org/papers/government-shutdowns-qa-everything-you-should-know\" target=\"_blank\">Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget.</a></p><p>There are more than two million civilian federal workers in the U.S.</p><p>While furloughed employees are guaranteed back pay once they return to work, federal contractors have historically not received back pay, according to CRFB.</p></div><h2><a></a>What services and agencies will be affected?</h2><div><p>A shutdown will directly affect the non-essential government programs and services that rely on the spending that must be appropriated every year, which is known as discretionary spending.</p><p>In past shutdowns, that has led to the closures of hundreds of national parks and museums, the curtailment of veterans' services, the suspension of health inspections, the postponement of immigration hearings and a slew of other impacts.</p><p>Discretionary spending accounts for 27% of the fiscal 2024 budget, according to the <a href=\"https://www.pgpf.org/article/chart-pack-the-us-budget/\" target=\"_blank\">Peter G. Peterson Foundation</a>.</p><p>Services and programs deemed essential would continue to operate, though they may be affected indirectly. And some federal employees are classified as \"excepted,\" meaning they are still required to work during a shutdown.</p><p>Examples of essential services include those that are related to national security, law enforcement, air traffic control and inmate control.</p><p>Programs funded through \"mandatory\" spending — which is authorized either permanently or for multiple years — broadly continue, though they can still feel the effects of a shutdown.</p><p>For example, in a 1996 shutdown, Social Security checks were still sent out, but staff who handled new enrollments to the program and other services were <a href=\"https://www.crfb.org/papers/government-shutdowns-qa-everything-you-should-know#mandatoryprograms\" target=\"_blank\">initially furloughed</a>.</p></div><h2><a></a>What about economic reports?</h2><div><p>A shutdown could delay the release of key economic reports that are regularly published by the government.</p><p>If no deal is reached, the government will shut down just days before the Bureau of Labor Statistics is set to issue its monthly jobs report for September.</p><p>Wells Fargo economist Michael Pugliese <a href=\"https://wellsfargo.bluematrix.com/docs/html/70538749-ecdc-4d9c-90fb-7acc607da311.html\" target=\"_blank\">noted this week</a> that after the last full government shutdown in 2013, the monthly jobs and consumer price index reports \"were delayed by about two weeks.\"</p><p>\"Collection, processing and publication delays stretched into the following month as well,\" the economist noted.</p><p>The next BLS employment report is set to come out Oct. 3, while the CPI reading for September is due Oct. 15.</p><p>In the partial shutdown that began in late 2018, \"The first look at GDP growth for Q4-2018 was delayed about a month, as was December 2018 data on retail sales and personal income & spending,\" Pugliese wrote.</p><p>— <em>CNBC's </em><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/emily-wilkins/\"><em>Emily Wilkins</em></a><em> contributed to this report.</em></p></div></div>"

Nvidia's investments rose to 41 in 2024, and so far in 2025, the chipmaker has made 51 such deals, not counting its commitment to OpenAI.</p></div><div><p>To be sure, Nvidia is usually just one of several investors for most of its venture capital transactions. Nvidia declined to provide CNBC dollar figures, but its sheer number of venture and public equity investments shows how central the company has become to the AI ecosystem.</p><p>Nvidia has increasing cash flow from its rising sales and the regulatory environment around acquisitions is still difficult, said Neuberger Berman analyst Jamie Zakalik. The OpenAI deal is a \"win-win\" because it allows Nvidia to spend some of that cash and gain influence on the implementation of artificial intelligence using its chips, she said.</p><p>\"Nvidia has a lot of capital that they don't necessarily have a ton of avenues to do stuff with,\" Zakalik said.</p><p>Regulators typically don't worry about \"vertical\" investments or acquisitions in which a company like Nvidia takes a stake in a supplier or customer, said Alden Abbott, a research fellow at the Mercatus Center at George Mason University. But regulators would scrutinize investments with exclusive supply contracts, which are unlikely in this case because of how fast AI is moving, he said.</p><p>These investments could also be a clue as to what companies Nvidia may be interested in buying. Earlier this year, the chipmaker <a href=\"https://thelogic.co/news/exclusive/nvidias-deal-centml-us400m/\" target=\"_blank\">acquired</a> CentML after participating in its 2023 seed round. Nvidia also invested in Enfabrica, an infrastructure networking firm, before spending $900 million to hire its CEO and license its technology, CNBC <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2025/09/18/nvidia-spent-over-900-million-on-enfabrica-ceo-ai-startup-technology.html\">reported</a> last week.</p></div><h2><a></a>What Nvidia owns</h2><p>Nvidia's investments span a variety of technologies, ranging from chips, biotech, robotics and self-driving cars. They include some of the leading AI model companies, which use vast quantities of Nvidia's chips to process huge amounts of data and create AI models.</p><div><p>The chipmaker has invested an unspecified amount in OpenAI in multiple rounds, that latest of which valued it at $500 billion. It contributed to a 1.7 billion euro round ($2 billion) into French startup Mistral AI in September, participated in a round that raised $500 million for Cohere <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/09/24/cohere-hits-7b-valuation-a-month-after-its-last-raise-partners-with-amd/\" target=\"_blank\">in August</a> and was part of a round that raised $307 million for Runway over multiple rounds.</p><p>Nvidia's also <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/792e09b2-f63b-41ac-8be8-e10e75ead2d1\" target=\"_blank\">reportedly</a> participated in a April $2 billion round for Safe Superintelligence, the lab started by former OpenAI luminary Ilya Sutskever. Nvidia also <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2025/07/15/openai-mira-murati-thinking-machines-lab.html\">participated</a> in a $2 billion July funding round for Thinking Machine Labs, the company started by former OpenAI operating chief Mira Murati.</p><p>Some of Nvidia's investments have already seen exits. It was an investor in Scale AI, a company that cleaned and created data for AI startups. That startup entered into a $14.3 billion hiring and licensing <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2025/06/12/scale-ai-founder-wang-announces-exit-for-meta-part-of-14-billion-deal.html\">deal</a> with Meta that saw its CEO and other employees join the social media company.</p><p>Nvidia also has 7% stake in <span><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/CRWV/\">CoreWeave</a><span><span></span></span></span>, a cloud provider that sells access to Nvidia's chips. CoreWeave had a successful <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2025/03/28/coreweave-starts-trading-on-nasdaq-at-per-share.html\">initial public offering</a> earlier this year.</p><p>CoreWeave is one of the neo-cloud providers that are competing and partnering with the large cloud companies such as <span><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/MSFT/\">Microsoft</a><span><span></span></span></span>, <span><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/GOOGL/\">Google</a><span><span></span></span></span> and <span><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/AMZN/\">Amazon</a><span><span></span></span></span>. CoreWeave disclosed a $6.3 billion <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2025/09/15/coreweave-stock-jumps-on-disclosure-of-6point3-billion-order-from-nvidia.html\">order</a> from Nvidia earlier this month.</p><p>Nvidia also participated in fellow neo-cloud provider Lambda Labs' $480 million Series D round<a href=\"https://lambda.ai/blog/lambda-raises-480m-to-expand-ai-cloud-platform\" target=\"_blank\"> in February</a>.</p><p>Some of Nvidia's most interesting investments are in companies that are developing quantum computers, a still-theoretical technology that some believe could one day supercharge AI development. Quantum companies can use Nvidia's chips to simulate their computers that don't exist yet.</p><p>Nvidia's stakes in those companies came after CEO Jensen Huang apologized to the industry at an Nvidia conference after one of his stray quips about a pessimistic timeline for the technology <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2025/03/20/nvidia-ceo-huang-says-was-wrong-about-timeline-for-quantum-computing.html\">sunk their stocks</a>.</p><p>Earlier this month, Nvidia's venture capital arm was a participant in a <a href=\"https://www.psiquantum.com/news-import/psiquantum-1b-fundraise\" target=\"_blank\">$1 billion round for PsiQuantum</a>, and the chipmaker pitched into early stage funding for Quantinuum <a href=\"https://www.quantinuum.com/press-releases/honeywell-announces-600-million-capital-raise-for-quantinuum-at-10b-pre-money-equity-valuation-to-advance-quantum-computing-at-scale\" target=\"_blank\">in September</a>.</p><p>Having Nvidia on a company's cap table can make it more attractive to investors. In recent years, after Nvidia has revealed stakes in public companies, investors have <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2024/02/15/nvidia-holdings-disclosure-pumps-up-shares-of-small-ai-companies.html\">bought</a> up the stocks, even with tangential connections to AI.

    "body": "<div><div><p>OpenAI CEO Sam Altman listens to questions at a Q&A following a tour of the OpenAI data center in Abilene, Texas, Sept. 23, 2025.</p><p>Shelby Tauber | Reuters</p></div><div><p>This week, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2025/09/23/openai-first-data-center-in-500-billion-stargate-project-up-in-texas.html\">OpenAI</a> redefined what momentum — and risk — look like in the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/ai-effect/\">artificial intelligence</a> arms race.</p><p>Now comes the hard part: Executing on CEO <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2025/09/23/sam-altman-openais-850-billion-in-planned-buildouts-bubble-concern.html\">Sam Altman</a>'s multitrillion-dollar vision.</p><p>In a rapid-fire series of announcements, the company unveiled partnerships involving mind-bending sums of money and cemented its place at the center of the next wave of machine learning infrastructure.</p><p>It began Monday with news that <span><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/NVDA/\">Nvidia</a><span><span></span></span></span> plans to invest up to $100 billion to help OpenAI build data center capacity with millions of graphics processing units, or GPUs. A day later, OpenAI revealed an expanded deal with <span><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/ORCL/\">Oracle</a><span><span></span></span></span> and <span><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/3AG1-FF/\">SoftBank</a><span><span></span></span></span>, scaling its \"Stargate\" project to a $400 billion commitment across multiple phases and sites. Then on Thursday, OpenAI deepened its enterprise reach with a formal integration into Databricks — signaling a new phase in its push for commercial adoption.</p><p>\"In all, this is the biggest tale yet of Silicon Valley's signature 'fake it 'til you make it,' and so far it seems to be working,\" said Gil Luria, managing director at D.A. Davidson.</p><p>The startup, known mostly for its ChatGPT chatbot and GPT family of large language models, is trying to become something much bigger: the next hyperscaler. Never mind that it's burning billions of dollars in cash and is fully reliant on outside capital to grow, nor that its buildout plans require the amount of energy that would be needed to power more than 13 million U.S. homes.</p><p>Altman has long said that delivering the next era of AI will require exponentially more infrastructure.</p><p>\"You should expect OpenAI to spend <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2025/08/18/altman-ai-bubble-openai.html\">trillions</a> of dollars on data center construction in the not very distant future,\" he told CNBC and a small group of reporters over dinner in San Francisco last month. \"And you should expect a bunch of economists wringing their hands, saying, 'This is so crazy, it's so reckless,' and we'll just be like, 'You know what? Let us do our thing.'\"</p><p>The story OpenAI is selling is that it's responding to market demand, which shows no signs of stopping. And eventually, the thinking goes, this will all be profitable.</p><p>Current financial projections show OpenAI is on track to generate $125 billion in revenue by 2029, according to a source familiar with the company's internal forecasts.</p></div><div><p><img src=\"https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/108203356-17587293681758729365-41797376673-1080pnbcnews.jpg?v=1758729847&w=750&h=422&vtcrop=y\" alt=\"Tech giants ramp up AI spending\" /><span></span><span><div><p><span>watch now</span><span></span></p></div></span></p></div><div><p>It's a bold bet — and one full of execution risk.</p><p>Building out 17 gigawatts of capacity would require the equivalent of about 17 nuclear power plants, each of which takes at least a decade to build. The OpenAI team says talks are underway with hundreds of infrastructure providers across North America, but there are no firm answers yet.</p><p>The U.S. grid is already strained, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2025/09/23/nvidia-openai-data-center-ai-power-renewable-gas-nuclear.html\">gas turbines</a> are sold out through 2028, nuclear is slow to deploy, and renewables are tied up in political roadblocks.</p><p>\"I am extremely bullish about nuclear, advanced fission, fusion,\" Altman said. \"We should build more ... a lot more of the current generation of fission plants, given the needs for dense, dense energy.\"</p><p>What did crystallize this week, however, was the scale of Altman's ambition, as the OpenAI CEO began to put hard numbers behind his vision — some of them staggering. </p><p>\"Unlike previous technological revolutions or previous versions of the internet, there's so much infrastructure that's required, and this is a small sample of it,\" Altman said Tuesday at OpenAI's first Stargate site in Abilene, Texas.</p><p>That mentality — blunt, ambitious, and dismissive of convention – has defined Altman's leadership in this new phase.</p><p>Deedy Das, partner at Menlo Ventures, said the scale of OpenAI's infrastructure partnerships with Oracle may seem extreme to some, but he views it differently.</p><p>\"I don't see this as crazy. I see it as existential for the race to superintelligence,\" he said.</p><p>Das argued that data and compute, or computing power, are the two biggest levers for scaling AI, and praised Altman for recognizing early on just how steep the ramp in infrastructure would need to be.</p><p>\"One of his gifts is reading the exponential and planning for it,\" he added.</p><p>History shows that breakthroughs in AI aren't driven by smarter algorithms, he added, but by access to massive computing power. That's why companies such as OpenAI, <span><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/GOOGL/\">Google</a><span><span></span></span></span> and Anthropic are all chasing scale.</p></div><div><p><img src=\"https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/108203634-1758765047780-1758764019653-Video_66_.jpg?v=1758765153&w=750&h=422&vtcrop=y\" alt=\"OpenAI’s $850 billion buildout contends with grid limits\" /><span></span><span><div><p><span>watch now</span><span></span></p></div></span></p></div><div><p><span><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/BABA/\">Alibaba</a><span><span></span></span></span>, OpenAI and Anthropic have all pointed to insatiable demand for their models from consumers and businesses alike. As these companies push to embed AI into everyday workflows, the infrastructure stakes keep rising.</p><p>Ubiquitous, always-on intelligence requires more than just code — it takes power, land, chips, and years of planning.</p><p>\"I think people who use ChatGPT every day have no idea that this is what it takes,\" Altman said, gesturing to the site in Abilene. \"This is 10% of what the site is going to be. We're doing 10 of these.\"</p><p>\"This requires such an insane amount of physical infrastructure to deliver,\" he said.</p></div><h2><a></a>The cost of staying ahead</h2><div><p>Though the buildout is flashy, the funding behind it remains hazy.</p><p>Nvidia's $100 billion investment will arrive in $10 billion tranches over the next several years. OpenAI's buildout commitment with Oracle and SoftBank could eventually reach $400 billion.</p><p><span><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/MSFT/\">Microsoft</a><span><span></span></span></span>, OpenAI's largest partner and shareholder that holds a right of first refusal for cloud deals, \"is not willing to write them an unlimited check for compute,\" Luria said. \"So they've turned to Oracle with a commitment considerably bigger than they can live up to.\" </p><p>As a non-investment-grade startup without positive cash flow, OpenAI still faces a major financing challenge.</p><p>Executives have called equity \"the most expensive\" way to fund infrastructure, and the company is preparing to take on debt to cover the rest of its buildout. Nvidia's long-term lease structure could help OpenAI secure better terms from banks, but it still needs to raise multiples of that capital in the private markets.</p><p>OpenAI CFO Sarah Friar said the company plans to build some of its own first-party infrastructure — not to replace partners like Oracle, but to become a savvier operator. Doing some of the work internally, she said, makes OpenAI \"a better partner\" by allowing it to challenge vendor assumptions and gain a clearer view into actual costs versus padded estimates.</p><p>That, in turn, strengthens its position in rate negotiations.</p><p>\"The other tool at their disposal to reduce burn rate is to start selling ads within ChatGPT, which may also help with the fundraising,\" Luria suggested.</p><p>Altman said earlier this year in an <a href=\"https://stratechery.com/2025/an-interview-with-openai-ceo-sam-altman-about-building-a-consumer-tech-company/\" target=\"_blank\">interview with Ben Thompson's Stratechery</a> that he'd rather test affiliate-style fees than traditional ads, floating a 2% cut when users buy something they discovered through the tool. He said rankings wouldn't be for sale and that while ads aren't ruled out, other monetization models come first.</p><p>That question of how to monetize becomes even more urgent amid OpenAI's breakneck growth.</p><p>\"We are growing faster than any business I've ever heard of before,\" Altman said, adding that demand is accelerating so quickly that even this buildout pace will \"look slow\" in hindsight. Usage of ChatGPT, he noted, has surged roughly tenfold over the past 18 months, particularly on the enterprise side.</p><p>And that demand isn't slowing.</p><p>Accenture CEO Julie Sweet told CNBC's Sara Eisen on \"Money Movers\" Thursday that she's seeing an inflection point in enterprise adoption. </p><p>\"Every CEO board in the C-suite recognizes that advanced AI is critical to the future,\" she said.<strong> </strong>\"The challenge right now they're facing is that they're really excited about the technology, and they're not yet AI-ready — for most companies.\"</p><p>She said her firm signed 37 clients this quarter with bookings over $100 million.</p><p>\"We're still in the thick of it,\" she added. \"There's a ton of work to do.\"</p></div><div><p><img src=\"https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/108204163-1758831582652-1758823665-41813609339-hd.jpg?v=1758831612&w=750&h=422&vtcrop=y\" alt=\"Databricks CEO on OpenAI partnership: Enterprises are excited to get AI agents working\" /><span></span><span><div><p><span>watch now</span><span></span></p></div></span></p></div><div><p>Ali Ghodsi, CEO of Databricks, said Thursday that concerns about overbuilding miss the bigger picture.</p><p>\"There's going to be much more AI usage in the future than we have today. There's no doubt about that,\" he said.<strong> </strong>\"Not every person on the planet is using at the fullest capacity these AI models. So more capacity will be needed.\" </p><p>That optimism is one reason Ghodsi struck a formal integration deal with OpenAI this week — a partnership that brings GPT-5 directly into Databricks' data tooling and reflects growing enterprise demand for OpenAI's models inside business software.</p><p>Still, Ghodsi said it's important to maintain flexibility.</p><p>Databricks now hosts all three major foundation models — OpenAI, Anthropic, and <span><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/GOOGL/\">Alphabet's</a><span><span></span></span></span> Gemini — so customers aren't locked into a single provider.</p><p>But even as infrastructure ramps up, the scale and speed of OpenAI's spending spree have raised questions about execution.</p><p>Nvidia is supplying capital and chips. Oracle is building the sites. OpenAI is anchoring the demand. It's a circular economy that could come under pressure if any one player falters.</p><p>And while the headlines came fast this week, the physical buildout will take years to deliver — with much of it dependent on energy and grid upgrades that remain uncertain. </p><p>Friar acknowledged that challenge.</p><p>\"There's not enough compute to do all the things that AI can do, and so we need to get it started,\" she said. \"And we need to do it as a full ecosystem.\"</p><p><strong>WATCH:</strong> <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/video/2025/09/23/oracle-openai-and-softbank-unveil-400-billion-stargate-data-center-expansions.html\">Oracle, OpenAI and SoftBank unveil $400 billion Stargate data center</a></p></div><div><p><img src=\"https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/108203070-1758666267674-1758661829-41785567798-hd.jpg?v=1758666303&w=750&h=422&vtcrop=y\" alt=\"Oracle, OpenAI and SoftBank unveil $400 billion Stargate data center expansions\" /><span></span><span><div><p><span>watch now</span><span></span></p></div></span></p></div></div>"

Disney had temporarily <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2025/09/17/charlie-kirk-jimmy-kimmel-abc-disney.html\">suspended</a> the late night show following comments Kimmel made about the alleged murder of conservative activist Charlie Kirk and President Donald Trump's MAGA movement.</p><p>\"Our objective throughout this process has been to ensure that programming remains accurate and engaging for the widest possible audience. We take seriously our responsibility as local broadcasters to provide programming that serves the interests of our communities, while also honoring our obligations to air national network programming,\" Sinclair said in a statement on Friday.</p><p>\"Over the last week, we have received thoughtful feedback from viewers, advertisers, and community leaders representing a wide range of perspectives,\" Sinclair said. \"We have also witnessed troubling acts of violence, including the despicable incident of a shooting at an ABC affiliate station in Sacramento. These events underscore why responsible broadcasting matters and why respectful dialogue between differing voices remains so important.\"</p><p>The broadcast station owners said earlier this week they would continue to <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2025/09/23/kimmel-abc-nexstar-sinclair-fcc.html\">preempt</a> Kimmel's late night show, meaning it would be unavailable on local stations for roughly 20% of the country, while they <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2025/09/24/jimmy-kimmel-live-nexstar-show-status-abc-stations.html\">evaluated</a> the situation and continued discussions with Disney.</p><p>Sinclair owns roughly 40 ABC affiliate stations in the U.S., including one in in Washington, D.C. Nexstar owns about 30 in markets including Salt Lake City and New Orleans.</p><p>Kimmel <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2025/09/23/jimmy-kimmel-returns-abc-disney-kirk.html\">addressed</a> the situation — and the ongoing preemptions — during his returning show this week.</p><p>\"We are still on the air in most of the country, except, ironically, from Washington, D.C., where we have been preempted,\" Kimmel said during Tuesday's monologue. \"After almost 23 years on the air, we're suddenly not being broadcast in 20% of the country, which is not a situation we relish.\"</p><p>Sinclair said Friday it had proposed measures to \"strengthen accountability, viewer feedback, and community dialogue\" at ABC and its affiliates.</p><p>\"While ABC and Disney have not yet adopted these measures, and Sinclair respects their right to make those decisions under our network affiliate agreements, we believe such measures could strengthen trust and accountability,\" it said.</p><p>Nexstar said in a statement: \"We have had discussions with executives at The Walt Disney Company and appreciate their constructive approach to addressing our concerns.\"</p><p>Disney declined to comment Friday.</p><p>Kimmel's suspension last week came shortly after Nexstar announced it would not air the program in light of the host's comments. Sinclair soon after said it would likewise preempt the program.</p><p>Those announcements followed comments from Federal Communications Commission Chairman Brendan Carr that <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2025/09/18/jimmy-kimmel-charlie-kirk-fcc-carr.html\">suggested</a> ABC affiliate stations could be at <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2025/09/19/trump-threatening-broadcast-station-licenses-explained.html\">risk of losing</a> broadcast station licenses over Kimmel's remarks, which came during a show monologue.</p><p>The series of events raised questions about influence by the Trump administration on the media and First Amendment protections.</p><p>\"Our decision to preempt this program was independent of any government interaction or influence,\" Sinclair said Friday. \"Free speech provides broadcasters with the right to exercise judgment as to the content on their local stations. While we understand that not everyone will agree with our decisions about programming, it is simply inconsistent to champion free speech while demanding that broadcasters air specific content.\"</p><p>Earlier this week, Sen. Maria Cantwell, D-Wash., <a href=\"https://www.cantwell.senate.gov/news/press-releases/cantwell-calls-on-sinclair-broadcasting-to-quit-blocking-publics-ability-to-watch-jimmy-kimmel-live\" target=\"_blank\">sent a letter</a> to Sinclair pushing to bring \"Jimmy Kimmel Live!\" back on air. Sinclair owns the Seattle ABC affiliate station.</p><p>Nexstar similarly denied any government influence. </p><p>\"As a local broadcaster, Nexstar remains committed to protecting the First Amendment while producing and airing local and national news that is fact-based and unbiased and, above all, broadcasting content that is in the best interest of the communities we serve,\" Nexstar said in a statement. </p><p>\"We stand apart from cable television, monolithic streaming services, and national networks in our commitment – and obligation – to be stewards of the public airwaves and to protect and reflect the specific sensibilities of our communities,\" the statement continued. \"To be clear, our commitment to those principles has guided our decisions throughout this process, independent of any external influence from government agencies or individuals.\"</p></div>"
