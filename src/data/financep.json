Trucks' made in other parts of the world\" will face the higher tariffs, <a href=\"https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/posts/115267382531822964\" target=\"_blank\">Trump said in a post on Truth Social</a>, attributing the move to protecting U.S. manufacturers from \"unfair outside competition\" and addressing national security concerns.</p><p>\"Large Truck Company Manufacturers, such as Peterbilt, Kenworth, Freightliner, Mack Trucks, and others, will be protected from the onslaught of outside interruptions,\" Trump added.</p><p>The decision came as Trump aimed a swath of imported goods with fresh tariffs, including 100% duties on branded drugs, 50% tariffs on kitchen cabinets and 30% on upholstered furniture, according to Trump's posts on Truth Social. All the new tariffs will also take effect from Oct. 1, Trump said.</p><p>\"We are looking forward to reviewing the details of the Medium and Heavy Truck Section 232 announcement made by the President,\" said a spokesperson for PACCAR, which owns Peterbilt and Kenworth.</p><p>Daimler Truck, parent company of Freightliner, and Mack Trucks, part of the Volvo Group, did not immediately respond to CNBC's request for comments.</p><p>The announcements followed <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2025/09/25/trump-tariff-threat-looms-over-robotics-and-medical-devices-section232-import-investigation.html\">several new investigations by the administration into imports of robotics</a>, industrial machinery and medical devices to determine if they pose national security risks.</p><p>The probes were opened under Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act, a provision that allows tariffs on national security grounds. The statute has previously been used to impose levies on numerous sectors, including <a href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/04/amendments-to-adjusting-imports-of-automobiles-and-automobile-parts-into-the-united-states/\" target=\"_blank\">automobiles and parts</a>, <a href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/fact-sheets/2025/07/fact-sheet-president-donald-j-trump-takes-action-to-address-the-threat-to-national-security-from-imports-of-copper/\" target=\"_blank\">copper, steel and aluminum</a>.</p><p>The higher duties on kitchen cabinets, bathroom vanities and certain furniture were due to \"large scale FLOODING\" of these imports into the U.S. and were hurting local manufacturers, Trump said on Truth Social.</p><p>The sweeping tariff threats left many questions unanswered, including whether the new sectoral levies fall under existing trade deals, said Deborah Elms, head of trade policy at Hinrich Foundation, adding that they will almost certainly drive up prices for American buyers.</p></div><div><p><a href=\"https://public.flourish.studio/visualisation/25326820/?utm_source=embed&utm_campaign=visualisation/25326820\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"Made with Flourish\" src=\"https://public.flourish.studio/resources/made_with_flourish.svg\" /> </a></p></div><div><p>U.S. production of heavy-duty trucks has rebounded in recent years, with the monthly shipment value more than tripled to $3.2 billion in July this year from a multiyear-low of around just $1.1 billion in April 2020, according to <a href=\"https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/A36CVS\" target=\"_blank\">data from the Federal Reserve Bank of St Louis</a>. This year, however, the value of the monthly shipments has been on a modest decline, the data showed.</p><p>Mexico was the <a href=\"https://www.trade.gov/data-visualization/medium-and-heavy-duty-truck-trade-data-visualization\" target=\"_blank\">largest exporter of medium- and heavy-duty trucks</a> to the U.S. last year, followed by Canada, Japan, Germany and Turkey, according to the Commerce Department's International Trade Administration.</p><p>Domestic heavy-truck manufacturers may see little benefit from the tariff hikes, if the materials needed for manufacturing still face high duties, said David Forgue, a partner at Chicago law firm Barnes, Richardson & Colburn.</p><p>The scale of impact on the industry will hinge on whether certain \"tariff offsets,\" similar to those on light-duty cars and trucks, are introduced, he added.</p><p>In April, Trump <a href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/04/amendments-to-adjusting-imports-of-automobiles-and-automobile-parts-into-the-united-states/\" target=\"_blank\">granted such reprieve</a> for the automotive sector — which faced 25% tariffs — by allowing manufacturers to apply for an \"import adjustment offset\" for vehicles that undergo final assembly in the U.S. The offset amount would equal 3.75% of the vehicles' retail prices, according to the White House.</p><p>\"Without something like that, the input tariffs will continue to be a drag on manufacturing,\" Forgue added.</p><p>Earlier in April, the Commerce Department <a href=\"https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2025/04/25/2025-07260/notice-of-request-for-public-comments-on-section-232-national-security-investigation-of-imports-of\" target=\"_blank\">launched a probe</a> into imports of medium- and heavy-duty trucks, parts and related products, inviting companies to submit their projected demand for these items, according to a Federal Register notice.</p><p>The notice defined \"heavy-duty trucks\" as those with a gross vehicle weight rating of 26,001 pounds or more.</p></div></div>"

In the first eight months of this year, Tesla EV registrations in Europe declined 32.6%, the ACEA said.</p><p>Meanwhile, total EV registrations throughout the region rose by around 26% through August compared to the same period in 2024. By contrast, registrations for petrol and diesel-powered vehicles declined by more than 20% over that stretch.</p><p>Still, RBC analysts wrote in a note on Thursday that they expect Tesla's total deliveries for the third quarter could amount to 456,000, above a FactSet-compiled consensus of 448,000 deliveries and a Visible Alpha consensus of 440,000 deliveries.</p><p>The analysts expect a bump for Tesla as <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2025/08/08/ev-sales-trump-tax-credit.html\">consumers rush</a> to buy EVs in the U.S. before a $7,500 federal tax credit expires at the end of September.</p><p>Even with Thursday's slide, Tesla's stock has bounced back following a brutal start to the year.

The rally was led by activist Tommy Robinson, a convicted fraudster with a violent criminal record.</p><p>British Prime Minister Keir Starmer rebuked Musk for \"dangerous\" comments that he made at the rally, where 26 police officers were injured. Musk told attendees, \"violence is coming to you\" and \"you either fight back or you die.\"</p><p>To revitalize interest in the brand, Tesla has said an affordable new model is in the works, which could help it fend off increased competition from the likes of Volkswagen, BYD and other EV makers that have been picking up market share. </p><p><strong>WATCH:</strong> <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/video/2025/09/16/cfra-downgrades-tesla-to-sell-the-analyst-garrett-nelson-behind-the-call-breaks-it-down.html\">CFRA downgrades Tesla</a></p></div><div><p><img src=\"https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/108199391-17580375141758037511-41675403985-1080pnbcnews.jpg?v=1758037513&w=750&h=422&vtcrop=y\" alt=\"CFRA downgrades Tesla to sell.

    "body": "<div><div><p>Muhammed Selim Korkutata | Anadolu | Getty Images</p></div><div><p><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/donald-trump/\">President Donald Trump</a> on Thursday signed an executive order approving a proposal that would keep TikTok alive in the U.S. in a transaction that Vice President JD Vance said values the business at $14 billion.</p><p>The deal satisfies the requirements of a national security law requiring China-based ByteDance to sell TikTok's U.S. operations or face an effective ban in the country, according to the executive order. Under the terms, which China must still approve, a new joint-venture company will oversee TikTok's U.S. business, with ByteDance retaining less than a 20% stake.</p><p>Enterprise tech giant <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/ORCL/\">Oracle</a>, Silver Lake and the Abu Dhabi-based MGX investment fund will be main investors in TikTok's U.S. business, controlling a roughly 45% stake in the entity, while ByteDance investors and new holders will own 35%, CNBC's David Faber <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2025/09/25/oracle-silver-lake-mgx-tiktok.html\">reported</a> earlier Thursday. </p><p>No representatives from ByteDance were present at the signing, and the company hasn't acknowledged that a transaction is taking place. No purchase price was mentioned, and there's no indication that the Chinese government has made changes to laws that would be necessary for a deal to take place.</p><p>President Trump said Chinese President Xi Jinping gave the deal the go ahead. Vance said the Chinese government put up some resistance before the agreement.</p><p>Under the planned arrangement, <span><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/ORCL/\">Oracle</a><span><span></span></span></span> will oversee the app's security operations and continue providing cloud computing services for the new TikTok U.S. firm, Faber reported, citing sources familiar with the deal. Trump said Oracle CEO <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/larry-ellison/\">Larry Ellison</a> is involved in the ownership group and that his company is \"playing a very big part.\"</p><p>\"It's owned by Americans, and very sophisticated Americans,\" Trump said at the signing. \"This is going to be American operated all the way.\"</p><p>ByteDance investors like General Atlantic, Susquehanna and Sequoia, are expected to contribute equity in the new TikTok U.S. entity, sources told Faber. ByteDance was reportedly <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2025/08/27/tiktok-owner-bytedance-sets-valuation-at-over-330-billion.html\">valued</a> at $330 billion last month.

    "body": "<div><p>Initial claims for unemployment insurance were well below expectations last week, helping to douse caution at the Federal Reserve and elsewhere that the labor market is in danger.</p><p>First-time filings for the week ended Sept. 20 totaled a seasonally adjusted 218,000, down 14,000 from the prior week's upwardly revised figure and significantly less than the Dow Jones consensus estimate for 235,000, the <a href=\"https://www.dol.gov/ui/data.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">Labor Department reported</a> Thursday.</p><p>Continuing claims, which run a week behind, were little changed, falling 2,000 to 1.926 million.</p><p>The release comes just a week after the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2025/09/17/fed-rate-decision-september-2025.html\">Federal Reserve voted to lower</a> its benchmark borrowing rate by a quarter percentage point to a range of 4%-4.25%.</p><p>In its post-meeting statement released Sept. 17, the Federal Open Market Committee said that part of the reasoning for the easing, the first in 2025, was that \"downside risks to employment have risen.\" Indeed, nonfarm payrolls growth has slowed to a crawl and the level of job openings is at a multiyear low.</p><p>However, the claims data, despite a bump earlier in the month, has shown that companies are still reluctant to part with workers even if hiring has declined considerably.</p><p>The claims data can be volatile, with Texas showing big gyrations in recent weeks. The state recorded a decline of nearly 7,000 filings last week, according to unadjusted figures.</p><p>Despite concerns rising that the economy could be slowing into the back part of the year, the economic data has remained fairly solid, and other reports Thursday confirmed underlying strength.</p><p><a href=\"https://www.bea.gov/sites/default/files/2025-09/gdp2q25-3rd.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">Gross domestic product</a>, the broadest measure of economic growth, posted a gain of 3.8% in the second quarter, according to the last of the three estimates that the Commerce Department released Thursday. The report reflected an unusually large upward adjustment of half a percentage point, which the Bureau of Economic Analysis attributed to a revision to consumer spending. GDP declined 0.6% in Q1, a slight downshift from the prior estimate.</p><p>Personal consumption expenditures, which drive about two-thirds of the $30 trillion U.S. economy, increased 2.5%, well above the 1.6% figure in the second estimate and better than the 0.6% rate in the first quarter.</p><p>In yet another sign of strength, spending on long-lasting items such as airplanes, appliances and computers increased 2.9% in August, compared with the forecast for a decline of 0.4% and better than the July figure, which showed a drop of 2.7%.</p><p>Even excluding transportation, new orders of so-called <a href=\"https://www.census.gov/manufacturing/m3/adv/current/index.html\" target=\"_blank\">durable goods</a> rose 0.4% and were up 1.9% when excluding defense.</p><p>Fed officials are watching the economic data closely for clues about where they should take policy next, and recent reports have indicated a mostly upbeat picture.</p><p>Housing, which has been the weakest spot, has showed some signs of life lately, with <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2025/09/24/august-new-home-sales-soar.html\">sales of newly built homes</a> soaring 20.5% in August, the biggest gain since January 2022. Existing home sales totaled an annualized rate of 4 million for the month, slightly better than expected.</p><p>Despite the solid data, markets still expect the Fed to cut twice more this year, at its meetings in October and December.</p><p>In <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2025/09/23/powell-says-slowing-labor-market-prompted-rate-cut-sees-challenging-situation-ahead.html\">a speech Tuesday</a>, Chair <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/jay-powell/\">Jerome Powell</a> said the economy \"is showing resilience in the midst of substantial changes in trade and immigration policies, as well as in fiscal, regulatory and geopolitical arenas.\"</p><p>Still, he left room for additional easing, noting that policy is still \"modestly restrictive\" on growth.</p></div>"
