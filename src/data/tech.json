If you’re not sure where to start to make improvements, you can also use one of the provided Gemini suggestions or simply tell the AI to “make it better.” </p>\n<p>The feature supports the usual types of edits, like lighting adjustments or removing distractions from the images, as well as more advanced edits, like removing objects in the background or restoring an old image. Plus, it can change photos to have fantastical AI elements added, for a bit of creativity. </p>\n<p>As you continue to edit, Gemini will support follow-up requests to help you fine-tune your work further. </p>\n<p>AI editing is currently <a href=\"https://support.google.com/photos/answer/15318661?hl=en&co=GENIE.Platform%3DAndroid\" target=\"_blank\">available</a> to users 18 and up in the U.S. in English.</p>\n<div>\n\t\t<p>Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t<p><span>San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>October 27-29, 2025</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n<p>The AI feature was announced alongside support for <a href=\"https://contentcredentials.org/\" target=\"_blank\">C2PA Content Credentials</a> in Google Photos, which identifies when images were created with AI.

This expansion will introduce Google’s conversational search interface to a broader market, allowing users to ask questions using natural language queries, engage in back-and-forth conversations, upload images, dig deeper on complex topics, and more.</p>\n<p>The Spanish-language rollout comes on the heels of Google’s major AI Mode expansion in August, when the company released the feature to <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/08/21/googles-ai-mode-expands-globally-adds-new-agentic-features/\">180 more countries worldwide</a>. Previously, it had only been available in the U.S., U.K., and India. During that August rollout, Google also introduced <a href=\"https://blog.google/products/search/ai-mode-agentic-personalized/\" target=\"_blank\">advanced AI capabilities</a> to its Google AI Ultra subscribers, allowing them to request restaurant reservations in AI Mode. The company plans to introduce support for other types of appointments and event ticket purchases in the future.</p>\n<p>Google has been rapidly rolling out AI across its products and services, often with multiple product announcements occurring simultaneously. For instance, the company announced Tuesday that it was bringing <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/09/23/google-photos-users-on-android-can-now-edit-their-photos-by-talking-to-or-texting-the-ai/\">conversational photo editing to all Android users </a>in the U.S. It also announced the same day that its more affordable Google AI Plus subscription plan, first introduced in Indonesia, is now arriving in 40 more countries. This expansion follows OpenAI’s recent launch of its ChatGPT’s Go plan, which launched in India <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/08/18/openai-launches-a-sub-5-chatgpt-plan-in-india/\">in August</a> and in Indonesia <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/09/22/after-india-openai-launches-its-affordable-chatgpt-go-plan-in-indonesia/\">on Tuesday</a>. </p>\n<p>The ChatGPT Go plan is a mid-tier subscription option that sits between OpenAI’s free version and its premium $20-per-month ChatGPT Plus plan. Users get 10 times higher usage limits than the free plan for sending questions or prompts, generating images, and uploading files. According to OpenAI, the plan also allows ChatGPT to remember previous conversations better, enabling more personalized responses over time.</p>\n<p>Google <a href=\"https://blog.google/products/search/ai-mode-expands-more-languages/\" target=\"_blank\">announced</a> earlier this month that AI Mode also now supports Hindi, Indonesian, Japanese, Korean, and Brazilian Portuguese.</p>\n<p>With so many products, users may find it hard to distinguish between different features and functionality, like the difference between Google’s AI Mode and its AI Overviews. The former is a separate, immersive, and conversational experience where users chat directly with Gemini AI. Meanwhile, AI Overviews simply offer a quick, AI-generated summary of information about your search query at the top of Google’s Search results.</p>\n</div><div>\n<div><p>\n\t\tSarah has worked as a reporter for TechCrunch since August 2011.

Formerly of GitHub and Microsoft, he’s now responsible for tools like Gemini CLI and <a href=\"https://codeassist.google/\" target=\"_blank\">Gemini Code Assist</a>, nudging developers into the new world of agentic programming.</p>\n<p>His team released <a href=\"https://blog.google/technology/developers/dora-report-2025/\" target=\"_blank\">new third-party research</a> on Tuesday showing how developers actually use AI tools — and how much progress is left to make. I sat down with Salva to talk about the report and his personal experience with AI coding tools.</p>\n<p><em>This interview was edited for length and clarity.</em></p>\n<p><strong>Every year, Google does a survey of developer trends — but this year’s report really focuses on AI tools, and specifically how agentic developers are willing to get in their approach to programming. Was there anything in the research that surprised you?</strong></p>\n<p>One of the really interesting findings was the median date when developers started using AI tools. They found it was April 2024, which corresponds fairly neatly to Claude 3 coming out and Gemini 2.5 coming out. This is really the dawn of the reasoning or thinking models, and around that same time, we got much better at tool-calling. </p>\n<p>For coding tasks, you really need to be able to leverage external information in order to problem solve, so it may need to grep, it may need to compile the code. If the code compiles it may want to run that unit test, and that integration test. I think that tool-calling really is the important piece that gave models the ability to self-correct as they move along.</p>\n<p><strong>How are you using AI coding tools personally?</strong></p>\n<div>\n\t\t<p>Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t<p><span>San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>October 27-29, 2025</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n<p>Most of my coding these days is for hobby projects, and I spend most of my time using command line-based tools. So that includes Gemini CLI. Then there’s a little bit of Claude Code, little bit of Codex in there. And you don’t ever really use a terminal-based tool by itself, so I’m really heterogeneous around the IDEs that I use. I use Zed. I use VS code. I use Cursor. I use Windsurf, all of them, because I’m interested in just seeing how the world works and how the industry is evolving.</p>\n<p>On the professional side, product managers tend to live in documents, so the first thing is using AI to help me write the specification and requirements docs.</p>\n<p><strong>I’m curious how that works. You’re using Gemini CLI to build Gemini CLI, but I would imagine it doesn’t just run itself.</strong></p>\n<p>A development task will usually start as an issue, maybe it’s a GitHub issue that someone’s dropped with a bug. Often, if I’m really being honest, it’s a fairly under-specified issue. So I’ll use Gemini CLI in order to create a more robust requirement doc in Markdown. That will usually create probably about 100 lines of fairly technical, but also outcome-driven specification. Then I will use Gemini CLI to write the code based on that specification and the general preferences in the team documents.</p>\n<p>Across the engineering team, we have a couple of different layers of rules and Markdown docs that get consumed by the model, just laying out our way of working: Here’s how we do testing, here’s how we manage dependencies, and so on. So when it produces the code, it’s also working from those documents.</p>\n<p>And as Gemini CLI is going through and doing the troubleshooting, I’ll have it update my requirements doc saying, “I fixed this step. Now I’m on to the next step,” and so on. Each one of those creates its own commit and pull request in the repository, so I can always rewind or undo.</p>\n<p>I would say probably 70% to 80% of my work is me working in the terminal with natural language, trying to use Gemini CLI to craft the requirements, and then allowing Gemini CLI to write most of the code for me, which I will then go review and read with whatever IDE I happen to be using. But mostly I’m using the IDE as a place to read the code, rather than to write the code.</p>\n<p><strong>Do you think there’s a future for raw computer code? Or will we just move everything into terminal windows?</strong></p>\n<p>For three decades, the IDE was where we went to do everything in software development. You had the IDE, you had the browser, and you had the terminal window.  </p>\n<p>I think that’s still largely the case, but I suspect that over time we’ll end up spending a lot more time working with the requirements, and the amount of time spent in the IDE will gradually shrink. And I think that change may actually happen over a pretty long time horizon. </p>\n<p><strong>There’s a lot of angst about what that means for software development as a progression. If 10 years from now, we’re no longer looking at code, what does that mean for developers? Will there still be a job for them?</strong></p>\n<p>I think that your job as a developer is going to look a lot more like an architect. It is going to be about taking big, complex problems and breaking them down into smaller, solvable tasks. You’ll need to be thinking about like the bigger picture about what you’re trying to produce, rather than the intermediate language in order to express that in machine code.</p>\n</div><div>\n<div>\n\t<p>\n\t\tRussell Brandom has been covering the tech industry since 2012, with a focus on platform policy and emerging technologies.

    "body": "<div>\n<p>Big electric trucks are having a hard time. The Cybertruck is a <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/07/16/gmc-hummer-ev-outsold-the-tesla-cybertruck-last-quarter/\" target=\"_blank\">bust</a>, Stellantis just <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/09/12/ram-ends-ev-pickup-truck-plans/\" target=\"_blank\">canceled the Ram 1500 REV</a>, and even sales of Ford’s promising F-150 Lightning have been on the decline.</p>\n<p>But the United States loves trucks. So is the key to making them love <em>electric</em> trucks… a very small one? </p>\n<p>That’s the bet that California-based startup Telo has been making since its inception in 2022. The company has designed a bite-sized truck called the MT1 with an admittedly not-so-small starting price of around $41,000. </p>\n<p>Now, investors want in on that same bet: Telo announced Tuesday it has closed a $20 million Series A funding round. The round was co-led by designer and Telo co-founder Yves Béhar, and Tesla co-founder Marc Tarpenning, who is on Telo’s board. Additional investment came from Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff, and early-stage funds like TO VC, E12 Ventures, and Neo.</p>\n<p>In the world of automotive manufacturing, $20 million does not go very far. To contrast, Slate Auto, which is building its own wild take on a small electric pickup truck, has <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/07/08/why-this-los-angeles-vc-firm-was-an-early-investor-in-slate-auto/\" target=\"_blank\">raised more than $700 million</a>. Startups like <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/08/30/the-fall-of-ev-startup-fisker-a-comprehensive-timeline/\" target=\"_blank\">Fisker Inc.</a>, <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/01/17/ev-startup-canoo-files-for-bankruptcy-and-ceases-operations/\" target=\"_blank\">Canoo</a>, and <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/03/15/lordstown-motors-nu-ride-chapter-11-foxconn/\" target=\"_blank\">Lordstown Motors</a> also raised hundreds of millions before they all collapsed.</p>\n<p>Telo has far more modest goals and a sharper aim than those companies, though. </p>\n<p>“Our hyper-focus is on trucks for the downtowns of cities,” co-founder and CEO Jason Marks told TechCrunch on a video call while bouncing around Telo’s 10,000-square-foot San Carlos facility — which shares a backyard with the original Tesla headquarters. </p>\n<div>\n\t\t<p>Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t<p><span>San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>October 27-29, 2025</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n<p>While Telo may someday embrace other markets — Marks said some small farmers are quite interested in the truck — the company considers those to be secondary. It’s cities that Marks wants to conquer first; the CEO said he’s spent far too much time circling San Francisco streets looking for parking to focus on any other use case.</p>\n<p>Telo is not promising to build hundreds of thousands of MT1s. Instead, it’s got a preorder list of around 12,000, and Marks said Telo initially plans to build around 5,000 per year via contract manufacturing.</p>\n<p>“Our whole ethos is, what does it take to get to unit profitability as quickly as possible,” he said. “That’s positioned us differently than the other automakers who have come out and said, ‘Hey, we need a billion dollars to get to production.’”</p>\n<p>The Series A funding will go toward building the final production-intent version of the MT1, homologating the vehicle to U.S. safety standards, and finishing crash testing. Marks said that last piece is key, because the MT1’s short front end has understandably inspired many questions about how safe the truck will be.</p>\n<p>Telo hopes to deliver its first MT1 by the end of 2026.</p>\n<p>To get the most out of the funding, Marks said Telo will stay “as lean as we physically can.” That means keeping its workforce to around 25 employees in the near-term, while leveraging consultants and contractors — many of whom Marks said have long-standing relationships with Tarpenning.</p>\n<p>The idea of using outside help is getting another boost with the Series A, as Marks said Telo filled the round with angel investors and smaller companies from across the EV world. “It’s a pretty incredible community that just wants to see new architectures for mobility succeed,” he said.</p>\n<p>The MT1 is a big idea, but it isn’t all about size. Marks said Telo has spent a lot of time making sure the MT1 is useful. For instance, he’s oriented the project around the idea of “performance per square foot.”</p>\n<p>“We’re the only vehicle that can seat five with a five-foot bed,” he said. That means despite the Telo truck’s diminutive stature, it squeezes in roughly an extra half-foot of space compared to some of the trucks it might compete with, like the 4.5-foot beds found on the all-electric Rivian R1T and the affordable compact Ford Maverick.</p>\n<p>But the biggest part of the MT1’s usefulness might be its range. Marks is adamant that the truck will get around 350 miles on a full battery, putting it up there with some of the most capable EVs on the market. Not only does that make the truck capable of longer drives, but it means less charging required for the city-dwellers Telo is targeting.</p>\n<p>Telo was able to hit this figure, according to Marks, through a combination of somewhat competing factors. The MT1’s small stature helps because it’s inherently not as heavy as a normal-sized truck, boosting efficiency. But that made it challenging to package the 106kWh battery pack in such a way that the MT1 wasn’t just a pallet of lithium-ion cells with seats.</p>\n<p>Marks didn’t go into too much detail, as Telo’s battery-related patents are still pending. But he said the MT1 essentially gives up some performance (like faster 0-60 speeds) in exchange for making the battery pack work in the footprint of a Mini Cooper.</p>\n<p>That robust range figure may be tempting if it ultimately bears out. And the rise in popularity of imported Japanese Kei trucks in the U.S. shows that people are willing to go to great lengths for something in this form factor. </p>\n<p>There are real headwinds against EVs in the U.S. these days, but Marks believes Telo can overcome them.</p>\n<p>“You’re told, ‘run fast, break things.’ It’s a very Silicon Valley nature,” he said. “But the other Silicon Valley nature is, how do you do a ton with the smallest amount of capital and the smallest team possible? Do things that big corporations can’t do?”</p>\n<p><em>Correction: This article previously mis-identified Marc Tarpenning as a Telo co-founder. He is on Telo’s board. The article has been updated.</em></p>\n</div>"

The Facebook-maker is investing “tens of millions” of dollars into a new super PAC to fight state-level tech policy proposals that could stifle AI advancement, reports <a href=\"https://www.axios.com/2025/09/23/meta-superpac-ai-regulation\" target=\"_blank\">Axios</a>.</p>\n<p>Meta’s pro-AI PAC, called the American Technology Excellence Project, is the company’s latest effort to combat policies it sees as harmful to the development of AI. Last month, <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/08/26/meta-to-spend-tens-of-millions-on-pro-ai-super-pac/\" target=\"_blank\">Meta launched a California-focused PAC</a> to back tech-friendly candidates in state races.</p>\n<p>Axios reports that Meta’s new super PAC will be run by Republican veteran Brian Baker and Democratic consulting firm Hilltop Public Solutions, and will work to elect tech-friendly politicians from both parties in next year’s midterm elections. Rachel Holland, a Meta spokesperson, told the outlet that the super PAC will focus on promoting and defending U.S. tech companies and leadership, advocating for AI progress, and putting parents in charge of how their children experience online apps and AI technologies.  </p>\n<p>The focus on parental control comes amid growing child safety concerns surrounding AI tools.

    "body": "<div>\n<p>SpaceX boasts an impressive alumni list. Some have gone on to found the sector’s biggest startups; others become astronauts.</p>\n<p>NASA unveiled its 2025 astronaut class this week, and two familiar names popped out: Anna Menon and Yuri Kubo. Both spent more than a decade at SpaceX, where they played critical roles in the company’s rise to the behemoth it is today.</p>\n<p>Menon joined SpaceX in 2018 after a career at NASA in the Mission Control Center, where she provided biomedical support for astronauts. As a senior engineer at SpaceX, she worked on private astronaut missions and flew as a mission specialist and medical officer aboard the Polaris Dawn private astronaut mission. That mission broke several records, including performing the first commercial spacewalk.  </p>\n<p>Kubo, meanwhile, spent 12 years at SpaceX as a Falcon 9 launch director and in senior roles overseeing the Starshield program and ground systems.  </p>\n<p>These 10 astronauts were chosen out of more than 8,000 applicants. Training is rigorous: The group will spend nearly two years learning the ropes before becoming eligible for assignments on the International Space Station and beyond. The training curriculum includes lessons in robotics, geology, foreign languages, space medicine, and more, alongside conducting simulated spacewalks and flight training, NASA said.</p>\n<p>If they pass training, this group will join the group of over 40 active astronauts, and may be part of the cohort that helps NASA transition to commercial private space stations upon the retirement of the ISS in 2030. This group will also be eligible for future science missions to the moon and Mars.</p>\n<p>This is not the first time SpaceX alumni have made the leap to government astronaut corps. Robb Kulin, former director of flight reliability at SpaceX, joined NASA’s 2017 class as a candidate. In 2021, Anil Menon — SpaceX’s first flight surgeon and medical director — was elected to be part of the Artemis generation of astronauts. (Anil and Anna are married.)</p>\n<div>\n\t\t<p>Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t<p><span>San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>October 27-29, 2025</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n<p>The trend underscores how the world’s most influential private space company is increasingly intertwined with bona fide astronaut work — not only supporting private missions like the Polaris program, but also producing astronauts themselves.  </p>\n<p>For decades, NASA astronauts mostly came from the military and academia. The commercial sector played little role in producing astronaut candidates. But SpaceX has changed that. The company has become a training ground for engineers and mission operators working on human spaceflight.</p>\n</div><div>\n<div>\n\t\t<p>Aria Alamalhodaei covers the space and defense industries at TechCrunch.

    "body": "<div>\n<p>This is not California state senator Scott Wiener’s first attempt at addressing the dangers of AI.</p>\n<p>In 2024, Silicon Valley mounted a <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/01/01/2024-the-year-silicon-valley-stifled-the-ai-doom-movement/\">fierce campaign</a> against his controversial AI safety bill, SB 1047, which would have made tech companies liable for the potential harms of their AI systems. Tech leaders warned that it would stifle America’s AI boom. Governor Gavin Newsom ultimately <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/09/29/gov-newsom-vetoes-californias-controversial-ai-bill-sb-1047/\">vetoed the bill</a>, echoing similar concerns, and a popular AI hacker house promptly <a href=\"https://x.com/JvNixon/status/1840499128243245389\" target=\"_blank\">threw</a> an “SB 1047 Veto Party.” One attendee told me, “Thank god, AI is still legal.”</p>\n<p>Now Wiener has returned with a new AI safety bill, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/09/13/california-lawmakers-pass-ai-safety-bill-sb-53-but-newsom-could-still-veto/\">SB 53</a>, which sits on Governor Newsom’s desk awaiting his signature or veto sometime in the next few weeks. This time around, the bill is much more popular or at least, Silicon Valley doesn’t seem to be at war with it.</p>\n<p>Anthropic outright <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/09/08/anthropic-endorses-californias-ai-safety-bill-sb-53/\">endorsed</a> SB 53 earlier this month. Meta spokesperson Jim Cullinan tells TechCrunch that the company supports AI regulation that balances guardrails with innovation and says, “SB 53 is a step in that direction,” though there are areas for improvement.</p>\n<p>Former White House AI policy adviser Dean Ball tells TechCrunch that SB 53 is a “victory for reasonable voices,” and thinks there’s a strong chance Governor Newsom signs it.</p>\n<p>If signed, SB 53 would impose some of the nation’s first safety reporting requirements on AI giants like OpenAI, Anthropic, xAI, and Google — companies that today face no obligation to reveal how they test their AI systems. Many AI labs voluntarily publish safety reports explaining how their AI models could be used to create bioweapons and other dangers, but they do this at will and <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/04/03/google-is-shipping-gemini-models-faster-than-its-ai-safety-reports/\">they’re not always consistent</a>.</p>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billTextClient.xhtml?bill_id=202520260SB53\" target=\"_blank\">bill</a> requires leading AI labs — specifically those making more than $500 million in revenue — to publish safety reports for their most capable AI models. Much like SB 1047, the bill specifically focuses on the worst kinds of AI risks: their ability to contribute to human deaths, cyberattacks, and chemical weapons. Governor Newsom is considering several other bills that address other types of AI risks, such as <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/09/11/a-california-bill-that-would-regulate-ai-companion-chatbots-is-close-to-becoming-law/\">engagement-optimization techniques</a> in AI companions.</p>\n<div>\n\t\t<p>Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t<p><span>San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>October 27-29, 2025</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n<p>SB 53 also creates protected channels for employees working at AI labs to report safety concerns to government officials, and establishes a state-operated cloud computing cluster, CalCompute, to provide AI research resources beyond the Big Tech companies.</p>\n<p>One reason SB 53 may be more popular than SB 1047 is that it’s less severe. SB 1047 also would have made AI companies liable for any harms caused by their AI models, whereas SB 53 focuses more on requiring self-reporting and transparency. SB 53 also narrowly applies to the world’s largest tech companies, rather than startups.</p>\n<p>But many in the tech industry still believe states should leave AI regulation up to the federal government. In a <a href=\"https://cdn.openai.com/pdf/oai_ca-safety-letter_8-11-25.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">recent letter </a>to Governor Newsom, OpenAI argued that AI labs should only have to comply with federal standards — which is a funny thing to say to a state governor. Venture firm Andreessen Horowitz wrote a recent <a href=\"https://a16z.com/the-commerce-clause-in-the-age-of-ai-guardrails-and-opportunities-for-state-legislatures/\" target=\"_blank\">blog post</a> vaguely suggesting that some bills in California could violate the Constitution’s dormant Commerce Clause, which prohibits states from unfairly limiting interstate commerce.</p>\n<p>Senator Wiener addresses these concerns: He lacks faith in the federal government to pass meaningful AI safety regulation, so states need to step up. In fact, Wiener thinks the Trump administration has been captured by the tech industry and that recent federal efforts to block all state AI laws are a form of Trump “rewarding his funders.”</p>\n<p>The Trump administration has made a notable shift away from the Biden administration’s focus on AI safety, replacing it with an emphasis on growth. Shortly after taking office, Vice President J.D. Vance appeared at an <a href=\"https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/remarks-the-vice-president-the-artificial-intelligence-action-summit-paris-france\" target=\"_blank\">AI conference</a> in Paris and said: “I’m not here this morning to talk about AI safety, which was the title of the conference a couple of years ago. I’m here to talk about AI opportunity.”</p>\n<p>Silicon Valley has applauded this shift, exemplified by Trump’s AI Action Plan, which <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/07/23/trumps-ai-strategy-trades-guardrails-for-growth-in-race-against-china/\">removed barriers</a> to building out the infrastructure needed to train and serve AI models. Today, Big Tech CEOs are regularly seen <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/story/tech-ceos-donald-trump-white-house/\" target=\"_blank\">dining at the White House</a> or announcing <a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/moorinsights/2025/01/30/the-stargate-project-trump-touts-500-billion-bid-for-ai-dominance/\" target=\"_blank\">hundred-billion-dollar data centers</a> alongside President Trump.</p>\n<p>Senator Wiener thinks it’s critical for California to lead the nation on AI safety, but without choking off innovation.</p>\n<p>I recently interviewed Senator Wiener to discuss his years at the negotiating table with Silicon Valley and why he’s so focused on AI safety bills. Our conversation has been edited lightly for clarity and brevity. </p>\n<p><strong>Senator Wiener, I interviewed you when SB 1047 was sitting on Governor Newsom’s desk. Talk to me about the journey you’ve been on to regulate AI safety in the last few years</strong>.</p>\n<p>It’s been a roller coaster, an incredible learning experience, and just really rewarding. We’ve been able to help elevate this issue [of AI safety], not just in California, but in the national and international discourse.</p>\n<p>We have this incredibly powerful new technology that is changing the world. How do we make sure it benefits humanity in a way where we reduce the risk? How do we promote innovation, while also being very mindful of public health and public safety. It’s an important — and in some ways, existential — conversation about the future. SB 1047, and now SB 53, have helped to foster that conversation about safe innovation.</p>\n<p><strong>In the last 20 years of technology, what have you learned about the importance of laws that can hold Silicon Valley to account?</strong></p>\n<p>I’m the guy who represents San Francisco, the beating heart of AI innovation. I’m immediately north of Silicon Valley itself, so we’re right here in the middle of it all. But we’ve also seen how the large tech companies — some of the wealthiest companies in world history — have been able to stop federal regulation.</p>\n<p>Every time I see tech CEOs having dinner at the White House with the aspiring fascist dictator, I have to take a deep breath. These are all really brilliant people who have generated enormous wealth. A lot of folks I represent work for them. It really pains me when I see the deals that are being struck with Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates, and how that money <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/09/15/us/politics/trump-uae-chips-witkoff-world-liberty.html\" target=\"_blank\">gets funneled into Trump’s meme coin</a>. It causes me deep concern.</p>\n<p>I’m not someone who’s anti-tech. I want tech innovation to happen. It’s incredibly important. But this is an industry that we should not trust to regulate itself or make voluntary commitments. And that’s not casting aspersions on anyone. This is capitalism, and it can create enormous prosperity but also cause harm if there are not sensible regulations to protect the public interest. When it comes to AI safety, we’re trying to thread that needle.</p>\n<p><strong>SB 53 is focused on the worst harms that AI could imaginably cause — death, massive cyberattacks, and the creation of bioweapons. Why focus there?</strong></p>\n<p>The risks of AI are varied. There is algorithmic discrimination, job loss, deep fakes, and scams. There have been various bills in California and elsewhere to address those risks. SB 53 was never intended to cover the field and address every risk created by AI. We’re focused on one specific category of risk, in terms of catastrophic risk.</p>\n<p>That issue came to me organically from folks in the AI space in San Francisco — startup founders, frontline AI technologists, and people who are building these models. They came to me and said, “This is an issue that needs to be addressed in a thoughtful way.”</p>\n<p><strong>Do you feel that AI systems are inherently unsafe, or have the potential to cause death and massive cyberattacks?</strong></p>\n<p>I don’t think they’re inherently safe. I know there are a lot of people working in these labs who care very deeply about trying to mitigate risk. And again, it’s not about eliminating risk. Life is about risk, unless you’re going to live in your basement and never leave, you’re going to have risk in your life. Even in your basement, the ceiling might fall down.</p>\n<p>Is there a risk that some AI models could be used to do significant harm to society? Yes, and we know there are people who would love to do that. We should try to make it harder for bad actors to cause these severe harms, and so should the people developing these models.</p>\n<p><strong>Anthropic issued its support for SB 53. What are your conversations like with other industry players?</strong></p>\n<p>We’ve talked to everyone: large companies, small startups, investors, and academics. Anthropic has been really constructive. Last year, they never formally supported [SB 1047] but they had positive things to say about aspects of the bill. I don’t think [Anthropic] loves every aspect of SB 53, but I think they concluded that on balance the bill was worth supporting.</p>\n<p>I’ve had conversations with large AI labs who are not supporting the bill, but are not at war with it in the way they were with SB 1047. It’s not surprising. SB 1047 was more of a liability bill, SB 53 is more of a transparency bill. Startups have been less engaged this year because the bill really focuses on the largest companies.</p>\n<p><strong>Do you feel pressure from the large AI PACs that have formed in recent months?</strong></p>\n<p>This is another symptom of Citizens United. The wealthiest companies in the world can just pour endless resources into these PACs to try to intimidate elected officials. Under the rules we have, they have every right to do that. It’s never really impacted how I approach policy. There have been groups trying to destroy me for as long as I’ve been in elected office. Various groups have spent millions trying to blow me up, and here I am. I’m in this to do right by my constituents and try to make my community, San Francisco, and the world a better place. </p>\n<p><strong>What’s your message to Governor Newsom as he’s debating whether to sign or veto this bill?</strong></p>\n<p>My message is that we heard you. You vetoed SB 1047 and provided a very comprehensive and thoughtful veto message. You wisely convened a working group that produced a very strong report, and we really looked to that report in crafting this bill. The governor laid out a path, and we followed that path in order to come to an agreement, and I hope we got there.</p>\n</div>"
