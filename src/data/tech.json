    "body": "<div>\n<p>As visa crackdowns and diplomatic tensions block traditional study-abroad routes, India’s <a href=\"https://leverageedu.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Leverage Edu</a> is helping students reroute their dreams — from Canada to Germany, and from India to Nigeria and Saudi Arabia. That agility is paying off: The startup has doubled its revenue, turned profitable, and is now expanding its global footprint.</p>\n<p>Over the past several months, students across emerging markets have faced growing uncertainty around international college admissions. Shifting visa rules and diplomatic tensions — from the <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c89lne2k87vo\" target=\"_blank\">2023-2024 standoff between India and Canada</a> to new <a href=\"https://www.newyorker.com/news/q-and-a/the-stunning-reversal-in-us-india-relations\" target=\"_blank\">strains in India-U.S. ties</a> over <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2025-09-29/us-tariffs-are-testing-modi-s-fiscal-frugality\" target=\"_blank\">tariffs</a> and <a href=\"https://www.csis.org/analysis/how-trump-20-immigration-policies-could-strain-modis-us-strategy\" target=\"_blank\">immigration policy</a> — have disrupted application timelines and eligibility for thousands. Countries such as Canada and Australia have introduced <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/australia-tightens-student-visa-rules-migration-hits-record-high-2024-03-21/\" target=\"_blank\">stricter student visa policies</a>, catching many families off guard. Even long-standing local consultants and study-abroad firms have struggled to adapt. Meanwhile, <a href=\"https://leverage.biz/\" target=\"_blank\">Leverage</a> — the startup behind the study-abroad platform Leverage Edu — has responded by helping students identify alternative destinations and adjust quickly, keeping their plans on track despite the disruption.</p>\n<p>The eight-year-old startup was quick to respond when India-Canada relations soured, helping Indian students reroute to Germany and assisting Canadian universities in recruiting from Nigeria — effectively salvaging student pipelines in both regions. It is now applying that same playbook amid ongoing U.S.-India strains.</p>\n<p>While Leverage continues to send students to the U.S., a growing share of that demand now comes from countries like Brazil and Vietnam — where interest in U.S. universities remains strong, founder and CEO Akshay Chaturvedi said in an interview.</p>\n<p>That ability to shift quickly across geographies is now central to Leverage’s growth strategy. In the last two months, the startup has expanded into Saudi Arabia, Egypt, Vietnam, and Malaysia — emerging markets with growing numbers of students seeking to study abroad but with limited access to structured admissions support. With this push, Leverage now operates in 16 countries where it recruits students, helping them apply to universities across 11 destination countries.</p>\n<p>Beyond applications, the startup — headquartered in Noida, a tech hub on the outskirts of New Delhi — is positioning itself as a full-service platform for international education, helping students plan, finance, and manage their journeys. Its tools include a mobile app, an AI-powered course search engine, a university matchmaking tool called UniConnect, and a newly launched SaaS suite for global universities under the brand Univalley.ai.</p>\n<p>The startup has also expanded into adjacent categories, with offerings like Leverage MBBS for medical aspirants under Leverage Edu, as well as Fly Finance for education loans, Fly Homes for student housing, and other services under Leverage Careers and Compass.</p>\n<div>\n\t\t<p>Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t<p><span>San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>October 27-29, 2025</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n<p>Leverage now places over 10,000 students annually, up from around 1,500 just a few years ago. Much of that growth has come through organic demand, with 60% of student acquisitions requiring zero customer acquisition cost, according to Chaturvedi.</p>\n<p>“Our gap has narrowed with most of our global competitors who were either large listed companies or who had raised some of these mega rounds,” he told TechCrunch.</p>\n<figure><img src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/leverage-edu-founder-akshay-chaturvedi.jpg\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/leverage-edu-founder-akshay-chaturvedi.jpg 1660w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/leverage-edu-founder-akshay-chaturvedi.jpg?resize=150,101 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/leverage-edu-founder-akshay-chaturvedi.jpg?resize=300,202 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/leverage-edu-founder-akshay-chaturvedi.jpg?resize=768,516 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/leverage-edu-founder-akshay-chaturvedi.jpg?resize=680,457 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/leverage-edu-founder-akshay-chaturvedi.jpg?resize=1200,807 1200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/leverage-edu-founder-akshay-chaturvedi.jpg?resize=1280,861 1280w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/leverage-edu-founder-akshay-chaturvedi.jpg?resize=430,289 430w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/leverage-edu-founder-akshay-chaturvedi.jpg?resize=720,484 720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/leverage-edu-founder-akshay-chaturvedi.jpg?resize=900,605 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/leverage-edu-founder-akshay-chaturvedi.jpg?resize=800,538 800w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/leverage-edu-founder-akshay-chaturvedi.jpg?resize=1536,1033 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/leverage-edu-founder-akshay-chaturvedi.jpg?resize=668,449 668w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/leverage-edu-founder-akshay-chaturvedi.jpg?resize=558,375 558w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/leverage-edu-founder-akshay-chaturvedi.jpg?resize=918,617 918w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/leverage-edu-founder-akshay-chaturvedi.jpg?resize=708,476 708w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/leverage-edu-founder-akshay-chaturvedi.jpg?resize=50,34 50w\" /><figcaption><span>Leverage Founder and CEO Akshay Chaturvedi</span><span><strong>Image Credits:</strong>Akshay Chaturvedi / Instagram</span></figcaption></figure>\n<p>Financially, Leverage has seen sharp growth — and turned profitable for the first time this year, a rarity in India’s edtech sector. The startup closed fiscal year 2025 with over ₹1.8 billion (around $20 million) in revenue, doubling from the previous year’s ₹900 million (approximately $10 million). Between April and September, the first half of fiscal year 2026, it generated more than ₹2 billion (roughly $23 million), and is on track to end the fiscal year with ₹3.7-₹3.8 billion (about $45 million) in revenue.</p>\n<p>On the profitability front, Leverage garnered ₹120-130 million (approximately $1.4-1.5 million) in profit after tax, and expects to surpass ₹250 million ($2.8 million) by the end of fiscal year 2026 — marking a 256% turnaround from a full-year loss of ₹800 million in fiscal year 2025.</p>\n<p>The startup generates around 25% of its revenue from its platform businesses, which support students beyond admissions — with value-added services including loans, money remittance, housing, and assistance with securing internships or first jobs. The remaining 75% of revenue comes from its core education business —  the student placement and counseling services. Within that, about 20% comes directly from students and 55% from universities in commissions, Chaturvedi told TechCrunch.</p>\n<p>India remains Leverage’s largest source market, accounting for 58% of its total student base. Within the country, the startup focuses on states like Andhra Pradesh, Kerala, and Punjab — regions that consistently send large numbers of students to universities abroad.</p>\n<p>In terms of destinations, the U.K. remains Leverage’s largest market, accounting for 52% of student placements, followed by Germany at 22%. Italy — its fastest-growing market this summer — is also gaining traction.</p>\n<p>North America currently represents less than 5% of total placements for Leverage, reflecting tightened visa rules and diplomatic headwinds in recent years. The startup expects this share to grow as its presence expands across Latin America, Southeast Asia, and the Middle East. </p>\n<h2 id=\"h-india-ipo-in-plans-likely-for-2026\">India IPO in plans, likely for 2026</h2>\n<p>With rising revenues and an expanding global footprint, the startup is now weighing a potential IPO in India as early as next year, and investment bankers have already made early pitches, people familiar with the matter told TechCrunch.</p>\n<p>Founder and CEO Chaturvedi did not deny the possibility of a public listing, but he said Leverage would decide between pursuing an IPO or raising external capital after hitting the $100 million revenue milestone, which the company expects to reach sometime in 2026.</p>\n<p>So far, Leverage has raised less than $50 million in equity. The company operates across 27 countries through over 50 offices and has a headcount of around 800 people.</p>\n</div>"

The company currently operates a commercial service in <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/09/16/waymo-approved-to-start-testing-autonomous-vehicles-at-san-francisco-international-airport/\">San Francisco</a>, Austin, Atlanta, Phoenix, and Los Angeles, and plans to open to the public in Miami, Washington, D.C., Dallas, Denver, and Nashville within the next year. </p>\n<p>“As sponsor of legislation on autonomous vehicles at the state level, I’m encouraged to see New York City moving forward with testing that will show us how this technology can improve safety, reduce congestion, and expand mobility,” Assemblymember Brian Cunningham said in a statement. “This is the type of measured innovation that allows us to prepare for the future while making sure progress works for New Yorkers.” </p>\n<p>Still, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/08/13/waymo-finally-has-a-music-experience-worthy-of-its-robotaxi/\">Waymo</a> has a long way to go in NYC — a city where the Alphabet-owned company has been trying to operate since 2021. Even with this permit, Waymo cannot carry passengers or operate a commercial robotaxi service without getting separate licenses from the city’s Taxi and Limousine Commission. A Waymo spokesperson declined to comment on whether the company is in talks to apply for those licenses. TechCrunch has reached out to the TLC to learn more about requirements for AV companies.  </p>\n<p>Another hurdle is that there is no permitting structure in New York that allows Waymo or any other AV company to test or deploy robotaxis without a human safety driver. While <a href=\"https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S2688#:~:text=2025%2DS2688%20(ACTIVE)%20%2D%20Summary,the%20operation%20of%20autonomous%20taxicabs.\" target=\"_blank\">legislation has been introduced</a> to create a framework for driverless operation, nothing has been passed into law yet.  </p>\n</div>\n\t\t\t<div>\n\t<p>Topics</p>\n</div>\n<div>\n<div>\n\t\t<p>Rebecca Bellan is a senior reporter at TechCrunch where she covers the business, policy, and emerging trends shaping artificial intelligence.

Some former OpenAI employees I’ve spoken to argue the consumer business can, in theory, serve the mission: ChatGPT helps fund AI research and distribute the technology widely.</p>\n<p>OpenAI CEO Sam Altman said as much in a <a href=\"https://x.com/sama/status/1973381552621887706\" target=\"_blank\">post on X</a> Wednesday, addressing why the company is allocating so much capital and computing power to an AI social media app:</p>\n<div>\n\t\t<p>Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t<p><span>San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>October 27-29, 2025</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n<p>“We do mostly need the capital for build [sic] AI that can do science, and for sure we are focused on AGI with almost all of our research effort,” said Altman. “It is also nice to show people cool new tech/products along the way, make them smile, and hopefully make some money given all that compute need.”</p>\n<p>“When we launched chatgpt there was a lot of ‘who needs this and where is AGI,’” Altman continued. “[R]eality is nuanced when it comes to optimal trajectories for a company.”</p>\n<figure><div>\n<blockquote><div><p>i get the vibe here, but…</p><p>we do mostly need the capital for build AI that can do science, and for sure we are focused on AGI with almost all of our research effort.</p><p>it is also nice to show people cool new tech/products along the way, make them smile, and hopefully make some… <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://t.co/bcCUmXsloP\">https://t.co/bcCUmXsloP</a></p></div>— Sam Altman (@sama) <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://twitter.com/sama/status/1973381552621887706?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">October 1, 2025</a></blockquote>\n</div></figure>\n<p>But at what point does OpenAI’s consumer business overtake its nonprofit mission? In other words, when does OpenAI say no to a money-making, platform-growing opportunity because it’s at odds with the mission?</p>\n<p>The question looms as regulators scrutinize <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/09/11/openai-secures-microsofts-blessing-to-transition-its-for-profit-arm/\">OpenAI’s for-profit transition</a>, which OpenAI needs to complete to raise additional capital and eventually go public. California Attorney General Rob Bonta <a href=\"https://oag.ca.gov/news/press-releases/attorney-general-bonta-openai-harm-children-will-not-be-tolerated\" target=\"_blank\">said</a> last month that he is “particularly concerned with ensuring that the stated safety mission of OpenAI as a nonprofit remains front and center” in the restructuring.</p>\n<p>Skeptics have dismissed OpenAI’s mission as a branding tool to lure talent from Big Tech. But many insiders at OpenAI insist it’s central to why they joined the company in the first place.</p>\n<p>For now, Sora’s footprint is small; the app is one day old. But its debut marks a significant expansion of OpenAI’s consumer business and exposes the company to incentives that have plagued social media apps for decades.</p>\n<p>Unlike ChatGPT, which is optimized for usefulness, OpenAI says Sora is built for fun — a place to generate and share AI clips. The feed feels closer to TikTok or Instagram Reels, platforms that are infamous for their addictive loops.</p>\n<p>OpenAI insists it wants to avoid those pitfalls, claiming in a <a href=\"https://openai.com/index/sora-2/\" target=\"_blank\">blog post</a> announcing the Sora launch that “concerns about doomscrolling, addiction, isolation, and RL-sloptimized feeds are top of mind.” The company explicitly says it’s not optimizing for time spent on feed and instead wants to maximize creation. OpenAI says it will send reminders to users when they’ve been scrolling for too long, and primarily show them people they know.</p>\n<p>That’s a stronger starting point than Meta’s Vibes — another AI-powered short-form video feed released last week — which seems to have been raced out without as many safeguards. As a former OpenAI policy leader, Miles Brundage <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://x.com/Miles_Brundage/status/1973263523292807572\">points out</a> that it’s possible there will be good and bad applications of AI-video feeds, much like we’ve seen in the chatbot era.</p>\n<p>Still, as Altman has long acknowledged, no one sets out to build an addictive app. The incentives of running a feed guide them to it. OpenAI has even run into problems around <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/06/02/how-ai-chatbots-keep-you-chatting/\">sycophancy in ChatGPT</a>, which the company says was unintentional due to some of its training techniques.</p>\n<p>In a <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DB9mjd-65gw\" target=\"_blank\">June podcast</a>, Altman discussed what he calls “the big misalignment of social media.”</p>\n<p>“One of the big mistakes of the social media era was [that] the feed algorithms had a bunch of unintended, negative consequences on society as a whole, and maybe even individual users. Although they were doing the thing that a user wanted — or someone thought users wanted — in the moment, which is [to] get them to, like, keep spending time on the site.”</p>\n<p>It’s too soon to tell how aligned the Sora app is with its users or OpenAI’s mission. Users are already noticing some engagement-optimizing techniques in the app, such as the dynamic emojis that appear every time you like a video. That feels designed to shoot a little dopamine to users for engaging with a video.</p>\n<p>The real test will be how OpenAI evolves Sora. Given how much AI has taken over regular social media feeds, it seems plausible that AI-native feeds could soon have their moment. Whether OpenAI can grow Sora without replicating the mistakes of its predecessors remains to be seen.</p>\n</div>"

    "body": "<div>\n<p>The footage was striking: A food delivery worker scrambles with his e-bike across a bridge in Chicago, chased by a cadre of armed, masked federal agents. “Get him!” one yells, before the worker ultimately slips away. </p>\n<p>The viral clip became a rallying point this week for critics of President Donald Trump’s deportation machine, which has spread to multiple U.S. cities and swept up citizens in the process. For Mike Peregudov, the co-founder of e-bike subscription service Whizz, it was a visceral representation of the abject fear delivery workers have described to his team for weeks in Chicago.</p>\n<p>That’s because the threat of being snatched up by Customs and Border Protection (CBP), Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), or one of the many other agencies helping boost the administration’s deportation numbers, has become measurable in Whizz’s own metrics.</p>\n<p> “The reason Whizz’s fleet hasn’t grown in Chicago in the last month,” Peregudov wrote in <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7378497365516865536/\" target=\"_blank\">a LinkedIn post</a>, where he shared the clip. “It has become way harder to deliver a food order in the city.” </p>\n<p>Whizz is relatively new to Chicago, having only launched in the city a few months ago. But Peregudov told TechCrunch in an interview the company’s fleet was “growing really fast” over the summer, from having zero bikes on the ground in March to around 300 by the end of July.</p>\n<p>This growth was encouraging for Whizz’s mission of providing safe, reliable, and affordable bikes for delivery workers. For years, many of those same workers have had to rely on a <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/06/05/whizz-wants-to-own-the-delivery-e-bike-subscription-space-starting-with-nyc/\">mish-mash of products</a> with questionable reliability, causing the vehicles to be banned in some cities.</p>\n<p>Dynamics changed in August when Trump threatened to send National Guard troops into the city, according to Peregudov. Growth not only halted, but Whizz has lost about 8% of its business since, he said. The National Guard threats, plus the constant ICE raids, has spooked the food delivery workforce.</p>\n<div>\n\t\t<p>Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t<p><span>San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>October 27-29, 2025</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n<p>“They’re afraid,” he said of workers who have returned bikes to Whizz’s Chicago office. Whizz doesn’t employ these gig economy workers; it only rents out e-bikes, which can be obtained by anyone with proper identification, a social security number, and a credit card. </p>\n<p>With U.S. citizens and lawful permanent residents getting scooped up in similar raids around the country, Peregudov said this fear is shared by both documented and undocumented immigrants. </p>\n<p>“When a raid happens, these people can [detain] the guy for, whatever, two weeks,” he said. “When they understand he is legally here, they will let him go away, but he will lose those two weeks.”</p>\n<p>Immigration raids are happening in most of the other cities where Whizz operates, including New York, San Francisco, and Philadelphia. But those locations have so far been spared Trump’s more militaristic deployments, which amp up the tension.</p>\n<p>The company also operates in Washington, D.C., where President Trump has brought in National Guard troops. Curiously, Peregudov said business is actually up in the nation’s capital.</p>\n<p>He attributes that in large part to the fact that, according to him, police and federal agents appear to be targeting delivery drivers who use gasoline mopeds without a license. That’s driving more delivery workers to Whizz and its less-regulated e-bikes, he said.</p>\n<p>An immigrant himself, Peregudov shied away from commenting too much on the administration’s policies and actions. “I came here using a talent visa,” he said, “so it was not that stressful for me. It was way easier than for these guys.” </p>\n</div><div>\n<div>\n\t\t<p>Sean O’Kane is a reporter who has spent a decade covering the rapidly-evolving business and technology of the transportation industry, including Tesla and the many startups chasing Elon Musk.

    "body": "<div>\n<p>Earlier this year, Anker, the Chinese company that makes Eufy security cameras, offered its users money in exchange for videos of package and car thefts. </p>\n<p>The popular internet-connected security camera maker <a href=\"https://community.eufy.com/t/help-improve-eufy-ai-earn-cash/4662267\" target=\"_blank\">said it would pay its customers $2 per video to train its AI systems</a> to help better detect thieves who steal cars and packages.  </p>\n<p>“To ensure we have enough data, we are looking for videos of both real and staged events, to help train the Al what to be on the lookout for,” the company wrote on its website.  </p>\n<p>“You can even create events by pretending to be a thief and donate those events,” the website reads. “You can complete this quickly. Maybe one act can be captured by your two outdoor cameras simultaneously, making it efficient and easy. If you also stage a car door theft, you might earn $80.” </p>\n<p>Eufy also wrote that “the data collected from these staged events is used solely for training our Al algorithms and not for any other purposes.”  </p>\n<p>This initiative shows that companies are willing to pay to get users’ data they think can be useful to train their AI models. While this gives some users the ability to get value out of their own data, there are security and privacy risks involved.  </p>\n<p>Case in point: Last week, TechCrunch found that Neon, <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/09/24/neon-the-no-2-social-app-on-the-apple-app-store-pays-users-to-record-their-phone-calls-and-sells-data-to-ai-firms/\" target=\"_blank\">a viral calling app</a> that offered money to users willing to share recordings and transcripts of their calls, <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/09/25/viral-call-recording-app-neon-goes-dark-after-exposing-users-phone-numbers-call-recordings-and-transcripts/\" target=\"_blank\">had a security flaw that allowed users to access any other user’s data</a>. After being alerted of the security lapse, Neon went offline.  </p>\n<h2 id=\"h-hundreds-of-thousands-of-videos-donated-to-train-ai\">Hundreds of thousands of videos ‘donated’ to train AI</h2>\n<p>Eufy’s campaign offering $2 per video for theft videos ran from December 18, 2024, to February 25, 2025. More than 120 users responded on the campaign’s announcement page saying they participated in it, according to comments posted by users there.  </p>\n<p>The company’s goal was to collect 20,000 videos each of package thefts and of “pulling car doors.” Eufy users could participate by filling out <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSe5MnlPD7oI9yf9eb56ttG_otnMdFg60VwVHtlmtRDk6hJzkQ/viewform\" target=\"_blank\">a Google Form</a> where they could upload videos and their PayPal account for payment.  </p>\n<p>Eufy did not respond to TechCrunch’s requests for comment and our questions, such as how many users participated in the campaign, how much money it paid those users, how many videos the company collected, and whether the company deleted the collected videos after training its AI systems.  </p>\n<p>Since then, Eufy has similar campaigns aimed at incentivizing its customers to send in videos to train their AI. </p>\n<p>As of the time of publication, through another in-app campaign that Eufy calls the Video Donation Program to improve its AI systems, Eufy also offers users rewards that range from an “Apprentice Medal,” which appears to simply be a badge next to the user’s name in the app, to gifts such as cameras or gift cards. </p>\n<p>Eufy is only asking for videos involving humans for this campaign. </p>\n<p>The Eufy app also shows an “Honor Wall” that ranks users who have donated the most video events. The leader of the ranking has donated 201,531 videos, according to the app.  </p>\n<p>In the app’s page for the donation program, Eufy clarifies that “donated videos are only used for Al training and improvement.

You can use AI to get a gist of a certain topic based on your prompt. You’ll then get a summary report on a topic in a Notion-styled document, which you can edit.</p>\n<p>Since the core application is a browser, you can open URLs and surf the web. While browsing, you can summarize and extract key insights from web pages, PDFs, and YouTube videos.</p>\n<figure><p>\n<iframe width=\"500\" height=\"281\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/HYkTnVWXM0A?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\"></iframe>\n</p></figure>\n<p>Users can mention multiple tabs to the AI chatbot, using them as context, and ask questions around them. Additionally, Deta Surf can generate code, so you can ask the tool to create mini apps, interactive graphs, or charts for your notebook. You can also add any of the output from AI to a particular notebook.</p>\n<p>Most modern-day AI-browsers like <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/07/09/perplexity-launches-comet-an-ai-powered-web-browser/\">Perplexity’s Comet</a>, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/07/21/dia-launches-a-skill-gallery-perplexity-to-add-tasks-to-comet/\">The Browser Company’s Dia</a>, and <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/09/30/opera-launches-its-ai-centric-neon-browser/\">Opera Neon</a> allow users to use tabs as context.

However, <a href=\"https://x.com/detahq/status/1830605654920466888\" target=\"_blank\">the company sunset the product in 2023</a>, and started working on an AI browser.</p>\n<p>The company’s co-founder, Max Eusterbrock, said that the company explored different interfaces for a browser, but realized that pursuing this direction was a bad idea.</p>\n<p>“We were in Alpha for a year. During that time, we realized that AI browsers are landing in the spot where they are fundamentally becoming tools for machines to click around and navigate hypertext that is meant for humans,” he said.</p>\n<figure><img src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/surflet.jpeg?w=680\" alt=\"An image showing Deta.Surf app's feature that lets you build an interactive experience through code using AI prompts. \" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/surflet.jpeg 1714w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/surflet.jpeg?resize=150,93 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/surflet.jpeg?resize=300,186 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/surflet.jpeg?resize=768,477 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/surflet.jpeg?resize=680,422 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/surflet.jpeg?resize=1200,745 1200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/surflet.jpeg?resize=1280,795 1280w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/surflet.jpeg?resize=430,267 430w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/surflet.jpeg?resize=720,447 720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/surflet.jpeg?resize=900,559 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/surflet.jpeg?resize=800,497 800w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/surflet.jpeg?resize=1536,954 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/surflet.jpeg?resize=668,415 668w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/surflet.jpeg?resize=604,375 604w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/surflet.jpeg?resize=994,617 994w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/surflet.jpeg?resize=708,440 708w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/surflet.jpeg?resize=50,31 50w\" /><figcaption><span><strong>Image Credits:</strong>Deta.Surf</span></figcaption></figure>\n<p>Eusterbrock added that the startup also thinks that an interface where you can’t edit anything is not a great design for human-machine interaction. </p>\n<p>While the product functions much like a browser, the startup thinks NotebookLM is a direct competitor. Eusterbrock believes that because Surf provides you with context with tabs and keeps the data locally to let you work offline on the notebooks, it’s a better-suited product for students and researchers.</p>\n<p>The company has made the tool available for free and is working on an image generation feature. Going forward, it may work toward a premium subscription that would include features like cloud backup, collaboration, and multi-device clients.</p>\n<p>In 2023, Deta raised $3.6 million in a seed round led by Crane Venture Partners with participation from System.One, Tomahawk.VC, Tiny.VC, Acequia Capital, Angel Invest, and NPHard.

    "body": "<div>\n<p>When Donnell Beverly Jr. decided to launch end-of-life planning startup <a href=\"https://eazewell.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Eazewell</a> after the loss of both of his parents, he knew exactly who to call to help launch the business: longtime friend, and nine-time NBA All-Star, Russell Westbrook.  </p>\n<p>“The main thesis with Russ across every business that he touches is how do we impact people?” Beverly Jr. [pictured above] told TechCrunch. “He’s been very vocal about that throughout his career. I always say we really took personal pain and then created a platform to really help people.” </p>\n<p>Westbrook was in. Four-time NBA All-Star Kemba Walker also joined, and the trio launched Eazewell.  </p>\n<p>Eazewell is an AI-driven platform that helps families navigate and automate the administrative aspects of end-of-life and funeral planning. The startup’s AI agent gives people a 24-hour, 7-day-a-week resource and helps users with everything from finding and booking a funeral home to canceling credit card accounts for a deceased person.  </p>\n<p>The company partners with different service providers, like hospice care, funeral homes, and various insurance companies, which allows the platform to be free to use with the option of paying for more premium features.  </p>\n<p>“I had an opportunity to be able to be close with his family and go through the process with [Beverly Jr.],” Westbrook told TechCrunch. “He’s done an amazing job of idealizing this idea and bringing it to life. I’m excited to kind of be a partner with him [and] alongside him on this.” </p>\n<p>Beverly Jr. said he got the idea for Eazewell after losing both of his parents in a short period of time. Navigating what came after their deaths made him realize how large of a burden the end-of-life process can be — and how fragmented the market of these services is.  </p>\n<div>\n\t\t<p>Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t<p><span>San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>October 27-29, 2025</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n<p>He added that seeing the recent advancements in AI made him realize the technology could be used to help reduce the number of administrative tasks grieving families need to tackle following a death.</p>\n<p>“We’ve seen how AI has impacted our lives while we’re here, but you know now we’re entering a space where it’s impacting our lives after death,” Beverly Jr. said.  </p>\n<p>Eazewell was founded in 2024. The company said it has been able to help more than 100,000 families since its launched its platform earlier this year.  </p>\n<p>Now, Eazewell is rolling out a new enterprise platform for hospice companies, senior living facilities, and life insurers. This allows companies to fold Eazewell’s automated features into their own management software.</p>\n<p>In the future, Eazwell hopes to help people manage a loved one’s digital assets after they pass, a task that has become a bigger undertaking as people’s lives are increasingly online.  </p>\n<p>“The average person has anywhere between 70 and 100 digital accounts that are active at any time,” Beverly Jr. said. “Your family is inheriting all those digital accounts and those digital assets as well. And that’s not typical. We’re stepping into a new kind of realm within that. When we look at the whole landscape, we see a grand opportunity to not only help people but just make it a lot more seamless.” </p>\n<p>For Westbrook, Eazewell offers the perfect opportunity to go into business with a decades-long friend while also being able to use his platform to amplify a business that can help people — especially those from underserved and under-resourced communities — navigate this painful and costly experience.  </p>\n<p>“Anytime I put my name on anything, I try to find ways to open doors, build trust, find ways to play a big role in it and be present because I think that’s important,” Westbrook said. “And this isn’t about me or being super technical by any means, but it’s more importantly about families finding ways to be able to help them through a loss. And for me, using my platform to be able to do that is a no-brainer.” </p>\n</div><div>\n<div>\n\t\t<p>Becca is a senior writer at TechCrunch that covers venture capital trends and startups.

    "body": "<div>\n<p>Einride, the Swedish startup known for its unusual-looking electric and autonomous pods that are designed to carry freight, said Wednesday it has raised $100 million from several new and existing investors, including its largest shareholder, EQT Ventures.</p>\n<p>The raise included an undisclosed strategic investment from quantum computing company IonQ. Neither Einride, nor its investors, disclosed the company’s post-money valuation.</p>\n<p>The funding comes as Einride adjusts <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/05/21/einride-founder-steps-down-as-ceo-amid-push-to-scale-electric-autonomous-trucks/\">to a new CEO</a> and tries to scale its three business products: electric big rigs, autonomous pod-like trucks that navigate fixed routes, and planning software designed for shippers. Einride CEO Roozbeh Charli said the funding would allow the company to grow with its customer base and accelerate the deployment of its autonomous freight technology.</p>\n<p>The company, which was founded in 2016, started in Sweden with a mission to disrupt the freight industry — first with electric trucks, then with electric autonomous pods, which are purpose-built without a steering wheel or pedals for self-driving. </p>\n<p>Einride has expanded beyond Sweden and operates a fleet of heavy-duty electric trucks in Europe, North America, and the UAE, for companies like PepsiCo, Carlsberg Sweden, and DP World. The company has made some inroads with its autonomous pod-like trucks with customers Apotea in Sweden and GE Appliances in the United States.</p>\n<p>“We believe Einride is building the most complete and forward-looking freight ecosystem on the market today,” Ted Persson, partner at EQT Ventures, said in a statement. “Nordic tech has a habit of being underestimated, until it quietly rewires an entire industry. That’s exactly what Einride is doing in freight.”</p>\n<p>Still, Einride has undergone internal changes and has grappled — along with the rest of the nascent autonomous vehicle technology sector — with the long and expensive process of moving from development to commercial operations.</p>\n<div>\n\t\t<p>Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t<p><span>San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>October 27-29, 2025</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n<p>Five months ago, Einride co-founder Robert Falck left the CEO role and took over as executive chairman of the board to focus on the company’s long-term strategy. Charli, who had been CFO, was promoted to the top leadership position.</p>\n<p>The company previously <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2022/12/07/autonomous-electric-truck-company-einride-raises-500m-in-equity-and-debt/\">raised $500 million</a> in 2022 in a Series C round of equity and debt.

    "body": "<div>\n<p>Sheel Mohnot, co-founder and general partner of Better Tomorrow Ventures (BTV), has one simple answer for anyone claiming that investing in fintech has lost some of its attractiveness.</p>\n<p>“The world of finance is huge. About 20% of global GDP is financial services, and it’s still not digital enough,” he told TechCrunch.</p>\n<p>Many financial transactions are still handled manually, and Better Tomorrow Ventures — led by Mohnot (a former general partner at 500 Startups) and NerdWallet co-founder Jake Gibson — aims to help change that.</p>\n<p>“The massive digitization opportunity is still ahead of us,” Mohnot told TechCrunch. The firm’s limited partners seem to agree.</p>\n<p>Better Tomorrow Ventures just raised a $140 million third fund, nearly matching the <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2022/02/15/better-tomorrow-ventures-closes-on-225m-fintech-focused-fund-which-is-triple-the-size-of-its-last-fund/\" target=\"_blank\">$150 million</a> second fund, which was announced in early 2022 toward the end of the ZIRP (zero interest-rate policy) boom.</p>\n<p>“We actually planned to make the fund smaller this time,” Mohnot said. “In 2021, things went super overboard. Every company we invested in immediately raised a follow-on round at a crazy price, and that was probably bad,” Mohnot said.</p>\n<p>Now that the enthusiasm for fintech is tamer, BTV doesn’t need as much capital to continue to participate in its best startups, he explained.</p>\n<div>\n\t\t<p>Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t<p><span>San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>October 27-29, 2025</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n<p>The firm also didn’t tap into the $75 million opportunity fund raised alongside its second fund in 2022. But that capital may come in handy at some point soon. Since many of the recent and planned IPOs are in the fintech space, including Chime, Klarna, Navan, and Wealthfront, there’s hope that late-stage investors will become more excited about the category.</p>\n<p>At the early stages, fintech investing has certainly picked up over the last year.

    "body": "<div>\n<p>Last month, Gusto, a payroll and HR software company, announced that it <a href=\"https://www.guideline.com/education/articles/guideline-gusto-acquisition-agreement\" target=\"_blank\">agreed to acquire</a> Guideline, a startup offering retirement plans to small and medium businesses.  </p>\n<p>The terms of the deal weren’t disclosed, but Gusto paid approximately $600 million, according to a source familiar with the deal, although TechCrunch could not confirm how much of this was cash and how much was stock. </p>\n<p>Guideline was last valued at <a href=\"https://www.felicis.com/insight/guideline-raises-200m-and-is-said-to-be-valued-at-1-15-billion\" target=\"_blank\">$1.15 billion</a> in 2021 when it raised a <a href=\"https://www.guideline.com/education/articles/announcing-our-200-million-series-e\" target=\"_blank\">$200 million Series D</a> funding round. Since its founding in 2015, it has raised a total of $340 million. While the acquisition price is below the startup’s private valuation, the company’s early-stage investors, including Felicis, Tiger Global, and NEA, will likely realize a return. General Atlantic, which led the company’s Series D, is expected to earn a small profit on its investment, too, sources say. </p>\n<p>Founded by former Taskrabbit co-founder Kevin Busque (pictured above), Guideline helps small and medium-sized businesses easily set up and manage 401(k) plans. It charges a flat, per-employee fee instead of the traditional model of charging a percentage of assets under management. CNBC reported that Guideline’s annualized recurring revenue (ARR), a metric that measures predictable yearly income from subscriptions, was <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2025/08/27/gusto-retirement-guideline-deal.html\" target=\"_blank\">$140 million</a> as of this past January. </p>\n<p>Gusto, which was founded in 2011 and is valued at $9.3 billion, has been offering 401(k) retirement plans to its customers through a partnership with Guideline since 2015. But Guideline’s relationship with Gusto isn’t exclusive. Customers can also set up Guideline retirement plans through other payroll providers like ADP, Intuit, Paylocity, TriNet, and Rippling. </p>\n<p>According to three sources familiar with the transaction, Gusto is looking to sell off Guideline’s accounts associated with rival payroll companies. The proceeds from those sales will be shared among Gusto and Guideline shareholders, said one person familiar with the deal, potentially increasing returns for investors even more. </p>\n<p>Gusto declined to comment on the deal price and its divestment plans.  </p>\n<div>\n\t\t<p>Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t<p><span>San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>October 27-29, 2025</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n<p>Guideline’s spokesperson characterized the $600 million price tag as incorrect without offering more information, and said the company has no plans to part ways with any of its customers as part of its sale to Gusto. </p>\n<p>While this appears to be a profitable transaction for Guideline’s shareholders, the company’s rationale for selling remains unclear. The company has been profitable for over a year, the company’s spokesperson confirmed. However, it faces plenty of competition, such as from <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/04/human-interest-raises-200m-at-a-1b-valuation-plans-for-an-ipo/\">Human Interest</a>, its closest rival, which is backed by SoftBank and Baillie Gifford. Human Interest grew 70% last year and is expected to be profitable by the end of the year, the company’s co-founder and CEO Jeff Schneble told TechCrunch. Human Interest is in talks to raise $200 million at a $3 billion valuation, doubling its valuation from a year ago, The Information <a href=\"https://www.theinformation.com/articles/retirement-startup-human-interest-talks-fundraising-3-billion-valuation?rc=em6blq\" target=\"_blank\">reported</a>.

    "body": "<div>\n<p>On Tuesday, a new SPAC from VC and All-In podcast host Chamath Palihapitiya <a href=\"https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/AEXA/\" target=\"_blank\">became a public company</a>. Dubbed with the lofty name “American Exceptionalism,” it raised $345 million with a mission to acquire one or more startups in the fields of energy, AI, crypto/DeFi, or defense, then convert those companies into publicly traded entities.</p>\n<p>But Palihapitiya wants retail investors to know: He strongly advises you <em>not</em> to buy the stock, even though he has reserved a tiny fraction — just over 1% — to be traded on the public markets for retailer investors, while 98.7% has already been sold to hand-picked, large institutions.</p>\n<p>“I want to temper retail investors’ involvement with my SPACs,” he <a href=\"https://x.com/chamath/status/1972776673495097456\" target=\"_blank\">posted</a> on X and later <a href=\"https://x.com/chamath/status/1972776673495097456\" target=\"_blank\">posted</a> again, “We designed it this way, almost entirely institutionally backed, because, as I have learned, these vehicles are not ideal for most retail investors. They are for investors who can underwrite the volatility, place it as part of a broader structured portfolio and have the capital to support the company over the long run.”</p>\n<p>It isn’t typical for someone to launch an IPO and then tell people not to buy the stock. He even goes as far as to give a buyer-beware warning to any retail investor (like among fans of the uber-popular All-In pod) who wants to ignore his recommendation and buy anyway. “For anyone in the retail market who still chooses to disregard my advice to avoid SPACs, please carefully review our disclosures and make a fully informed decision.”</p>\n<p>The reason for these warnings is somewhat entertaining. Palihapitiya practically single-handedly sparked the rise of SPACs from 2019 to 2021, granting him the title of “SPAC King.” This came after his first SPAC, Social Capital Hedosophia Holdings (IPOA), raised $600 million and took Virgin Galactic public in 2019. (It now trades for under $4, by the way.) SPACs took off, seen as a fast-track to going public during the venture capital valuation bubble.</p>\n<p>But, within a few years, the numbers showed that while SPACs might be lucrative for the SPACs’ sponsors like Palihapitiya and sometimes for the acquired startup, they rarely made investors money. Or as the <a href=\"https://www.yalejreg.com/bulletin/was-the-spac-crash-predictable/\" target=\"_blank\">Yale Journal on Regulation</a> put it: “SPACs have delivered poor post-merger returns to shareholders for many years.”</p>\n<p>Goldman Sachs even banned itself from underwriting them for three years. In June, it ditched that ban and began working with SPACs again, prompting Palihapitiya to post a poll on X asking, “Should I launch a SPAC?”</p>\n<div>\n\t\t<p>Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t<p><span>San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>October 27-29, 2025</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n<p>Nearly 58,000 people voted and <a href=\"https://x.com/chamath/status/1935369326321877153\" target=\"_blank\">overwhelmingly voted no (71%)</a>. That’s because Palihapitiya’s track record was no better. In June, MarketWatch <a href=\"https://www.marketwatch.com/story/the-so-called-spac-king-prepares-to-launch-another-the-last-time-wasnt-a-success-by-any-means-0426b24b\" target=\"_blank\">compiled</a> records of the abysmal performance of nearly all of his SPACs, showing many were down over 90% from their launch date.</p>\n<p>When launching this new SPAC this week, Palihapitiya still argued that SPACs are good for the startups, as well as their employees and early investor VCs.</p>\n<p>“The reason to return now is simple. The imbalance between private and public markets has only widened,” he wrote on X, citing the even larger number of unicorns today than in 2019. “Employees are often holding paper wealth that is difficult to convert into liquidity. Early investors find it more challenging to reinvest capital in the next generation of startups.”</p>\n<p>But he also acknowledged that “it hasn’t been all roses.” Hence the warning to retail investors. (Social Capital declined to comment further.)</p>\n<p>He says he’s trying to address some of the worst criticisms: that SPACs enrich the vehicle’s sponsors at the expense of everyone else.</p>\n<p>With “American Exceptionalism,” he says he has structured payouts so that the sponsors’ tranches of stock won’t vest until stock prices hit 50%, 75%, and 100% increases. “If the deal is a dog, no one wins. If it is a winner, we will all win … together,” he wrote.</p>\n<p>The question remains though: With all that we know in 2025, should a startup choose to go public via SPAC, be it through Palihapitiya’s or any SPAC? History would indicate: probably not, if they want their stock to perform well long term.</p>\n</div>"

    "body": "<div>\n<p>Iman Clark, CEO of Prickly Pear Health, says she had an epiphany that eventually led her to TechCrunch’s <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/startup-battlefield/\">Startup Battlefield</a> at <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-disrupt-2025?promo=postinclusion_sb200startup&utm_campaign=disrupt2025&utm_content=ticketsales&utm_medium=post&utm_source=tc\">TechCrunch Disrupt 2025</a>.  </p>\n<p>It was around nine years ago. She moved from Tunisia to the U.S. for grad school, then joined a company that created gamified experiences for people with neurodegenerative conditions, like dementia. This was done by giving them a tablet or a computer and letting them play games while doctors collected data on them, like their risk of falling and overall range of motion.  </p>\n<p>“I realized that most people, 75-plus, have two to three chronic conditions, and no matter what we did, it is always going to be hard,” she told TechCrunch. “Then I went back to the research and saw that like, 70% of the Alzheimer’s population are women.”</p>\n<p>She dug deeper and found that women were twice as likely to be diagnosed with depression and anxiety, and three to four times more likely to be diagnosed with migraines. “That’s when I realized we are not really solving for women’s biology, and that is costing us lives and dollars.”</p>\n<p>So she created Prickly Pear Health, which provides medical support for women’s brain health, a voice-first, AI-powered companion that helps women in their 30s to 50s navigate the hormonal changes that affect brain health. The product lets people record quick reflections throughout the day using their voice and Prickly Pear’s AI technology analyzes their language and context to track any cognitive changes.</p>\n<p>Prickly Pear Health will show of its tech at <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-disrupt-2025?promo=postinclusion_sb200startup&utm_campaign=disrupt2025&utm_content=ticketsales&utm_medium=post&utm_source=tc\">TechCrunch Disrupt</a>, which runs October 27 to 29 in San Francisco. </p>\n<p>It also pulls in sleep data, heart rate activity, and other metrics from trackers like Apple Health, Oura, and Garmin to help offer personalized insights on how they can take better care of their health.</p>\n<div>\n\t\t<p>Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t<p><span>San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>October 27-29, 2025</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n<p>Clark said there is a collective agreement that women’s health is a space ripe for innovation, and that women want to be founders, want to be top voices, and are tired of being in the back seats of their own lives. </p>\n<p>Clark officially launched a free version of her product in May and is gearing up to launch the premium offering in October, for Mental Health Awareness Month and Menopause Awareness Month. </p>\n<p>She started doing focus groups at Arizona State University and found that women in their late 30s to early 50s were reporting a lot of brain fog and mental fatigue, but it often took them until their 60s to realize it had to do with hormonal fluctuations, menopause, or even an onset of something deeper. It was here that Clark realized she wanted to focus on this age range. </p>\n<p>“They’re often dismissed or misdiagnosed when symptoms like brain fog, mood shifts, or irregular cycles first appear,” she said of women in their 30s to 50s, adding that these midlife years are critical to brain health, but traditional care is failing to connect the dots. </p>\n<p>“We’re addressing that gap. Helping women recognize and act on early signals before they escalate into more serious health challenges later,” she said. </p>\n<p>Arizona is also where the inspiration for the company’s name came from. She became fascinated with the cacti, how they stand despite the heat and produce healthy fruit. “That’s when Prickly Pear came to life because that’s the fruit that grows in the cactus tree, and it was an inspiration of thriving in harsh conditions and joyful resilience,” she said. </p>\n<p>She considers competitors in her same field to be existing menopause apps, which, she said, are more like symptom trackers. “We believe it’s important to understand symptoms, but we believe that those approaches are reactive approaches, while for us, we are there to be able to detect things.” </p>\n<p>She raised a $350,000 pre-seed round and said it was “really hard,” especially as a woman of color. “We had to be so good that you cannot be ignored,” she said. She sought to build relationships with investors before starting her pre-seed, which, she said, really helped when it came time for the ask. “That’s a popular thing we say: ‘Ask for advice and you get business, ask for business and you get advice sometimes,’” she said. </p>\n<p>Some advice she received was to apply for Startup Battlefield, with friends telling her to be loud and proud about being part of the latest startups to pitch during the competition. </p>\n<p>“Disrupt is the ultimate stage for new ideas,” she said. She’s excited to spotlight women’s brain health, learn from other founders, and, of course, “connect with investors and partners who believe, like we do, that women’s health innovation is not niche, it’s the future of healthcare.” </p>\n<p><em>If you want to learn from Prickly Pear firsthand, and see dozens of additional pitches, valuable workshops, and make the connections that drive business results, </em><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-disrupt-2025/tickets/?promo=postinclusion_sb200startup&utm_campaign=disrupt2025&utm_content=ticketsales&utm_medium=post&utm_source=tc\"><em>head here to learn more about this year’s Disrupt</em></a><em>, held October 27 to 29 in San Francisco.</em></p>\n<figure><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-disrupt-2025/tickets/?promo=postinclusion_sb200startup&utm_campaign=disrupt2025&utm_content=ticketsales&utm_medium=post&utm_source=tc\"><img src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/TC25_Disrupt_General_Article_No-Anniversary_Headers_1920x1080.png?w=680\" alt=\"TechCrunch Disrupt 2025\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/TC25_Disrupt_General_Article_No-Anniversary_Headers_1920x1080.png 1920w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/TC25_Disrupt_General_Article_No-Anniversary_Headers_1920x1080.png?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/TC25_Disrupt_General_Article_No-Anniversary_Headers_1920x1080.png?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/TC25_Disrupt_General_Article_No-Anniversary_Headers_1920x1080.png?resize=768,432 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/TC25_Disrupt_General_Article_No-Anniversary_Headers_1920x1080.png?resize=680,383 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/TC25_Disrupt_General_Article_No-Anniversary_Headers_1920x1080.png?resize=1200,675 1200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/TC25_Disrupt_General_Article_No-Anniversary_Headers_1920x1080.png?resize=1280,720 1280w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/TC25_Disrupt_General_Article_No-Anniversary_Headers_1920x1080.png?resize=430,242 430w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/TC25_Disrupt_General_Article_No-Anniversary_Headers_1920x1080.png?resize=720,405 720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/TC25_Disrupt_General_Article_No-Anniversary_Headers_1920x1080.png?resize=900,506 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/TC25_Disrupt_General_Article_No-Anniversary_Headers_1920x1080.png?resize=800,450 800w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/TC25_Disrupt_General_Article_No-Anniversary_Headers_1920x1080.png?resize=1536,864 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/TC25_Disrupt_General_Article_No-Anniversary_Headers_1920x1080.png?resize=668,375 668w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/TC25_Disrupt_General_Article_No-Anniversary_Headers_1920x1080.png?resize=1097,617 1097w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/TC25_Disrupt_General_Article_No-Anniversary_Headers_1920x1080.png?resize=708,398 708w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/TC25_Disrupt_General_Article_No-Anniversary_Headers_1920x1080.png?resize=50,28 50w\" /></a></figure>\n</div>"
