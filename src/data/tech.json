A Zoox spokesperson confirmed that it has submitted a petition for a “555 exemption” and continues to work closely with the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration through this new exemption process. </p>\n<p>An NHTSA spokesperson told TechCrunch that Zoox applied for a temporary exemption from eight Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standards applicable to its passenger car equipped with an automated driving system. The NHTSA is reviewing Zoox’s application and will publish a notice seeking public comment after the agency conducts its initial review.</p>\n<p>The request follows two milestones that put Zoox closer to operating a commercial robotaxi service.</p>\n<p>Earlier this month, Zoox launched a <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/09/10/zoox-opens-its-las-vegas-robotaxi-service-to-the-public/\">free robotaxi service</a> that is open to the public in Las Vegas. And in August, the NHTSA gave <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/08/06/federal-regulators-give-zoox-an-exemption-for-its-custom-built-robotaxis/\">Zoox an exemption</a> to demonstrate its custom-built robotaxis on public roads.</p>\n<p>While the August exemption cleared up a long-standing debate over whether Zoox’s custom-built autonomous vehicles complied with federal motor vehicle safety standards, it only covered research and demonstrations on public roads. This latest application is separate and would broaden the scope and pave the way for Zoox to launch a commercial robotaxi service.</p>\n<p>The NHTSA’s exemption in August was part of the agency’s expanded Automated Vehicle Exemption Program, which allows for demonstration of its vehicles on public roads.</p>\n<div>\n\t\t<p>Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t<p><span>San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>October 27-29, 2025</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n<div>\n\t<p>Topics</p>\n</div>\n</div><div><div>\n\t<div>\n\t\t<p>Subscribe for the industry’s biggest tech news</p>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n<p></p><h2 id=\"h-latest-in\">Latest in Transportation</h2><p></p>\n</div>"

That computing load has grown particularly intense with the rise of agentic and reasoning models, which require multiple steps in response to a single command.</p>\n<p>First launched as a computer vision service, Clarifai has grown increasingly focused on compute orchestration as the AI boom has drastically increased demand for both GPUs and the data centers that house them. The company first announced <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/12/03/clarifai-introduces-vendor-agnostic-orchestration-capabilities/\">its compute platform at AWS re:Invent in December</a>, but the new reasoning engine is the first product specifically tailored for multi-step agentic models.</p>\n<p>The product comes amid intense pressure on AI infrastructure, which has spurred <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/09/22/the-billion-dollar-infrastructure-deals-powering-the-ai-boom/\">a string of billion-dollar deals</a>. OpenAI has laid out plans for as much as <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.wsj.com/tech/openai-unveils-plans-for-seemingly-limitless-expansion-of-computing-power-d0b39b9b\">$1 trillion in new data center spending</a>, projecting nearly limitless future demand for compute. But while the hardware buildout has been intense, Clarifai’s CEO believes there is more to be done in optimizing the infrastructure we already have.</p>\n<p>“There’s software tricks that take a good model like this further, like the Clarifai reasoning engine,” Zeiler says, “but there’s also algorithm improvements that can help combat the need for gigawatt data centers. And I don’t think we’re at the end of the algorithm innovations.”</p>\n</div>\n\t\t\t<div>\n\t<p>Topics</p>\n</div>\n<div>\n<div>\n\t<p>\n\t\tRussell Brandom has been covering the tech industry since 2012, with a focus on platform policy and emerging technologies.

    "body": "<div>\n<p>Databricks said on Thursday that it is incorporating OpenAI’s models, including GPT-5, into its data platform as well as its AI product, Agent Bricks, as part of a $100 million multi-year deal that bets on the AI company’s ability to bring in enterprise customers.</p>\n<p>The deal highlights the accelerating race to bring generative AI into the enterprise stack, as companies foresee demand for AI tools that can tap into corporate data securely.</p>\n<p>Agent Bricks lets organizations build AI apps and agents on top of their enterprise data using a range of AI models. OpenAI’s latest models are now part of that menu — accessible in SQL or via API — and GPT-5 is being offered as a flagship model for Databricks customers.  </p>\n<p>The news comes nearly two months after Databricks added OpenAI’s <a href=\"https://www.databricks.com/blog/introducing-openais-new-open-models-databricks\" target=\"_blank\">open-weight models</a>, gpt-oss 20B and gpt-oss 120B, to the platform. Agent Bricks can now measure how accurately the different models perform on specific tasks and fine-tunes accordingly to produce more tailored results.</p>\n<p>“Our partnership with Databricks brings our most advanced models to where secure enterprise data already lives, making it easier for businesses to experiment, deploy, and scale AI agents with real impact,” Brad Lightcap, chief operating officer of OpenAI, said in a statement.  </p>\n<p>With this deal, Databricks is betting that enterprise customers will flock to OpenAI’s models. Under the terms, the company is on the hook to pay<em> </em>a minimum of $100 million to OpenAI whether or not the AI firm’s models generate that much in revenue over the life of the deal. </p>\n<p>Neither company disclosed how long the agreement will run. If revenue ends up exceeding $100 million, OpenAI will earn more, but if it falls short, Databricks will have to pay the full amount anyway. For Databricks, it means potential downside risk; for OpenAI, it means predictable income at a time when the company is trying to rapidly <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/09/23/openai-is-building-five-new-stargate-data-centers-with-oracle-and-softbank/\" target=\"_blank\">build out more data centers.</a>  </p>\n<div>\n\t\t<p>Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t<p><span>San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>October 27-29, 2025</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n<p>The deal is similar to the one <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/anthropic-databricks-team-up-in-scramble-for-ai-revenue-e15fe750\">Databricks reached with Anthropic</a> earlier this year, setting a revenue target of $100 million over five years.</p>\n<p>A Databricks spokesperson told TechCrunch that the firm has already seen overwhelming demand from customers, including Mastercard, for native access to OpenAI’s models on the platform.</p>\n</div><div>\n<div>\n\t\t<p>Rebecca Bellan is a senior reporter at TechCrunch where she covers the business, policy, and emerging trends shaping artificial intelligence.

Now when you see an end screen, you can tap a new “Hide” button in the top-right corner of the video player to hide the pop-ups from the current video you’re watching.</p>\n<p>Selecting this button will only hide end screens for the current video you’re watching, not for all videos on the platform, the company notes. If you want to bring the end screen back, you can tap the Show button.</p>\n<p>The decision to let users hide end screens is a welcome addition to the platform, especially since they can end up covering the last bit of a video and make it hard to see what’s happening in some cases.</p>\n<p>The company also announced that it’s removing the Subscribe button that appears when you hover your cursor over a video’s branded watermark. YouTube explains that it’s doing so because there’s already a Subscribe button directly below the video player.</p>\n<p>YouTube says it’s launching the new features in response to user feedback, as many people said they wanted the option to minimize distractions on videos and for it to be easier to focus on the content they’re currently watching. </p>\n<p>As for creators, YouTube notes that they still have the option to add end screens to videos. The company expects these changes to have a minimal impact on creators’ performance and view count on the platform. </p>\n<p>For instance, YouTube found in an experiment that giving users the option to hide end screens resulted in a less than 1.5% decrease in views from end screens. Plus, it found that less than ~0.05% of all Channel subscriptions come from the hover-to-subscribe functionality on the video watermark. </p>\n<div>\n\t\t<p>Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t<p><span>San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>October 27-29, 2025</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\t\t\t<div>\n\t<p>Topics</p>\n</div>\n<div>\n<div>\n\t\t<p>Aisha is a consumer news reporter at TechCrunch.

    "body": "<div>\n<p>Ask <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://starpath.space/\">Starpath</a> CEO Saurav Shroff his thoughts on America’s space priorities and he’ll say we’re “one order of magnitude high on cost and one order of magnitude low on ambition.” </p>\n<p>Starpath’s answer, at least to part of the problem, is ultra-low cost space power, which is generated by solar panels.</p>\n<p>Starpath’s new space-rated solar panel business kicked off sales in the U.S. on September 25 with an eyebrow-raising pitch. The company says its solar panels, called “Starlight,” are priced around 10 times cheaper than typical industry pricing of $7-250 per watt, roughly a 90% cost reduction versus the status quo.</p>\n<p>There will be two product tiers at launch, an “engineering model” and a “flight model.” The engineering model is priced at $9.81 per watt, with shipping beginning the second week of October. This model goes through a streamlined testing process, but is not flight-rated, making it suited for prototyping, lab use, and building a satellite ahead of launch, a Starpath representative said.</p>\n<p>The flight model, designed for in-space use, is $11.20 per watt and is slated to ship in the fourth quarter of this year.</p>\n<p>The startup says the steep cost reduction comes in part from building its own automated production line.</p>\n<p>That production process – details of which Starpath is largely keeping private – is designed to dramatically increase throughput. By next year, the startup claims its line could produce more than the rest of the world’s supply of space-rated solar power combined, with enough capacity to service every satellite made on Earth.</p>\n<div>\n\t\t<p>Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t<p><span>San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>October 27-29, 2025</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n<p>“It’s a win for humanity if our solar panels are available commercially for the entire space industry at a price that is 90% cheaper than what you can get today,” Shroff said. Panels “won’t be made to order … they’ll be stocked.” Shipping times will be as short as three weeks to the customer’s door initially, and just three days from December onward. It’s a dramatic reduction from today’s five- to 14-month lead times, Starpath says.</p>\n<p>The new product line grew out of Starpath’s broader ambition: <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/08/20/starpath-accelerates-moon-water-mining-plans-with-12m-seed-funding/\">to terraform the solar system, starting with the moon and Mars.</a> When the team priced power for a serious lunar base, “the current solar solutions were not economically viable,” Shroff said. “You’d literally be looking at spending more than the GDP of the entire world on solar power” to scale today’s satellite-supply-chain economics.</p>\n<p>“The economics sort of kind of work for the satellite industry,” he said. “They’re very expensive, but they do not work for building a city on Mars.”</p>\n<p>That prompted Starpath to design its own product and process. Shroff says the low prices mean “for a multi-million-dollar satellite … it will only cost you $100,000 to get the power system.”</p>\n<p>Starpath’s roadmap is aggressive. Shroff said the underlying production system is designed to rapidly scale.  “If demand called for it,” the company could scale to upwards of 40 gigawatts “within a year,” he said.</p>\n<p>Without naming names, Shroff said companies are interested in building applications for low Earth orbit that require a lot of power.</p>\n<p>Selling panels, he argued, doesn’t distract from Starpath’s core mission. Instead, it monetizes a capability the company had to build anyway. Shroff pointed out that Starpath will be the consumer of around 98% of its own output, using the vast majority of its own panels for its off-world infrastructure.</p>\n<p>“We think that people should dream bigger,” he said. “Everybody should take a careful look, particularly NASA, at their goals, and ask themselves if they’re dreaming big enough.”</p>\n</div><div>\n<div>\n\t\t<p>Aria Alamalhodaei covers the space and defense industries at TechCrunch.

    "body": "<div>\n<p>On Wednesday, Enterprise AI model maker Cohere said it raised an additional $100 million — bumping its valuation to $7 billion — in an extension to a round announced in August. The August round was an <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/08/14/cohere-hits-a-6-8b-valuation-as-investors-amd-nvidia-and-salesforce-double-down/\">oversubscribed $500 million round</a> at a $6.8 billion valuation, the company said at the time.</p>\n<p>Cohere also announced an interesting twist on a partnership. While competitor OpenAI <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/09/22/nvidia-plans-to-invest-up-to-100b-in-openai/\">just nabbed an up-to $100 billion investment</a> from the biggest GPU player, Nvidia, Cohere <a href=\"https://cohere.com/blog/september-2025-funding-round\" target=\"_blank\">has signed a dea</a>l with AMD, which is one of its investors.</p>\n<p>The company’s full suite of Command-family AI models, including the Command vision, translate, and reasoning models, can now run on AMD’s Instinct GPU, an Nvidia GPU competitor. Moreover, AMD will be using Cohere internally as a customer. Cohere is not, however, abandoning support of Nvidia GPUs to strictly support AMD, the company tells TechCrunch.</p>\n<p>Cohere began as a front-runner in the AI model race. It was co-founded in 2019 by Aidan Gomez, one of the authors of the “<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attention_Is_All_You_Need\" target=\"_blank\">transformer</a>” paper that gave rise to the modern generative AI boom.</p>\n<p>But, while a zero-to-$7 billion valuation in six years would have been awe-inspiring a decade ago, Cohere has since been overshadowed by the blindingly fast rise of OpenAI and its closest competitor Anthropic. OpenAI, for instance, was <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2025/08/15/openai-6-billion-stock-500-billion-valuation.html\" target=\"_blank\">reportedly valued at $500 billion</a> last month while Anthropic <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/09/02/anthropic-raises-13b-series-f-at-183b-valuation/\">hit a $183 billion valuation</a> early this month.</p>\n<p>Cohere, which has always focused on the enterprise market, is now marketing itself to enterprises where AI sovereignty is urgent — that is, keeping local control of the data and models, rather than putting them in the hands of a foreign entity. To that end, Business Development Bank of Canada (BDC) and <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.nexxuscapital.net/\">Nexxus Capital Management</a> (known for its Singapore network) were new investors in this fresh $100 million round, Cohere says.</p>\n<p><em>Correction: This story has been updated to reflect the international association of investor Nexxus. </em></p>\n<div>\n\t\t<p>Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t<p><span>San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>October 27-29, 2025</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>"

    "body": "<div>\n<p>Hardware startup Nothing said Thursday that it plans to make its affordable device brand, CMF, into an independent subsidiary with India serving as its headquarters for manufacturing and R&D.</p>\n<p>The company first launched CMF in 2023 with <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2023/08/03/nothing-will-launch-earbuds-and-a-smartwatch-under-its-new-budget-line-cmf/\">a pair of earbuds and a </a>smartwatch. Since then, it has introduced smartphones under the brand as well.</p>\n<p>Nothing said that it is partnering with Indian ODM (Original Design Manufacturer) Optiemus to create a joint venture for manufacturing. While the startup didn’t reveal the ownership structure of this venture, it said that it aims to invest more than $100 million over the next three years, while creating over 1,800 jobs.</p>\n<p>The London-based startup, following its <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/09/15/nothing-closes-200m-series-c-led-by-tiger-global-plans-ai-first-device-launch/\">$200 million funding round led by Tiger Global,</a> didn’t say how much money from this round will go into setting up this new venture.</p>\n<p>Nothing’s decision to choose India as CMF’s operational headquarters makes sense for a few reasons. CMF’s smartphones have been priced under $200, and that is the dominant category in India, with over 42% of phones shipped in Q2 2025 being in the $100-$200 price range,<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://my.idc.com/getdoc.jsp?containerId=prAP53737525\"> according to IDC</a>.</p>\n<p>India has also been Nothing’s strongest market with over 2% market share in smartphones. IDC told TechCrunch via email that Nothing was the fastest-growing brand in the country in Q2 2025, with 85% growth in shipments year over year.</p>\n<p>“India will play a key role in shaping the future of the global smartphone industry. CMF has been well-received by the market since we launched it two years ago. With our end-to-end capabilities, we are uniquely positioned to now build it into India’s first truly global smartphone brand. Our joint venture with Optiemus is a key milestone toward making that vision a reality,” Nothing’s CEO Carl Pei said in a statement. </p>\n<div>\n\t\t<p>Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t<p><span>San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>October 27-29, 2025</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n<p>The company’s move comes after it poached Himanshu Tondon from <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://brandequity.economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/the-people-report/nothing-appoints-himanshu-tandon-as-vice-president-of-business-of-its-sub-brand-cmf/123560056\">Xiaomi’s spin-off brand POCO</a> last month to be VP of Business for CMF. </p>\n<p>Brand spin-offs have been increasingly common in the last decade, especially for brands based in China.

    "body": "<div>\n<p>For decades, Silicon Valley has valorized the college dropout. Founders like Bill Gates, Steve Jobs, and Mark Zuckerberg left school early to build companies and they became billionaires. </p>\n<p>That ethos was later institutionalized through initiatives like the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://thielfellowship.org/\">Thiel Fellowship</a>, which famously pays promising students $200,000 to leave college and start companies.</p>\n<p>For many years, the famed accelerator Y Combinator also quietly reinforced that culture. While it never explicitly required students to drop out, many of its most successful alumni, including Dropbox’s Drew Houston, Reddit’s Steve Huffman, and Stripe’s John and Patrick Collison, joined the program young and left school behind to build their companies.</p>\n<p>Now YC is changing that narrative.</p>\n<p>The accelerator has introduced a new application track called Early Decision, designed for students who want to start companies but don’t want to drop out. The program allows them to apply while still in school, get accepted and funded immediately, and defer their participation in YC until after they graduate. </p>\n<p>For example, a student applying in fall 2025 could graduate in spring 2026, then participate in YC’s Summer 2026 batch.</p>\n<p>“It’s designed for graduating seniors who want to do a startup but also want to finish school first,” said YC managing partner Jared Friedman in the launch video. </p>\n<div>\n\t\t<p>Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t<p><span>San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>October 27-29, 2025</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n<p>Friedman added that the idea for Early Decision came from conversations with students. “Between AI Startup School last summer and the more than 20 university trips we’ve done over the past year, we’ve had a lot of opportunities to do that. One of YC’s most common pieces of advice is to ‘talk to your users,’ and we follow it ourselves,” he told TechCrunch over email. </p>\n<p>In Silicon Valley culture, dropping out has been almost a rite of passage for aspiring founders Programs like the Thiel Fellowship have turned it into a movement (though it’s worth noting that Peter Thiel himself did not drop out but earned both undergraduate and law degrees from Stanford). </p>\n<p>It’s why YC’s announcement is a meaningful break from that mythos that leaving school early is the optimal, or only, path to startup success. The timing is also significant, coming at a time when more young people are questioning both the cost of college and the trade-offs of staying in school. </p>\n<p>The new program also reflects a growing maturity in how YC thinks about long-term founder outcomes.</p>\n<p>The accelerator has long been a magnet for college-aged builders. Founders of Loom, Instacart, Rappi, and Brex were in their teens or early twenties when they joined the program. But the decision to drop out was often implicit: Do the program now or miss the opportunity.</p>\n<p>Early Decision removes that pressure, offering a middle ground between academic completion and chasing entrepreneurship. The move could broaden YC’s applicant pool to include more cautious, deliberate student founders who are committed to startup life but unwilling to sacrifice education to get there.</p>\n<figure></figure>\n<p>In its <a href=\"https://www.ycombinator.com/early-decision\" target=\"_blank\">announcement</a>, YC highlights Sneha Sivakumar and Anushka Nijhawan, the co-founders of Spur, as a success story from this approach. Spur builds AI-powered quality-assurance testing tools, and the duo applied to YC through Early Decision in fall 2023 while still in school. They graduated in May 2024, joined the Summer 2024 YC batch and have since raised $4.5 million. </p>\n<p>YC notes that the program is open to both graduating students and those earlier in their academic journey. It’s a bet that some of the best founders of the next decade won’t need to choose between college and startups. They’ll do both. </p>\n<p>The move also helps YC secure talent early in an increasingly competitive accelerator and seed funding landscape, giving students an option that competes with other programs like Thiel Fellowship, Neo Scholars, Founders Inc, as well as Big Tech internships and grad school pipelines.</p>\n</div><div>\n<div>\n\t\t<p>Tage Kene-Okafor is a reporter at TechCrunch based in Lagos, Nigeria, covering the intersection of startups and venture capital in Africa.

    "description": "Apple is blaming the EU's enforcement of the DMA for delaying the launch of some features in the EU, saying the rules are \"leading to a worse experience\" for Apple customers in the bloc by exposing them to new risks and reducing choices.",
    "body": "<div>\n<p>Since it came into effect three years ago, the European Union’s Digital Markets Act (DMA) has sought to rein in major tech platforms’ anti-competitive behavior, largely by making it easier for users to switch platforms and move data between devices and apps.</p>\n<p>Big tech hasn’t been happy with that, of course, and now Apple’s come out swinging against the regulation. The company on Thursday <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2025/09/the-digital-markets-acts-impacts-on-eu-users/\">blamed</a> the EU’s enforcement of the DMA for delaying the launch of some features in the EU, saying the rules are “leading to a worse experience” for Apple customers in the bloc by exposing them to new risks and reducing choices.</p>\n<p>The iPhone maker also called on the European Commission to repeal the DMA until “a more appropriate fit for purpose legislative instrument is put in place,” the Financial Times <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/882322ef-a734-4fea-83d7-f112dc4c8eac\">reported</a>.</p>\n<p>Because the DMA requires companies to build in interoperability with third party devices and applications, Apple claims it has to delay some features in the EU, including its <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/09/09/airpods-pro-3-arrive-with-heart-rate-sensing-and-live-translation-using-apple-intelligence/\">new live translation feature for AirPods</a>, iPhone mirroring on Macs, and the visited places and <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/06/09/apples-new-maps-will-learn-your-commute-in-ios-26/\">preferred routes</a> feature on Maps. The list of delayed features will “probably get longer,” the company said.</p>\n<p>As the company frames it, the DMA’s interoperability requirements are hard to square with the company’s commitment to user privacy. The law requires companies to open up their ecosystems to competitors by making proprietary apps and features compatible with third-party hardware and software. But Apple says its teams are hard-pressed to find a way to do so without compromising user data.</p>\n<p>“We’ve suggested changes to these features that would protect our users’ data, but so far, the European Commission has rejected our proposals. And according to the European Commission, under the DMA, it’s illegal for us to share these features with Apple users until we bring them to other companies’ products. If we shared them any sooner, we’d be fined and potentially forced to stop shipping our products in the EU,” Apple wrote in a blog post.</p>\n<p>Apple’s post comes a few months after <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/04/23/eu-fines-apple-meta-millions-for-breaching-tech-competition-rules/\">the EU fined the company more than $550 million</a> for breaching the DMA by requiring app developers to transact payments for apps and services within Apple’s ecosystem. The company has <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/07/07/apple-appeals-eus-e500m-fine-over-app-store-payment-restraints/\">appealed</a> the decision.</p>\n<div>\n\t\t<p>Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t<p><span>San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>October 27-29, 2025</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n<p>Apple also argues that letting users install apps from third-party app stores and use other payment mechanisms, as the DMA requires, is increasing the likelihood of scam, malware and fraud risks to its users.</p>\n<p>“It’s been more than a year since the Digital Markets Act was implemented. Over that time, it’s become clear that the DMA is leading to a worse experience for Apple users in the EU. It’s exposing them to new risks, and disrupting the simple, seamless way their Apple products work together. And as new technologies come out, our European users’ Apple products will only fall further behind,” the company wrote.</p>\n<p>“We are not surprised by Apple’s lobbying paper to repeal the DMA because Apple has contested every little bit of the DMA since its entry into application,” said EC spokesperson Thomas Regnier in a press briefing on Thursday. “This undermines the company’s narrative of wanting to be fully cooperative with the Commission […] We facilitated DMA compliance when we came up with the specification decisions and we told [Apple] how they could be compliant when it comes to interoperability. After two months, Apple came back and asked us to scrap everything.” </p>\n<p>“Nothing in the DMA requires companies to lower their privacy standards, or their security standards. It is just about giving our users more choice, opening up the European market and allowing companies to compete on an equal footing,” Regnier added.</p>\n</div><div>\n<div>\n\t\t<p>Ram is a financial and tech reporter and editor.
