YouTube TV reportedly now has around <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2025/09/25/youtube-tv-nbcuniversal-impending-carriage-dispute.html\" target=\"_blank\">10 million subscribers</a>, in large part due to is live sports-related content. Hulu Live TV and Fubo together have about 6 million subscribers, so this merger is a step toward closing that competitive gap. </p>\n<p>Additionally, if executed well, it could offer sports fans more flexible options. For instance, sources suggest that Fubo may be exploring the idea of introducing a new Hulu-branded package as a perk for streamers, featuring access to Disney’s trio of streaming services (Disney+, Hulu, and ESPN) at no additional cost. The company recently <a href=\"https://thedesk.net/2025/08/fubo-sports-launch-hulu-live-tv-app/\" target=\"_blank\">announced</a> the launch of a skinny sports-only package at a lower price point.</p>\n<p>However, the approval obtained at the Fubo shareholder meeting on Tuesday still awaits regulatory approvals, as the deal will create a larger entity and impact market competition, reducing the number of independent streaming players.</p>\n<p>Once the transaction is finalized, Disney will own approximately 70% of Fubo. However, possibly with those regulatory approvals in mind, Fubo promises it will continue to be available to viewers as an independent offering. That said, Disney is consolidating this unit under a single leader: David Gandler, co-founder and CEO of Fubo, who will oversee the newly merged Fubo and Hulu Live TV operations.</p>\n</div>\n\t\t\t<div>\n\t<p>Topics</p>\n</div>\n<div>\n<div>\n\t\t<p>Lauren covers media, streaming, apps and platforms at TechCrunch.</p>\n<p>You can contact or verify outreach from Lauren by emailing <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:laurenf.techcrunch@gmail.com\">laurenf.techcrunch@gmail.com</a> or via encrypted message at laurenforris22.25 on Signal.</p>\t</div>\n\t<p>\n\t\t<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/author/lauren-forristal/\">View Bio <svg></svg></a>\n\t</p>\n</div>\n\t\t</div>"

Lately, browsers like Dia and <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/09/30/opera-launches-its-ai-centric-neon-browser/\" target=\"_blank\">Opera Neon</a> have added a way for people to get repeated tasks done in the form of skills and cards.</p>\n<p>Now, meeting notetaker Granola is bringing its own spin with a feature called Recipes, which lets you create a prompt shortcut you can use again and again. You can invoke a recipe by using “/” in Granola chat and typing its name. </p>\n<p>You can create your own recipes by typing in a prompt and giving it context of either one meeting or having it work across meetings. The company also has <a href=\"https://help.granola.ai/article/writing-effective-recipes#understanding-recipe-types\" target=\"_blank\">a guide to help you form effective recipes</a>.

It’s also 40% faster when writing or turning pages. Amazon says it features a new texture-molded glass to improve the friction when the pen glides across the screen to make it feel like you’re writing on paper. </p>\n<p>The device also comes with a new quad-core chip, more memory, and the company’s latest Oxide display technology to make everything feel smoother.</p>\n<p>There are two versions of the Kindle Scribe, one with a front light system and one without. Kindle Scribe with a front light will be available later this year in the U.S. starting at $499.99. The version without a front light will be available early next year for $429.99. </p>\n<figure><img src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/kindle-colorsoft.jpeg?w=680\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/kindle-colorsoft.jpeg 743w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/kindle-colorsoft.jpeg?resize=150,150 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/kindle-colorsoft.jpeg?resize=300,300 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/kindle-colorsoft.jpeg?resize=680,680 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/kindle-colorsoft.jpeg?resize=430,430 430w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/kindle-colorsoft.jpeg?resize=720,720 720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/kindle-colorsoft.jpeg?resize=668,668 668w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/kindle-colorsoft.jpeg?resize=375,375 375w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/kindle-colorsoft.jpeg?resize=617,617 617w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/kindle-colorsoft.jpeg?resize=531,531 531w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/kindle-colorsoft.jpeg?resize=50,50 50w\" /><figcaption><span><strong>Image Credits:</strong>Kindle</span></figcaption></figure>\n<p>As for the Kindle Scribe Colorsoft, Amazon says it features display technology that creates colors that are soft and don’t hurt your eyes like an LCD display.

Several apps like this have cropped up over the years, including <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/03/anonymous-snapchat-app-sendit-surges-with-3-5m-installs-after-snap-bans-yolo-and-lmk/\">YOLO and LMK</a>, which were suspended on Snapchat in 2021 due to a lawsuit over a child’s suicide. After that suspension, Sendit quickly gained <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/03/anonymous-snapchat-app-sendit-surges-with-3-5m-installs-after-snap-bans-yolo-and-lmk/\">3.5 million downloads</a>, as users flocked to the app to replace those that were no longer available.</p>\n<p>By the following year, TechCrunch <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2022/06/29/anonymous-social-apps-shift-their-attention-to-instagram-in-the-wake-of-snapchats-ban/\">reporting</a> found that the newer anonymous question apps, like Sendit and <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2022/08/04/top-anonymous-social-app-ngl-forced-to-stop-tricking-its-users/\">LMK</a>, were misleading users with fake messages, then offering in-app purchases to reveal who sent the messages.</p>\n<p>This reporting was echoed in the FTC’s complaint, which stated that Sendit sent users fake, provocative messages (like “would you ever get with me?” or “have you done drugs?”).</p>\n<p>If a user wanted to see who sent a message, they could spend $9.99 for a “Diamond Membership,” but the FTC claims that it was not clear that this was a recurring weekly payment, and not a one-time cost. If a user revealed the “identity” behind a message that was actually submitted by Sendit, they would be given false information.</p>\n<p>The FTC also accused Sendit of knowingly collecting data on users under the age of 13 without parental consent, which is illegal under <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Children%27s_Online_Privacy_Protection_Act\">COPPA</a> (Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act). In particular, the FTC cited an instance from 2022 when more than 116,000 users reported that they were under 13, but Sendit parent Iconic Hearts did not notify parents that it had collected this data, nor did it ask for permission.</p>\n<p>That same year, TechCrunch found that Sendit users were complaining in App Store reviews that the Sendit for Instagram app had solicited downloads by marketing itself as “Sendit Reveal,” an app that would “reveal” who sent them anonymous messages. </p>\n<p>At the time, when TechCrunch asked Sendit founder Hunter Rice about these dark patterns, he suggested that we were looking for clickbait.</p>\n<p>“There’s a lot of great things about what we’re doing that are newsworthy,” Rice <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2022/06/29/anonymous-social-apps-shift-their-attention-to-instagram-in-the-wake-of-snapchats-ban/\">told TechCrunch</a> in 2022. “You’re welcome to have your fun with this topic, but I’m only interested in talking about real news.”</p>\n<p>Sendit <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2022/07/15/not-gonna-lie-this-ngl-lawsuit-is-kinda-juicy/\">also sued a competitor, NGL</a>, in 2022, saying it stole the idea of the fake, anonymous questions and other trade secrets. NGL was <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2022/08/04/top-anonymous-social-app-ngl-forced-to-stop-tricking-its-users/\">later forced to end the practice</a> in order to remain in the App Store, following TechCrunch’s reporting.  </p>\n</div><div>\n<div>\n\t\t<p>Amanda Silberling is a senior writer at TechCrunch covering the intersection of technology and culture.

    "body": "<div>\n<p><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://periodic.com/\">Periodic Labs</a> came out of stealth on Tuesday with a war chest of $300 million as a seed round, backed by a tech industry’s who’s who: Andreessen Horowitz, DST, Nvidia, Accel, Elad Gil, Jeff Dean, Eric Schmidt, and Jeff Bezos.</p>\n<p>Period Labs was founded by Ekin Dogus Cubuk and Liam Fedus. Cubuk led the materials and chemistry team at Google Brain and DeepMind, where one of his projects was, for instance, an AI tool called GNoME. That tool <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://deepmind.google/discover/blog/millions-of-new-materials-discovered-with-deep-learning/\">discovered over 2 million new crystals in 2023</a>, materials that could one day be used to power new generations of technology, researchers say.</p>\n<p>Fedus is a former VP of Research at OpenAI, and one of the researchers who helped create ChatGPT. He also led the team that created the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2101.03961\">first trillion-parameter neural network</a>.</p>\n<p>Its small team is likewise filled with researchers who have worked on other major AI and materials science projects, from building OpenAI’s agent Operator to working on Microsoft’s MatterGen, an LLM materials science discovery AI.</p>\n<p>The goal of Periodic Labs is nothing less than to automate scientific discovery, creating AI scientists, the company says. This means building labs where robots conduct physical experiments, collect data, iterate, and try again, learning and improving as they go.</p>\n<p>The lab’s first goal is to invent new superconductors that it hopes perform better and possibly require less energy than existing superconducting materials. But the well-funded startup also hopes to find other new materials.</p>\n<p>Another goal is to collect all the physical world data that its AI scientists produce as they mix and heat and otherwise manipulate various powers and raw materials in their search for something new.</p>\n<div>\n\t\t<p>Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t<p><span>San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>October 27-29, 2025</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n<p>“Until now, scientific AI advances have come from models trained on the internet” and LLMs have “exhausted” the internet as a source that can be consumed, the company says in an introductory blog post. “At Periodic, we are building AI scientists and the autonomous laboratories for them to operate.”</p>\n<p>The hope is that, not only will the labs invent next-generation materials, but they will produce invaluable fresh data that AI models can consume to continue their evolution.</p>\n<p>While this might be one of the most impressive groups of researchers to assemble a startup for this purpose, it’s not the only one working on AI scientists. AI as a tool to automate chemistry discoveries has been a <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.06949\">topic of academic research since at least 2023</a>. It is the pursuit of tiny startups like <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/12/22/tetsuwan-scientific-is-making-robotic-ai-scientists-that-can-run-experiments-on-their-own/\">Tetsuwan Scientific</a>, as well as non profits like <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.futurehouse.org/\">Future House</a> and the University of Toronto’s <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://acceleration.utoronto.ca/\">Acceleration Consortium</a>.</p>\n</div>"

For instance, just yesterday OpenAI announced a plan to take on Amazon and Google with <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/09/29/openai-takes-on-google-amazon-with-new-agentic-shopping-system/\">its own agentic shopping system,</a> which includes an “Instant Checkout” feature.</p>\n<p>While OpenAI’s system initially only supports Etsy with plans for Shopify merchants “soon,” it’s a signal of what’s to come in the AI era. Instead of browsing the web or Amazon when looking for products and recommendations, users may start their shopping research in an AI chatbot, instead of just browsing the web, where Honey previously had traction, necessitating new products like this.  </p>\n<div>\n\t\t<p>Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t<p><span>San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>October 27-29, 2025</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n<p>The AI features are launching after quite a <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/24343913/paypal-honey-megalag-coupon-scam-affiliate-fees\" target=\"_blank\">bit of bad press</a> for Honey.

    "body": "<div>\n<p>On Tuesday, OpenAI <a href=\"https://openai.com/index/sora-2/\" target=\"_blank\">announced</a> the release of Sora 2, an audio and video generator to succeed last year’s <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/12/09/openais-sora-is-launching-today-heres-highlights-from-the-first-review/\">Sora</a>. Along with the model, the company also launched a linked social app called Sora, where users can be able to generate videos of themselves and their friends to share on a TikTok-style algorithmic feed. OpenAI’s work on a new social platform was <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/story/openai-launches-sora-2-tiktok-like-app/\" target=\"_blank\">previously reported by Wired</a>.</p>\n<p>While we haven’t been able to test the invite-only app and Sora 2 model ourselves yet, OpenAI has shared impressive examples. In particular, Sora 2 is better at following the laws of physics, making the videos more realistic. OpenAI’s public clips depict a beach volleyball game, skateboard tricks, gymnastics routines, and cannonball jumps from a diving board, among others.</p>\n<figure></figure>\n<p>“Prior video models are overoptimistic — they will morph objects and deform reality to successfully execute upon a text prompt,” OpenAI wrote in <a href=\"https://openai.com/index/sora-2/\" target=\"_blank\">a blog post</a>. “For example, if a basketball player misses a shot, the ball may spontaneously teleport to the hoop. In Sora 2, if a basketball player misses a shot, it will rebound off the backboard.”</p>\n<p>The Sora app comes with an “upload yourself” feature called “cameos,” which allows users to drop themselves into any Sora-generated scenes. In order to use their own likeness in a generated video, users will have to upload a one-time video-and-audio recording to verify their identity and capture their appearance.</p>\n<p>This feature also allows users to share their “cameos” with their friends, allowing them to give other users the permission to include their likeness in videos that they generate, including videos of multiple people together. </p>\n<p>“We think a social app built around this ‘cameos’ feature is the best way to experience the magic of Sora 2,” the company wrote.</p>\n<p>The Sora iOS app is available to download now and will initially roll out in the U.S. and Canada, though OpenAI says it hopes to expand quickly to other countries. While the Sora social platform is currently invite-only, ChatGPT Pro users should be able to try out the Sora 2 Pro model without an invite.</p>\n<div>\n\t\t<p>Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t<p><span>San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>October 27-29, 2025</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n<p>Once videos are generated, they can be shared in a feed within the Sora app, which seems like it’ll be similar to TikTok, Instagram Reels, or other short form video feeds. Interestingly, Meta announced just last week that it added a video feed called “<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/09/25/meta-launches-vibes-a-short-form-video-feed-of-ai-slop/\">Vibes</a>” to its Meta AI app (it’s basically all mindless slop).</p>\n<p>To curate its algorithmic recommendations, OpenAI will consider a user’s Sora activity, their location (attained via their IP address), their past post engagement, and their ChatGPT conversation history, though that can be turned off. The Sora app also ships with parental controls via ChatGPT, which allow parents to override infinite scroll limits, turn off algorithmic personalization, and manage who can direct message their child. However, these features are only as powerful as the parent’s technical know-how. </p>\n<p>The Sora app will be free at launch, which OpenAI says is “so people can freely explore its capabilities.” The company says that at launch, the only plan for monetization to charge users to generate extra videos in times of high demand.</p>\n<p>The launch of a social platform will require significant user safety measures from OpenAI, which has <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/09/29/openai-rolls-out-safety-routing-system-parental-controls-on-chatgpt/\">struggled with the same issues</a> in ChatGPT. While users can revoke access to their likeness at any time, this sort of access can easily be abused. Even if a user trusts someone they know with access to their AI likeness, that person could still generate deceptive content that could be used to harm that person. Non-consensual videos are a persistent problem with AI-generated video, causing significant harm with <a href=\"https://digitalcommons.law.byu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=3564&context=lawreview\" target=\"_blank\">few laws explicitly governing platform responsibility</a>.</p>\n</div><div>\n<div>\n\t\t<p>Amanda Silberling is a senior writer at TechCrunch covering the intersection of technology and culture.

Amazon also launched an Alexa+ feature that functions as a smart doorbell assistant, providing details about visitors before users answer the door.</p>\n<p>Ring is also introducing its first 4K product line along with “Retinal Vision,” a new imaging technology designed to provide clearer video. </p>\n<figure><img src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/assets.aboutamazon.png?w=680\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/assets.aboutamazon.png 1200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/assets.aboutamazon.png?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/assets.aboutamazon.png?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/assets.aboutamazon.png?resize=768,432 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/assets.aboutamazon.png?resize=680,383 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/assets.aboutamazon.png?resize=430,242 430w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/assets.aboutamazon.png?resize=720,405 720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/assets.aboutamazon.png?resize=900,506 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/assets.aboutamazon.png?resize=800,450 800w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/assets.aboutamazon.png?resize=668,375 668w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/assets.aboutamazon.png?resize=1097,617 1097w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/assets.aboutamazon.png?resize=708,398 708w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/assets.aboutamazon.png?resize=50,28 50w\" /><figcaption><span><strong>Image Credits:</strong>Amazon Ring</span></figcaption></figure>\n<p>The most notable feature revealed at the event was “Familiar Faces,” which uses AI to identify friends and family. Users can enroll the faces of their loved ones into the device, enabling Ring to alert them when it recognizes a visitor. The AI will also alert the user when an unfamiliar person is detected, helping them to make informed decisions quickly. </p>\n<p>The company explained <a href=\"https://www.aboutamazon.com/news/devices/ring-camera-4k-home-security\" target=\"_blank\">in today’s blog post</a> that the new feature is meant to empower “customers to reduce notifications triggered by familiar people’s routine activities” and eliminate guesswork for people detection.  </p>\n<p>“Equally important is that if someone you don’t recognize is lingering, you’ll know immediately [they’re] unfamiliar,” Ring founder Jamie Siminoff told press at the event. </p>\n<p>Ring has faced criticism for its close ties with law enforcement and its history of poor data management. Last year, following numerous complaints, the company <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/01/24/amazon-reverses-course-revokes-police-access-to-ring-footage-via-neighbors-app/\">announced </a>that it would no longer accommodate police requests for footage from Ring users without a warrant. </p>\n<div>\n\t\t<p>Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t<p><span>San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>October 27-29, 2025</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n<p>The Familiar Faces feature can be integrated into the broader Alexa+ Greetings system, which will enable specific greetings when the camera recognizes a specific face. This feature transforms the voice assistant into a smart doorbell attendant, enabling it to interact with visitors, manage deliveries, and identify the purpose of visits to keep users informed.</p>\n<p>Another AI feature, Search Party, helps find lost pets by networking Ring cameras. When a user registers a lost pet, neighboring Ring users will receive a description of the pet and can report sightings. The system uses AI to deliver possible matches, although sightings have to be voluntarily reported. The company states that users are in control of their privacy and can choose to ignore the alert if they don’t want to share information with a neighbor. </p>\n<p>Both Familiar Faces and Alexa+ Greeting will roll out to customers starting in December. Search Party for dogs will launch in November, with support for cats and other pets planned for release in the future.</p>\n<figure><img src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/assets.aboutamazon-1.png?w=680\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/assets.aboutamazon-1.png 1200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/assets.aboutamazon-1.png?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/assets.aboutamazon-1.png?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/assets.aboutamazon-1.png?resize=768,432 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/assets.aboutamazon-1.png?resize=680,383 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/assets.aboutamazon-1.png?resize=430,242 430w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/assets.aboutamazon-1.png?resize=720,405 720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/assets.aboutamazon-1.png?resize=900,506 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/assets.aboutamazon-1.png?resize=800,450 800w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/assets.aboutamazon-1.png?resize=668,375 668w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/assets.aboutamazon-1.png?resize=1097,617 1097w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/assets.aboutamazon-1.png?resize=708,398 708w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/assets.aboutamazon-1.png?resize=50,28 50w\" /><figcaption><span><strong>Image Credits:</strong>Amazon Ring</span></figcaption></figure>\n<p>The features will come preloaded onto Ring’s new Retinal 2K and Retinal 4K devices, the company’s new products that use “Retinal Vision,” imaging technology that improves the imaging process with advanced AI.

    "body": "<div>\n<p>Sen. Ted Cruz (R-TX) has blocked an effort to pass legislation that would have extended data privacy protections for federal lawmakers and public officials to everyone in the United States.</p>\n<p>On Monday night, Sen. Ron Wyden (D-OR) asked the U.S. Senate for unanimous consent from fellow senators to pass his legislation, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/26173848-senate-2850/\">S.2850</a>, or Protecting Americans from Doxing and Political Violence Act. </p>\n<p>Wyden’s bill, if passed, would have taken <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.congress.gov/bill/119th-congress/senate-bill/2144/text\">bipartisan-passed provisions</a> designed to protect government officials, lawmakers, and their families from having their personal information sold or traded by data brokers, and extend them to every American and person living in the United States.</p>\n<p>“Members of Congress should not receive special treatment,” Wyden said on the Senate floor. “Our constituents deserve protection from violence, stalking, and other criminal threats.”</p>\n<p>“Protecting everyone is the most effective way to protect U.S. military and intelligence personnel, including undercover officers,” Wyden added, per <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.congress.gov/119/crec/2025/09/29/171/159/CREC-2025-09-29-pt1-PgS6813-3.pdf\">the congressional record</a>.</p>\n<p>Cruz was the sole objecting senator, who claimed without evidence that Wyden’s bill could disrupt law enforcement, “such as knowing where sexual predators are living.”</p>\n<p>Data brokers are part of a worldwide multibillion-dollar industry of companies that profit from hoarding and selling access to huge amounts of Americans’ personal, financial, and granular location information, often collected from phones and other devices connected to the internet. This data gets sold, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2023/06/13/us-intelligence-report-purchase-americans-personal-data/\">including to governments</a>, who don’t need a warrant for commercially obtainable data.</p>\n<p>The collection of huge banks of data also comes with its own risks, including <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/05/28/data-broker-giant-lexisnexis-says-breach-exposed-personal-information-of-over-364000-people/\">security lapses</a> and <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/01/13/gravy-analytics-data-broker-breach-trove-of-location-data-threatens-privacy-millions/\">data breaches</a>. Information bought by data brokers has been used to dox people, and in recent cases linked to the recent murders of two Minnesota state lawmakers, whose killer <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.wired.com/story/minnesota-lawmaker-shootings-people-search-data-brokers/\">allegedly obtained their home addresses</a> from data brokers.</p>\n<p>Cruz also objected to a second piece of legislation that Wyden introduced soon after, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/26173849-senate-2851/\">S.2851</a>, which would have extended the protections for federal officials and lawmakers to state officials and their staff, as well as survivors of domestic violence and sexual assault.</p>\n<p>In response, Cruz said that he was “interested in expanding the protection to as wide a universe as is feasible, as is practicable, but that answer is not yet worked out.”</p>\n</div><div>\n<div>\n\t\t<p>Zack Whittaker is the security editor at TechCrunch.
