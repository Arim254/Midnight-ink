At this moment, ENISA cannot share further information regarding the cyberattack,” the agency said in an emailed statement to TechCrunch.  </p>\n<p>The ransomware attack targeted Collins Aerospace, a company that provides among other things check-in systems to several airports, including Berlin, Brussels, and London’s Heathrow. The company said it was working with affected airports to restore services, <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/business/aerospace-defense/eu-agency-says-third-party-ransomware-behind-airport-disruptions-2025-09-22/\" target=\"_blank\">according to Reuters</a>, which first reported ENISA’s statement. </p>\n<p>On Saturday, <a href=\"http://theguardian.com/uk-news/2025/sep/20/heathrow-airport-delays-cyber-attack-berlin-brussels-cancelled-delays\" target=\"_blank\">The Guardian reported</a> that Collins Aerospace said that the software targeted was the company’s passenger processing system called MUSE, which “allows multiple airlines to share check-in desks and boarding gate positions at an airport rather than having their own dedicated infrastructure,” <a href=\"http://collinsaerospace.com/what-we-do/industries/airports/passenger-processing-solutions/agent-assisted-check-in\" target=\"_blank\">according to Collins Aerospace’s official website</a>. </p>\n<p>Collins Aerospace, which is owned by defense contractor RTX, did not immediately respond to a request for comment. At this point, it’s unclear who is behind the cyberattack.  </p>\n<p>The cyberattack has caused disruptions with check-in processes, flight delays, and cancellation since Friday night.  </p>\n</div>\n<div>\n\t<p>Topics</p>\n</div>\n</div><div><div>\n\t<div>\n\t\t<p>Subscribe for the industry’s biggest tech news</p>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n<div>\n<h2>Related</h2>\n<div><ul><li>\n<div>\n\t\t\t<figure>\n\t\t\t<img src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/GettyImages-2231033749.jpg?w=563\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/GettyImages-2231033749.jpg 1920w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/GettyImages-2231033749.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/GettyImages-2231033749.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/GettyImages-2231033749.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/GettyImages-2231033749.jpg?resize=680,453 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/GettyImages-2231033749.jpg?resize=1200,800 1200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/GettyImages-2231033749.jpg?resize=1280,853 1280w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/GettyImages-2231033749.jpg?resize=430,287 430w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/GettyImages-2231033749.jpg?resize=720,480 720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/GettyImages-2231033749.jpg?resize=900,600 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/GettyImages-2231033749.jpg?resize=800,533 800w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/GettyImages-2231033749.jpg?resize=1536,1024 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/GettyImages-2231033749.jpg?resize=668,445 668w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/GettyImages-2231033749.jpg?resize=563,375 563w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/GettyImages-2231033749.jpg?resize=926,617 926w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/GettyImages-2231033749.jpg?resize=708,472 708w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/GettyImages-2231033749.jpg?resize=50,33 50w\" />\t\t</figure>\n\t\t</div>\n</li></ul></div>\n</div>\n<p></p><h2 id=\"h-latest-in\">Latest in Security</h2><p></p>\n</div>"

    "body": "<div>\n<p>One year ago, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/tag/stellantis/\">Stellantis</a> announced plans to add an electrified 4xe plug-in hybrid Jeep Gladiator to North America by the end of 2025. The electrified Jeep Gladiator never made it into production.</p>\n<p>The automaker will no longer include an electrified Gladiator in its Jeep lineup as it reassesses its product strategy, the company told TechCrunch in an emailed statement. The company cited changing customer preferences as a primary driver of its decision. </p>\n<p>“The Jeep Gladiator carries its rugged styling and authentic design into 2026 while adding incredible new content straight from the factory,” the statement reads. “It will continue to serve as the industry’s only open-air pickup truck, combining legendary Jeep 4×4 capability with exceptional everyday versatility. As customers’ propulsion preferences for battery-electric trucks continue to evolve, Stellantis is reassessing its product strategy and will no longer include an electrified Gladiator variant in the Jeep lineup. The Jeep brand has already begun reinvesting funding to ensure the long-term growth of the Jeep Gladiator and will introduce even more customer-requested factory features, customization, and additional powertrain options in the near future.”</p>\n<p>The Gladiator is the latest electrified vehicle hopeful to get the axe. Last week, Stellantis said it would no longer develop a battery-electric full-size pickup under its Ram brand, a vehicle that was supposed to be part of the automaker’s U.S. product offensive to sell more than <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2022/03/01/how-stellantis-plans-to-double-revenue-electrify-lineup-by-2030/\" target=\"_blank\">25 all-new BEVs</a> by the end of the decade.</p>\n<p>Stellantis cited low demand for full-size battery-electric trucks as the primary reason. The automaker will instead pursue an extended-range truck that gets an estimated 690 miles of range through a novel — but not unheard of — approach of combining a battery with a gas generator.</p>\n<p>Stellantis isn’t the only automaker to pullback on once grand plans around electric vehicles. Many major automakers, including Ford, GM, Mercedes, and VW Group have made pledges to invest billions of dollars in electric vehicles only to pivot later. A combination of lower-than-expected demand, saturation amid the luxury EV market, and the imminent <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/08/11/techcrunch-mobility-the-triple-punch-headed-for-automakers/\">end of the U.S. federal EV tax credit</a> have been cited as reasons for changing business strategies.</p>\n<p>Some of these companies have shifted energy and dollars toward lower-cost EVs, which a larger swath of the population can afford, but the vehicles come with slimmer margins.</p>\n<p>Newcomer Slate is developing a <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/07/10/slate-auto-everything-you-need-to-know-about-the-bezos-backed-ev-startup/\">minimalist electric pickup</a> that’s expected to cost under $30,000. Ford has delayed the launch of two next-generation electric vehicles, including a full-size electric pickup, to focus on smaller and more affordable models. In August, Ford announced it would<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/08/11/ford-throws-out-henry-fords-assembly-line-to-make-low-cost-evs-in-america/\"> invest $2 billion</a> to transform its Louisville Assembly Plant into a factory capable of making a new generation of affordable EVs, starting with a mid-sized pickup truck with a base price of $30,000 that is slated to launch in 2027.</p>\n</div><div>\n<div><p>\n\t\tKirsten Korosec is a reporter and editor who has covered the future of transportation from EVs and autonomous vehicles to urban air mobility and in-car tech for more than a decade.

He was a founding member of Oracle’s cloud engineering team and has served as the president of Oracle’s cloud infrastructure business unit for more than a decade.  </p>\n<p>Sicilia has served as the president of Oracle’s industries division since June. He held several different roles at the company since he joined through Oracle’s acquisition of project portfolio management company Primavera Systems in 2008.  </p>\n<p>Safra Catz, who has been Oracle’s CEO since 2014, is moving into a new role as the executive vice chair of Oracle’s board of directors.  </p>\n<p>“Today, Oracle is recognized as the cloud of choice for both AI training and inferencing. I’m very proud of that,” Catz said in a statement. “Oracle’s technology and business have never been stronger. And our breathtaking growth rate points to an even more prosperous future. At this time of strength is the right moment to pass the CEO role to the next generation of capable executives.”  </p>\n<p>While traditionally known as a cloud infrastructure provider, Oracle has recently started to cement its place in the AI infrastructure race as well. Earlier this year, the company announced its participation in the <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/01/21/openai-teams-up-with-softbank-and-oracle-on-50b-data-center-project/\" target=\"_blank\">$500 billion Stargate Project,</a> alongside OpenAI and SoftBank, to build data centers and AI infrastructure in the U.S.  </p>\n<p>Earlier this month, it was reported that the company inked a <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/09/10/openai-and-oracle-reportedly-ink-historic-cloud-computing-deal/\" target=\"_blank\">landmark deal with OpenAI</a> to supply the AI company with $300 billion worth of compute. On Friday, Reuters reported that the company was signing a smaller — but still sizable — <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/business/oracle-talks-with-meta-20-billion-ai-cloud-computing-deal-bloomberg-reports-2025-09-19/\" target=\"_blank\">$20 billion compute deal</a> with Meta.  </p>\n<div>\n\t\t<p>Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t<p><span>San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>October 27-29, 2025</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n<p>TechCrunch reached out to Oracle for more information on the transition.  </p>\n</div>\n\t\t\t<div>\n\t<p>Topics</p>\n</div>\n<div>\n<div>\n\t\t<p>Becca is a senior writer at TechCrunch that covers venture capital trends and startups.

On Monday, the company <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://blog.google/products/google-tv/gemini-google-tv/\">announced</a> it’s introducing Gemini for Google TV, allowing TV owners to engage in free-flowing, natural language conversations with the AI. </p>\n<p>When fully rolled out, this expansion of Gemini to a new platform will bring Google’s AI to over 300 million active <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://tv.google/\">Google TV</a> and other Android TV OS-powered devices. </p>\n<p>In terms of TV-related questions, Google suggests its Gemini AI could be used to help people with different interests settle on something to watch that they would both like, or to catch you up on what you missed in a past season of a favorite show. You could also get Gemini to help you find a movie or show when you can’t remember the title or ask about a title’s reviews to help determine if it’s worth watching.</p>\n<p>However, because it’s Gemini, you can ask any other type of question, too, just as you could with the AI chatbot on your smartphone.</p>\n<p> For instance, kids and parents could use the AI to get homework help or brainstorm school project ideas, families could use Gemini to plan their next vacation, or individual users could leverage the AI to teach themselves a new skill, among other things.</p>\n<figure><img src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Volcano_Gemini_TV-Shell.width-1000.format-webp.webp\" alt=\"a photo of a Google TV showing a response on screen showing a prompt: \"explain why volcanoes erupt to my third grader\".\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Volcano_Gemini_TV-Shell.width-1000.format-webp.webp 1000w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Volcano_Gemini_TV-Shell.width-1000.format-webp.webp?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Volcano_Gemini_TV-Shell.width-1000.format-webp.webp?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Volcano_Gemini_TV-Shell.width-1000.format-webp.webp?resize=768,432 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Volcano_Gemini_TV-Shell.width-1000.format-webp.webp?resize=680,382 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Volcano_Gemini_TV-Shell.width-1000.format-webp.webp?resize=430,242 430w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Volcano_Gemini_TV-Shell.width-1000.format-webp.webp?resize=720,405 720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Volcano_Gemini_TV-Shell.width-1000.format-webp.webp?resize=900,506 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Volcano_Gemini_TV-Shell.width-1000.format-webp.webp?resize=800,450 800w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Volcano_Gemini_TV-Shell.width-1000.format-webp.webp?resize=668,375 668w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Volcano_Gemini_TV-Shell.width-1000.format-webp.webp?resize=708,398 708w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Volcano_Gemini_TV-Shell.width-1000.format-webp.webp?resize=50,28 50w\" /></figure>\n<p>The company stresses that Gemini’s addition doesn’t mean that you won’t be able to do the same things you used to be able to do through the (non-AI) Google Assistant integration.

    "body": "<div>\n<p>There’s a <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=abq9Y7YVDWA\">classic Simpsons episode</a> in which the sly businessman Mr. Burns recruits real Major League Baseball players to join his company softball team in order to win a bet. But when the championship is on the line, Mr. Burns pulls eight-time National League all-star Darryl Strawberry for a substitute, Homer Simpson.</p>\n<p>“You’re a left-hander, and so is the pitcher. If I send up a right-handed batter, it’s called playing the percentages,” Mr. Burns says to Strawberry. “It’s what smart managers do to win ballgames.”</p>\n<p>High-level baseball is very mathematically-driven, with teams hiring dozens of data engineers to study granular statistics that can inform managerial decisions. But like Mr. Burns in that Simpsons episode, it’s tempting to overanalyze baseball statistics to the point of absurdity.</p>\n<p>The Oakland Ballers, an independent Pioneer League baseball team, took that concept of “playing the percentages” to the next level: they let an AI manage the team for a game.</p>\n<p>The Ballers were <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/09/08/the-coolest-startup-in-the-bay-area-is-a-baseball-team-called-the-oakland-ballers/\">founded by edtech entrepreneur Paul Freedman</a> as a salve to the departure of the beloved Oakland A’s, the Major League baseball team that owner John Fisher ripped away from local fans in what’s regarded as one of the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://abc7news.com/post/angry-sad-oakland-athletics-fans-respond-owner-john-fishers-goodbye-letter/15353346/\">most insidious</a> <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.si.com/mlb/athletics/relocation/heard-on-espn-john-fisher-is-the-worst-owner-in-sports\">managerial moves</a> in sports history. Though they’re not a Major League team, the Oakland Ballers – coyly, the Oakland B’s – established an unprecedented national community of fans who rallied around the team in protest of the A’s departure. After just two seasons, the Ballers just won Oakland’s <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://sfstandard.com/2025/09/22/oakland-ballers-title-championship-pioneer-league/\">first baseball title</a> since 1989.</p>\n<p>“The Oakland Ballers uniquely have the experience of being like a major league team in a minor league market,” Freedman told TechCrunch. “We can have creative flexibility. We can play with things and experiment with things way before the MLB or NBA or any of those leagues could do something.”</p>\n<p>Minor league baseball organizations are often called upon to test new technology before it gets implemented in the majors, like challenging calls with instant replay footage or the automated ball-strike system. The Ballers embraced this attitude, especially given Freedman’s own background in tech, but have added in a dash of whimsy, piloting things that would never actually debut in Major League Baseball.</p>\n<div>\n\t\t<p>Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t<p><span>San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>October 27-29, 2025</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n<p>Last year, this meant partnering with <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://x.com/fancontrolled?lang=en\">Fan Controlled Sports</a> to let fans make managerial decisions during one late season game. The Ballers ended up losing that game, in part because fans advocated for the funniest possible managerial decisions, rather than the savviest – at one point, the fans called upon a pitcher to pinch hit.</p>\n<p>This time around, once the team clinched their postseason berth, the Ballers partnered with the AI company <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://distillery.com/our-services/ai-development/\">Distillery</a> to commission AI software that could manage a baseball game in real time.</p>\n<p>“Baseball is the perfect place to do an initial experiment like this, because it is so data-driven, and decisions are made very analytically,” Freedman told TechCrunch. “You have the pace to be able to do something literally after every pitch.”</p>\n<p>Distillery trained OpenAI’s ChatGPT on over a century’s worth of baseball data and analytics, including Ballers games, to approximate what decisions Ballers manager Aaron Miles would make.</p>\n<p>“What the AI did was figure out what our human coach would have done – the ingenuity on strategy and the concepts came from [Miles], and the ability to use the data and recognize patterns… is what the AI did throughout the course of the game,” Freedman said. “So I think the role of human ingenuity is safe for now, and AI is a tool to be deployed to optimize decisions, but not to make them.”</p>\n<p>The AI-controlled game went smoothly – in fact, the AI made all of the same choices regarding pitching changes, lineup construction, and pinch hitters that Miles would have made. The only time that Miles had to override the AI was to replace the starting catcher with his backup, since he was sick.</p>\n<p>Miles took his temporary replacement by AI in stride – perhaps because he knows that his job is not actually in jeopardy. In a <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.instagram.com/reel/DOR5aekEhHg\">video posted to the Ballers’ Instagram</a>, Miles walks to home plate before the game to shake hands with the opposing team’s manager – only instead of offering his own hand, he extends the tablet running the AI out for a handshake.</p>\n<p>But the use of AI struck a nerve for Oakland fans, who see companies like OpenAI – which powered Distillery’s baseball AI – as enterprises that prioritize “winning” the AI race over shipping products that have been properly tested for safety. For many fans, the AI experiment felt like a betrayal, similar to the kind of corporate greed that pushed three professional sports franchises out of Oakland in five years.</p>\n<p>“There goes the Ballers trying to appeal to Bay Area techies instead of baseball fans,” one commenter wrote. “It’s so over for Oakland.”</p>\n<p>This backlash wasn’t what the Ballers expected, and Freedman does not intend to repeat this AI experiment. But the reaction of the fans models a larger cultural tension in baseball and beyond. </p>\n<p>“It never feels good to have your fans be like, ‘We hate this,’” Freedman said. “But it’s not a bad thing that there’s more of a conversation about the pluses and minuses of this new technology now, as opposed to like, a decade later when it’s too late.”</p>\n</div><div>\n<div>\n\t\t<p>Amanda Silberling is a senior writer at TechCrunch covering the intersection of technology and culture.

Mirror, the connected fitness device that brought boutique workout classes into homes, launched just as the pandemic created unprecedented demand for home fitness solutions. The timing proved so prescient that Lululemon acquired the company for $500 million just two years after its Disrupt debut.</p>\n<p>Now Putnam is betting on another cultural shift — the growing desire to disconnect from screens and reconnect with family and friends in person. Her new company, still operating in stealth mode, is developing consumer gaming hardware designed to bring people face-to-face rather than isolate them behind individual devices.</p>\n<p>“We’re about to enter a golden age of hardware,” Putnam <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/11/16/consumer-tech-is-bouncing-back-and-consumer-founders-like-brynn-putnam-are-bouncing-back-with-it/\" target=\"_blank\">recently told TechCrunch</a> at one of its investor-focused <a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/techcrunch/albums/72177720321931752/\" target=\"_blank\">StrictlyVC evenings</a>, pointing to the convergence of mature display technologies, affordable components, and AI capabilities that make new types of interactive devices possible.</p>\n<figure><a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-disrupt-2025/?utm_source=tc&utm_medium=post&utm_campaign=disrupt2025&utm_content=speaker&promo=post_brynnputnam_08272025&display=\" target=\"_blank\"><img src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Screenshot-2025-08-26-at-1.09.07PM.png?w=680\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Screenshot-2025-08-26-at-1.09.07PM.png 1444w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Screenshot-2025-08-26-at-1.09.07PM.png?resize=150,105 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Screenshot-2025-08-26-at-1.09.07PM.png?resize=300,209 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Screenshot-2025-08-26-at-1.09.07PM.png?resize=768,535 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Screenshot-2025-08-26-at-1.09.07PM.png?resize=680,474 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Screenshot-2025-08-26-at-1.09.07PM.png?resize=1200,836 1200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Screenshot-2025-08-26-at-1.09.07PM.png?resize=1280,892 1280w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Screenshot-2025-08-26-at-1.09.07PM.png?resize=430,300 430w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Screenshot-2025-08-26-at-1.09.07PM.png?resize=720,502 720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Screenshot-2025-08-26-at-1.09.07PM.png?resize=900,627 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Screenshot-2025-08-26-at-1.09.07PM.png?resize=800,557 800w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Screenshot-2025-08-26-at-1.09.07PM.png?resize=668,465 668w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Screenshot-2025-08-26-at-1.09.07PM.png?resize=538,375 538w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Screenshot-2025-08-26-at-1.09.07PM.png?resize=886,617 886w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Screenshot-2025-08-26-at-1.09.07PM.png?resize=708,493 708w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Screenshot-2025-08-26-at-1.09.07PM.png?resize=50,35 50w\" /></a><figcaption><span><strong>Image Credits:</strong>TechCrunch</span></figcaption></figure>\n<p>The new venture represents a shift in priorities for Putnam. Where Mirror was about individual performance and self-improvement, her latest project focuses on shared experiences and strengthening relationships. She describes it as using technology not as the primary experience but as an enabler for better human connections.</p>\n<p>Drawing inspiration from Nintendo’s philosophy of using “withered technology with lateral thinking” — mature, affordable components combined with innovative experiences — Putnam is following the playbook that made Mirror successful. Rather than pushing technological boundaries, though, she’s focusing on creating compelling user experiences with proven hardware.</p>\n<p>The gaming space represents a natural next step for Putnam, who built her reputation on understanding how tech can motivate behavior change. Her boutique fitness studios taught her how to create engaging group experiences, lessons she applied to Mirror’s virtual classes and now to gaming scenarios that encourage face-to-face interaction.</p>\n<div>\n\t\t<p>Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t<p><span>San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>October 27-29, 2025</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n<p>Lerer Hippeau, the venture firm that led Mirror’s $3 million seed round, has already participated in a highly competitive funding round for Putnam’s new company, signaling strong investor confidence in her ability to identify and capitalize on consumer trends.</p>\n<p>The timing also aligns with a broader resurgence in consumer hardware investing. After years of focus on enterprise software and AI infrastructure, investors are showing renewed interest in consumer-facing hardware that can leverage AI and mature component ecosystems to create new categories of devices.</p>\n<p>Putnam’s appearance at Disrupt 2025 comes as TechCrunch celebrates its 20th anniversary, and attendees can be assured we’re bringing together the biggest names in tech to share insights on the future of innovation.</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, for entrepreneurs and investors watching consumer tech trends, Putnam’s return to the <strong><a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-disrupt-2025/agenda/?promo=post_brynnputnam_08272025&utm_campaign=disrupt2025&utm_content=speaker&utm_medium=post&utm_source=tc\" target=\"_blank\">Disrupt Stage</a></strong> will provide a chance to see how one of the category’s most successful recent founders is positioning for the next wave of innovation.
