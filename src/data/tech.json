At this moment, ENISA cannot share further information regarding the cyberattack,” the agency said in an emailed statement to TechCrunch.  </p>\n<p>The ransomware attack targeted Collins Aerospace, a company that provides among other things check-in systems to several airports, including Berlin, Brussels, and London’s Heathrow. The company said it was working with affected airports to restore services, <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/business/aerospace-defense/eu-agency-says-third-party-ransomware-behind-airport-disruptions-2025-09-22/\" target=\"_blank\">according to Reuters</a>, which first reported ENISA’s statement. </p>\n<p>On Saturday, <a href=\"http://theguardian.com/uk-news/2025/sep/20/heathrow-airport-delays-cyber-attack-berlin-brussels-cancelled-delays\" target=\"_blank\">The Guardian reported</a> that Collins Aerospace said that the software targeted was the company’s passenger processing system called MUSE, which “allows multiple airlines to share check-in desks and boarding gate positions at an airport rather than having their own dedicated infrastructure,” <a href=\"http://collinsaerospace.com/what-we-do/industries/airports/passenger-processing-solutions/agent-assisted-check-in\" target=\"_blank\">according to Collins Aerospace’s official website</a>. </p>\n<p>Collins Aerospace, which is owned by defense contractor RTX, did not immediately respond to a request for comment. At this point, it’s unclear who is behind the cyberattack.  </p>\n<p>The cyberattack has caused disruptions with check-in processes, flight delays, and cancellation since Friday night.  </p>\n</div>\n<div>\n\t<p>Topics</p>\n</div>\n</div><div><div>\n\t<div>\n\t\t<p>Subscribe for the industry’s biggest tech news</p>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n<div>\n<h2>Related</h2>\n<div><ul><li>\n<div>\n\t\t\t<figure>\n\t\t\t<img src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/GettyImages-2231033749.jpg?w=563\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/GettyImages-2231033749.jpg 1920w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/GettyImages-2231033749.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/GettyImages-2231033749.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/GettyImages-2231033749.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/GettyImages-2231033749.jpg?resize=680,453 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/GettyImages-2231033749.jpg?resize=1200,800 1200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/GettyImages-2231033749.jpg?resize=1280,853 1280w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/GettyImages-2231033749.jpg?resize=430,287 430w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/GettyImages-2231033749.jpg?resize=720,480 720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/GettyImages-2231033749.jpg?resize=900,600 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/GettyImages-2231033749.jpg?resize=800,533 800w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/GettyImages-2231033749.jpg?resize=1536,1024 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/GettyImages-2231033749.jpg?resize=668,445 668w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/GettyImages-2231033749.jpg?resize=563,375 563w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/GettyImages-2231033749.jpg?resize=926,617 926w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/GettyImages-2231033749.jpg?resize=708,472 708w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/GettyImages-2231033749.jpg?resize=50,33 50w\" />\t\t</figure>\n\t\t</div>\n</li></ul></div>\n</div>\n<p></p><h2 id=\"h-latest-in\">Latest in Security</h2><p></p>\n</div>"

The electrified Jeep Gladiator never made it into production.</p>\n<p>The automaker will no longer include an electrified Gladiator in its Jeep lineup as it reassesses its product strategy, the company told TechCrunch in an emailed statement. The company cited changing customer preferences as a primary driver of its decision. </p>\n<p>“The Jeep Gladiator carries its rugged styling and authentic design into 2026 while adding incredible new content straight from the factory,” the statement reads. “It will continue to serve as the industry’s only open-air pickup truck, combining legendary Jeep 4×4 capability with exceptional everyday versatility. As customers’ propulsion preferences for battery-electric trucks continue to evolve, Stellantis is reassessing its product strategy and will no longer include an electrified Gladiator variant in the Jeep lineup. The Jeep brand has already begun reinvesting funding to ensure the long-term growth of the Jeep Gladiator and will introduce even more customer-requested factory features, customization, and additional powertrain options in the near future.”</p>\n<p>The Gladiator is the latest electrified vehicle hopeful to get the axe. Last week, Stellantis said it would no longer develop a battery-electric full-size pickup under its Ram brand, a vehicle that was supposed to be part of the automaker’s U.S. product offensive to sell more than <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2022/03/01/how-stellantis-plans-to-double-revenue-electrify-lineup-by-2030/\" target=\"_blank\">25 all-new BEVs</a> by the end of the decade.</p>\n<p>Stellantis cited low demand for full-size battery-electric trucks as the primary reason. The automaker will instead pursue an extended-range truck that gets an estimated 690 miles of range through a novel — but not unheard of — approach of combining a battery with a gas generator.</p>\n</div>\n\t\t\t<div>\n\t<p>Topics</p>\n</div>\n<div>\n<div><p>\n\t\tKirsten Korosec is a reporter and editor who has covered the future of transportation from EVs and autonomous vehicles to urban air mobility and in-car tech for more than a decade.

That means investors are betting on the founder, not the business. And few know how to make that call better than Hudson and Chan.

He’s built his reputation on backing people with bold ideas and unique perspectives, saying recently: <em>“The earlier you invest, the more important it is to believe in the founder’s narrative and ability to adapt. It’s not just about solving a problem — it’s about whether I believe you’re the one to do it.”</em></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/weschan\" target=\"_blank\">Wesley Chan</a>, co-founder and managing partner at FPV Ventures, is known for placing bold early bets on category-defining companies.

You could also get Gemini to help you find a movie or show when you can’t remember the title or ask about a title’s reviews to help determine if it’s worth watching.</p>\n<p>However, because it’s Gemini, you can ask any other type of question, too, just as you could with the AI chatbot on your smartphone.</p>\n<p> For instance, kids and parents could use the AI to get homework help or brainstorm school project ideas, families could use Gemini to plan their next vacation, or individual users could leverage the AI to teach themselves a new skill, among other things.</p>\n<figure><img src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Volcano_Gemini_TV-Shell.width-1000.format-webp.webp\" alt=\"a photo of a Google TV showing a response on screen showing a prompt: \"explain why volcanoes erupt to my third grader\".\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Volcano_Gemini_TV-Shell.width-1000.format-webp.webp 1000w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Volcano_Gemini_TV-Shell.width-1000.format-webp.webp?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Volcano_Gemini_TV-Shell.width-1000.format-webp.webp?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Volcano_Gemini_TV-Shell.width-1000.format-webp.webp?resize=768,432 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Volcano_Gemini_TV-Shell.width-1000.format-webp.webp?resize=680,382 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Volcano_Gemini_TV-Shell.width-1000.format-webp.webp?resize=430,242 430w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Volcano_Gemini_TV-Shell.width-1000.format-webp.webp?resize=720,405 720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Volcano_Gemini_TV-Shell.width-1000.format-webp.webp?resize=900,506 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Volcano_Gemini_TV-Shell.width-1000.format-webp.webp?resize=800,450 800w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Volcano_Gemini_TV-Shell.width-1000.format-webp.webp?resize=668,375 668w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Volcano_Gemini_TV-Shell.width-1000.format-webp.webp?resize=708,398 708w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Volcano_Gemini_TV-Shell.width-1000.format-webp.webp?resize=50,28 50w\" /></figure>\n<p>The company stresses that Gemini’s addition doesn’t mean that you won’t be able to do the same things you used to be able to do through the (non-AI) Google Assistant integration.

He was a founding member of Oracle’s cloud engineering team and has served as the president of Oracle’s cloud infrastructure business unit for more than a decade.  </p>\n<p>Sicilia has served as the president of Oracle’s industries division since June.

    "body": "<div>\n<p>On Friday, Blue Origin won a major NASA contract to deliver a lunar rover to the moon, a strong vote of confidence in both the Blue Moon lander and the future of human exploration.</p>\n<p>The contract also means that the VIPER rover will finally see the lunar surface after NASA shelved the entire program last year due to delays and cost overruns.</p>\n<p>Under the deal, Blue Origin will carry VIPER — short for “Volatiles Investigating Polar Exploration Rover” — on its uncrewed Blue Moon MK1 lander. Separately, NASA has awarded the company a human-rated lander contract under Artemis, but that program is distinct from this mission.</p>\n<p>This new award was granted under NASA’s Commercial Lunar Payload Services task order for roughly $190 million. Blue Moon MK1 is targeting a site near the lunar south pole, where scientists suspect there are significant stores of water ice. VIPER will drill down into the surface to test that hypothesis.</p>\n<p>The decision closes an uncertain chapter for VIPER. The agency first selected Pittsburgh-based <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/11/nasa-picks-astrobotic-to-deliver-its-water-hunting-robot-rover-to-the-moon/\">Astrobotic in 2020</a> to deliver the rover on its Griffin lander, an award initially valued at $199.5 million. After delays on both the rover and lander, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/07/18/nasa-cancels-450m-viper-moon-mission-dashing-ice-prospecting-dreams/\">NASA canceled VIPER in July 2024</a>, citing ballooning costs, even though much of the hardware was already built.</p>\n<p>The move drew criticism from lawmakers and scientists. One month later, NASA issued a request for ideas from U.S. companies to explore ways to put the existing rover to work without adding additional costs to the government.</p>\n<p>For Blue Origin, this win is important: This award gives the cargo workhorse lander its first high-profile scientific payload and pins it to a schedule — late 2027. It also marks a second major NASA endorsement of the company’s lunar ambitions after the Human Landing System contract.</p>\n<div>\n\t\t<p>Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t<p><span>San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>October 27-29, 2025</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n<p>About the size of a golf cart, VIPER will spend roughly 100 days on the lunar surface, driving around, prospecting and drilling to map water ice deposits.

    "body": "<div>\n<p>For years, some of the most dangerous hacking threats have come from adversarial nation-state hackers conducting espionage, Russian ransomware gangs targeting critical infrastructure, and governments targeting journalists with spyware that can punch through the security of almost any phone.  </p>\n<p>But a new phenomenon of mostly English-speaking young adults and teenage hackers has risen to become a top pressing global threat of today, spanning cybercrime, child abuse, and extremism.</p>\n<p>By tearing through some of the biggest companies, tech giants, and governments, these young and financially motivated hackers have destroyed networks and extorted hundreds of millions of dollars from wealthy corporate victims.  </p>\n<p>One of the few companies with eyes on this subculture is Unit 221B, a New Jersey-based security company that has made a name for itself by tracking these hackers and disrupting their operations where others have struggled or outright failed. </p>\n<p>Investors have taken notice of the security company. Unit 221B said it raised the $5 million seed round from J2 Ventures, whose general partner Christine Keung said in prepared remarks that the company is “the missing puzzle piece in threat disruption and attribution.” </p>\n<p>Law enforcement has been slow to combat <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/11/01/the-biggest-underestimated-security-threat-of-today-advanced-persistent-teenagers/\" target=\"_blank\">the threat from these “advanced persistent teenagers,”</a> who paved the way for some of the world’s biggest hacks to date, including dozens of corporate giants whose <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/12/31/badly-handled-data-breaches-2024/\" target=\"_blank\">Snowflake cloud accounts were hacked</a> and the <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2023/09/14/mgm-cyberattack-outage-scattered-spider/\" target=\"_blank\">ransomware attack on the MGM Resorts</a>.  </p>\n<p>In some cases, the hackers stole monumental amounts of people’s personal data and disrupted companies for lengthy spells that prompted <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/09/17/jaguar-land-rover-to-pause-production-for-third-week-due-to-cyberattack/\" target=\"_blank\">economic warnings for entire nations</a>. </p>\n<p>Unit 221B has helped break the law enforcement deadlock in multiple investigations, the company’s top brass tells TechCrunch, by securing key arrests of high-profile hackers associated with groups like Scattered Spider and the nebulous wider cybercrime community known as The Com. This is in large part thanks to its flagship threat intelligence platform eWitness and its diverse team of hackers, engineers, and forensic specialists. </p>\n<p>The company has also helped to recover legal wins and financial losses based on the findings of their investigations.  </p>\n<p>The $5 million in seed funding will be used to expand and improve its eWitness threat intelligence platform, with the aim of helping law enforcement and government investigators track and arrest malicious hackers faster. </p>\n<p>“The problems we’re solving are most acutely how the online threat landscape has evolved — youth that are able to go online and cause very high harm, both in the real world and online world, at much speed and scale, that just didn’t exist a few years ago,” Unit 221B’s chief executive May Chen-Contino tells TechCrunch.  </p>\n<p>“We’re hyper focused on that current problem,” said Chen-Contino. </p>\n<p>An invite-only software platform, eWitness collects large amounts of threat intelligence — information that can be used for tracking malicious threat actors across the web — from trusted sources, including police, journalists, and security researchers. The platform aims to make it easier for investigators to identify and track these threats, collect and preserve information for building cases, and hand off intelligence to others for additional work. </p>\n<p>The platform is also used by private companies, including the Fortune 500, who use the collected intelligence to track the threat from these groups, such as how often their brand or their industry vertical are targeted or compromised. </p>\n<p>Allison Nixon, Unit 221B’s chief research officer and a leading expert on English-speaking hacking threats, told TechCrunch that The Com is likely “going to continue to grow in the same trajectory that has been,” and that the funding will help the company further its ability to track and help investigators arrest English-speaking threats. </p>\n</div><div>\n<div>\n\t\t<p>Zack Whittaker is the security editor at TechCrunch.

But when the championship is on the line, Mr. Burns pulls eight-time National League all-star Darryl Strawberry for a substitute, Homer Simpson.</p>\n<p>“You’re a left-hander, and so is the pitcher. If I send up a right-handed batter, it’s called playing the percentages,” Mr. Burns says to Strawberry. “It’s what smart managers do to win ballgames.”</p>\n<p>High-level baseball is very mathematically-driven, with teams hiring dozens of data engineers to study granular statistics that can inform managerial decisions. But like Mr. Burns in that Simpsons episode, it’s tempting to overanalyze baseball statistics to the point of absurdity.</p>\n<p>The Oakland Ballers, an independent Pioneer League baseball team, took that concept of “playing the percentages” to the next level: they let an AI manage the team for a game.</p>\n<p>The Ballers were <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/09/08/the-coolest-startup-in-the-bay-area-is-a-baseball-team-called-the-oakland-ballers/\">founded by edtech entrepreneur Paul Freedman</a> as a salve to the departure of the beloved Oakland A’s, the Major League baseball team that owner John Fisher ripped away from local fans in what’s regarded as one of the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://abc7news.com/post/angry-sad-oakland-athletics-fans-respond-owner-john-fishers-goodbye-letter/15353346/\">most insidious</a> <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.si.com/mlb/athletics/relocation/heard-on-espn-john-fisher-is-the-worst-owner-in-sports\">managerial moves</a> in sports history. Though they’re not a Major League team, the Oakland Ballers – coyly, the Oakland B’s – established an unprecedented national community of fans who rallied around the team in protest of the A’s departure. After just two seasons, the Ballers just won Oakland’s <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://sfstandard.com/2025/09/22/oakland-ballers-title-championship-pioneer-league/\">first baseball title</a> since 1989.</p>\n<p>“The Oakland Ballers uniquely have the experience of being like a major league team in a minor league market,” Freedman told TechCrunch. “We can have creative flexibility. We can play with things and experiment with things way before the MLB or NBA or any of those leagues could do something.”</p>\n<p>Minor league baseball organizations are often called upon to test new technology before it gets implemented in the majors, like challenging calls with instant replay footage or the automated ball-strike system. The Ballers embraced this attitude, especially given Freedman’s own background in tech, but have added in a dash of whimsy, piloting things that would never actually debut in Major League Baseball.</p>\n<div>\n\t\t<p>Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t<p><span>San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>October 27-29, 2025</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n<p>Last year, this meant partnering with <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://x.com/fancontrolled?lang=en\">Fan Controlled Sports</a> to let fans make managerial decisions during one late season game. The Ballers ended up losing that game, in part because fans advocated for the funniest possible managerial decisions, rather than the savviest – at one point, the fans called upon a pitcher to pinch hit.</p>\n<p>This time around, once the team clinched their postseason berth, the Ballers partnered with the AI company <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://distillery.com/our-services/ai-development/\">Distillery</a> to commission AI software that could manage a baseball game in real time.</p>\n<p>“Baseball is the perfect place to do an initial experiment like this, because it is so data-driven, and decisions are made very analytically,” Freedman told TechCrunch. “You have the pace to be able to do something literally after every pitch.”</p>\n<p>Distillery trained OpenAI’s ChatGPT on over a century’s worth of baseball data and analytics, including Ballers games, to approximate what decisions Ballers manager Aaron Miles would make.</p>\n<p>“What the AI did was figure out what our human coach would have done – the ingenuity on strategy and the concepts came from [Miles], and the ability to use the data and recognize patterns… is what the AI did throughout the course of the game,” Freedman said. “So I think the role of human ingenuity is safe for now, and AI is a tool to be deployed to optimize decisions, but not to make them.”</p>\n<p>The AI-controlled game went smoothly – in fact, the AI made all of the same choices regarding pitching changes, lineup construction, and pinch hitters that Miles would have made. The only time that Miles had to override the AI was to replace the starting catcher with his backup, since he was sick.</p>\n<p>Miles took his temporary replacement by AI in stride – perhaps because he knows that his job is not actually in jeopardy. In a <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.instagram.com/reel/DOR5aekEhHg\">video posted to the Ballers’ Instagram</a>, Miles walks to home plate before the game to shake hands with the opposing team’s manager – only instead of offering his own hand, he extends the tablet running the AI out for a handshake.</p>\n<p>But the use of AI struck a nerve for Oakland fans, who see companies like OpenAI – which powered Distillery’s baseball AI – as enterprises that prioritize “winning” the AI race over shipping products that have been properly tested for safety. For many fans, the AI experiment felt like a betrayal, similar to the kind of corporate greed that pushed three professional sports franchises out of Oakland in five years.</p>\n<p>“There goes the Ballers trying to appeal to Bay Area techies instead of baseball fans,” one commenter wrote. “It’s so over for Oakland.”</p>\n<p>This backlash wasn’t what the Ballers expected, and Freedman does not intend to repeat this AI experiment. But the reaction of the fans models a larger cultural tension in baseball and beyond. </p>\n<p>“It never feels good to have your fans be like, ‘We hate this,’” Freedman said. “But it’s not a bad thing that there’s more of a conversation about the pluses and minuses of this new technology now, as opposed to like, a decade later when it’s too late.”</p>\n</div><div>\n<div>\n\t\t<p>Amanda Silberling is a senior writer at TechCrunch covering the intersection of technology and culture.
