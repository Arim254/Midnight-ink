    "body": "<div>\n<p>David Berg learned a lot about the waste management industry by driving a garbage truck around the country as the first employee at Ohio-based Brattle Motors. </p>\n<p>He discovered that despite the sheer number of sales prospecting platforms, selling to the waste management industry is still an offline endeavor.  </p>\n<p>“All of them had a unanimous way of going to market, which was old school ways of pen and paper, door-to-door knocking, [and] little-to-no technology on both CRM prospecting or any bit of the sales funnel,” Berg told TechCrunch. “We saw an opportunity there to be the first, not only to build within the space, but to disrupt an entire market.” </p>\n<p>Berg launched <a href=\"https://www.commanderai.com/\" target=\"_blank\">CommanderAI</a> in early 2024 as a customer relationship manager (CRM) and sales prospecting platform built for waste management — and other industrial services like dumpster rentals and industrial recyclers – to fill that gap.  </p>\n<p>Berg, who is also the CEO of CommanderAI, said that while Salesforce or HubSpot could be customized for the waste management industry, the technology is too complicated and lacks the necessary nuances about the industry to see widespread adoption. CommanderAI’s software is also better suited to the types of contracts that waste management companies use, he said.</p>\n<p>These platforms don’t have the specific types of data that waste management companies use to find customers, Berg said. Waste management companies sell to small, standalone businesses that might not have an online presence, and to new construction projects that aren’t widely advertised. CommanderAI pulls that information for its users using AI.  </p>\n<p>“Although that data is inherently available somewhere on the public web, to be able to segment it and actually repurpose it to where it’s useful took a lot of work,” Berg said. “That’s where the AI [large language model] pipeline comes in. There’s many more nuances within waste.” </p>\n<div>\n\t\t<p>Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t<p><span>San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>October 27-29, 2025</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n<p>Waste management isn’t a small industry. The U.S. waste management industry generated more than $100 billion in revenue in 2024, according to an industry trade organization. The players in the industry are a diverse mix, ranging from waste haulers with just a handful of trucks up to the $90 billion behemoth Waste Management.  </p>\n<p>“The way that we’re approaching it to them is, ‘Hey, look, we know you have a way of selling. You’ve been doing this for 20 plus years. All we’re here to do is help you sell more efficiently,’” Berg said. “’We’re not here to replace your sales team. We’re not here to change your way of doing things.’” </p>\n<p>The company’s platform is designed to work for haulers with one truck up to enterprise-size businesses, Berg said, and is currently focused on mid-to-large regional players. Currently, the company is finding success with medical and hazardous waste management companies.   </p>\n<p>CommanderAI has just raised a $5 million seed round led by 11 Tribes Ventures with participation from Watchfire Ventures, Gaingels, and Rad Fund. Berg said the company will use the capital to “pour gasoline on the fire” and bulk up the company’s sales team in addition to continuing to build out the product with features including mapping, marketing, and routing.  </p>\n<p>“Most investors, at least a list of investors, don’t have any real investments within waste management,” Berg said. “There are only around 10 active software providers in the entire industry. A lot of it was really just investor education. Here’s who we’re selling to, here’s how they operate.” </p>\n<p>The company plans to expand outside of waste management and into adjacent industries when the timing is right as well.  </p>\n<p>“We’d like to have 30% of the waste management industry using CommanderAI AI as their lead source of AI tooling and really any sort of tooling within their tech stack,” Berg said.</p>\n</div><div>\n<div>\n\t\t<p>Becca is a senior writer at TechCrunch that covers venture capital trends and startups.

While these are agents that are limited to one browser, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://composite.com/\">Composite</a> aims to build an agentic solution that helps professionals with their tasks, regardless of which browser they use.</p>\n<p>The startup was started earlier this year by Yang Fan Yun and Charlie Deane. Yun is a former product manager at Uber, while Deane founded a company selling server proxies. When he was at Uber, he realized that a lot of people around him were doing grunt work in their browsers.   </p>\n<p>“I saw people in different roles, including marketing, sales, recruitment, and security engineers, do a lot of tedious work in their browsers. I felt that this stops them from putting their education and skill to full use, and I wanted to automate this work easily for them,” Yun told TechCrunch over a call about Composite’s core problem statement.</p>\n<p>The company said today that it has raised $5.6 million in seed funding in a round led by Nat Friedman and Daniel Gross’s venture firm NFDG, with participation from Menlo Ventures and Anthropic’s Anthology Fund.</p>\n<figure><img src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Product-Screenshot.jpeg?w=680\" alt=\"A screenshot showing Composite helping a user get through tasks using AI agents.\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Product-Screenshot.jpeg 3456w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Product-Screenshot.jpeg?resize=150,97 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Product-Screenshot.jpeg?resize=300,194 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Product-Screenshot.jpeg?resize=768,496 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Product-Screenshot.jpeg?resize=680,440 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Product-Screenshot.jpeg?resize=1200,776 1200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Product-Screenshot.jpeg?resize=1280,827 1280w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Product-Screenshot.jpeg?resize=430,278 430w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Product-Screenshot.jpeg?resize=720,465 720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Product-Screenshot.jpeg?resize=900,582 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Product-Screenshot.jpeg?resize=800,517 800w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Product-Screenshot.jpeg?resize=1536,993 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Product-Screenshot.jpeg?resize=2048,1324 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Product-Screenshot.jpeg?resize=668,432 668w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Product-Screenshot.jpeg?resize=580,375 580w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Product-Screenshot.jpeg?resize=954,617 954w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Product-Screenshot.jpeg?resize=708,458 708w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Product-Screenshot.jpeg?resize=50,32 50w\" /><figcaption><span>Image Credits: Composite</span></figcaption></figure>\n<p>Composite offers its solution for Macs at the moment, and setup is very easy, as you just need to install the browser extension for agents to make use of that browser. You can issue different commands across tools that you use on the web, and Composite will get the work done. For instance, it can help you go through your Jira backlog for bugs using relevant documents, leave comments on high-priority bugs, and also mark duplicate bugs as resolved.  </p>\n<p>The startup says security engineers can use it for looking up candidates across sites and draft personalized emails, security engineers can create vulnerability tickets based on alerts, and marketers can pull reports from different sources to create short insights reports.</p>\n<p>Yun said that other AI browsers and agents from companies like OpenAI and Perplexity are solving for non-professional needs, such as helping with shopping and booking tickets. </p>\n<div>\n\t\t<p>Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t<p><span>San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>October 27-29, 2025</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n<p>“We are an ideal tool for professionals who want to set their workflows without having technical knowledge.

But in the coming months, the company is aiming to develop a better mechanism to automatically surface tasks that Composite can do on the user’s behalf. The startup is also working on a way to schedule tasks for recurring usage. </p>\n<p>The startup said that because it doesn’t need users to switch browsers, allows admins to restrict tools, execute tasks locally, and also lets users define what websites are out of bounds, its tools are better suited for professionals.</p>\n<p>There is a lot of competition in the area of having agents do work for professionals. Companies like <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/07/17/openai-launches-a-general-purpose-agent-in-chatgpt/\">OpenAI</a> that use their own browser to take actions, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/09/18/notion-launches-agents-for-data-analysis-and-task-automation/\">Notion</a> relies on users’ context within the app, combined with other connectors.

A lot of these startups are in early stages, and there are questions around AI agents’ efficiency in the long term. While investors are ready to put their money, the startups working in this area will have a lot to prove to justify it. </p>\n<p>Matt Kraning, a partner at Menlo Ventures, is confident in Composite’s ability to stand out. He told TechCrunch over a call that the tool was very intuitive to use for professionals without being overtly technical.</p>\n<p>“Composite handles different modalities and sites very well, and it is designed with professional use cases in mind.

    "body": "<div>\n<p>Browser maker Opera launched its AI-centric browser <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://operaneon.com/\">Neon</a> Tuesday, with the ability to create apps through AI prompts and create repeatable prompts through a feature it calls cards. With this Opera joins a growing number of companies like Perplexity and The Browser Company that are trying to make agentic browsers happen.</p>\n<p>The company first announced that it was <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/05/28/operas-new-browser-can-code-websites-and-games-for-you/\">working on Neon in May</a>, but the browser was in closed preview. It will now start sending invites to select people, who can use the browser for a fee of $19.99 per month.</p>\n<p>“We built Opera Neon for ourselves – and for everyone who uses AI extensively in their day-to-day. Today, we’re welcoming the first users who will help shape the future of agentic browsing with us,” said Krystian Kolondra, EVP Browsers at Opera, in a statement. </p>\n<p>There are a few key parts of the browser. First, there is a plain old chatbot that you can converse with to get answers to your questions. The more agentic feature of the browser is called Neon Do, which will help you get tasks done. For instance, it can summarize a Substack blog and post the summary to a Slack channel. As the browser has the context of your browsing history, you can also ask it to fetch details from a YouTube video you watched last week or the post that you read yesterday.</p>\n<figure><p>\n<iframe width=\"500\" height=\"281\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/MKQ98413RCI?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\"></iframe>\n</p></figure>\n<p>Opera’s new browser can also write snippets of code, which is helpful for you to create visual reports with tables and charts.

Think of this as IFTTT (IF This Then That) of AI prompting. You can combine cards like “pull-details” and “comparison-table” to create a new prompt for comparing products across tabs. Just like in Dia, you can build your own Cards or use the ones that are created by the community.</p>\n<figure><p>\n<iframe width=\"500\" height=\"281\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/Bxyx_dE7Zvc?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\"></iframe>\n</p></figure>\n<p>Opera Neon is also bringing a new tab organizational feature called Tasks, which are contained workspaces of AI chats and tabs.

The IPO was <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/03/25/cerebras-systems-ipo-is-further-delayed/\" target=\"_blank\">further delayed</a> in early 2025 due to unfilled positions in CFIUS at the beginning of President Donald Trump’s term.  </p>\n<p>Feldman said that the company still plans to IPO, but wouldn’t share specifics. He said that the company is following a common path for late-stage startups of raising a large funding round from largely public investors before listing on the public market itself.  </p>\n<p>“We chose a small number of leaders who would help us, not just in this round, but in the future,” Feldman said. “Companies that are leaders in late-stage private [fundraising], but predominantly do public. And you know, it’s our aspiration to be a public company.” </p>\n</div><div>\n<div>\n\t\t<p>Becca is a senior writer at TechCrunch that covers venture capital trends and startups.

Newsom that discouraged his signing of SB 53.</p>\n<p>The new bill comes as some of <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/08/25/silicon-valley-is-pouring-millions-into-pro-ai-pacs-to-sway-midterms/\">Silicon Valley’s tech elite</a> have poured hundreds of millions into super PACs to back candidates that support a light-touch approach to AI regulation. Leaders at OpenAI and <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/09/23/meta-launches-super-pac-to-fight-ai-regulation-as-state-policies-mount/\" target=\"_blank\">Meta</a> have in recent weeks launched pro-AI super PACs that aim to <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/08/26/meta-to-spend-tens-of-millions-on-pro-ai-super-pac/\" target=\"_blank\">back candidates</a> and bills that are friendly to AI. </p>\n<p>Still, other states might look to California for inspiration as they attempt to curb the potential harms caused by the unmitigated advancement of such a powerful emerging technology. In New York, a similar bill was passed by state lawmakers and is awaiting Gov. Kathy Hochul’s signature or veto.  </p>\n<p>“California has proven that we can establish regulations to protect our communities while also ensuring that the growing AI industry continues to thrive,” Newsom said in a statement. “This legislation strikes that balance. AI is the new frontier in innovation, and California is not only here for it — but stands strong as a national leader by enacting the first-in-the-nation frontier AI safety legislation that builds public trust as this emerging technology rapidly evolves.” </p>\n<div>\n\t\t<p>Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t<p><span>San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>October 27-29, 2025</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n<p>The governor is also weighing another bill — <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/09/11/a-california-bill-that-would-regulate-ai-companion-chatbots-is-close-to-becoming-law/\" target=\"_blank\">SB 243</a> — that passed both the State Assembly and Senate with bipartisan support this month.

    "body": "<div>\n<p>A Faraday Future electric SUV caught fire at the startup’s Los Angeles headquarters early Sunday morning, leading to an explosion that blew out part of a wall, the fire department told TechCrunch. </p>\n<p>The fire was extinguished in 40 minutes, and no injuries were reported. Damage to the building — a smaller two-story structure next to the larger portion of the headquarters (pictured above) — was severe enough that the city’s Department of Building and Safety has “red tagged” it, meaning it may need structural work before it can be occupied again.</p>\n<p>“We are aware of a fire at our facility yesterday, there were no injuries to FF staff, and no evacuation was required, and the specific cause and origin of the fire is under investigation,” John Schilling, Faraday Future’s communications director, wrote in an email to TechCrunch. </p>\n<p>In a statement <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://x.com/FaradayFuture/status/1972926658299768976\">posted to X</a> after this article was published, Faraday Future claimed the car’s battery pack “remains largely undamaged” and that the company “found no evidence that the battery pack was the cause.” Faraday Future wrote that “possible causes might include an electrical short circuit in the showroom wiring or a short circuit related to a loose connection in the vehicle’s 12V low-voltage system.” </p>\n<p>The company also noted that the vehicle was an early engineering prototype with “interior materials [that] do not meet the flammability standards of production vehicles.” </p>\n<p>The fire comes at an awkward time for Faraday Future because its continued presence at the headquarters — which it has occupied for a decade — is uncertain. </p>\n<p>The startup, which has struggled financially for years, <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/20/18269081/faraday-future-sold-headquarters-la-leasing-ev-electric-car\" target=\"_blank\">sold the headquarters in 2019 to generate cash</a> and has leased it ever since. Current owner Rexford Industrial sued Faraday Future in February 2024 in an attempt to <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/02/16/faraday-future-headquarters-rent/\">evict the startup over late payments</a>. The two sides ultimately <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/04/03/faraday-future-avoids-eviction-at-its-la-headquarters-for-now/\">settled in April 2024</a>. At the time of that settlement, the lease was set to expire at the end of September 2025. </p>\n<div>\n\t\t<p>Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t<p><span>San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>October 27-29, 2025</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n<p>Schilling, when asked, said he was unsure of the current status of Faraday Future’s lease. The property, including the main building and the one where the fire occurred, is <a href=\"https://www.cbre.com/properties/properties-for-lease/industrial/details/US-SMPL-175591/18455-s-figueroa-st-501-w-190th-st-18455-south-figueroa-street-gardena-ca-90248\" target=\"_blank\">being advertised as available for lease by commercial real estate company CBRE</a>. Representatives for CBRE and Rexford did not immediately respond to requests for comment.</p>\n<p>The blaze was first reported to the Los Angeles Fire Department (LAFD) at 4:37 a.m. local time on September 28. LAFD spokesperson Brian Humphrey told TechCrunch the 911 call came from an eyewitness. Sprinklers in the building helped keep the fire in check until the fire department arrived. An explosion created a major bulge in at least one of the walls, according to a photo viewed by TechCrunch.</p>\n<p>Once they arrived, firefighters had to force entry to battle the flames, Humphrey said. The fire was fully extinguished at 5:17 a.m.   </p>\n<p>The specific cause and origin of the FF91 SUV fire have not yet been determined, Humphrey said, noting that fire department investigators did not identify any “human factors.” The FF91 SUV was on display in the office space.</p>\n<p>After the fire was extinguished, an inspector from the Los Angeles Department of Building and Safety evaluated the structure and determined it unfit for occupancy.</p>\n<p>Faraday Future first unveiled the FF91 SUV in 2017. At the time, it was billed as an ultra-luxury electric vehicle with industry-leading range. But the company ran into repeated financial crises, and only started building the <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-03-30/faraday-future-starts-production-of-long-delayed-electric-suvs\" target=\"_blank\">first few production SUVs in 2023</a>. </p>\n<p>Since then, the company has delivered a few more than a dozen FF91s to celebrities and high net worth individuals, although Faraday Future has been accused by employee whistleblowers of <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/04/09/faraday-lawsuit-fake-sales-whistleblowers-retaliation/\" target=\"_blank\">misrepresenting those sales</a>. </p>\n<p>The company is now promoting a more affordable electric van that it appears to be importing from China, and is also trying to spin up a <a href=\"https://app-us.ff.com/ff-v3/news/1273?lang=en-US\" target=\"_blank\">crypto-focused business</a>.

At the time, Nothing CEO Carl Pei said the company wanted to build an operating system with AI-powered features, alongside developing new AI-centric devices.</p>\n<p>In a conversation with TechCrunch last week, Pei said smartphone makers are reluctant to change software.</p>\n<p>“Something that has always bothered me is why we aren’t improving software? A lot of people look at what big companies like Apple do, and follow that because that is the safer path. I think software iteration is very slow,” Pei said.</p>\n<p>“With breakthroughs in AI, we believe that operating systems will change and become more personal. Our devices have so much context on us, but that is not being leveraged right now,” he added.</p>\n<div>\n\t\t<p>Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t<p><span>San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>October 27-29, 2025</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n<p>That said, Nothing has so far only launched one AI-enabled app: <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/07/08/nothing-phone-3-review/\">Essential Space</a> lets users share screenshots, record voice notes, and get transcription for meetings. It’s worth noting that most modern smartphone operating systems today can do all of that and more, and if they can’t, there’s nothing to stop users from simply installing AI apps on their phones. </p>\n<figure><img src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Screenshot-2025-09-30-at-1.43.16PM.jpg?w=680\" alt=\"A Screenshot showing Essential apps created by the Nothing community\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Screenshot-2025-09-30-at-1.43.16PM.jpg 1895w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Screenshot-2025-09-30-at-1.43.16PM.jpg?resize=150,69 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Screenshot-2025-09-30-at-1.43.16PM.jpg?resize=300,137 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Screenshot-2025-09-30-at-1.43.16PM.jpg?resize=768,352 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Screenshot-2025-09-30-at-1.43.16PM.jpg?resize=680,311 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Screenshot-2025-09-30-at-1.43.16PM.jpg?resize=1200,550 1200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Screenshot-2025-09-30-at-1.43.16PM.jpg?resize=1280,586 1280w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Screenshot-2025-09-30-at-1.43.16PM.jpg?resize=430,197 430w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Screenshot-2025-09-30-at-1.43.16PM.jpg?resize=720,330 720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Screenshot-2025-09-30-at-1.43.16PM.jpg?resize=900,412 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Screenshot-2025-09-30-at-1.43.16PM.jpg?resize=800,366 800w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Screenshot-2025-09-30-at-1.43.16PM.jpg?resize=1536,704 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Screenshot-2025-09-30-at-1.43.16PM.jpg?resize=668,306 668w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Screenshot-2025-09-30-at-1.43.16PM.jpg?resize=1347,617 1347w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Screenshot-2025-09-30-at-1.43.16PM.jpg?resize=708,324 708w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Screenshot-2025-09-30-at-1.43.16PM.jpg?resize=50,23 50w\" /><figcaption><span>A Screenshot showing Essential apps created by the community.

According to data from analytics firm IDC, the company has less than 1% share of the worldwide smartphone market. </p>\n<p>But Pei feels Nothing’s position is advantageous. He has said previously that the company wants to build hardware specifically for using AI, and if it can get it right on smartphones, building hardware with specific use cases would be easier.</p>\n<p>Vibe coding is promising on paper, but so far, apps that have tried to offer similar functionality on smartphones <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/09/23/dedicated-mobile-apps-for-vibe-coding-have-so-far-failed-to-gain-traction/\">haven’t taken off</a>, per data from analytics firm AppFigures, mostly due to <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.intigriti.com/researchers/blog/hacking-tools/vibe-coding-security-vulnerabilities\">security</a> and <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/09/14/vibe-coding-has-turned-senior-devs-into-ai-babysitters-but-they-say-its-worth-it/\">maintenance</a> concerns. Pei acknowledged this and said maintaining security while allowing developers to create apps will be crucial going forward.</p>\n<p>“We have millions of users on our devices. So whatever we ship should be easy to use and hard to make a mistake on. That is why, for us, maintaining a level of security with these apps will be important,” he said. </p>\n<p>At the moment, the company isn’t charging for these AI tools, and a paid tier doesn’t seem to be in the works right now.

    "body": "<div>\n<p>Job seekers in all fields can expect to soon be doing a lot more initial screening interviews. While that may sound like positive news, it doesn’t mean that there will suddenly be more open positions.</p>\n<p>Instead, recruiters, often bogged down with determining which applicants are qualified for the next round, will outsource the routine screening tasks — like checking backgrounds, salary needs, and availability — to (you guessed it) AI.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.alex.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Alex</a>, a startup building an AI recruiter, says it’s already helping companies conduct video interviews and phone screens.</p>\n<p>Aaron Wang (pictured center, bottom row), who co-founded Alex about 18 months ago, told TechCrunch that the startup’s voice AI tool can conduct autonomous interviews with applicants soon after they apply for a job. “Our AI recruiter does thousands of interviews a day and helps people get hired at some of the biggest companies in the world,” he said.</p>\n<p>Although Wang, who previously worked at Facebook and spent time as a quant for a hedge fund, declined to name customers, he said they include Fortune 100 companies, financial institutions, nationwide restaurant chains, and Big 4 accounting firms.</p>\n<p>Investors view the rise of AI interviewers as a trend that many companies will inevitably adopt. That conviction led to Alex’s new $17 million Series A round, which was led by Peak XV Partners. The round included participation from Y Combinator and Uncorrelated Ventures, along with several chief human resources officers (CHROs) from unnamed Fortune 500 companies, and others. This Series A follows the company’s $3 million seed funding, which was led by 1984 Ventures last year.</p>\n<p>Alex isn’t alone in offering AI recruiting services to companies.
