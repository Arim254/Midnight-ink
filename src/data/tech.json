YouTube TV reportedly now has around <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2025/09/25/youtube-tv-nbcuniversal-impending-carriage-dispute.html\" target=\"_blank\">10 million subscribers</a>, in large part due to is live sports-related content. Hulu Live TV and Fubo together have about 6 million subscribers, so this merger is a step toward closing that competitive gap. </p>\n<p>Additionally, if executed well, it could offer sports fans more flexible options. For instance, sources suggest that Fubo may be exploring the idea of introducing a new Hulu-branded package as a perk for streamers, featuring access to Disney’s trio of streaming services (Disney+, Hulu, and ESPN) at no additional cost. The company recently <a href=\"https://thedesk.net/2025/08/fubo-sports-launch-hulu-live-tv-app/\" target=\"_blank\">announced</a> the launch of a skinny sports-only package at a lower price point.</p>\n<p>However, the approval obtained at the Fubo shareholder meeting on Tuesday still awaits regulatory approvals, as the deal will create a larger entity and impact market competition, reducing the number of independent streaming players.</p>\n<p>Once the transaction is finalized, Disney will own approximately 70% of Fubo. However, possibly with those regulatory approvals in mind, Fubo promises it will continue to be available to viewers as an independent offering. That said, Disney is consolidating this unit under a single leader: David Gandler, co-founder and CEO of Fubo, who will oversee the newly merged Fubo and Hulu Live TV operations.</p>\n</div>\n\t\t\t<div>\n\t<p>Topics</p>\n</div>\n<div>\n<div>\n\t\t<p>Lauren covers media, streaming, apps and platforms at TechCrunch.</p>\n<p>You can contact or verify outreach from Lauren by emailing <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:laurenf.techcrunch@gmail.com\">laurenf.techcrunch@gmail.com</a> or via encrypted message at laurenforris22.25 on Signal.</p>\t</div>\n\t<p>\n\t\t<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/author/lauren-forristal/\">View Bio <svg></svg></a>\n\t</p>\n</div>\n\t\t</div>"

But according to Venmo, this is changing in November.</p>\n<p>“Venmo users and PayPal users will be able to pay each other in the U.S. and worldwide,” Venmo wrote in an email to customers. “That means that PayPal users will be able to find and pay you using your phone number, and later using your email address.” </p>\n<p>For years, customers have used <a href=\"https://wise.com/us/blog/venmo-to-paypal\" target=\"_blank\">convoluted</a> <a href=\"https://www.remitfinder.com/blog/how-to-transfer-money-from-venmo-to-paypal\" target=\"_blank\">workarounds</a> to transfer money between the services.

(Perhaps integrating the two services would discourage users from creating accounts on both platforms, disincentivizing PayPal to enable this feature sooner.)</p>\n<p>This change means that PayPal users will now be able to find Venmo users by inputting their phone numbers, and later, their email addresses.

    "body": "<div>\n<p><a href=\"https://periodic.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Periodic Labs</a> came out of stealth on Tuesday with a war chest of $300 million as a seed round, backed by a tech industry who’s who: Andreessen Horowitz, DST, Nvidia, Accel, Elad Gil, Jeff Dean, Eric Schmidt, and Jeff Bezos.</p>\n<p>Periodic Labs was founded by Ekin Dogus Cubuk and Liam Fedus. Cubuk led the materials and chemistry team at Google Brain and DeepMind, where one of his projects was, for instance, an AI tool called GNoME. That tool <a href=\"https://deepmind.google/discover/blog/millions-of-new-materials-discovered-with-deep-learning/\" target=\"_blank\">discovered over 2 million new crystals in 2023</a>, materials that could one day be used to power new generations of technology, researchers say.</p>\n<p>Fedus is a former VP of Research at OpenAI, and one of the researchers who helped create ChatGPT. He also led the team that created the <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2101.03961\" target=\"_blank\">first trillion-parameter neural network</a>.</p>\n<p>Its small team is likewise filled with researchers who have worked on other major AI and materials science projects, from building OpenAI’s agent Operator to working on Microsoft’s MatterGen, an LLM materials science discovery AI.</p>\n<p>The goal of Periodic Labs is nothing less than to automate scientific discovery, creating AI scientists, the company says. This means building labs where robots conduct physical experiments, collect data, iterate, and try again, learning and improving as they go.</p>\n<p>The lab’s first goal is to invent new superconductors that it hopes perform better and possibly require less energy than existing superconducting materials. But the well-funded startup also hopes to find other new materials.</p>\n<p>Another goal is to collect all the physical world data that its AI scientists produce as they mix and heat and otherwise manipulate various powers and raw materials in their search for something new.</p>\n<div>\n\t\t<p>Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t<p><span>San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>October 27-29, 2025</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n<p>“Until now, scientific AI advances have come from models trained on the internet” and LLMs have “exhausted” the internet as a source that can be consumed, the company says in an introductory <a href=\"https://periodic.com/\" target=\"_blank\">blog post</a>. “[A]t Periodic, we are building AI scientists <em>and</em> the autonomous laboratories for them to operate.”</p>\n<p>The hope is that, not only will the labs invent next-generation materials, but they will produce invaluable fresh data that AI models can consume to continue their evolution.</p>\n<p>While this might be one of the most impressive groups of researchers to assemble a startup for this purpose, it’s not the only one working on AI scientists. AI as a tool to automate chemistry discoveries has been a <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.06949\" target=\"_blank\">topic of academic research since at least 2023</a>. It is the pursuit of tiny startups like <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/12/22/tetsuwan-scientific-is-making-robotic-ai-scientists-that-can-run-experiments-on-their-own/\">Tetsuwan Scientific</a>, as well as nonprofits like <a href=\"https://www.futurehouse.org/\" target=\"_blank\">Future House</a> and the University of Toronto’s <a href=\"https://acceleration.utoronto.ca/\" target=\"_blank\">Acceleration Consortium</a>.</p>\n</div>"

Several apps like this have cropped up over the years, including <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/03/anonymous-snapchat-app-sendit-surges-with-3-5m-installs-after-snap-bans-yolo-and-lmk/\">YOLO and LMK</a>, which were suspended on Snapchat in 2021 due to a lawsuit over a child’s suicide. After that suspension, Sendit quickly gained <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/03/anonymous-snapchat-app-sendit-surges-with-3-5m-installs-after-snap-bans-yolo-and-lmk/\">3.5 million downloads</a>, as users flocked to the app to replace those that were no longer available.</p>\n<p>By the following year, TechCrunch <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2022/06/29/anonymous-social-apps-shift-their-attention-to-instagram-in-the-wake-of-snapchats-ban/\">reporting</a> found that the newer anonymous question apps, like Sendit and <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2022/08/04/top-anonymous-social-app-ngl-forced-to-stop-tricking-its-users/\">LMK</a>, were misleading users with fake messages, then offering in-app purchases to reveal who sent the messages.</p>\n<p>This reporting was echoed in the FTC’s complaint, which stated that Sendit sent users fake, provocative messages (like “would you ever get with me?” or “have you done drugs?”).</p>\n<p>If a user wanted to see who sent a message, they could spend $9.99 for a “Diamond Membership,” but the FTC claims that it was not clear that this was a recurring weekly payment, and not a one-time cost. If a user revealed the “identity” behind a message that was actually submitted by Sendit, they would be given false information.</p>\n<p>The FTC also accused Sendit of knowingly collecting data on users under the age of 13 without parental consent, which is illegal under <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Children%27s_Online_Privacy_Protection_Act\" target=\"_blank\">COPPA</a> (Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act). In particular, the FTC cited an instance from 2022 when more than 116,000 users reported that they were under 13, but Sendit parent Iconic Hearts did not notify parents that it had collected this data, nor did it ask for permission.</p>\n<p>That same year, TechCrunch found that Sendit users were complaining in App Store reviews that the Sendit for Instagram app had solicited downloads by marketing itself as “Sendit Reveal,” an app that would “reveal” who sent them anonymous messages. </p>\n<p>At the time, when TechCrunch asked Sendit founder Hunter Rice about these dark patterns, he suggested that we were looking for clickbait.</p>\n<p>“There’s a lot of great things about what we’re doing that are newsworthy,” Rice <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2022/06/29/anonymous-social-apps-shift-their-attention-to-instagram-in-the-wake-of-snapchats-ban/\">told TechCrunch</a> in 2022. “You’re welcome to have your fun with this topic, but I’m only interested in talking about real news.”</p>\n<p>Sendit <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2022/07/15/not-gonna-lie-this-ngl-lawsuit-is-kinda-juicy/\">also sued a competitor, NGL</a>, in 2022, saying it stole the idea of the fake, anonymous questions and other trade secrets. NGL was <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2022/08/04/top-anonymous-social-app-ngl-forced-to-stop-tricking-its-users/\">later forced to end the practice</a> in order to remain in the App Store, following TechCrunch’s reporting.  </p>\n</div><div>\n<div>\n\t\t<p>Amanda Silberling is a senior writer at TechCrunch covering the intersection of technology and culture.

For instance, just yesterday OpenAI announced a plan to take on Amazon and Google with <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/09/29/openai-takes-on-google-amazon-with-new-agentic-shopping-system/\">its own agentic shopping system,</a> which includes an “Instant Checkout” feature.</p>\n<p>While OpenAI’s system initially only supports Etsy with plans for Shopify merchants “soon,” it’s a signal of what’s to come in the AI era. Instead of browsing the web or Amazon when looking for products and recommendations, users may start their shopping research in an AI chatbot, instead of just browsing the web, where Honey previously had traction, necessitating new products like this.  </p>\n<div>\n\t\t<p>Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t<p><span>San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>October 27-29, 2025</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n<p>The AI features are launching after quite a <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/24343913/paypal-honey-megalag-coupon-scam-affiliate-fees\" target=\"_blank\">bit of bad press</a> for Honey.

    "body": "<div>\n<p>Toyota is looking for the next new thing in mobility, climate, AI, and industrial automation. Its answer is $1.5 billion in new capital that will focus on, and invest in, the life cycle of startups — from the first seeds of an invention through its growth stage and eventually to mature companies.</p>\n<p>Toyota made two related announcements Tuesday that provide a snapshot of the company’s growing interest in the startup ecosystem. It also hints at how those startups, and their inventions, may play a part in Woven City, a prototype city located on a 175-acre site at the foot of Mount Fuji in Japan designed to incubate startups and that <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/01/06/toyotas-woven-city-is-open-for-business-and-looking-for-startups/\">opened this year</a>. </p>\n<p>The Japanese automaker said Tuesday it has created a strategic investment subsidiary called Toyota Invention Partners Co. with about $670 million in capital, while its growth-stage venture arm Woven Capital launched a second $800 million fund. </p>\n<p>The Toyota Invention Partners subsidiary will take a long-term strategy focused on Japan-based startups, eschewing the traditional fixed investment periods found in other funds. Woven Capital general partner George Kellerman described Toyota Invention Partners Co. as a bookend of sorts to the company’s other investment organizations.</p>\n<p>“One way to think about them (Toyota Invention Partners) is they’re bookending what Toyota Ventures and Woven Capital are doing,” Kellerman said in a phone interview. “They’re doing the really early stage on one end, but then they’re maybe doing these longer-term project finance, asset management type of infrastructure investments, that might be a 30-, 40-, 50-year type of investment.”</p>\n<p>Toyota Invention Partners is at the “zero to one” stage, Toyota Ventures covers early-stage, and Woven Capital handles growth stage, he explained. But Toyota Invention Partners may also stick with a startup throughout all of these stages, and if it really scales, it’ll go to the balance sheet of Toyota, Kellerman added.</p>\n<p>Kellerman said the two announcements reflect Toyota’s interest in startups — and the tech and innovation that is coming out of them.</p>\n<div>\n\t\t<p>Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t<p><span>San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>October 27-29, 2025</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n<p>“The thing that really excites me is that Toyota is clearly leaning in; they’re committing over $3 billion across Toyota Invention Partners, Woven Capital’s fund one and two, and all of Toyota Ventures funds,” he said. “And it’s really about making sure that we can serve the needs of the market and the founders that we’re working with, because their needs change depending on their stage.”</p>\n<p>This strategy is illustrated in another investment announcement that was made Tuesday. Machina Labs, a Los Angeles-based advanced manufacturing startup that combines AI and robotics to rapidly produce metal structures, announced a strategic investment from Woven Capital and a pilot project with Toyota Motor North America. The automaker will test Machina Labs’ manufacturing technology to produce automotive body panels and accessories. Woven Capital and Machina Labs didn’t disclose the investment amount or terms.</p>\n<p>Woven Capital, which launched in 2021 with an $800 million fund, is still focused on investing in global startups that are entering into a growth stage. The firm has invested in 18 companies from the first fund, including Foretellix and autonomous vehicle technology startup Nuro. It will continue to pull capital from the first fund to support follow-on investments. </p>\n<p>This second fund, which is also $800 million, will target 20 to 25 new investments in Series B to late-stage companies working on advancing AI, automation, climate technology, energy, sustainability, and more. As part of the new fund announcement, Woven Capital has also been made a wholly owned subsidiary of Toyota.</p>\n</div><div>\n<div><p>\n\t\tKirsten Korosec is a reporter and editor who has covered the future of transportation from EVs and autonomous vehicles to urban air mobility and in-car tech for more than a decade.

    "body": "<div>\n<p>On Tuesday, OpenAI <a href=\"https://openai.com/index/sora-2/\" target=\"_blank\">announced</a> the release of Sora 2, an audio and video generator to succeed last year’s <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/12/09/openais-sora-is-launching-today-heres-highlights-from-the-first-review/\">Sora</a>. Along with the model, the company also launched a linked social app called Sora, where users can generate videos of themselves and their friends to share on a TikTok-style algorithmic feed. OpenAI’s work on a new social platform was <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/story/openai-launches-sora-2-tiktok-like-app/\" target=\"_blank\">previously reported by Wired</a>.</p>\n<p>While we haven’t been able to test the invite-only app and Sora 2 model ourselves yet, OpenAI has shared impressive examples. In particular, Sora 2 is better at following the laws of physics, making the videos more realistic. OpenAI’s public clips depict a beach volleyball game, skateboard tricks, gymnastics routines, and cannonball jumps from a diving board, among others.</p>\n<figure></figure>\n<p>“Prior video models are overoptimistic — they will morph objects and deform reality to successfully execute upon a text prompt,” OpenAI wrote in <a href=\"https://openai.com/index/sora-2/\" target=\"_blank\">a blog post</a>. “For example, if a basketball player misses a shot, the ball may spontaneously teleport to the hoop. In Sora 2, if a basketball player misses a shot, it will rebound off the backboard.”</p>\n<p>The Sora app comes with an “upload yourself” feature called “cameos,” which allows users to drop themselves into any Sora-generated scenes. In order to use their own likeness in a generated video, users will have to upload a one-time video-and-audio recording to verify their identity and capture their appearance.</p>\n<p>This feature also allows users to share their “cameos” with their friends, allowing them to give other users permission to include their likeness in videos that they generate, including videos of multiple people together.</p>\n<p>“We think a social app built around this ‘cameos’ feature is the best way to experience the magic of Sora 2,” the company wrote.</p>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://apps.apple.com/us/app/sora-by-openai/id6744034028\" target=\"_blank\">Sora iOS app</a> is available to download now and will initially roll out in the U.S. and Canada, though OpenAI says it hopes to expand quickly to other countries. While the Sora social platform is currently invite-only, ChatGPT Pro users should be able to try out the Sora 2 Pro model without an invite.</p>\n<div>\n\t\t<p>Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t<p><span>San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>October 27-29, 2025</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n<p>Once videos are generated, they can be shared in a feed within the Sora app, which seems like it’ll be similar to TikTok, Instagram Reels, or other short-form video feeds. Interestingly, Meta announced just last week that it added a video feed called “<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/09/25/meta-launches-vibes-a-short-form-video-feed-of-ai-slop/\">Vibes</a>” to its Meta AI app (it’s basically all mindless slop).</p>\n<p>To curate its algorithmic recommendations, OpenAI will consider a user’s Sora activity, their location (attained via their IP address), their past post engagement, and their ChatGPT conversation history, though that can be turned off. The Sora app also ships with parental controls via ChatGPT, which allow parents to override infinite scroll limits, turn off algorithmic personalization, and manage who can direct message their child. However, these features are only as powerful as the parent’s technical know-how. </p>\n<p>The Sora app will be free at launch, which OpenAI says is “so people can freely explore its capabilities.” The company says that at launch, the only plan for monetization is to charge users to generate extra videos in times of high demand.</p>\n<p>The launch of a social platform will require significant user safety measures from OpenAI, which has <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/09/29/openai-rolls-out-safety-routing-system-parental-controls-on-chatgpt/\">struggled with the same issues</a> in ChatGPT. While users can revoke access to their likeness at any time, this sort of access can easily be abused. Even if a user trusts someone they know with access to their AI likeness, that person could still generate deceptive content that could be used to harm that person. Non-consensual videos are a persistent problem with AI-generated video, causing significant harm with <a href=\"https://digitalcommons.law.byu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=3564&context=lawreview\" target=\"_blank\">few laws explicitly governing platform responsibility</a>.</p>\n</div><div>\n<div>\n\t\t<p>Amanda Silberling is a senior writer at TechCrunch covering the intersection of technology and culture.

    "body": "<div>\n<p>Starbase is a city without a police department, but not without police.</p>\n<p>For months, Cameron County sheriff’s deputies have patrolled the roads and beaches surrounding SpaceX’s sprawling rocket facility in South Texas. Now, less than a year after <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/05/04/residents-of-spacexs-starbase-launch-site-vote-to-incorporate-as-a-city/\">Starbase residents voted to incorporate</a>, the city has signed formal agreements making those deputies its de facto police force and Cameron County jails the destination for anyone arrested within city limits.</p>\n<p>The two interlocal deals, approved in September and effective beginning Wednesday, are sweeping. One requires Cameron County to dedicate eight deputies to Starbase, though only two will patrol the city during a single shift.</p>\n<p>The other sees Cameron County providing “jail services,” with Starbase agreeing to pay $100 per day per inmate and to reimburse the county for additional expenses, like medical care or psychiatric services for inmates.  </p>\n<p>It’s a way of standing up a criminal justice system overnight, without having to build one from scratch. Such arrangements are not unheard of in Texas, especially for the myriad small or newly incorporated towns that may not be able to stand up a full police department on their own.</p>\n<p>But Starbase is not a typical town. The population is small, and most of the residents work for SpaceX. The city itself was finalized only after SpaceX bought up old properties in Boca Chica Village and spread its launch-and-manufacturing activities further afield.</p>\n<p>The law enforcement contract sets up more than just routine patrols. Starbase can also opt to pay for security during “special events” — likely rocket launches, when thousands of spectators descend on the small beach town of Boca Chica to watch Starship’s spectacular flights.</p>\n<div>\n\t\t<p>Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t<p><span>San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>October 27-29, 2025</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n<p>The clause allowing extra police for special events is a shrewd move, and it reinforces the idea that Starbase is not a traditional municipality, but a company town built around one purpose: getting Starship flying — frequently.</p>\n<p>The agreement reinforces this fact. While Starbase has its own mayor and commissioners, public safety is carried out by Cameron County. Body camera footage and other records remain with the county, per the agreement, and Starbase residents who have an issue with the local policing will have to take it up with their next-door neighbors. For now, SpaceX has built a town of its own, but the power to enforce laws is still with someone else.</p>\n</div><div>\n<div>\n\t\t<p>Aria Alamalhodaei covers the space and defense industries at TechCrunch.

The equity stakes will be acquired through no-cost warrants, which are financial instruments that give the government the right to purchase shares at a set price. The new terms came out of a renegotiation with the DOE’s Loan Programs Office<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/09/24/trump-administration-wants-10-stake-in-canadian-lithium-miner-that-sells-to-gm/\"> over a $2.26 billion loan</a> that was awarded to Lithium Americas under the Biden Administration.</p>\n<p>Shares of Lithium Americas spiked 34% in after-hours trading.</p>\n<p>The DOE said the equity stakes will serve as additional collateral on the loan, helping to reduce repayment risk for taxpayers. Lithium is a key chemical element that is used in the batteries of electric vehicles and smartphones.</p>\n<p>“Despite having some of the largest deposits, the United States produces less than 1% percent of the global supply of lithium. Thanks to President Trump’s bold leadership, American lithium production is going to skyrocket,” U.S. Energy Secretary Chris Wright said in a press release. “Today’s announcement helps reduce our dependence on foreign adversaries for critical minerals by strengthening domestic supply chains and ensures better stewardship of American taxpayer dollars. President Trump promised to do both and he is delivering.”</p>\n<p>The announcement Tuesday is the latest action by the Trump administration to take ownership stakes in companies. The Trump administration has announced plans to take a <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/08/22/u-s-government-plans-to-take-a-10-stake-in-intel/\">10% stake in Intel</a> and MP Materials, which operates a rare earth minerals mine in the United States.</p>\n<p>Lithium Americas is developing the Thacker Pass mine in Nevada, which is expected to produce enough lithium to make as many as 800,000 electric vehicles per year in the first phase.

The Echo Studio also includes a high-excursion woofer, spatial audio, and Dolby Atmos, and an upgraded light ring for better visual understanding of what Alexa is doing or processing.</p>\n<p>The company notes consumers can connect up to five Echo Studio or Echo Dot Max devices with compatible Fire TV sticks for an immersive sound system in their home, and it plans to sell products in Alexa Home Theater bundles. </p>\n<figure><img src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/download-1.jpeg\" alt=\"a photo of a new Amazon Echo Show featuring a display with a photo of a dog on a rug.\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/download-1.jpeg 1243w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/download-1.jpeg?resize=150,90 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/download-1.jpeg?resize=300,179 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/download-1.jpeg?resize=768,459 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/download-1.jpeg?resize=680,406 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/download-1.jpeg?resize=1200,717 1200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/download-1.jpeg?resize=430,257 430w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/download-1.jpeg?resize=720,430 720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/download-1.jpeg?resize=900,538 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/download-1.jpeg?resize=800,478 800w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/download-1.jpeg?resize=668,399 668w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/download-1.jpeg?resize=627,375 627w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/download-1.jpeg?resize=1032,617 1032w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/download-1.jpeg?resize=708,423 708w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/download-1.jpeg?resize=50,30 50w\" /><figcaption><span><strong>Image Credits:</strong>Amazon</span></figcaption></figure>\n<p>Also new are two smart displays, the Echo Show 8 ($179.99) and Echo Show 11 ($219.99), which both have a new design, improved picture quality, a 13-megapixel camera, a larger screen area, new front-facing stereo speakers, a custom woofer, and Alexa+ powered features. </p>\n<p>The AI assistant will run a new smart home experience called Alexa+ Home, which combines things like event summaries from Ring camera feeds and a smart home hub that supports Matter, Thread, and Zigbee. </p>\n<p>As Alexa devices with a screen, the displays also work well for accessing entertainment, like streaming audio and video, managing home organization and family activities, and managing household shopping needs. The latter integrates with Amazon, Whole Foods, and Amazon Fresh to make reordering favorites and delivery tracking easier.</p>\n<p>Plus, Amazon is teaming up with smart ring maker Oura to bring personalized health and wellness suggestions to Alexa devices. This could help do things like add workout reminders or nudges to head to bed to get the best sleep. </p>\n<p>Other devices from Withings and Wyze will be supported in the future.</p>\n</div>"
