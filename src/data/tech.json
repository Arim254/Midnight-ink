    "body": "<div>\n<p>Just south of Seoul, in the city of Seongnam, sits what many call the “Silicon Valley of South Korea”: the sprawling tech complex known as Pangyo Techno Valley (PTV), which is just a 15-minute subway ride from Gangnam, better known for its luxury boutiques, K-pop agencies, and neon nightlife in Seoul. </p>\n<p>Since launching in 2011, the 661,000-square-meter development has evolved into one of the country’s most significant innovation hubs. It’s home to more than 1,800 startups, research centers, and global tech firms, all packed into a district that feels more like a laboratory for South Korea’s future than a suburb of Seoul.</p>\n<p>Big names are everywhere in Pangyo Techno Valley, including Naver, often described as Korea’s Google, and Kakao, the country’s everything-app. Gaming powerhouses Nexon and NCSoft anchor the district alongside industrial heavyweights like shipbuilder HD Hyundai and cybersecurity pioneer AhnLab. Samsung Electronics, semiconductor giant SK Hynix, and Hyundai’s autonomous vehicle division 42dot all maintain significant presences. Yet despite this concentration of tech talent and capital, industry insiders question whether Pangyo truly deserves its Silicon Valley comparison.</p>\n<p>“Pangyo is absolutely Korea’s most concentrated hub for software, gaming, platforms, and AI,” says Hyoungchul Choi, CEO of Portologics, who founded his company there five years ago. But he’s skeptical of the Silicon Valley label. “The nickname is convenient, but we shouldn’t overstate our global influence. Silicon Valley isn’t just about density—it’s built on decades of international capital flows, risk-taking culture, and its ability to attract talent worldwide. We’re not there yet.”</p>\n<p>The statistics back up this more modest assessment. As of a year ago, Pangyo Techno Valley was predominantly home to smaller players, with approximately 91.5% of its companies being small and mid-size businesses, with big tech accounting for just 3.6% and the remaining 4.9% made up of public or government organizations, according to PTV’s  <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.pangyotechnovalley.org/base/board/read?boardManagementNo=19&boardNo=2728&menuLevel=2&menuNo=58\">official website</a>.</p>\n<p>Janice Sa, a principal at Z Venture Capital, who has been working in Pangyo for more than a decade, sees the district’s influence waning.</p>\n<p>“With giants like Kakao, Naver, Nexon, and NCSoft all in one place,” the PTV’s title of Korea’s Silicon Valley “still makes sense,” she says. But compared to ten years ago, the district doesn’t feel quite as dominant as the country’s go-to tech hub, Sa said. “Back then, startups were flocking to Pangyo. Today, many are heading back to Gangnam [in Seoul].” The reasons, she added, boil down to talent and capital. “Young developers and engineers still gravitate toward Gangnam, and most venture capital firms are packed along Teheran Street, the city’s main tech corridor lined with startups, big tech offices, and investors. For hiring and fundraising, that makes Gangnam the easier choice.”</p>\n<div>\n\t\t<p>Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t<p><span>San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>October 27-29, 2025</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n<p>That exodus reflects a broader challenge. For big corporations tied to long-term leases with tax incentives, being in Pangyo isn’t much of an issue, Sa noted. But for startups competing for talent, the location can be a greater challenge. Pangyo might be only a short ride from Gangnam, but it’s still in Gyeonggi Province, not Seoul. And because government support programs are often tied to local jurisdictions, Seoul ends up with more active startup infrastructure and stronger global initiatives.</p>\n<p>An insider at a Pangyo-based tech firm, who asked not to be named, shared a similar perspective. With so many tech companies in one place, Pangyo has developed a culture that feels naturally geared toward the industry. “When you’re working in tech here, collaboration comes easier—everyone’s just around the corner,” he said. But Seoul is “more diverse. For example, Yeouido is Korea’s Wall Street, perfect for fintechs, while Gangnam draws startups of every kind.”</p>\n<p>The bigger question is whether Korean startups, regardless of location, can compete globally. Both government and private investors are pushing companies to expand internationally as the domestic market saturates. Yet breakthrough success stories remain elusive.</p>\n<p>A Kakao Ventures investor highlights cultural differences that may explain the gap. “American startups tend to succeed — and fail — much faster, which fuels constant experimentation and a high rate of talent movement. Speed is a startup’s greatest strength, so I try to have open conversations with founders about how to turn failure into opportunity,” the investor said.</p>\n<p>Storytelling is another challenge, says this investor. “Many Korean founders are sharp on numbers and strategy, but stumble on a simpler question: What’s your story? Business is still about people connecting with people. Without a clear, authentic narrative of why you and your team are the right ones, it’s hard to stand out. And because so many already bring strong skills to the table, that personal story becomes even more important,” this person said.</p>\n<p>Choi sees reason for optimism despite the challenges. The scene blends the grit of scrappy founders with the steady influence of big Korean tech companies, where stability and benefits still matter. “Unlike in the U.S., where founders often leap into risk and pivot fast, startups here tend to balance ambition with discipline—building proof at home before going abroad. The outcome is dependable engineering, but without the same ‘move fast, break things’ energy that defines Silicon Valley.”</p>\n<p>Pangyo is also moving beyond gaming and platforms into AI, biotech, and deep tech, with governments investing in startup campuses and scaling programs, Choi observed. </p>\n<p>The real test now is less about local growth and more about proving global success—unicorns, cross-border exits, and steady inflows of talent, he said.</p>\n<p>“What holds Korean startups back from going global? Three key factors are the home market is small size, weaker global investor ties, and language or regulatory hurdles that create additional friction. Breaking through takes more than ambition; it needs early global partners, deliberate go-to-market resources, and leaders who think cross-border from day one,” Choi said. </p>\n<p>Yet a fourth factor — their ability to tell compelling stories to the world — may also prove to be the biggest difference between remaining a regional tech hub and becoming a true global innovation center.</p>\n</div>"

    "body": "<div>\n<p>Google is turning its vast public data trove into a goldmine for AI with the debut of the Data Commons Model Context Protocol (MCP) Server — enabling developers, data scientists, and AI agents to access real-world statistics using natural language and better train AI systems.</p>\n<p>Launched in 2018, Google’s Data Commons organizes public datasets from a <a href=\"https://datacommons.org/data/\" target=\"_blank\">range of sources</a>, including government surveys, local administrative data, and statistics from global bodies such as the United Nations. With the release of the MCP Server, this data is now accessible via natural language, allowing developers to integrate it into AI agents or applications.</p>\n<p>AI systems are often trained on noisy, unverified web data. Combined with their <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/09/07/are-bad-incentives-to-blame-for-ai-hallucinations/\" target=\"_blank\">tendency to “fill in the blanks”</a> when sources are lacking, this <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/08/14/study-suggests-that-even-the-best-ai-models-hallucinate-a-bunch/\" target=\"_blank\">leads to hallucinations</a>. As a result, companies looking to fine-tune AI systems for specific use cases often need access to large, high-quality datasets. By publicly releasing the MCP Server for its Data Commons, Google aims to tackle both challenges.</p>\n<p>Data Commons’ new MCP server bridges public datasets — from census figures to climate statistics — with AI systems that increasingly depend on accurate, structured context. By making this data accessible via natural language prompts, the release aims to ground AI in verifiable, real-world information.</p>\n<p>“The Model Context Protocol is letting us use the intelligence of the large language model to pick the right data at the right time, without having to understand how we model the data, how our API works,” said Google Data Commons head Prem Ramaswami in an interview.</p>\n<figure><img src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/google-data-commons-mcp-server-gemini.jpg\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/google-data-commons-mcp-server-gemini.jpg 1920w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/google-data-commons-mcp-server-gemini.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/google-data-commons-mcp-server-gemini.jpg?resize=300,201 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/google-data-commons-mcp-server-gemini.jpg?resize=768,514 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/google-data-commons-mcp-server-gemini.jpg?resize=680,455 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/google-data-commons-mcp-server-gemini.jpg?resize=1200,803 1200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/google-data-commons-mcp-server-gemini.jpg?resize=1280,857 1280w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/google-data-commons-mcp-server-gemini.jpg?resize=430,288 430w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/google-data-commons-mcp-server-gemini.jpg?resize=720,482 720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/google-data-commons-mcp-server-gemini.jpg?resize=900,602 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/google-data-commons-mcp-server-gemini.jpg?resize=800,535 800w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/google-data-commons-mcp-server-gemini.jpg?resize=1536,1028 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/google-data-commons-mcp-server-gemini.jpg?resize=668,447 668w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/google-data-commons-mcp-server-gemini.jpg?resize=560,375 560w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/google-data-commons-mcp-server-gemini.jpg?resize=922,617 922w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/google-data-commons-mcp-server-gemini.jpg?resize=708,474 708w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/google-data-commons-mcp-server-gemini.jpg?resize=50,33 50w\" /><figcaption><span>A Sample of Google Data Commons MCP Server connecting AI with real-world Data</span><span><strong>Image Credits:</strong>Google</span></figcaption></figure>\n<p>First <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/11/25/anthropic-proposes-a-way-to-connect-data-to-ai-chatbots/\" target=\"_blank\">introduced by Anthropic last November</a>, MCP is an open industry standard that enables AI systems to access data from various sources, including business tools, content repositories, and app development environments, providing a common framework for understanding contextual prompts. Since its launch, companies such as <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/03/26/openai-adopts-rival-anthropics-standard-for-connecting-ai-models-to-data/\" target=\"_blank\">OpenAI</a>, <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/05/19/github-microsoft-embrace-anthropics-spec-for-connecting-ai-models-to-data-sources/\" target=\"_blank\">Microsoft</a>, and <a href=\"https://thenewstack.io/google-embraces-mcp/\" target=\"_blank\">Google</a> have adopted the standard for integrating their AI models with various data sources.</p>\n<p>While other tech companies explored how to apply the standard to their AI models, Ramaswami and his team at Google began investigating how the framework could be used to make the Data Commons platform more accessible earlier this year.</p>\n<div>\n\t\t<p>Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t<p><span>San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>October 27-29, 2025</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n<p>Google has also partnered with the ONE Campaign, a nonprofit organization focused on improving economic opportunities and public health in Africa, to launch the One Data Agent. This AI tool utilizes the MCP Server to surface tens of millions of financial and health data points in plain language.</p>\n<p>The ONE Campaign approached Google’s Data Commons team with a prototype implementation of MCP on its own custom server. That interaction, Ramaswami told TechCrunch, was the turning point that led the team to build a dedicated MCP Server in May.</p>\n<p>However, the experience is not limited to the ONE Campaign. The open nature of the Data Commons MCP Server makes it compatible with any LLM, and Google has provided several ways for developers to get started. A sample agent is available through the Agent Development Kit (ADK) in a <a href=\"https://colab.research.google.com/github/datacommonsorg/agent-toolkit/blob/main/notebooks/datacommons_mcp_tools_with_custom_agent.ipynb\" target=\"_blank\">Colab notebook</a>, and the server can also be accessed directly via the <a href=\"https://github.com/datacommonsorg/agent-toolkit/blob/main/docs/quickstart.md\" target=\"_blank\">Gemini CLI</a> or any MCP-compatible client using the <a href=\"https://pypi.org/project/datacommons-mcp/\" target=\"_blank\">PyPI package</a>.

Jim Jordan (R-OH) on Tuesday.</p>\n<p>“Reflecting the Company’s commitment to free expression, YouTube will provide an opportunity for all creators to rejoin the platform if the Company terminated their channels for repeated violations of COVID-19 and elections integrity policies that are no longer in effect,” Alphabet’s legal counsel Daniel F. Donovan wrote. “YouTube values conservative voices on its platform and recognizes that these creators have extensive reach and play an important role in civic discourse.”</p>\n<p>This letter was a response to a <a href=\"https://judiciary.house.gov/sites/evo-subsites/republicans-judiciary.house.gov/files/evo-media-document/2025-03-06-jdj-to-pichai-alphabet-re-subpoena.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">subpoena</a> from Rep. Jordan, who sought to investigate if the Biden-Harris administration had “coerced or colluded” with companies like Alphabet to censor speech.</p>\n<p>At the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, many social platforms like YouTube, Facebook, and Twitter enacted policies to ban the spread of medical misinformation about the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/25/youtube-has-removed-1-million-videos-for-dangerous-covid-19-misinformation/\">virus</a> and <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/29/youtube-will-now-ban-content-with-vaccine-misinformation/\">vaccines</a>. For example, YouTube disallowed content saying that vaccines can cause cancer, a false claim which is <a href=\"https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/coronavirus/in-depth/coronavirus-myths/art-20485720\" target=\"_blank\">not supported</a> by <a href=\"https://www.cancer.gov/about-cancer/coronavirus/covid-19-vaccines-people-with-cancer\" target=\"_blank\">scientific research</a>.</p>\n<p>Later, platforms also took action against content falsely claiming that the 2020 U.S. presidential election was “stolen” from Donald Trump. Twitter, not yet bought and rebranded by Elon Musk, said that it suspended <a href=\"https://blog.x.com/en_us/topics/company/2021/protecting--the-conversation-following-the-riots-in-washington--\" target=\"_blank\">70,000 accounts</a> for sharing QAnon conspiracy content and inciting violence in the week after the January 6 riots.</p>\n<p>But leading up to the presidential election in 2024, online platforms began loosening their policies around misinformation. On YouTube, this included reinstating president Donald Trump, whose account had been <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-64993603\" target=\"_blank\">banned</a> after the January 6 attack for breaking rules around inciting violence. The platform also reinstated <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c0mzk2y41zvo\" target=\"_blank\">Robert F. Kennedy, Jr.</a>, who became the U.S. Secretary of Health and Human Services.</p>\n<p>Now, according to the company’s letter to Rep.

The new a service will let businesses subsidize their employees’ rides or purchase promo codes in bulk, which can be handed out to clients, customers, or workers. The Waymo for Business rides will cost the same as its regular service.</p>\n<p>One of Waymo’s first customers is Carvana, the Phoenix-based online used car marketplace. </p>\n<p>While riders already use Waymo’s robotaxis to commute to work, this is the company’s first coordinated coomercial effort to target corporations and other organizations. Waymo has said nearly one in six of its local riders in San Francisco, Los Angeles, and Phoenix rely on Waymo to commute to work or school.</p>\n<p>Today, users open up the Waymo One app (or in some cities like Austin, the Uber app) to hail a ride. That process won’t change for employees whose companies have signed up for Waymo for Business. What does change is the control companies can exert over the service. </p>\n<p>Through the Waymo for Business service, companies have access to a business portal that gives the organizations control over their ride programs. Corporate customers can dictate the geographic area their employees use the robotaxis, set pickup and drop-off locations and monitor ride activity and track their budget. </p>\n<div>\n\t\t<p>Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t<p><span>San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>October 27-29, 2025</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n<div><p>Waymo said it plans to bring its new business service to other cities like Washington DC and Miami, once it has launched commercial operations in those markets. </p><p>Waymo has ramped up operations over the past 18 months making it the dominant robotaxi service provider in the United States. The company has expanded its commercial service from Phoenix to Los Angeles, San Francisco, Austin, and Atlanta. More cities are slated for 2026. </p></div>\n<p>But it’s also sought other means to attract customers beyond expanding its geographic footprint.

The group began work on the new tool after Gore’s experience working alongside people in Memphis, Tennessee, who were <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.usatoday.com/in-depth/news/2021/03/17/black-families-square-off-big-oil-byhalia-pipeline-struggle/6817169002/\">trying to block</a> the construction of a crude oil pipeline that would run through their community and across their drinking water aquifer.

Eventually, the plume visualizations will be available worldwide, Gore said.</p>\n<div>\n\t\t<p>Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t<p><span>San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>October 27-29, 2025</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n<p>People have intuitively known about the ill effects of soot for years, but it was only recently that Climate Trace and its partners at Carnegie Mellon University were able to wrangle global data on the issue into something that was both sensible and defensible. </p>\n<p>“The very idea of tracking 662 million sites around the world, I mean without AI, people couldn’t have imagined doing something like that,” he said. “But of course, as we’ve all seen in the last couple of years, AI can do stuff that is quite extraordinary.”</p>\n<p>Scientists have only recently come to appreciate the wide-ranging health effects of fine particulate pollution. Though researchers have long known about its role in lung cancer and heart disease, for example, in the last decade or so they’ve shown that exposure to PM2.5 can increase the risk a range of other deadly ailments, including <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2797628\">low birth weight</a>, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2755672\">kidney disease</a>, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lanplh/article/PIIS2542-5196(20)30227-8/fulltext\">Parkinson’s</a>, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lanplh/article/PIIS2542-5196(20)30227-8/fulltext\">Alzheimer’s</a>, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-025-02844-9\">dementia</a>, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2755672\">type 2 diabetes</a>, and <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9329703/\">more</a>. Even at legal levels, fine particulate pollution causes <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2022/01/particulate-pollution-is-killing-older-americans-even-at-legal-levels/\">tens of thousands of excess deaths</a> in the U.S. annually.</p>\n<p>Much of the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S001393510580009X\">early work</a> into the health impacts of PM2.5 was pioneered by <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://hsph.harvard.edu/profile/joel-schwartz/\">Joel Schwartz</a>, the scientist who’s research decades ago led to the ban on leaded gasoline. Gore hopes greater awareness of fossil fuels’ health effects will spur broader action, similar to what happened with leaded gasoline. </p>\n<p>“I think that it creates a set of conditions and incentives that could very well make it more likely that we can accelerate the transition away from carbon-intensive facilities,” he said. “It makes it more likely to build political support for the conversion of these facilities to much less emitting technologies.”</p>\n</div><div>\n<div>\n\t\t<p>Tim De Chant is a senior climate reporter at TechCrunch.
