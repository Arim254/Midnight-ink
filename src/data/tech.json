It’s a valuable enough company to have landed its founder and CEO <a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/profile/guillaume-pousaz/\" target=\"_blank\">Guillaume Pousaz</a> on Forbes’ billionaire list.</p>\n<p>On the other, there was a short period of time when Checkout.com was valued at <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/12/checkout-com-raises-1b-round-at-4/\">a whopping $40 billion</a>, as part of its $1 billion Series D round closed in 2022. By the end of that year, with the venture world crashing into a bear market, it had already internally <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2022/12/13/why-checkoutcom-lowered-its-internal-valuation/\">slashed its valuation to $11 billion</a>. And then it lowered its valuation again, to $9.35 billion in 2023, a company spokesperson told TechCrunch. </p>\n<p>So $12 billion represents a nearly 30% increase from its previous valuation.</p>\n<p>But this valuation isn’t being obtained because an investor is plunking down cash. The company is the only one buying employee shares back, with no other investors involved in a tender offer, the spokesperson tells us. Instead, the valuation comes from a 409A valuation, the person said. That’s an assessment made by an independent third-party. It’s not the same as a vote of confidence from a professional investor, but it’s also not simply the company giving itself a bump.</p>\n<p>In fairness, Checkout.com’s archrival Stripe also had its own valuation setback during the same venture capital bear market, crashing from $95 billion at the height of the froth in 2021,<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2023/03/15/stripe-now-valued-at-50b-following-6-5b-raise/\"> to $50 billion during the doldrums in 2023.</a> Stripe has since clawed its way back<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/02/27/stripe-finalizes-tender-sale-at-a-91-5b-valuation-says-payment-volumes-grew-to-1-4t-in-2024/\"> to $91.5 billion as of February</a> through its own series of employee tender offers. Stripe, however, did have outside investors helping to value it. And, Stripe is rumored to be working on yet another tender offer at a $106.7 billion valuation, Axios just <a href=\"https://www.axios.com/2025/09/23/stripe-buy-back-stock-vc\" target=\"_blank\">reported.</a>  </p>\n<p>Yet just because Checkout.com is competing against one of the most highly valued startups of all time, doesn’t minimize its own business achievements. </p>\n<p>The London-based payments company, which is a popular choice among large e-commerce sites like eBay and Pinterest, said it was starting to be profitable by the end of 2024 and is on track for a full year of profitability in 2025. Checkout.com says it processes about $1 billion worth of e-commerce payments a day and hired 300 more employees this year, bringing headcount to 2,000 people across 19 global offices. </p>\n<p>Checkout.com also tells TechCrunch that employees with tenure of at least a year will be eligible for the buyback program, but declined to indicate the size of the buyback, either in total spend or number of shares.</p>\n<p><em>Note: This story was updated with more information about the previous valuation.</em></p>\n</div>"

Then OpenAI said it would build out <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/09/23/openai-is-building-five-new-stargate-data-centers-with-oracle-and-softbank/\">five more Stargate AI data centers</a> with Oracle and SoftBank, adding gigawatts of new capacity online in the coming years. And it was later revealed that <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/09/24/oracle-is-reportedly-looking-to-raise-15b-in-corporate-bond-sale/\">Oracle sold $18 billion in bonds</a> to pay for these data centers.</p>\n<p>On their own, each deal is dizzying in scale. But in aggregate, we see how Silicon Valley is moving heaven and earth to give OpenAI enough power to train and serve future versions of ChatGPT.</p>\n<p>This week on <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/podcasts/equity/\">Equity</a>, Anthony Ha and I (Max Zeff) go beyond the headlines to break down what’s really going on in these AI infrastructure deals.</p>\n<p>Rather conveniently, OpenAI also gave the world a glimpse this week of a power-intensive feature it could serve more broadly if it had access to more AI data centers.</p>\n<p>The company launched <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/09/25/openai-launches-chatgpt-pulse-to-proactively-write-you-morning-briefs/\">Pulse</a> — a new feature in ChatGPT that works overnight to deliver personalized morning briefings for users. The experience feels similar to a news app or a social feed — something you check first thing in the morning — but doesn’t have posts from other users or ads (yet).</p>\n<p>Pulse is part of a new class of OpenAI products that work independently, even when users aren’t in the ChatGPT app. The company would like to deliver a lot more of these features and roll them out to free users, but they’re limited by the number of computer servers available to them. OpenAI said it can only offer Pulse to its $200-a-month Pro subscribers right now due to capacity constraints.</p>\n<div>\n\t\t<p>Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t<p><span>San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>October 27-29, 2025</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n<p>The real question is whether features like Pulse are worth the hundreds of billions of dollars being invested in AI data centers to support OpenAI. The feature looks cool and all, but that’s a tall order.</p>\n<p>Watch the full episode to hear more about the massive AI infrastructure investments reshaping Silicon Valley, TikTok’s ownership saga, and the policy changes affecting tech’s biggest players.</p>\n<figure><p>\n<iframe width=\"500\" height=\"281\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/mUcfBLevUvY?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\"></iframe>\n</p></figure>\n</div>\n\t\t\t<div>\n\t<p>Topics</p>\n</div>\n<div>\n<div>\n\t\t<p>Maxwell Zeff is a senior reporter at TechCrunch specializing in AI.

In July, the service rolled out an <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://techcrunch.com/2024/07/15/youtube-music-is-testing-an-ai-generated-radio-feature-and-adding-a-song-recognition-tool/\">AI conversational radio feature</a> that lets users create a custom radio station by describing what they want to hear.</p>\n<p>YouTube Music’s new AI hosts are currently being tested through YouTube Labs, the platform’s new hub for AI experiments. In a <a href=\"https://blog.youtube/news-and-events/introducing-youtube-labs/\" target=\"_blank\">blog post</a>, the company said YouTube Labs is “a new initiative dedicated to exploring the potential of AI on YouTube.”</p>\n<p>YouTube Labs is similar to Google Labs, Google’s experimental arm that lets users test early-stage AI products and provide feedback. </p>\n<p>YouTube Labs is open to all YouTube users, which means they don’t need a Premium membership to sign up. However, the company notes that only a limited number of U.S.-based participants will be given access to the experimental program.</p>\n<p>YouTube Labs has been implementing AI features across YouTube recently.</p>\n<div>\n\t\t<p>Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t<p><span>San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>October 27-29, 2025</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n<p>Earlier this month, the company released a series of <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/09/20/updates-to-studio-youtube-live-new-gen-ai-tools-and-everything-else-announced-at-made-on-youtube/\">AI features for creators</a>, including GenAI tools for Shorts creation.

Instead, the story centers around <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/05/facebook-whistleblower-frances-haugen-testifies-before-the-senate/\">Frances Haugen</a> (played by Mikey Madison), the former Facebook employee who leaked a massive trove of <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/tech/personal-tech/facebook-knows-instagram-is-toxic-for-teen-girls-company-documents-show-11631620739?mod=hp_lead_pos7\" target=\"_blank\">internal documents</a> to a Wall Street Journal reporter (played by Jeremy Allen White) and accused the company of prioritizing “profits over people” in 2021.</p>\n<p>Among the most damning revelations from Haugen’s leak was internal research showing that the company was well aware that Instagram was harming the mental health of teenage girls. Haugen said in congressional testimony that Facebook was “<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2021/oct/07/facebooks-role-in-myanmar-and-ethiopia-under-new-scrutiny\" target=\"_blank\">literally fanning ethnic violence</a>” in Ethiopia, since content moderation efforts in non-English languages were under-resourced. Her leaked documents also revealed that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2021/oct/25/facebook-revelations-from-misinformation-to-mental-health\" target=\"_blank\">87% of Meta’s spending</a> on reducing misinformation went toward English language content, though English speakers make up just 9% of users.</p>\n<p>Zuckerberg and Facebook — rebranded to Meta shortly after Haugen’s leaks — have always rankled at how “The Social Network” depicts the company’s origin. Earlier this year, Zuckerberg <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/03/28/it-was-weird-man-zuckerberg-took-facebook-employees-to-see-the-social-network-when-it-came-out/\">revealed</a> in an interview that he saw the movie one time as part of an outing with other Facebook employees, which was arranged because he knew that they would go see the movie anyway.</p>\n<p>“It was weird, man,” he said. “They got all these very specific details of what I was wearing, or these specific things correct, but then the whole narrative arc around my motivations and all this stuff were like, completely wrong.”</p>\n<div>\n\t\t<p>Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t<p><span>San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>October 27-29, 2025</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div><div>\n<div>\n\t\t<p>Amanda Silberling is a senior writer at TechCrunch covering the intersection of technology and culture.

Flipkart is working toward completing the transition within the next couple of months, aligning with India’s festive season — a critical sales period — and laying the groundwork for a public listing expected as early as 2026.</p>\n<p>Relocating their base back home helps companies align with evolving local regulations and meet requirements for domestic stock listings. It also makes sense to tap India’s public markets, given the expanding retail investor base and rising appetite for IPOs. The trend reflects the growing maturity and attractiveness of India’s capital markets compared to overseas alternatives.</p>\n<p>Flipkart initiated the process in India and Singapore simultaneously over two and a half months ago, following the board’s <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/04/21/flipkart-to-relocate-hq-to-india-ahead-of-ipo/\" target=\"_blank\">approval for the relocation of its headquarters</a> in April, the people said.</p>\n<p>In 2022, Walmart-backed PhonePe, which had split from Flipkart in late 2022, <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2022/12/22/flipkart-and-phonepe-complete-separation/\" target=\"_blank\">relocated its headquarters</a> from Singapore to India. The fintech firm filed confidential IPO papers with India’s market regulator, the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI), earlier this week. Recent reports suggest that PhonePe is <a href=\"https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/walmart-owned-phonepe-files-for-mega-ipo-of-around-rs-12-000-crore-via-confidential-route-13572747.html\" target=\"_blank\">aiming to raise ₹120 billion</a> (approximately $1.35 billion) through the offering.</p>\n<p>Startups including Zepto and Groww have also relocated their headquarters to India in recent months as they prepare to go public on Indian stock exchanges. Notably, Groww is set to <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/09/16/groww-backed-by-satya-nadella-set-to-become-first-indian-startup-to-go-public-after-u-s-to-india-move/\" target=\"_blank\">become the first Indian startup</a> to list domestically after redomiciling from the U.S., with its IPO expected later this year.</p>\n<p>Flipkart’s shift from its Singapore headquarters comes over a year after it <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/05/24/google-invests-350-million-in-indias-flipkart/\" target=\"_blank\">raised $350 million from Google</a> as part of a nearly $1 billion funding round that began in 2023.

    "body": "<div>\n<p>From tech giants to startups, South Korean players are developing large language models tailored to their own language and culture, ready to compete with global heavyweights like OpenAI and Google. </p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.kedglobal.com/artificial-intelligence/newsView/ked202508040010\" target=\"_blank\">Last month</a>, the nation launched its most ambitious sovereign AI initiative to date, pledging ₩530 billion, (about $390 million), to five local companies building large-scale foundational models.  </p>\n<p>The move underscores Seoul’s desire to cut reliance on foreign AI technologies, hoping to strengthen national security and keep a tighter control over data in the AI era.  </p>\n<p>The organizations picked by the <a href=\"https://www.msit.go.kr/eng/index.do\" target=\"_blank\">Ministry of Science and ICT </a>to compete were <a href=\"https://www.lgresearch.ai/\" target=\"_blank\">LG AI Research</a>, <a href=\"https://www.sktelecom.com/\" target=\"_blank\">SK Telecom</a>, <a href=\"https://www.ncloud.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Naver Cloud</a>, <a href=\"https://nc-ai.com/en\" target=\"_blank\">NC AI</a>, and the startup <a href=\"https://www.upstage.ai/\" target=\"_blank\">Upstage</a>. </p>\n<p>Every six months, the government will review the first cohort’s progress, cut underperformers, and continue funding the frontrunners until just two remain to lead the country’s sovereign AI drive. </p>\n<p>Each player is bringing a different advantage to South Korea’s AI race. TechCrunch spoke with several of the selected companies about how they plan to take on OpenAI, Google, Anthropic and the rest on their home turf. NC AI declined to comment.</p>\n<h2 id=\"h-lg-ai-research-exaone\">LG AI Research: Exaone </h2>\n<p>LG AI Research, the R&D unit of South Korean giant LG Group, offers <a href=\"https://www.lgresearch.ai/blog/view?seq=576\" target=\"_blank\">Exaone 4.0</a>, a hybrid reasoning AI model. The latest version blends broad language processing with the advanced reasoning features first introduced in the company’s earlier Exaone Deep model. </p>\n<div>\n\t\t<p>Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t<p><span>San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>October 27-29, 2025</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n<p>Exaone 4.0 (32B) already scores reasonably well against competitors on <a href=\"https://artificialanalysis.ai/\" target=\"_blank\">Artificial Analysis</a>’s Intelligence Index benchmark (as does Upstage’s <a href=\"https://artificialanalysis.ai/\" target=\"_blank\">Solar Pro2</a>). But it plans to improve and move up the ranks through its deep access to real-world industry data ranging from biotech to advanced materials and manufacturing.  </p>\n<p>It’s coupling that data with a focus on refining the data before feeding to the models to train. Instead of chasing sheer scale, LG wants to make the entire process more intelligent, so its AI can deliver real, practical value that goes beyond what general-purpose models can offer. “This is our fundamental approach,” co-head Honglak Lee told TechCrunch. </p>\n<p>LG is improving its models via familiar tactics: offering them through APIs, then using the real-world data generated by users of those services to train the model to improve.  </p>\n<p>“As LG’s models improve, our partners can deliver better services, which in turn generate greater economic value and even richer data,” he said. </p>\n<p>However, instead of chasing massive GPU clusters, LG AI Research is focusing on efficiency, getting the most out of every chip, and creating industry-specific models, he mentioned. The goal isn’t to outspend the global giants but to outsmart them with high-performing, yet more efficient, AI. </p>\n<p>South Korea’s telco giant SK Telecom (SKT) launched its <a href=\"https://www.sktelecom.com/en/press/press_detail.do?idx=1572%C2%A4tPage=1&type=all&keyword=A%20dot\" target=\"_blank\">personal AI agent A.</a> (pronounced A-dot) service way back in late 2023 and just rolled out its new large language model, A.X, this July.  </p>\n<p>Built on top of the Chinese open source model from Alibaba Cloud, <a href=\"https://huggingface.co/skt/A.X-4.0-Light/blob/main/LICENSE\" target=\"_blank\">Qwen 2.5</a>, <a href=\"https://huggingface.co/skt/A.X-4.0?utm_source=chatgpt.com\" target=\"_blank\">A.X 4.0</a> comes in two models, a hefty 72-billion-parameter version and a lighter 7B version.  </p>\n<p>SK says that A.X 4.0 processes Korean inputs about 33% more efficiently than GPT-4o did, underscoring its local language edge. (OpenAI’s GPT 5.0 comparison data is not available.) SKT also open sourced its <a href=\"https://news.sktelecom.com/en/2035?utm_source=chatgpt.com\" target=\"_blank\">A.X 3.1 models</a> earlier this summer. Meanwhile, the A. service offers features like AI call summaries and auto-generated notes. As of August 2025, it’s already pulled in about 10 million subscribers. </p>\n<p>SK’s edge is its versatility, because it has access to information from its telecom network ranging from navigation to taxi-hailing. </p>\n<p>“SK Telecom’s role is to act as a bridge between cutting-edge model research and real-world impact. With our telecom infrastructure, extensive user base and proven service like A., we bring AI directly into everyday life, whether in customer service, mobility, or manufacturing,” Taeyoon Kim, head of the foundation model office at SK Telecom, told TechCrunch. </p>\n<p>SK Telecom is also investing in AI infrastructure, using GPUaaS, South Korea’s largest GPU-based service, and building a new hyperscale AI data center with AWS. Whatever it lacks, it is partnering to obtain.  </p>\n<p>“We’re building a full-stack ecosystem with Korean AI chipmaker Rebellions, securing trusted data partnerships through work with the government and universities, and fostering a global research network,” said Kim. “That includes projects like our collaboration with MIT (MGAIC), which applies foundation models to advanced manufacturing and battery and semiconductor innovation.” </p>\n<h2 id=\"h-naver-cloud-hyperclova-x\">Naver Cloud: HyperCLOVA X </h2>\n<p>Naver Cloud, the cloud services arm of South Korea’s leading internet company, introduced its large language model, HyperClova, in 2021. Two years later, it unveiled an upgraded version, <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2023/08/24/koreas-internet-giant-naver-unveils-generative-ai-services/\" target=\"_blank\">HyperCLOVA X</a>, along with new products powered by the technology: CLOVA X, an AI chatbot, and Cue, a generative AI-driven search engine positioned as a rival to Microsoft’s CoPilot-enhanced Bing and Google’s AI Overview. It also unveiled this year its multimodal reasoning AI model, <a href=\"https://clova.ai/cdn/media/2025/06/HyperCLOVA_X_THINK_Technical_Report.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">HyperCLOVE X Think</a>. </p>\n<p>Naver Cloud believes the true power of LLMs is to serve as “connectors” linking legacy systems and siloed services to improve usefulness, according to a Naver spokesperson.  </p>\n<p>Naver stands out as Korea’s only company — and one of the few in the world — that can genuinely claim to have an “AI full stack.” It built its HyperCLOVA X model from scratch and runs the massive data centers, cloud services, AI platforms, applications, and consumer services that bring the technology to life, the spokesperson explained. </p>\n<p>Similar to Google — but tuned for South Korea — Naver is embedding its AI into core services like search, shopping, maps, and finance. Its advantage is real-world data. It’s AI Shopping Guide, for instance, offers recommendations based on what people actually want to buy. Other services include CLOVA Studio, which lets businesses build custom generative AI, and CLOVA Carecall, an AI-powered check-in service geared for seniors living alone. </p>\n<p>The Naver spokesperson says besting global AI giants like OpenAI and Google hinges on two things: perfecting its “recipe” for models and securing the capital to scale them. Even so, rather than chasing size, the company emphasizes sophistication, arguing its AI is already globally competitive at comparable scales.  </p>\n<h2 id=\"h-upstage-s-solar-pro-2-nbsp\">Upstage’s Solar Pro 2 </h2>\n<p>Upstage is the only startup competing in the project. Its Solar Pro 2 model, launched last July, was the first Korean model recognized as a frontier model by <a href=\"https://artificialanalysis.ai/\" target=\"_blank\">Artificial Analysis</a>, putting it in the ring with OpenAI, Google, Meta, and Anthropic, according to Soon-il Kwon, executive vice president at Upstage. </p>\n<p>While most frontier models have 100 billion to 200 billion parameters, Solar Pro 2 — with just 31 billion — performs better for South Koreans and is more cost-effective, Kwon told TechCrunch. </p>\n<p>“Solar Pro 2 has outperformed global models on major Korean benchmarks. With this project, Upstage aims to achieve a Korean language performance of 105% of the global standard,” Kwon said.  </p>\n<p>Upstage aims to differentiate itself by focusing on real business impact, not just benchmarks, he said. So it is developing specialized models for industries like finance, law, and medicine, while pushing to build a Korean AI ecosystem led by “AI-native” startups. </p>\n</div>"

Human hands are incredibly sophisticated, packed with about 17,000 specialized touch receptors that no robot comes close to matching. While machine learning transformed speech recognition and image processing, those breakthroughs built on decades of existing technology for capturing the right data. “We don’t have such a tradition for touch data,” Brooks points out.</p>\n<p>Then there’s safety. Full-sized walking humanoid robots pump massive amounts of energy into staying upright. When they fall, they’re dangerous. Physics means a robot twice the size of today’s models would pack eight times the harmful energy.</p>\n<p>Brooks predicts that in 15 years, successful “humanoid” robots will actually have wheels, multiple arms, and specialized sensors and abandon the human form. Meanwhile, he’s thoroughly convinced that today’s billions are funding expensive training experiments that will never scale to mass production.</p>\n<p>It’s far from the first time Brooks has poured cold water on expectations set by brash entrepreneurs and eager investors. Last year, he <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/06/29/mit-robotics-pioneer-rodney-brooks-thinks-people-are-vastly-overestimating-generative-ai/\">talked at length</a> with TechCrunch about why the promise of generative AI exceeds its abilities and can even create more work in some cases. </p>\n<p>For example, the AI research nonprofit METR said this summer it had recruited 16 highly rated developers from large open-source repositories to measure the impacts of AI tools on real-world software development. It then assigned them nearly 250 real issues to address with the tools and without them, and measured their screens. When the developers used the AI tools, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://metr.org/blog/2025-07-10-early-2025-ai-experienced-os-dev-study/\">they took 19% longer</a> to complete their tasks.

TechCrunch talked with Brooks about this <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2017/07/19/this-famous-roboticist-doesnt-think-elon-musk-understands-ai/\">back in 2017</a> at MIT, when the landscape looked very different but not entirely dissimilar to today’s playing field.</p>\n<p>At the time, Brooks said he was just starting to see more companies specializing in making data sets for machine learning — a trend that has only continued. Relatedly, he argued why it wasn’t necessarily a foregone conclusion that Big Tech companies would win in robotics, despite what long ago seemed an unsurmountable lead in the amount of data they control. Yet today’s leading robotics companies have not escaped those companies’ gravitational pull.  </p>\n<p>Apptronik, a humanoid robot maker that has raised nearly $450 million from investors, counts Google among its backers and partnered with Google’s DeepMind robotics team late last year to “bring together best-in-class artificial intelligence with cutting-edge hardware and embodied intelligence.”</p>\n<p>Figure, similarly, is backed in part by Microsoft and OpenAI Startup Fund and partnered with OpenAI in February 2024 to combine OpenAI’s research with its own “deep understanding of robotics hardware and software.” The two split up almost exactly a year later, this past March, with FigureAI saying it had enjoyed a “major breakthrough” in its own in-house, end-to-end AI for robotics.</p>\n<p>Earlier this month, Figure announced it had received over $1 billion in committed capital in its latest funding round and said the deal valued the company at at an astonishing <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/09/16/figure-reaches-39b-valuation-in-latest-funding-round/\">$39 billion</a>.</p>\n</div><div>\n<div><p>\n\t\tLoizos has been reporting on Silicon Valley since the late ’90s, when she joined the original Red Herring magazine.

With its $799 price tag, the Apple Watch Ultra 3 is clearly aimed at a niche, high-end market and athletes. For most consumers, the purchasing decision likely lies between the Apple Watch SE 3 and the Apple Watch Series 11, starting at $249 and $399, respectively.</p>\n<p>Despite its lower price tag, the Apple Watch SE 3 comes with much of the same software as the Series 11. If you’re looking for a straightforward smartwatch with essential features like step counting and sleep tracking, the SE 3 is an excellent and affordable choice. </p>\n<p>While the Series 11 and Ultra 3 offer modest improvements over their predecessors, the SE 3 has received a significant upgrade from the SE 2. The smartwatch jumps from the S8 chip to the S10 and now features an always-on display, supports fast charging, offers better crack resistance, introduces new health features, includes a wrist-temperature sensor for advanced sleep tracking and retrospective ovulation insights, and more. </p>\n<figure><img src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/apple-watch-se3-colors.png?w=680\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/apple-watch-se3-colors.png 3280w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/apple-watch-se3-colors.png?resize=150,67 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/apple-watch-se3-colors.png?resize=300,135 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/apple-watch-se3-colors.png?resize=768,345 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/apple-watch-se3-colors.png?resize=680,305 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/apple-watch-se3-colors.png?resize=1200,539 1200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/apple-watch-se3-colors.png?resize=1280,574 1280w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/apple-watch-se3-colors.png?resize=430,193 430w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/apple-watch-se3-colors.png?resize=720,323 720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/apple-watch-se3-colors.png?resize=900,404 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/apple-watch-se3-colors.png?resize=800,359 800w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/apple-watch-se3-colors.png?resize=1536,689 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/apple-watch-se3-colors.png?resize=2048,919 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/apple-watch-se3-colors.png?resize=668,300 668w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/apple-watch-se3-colors.png?resize=1375,617 1375w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/apple-watch-se3-colors.png?resize=708,318 708w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/apple-watch-se3-colors.png?resize=50,22 50w\" /><figcaption><span><strong>Image Credits:</strong>Apple</span></figcaption></figure>\n<p>Although it’s not as flashy as the Series 11 and Ultra 3, it definitely stands out and packs great value, especially for first-time buyers.
