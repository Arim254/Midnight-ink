Following a period of rapid growth in the 2010s and during the pandemic, Schreier said gamers in recent years have “tended to stick with old favorites rather than purchasing new titles.”</p>\n<p>This seems to be reflected in EA’s fiscal year 2025, with 75% of revenue coming from live services rather than new purchases. In fact, analyst and Spilt Milk Studios co-founder Nicholas Lovell told Schreier, “We’re moving away from an era of breaking new ideas to people settling into the same games, spending money over and over again.”</p>\n<p>So Lovell suggested that EA executives might see the reported $50 billion price tag as the company’s “peak valuation,” as the industry enters a period where profits continue rising but valuations start to fall.</p>\n</div>"

It’s a valuable enough company to have landed its founder and CEO <a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/profile/guillaume-pousaz/\" target=\"_blank\">Guillaume Pousaz</a> on Forbes’ billionaire list.</p>\n<p>On the other, there was a short period of time when Checkout.com was valued at <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/12/checkout-com-raises-1b-round-at-4/\">a whopping $40 billion</a>, as part of its $1 billion Series D round closed in 2022. By the end of that year, with the venture world crashing into a bear market, it had already internally <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2022/12/13/why-checkoutcom-lowered-its-internal-valuation/\">slashed its valuation to $11 billion</a>. And then it lowered its valuation again, to $9.35 billion in 2023, a company spokesperson told TechCrunch. </p>\n<p>So $12 billion represents a nearly 30% increase from its previous valuation.</p>\n<p>But this valuation isn’t being obtained because an investor is plunking down cash. The company is the only one buying employee shares back, with no other investors involved in a tender offer, the spokesperson tells us. Instead, the valuation comes from a 409A valuation, the person said. That’s an assessment made by an independent third-party. It’s not the same as a vote of confidence from a professional investor, but it’s also not simply the company giving itself a bump.</p>\n<p>In fairness, Checkout.com’s archrival Stripe also had its own valuation setback during the same venture capital bear market, crashing from $95 billion at the height of the froth in 2021,<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2023/03/15/stripe-now-valued-at-50b-following-6-5b-raise/\"> to $50 billion during the doldrums in 2023.</a> Stripe has since clawed its way back<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/02/27/stripe-finalizes-tender-sale-at-a-91-5b-valuation-says-payment-volumes-grew-to-1-4t-in-2024/\"> to $91.5 billion as of February</a> through its own series of employee tender offers.

And it was later revealed that <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/09/24/oracle-is-reportedly-looking-to-raise-15b-in-corporate-bond-sale/\">Oracle sold $18 billion in bonds</a> to pay for these data centers.</p>\n<p>On their own, each deal is dizzying in scale.

The experience feels similar to a news app or a social feed — something you check first thing in the morning — but doesn’t have posts from other users or ads (yet).</p>\n<p>Pulse is part of a new class of OpenAI products that work independently, even when users aren’t in the ChatGPT app. The company would like to deliver a lot more of these features and roll them out to free users, but they’re limited by the number of computer servers available to them. OpenAI said it can only offer Pulse to its $200-a-month Pro subscribers right now due to capacity constraints.</p>\n<div>\n\t\t<p>Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t<p><span>San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>October 27-29, 2025</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n<p>The real question is whether features like Pulse are worth the hundreds of billions of dollars being invested in AI data centers to support OpenAI.

He started gaming at age 6, he told TechCrunch. Lootlock was selected for TechCrunch’s 2025 <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/startup-battlefield/\">Startup Battlefield 200</a> and will be exhibiting at <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-disrupt-2025/\">TechCrunch Disrupt</a>, October 27 to 29 in San Francisco. </p>\n<p>As he gabbed about gaming with other parents, or simply read the news, he kept hearing horror stories of kids shackling their parents with <a href=\"https://www.morningstar.com/news/marketwatch/2025071478/how-to-keep-your-kids-roblox-or-fortnite-habit-from-wrecking-your-credit-card-bill\" target=\"_blank\">surprise credit card bills</a>, sometimes unwittingly running up <a href=\"https://abcnews.go.com/GMA/Family/parents-share-warning-after-son-spends-4000-playing/story?id=108845824\" target=\"_blank\">thousands of dollars</a>.  </p>\n<p>The gaming industry has a notoriously slimy side of using “design tricks,” as the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau <a href=\"https://www.consumerfinance.gov/about-us/newsroom/consumer-advisory-video-games-are-targeting-your-children-to-get-into-your-wallet/\" target=\"_blank\">described last year.</a> They often target children, enticing them into unlocking fee-incurring game features. Other agencies, like the FTC have issued <a href=\"https://consumer.ftc.gov/consumer-alerts/2025/04/what-know-about-kids-video-games-ads-unexpected-payments\" target=\"_blank\">similar warnings</a>.  </p>\n<p>“The gaming industry uses clever design, social engineering, and player tracking to encourage kids to spend more money while playing,” Pompa said. “I am an avid gamer, so I have seen firsthand the drastic shift to micro-transactions in the industry over the last eight to nine years.” </p>\n<p>Although the FTC did force Fortnight earlier this year to refund <a href=\"https://www.ftc.gov/enforcement/refunds/fortnite-refunds\" target=\"_blank\">$126 million to people who filed claims,</a> that’s rare. Parents generally have no recourse but to pay.  </p>\n<p>The typical advice is for parents to use device-level parental controls that block in-app purchases. But, Pompa said, many of his parent friends are fine with letting kids spend a little money on such purchases, under the right conditions.  </p>\n<div>\n\t\t<p>Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t<p><span>San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>October 27-29, 2025</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n<p>He told the story of the friend named Joe that inspired Pompa to build Lootlock. Joe is a dad to three kids, all avid gamers. Joe gives each kid an allowance every month, and the kids were using the money to buy gaming products, setting up a ridiculous system where he handed them allowance cash and they handed it back to pay the credit card. And he had to monitor their purchases closely.  </p>\n<p>Looklock lets parents automatically load a digital, prepaid credit card, issued by Lootlock’s partner, Transcard, that kids add to their device’s digital wallet.  </p>\n<p>Parents can automate a set amount of allowance to be added to the card, say weekly or monthly, and can then make any portion of that not immediately available. The kid can unlock more as they, for instance, complete their chores. Parents can approve increases to the card through a text message. </p>\n<figure><img src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Lootlock.png?w=680\" alt=\"Looklock gaming parental control app\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Lootlock.png 1688w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Lootlock.png?resize=150,76 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Lootlock.png?resize=300,151 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Lootlock.png?resize=768,387 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Lootlock.png?resize=680,342 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Lootlock.png?resize=1200,604 1200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Lootlock.png?resize=1280,645 1280w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Lootlock.png?resize=430,217 430w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Lootlock.png?resize=720,363 720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Lootlock.png?resize=900,453 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Lootlock.png?resize=800,403 800w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Lootlock.png?resize=1536,773 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Lootlock.png?resize=668,336 668w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Lootlock.png?resize=1225,617 1225w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Lootlock.png?resize=708,357 708w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Lootlock.png?resize=50,25 50w\" /><figcaption><span>Looklock gaming parental control app</span><span><strong>Image Credits:</strong>Lootlock</span></figcaption></figure>\n<p>“We’re giving the parents super granular controls on how their kids can spend and when their kids can spend,” Pompa said. </p>\n<p>Lootlock is gamifying chores, too, with an upcoming feature that will be available in October called “bounty boards.”  Parents set up these boards which are essentially lists of the child’s chores. As the kids complete them — cleaning their room, pet care, etc. — they earn a “bounty.” And when they hit whatever threshold of bounties a parent sets, the app will unlock additional allowance to spend.  </p>\n<p>There’s also a gamified financial education component. Kids choose an avatar and as they practice good spending habits, like checking their Lootlock dashboard which tells them their account balances, they earn points that add up to equipment for their avatar: swords and armor, etc. Their avatar is persistent across anywhere Lootlock integrates into, like its Discord servers. </p>\n<p>“We’re tying all of the financial concepts into a video game concept,” Pompa said. </p>\n<p>Lootlock balances are also restricted to spending only on gaming products and can’t be used for other purchases on the internet. So parents don’t have to closely monitor what kinds of items the child is buying online. The idea, for now, is to focus on teaching children responsible gaming.  </p>\n<p>The startup currently employs seven people and is fully bootstrapped. </p>\n<p><em>If you want to learn from Lootlock firsthand, and see dozens of additional pitches, valuable workshops, and make the connections that drive business results, </em><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-disrupt-2025/tickets/?promo=postinclusion_sb200startup&utm_campaign=disrupt2025&utm_content=ticketsales&utm_medium=post&utm_source=tc\"><em>head here to learn more about this year’s Disrupt</em></a><em>, held October 27 to 29 in San Francisco.</em><br /></p>\n<figure><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-disrupt-2025/tickets/?promo=postinclusion_sb200startup&utm_campaign=disrupt2025&utm_content=ticketsales&utm_medium=post&utm_source=tc\"><img src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/TC25_Disrupt_General_Article_No-Anniversary_Headers_1920x1080.png?w=680\" alt=\"TechCrunch Disrupt 2025\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/TC25_Disrupt_General_Article_No-Anniversary_Headers_1920x1080.png 1920w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/TC25_Disrupt_General_Article_No-Anniversary_Headers_1920x1080.png?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/TC25_Disrupt_General_Article_No-Anniversary_Headers_1920x1080.png?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/TC25_Disrupt_General_Article_No-Anniversary_Headers_1920x1080.png?resize=768,432 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/TC25_Disrupt_General_Article_No-Anniversary_Headers_1920x1080.png?resize=680,383 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/TC25_Disrupt_General_Article_No-Anniversary_Headers_1920x1080.png?resize=1200,675 1200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/TC25_Disrupt_General_Article_No-Anniversary_Headers_1920x1080.png?resize=1280,720 1280w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/TC25_Disrupt_General_Article_No-Anniversary_Headers_1920x1080.png?resize=430,242 430w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/TC25_Disrupt_General_Article_No-Anniversary_Headers_1920x1080.png?resize=720,405 720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/TC25_Disrupt_General_Article_No-Anniversary_Headers_1920x1080.png?resize=900,506 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/TC25_Disrupt_General_Article_No-Anniversary_Headers_1920x1080.png?resize=800,450 800w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/TC25_Disrupt_General_Article_No-Anniversary_Headers_1920x1080.png?resize=1536,864 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/TC25_Disrupt_General_Article_No-Anniversary_Headers_1920x1080.png?resize=668,375 668w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/TC25_Disrupt_General_Article_No-Anniversary_Headers_1920x1080.png?resize=1097,617 1097w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/TC25_Disrupt_General_Article_No-Anniversary_Headers_1920x1080.png?resize=708,398 708w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/TC25_Disrupt_General_Article_No-Anniversary_Headers_1920x1080.png?resize=50,28 50w\" /></a></figure>\n</div>"

Haugen said in congressional testimony that Facebook was “<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2021/oct/07/facebooks-role-in-myanmar-and-ethiopia-under-new-scrutiny\" target=\"_blank\">literally fanning ethnic violence</a>” in Ethiopia, since content moderation efforts in non-English languages were under-resourced.

    "body": "<div>\n<p>Venture capitalists have convinced themselves they’ve found the next big investing edge: using AI to wring software-like margins out of traditionally labor-intensive services businesses. The strategy involves acquiring mature professional services firms, implementing AI to automate tasks, then using the improved cash flow to roll up more companies.</p>\n<p>Leading the charge is General Catalyst (GC), which has dedicated $1.5 billion of its latest fundraise to what it calls a “creation” strategy that’s focused on incubating AI-native software companies in specific verticals, then using those companies as acquisition vehicles to buy established firms — and their customers — in the same sectors. GC has placed bets across seven industries, from legal services to IT management, with plans to expand to up to 20 sectors altogether.</p>\n<p>“Services globally is a $16 trillion revenue a year globally,” said <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.generalcatalyst.com/team/marc-bhargava\">Marc Bhargava</a>, who leads GC’s related efforts, in a <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/general-catalysts-plan-to-eat-the-%2416-trillion/id1498270180?i=1000725773510\">recent interview with TechCrunch</a>. “In comparison, software is only $1 trillion globally,” he noted, adding that the allure of software investing has always been its higher margins. “As you get software to scale, there’s very little marginal cost and there’s a great deal of marginal revenue.” If you can automate services business, too, he said – tackling 30% to 50% of those companies with AI, and even automating up to 70% of those core tasks in the case of call centers – the math begins to look irresistible.</p>\n<p>The improved cash flow then provides ammunition for acquiring additional companies at higher prices than traditional buyers can afford, creating what proponents see as a lucrative flywheel.</p>\n<p>The game plan seems to be working. Take <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.crn.com/news/channel-news/2025/titan-scores-74m-funding-to-build-ai-platform-and-acquire-msps-to-use-it\">Titan MSP</a>, one of General Catalyst’s portfolio companies. The investment firm provided $74 million over two tranches to help the company develop AI tools for managed service providers, then it acquired RFA, a well-known IT services firm. Through pilot programs, says Bhargava, Titan demonstrated it could automate 38% of typical MSP tasks. The company now plans to use its improved margins to acquire additional MSPs in a classic roll-up strategy.</p>\n<p>Similarly, the firm incubated <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/eudia-secures-up-to-105m-in-series-a-funding-led-by-general-catalyst-to-transform-legal-work-through-ai-powered-augmented-intelligence-302375331.html\">Eudia</a>, which focuses on in-house legal departments rather than law firms. Eudia has signed up Fortune 100 clients including Chevron, Southwest Airlines, and Stripe, offering fixed-fee legal services powered by AI rather than traditional hourly billing. The company recently acquired Johnson Hanna, an alternative legal service provider, to expand its reach.</p>\n<p>General Catalyst looks to double – at least – the EBITDA margin of those companies that it’s acquiring, Bhargava explained.</p>\n<div>\n\t\t<p>Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t<p><span>San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>October 27-29, 2025</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n<p>The powerhouse firm isn’t alone in this thinking. The venture firm Mayfield has carved out $100 million specifically for “AI teammates” investments and led the Series A for Gruve, an IT consulting startup that acquired a $5 million security consulting company and grew it to $15 million in revenue within six months while achieving an 80% gross margin, according to its founders.</p>\n<p>“If 80% of the work will be done by AI, it can have an 80% to 90% gross margin,” Navin Chaddha, Mayfield’s managing director, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/06/29/why-ai-will-eat-mckinseys-lunch-but-not-today/\">told TechCrunch this summer</a>. “You could have blended margins of 60% to 70% and produce 20% to 30% net income.”</p>\n<p>Solo investor Elad Gil has been pursuing a similar strategy for three years, backing companies that acquire mature businesses and transform them with AI. “If you own the asset, you can [transform it] much more rapidly than if you’re just selling software as a vendor,” Gil said in an <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/06/01/early-ai-investor-elad-gil-finds-his-next-big-bet-ai-powered-rollups/\">interview with TechCrunch this spring</a>. “And because you take the gross margin of a company from, say, 10% to 40%, that’s a huge lift.”</p>\n<p>But early warning signs suggest this whole services-industry metamorphosis may be <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/09/27/beware-coworkers-who-produce-ai-generated-workslop/\">more complicated</a> than VCs anticipate. A recent study by researchers at Stanford Social Media Lab and BetterUp Labs that surveyed 1,150 full-time employees across industries found that 40% of those employees are having to shoulder more work because of what the researchers call “workslop” – AI-generated work that appears polished but lacks substance, creating more work (and headaches) for colleagues.</p>\n<p>The trend is taking a toll on the organizations. Employees involved in the survey say they’re spending an average of nearly two hours dealing with each instance of workslop, including to first decipher it, then decide whether or not to send it back, and oftentimes just to fix it themselves. </p>\n<p>Based on those participants’ estimates of time spent, along with their self-reported salaries, the authors of the survey estimate that workslop carries an invisible tax of $186 per month per person. “For an organization of 10,000 workers, given the estimated prevalence of workslop . . .this yields over <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://hbr.org/2025/09/ai-generated-workslop-is-destroying-productivity\">$9 million per year in lost productivity</a>,” they write in a new Harvard Business Review article.</p>\n<p>Simply implementing AI doesn’t guarantee improved outcomes, in short. </p>\n<p>Bhargava disputes the notion that AI is overhyped, arguing instead that all these implementation failures actually validate General Catalyst’s approach. “I think it kind of shows the opportunity, which is, it’s not easy to apply AI technology to these businesses,” he said. “If all the Fortune 100 and all these folks could just bring in a consulting firm, slap on some AI, get a contract with OpenAI, and transform their business, then obviously our thesis [would be] a little bit less robust. But the reality is, it’s really hard to transform a company with AI.”</p>\n<p>He pointed to the technical sophistication required in AI as the most critical missing puzzle piece. “There’s a lot of different technology. It’s good at different things,” he said. “You really need these applied AI engineers from places like Rippling and Ramp and Figma and Scale, who have worked with the different models, understand their nuances, understand which ones are good for what, understand how to wrap it in software.”  That complexity is exactly why General Catalyst’s strategy of pairing AI specialists with industry experts to build companies from the ground up makes sense, he argued.</p>\n<p>Still, there’s no denying that workslop threatens to undermine the strategy’s core economics. The bigger question is how severe the problem is and whether or not that picture changes over time. </p>\n<p>For the time being, if companies reduce staff as the AI efficiency thesis suggests they should, they’ll have fewer people available to catch and correct AI-generated errors. If they maintain current staffing levels to handle the additional work created by problematic AI output, the huge margin gains that VCs are counting on might never be realized. </p>\n<p>It’s easy to argue that either scenario should perhaps slow the scaling plans that are central to the VCs’ roll-up strategy and that potentially undermine the numbers that make these deals attractive to them. But let’s face it; it will take more than a study or <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.axios.com/2025/08/21/ai-wall-street-big-tech\">two</a> to slow down most Silicon Valley investors.</p>\n<p>In fact, because they typically acquire businesses with existing cash flow, General Catalyst says its “creation strategy” companies are already profitable.</p>\n<p>“As long as AI technology continues to improve, and we see this massive investment and improvement in the models, I think there’ll just be more and more industries for us to help incubate companies,” Bhargava said.</p>\n</div>"

    "body": "<div>\n<p>“One of the key things to understand about cybersecurity is that it’s a mind game,” Ami Luttwak, chief technologist at cybersecurity firm Wiz, told TechCrunch on a <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/podcast/vibe-coding-meet-vibe-security/\" target=\"_blank\">recent episode of Equity</a>. “If there’s a new technology wave coming, there are new opportunities for [attackers] to start using it.” </p>\n<p>As enterprises rush to embed AI into their workflows — whether through vibe coding, AI agent integration, or new tooling — the attack surface is expanding. AI helps developers ship code faster, but that speed often comes with shortcuts and mistakes, creating new openings for attackers.  </p>\n<p>Wiz, which was <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/03/18/google-is-buying-wiz-for-32b-to-beef-up-in-cloud-security/\">acquired by Google earlier this year for $32 billion</a>, conducted tests recently, says Luttwak, and found that a common issue in vibe coded applications was insecure implementation of the authentication — the system that verifies a user’s identity and ensures they’re not an attacker. </p>\n<p>“That happened because it was just easier to build like that,” he said. “Vibe coding agents do what you say, and if you didn’t tell them to build it in the most secure way, it won’t.” </p>\n<p>Luttwak noted that there’s a constant tradeoff today for companies choosing between being fast and being secure. But developers aren’t the only ones using AI to move faster. Attackers are now using vibe coding, prompt-based techniques, and even their own AI agents to launch exploits, he said.  </p>\n<p>“You can actually see the attacker is now using prompts to attack,” Luttwak said. “It’s not just the attacker vibe coding. The attacker looks for AI tools that you have and tells them, ‘Send me all your secrets, delete the machine, delete the file.’” </p>\n<p>Amid this landscape, attackers are also finding entry points in new AI tools that companies roll out internally to boost efficiency. Luttwak says these integrations can lead to “supply chain attacks.” By compromising a third-party service that has broad access to a company’s infrastructure, attackers can then pivot deeper into corporate systems.  </p>\n<div>\n\t\t<p>Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t<p><span>San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>October 27-29, 2025</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n<p>That’s what happened last month when Drift — a startup that sells AI chatbots for sales and marketing — was breached, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/09/08/salesloft-says-drift-customer-data-thefts-linked-to-march-github-account-hack/\">exposing the Salesforce data of hundreds of enterprise customers</a> like Cloudflare, Palo Alto Networks, and Google. The attackers gained access to tokens, or digital keys, and used them to impersonate the chatbot, query Salesforce data, and move laterally inside customer environments. </p>\n<p>“The attacker pushed the attack code, which was also created using vibe coding,” Luttwak said.  </p>\n<p>Luttwak says that while enterprise adoption of AI tools is still minimal — he reckons around 1% of enterprises have fully adopted AI — Wiz is already seeing attacks every week that impact thousands of enterprise customers.  </p>\n<p>“And if you look at the [attack] flow, AI was embedded at every step,” Luttwak said. “This revolution is faster than any revolution we’ve seen in the past. It means that we as an industry need to move faster.” </p>\n<p>Luttwak pointed to another major supply chain attack, dubbed “s1ingularity,” in August on <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2023/09/25/nx-lands-16m-to-build-monorepo-tools-for-software-devs/\">Nx</a>, a popular build system for JavaScript developers. Attackers managed to unleash malware into the system, which then detected the presence of AI developer tools like Claude and Gemini and hijacked them to autonomously scan the system for valuable data.  The attack compromised thousands of developer tokens and keys, giving attackers access to private GitHub repositories.  </p>\n<p>Luttwak says that despite the threats, this has been an exciting time to be a leader in cybersecurity. Wiz, founded in 2020, was originally focused on helping organizations identify and address misconfigurations, vulnerabilities, and other security risks across cloud environments.  </p>\n<p>Over the last year, Wiz has expanded its capabilities to keep up with the speed of AI-related attacks — and to use AI for its own products.  </p>\n<p>Last September, Wiz launched Wiz Code that focuses on securing the software development lifecycle by identifying and mitigating security issues early in the development process, so companies can be “secure by design.” In April, Wiz launched Wiz Defend, which offers runtime protection by detecting and responding to active threats within cloud environments.  </p>\n<p>Luttwak said that it’s vital for Wiz to fully understand the applications of their customers if the startup is going to help with what he calls “horizontal security.” </p>\n<p>“We need to understand why you’re building it … so I can build the security tool that no one has ever had before, the security tool that understands you,” he said. </p>\n<h3 id=\"h-from-day-one-you-need-to-have-a-ciso-nbsp\"><strong>‘From day one, you need to have a CISO’</strong> </h3>\n<p>The democratization of AI tools has resulted in a flood of new startups promising to solve enterprise pain points. But Luttwak says enterprises shouldn’t just send all of their company, employee, and customer data to “every small SaaS company that has five employees just because they say, ‘Give me all your data, and I will give you amazing AI insights.’” </p>\n<p>Of course, those startups need that data if their offering is going to have any value. Luttwak says that means it’s incumbent upon them to make sure they’re operating like a secure organization from the start.  </p>\n<p>“From day one, you need to think about security and compliance,” he said. “From day one, you need to have a CISO (chief information security officer). Even if you have five people.” </p>\n<p>Before writing a single line of code, startups should think like a highly secure organization, he said. They need to consider enterprise security features, audit logs, authentication, access to production, development practices, security ownership, and single sign-on. Planning this way from the start means you won’t have to overhaul processes later and incur what Luttwak calls “security debt.” And if you aim to sell to enterprises, you’ll already be prepared to protect their data. </p>\n<p>“We were SOC2 compliant [a compliance framework] before we had code,” he said. “And I can tell you a secret. Getting SOC2 compliance for five employees is much easier than for 500 employees.” </p>\n<p>The next most important step for startups is to think about architecture, he said.  </p>\n<p>“If you’re an AI startup that wants to focus on enterprise from day one, you have to think about an architecture that allows the data of the customer to stay … in the customer environment.” </p>\n<p>For cybersecurity startups looking to step into the field in the age of AI, Luttwak says now’s the time. Everything from phishing protection and email security to malware and endpoint protection is fertile ground for innovation ‚ both for attackers and defenders. The same is true for startups that could help with workflow and automation tools to do “vibe security,” since many security teams still don’t know how to use AI to defend against AI. </p>\n<p>“The game is open,” Luttwak said. “If every area of security now has new attacks, then it means we have to rethink every part of security.” </p>\n</div>"
