We apologise to those who have faced delays, but by working together with airlines, the vast majority of flights have continued to operate.”</p>\n<p>Heathrow, like other affected airports, has recommended that travelers arrive at least three hours before departure for long-haul flights, and at least two hours beforehand for short-haul flights.</p>\n</div>"

    "body": "<div>\n<p>The MBA-to-VC pipeline remains a very real thing. But that path is a little shakier than it once was, according to <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://pitchbook.com/news/articles/is-an-mba-still-worth-it-if-you-want-to-make-it-in-vc\">PitchBook reporting</a> and new academic research.</p>\n<p>Harvard placed 50 of its 1,004 MBA graduates into VC roles in 2024, with a median starting salary of $177,500. Stanford placed around 30 from its smaller class. More than 10,000 Harvard, Stanford, and Wharton MBA alumni currently hold senior positions at U.S. VC firms, PitchBook data shows.</p>\n<p>The MBA’s grip on venture capital is loosening, however, according to Stanford professor Ilya Strebulaev, who found that 44% of mid-career venture professionals held MBAs in the early 2000s, compared to 32% today.</p>\n<p>What’s driving the change? VC has evolved beyond traditional sectors into AI and hardware, where technical experience beats business school credentials, so firms are increasingly scanning talent from companies like <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.theinformation.com/articles/former-openai-exec-joins-spark-capital-as-venture-push-into-ai-heats-up\">OpenAI</a> and <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://foundersfund.com/team/scott-nolan/\">SpaceX</a> rather than elite MBA programs. “There is less appetite for MBAs currently,” executive recruiter Will Champagne tells PitchBook. </p>\n<p>Students haven’t gotten the memo yet; Stanford’s VC club still boasts 600 members out of the roughly 850 MBA students on campus. They’re paying a steep price, too. Nabbing an MBA at a top program can cost more than $200,000.</p>\n</div>"

    "body": "<div>\n<p><br />Google is ending its enterprise subscription to the Financial Times, and it’s not the only enterprise media subscription on the chopping block, sources say. The cuts reflect broader cost-reduction efforts at the search giant, even as the company reports strong financial performance.</p>\n<p>Google has been implementing cost reductions across 2025, including eliminating <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2025/08/27/google-executive-says-company-has-cut-a-third-of-its-managers.html\">35% of managers</a> who oversee teams of three people or fewer, and offering voluntary exit programs across multiple divisions since January. Finance chief Anat Ashkenazi signaled late <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2024/10/29/google-cfo-says-company-can-push-a-little-further-in-cost-savings.html\">last year </a>that the company would continue to push cost cuts “a little further,” a mandate that appears unchanged despite Alphabet reporting strong Q2 2025 results with $96.4 billion in revenue.</p>\n<p>These cuts may save Google mere thousands; they also come as Google faces increasingly strained relationships with news publishers. <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://digiday.com/media/google-ai-overviews-linked-to-25-drop-in-publisher-referral-traffic-new-data-shows/\">August data</a> from the trade association Digital Content Next showed median referral traffic from Google Search to publishers fell 10% between May and June of this year, with non-news brands experiencing 14% drops. </p>\n<p>Major outlets, including CNN, Business Insider, and HuffPost have reportedly seen even sharper traffic declines (of <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.npr.org/2025/07/31/nx-s1-5484118/google-ai-overview-online-publishers\">30%, 40%, and 40%</a>, respectively), according to data from SimilarWeb.</p>\n<p>Publishers attribute these declines largely to Google’s AI Overviews feature, which has reduced click-throughs to external websites from 56% to 69% since its launch, according to Pew Research. This spring, Pew analyzed data from 900 U.S. adults, six in ten of whom conducted at least one Google search in March 2025 that produced an AI-generated summary.</p>\n<p>The traffic decline comes as Google has largely resisted content licensing, unlike rival OpenAI, which has signed deals with numerous major publishers including <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://aboutus.ft.com/press_release/openai\">The Financial Times</a>, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2024/05/22/business/media/openai-news-corp-content-deal.html\">News Corp</a>, and Axel Springer. So far at least, Google has struck few deals, including one with the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/01/15/google-inks-deal-with-the-associated-press-to-bring-more-real-time-info-to-gemini/\">Associated Press</a> and an annual Reddit agreement reportedly worth <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.reuters.com/technology/reddit-ai-content-licensing-deal-with-google-sources-say-2024-02-22/\">$60 million</a> per year.

    "body": "<div>\n<p>Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang descended on the United Kingdom this week, armed with a pledge to invest £2 billion ($2.6 billion) to supercharge the country’s AI startup ecosystem. Wayve, the U.K.-based self-driving tech startup, could be one of those to receive funds from Nvidia’s AI investment commitment, the company told TechCrunch.</p>\n<p>Wayve said it has signed a letter of intent with Nvidia to evaluate a $500 million strategic investment in the U.K. startup’s next funding round. Nvidia participated in Wayve’s $1.05 billion Series C round that closed in May 2024. </p>\n<p>A Wayve spokesperson confirmed that the $500 million tentative commitment is part of Nvidia’s AI startup investment pledge.</p>\n<p>Nvidia said during an event Thursday the <a href=\"https://nvidianews.nvidia.com/news/nvidia-announces-investment-in-the-united-kingdom-ai-startup-ecosystem\" target=\"_blank\">£2 billion commitment</a> would include funds from venture-capital investors Accel, Air Street Capital, Balderton, Hoxton Ventures, and Phoenix Court. An Nvidia spokesperson declined to comment on the letter of intent announcement.</p>\n<p>Wayve co-founder and CEO Alex Kendall wouldn’t provide TechCrunch with a projected closing date for its Series D round. Kendall did say the company was “working quickly towards it.”</p>\n<p>Wayve, which launched in 2017, has gained attention and investors for its automated driving system that uses a self-learning versus rules-based approach to its self-driving software. Wayve’s end-to-end neural network doesn’t require high-definition maps and only uses data to teach the vehicle how to drive. That data-driven learning approach is used for “eyes on” assisted driving and an “eyes off” fully automated driving system. </p>\n<p>The company plans to sell its “Embodied AI” to automakers and other tech companies.</p>\n<div>\n\t\t<p>Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t<p><span>San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>October 27-29, 2025</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n<p>Wayve’s self-learning approach, which is similar to the strategy that Tesla uses, is seen as particularly appealing to automakers because it’s not reliant on specific sensors or maps. This means Wayve’s system can work with existing sensors like cameras and radar. The automated driving software captures data from those sensors, which directly informs the driving decisions of the system.</p>\n<p>And while Wayve’s software can run on whatever chip its OEM partners already have in their vehicles, the startup has had a close development relationship with Nvidia since 2018. </p>\n<p>Wayve’s generation 2 self-driving platform, which is integrated into its Ford Mach E test vehicles, uses Nvidia GPUs. This week, the startup unveiled gen 3, a platform that uses the in-vehicle compute autonomous vehicle development kit called Nvidia Drive AGX Thor. The gen 3 will allow Wayve to offer eyes-off advanced driving-assistance systems and Level 4 driverless features that will work on city streets and highways.</p>\n<p>Nvidia, and in particular Huang, seems keen to be part of Wayve’s future. </p>\n<p>“The next trillion-dollar company, you guys,” Huang said in a video featuring his first ride in a Wayve-equipped vehicle on public streets in London. The video, which was viewed by TechCrunch and is slated to be released soon, shows Huang handing Kendall Nvidia’s Thor developer kit.</p>\n<p>“We picked him up from his hotel and went for a drive around Central London through some really busy streets, including Hyde Park corner — that’s this massive roundabout here,” Kendall said in an interview Friday. “I really loved that experience, and it was cool to show him what we’ve always been building on as a result of Nvidia’s platform over the years.”</p>\n</div><div>\n<div><p>\n\t\tKirsten Korosec is a reporter and editor who has covered the future of transportation from EVs and autonomous vehicles to urban air mobility and in-car tech for more than a decade.

    "body": "<div>\n<p>U.K.-based fintech <a href=\"https://www.tide.co/\" target=\"_blank\">Tide</a> has entered the unicorn club with a fresh funding of $120 million led by TPG, as the startup now serves over 1.6 million micro and small enterprises globally — with more than half of them based in India, the company’s largest and fastest-growing market.</p>\n<p>The new round — a mix of primary and secondary investment, though the startup declined to confirm the exact split — values the eight-year-old startup at $1.5 billion. It includes share sales by employees, early angels, and a few minority investors. TPG backed the round through its multi-sector impact vehicle, The Rise Fund, which has invested in over 85 mission-driven companies. Existing investor, the Apax Digital Funds, also participated.</p>\n<p>Globally, micro and small enterprises, including contractors, freelancers, and solopreneurs, spend a significant amount of time on business management tasks like accounting, invoicing, taxes, securing loans, and managing payments and expenses. While traditional banks and fintech startups offer services to this segment, most solutions are not purpose-built for their unique needs. Tide aims to change that with its unified business platform, offering tailored tools such as accounting integrations, invoicing, business loans, asset finance, payroll, expense cards, and even company registration.</p>\n<p>Initially <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2017/07/03/uks-tide-raises-14m-to-challenge-big-banks-with-a-mobile-first-service-for-smbs/\" target=\"_blank\">launched</a> in the U.K. in 2017, Tide expanded into India in December 2022 to tap into the country’s vast base of small enterprises — <a href=\"https://www.pib.gov.in/PressReleasePage.aspx?PRID=2099687\" target=\"_blank\">around 60 million micro and small businesses</a> employing over 250 million people, per the recent Indian government data. Since its entry, Tide has onboarded more than 800,000 Indian businesses, which it refers to as “members” — surpassing its U.K. member base of nearly 800,000. In the U.K., where Tide is already profitable, the company serves around 14% of the country’s small and medium business market.</p>\n<p>“There is a huge trend to formalization. So, our biggest enemy is cash, and not any competitors,” said Oliver Prill, CEO of Tide, in an interview.</p>\n<p>“In India, there’s a debate, as the growth rate slowed a little bit, but it’s still a hugely impressive growth rate. You look at continental Europe or the U.K., the growth rate is a lot less,” he told TechCrunch.</p>\n<p>Tide estimates that around four million micro and small businesses are launched in India every year. These businesses typically seek support in areas like accessing formal credit, accepting Indian government-backed Unified Payments Interface (UPI) for payments, and navigating the country’s indirect tax system, the Goods and Services Tax. Tide serves them through its digital platform, available as an app on both iOS and Android.</p>\n<div>\n\t\t<p>Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t<p><span>San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>October 27-29, 2025</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n<p>The U.K. startup expects to onboard one million businesses in India by the end of this year and is already seeing strong demand from tier-3 cities and beyond (referring to smaller, less urbanized towns with limited digital and financial infrastructure), Gurjodhpal Singh, CEO of Tide India, told TechCrunch.</p>\n<p>In India, Tide works with around 25 lenders on its platform to facilitate credit for small businesses, recommending partners based on each business’s needs. The company also offers services such as fixed deposits, bill payments, bank transfers, and cash withdrawals through ATMs.</p>\n<p>In addition to the U.K. and India, Tide launched in Germany in May 2024 and expanded into France earlier this month. The startup offers a tailored experience in each market, including local language support.</p>\n<p>With the fresh funding, Tide plans to expand further geographically, enhance its product, and invest in agentic AI. </p>\n<p>The startup covers a range of finance and admin services already, but there are still some gaps to fill. “In the next few months and quarters, you’ll see some major developments in that area,” Prill said, referring to upcoming product launches enabled by the latest funding round.</p>\n<p>Tide currently employs over 2,500 people across its global operations.</p>\n</div>"

    "body": "<div>\n<p>There’s a new buzzy fashion startup in town. Meet Phia, the shopping app founded by Bill Gates’ daughter Phoebe Gates and her Stanford roommate-slash co-founder, Sophia Kianni. </p>\n<p>Phia searches the web to help users compare the price of fashion items. It’s a mobile app and browser extension that’s essentially “Google flights for fashion,” as the company bills itself.</p>\n<p>“As we think about what the future of fashion is going to be like five years ago now, it’s all going to be about making access a lot easier to things that people haven’t had access to before,” Gates told TechCrunch.</p>\n<p>The app is<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/06/16/alta-raises-11m-to-bring-clueless-fashion-tech-to-life-with-all-star-investors/\"> one of the many fashion startups</a> to arise in this era of artificial intelligence, seeking to bring more ease to the online e-commerce world. </p>\n<p>Investors and consumers are loving this category so far. Even Phia, which just launched in April, said it already has around 500,000 users. </p>\n<p>In early September, it also announced <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://fortune.com/2025/09/17/fashion-tech-phia-fundraise-seed-round-phoebe-gates-kleiner-perkins/\">an $8 million seed round </a>that took only three-and-a-half weeks to raise, said the 23-year-old Gates. The round was led by Kleiner Perkins, with other investors including Kris Jenner and Hailey Bieber. </p>\n<p>Phia has now rolled out a new and improved search on the app that looks across more than 300 million fashion items, Kianni said. The goal is to make the e-commerce shopping experience seamless — a place where customers can see everything they’ve previously bought or searched for, and to find new items that would be of interest. </p>\n<div>\n\t\t<p>Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t<p><span>San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>October 27-29, 2025</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n<p>Gates and Kianni met two years ago and started working on the app just around a year after they met. The first product they built was a desktop Chrome extension that helped users find second-hand alternatives while they were online shopping. “It was pretty buggy,” Kianni recalled. </p>\n<figure><img src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/newAppSS_1.png?w=314\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/newAppSS_1.png 886w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/newAppSS_1.png?resize=69,150 69w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/newAppSS_1.png?resize=138,300 138w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/newAppSS_1.png?resize=768,1664 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/newAppSS_1.png?resize=314,680 314w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/newAppSS_1.png?resize=554,1200 554w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/newAppSS_1.png?resize=591,1280 591w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/newAppSS_1.png?resize=198,430 198w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/newAppSS_1.png?resize=332,720 332w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/newAppSS_1.png?resize=415,900 415w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/newAppSS_1.png?resize=369,800 369w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/newAppSS_1.png?resize=709,1536 709w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/newAppSS_1.png?resize=308,668 308w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/newAppSS_1.png?resize=173,375 173w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/newAppSS_1.png?resize=285,617 285w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/newAppSS_1.png?resize=245,531 245w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/newAppSS_1.png?resize=23,50 23w\" /></figure>\n<p>User feedback also revealed that most of their peers were shopping on their phones, not on their desktops. Plus, Kianni said, young people were more interested in instant price checks, rather than second-hand comparisons. “We decided to really adjust our focus,” she said. </p>\n<p>“We should have known this honestly from our own behavior,” Gates added. “The girl who’s obsessively shopping and scrolling all the time is often doing it on her phone; laptop more when she’s working, but the phone is key.” </p>\n<p>So, Gates and Kianni started building a new app. </p>\n<p>Kiannia said the first check Phia received actually came from one of Stanford’s social entrepreneurship programs. Once traction started to increase, Gates and Kianni decided that the further execution of their vision required venture capital. </p>\n<p>They researched the top-tier funds to pitch for their round and especially wanted prominent women as investors. But before they could start the hustle of fundraising, Soma Capital cold-reached out to Kianni on LinkedIn after hearing about the product. The firm ended up providing one of the first institutional checks. </p>\n<p>“From there, they did end up introducing us to a ton of incredible people,” Kianni said. “We ended up both cold outreaching and then also getting other people to connect with us.” </p>\n<p>Their round is an amalgamation of some of the buzziest people in business and tech and a collision of two powerful networks. </p>\n<p>Kianni herself is a renowned activist, having <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/a-day-in-the-life-of-climate-activist-sophia-kianni-2021-6\">founded the nonprofit Climate Cardinals</a>, which translates information about climate change into different languages.

Soma ended up introducing them to the team at Kleiner Perkins, the firm that ultimately led this seed round.</p>\n<p>“I got my start in e-commerce, so I’ve always believed in the power of technology to transform how people shop online,” Rubin said in a statement to TechCrunch. “What excites me about Phia is how Phoebe and Sophia are bringing real innovation to the space by making shopping smarter and using technology to unlock a better experience for everyone.”</p>\n<p>So much of Phia’s marketing is quintessentially Gen Z, too: focused on organic, public-facing founder-led content. She and Gates, for example, are open about the experiments they run with Phia; they ask people to direct message them feedback, and have used social media to hire talent and source designers. And they <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/bill-gates-daughter-phoebe-phia-chatgpt-marketing-hacks-sophia-kianni-2025-6\">use ChatGPT to help</a> with marketing in the pursuit of making viral campaigns.</p>\n<p>They also receive some help getting attention for their product from their podcast called The Burnouts, also launched in April. It has <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.instagram.com/theburnouts/?hl=en\">almost half a million</a> followers on Instagram. Kianni said the podcast helps funnel interest into Phia, as it focuses on sharing career advice to young people, especially women. She said it has already amassed 10 million views across various social media platforms. </p>\n<p>The podcast has allowed them to “open source” how she and Gates are building their company, talking through all the stumbles and the hurdles, which in turn helps other people looking to start companies in this space, she continued. </p>\n<p>“We’ve taken a very digital-first approach to pretty much everything,” Kianni said. “I think it’s been part of the reason why we’ve seen such rapid traction.” </p>\n<p>Gates and Kianni said the fresh capital will be used mainly to build out the team (there are only 12 people at the moment), and they are hiring via social media, naturally. Overall, the duo sees Phia as the future of personalized shopping. </p>\n<p>Gates said she even hopes one day to build a personalized agent that can help sync to calendars and tell customers when to buy and what, what to resell, and what to keep. </p>\n<p>“There’s so much more that we still need to do, so much more we want to learn and grow,” Kianni added. “We want to be able to do that publicly, so that our audience can learn and grow alongside us.” </p>\n</div>"

    "body": "<div>\n<p>At a time of high anxiety around technology’s impact on arts and culture, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://lincolncenter.org/Collider\">Lincoln Center for the Performing Arts’ Collider Fellowship</a> is focused on new opportunities, welcoming multi-disciplinary artists to explore how emerging tech can transform live performance and the performing arts.</p>\n<p>Today, the famed New York performing arts center is announcing its second class of Collider Fellows — a group of six artists working in areas from virtual reality to artificial intelligence to the immersive 4DSound System.</p>\n<p>“I love that they’re all really thoughtful people who are not just thinking about [the work] itself, but how it fits into a larger conversation in arts and technology,” said Lincoln Center’s vice president of programming Jordana Leigh.</p>\n<p>Leigh added that she’s an “eternal optimist” about how tech can benefit the arts. When asked about broader worries around AI, she countered that she’s excited about artists who can use AI as “another tool in their toolkit, like a mixer for sound or a paintbrush for paint.” She also suggested that for some artists, “technology is catching up to their vision, versus their vision catching up to this technology.”</p>\n<p>To illustrate some of this potential, Leigh pointed to a recent Lincoln Center arts and tech commission, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.nonahendryx.com/dreammachine\">Dream Machine</a> by Nona Hendryx. By using a combination of AI, VR, and augmented reality to immerse visitors, especially BIPOC visitors, in Afrofuturist environments, Leigh said Dream Machine shows how art can help “people who do not see themselves in technology to start seeing themselves in it — particularly Black and Brown people, especially Black and Brown women.”</p>\n<p>“I think the more people who are part of the conversation, the more chance we have for it to be a good conversation,” she added.</p>\n<figure><img src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/HERO-2025-09-10_LCPA_AI_Collider_L1072724_LawrenceSumulong.jpg?w=680\" alt=\"Photo of the six new Collider Fellows\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/HERO-2025-09-10_LCPA_AI_Collider_L1072724_LawrenceSumulong.jpg 2000w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/HERO-2025-09-10_LCPA_AI_Collider_L1072724_LawrenceSumulong.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/HERO-2025-09-10_LCPA_AI_Collider_L1072724_LawrenceSumulong.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/HERO-2025-09-10_LCPA_AI_Collider_L1072724_LawrenceSumulong.jpg?resize=768,511 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/HERO-2025-09-10_LCPA_AI_Collider_L1072724_LawrenceSumulong.jpg?resize=680,453 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/HERO-2025-09-10_LCPA_AI_Collider_L1072724_LawrenceSumulong.jpg?resize=1200,799 1200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/HERO-2025-09-10_LCPA_AI_Collider_L1072724_LawrenceSumulong.jpg?resize=1280,852 1280w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/HERO-2025-09-10_LCPA_AI_Collider_L1072724_LawrenceSumulong.jpg?resize=430,286 430w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/HERO-2025-09-10_LCPA_AI_Collider_L1072724_LawrenceSumulong.jpg?resize=720,479 720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/HERO-2025-09-10_LCPA_AI_Collider_L1072724_LawrenceSumulong.jpg?resize=900,599 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/HERO-2025-09-10_LCPA_AI_Collider_L1072724_LawrenceSumulong.jpg?resize=800,532 800w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/HERO-2025-09-10_LCPA_AI_Collider_L1072724_LawrenceSumulong.jpg?resize=1536,1022 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/HERO-2025-09-10_LCPA_AI_Collider_L1072724_LawrenceSumulong.jpg?resize=668,445 668w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/HERO-2025-09-10_LCPA_AI_Collider_L1072724_LawrenceSumulong.jpg?resize=563,375 563w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/HERO-2025-09-10_LCPA_AI_Collider_L1072724_LawrenceSumulong.jpg?resize=927,617 927w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/HERO-2025-09-10_LCPA_AI_Collider_L1072724_LawrenceSumulong.jpg?resize=708,471 708w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/HERO-2025-09-10_LCPA_AI_Collider_L1072724_LawrenceSumulong.jpg?resize=50,33 50w\" /><figcaption><span><strong>Image Credits:</strong>Lawrence Sumulong/Lincoln Center for the Performing Arts</span></figcaption></figure>\n<p>The new Collider Fellows, selected through a nomination-based process, will continue exploring that potential. For the next nine months, they’ll be provided with studio space at Lincoln Center and <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.onassis.org/initiatives/onassis-digital-innovation/onx-studio\">Onassis ONX</a>, along with a financial stipend and support from Lincoln Center staff.</p>\n<div>\n\t\t<p>Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t<p><span>San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>October 27-29, 2025</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n<p>The Collider Fellowship, Leigh added, is part of a broader umbrella of programs through which the performing arts center seeks to support artists in “non-transactional” ways.</p>\n<p>Notably, the fellowship does not require participating artists to complete a final project or commission. Leigh said that the first class of Collider Fellows included one artist who completed “five or six prototypes” during the program, while another wanted to “take this time to rejuvenate, read tons of books, do tons of research, slow down” — she said both approaches are “completely acceptable ways to use this fellowship.”</p>\n<p>According to Leigh, many of the projects that emerged from that first class are “still germinating,” and some could potentially be shown at Lincoln Center itself. And while Leigh described herself as “doubling down on location-based experiences,” particularly those that involve VR, AR, and extended reality, she also suggested that the Collider Fellows could help Lincoln Center rethink the ways it can reach audiences globally.</p>\n<p>“I don’t think we’re closing the door to anything right now,” she said.</p>\n<p>Here are the six new Collider Fellows, with brief descriptions of their work:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cinthiachen.com/\">Cinthia Chen</a>, a multidisciplinary artist and technologist whose work (pictured above) combines performance, installation, and projection design to explore memory, hybrid identities, and spiritual futurism</li>\n<li><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://rolfes.team/\">Sam Rolfes</a>, a virtual performer, artist, and co-director of virtual performance studio Team Rolfes, whose work includes motion-capture performances, fashion and print design, and music visuals for Lady Gaga, Arca, Metallica, and Netflix</li>\n<li><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.jamesallistersprang.com/\">James Allister Sprang</a>, the first U.S.-based artist to work with 4D Sound System, creating immersive, sensory-based experiences that explore diasporic timelines and the Black interior</li>\n<li><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.stephaniedinkins.com/\">Stephanie Dinkins</a>, a transdisciplinary artist and educator focused on emerging technologies, race, and future histories, who was recently named one of Time Magazine’s 100 Most Influential people in AI</li>\n<li><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.kevinpeterhe.com/\">Kevin Peter He</a>, who draws on his background in cinema, dance, and urban transformation to work across film, performance, and game engines, exploring how structures and technologies shape narrative and embodiment</li>\n<li><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://rashaadnewsome.com/about/\">Dr. Rashaad Newsome</a>, a Whitney Biennial alum whose work combines collage, performance, AI, and robotics to explore Black and Queer cultural expression</li>\n</ul>\n</div><div>\n<div>\n\t<p>Anthony Ha is TechCrunch’s weekend editor.

    "body": "<div>\n<p>California’s state senate recently gave final approval to a new AI safety bill, SB 53, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/09/13/california-lawmakers-pass-ai-safety-bill-sb-53-but-newsom-could-still-veto/\">sending it to Governor Gavin Newsom</a> to either sign or veto.</p>\n<p>If this all sounds familiar, that’s because Newsom <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/09/29/gov-newsom-vetoes-californias-controversial-ai-bill-sb-1047/\">vetoed another AI safety bill</a>, also written by state senator Scott Wiener, last year. But SB 53 is narrower than Wiener’s previous SB 1047, with a focus on big AI companies making more than $500 million in annual revenue.</p>\n<p>I got the chance to discuss SB 53 with my colleagues Max Zeff and Kirsten Korosec on the latest episode of <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/podcasts/equity/\" target=\"_blank\">TechCrunch’s flagship podcast Equity</a>. Max believes that Wiener’s new bill has a better shot of becoming law, partly because of that big company focus, and because it’s been <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/09/08/anthropic-endorses-californias-ai-safety-bill-sb-53/\">endorsed by AI company Anthropic</a>.</p>\n<p>Read a preview of our conversation about AI safety and state-level legislation below. (I’ve edited the transcript for length and clarity, and to make us sound slightly smarter.)</p>\n<p><strong>Max:</strong> Why should you care about AI safety legislation that’s passing a chamber in California? We’re entering this era where AI companies are becoming the most powerful companies in the world, and this is going to be potentially one of the few checks on their power.</p>\n<p>This is much narrower than SB 1047, which got a lot of pushback last year. But I think SB 53 still puts some meaningful regulations on the AI labs. It makes them publish safety reports for their models. If they have an incident, it basically forces them to report that to the government. And it also, for employees at these labs, if they have concerns, gives them a channel to report that to the government and not face pushback from the companies, even though a lot of them have signed NDAs.</p>\n<p>To me, this feels like a potentially meaningful check on tech companies’ power, something we haven’t really had for the last couple of decades.</p>\n<div>\n\t\t<p>Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t<p><span>San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>October 27-29, 2025</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n<p><strong>Kirsten: </strong>To your point about why it matters at the state level, it’s important to think about the fact that it’s California. Every major AI company is pretty much, if not based here, it has a major footprint in this state. Not that other states don’t matter — I do not want to be getting emails from the folks in Colorado or whatever —  but it does matter that it’s specifically California because it’s really a hub of AI activity. </p>\n<p>My question for you, though, Max, is it just seems like there’s a lot of exceptions and carve-outs. It’s narrower, but is it more complicated than the previous [bill]?</p>\n<p><strong>Max:</strong> In some ways, yes. I would say the main carve-out of this bill is that it really tries to not apply to small startups. And basically, one of the main controversies around the last legislative effort from Senator Scott Wiener, who represents San Francisco, who authored this bill, a lot of people said it could harm the startup ecosystem, which a lot of people take issue with because that’s such a booming part of California’s economy right now.</p>\n<p>This bill specifically applies to AI developers that are [generating] more than $500 million [from] their AI models. This really tries to target OpenAI, Google DeepMind, these big companies and not your run-of-the-mill startup.</p>\n<p><strong>Anthony:</strong> As I understand it, if you’re a smaller startup, you do have to share some safety information, but not nearly as much.</p>\n<p>It’s [also] worth talking about the broader landscape around AI regulation and the fact that one of the big changes between last year and this year is now we have a new president. The federal administration has taken much more of a stance of no regulation and companies should be able to do what they want, to the extent that they’ve actually included [language] in funding bills saying <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/06/30/congress-might-block-state-ai-laws-for-five-years-heres-what-it-means/\">states cannot have their own AI regulation</a>.</p>\n<p>I don’t think any of that has passed so far, but potentially they could try to get that through in the future. So this could be another front in which the Trump administration and blue states are fighting.</p>\n<figure><p>\n<iframe width=\"500\" height=\"281\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/P-NmEOn7PjE?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\"></iframe>\n</p></figure>\n<p><em>Equity is TechCrunch’s flagship podcast, produced by Theresa Loconsolo, and posts every Wednesday and Friday.</em></p>\n<p><em>Subscribe to us on</em><a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/id1215439780\" target=\"_blank\"><em> Apple Podcasts</em></a><em>,</em><a href=\"https://overcast.fm/itunes1215439780/equity\" target=\"_blank\"><em> Overcast</em></a><em>,</em><a href=\"https://open.spotify.com/show/5IEYLip3eDppcOmy5DmphC?si=rZDFHv2sQUul_g94iCRgpQ\" target=\"_blank\"><em> Spotify</em></a><em>, and all the casts.

    "body": "<div>\n<p>Commonwealth Fusion Systems has agreed to sell Italian energy company Eni more than $1 billion worth of power from its first fusion reactor.</p>\n<p>The power plant <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/12/17/commonwealth-fusion-systems-just-picked-its-first-commercial-site-partly-because-of-its-proximity-to-washington-d-c/\">will be built outside of Richmond, Virginia</a>, close to some of the highest densities of data centers in the country. The 400-megawatt fusion reactor, called Arc, is expected to open in the early 2030s, CEO Bob Mumgaard said. </p>\n<p>The Eni agreement is the second such deal for Commonwealth Fusion Systems (CFS). In June, Google said that it would <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/06/30/google-inks-its-first-fusion-power-deal-with-commonwealth-fusion-systems/\">buy half the reactor’s output</a>. When asked, neither CFS nor Eni would say how much power the deal covers nor its timeline.</p>\n<p>Mumgaard told reporters last week that CFS’s first power plant, the demonstration-scale Sparc reactor in Devens, Massachusetts, is 65% complete. The company has previously said it plans to turn on Sparc later in 2026, and Mumgaard confirmed that CFS is “on track to do that.”</p>\n<p>“One of the reasons we built Sparc is so that we could actually get the experience of what it’s like to build a nearly full-scale system,” he said. “Arc will be the first of many that’s backed by a supply chain that is primed for scale.”</p>\n<p>CFS is widely regarded as a leader in the fusion industry. It’s reactor design is based on the tokamak, a widely studied system in which D-shaped superconducting magnets confine and compress superheated plasma. In that plasma, particles collide, forming new atoms and releasing energy in the process. The company frequently updates scientists on its progress, and it has run extensive simulations to uncover any potential hurdles. </p>\n<p>CFS expects that Sparc will prove be able to generate more power than is required to sustain the fusion reactions. But at the same time, the company won’t know for sure if it all works until Sparc is complete. That’s likely to exhaust a significant fraction of the nearly $3 billion it has raised to date, including an<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/08/28/nvidia-google-and-bill-gates-help-commonwealth-fusion-systems-raise-863m/\"> $863 million Series B2 round</a> announced three weeks ago. That round included checks from a wide range of investors, including Nvidia, Google, Breakthrough Energy Ventures, and Eni.</p>\n<div>\n\t\t<p>Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t<p><span>San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>October 27-29, 2025</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n<p>Which raises the question, what happens to CFS’s deals with Google and Eni if there’s a delay, or worse, if the reactors don’t work as planned?</p>\n<p>The agreements are structured to “walk the line” between punitive and collaborative, Mumgaard said. The partners “understand these challenges that come from first of a kind,” he said. “No one in this situation is like, oh, you know, invent an entire new technology, an entire industry, and if it doesn’t work on this day, we’re just going to walk away.”</p>\n<p>Google has hinted that it will use Arc’s electricity to power its data centers, but Eni, which is one of the world’s largest oil and gas companies, doesn’t have operations in the U.S. that would demand that amount of energy.</p>\n<p>“The power will be sent to the grid at the end of the day,” said Lorenzo Fiorillo, Eni’s director of technology, R&D, and digital. </p>\n<p>In short, Eni will resell it.</p>\n<p>But any electricity generated by Arc, a first-of-its-kind reactor, is going to be expensive. Eni is more likely to lose money trading that power on the grid than it is to profit. </p>\n<p>Instead, this agreement is likely intended to help establish a price for fusion power and rustle up more money to build Arc.</p>\n<p>Mumgaard admitted as much. The power purchase agreement, he said, “gives us the certainty of where the power is going to go, what the price is going to be, etc. And that allows us to then take that package to more financial investors in project finance and other areas and start having conversations about what it’s going to be like to actually finance this plant.”</p>\n</div><div>\n<div>\n\t\t<p>Tim De Chant is a senior climate reporter at TechCrunch.
