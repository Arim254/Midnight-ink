Human hands are incredibly sophisticated, packed with about 17,000 specialized touch receptors that no robot comes close to matching. While machine learning transformed speech recognition and image processing, those breakthroughs built on decades of existing technology for capturing the right data. “We don’t have such a tradition for touch data,” Brooks points out.</p>\n<p>Then there’s safety. Full-sized walking humanoid robots pump massive amounts of energy into staying upright. When they fall, they’re dangerous. Physics means a robot twice the size of today’s models would pack eight times the harmful energy.</p>\n<p>Brooks predicts that in 15 years, successful “humanoid” robots will actually have wheels, multiple arms, and specialized sensors and abandon the human form. Meanwhile, he’s thoroughly convinced that today’s billions are funding expensive training experiments that will never scale to mass production.</p>\n</div>\n<div>\n\t<p>Topics</p>\n</div>\n</div><div><div>\n\t<div>\n\t\t<p>Subscribe for the industry’s biggest tech news</p>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n<p></p><h2 id=\"h-latest-in\">Latest in Hardware</h2><p></p>\n</div>"

    "body": "<div>\n<p>Fintech Checkout.com <a href=\"https://www.checkout.com/newsroom/checkout-com-accelerates-towards-full-year-profitability-and-announces-employee-share-buy-back-and-a-new-12bn-valuation\" target=\"_blank\">announced</a> on Friday that it reached a $12 billion valuation as part of an employee stock buyback program. </p>\n<p>On the one hand, very few startups ever achieve decacorn status, so $12 billion is nothing to sneeze at. It’s a valuable enough company to have landed its founder and CEO <a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/profile/guillaume-pousaz/\" target=\"_blank\">Guillaume Pousaz</a> on Forbes’ billionaire list.</p>\n<p>On the other, there was a short period of time when Checkout.com was valued at <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/12/checkout-com-raises-1b-round-at-4/\">a whopping $40 billion</a>, as part of its $1 billion Series D round closed in 2022. By the end of that year, with the venture world crashing into a bear market, it had already internally <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2022/12/13/why-checkoutcom-lowered-its-internal-valuation/\">slashed its valuation to $11 billion</a>. And then it lowered its valuation again, to $9.35 billion in 2023, a company spokesperson told TechCrunch. </p>\n<p>So $12 billion represents a nearly 30% increase from its previous valuation.</p>\n<p>But this valuation isn’t being obtained because an investor is plunking down cash. The company is the only one buying employee shares back, with no other investors involved in a tender offer, the spokesperson tells us. Instead, the valuation comes from a 409A valuation, the person said. That’s an assessment made by an independent third-party. It’s not the same as a vote of confidence from a professional investor, but it’s also not simply the company giving itself a bump.</p>\n<p>In fairness, Checkout.com’s archrival Stripe also had its own valuation setback during the same venture capital bear market, crashing from $95 billion at the height of the froth in 2021,<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2023/03/15/stripe-now-valued-at-50b-following-6-5b-raise/\"> to $50 billion during the doldrums in 2023.</a> Stripe has since clawed its way back<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/02/27/stripe-finalizes-tender-sale-at-a-91-5b-valuation-says-payment-volumes-grew-to-1-4t-in-2024/\"> to $91.5 billion as of February</a> through its own series of employee tender offers. Stripe, however, did have outside investors helping to value it. And, Stripe is rumored to be working on yet another tender offer at a $106.7 billion valuation, Axios just <a href=\"https://www.axios.com/2025/09/23/stripe-buy-back-stock-vc\" target=\"_blank\">reported.</a>  </p>\n<p>Yet just because Checkout.com is competing against one of the most highly valued startups of all time, doesn’t minimize its own business achievements. </p>\n<p>The London-based payments company, which is a popular choice among large e-commerce sites like eBay and Pinterest, said it was starting to be profitable by the end of 2024 and is on track for a full year of profitability in 2025. Checkout.com says it processes about $1 billion worth of e-commerce payments a day and hired 300 more employees this year, bringing headcount to 2,000 people across 19 global offices. </p>\n<p>Checkout.com also tells TechCrunch that employees with tenure of at least a year will be eligible for the buyback program, but declined to indicate the size of the buyback, either in total spend or number of shares.</p>\n<p><em>Note: This story was updated with more information about the previous valuation.</em></p>\n</div>"

And it was later revealed that <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/09/24/oracle-is-reportedly-looking-to-raise-15b-in-corporate-bond-sale/\">Oracle sold $18 billion in bonds</a> to pay for these data centers.</p>\n<p>On their own, each deal is dizzying in scale.

The experience feels similar to a news app or a social feed — something you check first thing in the morning — but doesn’t have posts from other users or ads (yet).</p>\n<p>Pulse is part of a new class of OpenAI products that work independently, even when users aren’t in the ChatGPT app. The company would like to deliver a lot more of these features and roll them out to free users, but they’re limited by the number of computer servers available to them. OpenAI said it can only offer Pulse to its $200-a-month Pro subscribers right now due to capacity constraints.</p>\n<div>\n\t\t<p>Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t<p><span>San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>October 27-29, 2025</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n<p>The real question is whether features like Pulse are worth the hundreds of billions of dollars being invested in AI data centers to support OpenAI.

Flipkart is working toward completing the transition within the next couple of months, aligning with India’s festive season — a critical sales period — and laying the groundwork for a public listing expected as early as 2026.</p>\n<p>Relocating their base back home helps companies align with evolving local regulations and meet requirements for domestic stock listings. It also makes sense to tap India’s public markets, given the expanding retail investor base and rising appetite for IPOs. The trend reflects the growing maturity and attractiveness of India’s capital markets compared to overseas alternatives.</p>\n<p>Flipkart initiated the process in India and Singapore simultaneously over two and a half months ago, following the board’s <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/04/21/flipkart-to-relocate-hq-to-india-ahead-of-ipo/\" target=\"_blank\">approval for the relocation of its headquarters</a> in April, the people said.</p>\n<p>In 2022, Walmart-backed PhonePe, which had split from Flipkart in late 2022, <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2022/12/22/flipkart-and-phonepe-complete-separation/\" target=\"_blank\">relocated its headquarters</a> from Singapore to India. The fintech firm filed confidential IPO papers with India’s market regulator, the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI), earlier this week. Recent reports suggest that PhonePe is <a href=\"https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/walmart-owned-phonepe-files-for-mega-ipo-of-around-rs-12-000-crore-via-confidential-route-13572747.html\" target=\"_blank\">aiming to raise ₹120 billion</a> (approximately $1.35 billion) through the offering.</p>\n<p>Startups including Zepto and Groww have also relocated their headquarters to India in recent months as they prepare to go public on Indian stock exchanges. Notably, Groww is set to <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/09/16/groww-backed-by-satya-nadella-set-to-become-first-indian-startup-to-go-public-after-u-s-to-india-move/\" target=\"_blank\">become the first Indian startup</a> to list domestically after redomiciling from the U.S., with its IPO expected later this year.</p>\n<p>Flipkart’s shift from its Singapore headquarters comes over a year after it <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/05/24/google-invests-350-million-in-indias-flipkart/\" target=\"_blank\">raised $350 million from Google</a> as part of a nearly $1 billion funding round that began in 2023.

    "body": "<div>\n<p>When Sierra Space won a contract to deliver cargo to the International Space Station nearly a decade ago, the company promised a first for the commercial space market: a privately built, rapid reuse and cargo return spaceplane capable of landing on commercial runways.</p>\n<p>That dream has changed. In a modification to the contract announced earlier this week, NASA and Sierra Space agreed to remove the agency’s guarantee to purchase cargo flights to the ISS. Instead, the Dream Chaser spaceplane will debut in a free-flying demonstration in late 2026, and will not dock with the station.</p>\n<p>NASA said it will provide “minimal support” for that test, and only afterward decide whether to order ISS resupply missions at all.</p>\n<p>The contract change is a blow to the Dream Chaser program. Typically, such programs rely heavily, if not entirely, on government support, as the upfront development costs for a crewed or cargo spacecraft are so high that commercial customers are rarely able to provide enough demand to close the business case.</p>\n<p>SpaceX, for example, received billions from NASA through the Commercial Orbital Transportation Services and Commercial Crew programs to develop its Dragon capsule and Falcon 9 rocket.</p>\n<p>So this change also means that Dream Chaser will need to undergo a major rebranding. The mission was always to resupply the ISS under NASA’s Commercial Resupply Services program, alongside SpaceX’s Dragon and Northrop Grumman’s Cygnus. Those contracts have a combined ceiling of $14 billion across the three providers; NASA has obligated roughly $1.43 billion to Sierra Space so far, but now that may be as far as the commitment goes.</p>\n<p>With that guaranteed income gone, Sierra Space now faces the challenge of repositioning itself as a dual-use platform useful to commercial space stations or defense customers.</p>\n<div>\n\t\t<p>Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t<p><span>San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>October 27-29, 2025</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n<p>Company executives are pushing hard on the defense angle, according to a press release issued on Thursday. Its executive chair Fatih Ozmen said the transition will allow Sierra to provide “unique capabilities to meet the needs of diverse mission profiles, including emerging and existential threats and national security priorities that align with our acceleration into the Defense Tech market.”</p>\n<p>Mid-program pivots are relatively rare in aerospace, but they’ve become more common as space startups contend with shifting government priorities and the need to prove out commercial markets before they exist. Historically, aerospace systems were designed around highly specific mission profiles, but Sierra is arguing that Dream Chaser’s reusability and runway capability make it flexible.</p>\n<p>The free-flying demo could help Sierra showcase Dream Chaser’s flexibility — it could host different payloads and demonstrate other capabilities, without having to dock with the ISS.</p>\n<p>Time is running out. The ISS is slated for deorbit around 2030, which leaves Dream Chaser just a few short years to demonstrate cargo delivery in orbit. But if Dream Chaser can prove itself, it can credibly go on to serve multiple customers and carve out a valuable niche as the only winged spacecraft on the market.</p>\n</div><div>\n<div>\n\t\t<p>Aria Alamalhodaei covers the space and defense industries at TechCrunch.

    "description": "Anode Technology Company wants to build mobile battery generators for construction sites, live events, and EV fleets. But first it has to avoid the pitfalls that claimed its predecessor, Moxion.",
    "body": "<div>\n<p>Just over a year ago, Moxion Power closed its doors, adding its name to a list of high-profile bankruptcies that roiled the climate tech world in 2024. The portable battery startup had raised <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2022/09/28/moxion-nails-100m-series-b-to-replace-noxious-diesel-generators-with-silent-batteries/\">more than $110 million</a> in a bid to replace diesel generators at festivals and construction sites, but even that wasn’t enough to get it through the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/04/27/climate-startup-valley-of-death/\">valley of death</a>. Moxion laid off more than 400 employees and its <a href=\"https://www.latitudemedia.com/news/portable-battery-startup-moxion-is-bankrupt-what-happened/\" target=\"_blank\">assets were liquidated</a>.</p>\n<p>Now, the startup’s co-founder, Paul Huelskamp, and several former Moxion employees are back with another startup, <a href=\"https://anode.tech/\" target=\"_blank\">Anode Technology Company</a>, hoping to accomplish the same goal — ideally without repeating the same mistakes.</p>\n<p>“We started Anode with that goal to kind of finish what we started,” Huelskamp, now Anode’s CEO, told TechCrunch.</p>\n<p>Anode has been operating quietly, but it is now emerging with $9 million in seed funding. The round was led by Eclipse, and its partner Jiten Behl, who spearheaded the deal, was previously Rivian’s chief growth officer.</p>\n<p>Behl’s interest in the space was sparked by his experience at Rivian, which once had an agreement to sell 100,000 electric delivery vans to Amazon. But the companies soon realized that the problem wasn’t the cost of the vans, but the charging infrastructure.</p>\n<p>“You need a mini power plant to charge 150 vans, and that infrastructure does not exist at depots,” Behl said.</p>\n<p>In a pinch, many fleets will turn to diesel generators. Waymo, for example, was found to be using them at its depot <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgKTVtj1xQU\" target=\"_blank\">in San Francisco</a>. “What businesses are actually looking for is some grid-independent solutions that can provide them flexibility,” Behl added.</p>\n<div>\n\t\t<p>Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t<p><span>San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>October 27-29, 2025</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n<p>Other companies, like SparkCharge and Power Sonic, provide EV charging using mobile batteries, but Huelskamp claims Anode’s integrated hardware should set it apart. The company has designed an inverter that’ll work for the markets it is targeting, including EV charging, construction sites, and live events. </p>\n<p>Anode’s mobile battery is also slightly smaller than Moxion’s 600 kilowatt-hour unit, he said, which makes it easier to load onto flatbed trucks.</p>\n<p>“We are optimizing for the lowest cost of delivered energy. The things that drive cost are, how much energy can you put on the back of a truck? How many trucks do you need? How many drivers do you need? How many trips do you have to take?” Huelskamp said. “A smaller footprint, less energy, might mean more energy on the back of a single flatbed truck. It’s a little counterintuitive.”</p>\n<p>“There’s a lot of those types of requirements that, frankly, we just didn’t appreciate at Moxion.”</p>\n<p>The new startup will use contract manufacturers to make its batteries, a key difference from Moxion, which tried to do it all in-house. “One of the main lessons learned is it’s really tough as a startup to take on that part of [the manufacturing],” Huelskamp said.</p>\n<p>For Behl, those lessons served a part in drawing him to the investment. “I’m getting the benefit, as an investor, to have those learnings already secured without having to pay for that,” he said.</p>\n<p>While EV charging depots might be an emerging market, construction and live events are more established industries. Currently, many rent fossil fuel-powered generators, which are costly and not as efficient as a large power plant. That inefficiency, Huelskamp thinks, gives Anode an opening. “We’re charging our batteries at three, four, five cents per kilowatt hour, and the industry is used to paying several dollars per kilowatt hour,” he said.</p>\n<p>Huelskamp said Anode will use AI to optimize its operations, including charging and delivery. Eventually, that should drive down the cost close to parity with electricity from the grid, though not quite as low as off-peak pricing, he said.</p>\n<p>“Over time, as we scale up our operations, create all these efficiencies, drive down the cost of delivered energy, and leverage the continued declines in battery costs, I think it approaches the cost of the power that we get from the grid,” Huelskamp said.</p>\n</div><div>\n<div>\n\t\t<p>Tim De Chant is a senior climate reporter at TechCrunch.

Instead, the story centers around <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/05/facebook-whistleblower-frances-haugen-testifies-before-the-senate/\">Frances Haugen</a> (played by Mikey Madison), the former Facebook employee who leaked a massive trove of <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/tech/personal-tech/facebook-knows-instagram-is-toxic-for-teen-girls-company-documents-show-11631620739?mod=hp_lead_pos7\" target=\"_blank\">internal documents</a> to a Wall Street Journal reporter (played by Jeremy Allen White) and accused the company of prioritizing “profits over people” in 2021.</p>\n<p>Among the most damning revelations from Haugen’s leak was internal research showing that the company was well aware that Instagram was harming the mental health of teenage girls. Haugen said in congressional testimony that Facebook was “<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2021/oct/07/facebooks-role-in-myanmar-and-ethiopia-under-new-scrutiny\" target=\"_blank\">literally fanning ethnic violence</a>” in Ethiopia, since content moderation efforts in non-English languages were under-resourced.

With its $799 price tag, the Apple Watch Ultra 3 is clearly aimed at a niche, high-end market and athletes. For most consumers, the purchasing decision likely lies between the Apple Watch SE 3 and the Apple Watch Series 11, starting at $249 and $399, respectively.</p>\n<p>Despite its lower price tag, the Apple Watch SE 3 comes with much of the same software as the Series 11. If you’re looking for a straightforward smartwatch with essential features like step counting and sleep tracking, the SE 3 is an excellent and affordable choice. </p>\n<p>While the Series 11 and Ultra 3 offer modest improvements over their predecessors, the SE 3 has received a significant upgrade from the SE 2. The smartwatch jumps from the S8 chip to the S10 and now features an always-on display, supports fast charging, offers better crack resistance, introduces new health features, includes a wrist-temperature sensor for advanced sleep tracking and retrospective ovulation insights, and more. </p>\n<figure><img src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/apple-watch-se3-colors.png?w=680\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/apple-watch-se3-colors.png 3280w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/apple-watch-se3-colors.png?resize=150,67 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/apple-watch-se3-colors.png?resize=300,135 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/apple-watch-se3-colors.png?resize=768,345 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/apple-watch-se3-colors.png?resize=680,305 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/apple-watch-se3-colors.png?resize=1200,539 1200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/apple-watch-se3-colors.png?resize=1280,574 1280w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/apple-watch-se3-colors.png?resize=430,193 430w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/apple-watch-se3-colors.png?resize=720,323 720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/apple-watch-se3-colors.png?resize=900,404 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/apple-watch-se3-colors.png?resize=800,359 800w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/apple-watch-se3-colors.png?resize=1536,689 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/apple-watch-se3-colors.png?resize=2048,919 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/apple-watch-se3-colors.png?resize=668,300 668w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/apple-watch-se3-colors.png?resize=1375,617 1375w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/apple-watch-se3-colors.png?resize=708,318 708w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/apple-watch-se3-colors.png?resize=50,22 50w\" /><figcaption><span><strong>Image Credits:</strong>Apple</span></figcaption></figure>\n<p>Although it’s not as flashy as the Series 11 and Ultra 3, it definitely stands out and packs great value, especially for first-time buyers.

    "body": "<div>\n<p>For years, “know your customer” checks have become commonplace on the internet, often by way of sharing a copy of your government-issued ID and a selfie to confirm that it’s really you, to access a website or app, or to purchase certain goods.  </p>\n<p>Nowadays, age-verification laws <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/09/06/the-growing-debate-over-expanding-age-verification-laws/\">taking effect across the U.S., the United Kingdom, Australia, and beyond</a> are also giving rise to an entire industry of ID-checking companies charged with granting you access to the “adult” web. </p>\n<p>But uploading your identity details and selfie to a company’s servers has long had privacy advocates spooked and fearful that this sensitive information could be monetized, lost, or stolen in a data breach. </p>\n<p>A new startup called <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/startup-battlefield/company/trusources/\" target=\"_blank\">TruSources</a> aims to solve some of these privacy and security challenges by performing age-verification and identity checks on a person’s device, without the person’s sensitive information ever leaving their phone. The company is part of <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/startup-battlefield/\">Startup Battlefield</a> and plans <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-disrupt-2025/?promo=postinclusion_sb200startup&utm_campaign=disrupt2025&utm_content=ticketsales&utm_medium=post&utm_source=tc\" target=\"_blank\">to show off its new technology at TechCrunch Disrupt 2025</a>, which <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-disrupt-2025/tickets/?promo=postinclusion_sb200startup&utm_campaign=disrupt2025&utm_content=ticketsales&utm_medium=post&utm_source=tc\" target=\"_blank\">runs October 27 through 29</a> at Moscone West in San Francisco.  </p>\n<p>TruSources’ founder and chief technology officer, Sanjay Krishnamurthy, who worked on the core encryption engine at WhatsApp, tells TechCrunch that he worked on his technology initially to help prevent scams, many of which rely on duping unsuspecting victims into handing over their sensitive information that the scammers use to cash in.  </p>\n<p>His company developed a deepfake-detection app and a “know your customer” (KYC) app, which can be used to verify a user’s liveness on-device in a few seconds. </p>\n<p>Krishnamurthy says that when a user verifies their identity with TruSources, none of their information is uploaded to its servers like most age- and identity-checking companies do. Instead, TruSources’ technology relies on a custom machine learning model baked into its apps that detects patterns from an existing dataset that the company developed to spot deepfakes and false identity cards. </p>\n<div>\n\t\t<p>Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t<p><span>San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>October 27-29, 2025</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n<p>TruSources’ technology can be integrated with other apps and websites that have to comply with age-verification laws. The technology can also be integrated into corporate single-sign-on services, which allow employees to access multiple work apps with just one set of credentials. </p>\n<p>The apps can also produce a QR code for use in the real world, such as when proving a person’s age to enter a bar without having to give over a physical copy of their identity documents.  </p>\n<p>Krishnamurthy said his technology will help companies that are subject to age-verification and identity checks to be compliant with KYC rules, while both protecting those companies from having to collect people’s government-issued identity documents and preserving users’ privacy. </p>\n<p>“A handful of countries have mandated that all apps need to know your age, and they’ve made a huge problem because they don’t want to take the IDs from all over the world and there’s all kinds of legal implications,” Krishnamurthy tells TechCrunch. </p>\n<p>TruSources is still in its early days but stands out as one of the few startups tackling identity checks and age verification but without compromising a person’s privacy or security. </p>\n<p><em>If you want to learn more about TruSources — and dozens of other startups, hearing their pitches, and listening to guest speakers on four different stages — join us at Disrupt, taking place October 27 to 29, in San Francisco. </em></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-disrupt-2025/tickets/?promo=postinclusion_sb200startup&utm_campaign=disrupt2025&utm_content=ticketsales&utm_medium=post&utm_source=tc\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Learn more about tickets and pricing here.</em></a> </p>\n<figure><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-disrupt-2025/tickets/?promo=postinclusion_sb200startup&utm_campaign=disrupt2025&utm_content=ticketsales&utm_medium=post&utm_source=tc\"><img src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/TC25_Disrupt_General_Article_No-Anniversary_Headers_1920x1080.png?w=680\" alt=\"TechCrunch Disrupt 2025\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/TC25_Disrupt_General_Article_No-Anniversary_Headers_1920x1080.png 1920w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/TC25_Disrupt_General_Article_No-Anniversary_Headers_1920x1080.png?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/TC25_Disrupt_General_Article_No-Anniversary_Headers_1920x1080.png?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/TC25_Disrupt_General_Article_No-Anniversary_Headers_1920x1080.png?resize=768,432 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/TC25_Disrupt_General_Article_No-Anniversary_Headers_1920x1080.png?resize=680,383 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/TC25_Disrupt_General_Article_No-Anniversary_Headers_1920x1080.png?resize=1200,675 1200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/TC25_Disrupt_General_Article_No-Anniversary_Headers_1920x1080.png?resize=1280,720 1280w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/TC25_Disrupt_General_Article_No-Anniversary_Headers_1920x1080.png?resize=430,242 430w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/TC25_Disrupt_General_Article_No-Anniversary_Headers_1920x1080.png?resize=720,405 720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/TC25_Disrupt_General_Article_No-Anniversary_Headers_1920x1080.png?resize=900,506 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/TC25_Disrupt_General_Article_No-Anniversary_Headers_1920x1080.png?resize=800,450 800w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/TC25_Disrupt_General_Article_No-Anniversary_Headers_1920x1080.png?resize=1536,864 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/TC25_Disrupt_General_Article_No-Anniversary_Headers_1920x1080.png?resize=668,375 668w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/TC25_Disrupt_General_Article_No-Anniversary_Headers_1920x1080.png?resize=1097,617 1097w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/TC25_Disrupt_General_Article_No-Anniversary_Headers_1920x1080.png?resize=708,398 708w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/TC25_Disrupt_General_Article_No-Anniversary_Headers_1920x1080.png?resize=50,28 50w\" /></a></figure>\n</div><div>\n<div>\n\t\t<p>Zack Whittaker is the security editor at TechCrunch.

    "body": "<div>\n<p>A data spill from an unsecured cloud server has exposed hundreds of thousands of sensitive bank transfer documents in India, revealing account numbers, transaction figures, and individuals’ contact details.</p>\n<p>Researchers at cybersecurity firm UpGuard discovered in late August a publicly accessible Amazon-hosted storage server containing 273,000 PDF documents relating to bank transfers of Indian customers. </p>\n<p>The exposed files contained completed transaction forms intended for processing via the National Automated Clearing House, or NACH, a <a href=\"https://www.npci.org.in/what-we-do/nach/product-overview\" target=\"_blank\">centralized system</a> used by banks in India to facilitate high-volume recurring transactions, such as salaries, loan repayments, and utility payments.</p>\n<p>The data was linked to at least 38 different banks and financial institutions, the researchers told TechCrunch.</p>\n<p>The spilling data was eventually plugged, but the researchers said they could not identify the source of the leak.</p>\n<p>Following the publication of this article, Indian fintech company Nupay reached out to TechCrunch by email to confirm that it “addressed a configuration gap in an Amazon S3 storage bucket” that contained the bank transfer forms.</p>\n<p>It’s not clear why the data was left publicly exposed and accessible to the internet, though security lapses of this nature are not uncommon due to human error.</p>\n<h2 id=\"h-data-secured-nupay-blames-configuration-gap\">Data secured, Nupay blames ‘configuration gap’</h2>\n<p>In <a href=\"https://www.upguard.com/breaches/india-bank-transfers-data-leak\" target=\"_blank\">its blog post</a> detailing its findings, the UpGuard researchers said that out of a sample of 55,000 documents that they looked at, more than half of the files mentioned the name of Indian lender <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2023/12/12/british-international-investment-aye-finance-funding/\">Aye Finance</a>, which had <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/12/17/aye-finance-ipo/\" target=\"_blank\">filed for a $171 million IPO</a> last year. The Indian state-owned State Bank of India was the next institution to appear by frequency in the sample documents, according to the researchers.</p>\n<p>After discovering the exposed data, UpGuard’s researchers notified Aye Finance through its corporate, customer care, and grievance redressal email addresses. The researchers also alerted the National Payments Corporation of India, or NPCI, the government body responsible for managing NACH.</p>\n<p>By early September, the researchers said the data was still exposed and that thousands of files were being added to the exposed server daily. </p>\n<p>UpGuard said it then alerted India’s computer emergency response team, CERT-In. The exposed data was secured shortly after, the researchers told TechCrunch.</p>\n<p>Despite this, it remained unclear who was responsible for the security lapse. Spokespeople for Aye Finance and NCPI denied that they were the source of the data spill, and a spokesperson for the State Bank of India acknowledged our outreach but did not provide comment.</p>\n<div><p>Following publication, Nupay confirmed that it was the cause of the data spill.</p><p>Nupay’s co-founder and chief operating officer, Neeraj Singh, told TechCrunch that a “limited set of test records with basic customer details” was stored in the Amazon S3 bucket and claimed “a majority were dummy or test files.”</p></div>\n<p>The company said its Amazon-hosted logs “confirmed that there has been no unauthorized access, data leakage, misuse, or financial impact.”</p>\n<p>UpGuard disputed Nupay’s claims, telling TechCrunch that only a few hundred of the thousands of files its researchers sampled appeared to contain test data or had Nupay’s name on the forms. UpGuard added that it was unclear how Nupay’s cloud logs can allegedly rule out any access to Nupay’s then-public Amazon S3 bucket, given that Nupay has not asked UpGuard for its IP addresses that were used to investigate the data exposure.</p>\n<p>UpGuard also noted that details of the Amazon bucket were not limited to its researchers, as the address of the public Amazon S3 bucket had been indexed by Grayhatwarfare, a searchable database that indexes publicly visible cloud storage.</p>\n<p>When asked by TechCrunch, Nupay’s Singh did not immediately say how long the Amazon S3 bucket was publicly accessible to the web.</p>\n<p><em>First published on September 25 and updated with new information from Nupay. </em></p>\n</div><div>\n<div>\n<div>\n\t\t<p>Jagmeet covers startups, tech policy-related updates, and all other major tech-centric developments from India for TechCrunch.
