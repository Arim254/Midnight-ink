The company’s request comes the same week that President Donald Trump — who Tesla CEO Elon Musk <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2025/02/01/politics/elon-musk-2024-election-spending-millions\" target=\"_blank\">spent $300 million</a> to help elect — told the United Nations General Assembly that he thinks climate change is a “con job” and a “scam.”</p>\n<p>Tesla also asked the EPA not to scuttle a 2009 legal standard known as the Endangerment Finding, which many modern environmental regulations (like the vehicle emissions standards) are based on. Tesla said that finding is “based on a robust factual and scientific record,” according to the company’s letter to the agency.</p>\n<p>The EPA has been seeking comment since August for these proposed attacks on environmental rules. The agency’s administrator, Lee Zeldin, said at the time that, if passed, the rollbacks would drive “a dagger into the heart of the climate change religion.”</p>\n<p>Tesla’s nominal mission is to “accelerate the world’s transition to sustainable energy.” But the company financially benefits from stricter environmental regulations. When other automakers fall short of fleet emissions goals, they pay companies like Tesla hundreds of millions of dollars to buy “credits” to make up the difference. (Those credits technically come from a California program that has <a href=\"https://calmatters.org/environment/2025/05/california-electric-car-mandate-senate-revoke-waiver/\" target=\"_blank\">also been a Republican target</a>.) While Tesla is asking for the standards to be maintained, the company told the EPA it is “open to discussing mechanisms to streamline” them in order to keep them around. </p>\n</div>\n<div>\n\t<p>Topics</p>\n</div>\n</div><div><div>\n\t<div>\n\t\t<p>Subscribe for the industry’s biggest tech news</p>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n<p></p><h2 id=\"h-latest-in\">Latest in Transportation</h2><p></p>\n</div>"

    "body": "<div>\n<p>Meta <a href=\"https://about.fb.com/news/2025/09/millions-teens-now-teen-accounts-plus-more-support-schools/\" target=\"_blank\">announced</a> on Thursday that its Teen Accounts are now being expanded to teens on Facebook and Messenger globally, after initially only being available to users in the U.S., U.K., Australia, and Canada. The accounts, which feature built-in protections and parental controls for younger users, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/09/17/instagram-tightens-restrictions-on-teen-accounts-putting-parents-in-control/\">first launched on Instagram </a>last fall.  </p>\n<p>Teen Accounts were originally launched shortly after Meta and other popular social networks were <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/01/30/childrens-safety-hearing-discord-meta-snap-x-tiktok-january-2024/\">grilled by U.S. lawmakers</a> for not doing enough to protect teens on their services.</p>\n<p>With the global expansion on Facebook and Messenger, teens will now automatically be placed into an experience that is designed to limit inappropriate content and unwanted contact. Teens under the age of 16 need their parents’ permission to change any of the settings.</p>\n<p>Additionally, teens will only receive messages from people they follow or have messaged before. Only teens’ friends can see and reply to their stories. Plus, tags, Mentions, and comments will also be limited to people they follow or who are their friends.</p>\n<p>Teens will also receive reminders to leave the social networks after using them for an hour a day, and they’ll be enrolled in “Quiet mode” overnight.</p>\n<p>The expansion of Teen Accounts comes as research led by a Meta whistleblower recently found that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2025/sep/25/instagram-risk-children-safety-tools-meta\" target=\"_blank\">children and teens are still at risk from online harm</a> on Instagram, even after the company has rolled out protections. The study found that despite being placed into Teen Accounts, young users can still come across suicide and self-harm posts, along with posts describing demeaning sexual acts. Meta has <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/ce32w7we01eo\" target=\"_blank\">disputed the claims</a> and said its protections have led to teens seeing less harmful content.</p>\n<figure><img src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Screenshot-2025-09-25-at-10.03.53AM.png?w=680\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Screenshot-2025-09-25-at-10.03.53AM.png 1424w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Screenshot-2025-09-25-at-10.03.53AM.png?resize=150,130 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Screenshot-2025-09-25-at-10.03.53AM.png?resize=300,260 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Screenshot-2025-09-25-at-10.03.53AM.png?resize=768,667 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Screenshot-2025-09-25-at-10.03.53AM.png?resize=680,590 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Screenshot-2025-09-25-at-10.03.53AM.png?resize=1200,1042 1200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Screenshot-2025-09-25-at-10.03.53AM.png?resize=1280,1111 1280w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Screenshot-2025-09-25-at-10.03.53AM.png?resize=430,373 430w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Screenshot-2025-09-25-at-10.03.53AM.png?resize=720,625 720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Screenshot-2025-09-25-at-10.03.53AM.png?resize=900,781 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Screenshot-2025-09-25-at-10.03.53AM.png?resize=800,694 800w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Screenshot-2025-09-25-at-10.03.53AM.png?resize=668,580 668w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Screenshot-2025-09-25-at-10.03.53AM.png?resize=432,375 432w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Screenshot-2025-09-25-at-10.03.53AM.png?resize=711,617 711w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Screenshot-2025-09-25-at-10.03.53AM.png?resize=612,531 612w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Screenshot-2025-09-25-at-10.03.53AM.png?resize=50,43 50w\" /><figcaption><span><strong>Image Credits:</strong>Meta</span></figcaption></figure>\n<p>Meta also announced on Thursday that it’s officially launching the School Partnership Program, which allows educators to report safety concerns, like bullying, directly to Instagram for quicker review and removal.</p>\n<p>The company says it piloted the program earlier this year and heard positive feedback from participating schools.

Designed to be adaptable to a variety of models and cloud hosts, the system employs a range of optimizations to get more inference power out of the same hardware.</p>\n<p>“It’s a variety of different types of optimizations, all the way down to CUDA kernels to advanced speculative decoding techniques,” said CEO Matthew Zeiler. “You can get more out of the same cards, basically.”</p>\n<p>The results were verified by a <a href=\"https://www.clarifai.com/press-release-artificial-analysis-ranks-clarifais-gpt-oss-120b-model-at-top-for-performance-and-cost-efficiency\" target=\"_blank\">string</a> of <a href=\"https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/artificial-analysis-ranks-clarifais-gpt-oss-120b-model-at-top-for-performance-and-cost-efficiency-302553950.html\" target=\"_blank\">benchmark tests</a> by the third-party firm Artificial Analysis, which recorded industry-best records for both throughput and latency.</p>\n<p>The process focuses specifically on inference, the computing demands of operating an AI model that has already been trained. That computing load has grown particularly intense with the rise of agentic and reasoning models, which require multiple steps in response to a single command.</p>\n<p>First launched as a computer vision service, Clarifai has grown increasingly focused on compute orchestration as the AI boom has drastically increased demand for both GPUs and the data centers that house them. The company first announced <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/12/03/clarifai-introduces-vendor-agnostic-orchestration-capabilities/\">its compute platform at AWS re:Invent in December</a>, but the new reasoning engine is the first product specifically tailored for multi-step agentic models.</p>\n<p>The product comes amid intense pressure on AI infrastructure, which has spurred <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/09/22/the-billion-dollar-infrastructure-deals-powering-the-ai-boom/\">a string of billion-dollar deals</a>. OpenAI has laid out plans for as much as <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/tech/openai-unveils-plans-for-seemingly-limitless-expansion-of-computing-power-d0b39b9b\" target=\"_blank\">$1 trillion in new data center spending</a>, projecting nearly limitless future demand for compute. But while the hardware buildout has been intense, Clarifai’s CEO believes there is more to be done in optimizing the infrastructure we already have.</p>\n<p>“There’s software tricks that take a good model like this further, like the Clarifai reasoning engine,” Zeiler says, “but there’s also algorithm improvements that can help combat the need for gigawatt data centers.

    "body": "<div>\n<p>Databricks said on Thursday that it is incorporating OpenAI’s models, including GPT-5, into its data platform as well as its AI product, Agent Bricks, as part of a $100 million multi-year deal that bets on the AI company’s ability to bring in enterprise customers.</p>\n<p>The deal highlights the accelerating race to bring generative AI into the enterprise stack, as companies foresee demand for AI tools that can tap into corporate data securely.</p>\n<p>Agent Bricks lets organizations build AI apps and agents on top of their enterprise data using a range of AI models. OpenAI’s latest models are now part of that menu — accessible in SQL or via API — and GPT-5 is being offered as a flagship model for Databricks customers.  </p>\n<p>The news comes nearly two months after Databricks added OpenAI’s <a href=\"https://www.databricks.com/blog/introducing-openais-new-open-models-databricks\" target=\"_blank\">open-weight models</a>, gpt-oss 20B and gpt-oss 120B, to the platform. Agent Bricks can now measure how accurately the different models perform on specific tasks and fine-tunes accordingly to produce more tailored results.</p>\n<p>“Our partnership with Databricks brings our most advanced models to where secure enterprise data already lives, making it easier for businesses to experiment, deploy, and scale AI agents with real impact,” Brad Lightcap, chief operating officer of OpenAI, said in a statement.  </p>\n<p>With this deal, Databricks is betting that enterprise customers will flock to OpenAI’s models. Under the terms, the company is on the hook to pay<em> </em>a minimum of $100 million to OpenAI whether or not the AI firm’s models generate that much in revenue over the life of the deal. </p>\n<p>Neither company disclosed how long the agreement will run. If revenue ends up exceeding $100 million, OpenAI will earn more, but if it falls short, Databricks will have to pay the full amount anyway. For Databricks, it means potential downside risk; for OpenAI, it means predictable income at a time when the company is trying to rapidly <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/09/23/openai-is-building-five-new-stargate-data-centers-with-oracle-and-softbank/\" target=\"_blank\">build out more data centers.</a>  </p>\n<div>\n\t\t<p>Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t<p><span>San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>October 27-29, 2025</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n<p>The deal is similar to the one <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/anthropic-databricks-team-up-in-scramble-for-ai-revenue-e15fe750\" target=\"_blank\">Databricks reached with Anthropic</a> earlier this year, setting a revenue target of $100 million over five years.</p>\n<p>A Databricks spokesperson told TechCrunch that the firm has already seen overwhelming demand from customers, including Mastercard, for native access to OpenAI’s models on the platform.</p>\n</div><div>\n<div>\n\t\t<p>Rebecca Bellan is a senior reporter at TechCrunch where she covers the business, policy, and emerging trends shaping artificial intelligence.

This affects subscriptions to Azure cloud storage and certain AI services.  </p>\n<p>“We do not provide technology to facilitate mass surveillance of civilians,” Microsoft vice chair and president Brad Smith wrote in a <a href=\"https://blogs.microsoft.com/on-the-issues/2025/09/25/update-on-ongoing-microsoft-review/\" target=\"_blank\">blog post</a>. “We have applied this principle in every country around the world, and we have insisted on it repeatedly for more than two decades.

Smith wrote that without it, they wouldn’t have known to look into the matter, as due to customer privacy rights, they can’t access a customer’s content. </p>\n<p>“As employees, we all have a shared interest in privacy protection, given the business value it creates by ensuring our customers can rely on our services with rock solid trust,” Smith wrote.  </p>\n<div>\n\t\t<p>Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t<p><span>San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>October 27-29, 2025</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n<p>The company said the review is ongoing but declined to comment to TechCrunch regarding what was still under review.  </p>\n<p>Microsoft has been under fire from both employees and outsiders for its involvement with Israel over the past year. <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/04/04/protester-interrupts-microsoft-copilot-keynote-says-company-has-blood-on-its-hands/\" target=\"_blank\">Protests regarding Microsoft’s relationship with Israel</a> broke out at the company’s 50th anniversary celebration in April. In August, several employees <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/08/26/microsoft-headquarters-go-into-lockdown-after-activists-take-over-brad-smiths-office/\" target=\"_blank\">staged a sit-in</a> at Smith’s office, forcing a lockdown.  </p>\n<p>The company has fired <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/sustainability/society-equity/microsoft-fires-four-workers-on-site-protests-over-companys-ties-israel-2025-08-29/\" target=\"_blank\">multiple employees</a> in recent months for their activism related to Microsoft’s contracts with Israel.   </p>\n</div><div>\n<div>\n\t\t<p>Becca is a senior writer at TechCrunch that covers venture capital trends and startups.

    "body": "<div>\n<p>OpenAI is launching a new feature inside of ChatGPT called Pulse, which generates personalized reports for users while they sleep. Pulse offers users five to 10 briefs that can get them up to speed on their day and is aimed at encouraging users to check ChatGPT first thing in the morning — much like they would check social media or a news app.</p>\n<p>Pulse is part of a broader shift in OpenAI’s consumer products, which are lately being designed to work for users asynchronously instead of responding to questions. Features like ChatGPT Agent or <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/05/16/openai-launches-codex-an-ai-coding-agent-in-chatgpt/\">Codex</a> aim to make ChatGPT feel more like an assistant rather than a chatbot. With Pulse, OpenAI seemingly wants ChatGPT to be more proactive.</p>\n<p>“We’re building AI that lets us take the level of support that only the wealthiest have been able to afford and make it available to everyone over time,” said OpenAI’s new CEO of Applications, Fidji Simo, in a blog post. “And ChatGPT Pulse is the first step in that direction — starting with Pro users today, but with the goal of rolling out this intelligence to all.”</p>\n<p>OpenAI CEO Sam Altman <a href=\"https://x.com/sama/status/1969835407421374910\" target=\"_blank\">said</a> earlier this week that some of ChatGPT’s new “compute-intensive” products would be limited to the company’s most expensive subscription plan — which is the case for Pulse. OpenAI has previously said it’s <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/02/27/openai-ceo-sam-altman-says-the-company-is-out-of-gpus/\">severely limited</a> in the number of servers it has to power ChatGPT, and it’s rapidly building out <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/09/23/openai-is-building-five-new-stargate-data-centers-with-oracle-and-softbank/\">AI data centers</a> with partners like Oracle and SoftBank to increase its capacity.</p>\n<p>Starting Thursday, OpenAI will roll out Pulse for subscribers to its $200-a-month Pro plan, for whom it will appear as a new tab in the ChatGPT app. The company says it would like to launch Pulse to all ChatGPT users in the future, with Plus subscribers to get access soon, but it first needs to make the product more efficient.</p>\n<p>Pulse’s reports can be roundups of news articles on a specific topic — like updates on a specific sports team — as well as more personalized briefs based on a user’s context.</p>\n<p>In a demo for TechCrunch, OpenAI product lead Adam Fry showed several reports Pulse had made for him: a roundup of news about British soccer team Arsenal; group Halloween costume suggestions for his wife and kids; and a toddler-friendly travel itinerary for his family’s upcoming trip to Sedona, Arizona.</p>\n<div>\n\t\t<p>Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t<p><span>San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>October 27-29, 2025</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n<figure><img src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/ChatGPT-Pulse-examples.png?w=680\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/ChatGPT-Pulse-examples.png 1452w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/ChatGPT-Pulse-examples.png?resize=150,44 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/ChatGPT-Pulse-examples.png?resize=300,88 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/ChatGPT-Pulse-examples.png?resize=768,225 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/ChatGPT-Pulse-examples.png?resize=680,200 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/ChatGPT-Pulse-examples.png?resize=1200,352 1200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/ChatGPT-Pulse-examples.png?resize=1280,376 1280w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/ChatGPT-Pulse-examples.png?resize=430,126 430w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/ChatGPT-Pulse-examples.png?resize=720,211 720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/ChatGPT-Pulse-examples.png?resize=900,264 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/ChatGPT-Pulse-examples.png?resize=800,235 800w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/ChatGPT-Pulse-examples.png?resize=668,196 668w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/ChatGPT-Pulse-examples.png?resize=1440,422 1440w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/ChatGPT-Pulse-examples.png?resize=708,208 708w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/ChatGPT-Pulse-examples.png?resize=50,15 50w\" /><figcaption><span>An example of Pulse’s cards and reports.</span><span><strong>Image Credits:</strong>OpenAI</span></figcaption></figure>\n<p>Each report is displayed as a “card” featuring AI-generated images and text. Users can click on each one to get the full report and can then query ChatGPT about the contents. Pulse will proactively generate some reports, but users can also ask Pulse for new automated reports or offer feedback on existing ones.</p>\n<p>A core part of Pulse is that it stops after generating a few reports and shows a message: “Great, that’s it for today.” According to Fry, that’s an intentional design choice to make the service different from engagement-optimized social media apps. </p>\n<p>Pulse is compatible with <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/06/04/chatgpt-introduces-meeting-recording-and-connectors-for-google-drive-box-and-more/\">ChatGPT’s Connectors</a>, so users can connect apps like Google Calendar and Gmail. Once that’s set up, Pulse will parse through your email overnight to surface the most important messages in the morning, or access your calendar to generate an agenda for upcoming events.</p>\n<p>If users have ChatGPT’s <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/04/18/chatgpt-will-now-use-its-memory-to-personalize-web-searches/\">memory features</a> turned on, Pulse will also pull in context from previous chats to improve your reports. OpenAI’s personalization lead, Christina Wadsworth Kaplan, gave an example of how Pulse automatically picked up on her love of running to create an itinerary for her upcoming trip to London that included running routes.</p>\n<p>Wadsworth Kaplan described Pulse as a “net-new functionality” for a consumer product. As a pescatarian, she says Pulse takes dinner reservations on her calendar and finds menu items that work with her diet.</p>\n<p>But it’s hard to overlook how Pulse could compete with existing news products, such as Apple News, paid newsletters, or traditional journalism outlets. Fry doesn’t expect Pulse to replace the various news apps people use, and the feature cites its sources with links in the same way ChatGPT Search does.</p>\n<p>It remains to be seen if Pulse is worth the computational power it requires to work. Fry says the service can “vary tremendously” in how much computing power it spends on a given task — for some projects, it’s fairly efficient, but others may require searching the web and synthesizing lots of documents.</p>\n<p>Eventually, OpenAI would like to make Pulse more agentic, to the point where it could make restaurant reservations on a user’s behalf, or draft emails that users could approve to be sent. But such features may be a long way out and would likely require OpenAI’s agentic models to improve a great deal before users would trust it with such decisions.</p>\n</div><div>\n<div>\n\t\t<p>Maxwell Zeff is a senior reporter at TechCrunch specializing in AI.

    "body": "<div>\n<p>For years, recruiters used machine learning to find potential hires by searching for keywords in résumés and LinkedIn profiles. Although this method helps to narrow the candidate pool, recruiters still have to manually review each profile to determine the best fit for the job.</p>\n<p>David Paffenholz (pictured left) and Ishan Gupta, then just 22 and 19, respectively, realized that LLMs could find talent faster and more efficiently. They built <a href=\"https://juicebox.ai/\" target=\"_blank\">Juicebox</a>, an AI-powered search engine that uses natural language to analyze professional profiles, personal websites, and other publicly available information to identify the most qualified candidates.</p>\n<p>After attending startup accelerator Y Combinator in the summer of 2022, Paffenholz and Gupta spent a couple more years refining their product. When their AI search engine, PeopleGPT, was ready in late 2023, it was quickly adopted by a wide range of customers, from small startups to large companies like Cognition, Ramp, and Perplexity.</p>\n<p>In a short period of time, it was serving over 2,500 customers and achieving more than $10 million in annual recurring revenue (ARR).</p>\n<p>On Thursday, Juicebox announced that it had raised $36 million in total funding, including a $30 million Series A round led by Sequoia.</p>\n<p>Sequoia partner David Cahn learned about the company while catching up with an early-stage startup founder who said that he is using Juicebox for all of his recruiting efforts. Cahn told TechCrunch that the founder has hired over a dozen people without using a professional recruiter, something that was previously very difficult to do.</p>\n<p>Such a rave review of Juicebox piqued Cahn’s interest. Shortly after, Cahn learned that Sequoia’s internal recruiter was also trying Juicebox to help the firm with its own hiring efforts, which made him even more excited about the startup’s growth potential.  </p>\n<div>\n\t\t<p>Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t<p><span>San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>October 27-29, 2025</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n<p>When Cahn eventually met with Paffenholz and Gupta, he was even more impressed.</p>\n<p>“I’m not sure I’ve ever in my career seen a company with four people that got to 2,000 customers with that small of a team,” Cahn told TechCrunch.</p>\n<p>Although Juicebox has since hired eight additional employees, the company continues to attract customers without a sales team.</p>\n<p>Customers are flocking to Juicebox in part because hiring speed is extremely important for companies racing to build AI functionalities.</p>\n<p>What sets Juicebox’s search engine apart is its ability to infer information about candidates much like a human would.</p>\n<p>“We help find net new candidates that wouldn’t be found elsewhere, because the profiles might not have the keywords or the types of things that we’d expect them to have in the regular searches,” Paffenholz told TechCrunch.</p>\n<p>The startup’s product is popular not only with small companies that lack a dedicated recruiter, but also with talent teams at large corporations. By automating the candidate search, the tool frees up internal recruiters to focus more on building relationships with potential hires.</p>\n<p>Once Juicebox identifies candidates, its agent can automatically email them and schedule initial calls.</p>\n<p>While Juicebox is growing quickly, older talent acquisition startups like <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/10/ai-startup-eightfold-valued-at-2-1b-in-softbank-led-220m-funding/\">Eightfold</a> are also adding AI-powered search functionality to their offerings.</p>\n<p>Still, Cahn is convinced that Paffenholz and Gupta can transform Juicebox into an essential product for every startup’s technology stack.</p>\n<p>“We’ve invested in a number of businesses that become defaults for startups, like Stripe,” he said. “I think Juicebox has a chance to be a default where, every single startup, [it’s] the first thing they use to hire their first employees.”</p>\n</div><div>\n<div>\n\t\t<p>Marina Temkin is a venture capital and startups reporter at TechCrunch.

    "body": "<div>\n<p>Amazon has agreed to pay $2.5 billion to settle a lawsuit from the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) over allegations that it duped users into paying for Prime subscriptions and made it hard to cancel memberships.</p>\n<p>The company will be required to pay a $1 billion civil penalty and provide $1.5 billion in refunds to an estimated 35 million consumers harmed by the company’s “deceptive Prime enrollment practices,” the FTC says. Amazon is also required to stop its “unlawful enrollment and cancellation practices.”</p>\n<p>The suit, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2023/06/21/ftc-sues-amazon-over-deceptive-tactics-used-to-sign-up-customers-for-prime/\">filed in June 2023</a> under the Biden administration, claimed that Amazon created confusing and deceptive user interfaces to lead consumers to enroll in Prime without their knowledge. It also created a complex process for consumers looking to cancel their subscription by making them go through unnecessary steps, the FTC alleged.</p>\n<p>The settlement comes as Amazon and the FTC had just begun the trial this week, during which a jury was supposed to decide the outcome.</p>\n<p>“The evidence showed that Amazon used sophisticated subscription traps designed to manipulate consumers into enrolling in Prime, and then made it exceedingly hard for consumers to end their subscription,” said FTC Chairman Andrew N. Ferguson in a press release. “Today, we are putting billions of dollars back into Americans’ pockets, and making sure Amazon never does this again.”</p>\n<p>As part of the settlement, Amazon is required to include a clear button for customers to decline signing up for Prime. This means that the company can no longer have a button that says “No, I don’t want free shipping.”</p>\n<p>Amazon must also clearly disclose the subscription cost during the enrollment process, along with the billing date and frequency, whether the subscription auto-renews, and the procedure for cancellation. Additionally, the company is required to create an easy way for consumers to cancel Prime, using the same method that consumers used to sign up for the service.</p>\n<div>\n\t\t<p>Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t<p><span>San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>October 27-29, 2025</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n<p>“Amazon and our executives have always followed the law and this settlement allows us to move forward and focus on innovating for customers,” Amazon said in a statement. “We work incredibly hard to make it clear and simple for customers to both sign up or cancel their Prime membership, and to offer substantial value for our many millions of loyal Prime members around the world. We will continue to do so, and look forward to what we’ll deliver for Prime members in the coming years.”</p>\n<p>The settlement is one of the largest in the FTC’s history. In 2019, Facebook (now Meta) <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2019/07/24/facebook-settles-with-ftc-5-billion-and-new-privacy-guarantees/\">reached a $5 billion settlement</a> with the agency for violating consumers’ privacy.</p>\n<p>It’s worth noting that Amazon still faces another federal lawsuit, in which the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2023/09/26/the-ftc-just-hit-amazon-with-a-major-antitrust-lawsuit/\">FTC has accused the company of illegally stifling competition</a> on its way to becoming a ubiquitous retail presence and one of the world’s most valuable companies. </p>\n</div><div>\n<div>\n\t\t<p>Aisha is a consumer news reporter at TechCrunch.

    "body": "<div>\n<p>One day, Shashwat Murarka sat in his college apartment thinking about his relationship with food delivery. Sometimes, the order never arrived, and he had to wander through his apartment building, looking for the misplaced food. Other times, he found himself giving step-by-step directions to confused deliverers who, it seemed, were just as annoyed as he. </p>\n<p>“What started as frustration turned into a mission to fix one of the most overlooked problems in the supply chain, the final stretch of the last mile,” he told TechCrunch. He started studying the delivery supply chain, ran deliveries himself, and decided during his senior year in college to go all in on the problem. </p>\n<p>He teamed up with his friend Sheel Patel and launched <a href=\"https://www.doorstep.ai/\" target=\"_blank\">Doorstep to help with delivery tracking.</a> Murarka, who is CEO, said that standard GPS works wonders outdoors, but fails inside buildings, which creates a blind spot for deliverers.</p>\n<p>Doorstep integrates into existing delivery apps and then, using phone sensors, tracks when a driver has entered a building, gone up an elevator, and made it to the desired doorstep.  </p>\n<p>This data is given to the delivery platform in which the driver works, like Uber Eats or DoorDash, and then can be used to automate dispute resolution and properly validate deliveries, essentially ending the drama behind missing food and blurry proof-of-delivery photos. Murarka said the company doesn’t collect driver or user information and that it maintains “the same privacy and security standards platforms already have in place.” </p>\n<p>“Our technology gives customer support teams the visibility they’ve been missing, providing real-time, verifiable data on what actually happens inside buildings to resolve refunds automatically,” Murarka said. “Solving that blind spot unlocks enormous value for platforms, drivers, merchants, and customers alike.” </p>\n<p>On Thursday, the company announced an $8 million seed round led by Canaan Partners. Murarka described fundraising as “relentless,” and said he actually slept in the office of the accelerator Antler when he first moved to New York. </p>\n<div>\n\t\t<p>Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t<p><span>San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>October 27-29, 2025</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n<p>“Every step has been about funding the earliest believer,” he continued. “The people who don’t just want to watch the journey but want to be part of it and stay the course.” </p>\n<p>He said Doorstep raised this round in about a week and that he met their lead investor at Canaan through network connections. Others in this round include Antler, Cercano Management, Cassius, and Sean Henry, a scout at Kleiner Perkins. Murarka said the fresh capital will be used to move the technology from pilot to full production. He’s also looking to hire in engineering and product. </p>\n<p>Murarka considers the company’s competitors to be other hardware-based solutions, like standard building sensors, lockers, and cameras. “Hardware is expensive and slow to scale, while GPS simply doesn’t work indoors,” he said. The company is already active in all U.S. states, though it declined to share customers’ names. </p>\n<p>Murarka hopes his company can end the pain associated with a missing food delivery. </p>\n<p>“For me, this isn’t just about stopping fraud or refunds. It’s about rebuilding trust between platforms and customers and between drivers and the work they do,” he said. “Drivers are the backbone of delivery platforms, and having experienced those challenges ourselves, we hope to make their work easier through Doorstep.” </p>\n</div><div>\n<div>\n\t\t<p>Dominic-Madori Davis is a senior venture capital and startup reporter at TechCrunch.

    "body": "<div>\n<p>OpenAI released a new <a href=\"https://openai.com/index/gdpval-v0\" target=\"_blank\">benchmark</a> on Thursday that tests how its AI models perform compared to human professionals across a wide range of industries and jobs. The test, GDPval, is an early attempt at understanding how close OpenAI’s systems are to outperforming humans at economically valuable work — a key part of the company’s founding mission to develop artificial general intelligence, or AGI.</p>\n<p>OpenAI says its found that its GPT-5 model and Anthropic’s Claude Opus 4.1 “are already approaching the quality of work produced by industry experts.” </p>\n<p>That’s not to say that OpenAI’s models are going to start replacing humans in their jobs immediately. Despite predictions by some CEOs that <a href=\"https://www.axios.com/2025/05/28/ai-jobs-white-collar-unemployment-anthropic\" target=\"_blank\">AI will take the jobs of humans in just a few years,</a> OpenAI admits that GDPval today covers a very limited number of tasks people do in their real jobs. However, it is one of the latest ways the company is measuring AI’s progress toward this milestone.</p>\n<p>GDPval is based on nine industries that contribute the most to America’s gross domestic product, including domains such as healthcare, finance, manufacturing, and government. The benchmark tests an AI model’s performance in 44 occupations among those industries, ranging from software engineers to nurses to journalists.</p>\n<p>For OpenAI’s first version of the test, GDPval-v0, OpenAI asked experienced professionals to compare AI-generated reports with those produced by other professionals, and then choose the best one. For example, one prompt asked investment bankers to create a competitor landscape for the last-mile delivery industry and compare them to AI-generated reports. OpenAI then averages an AI model’s “win rate” against the human reports across all 44 occupations.</p>\n<p>For GPT-5-high, a souped-up version of GPT-5 with extra computational power, the company says the AI model was ranked as better than or on par with industry experts 40.6% of the time.</p>\n<p>OpenAI also tested Anthropic’s Claude Opus 4.1 model, which was ranked as better than or on par with industry experts in 49% of tasks. OpenAI says that it believes Claude scored so high because of its tendency to make pleasing graphics, rather than sheer performance.</p>\n<div>\n\t\t<p>Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t<p><span>San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>October 27-29, 2025</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n<figure><img src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Screenshot-2025-09-25-at-9.10.47AM.png?w=680\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Screenshot-2025-09-25-at-9.10.47AM.png 1380w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Screenshot-2025-09-25-at-9.10.47AM.png?resize=150,109 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Screenshot-2025-09-25-at-9.10.47AM.png?resize=300,217 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Screenshot-2025-09-25-at-9.10.47AM.png?resize=768,557 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Screenshot-2025-09-25-at-9.10.47AM.png?resize=680,493 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Screenshot-2025-09-25-at-9.10.47AM.png?resize=1200,870 1200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Screenshot-2025-09-25-at-9.10.47AM.png?resize=1280,928 1280w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Screenshot-2025-09-25-at-9.10.47AM.png?resize=430,312 430w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Screenshot-2025-09-25-at-9.10.47AM.png?resize=720,522 720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Screenshot-2025-09-25-at-9.10.47AM.png?resize=900,652 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Screenshot-2025-09-25-at-9.10.47AM.png?resize=800,580 800w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Screenshot-2025-09-25-at-9.10.47AM.png?resize=668,484 668w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Screenshot-2025-09-25-at-9.10.47AM.png?resize=518,375 518w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Screenshot-2025-09-25-at-9.10.47AM.png?resize=851,617 851w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Screenshot-2025-09-25-at-9.10.47AM.png?resize=708,513 708w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Screenshot-2025-09-25-at-9.10.47AM.png?resize=50,36 50w\" /><figcaption><span><strong>Image Credits:</strong>OpenAI</span></figcaption></figure>\n<p>It’s worth noting that most working professionals do a lot more than submit research reports to their boss, which is all that GDPval-v0 tests for. OpenAI acknowledges this and says it plans to create more robust tests in the future that can account for more industries and interactive workflows.</p>\n<p>Nonetheless, the company sees the progress on GDPval as notable.</p>\n<p>In an interview with TechCrunch, OpenAI’s chief economist Dr. Aaron Chatterji said GDPval’s results suggest that people in these jobs can now use AI models to spend time on more meaningful tasks.</p>\n<p>“[Because] the model is getting good at some of these things,” Chatterji says, “people in those jobs can now use the model, increasingly as capabilities get better, to offload some of their work and do potentially higher value things.”</p>\n<p>OpenAI’s evaluations lead Tejal Patwardhan tells TechCrunch that she’s encouraged by the rate of progress on GDPval. OpenAI’s GPT-4o model scored just 13.7% (wins and ties versus humans), which was released roughly 15 months ago. Now GPT-5 scores nearly triple that, a trend Patwardhan expects to continue.</p>\n<p>Silicon Valley has a wide range of benchmarks it uses to measure the progress of AI models and assess whether a given model is state-of-the-art. Among the most popular are AIME 2025 (a test of competitive math problems) and GPQA Diamond (a test of PhD-level science questions). However, several AI models are <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/08/07/openais-gpt-5-is-here/\">nearing saturation</a> on some of these benchmarks, and many AI researchers have cited the need for <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/03/19/the-ai-leaders-bringing-the-agi-debate-down-to-earth/\">better tests</a> that can measure AI’s proficiency on real-world tasks.</p>\n<p>Benchmarks like GDPval could become increasingly important in that conversation, as OpenAI makes the case that its AI models are valuable for a wide range of industries. But OpenAI may need a more comprehensive version of the test to definitively say its AI models can outperform humans.</p>\n</div><div>\n<div>\n\t\t<p>Maxwell Zeff is a senior reporter at TechCrunch specializing in AI.
