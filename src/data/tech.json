Users get 10 times higher usage limits than the free plan for sending questions or prompts, generating images, and uploading files. The plan also allows ChatGPT to remember previous conversations better, enabling more personalized responses over time, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://x.com/nickaturley/status/1970327855038111948\">ChatGPT head Nick Turley said</a> on X.</p>\n<p>Turley said that since the company launched the ChatGPT Go plan in India, paid subscribers have more than doubled.</p>\n<p>This move puts OpenAI in direct competition with Google, which launched its own <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://x.com/GeminiApp/status/1965490977000640833\">similarly-priced AI Plus subscription plan</a> in Indonesia earlier this month. Google’s AI Plus plan gives users access to its Gemini 2.5 Pro chatbot, along with creative tools for image and video creation like Flow, Whisk, and Veo 3 Fast. The plan also includes enhanced features for Google’s AI research assistant NotebookLM and integrates AI capabilities into Gmail, Docs, and Sheets, along with 200GB of cloud storage.<br /></p>\n</div>\n<div>\n\t<p>Topics</p>\n</div>\n</div><div><div>\n\t<div>\n\t\t<p>Subscribe for the industry’s biggest tech news</p>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n<p></p><h2 id=\"h-latest-in\">Latest in AI</h2><p></p>\n</div>"

    "body": "<div>\n<p>One year ago, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/tag/stellantis/\">Stellantis</a> announced plans to add an electrified 4xe plug-in hybrid Jeep Gladiator to North America by the end of 2025. The electrified Jeep Gladiator never made it into production.</p>\n<p>The automaker will no longer include an electrified Gladiator in its Jeep lineup as it reassesses its product strategy, the company told TechCrunch in an emailed statement. The company cited changing customer preferences as a primary driver of its decision. </p>\n<p>“The Jeep Gladiator carries its rugged styling and authentic design into 2026 while adding incredible new content straight from the factory,” the statement reads. “It will continue to serve as the industry’s only open-air pickup truck, combining legendary Jeep 4×4 capability with exceptional everyday versatility. As customers’ propulsion preferences for battery-electric trucks continue to evolve, Stellantis is reassessing its product strategy and will no longer include an electrified Gladiator variant in the Jeep lineup. The Jeep brand has already begun reinvesting funding to ensure the long-term growth of the Jeep Gladiator and will introduce even more customer-requested factory features, customization, and additional powertrain options in the near future.”</p>\n<p>The Gladiator is the latest electrified vehicle hopeful to get the axe. Last week, Stellantis said it would no longer develop a battery-electric full-size pickup under its Ram brand, a vehicle that was supposed to be part of the automaker’s U.S. product offensive to sell more than <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2022/03/01/how-stellantis-plans-to-double-revenue-electrify-lineup-by-2030/\" target=\"_blank\">25 all-new BEVs</a> by the end of the decade.</p>\n<p>Stellantis cited low demand for full-size battery-electric trucks as the primary reason. The automaker will instead pursue an extended-range truck that gets an estimated 690 miles of range through a novel — but not unheard of — approach of combining a battery with a gas generator.</p>\n<p>Stellantis isn’t the only automaker to pullback on once grand plans around electric vehicles. Many major automakers, including Ford, GM, Mercedes, and VW Group have made pledges to invest billions of dollars in electric vehicles only to pivot later. A combination of lower-than-expected demand, saturation amid the luxury EV market, and the imminent <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/08/11/techcrunch-mobility-the-triple-punch-headed-for-automakers/\">end of the U.S. federal EV tax credit</a> have been cited as reasons for changing business strategies.</p>\n<p>Some of these companies have shifted energy and dollars toward lower-cost EVs, which a larger swath of the population can afford, but the vehicles come with slimmer margins.</p>\n<p>Newcomer Slate is developing a <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/07/10/slate-auto-everything-you-need-to-know-about-the-bezos-backed-ev-startup/\">minimalist electric pickup</a> that’s expected to cost under $30,000. Ford has delayed the launch of two next-generation electric vehicles, including a full-size electric pickup, to focus on smaller and more affordable models. In August, Ford announced it would<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/08/11/ford-throws-out-henry-fords-assembly-line-to-make-low-cost-evs-in-america/\"> invest $2 billion</a> to transform its Louisville Assembly Plant into a factory capable of making a new generation of affordable EVs, starting with a mid-sized pickup truck with a base price of $30,000 that is slated to launch in 2027.</p>\n</div><div>\n<div><p>\n\t\tKirsten Korosec is a reporter and editor who has covered the future of transportation from EVs and autonomous vehicles to urban air mobility and in-car tech for more than a decade.

That means investors are betting on the founder, not the business. And few know how to make that call better than Hudson and Chan. Between them, they’ve backed hundreds of founders at the earliest stages, before the pitch decks were polished, before there were metrics to show, and often before a single line of code had shipped.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/chudson\" target=\"_blank\">Charles Hudson</a>, managing partner of Precursor Ventures, has invested in more than 400 companies and supported over 450 founders. He’s built his reputation on backing people with bold ideas and unique perspectives, saying recently: <em>“The earlier you invest, the more important it is to believe in the founder’s narrative and ability to adapt. It’s not just about solving a problem — it’s about whether I believe you’re the one to do it.”</em></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/weschan\" target=\"_blank\">Wesley Chan</a>, co-founder and managing partner at FPV Ventures, is known for placing bold early bets on category-defining companies. A Google veteran, he helped create Google Analytics and Google Voice before moving into venture, where he’s backed unicorns like Canva, Robinhood, and Plaid. His investing philosophy centers on identifying mission-driven founders who can turn scrappy beginnings into lasting impact.</p>\n<h2 id=\"h-actionable-insights-on-raising-your-first-round\">Actionable insights on raising your first round</h2>\n<p>Whether you’re currently raising or planning for the future, this session will equip you with real, actionable advice on navigating early venture with clarity and conviction.

    "body": "<div>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.rocket.new/\" target=\"_blank\">Rocket.new</a>, an Indian startup building an AI-powered app development platform, has raised $15 million in a seed round led by Salesforce Ventures to take on viral vibe-coding rivals like Lovable, Cursor, and Bolt by letting users build full, production-ready apps from natural-language prompts rather than just quick prototypes.</p>\n<p>Accel and Together Fund joined Salesforce Ventures in the all-equity seed round, which comes only three months after Rocket.new launched its platform in beta in June.</p>\n<p>Since its debut, the startup has crossed 400,000 users — including over 10,000 paid subscribers — in 180 countries and reached $4.5 million in annual recurring revenue. It is aiming to scale that to $20–$25 million by year’s end and $60–$70 million by June next year, co-founder and CEO Vishal Virani (pictured above, center) said in an exclusive interview.</p>\n<p>Based in Surat — a city famous for diamonds and textiles but far from India’s usual tech hubs — Virani teamed up with Rahul Shingala and Deepak Dhanak to launch Rocket.new. The startup marks a pivot from their earlier venture, DhiWise, which focused on developer workflows.</p>\n<p>“We are building the first vibe solution platform, which is not solving just a problem of day one, but what we are focusing on is solving the problem of day two,” Virani told TechCrunch.</p>\n<p>The 16-week-old startup aims to become a comprehensive agentic system, which will utilize AI not only to build apps and websites but also to conduct competitive research and product development, eliminating the need for product managers.</p>\n<p>“Our entire agentic system will help organizations build all kinds of functions around products — not just generating the source code — but even a facility to scale their product — all by giving natural-language prompts,” Virani asserted.</p>\n<div>\n\t\t<p>Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t<p><span>San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>October 27-29, 2025</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n<p>The current model, which Virani refers to as version 0.3, has already built half a million applications and attracted product managers, solopreneurs, and front-end developers. It also counts users from companies like Meta, PayPal, KPMG, PwC, and Times Internet, who turn to the platform for personal projects.</p>\n<figure><img src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/rocket-new-platform-screenshot.jpg\" alt=\"Rocket.new\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/rocket-new-platform-screenshot.jpg 1910w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/rocket-new-platform-screenshot.jpg?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/rocket-new-platform-screenshot.jpg?resize=300,168 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/rocket-new-platform-screenshot.jpg?resize=768,430 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/rocket-new-platform-screenshot.jpg?resize=680,381 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/rocket-new-platform-screenshot.jpg?resize=1200,672 1200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/rocket-new-platform-screenshot.jpg?resize=1280,717 1280w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/rocket-new-platform-screenshot.jpg?resize=430,241 430w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/rocket-new-platform-screenshot.jpg?resize=720,403 720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/rocket-new-platform-screenshot.jpg?resize=900,504 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/rocket-new-platform-screenshot.jpg?resize=800,448 800w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/rocket-new-platform-screenshot.jpg?resize=1536,860 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/rocket-new-platform-screenshot.jpg?resize=668,375 668w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/rocket-new-platform-screenshot.jpg?resize=1101,617 1101w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/rocket-new-platform-screenshot.jpg?resize=708,397 708w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/rocket-new-platform-screenshot.jpg?resize=50,28 50w\" /><figcaption><span><strong>Image Credits:</strong>Rocket.new</span></figcaption></figure>\n<p>About 80% of Rocket.new’s users have so far built what Virani calls “serious” applications rather than simple landing pages or branding sites. Roughly 12% have created e-commerce platforms in segments like grocery and apparel, 10% have built fintech apps, 5–6% have developed B2B tools, and 4–5% have launched mental health apps, he said.</p>\n<p>Roughly 45% of Rocket.new’s users are building mobile apps and 55% are building websites, Virani said. He added that many users build a website on Lovable or Replit, then turn to Rocket.new to generate a native mobile app by integrating with their existing Supabase backend.</p>\n<p>The platform combines large language models from Anthropic, OpenAI, and Google’s Gemini with Rocket.new’s own deep learning systems, which are trained on proprietary datasets from DhiWise.</p>\n<p>“Our underlying architecture is completely different from what Lovable, Bolt, and everyone is doing,” Virani told TechCrunch.</p>\n<p>Generating the first application takes about 25 minutes — much slower than most vibe-coding tools, which usually produce results within three. But in our early testing, Rocket.new delivered a more comprehensive user experience, with all essential modules included.</p>\n<p>Rocket.new offers a free trial capped at one million tokens. After that, users pay a monthly subscription starting at $25 for five million tokens.</p>\n<p>This model effectively discourages hobbyists, while giving Rocket.new a healthy gross margin of 50–55% — a figure it aims to raise to 60–70% within the next few months.</p>\n<p>The U.S. is Rocket.new’s largest market, contributing 26% of revenue, followed by Europe at 15–20% and India at 10%. To better serve its American users, the startup is establishing a U.S. headquarters in Palo Alto.</p>\n<p>Virani noted that Rocket.new’s early traction was organic, driven by word-of-mouth and viral social posts. With fresh seed funding, the startup is looking to sharpen its go-to-market playbook, deepen its presence in key markets, and accelerate work on proprietary models and R&D.</p>\n<p>“We saw a clear gap between the magic of AI code generation and the reality of making that code production-ready,” Kartik Gupta, Investor at Salesforce Ventures, told TechCrunch over email. “Rocket.new is purpose-built to solve this problem of iteration, maintenance, and deployment at enterprise scale.”</p>\n<p>Rocket.new currently has a 58-member team, primarily in Surat, and expects to double its engineering and product staff in India over the next 12 months to support growth.</p>\n</div>"

    "body": "<div>\n<p>There’s a <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=abq9Y7YVDWA\">classic Simpsons episode</a> in which the sly businessman Mr. Burns recruits real Major League Baseball players to join his company softball team in order to win a bet. But when the championship is on the line, Mr. Burns pulls eight-time National League all-star Darryl Strawberry for a substitute, Homer Simpson.</p>\n<p>“You’re a left-hander, and so is the pitcher. If I send up a right-handed batter, it’s called playing the percentages,” Mr. Burns says to Strawberry. “It’s what smart managers do to win ballgames.”</p>\n<p>High-level baseball is very mathematically-driven, with teams hiring dozens of data engineers to study granular statistics that can inform managerial decisions. But like Mr. Burns in that Simpsons episode, it’s tempting to overanalyze baseball statistics to the point of absurdity.</p>\n<p>The Oakland Ballers, an independent Pioneer League baseball team, took that concept of “playing the percentages” to the next level: they let an AI manage the team for a game.</p>\n<p>The Ballers were <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/09/08/the-coolest-startup-in-the-bay-area-is-a-baseball-team-called-the-oakland-ballers/\">founded by edtech entrepreneur Paul Freedman</a> as a salve to the departure of the beloved Oakland A’s, the Major League baseball team that owner John Fisher ripped away from local fans in what’s regarded as one of the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://abc7news.com/post/angry-sad-oakland-athletics-fans-respond-owner-john-fishers-goodbye-letter/15353346/\">most insidious</a> <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.si.com/mlb/athletics/relocation/heard-on-espn-john-fisher-is-the-worst-owner-in-sports\">managerial moves</a> in sports history. Though they’re not a Major League team, the Oakland Ballers – coyly, the Oakland B’s – established an unprecedented national community of fans who rallied around the team in protest of the A’s departure. After just two seasons, the Ballers just won Oakland’s <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://sfstandard.com/2025/09/22/oakland-ballers-title-championship-pioneer-league/\">first baseball title</a> since 1989.</p>\n<p>“The Oakland Ballers uniquely have the experience of being like a major league team in a minor league market,” Freedman told TechCrunch. “We can have creative flexibility. We can play with things and experiment with things way before the MLB or NBA or any of those leagues could do something.”</p>\n<p>Minor league baseball organizations are often called upon to test new technology before it gets implemented in the majors, like challenging calls with instant replay footage or the automated ball-strike system. The Ballers embraced this attitude, especially given Freedman’s own background in tech, but have added in a dash of whimsy, piloting things that would never actually debut in Major League Baseball.</p>\n<div>\n\t\t<p>Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t<p><span>San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>October 27-29, 2025</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n<p>Last year, this meant partnering with <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://x.com/fancontrolled?lang=en\">Fan Controlled Sports</a> to let fans make managerial decisions during one late season game. The Ballers ended up losing that game, in part because fans advocated for the funniest possible managerial decisions, rather than the savviest – at one point, the fans called upon a pitcher to pinch hit.</p>\n<p>This time around, once the team clinched their postseason berth, the Ballers partnered with the AI company <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://distillery.com/our-services/ai-development/\">Distillery</a> to commission AI software that could manage a baseball game in real time.</p>\n<p>“Baseball is the perfect place to do an initial experiment like this, because it is so data-driven, and decisions are made very analytically,” Freedman told TechCrunch. “You have the pace to be able to do something literally after every pitch.”</p>\n<p>Distillery trained OpenAI’s ChatGPT on over a century’s worth of baseball data and analytics, including Ballers games, to approximate what decisions Ballers manager Aaron Miles would make.</p>\n<p>“What the AI did was figure out what our human coach would have done – the ingenuity on strategy and the concepts came from [Miles], and the ability to use the data and recognize patterns… is what the AI did throughout the course of the game,” Freedman said. “So I think the role of human ingenuity is safe for now, and AI is a tool to be deployed to optimize decisions, but not to make them.”</p>\n<p>The AI-controlled game went smoothly – in fact, the AI made all of the same choices regarding pitching changes, lineup construction, and pinch hitters that Miles would have made. The only time that Miles had to override the AI was to replace the starting catcher with his backup, since he was sick.</p>\n<p>Miles took his temporary replacement by AI in stride – perhaps because he knows that his job is not actually in jeopardy. In a <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.instagram.com/reel/DOR5aekEhHg\">video posted to the Ballers’ Instagram</a>, Miles walks to home plate before the game to shake hands with the opposing team’s manager – only instead of offering his own hand, he extends the tablet running the AI out for a handshake.</p>\n<p>But the use of AI struck a nerve for Oakland fans, who see companies like OpenAI – which powered Distillery’s baseball AI – as enterprises that prioritize “winning” the AI race over shipping products that have been properly tested for safety. For many fans, the AI experiment felt like a betrayal, similar to the kind of corporate greed that pushed three professional sports franchises out of Oakland in five years.</p>\n<p>“There goes the Ballers trying to appeal to Bay Area techies instead of baseball fans,” one commenter wrote. “It’s so over for Oakland.”</p>\n<p>This backlash wasn’t what the Ballers expected, and Freedman does not intend to repeat this AI experiment. But the reaction of the fans models a larger cultural tension in baseball and beyond. </p>\n<p>“It never feels good to have your fans be like, ‘We hate this,’” Freedman said. “But it’s not a bad thing that there’s more of a conversation about the pluses and minuses of this new technology now, as opposed to like, a decade later when it’s too late.”</p>\n</div><div>\n<div>\n\t\t<p>Amanda Silberling is a senior writer at TechCrunch covering the intersection of technology and culture.

    "body": "<div>\n<p>Google’s AI assistant, Gemini, is coming to your TV. On Monday, the company <a href=\"https://blog.google/products/google-tv/gemini-google-tv/\" target=\"_blank\">announced</a> it’s introducing Gemini for Google TV, allowing TV owners to engage in free-flowing, natural language conversations with the AI.</p>\n<p>When fully rolled out, this expansion of Gemini to a new platform will bring Google’s AI to over 300 million active <a href=\"https://tv.google/\" target=\"_blank\">Google TV</a> and other Android TV OS-powered devices.</p>\n<p>In terms of TV-related questions, Google suggests its Gemini AI could be used to help people with different interests settle on something to watch that they would both like, or to catch you up on what you missed in a past season of a favorite show. You could also get Gemini to help you find a movie or show when you can’t remember the title or ask about a title’s reviews to help determine if it’s worth watching.</p>\n<p>However, because it’s Gemini, you can ask any other type of question, too, just as you could with the AI chatbot on your smartphone.</p>\n<p> For instance, kids and parents could use the AI to get homework help or brainstorm school project ideas, families could use Gemini to plan their next vacation, or individual users could leverage the AI to teach themselves a new skill, among other things.</p>\n<figure><img src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Volcano_Gemini_TV-Shell.width-1000.format-webp.webp\" alt=\"a photo of a Google TV showing a response on screen showing a prompt: \"explain why volcanoes erupt to my third grader\".\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Volcano_Gemini_TV-Shell.width-1000.format-webp.webp 1000w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Volcano_Gemini_TV-Shell.width-1000.format-webp.webp?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Volcano_Gemini_TV-Shell.width-1000.format-webp.webp?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Volcano_Gemini_TV-Shell.width-1000.format-webp.webp?resize=768,432 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Volcano_Gemini_TV-Shell.width-1000.format-webp.webp?resize=680,382 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Volcano_Gemini_TV-Shell.width-1000.format-webp.webp?resize=430,242 430w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Volcano_Gemini_TV-Shell.width-1000.format-webp.webp?resize=720,405 720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Volcano_Gemini_TV-Shell.width-1000.format-webp.webp?resize=900,506 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Volcano_Gemini_TV-Shell.width-1000.format-webp.webp?resize=800,450 800w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Volcano_Gemini_TV-Shell.width-1000.format-webp.webp?resize=668,375 668w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Volcano_Gemini_TV-Shell.width-1000.format-webp.webp?resize=708,398 708w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Volcano_Gemini_TV-Shell.width-1000.format-webp.webp?resize=50,28 50w\" /><figcaption><span><strong>Image Credits:</strong>Google</span></figcaption></figure>\n<p>The company stresses that Gemini’s addition doesn’t mean that you won’t be able to do the same things you used to be able to do through the (non-AI) Google Assistant integration. Those commands will still work, says Google.</p>\n<p>The Gemini rollout to Google TV begins on the TCL QM9K series, starting today.</p>\n<p>Later in the year, Gemini will arrive on the Google TV Streamer; Walmart onn 4K Pro; 2025 Hisense U7, U8, and UX models; and 2025 TCL QM7K, QM8K, and X11K models.
