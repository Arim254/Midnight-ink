The company’s request comes the same week that President Donald Trump — who Tesla CEO Elon Musk <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2025/02/01/politics/elon-musk-2024-election-spending-millions\" target=\"_blank\">spent $300 million</a> to help elect — told the United Nations General Assembly that he thinks climate change is a “con job” and a “scam.”</p>\n<p>Tesla also asked the EPA not to scuttle a 2009 legal standard known as the Endangerment Finding, which many modern environmental regulations (like the vehicle emissions standards) are based on. Tesla said that finding is “based on a robust factual and scientific record,” according to the company’s letter to the agency.</p>\n<p>The EPA has been seeking comment since August for these proposed attacks on environmental rules. The agency’s administrator, Lee Zeldin, said at the time that, if passed, the rollbacks would drive “a dagger into the heart of the climate change religion.”</p>\n<p>Tesla’s nominal mission is to “accelerate the world’s transition to sustainable energy.” But the company financially benefits from stricter environmental regulations. When other automakers fall short of fleet emissions goals, they pay companies like Tesla hundreds of millions of dollars to buy “credits” to make up the difference. (Those credits technically come from a California program that has <a href=\"https://calmatters.org/environment/2025/05/california-electric-car-mandate-senate-revoke-waiver/\" target=\"_blank\">also been a Republican target</a>.) While Tesla is asking for the standards to be maintained, the company told the EPA it is “open to discussing mechanisms to streamline” them in order to keep them around. </p>\n</div>\n<div>\n\t<p>Topics</p>\n</div>\n</div><div><div>\n\t<div>\n\t\t<p>Subscribe for the industry’s biggest tech news</p>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n<p></p><h2 id=\"h-latest-in\">Latest in Transportation</h2><p></p>\n</div>"

    "body": "<div>\n<p>President Donald Trump has signed an <a href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/09/saving-tiktok-while-protecting-national-security/\" target=\"_blank\">executive order</a> that essentially approves the sale of TikTok’s U.S. operations to an American investor group in order to keep the social media app operational in the country. Vice President JD Vance said that the deal would value TikTok US at “around $14 billion.”</p>\n<p>TikTok was required to divest its American business or be banned in the U.S. via a national security law originally signed by former president Joe Biden. Trump’s executive order essentially bars the attorney general or Department of Justice from enforcing that law for 120 days while the divestiture plan presented to the president is executed.</p>\n<p>TikTok’s owner ByteDance has not yet publicly acknowledged the deal or executive order, but did, on September 19, issue a <a href=\"https://newsroom.tiktok.com/september-19?lang=en\" target=\"_blank\">statement</a> that “it will work in accordance with applicable laws to ensure TikTok remains available to American users through TikTok U.S.”</p>\n<p>Trump said China’s president Xi Jinping spoke to him and gave him approval.</p>\n<p>“I spoke with President Xi; we had a good talk,” Trump said <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3urjiwp_wQ\" target=\"_blank\">during a briefing with reporters</a>. “I told him what we were doing, and he said, ‘Go ahead with it.”</p>\n<p>The order states that TikTok’ U.S. operations will establish a new board of directors, and that the app’s recommendation algorithm, source code, and content moderation system in the US will be transferred to the control of its new owners. Under the deal’s terms, Oracle will oversee the app’s security operations and provide computing services for TikTok US.</p>\n<p>“It’s owned by Americans, and very sophisticated Americans,” Trump said during the briefing. “This is going to be American operated all the way.”</p>\n<div>\n\t\t<p>Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t<p><span>San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>October 27-29, 2025</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n<p>Trump said that Oracle would be among the U.S. investors in TikTok US but did not disclose the full list of new owners. <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2025/09/25/trump-approves-tiktok-deal-through-executive-order.html\" target=\"_blank\">CNBC reports</a> that Oracle, Silver Lake, and Abu Dhabi-based MGX will get a 45% stake in TikTok’s US company.</p>\n<p>“This deal really does mean Americans can use TikTok but actually use it with more confidence than they had in the past because their data is secure and it won’t be used as a propaganda weapon like it has in the past,” Vance said.</p>\n<p>During the briefing, Trump stated that “every group, every philosophy, every policy will be treated fairly” after being asked if the algorithm would show MAGA-related content following the deal.</p>\n<p>Trump last week signed an executive order that extended ByteDance’s deadline to divest TikTok’s U.S. operations or be banned. This marked the fourth time that Trump extended the deadline.</p>\n<p>Trump initiated the push to ban TikTok in 2020, and the idea later received bipartisan backing during Biden’s administration.</p>\n</div><div>\n<div>\n\t\t<p>Aisha is a consumer news reporter at TechCrunch.

    "body": "<div>\n<p>One day, Shashwat Murarka sat in his college apartment thinking about his relationship with food delivery. Sometimes, the order never arrived, and he had to wander through his apartment building, looking for the misplaced food. Other times, he found himself giving step-by-step directions to confused deliverers who, it seemed, were just as annoyed as he. </p>\n<p>“What started as frustration turned into a mission to fix one of the most overlooked problems in the supply chain, the final stretch of the last mile,” he told TechCrunch. He started studying the delivery supply chain, ran deliveries himself, and decided during his senior year in college to go all in on the problem. </p>\n<p>He teamed up with his friend Sheel Patel and launched <a href=\"https://www.doorstep.ai/\" target=\"_blank\">Doorstep to help with delivery tracking.</a> Murarka, who is CEO, said that standard GPS works wonders outdoors, but fails inside buildings, which creates a blind spot for deliverers.</p>\n<p>Doorstep integrates into existing delivery apps and then, using phone sensors, tracks when a driver has entered a building, gone up an elevator, and made it to the desired doorstep.  </p>\n<p>This data is given to the delivery platform in which the driver works, like Uber Eats or DoorDash, and then can be used to automate dispute resolution and properly validate deliveries, essentially ending the drama behind missing food and blurry proof-of-delivery photos. Murarka said the company doesn’t collect driver or user information and that it maintains “the same privacy and security standards platforms already have in place.” </p>\n<p>“Our technology gives customer support teams the visibility they’ve been missing, providing real-time, verifiable data on what actually happens inside buildings to resolve refunds automatically,” Murarka said. “Solving that blind spot unlocks enormous value for platforms, drivers, merchants, and customers alike.” </p>\n<p>On Thursday, the company announced an $8 million seed round led by Canaan Partners. Murarka described fundraising as “relentless,” and said he actually slept in the office of the accelerator Antler when he first moved to New York. </p>\n<div>\n\t\t<p>Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t<p><span>San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>October 27-29, 2025</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n<p>“Every step has been about funding the earliest believer,” he continued. “The people who don’t just want to watch the journey but want to be part of it and stay the course.” </p>\n<p>He said Doorstep raised this round in about a week and that he met their lead investor at Canaan through network connections. Others in this round include Antler, Cercano Management, Cassius, and Sean Henry, a scout at Kleiner Perkins. Murarka said the fresh capital will be used to move the technology from pilot to full production. He’s also looking to hire in engineering and product. </p>\n<p>Murarka considers the company’s competitors to be other hardware-based solutions, like standard building sensors, lockers, and cameras. “Hardware is expensive and slow to scale, while GPS simply doesn’t work indoors,” he said. The company is already active in all U.S. states, though it declined to share customers’ names. </p>\n<p>Murarka hopes his company can end the pain associated with a missing food delivery. </p>\n<p>“For me, this isn’t just about stopping fraud or refunds. It’s about rebuilding trust between platforms and customers and between drivers and the work they do,” he said. “Drivers are the backbone of delivery platforms, and having experienced those challenges ourselves, we hope to make their work easier through Doorstep.” </p>\n</div><div>\n<div>\n\t\t<p>Dominic-Madori Davis is a senior venture capital and startup reporter at TechCrunch.

    "body": "<div>\n<p>For years, recruiters used machine learning to find potential hires by searching for keywords in résumés and LinkedIn profiles. Although this method helps to narrow the candidate pool, recruiters still have to manually review each profile to determine the best fit for the job.</p>\n<p>David Paffenholz (pictured left) and Ishan Gupta, then just 22 and 19, respectively, realized that LLMs could find talent faster and more efficiently. They built <a href=\"https://juicebox.ai/\" target=\"_blank\">Juicebox</a>, an AI-powered search engine that uses natural language to analyze professional profiles, personal websites, and other publicly available information to identify the most qualified candidates.</p>\n<p>After attending startup accelerator Y Combinator in the summer of 2022, Paffenholz and Gupta spent a couple more years refining their product. When their AI search engine, PeopleGPT, was ready in late 2023, it was quickly adopted by a wide range of customers, from small startups to large companies like Cognition, Ramp, and Perplexity.</p>\n<p>In a short period of time, it was serving over 2,500 customers and achieving more than $10 million in annual recurring revenue (ARR).</p>\n<p>On Thursday, Juicebox announced that it had raised $36 million in total funding, including a $30 million Series A round led by Sequoia.</p>\n<p>Sequoia partner David Cahn learned about the company while catching up with an early-stage startup founder who said that he is using Juicebox for all of his recruiting efforts. Cahn told TechCrunch that the founder has hired over a dozen people without using a professional recruiter, something that was previously very difficult to do.</p>\n<p>Such a rave review of Juicebox piqued Cahn’s interest. Shortly after, Cahn learned that Sequoia’s internal recruiter was also trying Juicebox to help the firm with its own hiring efforts, which made him even more excited about the startup’s growth potential.  </p>\n<div>\n\t\t<p>Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t<p><span>San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>October 27-29, 2025</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n<p>When Cahn eventually met with Paffenholz and Gupta, he was even more impressed.</p>\n<p>“I’m not sure I’ve ever in my career seen a company with four people that got to 2,000 customers with that small of a team,” Cahn told TechCrunch.</p>\n<p>Although Juicebox has since hired eight additional employees, the company continues to attract customers without a sales team.</p>\n<p>Customers are flocking to Juicebox in part because hiring speed is extremely important for companies racing to build AI functionalities.</p>\n<p>What sets Juicebox’s search engine apart is its ability to infer information about candidates much like a human would.</p>\n<p>“We help find net new candidates that wouldn’t be found elsewhere, because the profiles might not have the keywords or the types of things that we’d expect them to have in the regular searches,” Paffenholz told TechCrunch.</p>\n<p>The startup’s product is popular not only with small companies that lack a dedicated recruiter, but also with talent teams at large corporations. By automating the candidate search, the tool frees up internal recruiters to focus more on building relationships with potential hires.</p>\n<p>Once Juicebox identifies candidates, its agent can automatically email them and schedule initial calls.</p>\n<p>While Juicebox is growing quickly, older talent acquisition startups like <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/10/ai-startup-eightfold-valued-at-2-1b-in-softbank-led-220m-funding/\">Eightfold</a> are also adding AI-powered search functionality to their offerings.</p>\n<p>Still, Cahn is convinced that Paffenholz and Gupta can transform Juicebox into an essential product for every startup’s technology stack.</p>\n<p>“We’ve invested in a number of businesses that become defaults for startups, like Stripe,” he said. “I think Juicebox has a chance to be a default where, every single startup, [it’s] the first thing they use to hire their first employees.”</p>\n</div><div>\n<div>\n\t\t<p>Marina Temkin is a venture capital and startups reporter at TechCrunch.

    "body": "<div>\n<p>Amr Awadallah, founder of AI startup Vectara, had two reactions when he heard about changes to the H-1B visa program that <a href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/fact-sheets/2025/09/fact-sheet-president-donald-j-trump-suspends-the-entry-of-certain-alien-nonimmigrant-workers/\" target=\"_blank\">raise the application fee for each visa to $100,000</a>.</p>\n<p>He was not surprised. But he was dismayed.</p>\n<p>“I can’t afford to pay $100,000,” Awadallah told TechCrunch. He’s hired one employee on an H-1B, and while the new fee only applies to new applications, he believes it’s too high for many startups and will price them out of hiring internationally.</p>\n<p>The H-1B <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://techcrunch.com/2025/09/20/trump-hits-h-1b-visas-with-100000-fee-targeting-the-program-that-launched-elon-musk-and-instagram/\">visa was created to allow companies to hire skilled talent</a> from a worldwide market for such occupations as IT and engineering. On Friday, Trump announced that the fee hike, typically paid by the employer, would increase from $2,000-$5,000 to $100,000 per application, a change that will especially be felt with the new batch of visas available in March. </p>\n<p>Immigration is a key issue for President Trump, who, even dating back to his 2016 campaign run, accused companies of using the H-1B to take jobs from U.S. citizens.  </p>\n<p>Critics of the fee hike note that this visa helped bring in people who have gone on to start or run multibillion-dollar companies. Former holders include Google’s Sundar Pichai, Microsoft’s Satya Nadella, and Elon Musk. The visa has been more accessible than the O-1 visa for extraordinary ability, and quicker to obtain than a green card. </p>\n<p>“The impact will be severe on the competitiveness and innovation of smaller startups compared to the hyperscales, the big businesses,” Awadallah said. While Big Tech can more easily afford such fees, he feels that startups will miss out. Pricing startups out, he said, “will impact innovation in very, very negative ways longer term.” </p>\n<div>\n\t\t<p>Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t<p><span>San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>October 27-29, 2025</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n<h2 id=\"h-could-cost-the-tech-industry-5-5-billion-a-year\">Could cost the tech industry $5.5 billion a year</h2>\n<p>More than 700,000 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/sep/22/trump-h1b-visa-fee-explainer\" target=\"_blank\">people live in the U.S. on an H-1B</a>, and they’ve brought with them more than 500,000 dependents, such as spouses (who are permitted to work under this visa) and children, according to the immigration and criminal justice advocacy group fwd.us.

Others say it exploits foreign workers, as the visa is tied to the employer, so workers can’t easily switch jobs and they face deportation if they lose their jobs. </p>\n<figure><img src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/GettyImages-1460858229.jpg?w=680\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/GettyImages-1460858229.jpg 2121w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/GettyImages-1460858229.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/GettyImages-1460858229.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/GettyImages-1460858229.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/GettyImages-1460858229.jpg?resize=680,453 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/GettyImages-1460858229.jpg?resize=1200,800 1200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/GettyImages-1460858229.jpg?resize=1280,853 1280w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/GettyImages-1460858229.jpg?resize=430,287 430w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/GettyImages-1460858229.jpg?resize=720,480 720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/GettyImages-1460858229.jpg?resize=900,600 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/GettyImages-1460858229.jpg?resize=800,533 800w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/GettyImages-1460858229.jpg?resize=1536,1024 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/GettyImages-1460858229.jpg?resize=2048,1365 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/GettyImages-1460858229.jpg?resize=668,445 668w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/GettyImages-1460858229.jpg?resize=563,375 563w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/GettyImages-1460858229.jpg?resize=926,617 926w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/GettyImages-1460858229.jpg?resize=708,472 708w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/GettyImages-1460858229.jpg?resize=50,33 50w\" /><figcaption><span>More than 700,000 people live in the U.S. on an H-1B, and they’ve brought with them more than 500,000 dependents, such as spouses and children.</span><span><strong>Image Credits:</strong>Alexander Spatari</span></figcaption></figure>\n<p>Those who support the visa fee hike said that it could eliminate the lottery because the costs are now so high that employers would limit their applications.</p>\n<p>Of the 85,000 new H-1B visas issued each year, about 55,000 go to computer-related jobs, according to <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.designrush.com/\">business marketplace DesignRush</a>, which shared data with TechCrunch. Previously, the total cost of hiring these workers fell between $200 million and $400 million, but under the new fee, it would cost the tech industry $5.5 billion a year to hire H-1B tech workers. </p>\n<p>Under the proposed changes, the minimum salary employers must pay an H-1B recipient will also increase, a change touted to help prevent the undercutting of U.S. citizen worker salaries.</p>\n<p>But many questions still loom. For instance, Sophie Alcorn, an immigration lawyer who works with startups, said it’s unclear whether the $100,000 would be returned to the payer if an application is denied. As the price hike technically went into effect on Friday, it’s also unclear if visa petitions currently under review are subject to it.</p>\n<p>“This is forcing us to pause, hopefully temporarily, numerous H-1B petitions for aspiring founders,” she said. “We’re waiting for more guidance.” </p>\n<h2 id=\"h-this-makes-me-kind-of-sad\">“This makes me kind of sad”</h2>\n<p>Silicon Valley founders say they look worldwide because there is a <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/09/24/billionaire-vc-mike-moritz-slams-new-h-1b-visa-fee-as-brutish-extortion-scheme/\">shortage of technical talent in the U.S.</a>, especially for skills like AI engineering. </p>\n<p>Brian Sathianathan, co-founder and CTO of the AI company Iterate, has a handful of employees on the visa and credits the visa for his previous successful startup exit.</p>\n<p>“My last company I co-founded and sold, my co-founder was on an H-1B visa. My head of engineering was on an H-1B visa,” Sathianathan said. With such high fees for the visa application, that “would not have been possible.” </p>\n<p>Other founders warn that the fee sends a signal that foreign talent might not be welcomed.  </p>\n<figure><blockquote><p>The impact will be severe on the competitiveness and innovation of smaller startups compared to the hyperscales, the big businesses.</p></blockquote></figure>\n<p>Hemant Mohapatra, an India-based partner at Lightspeed Venture Partners, was on an H-1B for around 15 years. He said expensive barriers for tech-worker visas could leave <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/0f84298c-4d27-4f23-80d4-2bce6a4c9282\">an innovation gap in the U.S. startup ecosystem</a> because a large percentage of unicorns and decacorns are actually founded by immigrants.</p>\n<p>Many times, he said, people brought to the U.S. on an H-1B visa later go on to start their own U.S. companies. Sometimes, their children grow up to be founders, too.</p>\n<p>That’s the experience of Jeffrey Wang, the co-founder of AI company Exa.ai. While a few of his workers obtained H-1B visas from a previous employer, Wang’s parents immigrated to the U.S. as H-1B recipients.</p>\n<p>“I heard the news and was like this makes me kind of sad,” he told TechCrunch. “I feel like people like my parents wouldn’t be able to come to America anymore.” </p>\n<p>The Trump administration said the visa change was to protect national interests, but Wang believes bringing the best talent to the U.S. helps with the nation’s security. As a nation of immigrants, nearly every important engineering or scientific achievement in the U.S. has involved immigrants, he said. </p>\n<h2 id=\"h-startups-explore-their-options\">Startups explore their options</h2>\n<p>U.S. startups are now scrambling. Some want exceptions carved out for startups. The administration said exemptions were possible in cases of national interest. </p>\n<p>Meanwhile, visa consultation company Cesium told TechCrunch it’s seen a more than 50% increase in early-stage founders looking at O-1 visas (though spouses can’t work on this visa). Later-stage companies are looking at the EB-1A visa, typically given to those at the top of their fields, and spouses are permitted to work. </p>\n<figure><blockquote><p>I feel like people like my parents wouldn’t be able to come to America anymore.</p></blockquote></figure>\n<blockquote>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Jack Thorogood, the CEO and founder of payroll company Native Teams, said his company has tracked a 50% increase in U.S. companies exploring visa-free global hiring options, like international remote work.</p>\n<p>Native Teams, which works with over 3,000 companies in 85 countries, said that one H-1B hire will now equal up to 20 remote hires in many other countries. </p>\n<p>He believes U.S. startups will just start outsourcing talent or keeping their workers abroad. “It wouldn’t be any more expensive to have talent overseas anyway,” Thorogood said. </p>\n<p>Markets like Canada, Germany, and the U.K. are already burgeoning tech hubs serving as landing spots for companies opening international offices. </p>\n<p>“If the U.S. is raising barriers, the U.K. and others should adapt accordingly to harness the amazing talent that exists from all corners of the world,” Oliver Kent-Braham, CEO and co-founder of the U.K.-based unicorn Marshmallow, told TechCrunch. </p>\n<p>Canadian Daniel Wigdor, founder of an AI venture studio and professor at the University of Toronto, agreed that the visa fee change wasn’t a good step for the U.S.</p>\n<p>“Instead of competing for the world’s best, they’re testing how much companies will pay to import them,” he said. “That stance might play domestically, but it risks undercutting America’s global tech dominance.”</p>\n<p><em>This piece was updated to reflect the proper title of Daniel Wigdor. </em></p>\n</div>"

Amazon is also required to stop its “unlawful enrollment and cancellation practices.”</p>\n<p>The suit, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2023/06/21/ftc-sues-amazon-over-deceptive-tactics-used-to-sign-up-customers-for-prime/\">filed in June 2023</a> under the Biden administration, claimed that Amazon created confusing and deceptive user interfaces to lead consumers to enroll in Prime without their knowledge. It also created a complex process for consumers looking to cancel their subscription by making them go through unnecessary steps, the FTC alleged.</p>\n<p>The settlement comes as Amazon and the FTC had just begun the trial this week, during which a jury was supposed to decide the outcome.</p>\n<p>“The evidence showed that Amazon used sophisticated subscription traps designed to manipulate consumers into enrolling in Prime, and then made it exceedingly hard for consumers to end their subscription,” said FTC Chairman Andrew N. Ferguson in a press release. “Today, we are putting billions of dollars back into Americans’ pockets, and making sure Amazon never does this again.”</p>\n<p>As part of the settlement, Amazon is required to include a clear button for customers to decline signing up for Prime. This means that the company can no longer have a button that says “No, I don’t want free shipping.”</p>\n<p>Amazon must also clearly disclose the subscription cost during the enrollment process, along with the billing date and frequency, whether the subscription auto-renews, and the procedure for cancellation. Additionally, the company is required to create an easy way for consumers to cancel Prime, using the same method that consumers used to sign up for the service.</p>\n<div>\n\t\t<p>Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t<p><span>San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>October 27-29, 2025</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n<p>“Amazon and our executives have always followed the law and this settlement allows us to move forward and focus on innovating for customers,” Amazon said in a statement. “We work incredibly hard to make it clear and simple for customers to both sign up or cancel their Prime membership, and to offer substantial value for our many millions of loyal Prime members around the world. We will continue to do so, and look forward to what we’ll deliver for Prime members in the coming years.”</p>\n<p>The settlement is one of the largest in the FTC’s history.

    "body": "<div>\n<p>OpenAI is launching a new feature inside of ChatGPT called Pulse, which generates personalized reports for users while they sleep. Pulse offers users five to 10 briefs that can get them up to speed on their day and is aimed at encouraging users to check ChatGPT first thing in the morning — much like they would check social media or a news app.</p>\n<p>Pulse is part of a broader shift in OpenAI’s consumer products, which are lately being designed to work for users asynchronously instead of responding to questions. Features like ChatGPT Agent or <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/05/16/openai-launches-codex-an-ai-coding-agent-in-chatgpt/\">Codex</a> aim to make ChatGPT feel more like an assistant rather than a chatbot. With Pulse, OpenAI seemingly wants ChatGPT to be more proactive.</p>\n<p>“We’re building AI that lets us take the level of support that only the wealthiest have been able to afford and make it available to everyone over time,” said OpenAI’s new CEO of Applications, Fidji Simo, in a blog post. “And ChatGPT Pulse is the first step in that direction — starting with Pro users today, but with the goal of rolling out this intelligence to all.”</p>\n<p>OpenAI CEO Sam Altman <a href=\"https://x.com/sama/status/1969835407421374910\" target=\"_blank\">said</a> earlier this week that some of ChatGPT’s new “compute-intensive” products would be limited to the company’s most expensive subscription plan — which is the case for Pulse. OpenAI has previously said it’s <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/02/27/openai-ceo-sam-altman-says-the-company-is-out-of-gpus/\">severely limited</a> in the number of servers it has to power ChatGPT, and it’s rapidly building out <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/09/23/openai-is-building-five-new-stargate-data-centers-with-oracle-and-softbank/\">AI data centers</a> with partners like Oracle and SoftBank to increase its capacity.</p>\n<p>Starting Thursday, OpenAI will roll out Pulse for subscribers to its $200-a-month Pro plan, for whom it will appear as a new tab in the ChatGPT app. The company says it would like to launch Pulse to all ChatGPT users in the future, with Plus subscribers to get access soon, but it first needs to make the product more efficient.</p>\n<p>Pulse’s reports can be roundups of news articles on a specific topic — like updates on a specific sports team — as well as more personalized briefs based on a user’s context.</p>\n<p>In a demo for TechCrunch, OpenAI product lead Adam Fry showed several reports Pulse had made for him: a roundup of news about British soccer team Arsenal; group Halloween costume suggestions for his wife and kids; and a toddler-friendly travel itinerary for his family’s upcoming trip to Sedona, Arizona.</p>\n<div>\n\t\t<p>Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t<p><span>San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>October 27-29, 2025</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n<figure><img src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/ChatGPT-Pulse-examples.png?w=680\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/ChatGPT-Pulse-examples.png 1452w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/ChatGPT-Pulse-examples.png?resize=150,44 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/ChatGPT-Pulse-examples.png?resize=300,88 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/ChatGPT-Pulse-examples.png?resize=768,225 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/ChatGPT-Pulse-examples.png?resize=680,200 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/ChatGPT-Pulse-examples.png?resize=1200,352 1200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/ChatGPT-Pulse-examples.png?resize=1280,376 1280w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/ChatGPT-Pulse-examples.png?resize=430,126 430w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/ChatGPT-Pulse-examples.png?resize=720,211 720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/ChatGPT-Pulse-examples.png?resize=900,264 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/ChatGPT-Pulse-examples.png?resize=800,235 800w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/ChatGPT-Pulse-examples.png?resize=668,196 668w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/ChatGPT-Pulse-examples.png?resize=1440,422 1440w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/ChatGPT-Pulse-examples.png?resize=708,208 708w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/ChatGPT-Pulse-examples.png?resize=50,15 50w\" /><figcaption><span>An example of Pulse’s cards and reports.</span><span><strong>Image Credits:</strong>OpenAI</span></figcaption></figure>\n<p>Each report is displayed as a “card” featuring AI-generated images and text. Users can click on each one to get the full report and can then query ChatGPT about the contents. Pulse will proactively generate some reports, but users can also ask Pulse for new automated reports or offer feedback on existing ones.</p>\n<p>A core part of Pulse is that it stops after generating a few reports and shows a message: “Great, that’s it for today.” According to Fry, that’s an intentional design choice to make the service different from engagement-optimized social media apps. </p>\n<p>Pulse is compatible with <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/06/04/chatgpt-introduces-meeting-recording-and-connectors-for-google-drive-box-and-more/\">ChatGPT’s Connectors</a>, so users can connect apps like Google Calendar and Gmail. Once that’s set up, Pulse will parse through your email overnight to surface the most important messages in the morning, or access your calendar to generate an agenda for upcoming events.</p>\n<p>If users have ChatGPT’s <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/04/18/chatgpt-will-now-use-its-memory-to-personalize-web-searches/\">memory features</a> turned on, Pulse will also pull in context from previous chats to improve your reports. OpenAI’s personalization lead, Christina Wadsworth Kaplan, gave an example of how Pulse automatically picked up on her love of running to create an itinerary for her upcoming trip to London that included running routes.</p>\n<p>Wadsworth Kaplan described Pulse as a “net-new functionality” for a consumer product. As a pescatarian, she says Pulse takes dinner reservations on her calendar and finds menu items that work with her diet.</p>\n<p>But it’s hard to overlook how Pulse could compete with existing news products, such as Apple News, paid newsletters, or traditional journalism outlets. Fry doesn’t expect Pulse to replace the various news apps people use, and the feature cites its sources with links in the same way ChatGPT Search does.</p>\n<p>It remains to be seen if Pulse is worth the computational power it requires to work. Fry says the service can “vary tremendously” in how much computing power it spends on a given task — for some projects, it’s fairly efficient, but others may require searching the web and synthesizing lots of documents.</p>\n<p>Eventually, OpenAI would like to make Pulse more agentic, to the point where it could make restaurant reservations on a user’s behalf, or draft emails that users could approve to be sent. But such features may be a long way out and would likely require OpenAI’s agentic models to improve a great deal before users would trust it with such decisions.</p>\n</div><div>\n<div>\n\t\t<p>Maxwell Zeff is a senior reporter at TechCrunch specializing in AI.

    "body": "<div>\n<p>OpenAI released a new <a href=\"https://openai.com/index/gdpval-v0\" target=\"_blank\">benchmark</a> on Thursday that tests how its AI models perform compared to human professionals across a wide range of industries and jobs. The test, GDPval, is an early attempt at understanding how close OpenAI’s systems are to outperforming humans at economically valuable work — a key part of the company’s founding mission to develop artificial general intelligence, or AGI.</p>\n<p>OpenAI says its found that its GPT-5 model and Anthropic’s Claude Opus 4.1 “are already approaching the quality of work produced by industry experts.” </p>\n<p>That’s not to say that OpenAI’s models are going to start replacing humans in their jobs immediately. Despite predictions by some CEOs that <a href=\"https://www.axios.com/2025/05/28/ai-jobs-white-collar-unemployment-anthropic\" target=\"_blank\">AI will take the jobs of humans in just a few years,</a> OpenAI admits that GDPval today covers a very limited number of tasks people do in their real jobs. However, it is one of the latest ways the company is measuring AI’s progress toward this milestone.</p>\n<p>GDPval is based on nine industries that contribute the most to America’s gross domestic product, including domains such as healthcare, finance, manufacturing, and government. The benchmark tests an AI model’s performance in 44 occupations among those industries, ranging from software engineers to nurses to journalists.</p>\n<p>For OpenAI’s first version of the test, GDPval-v0, OpenAI asked experienced professionals to compare AI-generated reports with those produced by other professionals, and then choose the best one. For example, one prompt asked investment bankers to create a competitor landscape for the last-mile delivery industry and compare them to AI-generated reports. OpenAI then averages an AI model’s “win rate” against the human reports across all 44 occupations.</p>\n<p>For GPT-5-high, a souped-up version of GPT-5 with extra computational power, the company says the AI model was ranked as better than or on par with industry experts 40.6% of the time.</p>\n<p>OpenAI also tested Anthropic’s Claude Opus 4.1 model, which was ranked as better than or on par with industry experts in 49% of tasks. OpenAI says that it believes Claude scored so high because of its tendency to make pleasing graphics, rather than sheer performance.</p>\n<div>\n\t\t<p>Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t<p><span>San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>October 27-29, 2025</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n<figure><img src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Screenshot-2025-09-25-at-9.10.47AM.png?w=680\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Screenshot-2025-09-25-at-9.10.47AM.png 1380w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Screenshot-2025-09-25-at-9.10.47AM.png?resize=150,109 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Screenshot-2025-09-25-at-9.10.47AM.png?resize=300,217 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Screenshot-2025-09-25-at-9.10.47AM.png?resize=768,557 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Screenshot-2025-09-25-at-9.10.47AM.png?resize=680,493 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Screenshot-2025-09-25-at-9.10.47AM.png?resize=1200,870 1200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Screenshot-2025-09-25-at-9.10.47AM.png?resize=1280,928 1280w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Screenshot-2025-09-25-at-9.10.47AM.png?resize=430,312 430w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Screenshot-2025-09-25-at-9.10.47AM.png?resize=720,522 720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Screenshot-2025-09-25-at-9.10.47AM.png?resize=900,652 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Screenshot-2025-09-25-at-9.10.47AM.png?resize=800,580 800w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Screenshot-2025-09-25-at-9.10.47AM.png?resize=668,484 668w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Screenshot-2025-09-25-at-9.10.47AM.png?resize=518,375 518w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Screenshot-2025-09-25-at-9.10.47AM.png?resize=851,617 851w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Screenshot-2025-09-25-at-9.10.47AM.png?resize=708,513 708w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Screenshot-2025-09-25-at-9.10.47AM.png?resize=50,36 50w\" /><figcaption><span><strong>Image Credits:</strong>OpenAI</span></figcaption></figure>\n<p>It’s worth noting that most working professionals do a lot more than submit research reports to their boss, which is all that GDPval-v0 tests for. OpenAI acknowledges this and says it plans to create more robust tests in the future that can account for more industries and interactive workflows.</p>\n<p>Nonetheless, the company sees the progress on GDPval as notable.</p>\n<p>In an interview with TechCrunch, OpenAI’s chief economist Dr. Aaron Chatterji said GDPval’s results suggest that people in these jobs can now use AI models to spend time on more meaningful tasks.</p>\n<p>“[Because] the model is getting good at some of these things,” Chatterji says, “people in those jobs can now use the model, increasingly as capabilities get better, to offload some of their work and do potentially higher value things.”</p>\n<p>OpenAI’s evaluations lead Tejal Patwardhan tells TechCrunch that she’s encouraged by the rate of progress on GDPval. OpenAI’s GPT-4o model scored just 13.7% (wins and ties versus humans), which was released roughly 15 months ago. Now GPT-5 scores nearly triple that, a trend Patwardhan expects to continue.</p>\n<p>Silicon Valley has a wide range of benchmarks it uses to measure the progress of AI models and assess whether a given model is state-of-the-art. Among the most popular are AIME 2025 (a test of competitive math problems) and GPQA Diamond (a test of PhD-level science questions). However, several AI models are <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/08/07/openais-gpt-5-is-here/\">nearing saturation</a> on some of these benchmarks, and many AI researchers have cited the need for <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/03/19/the-ai-leaders-bringing-the-agi-debate-down-to-earth/\">better tests</a> that can measure AI’s proficiency on real-world tasks.</p>\n<p>Benchmarks like GDPval could become increasingly important in that conversation, as OpenAI makes the case that its AI models are valuable for a wide range of industries. But OpenAI may need a more comprehensive version of the test to definitively say its AI models can outperform humans.</p>\n</div><div>\n<div>\n\t\t<p>Maxwell Zeff is a senior reporter at TechCrunch specializing in AI.

    "body": "<div>\n<p>Elon Musk’s xAI has reached an agreement with the U.S. government’s purchasing arm to sell its AI chatbot Grok to the federal government for under a dollar, pitting it against OpenAI and Anthropic. </p>\n<p>Under the agreement between xAI and the General Services Administration (GSA), federal agencies will be charged 42 cents to use xAI’s chatbot Grok for a year and a half. <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/08/06/openai-is-practically-giving-chatgpt-to-the-government-for-free/\" target=\"_blank\">OpenAI</a> and <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/08/12/anthropic-takes-aim-at-openai-offers-claude-to-all-three-branches-of-government-for-1/\" target=\"_blank\">Anthropic</a> are offering their enterprise and government versions of ChatGPT and Claude, respectively, for $1 for a year.  </p>\n<p>The steep discount for federal agencies includes access to xAI engineers to help integrate the technology.</p>\n<p>The price point is either part of a running joke Musk has of using variations of 420, a marijuana reference, or a nod to one of Musk’s favorite books, “The Hitchhiker’s Guide to the Galaxy,” which references the number 42 as the answer to the meaning of life and the universe.  </p>\n<p>Earlier this year, xAI had been close to being approved as a GSA vendor, but after Grok began generating antisemitic posts and calling itself “MechaHitler” on X, the planned partnership reportedly fell through. In late August, internal emails <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/story/white-house-elon-musk-xai-grok/\" target=\"_blank\">obtained by Wired</a> revealed the White House had instructed the GSA to add xAI’s Grok to the approved vendor list “ASAP.” </p>\n<p>The company was also one of several AI firms, including Anthropic, Google, and OpenAI, to be selected for a $200 million contract with the Pentagon. </p>\n<p>After President Donald Trump’s inauguration, Musk formed and led the Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE, in a rampant cost-cutting spree that has seen mixed results. During that time, <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/05/20/the-people-in-elon-musk-doge-universe/\" target=\"_blank\">Musk placed several aides at the GSA</a> and other government agencies responsible for regulating or awarding government contracts in industries in which Musk has business.</p>\n<div>\n\t\t<p>Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t<p><span>San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>October 27-29, 2025</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div><div>\n<div>\n\t\t<p>Rebecca Bellan is a senior reporter at TechCrunch where she covers the business, policy, and emerging trends shaping artificial intelligence.
