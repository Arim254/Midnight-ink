The new data centers will bring Stargate’s planned capacity to 7 gigawatts — enough energy to power more than 5 million homes.</p>\n<p>Three of the new sites are being developed with Oracle. They’re located in Shackelford County, Texas; Doña Ana County, New Mexico; and an undisclosed location in the Midwest. The other two sites are being developed with SoftBank, with one in Lordstown, Ohio, and the other in Milam County, Texas.</p>\n<p>The new Stargate AI data centers are part of OpenAI’s massive infrastructure buildout, as the company works to train and serve more powerful AI models. On Monday, OpenAI said it would receive a <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/09/22/nvidia-plans-to-invest-up-to-100b-in-openai/\">$100 billion investment from Nvidia</a> to buy the chipmaker’s AI processors and build out even more AI data centers.</p>\n</div>"

If you’re not sure where to start to make improvements, you can also use one of the provided Gemini suggestions or simply tell the AI to “make it better.” </p>\n<p>The feature supports the usual types of edits, like lighting adjustments or removing distractions from the images, as well as more advanced edits, like removing objects in the background or restoring an old image. Plus, it can change photos to have fantastical AI elements added, for a bit of creativity. </p>\n<p>As you continue to edit, Gemini will support follow-up requests to help you fine-tune your work further. </p>\n<p>AI editing is currently <a href=\"https://support.google.com/photos/answer/15318661?hl=en&co=GENIE.Platform%3DAndroid\" target=\"_blank\">available</a> to users 18 and up in the U.S. in English.</p>\n<div>\n\t\t<p>Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t<p><span>San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>October 27-29, 2025</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n<p>The AI feature was announced alongside support for <a href=\"https://contentcredentials.org/\" target=\"_blank\">C2PA Content Credentials</a> in Google Photos, which identifies when images were created with AI.

During that August rollout, Google also introduced <a href=\"https://blog.google/products/search/ai-mode-agentic-personalized/\" target=\"_blank\">advanced AI capabilities</a> to its Google AI Ultra subscribers, allowing them to request restaurant reservations in AI Mode. The company plans to introduce support for other types of appointments and event ticket purchases in the future.</p>\n<p>Google has been rapidly rolling out AI across its products and services, often with multiple product announcements occurring simultaneously. For instance, the company announced Tuesday that it was bringing <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/09/23/google-photos-users-on-android-can-now-edit-their-photos-by-talking-to-or-texting-the-ai/\">conversational photo editing to all Android users </a>in the U.S. It also announced the same day that its more affordable Google AI Plus subscription plan, first introduced in Indonesia, is now arriving in 40 more countries.

Users get 10 times higher usage limits than the free plan for sending questions or prompts, generating images, and uploading files. According to OpenAI, the plan also allows ChatGPT to remember previous conversations better, enabling more personalized responses over time.</p>\n<p>Google <a href=\"https://blog.google/products/search/ai-mode-expands-more-languages/\" target=\"_blank\">announced</a> earlier this month that AI Mode also now supports Hindi, Indonesian, Japanese, Korean, and Brazilian Portuguese.</p>\n<p>With so many products, users may find it hard to distinguish between different features and functionality, like the difference between Google’s AI Mode and its AI Overviews.

    "body": "<div>\n<p>Just south of Seoul, in the city of Seongnam, sits what many call the “Silicon Valley of South Korea”: the sprawling tech complex known as Pangyo Techno Valley (PTV), which is just a 15-minute subway ride from Gangnam, better known for its luxury boutiques, K-pop agencies, and neon nightlife in Seoul. </p>\n<p>Since launching in 2011, the 661,000-square-meter development has evolved into one of the country’s most significant innovation hubs. It’s home to more than 1,800 startups, research centers, and global tech firms, all packed into a district that feels more like a laboratory for South Korea’s future than a suburb of Seoul.</p>\n<p>Big names are everywhere in Pangyo Techno Valley, including Naver, often described as Korea’s Google, and Kakao, the country’s everything-app. Gaming powerhouses Nexon and NCSoft anchor the district alongside industrial heavyweights like shipbuilder HD Hyundai and cybersecurity pioneer AhnLab. Samsung Electronics, semiconductor giant SK Hynix, and Hyundai’s autonomous vehicle division 42dot all maintain significant presences. Yet despite this concentration of tech talent and capital, industry insiders question whether Pangyo truly deserves its Silicon Valley comparison.</p>\n<p>“Pangyo is absolutely Korea’s most concentrated hub for software, gaming, platforms, and AI,” says Hyoungchul Choi, CEO of Portologics, who founded his company there five years ago. But he’s skeptical of the Silicon Valley label. “The nickname is convenient, but we shouldn’t overstate our global influence. Silicon Valley isn’t just about density—it’s built on decades of international capital flows, risk-taking culture, and its ability to attract talent worldwide. We’re not there yet.”</p>\n<p>The statistics back up this more modest assessment. As of a year ago, Pangyo Techno Valley was predominantly home to smaller players, with approximately 91.5% of its companies being small and mid-size businesses, with big tech accounting for just 3.6% and the remaining 4.9% made up of public or government organizations, according to PTV’s  <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.pangyotechnovalley.org/base/board/read?boardManagementNo=19&boardNo=2728&menuLevel=2&menuNo=58\">official website</a>.</p>\n<p>Janice Sa, a principal at Z Venture Capital, who has been working in Pangyo for more than a decade, sees the district’s influence waning.</p>\n<p>“With giants like Kakao, Naver, Nexon, and NCSoft all in one place,” the PTV’s title of Korea’s Silicon Valley “still makes sense,” she says. But compared to ten years ago, the district doesn’t feel quite as dominant as the country’s go-to tech hub, Sa said. “Back then, startups were flocking to Pangyo. Today, many are heading back to Gangnam [in Seoul].” The reasons, she added, boil down to talent and capital. “Young developers and engineers still gravitate toward Gangnam, and most venture capital firms are packed along Teheran Street, the city’s main tech corridor lined with startups, big tech offices, and investors. For hiring and fundraising, that makes Gangnam the easier choice.”</p>\n<div>\n\t\t<p>Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t<p><span>San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>October 27-29, 2025</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n<p>That exodus reflects a broader challenge. For big corporations tied to long-term leases with tax incentives, being in Pangyo isn’t much of an issue, Sa noted. But for startups competing for talent, the location can be a greater challenge. Pangyo might be only a short ride from Gangnam, but it’s still in Gyeonggi Province, not Seoul. And because government support programs are often tied to local jurisdictions, Seoul ends up with more active startup infrastructure and stronger global initiatives.</p>\n<p>An insider at a Pangyo-based tech firm, who asked not to be named, shared a similar perspective. With so many tech companies in one place, Pangyo has developed a culture that feels naturally geared toward the industry. “When you’re working in tech here, collaboration comes easier—everyone’s just around the corner,” he said. But Seoul is “more diverse. For example, Yeouido is Korea’s Wall Street, perfect for fintechs, while Gangnam draws startups of every kind.”</p>\n<p>The bigger question is whether Korean startups, regardless of location, can compete globally. Both government and private investors are pushing companies to expand internationally as the domestic market saturates. Yet breakthrough success stories remain elusive.</p>\n<p>A Kakao Ventures investor highlights cultural differences that may explain the gap. “American startups tend to succeed — and fail — much faster, which fuels constant experimentation and a high rate of talent movement. Speed is a startup’s greatest strength, so I try to have open conversations with founders about how to turn failure into opportunity,” the investor said.</p>\n<p>Storytelling is another challenge, says this investor. “Many Korean founders are sharp on numbers and strategy, but stumble on a simpler question: What’s your story? Business is still about people connecting with people. Without a clear, authentic narrative of why you and your team are the right ones, it’s hard to stand out. And because so many already bring strong skills to the table, that personal story becomes even more important,” this person said.</p>\n<p>Choi sees reason for optimism despite the challenges. The scene blends the grit of scrappy founders with the steady influence of big Korean tech companies, where stability and benefits still matter. “Unlike in the U.S., where founders often leap into risk and pivot fast, startups here tend to balance ambition with discipline—building proof at home before going abroad. The outcome is dependable engineering, but without the same ‘move fast, break things’ energy that defines Silicon Valley.”</p>\n<p>Pangyo is also moving beyond gaming and platforms into AI, biotech, and deep tech, with governments investing in startup campuses and scaling programs, Choi observed. </p>\n<p>The real test now is less about local growth and more about proving global success—unicorns, cross-border exits, and steady inflows of talent, he said.</p>\n<p>“What holds Korean startups back from going global? Three key factors are the home market is small size, weaker global investor ties, and language or regulatory hurdles that create additional friction. Breaking through takes more than ambition; it needs early global partners, deliberate go-to-market resources, and leaders who think cross-border from day one,” Choi said. </p>\n<p>Yet a fourth factor — their ability to tell compelling stories to the world — may also prove to be the biggest difference between remaining a regional tech hub and becoming a true global innovation center.</p>\n</div>"

    "body": "<div>\n<p>SpaceX boasts an impressive alumni list. Some have gone on to found the sector’s biggest startups; others become astronauts.</p>\n<p>NASA unveiled its 2025 astronaut class this week, and two familiar names popped out: Anna Menon and Yuri Kubo. Both spent more than a decade at SpaceX, where they played critical roles in the company’s rise to the behemoth it is today.</p>\n<p>Menon joined SpaceX in 2018 after a career at NASA in the Mission Control Center, where she provided biomedical support for astronauts. As a senior engineer at SpaceX, she worked on private astronaut missions and flew as a mission specialist and medical officer aboard the Polaris Dawn private astronaut mission. That mission broke several records, including performing the first commercial spacewalk.  </p>\n<p>Kubo, meanwhile, spent 12 years at SpaceX as a Falcon 9 launch director and in senior roles overseeing the Starshield program and ground systems.  </p>\n<p>These 10 astronauts were chosen out of more than 8,000 applicants. Training is rigorous: The group will spend nearly two years learning the ropes before becoming eligible for assignments on the International Space Station and beyond. The training curriculum includes lessons in robotics, geology, foreign languages, space medicine, and more, alongside conducting simulated spacewalks and flight training, NASA said.</p>\n<p>If they pass training, this group will join the group of over 40 active astronauts, and may be part of the cohort that helps NASA transition to commercial private space stations upon the retirement of the ISS in 2030. This group will also be eligible for future science missions to the moon and Mars.</p>\n<p>This is not the first time SpaceX alumni have made the leap to government astronaut corps. Robb Kulin, former director of flight reliability at SpaceX, joined NASA’s 2017 class as a candidate. In 2021, Anil Menon — SpaceX’s first flight surgeon and medical director — was elected to be part of the Artemis generation of astronauts. (Anil and Anna are married.)</p>\n<div>\n\t\t<p>Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t<p><span>San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>October 27-29, 2025</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n<p>The trend underscores how the world’s most influential private space company is increasingly intertwined with bona fide astronaut work — not only supporting private missions like the Polaris program, but also producing astronauts themselves.  </p>\n<p>For decades, NASA astronauts mostly came from the military and academia. The commercial sector played little role in producing astronaut candidates. But SpaceX has changed that. The company has become a training ground for engineers and mission operators working on human spaceflight.</p>\n</div><div>\n<div>\n\t\t<p>Aria Alamalhodaei covers the space and defense industries at TechCrunch.

This year, <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/vibe-coding-startup-vibecode-helps-build-apps-on-iphone-fundraise-2025-8\" target=\"_blank\">a startup called Vibecode launched with $9.4 million in seed funding</a> from Reddit co-founder Alexis Ohanian’s Seven Seven Six. The company’s service allows users to create mobile apps using AI within its own iOS app. Vibecode is so new, Appfigures doesn’t yet have data on it.</p>\n<p>For now, most people who want to toy around with vibe-coding technology are doing so on the desktop. But vibe coding does have another presence on mobile devices: It’s powering a growing number of existing mobile apps.</p>\n<p>For instance, the subscription platform provider <a href=\"http://revenuecat.com/\" target=\"_blank\">RevenueCat</a>, now used by over 50,000 apps, reports that it powers the in-app purchases for over 50% of all AI-built iOS apps currently on the market.</p>\n<p>The company told TechCrunch that the share of apps that came to RevenueCat for monetization from an AI assistant or platform — meaning an AI chatbot referred its service to the customer — surged to over 35% of all new sign-ups in the second quarter of this year, up from below 5% in the second quarter of last year.</p>\n<p>The platform, which is already used by nearly 50% of all mobile apps that take payments, notes that vibe coders are using its service to automatically configure their subscriptions with Cursor, Claude Code, and others, via its RevenueCat MCP server, allowing them to quickly create subscriptions and test plans and features.</p>\n<p>Although there’s certainly interest in vibe coding, the consensus is that it’s not ready for prime time. </p>\n<p>TechCrunch recently spoke with <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/09/14/vibe-coding-has-turned-senior-devs-into-ai-babysitters-but-they-say-its-worth-it/\">developers working with AI-generated code</a>, who said the technology still has a long way to go. A separate <a href=\"https://www.fastly.com/blog/senior-developers-ship-more-ai-code\" target=\"_blank\">survey from Fastly</a> found that roughly 95% of the nearly 800 developers surveyed said they had to spend extra time fixing AI-generated code.</p>\n<p>Still, user demand is there. A <a href=\"https://survey.stackoverflow.co/2025/ai\" target=\"_blank\">2025 survey</a> by Stack Overflow found that 84% of respondents are using or planning to use AI tools in their development process, up from 76% last year. Another <a href=\"https://www.theinformation.com/articles/information-survey-nearly-75-respondents-vibe-coding-like-results\" target=\"_blank\">survey</a> conducted this summer by the tech media site The Information found that 75% of respondents were at least trying vibe coding. A May 2025 study by the software intelligence platform Jellyfish found that 90% had integrated AI into their work, up from 61% last year, as reported by <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/vibe-coding-limits-use-cases-software-companies-airtable-redis-2025-7\" target=\"_blank\">Business Insider</a>.</p>\n</div><div>\n<div><p>\n\t\tSarah has worked as a reporter for TechCrunch since August 2011.

Eventually, the plume visualizations will be available worldwide, Gore said.</p>\n<div>\n\t\t<p>Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t<p><span>San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>October 27-29, 2025</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n<p>People have intuitively known about the ill effects of soot for years, but it was only recently that Climate Trace and its partners at Carnegie Mellon University were able to wrangle global data on the issue into something that was both sensible and defensible. </p>\n<p>“The very idea of tracking 662 million sites around the world, I mean without AI, people couldn’t have imagined doing something like that,” he said. “But of course, as we’ve all seen in the last couple of years, AI can do stuff that is quite extraordinary.”</p>\n<p>Scientists have only recently come to appreciate the wide-ranging health effects of fine particulate pollution. Though researchers have long known about its role in lung cancer and heart disease, for example, in the last decade or so they’ve shown that exposure to PM2.5 can increase the risk a range of other deadly ailments, including <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2797628\">low birth weight</a>, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2755672\">kidney disease</a>, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lanplh/article/PIIS2542-5196(20)30227-8/fulltext\">Parkinson’s</a>, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lanplh/article/PIIS2542-5196(20)30227-8/fulltext\">Alzheimer’s</a>, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-025-02844-9\">dementia</a>, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2755672\">type 2 diabetes</a>, and <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9329703/\">more</a>. Even at legal levels, fine particulate pollution causes <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2022/01/particulate-pollution-is-killing-older-americans-even-at-legal-levels/\">tens of thousands of excess deaths</a> in the U.S. annually.</p>\n<p>Much of the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S001393510580009X\">early work</a> into the health impacts of PM2.5 was pioneered by <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://hsph.harvard.edu/profile/joel-schwartz/\">Joel Schwartz</a>, the scientist who’s research decades ago led to the ban on leaded gasoline. Gore hopes greater awareness of fossil fuels’ health effects will spur broader action, similar to what happened with leaded gasoline. </p>\n<p>“I think that it creates a set of conditions and incentives that could very well make it more likely that we can accelerate the transition away from carbon-intensive facilities,” he said. “It makes it more likely to build political support for the conversion of these facilities to much less emitting technologies.”</p>\n</div><div>\n<div>\n\t\t<p>Tim De Chant is a senior climate reporter at TechCrunch.
