Following a period of rapid growth in the 2010s and during the pandemic, Schreier said gamers in recent years have “tended to stick with old favorites rather than purchasing new titles.”</p>\n<p>This seems to be reflected in EA’s fiscal year 2025, with 75% of revenue coming from live services rather than new purchases. In fact, analyst and Spilt Milk Studios co-founder Nicholas Lovell told Schreier, “We’re moving away from an era of breaking new ideas to people settling into the same games, spending money over and over again.”</p>\n<p>So Lovell suggested that EA executives might see the reported $50 billion price tag as the company’s “peak valuation,” as the industry enters a period where profits continue rising but valuations start to fall.</p>\n</div>"

    "body": "<div>\n<p>Automotive giant Honda and lunar startup Astrobotic are teaming up to explore how a regenerative fuel cell system could help keep the lights on during long nights on the Moon.</p>\n<p>The companies on Monday partnered up to study whether Honda’s regenerative fuel cell (RFC) can be integrated into Astrobotic’s LunaGrid, a scalable power service built around solar arrays. The two will conduct “illumination studies” at potential lunar south pole landing sites, and evaluate system scalability as well as hardware and software integration.</p>\n<p>A key challenge for lunar exploration is surviving the two-week-long lunar night, when temperatures can plunge to as low as -424 degrees Fahrenheit in some regions, while solar panels sit idle. Honda’s RFC addresses that problem by storing solar power as hydrogen during the lunar day and converting it back into electricity at night, producing water as the only byproduct.</p>\n<p>That water is then recycled into a high-pressure electrolysis system to create more hydrogen, forming what Honda calls “a closed-loop energy cycle.”</p>\n<p>Astrobotic’s’ Vertical Solar Array Technology (VSAT) is designed to track the sun for maximum energy capture, and is planned to have a capacity of up to 10 kilowatts. The company is also developing an XL version, which would generate five times more power.</p>\n<p>Together, VSAT would collect sunlight during the day to power the water electrolysis system, while the RFC would convert that stored hydrogen into electricity through the night.</p>\n<p>The aim is a real moonshot: continuous, reliable power on the lunar surface.</p>\n<div>\n\t\t<p>Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t<p><span>San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>October 27-29, 2025</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n<p>Founded in 2007, Pittsburgh-based Astrobotic is best known for its Peregrine lunar lander, which launched at the beginning of this year but did not complete its mission. The company is also developing power and mobility systems as part of its goal of building out a lunar economy.</p>\n<p>For Honda, the agreement marks a notable step into the space sector. The automaker has long invested in fuel cell R&D, but this is its first public agreement to put that tech to work on the moon.</p>\n<p>The collaboration also aligns with Japan’s broader space ambitions. The country is a founding member of the Artemis Accords, a framework for geopolitical collaboration in lunar exploration, and Japanese astronauts routinely conduct research on the International Space Station.</p>\n<p>The lunar south pole is central to NASA’s Artemis program in part because of the region’s near-continuous exposure to sunlight, and the potential vast stores of water ice there. Power systems like LunarGrid, paired with Honda’s RFC, could open the door to more ambitious future missions, and eventually, a sustained human presence on the Moon.</p>\n</div><div>\n<div>\n\t\t<p>Aria Alamalhodaei covers the space and defense industries at TechCrunch.

    "body": "<div>\n<p>Manny Medina, previously best-known as the founder of sales automation startup Outreach ($4.4 billion valuation), has wowed investors with his young startup, Paid.</p>\n<p>Paid just closed an oversubscribed $21.6 million seed round led by Lightspeed. With the €10 million pre-seed round <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/03/25/outreach-founder-manny-medina-has-a-new-startup-that-helps-ai-agents-get-paid/\">it raised in March</a>, London-based Paid has already raised $33.3 million and hasn’t even hit its Series A yet. A source familiar with the deal says the startup’s valuation is over $100 million.</p>\n<p>Paid came out of stealth in March offering an interesting contribution to the AI agentic world: The company doesn’t offer agents. It offers a way for agent makers to charge their customers for these worker algorithms, based on the value their agents provide. This is a growing theme in AI, sometimes called “results-based billing.”</p>\n<p>Paid promises to help agent makers “start charging for points of margin saved by their customers,” Medina describes. </p>\n<p>It’s a new way of charging for software for the AI age. This is instead of the unlimited use, per-user fees of the SaaS era, or the unlimited use, buy-it-once-and-install-it fees of the client/server era. </p>\n<p>Per-user fees don’t work because agent makers pay usage fees to the model providers as well as to cloud providers. Unlimited use could drive them into the red. (The vibe coding startup world tends to suffer from this issue.) </p>\n<p>Agent providers instead “need to show the value the agent is delivering to your customers, because agents are running in the background for the most part,” Medina tells TechCrunch. If agents do work as advertised, then they’ll be assigned increasingly more, with their growing workloads going unnoticed.</p>\n<div>\n\t\t<p>Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t<p><span>San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>October 27-29, 2025</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n<p>“If you’re a quiet agent, you don’t get paid,” Madina says. “You need an infrastructure that allows the agent to charge for the additional work that the agent is doing,”  </p>\n<p>But charging a monthly fee for a limited number of credits — following the model makers and vibe coders — is risky for agent-makers, too. That’s because companies don’t want to pay for AI slop, which is still what most AI produces. After billions spent on AI pilots, some 95% of enterprise projects were found to have no value, with only 5% put into production, according to <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://mlq.ai/media/quarterly_decks/v0.1_State_of_AI_in_Business_2025_Report.pdf\">a recent study from MIT</a>.</p>\n<p>Companies don’t want to pay agents to produce more emails that no one reads. </p>\n<p>One of the startup’s early customers, for instance, is Artisan, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/04/09/artisan-the-stop-hiring-humans-ai-agent-startup-raises-25m-and-is-still-hiring-humans/\">the viral sales automation startup</a>. (By the way, you can hear Artisan’s CEO Jaspar Carmichael-Jack speak on the topic at <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-disrupt-2025/\">TechCrunch Disrupt</a> next month.) </p>\n<p>But Paid is also starting to see success with SaaS companies looking at agents for their next big growth. The startup just landed ERP vendor IFS as a new customer, it said. </p>\n<p>Lightspeed’s Alexander Schmitt says the venture firm has invested “more than $2.5 billion into AI infrastructure and application layer companies over the last three years,” and has witnessed firsthand that most AI pilots fail.  </p>\n<p>“The core of that problem is that no one can really attach value to what agents are doing today,” Schmitt said.  </p>\n<p>Schmitt thinks that Paid is, so far, unique in its approach, saying “it’s something that we haven’t seen someone else build.” No doubt more competition for agentic results-based billing will come if it really does help agents enter the workforce en mass.</p>\n<p>New investor FUSE and existing investor EQT Ventures also participated in the round. </p>\n</div>"

    "body": "<div>\n<p>Making democracy work isn’t easy, as recent events have made clear. Some critics would argue that technology is making it worse. But one startup is hoping that AI could help bridge some differences instead of widen them.</p>\n<p>“I had an <em>a-ha</em> moment one day when I realized people are asking AI to explain something like they’re five years old,” Tommy Lorsch, co-founder and CEO of <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.complexchaos.ai/\">Complex Chaos</a>, told TechCrunch. “What if we use it as a facilitator to help people understand each other and find common ground?”</p>\n<p>He and co-founder Maya Ben Dror are developing tools to help people arrive at a consensus. One of their first test cases involved <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/09/16/al-gore-on-chinas-climate-rise-i-would-not-have-seen-this-coming/\">climate negotiations</a>, but it really doesn’t matter what the issue is. His goal is to foster cooperation and shorten the time it takes for groups to come to agreement.</p>\n<p>“Everyone is building software for collaboration like Slack, Google Docs, whatever,” Lorsch said. “Cooperation is a different piece.”</p>\n<p>Facilitating cooperation isn’t something that scales well, he said. Typically, trained facilitators will spend time with groups to help them arrive at a consensus, but that process can slow down when negotiations or preparations happen across time zones or even in different rooms.</p>\n<p>Lorsch was buoyed by a recent LLM developed by Google called the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.adq2852\">Habermas Machine</a>, which was developed explicitly with that goal in mind. “This is basically an AI that generates group consensus statements where people feel represented both majority and minority point of view,” he said.</p>\n<p>Lorsch and Ben Dror recently trialed their startup’s tool to help young delegates from nine African nations prepare for climate-related negotiations at a United Nations campus in Bonn, Germany. The tool incorporates both Google’s Habermas Machine and OpenAI’s <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/09/18/chatgpt-everything-to-know-about-the-ai-chatbot/\">ChatGPT</a> to generate questions, come up with goals for conversations, and help summarize long documents.</p>\n<div>\n\t\t<p>Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t<p><span>San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>October 27-29, 2025</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n<p>The goal, Ben Dror said, is to help the delegates arrive at consensus as a bloc before they began negotiations with others. </p>\n<p>Ideally, the tool would help speed things during negotiations, too. When blocs, or delegates fro groups of aligned countries, encounter new information in the process of a large negotiating session, they often need to regroup to process the new information. “Blocs are usually the reason why negotiations have to stop. The bloc has to come out, renegotiate, reposition, and then go back in. And that creates a lot of friction,” Ben Dror said. Complex Chaos hopes that its tool can help shorten that time.</p>\n<p>In the trial with the delegates from African countries, Complex Chaos said that participants reported up to a 60% reduction in the time it took to coordinate, and that 91% of participants said that the AI tool helped them see perspectives they would have otherwise missed.</p>\n<p>Complex Chaos is also pitching its cooperation tool to companies, including tech companies and large consultancies. “Strategic planning by AI and basically the same problem,” Lorsch said. “The annual strategic planning process of most companies takes about three months of the year with back and forth negotiations, multi-layer, across time zones, across teams, and so on and so forth.”</p>\n<p>But Lorsch and Ben Dror are most enthusiastic when talking about climate negotiations. </p>\n<p>“If AI can shorten these processes, simplify them, then we’d be so much better off. Not just for climate, for anything sustainability, for any big challenge that we’re facing,” Ben Dror said.</p>\n</div><div>\n<div>\n\t\t<p>Tim De Chant is a senior climate reporter at TechCrunch.

    "body": "<div>\n<p><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://pola.rs/\">Polars</a>, the Amsterdam-based company behind the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://github.com/pola-rs/polars\">popular open source project of the same name</a>, has raised €18 million (about $21 million) in a Series A round led by Accel, with participation from Bain Capital Partners and angel investors. But while raising this kind of money is the dream of many developers, its creator Ritchie Vink didn’t set out to do so.</p>\n<p>It all started as a pet project during Covid. Frustrated with the limitations of <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pandas_(software)\">Pandas</a>, a tool for organizing and working with data tables, Vink decided to build a better query engine in Rust. Fast-forward five years, and Polars is today widely used by data scientists and teams for its ability to process data <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.ritchievink.com/blog/2021/02/28/i-wrote-one-of-the-fastest-dataframe-libraries/\">much faster</a>.</p>\n<p>This combination of performance and popularity was what caught venture investors’ attention, but the Series A was spurred by Polars’ roadmap for becoming a scalable business. Two years after <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://pola.rs/posts/company-announcement/\">launching as a company</a>, the company in February launched <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://pola.rs/posts/polars-cloud-what-we-are-building/\">Polars Cloud</a>, a managed data platform that lets users run queries in the cloud at scale.</p>\n<p>“In the open-source community, the joke is that you can rewrite anything in Rust and it becomes better,” said Accel partner Zhenya Loginov, who led the funding round. “The reason that it’s a joke is that it is not a real sustainable advantage, and you need to do a lot more.”</p>\n<p>For Viks and his co-founder, former Xomnia CTO Chiel Peters, doing more means building products around the tool, like Polars Cloud and Polars Distributed. The latter is a distributed engine that will support use cases involving petabytes of data, rather than small datasets, and is currently available in public beta. Building the new feature is what most of the funding will go towards, Vink said.</p>\n<p>With Polars Distributed, the startup aims to challenge Apache Spark, whose creators founded Databricks. </p>\n<p>For Polars, going after Pandas’ market share<strong> </strong>was enough to secure a <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://xomnia.com/post/ritchie-vink-writes-polars-one-of-the-fastest-dataframe-libraries-in-python-and-rust/\">$4 million seed round</a> led by Bain Capital in 2023. But Pandas remains open source without a dedicated commercial platform, and even though Polars has surpassed <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://pypistats.org/packages/polars\">24 million downloads</a>, the path to returns would be unclear if it weren’t for Polars Distributed and the ability to scale up from a single machine to a managed cluster.</p>\n<div>\n\t\t<p>Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t<p><span>San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>October 27-29, 2025</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n<p>While Loginov referred to this as a “more interesting” second market, he agreed with Vink that the value of Polars is in closing the scale gap between Pandas and Spark. “If you go into being able to process data sets of any size and complexity, you’re solving a lot of challenges for a lot of enterprises. So we felt that the ultimate market is potentially extremely large,” Loginov said.</p>\n<p>Polars claims the core product is already used in production across finance, life sciences, and logistics. Still, Polars Cloud and Polars Distributed are opening a new chapter for the company. </p>\n<p>For other founders hoping to turn open-source projects into commercial ventures, Loginov points to a key lesson from Vink’s journey. “Polars became successful because it addressed a really big problem — he found a niche where the technology available today is just outdated by a mile. So I would suggest finding a large problem.”</p>\n</div><div>\n<div>\n\t\t<p>Anna Heim is a writer and editorial consultant.</p> \n<p>You can contact or verify outreach from Anna by emailing annatechcrunch [at] gmail.com.</p>\n<p>As a freelance reporter at TechCrunch since 2021, she has covered a large range of startup-related topics including AI, fintech & insurtech, SaaS & pricing, and global venture capital trends.</p>\n<p>As of May 2025, her reporting for TechCrunch focuses on Europe’s most interesting startup stories.</p>\n<p>Anna has moderated panels and conducted onstage interviews at industry events of all sizes, including major tech conferences such as TechCrunch Disrupt, 4YFN, South Summit, TNW Conference, VivaTech, and many more.</p>\n<p>A former LATAM & Media Editor at The Next Web, startup founder and Sciences Po Paris alum, she’s fluent in multiple languages, including French, English, Spanish and Brazilian Portuguese.</p>\t</div>\n\t<p>\n\t\t<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/author/anna-heim/\">View Bio <svg></svg></a>\n\t</p>\n</div>"

    "body": "<div>\n<p>Despite millions spent on financial software, many finance teams still rely on Excel to close their books and reconcile numbers while preparing them for audit. Two former Microsoft executives view it as a problem — and they have started <a href=\"https://www.maximor.ai/\" target=\"_blank\">Maximor</a> to replace spreadsheets with AI agents for the grunt work finance teams perform.</p>\n<p>Excel spreadsheets are everywhere in finance. Even with dedicated ERP, CRM, and billing systems, many mid-sized companies and enterprises still export transactions into Excel for manual reconciliation. Teams often treat spreadsheets as makeshift databases, sometimes even relying on functions like VLOOKUP — a function used to pull matching numbers from one table into another — to line up figures across files. </p>\n<p>Maximor aims to replace finance teams’ reliance on Excel with its AI system, and has emerged from stealth with a $9 million seed round led by Foundation Capital.</p>\n<p>The startup uses a network of AI agents that connect directly to ERP, CRM, and billing systems to continuously pull transactions. That, co-founder and CEO Ramnandan Krishnamurthy (pictured above, right) said in an exclusive interview, helps unify operational and financial data and provide real-time financial visibility — instead of waiting until month-end to sort it all out.</p>\n<p>The approach should help reduce the time needed for the month-end close, he believes. For instance, Maximor says that proptech firm Rently, one of its early customers, cut its closing from eight days to four and avoided two additional accounting hires. Rently was able to redirect nearly half its team’s time to strategic work after using Maximor’s agentic platform, Rently’s CFO Dustin Neel said.</p>\n<p>Maximor’s financial agents plug into ERPs like NetSuite and Intacct, accounting tools such as QuickBooks and Zoho Books, and a range of payroll, CRM, and other SaaS platforms. Once connected, they generate workpapers, reviewer notes, and audit trails — helping streamline audits.</p>\n<p>Although Maximor aims to reduce reliance on Excel, it still allows teams to export reconciled data into spreadsheets — a format that many auditors and finance staff prefer before sending numbers to audit.</p>\n<div>\n\t\t<p>Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t<p><span>San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>October 27-29, 2025</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n<p>“We’re interoperable with Excel on that part, as our platform does the work and can present it in our own UI or in Excel directly,” Krishnamurthy told TechCrunch.</p>\n<p>In addition to its AI agents, Maximor offers human accountants as a human-in-the-loop option for its AI work, or as an accounting service for companies without in-house finance teams. It’s an interesting failsafe, given that Maximor pitches itself as an AI startup that automates this work. Relying on humans may seem at odds with that promise.</p>\n<p>However, Krishnamurthy told TechCrunch that the software is self-sufficient, with agents handling end-to-end work independently. The agents act as preparers and people act as reviewers, he said, adding that it works much like traditional accounting teams, where junior staff handle routine tasks and managers focus on oversight.</p>\n<p>Krishnamurthy co-founded Maximor in the summer of 2024 after years at Microsoft as a founding member of its digital transformation group, where he led finance and data projects for Fortune 500 clients, including Coca-Cola. He teamed up with Ajay Krishna Amudan, now CTO, who previously worked on a revamp Microsoft’s internal revenue systems, among other projects there. The two have worked together for 14 years, starting as students at IIT-Madras.</p>\n<p>The duo’s finance experience at Microsoft helped attract angel investors including CFOs and finance leaders from Ramp, Gusto, MongoDB, Zuora, and the Big Four accounting firms, Krishnamurthy said. The seed round also drew Perplexity CEO Aravind Srinivas, a former IIT-Madras classmate of Krishnamurthy, and Zuora CEO Tien Tzuo, who was introduced by the VCs backing the round. Institutional investors Gaia Ventures and Boldcap also took part.</p>\n<p>Maximor, headquartered in New York with an office in Bengaluru, has 18 employees split almost evenly between the U.S. and India, and is actively hiring in both locations. The startup targets companies with at least $50 million in revenue and already counts early customers in the U.S., China, and India. Moreover, Maximor’s software supports both GAAP and IFRS standards, catering to enterprises with a global footprint.</p>\n</div>"

He started gaming at age 6, he told TechCrunch. Lootlock was selected for TechCrunch’s 2025 <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/startup-battlefield/\">Startup Battlefield 200</a> and will be exhibiting at <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-disrupt-2025/\">TechCrunch Disrupt</a>, October 27 to 29 in San Francisco. </p>\n<p>As he gabbed about gaming with other parents, or simply read the news, he kept hearing horror stories of kids shackling their parents with <a href=\"https://www.morningstar.com/news/marketwatch/2025071478/how-to-keep-your-kids-roblox-or-fortnite-habit-from-wrecking-your-credit-card-bill\" target=\"_blank\">surprise credit card bills</a>, sometimes unwittingly running up <a href=\"https://abcnews.go.com/GMA/Family/parents-share-warning-after-son-spends-4000-playing/story?id=108845824\" target=\"_blank\">thousands of dollars</a>.  </p>\n<p>The gaming industry has a notoriously slimy side of using “design tricks,” as the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau <a href=\"https://www.consumerfinance.gov/about-us/newsroom/consumer-advisory-video-games-are-targeting-your-children-to-get-into-your-wallet/\" target=\"_blank\">described last year.</a> They often target children, enticing them into unlocking fee-incurring game features. Other agencies, like the FTC have issued <a href=\"https://consumer.ftc.gov/consumer-alerts/2025/04/what-know-about-kids-video-games-ads-unexpected-payments\" target=\"_blank\">similar warnings</a>.  </p>\n<p>“The gaming industry uses clever design, social engineering, and player tracking to encourage kids to spend more money while playing,” Pompa said. “I am an avid gamer, so I have seen firsthand the drastic shift to micro-transactions in the industry over the last eight to nine years.” </p>\n<p>Although the FTC did force Fortnight earlier this year to refund <a href=\"https://www.ftc.gov/enforcement/refunds/fortnite-refunds\" target=\"_blank\">$126 million to people who filed claims,</a> that’s rare. Parents generally have no recourse but to pay.  </p>\n<p>The typical advice is for parents to use device-level parental controls that block in-app purchases. But, Pompa said, many of his parent friends are fine with letting kids spend a little money on such purchases, under the right conditions.  </p>\n<div>\n\t\t<p>Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t<p><span>San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>October 27-29, 2025</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n<p>He told the story of the friend named Joe that inspired Pompa to build Lootlock. Joe is a dad to three kids, all avid gamers. Joe gives each kid an allowance every month, and the kids were using the money to buy gaming products, setting up a ridiculous system where he handed them allowance cash and they handed it back to pay the credit card. And he had to monitor their purchases closely.  </p>\n<p>Looklock lets parents automatically load a digital, prepaid credit card, issued by Lootlock’s partner, Transcard, that kids add to their device’s digital wallet.  </p>\n<p>Parents can automate a set amount of allowance to be added to the card, say weekly or monthly, and can then make any portion of that not immediately available. The kid can unlock more as they, for instance, complete their chores. Parents can approve increases to the card through a text message. </p>\n<figure><img src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Lootlock.png?w=680\" alt=\"Looklock gaming parental control app\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Lootlock.png 1688w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Lootlock.png?resize=150,76 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Lootlock.png?resize=300,151 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Lootlock.png?resize=768,387 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Lootlock.png?resize=680,342 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Lootlock.png?resize=1200,604 1200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Lootlock.png?resize=1280,645 1280w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Lootlock.png?resize=430,217 430w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Lootlock.png?resize=720,363 720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Lootlock.png?resize=900,453 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Lootlock.png?resize=800,403 800w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Lootlock.png?resize=1536,773 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Lootlock.png?resize=668,336 668w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Lootlock.png?resize=1225,617 1225w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Lootlock.png?resize=708,357 708w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Lootlock.png?resize=50,25 50w\" /><figcaption><span>Looklock gaming parental control app</span><span><strong>Image Credits:</strong>Lootlock</span></figcaption></figure>\n<p>“We’re giving the parents super granular controls on how their kids can spend and when their kids can spend,” Pompa said. </p>\n<p>Lootlock is gamifying chores, too, with an upcoming feature that will be available in October called “bounty boards.”  Parents set up these boards which are essentially lists of the child’s chores. As the kids complete them — cleaning their room, pet care, etc. — they earn a “bounty.” And when they hit whatever threshold of bounties a parent sets, the app will unlock additional allowance to spend.  </p>\n<p>There’s also a gamified financial education component. Kids choose an avatar and as they practice good spending habits, like checking their Lootlock dashboard which tells them their account balances, they earn points that add up to equipment for their avatar: swords and armor, etc. Their avatar is persistent across anywhere Lootlock integrates into, like its Discord servers. </p>\n<p>“We’re tying all of the financial concepts into a video game concept,” Pompa said. </p>\n<p>Lootlock balances are also restricted to spending only on gaming products and can’t be used for other purchases on the internet. So parents don’t have to closely monitor what kinds of items the child is buying online. The idea, for now, is to focus on teaching children responsible gaming.  </p>\n<p>The startup currently employs seven people and is fully bootstrapped. </p>\n<p><em>If you want to learn from Lootlock firsthand, and see dozens of additional pitches, valuable workshops, and make the connections that drive business results, </em><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-disrupt-2025/tickets/?promo=postinclusion_sb200startup&utm_campaign=disrupt2025&utm_content=ticketsales&utm_medium=post&utm_source=tc\"><em>head here to learn more about this year’s Disrupt</em></a><em>, held October 27 to 29 in San Francisco.</em><br /></p>\n<figure><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-disrupt-2025/tickets/?promo=postinclusion_sb200startup&utm_campaign=disrupt2025&utm_content=ticketsales&utm_medium=post&utm_source=tc\"><img src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/TC25_Disrupt_General_Article_No-Anniversary_Headers_1920x1080.png?w=680\" alt=\"TechCrunch Disrupt 2025\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/TC25_Disrupt_General_Article_No-Anniversary_Headers_1920x1080.png 1920w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/TC25_Disrupt_General_Article_No-Anniversary_Headers_1920x1080.png?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/TC25_Disrupt_General_Article_No-Anniversary_Headers_1920x1080.png?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/TC25_Disrupt_General_Article_No-Anniversary_Headers_1920x1080.png?resize=768,432 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/TC25_Disrupt_General_Article_No-Anniversary_Headers_1920x1080.png?resize=680,383 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/TC25_Disrupt_General_Article_No-Anniversary_Headers_1920x1080.png?resize=1200,675 1200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/TC25_Disrupt_General_Article_No-Anniversary_Headers_1920x1080.png?resize=1280,720 1280w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/TC25_Disrupt_General_Article_No-Anniversary_Headers_1920x1080.png?resize=430,242 430w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/TC25_Disrupt_General_Article_No-Anniversary_Headers_1920x1080.png?resize=720,405 720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/TC25_Disrupt_General_Article_No-Anniversary_Headers_1920x1080.png?resize=900,506 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/TC25_Disrupt_General_Article_No-Anniversary_Headers_1920x1080.png?resize=800,450 800w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/TC25_Disrupt_General_Article_No-Anniversary_Headers_1920x1080.png?resize=1536,864 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/TC25_Disrupt_General_Article_No-Anniversary_Headers_1920x1080.png?resize=668,375 668w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/TC25_Disrupt_General_Article_No-Anniversary_Headers_1920x1080.png?resize=1097,617 1097w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/TC25_Disrupt_General_Article_No-Anniversary_Headers_1920x1080.png?resize=708,398 708w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/TC25_Disrupt_General_Article_No-Anniversary_Headers_1920x1080.png?resize=50,28 50w\" /></a></figure>\n</div>"

    "body": "<div>\n<p>Venture capitalists have convinced themselves they’ve found the next big investing edge: using AI to wring software-like margins out of traditionally labor-intensive services businesses. The strategy involves acquiring mature professional services firms, implementing AI to automate tasks, then using the improved cash flow to roll up more companies.</p>\n<p>Leading the charge is General Catalyst (GC), which has dedicated $1.5 billion of its latest fundraise to what it calls a “creation” strategy that’s focused on incubating AI-native software companies in specific verticals, then using those companies as acquisition vehicles to buy established firms — and their customers — in the same sectors. GC has placed bets across seven industries, from legal services to IT management, with plans to expand to up to 20 sectors altogether.</p>\n<p>“Services globally is a $16 trillion revenue a year globally,” said <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.generalcatalyst.com/team/marc-bhargava\">Marc Bhargava</a>, who leads GC’s related efforts, in a <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/general-catalysts-plan-to-eat-the-%2416-trillion/id1498270180?i=1000725773510\">recent interview with TechCrunch</a>. “In comparison, software is only $1 trillion globally,” he noted, adding that the allure of software investing has always been its higher margins. “As you get software to scale, there’s very little marginal cost and there’s a great deal of marginal revenue.” </p>\n<p>If you can automate services business, too, he said – tackling 30% to 50% of those companies with AI, and even automating up to 70% of those core tasks in the case of call centers – the math begins to look irresistible.</p>\n<p>The game plan seems to be working right now. Take <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.crn.com/news/channel-news/2025/titan-scores-74m-funding-to-build-ai-platform-and-acquire-msps-to-use-it\">Titan MSP</a>, one of GC’s portfolio companies. The investment firm provided $74 million over two tranches to help the company develop AI tools for managed service providers, then it acquired RFA, a well-known IT services firm. Through pilot programs, says Bhargava, Titan demonstrated it could automate 38% of typical MSP tasks. The company now plans to use its improved margins to acquire additional MSPs in a classic roll-up strategy.</p>\n<p>Similarly, the firm incubated <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/eudia-secures-up-to-105m-in-series-a-funding-led-by-general-catalyst-to-transform-legal-work-through-ai-powered-augmented-intelligence-302375331.html\">Eudia</a>, which focuses on in-house legal departments rather than law firms. Eudia has signed up Fortune 100 clients including Chevron, Southwest Airlines, and Stripe, offering fixed-fee legal services powered by AI rather than traditional hourly billing. The company recently acquired Johnson Hanna, an alternative legal service provider, to expand its reach.</p>\n<p>GC looks to double – at least – the EBITDA margin of those companies that it’s acquiring, Bhargava explained.</p>\n<div>\n\t\t<p>Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t<p><span>San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>October 27-29, 2025</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n<p>The powerhouse firm isn’t alone in its thinking. The venture firm Mayfield has carved out $100 million specifically for “AI teammates” investments, including Gruve, an IT consulting startup that acquired a $5 million security consulting company, then grew it to $15 million in revenue within six months while achieving an 80% gross margin, according to its founders.</p>\n<p>“If 80% of the work will be done by AI, it can have an 80% to 90% gross margin,” Navin Chaddha, Mayfield’s managing director, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/06/29/why-ai-will-eat-mckinseys-lunch-but-not-today/\">told TechCrunch this summer</a>. “You could have blended margins of 60% to 70% and produce 20% to 30% net income.”</p>\n<p>Solo investor Elad Gil has been pursuing a similar strategy for three years, backing companies that acquire mature businesses and transform them with AI. “If you own the asset, you can [transform it] much more rapidly than if you’re just selling software as a vendor,” Gil said in an <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/06/01/early-ai-investor-elad-gil-finds-his-next-big-bet-ai-powered-rollups/\">interview with TechCrunch this spring</a>. </p>\n<p>But early warning signs suggest this whole services-industry metamorphosis may be <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/09/27/beware-coworkers-who-produce-ai-generated-workslop/\">more complicated</a> than VCs anticipate. A recent study by researchers at Stanford Social Media Lab and BetterUp Labs that surveyed 1,150 full-time employees across industries found that 40% of those employees are having to shoulder more work because of what the researchers call “workslop” – AI-generated work that appears polished but lacks substance, creating more work (and headaches) for colleagues.</p>\n<p>The trend is taking a toll on the organizations. Employees involved in the survey say they’re spending an average of nearly two hours dealing with each instance of workslop, including to first decipher it, then decide whether or not to send it back, and oftentimes just to fix it themselves. </p>\n<p>Based on those participants’ estimates of time spent, along with their self-reported salaries, the authors of the survey estimate that workslop carries an invisible tax of $186 per month per person. “For an organization of 10,000 workers, given the estimated prevalence of workslop . . .this yields over <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://hbr.org/2025/09/ai-generated-workslop-is-destroying-productivity\">$9 million per year in lost productivity</a>,” they write in a new Harvard Business Review article.</p>\n<p>Bhargava disputed the notion that AI is overhyped, arguing instead that all these implementation failures actually validate GC’s approach. “I think it kind of shows the opportunity, which is, it’s not easy to apply AI technology to these businesses,” he said. “If all the Fortune 100 and all these folks could just bring in a consulting firm, slap on some AI, get a contract with OpenAI, and transform their business, then obviously our thesis [would be] a little bit less robust. But the reality is, it’s really hard to transform a company with AI.”</p>\n<p>He pointed to the technical sophistication required in AI as the most critical missing puzzle piece. “There’s a lot of different technology. It’s good at different things,” he said. “You really need these applied AI engineers from places like Rippling and Ramp and Figma and Scale, who have worked with the different models, understand their nuances, understand which ones are good for what, understand how to wrap it in software.” That complexity is exactly why GC’s strategy of pairing AI specialists with industry experts to build companies from the ground up makes sense, he argued.</p>\n<p>Still, there’s no denying that workslop threatens to undermine — to some extent — the strategy’s core economics. Even if a holding company is created as starting point, if the acquired companies reduce staff as the AI efficiency thesis suggests they should, they’ll have fewer people available to catch and correct AI-generated errors. If the companies maintain current staffing levels to handle the additional work created by problematic AI output, the huge margin gains that VCs are counting on might never be realized.</p>\n<p>Arguably, these scenarios should perhaps slow the scaling plans that are central to the VCs’ roll-up strategies and that potentially undermine the numbers that make these deals attractive to them. But let’s face it; it will take more than a study or <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.axios.com/2025/08/21/ai-wall-street-big-tech\">two</a> to slow down most Silicon Valley investors.</p>\n<p>In fact, because they typically acquire businesses with existing cash flow, GC says its “creation strategy” companies are already profitable — a marked departure from the traditional VC playbook of backing high-growth, cash-burning startups. It’s also likely a welcome change for the limited partners behind venture firms, who have bankrolled years of losses at companies that never reached profitability.</p>\n<p>“As long as AI technology continues to improve, and we see this massive investment and improvement in the models,” Bhargava said, “I think there’ll just be more and more industries for us to help incubate companies.”</p>\n</div>"
