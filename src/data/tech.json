    "body": "<div>\n<p>Meta announced on Wednesday that data collected from user interactions with its AI products will soon be used to sell targeted ads across its social media platforms. </p>\n<p>The company will update its privacy policy by December 16 to reflect the change, and will notify users in the coming days. The new policy applies globally, except for users in South Korea, the United Kingdom, and the European Union, where privacy laws prevent this type of data collection.</p>\n<p>Meta’s core business has long relied on building detailed profiles of Facebook and Instagram users to sell hyper-targeted ads. The company offers advertisers a way to reach specific demographics and user groups. Now, Meta will also use data from conversations with its AI chatbot to build out those profiles, giving it another powerful signal to target its ads.</p>\n<p>The social media giant already has lots of information about its users, but Meta AI has created a rich new stream of information. The company says more than a billion people chat with Meta AI every month, and it’s common for users to hold long, detailed conversations with the AI chatbot. So far, Meta has largely given away its AI products for free, but now the company can improve its valuable ad products based on the data it collects.</p>\n<p>If a user chats with Meta AI about hiking, for example, the company may show ads for hiking gear. However, Meta spokesperson Emil Vazquez tells TechCrunch that the privacy update is broader than just Meta AI, and applies to the company’s other AI offerings. </p>\n<p>That means Meta may use data from AI features in its Ray-Ban Meta smart glasses — including voice recordings, pictures, and videos analyzed with AI — to further target its ad products. Meta may also use data from its <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/09/25/meta-launches-vibes-a-short-form-video-feed-of-ai-slop/\">new AI-video feed, Vibes</a>, and its AI image generation product, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/09/25/meta-ais-genai-imagine-features-expand-across-facebook-instagram-and-messenger/\">Imagine.</a></p>\n<p>Conversations with Meta AI will only influence ads on Facebook and Instagram if a user is logged into the same account across products. </p>\n<div>\n\t\t<p>Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t<p><span>San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>October 27-29, 2025</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n<p>There is no way to opt out, according to Meta.</p>\n<p>The privacy changes are another reminder that free products from Big Tech companies often come with strings attached. Many tech companies already use AI interactions to train their models. Meta, for instance, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/10/02/meta-confirms-it-may-train-its-ai-on-any-image-you-ask-ray-ban-meta-ai-to-analyze/\">trains on voice recordings, photos, and videos</a> analyzed through Meta AI on its smart glasses. Now it will also feed that data into its ad machine.</p>\n<p>In a briefing with reporters, Meta privacy policy manager Christy Harris said the company is still in the process of building out systems that will use AI interactions to improve its ad products. However, the company says user conversations with AI around sensitive topics — including religious views, sexual orientation, political views, health, racial or ethnic origin, philosophical beliefs, or trade union membership — will not be used to show them ads.</p>\n<p>Tech companies are starting to test out ways to monetize AI products, most of which are free today. On Monday, OpenAI unveiled a way to <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/09/29/openai-takes-on-google-amazon-with-new-agentic-shopping-system/\">purchase products in ChatGPT</a>, where the company will take a cut of transactions completed in the app. Earlier this year, Google revealed plans for how it would <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/05/21/google-is-bringing-ads-to-ai-mode/\">introduce ads</a> into its AI-powered search product, called AI Mode.</p>\n<p>Meta says the company has “no plans imminently” to put ads in its AI products, though CEO Mark Zuckerberg has <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.yahoo.com/news/ad-extinction-mark-zuckerberg-takes-125815262.html\">suggested they may be coming </a>in the future.</p>\n</div><div>\n<div>\n\t\t<p>Maxwell Zeff is a senior reporter at TechCrunch specializing in AI.

    "body": "<div>\n<p>On Wednesday, Google offered an early preview of its next flagship smart home device, the AI-powered Google Home speaker, launching in spring 2026. The device, priced at $99, will be built around the company’s AI assistant Gemini AI and will come in four colors: Porcelain, Hazel, Berry, and Jade.</p>\n<p>The somewhat delayed timing of the launch is an intentional choice on Google’s part, explained Anish Kattukaran, Chief Product Officer at Google Home and Nest, in a press briefing ahead of Wednesday’s event.</p>\n<p>The company first wants to ensure the new Gemini functionality reaches its other Google Home customers on older devices and gives them time to work out the kinks. Those existing customers will be able to try out Gemini in Early Access, offer feedback, and report bugs, he says.</p>\n<p>“It’s got to work for the existing users. We don’t want to force you to buy a new one unless you want to,” said Kattukaran. “And by the way, we think you may want to, but you don’t need to,” he added.</p>\n<figure><img src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Google-Home-Speaker-with-Light-Ring-Porcelain.png?w=680\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Google-Home-Speaker-with-Light-Ring-Porcelain.png 10882w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Google-Home-Speaker-with-Light-Ring-Porcelain.png?resize=150,109 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Google-Home-Speaker-with-Light-Ring-Porcelain.png?resize=300,219 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Google-Home-Speaker-with-Light-Ring-Porcelain.png?resize=768,559 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Google-Home-Speaker-with-Light-Ring-Porcelain.png?resize=680,495 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Google-Home-Speaker-with-Light-Ring-Porcelain.png?resize=1200,874 1200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Google-Home-Speaker-with-Light-Ring-Porcelain.png?resize=1280,932 1280w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Google-Home-Speaker-with-Light-Ring-Porcelain.png?resize=430,313 430w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Google-Home-Speaker-with-Light-Ring-Porcelain.png?resize=720,524 720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Google-Home-Speaker-with-Light-Ring-Porcelain.png?resize=900,656 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Google-Home-Speaker-with-Light-Ring-Porcelain.png?resize=800,583 800w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Google-Home-Speaker-with-Light-Ring-Porcelain.png?resize=1536,1119 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Google-Home-Speaker-with-Light-Ring-Porcelain.png?resize=2048,1492 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Google-Home-Speaker-with-Light-Ring-Porcelain.png?resize=668,487 668w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Google-Home-Speaker-with-Light-Ring-Porcelain.png?resize=515,375 515w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Google-Home-Speaker-with-Light-Ring-Porcelain.png?resize=847,617 847w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Google-Home-Speaker-with-Light-Ring-Porcelain.png?resize=708,516 708w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Google-Home-Speaker-with-Light-Ring-Porcelain.png?resize=50,36 50w\" /></figure>\n<p>Being built for Gemini means the new speaker will have a processor capable of handling Gemini AI, which will also handle things like background noise suppression, reverb (echo effects), and echo cancellation.

The equity stakes will be acquired through no-cost warrants, which are financial instruments that give the government the right to purchase shares at a set price. The new terms came out of a renegotiation with the DOE’s Loan Programs Office<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/09/24/trump-administration-wants-10-stake-in-canadian-lithium-miner-that-sells-to-gm/\"> over a $2.26 billion loan</a> that was awarded to Lithium Americas under the Biden Administration.</p>\n<p>Shares of Lithium Americas spiked 34% in after-hours trading.</p>\n<p>The DOE said the equity stakes will serve as additional collateral on the loan, helping to reduce repayment risk for taxpayers. Lithium is a key chemical element that is used in the batteries of electric vehicles and smartphones.</p>\n<p>“Despite having some of the largest deposits, the United States produces less than 1% percent of the global supply of lithium. Thanks to President Trump’s bold leadership, American lithium production is going to skyrocket,” U.S. Energy Secretary Chris Wright said in a press release. “Today’s announcement helps reduce our dependence on foreign adversaries for critical minerals by strengthening domestic supply chains and ensures better stewardship of American taxpayer dollars.

The company also announced its first-ever charging case, a new Health Panels feature that lets members schedule bloodwork directly in the Oura app, multi-ring support, and more.</p>\n<p>The new Oura Ring 4 Ceramic is made from zirconia ceramic, which the company says allows for durability and lightweight comfort. Oura describes its new ceramic collection as combining “style and comfort.”</p>\n<p>Oura says that, unlike painted or coated finishes, the color on the rings comes from natural minerals in the ceramic itself, so it stays vibrant and doesn’t fade over time.</p>\n<p>Oura Ring 4 Ceramic comes with a Polishing Pad that can wipe off scuffs that may be caused by softer metals, like those found in cookware or dumbbells. To avoid scuffing, Oura suggests wearing the ring on your non-dominant hand to avoid unnecessary impact. </p>\n<p>The ring comes in four colors: Tide, Cloud, Petal, and Midnight. The collection is priced at $499, with membership pricing at $5.99 per month or $69.99 per year. The rings are available in sizes 4-15. </p>\n<figure><img src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/OR4C_Midnight.jpg?w=680\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/OR4C_Midnight.jpg 3240w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/OR4C_Midnight.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/OR4C_Midnight.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/OR4C_Midnight.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/OR4C_Midnight.jpg?resize=680,453 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/OR4C_Midnight.jpg?resize=1200,800 1200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/OR4C_Midnight.jpg?resize=1280,853 1280w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/OR4C_Midnight.jpg?resize=430,287 430w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/OR4C_Midnight.jpg?resize=720,480 720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/OR4C_Midnight.jpg?resize=900,600 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/OR4C_Midnight.jpg?resize=800,533 800w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/OR4C_Midnight.jpg?resize=1536,1024 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/OR4C_Midnight.jpg?resize=2048,1365 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/OR4C_Midnight.jpg?resize=668,445 668w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/OR4C_Midnight.jpg?resize=563,375 563w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/OR4C_Midnight.jpg?resize=926,617 926w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/OR4C_Midnight.jpg?resize=708,472 708w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/OR4C_Midnight.jpg?resize=50,33 50w\" /><figcaption><span><strong>Image Credits:</strong>Oura</span></figcaption></figure>\n<p>“We want to give people even more reasons to wear an Oura ring, and we’re doing that with the Oura Ring 4 Ceramic collection,” Oura VP of Consumer Software Product, Jason Russell, told TechCrunch in an interview. “They are made from this ceramic zirconia material that’s very unique.

Find a ring that really suits their vibe and how they want to communicate that vibe to the world, and Oura Ring 4 Ceramic is a new way to do that.”</p>\n<p>As for the new Oura Ring 4 Charging Case, the company says it was created in response to members asking for a way to charge their ring while on the go. </p>\n<p>The case stores up to five full ring charges and works with a USB-C cord. Both the case and the Oura Ring fully charge in 90 minutes. Oura says the case can also serve as a secure way to store your ring when you’re not wearing it.</p>\n<p>The charging case costs $99 and will be available to order later this year. </p>\n<figure><img src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/OR4C_Charging_Case_Open.jpg?w=680\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/OR4C_Charging_Case_Open.jpg 3240w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/OR4C_Charging_Case_Open.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/OR4C_Charging_Case_Open.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/OR4C_Charging_Case_Open.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/OR4C_Charging_Case_Open.jpg?resize=680,453 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/OR4C_Charging_Case_Open.jpg?resize=1200,800 1200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/OR4C_Charging_Case_Open.jpg?resize=1280,853 1280w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/OR4C_Charging_Case_Open.jpg?resize=430,287 430w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/OR4C_Charging_Case_Open.jpg?resize=720,480 720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/OR4C_Charging_Case_Open.jpg?resize=900,600 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/OR4C_Charging_Case_Open.jpg?resize=800,533 800w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/OR4C_Charging_Case_Open.jpg?resize=1536,1024 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/OR4C_Charging_Case_Open.jpg?resize=2048,1365 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/OR4C_Charging_Case_Open.jpg?resize=668,445 668w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/OR4C_Charging_Case_Open.jpg?resize=563,375 563w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/OR4C_Charging_Case_Open.jpg?resize=926,617 926w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/OR4C_Charging_Case_Open.jpg?resize=708,472 708w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/OR4C_Charging_Case_Open.jpg?resize=50,33 50w\" /><figcaption><span><strong>Image Credits:</strong>Oura</span></figcaption></figure>\n<p>Oura also introduced Health Panels in its app, enabling members to track 50 biomarkers alongside their daily sleep, readiness, and activity data. With Health Panels, members use the Oura app to book a blood test at one of over 2,000 Quest Diagnostics labs across the U.S. for $99.</p>\n<p>“You will be able to walk in and get that blood work done, rather than waiting an hour, as you might otherwise,” Russell said. “And then those results are going to actually come straight to you in the Oura app. We will alert you when they’re ready, and you’ll see an overview. Oura Advisor, as always, will be here to interpret all this data for you and really isolate what are the meaningful takeaways,” he continued.</p>\n<p>“We will show you what’s in range, what’s out of range. You’ll be able to see the full comprehensive set, of course, as well. And then we’ll really do more to actually help you understand, ‘What can I do directly myself to impact some of these metrics?’” Russell added. </p>\n<p>Members can ask questions in the app like, “What does my A1C of 5.7% mean?” or, “How can I improve my cholesterol profile?”</p>\n<p>The blood biomarkers and Oura Ring data can reveal patterns and connections among lifestyle, behaviors, and underlying health trends that Oura says might otherwise go unnoticed. </p>\n<figure><img src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Health-Panels-Results-.gif?w=335\" alt=\"\" /><figcaption><span><strong>Image Credits:</strong>Oura</span></figcaption></figure>\n<p>Russell explained that the idea behind Health Panels is to provide users with affordable access to comprehensive blood work. He notes that when you visit a doctor for a specific issue, they often order lab tests and only focus on that concern when the results come through. </p>\n<p>This means that other valuable data in the results is often overlooked or hard to interpret. That broader data can offer important insights into your overall health and potential underlying conditions, he noted.</p>\n<p>While services that allow you to get blood tests on your own already exist, Russell said they can be expensive and cost hundreds of dollars, which is why Oura is launching Health Panels at $99.</p>\n<p>Last, Oura announced that members can now pair and switch between different Oura Ring 4 colors under a single account. The company says this functionality allows members to match their Oura Ring to their day, whether it’s switching them out for a workout or an outfit.</p>\n</div>"

The service will now let users exclude certain tracks from influencing their taste profile. This taste profile refers to streamer’s sense of your personal musical taste and interests, and it drives Spotify’s recommendations, including your Discovery Weekly, Home page selections, annual Wrapped experience, Blend playlists with friends, and more.</p>\n<p>The company had previously provided a way for users to <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2023/02/08/spotify-now-lets-you-select-which-playlists-youd-like-to-impact-your-recommendations-less/\">exclude certain playlists</a> from their taste profile, but this didn’t solve the overall problem of having music you’re not really into influence Spotify’s recommendations. Rather, the playlist feature was more useful for things like making sure your sleep music didn’t lead to more new age or white noise suggestions.</p>\n<p>With this new option, you can move through your recently played items to tell Spotify that there are some songs you were playing but don’t actually <em>like</em>. (Parents everywhere, rejoice!)</p>\n<p>To use the feature, both free and premium users can tap the three dots on the top-right corner of their screen after selecting the song they want to exclude. Users can then choose to exclude the song from their taste profile or include a previously excluded song.</p>\n<p>Spotify’s hyperpersonalization has been a long-time key selling point for the service. But there are many scenarios where the ingestion of everything you listen to into algorithms doesn’t make sense. Families, particularly those with small children, immediately come to mind. Users also often share their Spotify account while in the car with friends and family, allowing others to take their turn at playing DJ. The growing number of smart speakers in the home has also led some members of the household to become the default Spotify account holder associated with everyone’s taste.</p>\n<p>Given the wide range of scenarios, manually excluding tracks is a nice workaround, but it’s not the best solution. Ideally, users would be able to more easily switch between profiles, perhaps even by using voice commands, as you’re often listening while driving. Or the app could offer a way to tap to associate an entire listening session with one family member or the other, instead of forcing you to go through songs one by one.</p>\n<p>In any event, the feature will at least offer some recourse for those who have longed to have their Spotify Wrapped not ruined by the kids’ music. </p>\n<div>\n\t\t<p>Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t<p><span>San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>October 27-29, 2025</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\t\t\t<div>\n\t<p>Topics</p>\n</div>\n<div>\n<div><p>\n\t\tSarah has worked as a reporter for TechCrunch since August 2011.

    "body": "<div>\n<p>Starbase is a city without a police department, but not without police.</p>\n<p>For months, Cameron County sheriff’s deputies have patrolled the roads and beaches surrounding SpaceX’s sprawling rocket facility in South Texas. Now, less than a year after <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/05/04/residents-of-spacexs-starbase-launch-site-vote-to-incorporate-as-a-city/\">Starbase residents voted to incorporate</a>, the city has signed formal agreements making those deputies its de facto police force and Cameron County jails the destination for anyone arrested within city limits.</p>\n<p>The two interlocal deals, approved in September and effective beginning Wednesday, are sweeping. One requires Cameron County to dedicate eight deputies to Starbase, though only two will patrol the city during a single shift.</p>\n<p>The other sees Cameron County providing “jail services,” with Starbase agreeing to pay $100 per day per inmate and to reimburse the county for additional expenses, like medical care or psychiatric services for inmates.  </p>\n<p>It’s a way of standing up a criminal justice system overnight, without having to build one from scratch. Such arrangements are not unheard of in Texas, especially for the myriad small or newly incorporated towns that may not be able to stand up a full police department on their own.</p>\n<p>But Starbase is not a typical town. The population is small, and most of the residents work for SpaceX. The city itself was finalized only after SpaceX bought up old properties in Boca Chica Village and spread its launch-and-manufacturing activities further afield.</p>\n<p>The law enforcement contract sets up more than just routine patrols. Starbase can also opt to pay for security during “special events” — likely rocket launches, when thousands of spectators descend on the small beach town of Boca Chica to watch Starship’s spectacular flights.</p>\n<div>\n\t\t<p>Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t<p><span>San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>October 27-29, 2025</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n<p>The clause allowing extra police for special events is a shrewd move, and it reinforces the idea that Starbase is not a traditional municipality, but a company town built around one purpose: getting Starship flying — frequently.</p>\n<p>The agreement reinforces this fact. While Starbase has its own mayor and commissioners, public safety is carried out by Cameron County. Body camera footage and other records remain with the county, per the agreement, and Starbase residents who have an issue with the local policing will have to take it up with their next-door neighbors. For now, SpaceX has built a town of its own, but the power to enforce laws is still with someone else.</p>\n</div><div>\n<div>\n\t\t<p>Aria Alamalhodaei covers the space and defense industries at TechCrunch.

Several apps like this have cropped up over the years, including <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/03/anonymous-snapchat-app-sendit-surges-with-3-5m-installs-after-snap-bans-yolo-and-lmk/\">YOLO and LMK</a>, which were suspended on Snapchat in 2021 due to a lawsuit over a child’s suicide. After that suspension, Sendit quickly gained <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/03/anonymous-snapchat-app-sendit-surges-with-3-5m-installs-after-snap-bans-yolo-and-lmk/\">3.5 million downloads</a>, as users flocked to the app to replace those that were no longer available.</p>\n<p>By the following year, TechCrunch <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2022/06/29/anonymous-social-apps-shift-their-attention-to-instagram-in-the-wake-of-snapchats-ban/\">reporting</a> found that the newer anonymous question apps, like Sendit and <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2022/08/04/top-anonymous-social-app-ngl-forced-to-stop-tricking-its-users/\">LMK</a>, were misleading users with fake messages, then offering in-app purchases to reveal who sent the messages.</p>\n<p>This reporting was echoed in the FTC’s complaint, which stated that Sendit sent users fake, provocative messages (like “would you ever get with me?” or “have you done drugs?”).</p>\n<p>If a user wanted to see who sent a message, they could spend $9.99 for a “Diamond Membership,” but the FTC claims that it was not clear that this was a recurring weekly payment, and not a one-time cost. If a user revealed the “identity” behind a message that was actually submitted by Sendit, they would be given false information.</p>\n<p>The FTC also accused Sendit of knowingly collecting data on users under the age of 13 without parental consent, which is illegal under <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Children%27s_Online_Privacy_Protection_Act\" target=\"_blank\">COPPA</a> (Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act). In particular, the FTC cited an instance from 2022 when more than 116,000 users reported that they were under 13, but Sendit parent Iconic Hearts did not notify parents that it had collected this data, nor did it ask for permission.</p>\n<p>That same year, TechCrunch found that Sendit users were complaining in App Store reviews that the Sendit for Instagram app had solicited downloads by marketing itself as “Sendit Reveal,” an app that would “reveal” who sent them anonymous messages. </p>\n<p>At the time, when TechCrunch asked Sendit founder Hunter Rice about these dark patterns, he suggested that we were looking for clickbait.</p>\n<p>“There’s a lot of great things about what we’re doing that are newsworthy,” Rice <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2022/06/29/anonymous-social-apps-shift-their-attention-to-instagram-in-the-wake-of-snapchats-ban/\">told TechCrunch</a> in 2022. “You’re welcome to have your fun with this topic, but I’m only interested in talking about real news.”</p>\n<p>Sendit <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2022/07/15/not-gonna-lie-this-ngl-lawsuit-is-kinda-juicy/\">also sued a competitor, NGL</a>, in 2022, saying it stole the idea of the fake, anonymous questions and other trade secrets.

    "body": "<div>\n<p>On Wednesday, Wikimedia Deutschland announced a new database that will make Wikipedia’s wealth of knowledge more accessible to AI models.</p>\n<p>Called the Wikidata Embedding Project, the system applies a vector-based semantic search — a technique that helps computers understand the meaning and relationships between words — to the existing data on Wikipedia and its sister platforms, consisting of nearly 120 million entries. </p>\n<p>Combined with new support for the Model Context Protocol (MCP), a standard that helps AI systems communicate with data sources, the project makes the data more accessible to natural language queries from LLMs.</p>\n<p>The project was undertaken by Wikimedia’s German branch in collaboration with the neural search company Jina.AI and DataStax, a real-time training-data company owned by IBM.</p>\n<p>Wikidata has offered machine-readable data from Wikimedia properties for years, but the pre-existing tools only allowed for keyword searches and SPARQL queries, a specialized query language. The new system will work better with retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems that allow AI models to pull in external information, giving developers a chance to ground their models in knowledge verified by Wikipedia editors.</p>\n<p>The data is also structured to provide crucial semantic context. Querying the database for <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q901\">the word “scientist,”</a> for instance, will produce lists of prominent nuclear scientists as well as scientists who worked at Bell Labs.

Earlier this year, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/04/23/eu-fines-apple-meta-millions-for-breaching-tech-competition-rules/\">the EU slapped a $568 million fine</a> on Apple for not complying with DMA rules.</p>\n<p>In July, Apple <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/07/29/apple-releases-ios-18-6/\">released a new process for installing third-party app marketplaces</a> on iPhones with iOS 18.6. The new process includes only one screen showing users that they might miss some features, such as subscription management offered by the App Store. The screen also informs users that the alternative app store’s developer will handle their data directly.</p>\n<p>Epic Games said that prior to the iOS 18.6 update, 65% of users attempting to install its game store abandoned the process. However, after the update, that figure dropped to 25%. The company noted that this drop rate is closer to the rate it observes with Windows and macOS users installing its game store.</p>\n<figure><img src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Store-Drop-off-Chart.jpeg?w=680\" alt=\"An image with a chart showing drop off rates of users who are trying to install the Epic Games store on iOS and Android.\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Store-Drop-off-Chart.jpeg 3840w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Store-Drop-off-Chart.jpeg?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Store-Drop-off-Chart.jpeg?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Store-Drop-off-Chart.jpeg?resize=768,432 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Store-Drop-off-Chart.jpeg?resize=680,383 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Store-Drop-off-Chart.jpeg?resize=1200,675 1200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Store-Drop-off-Chart.jpeg?resize=1280,720 1280w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Store-Drop-off-Chart.jpeg?resize=430,242 430w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Store-Drop-off-Chart.jpeg?resize=720,405 720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Store-Drop-off-Chart.jpeg?resize=900,506 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Store-Drop-off-Chart.jpeg?resize=800,450 800w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Store-Drop-off-Chart.jpeg?resize=1536,864 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Store-Drop-off-Chart.jpeg?resize=2048,1152 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Store-Drop-off-Chart.jpeg?resize=668,375 668w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Store-Drop-off-Chart.jpeg?resize=1097,617 1097w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Store-Drop-off-Chart.jpeg?resize=708,398 708w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Store-Drop-off-Chart.jpeg?resize=50,28 50w\" /><figcaption><span>Image Credits: Epic Games</span></figcaption></figure>\n<p>Despite this improvement, the company remains critical of Apple’s policies, including <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/06/26/apple-updates-the-rules-for-its-eu-app-store-by-adding-more-complicated-fees/\">charging a core technology fee</a>, imposing notarization and approval policies, and implementing rules that make it <a target=\"_blank\">difficult for developers</a> to distribute their apps through alternative app stores.</p>\n<figure><img src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/iOS-Install-Flow_New_01.jpg?w=680\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/iOS-Install-Flow_New_01.jpg 1920w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/iOS-Install-Flow_New_01.jpg?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/iOS-Install-Flow_New_01.jpg?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/iOS-Install-Flow_New_01.jpg?resize=768,432 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/iOS-Install-Flow_New_01.jpg?resize=680,383 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/iOS-Install-Flow_New_01.jpg?resize=1200,675 1200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/iOS-Install-Flow_New_01.jpg?resize=1280,720 1280w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/iOS-Install-Flow_New_01.jpg?resize=430,242 430w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/iOS-Install-Flow_New_01.jpg?resize=720,405 720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/iOS-Install-Flow_New_01.jpg?resize=900,506 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/iOS-Install-Flow_New_01.jpg?resize=800,450 800w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/iOS-Install-Flow_New_01.jpg?resize=1536,864 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/iOS-Install-Flow_New_01.jpg?resize=668,375 668w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/iOS-Install-Flow_New_01.jpg?resize=1097,617 1097w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/iOS-Install-Flow_New_01.jpg?resize=708,398 708w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/iOS-Install-Flow_New_01.jpg?resize=50,28 50w\" /><figcaption><span>New Installation process after iOS 18.6 rollout Image Credits: Epic</span></figcaption></figure>\n<p>Epic Games repeated an argument from its <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://appleinsider.com/articles/21/05/14/epic-games-expert-says-ios-could-be-like-macos-without-security-drawbacks\">lawsuit against the iPhone maker</a>: that Apple allows users more freedom to install apps from outside the App Store on Mac computers.

    "body": "<div>\n<p>Enterprise giant Salesforce is looking to ride the vibe coding wave — where developers describe what they want in natural language and AI agents write the code — with its new AI-powered developer tool.  </p>\n<p>Salesforce announced its new vibe coding offering, Agentforce Vibes, on Wednesday. This new coding tool helps developers work autonomously on Salesforce apps and agents by handling much of the technical implementation automatically. Agentforce Vibes can help developers from the app idea phase to building to observability with enterprise security and governance controls baked in.  </p>\n<p>This new tool includes an autonomous AI coding agent named Vibe Codey. This agent is already connected to a company’s existing Salesforce account, which allows it to reuse an org’s already-written code, and follow its coding guidelines, to create apps that match existing products.  </p>\n<p>Dan Fernandez, the vice president of product for developer services at Salesforce, told TechCrunch that Agentforce Vibes being connected to a company’s existing Salesforce account gives enterprises the best of both worlds. They get to foray into vibe coding but without the potential security issues and without having to start each project from scratch. </p>\n<p>“We’re trying to give you everything,” Fernandez said. “So rather than having to spend a bunch of time on setting up [model context protocols — systems that let AI models securely communicate with external tools and data], setting up a dev environment, setting up tools, everything’s prebuilt and ready for you, including AI requests to get started. And that really is sort of a differentiator on how we’re lowering the barrier to entry.” </p>\n<p>This isn’t Salesforce’s first foray into vibe coding, Fernandez said, but rather the latest addition to its suite of AI developer tools.  </p>\n<p>Salesforce first <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2023/04/19/salesforce-is-working-on-a-pair-of-new-generative-ai-driven-workflow-tools/\" target=\"_blank\">released an AI-powered code building tool</a> back in 2023. Last year, the company announced the <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/10/29/salesforce-ai-chatbot-agentforce-hits-general-availability/\" target=\"_blank\">general availability of Agentforce</a> for developers at its Dreamforce conference.  </p>\n<div>\n\t\t<p>Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t<p><span>San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>October 27-29, 2025</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n<p>Now, everything is coming together.  </p>\n<p>“[We are] taking the power of the client tools and Agentforce for developers and making it tailored to Salesforce development,” Fernandez said. “It really is that end-to-end experience for having an enterprise vibe coding for the agentic enterprise.” </p>\n<p>These new capabilities are built on a fork from open source AI coding agent <a href=\"https://cline.bot/?utm_source=google&utm_medium=cpc&utm_campaign=22809391165&utm_content=&utm_term=engine:google|campaignid:22809391165|adid:|gclid:CjwKCAjw_-3GBhAYEiwAjh9fUH0MDvZK-6mexjX2Ul0qkw0iO5R_XUSl-NfaitR-czFuIyPnl6P4qxoCfVoQAvD_BwE&gad_source=1&gad_campaignid=22805676407&gbraid=0AAAAA-2etQjkn8ieDQVkZrtB_HYPkVQz6&gclid=CjwKCAjw_-3GBhAYEiwAjh9fUH0MDvZK-6mexjX2Ul0qkw0iO5R_XUSl-NfaitR-czFuIyPnl6P4qxoCfVoQAvD_BwE\" target=\"_blank\">Cline’s Visual Studio Code Extension</a>.  </p>\n<p>Fernandez said the company tried a lot of different open source coding tools before deciding to go with Cline partially due to its strong support of MCP, or the ability for AI models to securely communicate with external tools and data.  </p>\n<p>This release comes at an interesting time for the vibe coding industry.  </p>\n<p>Many vibe coding startups are continuing to raise large funding rounds at eye-watering valuations from investors. Vibe coding startup Lovable, for example, is allegedly <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/08/28/investors-are-loving-lovable/\" target=\"_blank\">turning down unsolicited funding offers from investors</a> after garnering a <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/07/17/lovable-becomes-a-unicorn-with-200m-series-a-just-8-months-after-launch/\" target=\"_blank\">$1.8 billion valuation</a> just eight months after launching.  </p>\n<p>Vibe coding startup Anything recently claimed to <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/09/29/vibe-coding-startup-anything-nabs-a-100m-valuation-after-hitting-2m-arr-in-its-first-two-weeks/\" target=\"_blank\">hit $2 million</a> in annual recurring revenue (ARR) just two weeks after launching. </p>\n<p>Despite the hype, the long-term success of these platforms is less clear. Due to the sheer volume of large language model usage required to run these platforms, costs for these companies are high and resulting margins are tight, <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/08/07/the-high-costs-and-thin-margins-threatening-ai-coding-startups/\" target=\"_blank\">TechCrunch reported in August</a>.  </p>\n<p>However, these cost pressures matter less when vibe coding is baked into a larger product suite as Salesforce’s Agentforce Vibes is.  </p>\n<p>Each Salesforce organization gets 50 requests per org per day using OpenAI’s GPT-5 model with additional requests after that going through a Salesforce-hosted Qwen 3.0 model. The company is currently offering Agentforce Vibes for free to its existing users with priced usage plans expected in the future. </p>\n</div><div>\n<div>\n\t\t<p>Becca is a senior writer at TechCrunch that covers venture capital trends and startups.

    "body": "<div>\n<p>Toyota is looking for the next new thing in mobility, climate, AI, and industrial automation. Its answer is $1.5 billion in new capital that will focus on, and invest in, the life cycle of startups — from the first seeds of an invention through its growth stage and eventually to mature companies.</p>\n<p>Toyota made two related announcements Tuesday that provide a snapshot of the company’s growing interest in the startup ecosystem. It also hints at how those startups, and their inventions, may play a part in Woven City, a prototype city located on a 175-acre site at the foot of Mount Fuji in Japan designed to incubate startups and that <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/01/06/toyotas-woven-city-is-open-for-business-and-looking-for-startups/\">opened this year</a>. </p>\n<p>The Japanese automaker said Tuesday it has created a strategic investment subsidiary called Toyota Invention Partners Co. with about $670 million in capital, while its growth-stage venture arm Woven Capital launched a second $800 million fund. </p>\n<p>The Toyota Invention Partners subsidiary will take a long-term strategy focused on Japan-based startups, eschewing the traditional fixed investment periods found in other funds. Woven Capital general partner George Kellerman described Toyota Invention Partners Co. as a bookend of sorts to the company’s other investment organizations.</p>\n<p>“One way to think about them (Toyota Invention Partners) is they’re bookending what Toyota Ventures and Woven Capital are doing,” Kellerman said in a phone interview. “They’re doing the really early stage on one end, but then they’re maybe doing these longer-term project finance, asset management type of infrastructure investments, that might be a 30-, 40-, 50-year type of investment.”</p>\n<p>Toyota Invention Partners is at the “zero to one” stage, Toyota Ventures covers early-stage, and Woven Capital handles growth stage, he explained. But Toyota Invention Partners may also stick with a startup throughout all of these stages, and if it really scales, it’ll go to the balance sheet of Toyota, Kellerman added.</p>\n<p>Kellerman said the two announcements reflect Toyota’s interest in startups — and the tech and innovation that is coming out of them.</p>\n<div>\n\t\t<p>Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t<p><span>San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>October 27-29, 2025</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n<p>“The thing that really excites me is that Toyota is clearly leaning in; they’re committing over $3 billion across Toyota Invention Partners, Woven Capital’s fund one and two, and all of Toyota Ventures funds,” he said. “And it’s really about making sure that we can serve the needs of the market and the founders that we’re working with, because their needs change depending on their stage.”</p>\n<p>This strategy is illustrated in another investment announcement that was made Tuesday. Machina Labs, a Los Angeles-based advanced manufacturing startup that combines AI and robotics to rapidly produce metal structures, announced a strategic investment from Woven Capital and a pilot project with Toyota Motor North America. The automaker will test Machina Labs’ manufacturing technology to produce automotive body panels and accessories. Woven Capital and Machina Labs didn’t disclose the investment amount or terms.</p>\n<p>Woven Capital, which launched in 2021 with an $800 million fund, is still focused on investing in global startups that are entering into a growth stage. The firm has invested in 18 companies from the first fund, including Foretellix and autonomous vehicle technology startup Nuro. It will continue to pull capital from the first fund to support follow-on investments. </p>\n<p>This second fund, which is also $800 million, will target 20 to 25 new investments in Series B to late-stage companies working on advancing AI, automation, climate technology, energy, sustainability, and more. As part of the new fund announcement, Woven Capital has also been made a wholly owned subsidiary of Toyota.</p>\n</div><div>\n<div><p>\n\t\tKirsten Korosec is a reporter and editor who has covered the future of transportation from EVs and autonomous vehicles to urban air mobility and in-car tech for more than a decade.
