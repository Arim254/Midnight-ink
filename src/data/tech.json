Following a period of rapid growth in the 2010s and during the pandemic, Schreier said gamers in recent years have “tended to stick with old favorites rather than purchasing new titles.”</p>\n<p>This seems to be reflected in EA’s fiscal year 2025, with 75% of revenue coming from live services rather than new purchases. In fact, analyst and Spilt Milk Studios co-founder Nicholas Lovell told Schreier, “We’re moving away from an era of breaking new ideas to people settling into the same games, spending money over and over again.”</p>\n<p>So Lovell suggested that EA executives might see the reported $50 billion price tag as the company’s “peak valuation,” as the industry enters a period where profits continue rising but valuations start to fall.</p>\n</div>"

    "body": "<div>\n<p>Manny Medina, previously best-known as the founder of sales automation startup Outreach ($4.4 billion valuation), has wowed investors with his young startup, Paid.</p>\n<p>Paid just closed an oversubscribed $21.6 million seed round led by Lightspeed. With the €10 million pre-seed round <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/03/25/outreach-founder-manny-medina-has-a-new-startup-that-helps-ai-agents-get-paid/\">it raised in March</a>, London-based Paid has already raised $33.3 million and hasn’t even hit its Series A yet. A source familiar with the deal says the startup’s valuation is over $100 million.</p>\n<p>Paid came out of stealth in March offering an interesting contribution to the AI agentic world: The company doesn’t offer agents. It offers a way for agent makers to charge their customers for these worker algorithms, based on the value their agents provide. This is a growing theme in AI, sometimes called “results-based billing.”</p>\n<p>Paid promises to help agent makers “start charging for points of margin saved by their customers,” Medina describes. </p>\n<p>It’s a new way of charging for software for the AI age. This is instead of the unlimited use, per-user fees of the SaaS era, or the unlimited use, buy-it-once-and-install-it fees of the client/server era. </p>\n<p>Per-user fees don’t work because agent makers pay usage fees to the model providers as well as to cloud providers. Unlimited use could drive them into the red. (The vibe coding startup world tends to suffer from this issue.) </p>\n<p>Agent providers instead “need to show the value the agent is delivering to your customers, because agents are running in the background for the most part,” Medina tells TechCrunch. If agents do work as advertised, then they’ll be assigned increasingly more, with their growing workloads going unnoticed.</p>\n<div>\n\t\t<p>Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t<p><span>San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>October 27-29, 2025</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n<p>“If you’re a quiet agent, you don’t get paid,” Madina says. “You need an infrastructure that allows the agent to charge for the additional work that the agent is doing,”  </p>\n<p>But charging a monthly fee for a limited number of credits — following the model makers and vibe coders — is risky for agent-makers, too. That’s because companies don’t want to pay for AI slop, which is still what most AI produces. After billions spent on AI pilots, some 95% of enterprise projects were found to have no value, with only 5% put into production, according to <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://mlq.ai/media/quarterly_decks/v0.1_State_of_AI_in_Business_2025_Report.pdf\">a recent study from MIT</a>.</p>\n<p>Companies don’t want to pay agents to produce more emails that no one reads. </p>\n<p>One of the startup’s early customers, for instance, is Artisan, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/04/09/artisan-the-stop-hiring-humans-ai-agent-startup-raises-25m-and-is-still-hiring-humans/\">the viral sales automation startup</a>. (By the way, you can hear Artisan’s CEO Jaspar Carmichael-Jack speak on the topic at <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-disrupt-2025/\">TechCrunch Disrupt</a> next month.) </p>\n<p>But Paid is also starting to see success with SaaS companies looking at agents for their next big growth. The startup just landed ERP vendor IFS as a new customer, it said. </p>\n<p>Lightspeed’s Alexander Schmitt says the venture firm has invested “more than $2.5 billion into AI infrastructure and application layer companies over the last three years,” and has witnessed firsthand that most AI pilots fail.  </p>\n<p>“The core of that problem is that no one can really attach value to what agents are doing today,” Schmitt said.  </p>\n<p>Schmitt thinks that Paid is, so far, unique in its approach, saying “it’s something that we haven’t seen someone else build.” No doubt more competition for agentic results-based billing will come if it really does help agents enter the workforce en mass.</p>\n<p>New investor FUSE and existing investor EQT Ventures also participated in the round. </p>\n</div>"

And it was later revealed that <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/09/24/oracle-is-reportedly-looking-to-raise-15b-in-corporate-bond-sale/\">Oracle sold $18 billion in bonds</a> to pay for these data centers.</p>\n<p>On their own, each deal is dizzying in scale.

The experience feels similar to a news app or a social feed — something you check first thing in the morning — but doesn’t have posts from other users or ads (yet).</p>\n<p>Pulse is part of a new class of OpenAI products that work independently, even when users aren’t in the ChatGPT app. The company would like to deliver a lot more of these features and roll them out to free users, but they’re limited by the number of computer servers available to them. OpenAI said it can only offer Pulse to its $200-a-month Pro subscribers right now due to capacity constraints.</p>\n<div>\n\t\t<p>Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t<p><span>San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>October 27-29, 2025</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n<p>The real question is whether features like Pulse are worth the hundreds of billions of dollars being invested in AI data centers to support OpenAI.

It’s a valuable enough company to have landed its founder and CEO <a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/profile/guillaume-pousaz/\" target=\"_blank\">Guillaume Pousaz</a> on Forbes’ billionaire list.</p>\n<p>On the other, there was a short period of time when Checkout.com was valued at <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/12/checkout-com-raises-1b-round-at-4/\">a whopping $40 billion</a>, as part of its $1 billion Series D round closed in 2022. By the end of that year, with the venture world crashing into a bear market, it had already internally <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2022/12/13/why-checkoutcom-lowered-its-internal-valuation/\">slashed its valuation to $11 billion</a>. And then it lowered its valuation again, to $9.35 billion in 2023, a company spokesperson told TechCrunch. </p>\n<p>So $12 billion represents a nearly 30% increase from its previous valuation.</p>\n<p>But this valuation isn’t being obtained because an investor is plunking down cash. The company is the only one buying employee shares back, with no other investors involved in a tender offer, the spokesperson tells us. Instead, the valuation comes from a 409A valuation, the person said. That’s an assessment made by an independent third-party. It’s not the same as a vote of confidence from a professional investor, but it’s also not simply the company giving itself a bump.</p>\n<p>In fairness, Checkout.com’s archrival Stripe also had its own valuation setback during the same venture capital bear market, crashing from $95 billion at the height of the froth in 2021,<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2023/03/15/stripe-now-valued-at-50b-following-6-5b-raise/\"> to $50 billion during the doldrums in 2023.</a> Stripe has since clawed its way back<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/02/27/stripe-finalizes-tender-sale-at-a-91-5b-valuation-says-payment-volumes-grew-to-1-4t-in-2024/\"> to $91.5 billion as of February</a> through its own series of employee tender offers. Stripe, however, did have outside investors helping to value it. And, Stripe is rumored to be working on yet another tender offer at a $106.7 billion valuation, Axios just <a href=\"https://www.axios.com/2025/09/23/stripe-buy-back-stock-vc\" target=\"_blank\">reported.</a>  </p>\n<p>Yet just because Checkout.com is competing against one of the most highly valued startups of all time, doesn’t minimize its own business achievements. </p>\n<p>The London-based payments company, which is a popular choice among large e-commerce sites like eBay and Pinterest, said it was starting to be profitable by the end of 2024 and is on track for a full year of profitability in 2025. Checkout.com says it processes about $1 billion worth of e-commerce payments a day and hired 300 more employees this year, bringing headcount to 2,000 people across 19 global offices. </p>\n<p>Checkout.com also tells TechCrunch that employees with tenure of at least a year will be eligible for the buyback program, but declined to indicate the size of the buyback, either in total spend or number of shares.</p>\n<p><em>Note: This story was updated with more information about the previous valuation.</em></p>\n</div>"

The strategy involves acquiring mature professional services firms, implementing AI to automate tasks, then using the improved cash flow to roll up more companies.</p>\n<p>Leading the charge is General Catalyst (GC), which has dedicated $1.5 billion of its latest fundraise to what it calls a “creation” strategy that’s focused on incubating AI-native software companies in specific verticals, then using those companies as acquisition vehicles to buy established firms — and their customers — in the same sectors. GC has placed bets across seven industries, from legal services to IT management, with plans to expand to up to 20 sectors altogether.</p>\n<p>“Services globally is a $16 trillion revenue a year globally,” said <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.generalcatalyst.com/team/marc-bhargava\">Marc Bhargava</a>, who leads GC’s related efforts, in a <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/general-catalysts-plan-to-eat-the-%2416-trillion/id1498270180?i=1000725773510\">recent interview with TechCrunch</a>. “In comparison, software is only $1 trillion globally,” he noted, adding that the allure of software investing has always been its higher margins. “As you get software to scale, there’s very little marginal cost and there’s a great deal of marginal revenue.” </p>\n<p>If you can automate services business, too, he said – tackling 30% to 50% of those companies with AI, and even automating up to 70% of those core tasks in the case of call centers – the math begins to look irresistible.</p>\n<p>The game plan seems to be working right now. Take <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.crn.com/news/channel-news/2025/titan-scores-74m-funding-to-build-ai-platform-and-acquire-msps-to-use-it\">Titan MSP</a>, one of GC’s portfolio companies. The investment firm provided $74 million over two tranches to help the company develop AI tools for managed service providers, then it acquired RFA, a well-known IT services firm. Through pilot programs, says Bhargava, Titan demonstrated it could automate 38% of typical MSP tasks. The company now plans to use its improved margins to acquire additional MSPs in a classic roll-up strategy.</p>\n<p>Similarly, the firm incubated <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/eudia-secures-up-to-105m-in-series-a-funding-led-by-general-catalyst-to-transform-legal-work-through-ai-powered-augmented-intelligence-302375331.html\">Eudia</a>, which focuses on in-house legal departments rather than law firms. Eudia has signed up Fortune 100 clients including Chevron, Southwest Airlines, and Stripe, offering fixed-fee legal services powered by AI rather than traditional hourly billing. The company recently acquired Johnson Hanna, an alternative legal service provider, to expand its reach.</p>\n<p>GC looks to double – at least – the EBITDA margin of those companies that it’s acquiring, Bhargava explained.</p>\n<div>\n\t\t<p>Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t<p><span>San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>October 27-29, 2025</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n<p>The powerhouse firm isn’t alone in its thinking. The venture firm Mayfield has carved out $100 million specifically for “AI teammates” investments, including Gruve, an IT consulting startup that acquired a $5 million security consulting company, then grew it to $15 million in revenue within six months while achieving an 80% gross margin, according to its founders.</p>\n<p>“If 80% of the work will be done by AI, it can have an 80% to 90% gross margin,” Navin Chaddha, Mayfield’s managing director, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/06/29/why-ai-will-eat-mckinseys-lunch-but-not-today/\">told TechCrunch this summer</a>. “You could have blended margins of 60% to 70% and produce 20% to 30% net income.”</p>\n<p>Solo investor Elad Gil has been pursuing a similar strategy for three years, backing companies that acquire mature businesses and transform them with AI. “If you own the asset, you can [transform it] much more rapidly than if you’re just selling software as a vendor,” Gil said in an <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/06/01/early-ai-investor-elad-gil-finds-his-next-big-bet-ai-powered-rollups/\">interview with TechCrunch this spring</a>. </p>\n<p>But early warning signs suggest this whole services-industry metamorphosis may be <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/09/27/beware-coworkers-who-produce-ai-generated-workslop/\">more complicated</a> than VCs anticipate. A recent study by researchers at Stanford Social Media Lab and BetterUp Labs that surveyed 1,150 full-time employees across industries found that 40% of those employees are having to shoulder more work because of what the researchers call “workslop” – AI-generated work that appears polished but lacks substance, creating more work (and headaches) for colleagues.</p>\n<p>The trend is taking a toll on the organizations. Employees involved in the survey say they’re spending an average of nearly two hours dealing with each instance of workslop, including to first decipher it, then decide whether or not to send it back, and oftentimes just to fix it themselves. </p>\n<p>Based on those participants’ estimates of time spent, along with their self-reported salaries, the authors of the survey estimate that workslop carries an invisible tax of $186 per month per person. “For an organization of 10,000 workers, given the estimated prevalence of workslop . . .this yields over <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://hbr.org/2025/09/ai-generated-workslop-is-destroying-productivity\">$9 million per year in lost productivity</a>,” they write in a new Harvard Business Review article.</p>\n<p>Bhargava disputed the notion that AI is overhyped, arguing instead that all these implementation failures actually validate GC’s approach. “I think it kind of shows the opportunity, which is, it’s not easy to apply AI technology to these businesses,” he said. “If all the Fortune 100 and all these folks could just bring in a consulting firm, slap on some AI, get a contract with OpenAI, and transform their business, then obviously our thesis [would be] a little bit less robust. But the reality is, it’s really hard to transform a company with AI.”</p>\n<p>He pointed to the technical sophistication required in AI as the most critical missing puzzle piece. “There’s a lot of different technology. It’s good at different things,” he said. “You really need these applied AI engineers from places like Rippling and Ramp and Figma and Scale, who have worked with the different models, understand their nuances, understand which ones are good for what, understand how to wrap it in software.” That complexity is exactly why GC’s strategy of pairing AI specialists with industry experts to build companies from the ground up makes sense, he argued.</p>\n<p>Still, there’s no denying that workslop threatens to undermine — to some extent — the strategy’s core economics. Even if a holding company is created as starting point, if the acquired companies reduce staff as the AI efficiency thesis suggests they should, they’ll have fewer people available to catch and correct AI-generated errors. If the companies maintain current staffing levels to handle the additional work created by problematic AI output, the huge margin gains that VCs are counting on might never be realized.</p>\n<p>Arguably, these scenarios should perhaps slow the scaling plans that are central to the VCs’ roll-up strategies and that potentially undermine the numbers that make these deals attractive to them. But let’s face it; it will take more than a study or <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.axios.com/2025/08/21/ai-wall-street-big-tech\">two</a> to slow down most Silicon Valley investors.</p>\n<p>In fact, because they typically acquire businesses with existing cash flow, GC says its “creation strategy” companies are already profitable — a marked departure from the traditional VC playbook of backing high-growth, cash-burning startups. It’s also likely a welcome change for the limited partners behind venture firms, who have bankrolled years of losses at companies that never reached profitability.</p>\n<p>“As long as AI technology continues to improve, and we see this massive investment and improvement in the models,” Bhargava said, “I think there’ll just be more and more industries for us to help incubate companies.”</p>\n</div>"

    "description": "Brooks, who co-founded iRobot and spent decades at MIT, is particularly skeptical of companies like Tesla and Figure trying to teach robots dexterity by showing them videos of humans doing tasks. In a new essay, he calls this approach \"pure fantasy thinking.\"",
    "body": "<div>\n<p>Renowned roboticist Rodney Brooks has a wake-up call for investors funneling <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/09/16/figure-reaches-39b-valuation-in-latest-funding-round/\">billions</a> into humanoid robot startups: you’re wasting your money.</p>\n<p>Brooks, who co-founded iRobot and spent decades at MIT, is particularly skeptical of companies like Tesla and the high-profile AI robotics company Figure trying to teach robots dexterity by showing them videos of humans doing tasks. <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://rodneybrooks.com/why-todays-humanoids-wont-learn-dexterity/\">In a new essay</a>, he calls this approach “pure fantasy thinking.”</p>\n<p>The problem? Human hands are incredibly sophisticated, packed with about 17,000 specialized touch receptors that no robot comes close to matching. While machine learning transformed speech recognition and image processing, those breakthroughs built on decades of existing technology for capturing the right data. “We don’t have such a tradition for touch data,” Brooks points out.</p>\n<p>Then there’s safety. Full-sized walking humanoid robots pump massive amounts of energy into staying upright. When they fall, they’re dangerous. Physics means a robot twice the size of today’s models would pack eight times the harmful energy.</p>\n<p>Brooks predicts that in 15 years, successful “humanoid” robots will actually have wheels, multiple arms, and specialized sensors and abandon the human form. Meanwhile, he’s thoroughly convinced that today’s billions are funding expensive training experiments that will never scale to mass production.</p>\n<p>It’s far from the first time Brooks has poured cold water on expectations set by brash entrepreneurs and eager investors. Last year, he <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/06/29/mit-robotics-pioneer-rodney-brooks-thinks-people-are-vastly-overestimating-generative-ai/\">talked at length</a> with TechCrunch about why the promise of generative AI exceeds its abilities and can even create more work in some cases. </p>\n<p>For example, the AI research nonprofit METR said this summer it had recruited 16 highly rated developers from large open-source repositories to measure the impacts of AI tools on real-world software development. It then assigned them nearly 250 real issues to address with the tools and without them, and measured their screens. When the developers used the AI tools, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://metr.org/blog/2025-07-10-early-2025-ai-experienced-os-dev-study/\">they took 19% longer</a> to complete their tasks. As interestingly, they perceived that the AI had sped them up by 20%. </p>\n<div>\n\t\t<p>Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t<p><span>San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>October 27-29, 2025</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n<p>Brooks has also long argued that AI is not the existential threat that many, including Elon Musk, have posited that it is. TechCrunch talked with Brooks about this <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2017/07/19/this-famous-roboticist-doesnt-think-elon-musk-understands-ai/\">back in 2017</a> at MIT, when the landscape looked very different but not entirely dissimilar to today’s playing field.</p>\n<p>At the time, Brooks said he was just starting to see more companies specializing in making data sets for machine learning — a trend that has only continued. Relatedly, he argued why it wasn’t necessarily a foregone conclusion that Big Tech companies would win in robotics, despite what long ago seemed an unsurmountable lead in the amount of data they control. Yet today’s leading robotics companies have not escaped those companies’ gravitational pull.  </p>\n<p>Apptronik, a humanoid robot maker that has raised nearly $450 million from investors, counts Google among its backers and partnered with Google’s DeepMind robotics team late last year to “bring together best-in-class artificial intelligence with cutting-edge hardware and embodied intelligence.”</p>\n<p>Figure, similarly, is backed in part by Microsoft and OpenAI Startup Fund and partnered with OpenAI in February 2024 to combine OpenAI’s research with its own “deep understanding of robotics hardware and software.” The two split up almost exactly a year later, this past March, with FigureAI saying it had enjoyed a “major breakthrough” in its own in-house, end-to-end AI for robotics.</p>\n<p>Earlier this month, Figure announced it had received over $1 billion in committed capital in its latest funding round and said the deal valued the company at at an astonishing <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/09/16/figure-reaches-39b-valuation-in-latest-funding-round/\">$39 billion</a>.</p>\n</div><div>\n<div><p>\n\t\tLoizos has been reporting on Silicon Valley since the late ’90s, when she joined the original Red Herring magazine.

    "body": "<div>\n<p>It takes a lot of computing power to run an AI product — and as the tech industry races to tap the power of AI models, there’s a parallel race underway to build the infrastructure that will power them. On a recent earnings call, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang estimated that between $3 trillion and $4 trillion will be spent on AI infrastructure by the end of the decade — with much of that money coming from AI companies. Along the way, they’re placing immense strain on power grids and pushing the industry’s building capacity to its limit.</p>\n<p>Below, we’ve laid out everything we know about the biggest AI infrastructure projects, including major spending from Meta, Oracle, Microsoft, Google, and OpenAI. We’ll keep it updated as the boom continues and the numbers climb even higher.</p>\n<h2 id=\"h-microsoft-s-1-billion-investment-in-openai\">Microsoft’s $1 billion investment in OpenAI</h2>\n<p>This is arguably the deal that kicked off the whole contemporary AI boom: <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2019/7/22/20703578/microsoft-openai-investment-partnership-1-billion-azure-artificial-general-intelligence-agi\" target=\"_blank\">In 2019</a>, Microsoft made a $1 billion investment in a buzzy non-profit called OpenAI, known mostly for its association with Elon Musk. Crucially, the deal made Microsoft the exclusive cloud provider for OpenAI — and as the demands of model training became more intense, more of Microsoft’s investment started to come <a href=\"https://www.semafor.com/article/11/18/2023/openai-has-received-just-a-fraction-of-microsofts-10-billion-investment\" target=\"_blank\">in the form of Azure cloud credit</a> rather than cash. </p>\n<p>It was a great deal for both sides: Microsoft was able to claim more Azure sales, and OpenAI got more money for its biggest single expense. In the years that followed, Microsoft would build its investment up to nearly $14 billion — a move that is set to pay off enormously when OpenAI converts into a for-profit company.</p>\n<p>The partnership between the two companies has unwound more recently. In January, OpenAI announced it would <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/01/21/microsoft-is-no-longer-openais-exclusive-cloud-provider/\">no longer be using Microsoft’s cloud exclusively</a>, instead giving the company a right of first refusal on future infrastructure demands but pursuing others if Azure couldn’t meet their needs. More recently, Microsoft began exploring other foundation models to power its AI products, establishing even more independence from the AI giant.</p>\n<p>OpenAI’s arrangement with Microsoft was so successful that it’s become a common practice for AI services to sign on with a particular cloud provider. Anthropic has received $8 billion in investment from Amazon, while <a href=\"https://www.anthropic.com/news/anthropic-amazon-trainium\" target=\"_blank\">making kernel-level modifications</a> on the company’s hardware to make it better suited for AI training. Google Cloud has also signed on <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/09/18/how-ai-startups-are-fueling-googles-booming-cloud-business/\">smaller AI companies like Lovable and Windsurf</a> as “primary computing partners,” although those deals did not involve any investment. And even OpenAI has gone back to the well, receiving a $100 billion investment from Nvidia <a href=\"https://finance.yahoo.com/news/nvidia-stock-jumps-on-100-billion-openai-investment-171740706.html\" target=\"_blank\">in September</a>, giving it capacity to buy even more of the company’s GPUs.</p>\n<h2 id=\"h-the-rise-of-oracle\">The rise of Oracle</h2>\n<p>On June 30, 2025, Oracle revealed in an SEC filing that it had signed a $30 billion cloud services deal with an unnamed partner; this is more than the company’s cloud revenues for all of the previous fiscal year. OpenAI was eventually revealed as the partner, securing Oracle <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2025/07/16/openai-googles-cloud-chatgpt.html\" target=\"_blank\">a spot alongside Google</a> as one of OpenAI’s string of post-Microsoft hosting partners. Unsurprisingly, the company’s stock went shooting up.</p>\n<div>\n\t\t<p>Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t<p><span>San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>October 27-29, 2025</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n<p>A few months later, it happened again. <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/09/10/openai-and-oracle-reportedly-ink-historic-cloud-computing-deal/\">On September 10</a>, Oracle revealed a five-year, $300 billion deal for compute power, set to begin in 2027. Oracle’s stock <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/09/12/why-the-oracle-openai-deal-caught-wall-street-by-surprise/\">climbed even higher</a>, briefly making founder Larry Ellison the richest man in the world. The sheer scale of the deal is stunning: OpenAI does not have $300 billion to spend, so the figure presumes immense growth for both companies, and more than a little faith. </p>\n<p>But before a single dollar is spent, the deal has already cemented Oracle as one of the leading AI infrastructure providers — and a financial force to be reckoned with.</p>\n<h2 id=\"h-building-tomorrow-s-hyperscale-data-centers\">Building tomorrow’s hyperscale data centers</h2>\n<p>For companies like Meta that already have <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://cacm.acm.org/research/metas-hyperscale-infrastructure-overview-and-insights/\">significant legacy infrastructure</a>, the story is more complicated — although equally expensive. Mark Zuckerberg has said that Meta plans to spend $600 billion on U.S. infrastructure <a href=\"https://www.theinformation.com/briefings/meta-plans-spend-600-billion-2028-u-s-zuckerberg-says\" target=\"_blank\">through the end of 2028</a>. </p>\n<p>In just the first half of 2025, the company spent <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/07/30/meta-to-spend-up-to-72b-on-ai-infrastructure-in-2025-as-compute-arms-race-escalates/\">$30 billion more</a> than the previous year, driven largely by the company’s growing AI ambitions. Some of that spending goes toward big ticket cloud contracts, like a recent <a href=\"https://aimagazine.com/news/inside-metas-cloud-deal-with-google-for-ai-infrastructure\" target=\"_blank\">$10 billion deal with Google Cloud</a>, but even more resources are being poured into two massive new data centers. </p>\n<p>A new 2,250-acre site in Louisiana, <a href=\"https://www.datacenterfrontier.com/hyperscale/article/55248311/meta-sees-10b-ai-data-center-in-louisiana-using-combo-of-clean-energy-nuclear-power\" target=\"_blank\">dubbed Hyperion</a>, will cost an estimated $10 billion to build out and <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/07/14/mark-zuckerberg-says-meta-is-building-a-5gw-ai-data-center/\">provide an estimated 5 gigawatts of compute power</a>. Notably, the site includes an arrangement with a local nuclear power plant to handle the increased energy load. A smaller site in Ohio, called Prometheus, is expected to come online in 2026, powered by natural gas. </p>\n<p>That kind of buildout comes with real environmental costs. Elon Musk’s xAI built its own hybrid data center and power-generation plant in South Memphis, Tennessee. The plant has quickly become one of the county’s largest emitters of smog-producing chemicals, thanks to a string of natural gas turbines that <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.politico.com/news/2025/05/06/elon-musk-xai-memphis-gas-turbines-air-pollution-permits-00317582?fbclid=IwZXh0bgNhZW0CMTEAAR5SDS-dmGr0PSpTHkF5PV2cXs3-rKqNuPaMbeyJmaGGE56-qWvJrA29i9S4pg_aem_leaKorFEsIQuzImIDd960A\">experts say violate the Clean Air Act</a>.</p>\n<h2 id=\"h-the-stargate-moonshot\">The Stargate moonshot</h2>\n<p>Just two days after his second inauguration, President Trump announced a joint venture between SoftBank, OpenAI, and Oracle, meant to spend $500 billion building AI infrastructure in the United States. Named “Stargate” after the 1994 film, the project arrived with incredible amounts of hype, with Trump calling it “the largest AI infrastructure project in history. Sam Altman seemed to agree, saying, ​​”I think this will be the most important project of this era.” </p>\n<p>In broad strokes, the plan was for SoftBank to provide the funding, with Oracle handling the buildout with input from OpenAI. Overseeing it all was Trump, who promised to clear away any regulatory hurdles that might slow down the build. But there were doubts from the beginning, including from Elon Musk, Altman’s business rival, who claimed the project did not have the available funds.</p>\n<p>As the hype has died down, the project has lost some momentum. <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-08-07/softbank-concedes-stargate-project-with-openai-needs-more-time\" target=\"_blank\">In August</a>, Bloomberg reported that the partners were failing to reach consensus. Nonetheless, the project has moved forward with the construction of <a href=\"https://www.bigcountryhomepage.com/news/stargate-abilene/abilenes-data-center-advances-swiftly-with-5000-workers/\" target=\"_blank\">eight data centers in Abilene, Texas</a>, with construction on the final building set to be finished by the end of 2026.</p>\n<p><em>This article was first published on September 22.</em></p>\n</div>"
