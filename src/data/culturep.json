    "description": "The streamer has launched a new tool it claims can predict which film or show you’re going to love based on astrology",
    "body": "<div><p><span>A</span>s you will already be aware, one of the downsides of the streaming era is decision paralysis. In times gone by, people would watch television by simply turning their television on, watching whatever was showing at that precise moment and then complaining about it. But now, as you find yourself forced to pick from every single film and series ever made, you feel overwhelmed. You spend entire evenings scrolling through submenu after submenu, glazing over as your inability to find something to watch ossifies into dissociative panic.</p><figure></figure><p>The challenge for the streamers is how to effectively curate this infinite content. In the past they have done this by prioritising new releases, or showing you what everyone else is watching, or sharpening their algorithms to second-guess what you want to watch based on what you have already watched. But finally – finally – <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/netflix\">Netflix</a> has cracked it. And it has achieved this with science.</p><p>Sorry, not science, <em>bullshit</em>. Because this weekend Netflix officially launched its <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.netflix.com/browse/genre/82115657\">Astrology Hub</a>. Now, after all these years, subscribers can at last pick something to watch based on a loose collection of personality quirks determined by the position of the planets at the time of their birth. Doesn’t that sound great?</p><p>So, for instance, I am a Leo. And this means that, when I enter the Netflix Astrology Hub and scroll down a bit, I am informed that “Leos have main character energy”. And as such, it means I should watch The Crown, or The King, or Queen Charlotte: A Bridgerton Story, or Emily in Paris, or The Kissing Booth 2, or that Cilla Black biopic that ITV made a few years ago. And I think that, as a heterosexual 45-year-old man, Netflix has absolutely cracked it.</p><p>Sure, I have already watched most of these for work, and I flat-out disliked almost all of them. But if Netflix says that every single person born within a specific window has the exact same personality, then sure. Tonight, after flopping down on to my sofa at the end of another long day trying to locate the right balance between quality family time and the financial imperative to work, I will watch Emily in bloody Paris. And I will like it, because Netflix told me that I would.</p><figure><div><picture><source srcset=\"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0a785b737badec37ebe1627421d4a7a718986708/0_0_1372_792/master/1372.jpg?width=620&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none\" media=\"(min-width: 660px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 660px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)\"></source><source srcset=\"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0a785b737badec37ebe1627421d4a7a718986708/0_0_1372_792/master/1372.jpg?width=620&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none\" media=\"(min-width: 660px)\"></source><source srcset=\"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0a785b737badec37ebe1627421d4a7a718986708/0_0_1372_792/master/1372.jpg?width=605&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none\" media=\"(min-width: 480px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 480px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)\"></source><source srcset=\"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0a785b737badec37ebe1627421d4a7a718986708/0_0_1372_792/master/1372.jpg?width=605&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none\" media=\"(min-width: 480px)\"></source><source srcset=\"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0a785b737badec37ebe1627421d4a7a718986708/0_0_1372_792/master/1372.jpg?width=445&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none\" media=\"(min-width: 320px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 320px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)\"></source><source srcset=\"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0a785b737badec37ebe1627421d4a7a718986708/0_0_1372_792/master/1372.jpg?width=445&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none\" media=\"(min-width: 320px)\"></source><img alt=\"Netflix’s astrology hub\" src=\"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0a785b737badec37ebe1627421d4a7a718986708/0_0_1372_792/master/1372.jpg?width=445&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none\" /></picture></div><figcaption><span><svg width=\"18\" height=\"13\"></svg></span><span>Netflix’s astrology hub.</span> Photograph: Netflix</figcaption></figure><p>Now, the naysayers among you will point out that all these choices seem geared to appeal to young girls, because young girls are statistically the demographic most likely to believe in the zodiac, and so the Netflix Astrology Hub is essentially just a bit of a grift designed to push content at one specific group. And you might even go further, by pointing out that astrology is a pseudoscience that has repeatedly proved itself to have no scientific validity whatsoever. To which I respond: of course you think that, you’re a Virgo.</p><p>And anyway, if there is any message at all behind the Netflix Astrology Hub, it is this: just be grateful that you’re not an Aquarius. Because while the other signs get off relatively lightly – Sagittarians (“bring adventure”) get Indiana Jones and the Spider-Verse, Capricorns (“activate boss mode”) get Hostage and Blackberry, and Virgos (“always hustling”) get Beef and Oppenheimer, the Aquarians are left to mournfully sift through the scraps.</p><p>Aquarians, according to Netflix, are “otherworldly” and that means their recommendations include the worst Men in Black film, the terrible Battleship film, a bizarre South Korean drama about a gynaecologist who falls in love on a space station and, of course, Rebel Moon: Part One – A Child of Fire. Does this seem like a deliberate decision on the part of Netflix to alienate a full 12th of its subscriber base? Probably, but maybe Aquarians lap this stuff up. I’m not a scientist, so I don’t know.</p><p>But, still, here we are. Netflix has access to an almost unparalleled set of highly tailored data points about every single one of its subscribers. It knows what you watch, when you watch it and for how long. It knows, with granular precision, more about your viewing habits than you ever will. It changes the image for each piece of content it has, based on your specific desires, to better maximise clicks. By harnessing this universe of data, Netflix is able to individually drip-feed shows and films to you with such dead-on accuracy that it feels like magic. But, in a way, isn’t it better to just blankly state that all Libras like Peaky Blinders and be done with it? I am willing to say yes it is.</p></div>"

Think of it as a witty, tragic mix of <i>The Real Housewives of New York</i> and <i>The Gilded Age</i>. It’s the 1890s and socialite Lily Bart, 29, is secretly broke, battling a gambling addiction, aging out of the marriage market and hung up on a not-rich-enough (for her upper-class needs) lawyer. Her fortunes sink further after she appears scantily clad in a tableau vivant at a social event, rousing the affections of her lawyer but plunging her lower on the social scale. Lily trusts all the wrong people; her troubles multiply, and she starts abusing drugs. Near the tragic end, Lily confesses, “I have tried hard — but life is difficult, and I am a very useless person.” Sob! Alternatively (or also), read Wharton’s 1921 Pulitzer Prize winner, <i>The Age of Innocence</i>.  </p>\n            <h3><b><i>Rebecca</i></b> <b>by Daphne du Maurier (1938)</b></h3>\n            <div>\n    <div>\n             <p><img src=\"https://cdn.aarp.net/etc/uxdia/images/uxdia-spinner.svg\" /></p><picture>\n                        <source media=\"(max-width: 375px)\" srcset=\"https://aarp.widen.net/content/o27rwfnoe8/jpeg/9781101907870.jpg?anchor=15,0&amp;q=80&amp;color=ffffffff&amp;u=tltj5m&amp;w=375\"></source>\n                        <source media=\"\r\n(max-width: 425px)\" srcset=\"https://aarp.widen.net/content/o27rwfnoe8/jpeg/9781101907870.jpg?anchor=15,0&amp;q=80&amp;color=ffffffff&amp;u=tltj5m&amp;w=425\"></source>\n                        <source media=\"\r\n(max-width: 768px)\" srcset=\"https://aarp.widen.net/content/o27rwfnoe8/jpeg/9781101907870.jpg?anchor=15,0&amp;q=80&amp;color=ffffffff&amp;u=tltj5m&amp;w=688\"></source>\n                        <img src=\"https://aarp.widen.net/content/o27rwfnoe8/jpeg/9781101907870.jpg?crop=true&amp;anchor=15,0&amp;q=80&amp;color=ffffffff&amp;u=tltj5m&amp;w=1262&amp;h=2048\" alt=\"the cover of rebecca by daphne du maurier\" title=\"10 Must-Read Classic Novels\" />\n                </picture> \n    </div>\n            <div>\n    <p>\n        Penguin Random House\n    </p>\n                </div>\n    </div>\n            <p>The famous first line of du Maurier’s gothic thriller about corrosive jealousy — “Last night I dreamt I went to Manderley again” — is said by our female narrator, a reference to the mansion known as Manderley on England’s Cornwall coast, where she arrived as a newlywed years prior. Known only as the second Mrs. de Winter, our then-young narrator impetuously married an older, wealthier widower, Maxim de Winter, with whom she came to reside in this haunted home by the sea. Manderley’s formidable housekeeper, Mrs. Danvers, makes it clear that she reveres the seemingly perfect first Mrs. de Winter, the titular Rebecca, who reportedly died in a sailing accident. As our narrator becomes convinced that Maxim could never love her as he loved the beautiful Rebecca, a shipwreck in the bay reveals even harsher truths. The Academy Award-winning 1940 Hitchcock film is also a classic, albeit one with a less brutal ending than this page-turner. </p>\n            <h3><b><i>Dracula</i></b> <b>by Bram Stoker (1897)</b></h3>\n            <div>\n    <div>\n             <p><img src=\"https://cdn.aarp.net/etc/uxdia/images/uxdia-spinner.svg\" /></p><picture>\n                        <source media=\"(max-width: 375px)\" srcset=\"https://aarp.widen.net/content/dhgkel9qoa/jpeg/cvr9780743477369_9780743477369_hr.jpg?anchor=4,0&amp;q=80&amp;color=ffffffff&amp;u=tltj5m&amp;w=375\"></source>\n                        <source media=\"\r\n(max-width: 425px)\" srcset=\"https://aarp.widen.net/content/dhgkel9qoa/jpeg/cvr9780743477369_9780743477369_hr.jpg?anchor=4,0&amp;q=80&amp;color=ffffffff&amp;u=tltj5m&amp;w=425\"></source>\n                        <source media=\"\r\n(max-width: 768px)\" srcset=\"https://aarp.widen.net/content/dhgkel9qoa/jpeg/cvr9780743477369_9780743477369_hr.jpg?anchor=4,0&amp;q=80&amp;color=ffffffff&amp;u=tltj5m&amp;w=688\"></source>\n                        <img src=\"https://aarp.widen.net/content/dhgkel9qoa/jpeg/cvr9780743477369_9780743477369_hr.jpg?crop=true&amp;anchor=4,0&amp;q=80&amp;color=ffffffff&amp;u=tltj5m&amp;w=1247&amp;h=2025\" alt=\"the cover of dracula by bram stoker\" title=\"10 Must-Read Classic Novels\" />\n                </picture> \n    </div>\n            <div>\n    <p>\n        Simon and Schuster\n    </p>\n                </div>\n    </div>\n            <p>Irish author Stoker introduces us to Count Dracula at his Transylvanian castle, where solicitor Jonathan Harker is helping him prepare for a move to England. Poor Harker: Dracula leaves him imprisoned in the castle with three bloodthirsty vampire women and sets sail for his new home. The vessel crashes into a pier in Whidby, England, with no crew members and a large, doglike creature, which jumps ashore and flees. It’s not long before Lucy, a sleepwalking maiden in town, manifests a strange illness involving, yes, blood loss. The drama continues in this wildly influential classic, whose action unfolds in part through diary entries by three people: Harker; Lucy’s friend and Harker’s fiancée, Mina; and Lucy’s suitor Dr. Seward. Each character contributes their puzzling bit of the story, so the book almost reads like the script of a true-crime podcast.

His first and most autobiographical published book, <i>Go Tell It on the Mountain </i>focuses on a day in the life of John Grimes, a 14-year-old boy in 1935 Harlem, and uses flashbacks to fill in his family’s Great Migration backstory. Baldwin explores John’s sexuality, his place in the Pentecostal church, his reality as a Black teen marginalized by his poverty and race, and his domination by a cruel preacher father. <i>Time</i> listed it among the 100 best novels of all time, noting that the stories of John and his family members “run dark and deep, while the fierce music of Baldwin’s voice courses through those stories and lends them majesty.”</p>\n            <h3><b><i>To the Lighthouse</i></b> <b>by Virginia Woolf (1927)</b></h3>\n            <div>\n    <div>\n             <p><img src=\"https://cdn.aarp.net/etc/uxdia/images/uxdia-spinner.svg\" /></p><picture>\n                        <source media=\"(max-width: 375px)\" srcset=\"https://aarp.widen.net/content/upkhm3oint/jpeg/to-the-lighthouse-9781667202143_hr.jpg?anchor=0,0&amp;q=80&amp;color=ffffffff&amp;u=tltj5m&amp;w=375\"></source>\n                        <source media=\"\r\n(max-width: 425px)\" srcset=\"https://aarp.widen.net/content/upkhm3oint/jpeg/to-the-lighthouse-9781667202143_hr.jpg?anchor=0,0&amp;q=80&amp;color=ffffffff&amp;u=tltj5m&amp;w=425\"></source>\n                        <source media=\"\r\n(max-width: 768px)\" srcset=\"https://aarp.widen.net/content/upkhm3oint/jpeg/to-the-lighthouse-9781667202143_hr.jpg?anchor=0,0&amp;q=80&amp;color=ffffffff&amp;u=tltj5m&amp;w=688\"></source>\n                        <img src=\"https://aarp.widen.net/content/upkhm3oint/jpeg/to-the-lighthouse-9781667202143_hr.jpg?crop=true&amp;anchor=0,0&amp;q=80&amp;color=ffffffff&amp;u=tltj5m&amp;w=1371&amp;h=2048\" alt=\"the cover of to the lighthouse by virginia woolf\" title=\"10 Must-Read Classic Novels\" />\n                </picture> \n    </div>\n            <div>\n    <p>\n        Simon and Schuster\n    </p>\n                </div>\n    </div>\n            <p><i>Mrs. Dalloway</i>, Woolf’s modernist breakthrough, has rightly drawn attention this year for turning 100, but don’t overlook her later novel, <i>To the Lighthouse</i>, a moving meditation on time, love and connection. Divided into three parts, it’s centered around a wealthy family’s summer retreats to the Isle of Skye in Scotland in 1910 and 1920. Circumstances change for Mr. and Mrs. Ramsay, their eight children, and a handful of friends and acquaintances in the ten-year span between visits — a span that includes the First World War and its aftermath. The stream-of-consciousness, omniscient point of view jumps from the empath Mrs. Ramsay to her children, her husband, their guests and a housekeeper. In the introduction to a 1981 printing, the Pulitzer Prize-winning writer Eudora Welty wrote that Woolf “has shown us the shape of the human spirit.”  </p>\n            <h3><b><i>1984</i></b> <b>by George Orwell (1949)</b></h3>\n            <div>\n    <div>\n             <p><img src=\"https://cdn.aarp.net/etc/uxdia/images/uxdia-spinner.svg\" /></p><picture>\n                        <source media=\"(max-width: 375px)\" srcset=\"https://aarp.widen.net/content/amrdxsdmqs/jpeg/9780452284234.jpg?anchor=10,0&amp;q=80&amp;color=ffffffff&amp;u=tltj5m&amp;w=375\"></source>\n                        <source media=\"\r\n(max-width: 425px)\" srcset=\"https://aarp.widen.net/content/amrdxsdmqs/jpeg/9780452284234.jpg?anchor=10,0&amp;q=80&amp;color=ffffffff&amp;u=tltj5m&amp;w=425\"></source>\n                        <source media=\"\r\n(max-width: 768px)\" srcset=\"https://aarp.widen.net/content/amrdxsdmqs/jpeg/9780452284234.jpg?anchor=10,0&amp;q=80&amp;color=ffffffff&amp;u=tltj5m&amp;w=688\"></source>\n                        <img src=\"https://aarp.widen.net/content/amrdxsdmqs/jpeg/9780452284234.jpg?crop=true&amp;anchor=10,0&amp;q=80&amp;color=ffffffff&amp;u=tltj5m&amp;w=1371&amp;h=2048\" alt=\"the cover of nineteen eighty four by george orwell\" title=\"10 Must-Read Classic Novels\" />\n                </picture> \n    </div>\n            <div>\n    <p>\n        Penguin Random House\n    </p>\n                </div>\n    </div>\n            <p>This dystopian story set in an authoritarian state that evokes the Stalin-era Soviet Union helped Orwell join a small club of authors like Dickens and Kafka whose names have been adjectivized. The book’s everyman protagonist is Winston Smith, an employee at the Ministry of Truth, where his job is to rewrite history to match the state’s version. Orwell’s vision of an all-seeing Big Brother, a Thought Police fighting independent thinkers, and the manipulation of language to render it virtually meaningless — “War is peace. Freedom is slavery. Ignorance is strength” — is chilling. Because these elements mirror the real-world tactics of totalitarian regimes (Orwell was inspired by, among other things, the rise of Nazi Germany), some readers view 1984 as a cautionary tale.</p>\n            <h3><b><i>Emma</i></b> <b>by Jane Austen (1815)</b>﻿</h3>\n            <div>\n    <div>\n             <p><img src=\"https://cdn.aarp.net/etc/uxdia/images/uxdia-spinner.svg\" /></p><picture>\n                        <source media=\"(max-width: 375px)\" srcset=\"https://aarp.widen.net/content/lucmcseela/jpeg/9780593622476.jpg?anchor=3,0&amp;q=80&amp;color=ffffffff&amp;u=tltj5m&amp;w=375\"></source>\n                        <source media=\"\r\n(max-width: 425px)\" srcset=\"https://aarp.widen.net/content/lucmcseela/jpeg/9780593622476.jpg?anchor=3,0&amp;q=80&amp;color=ffffffff&amp;u=tltj5m&amp;w=425\"></source>\n                        <source media=\"\r\n(max-width: 768px)\" srcset=\"https://aarp.widen.net/content/lucmcseela/jpeg/9780593622476.jpg?anchor=3,0&amp;q=80&amp;color=ffffffff&amp;u=tltj5m&amp;w=688\"></source>\n                        <img src=\"https://aarp.widen.net/content/lucmcseela/jpeg/9780593622476.jpg?crop=true&amp;anchor=3,0&amp;q=80&amp;color=ffffffff&amp;u=tltj5m&amp;w=1434&amp;h=2048\" alt=\"the cover of emma by jane austen\" title=\"10 Must-Read Classic Novels\" />\n                </picture> \n    </div>\n            <div>\n    <p>\n        Penguin Random House\n    </p>\n                </div>\n    </div>\n            <p>Rich, beautiful, entitled, 20-year-old Emma Woodhouse — one of Austen’s most endearing, if frustratingly unself-aware, heroines — decides to play matchmaker for her less-affluent protégé, Harriet. Emma’s decidedly unhelpful efforts unleash a comedy of misdirected feelings, as she scuttles Harriet’s romance with the lovely farmer Robert Martin and encourages her relationship with the snobby clergyman Mr. Elton. Alas, Emma’s altruism stalls when Harriet develops feelings for the kind, aristocratic George Knightley, the brother of Emma’s brother-in-law, alerting Emma to his attractiveness, as well. For all her comic shortcomings, Emma remains eternally relatable — because truly, who among us is not an expert at fixing our supposed inferiors’ faults while remaining oblivious to our own?

Scout and Jem’s lawyer dad, Atticus, the moral hero of the book, agrees to defend a Black man unjustly accused of raping a young white woman, stirring up the racists in town. Boo gets drawn into the conflict when the woman’s father, who made up the accusation, tries to get revenge after Atticus interrogates him in court. An absorbing read, <i>Mockingbird</i> has sold over 40 million copies worldwide, won the Pulitzer in 1961 and was made into the award-winning 1962 movie with Gregory Peck. A controversial 2015 sequel, <i>Go Set a Watchman</i>, which some critics believe was released without the full consent of the author, portrays Scout grown up and Atticus as a segregationist. Expect more Lee-related headlines this October with the release of <i>The Land of Sweet Forever</i>, a compilation of previously published essays as well as unpublished short stories discovered after Lee’s 2016 death.</p>\n            <h3><b><i>Wuthering Heights</i></b> <b>by Emily Brontë (1847)</b></h3>\n            <div>\n    <div>\n             <p><img src=\"https://cdn.aarp.net/etc/uxdia/images/uxdia-spinner.svg\" /></p><picture>\n                        <source media=\"(max-width: 375px)\" srcset=\"https://aarp.widen.net/content/nvrmvkiihk/jpeg/9780141040356.jpg?anchor=21,0&amp;q=80&amp;color=ffffffff&amp;u=tltj5m&amp;w=375\"></source>\n                        <source media=\"\r\n(max-width: 425px)\" srcset=\"https://aarp.widen.net/content/nvrmvkiihk/jpeg/9780141040356.jpg?anchor=21,0&amp;q=80&amp;color=ffffffff&amp;u=tltj5m&amp;w=425\"></source>\n                        <source media=\"\r\n(max-width: 768px)\" srcset=\"https://aarp.widen.net/content/nvrmvkiihk/jpeg/9780141040356.jpg?anchor=21,0&amp;q=80&amp;color=ffffffff&amp;u=tltj5m&amp;w=688\"></source>\n                        <img src=\"https://aarp.widen.net/content/nvrmvkiihk/jpeg/9780141040356.jpg?crop=true&amp;anchor=21,0&amp;q=80&amp;color=ffffffff&amp;u=tltj5m&amp;w=1314&amp;h=2048\" alt=\"the cover of wuthering heights by emily bronte\" title=\"10 Must-Read Classic Novels\" />\n                </picture> \n    </div>\n            <div>\n    <p>\n        Penguin Random House\n    </p>\n                </div>\n    </div>\n            <p>Brontë’s only novel is perhaps <i>the</i> gothic masterpiece of English literature (although <i>Dracula</i>, above, is up there too). The brooding, dark tale features an abused hero, the orphaned Heathcliff; his sister through adoption, Catherine; obsessive love; unspoken feelings; and images of wind and snow lashing the English moors. The story begins with a stranger, Mr. Lockwood, a new tenant of Heathcliff’s, trapped in his spooky house by bad weather. He finds the name “Catherine” carved into his bedchamber’s windowsill and repeatedly inscribed on the pages of old books. (“The air swarmed with Catherines,” the frightened Lockwood notes.) He learns the troubling backstory from housekeeper Nelly Dean: Heathcliff and the mischievous Catherine grew up running wild on the moors as children and eventually fell in love. When Catherine is later drawn to a wealthier suitor, Heathcliff flees, then returns years later, rich and heartbroken: His beloved has married another, then dies soon after giving birth to a daughter, Cathy. The haunted Heathcliff exacts revenge on everyone he believes has wronged him (Catherine’s brother Hindley was particularly brutal to young Heathcliff). It’s a mesmerizing tale of love gone wrong, cruelty, and class and racial barriers in 19th-century England.</p>\n            <h3><b><i>The Catcher in the Rye</i></b> <b>by J.D.

After 16-year-old Holden Caulfield is expelled from his fourth prep school, he rambles disconsolately around his hometown, New York City, over a cold, cheerless December weekend. He’s avoiding his parents’ apartment and the reckoning — or, to use a Holdenism, the “hemorrhage” — that awaits him when they learn of his expulsion. Throughout Holden’s odyssey through mid-century New York, which includes a tourist’s checklist of classic spots (the Central Park Zoo, the Metropolitan Museum!), he bludgeons what he perceives as the phoniness of the adult world with the moral clarity of a seriously angsty teen. (A cynical Gen Xer before his time, Holden says things like, “Morons hate when you call them a moron.”) His voice lives on in every smart, wry young truth-sayer, whether they know it or not.</p>\n        </div>\n<article>\n    <div>\n    <p><i>Maria Speidel is a writer who lives in Los Angeles with a house full of books.<p>\nChristina Ianzito covers scams and fraud, and is the books editor for aarp.org and</p></i>AARP The Magazine<i>.

It's so important for us to be able to offer the world this beautiful moment in which the music that speaks directly to our heart is shared by all those that are able to come to the concerts,” says Măcelaru.</p>\n<h2>The man behind the music</h2>\n<p>George Enescu is widely considered to be the greatest Romanian musician of the 20th century. He was the author of the 'Romanian Rhapsodies', a composer, pianist, violinist, conductor and mentor to many greats like <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.euronews.com/culture/2012/05/03/roma-artists-changing-stereotypes\"><strong>Yehudi Menuhin</strong></a>. </p>\n<p>This year's theme, 'Celebrations', will be interpreted through 45 contemporary and repertory performances of Enescu's various works, including his monumental opera Oedip, staged by the Bucharest National Opera.</p>\n<p>Alongside opera and ballet, from Berlioz's 'Symphonie fantastique' to Igor Stravinsky's 'Firebird Suite' and Richard Strauss' 'Salomé' - the programme is as eclectic and exhilarating as the music itself.</p>\n<p>“With the help of local authorities and partners, we're holding concerts in more than 15 cities in Romania, including Timișoara, Cluj-Napoca, Sibiu, Constanța, and also in Brăila, Arad, Satu Mare\", says Cristina Uruc, organiser of the George Enescu International Festival and Competition. \"So all over Romania you will be able to witness and to listen to great music, to Enescu’s music.”</p>  \n<h2>Honouring musical masters</h2>\n<p>Beyond Enescu, the festival will also celebrate major milestones in the lives and works of legendary composers: Maurice Ravel (150 years since his birth), Gabriel Fauré (180 years since his birth), Pierre Boulez (100 years since his birth), Arvo Pärt (90 years since his birth), Johann Sebastian Bach (340 years since his birth), Dmitri Shostakovich (50 years since his passing).</p>\n<p>For those fortunate enough to be able to attend, there's also the added attraction of being able to enjoy some of Romania's finest settings and stages for music.</p>\n<p>A true jewel of neoclassical and eclectic architecture, the Romanian Athenaeum – home of the George Enescu Philharmonic – is one of the world's most beautiful concert halls, awarded the European Heritage Label, and a beloved symbol of the capital Bucharest.</p>\n<h2>Future focus</h2>\n<p>This year's edition will also promises bold reinterpretations of Enescu's music with pioneering concerts at Bucharest's Control Club, one of the city's trendiest venues.</p>\n<p>Famous for its live music scene and vibrant atmosphere, each Wednesday evening during the festival, the site will play host to artists seeking to reimagine and combine Enescu's classical mastery with contemporary sounds and modern genres. </p>\n<p>The aim of the project is to ensure Enescu's legacy lives on through new, younger audiences. </p>\n  </div>"

    "body": "<div><p>\n\tThe worsening humanitarian crisis in the Gaza Strip is set to take center stage at the upcoming 82nd edition of the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://deadline.com/tag/venice-film-festival/\">Venice Film Festival</a>.</p>\n<p>\n\tHundreds of local political and grassroot groups announced on Monday that they would be joining a march protesting <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://deadline.com/tag/israel/\">Israel</a>’s treatment of Palestinians in Gaza and the West Bank, on the main Santa Maria Elisabetta avenue on August 30.</p>\n<p>\n\t“At a time when the eyes of the world will be on Venice and the Film Festival, we have a duty to make the voices of all those who are outraged and rebelling heard: let us therefore turn the spotlight of the Festival on <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://deadline.com/tag/palestine/\">Palestine</a>,” the bodies said in a statement.\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\t“The genocide is there for all to see. The Israeli army in Gaza is massacring the Palestinian civilian population, targeting hospitals, refugee camps, food and water distribution points, schools, universities, churches and mosques,” it continued.\n</p>\n<p>\n\t“The denial of humanitarian aid, water and food is a strategy of genocide, carried out with the complicity of the U.S. and European governments, including the Italian one, which continues to support Israel economically, politically and diplomatically, continuing to supply weapons and maintaining trade agreements.”</p>\n<p>\n\tThe Venice Film Festival kicks off on August 27, six weeks shy of the second anniversary of the Hamas terror attacks on Southern Israel on October 7 2023, which killed 1,200 people and resulted in the taking of 251 hostages.</p>\n<p>\n\tAt least 61,000 people living in the Gaza Strip have died in Israel’s subsequent military campaign aimed at wiping out Hamas and recovering the hostages.</p>\n<p>\n\tUnited Nations-backed global hunger monitor, the Integrated Food Security Phase Classification (IPC), announced last week that 500,000 people in the Gaza Strip are officially facing “a man-made” famine, with at least 132,000 children under five-years-old expected to suffer from acute malnutrition.</p>\n<p>\n\tIsrael has said accusations of genocide are “baseless” because the country is not acting with “intent.” Leading Israel-based human rights groups B’Tselem and Physicians for Human Rights have countered this, saying last month that Israel was carrying out “a clear, intentional attack on civilians in order to destroy a group.”\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\tMonday’s announcement follows <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://deadline.com/2025/08/italian-film-industry-venice-open-letter-gaza-crisis-1236495982/\">an open letter over the weekend</a> signed by hundreds of Italian cinema professionals gathered under the banner of the Venice4Palestine (V4P).  </p>\n<p>\n\tThey called on the Venice Film Festival; its parent body, the Biennale, and the independent parallel sections of Giornate degli Autori (previously known as Venice Days) and the International Critics’ Week, “to be more courageous and clear in condemning the ongoing genocide in Gaza and the ethnic cleansing across Palestine carried out by the Israeli government and army.”</p>\n<p>\n\tThe statement also decried the deaths of close to 250 Palestinian media workers since the beginning of the Israeli military campaign as well as attacks on journalists in the West Bank. Monday statement by the Veneto grassroot bodies coincided with the killing of another<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://deadline.com/2025/08/palestinian-journalist-reuters-killed-israel-gaza-hospital-1236496581/\"> four journalists in Gaza </a>earlier in the day. </p>\n<p>\n\tThe Biennale and the Venice Film Festival responded to the letter in a written statement saying that throughout their histories they had always been “places of open discussion and sensitivity with regard to all the most pressing issues facing society and the world.”</p>\n<p>\n\tThe festival pointed to its selection for the main competition this year of Tunisian director Kaouther Ben Hania’s <em><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://deadline.com/tag/the-voice-of-hind-rajab/\">The Voice of Hind Rajab</a></em>, about the killing of a <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://deadline.com/2025/07/kaouther-ben-hania-on-venice-film-the-voice-of-hind-rajab-1236464721/\">six-year-old girl as her family fled Gaza City </a>in January, 2024, as well as <em><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://deadline.com/2024/09/of-dogs-and-men-director-dani-rosenberg-alexander-rodnaynsky-october-7-israel-venice-film-festival-1236075618/\">Of Dogs and Men</a></em> by Israeli director Dani Rosenberg, capturing the aftermath of October 7, 2023, for the Orizzonti sidebar in 2024.</p>\n<p>\n\tIn a follow-up statement, V4P said it “warmly welcomed” messages of solidarity from Giornate degli Autori and Critics’ Week, but was “disheartened by the response” from the Biennale and Venice Film Festival saying it failed to address the substance of their letter.</p>\n<p>\n\t“Signatures to our open letter have already surpassed 1,500 in just a few days: film clubs, festivals, professional associations, unions, cultural organizations, as well as directors, actors, screenwriters, and all the workers across the various sectors of cinema, art, culture, education, and information. A substantial and transversal part of our industry. If it took only a few hours to bring together so many, it means that Italian cinema has finally chosen to stand with the Palestinian people – attacked and massacred for decades – and no longer recognizes a place for half-words and false neutrality,” V4P said in its follow-up statement.</p>\n<p>\n\t“Yet the official communication from the Biennale still chooses not to mention Palestine and the ongoing genocide, nor the State of Israel that is perpetrating it. If the Biennale truly wishes to be a ‘place of open and sensitive dialogue, then that space must first and foremost be a space of truth.”</p>\n<p>\n\tThe group added it appreciated the selection of films such as <em>The Voice of Hind Rajab</em> for Competition but questioned the presence of stars <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://deadline.com/tag/gerard-butler/\">Gerard Butler</a> and <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://deadline.com/tag/gal-gadot/\">Gal Gadot</a>.</p>\n<p>\n\tThe actors are expected on the Lido this year for the world premiere of Julian Schnabel’s<em> In The Hand of Dante</em> in which they star alongside Oscar Isaac, Al Pacino, John Malkovich, Martin Scorsese,  Jason Momoa, Louis Cancelmi and Franco Nero.</p>\n<p>\n\tButler attended a gala for the Friends of the IDF Western Region Gala in Los Angeles in 2018 which raised $60 million for Israeli Army programs, but has not commented publicly on the events in Israel and Gaza in the wake of October 7.</p>\n<p>\n\tIsrael-born star Gadot has spoken out against Hamas and in support for the Israeli hostages but has also called for a diplomatic solution to the Gaza-Israel conflict and expressed an anti-war stance. \n\t</p>\n<p>\n\tLong criticized by pro-Palestinians, she was also attacked by Israeli rightwing media in July for her call for an end to the war in Gaza during an honorary award acceptance speech at the Jerusalem Film Festival. </p>\n<p>\n\t<em>In The Hand Of Dante</em>, a thriller revolving around the origins of a manuscript believed to be Dante’s <em>The Divine Comedy</em> written in the poet’s own hand,  world premieres in Venice on September 3, the same day as <em>The Voice of Hind Rajab.</em></p>\n</div>"
