Krah is now an MP in the German parliament.</p><p>The court in Dresden in eastern Germany had heard how Krah's former aide had gathered information and passed on confidential documents to Chinese authorities. </p><p>Jian Guo had maintained his innocence, insisting he had not worked for Chinese intelligence, and Krah told the court last month he had only learned about allegations against his ex-employee from the media.</p></div><div><p>The defendant, a German national, was accused by prosecutors of working for Chinese intelligence since 2002, in a case that fuelled concerns about China's spy activities in the European Union.</p><p>He had also been accused of spying on Chinese dissidents and opposition figures in Germany.</p><p>The court in Dresden said it was a particularly serious case, although in his final statement Jian Guo told the trial last week: \"I did not work for a Chinese intelligence agency and I am innocent.\"</p><p>Jian Guo was alleged to have acted as a handler for a Chinese national working for a logistics company at Leipzig airport who was given a suspended jail term. </p><p>The woman, identified a Yaqi X, was accused of providing data on cargo, flights and passengers. She had admitted passing on information but denied any knowledge of spying activities.</p><p>Reacting to his former aide's jail term, Krah told news agency DPA that \"immediately after the arrest I took the necessary action and significantly increased security in my office\".</p><p>The AfD politician resigned from his seat in the European Parliament earlier this year after he was elected to the Bundestag in February, when he ran for election in the eastern state of Saxony.</p><p>He is currently under investigation by the Dresden Public Prosecutor's Office. The investigation is reported to involve allegations of money laundering and corruption as an elected representative in the European Parliament.</p><p>Krah has called the accusations \"absurd and politically motivated\".</p></div>"

    "body": "<div><div><p>43 minutes ago</p></div><p><span><p><span>Lucy Williamson</span><span>Middle East Correspondent, Jerusalem</span></p></span></p></div><div><p>He promised total victory for Israel, but standing next to Donald Trump at the White House on Monday, it was Benjamin Netanyahu who looked defeated.</p><p>Israel's prime minister was saying all the right things about the peace deal he had just agreed to, but he seemed deflated, his voice hoarse and his energy dimmed, as he praised Trump as \"the greatest friend Israel has ever had in the White House\".</p><p>It is a friendship that could cost him his government.</p><p>Netanyahu's far-right allies have threatened to leave – and possibly collapse – his government if he makes too many concessions in ending the war. Coalition partners like Bezalel Smotrich and Itamar Ben-Gvir have made little secret of their desire to annex Gaza, drive out Palestinians and re-establish Jewish settlements there. </p><p>They – and Netanyahu – have been implacably opposed to any role for the Palestinian Authority in Gaza, and any pathway to a Palestinian State. The deal Netanyahu has now agreed to outlines both, though with heavy caveats.</p><p>Trump knows that by pushing the Israeli prime minister into this deal, he is asking him to risk his government. In return, he is dangling the prospect of a historic legacy – a new, more peaceful future for the region, and new ties between Israel and its Arab neighbours.</p></div><div><p>There were signs, even before Netanyahu left for Washington, that he knew this choice was coming.</p><p>Israel's president, Isaac Herzog, told an Israeli radio station that he was considering pardoning Netanyahu in the corruption cases he is currently facing in court. These trials are one reason, his critics allege, that he is reluctant to leave office and face the judges without the shield of his national duties, power and profile.</p><p>But the political exit being offered to him in this moment – a regional legacy in return for giving up his government, and possibly his political career – does not seem to have entirely won him over.</p><p>His first response to his countrymen today has been to publicly emphasise that he did not, in fact, agree to a Palestinian state.</p><p>\"Absolutely not. It's not even written in the agreement,\" he said in response to a question on camera. \"But we did say one thing – that we would forcibly resist a Palestinian state.\"</p><p>Reports in the Israeli media this morning also suggest that Israel's cabinet will not get to vote on the full terms of the deal – but only on the exchange of Israeli hostages for Palestinian prisoners.</p><p>The question is what these actions signify about his political calculation: whether Netanyahu is trying to hold his government together long enough to work his political magic on the polls, which currently predict he would lose an election, or whether he is banking on Hamas rejecting this deal – or being unable to control its commanders on the ground in Gaza – and that the war will not stop at all.</p><p>The potential continuation of the war was something he emphasised in that uncomfortable press conference in Washington, underlining – with Trump's backing – that Israel would have free reign to \"finish the job\" if Hamas failed to deliver on its side of the deal. Seen in that light, this uncomfortable moment could be the price of continuing American support for his war.</p><p>Netanyahu is known as a master of political manoeuvres, threading a path between political roadblocks to buy time. He has shifted position through previous rounds of negotiations, and has ridden through previous ceasefire deals, only to back out when a permanent end to the war is up for discussion.</p><p>Many believe he has never wanted to negotiate an end to this war, but to force Hamas into a surrender on Israel's terms. But it is hard to maintain that uncompromising image of \"total victory\" when you have publicly conceded to the very things you have spent a career preventing, and when you are waiting for your enemy's response.</p><p>For the first time since the war began, it seems that the consequences of avoiding this deal were worse than the consequences of agreeing to it. And if Trump really did force him to choose between his ally in Washington and his allies at home, why didn't Joe Biden do the same when a similar deal was on the table nine months ago – and some 30,000 more Gazans were still alive?</p></div>"

    "body": "<div><div><p>8 hours ago</p></div><p><span><p><span>Imran Qureshi</span><span>BBC News, Bengaluru</span></p></span></p></div><div><p>A Russian woman who made global headlines after being found living in a cave in India with her two young daughters has flown back to her country, an official told the BBC.</p><p>Nina Kutina, 40, and her daughters - aged six and five - <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c8d68848d34o\">were rescued on 9 July</a> by policemen on a routine patrol in a forest in the southern state of Karnataka.</p><p>The woman, who did not have valid documents to stay in India, had been sent to a foreigners' detention centre along with her daughters.</p><p>Last week, the Karnataka high court asked the federal government to issue documents to Ms Kutina and her daughters to return home.</p></div><div><p>They left for Russia on 28 September, an official at the Foreigners' Regional Registration Office (FRRO), who wanted to stay anonymous, told BBC Hindi. Ms Kutina's minor son from another relationship, who was later found living in Goa state, also went with them.</p><p>The high court had been hearing a petition filed by Dror Shlomo Goldstein, an Israeli businessman living in Goa, who said he was the father of the two minor girls. He had asked the court to stop the children from being sent back to Russia and appealed for their custody.</p><p>Mr Goldstein hasn't commented on the court order yet. He has the option to appeal against it, but it's not clear whether a judgment in his favour could compel the children to be sent back to India.</p><p>Mr Goldstein had earlier told a TV channel that Ms Kutina had left Goa without informing him and that he had filed a police complaint. He also said that he had been \"providing for their [the woman and the two minor girls] well-being for a long time\".</p><p>In the order, the court however said that despite Mr Goldstein's claims, the mum and the children had \"rather inexplicably\"  been \"found in an isolated cave\". </p><p>The court also said that Mr Goldstein could not explain why they had been living in the cave \"until they were found there and the authorities began [taking] action for their rehabilitation\". </p></div><div><p>The police team that found the three had earlier said they were on a routine patrol near Ramteertha hills in the Gokarna forest, which borders the tourist paradise of Goa, when they spotted brightly coloured clothes hung near a cave. </p><p>When they got closer - the entrance to the cave had been curtained off with brightly coloured saris - they saw a \"little blonde girl\" running out. When the shocked policemen followed her inside, they found Ms Kutina and the other child.</p><p>The three of them had meagre possessions - plastic mats, clothes, packets of instant noodles and some other grocery items - and the cave was leaking.</p><ul><li><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c8d68848d34o\">Mystery surrounds Russian mum and children found in Indian cave</a></li></ul><p>The police told the BBC in July that they had a tough time convincing the mother that it was dangerous to stay in the isolated location with snakes and wild animals in the forest. The police quoted her as saying: \"Animals and snakes are our friends. Humans are dangerous.\"</p><p>Police said she told them that they had been living in the cave for a week when they were found. She also told the police that she came to Karnataka from Goa where she also claimed to have lived in a cave. She said that her youngest daughter was born in a Goa cave.</p><p>Ms Kutina had defended her lifestyle in video interviews to Indian news agency ANI, saying she and her children were happy living like that and that \"nature gives good health\".</p><p>The police, however, said that they could not take any chances as the area was prone to landslides during the monsoon season.</p><p>Ms Kutina and her daughters were taken for a medical examination and then shifted to a detention centre.</p><p>Mr Goldstein's lawyer, Beena PK, argued in court that deportation would not be in the interests of the children, citing India being a signatory to the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child and provisions of the Goa Children Act, 2003.</p><p>But the lawyer for the federal government, Arvind Kamath, told the court that this case could not be described as deportation' because Ms Kutina herself had written to the Russian embassy expressing her wish to return to her home country.</p><p>Court documents show that the Russian embassy offered Ms Kutina and the children an emergency travel window between 26 September and 9 October.</p><p><i>Follow BBC News India on </i><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.instagram.com/bbcnewsindia/\"><i>Instagram</i></a><i>, </i><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.youtube.com/@bbcnewsindia/featured\"><i>YouTube,</i></a><i> </i><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://x.com/BBCIndia\"><i>Twitter</i></a><i> and </i><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.facebook.com/bbcindia/\"><i>Facebook</i></a><i>.</i></p></div>"

They also found the suspect's makeshift explosive devices, said James Deir, an agent of the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives.</p><p>Less than 10 minutes after the shooting, the gunman died in a shootout with police, officials said. </p><p>Investigators said on Monday that they had interviewed over 100 victims and witnesses as a part of the investigation and spent the whole night processing the scene of the crime. </p></div><p></p><h2>What do we know about the suspect? </h2><p></p><div><p>Though officials have not given a motive, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt told Fox News that Sanford was \"an individual who hated people of the Mormon faith\".</p><p>Officials have said the suspect was a former Marine who was once deployed to Iraq. </p><p>Sanford told local outlet Clarkston News that he was a sergeant in the Marines and was deployed to Fallujah in Iraq in 2007. </p><p>\"I'm excited to go,\" he told the newspaper. \"There are many changes we are making in the Middle East, we are making progress.\"</p><p>Sanford had previous arrests for a burglary and operating a vehicle while intoxicated, officials said on Monday. </p><p>Not much information is available about the suspect's political beliefs, but his Facebook profile features a photo of him in 2019 wearing what appears to be a shirt promoting the re-election of Donald Trump in 2020. </p><p>A Google Street View image of a property linked to Sanford also appears to show a pro-Trump sign outside of the house. </p><p>Sanford also appeared to be a father of a son who had serious health issues, according to posts from his family and a fundraising page. </p><p>Sanford is from a suburb of Flint of about 30,000 people, just a few miles away from Grand Blanc Township. </p></div></article>"

The \"Gen Z\" movement alleges, however, that paid goons had looted various buildings in order to undermine their cause.</p><p>Madagascar has been rocked by multiple uprisings since it gained independence in 1960, including mass protests in 2009 that forced former president Marc Ravalomanana to step down and saw Rajoelina come to power.</p><p>The protests mark the most significant challenge the president has faced since his third re-election in 2023.</p><p><i>Additional reporting by Danny Aeberhard</i></p></div>"

The UN said it risked inflicting significant harm.</p><p>Communication within Afghanistan, and out to the wider world, has been severely affected, as have essential services - including banking and payments - and access to online education, a lifeline for many women and girls.</p><p>Kabul airport, meanwhile, was \"nearly deserted\", according to one resident, with no evidence of planes arriving or leaving. </p></div><div><p>#Flight tracking service Flightradar24 showed that a handful of incoming and outgoing flights on Tuesday had been cancelled.

The deliveries are with mobiles. It's like a holiday, everyone is at home. The market is totally frozen.\"</p><p>Another Kabul local, who did not wish to be identified, said that banks across the capital were open, but that there were huge crowds wanting to withdraw money, but that only \"very little cash\" could be paid out. </p><p>However, a money changer in the country's southern Helmand province said all banks in his area were closed and that he was not able to process payments.</p><p>Diplomatic officials had earlier warned the BBC that the internet cuts could affect banking and e-commerce systems nationwide.</p><p>International news agencies also say they have lost contact with offices in the capital Kabul. Mobile internet and satellite TV has also been severely disrupted across the country. </p><p>Tolo News, a privately owned Afghan news channel, told people to follow its social media pages for updates as it expected disruptions to its television and radio networks.</p></div><figure><div><p><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20250919-090805-05e5ba0164-web-2.30.1-2/grey-placeholder.png\" /><img srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/0203/live/f08a4b00-9d68-11f0-a16f-ff7724a733bf.jpg.webp 240w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/0203/live/f08a4b00-9d68-11f0-a16f-ff7724a733bf.jpg.webp 320w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/0203/live/f08a4b00-9d68-11f0-a16f-ff7724a733bf.jpg.webp 480w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/0203/live/f08a4b00-9d68-11f0-a16f-ff7724a733bf.jpg.webp 640w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/0203/live/f08a4b00-9d68-11f0-a16f-ff7724a733bf.jpg.webp 800w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/0203/live/f08a4b00-9d68-11f0-a16f-ff7724a733bf.jpg.webp 1024w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/0203/live/f08a4b00-9d68-11f0-a16f-ff7724a733bf.jpg.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/0203/live/f08a4b00-9d68-11f0-a16f-ff7724a733bf.jpg.webp\" alt=\"WAKIL KOHSAR/AFP via Getty Images A man sitting at a money exchange stall playing on his phone.\" /><span>WAKIL KOHSAR/AFP via Getty Images</span></p></div><p></p><figcaption>Mobile internet and satellite TV have been severely disrupted across Afghanistan</figcaption><p></p></figure><div><p>One Kabul journalist told the BBC that they were unable to even call or contact guests for interviews, and needed to send camera crews directly to their interviewees' homes. </p><p>\"We have never experienced such [a] thing,\" he added. </p><p>Several residents, who requested anonymity, previously told the BBC that their businesses and lives had been seriously affected by the internet cuts.</p><p>A man who works as a money changer in Takhar province said that his daughters' online English classes were disrupted. \"Their last opportunity to study and stay engaged is now gone,\" he said.</p><p>Another woman previously told the BBC that she could not attend online classes since her home internet was cut off. \"I had hoped to finish my studies and find an online job, but that dream has also been destroyed,\" she said. \"Without internet access, I don't know what will happen next.\"</p></div><p></p><h2>A 'total internet blackout'</h2><p></p><div><p>In an earlier post on social network <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://mastodon.social/@netblocks/115287724541487948\">Mastodon.social</a>, Netblocks had said the country was \"in the midst of a total internet blackout as Taliban authorities move to implement morality measures, with multiple networks disconnected through the morning in a stepwise manner; telephone services are currently also impacted\".</p><p>A spokesperson for the Taliban governor in Balkh wrote on X earlier this month that the ban on fibre-optic internet was meant to curb \"evils\".

They banned girls over the age of 12 from getting an education, severely restricted job options for women and recently removed books written by women from universities.</p><p>For Fahima, the internet was her last lifeline to the outside world. </p><p>\"I recently enrolled in an online university [and] I had hoped to finish my studies and find an online job,\" she said. </p><p>On Tuesday, that lifeline was cut off when the Taliban imposed a nationwide internet shutdown that is set to last indefinitely. </p><p>\"Our last hope was online learning. Now [even] that dream has been destroyed,\" said Fahima.</p><p>Her real name has been changed to protect her identity, as have the names of all others interviewed for this article.</p></div><div><p>Over the past few weeks, the Taliban government began severing fibre-optic internet connections across several provinces, saying this was part of an effort to prevent immorality. </p><p>For many, they feared this might be the first step towards an entire internet shutdown.</p><p>And on Tuesday, their worst fears came true. The country is currently experiencing a \"total internet blackout\" according to internet watchdog Netblocks - a move that has paralysed the country's essential services. </p><p>International news agencies say they have lost contact with offices in the capital Kabul. Mobile internet and satellite TV has also been severely disrupted across Afghanistan. Flights from Kabul airport have also been disrupted, according to local media reports.</p><ul><li><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cdxqdy5nrlqo\">Flights in Afghanistan grounded after internet shutdown</a></li></ul><p>Ahead of the nationwide shutdown, the BBC spoke to some people in Afghanistan who detailed how the internet outages in their provinces had derailed their lives.</p><p>\"Before this, I studied midwifery, but unfortunately that programme was banned for women... the only hope left for us was the internet and online learning,\" said Shakiba, who lives in the northern province of Tahkar. </p><p>\"We want to study. We want to be educated. We want to be able to help people in our future. When I heard that the internet had been cut, the world felt dark to me.\"</p><p>It's a similar tale for Fahima, who says she now feels \"helpless\".</p><p>\"My two sisters [and I] were studying online. We used to stay updated on news and technology through the internet, but now we cannot keep up or learn new skills,\" said the student, who lives in an eastern province of Afghanistan. </p><p>\"We dreamed of finishing our education and helping our father financially, but now... we all sit at home doing nothing.\"</p><p>Since seizing power in 2021, the Taliban have imposed numerous restrictions in accordance with their interpretation of Islamic Sharia law.</p><p>Earlier this month they removed books written by women from the country's university teaching system as part of a new ban which has also outlawed the teaching of human rights and sexual harassment.</p><p>Around 140 books by women - including titles like \"Safety in the Chemical Laboratory\" - were found to be of \"concern\" due to \"anti-Sharia and Taliban policies\", said the Taliban. </p><p>The Taliban government has said it respects women's rights in accordance with their interpretation of Afghan culture and Islamic law.</p></div><div><p>But it's not just female students that have been affected - teachers like Zabi, who used to make a living through online teaching, have been similarly hit by the ban.</p><p>Zabi says he had previously worked as a journalist in Pakistan, but found no opportunities in the field when he returned to Afghanistan. He decided to open an English teaching centre - but was forced to take this online when authorities imposed restrictions on educational institutes, he says.</p><p>\"I had men and women in my classes - up to 70 or 80 students at a time. My students were happy and our lessons went smoothly,\" he said. \"They were all preparing for the IELTS [a standardised English test] and all their learning depended on the internet. The research, the practice tests, the official exams, everything.\"</p><p>Zabi, who also lives in the east of the country, adds that there is no IELTS centre in Afghanistan, so the only option for students is to take one online. </p><p>\"Two days ago, about 45 of my students were in the middle of an exam when the internet was cut off. They had been preparing for it for months, but they missed the opportunity. It was heartbreaking for them - and for me as their teacher.\"</p><p>He adds that he constantly gets calls from his students who don't know what to do. </p><p>\"They keep calling me asking 'Teacher, what should we do?' For the boys, there are still some English  centres open, but for my female students, this was their last chance. And now even that is gone.\"</p><p>Prior to Monday's shutdown, many of the interviewees say that there is still the option of being connected to mobile data - but that this is far too expensive for most, and that connectivity is patchy. A monthly plan with 100GB of data costs 3,500 Afghani, or around $50 (£37). In contrast, Wifi used to cost around 1,000 Afghani a month - which could be further split between a few students. </p><p>According to an earlier UNDP report, Afghanistan's per capita income stood at $306 in 2024. </p><p>Zabi says he will need to leave the country if the internet is not restored soon - saying he has no other way of earning a living. </p><p>The Taliban have yet to give an official reason for the shutdown. They had earlier said an alternative route for internet access would be created, but did not give any more details. </p><p>Anas, a money changer in Takhar province, says his business has faced \"enormous problems\" since the internet shutdown, saying that much of his work depends on the internet. </p><p>\"Our business has been affected by about 90%,\" he says. \"Yesterday, my brother who is also my business partner tried to send an email to a client. He couldn't get it through.\"</p><p>But his main concern are his three daughters - all of whom used to take online classes. </p><p>\"The night before, we heard the Taliban had cut internet access in Mazar, and my eldest daughter came to me with tears in her eyes and said she feared the same would happen here. </p><p>\"Their last opportunity to study is now gone. Seeing my children so helpless... [that was] the hardest for me. Only God knows what will happen to them and to me.\"</p></div>"

    "body": "<div><div><p>6 hours ago</p></div><p><span><p><span>Anthony Zurcher</span><span>North America correspondent</span></p></span></p></div><div><p>The US is hurtling towards a government shutdown on Tuesday night, and there appears to be little appetite on either side of the partisan divide to avoid it.</p><p>A last-ditch meeting between President Donald Trump and Democratic leaders in Congress made little progress. If anything, both sides have been digging deeper into their positions.</p><p>\"I think we're headed to a shutdown because the Democrats won't do the right thing,\" Vice President JD Vance told reporters after the meeting at the White House. \"You don't put a gun to the American people's head and say, 'Unless you do exactly what Senate and House Democrats want you to do, we're going to shut down your government'.\"</p><p>Democratic Senate leader Chuck Schumer said there were still \"very large differences\" between his party and the White House.</p><p>No one sounded optimistic.</p><p>These positions hardened further on Monday night after Trump posted an obscenity-laced, AI video mocking the Democratic leadership. </p><p>It depicted House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries dressed in a sombrero and a fake moustache, and Schumer saying in an artificial voice that undocumented migrants should get free healthcare. Both men responded angrily, with Jeffries calling it bigotry.</p><p>In terms of the substantive demands from each side, Republicans want a short-term extension of current spending levels – essentially kicking the legislative can a bit farther down the road. </p><p>They're happy with the way things are going, particularly since the Trump administration has been implementing spending cuts on its own, without the help of congressional budget-setters.</p><p>Democrats want that practice to end. </p><p>What's the point, they wonder, with negotiating spending-level agreements if Trump will just ignore them? </p><p>They also want a firm agreement to renew the government health-insurance subsidies for low-income individuals that expire at the end of the year – something Republicans have been reluctant to do so far.</p></div><div><ul><li><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/crrj1znp0pyo\">Why the US government might shut down and what to know</a></li></ul><p>Those are the negotiating positions of both sides, but government shutdown fights are about more than policy – they're about politics.</p><p>Republicans think they have the political high ground. </p><p>The party that makes demands in exchange for keeping the government open – in this case the Democrats – typically gets the lion's share of the blame when a shutdown happens.</p><p>Trump and Republican congressional leaders are already claiming that they are the reasonable ones. </p><p>They're the ones, they say, who simply want to buy more time to negotiate without the adverse consequences of a shutdown.</p><p>Of course, Democrats don't see it that way. </p><p>They believe healthcare is a winning issue for them, so they want the debate to be on whether millions of Americans will lose the ability to afford medical insurance. </p><p>Temporarily funding the government for seven weeks, in their view, just moves that subsidy deadline closer without any appreciable progress.</p><p>Complicating all this for Democrats is the reality that many Republicans seem at peace with an extended government closure.</p><p>White House budget chief Russ Vought recently circulated a memorandum explaining how the Trump administration would use a shutdown to make new, long-term reductions in federal spending and employment rolls.</p><p>Positions and government programmes deemed \"nonessential\" during the closure will be permanently shuttered – an expansion of the Department of Government Efficiency (Doge) cuts from earlier this year.</p><p>But Democratic leaders seem to believe the threats are a bluff or a negotiating tactic. </p><p>Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer called it \"an attempt at intimidation\".</p><p>\"Donald Trump has been firing federal workers since day one - not to govern, but to scare,\" Schumer said. \"This is nothing new and has nothing to do with funding the government.\"</p><p>Schumer and his fellow Democratic congressional leaders are also  under intense pressure from their political base to hold fast in the face of Republican attacks. </p><p>In March, Senate Democrats faced withering criticism from within their own party for reaching a six-month spending agreement with Republicans even as Trump was in the midst of his Doge budget-slashing campaign.</p><p>This time around, Democrats may feel compelled to trigger a shutdown to demonstrate their resolve.</p><p>In the end, however, a shutdown fight is a test of wills. It's a test of which side is best able to tolerate political pain.</p><p>Democrats may see a benefit to fighting Republicans, but will they be willing to stand aside as cherished federal programmes and government services – including those for low-income Americans – are shuttered?</p><p>Republicans may talk tough about slashing government, but as the incumbent party they could have the most to lose if the public mood dramatically sours.</p><p>The most recent government shutdown, during Trump's first term, lasted 35 days, setting a record as the longest in American history. </p><p>Although the fight was over spending on the president's proposed US-Mexico border wall, it ended because federal air traffic controllers – who were working without pay – began staying home, threatening massive disruption to US air travel.</p><p>Shutdowns can be unpredictable. And while both sides seem to be itching for a fight, there's no telling when, or how, this fight will end.</p></div>"
