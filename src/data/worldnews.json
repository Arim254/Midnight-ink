Thank you, Chunk, for being an inspiration,\" she said. </p><p>Chunk broke his jaw in June and observers suspect the injury was the result of a fight with another bear due to the timing of it - during mating season - and the nature of it, according to Chunk's profile on the Fat Bear Week website.</p><p>Adult male bears average up to 408kg in mid-summer and often pack on the equivalent of 25% of their bodyweight by autumn. The largest males often tip the scales at more than 540kg.</p><p>Chunk beat one of the biggest bears along the river, known as 856, by more than 30,000 votes. </p><p>Explore.org's Mike Fitz, a former ranger, said Chunk and 856 were \"real-life rivals on the river\". </p><p>The contest is Fitz's brainchild. What started as a one-day competition with about 1,700 votes in 2014 has since gone global, drawing in and educating fans across the world.</p></div>"

The sale of another 10 products have been paused, and two more are being reviewed. One product named by the TGA is made in Australia but is not sold in the country.</p><p>Australia has the highest rate of skin cancers in the world - it is estimated that two out of three Australians will have at least one cut out in their lifetime - and it has some of the strictest sunscreen regulations globally.</p><p><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c4gzl41rpdqo\">The scandal has caused a massive backlash from customers in the nation</a>, but experts have warned it may also have global implications. Problems have been identified with both the manufacture of some sunscreens and the integrity of lab testing relied upon to prove their SPF claims.</p><p>The manufacturer of the base formula in question, Wild Child Laboratories Pty Ltd, has stopped making it as a result, the TGA said.</p><p>In a statement, Wild Child Laboratories boss Tom Curnow said the TGA had found no manufacturing issues at its facility.</p><p>\"The discrepancies reported in recent testing are part of a broader, industry-wide issue,\" he said.</p><p>The TGA has previously said it is looking into \"reviewing existing SPF testing requirements\" which can be \"highly subjective\", but in the update on Tuesday said it had significant concerns about testing undertaken by Princeton Consumer Research Corp (PCR Corp), a US lab.</p><p>\"The TGA is aware that many companies responsible for sunscreens manufactured using this base formulation relied on testing by PCR Corp to support their SPF claims.\"</p><p>Mr Curnow said Wild Child had ceased working with PCR laboratories and had submitted its formulas for testing with other accredited, independent laboratories.</p><p>All companies using the problematic base formula and the PCR lab have also been contacted by the TGA, it said.</p><p>\"The TGA has also written to PCR Corp regarding its concerns and has not received a response.\"</p><p>In an emailed statement to the BBC, PCR Corp suggested that external factors could account for SPF rating discrepancies between their tests and those later conducted by others.</p><p>\"Sunscreen performance measured in a laboratory reflects the exact batch and condition of the sample submitted at that moment,\" the statement said. </p><p>\"Multiple factors outside the laboratory - such as manufacturing variability between batches, raw-material differences, packaging, storage conditions, product age, and in-market handling - can influence the SPF of products sold later.\"</p><p>The statement went on to explain that \"testing is therefore one part of a broader quality and regulatory process that includes manufacturing controls, stability programmes, and post-market surveillance by brands and regulators\".</p><p>\"We can only speak to the data we generated on the samples we tested; we cannot opine on any subsequently manufactured or sold product that we did not test.\"</p></div>"

Coalition partners like Bezalel Smotrich and Itamar Ben-Gvir have made little secret of their desire to annex Gaza, drive out Palestinians and re-establish Jewish settlements there. </p><p>They – and Netanyahu – have been implacably opposed to any role for the Palestinian Authority in Gaza, and any pathway to a Palestinian State. The deal Netanyahu has now agreed to outlines both, though with heavy caveats.</p><p>Trump knows that by pushing the Israeli prime minister into this deal, he is asking him to risk his government. In return, he is dangling the prospect of a historic legacy – a new, more peaceful future for the region, and new ties between Israel and its Arab neighbours.</p></div><div><p>There were signs, even before Netanyahu left for Washington, that he knew this choice was coming.</p><p>Israel's president, Isaac Herzog, told an Israeli radio station that he was considering pardoning Netanyahu in the corruption cases he is currently facing in court. These trials are one reason, his critics allege, that he is reluctant to leave office and face the judges without the shield of his national duties, power and profile.</p><p>But the political exit being offered to him in this moment – a regional legacy in return for giving up his government, and possibly his political career – does not seem to have entirely won him over.</p><p>His first response to his countrymen today has been to publicly emphasise that he did not, in fact, agree to a Palestinian state.</p><p>\"Absolutely not. It's not even written in the agreement,\" he said in response to a question on camera. \"But we did say one thing – that we would forcibly resist a Palestinian state.\"</p><p>Reports in the Israeli media this morning also suggest that Israel's cabinet will not get to vote on the full terms of the deal – but only on the exchange of Israeli hostages for Palestinian prisoners.</p><p>The question is what these actions signify about his political calculation: whether Netanyahu is trying to hold his government together long enough to work his political magic on the polls, which currently predict he would lose an election, or whether he is banking on Hamas rejecting this deal – or being unable to control its commanders on the ground in Gaza – and that the war will not stop at all.</p><p>The potential continuation of the war was something he emphasised in that uncomfortable press conference in Washington, underlining – with Trump's backing – that Israel would have free rein to \"finish the job\" if Hamas failed to deliver on its side of the deal. Seen in that light, this uncomfortable moment could be the price of continuing American support for his war.</p><p>Netanyahu is known as a master of political manoeuvres, threading a path between political roadblocks to buy time. He has shifted position through previous rounds of negotiations, and has ridden through previous ceasefire deals, only to back out when a permanent end to the war is up for discussion.</p><p>Many believe he has never wanted to negotiate an end to this war, but to force Hamas into a surrender on Israel's terms. But it is hard to maintain that uncompromising image of \"total victory\" when you have publicly conceded to the very things you have spent a career preventing, and when you are waiting for your enemy's response.</p><p>For the first time since the war began, it seems that the consequences of avoiding this deal were worse than the consequences of agreeing to it. And if Trump really did force him to choose between his ally in Washington and his allies at home, why didn't Joe Biden do the same when a similar deal was on the table nine months ago – and at least 20,000 more Gazans were still alive?</p></div>"

He says the voices of crying children could be heard around him, adding that they were \"traumatised\". </p><p>The earthquake comes barely more than a week after the country was hit by <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/2116506/opong-mirasol-nando-habagat-kill-26-ndrrmc\">back-to-back typhoons which killed more than 20 people</a>.</p></div><div><p>Most of the earthquake victims were from Bogo, a small town on one of the largest islands in the Visayas Islands, the Philippines' central region - and the place closest to the earthquake's epicentre.</p><p>Images coming out of Bogo show body bags lined on the street and hundreds of people being treated in tent hospitals. Officials have warned of \"a lot of damage\" caused by the earthquakes. </p><p>The local authorities have appealed for volunteers with medical experience to help deal with injuries. </p><p>Buckled and cracked roads, and fallen bridges are also making access difficult for emergency services. Power lines in many places are down, meaning that it's also been hard to speak to those affected. </p><p>Seven of those who died in Tuesday's earthquake in Bogo had lived in a village built to house victims of Typhoon Haiyan, which struck the central Philippines 12 years ago, killing more than 6,000 people.</p><p>In the municipality of San Remigio, a basketball game was being played when the earthquake struck, an emergency response official told the BBC. Almost 20 people at the game were sent to the hospital, and at least one person later died.</p><p>Officials from the national police and fire bureau say they are prioritising search and rescue operations, rushing to restore electricity and delivering relief supplies to those affected. </p><p>On Wednesday evening, Bogo was hit by yet another aftershock, this one at a magnitude of 4.7, with tremors felt in Cebu city and the neighbouring Leyte islands. There were no known casualties. </p><p>Cebu's archbishop has told devotees to stay away from churches, pending structural assessments. This call is significant as Cebu was one of the first Philippine islands to be colonised by Spain in the 1500s, and has many old churches.</p><p>Earlier footage showed the tower of an old Catholic church swaying and then partly collapsing in one locality.</p></div><div><p>The Philippines is composed of thousands of islands and the national disaster agency based in the capital Manila is tasked with releasing official casualty figures for typhoons and earthquakes. </p><p>However, the count is usually slow as the numbers are subject to rigorous checks - and so it is possible the death toll could jump. </p><p>The Philippines is very vulnerable to natural disasters. It is located on the geologically unstable \"Ring of Fire\" - so called because of the high number of earthquakes and volcanoes that occur here.</p><p>The upper layers of the Earth in the vast Pacific region are split into sections - tectonic plates - which are all moving relative to one another.</p><p>The Philippines sits on the edge of the Philippine Plate, which is pushing underneath the Eurasian Plate. The friction created by one plate pushing another down - known as subduction - can cause the plates to bend and then suddenly snap back, causing an earthquake. </p><p>The South East Asian island country also lies in the path of typhoons that sweep across the Pacific Ocean every year.</p><p>More than a dozen people were killed after tropical storm Bualoi and typhoon Ragasa hit the Philippines earlier last month. Hundreds of thousands of people were evacuated and a handful remain missing.</p></div>"

    "body": "<div><div><p>19 hours ago</p></div><p><span><p><span>Jeremy Bowen</span><span>International Editor</span></p></span></p></div><div><p>Donald Trump's framework agreement for ending the Gaza war and reconstructing the devastated territory has momentum behind it. </p><p>Much of it comes from the president himself. Momentum comes too from leading Arab and Islamic countries who have supported the plan, including Jordan, Egypt, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, the UAE, Pakistan, Indonesia and Turkey. And Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, standing next to Donald Trump, accepted it too, despite the fact it contains talk of a pathway to a Palestinian state that he has repeatedly denounced.</p><p>To keep the pace up, Trump says that Hamas has \"three to four days\" to decide whether to say yes or no.</p><p>If the answer is no, the war goes on.</p><p>The proposed deal looks a lot like a plan put forward by Joe Biden well over a year ago. Since then there has been massive killing of Palestinian civilians, more destruction in Gaza, and now a famine, while Israeli hostages in Gaza have had to endure months more of agony and captivity.</p><p>There were many reports in the Israeli media that the Biden initiative failed because Netanyahu moved the goalposts with a new set of demands - under pressure from the hard right in his cabinet.</p><p>Even so, the framework plan is a significant moment. For the first time, Donald Trump is putting pressure on Israel to end the war. Donald Trump has made himself into a leader to whom it is hard to say no. Nobody wants to end up getting the roasting Ukraine's president Volodymyr Zelensky received in the Oval Office back in February. But things can change when leaders leave the White House.</p><p>Before Benjamin Netanyahu left Washington DC to go back to Israel his staff filmed him putting over his version of events. One element was the idea of an independent Palestine next to Israel, the two-state solution which the UK and other Western countries have tried to revive by recognising Palestine.</p><p>The Trump document gives an indeterminate nod to the idea of Palestinian independence. It says that after the reform of the Palestinian Authority, which is based in Ramallah and led by President Mahmoud Abbas, conditions \"may finally be in place for a credible pathway to Palestinian self-determination and statehood, which we recognise as the aspiration of the Palestinian people.\"</p><p>Even the thought of a distant prospect of a Palestinian state was too much for Netanyahu, who had given whole-hearted support to Trump at the White House, telling him in English \"I support your plan to end the war in Gaza, which achieves our war aims.\"</p><p>On the video, getting his message out in Hebrew to the people back home before the long flight home, Netanyahu is asked if he agreed to a Palestinian state. He was emphatic.</p><p>\"No, absolutely not. It's not even written in the agreement. But we did say one thing. That we would forcibly resist a Palestinian state.\" Trump, he said, agreed.</p></div><div><p>Momentum is the plan's strength. Its weakness is the lack of detail, a characteristic of Trumpian diplomacy. The document that Trump and Netanyahu endorsed, which also has the support of the UK and other European countries, comes with a rough map of stages of an IDF pull-back, but none of the nuts and bolts that determine whether diplomatic agreements designed to end a war hold together or disintegrate.</p><p>If it is to work, hard negotiation will be necessary. In that process there will be many opportunities for it to break down.</p><p>Mainstream opposition parties in Israel have endorsed the plan. It has been condemned by the extremist ultra-nationalists in the Netanyahu coalition, who had loved the \"Trump Riviera\" plan mooted at the start of the year, launched with a bizarre video showing the leaders of Israel and the US in beach gear sipping cocktails to the backdrop of a new Gazan cityscape glittering glass towers. The Israeli hard right were delighted that the Riviera plan included the removal of all of Gaza's more than two million Palestinians. Jewish extremists want the land annexed and Palestinians replaced with Jewish settlers.</p><p>But the new plan says no Palestinian will be forced to leave. Benjamin Netanyahu's key far right ally, Itamar Ben Gvir, is said to have called the proposal \"dangerous\" and \"full of holes\".</p><p>If Hamas accepts the agreement, and if Benjamin Netanyahu wants to find ways to placate the extremists who keep his coalition in power, he will have plenty of chances to sabotage the negotiations in ways that put the blame on Hamas. The structure of the Trump framework agreement allows Israel a range of opportunities to veto moves it does not like.</p><p>It may not be possible to end a deep-seated conflict that has lasted more than a century. Longer term, the UK and many countries outside Israel and the US believe that any attempted solution that does not lead to Palestinian independence will not bring peace.</p><p>When the foreign ministers of the Arab and Islamic countries issued their statement of support, they said that they believed it would lead to a full Israeli withdrawal and rebuilding of Gaza, and \"a path for just peace on basis of two-state solution under which Gaza is fully integrated with the West Bank in Palestinian state in accordance with international law.\" That could be taken as a coded reference to the decision of the International Court of Justice that the occupation of Palestinian land by Israel is illegal.</p><p>Netanyahu believes the deal takes him closer to Israel's elusive victory over Hamas. He denies any Palestinian right to the land between the river Jordan and the sea.</p><p>One plan, two very different versions of what it means. The framework is ambiguous enough for both interpretations to be possible. That is not a promising start.</p></div><p><i>Correction 1 October: This article originally said that Israel's finance minister Bezalel Smotrich had compared the peace plan to the 1938 Munich agreement. In fact Smotrich had compared Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu's phone call to the Qatari Prime Minister, apologising for an Israeli missile strike on Doha, to the Munich agreement, and so we have removed this line from the story.</i></p>"

    "body": "<div><p>Women who served in the US military are pushing back against Defence Secretary Pete Hegseth's announcement that the requirements for combat roles will \"return to the highest male standard\", saying the standards have always been the same for men and women.</p><p>\"None of us have ever asked for special treatment,\" Elisa Cardnell, who served in the US Navy for eleven years, told the BBC.</p><p>Speaking to hundreds of generals on Tuesday, Hegseth reiterated his beliefs that the military had lowered standards to accommodate women and put service members at risk. His new directives would bring them back to a higher level, he said.</p><p>\"If it means no women qualify for combat jobs, then so be it,\" he said.</p></div><div><p>He maintained that women would not be excluded from the armed forces outright.</p><p>In January, the former Fox News commentator barely won approval in the Senate to head the Pentagon. Vice-President JD Vance had to break the tie vote, as many lawmakers struggled with his views about women in the military and about diversity.</p><p>On Tuesday he told the generals that he had emailed them 10 directives that included the \"male standard\".  </p><p>Some female veterans were outraged.</p><p>\"I am sick and tired of Pete Hegseth lying about women in the military and standards,\" former US Marine fighter pilot Amy McGarth said in a video on Instagram.</p><p>\"There has always been one standard for those jobs,\" she said. \"There was never a man's standard or a woman's standard for flying a jet.\"</p><ul><li><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cvgq044n72po\">US cities should be military training grounds, Trump tells generals</a></li></ul><p>Ms Cardnell, too, said gender and age were not part of assessments given for combat roles.</p><p>Combat standards are set differently depending on the unit a person is serving in, whether they are in special operations, infantry, armour or pararescue, she said. But all personnel in those roles have to pass the same test.</p><p>\"These standards have always been gender neutral, and they have always been set at a high standard,\" she said. \"Of course, not all women are going to make those, but not all men do either.\"</p><p>This is not the same for the annual physical tests given to all service members, which include routine exercises like push-ups. There, the standards and scores differ based on age and gender, and the tests vary by unit.</p><p>Ms Cardnell said it remains unclear if Hegseth will actually bring sweeping changes to how military personnel are assessed. The BBC asked the Pentagon for clarification on Hegseth's plans.</p></div><div><p>In his speech, Hegseth said:  \"Any place where tried-and-true physical standards were altered, especially since 2015, when combat arms standards were changed to ensure females could qualify, must be returned to their original standard.\"</p><p>He appeared to refer to a directive in 2015 by then-Defence Secretary Ash Carter that all military jobs be open to women and that any person, regardless of gender, who meets the standards should be able to serve. </p><p>\"When it comes to any job that requires physical power to perform in combat, those physical standards must be high and gender neutral,\" Hegseth said. \"If women can make it, excellent. If not, it is what it is.\"</p><p>Broadly, Hegseth said he was changing requirements throughout the military to \"fix decades of decay\" and that the armed forces have \"promoted too many uniformed leaders for the wrong reasons,\" like race, gender and \"historic so-called firsts\".</p><p>Senator Tammy Duckworth, an Army veteran who was severely injured while serving as a combat pilot in Iraq, told the BBC after the speech: \"For a guy who's not qualified for his own job, it's pretty discriminatory to talk about women who are qualified to do their jobs.\"</p><p>She added that his remarks could hurt recruitment.</p><p>Women in the US military were first allowed to fly combat aircraft in the Navy and Air Force in 1993, although they were excluded from ground combat. That changed in 2013 when the Combat Exclusion Policy was lifted and by 2016 combat roles were open to all.</p><p>Because of how recently women were included in all ranks, many are now still in the middle of their careers, Ms Cardnell said.</p><p>\"It takes time to see those women break that brass ceiling, and we haven't had a chance to see that,\" she said.</p><p>Now active and veteran female soldiers are concerned that Hegseth is building a military culture where women will be undermined and unable to advance, she said.</p><p>\"Leadership sets the tone,\" she said. </p><p>Not all female soldiers opposed Hegseth's comments.</p><p>Republican House Representative Sheri Biggs, who served as a lieutenant colonel in the Air National Guard, said that she supported the defence secretary's efforts to end \"woke\" policies from the military.</p><p>\"Returning to standards that prioritise excellence and accountability puts America's security and our servicemembers where they belong -  first,\" Biggs said in a statement on Tuesday to the Associated Press.</p><p>Another South Carolina Republican, Representative Nancy Mace, who graduated from The Citadel military college, posted on X in support of Hegseth. </p><p>\"Our enemies don't fear diversity quotas.
