    "body": "<div><p>A French murder trial that opened Monday has transfixed the public because of the mystery at its core: where is the victim's body?</p><p>Cédric Jubillar, a 38 year-old painter-decorator, is accused of killing his wife Delphine nearly five years ago in a fit of jealous rage. </p><p>He has always denied the charges and, other than circumstantial evidence, investigators have struggled to build a case. There is no body, no blood, no confession, and no witness.</p><p>With its unexplained central fact and its cast of characters from small-town southern France, the affair has become a social media sensation.</p></div><div><p>Self-declared investigators have set up countless chat groups where they swap theories and share testimony – much to the irritation of police and families.</p><p>\"These groups are the equivalent of the bistro counter – but with more people,\" said psychoanalyst Patrick Avrane, author of a book on attitudes to crime.</p><p>\"Everyone constructs the theory that suits him or her the best.\"</p><p>The Jubillar mystery began at the height of Covid lockdown when – in the early hours on 16 December 2020 – Cédric Jubillar contacted the gendarmes to report that his wife had gone missing.</p><p>Delphine, who was 33 at the time, was a night nurse in a clinic not far from their home in Cagnac-les-Mines in the south-western Occitania region. The couple had two children, aged six and 18 months.</p><p>Police came to understand that the Jubillars did not have a happy relationship. </p><p>Cédric Jubillar was a habitual cannabis user and barely held down a job. Delphine was in a relationship with a man she had met over the Internet. She and Cédric were talking about divorce.</p><p>Police and locals conducted extensive searches in the surrounding countryside – with potholers descending into some of the disused mineshafts with which the area is dotted.</p><p>Delphine's body was never found, but a case was gradually built against her husband and in mid-2021 he was placed under investigation and detained.</p><p>The prosecution at the trial in the town of Albi will tell the court that Cédric Jubillar had a clear motivation to kill his wife, because of their impending split.</p><p>Lawyers will raise other points: certain odd actions by Cédric on the night of the disappearance; signs of a fight, including a pair of broken glasses; a neighbour who heard a woman screaming.</p><p>Cédric Jubillar's own character will be brought under the spotlight, with witnesses expected who will speak of his threatening language to Delphine before she disappeared, and his apparent lack of concern after.</p><p>Two of his acquaintances – a former cellmate and a former girlfriend – will also repeat what they told police: that Cédric confessed to the murder and told them where her body was.</p><p>But after more digging no body has been found, and the defence is expected to raise doubts about the veracity of the pair's accounts.</p><p>Indeed the heart of Cédric Jubillar's case is that there is nothing – beyond the popular view that he is the ideal culprit – to prove that he did away with his wife. He himself has always protested his innocence.</p><p>The trial is expected to last four weeks, with 65 witnesses called and 11 experts. More than 16,000 pages of evidence have been compiled.</p><p>Explaining the case's grip on the public mind, writer Thibault de Montaigu said in Le Figaro newspaper it was like \"a novel by Georges Simenon\" – creator of the fictional detective Inspector Maigret.</p><p>In a long analysis of the case, he said that for all the circumstantial evidence against Cédric Jubillar, the central question was this: how a \"red-eyed, fuzzy-brained guy who smoked ten joints a day could have carried out the perfect crime?</p><p>\"Killing his wife without leaving the slightest trace; secretly transporting her body, burying her in an unfindable location, then coming back to tell the police – all while his two children slept quietly in their bedrooms.</p><p>\"And this was a guy who greeted the cops in panda pyjamas and then played Game of Thrones on his phone the very morning of the disappearance.</p><p>\"So: genius bluffer; lucky fool; or poor innocent?\"</p><p>The court will decide.</p></div>"

    "body": "<div><p>Australian officials have promised telecommunications giant Optus will face \"significant consequences\" over a systems outage linked to multiple deaths.</p><p>The incident last week left hundreds of people across more than half of the country unable to call emergency services for 13 hours.</p><p>Optus - one of the country's two major providers - says at least three people died as a result, and its chief executive has apologised to their families and the public for the \"completely unacceptable\" failure.</p><p>The company is under fire for its delayed handling of the incident - the second such outage for the firm in two years - and the nation's communications regulator is investigating.</p></div><div><p>More than 600 calls to emergency services failed last Thursday, primarily coming from South Australia, Western Australia and the Northern Territory. At least two calls to triple-0 made from south-western New South Wales also did not connect.</p><p>However Optus waited 40 hours to inform the public about the incident, and also did not tell regulators until the issue was resolved - counter to standard practice, the Australian Communications and Media Authority (Acma) says.</p><p>In a press conference on Friday afternoon, Optus boss Stephen Rue blamed the outage on a technical fault identified during a network upgrade.</p><p>He said welfare checks conducted after services were restored confirmed three people had died, including a baby boy, though police have since said the network failure was \"unlikely\" to be a cause in that case. Authorities in WA also say they believe a fourth person died after their call to triple-0 failed.</p><p>In a series of updates over the weekend, Mr Rue said the company was unaware of the incident for 13 hours. Multiple customers had tried to advise the company its network wasn't working, but the complaints weren't escalated or handled \"as would be expected\", he said.</p><p>\"I would like to reiterate how sorry I am about the very sad loss of the lives of four people who could not reach emergency services in their time of need,\" Mr Rue said on Sunday.</p><p>\"What I can assure you is that actions are and will be taken to ensure this does not happen in future.\"</p><p>In a statement, an Acma spokesperson said the regulator was \"deeply concerned\" by the situation and its handling.</p><p>\"Australians must be able to contact emergency services whenever they need help. This is the most fundamental responsibility every telco provider has to the public.\"</p><p>The regulator has previously found Optus failed to provide access to emergency call services for 2,145 people <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/world-australia-67340901\">during an outage in 2023</a>, and then failed to check on 369 people affected afterwards. It was hit with more than A$12m ($8m; £6m) in penalties.</p><p>Communications Minister Anika Wells on Monday said telecommunications providers had \"no excuse\" for triple-0 call failures and that she had spoken to Mr Rue - who the prime minister says should considering resigning.</p><p>\"You would be unsurprised to hear that I expressed my unbelievable disappointment that we were here again so quickly. Or here again at all.\"</p><p>The company had \"perpetuated an enormous failure on the Australian people\" and would face \"significant consequences\", she said.</p><p>Investigations are still underway, but Mr Rue has said he intends to give public updates daily \"as more information becomes known\".</p></div>"

His sister Mona Seif wrote on X: \"My heart will explode.\"</p><p>The 43-year-old blogger and pro-democracy activist is one of Egypt's best known political prisoners.</p><p>He was arrested in 2019, months after finishing a previous five-year sentence, and convicted two years later of \"spreading false news\" for sharing a Facebook post about a prisoner dying after torture.</p></div><div><p>His family said he should have been released in September 2024. However, Egyptian authorities refused to count the two years he spent in pre-trial detention as time served.</p><p>Although he acquired British citizenship in 2021, Egypt has never allowed him a consular visit by British diplomats.</p></div><div><p>Abdel Fattah's lawyer, Khaled Ali, confirmed in a Facebook post on Monday afternoon that he had been pardoned.</p><p>He would be released from Wadi al-Natrun prison, north-west of Cairo, once the pardon was published in the official gazette, he added.</p><p>Abdel Fattah's other sister Sanaa Seif also wrote on X: \"President Sisi has pardoned my brother!\"</p><p>\"Mum & I are heading to the prison now to inquire from where Alaa will be released and when... OMG I can't believe we get our lives back!\"</p><p>The National Council for Human Rights welcomed the pardons, saying the decision was \"a step that underscores a growing commitment to reinforcing the principles of swift justice and upholding fundamental rights and freedoms\".</p><p>Two weeks ago, Sisi had ordered authorities to study the NCHR's petitions for the release of Abdel Fattah and six others, which the institution said it had submitted \"in light of the humanitarian and health conditions experienced by [their] families\".</p><p>In July, Abdel Fattah's 68-year-old mother, Leila Soueif, who is also a British citizen, ended a nine-month-long hunger strike after receiving assurances from the UK government that it was doing everything it could to secure his release.</p><p>She lost more than 40% of her original body weight and was twice admitted to hospital in London during the strike, which saw her consume only tea, coffee and rehydration salts.</p><p>Abdel Fattah has also staged a number of hunger strikes himself. One in 2022, as Egypt hosted the UN climate conference, led to international pressure for his release and an improvement in his conditions in jail.</p><p>He first rose to prominence during the 2011 uprising in Egypt that forced long-time President Hosni Mubarak to resign.</p><p>Since Sisi came to power in 2014 after leading the military's overthrow of Mubarak's democratically elected successor, he has spent most of the time in prison or police detention.</p><p>In May, UN Working Group on Arbitrary Detention - a panel of independent human rights experts – found that Abdel Fattah was arbitrarily arrested for exercising his right to freedom of expression, was not given a fair trial, and continued to be detained for his political opinions.</p><p>According to the panel, the Egyptian government said he was afforded \"all fair trial rights\" and that his sentence would be completed in January 2027.</p></div>"
