    "body": "<div><p>Greta Thunberg has pushed back on criticism that a Gaza-bound flotilla she is a part of is a publicity stunt, saying no one would imperil themselves purely for attention.</p><p>The Swedish activist is aboard one of 52 boats that form the Global Sumud Flotilla (GSF), which is travelling toward Gaza with the aim of delivering humanitarian aid to Palestinians there.</p><p>Israeli authorities have ridiculed the GSF flotilla and similar seaborne attempts to reach the territory, calling the boat Thunberg travelled on in June a \"selfie yacht\".</p><p>Asked about these criticisms of the flotilla by the BBC's Laura Kuenssberg, the activist said: \"I don't think anyone would risk their life for a publicity stunt.\"</p></div><div><p>Speaking while sailing off the Greek coast, she said the flotilla was not just a humanitarian mission but was also sending a message to people in Gaza that \"when our governments fail to step up, the people will step up\".</p><p>International aid agencies have been attempting to get food and medicine into the Palestinian territory - but note Israel is restricting the flow of supplies. Israel claims it is attempting to stop those supplies falling into the hands of Hamas, and has approved a US-backed aid agency.</p><p>Last month, a UN-backed body confirmed that there was famine in Gaza and the UN's humanitarian chief said it was the direct result of Israel's \"systematic obstruction\" of aid entering the territory. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has called this an \"outright lie\".</p><p>Thunberg said the purpose of the flotilla was to \"break Israel's illegal and inhumane siege on Gaza by sea\". The Israeli military has long controlled the waters that border Gaza.</p><p>Earlier this month, the flotilla came under attack by drones which dropped unidentified objects onto boats outside the Tunisian port of Sidi Bou Said.</p><p>Another suspected drone attack on Wednesday, off the coast of Crete, led Spain and Italy to <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/ce3yz939qnpo\">deploy naval ships to assist the flotilla</a>.</p><p>Addressing the incidents, Thunberg accused Israeli officials of making \"baseless threats\" that violate international law, and asked: \"Why would they attack a peaceful humanitarian mission aiming to bring humanitarian aid to a starving population?\"</p><p>Israel has not commented on the drone attack, but has previously said it would not let the flotilla reach its destination.</p><p>Thunberg and 11 other activists were detained by Israeli authorities in June after they intercepted another boat heading for Gaza with a token amount of aid in the Mediterranean.</p><p>She was held in Tel Aviv for a day before being deported to France. </p><p>Thunberg accused Israel of illegally kidnapping her and the other activists while they were in international waters. Israel said it had prevented a breach of the maritime blockade around Gaza.</p></div>"

But hundreds of thousands more remain there in dire humanitarian conditions, with health and other essential services collapsing.</p><p>\"They tell us go there, then come back here...

the band's youngest member.</p><p>The stand-out is a track called Bleep, a defiant riposte to their detractors - with a hook that employs the Korean slang term for a censor's \"beep\"  (삐처리) </p><p>\"<i>Fail, 삐처리 / Frail, 삐처리 / Lazy, 삐처리 / Hazy, 삐처리 / Yada, yada, noise cancellation.</i>\"</p><p>\"That's my favourite,\" says Hyunjin. </p><p>\"The lyrics feel bold and refreshing, and there's something very satisfying about the message it holds.\"</p><p>The song carries extra resonance when you learn that Felix - the band's thunderous-voiced baritone - has won permission from a US court to unmask an anonymous social media user in connection with a defamation lawsuit.</p><p>According to legal papers filed in California, multiple posts accused the Australian-born musician of treating staff \"like servants\" and acting \"as though he is a prince\". </p><p>Felix, who is suing the user in Seoul, said the accusations caused him \"severe mental distress, physical distress and humiliation\". </p></div><figure><div><p><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20250919-090805-05e5ba0164-web-2.30.1-2/grey-placeholder.png\" /><img srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/7b19/live/b49f87c0-99f0-11f0-928c-71dbb8619e94.jpg.webp 240w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/7b19/live/b49f87c0-99f0-11f0-928c-71dbb8619e94.jpg.webp 320w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/7b19/live/b49f87c0-99f0-11f0-928c-71dbb8619e94.jpg.webp 480w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/7b19/live/b49f87c0-99f0-11f0-928c-71dbb8619e94.jpg.webp 640w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/7b19/live/b49f87c0-99f0-11f0-928c-71dbb8619e94.jpg.webp 800w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/7b19/live/b49f87c0-99f0-11f0-928c-71dbb8619e94.jpg.webp 1024w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/7b19/live/b49f87c0-99f0-11f0-928c-71dbb8619e94.jpg.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/7b19/live/b49f87c0-99f0-11f0-928c-71dbb8619e94.jpg.webp\" alt=\"JYP Entertainment Promotional photo for Stray Kids, showing all members standing together against a white backdrop\" /><span>JYP Entertainment</span></p></div><p></p><figcaption>The band are (L-R): Hyunjin, Lee Know, Seungmin, I.N, Changbin, Han, Felix, Bang Chan</figcaption><p></p></figure><div><p>In the tribal world of K-Pop, such cases are surprisingly common, as overzealous fans go too far in trashing their rivals.</p><p>But, for the most part, Stray Kids prefer not to focus on negativity. </p><p>Their new album is titled Karma to reflect the \"good energy and connection\" they've built with fans over the last seven years, says Lee Know. </p><p>\"We felt this was the right time to tell that story, because we can really feel all the positive karma that's come from our hard work,\" adds Changbin.</p><p>Anyone who's watched their YouTube series will know they're more interested in fun than friction -

known as STAY - with late-night live streams and Q&A sessions conducted from their hotel rooms. </p><p>It lends a particular intimacy to their celebrity, a quality that extends to their live shows. </p><p>In London this summer, I was struck by the way Stray Kids collapsed the distance between the stage and the audience. </p><p>Amid the precision choreography and pyrotechnics, they held dance challenges and karaoke sessions; and ran fans' names across the screens during the Coldplay-esque ballad Cinema.</p><p>Between the songs, Changbin said he was honoured to play in Tottenham stadium because of his love of English football; and his bandmates started chanting spells in British accents, as if they were auditioning for the Harry Potter reboot.</p><p>For the encore, they cleared the perimeter of the stadium floor and drove around on giant, telescoping platforms, trailed by inflatable characters, like they were in a Macy's Day parade. As a result, even the fans in the cheap seats got time up close with their idols.</p><p>\"It was such an incredibly happy time for us,\" recalls I.N of the tour. </p><p>\"I feel like we'll be looking forward to moments like that every day, and the tour really reminded us just how precious STAY is to us.\"</p><p>\"During the tour, I realised just how many STAY are out there supporting us, everywhere we go,\" adds Han. \"That really left a strong impression on me.\"</p></div><figure><div><p><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20250919-090805-05e5ba0164-web-2.30.1-2/grey-placeholder.png\" /><img srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/f2d7/live/60d2a130-99f1-11f0-928c-71dbb8619e94.jpg.webp 240w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/f2d7/live/60d2a130-99f1-11f0-928c-71dbb8619e94.jpg.webp 320w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/f2d7/live/60d2a130-99f1-11f0-928c-71dbb8619e94.jpg.webp 480w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/f2d7/live/60d2a130-99f1-11f0-928c-71dbb8619e94.jpg.webp 640w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/f2d7/live/60d2a130-99f1-11f0-928c-71dbb8619e94.jpg.webp 800w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/f2d7/live/60d2a130-99f1-11f0-928c-71dbb8619e94.jpg.webp 1024w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/f2d7/live/60d2a130-99f1-11f0-928c-71dbb8619e94.jpg.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/f2d7/live/60d2a130-99f1-11f0-928c-71dbb8619e94.jpg.webp\" alt=\"Stray Kids perform on moving platforms during their DominATE world tour\" /></p></div><p></p><figcaption>The band found innovative ways to get closer to fans during their world tour</figcaption><p></p></figure><div><p>In America and Europe, Stray Kids' DominATE tour set <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.billboard.com/pro/stray-kids-dominate-world-tour-k-pop-boxscore-records/\">box office and attendance records</a> for a K-pop band, with 1.2m tickets sold and receipts of $182m (£135m).</p><p>As a sort of victory lap, Karma went straight to the top of the US charts - making them the first band in history to debut at number one with each of their first seven albums.</p><p>But when you ask them about all that success, the octet are suddenly bashful.</p><p>\"Successful is a really strong word and I honestly do not have the confidence to judge if we are indeed successful or not,\" says Bang Chan, the group's designated leader. </p><p>\"What I can say is that Stray Kids, including myself, have reached very far but we're still very hungry to achieve more milestones.\"</p><p>Conquering the UK is definitely on the bucket list.

She clearly thrives in the limelight and embraces the glamour that comes with being her country's most celebrated foody.</p><p>But there are really two Hilda Bacis. She admits that there is Hilda Baci the person, which is what her family and partner sees, and then there is Hilda Baci the brand, whose image is carefully curated.</p><p>\"I'm a businesswoman first, which means that whatever I'm doing, it is important that my business come first,\" she says.</p><p>Under the My Food by Hilda name, which has more than a million followers on Instagram - along with the 3.2 million on her personal account - she runs a well-known restaurant in Lagos, as well as offering cookery classes and a private chef service.</p><p>\"It feels good to be an inspiration,\" she says, \"but it comes with a little bit of pressure because a lot of people now look to me for guidance and answers... I don't allow that to overwhelm me and lose focus on what I'm trying to achieve.\"</p><p>The cooking influencer, who was born in Calabar in the south but at five moved to the capital, Abuja, with her mother, older brother and younger sister, got a taste of standing out at an early age.</p><p>Baci's mother ran an eatery opposite the ministry of defence in Abuja and she remembers that after a day at primary school she would go there to help out.</p><p>\"I always got so many tips because I used to memorise the whole menu and I was very sharp mouthed.

    "body": "<div><div><p>2 hours ago</p></div><p><span><p><span>Imogen Foulkes</span><span>Geneva correspondent</span></p></span></p></div><div><p>A referendum in Switzerland to decide whether to introduce electronic identity cards is taking place, with initial projections suggesting voters are evenly split.</p><p>It is the second nationwide ballot on the issue, after the idea was rejected in 2021 over data protection concerns and unease over the proposed system being largely run by private firms.</p><p>Under the revised proposal, the new system would remain entirely optional and in public hands, with data stored on users' smartphones rather than centrally.</p><p>It comes as the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cn832y43ql5o\">UK government this week announced plans to introduce its own digital ID</a> as part of efforts to curb the number of illegal migrants living and working in the country.</p></div><div><p>The proposed <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/clyl3lzzed2o\">British digital ID would have fewer intended uses</a>, but has still raised concerns about privacy and data security.</p><p>Switzerland's plan has already been approved by both its houses of parliament, and the Swiss government recommends a \"Yes\" vote.</p><p>Citizens can still choose to rely on a physical national identity card, which has been standard in Switzerland for decades.</p><p>To ease privacy concerns, a particular authority seeking information on a person – such as proof of age or nationality, for example – will only be able to check for those specific details.</p><p>Supporters say the system will make life much easier for everyone, allowing a range of bureaucratic procedures - from getting a telephone contract to proving you're old enough to buy a bottle of wine - to happen quickly online.</p><p>But Switzerland has a long tradition of protecting its citizens' privacy. The banking secrecy laws, now much diluted, were designed to shield an individual's personal finances from the prying eyes of the state.</p><p>For years, Google Street View was controversial in Switzerland - and even today, following a ruling by the Swiss Federal Court, images taken close to schools, women's refuges, hospitals or prisons must be automatically blurred before going online. </p><p>There are also far fewer CCTV cameras in Switzerland than in many of its European neighbours.</p><p>Opponents of digital ID cards, who gathered enough signatures to force another referendum on the issue, argue that this measure could still undermine individual privacy.</p><p>They also fear that, despite the new restrictions on how data is collected and stored, it could still be used to track people and for marketing purposes.</p><p>An early projection while voting continues suggests a 50-50 split over the issue, making the final result - expected late on Sunday - too close to call.</p><p>Opinion polls heading into the referendum suggested voters may be ready to give electronic IDs a chance.</p><p>They have already had experience of the government's Covid ID, which was used during the pandemic to show vaccination status and was mandatory to enter restaurants and bars.</p><p>And as for the concerns about marketing of personal data, most Swiss have smartphones and are keen users of social media. </p><p>Tech giants are already harvesting their likes and dislikes, so many voters believe that allowing the Swiss authorities to check on a few details from time to time will not make a big difference.</p></div>"
