The indictment was later dismissed at the direction of the Trump administration. </p></div><div><p>\"I cannot continue my re-election campaign,\" Adams said in a video posted on social media on Sunday. </p><p>\"The constant media speculation about my future and the campaign finance board's decision to withhold millions of dollars have undermined my ability to raise the funds needed for a serious campaign.\" </p><p>Adams has not endorsed any of his rivals in the race. But he did make comments in his withdrawal statement that appeared to be directed at Zohran Mamdani, the Democratic nominee and front-runner in the race.</p><p>\"Major change is welcome and necessary, but beware of those who claim the answer to destroy the very system we built together over generations,\" he said without naming Mamdani, a self-described socialist. \"That is not change, that is chaos.\"</p><p>Adams warned that \"insidious forces\" were pushing \"divisive agendas\" in city politics. </p><p>Mamdani himself spoke to MSNBC later on Sunday, saying the city's inhabitants were \"tired\" by Adams' brand of politics, and standing by his \"vision for a city that New Yorkers can actually afford\".</p><p>A former police officer who was once seen as a rising star in New York politics, Adams's popularity waned due to corruption allegations, tensions with Democrats over immigration, and frustration with the city's rising cost of living.</p><p>In an indictment last September, Adams was alleged to have accepted gifts totalling more than $100,000 (£75,000) from Turkish citizens in exchange for favours. He denied any wrongdoing and pleaded not guilty. </p><p>In April, the justice department ordered federal prosecutors in New York to drop the charges. But the controversy continued to haunt Adams as he trailed in the re-election race.</p><p>His relationship with the Democrats deteriorated during the Biden administration as he criticised its immigration strategy. </p><p>Earlier this year, he said he would run as an independent - a move that spared him from the competitive Democratic primary, which was won by Mamdani.</p><p>Adams will serve out the remainder of his term, which ends on 1 January. His name will remain on the ballot because the deadline to change it has passed.</p></div>"

The most notorious was a compound known as Crouching Tiger Villa, where workers were routinely beaten and tortured. </p><p>Then, two years ago, an alliance of insurgent groups launched an offensive which drove the Myanmar military out of large areas of Shan State, and took control of Laukkai. China, which holds significant influence over these groups, was assumed to have given the offensive a green light. </p><p>Ming Xuechang, the family patriarch, reportedly killed himself; other family members were handed over to the Chinese authorities. Some have made remorseful confessions.</p><p>Thousands of those working in the scam centres have also been handed over to the Chinese police. </p><p>With these sentences China is signalling its determination to deal harshly with the scam business on its border. Pressure from Beijing also forced Thailand to take action against scam centres along its border with Myanmar earlier this year. </p><p>Despite this the business has adapted, with much of it now operating in Cambodia, though it is still prevalent in Myanmar.</p></div>"

But the government has previously defended its use of the death penalty, saying it is limited to only \"the most severe crimes\".</p></div><div><p>It comes on the same day as Iran said a man accused of spying for Israel had been executed.</p><p>The judiciary's Mizan news agency named him as Bahman Choubi Asl and reported that he was a database expert who worked on \"sensitive telecommunications projects\" and was a \"trusted spy\" of Israel's Mossad intelligence agency, without providing any evidence.</p><p>He was hanged on Monday after the Supreme Court rejected his appeal against his conviction on the charge of \"corruption on Earth\", it added.</p><p>Mizan did not say when Asl was arrested, and his case had not previously been reported by Iranian media or human rights groups.</p><p>He was the 11th man convicted of spying for Israel to be executed by Iran this year, with 10 of the executions carried out since the 12-day war between the two countries in June.</p></div><div><p>Last week, Amnesty International and the Norway-based group Iran Human Rights said they had documented the executions of 1,000 people in Iran since January - already surpassing last year's reported total of 975.</p><p><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://iranhr.net/en/articles/8065/\">According to Iran Human Rights</a>, 50% of those executed this year were accused of drug-related charges; 43% of murder; 3% of the security-related charges of \"armed rebellion against the state\", \"corruption on Earth\" and \"enmity against God\"; and 1% of spying.</p><p>They included 28 women, 58 Afghan nationals and what Amnesty described as a disproportionate number of people from minority communities. </p><p>Both groups said the executions followed routinely unfair trials that were marred by allegations of torture and other ill-treatment.</p><p>\"Iran appears to be conducting executions at an industrial scale that defies all accepted standards of human rights protection,\" the UN special rapporteurs on human rights in Iran, arbitrary executions, minority issues, torture and other cruel punishment, and human rights in Afghanistan, warned on Monday.</p><p>The hanging of 499 people for drug-related offences was \"particularly alarming\", they added.</p><p>Between 24 and 30 such executions were recorded per year from 2018 to 2020, following an amendment to Iran's Law on Combating Illicit Drugs. However, the experts said the number has surged since 2021, with a total of 503 reported last year.</p><p>International law restricts capital punishment to only the \"most serious crimes\". \"Drug offences do not meet this threshold,\" the experts warned.</p><p>Iran Human Rights reported on Sunday that more than 500 people convicted of drug-related offences were currently on death row at Ghezel Hesar prison in Karaj alone, and that their sentences were all at the \"implementation stage\".</p><p>Iran's powerful constitutional watchdog the Guardian Council is also currently reviewing a draft espionage bill that redefines \"collaboration with hostile states\", which is punishable by the death penalty, to include acts such as online communication, collaborating with foreign media, and so-called \"ideological alignment\", according to the UN human rights office.</p><p>The UN experts said the international community could not \"remain silent in the face of such systemic violations\" and that states \"must take concrete diplomatic action to pressure Iran to halt this execution spree\".</p></div>"

They also found the suspect's makeshift explosive devices, said James Deir, an agent of the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives.</p><p>Less than 10 minutes after the shooting, the gunman died in a shootout with police, officials said. </p><p>Investigators said on Monday that they had interviewed over 100 victims and witnesses as a part of the investigation and spent the whole night processing the scene of the crime. </p></div><p></p><h2>What do we know about the suspect? </h2><p></p><div><p>Though officials have not given a motive, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt told Fox News that Sanford was \"an individual who hated people of the Mormon faith\".</p><p>Officials have said the suspect was a former Marine who was once deployed to Iraq. </p><p>Sanford told local outlet Clarkston News that he was a sergeant in the Marines and was deployed to Fallujah in Iraq in 2007. </p><p>\"I'm excited to go,\" he told the newspaper. \"There are many changes we are making in the Middle East, we are making progress.\"</p><p>Sanford had previous arrests for a burglary and operating a vehicle while intoxicated, officials said on Monday. </p><p>Not much information is available about the suspect's political beliefs, but his Facebook profile features a photo of him in 2019 wearing what appears to be a shirt promoting the re-election of Donald Trump in 2020. </p><p>A Google Street View image of a property linked to Sanford also appears to show a pro-Trump sign outside of the house. </p><p>Sanford also appeared to be a father of a son who had serious health issues, according to posts from his family and a fundraising page. </p><p>Sanford is from a suburb of Flint of about 30,000 people, just a few miles away from Grand Blanc Township. </p></div></article>"

Its football titles, now known as EA FC, have sold 325 million copies since the first release in 1993.</p><p>The Sims has sold more than 200 million copies, and Need For Speed more than 150 million.</p><p>But it has also been the publisher of many other popular titles - often being the partner of choice for games in the Harry Potter and James Bond series in the past.</p><p>The purchase will be a big gaming feather in the cap of Saudi Arabia, which has been increasing its presence in the industry in recent years.</p><p>In March 2025, the nation's investment fund paid $3.5bn to purchase the gaming division of Niantic - giving it control of the hit mobile game Pokémon Go.</p><p>The purchase became part of Scopely Inc - makers of Monopoly Go - which itself was bought by PIF subsidiary Savvy Games Group for $4.9bn in 2023.</p><p>Saudi Arabia has made waves in the eSports industry, hosting major tournaments including the eSports World Cup, and it will also host 2027's planned Olympic esports Games.</p><p>The country already has stakes in other big gaming firms such as Nintendo and Take-Two Interactive, but the EA purchase marks a significant extension of its reach.</p><p>Its PIF has hundreds of billions in assets due to its oil wealth, and it is controlled by the country's prince Mohammed bin Salman, whose government has been accused of human rights violations.</p><p>A 2019 UN report stated \"the state of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia is responsible\" for the death of Jamal Khashoggi, a journalist who was critical of the country's government.</p><p>Saudi Arabia has always denied this.</p></div><figure><div><p><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20250919-090805-05e5ba0164-web-2.30.1-2/grey-placeholder.png\" /><img srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/41d3/live/348b21e0-26a8-11f0-8f57-b7237f6a66e6.png.webp 240w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/41d3/live/348b21e0-26a8-11f0-8f57-b7237f6a66e6.png.webp 320w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/41d3/live/348b21e0-26a8-11f0-8f57-b7237f6a66e6.png.webp 480w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/41d3/live/348b21e0-26a8-11f0-8f57-b7237f6a66e6.png.webp 640w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/41d3/live/348b21e0-26a8-11f0-8f57-b7237f6a66e6.png.webp 800w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/41d3/live/348b21e0-26a8-11f0-8f57-b7237f6a66e6.png.webp 1024w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/41d3/live/348b21e0-26a8-11f0-8f57-b7237f6a66e6.png.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/41d3/live/348b21e0-26a8-11f0-8f57-b7237f6a66e6.png.webp\" alt=\"A green promotional banner with black squares and rectangles forming pixels, moving in from the right.
