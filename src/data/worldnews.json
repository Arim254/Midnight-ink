She was the step-aunt and godmother of the late rapper Tupac Shakur. </p><p>She became involved in political activism for black Americans while in college, first with the Black Panther Party, a group that favoured radical resistance to racism in the United States and developed schools and other social services for black people.</p><p>The movement was heavily surveilled by the FBI, which considered it a threat to the US. Shakur also joined the more radical Black Liberation Army, whose membership consisted of former Black Panthers.</p><p>Shakur was travelling with fellow activists in 1973 when their car was stopped by New Jersey officers. A shoot-out ensued in which state trooper Werner Foerster and fellow activist Zayd Malik Shakur were killed. Assata Shakur was also injured in the shootout.</p><p>She was arrested and tried for Foerster's death, but denied shooting him and said her trial in front of an all-white jury was unfair.</p><p>She told NBC News in a <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/video/nbc-confronts-fugitive-cop-killer-in-cuba-part-one-647806019924\">1998 interview</a> filmed in Havana that she escaped because she was afraid for her life and that she \"would never receive justice\" in the US.</p><p>Her exile in Cuba was among the many thorny issues between the communist-run island and the US.</p><p>Shakur was the first woman to be added to the FBI's Most Wanted Terrorists list. The agency and New Jersey each offered a $1m (Â£746,000) reward for information leading to her arrest.</p><p>She was celebrated in music, with her name featuring in songs such as 1998's Rebel Without a Pause by hip-hop group Public Enemy and A Song for Assata by the rapper Common.</p><p>Shakur is survived by her daughter Kakuya Shakur, who wrote on Facebook: \"Words cannot describe the depth of loss that I am feeling at this time.\"</p></div></article></div>"

Musk has previously been quoted as saying that Epstein had invited him to the island but he had declined.</p><p>The partial records are from the third batch of documents produced by the Jeffrey Epstein Estate. Democrats on the House Oversight Committee say they include phone message logs, copies of flight logs and manifests for aircrafts, copies of financial ledgers and Epstein's daily schedule.</p><p>In addition to Musk and Prince Andrew, the files released publicly also contain the names of other prominent figures including internet entrepreneur Peter Thiel and Steve Bannon, a former advisor to Donald Trump</p><p>One line in the records dated 6 December 2014 reads: \"Reminder: Elon Musk to island Dec. 6 (is this still happening?)\"</p><p>A flight manifest records that Prince Andrew was on a flight with Epstein and his associate Ghislaine Maxwell from Teterboro, New Jersey, to West Palm Beach, Florida, on 12 May 2000. Maxwell was convicted in 2021 of conspiring with Epstein to traffic girls for sex.</p><p>One heavily redacted ledger records two references of payments for massages for an 'Andrew' in February and May 2000. While Palace records, photographs and press reports from the time indicate Prince Andrew had travelled to the US around the time of the dates recorded in the newly released document, it is not clear who the 'Andrew' referred to in the ledger is.</p><p>On 11 May 2000, Buckingham Palace said on its website that Prince Andrew had flown to New York to attend a reception in New York for the National Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children. Andrew returned to the UK on 15 May, a later entry said.</p></div><div><p>In the files, there is also an entry referring to a planned lunch with Peter Thiel in November 2017. </p><p>There is also an entry referring to a planned breakfast with Steve Bannon 17 February 2019.</p><p>The files also mention tentative plans for a breakfast party with Microsoft founder Bill Gates in December 2014. In 2022 Gates told the BBC that meeting Jeffrey Epstein had been a \"mistake\".</p><p>It is not suggested that those mentioned in the files were aware of the alleged criminal activity for which Epstein was later arrested.</p><p>Epstein died by suicide in a New York jail cell in August 2019 while awaiting trial on sex trafficking charges.</p><p>In 2008, he reached a plea deal with prosecutors after the parents of a 14-year-old girl told police in Florida that Epstein had molested their daughter at his Palm Beach home. </p><p>He was arrested again in July 2019 on sex trafficking charges.</p><p>Sara Guerrero, a spokesperson for the Democrats on the committee, urged Attorney General Pam Bondi to release more files related to Epstein.</p><p>\"It should be clear to every American that Jeffrey Epstein was friends with some of the most powerful and wealthiest men in the world. Every new document produced provides new information as we work to bring justice for the survivors and victims,\" she said.</p><p>Republicans on the committee accused the Democrats of \"putting politics over victims\" and said they would release the full set of documents soon.</p></div>"

Then a week later the case was closed again with no further action taken.</p><p>The inspector general was critical of Mr Comey's handling of the case and Clinton blamed his actions for her election defeat.</p><p>A few months later he was out of a job, fired by Donald Trump, the new president.</p></div><p></p><h2>Why did Trump fire Comey?</h2><p></p><div><p>At the time, Mr Comey was leading an investigation into Russian election interference and whether there were any links between Moscow and Trump's campaign.</p><p>The White House said the firing was over Mr Comey's handling of the Clinton probe.

Outside, protesters against Israel's war in Gaza gathered in Times Square.</p><p>Israel has come under huge international pressure over its military action in Gaza, culminating in the UK, France, Canada, Australia and other countries <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/ce800enrglzo\">recognising a Palestinian state</a> this week.</p></div><div><p>In his opening remarks, Netanyahu displayed a map labelled \"The Curse\"<b> </b>that he said showed Iranian proxy groups across the Middle East. He then highlighted Israeli military operations across the past year against Hezbollah in Lebanon, the Houthis in Yemen, Hamas in Gaza, and Iran.</p><p>He thanked US President Donald Trump for American involvement in bombing Iran's Fordo nuclear site in June, and drew parallels between Hamas's 7 October 2023 attack on Israel and the 9/11 attack on the US. He said the two countries were fighting the same enemies, pointing to chants of \"death to America\" by groups linked to Iran. </p></div><div><p>The Israeli prime minister repeated that Israel would not allow a Palestinian state to exist and said this position was supported by the vast majority of Israelis. </p><p>He went on to rebuff the conclusion of a UN commission of inquiry that<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c8641wv0n4go\"> Israel had committed genocide in Gaza</a>, claiming the charge was \"baseless\". </p><p>He also rejected statements by multiple UN agencies that Israel was deliberately restricting the amount of aid entering Gaza. In August, a <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/ckg4p90z1kxo\">UN-backed body confirmed that famine</a> was taking place in Gaza City.</p><p>Ahead of his speech, Netanyahu's office ordered that the Israeli military mount loudspeakers on trucks near the Gaza perimeter fence in order to broadcast his words live across the territory.</p><p>Netanyahu also claimed that Israeli intelligence had hacked the smartphones of people in Gaza and would stream his speech to them directly. BBC sources in Gaza said their phones had not been affected.</p><p>He said the intention of this was for a message to reach Israeli hostages there.</p><p>\"Our brave heroes,\" he read on the podium. \"This is Prime Minister Netanyahu speaking to you live from the United Nations.â©We have not forgotten you, not even for a second. The people of Israel are with you. We will not falter, and we will not rest until we bring all of you home.\"</p><p>There are 48 hostages remaining in Gaza, 20 of whom are thought to be alive.</p><p>Gaza resident Fadi told the BBC World Service's OS programme: \"What does he gain by broadcasting his speech forcibly to the besieged civilians inside the tents, except to further humiliate them?\" </p><p>Netanyahu devoted the latter section of his address to Israel's regional neighbours, saying it was close to a de-escalation agreement with Syria and calling on the Lebanese government to step-up its efforts to disarm Hezbollah.</p><p>He immediately came under fire within Israel, with opposition leader Yair Lapid writing: \"Today saw a weary and whining Israeli prime minister, in a speech overloaded with overused gimmicks.</p><p>\"Instead of stopping the diplomatic tsunami - Netanyahu today worsened the state of the State of Israel.\"</p><p>Yair Golan, leader of Israel's Democrats party, said the speech showed \"only victimhood, sanctimoniousness, and complete blindness to the suffering of the hostages and the sacrifice of the fighters\". </p><p>He labelled the loudspeaker stunt \"invalid, childish, and insane\", saying it was \"propaganda show\". </p><p>A day earlier, Palestinian Authority leader Mahmoud Abbas said in his speech to the General Assembly that he is ready to work with world leaders to <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/czdjgdnjnlgo\">implement a peace plan</a> for Israel and the Palestinians. </p><p>Shortly after Netanyahu finished speaking, Trump separately told journalists: \"I think we have a deal on Gaza.\" He did not provide further details, though speculation has been mounting that a ceasefire deal could be close.</p><p>International journalists have been banned by Israel from entering the Gaza Strip independently since the start of the war nearly two years ago, making verifying claims from both sides difficult. Some journalists have been taken into Gaza by the IDF under controlled access.</p><p>The Israeli military launched a campaign in Gaza in response to the Hamas-led attack on southern Israel on 7 October 2023, in which about 1,200 people were killed and 251 others were taken hostage.</p><p>At least 65,549 people have been killed in Israeli attacks in Gaza since then, according to the territory's Hamas-run health ministry. </p></div>"

It would seek a UN mandate to be Gaza's \"supreme political and legal authority\" for five years.</p><p>The plan would be modelled on the international administrations that oversaw East Timor and Kosovo's transitions to statehood. It would initially be based in Egypt, near Gaza's southern border, before entering Gaza once the Strip is stable, alongside a multinational force. </p><p>As PM, Blair took the decision to commit British forces to the 2003 Iraq War that was heavily criticised in the official inquiry into the conflict, which found he had acted on flawed intelligence without certainty about the production of weapons of mass destruction there.</p><p>After leaving office in 2007, Blair served as Middle East envoy for the Quartet of international powers (the US, EU, Russia and the UN). He focused on bringing economic development to Palestine and creating the conditions for a two state-solution.</p><p>Reports of discussions about his involvement in a transitional authority for Gaza come after Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas said on Thursday that he was ready to work with Trump and other world leaders to implement a two-state peace plan.</p><p>Abbas stressed his rejection of a future governing role for Hamas in Gaza and demanded it disarm.</p><p>Throughout the conflict, varying proposals for the future of Gaza have been tabled by multiple parties. </p><p>In February, Donald Trump floated plans - which since appear to have been dropped - for the US to take \"a long-term ownership position\" over Gaza, saying it could be the \"Riviera of the Middle East\". </p><p>The idea would have involved the forced displacement of Palestinians in the territory and be in violation of international law. The US and Israel said it would involve \"voluntary\" emigration.</p><p>In March, the US and Israel rejected an Arab plan for the post-war reconstruction of the Gaza Strip that would allow the 2.1 million Palestinians living there to stay in place. The Palestinian Authority and Hamas welcomed the Arab plan, which called for Gaza to be governed temporarily by a committee of independent experts and for international peacekeepers to be deployed there.</p><p>In July, a French and Saudi-led international conference in New York proposed a  \"transitional administrative committee\" for Gaza which would operate \"under the umbrella of the Palestinian Authority\".
