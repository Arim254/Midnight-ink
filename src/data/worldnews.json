    "body": "<div><div><p>10 hours ago</p></div><p><span><p><span>Jeremy Bowen</span><span>International Editor</span></p></span></p></div><div><p>Donald Trump's framework agreement for ending the Gaza war and reconstructing the devastated territory has momentum behind it. </p><p>Much of it comes from the president himself. Momentum comes too from leading Arab and Islamic countries who have supported the plan, including Jordan, Egypt, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, the UAE, Pakistan, Indonesia and Turkey. And Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, standing next to Donald Trump, accepted it too, despite the fact it contains talk of a pathway to a Palestinian state that he has repeatedly denounced.</p><p>To keep the pace up, Trump says that Hamas has \"three to four days\" to decide whether to say yes or no.</p><p>If the answer is no, the war goes on.</p><p>The proposed deal looks a lot like a plan put forward by Joe Biden well over a year ago. Since then there has been massive killing of Palestinian civilians, more destruction in Gaza, and now a famine, while Israeli hostages in Gaza have had to endure months more of agony and captivity.</p><p>There were many reports in the Israeli media that the Biden initiative failed because Netanyahu moved the goalposts with a new set of demands - under pressure from the hard right in his cabinet.</p><p>Even so, the framework plan is a significant moment. For the first time, Donald Trump is putting pressure on Israel to end the war. Donald Trump has made himself into a leader to whom it is hard to say no. Nobody wants to end up getting the roasting Ukraine's president Volodymyr Zelensky received in the Oval Office back in February. But things can change when leaders leave the White House.</p><p>Before Benjamin Netanyahu left Washington DC to go back to Israel his staff filmed him putting over his version of events. One element was the idea of an independent Palestine next to Israel, the two-state solution which the UK and other Western countries have tried to revive by recognising Palestine.</p><p>The Trump document gives an indeterminate nod to the idea of Palestinian independence. It says that after the reform of the Palestinian Authority, which is based in Ramallah and led by President Mahmoud Abbas, conditions \"may finally be in place for a credible pathway to Palestinian self-determination and statehood, which we recognise as the aspiration of the Palestinian people.\"</p><p>Even the thought of a distant prospect of a Palestinian state was too much for Netanyahu, who had given whole-hearted support to Trump at the White House, telling him in English \"I support your plan to end the war in Gaza, which achieves our war aims.\"</p><p>On the video, getting his message out in Hebrew to the people back home before the long flight home, Netanyahu is asked if he agreed to a Palestinian state. He was emphatic.</p><p>\"No, absolutely not. It's not even written in the agreement. But we did say one thing. That we would forcibly resist a Palestinian state.\" Trump, he said, agreed.</p></div><div><p>Momentum is the plan's strength. Its weakness is the lack of detail, a characteristic of Trumpian diplomacy. The document that Trump and Netanyahu endorsed, which also has the support of the UK and other European countries, comes with a rough map of stages of an IDF pull-back, but none of the nuts and bolts that determine whether diplomatic agreements designed to end a war hold together or disintegrate.</p><p>If it is to work, hard negotiation will be necessary. In that process there will be many opportunities for it to break down.</p><p>Mainstream opposition parties in Israel have endorsed the plan. It has been condemned by the extremist ultra-nationalists in the Netanyahu coalition, who had loved the \"Trump Riviera\" plan mooted at the start of the year, launched with a bizarre video showing the leaders of Israel and the US in beach gear sipping cocktails to the backdrop of a new Gazan cityscape glittering glass towers. The Israeli hard right were delighted that the Riviera plan included the removal of all of Gaza's more than two million Palestinians. Jewish extremists want the land annexed and Palestinians replaced with Jewish settlers.</p><p>The new plan says no Palestinian will be forced to leave. Bezalel Smotrich, the ultranationalist finance minister and settler leader, compared it to the Munich agreement, signed this week in 1938. At Munich the UK and France forced Czechoslovakia to surrender territory and not long after its independence to Nazi Germany.</p><p>If Hamas accepts the agreement, and if Benjamin Netanyahu wants to find ways to placate Smotrich and the other extremists who keep his coalition in power, he will have plenty of chances to sabotage the negotiations in ways that put the blame on Hamas. The structure of the Trump framework agreement allows Israel a range of opportunities to veto moves it does not like.</p><p>It may not be possible to end a deep-seated conflict that has lasted more than a century. Longer term, the UK and many countries outside Israel and the US believe that any attempted solution that does not lead to Palestinian independence will not bring peace.</p><p>When the foreign ministers of the Arab and Islamic countries issued their statement of support, they said that they believed it would lead to a full Israeli withdrawal and rebuilding of Gaza, and \"a path for just peace on basis of two-state solution under which Gaza is fully integrated with the West Bank in Palestinian state in accordance with international law.\" That could be taken as a coded reference to the decision of the International Court of Justice that the occupation of Palestinian land by Israel is illegal.</p><p>Netanyahu believes the deal takes him closer to Israel's elusive victory over Hamas. He denies any Palestinian right to the land between the river Jordan and the sea.</p><p>One plan, two very different versions of what it means. The framework is ambiguous enough for both interpretations to be possible. That is not a promising start.</p></div>"

Krah is now an MP in the German parliament.</p><p>The court in Dresden in eastern Germany had heard how Krah's former aide had gathered information and passed on confidential documents to Chinese authorities. </p><p>Jian Guo had maintained his innocence, insisting he had not worked for Chinese intelligence, and Krah told the court last month he had only learned about allegations against his ex-employee from the media.</p></div><div><p>The defendant, a German national, was accused by prosecutors of working for Chinese intelligence since 2002, in a case that fuelled concerns about China's spy activities in the European Union.</p><p>He had also been accused of spying on Chinese dissidents and opposition figures in Germany.</p><p>The court in Dresden said it was a particularly serious case, although in his final statement Jian Guo told the trial last week: \"I did not work for a Chinese intelligence agency and I am innocent.\"</p><p>Jian Guo was alleged to have acted as a handler for a Chinese national working for a logistics company at Leipzig airport who was given a suspended jail term. </p><p>The woman, identified a Yaqi X, was accused of providing data on cargo, flights and passengers. She had admitted passing on information but denied any knowledge of spying activities.</p><p>Reacting to his former aide's jail term, Krah told news agency DPA that \"immediately after the arrest I took the necessary action and significantly increased security in my office\".</p><p>The AfD politician resigned from his seat in the European Parliament earlier this year after he was elected to the Bundestag in February, when he ran for election in the eastern state of Saxony.</p><p>He is currently under investigation by the Dresden Public Prosecutor's Office. The investigation is reported to involve allegations of money laundering and corruption as an elected representative in the European Parliament.</p><p>Krah has called the accusations \"absurd and politically motivated\".</p></div>"

    "body": "<div><div><p>20 hours ago</p></div><p><span><p><span>Imran Qureshi</span><span>BBC News, Bengaluru</span></p></span></p></div><div><p>A Russian woman who made global headlines after being found living in a cave in India with her two young daughters has flown back to her country, an official told the BBC.</p><p>Nina Kutina, 40, and her daughters - aged six and five - <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c8d68848d34o\">were rescued on 9 July</a> by policemen on a routine patrol in a forest in the southern state of Karnataka.</p><p>The woman, who did not have valid documents to stay in India, had been sent to a foreigners' detention centre along with her daughters.</p><p>Last week, the Karnataka high court asked the federal government to issue documents to Ms Kutina and her daughters to return home.</p></div><div><p>They left for Russia on 28 September, an official at the Foreigners' Regional Registration Office (FRRO), who wanted to stay anonymous, told BBC Hindi. Ms Kutina's minor son from another relationship, who was later found living in Goa state, also went with them.</p><p>The high court had been hearing a petition filed by Dror Shlomo Goldstein, an Israeli businessman living in Goa, who said he was the father of the two minor girls. He had asked the court to stop the children from being sent back to Russia and appealed for their custody.</p><p>Mr Goldstein hasn't commented on the court order yet. He has the option to appeal against it, but it's not clear whether a judgment in his favour could compel the children to be sent back to India.</p><p>Mr Goldstein had earlier told a TV channel that Ms Kutina had left Goa without informing him and that he had filed a police complaint. He also said that he had been \"providing for their [the woman and the two minor girls] well-being for a long time\".</p><p>In the order, the court however said that despite Mr Goldstein's claims, the mum and the children had \"rather inexplicably\"  been \"found in an isolated cave\". </p><p>The court also said that Mr Goldstein could not explain why they had been living in the cave \"until they were found there and the authorities began [taking] action for their rehabilitation\". </p></div><div><p>The police team that found the three had earlier said they were on a routine patrol near Ramteertha hills in the Gokarna forest, which borders the tourist paradise of Goa, when they spotted brightly coloured clothes hung near a cave. </p><p>When they got closer - the entrance to the cave had been curtained off with brightly coloured saris - they saw a \"little blonde girl\" running out. When the shocked policemen followed her inside, they found Ms Kutina and the other child.</p><p>The three of them had meagre possessions - plastic mats, clothes, packets of instant noodles and some other grocery items - and the cave was leaking.</p><ul><li><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c8d68848d34o\">Mystery surrounds Russian mum and children found in Indian cave</a></li></ul><p>The police told the BBC in July that they had a tough time convincing the mother that it was dangerous to stay in the isolated location with snakes and wild animals in the forest. The police quoted her as saying: \"Animals and snakes are our friends. Humans are dangerous.\"</p><p>Police said she told them that they had been living in the cave for a week when they were found. She also told the police that she came to Karnataka from Goa where she also claimed to have lived in a cave. She said that her youngest daughter was born in a Goa cave.</p><p>Ms Kutina had defended her lifestyle in video interviews to Indian news agency ANI, saying she and her children were happy living like that and that \"nature gives good health\".</p><p>The police, however, said that they could not take any chances as the area was prone to landslides during the monsoon season.</p><p>Ms Kutina and her daughters were taken for a medical examination and then shifted to a detention centre.</p><p>Mr Goldstein's lawyer, Beena PK, argued in court that deportation would not be in the interests of the children, citing India being a signatory to the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child and provisions of the Goa Children Act, 2003.</p><p>But the lawyer for the federal government, Arvind Kamath, told the court that this case could not be described as deportation' because Ms Kutina herself had written to the Russian embassy expressing her wish to return to her home country.</p><p>Court documents show that the Russian embassy offered Ms Kutina and the children an emergency travel window between 26 September and 9 October.</p><p><i>Follow BBC News India on </i><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.instagram.com/bbcnewsindia/\"><i>Instagram</i></a><i>, </i><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.youtube.com/@bbcnewsindia/featured\"><i>YouTube,</i></a><i> </i><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://x.com/BBCIndia\"><i>Twitter</i></a><i> and </i><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.facebook.com/bbcindia/\"><i>Facebook</i></a><i>.</i></p></div>"

    "body": "<div><div><p>10 hours ago</p></div><p><span><p><span>Rushdi Abualouf</span><span>Gaza correspondent, Istanbul</span></p></span></p></div><div><p>A senior Hamas figure has told the BBC that the group is likely to reject Donald Trump's peace plan for Gaza, saying it \"serves Israel's interests\" and \"ignores those of the Palestinian people\".</p><p>The figure said that Hamas is unlikely to agree to disarming and handing over their weapons - a key condition of Trump's plan.</p><p>Hamas is also said to object to the deployment of an International Stabilisation Force (ISF) in Gaza, which it views as a new form of occupation.</p><p>Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu accepted Trump's plan during White House talks on Monday. Hamas has not yet given an official response.</p></div><div><p>Qatar's foreign ministry has said Hamas is studying the White House proposal \"responsibly\".</p><p>A senior Palestinian official with knowledge of Hamas talks told the BBC they involve the group's leadership both inside and outside of Gaza.</p><p>The group's military commander in the territory, Ez al-Din al-Haddad, is thought to be determined to keep fighting rather than accept the plan on offer. Hamas figures outside Gaza have recently found themselves sidelined in discussions as they do not have direct control over the hostages.</p></div><div><p>Hamas talks, which are expected to take several days, also include other Palestinian factions.</p><p>The armed group Palestinian Islamic Jihad (PIJ), which took part in the 7 October attack and previously held some Israeli hostages, rejected the plan on Tuesday.</p><p>For Hamas, a key sticking point is thought to be that the plan requires them to hand over all of the hostages in one go - giving away their only bargaining chip.</p><p>Even with Donald Trump's backing for the plan, there is a lack of trust that Israel will not resume its military operations once it has received the hostages - particularly after it attempted to assassinate Hamas leadership in Doha earlier this month, in defiance of the US.</p><p>Additionally, a map of Gaza shared by the Trump administration shows what appears to be a planned buffer zone along Gaza's southern border with Egypt. It is unclear how this would be administered, but if Israel is involved it is also likely to be a point of contention.</p><p>Further, since agreeing to the plan on Monday evening, Netanyahu has appeared to push back on several of the terms it outlines.</p><p>In a video shared on X, he insists that the Israeli military would be able to remain in parts of Gaza and that Israel said it would \"forcibly resist\" a Palestinian state.</p><p>This goes against the terms of Trump's framework, which stipulates complete withdrawal of Israeli forces and says that once the plan is complete there may be a  \"credible pathway to Palestinian self-determination and statehood\".</p><p>Within Gaza, Palestinians were broadly supportive of the plan, but only because it would lead to an end to the war. </p><p>Resident Khadar Abu Kweik told the BBC: \"The American plan has bad clauses, but I support it because it will stop the war and get rid of Hamas. Even if the devil himself brought a plan to end this hell we are living in, I would support it.\"</p><p>Palestinian journalist Fathi Sabah said: \"A Hamas rejection, god forbid, would mean giving Netanyahu a green light to continue the war with American and Western backing, to destroy what remains of Gaza and the central region.\"</p><p>\"The people of Gaza cannot bear that. They are devastated, exhausted, desperate and hopeless,\" he said.</p><p>\"They want a ceasefire now, not tomorrow, at any cost, even though they know the plan serves Netanyahu's interests, is full of pitfalls, and does not reflect their aspirations,\" he added. </p><p>The Israeli military launched a campaign in Gaza in response to the Hamas-led attack on southern Israel on 7 October 2023, in which about 1,200 people were killed and 251 others were taken hostage.</p><p>At least 66,097 people have been killed in Israeli attacks in Gaza since then, according to the territory's Hamas-run health ministry.</p><p>In August, a UN-backed body confirmed that famine was taking place in Gaza City. Earlier this month, a UN commission of inquiry concluded that Israel had committed genocide in Gaza - which Israel strongly rejects.</p></div>"

The UN said it risked inflicting significant harm.</p><p>Communication within Afghanistan, and out to the wider world, has been severely affected, as have essential services - including banking and payments - and access to online education, a lifeline for many women and girls.</p><p>Kabul airport, meanwhile, was \"nearly deserted\", according to one resident, with no evidence of planes arriving or leaving. </p></div><div><p>#Flight tracking service Flightradar24 showed that a handful of incoming and outgoing flights on Tuesday had been cancelled. Many more simply had their status marked as \"unknown\".</p><p>One passenger who planned to fly into Kabul International Airport on Tuesday was told there would be no flights until Thursday at the earliest.</p><p>Another local said all flights from Kabul airport had been cancelled since Monday evening. </p><p>He added that life in Kabul \"seems to be normal\", but added that there was \"no communication at all\" across the country.</p><p>The United Nations mission in Afghanistan called on the Taliban authorities to immediately and fully restore nationwide internet and telecommunications access.</p><p>\"The cut in access has left Afghanistan almost completely cut off from the outside world, and risks inflicting significant harm on the Afghan people, including by threatening economic stability and exacerbating one of the world's worst humanitarian crises,\" it said in a statement.</p></div><p></p><h2>'We are blind without internet'</h2><p></p><div><p>The Taliban government have for weeks been severing fibre-optic internet connections across several provinces.</p><p>It began in a handful of provinces, but did not impact the capital Kabul until Monday, with several people telling the BBC their fibre-optic internet stopped working towards the end of the working day, around 17:00 local time (12:30 GMT).</p><p>And on Tuesday, many awoke across the country to find essential services paralysed. </p><p>Najibullah, a 42-year-old shopkeeper in Kabul, told news agency AFP that residents felt like they were left \"blind without phones and internet\". </p><p>\"All our business relies on mobiles. The deliveries are with mobiles. It's like a holiday, everyone is at home. The market is totally frozen.\"</p><p>Another Kabul local, who did not wish to be identified, said that banks across the capital were open, but that there were huge crowds wanting to withdraw money, but that only \"very little cash\" could be paid out. </p><p>However, a money changer in the country's southern Helmand province said all banks in his area were closed and that he was not able to process payments.</p><p>Diplomatic officials had earlier warned the BBC that the internet cuts could affect banking and e-commerce systems nationwide.</p><p>International news agencies also say they have lost contact with offices in the capital Kabul. Mobile internet and satellite TV has also been severely disrupted across the country. </p><p>Tolo News, a privately owned Afghan news channel, told people to follow its social media pages for updates as it expected disruptions to its television and radio networks.</p></div><figure><div><p><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20250919-090805-05e5ba0164-web-2.30.1-2/grey-placeholder.png\" /><img srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/0203/live/f08a4b00-9d68-11f0-a16f-ff7724a733bf.jpg.webp 240w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/0203/live/f08a4b00-9d68-11f0-a16f-ff7724a733bf.jpg.webp 320w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/0203/live/f08a4b00-9d68-11f0-a16f-ff7724a733bf.jpg.webp 480w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/0203/live/f08a4b00-9d68-11f0-a16f-ff7724a733bf.jpg.webp 640w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/0203/live/f08a4b00-9d68-11f0-a16f-ff7724a733bf.jpg.webp 800w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/0203/live/f08a4b00-9d68-11f0-a16f-ff7724a733bf.jpg.webp 1024w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/0203/live/f08a4b00-9d68-11f0-a16f-ff7724a733bf.jpg.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/0203/live/f08a4b00-9d68-11f0-a16f-ff7724a733bf.jpg.webp\" alt=\"WAKIL KOHSAR/AFP via Getty Images A man sitting at a money exchange stall playing on his phone.\" /><span>WAKIL KOHSAR/AFP via Getty Images</span></p></div><p></p><figcaption>Mobile internet and satellite TV have been severely disrupted across Afghanistan</figcaption><p></p></figure><div><p>One Kabul journalist told the BBC that they were unable to even call or contact guests for interviews, and needed to send camera crews directly to their interviewees' homes. </p><p>\"We have never experienced such [a] thing,\" he added. </p><p>Several residents, who requested anonymity, previously told the BBC that their businesses and lives had been seriously affected by the internet cuts.</p><p>A man who works as a money changer in Takhar province said that his daughters' online English classes were disrupted. \"Their last opportunity to study and stay engaged is now gone,\" he said.</p><p>Another woman previously told the BBC that she could not attend online classes since her home internet was cut off. \"I had hoped to finish my studies and find an online job, but that dream has also been destroyed,\" she said. \"Without internet access, I don't know what will happen next.\"</p></div><p></p><h2>A 'total internet blackout'</h2><p></p><div><p>In an earlier post on social network <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://mastodon.social/@netblocks/115287724541487948\">Mastodon.social</a>, Netblocks had said the country was \"in the midst of a total internet blackout as Taliban authorities move to implement morality measures, with multiple networks disconnected through the morning in a stepwise manner; telephone services are currently also impacted\".</p><p>A spokesperson for the Taliban governor in Balkh wrote on X earlier this month that the ban on fibre-optic internet was meant to curb \"evils\".

    "body": "<div><div><p>12 hours ago</p></div><p><span><p><span>Lucy Williamson</span><span>Middle East Correspondent, Jerusalem</span></p></span></p></div><div><p>He promised total victory for Israel, but standing next to Donald Trump at the White House on Monday, it was Benjamin Netanyahu who looked defeated.</p><p>Israel's prime minister was saying all the right things about the peace deal he had just agreed to, but he seemed deflated, his voice hoarse and his energy dimmed, as he praised Trump as \"the greatest friend Israel has ever had in the White House\".</p><p>It is a friendship that could cost him his government.</p><p>Netanyahu's far-right allies have threatened to leave – and possibly collapse – his government if he makes too many concessions in ending the war. Coalition partners like Bezalel Smotrich and Itamar Ben-Gvir have made little secret of their desire to annex Gaza, drive out Palestinians and re-establish Jewish settlements there. </p><p>They – and Netanyahu – have been implacably opposed to any role for the Palestinian Authority in Gaza, and any pathway to a Palestinian State. The deal Netanyahu has now agreed to outlines both, though with heavy caveats.</p><p>Trump knows that by pushing the Israeli prime minister into this deal, he is asking him to risk his government. In return, he is dangling the prospect of a historic legacy – a new, more peaceful future for the region, and new ties between Israel and its Arab neighbours.</p></div><div><p>There were signs, even before Netanyahu left for Washington, that he knew this choice was coming.</p><p>Israel's president, Isaac Herzog, told an Israeli radio station that he was considering pardoning Netanyahu in the corruption cases he is currently facing in court. These trials are one reason, his critics allege, that he is reluctant to leave office and face the judges without the shield of his national duties, power and profile.</p><p>But the political exit being offered to him in this moment – a regional legacy in return for giving up his government, and possibly his political career – does not seem to have entirely won him over.</p><p>His first response to his countrymen today has been to publicly emphasise that he did not, in fact, agree to a Palestinian state.</p><p>\"Absolutely not. It's not even written in the agreement,\" he said in response to a question on camera. \"But we did say one thing – that we would forcibly resist a Palestinian state.\"</p><p>Reports in the Israeli media this morning also suggest that Israel's cabinet will not get to vote on the full terms of the deal – but only on the exchange of Israeli hostages for Palestinian prisoners.</p><p>The question is what these actions signify about his political calculation: whether Netanyahu is trying to hold his government together long enough to work his political magic on the polls, which currently predict he would lose an election, or whether he is banking on Hamas rejecting this deal – or being unable to control its commanders on the ground in Gaza – and that the war will not stop at all.</p><p>The potential continuation of the war was something he emphasised in that uncomfortable press conference in Washington, underlining – with Trump's backing – that Israel would have free rein to \"finish the job\" if Hamas failed to deliver on its side of the deal. Seen in that light, this uncomfortable moment could be the price of continuing American support for his war.</p><p>Netanyahu is known as a master of political manoeuvres, threading a path between political roadblocks to buy time. He has shifted position through previous rounds of negotiations, and has ridden through previous ceasefire deals, only to back out when a permanent end to the war is up for discussion.</p><p>Many believe he has never wanted to negotiate an end to this war, but to force Hamas into a surrender on Israel's terms. But it is hard to maintain that uncompromising image of \"total victory\" when you have publicly conceded to the very things you have spent a career preventing, and when you are waiting for your enemy's response.</p><p>For the first time since the war began, it seems that the consequences of avoiding this deal were worse than the consequences of agreeing to it. And if Trump really did force him to choose between his ally in Washington and his allies at home, why didn't Joe Biden do the same when a similar deal was on the table nine months ago – and at least 20,000 more Gazans were still alive?</p></div>"

They banned girls over the age of 12 from getting an education, severely restricted job options for women and recently removed books written by women from universities.</p><p>For Fahima, the internet was her last lifeline to the outside world. </p><p>\"I recently enrolled in an online university [and] I had hoped to finish my studies and find an online job,\" she said. </p><p>On Tuesday, that lifeline was cut off when the Taliban imposed a nationwide internet shutdown that is set to last indefinitely. </p><p>\"Our last hope was online learning. Now [even] that dream has been destroyed,\" said Fahima.</p><p>Her real name has been changed to protect her identity, as have the names of all others interviewed for this article.</p></div><div><p>Over the past few weeks, the Taliban government began severing fibre-optic internet connections across several provinces, saying this was part of an effort to prevent immorality. </p><p>For many, they feared this might be the first step towards an entire internet shutdown.</p><p>And on Tuesday, their worst fears came true. The country is currently experiencing a \"total internet blackout\" according to internet watchdog Netblocks - a move that has paralysed the country's essential services. </p><p>International news agencies say they have lost contact with offices in the capital Kabul. Mobile internet and satellite TV has also been severely disrupted across Afghanistan. Flights from Kabul airport have also been disrupted, according to local media reports.</p><ul><li><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cdxqdy5nrlqo\">Flights in Afghanistan grounded after internet shutdown</a></li></ul><p>Ahead of the nationwide shutdown, the BBC spoke to some people in Afghanistan who detailed how the internet outages in their provinces had derailed their lives.</p><p>\"Before this, I studied midwifery, but unfortunately that programme was banned for women... the only hope left for us was the internet and online learning,\" said Shakiba, who lives in the northern province of Tahkar. </p><p>\"We want to study. We want to be educated. We want to be able to help people in our future. When I heard that the internet had been cut, the world felt dark to me.\"</p><p>It's a similar tale for Fahima, who says she now feels \"helpless\".</p><p>\"My two sisters [and I] were studying online. We used to stay updated on news and technology through the internet, but now we cannot keep up or learn new skills,\" said the student, who lives in an eastern province of Afghanistan. </p><p>\"We dreamed of finishing our education and helping our father financially, but now... we all sit at home doing nothing.\"</p><p>Since seizing power in 2021, the Taliban have imposed numerous restrictions in accordance with their interpretation of Islamic Sharia law.</p><p>Earlier this month they removed books written by women from the country's university teaching system as part of a new ban which has also outlawed the teaching of human rights and sexual harassment.</p><p>Around 140 books by women - including titles like \"Safety in the Chemical Laboratory\" - were found to be of \"concern\" due to \"anti-Sharia and Taliban policies\", said the Taliban. </p><p>The Taliban government has said it respects women's rights in accordance with their interpretation of Afghan culture and Islamic law.</p></div><div><p>But it's not just female students that have been affected - teachers like Zabi, who used to make a living through online teaching, have been similarly hit by the ban.</p><p>Zabi says he had previously worked as a journalist in Pakistan, but found no opportunities in the field when he returned to Afghanistan. He decided to open an English teaching centre - but was forced to take this online when authorities imposed restrictions on educational institutes, he says.</p><p>\"I had men and women in my classes - up to 70 or 80 students at a time. My students were happy and our lessons went smoothly,\" he said. \"They were all preparing for the IELTS [a standardised English test] and all their learning depended on the internet. The research, the practice tests, the official exams, everything.\"</p><p>Zabi, who also lives in the east of the country, adds that there is no IELTS centre in Afghanistan, so the only option for students is to take one online. </p><p>\"Two days ago, about 45 of my students were in the middle of an exam when the internet was cut off. They had been preparing for it for months, but they missed the opportunity. It was heartbreaking for them - and for me as their teacher.\"</p><p>He adds that he constantly gets calls from his students who don't know what to do. </p><p>\"They keep calling me asking 'Teacher, what should we do?' For the boys, there are still some English  centres open, but for my female students, this was their last chance. And now even that is gone.\"</p><p>Prior to Monday's shutdown, many of the interviewees say that there is still the option of being connected to mobile data - but that this is far too expensive for most, and that connectivity is patchy. A monthly plan with 100GB of data costs 3,500 Afghani, or around $50 (£37). In contrast, Wifi used to cost around 1,000 Afghani a month - which could be further split between a few students. </p><p>According to an earlier UNDP report, Afghanistan's per capita income stood at $306 in 2024. </p><p>Zabi says he will need to leave the country if the internet is not restored soon - saying he has no other way of earning a living. </p><p>The Taliban have yet to give an official reason for the shutdown. They had earlier said an alternative route for internet access would be created, but did not give any more details. </p><p>Anas, a money changer in Takhar province, says his business has faced \"enormous problems\" since the internet shutdown, saying that much of his work depends on the internet. </p><p>\"Our business has been affected by about 90%,\" he says. \"Yesterday, my brother who is also my business partner tried to send an email to a client. He couldn't get it through.\"</p><p>But his main concern are his three daughters - all of whom used to take online classes. </p><p>\"The night before, we heard the Taliban had cut internet access in Mazar, and my eldest daughter came to me with tears in her eyes and said she feared the same would happen here. </p><p>\"Their last opportunity to study is now gone. Seeing my children so helpless... [that was] the hardest for me. Only God knows what will happen to them and to me.\"</p></div>"

They also found the suspect's makeshift explosive devices, said James Deir, an agent of the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives.</p><p>Less than 10 minutes after the shooting, the gunman died in a shootout with police, officials said. </p><p>Investigators said on Monday that they had interviewed over 100 victims and witnesses as a part of the investigation and spent the whole night processing the scene of the crime. </p></div><p></p><h2>What do we know about the suspect? </h2><p></p><div><p>Though officials have not given a motive, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt told Fox News that Sanford was \"an individual who hated people of the Mormon faith\".</p><p>Officials have said the suspect was a former Marine who was once deployed to Iraq. </p><p>Sanford told local outlet Clarkston News that he was a sergeant in the Marines and was deployed to Fallujah in Iraq in 2007. </p><p>\"I'm excited to go,\" he told the newspaper. \"There are many changes we are making in the Middle East, we are making progress.\"</p><p>Sanford had previous arrests for a burglary and operating a vehicle while intoxicated, officials said on Monday. </p><p>Not much information is available about the suspect's political beliefs, but his Facebook profile features a photo of him in 2019 wearing what appears to be a shirt promoting the re-election of Donald Trump in 2020. </p><p>A Google Street View image of a property linked to Sanford also appears to show a pro-Trump sign outside of the house. </p><p>Sanford also appeared to be a father of a son who had serious health issues, according to posts from his family and a fundraising page. </p><p>Sanford is from a suburb of Flint of about 30,000 people, just a few miles away from Grand Blanc Township. </p></div></article>"
