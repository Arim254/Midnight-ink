Israel, it says, has never provided evidence of the allegations of systematic theft, despite repeated UN requests.</p></div><div><ul><li><b>Outside of the UK, you can </b><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IA8YL_Datm0\"><b>watch on YouTube</b></a></li></ul></div><div><p>Famine is why Palestinians in Gaza, many of them young men like Abdullah, are prepared to risk their lives at the GHF sites to get food.</p><p>It is nearly two years since Hamas killed 1,195 people in southern Israel and took 251 hostages. Forty-eight Israelis are still in Gaza. Perhaps 20 of them are thought to be alive. It remains Israel's biggest trauma since its independence in 1948.</p><p>Israel's response has been to inflict the biggest trauma Palestinians have suffered in the same nearly eight decades. The Israelis continue to argue they are acting in self defence in Gaza - a narrow strip of land that is now in ruins, and has seen the killing by Israel of at least 65,000 people, according to the Hamas-run health ministry, including more than 18,000 children. Israel rejects these figures but they are generally considered reliable by international organisations.</p><p>Abdullah was a bright young man. Sticky notes above his desk display reminders to himself to aim for 95% in his exams. Judging by the photos his father provides, he dressed smartly, with a sharp haircut and an expectant smile. He must have seen possibilities ahead in his life, even in Gaza, a place where life was hard even before the war. Now it is reduced to a struggle to survive Israeli attacks and the famine.</p></div><figure><div><p><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20250905-110137-f27f908f49-web-2.29.1-3/grey-placeholder.png\" /><img srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/61af/live/81db2590-9894-11f0-af62-91486a511a31.jpg.webp 240w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/61af/live/81db2590-9894-11f0-af62-91486a511a31.jpg.webp 320w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/61af/live/81db2590-9894-11f0-af62-91486a511a31.jpg.webp 480w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/61af/live/81db2590-9894-11f0-af62-91486a511a31.jpg.webp 640w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/61af/live/81db2590-9894-11f0-af62-91486a511a31.jpg.webp 800w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/61af/live/81db2590-9894-11f0-af62-91486a511a31.jpg.webp 1024w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/61af/live/81db2590-9894-11f0-af62-91486a511a31.jpg.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/61af/live/81db2590-9894-11f0-af62-91486a511a31.jpg.webp\" alt=\"Aerial image of where Abdullah was shot and killed in Gaza, showing where shots were fired from the direction of an IDF position, and also where aid seekers came under fire.

They went together to GHF site 4, the only one in the centre of Gaza, following the instructions of IDF soldiers about the correct route to take. To get ahead in the deadly race for food, many Palestinians arrive at the GHF sites long before dawn. Moaaz and Abdullah were waiting near a ruined house less than 500 metres from the site.</p><p>Then Abdullah said he had to deal with a call of nature, and moved, Moaaz says, about 30 metres away. That was when he was shot dead. Moaaz said he ran through heavy fire to get to his friend. He lived around 10 more minutes.</p><p>Diaa told us about his son, and how hard it is to live and stay alive in Gaza.</p><p>\"In Gaza we are a peaceful people. Abdullah was a young man like any other. May God have mercy on him. He didn't get the chance to fulfil any of his dreams.\"</p></div><p></p><figcaption>Abdullah's friend describes the moment the 19-year-old was shot dead</figcaption><p></p><div><p>We asked the IDF specifically about the death of Abdullah. It did not respond but told us it \"does not deliberately fire at innocent civilians\". GHF's lawyers say its security contractors do not open fire either. They say they are not aware of any credibly documented instance of their ever doing so - and that no-one has been shot dead at a GHF site, or within sight of one.</p><p>Abdullah's story comes from the film that we have just broadcast, called Gaza: Dying for Food, produced by Panorama and BBC Eye.  It is an investigation into hunger in Gaza, and the killing around the food distribution sites run by the GHF. Dying for Food looks at just one part of Gaza's humanitarian catastrophe. We have established how so many Palestinians are being killed seeking aid. It is a worthy subject for a half-hour television film. A comprehensive account from every angle would need a series.</p><p>Reporting and producing the film has been a considerable challenge. That is because Israel does not permit the BBC, or any other news organisation, to send teams into Gaza to report freely. Palestinian journalists inside Gaza have done heroic work, without which we would know much less about what has been happening there in the past two years. According to the UN Human Rights Office, at least 248 of them have been killed by Israel.</p><p>On Dying for Food I was the reporter, the public face of a big team of journalists. I wrote the script, but I did not interview Diaa or Moaaz about the killing of Abdullah. I wasn't present when the filming took place of the dead and dying in hospital emergency departments, of miles of rubble and Palestinians desperate to grab some food while the IDF and armed American security men working for GHF were said to have opened fire. I was able to talk to the interviewees who weren't in Gaza, either face to face or via video.</p><p>It is not the way the BBC, or any other group of journalists and film makers would choose to work. A fundamental rule of journalism is to narrow the distance between the reporter and the story. It was drummed into me when I was a BBC trainee journalist assigned to the Belfast newsroom during the Troubles in the winter of 1984-85. An acerbic news editor, using a tone that might get him into trouble these days, told me to leave the building to use my own eyes and ears, and to talk to people.</p></div><figure><div><p><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20250905-110137-f27f908f49-web-2.29.1-3/grey-placeholder.png\" /><img srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/b91e/live/fa1900d0-989f-11f0-af62-91486a511a31.jpg.webp 240w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/b91e/live/fa1900d0-989f-11f0-af62-91486a511a31.jpg.webp 320w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/b91e/live/fa1900d0-989f-11f0-af62-91486a511a31.jpg.webp 480w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/b91e/live/fa1900d0-989f-11f0-af62-91486a511a31.jpg.webp 640w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/b91e/live/fa1900d0-989f-11f0-af62-91486a511a31.jpg.webp 800w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/b91e/live/fa1900d0-989f-11f0-af62-91486a511a31.jpg.webp 1024w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/b91e/live/fa1900d0-989f-11f0-af62-91486a511a31.jpg.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/b91e/live/fa1900d0-989f-11f0-af62-91486a511a31.jpg.webp\" alt=\"Tawfik pictured sitting down.

The IDF allows some news teams short and heavily supervised visits. I have done one, for about three or four hours, in the first month of the war. It let me see the destruction first hand, and to talk to soldiers. </p><p>One IDF officer started by telling me that they worked hard to safeguard the lives of noncombatants. Even in the first few weeks of the war, Israel was being accused of ignoring its legal obligations to protect civilians. Then the officer trailed off, and in disgust told me that all the Palestinians were guilty, not just the Hamas units that had led the 7 October attacks. If they weren't guilty, he said, they would have found a way to overthrow Hamas.</p><p>To get round Israel's ban on our entry into Gaza, we commission local freelancers who are still able to operate on the ground. Our team had long conversations with them about where to film, who to interview and what to ask. We needed to know about the backgrounds and relevance to the story of potential interviewees and where filming would be an acceptable risk to take in a warzone where nowhere is safe.</p><p>From a distance, BBC journalists directed the teams we used in Gaza. We reviewed and verified the material we received, examining closely the data embedded in videos that shows when and where it was shot. Just communicating with people in Gaza is hard. Digital connections are patchy. It took several days for the story of Abdullah to be sent to London after it was filmed. </p><p>Connectivity out of Gaza is often weak or non-existent, as Israel has bombed mobile phone masts and internet hubs. The current Israeli offensive in Gaza made movement difficult and highly dangerous. One of the filmmakers we worked with in Gaza City went quiet for a few days while they moved their family somewhere they hoped might be safer.</p><p>We also asked for permission to film at the GHF sites but were refused.</p><p>Reporting from a distance is not the way we want to work. But given the constraints imposed by Israel, we believe we have found the best obtainable way to tell the story of how Gazans live and die.</p></div><figure><div><p><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20250905-110137-f27f908f49-web-2.29.1-3/grey-placeholder.png\" /><img srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/be06/live/b1716bb0-9863-11f0-858a-a904eacbef23.jpg.webp 240w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/be06/live/b1716bb0-9863-11f0-858a-a904eacbef23.jpg.webp 320w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/be06/live/b1716bb0-9863-11f0-858a-a904eacbef23.jpg.webp 480w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/be06/live/b1716bb0-9863-11f0-858a-a904eacbef23.jpg.webp 640w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/be06/live/b1716bb0-9863-11f0-858a-a904eacbef23.jpg.webp 800w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/be06/live/b1716bb0-9863-11f0-858a-a904eacbef23.jpg.webp 1024w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/be06/live/b1716bb0-9863-11f0-858a-a904eacbef23.jpg.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/be06/live/b1716bb0-9863-11f0-858a-a904eacbef23.jpg.webp\" alt=\"Picture of Reem, who is looking to the side of the camera.

He was also looking for food, more plentiful then but still dangerous to venture out to get it as Israel invaded and pummelled Gaza. </p><p>She was interviewed in a tent in Gaza City. We have not been able to contact her in the past week or so. We believe Reem might have taken her two children south from Gaza City to escape the ferocious offensive Israel has launched to capture the area. If so, it would be the sixth time they have been displaced. Most of Gaza's more than two million civilians have been displaced many times.</p><p>One way of getting information when physically you are not there to see it for yourself is to talk to witnesses. I interviewed an NHS doctor just back from Gaza called Tawfik Omar, who is a vascular surgeon in Coventry. Tawfik is from Egypt and spoke at length to patients and their families in Gaza. Vascular surgeons see a lot of blood. Tawfik was shocked in Gaza by an overpowering smell of blood in hospitals packed with the dead and dying who had been shot near aid sites.</p><p>\"The local people coming from the GHF points,\" he told me, \"are saying clearly that we can see the GHF security guards or the IDF personnel shooting directly at the crowds.\"</p><p>Dying for Food features two whistleblowers, who didn't want to be identified. One was a lorry driver for a GHF logistics subcontractor. We called him \"John\" and hid his identity because he is worried that his safety might be compromised if it was known that he had spoken out. He told me that another potential whistleblower had been silenced by threats from former colleagues.</p><p>There are only three GHF aid points, compared to 400 that existed when the UN was distributing aid. John told us they felt like military bases on the front line, not places where humanitarian aid was given to those who need it. He told us that every night he did his work, it was with the background of heavy gunfire. John was so shocked by what he saw that he secretly recorded videos with his mobile.</p></div><p></p><figcaption>Watch: Whistleblower's secret recordings of gunfire near GHF aid sites</figcaption><p></p><div><p>His videos were part of the material we used to establish a pattern of the IDF's use of live fire to control crowds, an intrinsically lethal technique. On a day when more than 20 people were killed near the single GHF aid site in central Gaza, we were able to use John's video taken that night to help establish what was happening.</p><p>It shows heavy fire coming from an IDF position just behind site four. The bullets were hitting an area where we established that hungry people, in their thousands, would often gather near a bridge over a dried-up river bed that leads to the entrance of the site.</p><p>Even though we were not physically in Gaza, our team analysed John's videos (and many others) using open-source intelligence, a way to check events and corroborate testimony by using the latest techniques and software to sort through the wealth of data and video that is available online. We spoke to five ballistics experts, and used software that analyses the sound of shooting on videos, to help establish the trajectory of bullets.</p><p>We used satellite pictures, which are no longer the sole preserve of intelligence agencies, and matched the detail they showed with the videos. Satellite pictures are available commercially and are especially valuable in the Gaza Strip, which straddles a 40-km (25-mile) stretch of the eastern Mediterranean coast where clouds are rare.</p><p>Videos shot on mobiles carry metadata, which includes the digital record of the time, date and place where they were shot. We know the dates of our whistleblower's videos, but we have not revealed them to help John stay anonymous.</p><p>The data on the number of deaths at GHF sites comes from a body called Armed Conflict Location and Event Data (ACLED). It collects and analyses data from warzones and is funded, among others, by the United Nations, the European Union, the US and European countries including the UK.</p><p>ACLED's data shows that since the GHF began its operations, at least 1,300 Palestinians have been killed at, or around, its sites, mostly by IDF fire. Across Gaza, Palestinians were being killed seeking aid in the year before GHF arrived at an average rate of 30 per month. Since its sites opened, that has risen to 500.</p><p>The IDF denies the killing. It told us that it is \"not aware of hundreds of fatalities caused by… [its] …forces at distribution points.\" It says these figures are \"inflated and false\".</p></div><figure><div><p><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20250905-110137-f27f908f49-web-2.29.1-3/grey-placeholder.png\" /><img srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/1ad8/live/02913500-98a2-11f0-af62-91486a511a31.jpg.webp 240w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/1ad8/live/02913500-98a2-11f0-af62-91486a511a31.jpg.webp 320w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/1ad8/live/02913500-98a2-11f0-af62-91486a511a31.jpg.webp 480w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/1ad8/live/02913500-98a2-11f0-af62-91486a511a31.jpg.webp 640w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/1ad8/live/02913500-98a2-11f0-af62-91486a511a31.jpg.webp 800w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/1ad8/live/02913500-98a2-11f0-af62-91486a511a31.jpg.webp 1024w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/1ad8/live/02913500-98a2-11f0-af62-91486a511a31.jpg.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/1ad8/live/02913500-98a2-11f0-af62-91486a511a31.jpg.webp\" alt=\"Reuters Picture showing people carrying aid away from a GHF food distribution site in Gaza.

Peace is not even a distant dream. The war that started with the attacks led by Hamas on 7 October 2023 is as significant a moment in the history of the conflict as the ones in 1948, when Israel fought and won its independence, and 1967, when it captured and occupied the West Bank, including East Jerusalem and the Gaza Strip, giving it full control of the land.</p><p>The Gaza war has stripped the conflict to its essentials. European allies that gave Israel strong support after 7 October 2023, have decided that the only way to try to offer a better way ahead than perpetual war is to recognise an independent Palestine, which the UK, France and others have done this week at the UN General Assembly in New York.</p><p>Israel and its supporters, led by the US, have condemned the move as a reward for Hamas terrorism. The counter argument to that is that the best way of ending armed attacks on Israelis is to create the conditions for Palestinian independence and allow Palestinians to set up a state in Gaza, the West Bank, including a capital in East Jerusalem. The occupation of Palestinian land is illegal under international law according to the International Court of Justice.</p><p>The determined opposition of Israel, backed by the US, makes the vision of a Palestinian state remote. So does the presence of more than 700,000 Jewish settlers in the West Bank, including East Jerusalem, on land the UK and others now call the state of Palestine. But Britain's Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer and France's President Emmanuel Macron argue they have to act now to try to keep alive the hope of peace through the two-state solution. If Israel does not accept Palestinian independence, it will find itself even more isolated for ruling over millions of people and denying them political rights.</p><p>The current offensive is aimed at forcing up to one million people out of Gaza City. It suits the plan pushed by Benjamin Netanyahu's hardline allies to seize the Gaza Strip for Jewish settlers - and force Palestinians out.  One extremist leader in the Israeli cabinet predicted a real estate bonanza.</p><p>There is strong evidence of war crimes on both sides.  Hamas committed war crimes when it broke through Israel's border defences two years ago, and in the months that followed when it still had the capacity to fire barrages of missiles at Israeli towns. Holding hostages in appalling conditions and threatening their lives is also a crime.</p><p>Israel faces accusations of a genocidal attack on Gaza's Palestinians, not just with bullets and high explosive, but by using food as a weapon of war. The IPC, the world body that assesses food emergencies, says famine caused by the Israeli blockade of Gaza is present and spreading. If it is proved that Israel is committing acts with the intent to destroy Gaza's Palestinians as a group, in whole or in part, then genocide will be added to the list of war crimes that the whistleblower John - and many others - say that they have witnessed.</p><p>Israel says it has the most moral army in the world, has not committed war crimes, and is fighting a just war in the defence of its citizens. Benjamin Netanyahu insists the current offensive aimed at capturing Gaza City will deliver the elusive total victory over Hamas that he has promised repeatedly. He also insists it will rescue the Israeli hostages still in Gaza.</p><p>The UK says the IDF assault on Gaza is utterly reckless and appalling. The Foreign Secretary, Yvette Cooper, posted: \"It will only bring more bloodshed, kill more innocent civilians and endanger the remaining hostages. We need an immediate ceasefire, all hostages released, unrestricted humanitarian aid and a path to lasting peace.\"</p><p>When, in August, the IPC published its report saying that famine had spread to Gaza City, Israel was planning one of the biggest offensives of the war to capture the city and force about a million civilians to flee south.</p><p>Israel was open about its plans, which prompted a warning about the prospects for September from the IPC. It said that intensified military action, and the forced relocation of already fragile civilian populations would make the famine in Gaza \"significantly more severe\".</p><p>That is now the risk.</p></div></article>"

Dear families. Dear Greenland. Today there is only one right thing to say to you. Sorry,\" Frederiksen told a packed venue in the centre of the capital Nuuk.</p><p>During an emotionally charged event, one women stood with her back to the prime minster in protest, a black handprint painted across her mouth.</p><p>\"Sorry for the injustice that was committed against you,\" Frederiksen said. \"Because you were Greenlanders. Sorry for what was taken from you. And for the pain it caused,\" she continued. \"On behalf of Denmark. Sorry.\"</p><p>Naja Lyberth, who was one of the first of the Inuit Greenlanders to speak out about what happened, received a standing ovation as she addressed Wednesday's event.</p><p>\"If we are to move forward, the apology is crucial,\" she said.</p></div><div><p>An official inquiry earlier this month concluded that at least 4,000 women had a coil implanted by 1970, corresponding to roughly half the Greenlandic females of childbearing age.</p><p>In more than 300 cases examined by the inquiry, women and girls as young as 12 had been fitted with an IUD without their knowledge or consent.</p><p>Welcoming Frederiksen's apology and the investigation, Naja Lyberth was also critical that it had not explored possible human rights violations.</p><p>Frederiksen acknowledged that many women had lived with trauma and physical complications, and that some were not able to have children.</p><p>Among the women named by the prime minister in her speech was Elisa Christensen, who listened to the leader's words carefully and found her apology \"very overwhelming\".</p><p>Although she said she was still taking it in, she told the BBC: \"There was no mention of compensation at all we are sad about that. It was almost like empty words.\"</p><p>Ahead of Wednesday's apology, Mette Frederiksen issued a statement outlining plans to establish a \"reconciliation fund\", but it is not yet clear how many women this would be offered to, or when this would happen.</p><p>It also suggested there would be payouts to other Greenlanders who had been \"subjected to failure and systematic discrimination\", but gave no further details.</p><p>A lawsuit demanding compensation has been filed by a group of 143 women.</p><p>Among them is Aviaq Petersen who was 24 when, during a routine medical appointment, a gynaecologist told her she had an IUD.</p><p>Now 59, Petersen believes the device was inserted without her knowledge, during an abortion 10 years earlier.</p><p>Doctors later found scarring on her fallopian tubes, and despite operations she has not been able to have children.</p><p>She has been sceptical about the timing of the Danish apology, but hopes to see a formal reconciliation process get under way.</p><p>\"You were not asked. You had no opportunity to speak out. You were not heard. You were not seen,\" said Greenland's Prime Minister Jens-Frederik Nielsen, adding it was one of the darkest chapters in the country's history.</p><p>Greenland was a Danish colony until 1953, and then became a county of Denmark, before gaining home rule in 1979. However Copenhagen oversaw the healthcare system until 1992, when Greenland took over responsibility.</p></div><div><p>Frederiksen's apology comes amid increased scrutiny of Denmark's relationship with Greenland, and growing international pressure, particularly following President Donald Trump's repeated demands to take control of the Arctic territory.</p><p>The IUD case is one of several historic and current controversies including forced adoptions that have damaged Danish-Greenlandic relations.</p><p>Most recently another flashpoint has involved the removal of Inuit children from their families following \"parenting competence\" tests.</p><p>This week, a decision by Danish authorities to separate a young Greenlandic mother from her newborn daughter - one hour after she gave birth - was reversed after the case prompted outrage.</p><p>For Elisa Christensen, Denmark's official apology has brought a rollercoaster of emotions. \"The little girl inside me, for the first time she felt she got a little hug from society.</p><p>\"But for the grown up Elisa, I don't know [how] I use that apology. Where are the children and grandchildren I should I have?\"</p></div>"

Israeli armoured vehicles were also reportedly seen close to the main UN compound in southern Gaza City, about 700m (2297ft) from the centre.</p></div><div><p>The BBC has spoken to a Hamas figure who claims the militant group is willing to call thousands of fighters into the city, raising the fear of intense fighting in dense urban areas where thousands of civilians remain.</p><p>He said that Izz al-Din al-Haddad, the group's military commander, has ordered all available fighters across the Strip to converge on the city, telling them to prepare for a \"final, decisive battle\".</p></div><div><p>The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) estimated last week that up to 3,000 Hamas fighters were in the city. The Hamas figure claimed they had 5,000 fighters and threatened suicide attacks, though that has not been a tactic Hamas has used widely in this recent conflict. The BBC cannot independently verify these figures and Hamas has not officially commented.</p><p>International journalists have been banned by Israel from entering the Gaza Strip independently since the start of the war nearly two years ago, making verifying claims from both sides difficult. Some journalists have been taken into Gaza by the IDF under controlled access.</p><p>Israel has been trying to destroy the tunnels in Gaza to stop the militants using them for surprise attacks. But the Hamas militant claimed that some remained intact and that the group had learned from Israel's successes in destroying militant units that have attempted to hold ground in a fight.</p><p>Before he was killed by Israel, the group's previous military chief, Mohammed Deif, issued orders that the militant group should adopt a move towards guerrilla tactics and ambushes to mitigate their catastrophic losses.</p><p>According to residents in Gaza City, Israel has reacted to this by conducting rapid thrusts into urban areas, before pulling back within hours.</p><p>The Israeli media has also reported that the IDF has used damaged armoured vehicles, packed with explosives, and fitted with remote control capabilities, to attack Hamas positions or destroy buildings being used to hide fighters.</p><p>Small quadcopter drones equipped with loudspeakers have also been deployed by Israel to warn civilians to leave, spreading panic in several districts.</p><p>Thousands of Palestinian families have continued to flee south along the coastal al-Rashid road, the only route currently permitted by the Israeli military. The UN estimated on Tuesday that at least 321,000 people have fled south since mid-August. The IDF puts the total figure at 640,000.</p><p>The journey has become prohibitively expensive, with families paying more than $3,000 (£2,450) for transport, far beyond the means of most Gaza residents. Many have been forced to abandon belongings they could not carry on foot.</p><p>Those remaining in Gaza City - thought to be hundreds of thousands - face the constant threat of bombardment, collapsing hospitals and dwindling food and water. A <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c05ed5rgld3o\">UN-backed agency confirmed a famine</a> in the area in late August.</p><p>The Israeli military launched a campaign in Gaza in response to the Hamas-led attack on southern Israel on 7 October 2023, in which about 1,200 people were killed and 251 others were taken hostage.</p><p>At least 65,419 people have been killed in Israeli attacks in Gaza since then, according to the territory's Hamas-run health ministry.</p></div>"

But our greatest joy will come when there are no [political] prisoners in Egypt,\" she added.</p><p>In an interview with the BBC Radio 4's Today programme on Tuesday morning, his sister Mona said she was \"impatiently waiting for the time to come and preparing to go to the airport to take the plane and go see Alaa\".</p><p>\"It has been the longest 12 years of this madness, and nightmare and heartache, and also journey full of love and ups and downs. And now Alaa is out, Alaa is free, Alaa is home.\"</p></div><div><p>Her brother first rose to prominence during the 2011 uprising in Egypt that forced long-time President Hosni Mubarak to resign.</p><p>He has spent most of his time in prison since 2014, the year after Sisi led the military's overthrow of Egypt's first democratically elected president, Muslim Brotherhood leader Mohammed Morsi, following anti-government protests.</p><p>While in power, Sisi has overseen what human rights groups say is an unprecedented crackdown on dissent that has led to the detention of tens of thousands of people.</p><p>In 2015, a court sentenced Abdel Fattah to five years in prison for participating in an unauthorised protest.</p><p>In September 2019, only six months after he had been released on probation, he was arrested again and held in pre-trial detention for more than two years.</p><p>He was convicted in December 2021 of \"spreading false news\" for sharing a post about a prisoner dying of torture and handed another five-year sentence following a trial that human rights groups said was grossly unfair.</p><p>Although Abdel Fattah acquired British citizenship in 2021, Egypt never allowed him a consular visit by British diplomats.</p><p>In May, the UN Working Group on Arbitrary Detention - a panel of independent human rights experts – found that Abdel Fattah had been arbitrarily arrested for exercising his right to freedom of expression, had not been given a fair trial and had remained in detention for his political opinions.</p><p>The Egyptian government said he had been afforded \"all fair trial rights\" and that his sentence would be completed in January 2027.</p><p>But two weeks ago, Sisi unexpectedly ordered authorities to study a petition from Egypt's National Council for Human Rights (NCHR) for the release of Abdel Fattah and six others, which the institution said it had submitted \"in light of the humanitarian and health conditions experienced by [their] families\".</p><p>It gave no details but Leila Soueif was twice admitted to hospital in London during her extensive hunger strike, which she ended in July after receiving assurances from the UK government that it was doing everything it could to secure her son's release.</p><p>Mona Seif praised the \"enormous solidarity\" with her family's campaign across the world, as well as the pressure applied by the UK government and British MPs. But she said she believed it was her mother's \"terrible and terrifying, but also incredible\" hunger strike that ultimately led to the presidential pardon.</p><p>She said she did not yet know whether her brother would be allowed to leave Egypt to be reunited with his 13-year-old son, Khaled, who lives in Brighton.</p><p>\"[Alaa] missed all his childhood. He needs to be with Khaled as a teenager, to take Khaled to school, to take Khaled to the beach, to do all the things they have been robbed of the opportunity to do.\"</p><p>She also said her brother's release was \"not just about a personal moment\".</p><p>\"I'm hoping it can be a moment of collective hope,\" she explained. \"There might be a revision to the state of the thousands and thousands of people who are languishing in prison for years and are waiting for the same kind of happiness, to be reunited with their family,\" she added.</p><p>The NCHR said the pardon was \"a step that underscores a growing commitment to reinforcing the principles of swift justice and upholding fundamental rights and freedoms\", while Egyptian human rights lawyer Ahmed Ragheb said he hoped it would \"pave the way for granting amnesty to those who have been sentenced in cases related to freedom of expression\".</p></div>"

    "body": "<div><p>A new HIV prevention drug will be made available at a lower cost in over 100 low-income countries within two years — a move expected to give millions access to the breakthrough treatment and potentially bring the world closer to ending the HIV/Aids epidemic.</p><p>The drug, called Lenacapavir and administered by injection, is due to be rolled out as early as the end of this year, at a cost of $28,000 (£20,000) per person annually.</p><p>But Wednesday's announcement promises to slash that price to just $40 — around 0.1% of the original cost. The lower-cost version will be rolled out in 2027 across 120 low- and middle-income countries.</p><p>Scientists say the drug stops the virus from replicating inside cells. </p></div><div><p>The agreement announced on Wednesday was reached between the Clinton Health Access Initiative in partnership with the Gates Foundation and other groups, including South African research institute, Wits RHI.</p><p>\"For many low- and middle-income countries, affordable access to HIV prevention is not a luxury, it is a necessity,\" Professor Saiqa Mullick from Wits RHI told the BBC.</p><p>She added that Lenacapavir had \"the potential to transform prevention, especially for young people and underserved communities who struggle with frequent clinic visits. </p><p>\"The real work begins now, partnering with communities and governments to build demand, secure commitments, and prepare systems so countries are ready for rapid introduction and scale.\"</p><ul><li><b>WATCH</b>:<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.bbc.com/audio/play/w3ct6vjk\"> HIV prevention drug Lenacapavir recommended by WHO</a></li><li><b>PODCAST</b>: <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.bbc.com/audio/play/p0jcz7zn\">Lenacapavir: could new HIV drug help end the pandemic?</a></li></ul><p>Lenacapavir has delivered impressive trial results and, in July, it received official backing from the World Health Organization for HIV prevention.</p><p>The injection is taken twice a year and provides six months of protection against HIV infection at a time. </p><p>Experts say long-acting injectables like Lenacapavir could help reduce new infections in populations that are most vulnerable, including adolescent girls and young women, LGBT people, sex workers, and those who use drugs.</p><p>It is hoped it will replace the current form of HIV preventative drug, know as PrEP, or pre-exposure prophylaxis, which is taken orally and also costs $40 per person each year. </p><p>The pills are taken daily, which can be difficult for patients to consume, and can carry stigma in certain societies. The daily dose also makes it harder to access consistently. According to the Gates Foundation, only 18% of those who could benefit from PrEP currently have access.</p><p>Lenacapavir has already been approved by the US Food and Drug Administration and the European Commission this year. </p><p>Last year June, the US drug company Gilead announced that a trial of its HIV drug Lenacapavir had a 100% success rate.</p><p>The new, generic version is still pending regulatory approval but it is hoped it will be available within 18 months. </p><p>One study says that increasing access to the injection to just 4% of the population could prevent up to 20% of new HIV infections.</p><p>The drug can be used to protect people from catching the virus, but also to treat those who have it, according to scientists. </p><p>The announcement comes amid a turbulent year for global health, particularly the fight against HIV and Aids, following swingeing cuts by the US government's foreign aid programme, USAID, under the Trump administration.</p><p>According to UNAIDS, more than 40 million people are currently living with HIV. </p><p>Despite huge strides made to reduce global HIV rates and AIDS-related deaths since 2000, about 1.3 million people still contracted HIV last year, and more than 600,000 people died from AIDS-related illnesses.</p><p>South Africa remains the country with the highest number of HIV cases, with almost eight million people living with the virus. It will be one of the countries to access the new, cheaper drug.</p><p>South Africa's department of health told the BBC that it \"supports any efforts to make life saving treatment like Lenacapavir available and accessible at affordable rate to all countries, including low and middle income countries, as and when they need it\".</p><p><i>Additional reporting by Akisa Wandera in Nairobi</i></p></div>"
