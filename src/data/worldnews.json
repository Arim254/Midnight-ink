At least five students were killed and about 100 injured, officials said. </p><p>Thirteen people have been freed from the debris since rescue efforts began, though two later died in hospital.

I feel sad thinking of him being down there for four days.\"</p><p>Ahmad Ikhsan, 52, told Reuters: \"I believe my son is still alive.\"</p><p>The BNBP said on Wednesday that 59 people were still trapped in the rubble, though this figure has fluctuated greatly over the past few days, with Suharyanto earlier saying that data would always be \"conflicting\" in the \"early stages\" of a disaster. </p><p>The building was under construction when it collapsed, with two extra floors being added. The BNBP later said that the building's unstable foundation meant it could not support this weight. </p><p>Sidoarjo town's regent says the school's management had not obtained permits to add more floors to the building.</p></div>"

    "body": "<div><div><p>19 hours ago</p></div><p><span><p><span>Jeremy Bowen</span><span>International Editor</span></p></span></p></div><div><p>Donald Trump's framework agreement for ending the Gaza war and reconstructing the devastated territory has momentum behind it. </p><p>Much of it comes from the president himself. Momentum comes too from leading Arab and Islamic countries who have supported the plan, including Jordan, Egypt, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, the UAE, Pakistan, Indonesia and Turkey. And Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, standing next to Donald Trump, accepted it too, despite the fact it contains talk of a pathway to a Palestinian state that he has repeatedly denounced.</p><p>To keep the pace up, Trump says that Hamas has \"three to four days\" to decide whether to say yes or no.</p><p>If the answer is no, the war goes on.</p><p>The proposed deal looks a lot like a plan put forward by Joe Biden well over a year ago. Since then there has been massive killing of Palestinian civilians, more destruction in Gaza, and now a famine, while Israeli hostages in Gaza have had to endure months more of agony and captivity.</p><p>There were many reports in the Israeli media that the Biden initiative failed because Netanyahu moved the goalposts with a new set of demands - under pressure from the hard right in his cabinet.</p><p>Even so, the framework plan is a significant moment. For the first time, Donald Trump is putting pressure on Israel to end the war. Donald Trump has made himself into a leader to whom it is hard to say no. Nobody wants to end up getting the roasting Ukraine's president Volodymyr Zelensky received in the Oval Office back in February. But things can change when leaders leave the White House.</p><p>Before Benjamin Netanyahu left Washington DC to go back to Israel his staff filmed him putting over his version of events. One element was the idea of an independent Palestine next to Israel, the two-state solution which the UK and other Western countries have tried to revive by recognising Palestine.</p><p>The Trump document gives an indeterminate nod to the idea of Palestinian independence. It says that after the reform of the Palestinian Authority, which is based in Ramallah and led by President Mahmoud Abbas, conditions \"may finally be in place for a credible pathway to Palestinian self-determination and statehood, which we recognise as the aspiration of the Palestinian people.\"</p><p>Even the thought of a distant prospect of a Palestinian state was too much for Netanyahu, who had given whole-hearted support to Trump at the White House, telling him in English \"I support your plan to end the war in Gaza, which achieves our war aims.\"</p><p>On the video, getting his message out in Hebrew to the people back home before the long flight home, Netanyahu is asked if he agreed to a Palestinian state. He was emphatic.</p><p>\"No, absolutely not. It's not even written in the agreement. But we did say one thing. That we would forcibly resist a Palestinian state.\" Trump, he said, agreed.</p></div><div><p>Momentum is the plan's strength. Its weakness is the lack of detail, a characteristic of Trumpian diplomacy. The document that Trump and Netanyahu endorsed, which also has the support of the UK and other European countries, comes with a rough map of stages of an IDF pull-back, but none of the nuts and bolts that determine whether diplomatic agreements designed to end a war hold together or disintegrate.</p><p>If it is to work, hard negotiation will be necessary. In that process there will be many opportunities for it to break down.</p><p>Mainstream opposition parties in Israel have endorsed the plan. It has been condemned by the extremist ultra-nationalists in the Netanyahu coalition, who had loved the \"Trump Riviera\" plan mooted at the start of the year, launched with a bizarre video showing the leaders of Israel and the US in beach gear sipping cocktails to the backdrop of a new Gazan cityscape glittering glass towers. The Israeli hard right were delighted that the Riviera plan included the removal of all of Gaza's more than two million Palestinians. Jewish extremists want the land annexed and Palestinians replaced with Jewish settlers.</p><p>But the new plan says no Palestinian will be forced to leave. Benjamin Netanyahu's key far right ally, Itamar Ben Gvir, is said to have called the proposal \"dangerous\" and \"full of holes\".</p><p>If Hamas accepts the agreement, and if Benjamin Netanyahu wants to find ways to placate the extremists who keep his coalition in power, he will have plenty of chances to sabotage the negotiations in ways that put the blame on Hamas. The structure of the Trump framework agreement allows Israel a range of opportunities to veto moves it does not like.</p><p>It may not be possible to end a deep-seated conflict that has lasted more than a century. Longer term, the UK and many countries outside Israel and the US believe that any attempted solution that does not lead to Palestinian independence will not bring peace.</p><p>When the foreign ministers of the Arab and Islamic countries issued their statement of support, they said that they believed it would lead to a full Israeli withdrawal and rebuilding of Gaza, and \"a path for just peace on basis of two-state solution under which Gaza is fully integrated with the West Bank in Palestinian state in accordance with international law.\" That could be taken as a coded reference to the decision of the International Court of Justice that the occupation of Palestinian land by Israel is illegal.</p><p>Netanyahu believes the deal takes him closer to Israel's elusive victory over Hamas. He denies any Palestinian right to the land between the river Jordan and the sea.</p><p>One plan, two very different versions of what it means. The framework is ambiguous enough for both interpretations to be possible. That is not a promising start.</p></div><p><i>Correction 1 October: This article originally said that Israel's finance minister Bezalel Smotrich had compared the peace plan to the 1938 Munich agreement. In fact Smotrich had compared Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu's phone call to the Qatari Prime Minister, apologising for an Israeli missile strike on Doha, to the Munich agreement, and so we have removed this line from the story.</i></p>"

The sale of another 10 products have been paused, and two more are being reviewed. One product named by the TGA is made in Australia but is not sold in the country.</p><p>Australia has the highest rate of skin cancers in the world - it is estimated that two out of three Australians will have at least one cut out in their lifetime - and it has some of the strictest sunscreen regulations globally.</p><p><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c4gzl41rpdqo\">The scandal has caused a massive backlash from customers in the nation</a>, but experts have warned it may also have global implications. Problems have been identified with both the manufacture of some sunscreens and the integrity of lab testing relied upon to prove their SPF claims.</p><p>The manufacturer of the base formula in question, Wild Child Laboratories Pty Ltd, has stopped making it as a result, the TGA said.</p><p>In a statement, Wild Child Laboratories boss Tom Curnow said the TGA had found no manufacturing issues at its facility.</p><p>\"The discrepancies reported in recent testing are part of a broader, industry-wide issue,\" he said.</p><p>The TGA has previously said it is looking into \"reviewing existing SPF testing requirements\" which can be \"highly subjective\", but in the update on Tuesday said it had significant concerns about testing undertaken by Princeton Consumer Research Corp (PCR Corp), a US lab.</p><p>\"The TGA is aware that many companies responsible for sunscreens manufactured using this base formulation relied on testing by PCR Corp to support their SPF claims.\"</p><p>Mr Curnow said Wild Child had ceased working with PCR laboratories and had submitted its formulas for testing with other accredited, independent laboratories.</p><p>All companies using the problematic base formula and the PCR lab have also been contacted by the TGA, it said.</p><p>\"The TGA has also written to PCR Corp regarding its concerns and has not received a response.\"</p><p>In an emailed statement to the BBC, PCR Corp suggested that external factors could account for SPF rating discrepancies between their tests and those later conducted by others.</p><p>\"Sunscreen performance measured in a laboratory reflects the exact batch and condition of the sample submitted at that moment,\" the statement said. </p><p>\"Multiple factors outside the laboratory - such as manufacturing variability between batches, raw-material differences, packaging, storage conditions, product age, and in-market handling - can influence the SPF of products sold later.\"</p><p>The statement went on to explain that \"testing is therefore one part of a broader quality and regulatory process that includes manufacturing controls, stability programmes, and post-market surveillance by brands and regulators\".</p><p>\"We can only speak to the data we generated on the samples we tested; we cannot opine on any subsequently manufactured or sold product that we did not test.\"</p></div>"

    "body": "<div><div><p>2 days ago</p></div><p><span><p><span>Lucy Williamson</span><span>Middle East Correspondent, Jerusalem</span></p></span></p></div><div><p>He promised total victory for Israel, but standing next to Donald Trump at the White House on Monday, it was Benjamin Netanyahu who looked defeated.</p><p>Israel's prime minister was saying all the right things about the peace deal he had just agreed to, but he seemed deflated, his voice hoarse and his energy dimmed, as he praised Trump as \"the greatest friend Israel has ever had in the White House\".</p><p>It is a friendship that could cost him his government.</p><p>Netanyahu's far-right allies have threatened to leave – and possibly collapse – his government if he makes too many concessions in ending the war. Coalition partners like Bezalel Smotrich and Itamar Ben-Gvir have made little secret of their desire to annex Gaza, drive out Palestinians and re-establish Jewish settlements there. </p><p>They – and Netanyahu – have been implacably opposed to any role for the Palestinian Authority in Gaza, and any pathway to a Palestinian State. The deal Netanyahu has now agreed to outlines both, though with heavy caveats.</p><p>Trump knows that by pushing the Israeli prime minister into this deal, he is asking him to risk his government. In return, he is dangling the prospect of a historic legacy – a new, more peaceful future for the region, and new ties between Israel and its Arab neighbours.</p></div><div><p>There were signs, even before Netanyahu left for Washington, that he knew this choice was coming.</p><p>Israel's president, Isaac Herzog, told an Israeli radio station that he was considering pardoning Netanyahu in the corruption cases he is currently facing in court. These trials are one reason, his critics allege, that he is reluctant to leave office and face the judges without the shield of his national duties, power and profile.</p><p>But the political exit being offered to him in this moment – a regional legacy in return for giving up his government, and possibly his political career – does not seem to have entirely won him over.</p><p>His first response to his countrymen today has been to publicly emphasise that he did not, in fact, agree to a Palestinian state.</p><p>\"Absolutely not. It's not even written in the agreement,\" he said in response to a question on camera. \"But we did say one thing – that we would forcibly resist a Palestinian state.\"</p><p>Reports in the Israeli media this morning also suggest that Israel's cabinet will not get to vote on the full terms of the deal – but only on the exchange of Israeli hostages for Palestinian prisoners.</p><p>The question is what these actions signify about his political calculation: whether Netanyahu is trying to hold his government together long enough to work his political magic on the polls, which currently predict he would lose an election, or whether he is banking on Hamas rejecting this deal – or being unable to control its commanders on the ground in Gaza – and that the war will not stop at all.</p><p>The potential continuation of the war was something he emphasised in that uncomfortable press conference in Washington, underlining – with Trump's backing – that Israel would have free rein to \"finish the job\" if Hamas failed to deliver on its side of the deal. Seen in that light, this uncomfortable moment could be the price of continuing American support for his war.</p><p>Netanyahu is known as a master of political manoeuvres, threading a path between political roadblocks to buy time. He has shifted position through previous rounds of negotiations, and has ridden through previous ceasefire deals, only to back out when a permanent end to the war is up for discussion.</p><p>Many believe he has never wanted to negotiate an end to this war, but to force Hamas into a surrender on Israel's terms. But it is hard to maintain that uncompromising image of \"total victory\" when you have publicly conceded to the very things you have spent a career preventing, and when you are waiting for your enemy's response.</p><p>For the first time since the war began, it seems that the consequences of avoiding this deal were worse than the consequences of agreeing to it. And if Trump really did force him to choose between his ally in Washington and his allies at home, why didn't Joe Biden do the same when a similar deal was on the table nine months ago – and at least 20,000 more Gazans were still alive?</p></div>"

They have said efforts to negotiate with Republicans over these benefits have so far been unsuccessful.</p><p>“Why are they boycotting negotiations? I've never witnessed this in my life,\" Senator Chris Murphy, a Democrat from Connecticut, said of Republicans. “The matter is the government will open when Republicans get serious about it talking to Democrats.”</p></div><p></p><figcaption>Watch: Closed parks and empty buildings as US government shuts down</figcaption><p></p><div><p>Meanwhile, Republicans - who control both chambers of Congress but do not have the 60 votes needed to pass a funding bill - have said these healthcare benefits are not the priority, keeping the government open is. </p><p>\"It's not about who wins or who loses or who gets blamed and all this,” Senate Majority Leader John Thune said. “It's about the American people. And [Democrats] have taken the American people hostage in a way that they think benefits them politically.\"</p><p>Republicans have also argued the healthcare extensions Democrats are looking for will cost American taxpayers more money and were instituted to manage Covid-era complexities that no longer exist.</p><p>Essential workers such as border agents and the military may be forced to work without pay for the time being - but government employees deemed non-essential are temporarily put on unpaid leave. In the past, these workers have then been paid retrospectively.</p><p>Analysts expect this shutdown to be bigger than the last one in 2018, when Congress had passed some funding bills.

But the Trump administration has also threatened permanent layoffs of federal workers as well.</p><p>\"Let's be honest, if this thing drags on,\" Vance said during the briefing on Wednesday, \"we are going to have to lay people off.\"</p><p>Vance also made the claim - repeatedly denied by Democrats - that the shutdown is a result of senior Democrats advocating for healthcare benefits to be extended to undocumented migrants.</p><p>US law already prohibits undocumented migrants from gaining any federally subsidised healthcare coverage. \"Nowhere have Democrats suggested that we're interested in changing federal law,\" House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries said.</p><p>Russell Vought, the White House's budget chief, briefed Republicans behind closed doors on what the impending layoffs could look like, although public details of those plans are sparse. </p><p>On Capitol Hill, there was little appetite for a deal to end the standoff on Wednesday. </p><p>\"There's nothing to negotiate. There's nothing we can pull out of this bill to make it any leaner or cleaner than it is,\" Republican Speaker of the House Mike Johnson said.</p><p>Another vote on the short-term funding bill proposed by Republicans is expected on Friday.</p><p><i>With additional reporting from Bernd Debusmann Jr at the White House</i></p></div><figure><div><p><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20250919-090805-05e5ba0164-web-2.30.1-2/grey-placeholder.png\" /><img srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/e941/live/881a7470-9f5f-11f0-92db-77261a15b9d2.png.webp 240w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/e941/live/881a7470-9f5f-11f0-92db-77261a15b9d2.png.webp 320w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/e941/live/881a7470-9f5f-11f0-92db-77261a15b9d2.png.webp 480w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/e941/live/881a7470-9f5f-11f0-92db-77261a15b9d2.png.webp 640w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/e941/live/881a7470-9f5f-11f0-92db-77261a15b9d2.png.webp 800w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/e941/live/881a7470-9f5f-11f0-92db-77261a15b9d2.png.webp 1024w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/e941/live/881a7470-9f5f-11f0-92db-77261a15b9d2.png.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/e941/live/881a7470-9f5f-11f0-92db-77261a15b9d2.png.webp\" alt=\"A thin, grey banner promoting the US Politics Unspun newsletter.
