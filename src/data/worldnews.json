The court found Gueant guilty of corruption, among other charges, and Hortefeux was found guilty of criminal conspiracy.</p><p>Sarkozy's wife, Italian-born former supermodel and singer Carla Bruni-Sarkozy, was <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cd1xv3xewdno\">charged last year with hiding evidence linked to the Gaddafi case</a> and associating with wrongdoers to commit fraud, both of which she denies.</p><p>Since losing his re-election bid in 2012, Sarkozy has been targeted by several criminal investigations.</p><p>He also appealed against a February 2024 ruling which found him <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-68293760\">guilty of overspending on his 2012 re-election campaign</a>, then hiring a PR firm to cover it up. He was handed a one-year sentence, of which six months were suspended.</p><p>In 2021, he was found guilty of trying to bribe a judge in 2014 and became the first former French president to get a custodial sentence. In December, the Paris appeals court ruled that he could serve his time at home wearing a tag instead of going to jail.</p></div>"

It would seek a UN mandate to be Gaza's \"supreme political and legal authority\" for five years.</p><p>The plan would be modelled on the international administrations that oversaw East Timor and Kosovo's transitions to statehood. It would initially be based in Egypt, near Gaza's southern border, before entering Gaza once the Strip is stable, alongside a multinational force. </p><p>As PM, Blair took the decision to commit British forces to the 2003 Iraq War that was heavily criticised in the official inquiry into the conflict, which found he had acted on flawed intelligence without certainty about the production of weapons of mass destruction there.</p><p>After leaving office in 2007, Blair served as Middle East envoy for the Quartet of international powers (the US, EU, Russia and the UN). He focused on bringing economic development to Palestine and creating the conditions for a two state-solution.</p><p>Reports of discussions about his involvement in a transitional authority for Gaza come after Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas said on Thursday that he was ready to work with Trump and other world leaders to implement a two-state peace plan.</p><p>Abbas stressed his rejection of a future governing role for Hamas in Gaza and demanded it disarm.</p><p>Throughout the conflict, varying proposals for the future of Gaza have been tabled by multiple parties. </p><p>In February, Donald Trump floated plans - which since appear to have been dropped - for the US to take \"a long-term ownership position\" over Gaza, saying it could be the \"Riviera of the Middle East\". </p><p>The idea would have involved the forced displacement of Palestinians in the territory and be in violation of international law. The US and Israel said it would involve \"voluntary\" emigration.</p><p>In March, the US and Israel rejected an Arab plan for the post-war reconstruction of the Gaza Strip that would allow the 2.1 million Palestinians living there to stay in place. The Palestinian Authority and Hamas welcomed the Arab plan, which called for Gaza to be governed temporarily by a committee of independent experts and for international peacekeepers to be deployed there.</p><p>In July, a French and Saudi-led international conference in New York proposed a  \"transitional administrative committee\" for Gaza which would operate \"under the umbrella of the Palestinian Authority\". Neither the US nor Israel attended. The so-called New York Declaration was backed by a majority of the UN General Assembly in a resolution earlier this month.</p><p>Earlier this week, the UK formally recognised the State of Palestine, alongside France, Canada, Australia, and several other countries.<b> </b></p><p>The UK and others reiterated calls for a two-state solution, which would see the creation of an independent Palestine in the West Bank and Gaza Strip, with East Jerusalem as its capital, alongside Israel.</p><p>Israel and the US criticised the move as a \"reward for Hamas\".</p><p>The Israeli military launched a campaign in Gaza in response to the Hamas-led attack on southern Israel on 7 October 2023, in which about 1,200 people were killed and 251 others were taken hostage.</p><p>At least 65,502 people have been killed in Israeli attacks in Gaza since then, according to the territory's Hamas-run health ministry. A UN commission of inquiry has said Israel has committed genocide against Palestinians in Gaza, which Israel denies.</p></div>"

He then wrote reports using this information, and sent it to Chinese Communist Party intelligence using encrypted software. </p><p>The foreign office staffer, Ho Jen-chieh, was sentenced to eight years and two months in jail. </p><p>Huang was also accused of working with another ex-DPP staffer, Chiu Shih-yuan to collect more information. The court heard that Chiu sourced information from Wu Shangyu, who was an aide to Lai Ching-te, the current president. </p><p>Wu served as Lai's aide when he was the VP and then again for a short while after he became president in 2024. Wu was accused of passing on details about Lai's itineraries during his travels. </p><p>Huang received almost NT$5m ($163,172; £122,203) from the Chinese government, the court said, while Chiu was paid more than NT$2m. </p><p>\"The information they spied on, collected, leaked and delivered involved important diplomatic intelligence...which made our country's difficult diplomatic situation even worse,\" said the court on Thursday.</p></div><div><p>These are just the latest in a string of espionage convictions as Taiwan ramps up efforts to find alleged Chinese spies on its soil.  </p><p>In 2024, Taiwan's National Security Bureau said 64 people were prosecuted for spying for China. That is a marked increase compared to previous years - between 2013 and 2019, there were 44 espionage cases registered by Taiwan's Ministry of Justice.</p><p>Espionage allegations have been levelled against several high-ranking Taiwan officials in recent years, including an ex-air force colonel who in 2023 was jailed for 20 years for running a military spy ring for China. </p><p>Taiwan's relationship with China has become the subject of a deeply polarising debate. On one side is Lai's DPP which is more outspoken against China and is seen as being pro-independence, and on the other is the Kuomintang (KMT) party, which has always been friendlier with China, and encouraged more dialogue.  </p><p>The DPP accuses the KMT of being used by Beijing to pedal its influence - while critics of the ruling party and President Lai say he is cracking down on the opposition under the guise of targeting \"pro-China\" sympathisers.</p><p>This has been playing out as China reiterates its claims over Taiwan, testing its naval and air defences with regular incursions. </p><p>President Lai has often spoken out against China as a danger to Taiwan, calling it a \"foreign hostile force\". </p><p>Beijing, in turn, has repeatedly criticised him, calling him a \"destroyer of cross-straits peace\".</p></div>"

He knew with a high likelihood ICE detainees would be transported that morning in the exact location where he was facing from his perch on a nearby rooftop,\" Mr Rothrock said.</p><p>\"The clearest motivations at this point are the harm he wanted to cause to ICE. We're not aware of any specific relationships he had with anybody in detention,\" Mr Rothrock said, but noted the investigation was ongoing.</p><p>Jahn's handwritten notes indicate \"he did not expect to survive this event\", the agent said. </p><p>Marcos Charles, ICE field office director of enforcement and removal operations, said \"violent rhetoric\" against ICE had to stop.</p><p>\"In contrast to those who would demonise our men and women, yesterday our brave officers ran back into danger\" alongside other federal agents to save detainees, he said.</p><p>Mr Charles added that the shooter used apps designed to track ICE officers, and said those producing and distributing them were \"well aware of the dangers that they are exposing\" officers to.</p></div>"

Not only did they send a 70 year-old man to five years in jail, it was a shocking 20 years after the offence.</p><p>They also stipulated that the sentence was not \"suspensive\" – in other words they said he would go to jail even if he lodged an appeal, even though in French law pending an appeal he is in theory still innocent.</p><p>Just when you thought the old passions for and against the man were beginning to fade, suddenly they are back with a vengeance.</p><p>Many will feel some sympathy with Sarkozy – not necessarily that he is entirely guiltless in this matter of seeking Libyan campaign money.</p></div><div><p>But they will see some truth in his claims of victimisation: that there are indeed some in the Paris \"politico-mediatic-judicial\" establishment who loathe the former president and rejoice in bringing him down.</p><p>Look through another lens, though, and Sarkozy is not some hard-done-by ex-head of state, but an egotistical and highly influential political operator who has consistently pushed the law to its limits in order to get his way.</p><p>Why else would there be such a litany of lawsuits against him? Why else would Sarkozy already have been convicted on two other charges of corruption – once for trying to suborn a judge, and another time for illegal campaign funding?</p><p>And if the court has now decided to throw the book at him in the Libya affair,  maybe it is because the charge of trying to elicit election funds from a foreign dictator is actually a rather serious one.</p><p>It is all relevant today because even though Sarkozy is no longer the influential figure that some make him out to be, the arguments about this case echo through the hall of ruins that are French politics.</p><p>The right and far-right take up his cause, crying foul about left-wing judicial over-reach. Marine Le Pen – herself banned from running for the presidency because of a \"no-suspension\" clause in her own conviction early this year – was first to denounce the \"injustice\".</p><p>And the left sees it all as more evidence of rich men's privilege – the powerful getting more powerful by blithely ignoring the law.</p><p>Nicolas Sarkozy has long since left office, and there is no prospect of his returning.  He is a figure of the past.  But his case lays bare the divisions in a very divided country.</p></div>"
