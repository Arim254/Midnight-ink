The court found Gueant guilty of corruption, among other charges, and Hortefeux was found guilty of criminal conspiracy.</p><p>Sarkozy's wife, Italian-born former supermodel and singer Carla Bruni-Sarkozy, was <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cd1xv3xewdno\">charged last year with hiding evidence linked to the Gaddafi case</a> and associating with wrongdoers to commit fraud, both of which she denies.</p><p>Since losing his re-election bid in 2012, Sarkozy has been targeted by several criminal investigations.</p><p>He also appealed against a February 2024 ruling which found him <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-68293760\">guilty of overspending on his 2012 re-election campaign</a>, then hiring a PR firm to cover it up. He was handed a one-year sentence, of which six months were suspended.</p><p>In 2021, he was found guilty of trying to bribe a judge in 2014 and became the first former French president to get a custodial sentence. In December, the Paris appeals court ruled that he could serve his time at home wearing a tag instead of going to jail.</p></div>"

    "body": "<div><p>An Australian film that was digitally altered to change a same-sex couple to a heterosexual one has drawn backlash from moviegoers in China.</p><p>Together, a horror film starring Dave Franco and Alison Brie, was shown in selected Chinese cinemas in advance screenings on 12 September. Cinemagoers later realised some scenes had been modified after screenshots showing the original scenes went viral online.</p><p>The film was due to be publicly released on 19 September - but as of Thursday has yet to be aired in cinemas. </p><p>The film's global distributor, Neon, later condemned the edit, saying they did not \"approve of [this] unauthorised edit... and demand they ceased distribution\", according to reports. </p></div><div><p>The supernatural body horror film, written and directed by Australian Michael Shanks, follows a couple who move to the countryside and find themselves encountering a mysterious force that impacts their bodies, lives and relationship.</p><p>The film, which first premiered at the Sundance Film Festival in January and released in US and Australia in July, has received largely positive reviews from critics, earning a 90% freshness score on film review site Rotten Tomatoes.</p><p>But as soon as the advance screenings began in China this month, viewers noticed that some sex and nudity scenes had been modified after screenshots showing scenes from the original version circulated online. </p><p>In one scene which pictured the male lead in the shower, they noticed that the Chinese version had added steam to obscure the lead's nude body.</p><p>Most complaints, however, were about an image featuring a gay couple which had been digitally altered, with a man's face replaced by a woman's. Several references to the same-sex relationship in the film were also removed.</p><p>It's not uncommon for China - where same-sex marriage isn't recognised and LGBT topics remain largely taboo - to censor LGBT content. But this time, the use of what appeared to be AI-generated alterations struck a nerve.</p><p>\"This is no longer just a matter of cuts - it's a matter of distortion and misrepresentation,\" reads one post on popular Chinese film critic platform Douban, where the movie has a rating of 6.9 out of 10.</p><p>\"Not only did they alter the plot, but they also disrespected the actor's sexual orientation. It's disgusting,\" reads another.</p><p>On Wednesday, the film's global distributor, Neon spoke out against the edits,  criticising the film's Chinese distributor, Hishow, which has yet to comment on the matter. </p><p>\"Neon does not approve of Hishow's unauthorised edit of the film and have demanded they cease distributing this altered version,\" the company said in a statement sent to the BBC.</p><p>It's not the first time China has used AI to alter sexual content. In Oscar-winning film Oppenheimer, a nude scene featuring Florence Pugh was edited with an AI-generated black dress for Chinese cinemas.</p><p>China is also apparently cracking down on same-sex content. Since February, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c056nle2drno\">at least 30 writers of gay erotic fictions</a>, nearly all of them women in their 20s, have been arrested across the country.</p></div>"

But he said he \"rejected\" the actions of Hamas in its attack on Israel on 7 October 2023.</p></div><div><p>That attack, in which about 1,200 people - mostly civilians - were killed and 251 taken hostage, triggered the war in Gaza. At least 65,502 Palestinians, about half of them women and children, have been killed by Israeli military action in Gaza since then, according to Gaza's Hamas-run health ministry.</p><p>Abbas, 89, was barred from travelling to New York to appear in person when he and 80 other Palestinian officials had their visas revoked by the US state department last month.</p><p>US Secretary of State Marco Rubio blamed them for undermining peace efforts and for seeking \"the unilateral recognition of a conjectural Palestinian state\".</p><p>In his speech, Abbas thanked those countries which had recently recognised a Palestinian state in a wave of declarations which began with Canada, Australia, the UK and Portugal on Sunday.</p><p>France, Belgium, Luxembourg, Malta, Monaco, San Marino, Andorra, and Denmark followed. </p><p>The US is currently opposed to recognising Palestine, saying such a move is a reward for Hamas.</p><p>Abbas endorsed the peace plan announced by French President Emmanuel Macron at Monday's summit, which was co-chaired by Saudi Arabia.</p><p>The plan calls for the simultaneous release of the 48 remaining hostages held by Hamas with an end to Israeli military operations across Gaza. </p><p>That would be followed by a transitional administration - including Abbas's Palestinian Authority (PA) and excluding Hamas - to run Gaza, paving the way for a \"sovereign, independent, and demilitarised State of Palestine\".</p><p>Neither the US nor Israel have supported the plan. </p><p>Abbas though said he was \"read[y] to work with President Donald Trump, the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, France, the United Nations, and all partners to implement the peace plan... paving the way toward a just peace and comprehensive regional co-operation\".</p><p>He also called for a Palestinian state to assume \"full responsibilities\" for the Gaza Strip following an Israeli withdrawal and connect it with the Israeli-occupied West Bank. He said this would be done with Arab and international support. </p><p>Israel has previously rejected any future post-war role for the PA in Gaza.</p><p>The Palestinian president also said there would be \"national efforts toward reform, including holding presidential and parliamentary elections within one year of the war's end\". </p><p>\"We want a democratic, modern state committed to international law, rule of law, pluralism, peaceful transfer of power, and the empowerment of women and youth.\"</p><p>The last national Palestinian elections were held in 2006 and were won by Hamas.</p><p>The group violently ejected Abbas's Fatah faction - their political rivals - from Gaza the following year, leaving it in sole power there.</p></div>"

I am truly grateful.\"</p></div><div><p>Between 1992 and now, anyone offering tattoos without medical credentials faced up to five years in prison or a fine of up to 50 million Korean won ($35,000; £28,000).</p><p>There are no official statistics on how many tattooists have been prosecuted, but South Korea's Tattoo Union says it gives legal support to at least 50 each year, and believes there are many more that result in fines.</p><p>As of 2021, there were an estimated 350,000 tattoo artists in the country, according to the Ministry of Health and Welfare - most of whom specialised in semi-permanent make-up for lips, eyebrows or hairlines.</p><p>But relatively few of these have medical qualifications. Instead, most come from art or beauty backgrounds like elsewhere in the world.</p><p>By technically engaging in an illegal practice, tattoo artists in South Korea have been subjected to threats or reported by disgruntled clients.</p><p>A female tattoo artist who goes by the pseudonym Narr previously told the BBC that she had been sexually harassed by a man after tattooing him, but did not report the incident to the authorities for fear of being prosecuted.</p><p>Another, who goes by Banul, was reported to the police by a client who wanted five million Korean won ($3,500; £2,800) after claiming without evidence that it had smudged.</p><p>But in recent years, South Korean courts have acquitted several tattoo artists, signalling a shift in attitudes.</p><p>Park Ju-min, chairman of the National Assembly's health and welfare committee and the law's main legislative proponent, noted that many politicians in the house had eyebrow or lip tattoos.</p><p>He said the passing of the law will allow \"citizens to get tattoos safely, and those engaged in the tattoo industry will be recognised as legal professionals\".</p><p>However, the change of law has faced opposition from South Korea's medical community.</p><p>Ahead of its passing, the Korean Medical Association said tattooing \"not only damages the skin but can also pose other health risks, including interference with cancer diagnosis\".</p><p>It stated that \"tattooing is fundamentally a medical procedure, and its growing popularity does not reduce the associated risks\".</p><p>There are also some in the industry who feel that, despite their popularity among young people and growing prominence in influencer culture, the change of law will not reverse the stigma towards tattoos. Recent opinion polls suggest a majority of South Koreans still view them negatively.</p><p>Though the tattooing prohibition will no longer be a permanent feature of South Korean society, removing it completely may be a slow and painful process.</p><p>The new law will only take effect in two years, with tattoo artists having to pass a national exam, complete safety and hygiene training, and keep detailed records.</p><p>Tattoo removals, done using a laser, will still be limited to medical professionals.</p></div>"

That we are too small to resist... But Moldova is our home. And our home is not for sale,\" the president said.</p><p>The BBC has recently uncovered evidence of a network with ties to Moscow and fugitive Moldovan businessman Ilan Shor which has been working to spread disinformation.</p><p><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c4g5kl0n5d2o\">An undercover reporter found people being paid to post fake content online, </a>intended to undermine the governing party ahead of the vote. The posts have had millions of views. Shor has not responded to a BBC request for comment.</p><p>Speaking at the UN's General Assembly in New York on Wednesday, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky warned that Europe could not afford to lose Moldova to Russian influence, after failing to save Georgia and Belarus from Moscow's orbit.</p><p>Zelensky said that Russian President Vladimir Putin - who launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022 - \"will keep driving the war forward wider and deeper\" if he was not stopped.</p><p>Meanwhile, Moldova's pro-Russian parties have accused Sandu of trying to intimidate them - and sway the vote.</p><p>They also say her government is not going far enough in tackling widespread corruption.</p><p>Russia's SVR foreign intelligence service this week accused European countries of plotting the \"blatant falsification\" of the result on Sunday in order to provoke protests.</p><p>The SVR warned that the EU could mount \"an armed incursion and de-facto occupation\" of Moldova, falsely claiming that the EU was deploying troops.</p><p>Moldova declared its independence as the USSR collapsed in 1991, but it has a significant Russian-speaking population. The breakaway region of Transnistria, propped up by Moscow, is still home to a contingent of Russian troops.</p></div>"

They ought to be ashamed of themselves.\"</p></div><div><p>He also called for the arrest of the people responsible for the escalator incident, referencing an article in <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.thetimes.com/article/c8ce756d-fca7-4def-93d3-582b5cdb9889?shareToken=3b9d356601bfe04496087b303bf3704c%27\">the Times</a> that said UN workers joked about turning off the escalators.</p><p>\"This was absolutely sabotage... All security tapes at the escalator should be saved, especially the emergency stop button. The Secret Service is involved,\" Trump added.</p><p>Mike Waltz, US ambassador to the UN, echoed the president's call for an official probe, saying the incidents were \"unacceptable\".</p><p>\"The United States will not tolerate threats to our security or dignity at international forums. We expect swift cooperation and decisive action,\" he wrote on X.</p><p>On Wednesday, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt raised concerns that someone deliberately stopped the escalator.</p><p>\"If someone at the UN intentionally stopped the escalator as the President and First Lady were stepping on, they need to be fired and investigated immediately,\" she wrote on X after the incident.</p><p>Stephane Dujarric, spokesperson for Guterres, said Trump's videographer \"may have inadvertently triggered the safety function\" while filming the couple.</p><p>After the escalator mishap, Trump ran into more technical difficulties when he said the teleprompter was not working - although it was restored towards the end of his address.</p><p>\"I can only say that whoever's operating this teleprompter is in big trouble,\" he said.</p><p>A UN official later told the BBC the White House was operating the teleprompter at the time, bringing their own laptops and plugging them into the UN's system.</p><p>Trump also referred to audio issues in his lengthy post, saying \"the sound was completely off in the Auditorium\".</p><p>\"World Leaders, unless they used the interpreters' earpieces, couldn't hear a thing,\" he added.</p><p>In response to Trump's comments, a UN official said: ''The sound system was designed to allow people at their seats to hear speeches being translated into six different languages through earpieces.\"</p></div>"

It is clear from these notes that he was targeting ICE agents and ICE personnel.\"</p><p>The victims have not yet been identified. </p><p>But Mexico's foreign ministry has said one injured detainee is a Mexican national. </p><p>Officials had previously said that no law enforcement officers were injured or killed during the incident.</p><p>FBI director Kash Patel said in a post on social media earlier that evidence \"to this point indicates a high degree of pre-attack planning\".</p><p>Patel said one of the handwritten notes found said: \"Hopefully this will give ICE agents real terror, to think, 'is there a sniper with AP rounds on that roof?\"</p></div><div><p>At the news conference on Thursday, Larson said the shooter \"very likely acted alone\".</p><p>\"That morning gunshots sprayed the length of the building, the windows, and law enforcement vans that were in the sallyport area,\" she said, adding detainees were hit.</p><p>The notes were found at the shooter's residence, and included a \"gameplan of the attack\", she said. </p><p>The suspected shooter described ICE employees as \"people showing up to collect a dirty pay check\" according to Ms Larson. </p><p>She said the shooter had hoped his actions would \"terrorise ICE employees and interfere with their work\".</p><p>\"What he did is the very definition of terrorism,\" she added.</p><p>No evidence was found of membership of any specific group, and the shooter did not mention any specific government agency other than ICE, she said, but the man did express his hatred of the federal government.</p><p>She also praised ICE and other federal agents she said worked under fire to remove detainees from vans and get them to safety.</p><p>FBI special agent Joe Rothrock said it was a \"targeted, ambush-style attack on law enforcement\" that followed months of planning.</p><p>The shooter \"specifically intended to kill ICE agents\" and fired at transport vehicles carrying ICE personnel, federal and detainees, he said.</p><p>\"Jahn also acknowledged the potential for other casualties. He knew with a high likelihood ICE detainees would be transported that morning in the exact location where he was facing from his perch on a nearby rooftop,\" he said.</p><p>\"The clearest motivations at this point are the harm he wanted to cause to ICE. We're not aware of any specific relationships he had with anybody in detention,\" Mr Rothrock said, but noted the investigation was ongoing.</p><p>Jahn's hand-written notes indicate \"he did not expect to survive this event\", the agent said. </p><p>Marcos Charles,  ICE field office director of enforcement and removal operations, said \"violent rhetoric\" against ICE has to stop.</p><p>\"In contrast to those who would demonise our men and women, yesterday our brave officers ran back into danger,\" he said, alongside other federal agents, \"to save the detainees while shots were still being fired.\"</p><p>He said the shooter used apps designed to track ICE officers, and said those producing and distributing them are \"well aware of the dangers that they are exposing to law enforcement\".</p><p>Tensions have escalated at ICE facilities in recent months amid the Trump administration's efforts to significantly increase deportations as part of a wider crackdown on illegal immigration. </p></div>"

In 2019 it was expelled from a programme where it produced parts for the warplane after it acquired air defence systems from Russia.</p></div><div><p>During a brief question-and-answer session alongside Erdogan in the Oval Office on Thursday, Trump said he would like Turkey to stop \"buying any oil from Russia while Russia continues its rampage against Ukraine\". </p><p>\"The best thing he could do is not buy oil and gas from Russia,\" Trump said. \"If he did that, that would be the best thing.\" </p><p>Trump added that he believes Erdogan is respected both by Ukrainian President Volodomyr Zelensky and Russian President Vladimir Putin, meaning that he could \"have a big influence\" on the war  \"if he wants to\". </p><p>Alongside India and China, Turkey is among Moscow's biggest customers for oil and gas exports, and data shows that the volume of Russian gas that reached Europe through Turkey rose by over 26% earlier this year.</p><p>The US president's comments come just weeks after <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c62zxp1y5lwo\">he said he stood poised to impose tougher sanctions on Russia</a> if Nato countries met conditions that included halting imports of Russian oil. </p><p>Earlier this week - during a lengthy speech at the UN General Assembly - Trump also accused Nato allies of \"funding the war against themselves\" through their purchases of energy from Moscow. </p></div><div><p>During Trump's first term in office, the US removed Turkey from the F-35 programme after it purchased S-400 surface-to-air missile systems from Russia. </p><p>A US defence bill passed in 2020 included an amendment that prevented Turkey from acquiring F-35s, unless - and only if - the US government is able to certify that it has given up on the Russian S-400.</p><p>Some US lawmakers have expressed concerns about the potential sale over Turkish military incursions into Syria and past violations of Greek airspace. </p><p>Earlier this week, the bipartisan Hellenic Caucus in the US Congress warned against allowing Turkey to buy F-35s, citing its military co-operation with Russia and a \"disregard for international norms and democratic principles\". </p><p>In the Oval Office, however, Trump told Erdogan that he would \"be successful\" with buying the things he would \"like to buy\". </p><p>\"He needs certain things, and we need certain things,\" he said. \"And we're going to come to a conclusion. You'll know by the end of the day.\" </p><p>In an interview with Fox News on Monday, Erdogan said of the F-35 ban: \"I don't think it is very becoming of a strategic partnership.\"</p><p>Trump also said that sanctions against Turkey - implemented in 2020 following the S-400 purchase - could be lifted \"very soon\". </p><p>\"If we have a good meeting, almost immediately\", he added. </p><p>The meeting between Trump and Erdogan is their second this week, following a brief discussion they had about Gaza at the UN General Assembly, alongside leaders from several Arab and Muslim nations. </p><p>In his interview with Fox, Erdogan also accused US ally Israel of committing a \"complete genocide\" in Gaza and blamed Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu - a position starkly different from Trump's public remarks.</p><p>In the Oval Office on Thursday, however, the US and Turkish presidents avoided public disagreement on the issue. Israel denies it is committing genocide in Gaza.</p></div>"

follows the poisoning of 800 students last week in West Java and Central Sulawesi provinces.</p><p>President Prabowo has made the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c77ne2vnkg3o\">nutritious meals programme</a> – which aims to offer free lunches to 80 million school children – a signature of his leadership.</p></div><div><p>But a spate of mass food poisoning incidents has led non-governmental organisations to call for authorities to suspend the programme due to health concerns.</p><p>Muhaimin Iskandar, Coordinating Minister for Community Empowerment, said on Wednesday that \"there are no plans to stop it\".</p><p>Victims of the recent outbreaks complained of stomach aches, dizziness, and nausea – as well as shortness of breath, which is a non-typical symptom of food poisoning.</p><p>In previous cases of food poisoning stemming from the free lunch programme negligent food preparation has been cited as a suspected cause.</p><p>This week's victims ate meals that included soy sauce chicken, fried tofu, vegetables and fruit – but past poisoning incidents have been linked to expired sauce and, in one case, the serving of fried shark.</p><p>The head of Indonesia's National Nutrition Agency (BGN) Dadan Hindayana said on Wednesday that the mass food poisoning in Cipongkor last week was the result of a technical error by the Nutrition Fulfillment Service Unit (SPPG).</p><p>The SPPG's operations in Cipongkor have reportedly been suspended, according to the BGN.</p><p>West Bandung regent Jeje Ritchie Ismail said his party had declared the mass poisoning in Cipongkor \"an extraordinary event so that handling can be faster and more comprehensive\".</p></div><figure><div><p><img

    "body": "<div><div><p>4 hours ago</p></div><p><span><p><span>Hugh Schofield</span><span>Paris correspondent</span></p></span></p></div><div><p>Nicolas Sarkozy is back where he used to be – dominating the news and dividing the nation.</p><p>Thirteen years after he left office, he is about to become the first former French president to be sent to prison after getting a five-year term for criminal conspiracy.</p><p>And the circumstances are full of the same sulphurous contention that used once to mark his every move.</p><p>Fresh from his sentencing in the \"Libyan money\" trial on Thursday, he spoke with incandescent rage about the \"limitless hatred\" of which he said he was still a victim.</p></div><div><p>From the moment he emerged as a champion of the right, Sarkozy was convinced he had been the target of a left-wing cabal within the French judiciary and media.</p><p>And with this sentence - he thinks – has come more incontrovertible proof.</p><p>Why, his supporters are asking, did the court clear him of three of the four charges weighing against him: illegal party funding, embezzlement of Libyan funds, and corruption?</p><p>Why did the court only convict him of the last charge – the \"catch-all\" one of \"criminal association\" (often thrown at drugs gang members when investigators have nothing else to go on)?</p><p>And why – having convicted him on this lesser charge – did the court then give him such a humiliating and draconian punishment? Not only did they send a 70 year-old man to five years in jail, it was a shocking 20 years after the offence.</p><p>They also stipulated that the sentence was not \"suspensive\" – in other words they said he would go to jail even if he lodged an appeal, even though in French law pending an appeal he is in theory still innocent.</p><p>Just when you thought the old passions for and against the man were beginning to fade, suddenly they are back with a vengeance.</p><p>Many will feel some sympathy with Sarkozy – not necessarily that he is entirely guiltless in this matter of seeking Libyan campaign money.</p></div><div><p>But they will see some truth in his claims of victimisation: that there are indeed some in the Paris \"politico-mediatic-judicial\" establishment who loathe the former president and rejoice in bringing him down.</p><p>Look through another lens, though, and Sarkozy is not some hard-done-by ex-head of state, but an egotistical and highly influential political operator who has consistently pushed the law to its limits in order to get his way.</p><p>Why else would there be such a litany of lawsuits against him? Why else would Sarkozy already have been convicted on two other charges of corruption – once for trying to suborn a judge, and another time for illegal campaign funding?</p><p>And if the court has now decided to throw the book at him in the Libya affair,  maybe it is because the charge of trying to elicit election funds from a foreign dictator is actually a rather serious one.</p><p>It is all relevant today because even though Sarkozy is no longer the influential figure that some make him out to be, the arguments about this case echo through the hall of ruins that are French politics.</p><p>The right and far-right take up his cause, crying foul about left-wing judicial over-reach. Marine Le Pen – herself banned from running for the presidency because of a \"no-suspension\" clause in her own conviction early this year – was first to denounce the \"injustice\".</p><p>And the left sees it all as more evidence of rich men's privilege – the powerful getting more powerful by blithely ignoring the law.</p><p>Nicolas Sarkozy has long since left office, and there is no prospect of his returning.  He is a figure of the past.  But his case lays bare the divisions in a very divided country.</p></div>"
