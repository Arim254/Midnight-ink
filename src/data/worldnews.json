    "body": "<div><p>A French murder trial that opened Monday has transfixed the public because of the mystery at its core: where is the victim's body?</p><p>Cédric Jubillar, a 38 year-old painter-decorator, is accused of killing his wife Delphine nearly five years ago in a fit of jealous rage. </p><p>He has always denied the charges and, other than circumstantial evidence, investigators have struggled to build a case. There is no body, no blood, no confession, and no witness.</p><p>With its unexplained central fact and its cast of characters from small-town southern France, the affair has become a social media sensation.</p></div><div><p>Self-declared investigators have set up countless chat groups where they swap theories and share testimony – much to the irritation of police and families.</p><p>\"These groups are the equivalent of the bistro counter – but with more people,\" said psychoanalyst Patrick Avrane, author of a book on attitudes to crime.</p><p>\"Everyone constructs the theory that suits him or her the best.\"</p><p>The Jubillar mystery began at the height of Covid lockdown when – in the early hours on 16 December 2020 – Cédric Jubillar contacted the gendarmes to report that his wife had gone missing.</p><p>Delphine, who was 33 at the time, was a night nurse in a clinic not far from their home in Cagnac-les-Mines in the south-western Occitania region. The couple had two children, aged six and 18 months.</p><p>Police came to understand that the Jubillars did not have a happy relationship. </p><p>Cédric Jubillar was a habitual cannabis user and barely held down a job. Delphine was in a relationship with a man she had met over the Internet. She and Cédric were talking about divorce.</p><p>Police and locals conducted extensive searches in the surrounding countryside – with potholers descending into some of the disused mineshafts with which the area is dotted.</p><p>Delphine's body was never found, but a case was gradually built against her husband and in mid-2021 he was placed under investigation and detained.</p><p>The prosecution at the trial in the town of Albi will tell the court that Cédric Jubillar had a clear motivation to kill his wife, because of their impending split.</p><p>Lawyers will raise other points: certain odd actions by Cédric on the night of the disappearance; signs of a fight, including a pair of broken glasses; a neighbour who heard a woman screaming.</p><p>Cédric Jubillar's own character will be brought under the spotlight, with witnesses expected who will speak of his threatening language to Delphine before she disappeared, and his apparent lack of concern after.</p><p>Two of his acquaintances – a former cellmate and a former girlfriend – will also repeat what they told police: that Cédric confessed to the murder and told them where her body was.</p><p>But after more digging no body has been found, and the defence is expected to raise doubts about the veracity of the pair's accounts.</p><p>Indeed the heart of Cédric Jubillar's case is that there is nothing – beyond the popular view that he is the ideal culprit – to prove that he did away with his wife. He himself has always protested his innocence.</p><p>The trial is expected to last four weeks, with 65 witnesses called and 11 experts. More than 16,000 pages of evidence have been compiled.</p><p>Explaining the case's grip on the public mind, writer Thibault de Montaigu said in Le Figaro newspaper it was like \"a novel by Georges Simenon\" – creator of the fictional detective Inspector Maigret.</p><p>In a long analysis of the case, he said that for all the circumstantial evidence against Cédric Jubillar, the central question was this: how a \"red-eyed, fuzzy-brained guy who smoked ten joints a day could have carried out the perfect crime?</p><p>\"Killing his wife without leaving the slightest trace; secretly transporting her body, burying her in an unfindable location, then coming back to tell the police – all while his two children slept quietly in their bedrooms.</p><p>\"And this was a guy who greeted the cops in panda pyjamas and then played Game of Thrones on his phone the very morning of the disappearance.</p><p>\"So: genius bluffer; lucky fool; or poor innocent?\"</p><p>The court will decide.</p></div>"

Tylenol maker Kenvue has defended the use of the drug in pregnant women.</p></div><div><p>In a statement to the BBC, it said: \"We believe independent, sound science clearly shows that taking acetaminophen does not cause autism. We strongly disagree with any suggestion otherwise and are deeply concerned with the health risk this poses for expecting mothers.\"</p><p>Acetaminophen - Tylenol's active ingredient - is the safest pain reliever option for pregnant women, it added, and without it, women face a dangerous choice between suffering through conditions like fever or using riskier alternatives.</p><p>During the announcement on Monday, Kennedy said the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) will issue a physicians notice about what he described as the potential risk of taking Tylenol during pregnancy.</p><p>He said the FDA will also begin the process of initiating a safety label change on the medication and launch a public health campaign to spread awareness.</p><p>The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists said in a statement that the announcement \"is not backed by the full body of scientific evidence and dangerously simplifies the many and complex causes of neurologic challenges in children\".</p><p>Kennedy added that the FDA will soon approve Leucovorin, a decades-old drug traditionally used to protect cancer patients against toxicity from chemotherapy, to be used as treatment for children with autism.</p><p>FDA Commissioner Marty Makary said the approval will be based on research that he said suggests the drug, which is a form of vitamin B, may help children with autism who are deficient in folate improve their verbal communication.</p><p>In April, Kennedy pledged \"a massive testing and research effort\" to determine the cause of autism in five months. </p><p>Trump on Monday called the rise in reported autism cases a \"horrible crisis\", and an issue that he has \"very strong feelings about\". </p><p>But experts have cautioned that finding the causes of autism - a complex syndrome that has been researched for decades - would not be simple. </p><p>The widely held view of researchers is that there is no single cause of autism, which is thought to be the result of a complex mix of genetic and environmental factors.</p><ul><li><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cx25l92q9xgo\">Tylenol-maker shares hit after report of autism link</a></li></ul><p>The American College of Obstetrics and Gynecology said doctors across the country have consistently identified Tylenol as one of the only safe pain relievers for pregnant women.</p><p>\"Studies that have been conducted in the past, show no clear evidence that proves a direct relationship between the prudent use of acetaminophen during any trimester and fetal developmental issues,\" the group has said. </p><p>The drug is recommended by other major medical groups as well as other governments around the world. </p></div><div><p>In August, a <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://hsph.harvard.edu/news/using-acetaminophen-during-pregnancy-may-increase-childrens-autism-and-adhd-risk/\">review of research</a> led by the dean of Harvard University's Chan School of Public Health found that children may be more likely to develop autism and other neurodevelopmental disorders when exposed to Tylenol during pregnancy. </p><p>Researchers argued some steps should be taken to limit use of the drug, but said it was still important for treating maternal fever and pain, which can also have negative effects for children. </p><p>But another <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38592388/\">study, published in 2024,</a> found no relationship between exposure to Tylenol and autism. </p><p>It was conducted by looking at a population sample of 2.4 million children born in Sweden between 1995 to 2019. Around 7.5% of them were exposed to acetaminophen during pregnancy. </p><p>By comparing autism rates between those exposed versus those who were not, as well as comparing siblings who shared genetics, the study concluded that there was no increased risk of autism, ADHD or intellectual disability that can be definitively linked to acetaminophen.</p><p>\"There is no robust evidence or convincing studies to suggest there is any causal relationship,\" said Monique Botha, a professor in social and developmental psychology at Durham University. </p><p>Dr Botha added that pain relief for pregnant women was \"woefully lacking\", with Tylenol being one of the only safe options for the population. </p><p>Autism diagnoses have increased sharply since 2000, and by 2020 the rate among 8-year-olds reached 2.77%, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).</p><p>Scientists attribute at least part of the rise to increased awareness of autism and an expanding definition of the disorder. Researchers have also been investigating environmental factors.</p><p>In the past, Kennedy has offered debunked theories about the rising rates of autism, blaming vaccines despite a lack of evidence. </p></div>"

    "body": "<p></p><figcaption>Watch: President Macron announces that France formally recognises state of Palestine</figcaption><p></p><div><p>France has formally recognised a Palestinian state, becoming the latest in a wave of countries to take the step.</p><p>Speaking at the UN in New York, President Emmanuel Macron said \"the time for peace has come\" and that \"nothing justifies the ongoing war in Gaza\". </p><p>France and Saudi Arabia are hosting a one-day summit at the UN General Assembly    focused on plans for a two-state solution to the conflict. G7 states Germany, Italy, and the US did not attend. </p><p>Belgium, Luxembourg, Malta, Andorra and San Marino are also due to recognise a Palestinian state, after the UK, Canada, Australia and Portugal announced recognition on Sunday. </p></div><div><p>International pressure is ramping up on Israel over the unfolding humanitarian crisis in Gaza and settlement building in the West Bank.</p><p>Israel has said recognition would reward Hamas for the Palestinian armed group's 7 October 2023 attack on southern Israel in which about 1,200 people were killed and 251 taken hostage.</p><p>More than 65,000 Palestinians have been killed by Israel since, according to Gaza's Hamas-run health ministry. Israeli forces are currently carrying out a ground offensive aimed at taking control of Gaza City, where a million people were living and a famine was confirmed last month.</p><p>The French leader told the conference that the time had come to stop the war and free the remaining Israeli hostages held by Hamas. He warned against the \"peril of endless wars\" and said \"right must always prevail over might\".</p><p>The international community had failed to build a just and lasting peace in the Middle East, he said, adding that \"we must do everything in our power to preserve the possibility of a two-state solution\" that would see \"Israel and Palestine side by side in peace and security\".</p><p>Saudi Arabia's Foreign Minister Faisal bin Farhan Al Saud also addressed the UN, on behalf of Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman.</p><p>He reiterated that a two-state solution was the only way to achieve lasting peace in the region.</p><p>European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said the EU would set up a new financial instrument to work on Gaza's reconstruction.</p><p>\"We must all do more,\" she told the UN General Assembly. \"This is why we will set up a Palestine Donor Group.\" </p><p>UN secretary general Antonio Guterres referred to the situation in Gaza as \"morally, legally and politically intolerable\" and said a two-state solution was the \"only credible path\" for peace between Israelis and Palestinians. </p><p>Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas - who was blocked from attending the UN General Assembly in person after the US revoked his and other Palestinian officials' visas - addressed the conference via videolink.</p><p>He called for a permanent ceasefire and said Hamas could have no role in governing Gaza, calling for the group to \"surrender their weapons\" to the Palestinian Authority (PA).</p><p>\"What we want is one unified state without weapons,\" he said.</p><p>Abbas also condemned Hamas's 7 October 2023 attack on southern Israel and addressed Israelis, saying: \"Our future and yours depends on peace. Enough violence and war.\"</p></div><div><p>Macron said France was ready to contribute to a \"stabilisation mission\" in Gaza and called for a transitional administration involving the PA that would oversee the dismantling of Hamas.</p><p>He said France would only open an embassy to a Palestinian state when all the hostages being held by Hamas are released and a ceasefire had been agreed.</p><p>Israel's ambassador to the UN, Danny Dannon, spoke to reporters shortly before Macron's announcement. </p><p>Dannon said a two-state solution was taken \"off the table\" after the 7 October attack and called this week's talks at the UN a \"charade\".  He also refused to rule out Israel annexing the occupied West Bank. </p><p>Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has insisted there will be no Palestinian state to the west of the River Jordan, and President Isaac Herzog said recognising one would only \"embolden the forces of darkness\".</p><p>Ahead of Macron's announcement, the Palestinian and Israeli flags were displayed on the Eiffel Tower on Sunday night. A number of town halls in France also flew Palestinian flags on Monday, despite a government order to local prefects to maintain neutrality.</p><p>Pro-Palestinian protests also took place in some <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c1jz8rdypw4o\">80 towns and cities across Italy</a>, where Giorgia Meloni's government said recently it could be \"counter-productive\" to recognise a state that did not exist.</p><p>In Germany, the government has said Palestinian statehood is not currently up for debate, and Foreign Minister Johann Wadephul explained as he left for New York on Monday that, \"For Germany, recognition of a Palestinian state comes more at the end of the process. But this process must begin now\".</p></div>"

The 36-year-old former beauty contestant, podcaster and businesswoman took the opportunity to preach unity - including forgiveness for her husband's killer.</p><p>\"The answer to hate is not hate,\" she said, her voice cracking. \"The answer, we know from the Gospel, is love and always love. Love for our enemies, and love for those who persecute us.\"</p><p>It was a powerful speech from a woman who has quickly found her footing in the harshest of spotlights. Last week, Turning Point USA named her the head of the conservative youth organization that her late husband founded, a group that is flush with new energy and determination in the aftermath of Kirk's murder.</p><p>Sunday night proved Erika Kirk has the strength and character to be an effective public face for the Turning Point USA.</p><p>She eventually could become a formidable candidate for public office in her home of Arizona, a key political battleground state. Her words also offered a contrast to the bombast and confrontation that has typified most of modern American politics.</p></div><p></p><figcaption>Watch: Erika's speech and other key moments</figcaption><p></p><p></p><h2>Trump's call to arms</h2><p></p><div><p>If Erika Kirk offered a glimpse of a possible kinder, gentler future for the conservative movement, Donald Trump, who spoke immediately after her, provided a quick reminder that the Republican Party of today may have very different priorities.</p><p>\"I hate my opponents, and I don't want what's best for them,\" Trump said with a chuckle. \"Now Erika can talk to me and the whole group and maybe they can convince me that's not right, but I can't stand my opponent.\"</p><p>Trump's remarks come just a day after a Truth Social Post in which the president demanded that his Justice Department prosecute his political enemies – including California Senator Adam Schiff, former FBI Director James Comey and New York Attorney General Letitia James.</p><ul><li><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/ckgee0x9p40o\">Trump hails Kirk as martyr at memorial service</a></li></ul><p>The president also announced that he had fired a federal prosecutor who had recently announced that there was not enough evidence to charge James with a crime, replacing him with one of his former defence attorneys.</p><p>Trump's remarks at the memorial service were jarring for the occasion, but he was not the only speaker to use the moment to promise action against \"enemies\".</p><p>\"We are the storm,\" said senior White House adviser Stephen Miller. \"Our enemies cannot comprehend our strength, our determination, our resolve, our passion.\"</p><p>He went on to say that conservatives would fight for Western culture and traditions and that their opponents have nothing but wickedness and jealousy.</p><p>\"You have no idea the dragon you have awakened,\" he said.</p></div><p></p><h2>Hints of a religious revival</h2><p></p><div><p>While the event had its discordant notes, the overall theme was akin to a religious revival – reminiscent of Billy Graham's tent crusades of the 1930 and 1940s or the \"great awakenings\" of the 19th Century.</p><p>The memorial service celebrated Charlie Kirk's Christianity and promised a new enthusiasm among young Americans for traditional values with an evangelical fervour.</p><p>Tens of thousands of supporters packed the stadium and millions more watched online. Those numbers are sure to be encouraging for conservative leaders who want to see Christianity play a more central role in American public and political life – a view that Kirk himself repeatedly expressed.</p><p>\"The body politic of America was so Christian and was so Protestant that our form and structure of government was built for the people that believed in Christ our Lord,\" Kirk said in 2024. \"You cannot have liberty if you do not have a Christian population.\"</p><p>While Christianity has declined in the US in recent years, it is still the majority faith. Most surveys show that younger Americans are less religious than their elders, however, indicating that further shifts could be in store.</p><p>Kirk's death may prompt a religious awakening among American youth. If it doesn't, however, Sunday night's evangelical rhetoric could exclude as much as it unites – further exacerbating cultural and political divides in the nation.</p></div><p></p><figcaption>Watch: Is America divided? Charlie Kirk supporters weigh in</figcaption><p></p><p></p><h2>Presidential ambitions on display</h2><p></p><div><p>We're only nine months into Trump's second term, but Sunday night also may have been an opening skirmish in the 2028 Republican presidential nomination contest.</p><p>Three potential contenders – Vice-President JD Vance, Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Health Secretary Robert F Kennedy Jr – had prominent speaking slots.</p><p>All three talked of the importance of their relationship with Kirk and their personal religion – providing more focused, traditional eulogies that contrasted sharply with Trump's speech. But there was still a forward-looking political edge to them.</p><p>\"For Charlie, we will rebuild this United States of America to greatness,\" Vance said. \"For Charlie, we will never shrink, we will never cower, and we will never falter, even when we are staring down the barrel of a gun.\"</p><p>Kennedy described of how Kirk \"changed the trajectory of history\" – and the risks of challenging \"entrenched interests\". Rubio praised Kirk for inspiring Americans to \"live a productive life, get married, start a family, love your country.\"</p><p>Trump, of course, was a prominent speaker at the rally, but the president of the United States was not the dominant force the way he often is at political events.</p><p>Conservatives on Sunday began to get a taste of those who might become key players on the national stage once Trump leaves the scene.</p></div><p></p><h2>An unexpected Musk reconciliation</h2><p></p><p></p><figcaption>Watch: Moment Trump and Musk shake hands at Charlie Kirk's memorial</figcaption><p></p><div><p>Speaking of key players, Sunday night saw the return of one of the most prominent figures in the early days of Trump's second term.</p><p>Tech multi-billionaire Elon Musk, who was a close confidante of Trump's before a dramatic public falling out in June, visited the president's box at the Phoenix event and had what appeared to be a friendly chat.</p><p>\"I thought it was nice,\" Trump told reporters afterwards. \"He came over; we had a conversation.\"</p><p>Musk, who headed Trump's \"Department of Government Efficiency\" earlier this year, oversaw sweeping federal layoffs and attempted budget cuts.</p><p>He broke with the president over a $3.4bn congressional spending bill, however, and later promised to start his own political party.</p><p>A Trump-Musk reconciliation was certainly not the most significant development from the memorial service, but it may be one of the most unexpected - and who knows where it may lead.</p></div></article>"
