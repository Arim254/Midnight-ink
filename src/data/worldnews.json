    "body": "<div><p>Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas has said he is ready to work with world leaders to implement a peace plan for Israel and the Palestinians announced by France on Monday.</p><p>Speaking via video at the UN General Assembly, Abbas reiterated his rejection of a future governing role for Hamas in Gaza and demanded it disarm.</p><p>He also called on countries which had not yet recognised a Palestinian state to do so, and for the UN to grant it full membership.</p><p>Abbas denounced Israel's military offensive in Gaza, accusing it of committing \"one of the most horrific humanitarian tragedies of the 20th and 21st Centuries\". But he said he \"rejected\" the actions of Hamas in its attack on Israel on 7 October 2023.</p></div><div><p>That attack, in which about 1,200 people - mostly civilians - were killed and 251 taken hostage, triggered the war in Gaza. At least 65,502 Palestinians, about half of them women and children, have been killed by Israeli military action in Gaza since then, according to Gaza's Hamas-run health ministry.</p><p>Abbas, 89, was barred from travelling to New York to appear in person when he and 80 other Palestinian officials had their visas revoked by the US state department last month.</p><p>US Secretary of State Marco Rubio blamed them for undermining peace efforts and for seeking \"the unilateral recognition of a conjectural Palestinian state\".</p><p>In his speech, Abbas thanked those countries which had recently recognised a Palestinian state in a wave of declarations which began with Canada, Australia, the UK and Portugal on Sunday.</p><p>France, Belgium, Luxembourg, Malta, Monaco, San Marino, Andorra, and Denmark followed. </p><p>The US is currently opposed to recognising Palestine, saying such a move is a reward for Hamas.</p><p>Abbas endorsed the peace plan announced by French President Emmanuel Macron at Monday's summit, which was co-chaired by Saudi Arabia.</p><p>The plan calls for the simultaneous release of the 48 remaining hostages held by Hamas with an end to Israeli military operations across Gaza. </p><p>That would be followed by a transitional administration - including Abbas's Palestinian Authority (PA) and excluding Hamas - to run Gaza, paving the way for a \"sovereign, independent, and demilitarised State of Palestine\".</p><p>Neither the US nor Israel have supported the plan. </p><p>Abbas though said he was \"read[y] to work with President Donald Trump, the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, France, the United Nations, and all partners to implement the peace plan... paving the way toward a just peace and comprehensive regional co-operation\".</p><p>He also called for a Palestinian state to assume \"full responsibilities\" for the Gaza Strip following an Israeli withdrawal and connect it with the Israeli-occupied West Bank. He said this would be done with Arab and international support. </p><p>Israel has previously rejected any future post-war role for the PA in Gaza.</p><p>The Palestinian president also said there would be \"national efforts toward reform, including holding presidential and parliamentary elections within one year of the war's end\". </p><p>\"We want a democratic, modern state committed to international law, rule of law, pluralism, peaceful transfer of power, and the empowerment of women and youth.\"</p><p>The last national Palestinian elections were held in 2006 and were won by Hamas.</p><p>The group violently ejected Abbas's Fatah faction - their political rivals - from Gaza the following year, leaving it in sole power there.</p></div>"

It is also the only entry point to the West Bank that does not go through Israel.</p></div><div><p>Most Palestinians in the West Bank are not allowed to travel through Israeli airports or other Israeli border crossings, meaning the bridge is an essential connection to the outside world.</p><p>\"You're talking here about disrupting the relationship between hundreds of thousands of families who are usually connected through Jordan,\" Barghouti said.</p><p>\"Thousands of people who are stuck in Jordan, they don't have resources to go and pay for hotels. They cannot stay outside. There are mothers who live with their children in the West Bank who need to come back,\" he added.</p><p>Jordan is home to more than 2m registered Palestinian refugees, while more than half of its population of more than 11m are of Palestinian descent.

That's what the MiG-21 was for me,\" he told me.</p><p>After six decades of admiration - and later, infamy - India's most iconic warplane is finally taking its last flight on Friday. At its peak, the MiG‚Äë21 was the backbone of the Indian Air Force (IAF), making up two-thirds of its fighter fleet. It inspired fierce loyalty among its pilots, yet also acquired the grim nickname \"flying coffin\" after a series of deadly crashes in its twilight years. </p><p>According to <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://rsdebate.nic.in/bitstream/123456789/602846/1/IQ_225_02052012_U2826_p77_p78.pdf?utm_source=chatgpt.com\">official figures</a>, between 1966 and 1980, India procured 872 MiG aircraft of various models.</p><p>Between 1971‚Äë72 and April 2012, 482 MiG crashes were recorded, claiming 171 pilots, 39 civilians, eight service personnel and one aircrew, \"caused by both human error and technical defects\". There is no official update of the data since.</p><p>\"The MiG-21 has a chequered legacy. The fighter was the mainstay of the IAF for over three decades and served in various roles in all of India's conflicts since the 1965 Pakistan war,\" says Rahul Bhatia, an analyst at Eurasia Group, a geopolitical risk consulting firm. \"However, starting in the early 2000s, the fighter became better known for its high crash rate. Pilots look back at the MiG-21 fondly, but the aircraft stayed in service far longer than it should have,\" he adds.</p><p>Designed by the Soviets and first inducted in 1963, the needle-nosed MiG-21 was razor-slim, blisteringly fast at altitude and could climb with ferocious speed. At its peak, the jet flew with more than 50 air forces - from the Soviet Union, China and India to Egypt, Iraq and Vietnam - making it one of the most widely operated supersonic jets in history.</p><p>In India, where the state-run Hindustan Aeronautics Limited (HAL) began license-building it in the mid-1960s, the MiG-21 became the cornerstone of IAF squadrons, prized for its versatility across multiple combat roles. </p></div><figure><div><p><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20250919-090805-05e5ba0164-web-2.30.1-2/grey-placeholder.png\" /><img srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/469c/live/33825660-9854-11f0-8d62-215a8506b20f.jpg.webp 240w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/469c/live/33825660-9854-11f0-8d62-215a8506b20f.jpg.webp 320w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/469c/live/33825660-9854-11f0-8d62-215a8506b20f.jpg.webp 480w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/469c/live/33825660-9854-11f0-8d62-215a8506b20f.jpg.webp 640w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/469c/live/33825660-9854-11f0-8d62-215a8506b20f.jpg.webp 800w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/469c/live/33825660-9854-11f0-8d62-215a8506b20f.jpg.webp 1024w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/469c/live/33825660-9854-11f0-8d62-215a8506b20f.jpg.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/469c/live/33825660-9854-11f0-8d62-215a8506b20f.jpg.webp\" alt=\"AFP via Getty Images Indian firefighters stand beside the wreckage of a MiG-21 military plane that caught fire before crashing, 15 July 2002, in Phansidawa near Siliguri in the state of West Bengal.\" /><span>AFP via Getty Images</span></p></div><p></p><figcaption>More than 480 MiG‚Äë21 crashes were recorded between 1971 and 2012</figcaption><p></p></figure><div><p>Inside the MiG‚Äë21 cockpit, pilots say, there was little comfort - just a single seat and the sky pressing in all around.</p><p>The air-conditioning - built for Russian winters - was barely adequate in scorching Indian summers. At low levels, cockpits often turned stifling and pilots could lose a kilo or more of body weight during a single sortie, remembers Air Marshal (retired) Vinod K Bhatia.</p><p>\"Most of the sorties I flew were around 30 minutes long, so the discomfort was bearable. In the end, however, it was all part of the game and still enjoyable,\" he told me.</p><p>Originally a high-altitude interceptor built for speed and short-range climbs to reach the enemy over short distances, the MiG‚Äë21 was quickly adapted by the IAF for close combat and ground attacks. </p><p>By the 1971 war with Pakistan, it had become a formidable multi-role fighter, though in 1965 war it was still new and mainly an interceptor. The MiG‚Äë21 also shaped India's defence ties with Russia and helped jump-start its own aerospace industry. </p><p>\"We adapted the aircraft to Indian conditions in a remarkable way. Though it had design limitations and wasn't built for close combat, we pushed it beyond what Russian test pilots and manuals taught, mastering close combat flying in a truly impressive manner,\" says Air Marshal Brar.</p><p>That adaptability came to define its role in the 1971 war. MiG-21s carried out low-level night strikes deep into Pakistani territory. A MiG-21 formation struck the governor's house in Dhaka, blasting rockets through its roof ventilators.</p><p>\"Each aircraft carried two 500kg bombs, and I flew three-to-four such missions.  Taking off from Amritsar, we were insidePakistan within 35 minutes, struck our targets 250km deep and raced back through Rajasthan - the shortest way out,\" says Air Marshal Brar.</p><p>Every fighter jet has its quirks and the MiG‚Äë21 was no exception - fast descents and even high-speed stalls were part of its character, according to Air Marshal Bhatia. \"Master it, respect it and it was a beautiful airplane to fly,\" he says.</p><p>For the pilots who flew it, the MiG‚Äë21's tarnished reputation in later years is undeserved. \"The media was very unkind to the aircraft,\" said one.  </p></div><figure><div><p><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20250919-090805-05e5ba0164-web-2.30.1-2/grey-placeholder.png\" /><img srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/e807/live/4c41a250-9854-11f0-8d62-215a8506b20f.jpg.webp 240w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/e807/live/4c41a250-9854-11f0-8d62-215a8506b20f.jpg.webp 320w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/e807/live/4c41a250-9854-11f0-8d62-215a8506b20f.jpg.webp 480w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/e807/live/4c41a250-9854-11f0-8d62-215a8506b20f.jpg.webp 640w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/e807/live/4c41a250-9854-11f0-8d62-215a8506b20f.jpg.webp 800w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/e807/live/4c41a250-9854-11f0-8d62-215a8506b20f.jpg.webp 1024w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/e807/live/4c41a250-9854-11f0-8d62-215a8506b20f.jpg.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/e807/live/4c41a250-9854-11f0-8d62-215a8506b20f.jpg.webp\" alt=\"AFP via Getty Images Indian Air Force of MIG 21FL fighter aircraft are seen in a 'Box' formation for the final time during a fly-past at the last ceremonial flight of the MIG 21 at a phasing out ceremony at Air Force Station Kalikunda (WB) near Kharagpur, some 110kms west of Kolkata on December 11, 2013.

Amazon tops the list of beneficiaries, with more than 10,000 H-1B visas approved in the first half of 2025.

For them, a six-figure fee per applicant could be crippling.</p><p>\"If you're a startup with new technology, and you've got some venture capital money but you're worried about burning through it too quickly, this could kill you,\" said John Skrentny, a professor at the University of California, San Diego who studies STEM workforce development.</p><p>\"What the Trump administration's plan doesn't seem to acknowledge is that not every company can spend $100,000 on a visa,\" he added.</p></div><div><p>Beyond the technology industry, organisations in industries such as education and healthcare, both of which employ foreign skilled workers through the H-1B programme, are also grappling with what the six-figure fee might mean.</p><p>\"There's no way that we can afford $100,000,\" said Karen Brady, the chief executive at Ryther, a behavioural health nonprofit based in Seattle. \"In terms of future hiring, we won't be doing any more H-1B visas.\"</p><p>The behavioural health sector has been grappling with a workforce shortage amid a spike in need since the pandemic, Ms Brady said. Hiring employees through the H-1B programme has helped address the crisis, she said.</p><p>Ryther, based in Seattle, currently employs two therapists on H-1B visas, out of 45 total, Ms Brady said, both of whom are from China.

I am truly grateful.\"</p></div><div><p>Between 1992 and now, anyone offering tattoos without medical credentials faced up to five years in prison or a fine of up to 50 million Korean won ($35,000; ¬£28,000).</p><p>There are no official statistics on how many tattooists have been prosecuted, but South Korea's Tattoo Union says it gives legal support to at least 50 each year, and believes there are many more that result in fines.</p><p>As of 2021, there were an estimated 350,000 tattoo artists in the country, according to the Ministry of Health and Welfare - most of whom specialised in semi-permanent make-up for lips, eyebrows or hairlines.</p><p>But relatively few of these have medical qualifications. Instead, most come from art or beauty backgrounds like elsewhere in the world.</p><p>By technically engaging in an illegal practice, tattoo artists in South Korea have been subjected to threats or reported by disgruntled clients.</p><p>A female tattoo artist who goes by the pseudonym Narr previously told the BBC that she had been sexually harassed by a man after tattooing him, but did not report the incident to the authorities for fear of being prosecuted.</p><p>Another, who goes by Banul, was reported to the police by a client who wanted five million Korean won ($3,500; ¬£2,800) after claiming without evidence that it had smudged.</p><p>But in recent years, South Korean courts have acquitted several tattoo artists, signalling a shift in attitudes.</p><p>Park Ju-min, chairman of the National Assembly's health and welfare committee and the law's main legislative proponent, noted that many politicians in the house had eyebrow or lip tattoos.</p><p>He said the passing of the law will allow \"citizens to get tattoos safely, and those engaged in the tattoo industry will be recognised as legal professionals\".</p><p>However, the change of law has faced opposition from South Korea's medical community.</p><p>Ahead of its passing, the Korean Medical Association said tattooing \"not only damages the skin but can also pose other health risks, including interference with cancer diagnosis\".</p><p>It stated that \"tattooing is fundamentally a medical procedure, and its growing popularity does not reduce the associated risks\".</p><p>There are also some in the industry who feel that, despite their popularity among young people and growing prominence in influencer culture, the change of law will not reverse the stigma towards tattoos. Recent opinion polls suggest a majority of South Koreans still view them negatively.</p><p>Though the tattooing prohibition will no longer be a permanent feature of South Korean society, removing it completely may be a slow and painful process.</p><p>The new law will only take effect in two years, with tattoo artists having to pass a national exam, complete safety and hygiene training, and keep detailed records.</p><p>Tattoo removals, done using a laser, will still be limited to medical professionals.</p></div>"

That we are too small to resist... But Moldova is our home. And our home is not for sale,\" the president said.</p><p>The BBC has recently uncovered evidence of a network with ties to Moscow and fugitive Moldovan businessman Ilan Shor which has been working to spread disinformation.</p><p><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c4g5kl0n5d2o\">An undercover reporter found people being paid to post fake content online, </a>intended to undermine the governing party ahead of the vote. The posts have had millions of views. Shor has not responded to a BBC request for comment.</p><p>Speaking at the UN's General Assembly in New York on Wednesday, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky warned that Europe could not afford to lose Moldova to Russian influence, after failing to save Georgia and Belarus from Moscow's orbit.</p><p>Zelensky said that Russian President Vladimir Putin - who launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022 - \"will keep driving the war forward wider and deeper\" if he was not stopped.</p><p>Meanwhile, Moldova's pro-Russian parties have accused Sandu of trying to intimidate them - and sway the vote.</p><p>They also say her government is not going far enough in tackling widespread corruption.</p><p>Russia's SVR foreign intelligence service this week accused European countries of plotting the \"blatant falsification\" of the result on Sunday in order to provoke protests.</p><p>The SVR warned that the EU could mount \"an armed incursion and de-facto occupation\" of Moldova, falsely claiming that the EU was deploying troops.</p><p>Moldova declared its independence as the USSR collapsed in 1991, but it has a significant Russian-speaking population. The breakaway region of Transnistria, propped up by Moscow, is still home to a contingent of Russian troops.</p></div>"

In legal terms, it determines whether probable cause exists to believe a crime has been committed.</p><p>Mr Comey is the first ex-FBI director to be indicted for a crime, and he maintains that he has not lied under oath.</p><p>If found guilty, he could face up to five years in prison.</p><p>A lawyer for Mr Comey, Patrick Fitzgerald, issued a short staying saying his client denied the charges, adding: \"We look forward to vindicating him in the courtroom.\"</p><p>Mr Comey said in a separate video statement: \"My family and I have known for years that there are costs to standing up to Donald Trump.\"</p><p>\"We will not live on our knees, and you shouldn't either,\" he continued, adding: \"And, I am innocent. So, let's have a trial.\"</p></div><figure><div><p><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20250919-090805-05e5ba0164-web-2.30.1-2/grey-placeholder.png\" /><img srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/267c/live/beb29810-9a72-11f0-85fc-9b9ff658e449.jpg.webp 240w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/267c/live/beb29810-9a72-11f0-85fc-9b9ff658e449.jpg.webp 320w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/267c/live/beb29810-9a72-11f0-85fc-9b9ff658e449.jpg.webp 480w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/267c/live/beb29810-9a72-11f0-85fc-9b9ff658e449.jpg.webp 640w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/267c/live/beb29810-9a72-11f0-85fc-9b9ff658e449.jpg.webp 800w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/267c/live/beb29810-9a72-11f0-85fc-9b9ff658e449.jpg.webp 1024w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/267c/live/beb29810-9a72-11f0-85fc-9b9ff658e449.jpg.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/267c/live/beb29810-9a72-11f0-85fc-9b9ff658e449.jpg.webp\" alt=\"Getty Images Former Federal Bureau of Investigation Director James Comey speaks to members of the media at the Rayburn House Office Building. \" /><span>Getty Images</span></p></div></figure><div><p>The charges were filed shortly before the five-year statute of limitations was set to expire on Tuesday.</p><p>The case had recently been handed over to a new prosecutor after Erik Seibert, the original US attorney overseeing the case, was fired by the Trump administration. He was replaced by Ms Halligan.</p><p>According to charging documents, Mr Comey made his alleged false statement to the Senate Judiciary Committee \"willfully and knowingly\", as Mr Comey had directed an unnamed person \"to serve as an anonymous source in news reports regarding an FBI investigation\".</p><p>This meant Mr Comey \"did corruptly endeavour to influence, obstruct and impede the due and proper exercise of the power of the inquiry\" of the committee on around 30 September 2020, the document states.</p><p>At that 2020 congressional hearing, Mr Comey reaffirmed his 2017 testimony that he did not disclose or approve the disclosure of information about FBI investigations into either Trump or his 2016 presidential rival Hillary Clinton.</p><p>A series of memos by Mr Comey detailing his conversations with Trump were disclosed to the media in 2017.</p><p>In them, Mr Comey wrote that Trump had suggested that he drop an investigation into then-national security adviser Michael Flynn's contact with Russia.</p></div><p></p><figcaption>Watch moments from James Comey's 2020 hearing at heart of indictment</figcaption><p></p><div><p>The case is considered to be the highest-profile indictments of a public figure during Trump's second term. </p><p>Trump recently voiced his frustration that prosecutions of his public critics such as Mr Comey, Senator Adam Schiff and New York Attorney General Leticia James are taking so long.</p><p>\"We can't delay any longer, it's killing our reputation and credibility. They impeached me twice, and indicted me (5 times!), OVER NOTHING. JUSTICE MUST BE SERVED, NOW!!!\" Trump said on Truth Social last week.</p><p>After charges were filed, Trump called Mr Comey \"one of the worst human beings this Country has ever been exposed to\".</p><p>\"He has been so bad for our Country, for so long, and is now at the beginning of being held responsible for his crimes against our Nation. MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!\"</p><p>Asked about Mr Comey hours before the indictment was unsealed, Trump called him a \"bad person\" but said he had no advanced knowledge of his prosecution.</p><p>Laurie Levenson, a former federal prosecutor and a law professor at Loyola Marymount University, said it will be a very challenging case to prosecute. </p><p>\"It's often the defendant's word against someone else's and you're gonna have to look at the credibility of both,\" she tells BBC News.</p><p>\"And even if James Comey got things wrong, that doesn't mean that he knowingly or intentionally lied to Congress. So proving that is going to be the heart of the case.\" </p><p>Ms Levenson also said this prosecution and Trump's public pressure to move forward on it suggests that the traditional firewall between the White House and the US Department of Justice had \"collapsed with this case\".</p></div><p></p><figcaption>Watch: James Comey is a \"bad person\", says Trump hours before indictment</figcaption><p></p><div><p>Several Democrats condemned the charges, with House Democratic Leader Hakeem Jeffries denouncing them as \"a disgraceful attack on the rule of law\", and vowing \"accountability\" for \"anyone complicit in this malignant corruption\".</p><p>Mr Comey served as the FBI's director between 2013 and 2017.</p><p>He had a tumultuous tenure that included overseeing the high-profile inquiry into Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton's email just weeks before the 2016 election, which she lost to Trump.</p><p>He was fired by Trump amid an investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election.</p><p>This is not the first investigation into the former FBI boss to be launched this year. </p><p>He was investigated by the Secret Service after he shared and then deleted a social media post of seashells spelled the numbers \"8647\", which Republicans alleged was an incitement to violence against US President Donald Trump.</p><p>The number 86 is a slang term whose definitions include \"to reject\" or \"to get rid of\", according to the Merriam-Webster dictionary, which also notes that it has more recently been used as a term meaning \"to kill\", while Trump is the 47th US president.</p><p>In July, Mr Comey's daughter Maurene Comey was fired from her role as a federal prosecutor in the Southern District of New York. She was given no reason for being removed from the office where she had worked for 10 years, according to media reports.</p><p>Earlier this month, she sued the Trump administration over her dismissal.</p><p>The Justice Department has been firing lawyers who worked on cases that angered the president, including a special prosecutor investigation of Trump.</p><p><i>Additional reporting by Sumi Somaskanda</i></p></div></article>"

About three-quarters of that water was suddenly released after the lake burst its banks on Tuesday, killing at least 14 people and injuring 32 others.

Officials had expected it would take the floodwater two hours to reach inhabited areas downstream and only people living near the river would be affected.</p><p>But within an hour, vast quantities of water were pouring into Guangfu Township, where 12,000 people live.</p><p>\"There were no special flooding warnings and no broadcast,\" an administrator of a high school in Guangfu told the BBC on condition of anonymity. The school was designated an evacuation centre, so he'd originally been tasked with helping evacuees.</p><p>He said he'd just finished lunch at around 15:00 when he heard the lake had burst its banks.</p><p>\"Within 10 minutes, water spread to the campus from the street. The 400-sq-mile sports ground was submerged,\" he said. Chairs, tables, refrigerators and even cars were soon floating.</p><p>\"If I'd still been on the street, I wouldn't have been able to reach higher ground. There were lots of objects floating in the water. I could have been hit or even electrocuted.\"</p><p>The administrator said officials might have underestimated Ragasa's impact - the lake had not breached its banks when a weaker typhoon hit last month.</p><p>Since last week, County Mayor Hsu Chen-wei had been on a trip to South Korea to promote tourism.
