But he did make comments in his withdrawal statement that appeared to be directed at Zohran Mamdani, the Democratic nominee and front-runner in the race.</p><p>\"Major change is welcome and necessary, but beware of those who claim the answer to destroy the very system we built together over generations,\" he said without naming Mamdani, a self-described socialist. \"That is not change, that is chaos.\"</p><p>Adams warned that \"insidious forces\" were pushing \"divisive agendas\" in city politics. </p><p>Once seen as a rising star in New York politics, the former police officer's popularity waned due to corruption allegations, tensions with Democrats over immigration, and frustration with the city's rising cost of living.</p><p>In an indictment last September, Adams was alleged to have accepted gifts totalling more than $100,000 (£75,000) from Turkish citizens in exchange for favours. He denied any wrongdoing and pleaded not guilty. </p><p>In April, the justice department ordered federal prosecutors in New York to drop the charges. But the controversy continued to haunt Adams as he trailed in the re-election race.</p><p>His relationship with the Democrats deteriorated during the Biden administration as he criticised its immigration strategy. </p><p>Earlier this year, he said he would run as an independent - a move that spared him from the competitive Democratic primary, which was won by Mamdani.</p><p>Adams will serve out the remainder of his term, which ends on 1 January.

All of them have been magnificent. I've enjoyed connecting with Latinos who have been living in the US.\"</p><p>He continued: \"But there was the issue of... ICE could be outside [my concerts]. And it's something that we were talking about and very concerned about.\"</p><p>His Super Bowl performance will take place at the Levi's Stadium in Santa Clara, in the San Francisco Bay Area.</p><p>Bad Bunny is also an actor, appearing in films like Bullet Train and the recent Happy Gilmore 2.</p><p>And he will return to host Saturday Night Live for a second time next month.</p></div>"

The most notorious was a compound known as Crouching Tiger Villa, where workers were routinely beaten and tortured. </p><p>Then, two years ago, an alliance of insurgent groups launched an offensive which drove the Myanmar military out of large areas of Shan State, and took control of Laukkai. China, which holds significant influence over these groups, was assumed to have given the offensive a green light. </p><p>Ming Xuechang, the family patriarch, reportedly killed himself; other family members were handed over to the Chinese authorities. Some have made remorseful confessions.</p><p>Thousands of those working in the scam centres have also been handed over to the Chinese police. </p><p>With these sentences China is signalling its determination to deal harshly with the scam business on its border. Pressure from Beijing also forced Thailand to take action against scam centres along its border with Myanmar earlier this year. </p><p>Despite this the business has adapted, with much of it now operating in Cambodia, though it is still prevalent in Myanmar.</p></div>"

It is also home to critically endangered black rhinos.</p><p>The country's environment ministry believes the fire broke out on Monday at a charcoal production site outside the park's borders.</p><p>Almost a week on, it has spread into the park killing at least nine antelope and destroying wildlife habitats, as well as hundreds of thousands of hectares of grazing pasture outside the park in regions bordering Angola.</p></div><div><p>\"Strong winds and dry vegetation\" were partly to blame for the rapid escalation of the blaze, officials say. </p><p>Opposition MP Likando Rodrick recently criticised the government for failing to contain the fire, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.namibian.com.na/etosha-fire-blamed-on-environment-ministry-being-unprepared/\">saying it should have been better prepared and urging it to beef up</a> its long-term response measures.</p><p>At an emergency meeting on Saturday, it was decided to send more than 500 troops to help firefighters, police, and volunteers on the ground, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://x.com/ngurare/status/1971999285521817643\">Prime Minister Tjitunga Elijah Ngurare said on X</a>.</p><p>Late on Sunday, the presidency said fires which had spread to grazing land in Oshikoto, Oshana and Kunene regions were now under control. But, it said, the full extent of destruction would not be clear until aerial photographs were complete.</p><p>\"The fire poses a significant threat to the biodiversity, wildlife and livelihood of the communities in the affected areas,\" the statement added, but \"thankfully, no human casualties have been reported\".</p><p>Covering a total of 22,935 sq km (8,855 sq miles), Etosha National Park is one of the largest in Africa. Some 200,000 tourists visit the nature reserve every year, according to the government.</p><p><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://embassyofnamibia.fr/perch/resources/pdf/etosha-national-park-fact-sheet-etosha.pdf\">It boasts a total of 114 mammal species</a> and attract hundreds of migratory birds including flamingos.</p><p>Experts say wildfires occur naturally in arid savannah <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/world-of-change/Etosha\">and believe occasional wildfires are a necessary part of keeping ecosystems healthy</a> - provided they are managed closely.</p><p>The fire poses a significant threat to the biodiversity, wildlife and livelihood of the communities in the affected areas. Approximately 30% of the grazing in the Park has been destroyed by the fire. Arial imagery will be undertaken to determine the extent of the spread of the fire and the area destroyed.</p></div>"

The accused is innocent until proved beyond reasonable doubt,\" he said.</p><p>The charges have sparked fears of renewed conflict in the country, with the UN, African Union and neighbouring countries all calling for calm in the world's newest country, which only gained independence from Sudan in 2011 following decades of war.</p></div>"

Matters ranging from criminal trials to property and family disputes have been pending here for decades, leaving thousands of people in India's most populous state, Uttar Pradesh, trapped in legal limbo.</p><p>Consider Babu Ram Rajput, 73, a retired government employee who has been battling a property dispute for over three decades. </p><p>He bought land at an auction in 1992, but the previous owner challenged the sale - and the case remains unresolved to this day.</p><p>\"I just hope my case is decided while I'm still alive,\" Mr Rajput says.</p><p>The high court's struggle mirrors a broader crisis in India's judiciary, where too few judges and a constant flood of cases have caused crippling delays.</p><p>With a sanctioned strength of 160 that experts say has never been completely filled, the court is severely understaffed. Delays in police investigations, frequent adjournments, and poor infrastructure further <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://indiajusticereport.org/files/IJR%204_Full%20Report_English_Low.pdf\">add to the backlog</a>, leaving the system stretched beyond capacity.</p><p>Each judge faces hundreds of cases a day - sometimes over 1,000.

By the verdict's delivery, four of the five convicted men had died. Ordering the sole surviving convict to surrender, the court admitted it regretted not ruling sooner.</p><p>The backlog has even prompted legal action. Earlier this year, a group of Allahabad High Court lawyers petitioned for more judicial appointments, calling the court \"paralysed\" by a shortage of judges that leaves cases lingering for years.</p><p>The crisis has caught the attention of India's top court. In January, the Supreme Court called it \"worrisome\" that case listings at the Allahabad High Court are unpredictable, saying the system had completely collapsed.</p><p>Uncertain hearing dates hit people hard, especially in vast Uttar Pradesh. Many travel hundreds of kilometres to Prayagraj where the court is located on just a few days' notice for their hearing.</p><p>Mr Rajput is from Kanpur, 200km (125 miles) from Prayagraj. He spends around four hours travelling each time his case is listed - yet can never be sure it will actually be heard.</p><p>\"I'm over 70,\" he says. \"I often learn just days in advance that my case is listed, making travel a hassle.\" He adds that many times his case isn't heard because other matters take up the whole day. </p></div><figure><div><p><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20250919-090805-05e5ba0164-web-2.30.1-2/grey-placeholder.png\" /><img srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/9275/live/15634d90-9a86-11f0-a64c-235ee04911fb.jpg.webp 240w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/9275/live/15634d90-9a86-11f0-a64c-235ee04911fb.jpg.webp 320w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/9275/live/15634d90-9a86-11f0-a64c-235ee04911fb.jpg.webp 480w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/9275/live/15634d90-9a86-11f0-a64c-235ee04911fb.jpg.webp 640w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/9275/live/15634d90-9a86-11f0-a64c-235ee04911fb.jpg.webp 800w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/9275/live/15634d90-9a86-11f0-a64c-235ee04911fb.jpg.webp 1024w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/9275/live/15634d90-9a86-11f0-a64c-235ee04911fb.jpg.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/9275/live/15634d90-9a86-11f0-a64c-235ee04911fb.jpg.webp\" alt=\"Umang Poddar/BBC A man binds case files outside the Allahabad high court \" /><span>Umang Poddar/BBC</span></p></div><p></p><figcaption>A man preparing court files outside the Allahabad High Court</figcaption><p></p></figure><div><p>Lawyers have long urged the court to set up another bench - a branch of the high court in a different city to ease access and speed up hearings - in the western part of the state. Currently, an additional bench exists in the city of Lucknow. A similar recommendation was made in 1985 by a government commission, but it has yet to be implemented.</p><p>Earlier this year, the state government reportedly <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/meerut/lawyers-attempt-to-establish-wup-hc-bench-fails-again-causing-gloom/articleshow/107196913.cms\">urged the high court</a> to set up another bench, but the letter was later withdrawn for unknown reasons. The push for more benches isn't limited to Uttar Pradesh; a 2009 Law Commission report said all states would benefit from additional high court branches.</p><p>While new benches could help long-term, experts say quicker fixes - like appointing more judges - are needed. </p><p>But the process is slow and complex: senior high court judges first shortlist candidates, then the list is reviewed by the state and federal governments, and the Chief Justice of India. After this, senior Supreme Court judges forward the final list to the federal government for appointment.</p><p>Experts say picking the right candidates is often challenging. Former Allahabad High Court Chief Justice Govind Mathur notes that chief justices, often appointed from outside the state, may not know local lawyers or judges, complicating recommendations. Names can be rejected at any stage and remain confidential until the Supreme Court forwards them to the government.</p><p>Last year, the Supreme Court <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://cdnbbsr.s3waas.gov.in/s3ec0490f1f4972d133619a60c30f3559e/uploads/2025/05/2025051927.pdf\">recommended just one appointment </a>for the Allahabad High Court, despite nearly half the seats being vacant. Some progress came this year, after 40 new judges were added - 24 of whom were appointed last week - but the backlog persists.</p><p>Experts say the backlog is so huge that even at full strength, each judge would handle over 7,000 pending cases. </p><p>Mr Mathur says that deeper judicial reforms - like a \"uniform policy for hearing and disposing of cases\" - are essential, rather than leaving it to individual judges.</p></div></article>"

Our communities are safe and calm,\" said Oregon Governor Tina Kotek on Saturday. </p><ul><li><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c0q74pxx871o\">Trump promised retribution - how far will he go?</a></li></ul></div><div><p>The Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) facility in Portland has been targeted by protesters since early June, sometimes leading to violent clashes.</p><p>As of 8 September, the US Attorney's Office had brought federal charges against 26 people for crimes including arson, assaulting a police officer and resisting arrest.</p><p>The DHS said on Friday that demonstrators had \"repeatedly attacked and laid siege to an ICE processing centre\" in Portland.</p><p>The department stated that several individuals had been arrested and charged with federal offences in a post on social media.</p><p>\"Rose City Antifa, a recently designated domestic terrorist organisation, illegally doxed ICE officers,\" it wrote. </p><p>\"They published their home address online and on public flyers. Individuals associated with Antifa also sent death threats to DHS personnel.\"</p><p>Rose City Antifa has said it was not responsible for the flyers.</p><ul><li><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c4gj489q6e0o\">Inside Chicago's split communities as Trump vows to deploy troops</a></li><li><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c5ylyd9lkkqo\">Trump's use of National Guard in Los Angeles was illegal, judge rules</a></li></ul><p>Earlier this week, Trump signed an order formally designating Antifa as a domestic terrorist organisation.</p><p>Antifa, short for \"anti-fascist\", is a loosely organised movement of primarily far-left activists.</p><p><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/ced5gqn0p6jo\">Legal experts have pointed out</a> that there is no legal mechanism in the US that would formally establish any group as a domestic terror organisation. Such efforts, they said, could face constitutional challenges under the First Amendment, which protects free speech and assembly.</p><p>Democratic lawmakers have criticised both the president's rhetoric and the reported actions of ICE agents in the state.</p><p>Oregon Senator Ron Wyden said on Friday that there were \"credible\" reports that federal agents \"may be replaying the 2020 playbook\" - a reference to federal forces being deployed in response to protests over the murder of George Floyd, a black man who died in police custody.</p><p>\"I urge Oregonians not to fall into Trump's attempt to incite violence,\" Wyden said.</p><p>Local lawmakers have also accused ICE of going after people who are not an actual danger to society.</p><p>\"ICE has said they're targeting people for arrest and detainment who have committed crimes. That's what they told us. But that's not what we are seeing,\" said Democratic house representative Suzanne Bonamici.</p><p>Lawmakers cited recent incidents, including the detention of a father outside his child's preschool and a wildland firefighter who was arrested while battling fires in the Olympic National Forest.</p><p>They also pointed to a statistic published by the Cato Institute, a US think tank based in Washington DC, which reported <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cato.org/blog/65-people-taken-ice-had-no-convictions-93-no-violent-convictions\">that 65% of people detained by ICE had no criminal convictions</a>. </p></div><p></p><figcaption>Watch: National Guard arrives in Washington DC in August</figcaption><p></p><div><p>Despite the backlash from Democrats, the move has drawn support from some Republican officials.</p><p>US Labour Secretary Lori Chavez-DeRemer said she had seen how \"lawlessness\" had turned Portland into a \"crime-ridden warzone\".</p><p>Chavez-DeRemer, who previously served as a Republican house representative for Oregon, thanked Trump \"for taking action to keep our ICE facilities protected and Make America Great Again\".</p><p>Earlier this year, Trump deployed the National Guard to Los Angeles and Washington DC. Federal agents are expected to arrive in Memphis in Tennessee next week.</p><p>In Los Angeles, the president ordered 2,000 federal personnel to deal with unrest over raids on undocumented migrants. Clashes erupted over several days, and tear gas was used to disperse protesting crowds.</p><p>A federal judge in California ruled earlier this month that the National Guard deployment in Los Angeles was illegal, and that it violated the Posse Comitatus Act, which limits the power of the federal government to use military force for domestic matters.</p><p>It is unclear whether the president has legal ground to deploy federal forces to Oregon. </p></div></article>"
