    "body": "<div><div><p>5 hours ago</p></div><p><span><p><span>Imogen Foulkes</span><span>Geneva correspondent</span></p></span></p></div><div><p>Swiss voters have narrowly approved a plan to introduce voluntary electronic identity cards. </p><p>With all votes counted, 50.4% of those who voted said yes to the proposal, while 49.6% rejected it.</p><p>The closeness of the ballot is a surprise. Opinion polls had suggested up to 60% backed digital IDs, which also had the approval of the Swiss government, and both houses of parliament. </p><p>It was Switzerland's second vote on digital IDs. An earlier proposal was rejected in 2021, amid concerns the data would be held centrally, and controlled largely by private providers. </p></div><div><p>Sunday's revised proposal keeps the system in government hands.  Data will be stored only on the smartphones of individual users, and digital IDs will be optional. </p><p>Citizens can continue to use national identity card if they choose, which has been standard for decades in Switzerland.</p><p>To further ease privacy concerns, a particular authority seeking information on a person – such as proof of age or nationality, for example – will only be able to check for those specific details.</p><p>It comes after the UK government announced plans earlier this week to introduce its own digital ID - which would be mandatory for employment - as part of efforts to curb the number of illegal migrants living and working in the country.</p><p>The proposed British digital ID would have fewer intended uses than the Swiss version, but has still raised concerns about privacy and data security. </p><p>Supporters of the Swiss system say it will make life much easier for everyone, allowing a range of bureaucratic procedures - from getting a telephone contract to proving you are old enough to buy a bottle of wine - to happen quickly online.</p><p>Opponents of digital ID cards, who gathered enough signatures to force another referendum on the issue, argue that the measure could still undermine individual privacy.</p><p>They also fear that, despite the new restrictions on how data is collected and stored, it could still be used to track people and for marketing purposes.</p><p>Switzerland has a long tradition of protecting its citizens' privacy. The banking secrecy laws, now much diluted, were designed to shield an individual's personal finances from the prying eyes of the state.</p><p>For years, Google Street View was controversial in Switzerland - and even today, following a ruling by the Swiss Federal Court, images taken close to schools, women's refuges, hospitals or prisons must be automatically blurred before going online.</p></div>"

Israel claims it is attempting to stop those supplies falling into the hands of Hamas, and has approved a US-backed aid agency.</p><p>Last month, a UN-backed body confirmed that there was famine in Gaza and the UN's humanitarian chief said it was the direct result of Israel's \"systematic obstruction\" of aid entering the territory. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has called this an \"outright lie\".</p><p>Thunberg said the purpose of the flotilla was to \"break Israel's illegal and inhumane siege on Gaza by sea\". The Israeli military has long controlled the waters that border Gaza.</p><p>Earlier this month, the flotilla organisers reported that <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cly67g7pdlko\">two vessels came under attack by suspected drones</a> outside the Tunisian port of Sidi Bou Said. Tunisian authorities disputed their claims. </p><p>Another suspected drone attack on Wednesday, off the coast of Crete, led Spain and Italy to <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/ce3yz939qnpo\">deploy naval ships to assist the flotilla</a>.</p><p>Addressing the incidents, Thunberg accused Israeli officials of making \"baseless threats\" that violate international law, and asked: \"Why would they attack a peaceful humanitarian mission aiming to bring humanitarian aid to a starving population?\"</p><p>Israel has not commented on the drone attack, but has previously said it would not let the flotilla reach its destination.</p><p>Thunberg and 11 other activists were detained by Israeli authorities in June after they intercepted another boat heading for Gaza with a token amount of aid in the Mediterranean.</p><p>She was held in Tel Aviv for a day before being deported to France. </p><p>Thunberg accused Israel of illegally kidnapping her and the other activists while they were in international waters. Israel said it had prevented a breach of the maritime blockade around Gaza.</p></div>"

But hundreds of thousands more remain there in dire humanitarian conditions, with health and other essential services collapsing.</p><p>\"They tell us go there, then come back here... People are in the streets, in the south scattered everywhere. Where should we go?\" said Salwa Subhi Bakr, as quoted by AFP.</p><p>\"What does the world want from us? What does Netanyahu want? What does Hamas want?\" she said.</p><p>Several members of the Bakr family were killed during a strike on Al-Shati refugee camp in Gaza City, the news agency reported, citing the Hamas-run civil defence agency.</p><p>While international calls for a ceasefire have redoubled - bolstered by <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cd9ykqw22zlo\">multiple new recognitions of Palestinian statehood</a> at the UN this week - Israel remains intent on maintaining maximum pressure on Hamas to try to force it into surrender.</p><p>That was the message once again from <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cderxxylpzdo\">Prime Minister Netanyahu at the UN General Assembly in New York</a> on Friday, where many delegates walked out in protest as he took to the stage.</p></div><div><p><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c3e7d32epk3o\">Donald Trump has once again expressed optimism</a> about negotiating a deal that would see the hostages released and a new ceasefire in Gaza. </p><p>The US president said his team was close to achieving this goal, as what he called \"very inspired and productive discussions\" were being held with countries across the region.</p><p>Trump's special envoy to the Middle East, Steve Witkoff, says that the US has come up with a new 21-point peace plan for the Middle East and Gaza.</p><p>It has not been formally presented, but various media reports have laid out what is said to be its key provisions.</p><p>These reportedly go beyond the release of all hostages, large numbers of Palestinian prisoners and an immediate ceasefire, to include what The Times of Israel says would be a pathway to a future Palestinian state. </p><p>But that is something Netanyahu strongly rejected in his address to the UN.</p><p>It has also been reported that the plan would enable Palestinians to remain in the Gaza Strip, rather than encourage many to leave.</p><p>Such provisions - if they are confirmed - are certain to be talking points when Trump meets Netanyahu on Monday. The US leader's optimism may receive a reality check at that meeting.</p><p>The Times of Israel - which says it had seen a copy of the US proposal - says that it also includes  a commitment for Hamas to disarm, as well as the full demilitarisation of Gaza and the establishment of a process to de-radicalise the population. </p><p>It is clear that both Hamas and the Israeli government would have to make greater concessions than they have so far committed themselves to, if the plan as it has been reported so far is to have any chance of success.</p><p>The Israeli military launched a campaign in Gaza in response to the Hamas-led attack on southern Israel on 7 October 2023, in which about 1,200 people were killed and 251 others were taken hostage.</p><p>At least 65,549 people have been killed in Israeli attacks in Gaza since then, according to the territory's Hamas-run health ministry.</p><p>Foreign journalists have been banned from entering Gaza independently since Israel launched its 2023 offensive following the Hamas 7 October attacks.</p><p>With the two-year anniversary of the Hamas-led attack on Israel just over a week away, there are many in Israel and Gaza who will be fervently hoping that that they will not have to live through a third year of the war.</p></div>"
