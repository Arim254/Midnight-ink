The banking secrecy laws, now much diluted, were designed to shield an individual's personal finances from the prying eyes of the state.</p><p>For years, Google Street View was controversial in Switzerland, and even today, following a ruling by the Swiss Federal Court, images taken close to schools, women's refuges, hospitals or prisons must be automatically blurred before going online. </p><p>There are also far fewer CCTV cameras in Switzerland than in many of its European neighbours.</p><p>Opponents of electronic ID cards, who gathered enough signatures to force another referendum on the issue, argue that this measure too could undermine individual privacy. </p><p>They also fear that, despite the new restrictions on how data is collected and stored, it could still be used to track people, and for marketing purposes.</p><p>Latest opinion polls, however, show voters may this time be ready to give electronic ID a chance. </p><p>They have already had experience of the government's Covid ID, which was used during the pandemic to show vaccination status and was mandatory to enter restaurants and bars. </p><p>Initial scepticism turned to satisfaction, when people realised it allowed them, finally, to get out and about again.</p><p>As for the concerns about marketing of personal data, most Swiss have smartphones and are keen users of social media. </p><p>The tech giants are already harvesting their likes and dislikes, many voters realise, so believe that allowing the Swiss authorities to check on a few details from time to time can't really make a big difference.</p></div>"

It empowered a high commissioner to behave like a dictator [and] Palestinian people bore the brunt,\" he said.</p><p>\"Recognition alone does not deal with all these historic problems which for Palestinians are not history but the living reality to this day,\" said Prof Kattan, an expert in public international law at the University of Nottingham.</p><p>The Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office (FCDO) would not confirm whether ministers had been made aware of the legal petition saying it did not \"routinely comment on\" them, although the BBC understands that Deputy Prime Minister and former Foreign Secretary David Lammy is to ask officials to look into the submission.</p><p>It documents three decades of alleged abuses by UK forces during mounting violence until 1948, after which the UK rapidly withdrew and the State of Israel was declared.</p><p>The alleged abuses by British forces range from murder, torture, expulsion and collective punishment which the submission says repressed the Arab Palestinian population amounting to war crimes and crimes against humanity.</p><p><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-63145992\">In 2022, a BBC review of some of the historical evidence involved found details of arbitrary killings,</a> arson of entire villages, \"caging\" of civilians in the open air, the use of human shields by strapping them to the front of military vehicles and the introduction of home demolitions as collective punishment. </p><p>The evidence included audio recordings made decades later in which British soldiers and police officers described abuses. Some were conducted within formal policy guidelines for UK forces at the time or with the consent of senior officers.</p><p>The UK Ministry of Defence said in 2022 it was aware of historical allegations against armed forces personnel during the period, and any evidence provided would be \"reviewed thoroughly\".</p><p>During World War One, Britain invaded Palestine, driving out the Ottoman Turks, and it facilitated its promise for a Jewish homeland made in the 1917 Balfour Declaration. </p><p>In the decades that followed, violence mounted between Arabs and Jews. </p><p>An insurgency known as the Arab Revolt broke out against British rule from 1936 until 1939. It was brutally suppressed by the British leaving about 10% of the adult male Arab Palestinian population killed, wounded, imprisoned or exiled, according to one estimate.</p><p>The Palestinian petitioners seek to build on previous concessions made by the UK over colonial-era war crimes, including this year's apology for the 1948 Batang Kali massacre in Malaya and the settlement over abuses of Kenyans during the Mau Mau uprising of the 1950s.</p><p>The decision by the UK, France and several other countries to recognise a Palestinian state saw them join more than 150 nations that already do so. </p><p>The move was welcomed by Palestinians - but rejected by Israel and the US, which argued it damaged efforts to mediate a ceasefire in the war in the Gaza Strip.</p></div>"

Prostitution is illegal in Dubai.</p><p>At least one of Mwesigwa's clients regularly asked to defecate on the women, according to \"Mia\", whose name we have changed to protect her identity, and who said she was trapped by Mwesigwa's network.</p><p>Mwesigwa has denied all the allegations made in the BBC's investigation. He said he helped women find accommodation through landlords, and added that women followed him to parties because of his wealthy Dubai contacts.</p><p>\"I told you I am just a party person who invites big spenders on my tables, hence making many girls flock [to] my table. That makes me know many girls and that's it,\" he said.</p><p>The investigation by the BBC also found that two women linked to Mwesigwa, Monic Karungi and Kayla Birungi, died after falling from high-rise apartments. </p></div><div><p>Although their deaths were ruled as suicides, their friends and family feel the police should have investigated further.</p><p>Mwesigwa said the incidents were investigated by the Dubai police and asked us to contact them for information. They did not reply to the BBC's request.</p><p>Numerous discussions about the investigation took place in the Ugandan parliament last week, with ministers calling it \"disturbing\" and pledging to work with Interpol to ensure justice. </p><p><i>Additional reporting by Jack Burgess</i></p><ul><li>If you have any information to add to this investigation please contact runako@bbc.co.uk</li><li>Details of organisations offering information about or support after sexual abuse or with feelings of despair are available at <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/actionline\">bbc.co.uk/actionline</a>.</li></ul></div>"

The conservative Christian Democrats had long been expected to lend their support, but several members of former Prime Minister Igor Matovic's Slovakia movement added their votes at the last minute, tipping the scales.</p><p>Matovic described them as traitors.</p><p>The populist-nationalist government argued the amendment was necessary to protect what it described as \"traditional values\".</p><p>Fico praised the vote and said his party would have a shot of liquor to celebrate their success. \"This isn't a little dam, or just a regular dam - this is a great dam against progressivism,\" he declared.</p><p>He had previously argued that what he called liberal ideology was \"spreading like cancer\".</p></div><div><p>Slovak legal scholars say a constitutional amendment enshrining the primacy of the Slovak constitution over EU law is a direct challenge to the European Union, and will lead to legal battles and potentially sanctions.</p><p>Some said the move was merely a ploy by Fico to distract attention from falling poll ratings and unpopular policies.</p><p>\"The Slovak constitution has fallen victim to Robert Fico's plan to dismantle the opposition and divert attention from the real problems of society, as well as the austerity measures he had to pass,\" Beata Balagova, editor-in-chief of Slovak daily SME, told the BBC.</p><p>\"Fico does not genuinely care about gender issues, the ban on surrogate motherhood, or even adoptions by LGBTQ people,\" she added.</p><p>Most opposition MPs stayed away from parliament and Progressive Slovakia, which is leading the polls, said the betrayal marked the end of any potential co-operation with Matovic and his party.</p><p>President Peter Pellegrini said he would sign the amendment.</p><p>\"At a time of enormous division within Slovak society, a constitutional majority is an important signal that there is agreement on a specific issue across the political spectrum, and it must be respected,\" he said following the vote.</p><p>Fico's Smer-Social Democracy party has now strayed so far from the progressive values espoused by Europe's centre-left mainstream that reports say it will be formally expelled from the Party of European Socialists (PES) at a conference next month.</p><p>Smer was suspended in 2023 after forming a coalition with the far-right Slovak National Party.</p><p>Since then, Fico has angered European allies by meeting Putin four times in less than 12 months.</p><p>Smer has not commented on the reports.</p></div>"
