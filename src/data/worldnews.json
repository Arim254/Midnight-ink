The court found Gueant guilty of corruption, among other charges, and Hortefeux was found guilty of criminal conspiracy.</p><p>Sarkozy's wife, Italian-born former supermodel and singer Carla Bruni-Sarkozy, was <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cd1xv3xewdno\">charged last year with hiding evidence linked to the Gaddafi case</a> and associating with wrongdoers to commit fraud, both of which she denies.</p><p>Since losing his re-election bid in 2012, Sarkozy has been targeted by several criminal investigations.</p><p>He also appealed against a February 2024 ruling which found him <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-68293760\">guilty of overspending on his 2012 re-election campaign</a>, then hiring a PR firm to cover it up. He was handed a one-year sentence, of which six months were suspended.</p><p>In 2021, he was found guilty of trying to bribe a judge in 2014 and became the first former French president to get a custodial sentence. In December, the Paris appeals court ruled that he could serve his time at home wearing a tag instead of going to jail.</p></div>"

Musk has previously been quoted as saying that Epstein had invited him to the island but he had declined.</p><p>The partial records are from the third batch of documents produced by the Jeffrey Epstein Estate. Democrats on the House Oversight Committee say they include phone message logs, copies of flight logs and manifests for aircrafts, copies of financial ledgers and Epstein's daily schedule.</p><p>In addition to Musk and Prince Andrew, the files released publicly also contain the names of other prominent figures including internet entrepreneur Peter Thiel and Steve Bannon, a former advisor to Donald Trump</p><p>One line in the records dated 6 December 2014 reads: \"Reminder: Elon Musk to island Dec. 6 (is this still happening?)\"</p><p>A flight manifest records that Prince Andrew was on a flight with Epstein and his associate Ghislaine Maxwell from Teterboro, New Jersey, to West Palm Beach, Florida, on 12 May 2000.

Prostitution is illegal in Dubai.</p><p>At least one of Mwesigwa's clients regularly asked to defecate on the women, according to \"Mia\", whose name we have changed to protect her identity, and who said she was trapped by Mwesigwa's network.</p><p>Mwesigwa has denied all the allegations made in the BBC's investigation. He said he helped women find accommodation through landlords, and added that women followed him to parties because of his wealthy Dubai contacts.</p><p>\"I told you I am just a party person who invites big spenders on my tables, hence making many girls flock [to] my table. That makes me know many girls and that's it,\" he said.</p><p>The investigation by the BBC also found that two women linked to Mwesigwa, Monic Karungi and Kayla Birungi, died after falling from high-rise apartments. </p></div><div><p>Although their deaths were ruled as suicides, their friends and family feel the police should have investigated further.</p><p>Mwesigwa said the incidents were investigated by the Dubai police and asked us to contact them for information.

Outside, protesters against Israel's war in Gaza gathered in Times Square.</p><p>Israel has come under huge international pressure over its military action in Gaza, culminating in the UK, France, Canada, Australia and other countries <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/ce800enrglzo\">recognising the State of Palestine</a> this week.</p></div><div><p>In his opening remarks, Netanyahu displayed a map labelled \"The Curse\"<b> </b>that he said showed Iranian proxy groups across the Middle East. He then highlighted Israeli military operations across the past year against Hezbollah in Lebanon, the Houthis in Yemen, Hamas in Gaza, and Iran.</p><p>He thanked US President Donald Trump for American involvement in bombing Iran's Fordo nuclear site in June, and drew parallels between Hamas's 7 October 2023 attack on Israel and the 9/11 attack on the US. He said the two countries were fighting the same enemies, pointing to chants of \"death to America\" by groups linked to Iran. </p></div><div><p>The Israeli prime minister repeated that Israel would not allow a Palestinian state to exist and said this position was supported by the vast majority of Israelis. </p><p>He went on to refute the conclusion of a UN commission of inquiry that<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c8641wv0n4go\"> Israel had committed genocide in Gaza</a>, claiming the charge was \"baseless\". </p><p>He also rejected statements by multiple UN agencies that Israel is deliberately restricting the amount of aid entering Gaza. In August, a <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/ckg4p90z1kxo\">UN-backed body confirmed that famine</a> was taking place in Gaza City.</p><p>Ahead of his speech, Netanyahu's office ordered that the Israeli military mount loudspeakers on trucks near the Gaza perimeter fence in order to broadcast his words live across the territory.</p><p>Netanyahu also claimed that Israeli intelligence had hacked the smartphones of people in Gaza and would stream his speech to them directly. BBC sources in Gaza said their phones had not been affected.</p><p>He said the intention of this was for a message to reach Israeli hostages there.</p><p>\"Our brave heroes,\" he read on the podium. \"This is Prime Minister Netanyahu speaking to you live from the United Nations. We have not forgotten you, not even for a second. The people of Israel are with you. We will not falter, and we will not rest until we bring all of you home.\"</p><p>There are 48 hostages remaining in Gaza, 20 of whom are thought to be alive.</p><p>Gaza resident Fadi told the BBC World Service's OS programme: \"What does he gain by broadcasting his speech forcibly to the besieged civilians inside the tents, except to further humiliate them?\" </p><p>Netanyahu devoted the latter section of his address to Israel's regional neighbours, saying it was close to a de-escalation agreement with Syria and calling on the Lebanese government to step-up its efforts to disarm Hezbollah.</p><p>He immediately came under fire within Israel, with opposition leader Yair Lapid writing: \"Today saw a weary and whining Israeli prime minister, in a speech overloaded with overused gimmicks\"</p><p>\"Instead of stopping the diplomatic tsunami - Netanyahu today worsened the state of the State of Israel,\" he wrote on X.</p><p>Yair Golan, leader of Israel's Democrats party said the speech showed \"only victimhood, sanctimoniousness, and complete blindness to the suffering of the hostages and the sacrifice of the fighters\". </p><p>He labelled the loudspeaker stunt \"invalid, childish, and insane\", saying it was \"propaganda show\". </p><p>A day earlier, Palestinian Authority leader Mahmoud Abbas said in his speech to the General Assembly that he is ready to work with world leaders to <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/czdjgdnjnlgo\">implement a peace plan</a> for Israel and the Palestinians. </p><p>Shortly after Netanyahu finished speaking, Donald Trump separately told journalists: \"I think we have a deal on Gaza\". He did not provide further details, though speculation has been mounting that a ceasefire deal could be close.</p><p>International journalists have been banned by Israel from entering the Gaza Strip independently since the start of the war nearly two years ago, making verifying claims from both sides difficult. Some journalists have been taken into Gaza by the IDF under controlled access.</p><p>The Israeli military launched a campaign in Gaza in response to the Hamas-led attack on southern Israel on 7 October 2023, in which about 1,200 people were killed and 251 others were taken hostage.</p><p>At least 65,549 people have been killed in Israeli attacks in Gaza since then, according to the territory's Hamas-run health ministry. </p></div>"

It would seek a UN mandate to be Gaza's \"supreme political and legal authority\" for five years.</p><p>The plan would be modelled on the international administrations that oversaw East Timor and Kosovo's transitions to statehood. It would initially be based in Egypt, near Gaza's southern border, before entering Gaza once the Strip is stable, alongside a multinational force. </p><p>As PM, Blair took the decision to commit British forces to the 2003 Iraq War that was heavily criticised in the official inquiry into the conflict, which found he had acted on flawed intelligence without certainty about the production of weapons of mass destruction there.</p><p>After leaving office in 2007, Blair served as Middle East envoy for the Quartet of international powers (the US, EU, Russia and the UN). He focused on bringing economic development to Palestine and creating the conditions for a two state-solution.</p><p>Reports of discussions about his involvement in a transitional authority for Gaza come after Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas said on Thursday that he was ready to work with Trump and other world leaders to implement a two-state peace plan.</p><p>Abbas stressed his rejection of a future governing role for Hamas in Gaza and demanded it disarm.</p><p>Throughout the conflict, varying proposals for the future of Gaza have been tabled by multiple parties. </p><p>In February, Donald Trump floated plans - which since appear to have been dropped - for the US to take \"a long-term ownership position\" over Gaza, saying it could be the \"Riviera of the Middle East\". </p><p>The idea would have involved the forced displacement of Palestinians in the territory and be in violation of international law. The US and Israel said it would involve \"voluntary\" emigration.</p><p>In March, the US and Israel rejected an Arab plan for the post-war reconstruction of the Gaza Strip that would allow the 2.1 million Palestinians living there to stay in place. The Palestinian Authority and Hamas welcomed the Arab plan, which called for Gaza to be governed temporarily by a committee of independent experts and for international peacekeepers to be deployed there.</p><p>In July, a French and Saudi-led international conference in New York proposed a  \"transitional administrative committee\" for Gaza which would operate \"under the umbrella of the Palestinian Authority\". Neither the US nor Israel attended. The so-called New York Declaration was backed by a majority of the UN General Assembly in a resolution earlier this month.</p><p>Earlier this week, the UK formally recognised the State of Palestine, alongside France, Canada, Australia, and several other countries.<b> </b></p><p>In his speech, Abbas thanked them for taking the step, including, he said, Denmark, though that country has not yet recognised Palestine. It says it will only do so if certain conditions are met.</p><p>The UK and others reiterated calls for a two-state solution, which would see the creation of an independent Palestine in the West Bank and Gaza Strip, with East Jerusalem as its capital, alongside Israel.</p><p>Israel and the US criticised the move as a \"reward for Hamas\".</p><p>The Israeli military launched a campaign in Gaza in response to the Hamas-led attack on southern Israel on 7 October 2023, in which about 1,200 people were killed and 251 others were taken hostage.</p><p>At least 65,502 people have been killed in Israeli attacks in Gaza since then, according to the territory's Hamas-run health ministry. A UN commission of inquiry has said Israel has committed genocide against Palestinians in Gaza, which Israel denies.</p><p><i>Correction 26 September 2025: An earlier version of this story said Denmark was among countries which have already recognised Palestine.

Democrats said it was due to the Russia investigation.</p><p>This assertion was given extra weight when Trump said in an interview that Russia had been on his mind in acting against Mr Comey.</p><p>As a result of the firing, the investigation was placed in the hands of a special counsel.</p><p>It led to dozens of criminal charges against Trump campaign staff and associates for offences including computer hacking and financial crimes.</p><p>But it did not find that the Trump campaign and Russia had conspired to influence the election.</p></div><p></p><figcaption>Watch: Trump says “there will be others” after Comey indictment</figcaption><p></p><p></p><h2>Why was Comey indicted?</h2><p></p><div><p>The two-page indictment is short on detail, but it says Mr Comey has been charged with one count of making false statements and another of obstruction of justice.</p><p>He maintains he is innocent and will prove that in court.</p><p>Both counts relate to Mr Comey's appearance via video before the Senate Judiciary Committee in September 2020.</p><p>He was being questioned about his handling of the Clinton case and another investigation on pro-Trump election interference by Russia.</p><p>Prosecutors allege Mr Comey misled the Senate by saying he had not authorised a leak to the media about an FBI investigation.</p><p>The five-year statute of limitations for charges based on that hearing would have expired next week.</p></div><p></p><h2>What was he testifying about in 2020?</h2><p></p><div><p>It is not clear from the indictment what part of Mr Comey's evidence is being used by prosecutors, or which leak they are referring to.</p><p>One key exchange was when Senator Ted Cruz referred Mr Comey to testimony he had given to Congress three years before, in 2017.</p><p>In it, he denied being a source for stories about the Trump or Clinton investigations and denied authorising anyone at the FBI to be an anonymous source in news reports.</p><p>Mr Comey told Cruz: \"I stand by the testimony you summarised that I gave in May of 2017.\"</p><p>Some Republicans have cited this answer by Mr Comey as potentially false because they say it has been disputed by his FBI deputy at the time, Andrew McCabe.</p><p>They point to a report by the justice department's inspector general in 2018 in which Mr McCabe is said to have told investigators that Mr Comey authorised him to leak information to the press.</p></div><p></p><figcaption>Watch moments from James Comey's 2020 hearing at heart of indictment</figcaption><p></p><p></p><h2>What has Trump said about Comey?</h2><p></p><div><p>The president urged his attorney general last weekend to aggressively go after some of his opponents, naming James Comey among them.</p><p>The fact these charges were filed just days later has the president's critics saying he has weaponised the justice department for his own purposes, shattering the independence from political meddling that the agency is traditionally meant to uphold. Conservatives argue that norm was already broken with what they see as partisan investigations against Trump.</p><p>When news emerged of the indictment, Trump posted: \"JUSTICE IN AMERICA! One of the worst human beings this Country has ever been exposed to is James Comey, the former Corrupt Head of the FBI.\"</p><p>His antipathy to Mr Comey goes back years.</p><p>After his firing, Mr Comey was critical of Trump and wrote a book recounting conversations in which he said the president had acted like a mob boss by pressuring him to drop the Russia investigation.</p></div><p></p><h2>What happens next?</h2><p></p><div><p>Mr Comey will appear in court for an arraignment on 9 October where the charges will be read to him and he will enter a plea. The case will then go to trial.</p><p>Trump has said there could be more charges coming against other political figures.</p><p>He has urged prosecutors to charge Democratic Senator Adam Schiff and New York Attorney General Letitia James.</p><p>House Democratic leader Hakeem Jeffries has denounced his actions as \"a disgraceful attack on the rule of law\".</p></div></article>"

So how on earth did they sustain that level of creativity while touring the world's biggest venues, playing three-hour shows every night, and making time to visit local art galleries (<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/DOdAPIRkVHg/?hl=en&img_index=1\">Hyunjin</a>) and baked potato outlets (<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/@spudbrosexpress/video/7532898454931033366\">Felix</a>)?</p><p>\"We split up the parts as much as we could and shared the work among the members,\" explains rapper and vocalist Han who, aged 25, has more than 170 production and writing credits to his name. </p><p>\"Whenever we had a bit of time to record demo tracks, we'd gather in the room together and work on finishing the songs as a team.\"</p></div><figure><div><p><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20250919-090805-05e5ba0164-web-2.30.1-2/grey-placeholder.png\" /><img srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/8786/live/9836e2e0-99f0-11f0-8075-a1f3b14172f9.jpg.webp 240w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/8786/live/9836e2e0-99f0-11f0-8075-a1f3b14172f9.jpg.webp 320w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/8786/live/9836e2e0-99f0-11f0-8075-a1f3b14172f9.jpg.webp 480w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/8786/live/9836e2e0-99f0-11f0-8075-a1f3b14172f9.jpg.webp 640w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/8786/live/9836e2e0-99f0-11f0-8075-a1f3b14172f9.jpg.webp 800w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/8786/live/9836e2e0-99f0-11f0-8075-a1f3b14172f9.jpg.webp 1024w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/8786/live/9836e2e0-99f0-11f0-8075-a1f3b14172f9.jpg.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/8786/live/9836e2e0-99f0-11f0-8075-a1f3b14172f9.jpg.webp\" alt=\"JYP Entertainment Stray Kids on stage in Sao Paolo\" /><span>JYP Entertainment</span></p></div><p></p><figcaption>The band played to more than a million fans across the 54 dates of their DominATE World Tour</figcaption><p></p></figure><div><p>If that sounds like a soul-destroying way to make a record, you've underestimated Stray Kids. </p><p>Since their debut in 2018, the band have approached music with a combination of curiosity and hunger, constantly pushing their sound in new directions.</p><p>On Karma, that includes everything from the Brazilian funk rhythms of Ceremony, to pop-punk inflections of In My Head, which riffs on the sounds of Good Charlotte and Avril Lavigne.</p><p>\"I think that's a great song to listen to when you're feeling stressed or going through a tough time,\" says I.N. - the band's youngest member.</p><p>The stand-out is a track called Bleep, a defiant riposte to their detractors - with a hook that employs the Korean slang term for a censor's \"beep\"  (삐처리) </p><p>\"<i>Fail, 삐처리 / Frail, 삐처리 / Lazy, 삐처리 / Hazy, 삐처리 / Yada, yada, noise cancellation.</i>\"</p><p>\"That's my favourite,\" says Hyunjin. </p><p>\"The lyrics feel bold and refreshing, and there's something very satisfying about the message it holds.\"</p><p>The song carries extra resonance when you learn that Felix - the band's thunderous-voiced baritone - has won permission from a US court to unmask an anonymous social media user in connection with a defamation lawsuit.</p><p>According to legal papers filed in California, multiple posts accused the Australian-born musician of treating staff \"like servants\" and acting \"as though he is a prince\". </p><p>Felix, who is suing the user in Seoul, said the accusations caused him \"severe mental distress, physical distress and humiliation\". </p></div><figure><div><p><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20250919-090805-05e5ba0164-web-2.30.1-2/grey-placeholder.png\" /><img srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/7b19/live/b49f87c0-99f0-11f0-928c-71dbb8619e94.jpg.webp 240w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/7b19/live/b49f87c0-99f0-11f0-928c-71dbb8619e94.jpg.webp 320w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/7b19/live/b49f87c0-99f0-11f0-928c-71dbb8619e94.jpg.webp 480w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/7b19/live/b49f87c0-99f0-11f0-928c-71dbb8619e94.jpg.webp 640w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/7b19/live/b49f87c0-99f0-11f0-928c-71dbb8619e94.jpg.webp 800w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/7b19/live/b49f87c0-99f0-11f0-928c-71dbb8619e94.jpg.webp 1024w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/7b19/live/b49f87c0-99f0-11f0-928c-71dbb8619e94.jpg.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/7b19/live/b49f87c0-99f0-11f0-928c-71dbb8619e94.jpg.webp\" alt=\"JYP Entertainment Promotional photo for Stray Kids, showing all members standing together against a white backdrop\" /><span>JYP Entertainment</span></p></div><p></p><figcaption>The band are (L-R): Hyunjin, Lee Know, Seungmin, I.N, Changbin, Han, Felix, Bang Chan</figcaption><p></p></figure><div><p>In the tribal world of K-Pop, such cases are surprisingly common, as overzealous fans go too far in trashing their rivals.</p><p>But, for the most part, Stray Kids prefer not to focus on negativity. </p><p>Their new album is titled Karma to reflect the \"good energy and connection\" they've built with fans over the last seven years, says Lee Know. </p><p>\"We felt this was the right time to tell that story, because we can really feel all the positive karma that's come from our hard work,\" adds Changbin.</p><p>Anyone who's watched their YouTube series will know they're more interested in fun than friction -

known as STAY - with late-night live streams and Q&A sessions conducted from their hotel rooms. </p><p>It lends a particular intimacy to their celebrity, a quality that extends to their live shows. </p><p>In London this summer, I was struck by the way Stray Kids collapsed the distance between the stage and the audience. </p><p>Amid the precision choreography and pyrotechnics, they held dance challenges and karaoke sessions; and ran fans' names across the screens during the Coldplay-esque ballad Cinema.</p><p>Between the songs, Changbin said he was honoured to play in Tottenham stadium because of his love of English football; and his bandmates started chanting spells in British accents, as if they were auditioning for the Harry Potter reboot.</p><p>For the encore, they cleared the perimeter of the stadium floor and drove around on giant, telescoping platforms, trailed by inflatable characters, like they were in a Macy's Day parade. As a result, even the fans in the cheap seats got time up close with their idols.</p><p>\"It was such an incredibly happy time for us,\" recalls I.N of the tour. </p><p>\"I feel like we'll be looking forward to moments like that every day, and the tour really reminded us just how precious STAY is to us.\"</p><p>\"During the tour, I realised just how many STAY are out there supporting us, everywhere we go,\" adds Han. \"That really left a strong impression on me.\"</p></div><figure><div><p><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20250919-090805-05e5ba0164-web-2.30.1-2/grey-placeholder.png\" /><img srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/f2d7/live/60d2a130-99f1-11f0-928c-71dbb8619e94.jpg.webp 240w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/f2d7/live/60d2a130-99f1-11f0-928c-71dbb8619e94.jpg.webp 320w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/f2d7/live/60d2a130-99f1-11f0-928c-71dbb8619e94.jpg.webp 480w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/f2d7/live/60d2a130-99f1-11f0-928c-71dbb8619e94.jpg.webp 640w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/f2d7/live/60d2a130-99f1-11f0-928c-71dbb8619e94.jpg.webp 800w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/f2d7/live/60d2a130-99f1-11f0-928c-71dbb8619e94.jpg.webp 1024w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/f2d7/live/60d2a130-99f1-11f0-928c-71dbb8619e94.jpg.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/f2d7/live/60d2a130-99f1-11f0-928c-71dbb8619e94.jpg.webp\" alt=\"Stray Kids perform on moving platforms during their DominATE world tour\" /></p></div><p></p><figcaption>The band found innovative ways to get closer to fans during their world tour</figcaption><p></p></figure><div><p>In America and Europe, Stray Kids' DominATE tour set <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.billboard.com/pro/stray-kids-dominate-world-tour-k-pop-boxscore-records/\">box office and attendance records</a> for a K-pop band, with 1.2m tickets sold and receipts of $182m (£135m).</p><p>As a sort of victory lap, Karma went straight to the top of the US charts - making them the first band in history to debut at number one with each of their first seven albums.</p><p>But when you ask them about all that success, the octet are suddenly bashful.</p><p>\"Successful is a really strong word and I honestly do not have the confidence to judge if we are indeed successful or not,\" says Bang Chan, the group's designated leader. </p><p>\"What I can say is that Stray Kids, including myself, have reached very far but we're still very hungry to achieve more milestones.\"</p><p>Conquering the UK is definitely on the bucket list.
