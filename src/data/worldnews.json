The court found Gueant guilty of corruption, among other charges, and Hortefeux was found guilty of criminal conspiracy.</p><p>Sarkozy's wife, Italian-born former supermodel and singer Carla Bruni-Sarkozy, was <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cd1xv3xewdno\">charged last year with hiding evidence linked to the Gaddafi case</a> and associating with wrongdoers to commit fraud, both of which she denies.</p><p>Since losing his re-election bid in 2012, Sarkozy has been targeted by several criminal investigations.</p><p>He also appealed against a February 2024 ruling which found him <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-68293760\">guilty of overspending on his 2012 re-election campaign</a>, then hiring a PR firm to cover it up. He was handed a one-year sentence, of which six months were suspended.</p><p>In 2021, he was found guilty of trying to bribe a judge in 2014 and became the first former French president to get a custodial sentence. In December, the Paris appeals court ruled that he could serve his time at home wearing a tag instead of going to jail.</p></div>"

Prostitution is illegal in Dubai.</p><p>At least one of Mwesigwa's clients regularly asked to defecate on the women, according to \"Mia\", whose name we have changed to protect her identity, and who said she was trapped by Mwesigwa's network.</p><p>Mwesigwa has denied all the allegations made in the BBC's investigation. He said he helped women find accommodation through landlords, and added that women followed him to parties because of his wealthy Dubai contacts.</p><p>\"I told you I am just a party person who invites big spenders on my tables, hence making many girls flock [to] my table. That makes me know many girls and that's it,\" he said.</p><p>The investigation by the BBC also found that two women linked to Mwesigwa, Monic Karungi and Kayla Birungi, died after falling from high-rise apartments. </p></div><div><p>Although their deaths were ruled as suicides, their friends and family feel the police should have investigated further.</p><p>Mwesigwa said the incidents were investigated by the Dubai police and asked us to contact them for information.

It would seek a UN mandate to be Gaza's \"supreme political and legal authority\" for five years.</p><p>The plan would be modelled on the international administrations that oversaw East Timor and Kosovo's transitions to statehood. It would initially be based in Egypt, near Gaza's southern border, before entering Gaza once the Strip is stable, alongside a multinational force. </p><p>As PM, Blair took the decision to commit British forces to the 2003 Iraq War that was heavily criticised in the official inquiry into the conflict, which found he had acted on flawed intelligence without certainty about the production of weapons of mass destruction there.</p><p>After leaving office in 2007, Blair served as Middle East envoy for the Quartet of international powers (the US, EU, Russia and the UN). He focused on bringing economic development to Palestine and creating the conditions for a two state-solution.</p><p>Reports of discussions about his involvement in a transitional authority for Gaza come after Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas said on Thursday that he was ready to work with Trump and other world leaders to implement a two-state peace plan.</p><p>Abbas stressed his rejection of a future governing role for Hamas in Gaza and demanded it disarm.</p><p>Throughout the conflict, varying proposals for the future of Gaza have been tabled by multiple parties. </p><p>In February, Donald Trump floated plans - which since appear to have been dropped - for the US to take \"a long-term ownership position\" over Gaza, saying it could be the \"Riviera of the Middle East\". </p><p>The idea would have involved the forced displacement of Palestinians in the territory and be in violation of international law. The US and Israel said it would involve \"voluntary\" emigration.</p><p>In March, the US and Israel rejected an Arab plan for the post-war reconstruction of the Gaza Strip that would allow the 2.1 million Palestinians living there to stay in place. The Palestinian Authority and Hamas welcomed the Arab plan, which called for Gaza to be governed temporarily by a committee of independent experts and for international peacekeepers to be deployed there.</p><p>In July, a French and Saudi-led international conference in New York proposed a  \"transitional administrative committee\" for Gaza which would operate \"under the umbrella of the Palestinian Authority\". Neither the US nor Israel attended. The so-called New York Declaration was backed by a majority of the UN General Assembly in a resolution earlier this month.</p><p>Earlier this week, the UK formally recognised the State of Palestine, alongside France, Canada, Australia, and several other countries.<b> </b></p><p>In his speech, Abbas thanked them for taking the step, including, he said, Denmark, though that country has not yet recognised Palestine. It says it will only do so if certain conditions are met.</p><p>The UK and others reiterated calls for a two-state solution, which would see the creation of an independent Palestine in the West Bank and Gaza Strip, with East Jerusalem as its capital, alongside Israel.</p><p>Israel and the US criticised the move as a \"reward for Hamas\".</p><p>The Israeli military launched a campaign in Gaza in response to the Hamas-led attack on southern Israel on 7 October 2023, in which about 1,200 people were killed and 251 others were taken hostage.</p><p>At least 65,502 people have been killed in Israeli attacks in Gaza since then, according to the territory's Hamas-run health ministry. A UN commission of inquiry has said Israel has committed genocide against Palestinians in Gaza, which Israel denies.</p><p><i>Correction 26 September 2025: An earlier version of this story said Denmark was among countries which have already recognised Palestine. This has been amended to make clear that such recognition is conditional and has not yet happened.</i></p></div>"

The service could also reduce the types of parcels delivered by air and rely more on ground transportation to save costs. </p><p>One significant proposal will be ending home deliveries, which will see parcels delivered to community mailboxes instead of in front of people's doors.</p><p>An estimated four million addresses still receive that service in the country. </p><p>\"The goal, ultimately, is to save Canada Post,\" Lightbound told reporters.</p><p>The postal workers union said the proposals \"will only undermine public service\" and not address the needs of customers.</p><p>Canada Post said it was \"disappointed that the union chose to escalate their strike activity, which will further deteriorate Canada Post's financial situation.\"</p><p>\"A national strike of any length will impact service to Canadians and businesses well after the strike activity ends,\" it added. </p><p>In a statement on Friday, the Canadian Association of Independent Business warned  the impact of the job action on the country's small businesses would be \"massive\". </p><p>\"Doing this in the lead-up to the critical holiday retail shipping season is especially troubling,\" it said. </p><p>Government social security cheques will continue to be delivered during the strike.</p><p>Last year, workers embarked on a weeks-long strike over pay and improved working conditions. </p><p>Negotiations on the pay dispute remain unresolved.</p></div>"

He said the two countries were fighting the same enemies, pointing to chants of \"death to America\" by groups linked to Iran. </p></div><div><p>The Israeli prime minister repeated that Israel would not allow a Palestinian state to exist and said this position was supported by the vast majority of Israelis. </p><p>He went on to refute the conclusion of a UN commission of inquiry that<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c8641wv0n4go\"> Israel had committed genocide in Gaza</a>, claiming the charge was \"baseless\". </p><p>He also rejected statements by multiple UN agencies that Israel is deliberately restricting the amount of aid entering Gaza. In August, a <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/ckg4p90z1kxo\">UN-backed body confirmed that famine</a> was taking place in Gaza City.</p><p>Ahead of his speech, Netanyahu's office ordered that the Israeli military mount loudspeakers on trucks near the Gaza perimeter fence in order to broadcast his words live across the territory.</p><p>Netanyahu also claimed that Israeli intelligence had hacked the smartphones of people in Gaza and would stream his speech to them directly. BBC sources in Gaza said their phones had not been affected.</p><p>He said the intention of this was for a message to reach Israeli hostages there.</p><p>\"Our brave heroes,\" he read on the podium. \"This is Prime Minister Netanyahu speaking to you live from the United Nations. We have not forgotten you, not even for a second. The people of Israel are with you. We will not falter, and we will not rest until we bring all of you home.\"</p><p>There are 48 hostages remaining in Gaza, 20 of whom are thought to be alive.</p><p>Gaza resident Fadi told the BBC World Service's OS programme: \"What does he gain by broadcasting his speech forcibly to the besieged civilians inside the tents, except to further humiliate them?\" </p><p>Netanyahu devoted the latter section of his address to Israel's regional neighbours, saying it was close to a de-escalation agreement with Syria and calling on the Lebanese government to step-up its efforts to disarm Hezbollah.</p><p>He immediately came under fire within Israel, with opposition leader Yair Lapid writing: \"Today saw a weary and whining Israeli prime minister, in a speech overloaded with overused gimmicks\"</p><p>\"Instead of stopping the diplomatic tsunami - Netanyahu today worsened the state of the State of Israel,\" he wrote on X.</p><p>Yair Golan, leader of Israel's Democrats party said the speech showed \"only victimhood, sanctimoniousness, and complete blindness to the suffering of the hostages and the sacrifice of the fighters\". </p><p>He labelled the loudspeaker stunt \"invalid, childish, and insane\", saying it was \"propaganda show\". </p><p>A day earlier, Palestinian Authority leader Mahmoud Abbas said in his speech to the General Assembly that he is ready to work with world leaders to <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/czdjgdnjnlgo\">implement a peace plan</a> for Israel and the Palestinians. </p><p>Shortly after Netanyahu finished speaking, Donald Trump separately told journalists: \"I think we have a deal on Gaza\". He did not provide further details, though speculation has been mounting that a ceasefire deal could be close.</p><p>International journalists have been banned by Israel from entering the Gaza Strip independently since the start of the war nearly two years ago, making verifying claims from both sides difficult. Some journalists have been taken into Gaza by the IDF under controlled access.</p><p>The Israeli military launched a campaign in Gaza in response to the Hamas-led attack on southern Israel on 7 October 2023, in which about 1,200 people were killed and 251 others were taken hostage.</p><p>At least 65,549 people have been killed in Israeli attacks in Gaza since then, according to the territory's Hamas-run health ministry. </p></div>"

The goal, according to authorities, is to \"rectify negative emotions\" and \"create a more civilised and rational online environment\".</p><p>In the crosshairs are narratives like \"studying is useless\" and \"hard work is useless\", as well as stories that promote \"world-weariness\".</p><p>China has been grappling with an economic slowdown in the wake of a property crisis, high youth unemployment and cut-throat competition for admission to colleges and jobs - all of which have given rise to a sense of disillusionment among its younger generation.</p><p>Young people in China \"have serious questions about future prospects of their lives\" and \"must confront the fact that their livelihood is very likely going to be worse than their parents' generation,\" Simon Sihang Luo, an assistant professor of social sciences at Singapore's Nanyang Technological University, tells the BBC.</p><p>And Beijing's anxiety over the bubbling frustration has shown itself in a wave of sanctions hitting the country's influencers and social media platforms.</p></div><p></p><h2>'Android people'</h2><p></p><div><p>Last week, well-known content creator Hu Chenfeng had his social media accounts scrubbed of all posts. No-one knows why because Chinese officials gave no explanation. But it's widely believed that this was in response to a viral comment that he had recently made, classifying people and items as either \"Apple\" or \"Android\" - with the latter used to describe things that are inferior to the former.</p><p>\"Yours is a typical Android logic, Android person, Android qualification,\" he rattled off during a livestream that has since been widely shared online.</p><p>While the gag was quickly embraced by many Chinese social media users, others accused Hu of sowing social divisions.</p><p>Such obvious jokes about inequality, it seems, have become tricky territory - because they reinforce the divides that the Chinese Communist Party would rather people not dwell on.</p><p>Censorship is not new to the Chinese internet. Anything that suggests criticism of the Party, its leaders, or touches on controversial topics that have political implications, quickly disappears.</p><p>What is unusual about this campaign against pessimism is that it seems to target a range of online behaviour that could create or add to a sense of negativity.</p></div><figure><div><p><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20250919-090805-05e5ba0164-web-2.30.1-2/grey-placeholder.png\" /><img srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/f45e/live/65a6d760-9a66-11f0-a24a-c712ded530dc.jpg.webp 240w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/f45e/live/65a6d760-9a66-11f0-a24a-c712ded530dc.jpg.webp 320w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/f45e/live/65a6d760-9a66-11f0-a24a-c712ded530dc.jpg.webp 480w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/f45e/live/65a6d760-9a66-11f0-a24a-c712ded530dc.jpg.webp 640w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/f45e/live/65a6d760-9a66-11f0-a24a-c712ded530dc.jpg.webp 800w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/f45e/live/65a6d760-9a66-11f0-a24a-c712ded530dc.jpg.webp 1024w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/f45e/live/65a6d760-9a66-11f0-a24a-c712ded530dc.jpg.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/f45e/live/65a6d760-9a66-11f0-a24a-c712ded530dc.jpg.webp\" alt=\"Getty Images The picture shows two women reading instructions on a mobile phone while at a job fair in China's Lianyungang City. \" /><span>Getty Images</span></p></div><p></p><figcaption>China is grappling with a range of economic challenges, including youth unemployment</figcaption><p></p></figure><div><p>Zhang Xuefeng, a famous online tutor known for his fiery rhetoric on education and social issues, sparked controversy earlier this month when he pledged to donate at least 100 million Chinese yuan ($14m; £10.4m) if Beijing decided to invade Taiwan. But it wasn't until this week that he became the target of Chinese censors.</p><p>His social media accounts - which have millions of followers - have been blocked from gaining new followers, local media reported on Wednesday.</p><p>When asked about this, one of Mr Zhang's employees told state-owned news outlet The Paper that he was \"reflecting\" on it.</p><p>Again, it's hard to know why he is being reprimanded but some have wondered if it's the underlying message in his broadcasts - in an unfair world, you must make only practical choices. And many students and parents follow him for his brutally honest advice - instead of telling young people to follow their dreams, he often told them they must face the reality their exam scores and financial pressures dictated. His was a platform that may well have been ideal for despondency.</p></div><p></p><h2>Always sunny on the Chinese internet</h2><p></p><div><p>It's not just individuals though. China wants social media platforms to play a part too in its massive internet clean-up.</p><p>This month, the Cyberspace Administration said it would mete out \"strict punishments\" against social media apps Xiaohongshu, Kuaishou and Weibo for failing to rein in \"negative\" content, such as \"sensationalising celebrities' personal updates\" and other \"trivial information\".</p><p>\"A clear and healthy cyberspace is in the interests of the people,\" said the Cyberspace Administration.</p><p>But any attempts to keep China's cyberspace unnaturally sunny is sure to come at a cost.</p><p>\"The expression of pessimist sentiments doesn't necessarily mean a fundamental rejection of participating in the labour market and society at large,\" says Dr Luo.</p><p>But being deprived of \"relief after venting these sentiments\", he says, \"might make it even worse for their collective mental status\".</p><p>Yet the pressures - the ones that are pushing more Chinese youth to quit the rat race, \"lie flat\" and take their frustrations out online - remain. Many of them have been moving back into their parents' homes, unable to find work, or craving a break from exhausting jobs - it's happening enough that they call themselves \"full-time\" children. </p><p>And <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c3e95lny0x9o\">recent research shows that there indeed is growing pessimism about future prospects</a> in China. Experts say the Party is well-aware of it, which is why it is trying to crack down on the evidence. But will that work?</p><p>\"If anything, contemporary Chinese history has repeatedly demonstrated that top-down ideological campaigns can hardly eradicate the social roots of problems,\" says Dr Luo.</p><p>\"Even with a powerful government like the Chinese one, it is hard to arrest pessimist sentiments when the economy looks bleak, the job market is cruelly competitive, and birth rate hits rock bottom.\"</p></div></article>"
