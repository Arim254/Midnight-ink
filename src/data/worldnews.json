    "body": "<div><p>A French murder trial that opened Monday has transfixed the public because of the mystery at its core: where is the victim's body?</p><p>Cédric Jubillar, a 38 year-old painter-decorator, is accused of killing his wife Delphine nearly five years ago in a fit of jealous rage. </p><p>He has always denied the charges and, other than circumstantial evidence, investigators have struggled to build a case. There is no body, no blood, no confession, and no witness.</p><p>With its unexplained central fact and its cast of characters from small-town southern France, the affair has become a social media sensation.</p></div><div><p>Self-declared investigators have set up countless chat groups where they swap theories and share testimony – much to the irritation of police and families.</p><p>\"These groups are the equivalent of the bistro counter – but with more people,\" said psychoanalyst Patrick Avrane, author of a book on attitudes to crime.</p><p>\"Everyone constructs the theory that suits him or her the best.\"</p><p>The Jubillar mystery began at the height of Covid lockdown when – in the early hours on 16 December 2020 – Cédric Jubillar contacted the gendarmes to report that his wife had gone missing.</p><p>Delphine, who was 33 at the time, was a night nurse in a clinic not far from their home in Cagnac-les-Mines in the south-western Occitania region. The couple had two children, aged six and 18 months.</p><p>Police came to understand that the Jubillars did not have a happy relationship. </p><p>Cédric Jubillar was a habitual cannabis user and barely held down a job. Delphine was in a relationship with a man she had met over the Internet. She and Cédric were talking about divorce.</p><p>Police and locals conducted extensive searches in the surrounding countryside – with potholers descending into some of the disused mineshafts with which the area is dotted.</p><p>Delphine's body was never found, but a case was gradually built against her husband and in mid-2021 he was placed under investigation and detained.</p><p>The prosecution at the trial in the town of Albi will tell the court that Cédric Jubillar had a clear motivation to kill his wife, because of their impending split.</p><p>Lawyers will raise other points: certain odd actions by Cédric on the night of the disappearance; signs of a fight, including a pair of broken glasses; a neighbour who heard a woman screaming.</p><p>Cédric Jubillar's own character will be brought under the spotlight, with witnesses expected who will speak of his threatening language to Delphine before she disappeared, and his apparent lack of concern after.</p><p>Two of his acquaintances – a former cellmate and a former girlfriend – will also repeat what they told police: that Cédric confessed to the murder and told them where her body was.</p><p>But after more digging no body has been found, and the defence is expected to raise doubts about the veracity of the pair's accounts.</p><p>Indeed the heart of Cédric Jubillar's case is that there is nothing – beyond the popular view that he is the ideal culprit – to prove that he did away with his wife. He himself has always protested his innocence.</p><p>The trial is expected to last four weeks, with 65 witnesses called and 11 experts. More than 16,000 pages of evidence have been compiled.</p><p>Explaining the case's grip on the public mind, writer Thibault de Montaigu said in Le Figaro newspaper it was like \"a novel by Georges Simenon\" – creator of the fictional detective Inspector Maigret.</p><p>In a long analysis of the case, he said that for all the circumstantial evidence against Cédric Jubillar, the central question was this: how a \"red-eyed, fuzzy-brained guy who smoked ten joints a day could have carried out the perfect crime?</p><p>\"Killing his wife without leaving the slightest trace; secretly transporting her body, burying her in an unfindable location, then coming back to tell the police – all while his two children slept quietly in their bedrooms.</p><p>\"And this was a guy who greeted the cops in panda pyjamas and then played Game of Thrones on his phone the very morning of the disappearance.</p><p>\"So: genius bluffer; lucky fool; or poor innocent?\"</p><p>The court will decide.</p></div>"

Russia launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022.</p><p>Trump said his position had changed \"after getting to know and fully understand the Ukraine/Russia military and economic situation\".</p><p>\"Putin and Russia are in BIG Economic trouble, and this is the time for Ukraine to act,\" he added.</p><p>Earlier on Tuesday, following his speech to the UN, Trump also said Nato nations should shoot down Russian planes breaching their airspace, following a series of recent incursions by Russian fighter jets and drones.</p><p>Last week Estonia and Poland requested a consultation with other Nato members after Russia violated its airspace in separate incidents. Romania, another Nato member, also said Russian drones breached its airspace.</p><p>Russia denied violating Estonia's airspace, while it insisted the Polish incursion was not deliberate and did not comment on the Romania incident.</p><p>Asked if the US would support its Nato allies if they shot down Russian aircraft, Trump said it \"depends on the circumstance\" and praised the military alliance for increasing defence spending.</p><p>\"Nato has stepped up,\" he said, referring to an agreement by leaders to <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cj4en8djwyko\">ramp up defence spending</a> to 5% of their countries' economic output by 2035.</p><p>In his speech hours earlier, Trump criticised some Nato members for not ceasing the purchase of Russian energy, saying they were \"funding a war against themselves\".</p><p>Tuesday's Truth Social post represents an about-face after Trump spent most of the year insisting that Ukraine's situation was dire.</p><p>In February, Trump told Zelensky during <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c2erwgwy8vgo\">their fiery Oval Office exchange</a> that he did \"not have the cards right now\" to prevail against a larger, more populous nation in a war of attrition.</p><p>Before talks with Russian President Vladimir Putin in Alaska in August, Trump said he would <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c0e99yqv332o\">try to get some territory back for Ukraine</a> but warned there would be \"some swapping, changes in land\".</p><p>There were reports he was planning to press Zelensky to surrender the entirety of the eastern Ukrainian regions of Donetsk and Luhansk in return for Russia freezing the rest of the front line - a proposal put forward by Putin in Alaska.</p><p>Trump has also repeatedly threatened to impose tougher measures on Russia, but has so far failed to take any action when the Kremlin ignored his deadlines and threats of sanctions.</p><p>Unpredictability has long been one of the US president's foreign policy trademarks, and perhaps this latest move is an attempt to shake up peace negotiations that have been stagnant for more than a month after Trump hosted Russian President Vladimir Putin at a summit in Alaska.</p><p>The most notable portion of Trump's post may be the way it ended - with an assurance the US would continue to sell arms to Nato that it could then pass along to Ukraine. </p><p>It is not the seemingly near open-ended commitment to the war effort that the Biden administration provided, but it is more than Trump seemed interested in offering at times this year.</p></div>"

Her lawyers argued against the arrest, citing her age and worsening health.</p><p>Han is also accused of colluding with a former church official, surnamed Yun, to offer 100 million won in bribes to conservative lawmaker Kweon Seong-dong ahead of the 2022 presidential election, in exchange for favours for the church in the event that Yoon won the election - <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-60685141\">which he did</a>.</p><p>Kweon, once seen as a close confidante of Yoon, was arrested last Wednesday. He denies accepting bribes.</p><p>The Unification Church had pinned the blame for both sets of allegations - involving Kim and Kweon - on the former church official, saying he acted alone in offering those gifts. The official has since been arrested.</p><p>Kim, the former first lady, was <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cz71rp7yn05o\">indicted last month</a> on various charges, including bribery and stock manipulation, which she denies. Her trial started this week.</p><p>Her arrest marked the first time that both a former president and former first lady have been jailed in South Korea.</p><p>Yoon was detained in January and is <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cd97ez54dlyo\">facing a separate trial over a failed martial law attempt</a> last year that plunged the country into chaos and led to his impeachment. </p></div><div><p>The Unification Church, known formally as The Family Federation for World Peace and Unification, was founded in South Korea in the 1950s by Moon Sun-myung, who proclaimed himself the messiah.</p><p>The church is best known for holding mass weddings involving thousands of couples, some of whom would have only recently been matched by the church.</p><p>Critics have described the group as \"cult -like\". Lawyers have accused it of coercing devotees, known colloquially as \"Moonies\" after its founder, to donate large sums of money.</p><p>The Unification Church has come under the spotlight in Japan after the 2022 assassination of the country's former leader Shinzo Abe. The alleged assassin blamed the group for bankrupting his family and held a grievance against Abe for allegedly promoting it.</p><p>The group is banned in parts of the world, including Singapore. In Japan, it has been ordered to dissolve.</p></div>"

    "body": "<div><div><p>35 minutes ago</p></div><p><span><p><span>James Landale</span><span>Diplomatic correspondent, New York</span></p></span></p></div><div><p>Donald Trump's speech to the United Nations was one of the clearest expositions of the way he sees the world, his ideology in its rawest form. </p><p>To his supporters, it will be seen as Trumpism unplugged; to his critics, Trumpism unhinged.</p><p>Over almost an hour, he took aim at his opponents and their ideas, picking them off one by one as he toured the world. He began at home, praising the United States and himself. He said the US was living through a golden age and repeated his much-disputed claim that he had personally ended seven wars, something he argued merited a Nobel Peace Prize.</p><p>But then the president laid into his hosts. The UN, he said, had not helped his peace-making. He questioned the organisation's purpose, saying it had tremendous potential but was not living up to that. All it did, he claimed, was write strongly worded letters that it did not follow up. Empty words, he said, did not end wars. </p><p>He also attacked the UN for the aid it gave to asylum seekers hoping to enter the US, saying \"The UN is supposed to stop invasions, not create them and not finance them.\" The president even attacked the UN for a broken escalator and teleprompter that disrupted his visit and speech.</p><p>On one level, he has a point. Many analysts question the effectiveness of the UN in resolving conflict these days, pointing in particular to gridlock in the Security Council and the body's unresponsive bureaucracy. </p></div><div><p>But on another level Trump can be seen himself a cause and symptom of the UN's lack of effectiveness; for he believes global crises are best resolved by powerful men like him getting together and hammering out a deal, not using multilateral bodies like the UN to work out collective solutions. Under Trump, the US has withdrawn much of its UN funding, leaving the body forced to cut its humanitarian work around the world.</p><p>Trump saved perhaps his biggest criticism for his European allies, attacking the continent for investing in renewable energy, and opening its borders to migration. </p><p>\"Europe is in serious trouble. They have been invaded by a force of illegal aliens like nobody has ever seen before… Both the immigration and suicidal energy ideas will be the death of Western Europe,\" he said.</p><p>Climate change, he claimed to audible gasps, was \"the greatest con job ever perpetrated on the world\" and was lumbering European countries with expensive energy costs compared to fossil fuels. He criticised in particular the UK government for imposing new taxes on North Sea oil.</p><p>\"If you don't get away from the green energy scam, your country is going to fail,\" he said.</p><p>\"I love Europe. I love the people of Europe. And I hate to see it being devastated by energy and immigration. This double-tailed monster destroys everything in its wake… you want to be politically correct and you are destroying your heritage.\"</p><p>Note that last point. It echoes what the president said during his state visit to the UK last week when he spoke of the importance of defending the values of what he called \"the English-speaking world\". </p><p>There is a cultural edge to Mr Trump's criticism of Europe, a sense that he believes uncontrolled immigration is threatening Europe's heritage. Not for nothing is Trump the leader of an administration that wears its religion firmly on its sleeve. \"Let us protect religious liberty,\" he told the UN, \"including for the most persecuted religion on the planet today – it's called Christianity.\"</p><p>On a specific point of policy, the most substantive warning Trump gave related to Russia's war on Ukraine. He said President Putin's refusal to end the conflict was \"not making Russia look good\". He said the US was prepared \"to impose a very strong round of powerful tariffs\" to end the bloodshed. But he said European nations had to stop buying Russian energy, claiming he only found out two weeks ago that some were doing so. </p><p>In practice, Hungary and Slovakia are the only substantive European buyers of Russian oil. Diplomats say Mr Trump is hiding behind this so he does not have to impose secondary sanctions on India and China which are both buying huge amounts of cheap Russian energy, both of whom were cited by Trump.</p><p>Perhaps more important than his speech was Trump's social media post a short while later where he asserted for the first time Ukraine could be in a position to win back all of its territory. </p><p>His dismissal of Russia as a \"paper tiger\" and not a \"real military power\" will hurt President Putin, who is sensitive to any suggestion his country is not a global player. Diplomats said this was the latest example of Mr Trump's journey towards a position that is more critical of Russia.</p><p>But one should always treat Trump's words with a pinch of salt. He was being optimistic only moments after meeting Ukraine's President Zelensky at the UN. </p><p>And he said Ukraine could win back territory with EU and Nato support; there was no mention of the US involvement. All the evidence of the last few years is that this is a war of slow attrition and Ukraine would not retake land from Russia without massive US military support.</p><p>So this was undiluted Trump; a defence of America and the nation state, an assault on multilateralism and globalism, a stream of consciousness with questionable assertions. </p><p>Six years ago Trump's audience at the UN laughed at his at times unfactual assertions; this year they listened largely in silence. </p><p>\"I am really good at this stuff,\" he told world leaders. \"Your countries are going to hell.\"</p></div>"

    "body": "<div><p>The drone incursion that stopped flights at Copenhagen airport on Monday night was \"the most severe attack on Danish infrastructure so far\", Denmark's Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen said. </p><p>Kastrup airport in Copenhagen was forced to shut for several hours from around 20:30 (18:30 GMT) on Monday following the sighting of a number of drones. </p><p>\"It says something about the times we live in and what we as a society must be prepared to deal with,\" Frederiksen told reporters.</p><p>Russian involvement could not be ruled out, Frederiksen added - although Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov called the allegations \"unfounded\". </p></div><div><p>The Danish PM made a link between last night's events in Denmark and the recent Russian drone incursions in Poland and Romania, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/czrp6p5mj3zo\">as well as the violation of Estonian airspace by Russian fighter jets</a>.</p><p>Frederiksen said that the motive for the incursion in Copenhagen had likely been to \"disrupt, create unrest... to see how far you can go and test the limits.\"</p><p>Danish intelligence mirrored this assessment, saying the country was facing a \"high threat of sabotage\".</p><p>\"Someone may not necessarily want to attack us, but rather stress us out and see how we react,\" said Flemming Drejer, director of operations at Denmark's intelligence service PET.</p><p>In nearby Norway, Oslo airport too was closed for a period after possible drone sightings. </p><p>Around 20,000 passengers were <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cn4lj1yvgvgo\">impacted by the closure of Copenhagen airport</a>, which resumed operations after midnight local time.</p><p>Earlier on Tuesday Danish police stated they did not know who was behind the drones, but that evidence suggested it was a \"capable actor.\"</p><p>A number of large drones which had come from different directions \"quite a long way away\" had been observed at Copenhagen airport, said police Inspector Jens Jespersen. </p><p>He added the drones, which turned their lights on and off as they approached the airport, had been operated by someone who had the \"will and tools to show off... perhaps also to practice.\"</p><p>Police did not shoot down the drones because the airport is located in a densely built-up area and because there were planes in the air, Insp Jespersen told reporters. </p><p>In a post on social media Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky referenced \"Russia's violation\" of Nato airspace in Copenhagen on 22 September.  </p><p>Insp Jespersen refused to comment on Zelensky's allegations. </p><p>\"It's not because I don't want to, it's because I simply don't know,\" he said.</p><p>The Norwegian Police Security Service said it was working to clarify whether the  unconfirmed drone sighting at Oslo airport could be related to the drones observed in Denmark.</p><p>Oslo airport was closed between 00:30 and 03:30 and fourteen flights had to be diverted. </p><p>Norway's government said Russia has violated Norwegian airspace three times in 2025 - in April, July and August - adding that it was unclear if this was deliberate or the result of navigation errors. </p><p>\"Regardless of the cause, this is not acceptable,\" Prime Minister Jonas Gahr Store said.</p><p>Tensions have been escalating recently after Russian drones and aircraft ventured into central and eastern European airspace, three and a half years after Moscow launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine.</p><p>Earlier in September <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/clydk8821nro\">at least three Russian drones were shot down by Polish and other Nato aircraft in Poland's airspace</a>. Moscow denied it had been trying to target facilities on Polish soil. </p><p>A similar incident occurred in <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c80g7g5rmlno\">Romania only a few days later</a> when a drone flew into Romanian airspace before disappearing from the radar.</p><p>And on Saturday three Russian MiG-31 fighter jets entered Estonian skies and remained there for 12 minutes, leading Nato jets to be scrambled. The incursions were part of a \"wider pattern of increasingly irresponsible Russian behaviour,\" Nato said in a statement on Tuesday. </p><p>In recent days Poland stated it would shoot down any objects that violated its airspace, while Sweden promised to do the same if it spotted any Russian aircraft in its skies.</p><p>In response to Russia's incursions into Poland and Romania, Nato has pledged to move troops and fighter jets eastwards.</p><p>Planes from the UK, France, Germany and Denmark are taking part in air defence missions over Poland in a bid to bolster the alliance's eastern flank.</p></div>"
