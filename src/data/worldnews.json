She was the step-aunt and godmother of the late rapper Tupac Shakur. </p><p>She became involved in political activism for black Americans while in college, first with the Black Panther Party, a group that favoured radical resistance to racism in the United States and developed schools and other social services for black people.</p><p>The movement was heavily surveilled by the FBI, which considered it a threat to the US. Shakur also joined the more radical Black Liberation Army, whose membership consisted of former Black Panthers.</p><p>Shakur was travelling with fellow activists in 1973 when their car was stopped by New Jersey officers. A shoot-out ensued in which state trooper Werner Foerster and fellow activist Zayd Malik Shakur were killed. Assata Shakur was also injured in the shootout.</p><p>She was arrested and tried for Foerster's death, but denied shooting him and said her trial in front of an all-white jury was unfair.</p><p>She told NBC News in a <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/video/nbc-confronts-fugitive-cop-killer-in-cuba-part-one-647806019924\">1998 interview</a> filmed in Havana that she escaped because she was afraid for her life and that she \"would never receive justice\" in the US.</p><p>Her exile in Cuba was among the many thorny issues between the communist-run island and the US.</p><p>Shakur was the first woman to be added to the FBI's Most Wanted Terrorists list. The agency and New Jersey each offered a $1m (£746,000) reward for information leading to her arrest.</p><p>She was celebrated in music, with her name featuring in songs such as 1998's Rebel Without a Pause by hip-hop group Public Enemy and A Song for Assata by the rapper Common.</p><p>Shakur is survived by her daughter Kakuya Shakur, who wrote on Facebook: \"Words cannot describe the depth of loss that I am feeling at this time.\"</p></div></article></div>"

School district officials say they have not been told the circumstances of his arrest, and have called him an integral part of the school community.</p><p>It comes amid a wider US crackdown on immigration, as President Donald Trump seeks to deport all illegal migrants.</p></div><div><p>It is unclear whether Mr Roberts has hired an attorney to speak on his behalf.</p><p>Records show that he is being jailed at an immigration detention centre near the city of Des Moines.</p><p>ICE said in a statement that he was found \"in possession of a loaded handgun, $3,000 in cash and a fixed blade hunting knife\".</p><p>The agency said that he initially fled from police in a vehicle that had been provided to him by the school district. Officers later found his abandoned vehicle and located him with the help of Iowa State Patrol. </p><p>Mr Roberts has an existing weapons charge from February 2020 and had originally entered the US on a student visa in 1999, according to ICE. A federal judge ordered him to be deported in 2024.</p><p>The investigation into the handgun found by officers is being turned over to the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, ICE said, noting that was illegal for undocumented immigrants in the US to possess firearms. </p><p>Before leading the district of around 30,000 students in Iowa, he had previously worked as an educator in four other states, and earned college degrees and credits from universities including Georgetown and Harvard. </p><p>He also competed for Guyana in track and field at the 2000 Sydney Olympic Games, and participated in World Championships in Japan and Spain, according to NBC News. </p><p>A biography on the school district's website says that \"he was born to immigrant parents from Guyana, and spent most of his formative years in Brooklyn, NY\".

That triggered a mechanism giving Iran 30 days to find a diplomatic solution to avert renewed sanctions.</p><p>Tehran has now recalled its ambassadors to the UK, France and Germany in response, Iranian state media reports. </p><p>Iran's President Masoud Pezeshkian condemned the re-imposition of international sanctions as \"unfair, unjust, and illegal\".</p></div><div><p>He has rejected a US demand to hand over all of Iran's stockpile of enriched uranium in return for a three-month exemption from sanctions, Pezeshkian added.</p><p>\"Why would we put ourselves in such a trap and have a noose around our neck each month?\" the president asked rhetorically as he left New York for Tehran on Saturday - days after addressing the UN General Assembly.</p><p>Pezeshkian has reiterated that Tehran has no intention of developing nuclear weapons and blamed the US and Israel for intensifying pressure to try to bring down the Islamic republic.</p><p>A last-minute resolution to delay the move by six months, led by China and Russia, only received four votes in the 15-member council.</p><p>The sanctions are set to come into force at 00:00 GMT on Sunday.</p><p>Iran stepped up banned nuclear activity after the US quit the deal in 2016. Donald Trump pulled the US out in his first term as president, criticising the deal - the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) - negotiated under his predecessor Barack Obama, as flawed.</p><p>Iran barred inspectors the UN's nuclear watchdog, the IAEA, from accessing its nuclear facilities after Israel and the US bombed several of its nuclear sites and military bases in June.</p><p>That was after negotiations between the US and Iran to try to reach a new nuclear deal became deadlocked.</p><ul><li><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c5ykjvl1y9jo\">What are the risks of bombing Iran's nuclear sites?</a></li></ul><p>President Pezeshkian told the UN this week that his country would never seek to build a nuclear bomb.</p><p>Speaking to a group of journalists, he accused foreign powers of seeking a superficial pretext to set the region ablaze, insisting that, despite previous threats, Iran would not quit the Non-Proliferation Treaty.</p><p>But he added that Tehran would need reassurances that its nuclear facilities would not be attacked by Israel in order to normalise its nuclear enrichment programme.</p><p>Pezeshkian kept pointing to the negotiations which had taken place before the nuclear sites were bombed in June, and accused the Americans of not taking the talks seriously. </p><p>The sanctions add yet more strain to an already fraught situation. They include:</p><ul><li>an arms embargo</li><li>a ban on uranium enrichment</li><li>a ban on activity connected to ballistic missiles capable of delivering nuclear weapons</li><li>a freeze of assets and a travel ban on Iranian figures and entities</li><li>authorisation of countries to inspect Iran Air and Iran Shipping Lines cargo </li></ul></div><div><p>Unless a solution is found, UN sanctions would come into force first, followed by EU sanctions next week.</p><p>European foreign ministers had tried to avert the council's step by urging Iran to resume negotiations with the US; to cooperate with the IAEA - International Atomic Energy Agency - and to account for its highly enriched uranium stockpile.</p><p>Speaking at the UN on Friday, Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Aragchi said: \"The United States has betrayed diplomacy, but it is the E3 (Britain, Germany and France) which have buried it.\"</p><p>He added that the negotiations with the US are \"a pure dead end\".</p><p>Iran is legally obliged under the nuclear treaty to allow inspections of its nuclear sites, and on Friday, the IAEA confirmed that they had resumed. But while Iran has been in talks with the IAEA to find a way forward, it has also warned that a return of sanctions will put that in jeopardy.</p><p>Western powers and the IAEA say they are not convinced by Iran's insistence that its nuclear programme has purely peaceful purposes. </p><p>Russia on Friday signed a $25bn deal with Iran to build four nuclear power reactors in southern Iran, state-run IRNA news agency reported.</p></div>"

It empowered a high commissioner to behave like a dictator [and] Palestinian people bore the brunt,\" he said.</p><p>\"Recognition alone does not deal with all these historic problems which for Palestinians are not history but the living reality to this day,\" said Prof Kattan, an expert in public international law at the University of Nottingham.</p><p>The Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office (FCDO) would not confirm whether ministers had been made aware of the legal petition saying it did not \"routinely comment on\" them, although the BBC understands that Deputy Prime Minister and former Foreign Secretary David Lammy is to ask officials to look into the submission.</p><p>It documents three decades of alleged abuses by UK forces during mounting violence until 1948, after which the UK rapidly withdrew and the State of Israel was declared.</p><p>The alleged abuses by British forces range from murder, torture, expulsion and collective punishment which the submission says repressed the Arab Palestinian population amounting to war crimes and crimes against humanity.</p><p><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-63145992\">In 2022, a BBC review of some of the historical evidence involved found details of arbitrary killings,</a> arson of entire villages, \"caging\" of civilians in the open air, the use of human shields by strapping them to the front of military vehicles and the introduction of home demolitions as collective punishment. </p><p>The evidence included audio recordings made decades later in which British soldiers and police officers described abuses.

It was brutally suppressed by the British leaving about 10% of the adult male Arab Palestinian population killed, wounded, imprisoned or exiled, according to one estimate.</p><p>The Palestinian petitioners seek to build on previous concessions made by the UK over colonial-era war crimes, including this year's apology for the 1948 Batang Kali massacre in Malaya and the settlement over abuses of Kenyans during the Mau Mau uprising of the 1950s.</p><p>The decision by the UK, France and several other countries to recognise a Palestinian state saw them join more than 150 nations that already do so. </p><p>The move was welcomed by Palestinians - but rejected by Israel and the US, which argued it damaged efforts to mediate a ceasefire in the war in the Gaza Strip.</p></div>"

Prostitution is illegal in Dubai.</p><p>At least one of Mwesigwa's clients regularly asked to defecate on the women, according to \"Mia\", whose name we have changed to protect her identity, and who said she was trapped by Mwesigwa's network.</p><p>Mwesigwa has denied all the allegations made in the BBC's investigation. He said he helped women find accommodation through landlords, and added that women followed him to parties because of his wealthy Dubai contacts.</p><p>\"I told you I am just a party person who invites big spenders on my tables, hence making many girls flock [to] my table. That makes me know many girls and that's it,\" he said.</p><p>The investigation by the BBC also found that two women linked to Mwesigwa, Monic Karungi and Kayla Birungi, died after falling from high-rise apartments. </p></div><div><p>Although their deaths were ruled as suicides, their friends and family feel the police should have investigated further.</p><p>Mwesigwa said the incidents were investigated by the Dubai police and asked us to contact them for information. They did not reply to the BBC's request.</p><p>Numerous discussions about the investigation took place in the Ugandan parliament last week, with ministers calling it \"disturbing\" and pledging to work with Interpol to ensure justice. </p><p><i>Additional reporting by Jack Burgess</i></p><ul><li>If you have any information to add to this investigation please contact runako@bbc.co.uk</li><li>Details of organisations offering information about or support after sexual abuse or with feelings of despair are available at <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/actionline\">bbc.co.uk/actionline</a>.</li></ul></div>"
