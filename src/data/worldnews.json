    "body": "<div><p>A French murder trial that opened Monday has transfixed the public because of the mystery at its core: where is the victim's body?</p><p>Cédric Jubillar, a 38 year-old painter-decorator, is accused of killing his wife Delphine nearly five years ago in a fit of jealous rage. </p><p>He has always denied the charges and, other than circumstantial evidence, investigators have struggled to build a case. There is no body, no blood, no confession, and no witness.</p><p>With its unexplained central fact and its cast of characters from small-town southern France, the affair has become a social media sensation.</p></div><div><p>Self-declared investigators have set up countless chat groups where they swap theories and share testimony – much to the irritation of police and families.</p><p>\"These groups are the equivalent of the bistro counter – but with more people,\" said psychoanalyst Patrick Avrane, author of a book on attitudes to crime.</p><p>\"Everyone constructs the theory that suits him or her the best.\"</p><p>The Jubillar mystery began at the height of Covid lockdown when – in the early hours on 16 December 2020 – Cédric Jubillar contacted the gendarmes to report that his wife had gone missing.</p><p>Delphine, who was 33 at the time, was a night nurse in a clinic not far from their home in Cagnac-les-Mines in the south-western Occitania region. The couple had two children, aged six and 18 months.</p><p>Police came to understand that the Jubillars did not have a happy relationship. </p><p>Cédric Jubillar was a habitual cannabis user and barely held down a job. Delphine was in a relationship with a man she had met over the Internet. She and Cédric were talking about divorce.</p><p>Police and locals conducted extensive searches in the surrounding countryside – with potholers descending into some of the disused mineshafts with which the area is dotted.</p><p>Delphine's body was never found, but a case was gradually built against her husband and in mid-2021 he was placed under investigation and detained.</p><p>The prosecution at the trial in the town of Albi will tell the court that Cédric Jubillar had a clear motivation to kill his wife, because of their impending split.</p><p>Lawyers will raise other points: certain odd actions by Cédric on the night of the disappearance; signs of a fight, including a pair of broken glasses; a neighbour who heard a woman screaming.</p><p>Cédric Jubillar's own character will be brought under the spotlight, with witnesses expected who will speak of his threatening language to Delphine before she disappeared, and his apparent lack of concern after.</p><p>Two of his acquaintances – a former cellmate and a former girlfriend – will also repeat what they told police: that Cédric confessed to the murder and told them where her body was.</p><p>But after more digging no body has been found, and the defence is expected to raise doubts about the veracity of the pair's accounts.</p><p>Indeed the heart of Cédric Jubillar's case is that there is nothing – beyond the popular view that he is the ideal culprit – to prove that he did away with his wife. He himself has always protested his innocence.</p><p>The trial is expected to last four weeks, with 65 witnesses called and 11 experts. More than 16,000 pages of evidence have been compiled.</p><p>Explaining the case's grip on the public mind, writer Thibault de Montaigu said in Le Figaro newspaper it was like \"a novel by Georges Simenon\" – creator of the fictional detective Inspector Maigret.</p><p>In a long analysis of the case, he said that for all the circumstantial evidence against Cédric Jubillar, the central question was this: how a \"red-eyed, fuzzy-brained guy who smoked ten joints a day could have carried out the perfect crime?</p><p>\"Killing his wife without leaving the slightest trace; secretly transporting her body, burying her in an unfindable location, then coming back to tell the police – all while his two children slept quietly in their bedrooms.</p><p>\"And this was a guy who greeted the cops in panda pyjamas and then played Game of Thrones on his phone the very morning of the disappearance.</p><p>\"So: genius bluffer; lucky fool; or poor innocent?\"</p><p>The court will decide.</p></div>"

Her lawyers argued against the arrest, citing her age and worsening health.</p><p>Han is also accused of colluding with a former church official, surnamed Yun, to offer 100 million won in bribes to conservative lawmaker Kweon Seong-dong ahead of the 2022 presidential election, in exchange for favours for the church in the event that Yoon won the election - <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-60685141\">which he did</a>.</p><p>Kweon, once seen as a close confidante of Yoon, was arrested last Wednesday. He denies accepting bribes.</p><p>The Unification Church had pinned the blame for both sets of allegations - involving Kim and Kweon - on the former church official, saying he acted alone in offering those gifts. The official has since been arrested.</p><p>Kim, the former first lady, was <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cz71rp7yn05o\">indicted last month</a> on various charges, including bribery and stock manipulation, which she denies. Her trial started this week.</p><p>Her arrest marked the first time that both a former president and former first lady have been jailed in South Korea.</p><p>Yoon was detained in January and is <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cd97ez54dlyo\">facing a separate trial over a failed martial law attempt</a> last year that plunged the country into chaos and led to his impeachment. </p></div><div><p>The Unification Church, known formally as The Family Federation for World Peace and Unification, was founded in South Korea in the 1950s by Moon Sun-myung, who proclaimed himself the messiah.</p><p>The church is best known for holding mass weddings involving thousands of couples, some of whom would have only recently been matched by the church.</p><p>Critics have described the group as \"cult -like\". Lawyers have accused it of coercing devotees, known colloquially as \"Moonies\" after its founder, to donate large sums of money.</p><p>The Unification Church has come under the spotlight in Japan after the 2022 assassination of the country's former leader Shinzo Abe. The alleged assassin blamed the group for bankrupting his family and held a grievance against Abe for allegedly promoting it.</p><p>The group is banned in parts of the world, including Singapore. In Japan, it has been ordered to dissolve.</p></div>"

The crowd then praises Hamas's armed wing, the Qassam Brigades.</p><p>A Palestinian security official from the Hamas-run Gaza government told Reuters that the executions were carried out by the \"Joint Operations Room of the Palestinian resistance\".</p><p>This is a rare instance in which a public execution in Gaza has been captured on video. There have been previous reports of Hamas using violence on those who dissent. In May, Hamas-led groups reportedly executed four Palestinians for looting aid trucks.</p><p>In Sunday's footage, one armed man singles out Yasser Abu Shabab as a \"major collaborator\" who they seek to kill.</p><p>Abu Shabab is major figurehead of a clan which has reportedly been armed by the Israeli government. It has been operating in Rafah, in an area under Israeli military control. The group has presented itself as an opposition force to Hamas.</p><p>In July Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu confirmed that Israel was arming clans in Gaza that he said were opposed to Hamas. However, Yasser Abu Shabab posted online to \"categorically reject\" that Israel had supplied his group's weapons.</p><p>That same month, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c4gk79xlzwjo\">a senior officer in Hamas's security forces told the BBC</a> that the Palestinian armed group had lost much of its control over the Gaza Strip and that armed clans were filling the void.</p><p>Abu Shabab's armed group has been advertising for recruits on social media, Reuters reported. The news agency quoted residents and sources close to Hamas as saying that other groups opposed to Hamas had also emerged in parts of northern Gaza and near Khan Younis in southern Gaza.</p></div><div><p>Israeli troops meanwhile have continued to operate in Gaza City. The Israeli military said troops had \"dismantled military infrastructure used by Hamas\" and killed a Hamas cell that had attacked Israeli soldiers, wounding an officer.</p><p>It has said its objectives are to free the hostages still held by Hamas and defeat up to 3,000 fighters in what it has described as the group's \"main stronghold\".</p><p>However, the offensive on Gaza's biggest urban area, where one million people were living and a famine was confirmed last month, has drawn widespread international condemnation.</p><p>Last week a spokeswoman for the UN's humanitarian office said she had seen a constant stream of Palestinians heading south during a recent visit to the city, but that hundreds of thousands remained in the city. She described <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c5y8l46m5evo\">the situation in the city as \"cataclysmic\"</a>.</p><p>The Israeli military launched a campaign in Gaza in response to the Hamas-led attack on southern Israel on 7 October 2023, in which about 1,200 people were killed and 251 others were taken hostage.</p><p>At least 65,344 people have been killed in Israeli attacks in Gaza since then, according to the territory's Hamas-run health ministry.</p></div>"

Fellow G7 states Germany and Italy were also absent.</p></div><div><p>Belgium, Luxembourg, Malta, Andorra and San Marino are also due to recognise a Palestinian state, after the UK, Canada, Australia and Portugal announced recognition on Sunday. </p><p>International pressure is ramping up on Israel over the unfolding humanitarian crisis in Gaza and settlement building in the West Bank.</p><p>Israel has said recognition would reward Hamas for the Palestinian armed group's 7 October 2023 attack on southern Israel in which about 1,200 people were killed and 251 taken hostage.</p><p>More than 65,000 Palestinians have been killed by Israel since, according to Gaza's Hamas-run health ministry. Israeli forces are currently carrying out a ground offensive aimed at taking control of Gaza City, where a million people were living and a famine was confirmed last month.</p><p>The French leader told the conference that the time had come to stop the war and free the remaining Israeli hostages held by Hamas. He warned against the \"peril of endless wars\" and said \"right must always prevail over might\".</p><p>The international community had failed to build a just and lasting peace in the Middle East, he said, adding that \"we must do everything in our power to preserve the possibility of a two-state solution\" that would see \"Israel and Palestine side by side in peace and security\".</p><p>Saudi Arabia's Foreign Minister Faisal bin Farhan Al Saud also addressed the UN, on behalf of Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman.</p><p>He reiterated that a two-state solution was the only way to achieve lasting peace in the region.</p><p>European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said the EU would set up a new financial instrument to work on Gaza's reconstruction.</p><p>\"We must all do more,\" she told the UN General Assembly. \"This is why we will set up a Palestine Donor Group.\" </p><p>UN secretary general Antonio Guterres referred to the situation in Gaza as \"morally, legally and politically intolerable\" and said a two-state solution was the \"only credible path\" for peace between Israelis and Palestinians. </p><p>Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas - who was blocked from attending the UN General Assembly in person after the US revoked his and other Palestinian officials' visas - addressed the conference via videolink.</p><p>He called for a permanent ceasefire and said Hamas could have no role in governing Gaza, calling for the group to \"surrender their weapons\" to the Palestinian Authority (PA).</p><p>\"What we want is one unified state without weapons,\" he said.</p><p>Abbas also condemned Hamas's 7 October 2023 attack on southern Israel and addressed Israelis, saying: \"Our future and yours depends on peace. Enough violence and war.\"</p></div><div><p>Macron said France was ready to contribute to a \"stabilisation mission\" in Gaza and called for a transitional administration involving the PA that would oversee the dismantling of Hamas.</p><p>He said France would only open an embassy to a Palestinian state when all the hostages being held by Hamas are released and a ceasefire had been agreed.</p><p>Israel's ambassador to the UN, Danny Dannon, spoke to reporters shortly before Macron's announcement. </p><p>Dannon said a two-state solution was taken \"off the table\" after the 7 October attack and called this week's talks at the UN a \"charade\".  He also refused to rule out Israel annexing the occupied West Bank. </p><p>Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has insisted there will be no Palestinian state to the west of the River Jordan, and President Isaac Herzog said recognising one would only \"embolden the forces of darkness\".</p><p>Ahead of Macron's announcement, the Palestinian and Israeli flags were displayed on the Eiffel Tower on Sunday night. A number of town halls in France also flew Palestinian flags on Monday, despite a government order to local prefects to maintain neutrality.</p><p>Pro-Palestinian protests also took place in some <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c1jz8rdypw4o\">80 towns and cities across Italy</a>, where Giorgia Meloni's government said recently it could be \"counter-productive\" to recognise a state that did not exist.</p><p>In Germany, the government has said Palestinian statehood is not currently up for debate, and Foreign Minister Johann Wadephul explained as he left for New York on Monday that, \"For Germany, recognition of a Palestinian state comes more at the end of the process. But this process must begin now\".</p></div>"

Its active ingredient is acetaminophen, better known as paracetamol outside of North America.</p><p>In a statement to the BBC, Tylenol maker Kenvue said the science clearly shows that taking acetaminophen does not cause autism. </p><p>\"We strongly disagree with any suggestion otherwise and are deeply concerned with the health risk this poses for expecting mothers.\"</p><p>Acetaminophen is the safest pain reliever option for pregnant women, it added, and without it, women face a dangerous choice between suffering through conditions like fever or using riskier alternatives.</p><p>Trump made the announcement in the Oval Office alongside Health Secretary Robert F Kennedy Jr who said the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) will issue a physicians notice about what he described as the potential risk of taking Tylenol during pregnancy.</p><p>He said the FDA will also begin the process of initiating a safety label change on the medication and launch a public health campaign to spread awareness.</p><p>Kennedy added that the FDA will soon approve leucovorin, a decades-old drug traditionally used to protect cancer patients against toxicity from chemotherapy, to be used as treatment for children with autism.</p><p>FDA Commissioner Marty Makary said the approval will be based on research that he said suggests the drug may help children with autism who are deficient in folate, a form of vitamin B,<b> </b>improve their verbal communication.</p><p>But researchers have cautioned that the science is still in the very early stages, and more work is needed before any firm conclusions can be reached.</p></div><div><p>The Autism Science Foundation, a US charity, said low folate levels during early pregnancy have been linked in some studies to an increased risk of autism in children, though the findings are not consistent.</p><p>Studies in Norway, the US and Israel found that mothers who took folic acid supplements around conception had children with a 30-70% lower likelihood of autism. But other studies did not find a significant association.</p><p>The charity said the suggestion folate may improve some symptoms comes from trials of leucovorin, also known as folinic acid.</p><p>Some research has shown that unlike regular folic acid, folinic acid can more easily cross the blood brain barrier and address a deficiency of the vitamin.</p><p>Four small, randomised trials, all using different doses and measurements of success, have been carried out. One, from 2016, studied 48 autistic children in the US and found improvements in verbal communication compared with a placebo.</p></div><div><p>In April, Kennedy pledged \"a massive testing and research effort\" to determine the cause of autism in five months. </p><p>Trump on Monday called the rise in reported autism cases a \"horrible crisis\", and an issue that he has \"very strong feelings about\". </p><p>But experts have cautioned that finding the causes of autism - a complex syndrome that has been researched for decades - would not be simple. </p><p>The widely held view of researchers is that there is no single cause of autism, which is thought to be the result of a complex mix of genetic and environmental factors.</p></div><figure><div><p><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20250905-110137-f27f908f49-web-2.29.1-3/grey-placeholder.png\" /><img srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/efd6/live/8b5ddf10-979d-11f0-84a3-e314c0b97a4c.jpg.webp 240w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/efd6/live/8b5ddf10-979d-11f0-84a3-e314c0b97a4c.jpg.webp 320w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/efd6/live/8b5ddf10-979d-11f0-84a3-e314c0b97a4c.jpg.webp 480w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/efd6/live/8b5ddf10-979d-11f0-84a3-e314c0b97a4c.jpg.webp 640w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/efd6/live/8b5ddf10-979d-11f0-84a3-e314c0b97a4c.jpg.webp 800w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/efd6/live/8b5ddf10-979d-11f0-84a3-e314c0b97a4c.jpg.webp 1024w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/efd6/live/8b5ddf10-979d-11f0-84a3-e314c0b97a4c.jpg.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/efd6/live/8b5ddf10-979d-11f0-84a3-e314c0b97a4c.jpg.webp\" alt=\"Getty Images Tylenol and other pain relievers on a shelf in a drug store\" /><span>Getty Images</span></p></div><p></p><figcaption>Major medical groups say it is safe for pregnant women to take Tylenol, also known as Paracetamol </figcaption><p></p></figure><div><p>In August, a <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://hsph.harvard.edu/news/using-acetaminophen-during-pregnancy-may-increase-childrens-autism-and-adhd-risk/\">review of research</a> led by the dean of Harvard University's Chan School of Public Health found that children may be more likely to develop autism and other neurodevelopmental disorders when exposed to Tylenol during pregnancy. </p><p>Researchers argued some steps should be taken to limit use of the drug, but said it was still important for treating maternal fever and pain, which can also have negative effects for children. </p><p>But another <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38592388/\">study, published in 2024,</a> found no relationship between exposure to Tylenol and autism. </p><p>It was conducted by looking at a population sample of 2.4 million children born in Sweden between 1995 to 2019.
