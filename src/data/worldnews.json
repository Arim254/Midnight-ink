The court found Gueant guilty of corruption, among other charges, and Hortefeux was found guilty of criminal conspiracy.</p><p>Sarkozy's wife, Italian-born former supermodel and singer Carla Bruni-Sarkozy, was <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cd1xv3xewdno\">charged last year with hiding evidence linked to the Gaddafi case</a> and associating with wrongdoers to commit fraud, both of which she denies.</p><p>Since losing his re-election bid in 2012, Sarkozy has been targeted by several criminal investigations.</p><p>He also appealed against a February 2024 ruling which found him <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-68293760\">guilty of overspending on his 2012 re-election campaign</a>, then hiring a PR firm to cover it up. He was handed a one-year sentence, of which six months were suspended.</p><p>In 2021, he was found guilty of trying to bribe a judge in 2014 and became the first former French president to get a custodial sentence. In December, the Paris appeals court ruled that he could serve his time at home wearing a tag instead of going to jail.</p></div>"

It did not provide a reason.</p><p>The closure has stranded many Palestinians in the West Bank, who are unable to go on planned trips abroad. Those who are abroad have been unable to travel home.</p><p>It comes days after <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cr5qv0qmgmjo\">two Israeli military personnel were shot dead</a> near the crossing by a Jordanian gunman, who was killed at the scene.</p></div><div><p>It was briefly shut following that incident but had since reopened. </p><p>Prominent Palestinian politician Mustafa Barghouti told the BBC the closure was a \"dangerous move\" that meant \"imprisoning\" people in the West Bank and \"depriving them from the only passage out\".</p><p>The crossing - also known as the King Hussein Bridge - lies about halfway between Amman and Jerusalem and is the only official crossing point between the West Bank and Jordan. It is also the only entry point to the West Bank that does not go through Israel.</p></div><div><p>Most Palestinians in the West Bank are not allowed to travel through Israeli airports or other Israeli border crossings, meaning the bridge is an essential connection to the outside world.</p><p>\"You're talking here about disrupting the relationship between hundreds of thousands of families who are usually connected through Jordan,\" Barghouti said.</p><p>\"Thousands of people who are stuck in Jordan, they don't have resources to go and pay for hotels. They cannot stay outside. There are mothers who live with their children in the West Bank who need to come back,\" he added.</p><p>Jordan is home to more than 2m registered Palestinian refugees, while more than half of its population of more than 11m are of Palestinian descent. It has maintained security, trade and diplomatic ties with Israel since a 1994 peace treaty - but is a vocal critic of Israel's actions towards Palestinians.</p><p>Maxim Giacaman, 23, a medical student from Bethlehem, told the BBC he was unable to travel abroad for a key elective in his medical studies.</p><p>\"I have a rotation for one month in Germany for cardiac surgery,\" he said. \"And it was a big opportunity for me and for my future, my medical future.\"</p><p>\"My plane is on Saturday and I was planning to go to Amman, Jordan today,\" he says. \"So it's miserable.\"</p></div><div><p>The Allenby bridge is a key trade route for goods and medical supplies to enter the West Bank. Israeli authorities say about 9% of humanitarian aid sent by truck to Gaza passes through it. </p><p>Palestinians fear its indefinite closure forms part of an Israeli response to moves announced this week by <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c1wggrdn9dno\">the UK, France, Australia, Canada</a> and other countries to recognise the State of Palestine.</p><p>The Israeli government has labelled the moves a \"reward for terrorism\". Ultranationalist ministers have called for Israel to annex the West Bank outright as a response. </p><p>Since <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/clyv7w3gdy2o\">the Hamas-led attack on southern Israel that killed about 1,200 people</a> and saw 251 taken hostage, triggering the war in Gaza, Israel has significantly tightened its control over the West Bank. </p><p>It has introduced hundreds of new checkpoints across the territory, launched a large-scale Jewish <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cvg30l6myj3o\">settlement push</a>, and carried out <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c5ype8w6ynwo\">major military operations</a> against Palestinian resistance groups. Attacks by <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cj4wwxz12jko\">Israeli settlers</a> against Palestinians have also ramped up significantly. </p><p>\"It shows you that the world community has failed drastically in deterring Israel from expanding its oppressive policies,\" said Barghouti. \"Israel will not be restrained unless there are serious punitive acts.\"</p><p>The Allenby bridge was named after British general Edmund Allenby, who defeated the Ottoman empire to gain control of Palestine in 1917. It was built in the following year.</p><p>Israel has controlled its side of the bridge since the 1967 Six Day War, during which Israel defeated several Arab states, and in the past has temporarily closed it during religious holidays or for security reasons.</p></div><div><p><span>More on this story</span></p></div></article>"

Every year, these agencies submit their requests, which Congress must pass, and the president must sign budget legislation for the next fiscal year.</p><p>A shutdown takes place if an agreement is not reached by the start of the fiscal year on 1 October, meaning all non-essential discretionary functions stop.</p><p>Last week, Republicans in the House of Representatives - along with one Democrat - passed a short-term measure to keep the government funded until 20 November, but Senate Democrats blocked the bill. </p><p>They instead proposed their own plan that would restore health care funding after Trump's policy megabill in July - also known as the \"One, Big Beautiful Bill\" - made steep cuts to Medicaid, the healthcare programme relied upon by millions of disabled and low-income Americans.</p><p>On Tuesday, Trump said he was cancelling a meeting with Democratic Party leaders Chuck Schumer and Hakeem Jeffries, saying their demands were \"unserious and ridiculous\".</p><p>\"I have decided that no meeting with their Congressional Leaders could possibly be productive,\" Trump wrote on social media. </p><p>After news of the draft firings memo on Wednesday, Democrats accused the White House of using intimidation tactics.</p><p>\"Donald Trump has been firing federal workers since day one — not to govern, but to scare,\" said Schumer, the Democratic Senate minority leader. \"This is nothing new and has nothing to do with funding the government.\"</p><p>Since taking office, Trump has already fired thousands of federal workers through his cost-cutting initiative with the Department of Government Efficiency (Doge).</p></div>"

    "body": "<div><p>An Australian film that was digitally altered to change a same-sex couple to a heterosexual one has drawn backlash from moviegoers in China.</p><p>Together, a horror film starring Dave Franco and Alison Brie, was shown in selected Chinese cinemas in advance screenings on 12 September. Cinemagoers later realised some scenes had been modified after screenshots showing the original scenes went viral online.</p><p>The film was due to be publicly released on 19 September - but as of Thursday has yet to be aired in cinemas. </p><p>The film's global distributor, Neon, later condemned the edit, saying they did not \"approve of [this] unauthorised edit... and demand they ceased distribution\", according to reports. </p></div><div><p>The supernatural body horror film, written and directed by Australian Michael Shanks, follows a couple who move to the countryside and find themselves encountering a mysterious force that impacts their bodies, lives and relationship.</p><p>The film, which first premiered at the Sundance Film Festival in January and released in US and Australia in July, has received largely positive reviews from critics, earning a 90% freshness score on film review site Rotten Tomatoes.</p><p>But as soon as the advance screenings began in China this month, viewers noticed that some sex and nudity scenes had been modified after screenshots showing scenes from the original version circulated online. </p><p>In one scene which pictured the male lead in the shower, they noticed that the Chinese version had added steam to obscure the lead's nude body.</p><p>Most complaints, however, were about an image featuring a gay couple which had been digitally altered, with a man's face replaced by a woman's. Several references to the same-sex relationship in the film were also removed.</p><p>It's not uncommon for China - where same-sex marriage isn't recognised and LGBT topics remain largely taboo - to censor LGBT content. But this time, the use of what appeared to be AI-generated alterations struck a nerve.</p><p>\"This is no longer just a matter of cuts - it's a matter of distortion and misrepresentation,\" reads one post on popular Chinese film critic platform Douban, where the movie has a rating of 6.9 out of 10.</p><p>\"Not only did they alter the plot, but they also disrespected the actor's sexual orientation. It's disgusting,\" reads another.</p><p>On Wednesday, the film's global distributor, Neon spoke out against the edits,  criticising the film's Chinese distributor, Hishow, which has yet to comment on the matter. </p><p>\"Neon does not approve of Hishow's unauthorised edit of the film and have demanded they cease distributing this altered version,\" the company said in a statement sent to the BBC.</p><p>It's not the first time China has used AI to alter sexual content. In Oscar-winning film Oppenheimer, a nude scene featuring Florence Pugh was edited with an AI-generated black dress for Chinese cinemas.</p><p>China is also apparently cracking down on same-sex content. Since February, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c056nle2drno\">at least 30 writers of gay erotic fictions</a>, nearly all of them women in their 20s, have been arrested across the country.</p></div>"

Three smaller airports also reported drone activity.</p><p>On Monday, Copenhagen airport temporarily closed due to a drone incursion.</p><p>Defence Minister Troels Lund Poulsen told a news conference that the \"hybrid attack\" was part of a \"systematic operation\", but said the devices had been launched locally.</p></div><div><p>A hybrid attack uses a mix of military and non-military tactics and is designed to interfere with a nation's infrastructure or institutions.</p><p>Drones pose a risk of colliding with planes, particularly during take-off or landing, but halting air traffic in and out of an airport to avoid this can cause delays and flights being redirected elsewhere.</p><p>At least three flights were diverted away from Aalborg during the incident. </p><p>All the airports affected by the overnight incident sit on Jutland, the part of Denmark that is on the European mainland.</p><p>Drones were first sighted over the northerly Aalborg airport around 21:44 local time (19:44 GMT), state media reports. A few minutes later, police received reports of drone activity near small, southerly airports in Esbjerg, Sønderborg and Skrydstrup.</p><p>Possible drone activity over Billund prompted the closure of its airport for about an hour early on Thursday morning.</p><p>The drones were assessed to have cleared shortly before 03:00 and the airspace was reopened. Danish police are now seeking to find out who launched them.</p><p>Poulsen said there was no evidence to suggest Russia was behind the incursion. The Russian embassy in Copenhagen has denied \"absurd speculations\" of its involvement.</p><p>It described the incidents as \"staged provocations\", saying they would be used \"as a pretext for further escalating tension\" over the war in Ukraine.</p><p>Russia has been accused of conducting hybrid attacks in the past, and Europe has been on high alert after several Nato member states reported Russian incursions in their airspaces.</p><p>Estonia and Poland requested a consultation with other Nato members last week, after <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/clydk8821nro\">around 20 Russian drones crossed into Poland</a> and <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/czrp6p5mj3zo\">Russian MiG31 jets entered Estonian airspace</a> in a separate incident.

A small number have been taken into the Strip by Israeli troops under controlled access.</p></div><div><p>The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) has previously said that to \"allow journalists to report safely\" in Gaza the military \"accompanies them when in the battlefield\".</p><p>The BBC has contacted the Israeli foreign ministry and the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) for comment. </p><p>Last year Israel's High Court of Justice ruled that restrictions on entry to Gaza were justified on security grounds. </p><p>Deborah Turness, CEO of BBC News, said: \"It is almost two years since October 7th when the world witnessed Hamas' atrocities. Since then, a war has been raging in Gaza but international journalists are not allowed in. </p><p>\"We must now be let into Gaza. To work alongside local journalists, so we can all bring the facts to the world.\"</p><p>The film premieres in New York on Wednesday night at an event hosted by the Committee to Protect Journalists, to coincide with the United Nations General Assembly. It features footage of historic events and atrocities captured by journalists.</p><p>They include scenes of the D-Day landings during World War Two, the Vietnam War, Ethiopia's 1984 famine, China's Tiananmen Square protests, the Rwandan genocide, the Syrian refugee crisis and the war in Ukraine.</p><p>\"In Ukraine, journalists from around the world risk their lives every day to report the suffering of the people,\" says Dimbleby in the film. </p><p>\"But when it comes to Gaza the job of reporting falls solely to Palestinian journalists, who are paying a terrible cost, leaving fewer to bear witness.\"</p></div><div><p>This is not the first time news organisations have called on Israeli authorities to allow journalists into the territory. </p><p>In July, BBC News, AFP, AP and Reuters issued a statement expressing \"desperate concern\" for journalists in Gaza experiencing dire circumstances including hunger and displacement. </p><p>In August, 27 countries including the UK backed a statement calling for Israel to allow immediate foreign media access to Gaza and condemned attacks on journalists there.</p><p>According to the UN Human Rights Office, at least 248 Palestinian journalists have been killed in Israeli attacks in Gaza.</p><p>Israel has repeatedly denied that its forces target journalists. </p><p>The Israeli military launched a campaign in Gaza in response to the Hamas-led attack on southern Israel on 7 October 2023, in which about 1,200 people were killed and 251 others were taken hostage.</p><p>At least 65,419 people have been killed in Gaza since then, according to the territory's Hamas-run health ministry. The ministry's figures are quoted by the UN and others as the most reliable source of statistics available on casualties.</p></div>"

meaning teens were being shown content which broke Instagram's own rules about what should be shown to young people.</p><p>This included posts describing \"demeaning sexual acts\" as well as autocompleting suggestions for search terms promoting suicide, self-harm or eating disorders.</p><p>\"These failings point to a corporate culture at Meta that puts engagement and profit before safety,\" said Andy Burrows, chief executive of the Molly Rose Foundation -

and apologised to a group of parents who said their children had been harmed by social media.</p><p>Since then, Meta has implemented a number of measures to try and increase the safety of children who use their apps.</p><p>But \"these tools have a long way to go before they are fit for purpose,\" said Dr Laura Edelson, co-director of the report's authors Cybersecurity for Democracy.</p><p>Meta told the BBC the research fails to understand how its content settings for teens work and said it misrepresents them.</p><p>\"The reality is teens who were placed into these protections saw less sensitive content, experienced less unwanted contact, and spent less time on Instagram at night,\" said a spokesperson.</p><p>They added the tools gave parents \"robust tools at their fingertips\".</p><p>\"We'll continue improving our tools, and we welcome constructive feedback - but this report is not that,\" they said.</p><p>It said the Cybersecurity for Democracy centre's research states tools like \"Take A Break\" notifications for app time management are no longer available for teen accounts -
