    "body": "<div><p>A French murder trial that opened Monday has transfixed the public because of the mystery at its core: where is the victim's body?</p><p>Cédric Jubillar, a 38 year-old painter-decorator, is accused of killing his wife Delphine nearly five years ago in a fit of jealous rage. </p><p>He has always denied the charges and, other than circumstantial evidence, investigators have struggled to build a case. There is no body, no blood, no confession, and no witness.</p><p>With its unexplained central fact and its cast of characters from small-town southern France, the affair has become a social media sensation.</p></div><div><p>Self-declared investigators have set up countless chat groups where they swap theories and share testimony – much to the irritation of police and families.</p><p>\"These groups are the equivalent of the bistro counter – but with more people,\" said psychoanalyst Patrick Avrane, author of a book on attitudes to crime.</p><p>\"Everyone constructs the theory that suits him or her the best.\"</p><p>The Jubillar mystery began at the height of Covid lockdown when – in the early hours on 16 December 2020 – Cédric Jubillar contacted the gendarmes to report that his wife had gone missing.</p><p>Delphine, who was 33 at the time, was a night nurse in a clinic not far from their home in Cagnac-les-Mines in the south-western Occitania region. The couple had two children, aged six and 18 months.</p><p>Police came to understand that the Jubillars did not have a happy relationship. </p><p>Cédric Jubillar was a habitual cannabis user and barely held down a job. Delphine was in a relationship with a man she had met over the Internet. She and Cédric were talking about divorce.</p><p>Police and locals conducted extensive searches in the surrounding countryside – with potholers descending into some of the disused mineshafts with which the area is dotted.</p><p>Delphine's body was never found, but a case was gradually built against her husband and in mid-2021 he was placed under investigation and detained.</p><p>The prosecution at the trial in the town of Albi will tell the court that Cédric Jubillar had a clear motivation to kill his wife, because of their impending split.</p><p>Lawyers will raise other points: certain odd actions by Cédric on the night of the disappearance; signs of a fight, including a pair of broken glasses; a neighbour who heard a woman screaming.</p><p>Cédric Jubillar's own character will be brought under the spotlight, with witnesses expected who will speak of his threatening language to Delphine before she disappeared, and his apparent lack of concern after.</p><p>Two of his acquaintances – a former cellmate and a former girlfriend – will also repeat what they told police: that Cédric confessed to the murder and told them where her body was.</p><p>But after more digging no body has been found, and the defence is expected to raise doubts about the veracity of the pair's accounts.</p><p>Indeed the heart of Cédric Jubillar's case is that there is nothing – beyond the popular view that he is the ideal culprit – to prove that he did away with his wife. He himself has always protested his innocence.</p><p>The trial is expected to last four weeks, with 65 witnesses called and 11 experts. More than 16,000 pages of evidence have been compiled.</p><p>Explaining the case's grip on the public mind, writer Thibault de Montaigu said in Le Figaro newspaper it was like \"a novel by Georges Simenon\" – creator of the fictional detective Inspector Maigret.</p><p>In a long analysis of the case, he said that for all the circumstantial evidence against Cédric Jubillar, the central question was this: how a \"red-eyed, fuzzy-brained guy who smoked ten joints a day could have carried out the perfect crime?</p><p>\"Killing his wife without leaving the slightest trace; secretly transporting her body, burying her in an unfindable location, then coming back to tell the police – all while his two children slept quietly in their bedrooms.</p><p>\"And this was a guy who greeted the cops in panda pyjamas and then played Game of Thrones on his phone the very morning of the disappearance.</p><p>\"So: genius bluffer; lucky fool; or poor innocent?\"</p><p>The court will decide.</p></div>"

It could also have disabled mobile phone towers and launched distributed denial of service attacks that might have blocked emergency dispatch  communications.</p><p>The devices were seized from SIM farms at abandoned apartment buildings across more than five sites. Officials did not specify the locations.</p><p>The discovery followed an investigation into anonymous \"telephonic threats\" directed at three US government officials this spring, unnamed officials told the New York Times.</p><p>One of the officials works in the Secret Service and the other two work at the White House, according to the newspaper. </p><p>Investigators also told CBS News they found 80g of cocaine, illegal firearms, computers and phones. </p><p>More than 100 world leaders and delegations have gathered in Midtown Manhattan for the 80th anniversary of the UN General Assembly in New York. </p></div>"

She had pleaded not guilty.</p><p>Lee's lawyers argued that she was insane at the time of the killing, which happened months after her husband died of cancer.

He has been spotted on the fringes of two cultural events, including a heavy metal festival in South Moravia.</p><p>Elk were once native to Czech forests but were hunted to extinction in the Middle Ages. There have been several attempts to reintroduce them over the centuries, but they remained unsuccessful until the 1970s.</p><p>The Czech Republic's elk population is believed to be around fifty animals, far fewer than Emil's presumed homeland of Poland, which has tens of thousands.</p></div>"

    "body": "<div><div><p>10 hours ago</p></div><p><span><p><span>Sarah Rainsford</span><span>Southern and Eastern Europe correspondent</span></p></span></p></div><div><p>The president of Moldova Maia Sandu has warned that her country's independence and European future are in danger after police arrested dozens of people accused of involvement in a plot to stoke violent disorder, allegedly backed by Russia.</p><p>Just days before Sunday's pivotal parliamentary elections, Moldovan police said they had confiscated weapons and explosives in raids across the country.</p><p>They allege some of the 74 detainees had travelled to Serbia for training by Russian instructors, including with firearms.</p><p>Addressing the nation, President Sandu accused the Kremlin of \"pouring hundreds of millions of euros\" into Moldova in an attempt to foment violence and spread disinformation and fear.</p></div><div><p>\"The Kremlin believes that we are all for sale. That we are too small to resist. That we are not a country, only a territory,\" the president declared, pointing to Russian involvement at the highest level.</p><p>\"But Moldova is our home. And our home is not for sale.\"</p><p>Pro-Russian parties have accused Sandu of trying to intimidate them - and sway the vote.</p><p>Sandu also called on supporters to come out and cast their ballots on Sunday in an election in which pro-Russian forces are set to shake the pro-EU status quo. The majority held by Sandu's own Party of Action and Solidarity, PAS, seen at risk.</p><p>For her, a high turnout – especially among the diaspora - is key.</p><p>Moldova declared its independence as the USSR fell apart over 30 years ago, but it has a significant Russian-speaking population. The breakaway region of Transnistria, propped up by Moscow, is still home to a contingent of Russian troops.</p><p>For years Moscow's influence has lingered in Moldovan politics.</p><p>But under President Sandu, the country has launched talks to join the EU and last year held a referendum in which voters chose to enshrine the goal of accession to the bloc in their constitution.</p><p>That ballot was the president's initiative, an attempt to set Moldova's EU path in stone.</p><p>In the end, the \"yes\" vote won by only a small margin of 50.4% to 49.5%. The referendum was mired by extensive evidence of Russian meddling – including cash being smuggled into the country to buy votes.</p><p>It's thought that only a small percentage of the money being sent is intercepted – 10 to 15% of the total – and in Moldova, with its small population, every ballot counts.</p><p>\"With 200,000 votes it's possible to change everything: it's enough to look at the EU referendum in October, which was decided by such a small margin,\" Sergiu Panainte, deputy director of the German Marshall Fund in Bucharest, points out.</p><p>\"The fines now for selling your vote are really big but there are still people willing to do it.\"</p><p>Russia's hybrid attacks are a large part of the problem for Sandu's PAS, but not all of it.</p><p>Opponents accuse the government of not going far enough in tackling corruption, for example, and in Russian-speaking regions like Gagauzia, voters believe Moldova should engage with Moscow and not \"antagonise\" it.</p><p>President Sandu and her supporters strongly disagree.</p><p>In 2022, when Russia launched the full-scale invasion of Moldova's neighbour Ukraine, she made a decisive turn towards Europe as the only guarantor of her own country's security and its sovereignty.</p><p>The latest police raids suggest Moscow hasn't given up.</p><p>Separately, on Monday, Bloomberg news agency reported that it had seen documents outlining extensive Russian plans to seed unrest and warp the vote.</p><p>Russia's SVR foreign intelligence service has now issued its own statement, deliberately mirroring what was said by Moldova. It claims that European countries themselves are plotting the \"blatant falsification\" of the result on Sunday in order to provoke protests.</p><p>The SVR even warns that the EU could mount \"an armed incursion and de-facto occupation\" of Moldova, falsely claiming that the EU is deploying troops.</p><p>\"This is Russia openly planning for Plan B,\" Sergiu Panainte warns. \"If PAS do get a majority, it means they [Russia] will resort to violence and staged attacks. This is the option they are preparing for.\"</p></div>"

The crowd then praises Hamas's armed wing, the Qassam Brigades.</p><p>A Palestinian security official from the Hamas-run Gaza government told Reuters that the executions were carried out by the \"Joint Operations Room of the Palestinian resistance\".</p><p>This is a rare instance in which a public execution in Gaza has been captured on video. There have been previous reports of Hamas using violence on those who dissent. In May, Hamas-led groups reportedly executed four Palestinians for looting aid trucks.</p><p>In Sunday's footage, one armed man singles out Yasser Abu Shabab as a \"major collaborator\" who they seek to kill.</p><p>Abu Shabab is major figurehead of a clan which has reportedly been armed by the Israeli government. It has been operating in Rafah, in an area under Israeli military control. The group has presented itself as an opposition force to Hamas.</p><p>In July Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu confirmed that Israel was arming clans in Gaza that he said were opposed to Hamas. However, Yasser Abu Shabab posted online to \"categorically reject\" that Israel had supplied his group's weapons.</p><p>That same month, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c4gk79xlzwjo\">a senior officer in Hamas's security forces told the BBC</a> that the Palestinian armed group had lost much of its control over the Gaza Strip and that armed clans were filling the void.</p><p>Abu Shabab's armed group has been advertising for recruits on social media, Reuters reported. The news agency quoted residents and sources close to Hamas as saying that other groups opposed to Hamas had also emerged in parts of northern Gaza and near Khan Younis in southern Gaza.</p></div><div><p>Israeli troops meanwhile have continued to operate in Gaza City. The Israeli military said troops had \"dismantled military infrastructure used by Hamas\" and killed a Hamas cell that had attacked Israeli soldiers, wounding an officer.</p><p>It has said its objectives are to free the hostages still held by Hamas and defeat up to 3,000 fighters in what it has described as the group's \"main stronghold\".</p><p>However, the offensive on Gaza's biggest urban area, where one million people were living and a famine was confirmed last month, has drawn widespread international condemnation.</p><p>Last week a spokeswoman for the UN's humanitarian office said she had seen a constant stream of Palestinians heading south during a recent visit to the city, but that hundreds of thousands remained in the city. She described <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c5y8l46m5evo\">the situation in the city as \"cataclysmic\"</a>.</p><p>The Israeli military launched a campaign in Gaza in response to the Hamas-led attack on southern Israel on 7 October 2023, in which about 1,200 people were killed and 251 others were taken hostage.</p><p>At least 65,344 people have been killed in Israeli attacks in Gaza since then, according to the territory's Hamas-run health ministry.</p></div>"
