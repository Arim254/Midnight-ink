But the controversy over Tempest has triggered a fresh wave of support for the ban.</p><p>\"Keep the K-drama ban to the death, thank you,\" reads one Weibo comment liked by 10,000 users.</p><p>While much of the anger has coalesced around Jun's line about China, social media users have also dug up other examples from the series which they view as offensive.</p><p>For example, scenes meant to portray China's Dalian city feature a bunch of dilapidated buildings, believed to be shot in Hong Kong, which some people say paints China in a bad light.</p><p>In another scene, a group of people are seated at a table set on a red carpet with yellow stars, which social media users say resembles the Chinese flag. </p><p>When Jun recited an ancient Chinese poem in another instance, viewers criticised what they viewed as her wonky accent.</p><p>All this has led to a concerted effort against Jun on Weibo, where users are pressuring brands to punish her. </p></div><div><p>According to sharp-eyed Weibo users, American skincare brand La Mer, French luxury brand Louis Vuitton and Swiss watchmaker Piaget have all scrubbed Jun from their social media accounts. </p><p>\"Besides removing Jun Ji-hyun advertisements, quickly terminate her contracts globally. Otherwise we'll boycott LV forever,\" reads one comment on Louis Vuitton's Weibo account.</p><p>Jun's agency told local news outlet MBC on Tuesday that the actress's brand campaigns were \"unrelated\" to Tempest and had ended before the show's release. </p><p>Chinese consumers are known to harness their massive spending power in pressure campaigns when they perceive insults to Chinese national pride.</p><p>Brands from Swedish fashion giant H&M to Japanese clothing chain Uniqlo and most recently Swatch - <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cn02k9ykej5o\">for an ad featuring an a</a><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cn02k9ykej5o\">llegedly</a><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cn02k9ykej5o\"> racist gesture</a> - have all found themselves the target of such boycott campaigns.</p><p>Some people have come to Jun's defence, arguing that she was not the one who wrote the controversial line.</p><p>\"Jun Ji-hyun is just an actor. It is impossible for her to understand the history of a country, the emotions of the people, and the intricate relationships between countries before making a movie,\" one Weibo user wrote, blaming the incident on the \"ignorance\" of the show's crew and writers.</p><p>But such sentiments have been drowned out by heated opposition. \"Even a washing machine can't whitewash something as well as you,\" reads a comment to the post. </p><p>\"She isn't a small-time actor. She has a choice of script, she can read the script! Who can force a popular star to do this?\" another wrote.</p><p>Jun swept to stardom with the 2001 rom-com My Sassy Girl, which took Asia by storm and established her as a noughties 'it girl'. Since then, she has found enduring success with her roles, from the 2013 fantasy romance series My Love from the Star, to the 2021 Netflix thriller Kingdom.</p><p>But like many other South Korean celebrities, she has been conspicuously missing from China's entertainment scene since the 2016 ban. </p><p>Optimism had surrounded a lifting of the ban earlier this year, as bilateral ties appeared to be warming.</p><p>In March, South Korea's foreign ministry said that the two countries' foreign ministers agreed to work on restoring cultural exchanges. The following month, South Korean hip-hop band Homies became the first all-Korean group to perform in mainland China in nearly a decade.</p><p>But it's hard to say how much K-pop and K-dramas will be let back into what was once its biggest market.</p><p>In May, K-pop boy band Epex was slated to perform in Fuzhou, in what would have been a landmark concert for K-pop in China. But their show was cancelled weeks before the event, with their management agency citing \"local circumstances\".</p><p>Last week, when asked about the postponement of another concert in Hainan province that was set to feature multiple K-pop groups, Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson Lin Jian said that China did not oppose \"beneficial cultural exchanges\" with South Korea.</p><p>Over the last decade, China has proven to be a <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/videos/c78082v5jplo\">pop culture juggernaut</a> in its own right, capable of keeping its population of 1.3 billion entertained with homegrown media. And for many Chinese viewers, the ongoing controversy surrounding Tempest has given them another reason to steer away from K-content.</p><p>\"It's already 2025 and you're still watching K-dramas, how tacky!\" wrote a Weibo user.</p></div>"

She had pleaded not guilty.</p><p>Lee's lawyers argued that she was insane at the time of the killing, which happened months after her husband died of cancer. But prosecutors argued that her actions were calculated.</p><p>The remains of her children were discovered  in 2022 by a family who had purchased the contents of an abandoned storage unit at an auction in Auckland.</p></div><div><p>The bodies were believed to have been stored there for several years.</p><p>Lee was arrested in Ulsan, South Korea, in September 2022 and extradited to New Zealand later that year.</p><p>During the trial, the court heard that the children's bodies had no sign of trauma, though it was clear they had been killed by someone.</p><p>A pathologist found they had died by homicide by unspecified means, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c1wgqpx3q1go\">including the use of Nortriptyline, an antidepressant</a>, the prosecution said.</p><p>The court heard that Lee picked up her prescription for the drug from a pharmacy in August 2017 – five months after her husband, Ian Jo, was diagnosed with cancer.</p><p>The defence claimed Lee's mental health deteriorated after her husband's death and came to believe it was best if they all died together. </p><p>This led her to try to kill herself and her children with the antidepressant, but she<b> </b>got the dose wrong - when she woke up, her children were dead<b>. </b>While she did kill her children, she was \"not guilty of murder by reason of insanity,\" her lawyer said.</p><p>But the prosecution argued that Lee had demonstrated rational thought by hiding the children's remains, changing her name and moving back to South Korea, the prosecution said.</p><p>The killings were a \"selfish act to free herself from the burden of parenting alone\", the prosecution said.</p><p>On Tuesday, Lee had her head down and gave no reaction when the jury delivered the verdict, which came after around three hours of deliberation.</p><p>Lee is set to be sentenced in November. She faces a maximum sentence of life in prison, AFP reported.</p></div>"

    "body": "<p></p><figcaption>Watch: President Macron announces that France formally recognises state of Palestine</figcaption><p></p><div><p>France has formally recognised a Palestinian state, becoming the latest in a wave of countries to take the step.</p><p>Speaking at the UN in New York, President Emmanuel Macron said \"the time for peace has come\" and that \"nothing justifies the ongoing war in Gaza\". </p><p>US President Donald Trump is due to address the UN General Assembly on Tuesday, as will the leaders of key regional players such as Jordan and Qatar.</p><p>On Monday, the US did not attend a one-day summit hosted by France and Saudi Arabia which focused on plans for a two-state solution to the conflict. Fellow G7 states Germany and Italy were also absent.</p></div><div><p>Belgium, Luxembourg, Malta, Andorra and San Marino are also due to recognise a Palestinian state, after the UK, Canada, Australia and Portugal announced recognition on Sunday. </p><p>International pressure is ramping up on Israel over the unfolding humanitarian crisis in Gaza and settlement building in the West Bank.</p><p>Israel has said recognition would reward Hamas for the Palestinian armed group's 7 October 2023 attack on southern Israel in which about 1,200 people were killed and 251 taken hostage.</p><p>More than 65,000 Palestinians have been killed by Israel since, according to Gaza's Hamas-run health ministry. Israeli forces are currently carrying out a ground offensive aimed at taking control of Gaza City, where a million people were living and a famine was confirmed last month.</p><p>The French leader told the conference that the time had come to stop the war and free the remaining Israeli hostages held by Hamas. He warned against the \"peril of endless wars\" and said \"right must always prevail over might\".</p><p>The international community had failed to build a just and lasting peace in the Middle East, he said, adding that \"we must do everything in our power to preserve the possibility of a two-state solution\" that would see \"Israel and Palestine side by side in peace and security\".</p><p>Saudi Arabia's Foreign Minister Faisal bin Farhan Al Saud also addressed the UN, on behalf of Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman.</p><p>He reiterated that a two-state solution was the only way to achieve lasting peace in the region.</p><p>European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said the EU would set up a new financial instrument to work on Gaza's reconstruction.</p><p>\"We must all do more,\" she told the UN General Assembly. \"This is why we will set up a Palestine Donor Group.\" </p><p>UN secretary general Antonio Guterres referred to the situation in Gaza as \"morally, legally and politically intolerable\" and said a two-state solution was the \"only credible path\" for peace between Israelis and Palestinians. </p><p>Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas - who was blocked from attending the UN General Assembly in person after the US revoked his and other Palestinian officials' visas - addressed the conference via videolink.</p><p>He called for a permanent ceasefire and said Hamas could have no role in governing Gaza, calling for the group to \"surrender their weapons\" to the Palestinian Authority (PA).</p><p>\"What we want is one unified state without weapons,\" he said.</p><p>Abbas also condemned Hamas's 7 October 2023 attack on southern Israel and addressed Israelis, saying: \"Our future and yours depends on peace. Enough violence and war.\"</p></div><div><p>Macron said France was ready to contribute to a \"stabilisation mission\" in Gaza and called for a transitional administration involving the PA that would oversee the dismantling of Hamas.</p><p>He said France would only open an embassy to a Palestinian state when all the hostages being held by Hamas are released and a ceasefire had been agreed.</p><p>Israel's ambassador to the UN, Danny Dannon, spoke to reporters shortly before Macron's announcement. </p><p>Dannon said a two-state solution was taken \"off the table\" after the 7 October attack and called this week's talks at the UN a \"charade\".  He also refused to rule out Israel annexing the occupied West Bank. </p><p>Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has insisted there will be no Palestinian state to the west of the River Jordan, and President Isaac Herzog said recognising one would only \"embolden the forces of darkness\".</p><p>Ahead of Macron's announcement, the Palestinian and Israeli flags were displayed on the Eiffel Tower on Sunday night. A number of town halls in France also flew Palestinian flags on Monday, despite a government order to local prefects to maintain neutrality.</p><p>Pro-Palestinian protests also took place in some <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c1jz8rdypw4o\">80 towns and cities across Italy</a>, where Giorgia Meloni's government said recently it could be \"counter-productive\" to recognise a state that did not exist.</p><p>In Germany, the government has said Palestinian statehood is not currently up for debate, and Foreign Minister Johann Wadephul explained as he left for New York on Monday that, \"For Germany, recognition of a Palestinian state comes more at the end of the process. But this process must begin now\".</p></div>"

He was believed to have entered the country from Poland.</p><p>Since then, Emil has become a social media sensation, with hundreds of photos and videos posted online. There are at least three Facebook groups devoted to him, with a combined total approaching 50,000 members.</p><p>According to Czech Radio's online news portal iRozhlas, he has wandered through 60 towns and villages in four countries – Poland, the Czech Republic, Slovakia and Austria – in a journey approaching 500 kilometres.</p><p>He has picked his way across roads and railways, forded local streams and swum across the River Danube. He has been spotted on the fringes of two cultural events, including a heavy metal festival in South Moravia.</p><p>Elk were once native to Czech forests but were hunted to extinction in the Middle Ages. There have been several attempts to reintroduce them over the centuries, but they remained unsuccessful until the 1970s.</p><p>The Czech Republic's elk population is believed to be around fifty animals, far fewer than Emil's presumed homeland of Poland, which has tens of thousands.</p></div>"
