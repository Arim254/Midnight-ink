    "body": "<p><span>We may earn a commission from links on this page.</span>\n            <span>Deal pricing and availability subject to change after time of publication.</span>\n    </p><article>\n        <hr />\n        <p><em>Did you know you can customize Google to filter out garbage? <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/tech/you-can-now-tell-google-which-websites-you-prefer-search-results\" target=\"_blank\">Take these steps</a></em><em> for better search results, <a href=\"https://www.google.com/preferences/source?q=lifehacker.com\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"open in a new window\">including adding my work at Lifehacker as a preferred source</a></em><em>.</em></p><hr /><p>Finding great travel deals is a skill, but it’s one that can be honed—if you know where to source a bargain, can be patient and flexible, <em>and</em> if you know you can take advantage of the <a href=\"https://www.transportation.gov/airconsumer/notice-24hour-reservation\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"open in a new window\">24-hour free federal cancelation policy</a> to lock in a time-sensitive opportunity. Some of the hottest tricks people have been using lately to save on their travels are websites that let you buy other people's non-refundable vacations, from flights to hotels to cruises. If this sounds like your vibe, buckle up. </p><p>Here are some of the best travel websites you can use to snag your next trip on the cheap.</p><h2 id=\"google-flights-explore-tool\">Google Flights' explore tool</h2><p>I expect most people to know this one, but I have to start the list somewhere. For those who might not know, Google Flights has an <a href=\"https://www.google.com/travel/explore\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"open in a new window\">“explore” tool</a> where you see a map of your potential destinations from your local airport and their prices. This is great when you don't have a specific destination in mind but want to get away and see where you could potentially travel to. You can scroll through the planet and find some bargains that you might've never seen otherwise. </p><p><strong>Quick tip</strong>: If you have a budget, use the filters on the top left to set it and see where you can afford to travel to around the world. </p><h2 id=\"use-skyscanner-to-find-the-cheapest-flights\">Use Skyscanner to find the cheapest flights</h2><p>Yes, Google Flights is more user-friendly and has cool features, but if you mean business and are looking for the <em>cheapest </em>flight options you can find, <a href=\"https://www.skyscanner.net/flights\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"open in a new window\">Skyscanner</a> is what you want to use. Here, you’ll find flights that will not even appear on Google Flights, and it even has an <a href=\"https://www.skyscanner.net/transport/flights-from/atla/?oym=2506\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"open in a new window\">explore-like</a> tool similar to Google’s where you simply input your local airport, select “whole month” for dates, and click “search” to find all the possible low-cost destinations for that month (I found a direct flight to Cancun from my home in Atlanta for $183). </p><p>You can catch last-minute flight deals and set alerts for cheap flights as well.</p><h2 id=\"shop-second-hand-vacation-packages-from-people-who-cant-get-refunds\">Shop second-hand vacation packages from people who can't get refunds</h2><p>Imagine you buy a whole package deal for a family vacation months in advance but, like most people, you forego the travel insurance. You have a family emergency and can no longer take the trip. What can you do? Sell your vacation on the internet. </p><p>Websites like Sparefare, Roomer, Plans Change, and Transfer Travel let you buy other people's vacations that they can no longer use themselves. You can both save money and get these people out of a sticky situation. Here's a quick breakdown of your options:</p><h3>TransferTravel</h3><p><a href=\"https://www.transfertravel.com/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"open in a new window\">TransferTravel</a> is like the Facebook Marketplace of travel plans. You can find anything from cruises, to flights, to hotels, events, and more. It's the most wide-ranging of all of these websites that offer transferable travel products. </p><h3>SpareFare</h3><p><a href=\"https://sparefare.net/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"open in a new window\">SpareFare</a> focuses on flight tickets or vouchers, hotel reservations, and holiday packages. You'll be connected directly with the seller to get their non-refundable bookings. SpareFare also helps you manage the name change process for airline tickets, which can get a bit complicated if you do it by yourself.</p><h3>Roomer</h3><p>If you're focusing on finding hotels at a bargain, use <a href=\"https://www.roomertravel.com/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"open in a new window\">Roomer</a>. The website focuses on showing you non-refundable bookings from people desperately trying to recoup any money they can. You can find hotels from all over the world and filter by number of occupants, dates, and location. You might not always find something available where you're staying, but if you do, you'll be a happy camper. </p><div>\n            <p><span>\n                What do you think so far?\n            </span>\n        </p></div>\n<h3>PlansChange</h3><p><a href=\"https://www.planschange.com/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"open in a new window\">PlansChange</a> is exactly like Roomer, but it's smaller in scope and reach. It doesn't hurt to check both when you find yourself looking for a bargain stay.</p><h2 id=\"use-secretflying-to-set-up-alerts-for-their-error-fares\">Use SecretFlying to set up alerts for their “Error Fares”</h2><p>Airlines make mistakes sometimes, and as a savvy traveler, you need to be ready to take advantage of them when you can. <a href=\"https://www.secretflying.com/usa-deals/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"open in a new window\">SecretFlying</a> is a travel deal website that works like many others, but it also has  a special tool to find cheap flights that exist because of mistakes that airlines make. (For example, there was an enticing <a href=\"https://www.secretflying.com/posts/error-fare-chicago-to-london-uk-for-only-58-roundtrip/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"open in a new window\">Chicago to London round-trip for only $58</a> last month.) The error fares go fast, and many might not logistically work for you, but if you ever do catch one of these, you’ll be bragging about it for years to come. </p><h2 id=\"use-the-travel-arrow-extension\">Use the Travel Arrow extension</h2><p>If you're still only using Google Flights to do your searching, you could be missing out on some cheaper options. Travel Arrow is an extension you can install on your browser that will <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/this-chrome-extension-searches-every-airline-booking-si-1850709238\" target=\"_blank\">cross-reference your Google Flight info</a> on Skyscanner, Kayak, Trip, and Expedia (all the major competitors to Google Flights). While it doesn't always work, it's a free tool that will more than pay for itself if you ever end up booking a cheaper flight with it. Keep in mind that some flights might be cheaper because their layovers are longer.</p><h2 id=\"use-these-online-vacation-package-websites\">Use these online vacation package websites</h2><p>There are <em>many</em> websites that sell you travel packages that include flights, hotels, food, tours, and even transportation (rails, buses, taxis, etc.) for <em>much </em>cheaper than you would find if you tried to book each piece individually. The catch is that these packages are typically strict on dates, and their cancellation policies are often less forgiving. <em>But</em> you’ll be able to find amazing deals at locations you might not otherwise be able to afford. </p><p><a href=\"https://www.gate1travel.com/?Brand=GATE1\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"open in a new window\">Gate1</a>, for example, has been around since the '80s—my mom has used it with my dad to visit the eight wonders of the world on a budget over the years. Their best deals come from their <a href=\"https://www.gate1travel.com/featured-specials\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"open in a new window\">weekly specials</a> (you can sign up for their emails) and <a href=\"https://www.gate1travel.com/last-minute-deals\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"open in a new window\">last-minute deals</a> where you can find multi-day trips for big discounts. </p><p>For example, you can do a 13-day Thailand trip for $2,249 with all this included:</p><ul><li><p>Roundtrip flights Los Angeles to Bangkok, or Bangkok to Los Angeles </p></li><li><p>Intra-flight Chiang Mai to Bangkok</p></li><li><p>11 nights First Class accommodations</p></li><li><p>Hotel taxes, fees, service charges, and porterage</p></li><li><p>18 meals: 11 breakfasts, 3 lunches, 4 dinners</p></li><li><p>Sightseeing per itinerary in modern air-conditioned motor coach</p></li><li><p>Services of English-speaking tour manager throughout</p></li><li><p>Entrance fees per itinerary</p></li></ul><p>Here are some other websites similar to Gate1 where you can find great deals on packages for your next trip:</p><ul><li><p><a href=\"https://www.travelpirates.com/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"open in a new window\">TravelPirates</a></p></li><li><p><a href=\"https://www.greatvaluevacations.com/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"open in a new window\">Great Value Vacations</a></p></li><li><p><a href=\"https://www.going.com/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"open in a new window\">Going</a> (formerly Scott’s Cheap Flights)</p></li></ul>\n            </article>"

/><p>For as basic a necessity as it is, feeding yourself is a lot of work. What's more, feeding a household is even worse. There's the planning, then the shopping, the unpacking, the cooking, the storing, and finally, the cleaning, all of which has to be done over and over again forever. We all know what it's like to be faced with this task and just decide to open up Uber Eats and pay a bunch of fees to have someone do (most of) it for us. Apps are the saving grace when meal planning gets too daunting—but you're using the wrong apps. Forget Door Dash and Grub Hub: These apps can help you plan, shop for, and prepare meals on your own while still offloading some of the hard work on tech. </p><p>Here are some meal-planning apps that can suggest recipes based on your dietary preferences, put together shopping lists, and even walk you through the cooking. They can't box up leftovers or wash the dishes, but maybe one day in the future, we'll get there, too.</p><div>\n        <p><img src=\"https://lifehacker.com/images/short-lifehacker-logo.jpg\" alt=\"Lifehacker Logo\" /></p><div>\n            <p><span>You May Also Like</span></p>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n<h2 id=\"best-app-for-recipes-bigoven\">Best app for recipes: BigOven </h2><div>\n    <p><img src=\"https://lifehacker.com/imagery/articles/01K5ENZY2QS3V48SX95J2FN89P/images-1.fill.size_2000x1125.v1758218648.png\" alt=\"BigOven on browser\" srcset=\"https://lifehacker.com/imagery/articles/01K5ENZY2QS3V48SX95J2FN89P/images-1.fill.size_800x450.v1758218648.png 800w, https://lifehacker.com/imagery/articles/01K5ENZY2QS3V48SX95J2FN89P/images-1.fill.size_1400x788.v1758218648.png 1400w, https://lifehacker.com/imagery/articles/01K5ENZY2QS3V48SX95J2FN89P/images-1.fill.size_2000x1125.v1758218648.png 2000w\" />\n            </p>\n            <p><span></span>\n                                        <span>Credit: Lindsey Ellefson/BigOven</span>\n                    </p>\n    </div>\n<p><a href=\"https://zdcs.link/9wjZYq?pageview_type=Standard&template=Explainers&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=BigOven&short_url=9wjZYq&u=https%3A%2F%2Flifehacker.com%2Fbest-meal-planning-apps&event_label=BigOven\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"open in a new window\">BigOven</a> is a meal-planning app that grants you access over one million recipes—and new recipes are constantly being added. I like a few different things about it: First, you can input some of the ingredients you already have and get recipes based on those, reducing your grocery shopping and limiting how many of those million-plus recipes you need to scroll through. You can scan handwritten recipes in, too, and let the app turn them into recipes you can store there, preserving family traditions. Finally, I appreciate that it has a browser version, since that makes it easier to type, browse, and scroll. A few of the apps on this list also work on the browser. In general, I like to do a lot of my planning and work on the computer, then call in my phone at crunch time, just when I need to refer to a recipe. </p><p>The free version is nice, but limited. You get the ability to put together a grocery list and one free recipe scan. For more detailed meal planning, you’ll need to upgrade to its paid version for $2.99 per month or $24.99 for the year. Think of it like this: You'll save that much by skipping a delivery order or two. </p><h2 id=\"best-app-for-family-meal-planning-cozi\">Best app for family meal planning: Cozi </h2><div>\n    <p><img src=\"https://lifehacker.com/imagery/articles/01K5ENZY2QS3V48SX95J2FN89P/images-3.fill.size_2000x1131.v1758218648.png\" alt=\"Cozi in iOS\" srcset=\"https://lifehacker.com/imagery/articles/01K5ENZY2QS3V48SX95J2FN89P/images-3.fill.size_800x452.v1758218648.png 800w, https://lifehacker.com/imagery/articles/01K5ENZY2QS3V48SX95J2FN89P/images-3.fill.size_1400x792.v1758218648.png 1400w, https://lifehacker.com/imagery/articles/01K5ENZY2QS3V48SX95J2FN89P/images-3.fill.size_2000x1131.v1758218648.png 2000w\" />\n            </p>\n            <p><span></span>\n                                        <span>Credit: Lindsey Ellefson/Cozi</span>\n                    </p>\n    </div>\n<p><a href=\"https://zdcs.link/QOg182?pageview_type=Standard&template=Explainers&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=Cozi&short_url=QOg182&u=https%3A%2F%2Flifehacker.com%2Fbest-meal-planning-apps&event_label=Cozi\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"open in a new window\">Cozi</a> is a family organizer, so you might not think of food and recipes when you first hear about it—but don't be fooled. In addition to its daily calendar and to-do lists, Cozi provides space for you to keep a grocery list (which any family member can add to in real time) and even offers up recipes. Not only can you plan your meals' content, but you can schedule them for when everyone is available. </p><p>The basic version is free, but the premium version, which is $39.99 per year, offers more features, most of which have to do with the family management aspect (like birthday tracking and calendar searching). If you're using it for meal planning, you may not need to upgrade; I was able to build out an entire schedule of recipes without paying.</p><h2 id=\"best-app-for-fitness-and-nutrition-goals-eat-this-much\">Best app for fitness and nutrition goals: Eat This Much </h2><div>\n    <p><img src=\"https://lifehacker.com/imagery/articles/01K5ENZY2QS3V48SX95J2FN89P/images-4.fill.size_2000x1117.v1758218648.png\" alt=\"Eat This Much in iOS\" srcset=\"https://lifehacker.com/imagery/articles/01K5ENZY2QS3V48SX95J2FN89P/images-4.fill.size_800x447.v1758218648.png 800w, https://lifehacker.com/imagery/articles/01K5ENZY2QS3V48SX95J2FN89P/images-4.fill.size_1400x782.v1758218648.png 1400w, https://lifehacker.com/imagery/articles/01K5ENZY2QS3V48SX95J2FN89P/images-4.fill.size_2000x1117.v1758218648.png 2000w\" />\n            </p>\n            <p><span></span>\n                                        <span>Credit: Lindsey Ellefson/Eat This Much</span>\n                    </p>\n    </div>\n<p><a href=\"https://zdcs.link/9wjZYR?pageview_type=Standard&template=Explainers&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=Eat%20This%20Much&short_url=9wjZYR&u=https%3A%2F%2Flifehacker.com%2Fbest-meal-planning-apps&event_label=Eat%20This%20Much\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"open in a new window\">Eat This Much</a> is really ideal for anyone with specific nutrition and fitness goals. It puts together plans based not only on your budget and personal preferences, but your nutritional plans, as well. You're prompted to enter in how many calories you'd like to eat in a day, as well as how many grams of protein and other nutrients you want to hit. It even doubles as a calorie tracker and comes with a database of nutritional information about restaurant and packaged food. If you're meal planning and prepping for fitness or health goals, this could be the one for you to really focus in on. (Relatedly, if you're in the market for a comprehensive calorie and nutrient tracker, I am a huge fan of <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/tech/lifesum-health-app-review\" target=\"_blank\">Lifesum</a>.)</p><p>Money comes into play if you want more features. For $8.99 per month, you can create meal plans for a week, used advanced search features, view your past meals, and generate reports on your eating habits, to name a few. A bump up to $59 per month unlocks bulk meal plans for over a week in advance, macro tracking, and a recipe database, among other things. That's not exactly a small cost, but if you're serious about meal prepping, give it a look.</p><h2 id=\"best-app-for-when-youre-busy-mealime\">Best app for when you're busy: Mealime </h2><div>\n    <p><img src=\"https://lifehacker.com/imagery/articles/01K5ENZY2QS3V48SX95J2FN89P/images-5.fill.size_2000x1133.v1758218648.png\" alt=\"Mealime in iOS\" srcset=\"https://lifehacker.com/imagery/articles/01K5ENZY2QS3V48SX95J2FN89P/images-5.fill.size_800x453.v1758218648.png 800w, https://lifehacker.com/imagery/articles/01K5ENZY2QS3V48SX95J2FN89P/images-5.fill.size_1400x793.v1758218648.png 1400w, https://lifehacker.com/imagery/articles/01K5ENZY2QS3V48SX95J2FN89P/images-5.fill.size_2000x1133.v1758218648.png 2000w\" />\n            </p>\n            <p><span></span>\n                                        <span>Credit: Mealime/Lindsey Ellefson</span>\n                    </p>\n    </div>\n<p><a href=\"https://zdcs.link/a5X02j?pageview_type=Standard&template=Explainers&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=Mealime&short_url=a5X02j&u=https%3A%2F%2Flifehacker.com%2Fbest-meal-planning-apps&event_label=Mealime\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"open in a new window\">Mealime</a> is widely recommended in forums for meal planners and caters to busier people because it's full of recipes that can be made in under half an hour. You can filter recipes by dietary restrictions or preferences, generate a grocery list, and get on with your day. It's a little bare-bones beyond that, but as a picky eater, I appreciate the ability to eliminate recipes that include the things I don't care for. If you ever catch me eating a single mushroom, call the authorities because I'm sending a distress signal.</p><div>\n            <p><span>\n                What do you think so far?\n            </span>\n        </p></div>\n<p>You'll get plenty of recipes in the free version, but you'll notice some are labeled \"Pro.\" To get those, as well as other features like the ability to add notes, you'll have to upgrade to the paid version for $2.99 per month.

may have heard of the Pomodoro technique before—<a href=\"https://www.lifehacker.com/productivity-101-a-primer-to-the-pomodoro-technique-1598992730\" target=\"_blank\">perhaps even here at Lifehacker</a>—and might already be aware it’s a solid productivity hack. But applied in another way, i can actually be more than that: This technique is also an excellent study tool that can help you maximize your focus and retention. It's time-tested, variable, and available to you whether you want to do it the old-fashioned way or call in the help of an app. </p><h2 id=\"what-is-the-pomodoro-technique\">What is the Pomodoro technique?</h2><p>Although it has a fancy name, the technique itself is simple: If you have a large task to complete, you should break it down into pieces and schedule breaks to reward yourself in between finishing bits of it. The scheduling is the key part: When following the classic Pomodoro model, you have to set an alarm for 25 minutes and 25 minutes only. So, work for 25 minutes, and when the alarm goes off, take a five-minute break, maybe to grab a snack, refill your coffee, or scroll social media. When the five minutes are up, get back to work. Do this over and over, but every four cycles, give yourself a bigger break, up to a half an hour.</p><div>\n        <p><img src=\"https://lifehacker.com/images/short-lifehacker-logo.jpg\" alt=\"Lifehacker Logo\" /></p><div>\n            <p><span>You May Also Like</span></p>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n<p>In the event something distracts you—whether it’s your phone or another person—you have to reset your timer, so try instead to be direct and tell them you’re busy and will be able to reconnect with them in a bit. Then, put them off until you get your five-minute break or even after your whole task is finished. </p><p>This works because you are aware you’re getting that little reset once your 25 minutes are up. You can throw yourself into the task knowing there’s a little treat coming down the pipeline. And while you rest up, your brain is processing everything you just learned. </p><h2 id=\"how-to-use-pomodoro-for-studying\">How to use Pomodoro for studying</h2><p>We usually discuss the Pomodoro technique in terms of working professionally, especially when there’s a big project you need to complete, but its origins actually come from the academic sphere. The method was invented by Fancesco Cirillo, a developer and entrepreneur, but he came up with it when he was a student. It’s actually named for the little tomato-shaped timer he used when he was studying. Those methods are certainly still viable, but the popularity of his technique has also birthed a cottage industry of specialty timers. On Amazon, <a href=\"https://zdcs.link/aADMrL?pageview_type=Standard&template=Explainers&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=you%20can%20get%20a%20Pomodoro-specific%20timer&short_url=aADMrL&u=https%3A%2F%2Flifehacker.com%2Fhow-to-use-the-pomodoro-method-for-studying&event_label=you%20can%20get%20a%20Pomodoro-specific%20timer\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"open in a new window\">you can get a Pomodoro-specific timer</a> for under $20. These offer different preset time allotments, so you don't have to stick to the 25 on, five off model—but I'll get to that in a moment.</p><p>You can use this method to study for a test by breaking up the content you need to review. You go by chapter, by content, or by “chunk,” if you’re <a href=\"https://www.lifehacker.com/use-the-chunking-method-to-actually-remember-what-you-1850392462\" target=\"_blank\">using the chunking method</a> to divvy up your study load (which you should be). It’s a good way to stay on task if you get easily distracted and dividing your topics up will help you remember them better. It’s not ideal for quick cramming sessions, however, since you need at least two hours to get four “Pomodoros” in. Do this on a day you have plenty of time to devote to studying—and, of course, relaxing.</p><h2 id=\"pomodoro-variations-that-work-for-studying\">Pomodoro variations that work for studying</h2><p>As noted, the classic Pomodoro technique involves 25 minutes on and five minutes off, but you needn't be so rigid—there's a reason those Pomodoro timers don't lock you to those intervals. Twenty-five minute increments worked for Cirillo and countless adherents after him, but they may not work for you. I do recommend starting with the classic technique, but if you're not finding yourself falling into <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/use-deep-work-to-be-more-productive-1850632295\" target=\"_blank\">a state of deep work</a> during those blocks of time, you have to switch things up. </p><p>There's a lot of flexibility to the method, so feel free to experiment. For instance, one student invented \"<a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/work/how-to-use-animedoro-productivity-method\" target=\"_blank\">Animedoro</a>\" a few years ago. This approach involves working for longer intervals, around 40 to 60 minutes, then getting 20 minutes to relax and do something you enjoy—like watching an episode of anime, which tend to be about 20 minutes long. With longer working time, you have a better chance of getting into deep work and focusing, plus not getting discombobulated when your timer suddenly goes off. </p><div>\n            <p><span>\n                What do you think so far?\n            </span>\n        </p></div>\n<p>Another approach is called <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/work/try-pomodoro-20-to-focus-on-deep-work\" target=\"_blank\">Pomodoro 2.0</a> and it involves adding 15 minutes to your work period every time you return to your task, so you focus longer and longer as you go. You still need to take breaks, of course, and you can even make those incrementally longer too. </p><p>Or maybe you prefer to work in quick bursts. You can try variations where you study for just 10 minutes before a short break, giving yourself a sense of urgency as you try to see how many flashcards you can study in that time. The point is it's up to you: A period of work interspersed with breaks is the only core element of the method, and you can approach it in whatever way you find most useful. Just keep in mind that you'll get better results if you commit to a set structure, even if it takes some time to adjust to it.</p><h2 id=\"pomodoro-apps-can-help\">Pomodoro apps can help</h2><p>I'm a fan of those Pomodoro timers because they keep me off my phone, which is a major distraction—it's a slippery slope from setting an alarm to checking a notification and then finding myself in a Reels hole 10 minutes of my allotted study time. </p><p>Then again, the phone can be useful if you're using it productively. Many focus timer apps can be used with the Pomodoro method, and will even block other apps during the work-time increments you set, or otherwise penalize you for getting distracted when you should be focusing. (If you need suggestions, <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/tech/best-focus-timer-apps\" target=\"_blank\">I've previously written about a few of my favorites</a>.)</p><p>There are also Pomodoro-specific apps—including <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/tech/focuspomo-app-review\" target=\"_blank\">my top pick, FocusPomo</a>—that exist purely to help you structure your study or productivity time around the famous technique. If using your phone alarm seems risky and buying a tabletop timer off Amazon feels antiquated, look into one of these. </p>\n            </article>\n    </div>\n<div>\n    <div>\n        <p><span>The Daily Newsletter</span>\n            <span>Ready to do everything better?</span>\n        </p>\n        <p><img src=\"https://lifehacker.com/images/team/Jordan.png\" alt=\"Jordan Calhoun portrait\" />\n            <span>Jordan Calhoun\n            </span>\n            <span>Editor in chief</span>\n        </p>\n        <p><span><span>Get daily tips, tricks, <span>and tech guides</span></span> <span>from Jordan and the team.</span></span>\n    </p></div>\n    <div>\n        <p><span>The Daily Newsletter</span>\n            <span><span>Ready to do everything better?</span> <span>Get daily tips, tricks, <span>and tech guides</span></span> <span>from Jordan and the team.</span></span>\n        </p>\n    </div>\n</div>\n    </div>\n            <div>\n                <p><span>\n                        Keep Scrolling for Next Article\n                    </span>\n                </p>\n            </div>\n        </div>\n    </div>"

Scientists have figured out how many units of information you can store in your short-term memory (around seven, <a href=\"https://www.lifehacker.com/preview/study-in-chunks-to-remember-more-1850392462?rev=1682969564950\" target=\"_blank\">though there are great workarounds for remembering more</a> than that), but if you <em>really</em> want to remember something,  you have to go over it a bunch of times until it lodges deeper in your brain. </p><p>There are <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/use-the-leitner-system-to-study-more-effectively-1850786716\" target=\"_blank\">quite a few ways to do that</a> if you have some time to devote to the practice of repetition, but if you’re getting ready for a test at school or a presentation at work, you might not have too long to go over the content again and again and <em>again</em>—but you do, if you make a personal podcast. This technique requires you to make an effort only once, then calls on you to relax and absorb the information more passively, making it ideal for studying or reviewing when you are short on time or heavy on other tasks. </p><div>\n        <p><img src=\"https://lifehacker.com/images/short-lifehacker-logo.jpg\" alt=\"Lifehacker Logo\" /></p><div>\n            <p><span>You May Also Like</span></p>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n<h2 id=\"how-to-make-a-podcast-to-help-you-study\">How to make a “podcast” to help you study</h2><div><p>Next time you want to retain the details of something you’re studying, open up the voice notes feature on your phone, because you’re going to make yourself a little study podcast. You <em>could</em> simply read your notes out loud into the mic; it’s the simplest option, and a good one. (If you’re memorizing a speech, just perform the whole thing. That's what I did in high school, when I was a forensics nerd and felt that using even a single notecard during a speech meet delegitimized my entire presentation. For what it's worth, I won a lot, which I partially attribute to being off-book while everyone else used aids.) </p><p>You do have other, more intensive, options though. You can record separate “episodes” for each mini-topic you’re studying, which will help you organize your thinking <em>and</em> provide an easy way to focus if you need brushing up in a particular area. Use <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/best-note-taking-methods-1849535943\" target=\"_blank\">your preferred note-taking method</a> or a r<a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/use-the-sq3r-method-to-study-more-effectively-1850780175\" target=\"_blank\">eading-and-retaining technique like SQ3R</a> to create outlines that are concise but make sense and hit on the points you most need to study, then write your scripts according to those notes. That part will take a while, but all of it, combined, will help you start to remember what you're supposed to be remembering.</p><p>You don’t have to worry about the thing actually being pleasant for others to listen to, so make it useful for your own study style. A few approaches you could take include asking yourself review questions out loud, pausing, and stating the right answer or reading entire passages from your textbook into the mic. You could even try out different characters and turn it into a role-playing scenario. Don't get too involved with it, though, unless that sort of creativity helps you focus; it's better to stick with facts and straightforward audio.</p></div><p>The most important part comes after you’ve recorded your personal podcast: You have to listen to it. You have to listen to it <em>a lot</em>. Play it through the speakers of your car or through your headphones on the train to make your commute productive. Play it at the grocery store, when you’re doing errands around the house, and when you are relaxing at night. Fall asleep listening to it. The first few times, you'll listen pretty actively, but even having it running as background noise will shove that information into your brain.</p><div>\n            <p><span>\n                What do you think so far?\n            </span>\n        </p></div>\n<h2 id=\"a-second-option-for-your-study-podcast\">A second option for your study podcast</h2><p>If you're going to do this, a major component of what makes it valuable is the part where you have to review the material, outline the script, and say it all out loud into your microphone. That's a big chunk of the studying right there. Still, if you don't have time for that or you are worried you won't highlight the most important parts if left to your own devices, there's another option that works well. </p><p><a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/tech/google-notebooklm-review\" target=\"_blank\">Google's NotebookLM</a> is an AI tool that pulls <em>only</em> from the material you give it. That means that unlike competitors such as ChatGPT, it doesn't answer your questions by searching the entire internet. Rather, it searches through PDFs, YouTube videos, links, and other resources you provide—and that's it. One of its coolest features is that it can <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/tech/use-google-notebooklm-ai-to-turn-your-research-into-a-podcast\" target=\"_blank\">create \"podcasts\"</a> for you based on those materials, in addition to its ability to <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/tech/googles-notebooklm-introduces-quizzes-flashcards-tools\" target=\"_blank\">create flashcards and quizzes</a>. These podcasts sound like real ones you might listen to in your everyday life: They have different voices and characters who speak conversationally but factually about the content of whatever you uploaded to the software. I love NotebookLM and use it all the time to organize my work. It's free to use and generates podcasts quickly, so it's worth considering here, too.</p><h2 id=\"why-a-personal-study-podcast-works\">Why a personal study podcast works</h2><div><p>Picking things up from your personal podcast is an example of rote learning, the process by which we memorize things based on repetition. But it has other advantages, too. </p><p>For instance, even when you’re compiling the notes and deciding <em>what </em>to include in the mini podcast, you’re studying—you’re making decisions about which concepts are most important, how they flow together, and how you can present your mastery of them to others. Even if you choose to let NotebookLM do it, you're still making decisions about which materials from your class or project to upload to the software and how to organize it, which is also studying. </p><p>Reading is all well and good, but you remember things better when you process them in a variety of ways. From organizing your notes to speaking them aloud and listening to them read back to you, every part of this process will help you more thoroughly process and recall the content. Each of those is commonly used on its own as a standalone study technique, so imagine how effective they’ll be together. </p></div>\n            </article>\n    </div>\n<div>\n    <div>\n        <p><span>The Download Newsletter</span>\n            <span>Never miss a tech story</span>\n        </p>\n        <p><img src=\"https://lifehacker.com/images/team/Jake.png\" alt=\"Jake Peterson portrait\" />\n            <span>Jake Peterson\n            </span>\n            <span>Senior tech editor</span>\n        </p>\n        <p><span>Get the latest tech news, <span></span>reviews, <span></span>and advice from Jake and the team.</span>\n    </p></div>\n    <div>\n        <p><span>The Download Newsletter</span>\n            <span><span>Never miss a tech story.</span> Get the latest tech news, <span></span>reviews, <span></span>and advice from Jake and the team.</span>\n        </p>\n    </div>\n</div>\n    </div>\n            <div>\n                <p><span>\n                        Keep Scrolling for Next Article\n                    </span>\n                </p>\n            </div>\n        </div>"

It’s easy to get caught up in frenzied online shopping holidays like the upcoming <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/money/everything-you-need-to-know-about-october-prime-big-deals-day-2025\" target=\"_blank\">October Prime Day sale</a>—<strong> </strong>especially when retailers sometimes <a href=\"https://www.lifehacker.com/that-amazon-deal-might-actually-be-a-hidden-price-hike-1849649849\" target=\"_blank\">sneak price hikes before major sales</a> or deceive shoppers with <a href=\"https://www.lifehacker.com/all-the-ways-amazon-tricks-you-into-spending-more-on-pr-1849158042\" target=\"_blank\">tricks to get you to spend more than you intended to</a>. </p><p>Figuring out the best time to buy something requires constantly watching ever-fluctuating online prices <em>and</em> some knowledge of how prices have changed in the past. As a shopping and deals writer, that is what I do for a living, and I know how time-consuming it can be. Luckily, you don’t have to figure it all out yourself: Here are the best websites and extensions I've been using for years to check price history and track prices so that you can be sure you’re getting the best deal possible.</p><div>\n        <p><img src=\"https://lifehacker.com/images/short-lifehacker-logo.jpg\" alt=\"Lifehacker Logo\" /></p><div>\n            <p><span>You May Also Like</span></p>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n<h2 id=\"the-best-amazon-price-tracker-camelcamelcamel\">The best Amazon price tracker: Camelcamelcamel</h2><div>\n    <p><img src=\"https://lifehacker.com/imagery/articles/01HF2GY1EGKVBM56BVJC4RJMWT/images-8.fill.size_2000x1449.v1738779720.png\" alt=\"Camelcamelcamel price history on website\" srcset=\"https://lifehacker.com/imagery/articles/01HF2GY1EGKVBM56BVJC4RJMWT/images-8.fill.size_800x579.v1738779720.png 800w, https://lifehacker.com/imagery/articles/01HF2GY1EGKVBM56BVJC4RJMWT/images-8.fill.size_1400x1014.v1738779720.png 1400w, https://lifehacker.com/imagery/articles/01HF2GY1EGKVBM56BVJC4RJMWT/images-8.fill.size_2000x1449.v1738779720.png 2000w\" />\n            </p>\n            <p><span></span>\n                                        <span>Credit: Camelcamelcamel.com</span>\n                    </p>\n    </div>\n<p><a href=\"https://camelcamelcamel.com/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"open in a new window\">CamelCamelCamel</a> is among the best ways to track prices on Amazon products.

CamelCamelCamel shows you how the price of the item has gone up or down over time, how prices have changed through Amazon directly, and the fluctuations from third-party Amazon sellers who list new and used items.</p><p>If you sign up for a free account, you can set up alerts so the site can notify you by email when the price of an item drops below a certain amount, if you can get it used for a given price, or if it’s at an all-time low and now is a good time to buy. You can even see previous historic highs and lows and try to map out the best time to strike. </p><h2 id=\"the-best-price-tracker-for-most-online-retailers-and-to-compare-prices-honey\">The best price tracker for most online retailers and to compare prices: Honey</h2><div>\n    <p><img src=\"https://lifehacker.com/imagery/articles/01HF2GY1EGKVBM56BVJC4RJMWT/images-10.fill.size_2000x890.v1738779720.png\" alt=\"Honey price history on website\" srcset=\"https://lifehacker.com/imagery/articles/01HF2GY1EGKVBM56BVJC4RJMWT/images-10.fill.size_800x356.v1738779720.png 800w, https://lifehacker.com/imagery/articles/01HF2GY1EGKVBM56BVJC4RJMWT/images-10.fill.size_1400x623.v1738779720.png 1400w, https://lifehacker.com/imagery/articles/01HF2GY1EGKVBM56BVJC4RJMWT/images-10.fill.size_2000x890.v1738779720.png 2000w\" />\n            </p>\n            <p><span></span>\n                                        <span>Credit: Honey.com</span>\n                    </p>\n    </div>\n<p>You've probably already heard of the \"<a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/tech/honey-influencer-scam-explained\" target=\"_blank\">Honey influencer scam</a>\" that blew up in December of 2024. Essentially, Honey hijacked affiliate links from influencers who were sponsoring them. Also, in many instances, it deliberately chose not to give the best coupons to users who used the extension (going completely against its business model). Honey is not alone in this behavior. Many coupon aggregator companies hijack affiliate links; Honey just happens to be in the spotlight because it's the biggest one. Use your own judgment if you choose to use any of its services. </p><p>The bad news for those looking for a price-tracking tool that can be used for most online retailers is that Honey is the only option. The good news is that <a href=\"https://www.joinhoney.com/explore\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"open in a new window\">Honey's price-tracking tool</a> can't scam you or give you subpar coupons. The <a href=\"https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/honey-automatic-coupons-r/bmnlcjabgnpnenekpadlanbbkooimhnj?hl=en-GB\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"open in a new window\">Honey browser extension</a> compares prices from a whole bunch of retailers, not just Amazon. You can create a Droplist, which notifies you if the prices drop for an item on your list if you’re willing to wait for a deal. Here is <a href=\"https://www.lifehacker.com/everything-you-should-do-now-if-you-shop-on-black-frida-1850945998#:~:text=Use%20the%20tools%20available%20to%20you\" target=\"_blank\">what creating a Droplist can do for you</a>:</p><blockquote><p>First, it’ll keep the items you want to keep tabs on organized and easily accessible. Second, it’ll track the prices of those products and alert you when they go on sale at any major retailer. You can see how much those prices cost leading up to the sale to see if they are, in fact, good deals or a trick from retailers to take advantage of you, and even compare them with other major retailers to see who has the best deal. You can see how to set up your droplist here.﻿</p></blockquote><p>As long as you don't buy the products using a Honey link, you won't be giving money to the service. Until there's a better alternative, Honey is the only option that can instantly pull up price histories and track prices for multiple retailers with a browser extension (for now).</p><h2 id=\"the-best-tool-to-compare-prices-capital-one-shopping\">The best tool to compare prices: Capital One Shopping</h2><div>\n    <p><img src=\"https://lifehacker.com/imagery/articles/01HF2GY1EGKVBM56BVJC4RJMWT/images-17.fill.size_668x750.v1738779966.png\" alt=\"Screenshot from Amazon using the Capital One Shopping browser extension\" srcset=\"https://lifehacker.com/imagery/articles/01HF2GY1EGKVBM56BVJC4RJMWT/images-17.fill.size_800x898.v1738779966.png 800w, https://lifehacker.com/imagery/articles/01HF2GY1EGKVBM56BVJC4RJMWT/images-17.fill.size_1400x1572.v1738779966.png 1400w, https://lifehacker.com/imagery/articles/01HF2GY1EGKVBM56BVJC4RJMWT/images-17.fill.size_2000x2245.v1738779966.png 2000w\" />\n            </p>\n            <p><span></span>\n                                        <span>Credit: Amazon.com</span>\n                    </p>\n    </div>\n<p><a href=\"https://capitaloneshopping.com/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"open in a new window\">Capital One Shopping</a>, previously known as Wikibuy, compares prices from other sellers when you shop on Amazon.

If you choose to use the <a href=\"https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/capital-one-shopping-add/nenlahapcbofgnanklpelkaejcehkggg\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"open in a new window\">browser extension</a>, it will notify you if a product you are looking at is cheaper somewhere else, and offer a summary of pricing history, estimated delivery time, and total price, including tax and shipping. If you can apply a coupon, it’ll add that as well. When the price drops for a product you’ve viewed, Capital One Shopping will notify you. When you shop, you can earn credits for your purchases at some websites, like Walmart and eBay, that Capital One Shopping has partnered with. You can trade that credit for gift cards or put it toward purchases through Capital One Shopping’s site.</p><p>The extension is available for Chrome, Firefox, Edge, and Safari, and an iOS app allows you to scan barcodes and search products to do price comparisons from your phone.</p><div>\n            <p><span>\n                What do you think so far?\n            </span>\n        </p></div>\n<h2 id=\"the-best-price-tracker-tool-for-gamers-cheapshark\">The best price tracker tool for gamers: CheapShark</h2><div>\n    <p><img src=\"https://lifehacker.com/imagery/articles/01HF2GY1EGKVBM56BVJC4RJMWT/images-12.fill.size_2000x759.v1738779720.png\" alt=\"Three stores on the CheapShark website showing you discounts\" srcset=\"https://lifehacker.com/imagery/articles/01HF2GY1EGKVBM56BVJC4RJMWT/images-12.fill.size_800x304.v1738779720.png 800w, https://lifehacker.com/imagery/articles/01HF2GY1EGKVBM56BVJC4RJMWT/images-12.fill.size_1400x531.v1738779720.png 1400w, https://lifehacker.com/imagery/articles/01HF2GY1EGKVBM56BVJC4RJMWT/images-12.fill.size_2000x759.v1738779720.png 2000w\" />\n            </p>\n            <p><span></span>\n                                        <span>Credit: CheapShark.com</span>\n                    </p>\n    </div>\n<p>While most of the others in the roundup focus on products like electronics, apparel, household goods, and appliances, <a href=\"https://www.cheapshark.com/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"open in a new window\">CheapShark</a> is a great option for those looking to save money on video games. CheapShark combines all of the great places to get discounts on games in one place, one easily searchable directory and database of current prices from sites including Steam, GoG, Green Man Gaming, GameStop, Amazon, and more. Of course, it’s limited to video games, but you can search a game name not just to see how much it’ll cost you to buy, but even if you can buy it at all—and which retailer has it available. If you want, you can even filter by games currently on sale at their selected stores.</p><p>When you search for a specific game, CheapShark tells you what the cheapest-ever price was, when it hit that price, and gives you the choice to either go ahead and buy it from your choice of retailer or to sign up for a price notification if it drops again.</p><h2 id=\"honorable-mentions\">Honorable mentions</h2><h3>Keepa: Practical price-tracking tool for Amazon and eBay</h3><div>\n    <p><img src=\"https://lifehacker.com/imagery/articles/01HF2GY1EGKVBM56BVJC4RJMWT/images-13.fill.size_2000x659.v1738779720.png\" alt=\"Price history of the AirPods on Amazon\" srcset=\"https://lifehacker.com/imagery/articles/01HF2GY1EGKVBM56BVJC4RJMWT/images-13.fill.size_800x264.v1738779720.png 800w, https://lifehacker.com/imagery/articles/01HF2GY1EGKVBM56BVJC4RJMWT/images-13.fill.size_1400x462.v1738779720.png 1400w, https://lifehacker.com/imagery/articles/01HF2GY1EGKVBM56BVJC4RJMWT/images-13.fill.size_2000x659.v1738779720.png 2000w\" />\n            </p>\n            <p><span></span>\n                                        <span>Credit: Amazon.com using the Keepa browser extension</span>\n                    </p>\n    </div>\n<p><a href=\"https://keepa.com/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"open in a new window\">Keepa</a> works very similarly to Camelcamelcamel, but instead of clicking on the extension to see the price history, it'll be automatically displayed below the image of the product. This helps if clicking on the extension or installing is one click too much for you. Keepa also lets you track specific products and sends you notifications when they go below a specific price that you set. It also works on eBay. You can download the extension for Firefox, Chrome, Opera, Edge, and Safari. </p><h3>SlickDeals: Great for finding deals and checking prices</h3><p><a href=\"https://slickdeals.net/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"open in a new window\">SlickDeals</a> is known for bringing you up-to-the-minute discounts, coupons, and other deals from around the web, but its web-based price tracker is also great for watching prices on just about any item on Amazon and on a ton of other popular shopping sites, like Newegg, Gamestop, Chewy, Home Depot, and others.</p><div>\n    <p><img src=\"https://lifehacker.com/imagery/articles/01HF2GY1EGKVBM56BVJC4RJMWT/images-4.fill.size_2000x1124.v1699834131.png\" alt=\"Price history from SlickDeals for Nintendo Switch OLED\" srcset=\"https://lifehacker.com/imagery/articles/01HF2GY1EGKVBM56BVJC4RJMWT/images-4.fill.size_800x450.v1699834131.png 800w, https://lifehacker.com/imagery/articles/01HF2GY1EGKVBM56BVJC4RJMWT/images-4.fill.size_1400x787.v1699834131.png 1400w, https://lifehacker.com/imagery/articles/01HF2GY1EGKVBM56BVJC4RJMWT/images-4.fill.size_2000x1124.v1699834131.png 2000w\" />\n            </p>\n            <p><span></span>\n                                        <span>Credit: SlickDeals</span>\n                    </p>\n    </div>\n<p>The service doesn’t give you a detailed price history like some of the others in the roundup—it only shows a “deal history” under the “price intelligence” section for a few popular products. However, it will track the price of your item from when you create an alert and send you an email if the price drops below a threshold that you set. You can also return to the price tracker at any time, log in to your account, and see all of your tracked items on the same screen.</p><hr /><div>\n            <div>\n                    <p><span>Our Best Editor-Vetted Tech Deals Right Now</span></p>\n                </div>\n            <p><span>Deals are selected by our commerce team</span>\n                            </p>\n        </div>\n            </article>\n    </div>\n<div>\n    <div>\n        <p><span>The Daily Newsletter</span>\n            <span>Ready to do everything better?</span>\n        </p>\n        <p><img src=\"https://lifehacker.com/images/team/Jordan.png\" alt=\"Jordan Calhoun portrait\" />\n            <span>Jordan Calhoun\n            </span>\n            <span>Editor in chief</span>\n        </p>\n        <p><span><span>Get daily tips, tricks, <span>and tech guides</span></span> <span>from Jordan and the team.</span></span>\n    </p></div>\n    <div>\n        <p><span>The Daily Newsletter</span>\n            <span><span>Ready to do everything better?</span> <span>Get daily tips, tricks, <span>and tech guides</span></span> <span>from Jordan and the team.</span></span>\n        </p>\n    </div>\n</div>\n    </div>\n            <div>\n                <p><span>\n                        Keep Scrolling for Next Article\n                    </span>\n                </p>\n            </div>\n        </div>\n    </div>"

tech news</a></em><em>.</em></p><hr /><p>Yesterday, at its 2025 Meta Connect conference, Meta finally unveiled its <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/tech/meta-unveiled-rumored-display-style-smart-glasses?test_uuid=015ZvAUxXams0rnBpajhMg2&test_variant=A\" target=\"_blank\">first Ray-Ban smart glasses that actually have a screen</a> inside them. I have yet to try them for myself, but according to my colleagues over at CNET, <a href=\"https://www.cnet.com/tech/computing/i-wore-metas-new-ray-ban-display-glasses-and-neural-band-i-feel-augmented/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"open in a new window\">seeing is believing</a>. If you want to book a demo to try out the new Meta Ray-Ban Display glasses, you're in luck: They're popping up in select stores across the country, and you can already schedule your visit. In fact, you'll need to if you actually want to take a pair home.</p><h2 id=\"what-are-the-meta-ray-ban-display-smart-glasses\">What are the Meta Ray-Ban Display Smart Glasses?</h2><p>Meta's Ray-Ban Display smart glasses are similar to the smart glasses the two companies have already been releasing since 2021, but if the name didn't give it away already, now they have a screen inside them. This isn't AR, so you don't get head tracking or a large virtual display situated in your environment, but you do get a little heads-up 600x600 screen over your right eye that you can use to, say, check on texts or watch an Instagram Reel. It's also private, according to my colleagues over at CNET, with some clever manufacturing keeping people from seeing what's on your display through the transparent lens.</p><div>\n        <p><img src=\"https://lifehacker.com/images/short-lifehacker-logo.jpg\" alt=\"Lifehacker Logo\" /></p><div>\n            <p><span>You May Also Like</span></p>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n<p>And it comes with a special \"neural wristband\" for actually navigating content, which can pick up thumb movements, pinches, and the like and translate them into swipes and taps.</p><p>It all sounds fancy— dare I say \"innovative\"?—even if it comes with a $799 price tag (the last generation of Meta Ray-Ban smart glasses was $379). But if you're going to be dropping that much on such an unproven product, I don't blame you for wanting to go hands-on with it before buying. And it seems, neither does Meta.</p><h2 id=\"how-to-try-out-the-meta-ray-ban-display-smart-glasses\">How to try out the Meta Ray-Ban Display Smart Glasses</h2><p>Even though Meta's Ray-Ban Display Smart Glasses technically start shipping on Sept. 30, you can't buy them online. Instead, you'll have to do an in-store demo before you can actually get a pair. These demos are available at Ray-Ban stores, but also partners including LensCrafters, Sunglass Hut, and Best Buy. You can book demos straight through a specific store's site if you have a favorite, as seen on this <a href=\"https://zdcs.link/QLMOwo?pageview_type=Standard&template=News&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=Best%20Buy%20link&short_url=QLMOwo&u=https%3A%2F%2Flifehacker.com%2Ftech%2Fhow-to-demo-meta-ray-ban-display-smart-glasses&event_label=Best%20Buy%20link&split_test_identifier=015ZvAUxXams0rnBpajhMg2&split_test_variant=A\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"open in a new window\">Best Buy link</a>, but the best way to see all the demos available near you is through Meta's own site.</p><p>Just navigate to this <a href=\"https://zdcs.link/zn5P33?pageview_type=Standard&template=News&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=scheduler%20page%20on%20the%20Meta%20site&short_url=zn5P33&u=https%3A%2F%2Flifehacker.com%2Ftech%2Fhow-to-demo-meta-ray-ban-display-smart-glasses&event_label=scheduler%20page%20on%20the%20Meta%20site&split_test_identifier=015ZvAUxXams0rnBpajhMg2&split_test_variant=A\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"open in a new window\">scheduler page on the Meta site</a> and enter your address to see participating stores near you and the dates when they have demos available. Then hit \"Schedule a Demo\" on a store of your choosing to be taken to that store's site to finish booking.</p><div>\n            <p><span>\n                What do you think so far?\n            </span>\n        </p></div>\n<p>While Meta's site showed me appointments starting today, none of the stores I clicked through to had availability until October, so don't be surprised if the scheduler's data is a little behind.</p><h2 id=\"what-do-you-need-for-your-ray-ban-display-demo\">What do you need for your Ray-Ban Display Demo?</h2><p>Generally, you can just head to your Ray-Ban Display Demo and be golden. But if you wear prescription lenses, you'll either need to wear contacts or know your lens details. Meta's demo kits can accommodate a range of -4.00 to +4.00 prescriptions, so plan accordingly.</p><p>Then, it's just a matter of trying the glasses on. When you're done, you can either buy your pair, or hold off. If you wait, you'll be sent an email with details from your appointment.</p><p>Meta says it's limiting purchases to people who have tried a demo right now to ensure fit and satisfaction, but that more buying options will come \"over time.\" That's great news for folks who live outside of the U.S., as demos are currently limited to Meta's home country. However, the company says demos will expand to Canada, France, Italy, and the U.K. in early 2026.</p>\n            </article>\n    </div>\n<div>\n    <div>\n        <p><span>The Download Newsletter</span>\n            <span>Never miss a tech story</span>\n        </p>\n        <p><img src=\"https://lifehacker.com/images/team/Jake.png\" alt=\"Jake Peterson portrait\" />\n            <span>Jake Peterson\n            </span>\n            <span>Senior tech editor</span>\n        </p>\n        <p><span>Get the latest tech news, <span></span>reviews, <span></span>and advice from Jake and the team.</span>\n    </p></div>\n    <div>\n        <p><span>The Download Newsletter</span>\n            <span><span>Never miss a tech story.</span> Get the latest tech news, <span></span>reviews, <span></span>and advice from Jake and the team.</span>\n        </p>\n    </div>\n</div>\n    </div>\n            <div>\n                <p><span>\n                        Keep Scrolling for Next Article\n                    </span>\n                </p>\n            </div>\n        </div>\n    </div>"

<h2 id=\"toc\">Table of Contents</h2>\n    <article>\n        <hr />\n        <div><p>The Boox Palma e-reader is <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/tech/onyx-boox-palma-phone-ereader-review\" target=\"_blank\">unquestionably my favorite gadget from the last few years</a>, but I also get why so many people find it to be a bit confounding: It's a phone-shaped e-ink device that has all the capabilities of a modern Android smartphone, but it doesn't have cellular functionality, which means it can't take calls. </p><p>A recent rumor suggested that might be changing soon, but it turned out to be an overstatement: According to a statement I received from a spokesperson for Boox maker Onyx International, the forthcoming \"Palma 3\" (which might be called something else) still won't work as a phone, though it will have mobile data capabilities. </p></div><h2 id=\"a-palma-phone-was-rumored\">A Palma phone was rumored</h2><p>Chatter about a Palma-like device with a cellular modem kicked off in earnest a few weeks ago during IFA 2025, a European trade show akin to CES. At that event, Onyx International showed off the new device to select members of the media, and The Verge <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/news/772647/boox-palma-e-reader-e-ink-smartphone-4g-cellular\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"open in a new window\">published a story</a> surmising that the company was working on a new Palma-like device that would retain the form and e-ink display of the current Palma, but add both cellular connectivity and a color display—two of the most requested features from the device's die-hard fans, at least judging by my observations of the <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Onyx_Boox\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"open in a new window\">r/Onyx_Boox</a> subreddit over the past few years.</p><p>According to The Verge's report, though it wasn't on display on the show floor, a reporter was shown a device that sure looked a lot like the Palma, but which had both a color display (almost certainly the same Kaleido 3 screen found on the <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/tech/second-generation-boox-go-color-7-ereader-review\" target=\"_blank\">Boox Go Color 7</a>) and icons indicating a 4G cellular connection. No concrete details on specs or a release date were provided. </p><div>\n        <p><img src=\"https://lifehacker.com/images/short-lifehacker-logo.jpg\" alt=\"Lifehacker Logo\" /></p><div>\n            <p><span>You May Also Like</span></p>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n<h2 id=\"the-palma-3-will-have-mobile-data-only\">The \"Palma 3\" will have mobile data only</h2><p>I followed up with Onyx International to confirm details from the report and try to learn more, and was told, \"the device will not include calling functionality; the new Palma only supports mobile data.\" </p><p>In all likelihood, this means that the device will be comparable to a mobile tablet like a wifi + cellular iPad that can load a SIM card and connect to wireless networks, but which can't take cellular calls. Given you can install any app from the Google Play store, you'd still be able to take calls on the go using a voice-over-internet service like WhatsApp.</p><p>Currently, there is no information about what the Palma 3 might cost. For $300, the Palma 2 already has a lot of phone-like capabilities, but adding a color screen and a modem (even a data-only modem) will undoubtedly push that number higher. Tariffs aren't likely to help matters either: The Palma 2 has already increased in price from $279 to $299 in the U.S. since its launch, and given that all e-ink screens are made overseas, there's no chance it won't face additional import fees.</p><h2 id=\"theres-already-an-e-ink-phone-on-the-market\">There's already an e-ink phone on the market</h2><p>Personally, I love the Palma because it's more portable than the average e-reader, which means <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/tech/i-already-destroyed-my-summer-reading-goal-thanks-to-the-boox-palma-2\" target=\"_blank\">I read more and use addictive apps on my phone less</a> (though the Palma can run most apps, social media isn't very fun on a sluggish e-ink screen). As I still need to carry my phone, for all the usual reasons (messaging, maps, tap-to-pay), it's not the life-changing device it might otherwise be—but there's another device already on the market that could be, for the right user.</p><p>For the past few months, I've been playing around with the <a href=\"https://zdcs.link/aBDMRV?pageview_type=Standard&template=News&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=Bigme%20Hibreak%20Pro&short_url=aBDMRV&u=https%3A%2F%2Flifehacker.com%2Ftech%2Fboox-palma-phone-report&event_label=Bigme%20Hibreak%20Pro&split_test_identifier=015ZvAUxXams0rnBpajhMg2&split_test_variant=A\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"open in a new window\">Bigme Hibreak Pro</a>, a $459 e-reader that looks an awful lot like my Palma 2. In many respects, the Hibreak Pro is a one-for-one match for the Boox device (same dimensions, same e-ink screen, same app store access), but it also has 5G cellular capability. Moreover, in the wake of the Palma rumors, Bigme announced an otherwise identical version of the device with a color display—the Hibreak Pro Color—<a href=\"https://store.bigme.vip/products/bigme-hibreak-pro-color-6-e-ink-eye-friendly-smartphone-with-4g-5g-connection?variant=44992853147827\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"open in a new window\">scheduled for release in October</a>.</p><div>\n            <p><span>\n                What do you think so far?\n            </span>\n        </p></div>\n<p>A device like this holds a lot of appeal—I'm at a point where I am starting to resent my iPhone's primacy in my life. I'd love carry only one device, and one that doesn't as readily plug me in to the horrors of the internet and social media, but which can still handle the most essential functions (keeping me connected to my family, handling NFC payments, guiding me via Google Maps). </p><p>But so far, for me, the Hibreak Pro isn't it—<a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/tech/bigme-b751c-color-e-reader-review\" target=\"_blank\">as with other Bigme devices I've tested</a>, I find its software deeply frustrating, and I haven't had the time or energy to devote to installing an alternative launcher. (It doesn't help that the first device I received had a faulty USB-C port, and getting a replacement took a few months.) I generally think Boox makes better devices and less frustrating software than Bigme, so I was initially intrigued at the concept of a Palma phone. Alas.</p><h2 id=\"e-ink-phones-will-always-be-niche-devices\">E-ink phones will always be niche devices</h2><p>Even if the new Palma was able to make calls, it would still be a device with limited appeal. Despite their lovability, Boox's e-readers definitely aren't as user-friendly as a Kindle. And though the Palma has attracted a cult following (not to mention mainstream attention from outlets like The New York Times), an e-ink phone will always come with drawbacks that make it very unlikely we'll see one from an established tech company like Apple or Samsung. Then there's the matter of carrier support—you certainly wouldn't be able to buy a Palma phone direct from Verizon or T-Mobile, and it's not a sure thing that a Chinese-made niche device would play nice with every domestic carrier. </p><p>That's all to say: An e-ink phone might satisfy some diehards seeking a respite from their device addiction, but I wouldn't expect to see too many of them while riding the subway.</p>\n            </article>\n    </div>\n<div>\n    <div>\n        <p><span>The Download Newsletter</span>\n            <span>Never miss a tech story</span>\n        </p>\n        <p><img src=\"https://lifehacker.com/images/team/Jake.png\" alt=\"Jake Peterson portrait\" />\n            <span>Jake Peterson\n            </span>\n            <span>Senior tech editor</span>\n        </p>\n        <p><span>Get the latest tech news, <span></span>reviews, <span></span>and advice from Jake and the team.</span>\n    </p></div>\n    <div>\n        <p><span>The Download Newsletter</span>\n            <span><span>Never miss a tech story.</span> Get the latest tech news, <span></span>reviews, <span></span>and advice from Jake and the team.</span>\n        </p>\n    </div>\n</div>\n    </div>\n            <div>\n                <p><span>\n                        Keep Scrolling for Next Article\n                    </span>\n                </p>\n            </div>\n        </div>\n    </div>"

href=\"https://lifehacker.com/tech/best-gaming-laptops?test_uuid=015ZvAUxXams0rnBpajhMg2&test_variant=B\" target=\"_blank\"><u>it’s gaming</u></a>. But if there’s another area, it’s display technology. Yep, while Apple still stands behind its trademark LCD “retina” displays, Windows machines have been adopting OLED and touchscreens for years now. Luckily, according to industry experts, MacBook owners will soon be able to plan on having better screens, too.</p><p>The latest rumors come courtesy of TF International Securities analyst Ming-Chi Kuo, as well as Bloomberg’s Mark Gurman, both of whom have reliable track records reporting on Apple products. While this <a href=\"http://bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-01-11/apple-working-on-adding-touch-screens-to-macs-in-major-turnabout?sref=9hGJlFio\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"open in a new window\"><u>isn’t the first time</u></a> Apple has been rumored to be updating its laptop displays, we’ve now got a timeline update. </p><div>\n        <p><img src=\"https://lifehacker.com/images/short-lifehacker-logo.jpg\" alt=\"Lifehacker Logo\" /></p><div>\n            <p><span>You May Also Like</span></p>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n<p>According to a <a href=\"https://x.com/mingchikuo/status/1968249865940709538\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"open in a new window\"><u>post Kuo made to X on Sept. 17</u></a>, the MacBook Pro will be the first MacBook to receive an OLED update, and as a bonus, the new screen will also support touch. The upgraded model is “expected to enter mass production by late 2026,” although as is par for the course with these leaks, the post didn’t point to any particular sources to back this up. However, if you read between the lines and look at Kuo’s past <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/tech/everything-we-know-about-the-upcoming-iphone-17-series\" target=\"_blank\">spot-on speculations</a>, it’s likely an anonymous source from within Apple.</p><p>For a little bit of assurance, Gurman, who also frequently relies on such sources, was quick to agree with Kuo’s assertions in his <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2025-09-21/mark-gurman-s-iphone-17-first-impressions-touchscreen-macbook-pro-meta-glasses?cmpid=BBD092125_POWERON&utm_medium=email&utm_source=newsletter&utm_term=250921&utm_campaign=poweron\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"open in a new window\"><u>weekly Power On newsletter</u></a> this weekend, pointing to his original reporting on the topic from 2023. However, the reporter also added that the actual release date might be closer to early 2027, depending on how quickly Apple can get supply out. He also clarified that, technically, the revamp was planned for this year, but was moved back “due to OLED supply issues.”</p><p>As for the rest of Apple’s MacBook line, neither expert has updates on that end, although Gurman speculates that “if touch resonates on the MacBook Pro, I expect it to eventually come to other Macs as well.”</p><p>While the benefits behind a touchscreen laptop are fairly self explanatory, OLED is higher on my personal wishlist. The technology’s self-illuminating pixels will help with contrast, yes, <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/tech/extend-iphone-air-battery-life\" target=\"_blank\"><u>but like on the iPhone</u></a>, they should also aid with battery life. That’s because, while current MacBooks rely on a backlight that spans the entire display, parts of an OLED screen can remain off when not in use.</p><div>\n            <p><span>\n                What do you think so far?\n            </span>\n        </p></div>\n<p>It’s notable that Kuo and Gurman’s proposed timeline also matches with the release of the <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/tech/new-ipad-rumors?test_uuid=015ZvAUxXams0rnBpajhMg2&test_variant=B\" target=\"_blank\"><u>iPad Pro just last year</u></a>, which upgraded to an OLED screen for the first time. Given that iPadOS 26 also <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/tech/ipados-26-basically-turns-your-ipad-into-macbook-wwdc-2025?test_uuid=015ZvAUxXams0rnBpajhMg2&test_variant=B\" target=\"_blank\"><u>revamped the iPad user experience to be much more like using a MacBook</u></a>, it’s likely Apple is currently planning for more parity between its product categories.</p><p>On that note, Kuo’s post also reminded readers that a <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/tech/apple-affordable-macbook-rumors\" target=\"_blank\"><u>potential lower-cost MacBook that uses an iPhone processor</u></a> could be in the works for later this year, although specifics are still largely in the dark at this point. The analyst, however, did say this model would likely not include touch support, although that could change in the future.</p><p>As for other rumored Apple products, also still largely in the dark is a potential foldable iPhone, which Gurman says “will be the star of Apple’s 2026 product lineup.” As <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/tech/everything-that-the-iphone-air-tells-us-about-the-iphone-fold\" target=\"_blank\"><u>predicted by my colleague David Nield</u></a>, the reporter’s sources are increasingly telling him that “users should imagine two titanium iPhone Airs side-by-side,” but pricing and release date specifics are still up to the imagination for now.</p>\n            </article>\n    </div>\n<div>\n    <div>\n        <p><span>The Download Newsletter</span>\n            <span>Never miss a tech story</span>\n        </p>\n        <p><img src=\"https://lifehacker.com/images/team/Jake.png\" alt=\"Jake Peterson portrait\" />\n            <span>Jake Peterson\n            </span>\n            <span>Senior tech editor</span>\n        </p>\n        <p><span>Get the latest tech news, <span></span>reviews, <span></span>and advice from Jake and the team.</span>\n    </p></div>\n    <div>\n        <p><span>The Download Newsletter</span>\n            <span><span>Never miss a tech story.</span> Get the latest tech news, <span></span>reviews, <span></span>and advice from Jake and the team.</span>\n        </p>\n    </div>\n</div>\n    </div>\n            <div>\n                <p><span>\n                        Keep Scrolling for Next Article\n                    </span>\n                </p>\n            </div>\n        </div>\n    </div>"

Understandably, this is not necessarily something everyone wants to do every time they visit an adult site.</p><p>In response, Pornhub, as well as other sites under its parent company Aylo, have <a href=\"https://mashable.com/article/pornhub-blocked-states-2025\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"open in a new window\">gone dark in some of these states in protest</a>. As such, many users across these states are now searching for the best VPNs (virtual private networks) to install on their devices so they can still access the site.</p><h2 id=\"what-states-have-blocked-pornhub\">What states have blocked PornHub?</h2><p>As of the end of September 2025, 24 states have put these age verification requirements in place: Louisiana, Utah, Mississippi, Virginia, Arkansas, North Dakota, Texas, Montana, North Carolina, Idaho, Kansas, Kentucky, Georgia, Nebraska, Indiana, Alabama, South Dakota, Arizona, Wyoming, Oklahoma, Florida, South Carolina, Tennessee, and Missouri.</p><div>\n        <p><img src=\"https://lifehacker.com/images/short-lifehacker-logo.jpg\" alt=\"Lifehacker Logo\" /></p><div>\n            <p><span>You May Also Like</span></p>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n<p>Additionally, an age verification bill has passed in Ohio, effective Sept. 29, 2025.</p><p>Bills are also pending in an <em>additional</em> 14 states: Oregon, Nevada, New Mexico, Minnesota, Iowa, Wisconsin, Illinois, Michigan, West Virginia, Pennsylvania, New York, New Jersey, Hawaii, and Maryland. State-level legislation aside, <a href=\"https://www.congress.gov/bill/119th-congress/senate-bill/737/text\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"open in a new window\">the federal SCREEN Act (2025) could bring in country-wide measures</a> if it passes into law. Further, the <a href=\"https://mashable.com/article/supreme-court-age-verification-decision-scotus\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"open in a new window\">Supreme Court has upheld Texas' age verification law</a>, setting a precedent that could impact attempts to challenge these laws in the future.</p><div><p>It's a shifting landscape, as laws are proposed and appealed in each state, and the best resources for keeping up to date that I've found are from the <a href=\"https://avpassociation.com/4271-2/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"open in a new window\">Age Verification Providers Association</a> (which is pro-age verification measures) and the <a href=\"https://action.freespeechcoalition.com/age-verification-bills/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"open in a new window\">Free Speech Coalition</a> (which is against them). </p><p>On one side is the argument that kids need to be protected from adult content online, and on the other is the argument that free speech is paramount and kids will find porn anyway—perhaps through sites that have fewer safeguards and rules around adult content than Pornhub.</p></div><h2 id=\"the-louisiana-exception\">The Louisiana exception</h2><div>\n    <p><img src=\"https://lifehacker.com/imagery/articles/01JWXSQX0KG9KBKARRSGFA13YP/images-1.fill.size_2000x1125.v1749051765.jpg\" alt=\"LA Wallet\" srcset=\"https://lifehacker.com/imagery/articles/01JWXSQX0KG9KBKARRSGFA13YP/images-1.fill.size_800x450.v1749051765.jpg 800w, https://lifehacker.com/imagery/articles/01JWXSQX0KG9KBKARRSGFA13YP/images-1.fill.size_1400x788.v1749051765.jpg 1400w, https://lifehacker.com/imagery/articles/01JWXSQX0KG9KBKARRSGFA13YP/images-1.fill.size_2000x1125.v1749051765.jpg 2000w\" />\n            </p>\n            <p><span>Pornhub can use LA Wallet in Louisiana.</span>\n                                        <span>Credit: Lifehacker</span>\n                    </p>\n    </div>\n<p>Pornhub owner Aylo's issues with all of this legislation are that age verification systems are ineffective, and an invasion of privacy for those aged 18 or over. Instead, the company is calling for user ages to be verified at the device level, perhaps through the app stores managed by Apple and Google, for example. Lawmakers in Texas <a href=\"https://www.statesman.com/story/news/state/2025/06/04/texas-age-verification-bill-explainer-apple-google-app-stores/83995434007/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"open in a new window\">have already passed legislation requiring app stores to verify ages before users can download <em>any</em> apps</a>, not just ones with age-restricted content.</p><p>Louisiana stands out as the one state where Aylo sites, including Pornhub, are cooperating with an age verification system to keep adult content available to users. That system is known as LA Wallet, the digital driver license app that's already active in Louisiana, and which provides robust ID verification. One of the reasons Aylo has kept Pornhub open for business in Louisiana is that LA Wallet can work anonymously: It's a bit like using a two-factor authentication code. Through this mechanism, Pornhub doesn't know who you are, but does know you've been verified as an adult through LA Wallet.</p><p>For now, other states are lagging in introducing similar tech. They either don't have digital ID systems like LA Wallet, or have systems that aren't as simple to use for the purpose, or as respectful towards user privacy. And so the stand-off continues: Both state governments and Aylo want users to have to verify their age to access Pornhub, they just want to go about it in different ways.</p><h2 id=\"how-to-watch-pornhub-if-its-blocked-in-your-state\">How to watch Pornhub if it's blocked in your state</h2><p>Whatever your position on age verification laws, remember that the best VPNs can connect your computer to a server in a different part of the world—making it look like you're located somewhere other than where you actually are. So wherever you are, if you want to access porn sites that are blocked, a VPN is your new best friend.</p><p>That's just the start, though, when it comes to <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/tech/what-is-a-vpn\" target=\"_blank\">the benefits of installing a VPN</a>. These software tools hide your browsing activity from governments, law enforcement agencies, and whoever is providing your internet connection. Generally, VPNs make it harder for companies to track you, and give you more security and privacy (though not total anonymity) online.</p><div>\n            <p><span>\n                What do you think so far?\n            </span>\n        </p></div>\n<p>With that in mind, Lifehacker has covered the best free VPNs, the best paid VPNs, and the best free VPNs for Android in the past, but I'd like to highlight a couple of recommendations here—if you want more suggestions for your internet browsing needs (adult site-related or not), follow those links above.</p><h2 id=\"the-best-free-vpn-proton-vpn\">The best free VPN: Proton VPN</h2><div>\n    <p><img src=\"https://lifehacker.com/imagery/articles/01JWXSQX0KG9KBKARRSGFA13YP/images-2.fill.size_2000x1125.v1749051765.jpg\" alt=\"Proton VPN on a laptop\" srcset=\"https://lifehacker.com/imagery/articles/01JWXSQX0KG9KBKARRSGFA13YP/images-2.fill.size_800x450.v1749051765.jpg 800w, https://lifehacker.com/imagery/articles/01JWXSQX0KG9KBKARRSGFA13YP/images-2.fill.size_1400x788.v1749051765.jpg 1400w, https://lifehacker.com/imagery/articles/01JWXSQX0KG9KBKARRSGFA13YP/images-2.fill.size_2000x1125.v1749051765.jpg 2000w\" />\n            </p>\n            <p><span>Proton VPN doesn't put any bandwidth restrictions on free accounts.</span>\n                                        <span>Credit: Proton</span>\n                    </p>\n    </div>\n<p>We've <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/tech/review-of-proton-vpn-free-tier\" target=\"_blank\">written in glowing terms</a> before about how good the free Proton VPN is, and it's a great pick if you don't want to spend anything. Its appeal starts with Proton itself: It's committed to privacy, was started by scientists in Switzerland, and is siloed from the big tech names (like Google, Apple, Amazon, and Microsoft). It's a name you can trust.</p><p>There are also surprisingly few restrictions for a free VPN. The two main limitations are you can only connect from one device, and you don't get to choose which country's servers you connect to. That's it—it's not painfully slow, like a lot of free VPNs. If you do need more flexibility in your VPN connections and features, there are paid upgrades available too.</p><p>Add in the ease of use you get with Proton VPN, the support for a broad range of devices, and the reliability you get from servers around the world, and it's difficult to beat in terms of a free VPN. <a href=\"https://protonvpn.com/l/vpn-home-plans-offer?url_id=0&utm_campaign=ww-all-2c-vpn-gro_aff-g_acq-partners_program&utm_source=aid-tune-1156&utm_medium=link&utm_term=vpn_home_plans_offer_hfp_landing&utm_content=26&phfp=true\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"open in a new window\">Sign up here</a> for a Proton account, if you don't already have one.</p><h2 id=\"the-best-paid-vpn-nordvpn\">The best paid VPN: NordVPN</h2><div>\n    <p><img src=\"https://lifehacker.com/imagery/articles/01JWXSQX0KG9KBKARRSGFA13YP/images-3.fill.size_2000x1125.v1749051765.jpg\" alt=\"NordVPN on a laptop\" srcset=\"https://lifehacker.com/imagery/articles/01JWXSQX0KG9KBKARRSGFA13YP/images-3.fill.size_800x450.v1749051765.jpg 800w, https://lifehacker.com/imagery/articles/01JWXSQX0KG9KBKARRSGFA13YP/images-3.fill.size_1400x788.v1749051765.jpg 1400w, https://lifehacker.com/imagery/articles/01JWXSQX0KG9KBKARRSGFA13YP/images-3.fill.size_2000x1125.v1749051765.jpg 2000w\" />\n            </p>\n            <p><span>You can connect to more than 100 different countries with NordVPN</span>\n                                        <span>Credit: NordVPN</span>\n                    </p>\n    </div>\n<p>You've got a lot of excellent options to pick from when it comes to paid VPNs, and there's no app that's far and away above the others—but we're going to highlight NordVPN here, which <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/tech/nordvpn-vs-expressvpn\" target=\"_blank\">we recently compared to ExpressVPN</a>. It's fast, it's flexible, and the software it offers across multiple platforms is more polished and intuitive than with a lot of its rivals.</p><p>You get lots of features with NordVPN, from split tunneling to DNS customizations to support for the super-private Onion network. While you can easily use the software with just a couple of clicks (or taps), there are numerous advanced features available if you want to dig a bit deeper—you can even have a dedicated IP address (though it costs extra).</p><p>Pricing for NordVPN starts at $12.99 a month, but you can get some pretty significant discounts if you pay for a year (or two years) up front.
