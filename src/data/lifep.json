Now, with iOS 26, Apple and Beats are introducing some new fitness features that make these headphones work better as heart rate sensors. They also apply to the new  <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/tech/airpods-pro-3-are-more-forgiving-for-the-tine-eared\" target=\"_blank\"><u>AirPods Pro 3</u></a>, which also measure heart rate. I tested the new features, and found that the experience is much improved—but still has serious problems. </p><h2 id=\"the-heart-rate-feature-now-works-on-iphones-without-third-party-apps\">The heart rate feature now works on iPhones without third-party apps</h2><p>This is the biggest improvement, and it’s unquestionably a good thing. In iOS 26, <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/health/ios-26-gives-the-iphone-a-real-fitness-app\" target=\"_blank\"><u>Apple has turned the Fitness app</u></a> into a real workout-tracking app, not just a viewer for Apple Watch data. And it can pull heart rate data from Powerbeats or AirPods with heart rate sensors.</p>\n<p>Just tap the Workout tab, check the heart rate icon in the upper right corner to make sure your Powerbeats are paired, and hit the start button on the activity you want to do. It’s easy and simple—as it should have been in the first place. </p><p>Previously, iPhones could only read heart rate data from the Powerbeats Pro 2 through certain third-party apps. These apps included a few popular premium and specialty apps, like Runna and Peloton, but there was no basic option. Now, with the updates to the Fitness app, you can log a workout that is <em>just</em> a native Apple workout, without having to create an account on a new app. </p><p>None of this was ever an issue for Android users, by the way: They were always able to pair the Powerbeats Pro 2 as a Bluetooth heart rate sensor the way you would a chest strap, and can still do that. Unfortunately, iPhone users still don’t have that kind of freedom. Only <em>some</em> apps are supported—16 of them so far, which are listed <a href=\"https://www.beatsbydre.com/heart-rate-monitoring\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"open in a new window\"><u>here</u></a>—but at least the main Fitness app is one of them.</p><h2 id=\"you-can-now-use-a-single-earbud-sort-of\">You can now use a single earbud (sort of)</h2><p>At first, the Powerbeats Pro 2 could only read your heart rate if you had both earbuds in. With the changes in iOS 26, you can now get heart rate readings with just a single earbud. I tried this out, with mixed results. </p><p>On the bright side, it’s true—the Fitness app gives me heart rate data even with only one earbud in. But the downside is that accuracy is diminished. The earbuds already have an accuracy issue, as I’ll discuss below, so they lose data points when the fit isn’t perfect. Remove one earbud, and you’re taking away half your data. </p><p>This is good news for people who get a good fit and good accuracy; they can choose between one and two earbuds and get a heart rate reading either way. But for those of us who can’t get a good enough fit to get good data (like me), this just gives us <em>worse</em> data.</p><h2 id=\"the-algorithm-is-better-but-maybe-not-good-enough\">The algorithm is better, but maybe not good enough</h2><div>\n    <p><img src=\"https://lifehacker.com/imagery/articles/01K5Y6JM0ASGXR0B5CR3REF976/images-1.fill.size_2000x1125.v1758728900.png\" alt=\"Graph of heart rate with both earbuds (ok) and one earbud (terrible)\" srcset=\"https://lifehacker.com/imagery/articles/01K5Y6JM0ASGXR0B5CR3REF976/images-1.fill.size_800x450.v1758728900.png 800w, https://lifehacker.com/imagery/articles/01K5Y6JM0ASGXR0B5CR3REF976/images-1.fill.size_1400x788.v1758728900.png 1400w, https://lifehacker.com/imagery/articles/01K5Y6JM0ASGXR0B5CR3REF976/images-1.fill.size_2000x1125.v1758728900.png 2000w\" />\n            </p>\n            <p><span>Powerbeats Pro 2 in orange; chest strap (for reference) in black,</span>\n                                        <span>Credit: Beth Skwarecki</span>\n                    </p>\n    </div>\n<p>Apple has said that its new heart-rate-sensing algorithm is able to sample data points faster, which should help accuracy. It can also combine data from the headphones and from your Apple Watch, rather than choosing one or the other. (Previously, if you were wearing your Apple Watch, heart rate data from your earbuds would be ignored). </p><p>I took the earbuds for a few test runs (without the Apple Watch) to try the new algorithm. I do think the accuracy is a little bit improved! It’s still not great, but as long as I had both earbuds in, I can at least see the similarity between my chest strap data and what I was getting from the Powerbeats. </p><p>It still tended to read high for me, though—often riding above the peaks of my intervals and never dropping down very far. This isn’t good enough to follow <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/what-are-heart-rate-zones-and-how-can-you-find-yours-1848061616\" target=\"_blank\"><u>heart rate zone training</u></a> very closely, and would likely skew heart-rate-based metrics such as <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/health/tested-vo2max-compared-to-fitness-wearables\" target=\"_blank\"><u>estimated VO2max</u></a>. But it does seem to be an improvement. </p><p>My single-earbud readings were awful, though, as you can see. To Apple’s credit, I did get a poor fit notification after both the runs that produced the graphs above.</p><div>\n            <p><span>\n                What do you think so far?\n            </span>\n        </p></div>\n<h2 id=\"new-fit-notification\">New fit notification </h2><p>A new feature in iOS 26 is that you’ll get a notification to check the fit of your earbuds if the data seemed to be poor. That’s a helpful feature, because otherwise you wouldn’t know whether you’re getting good data or not. (<em>I</em> sit down at my computer and compare new devices to chest strap data, but it’s not fair to expect everyone to do that.) </p><p>Based on my experience, the Powerbeats’ issue with heart rate accuracy seems to be tied to the way they fit in your ears. The optical heart rate sensor is built into the hard plastic component, and it needs to be in close contact with your skin to be able to detect your pulse. </p><p>The earbuds come with different silicone tips to adjust the fit, and an “ear tip fit test” you can do in Settings to ensure that you get a good seal between your tip and your ears. If you get the notification telling you to check your fit, it directs you to this test and its associated advice about getting a good fit. </p><p>But there’s still a big problem here. Apple assumes that a good fit for sound is the same as a good fit for heart rate. That’s not always the case, as <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/health/powerbeats-pro-2-track-your-heart-rate-from-your-ears-but-not-very-well\" target=\"_blank\"><u>my own testing</u></a> showed. When I passed the fit test, I got terrible heart rate data. If I turned the earbuds backward so the ear hooks were vertical, I got good heart rate data but terrible sound quality—and failed the fit test.</p><p>So these notifications can tell you that you have a problem, but they can’t <em>solve</em> your problem. I suspect it’s not really solvable. The plastic component only comes in one size, and if your ears are a different size or shape than what it was designed for, there’s no way to put the sensor in closer contact with your ears. </p><h2 id=\"iphone-users-still-cant-play-music-while-broadcasting-heart-rate-to-gym-equipment\">iPhone users still can’t play music while broadcasting heart rate to gym equipment </h2><p>I almost feel embarrassed for Apple on this one. The Powerbeats Pro 2 can broadcast your heart rate data to gym equipment, but <em>not while playing music</em>. This still feels half-baked and I hope Apple is working on a fix for this. For now, here’s what you can expect: </p><ul><li><p>Android users can play music from their phone while broadcasting to gym equipment.</p></li><li><p>Gym equipment that plays sound over bluetooth can play to your Powerbeats while you broadcast heart rate to that same gym equipment.</p></li><li><p>iPhone users cannot play music from their iPhone while broadcasting to gym equipment. </p></li></ul><p>Overall, I'm pleased to see the changes Apple has made to improve the usefulness and accuracy of the Powerbeats Pro 2's heart rate monitoring feature, but I'm still disappointed in some of the ways it fails to live up to its promises. These are expensive headphones to buy without knowing whether they'll fit your ears well enough to get reliable heart rate data. The missing music when broadcasting to gym equipment is especially disappointing. But the fit notifications are a great addition so that at least people know when they're having accuracy issues, and I appreciate the more accurate data sampling—even if the result isn't perfect.</p>\n            </article>"

/><p>Before you sit down to study or get started on a big project for work, you might want to consider hitting the gym or taking a brisk walk. Besides just generally being good for your health, research also shows it can actually help with cognition. And with, say, the start of a new semester bearing down upon you or a work deadline looming, anything that can give you a brain boost is likely welcome. </p><h2 id=\"what-the-research-says-about-exercise-and-studying\">What the research says about exercise and studying</h2><p>There’s no shortage of solid, peer-reviewed research on the effect of exercise on cognition, going back <a href=\"https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Phillip-Tomporowski/publication/10893216_Effects_of_acute_bouts_of_exercise_on_cognition/links/5d9b7b95a6fdccfd0e81034e/Effects-of-acute-bouts-of-exercise-on-cognition.pdf?_sg%5B0%5D=started_experiment_milestone&origin=journalDetail&_rtd=e30%3D\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"open in a new window\">decades</a>. There's just a shortage on explanations. The exact reasons that exercise helps thinking aren’t fully understood, but <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5934999/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"open in a new window\">one 2018 review in <em>Frontiers in Psychology</em></a> discusses evidence that it may increase blood flow to the brain, boost levels of certain neurotransmitters, and increase your feelings of control and self-esteem. Purely anecdotally, I think that's true. When I leave the gym in the morning, I feel like I've already accomplished something and tend to be a little more of a go-getter at work, riding my smug little wave to continue the day's productive streak. </p><div>\n        <p><img src=\"https://lifehacker.com/images/short-lifehacker-logo.jpg\" alt=\"Lifehacker Logo\" /></p><div>\n            <p><span>You May Also Like</span></p>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3951958/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"open in a new window\">Another review</a>, from 2013, notes that “more active” individuals are better able to pay attention to their surroundings and process information more quickly.

A “single bout” of this kind of movement is related to improved cognitive functions, according to the researchers in <em>Frontiers</em>.</p><div>\n            <p><span>\n                What do you think so far?\n            </span>\n        </p></div>\n<p>So, before you sit down to study, plan your week, or have an important conversation with your boss, consider swimming, biking, jogging, running, hopping on the elliptical, or taking a brisk walk around the block. You want to get in some solid cardio here, even if it is as simple as biking to work or taking your lunch break at the gym. (<a href=\"https://www.lifehacker.com/how-much-exercise-do-i-really-need-1823708126\" target=\"_blank\">Here’s a guide to how much exercise you need</a> each week, in general.)</p><h2 id=\"how-to-make-time-to-work-out\">How to make time to work out</h2><p>I know it's hard to find time to work out, especially if you're a stressed-out student—but that makes it all the more important you do carve out some time for taking care of your body, regardless of the effect it has on your mind. Taking into account that it could make you a <em>better</em> student, it practically becomes non-negotiable. </p><p>If getting to the gym, the bike path, or the rec center truly isn't feasible, there is plenty you can do from the comfort of home or your dorm room. Since we're looking to get the heart rate up here, focus on cardio, to the extent possible in your space. <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/health/the-best-free-cardio-workout-channels-on-youtube\" target=\"_blank\">YouTube is full of great follow-along workout videos</a> that can get blood pumping, for instance. I'd also recommend having a designated workout app to guide you. I'm <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/health/peloton-app-review\" target=\"_blank\">partial to Peloton's app</a>, but while that app has all kinds of class types from <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/health/peloton-class-with-no-peloton-bike\" target=\"_blank\">cycling</a> to <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/health/peloton-guided-walk-workouts-recommendation\" target=\"_blank\">walking</a> to <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/health/pelotons-yoga-offerings-are-surprisingly-robust\" target=\"_blank\">yoga</a>, it can also cost up to $44 a month, making it a little difficult to maintain for a student. As a free alternative, you can try <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/health/nike-training-club-app-review\" target=\"_blank\">Nike Training Club</a>, which has similar classes you can follow along with from home. Check with your university's student center about what's available, too. Schools offer all kinds of wellness-focused resources, from fitness apps to on-campus recreational centers. In grad school, I taught spin classes in my university's rec center that were free for other students to attend—and, true to the research, I always noticed a little cognitive boost when I did it right before class. </p>\n            </article>\n    </div>\n<div>\n    <div>\n        <p><span>The Daily Newsletter</span>\n            <span>Ready to do everything better?</span>\n        </p>\n        <p><img src=\"https://lifehacker.com/images/team/Jordan.png\" alt=\"Jordan Calhoun portrait\" />\n            <span>Jordan Calhoun\n            </span>\n            <span>Editor in chief</span>\n        </p>\n        <p><span><span>Get daily tips, tricks, <span>and tech guides</span></span> <span>from Jordan and the team.</span></span>\n    </p></div>\n    <div>\n        <p><span>The Daily Newsletter</span>\n            <span><span>Ready to do everything better?</span> <span>Get daily tips, tricks, <span>and tech guides</span></span> <span>from Jordan and the team.</span></span>\n        </p>\n    </div>\n</div>\n    </div>\n            <div>\n                <p><span>\n                        Keep Scrolling for Next Article\n                    </span>\n                </p>\n            </div>\n        </div>\n    </div>"

href=\"https://lifehacker.com/tech/best-gaming-laptops?test_uuid=015ZvAUxXams0rnBpajhMg2&test_variant=B\" target=\"_blank\"><u>it’s gaming</u></a>. But if there’s another area, it’s display technology. Yep, while Apple still stands behind its trademark LCD “retina” displays, Windows machines have been adopting OLED and touchscreens for years now. Luckily, according to industry experts, MacBook owners will soon be able to plan on having better screens, too.</p><p>The latest rumors come courtesy of TF International Securities analyst Ming-Chi Kuo, as well as Bloomberg’s Mark Gurman, both of whom have reliable track records reporting on Apple products. While this <a href=\"http://bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-01-11/apple-working-on-adding-touch-screens-to-macs-in-major-turnabout?sref=9hGJlFio\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"open in a new window\"><u>isn’t the first time</u></a> Apple has been rumored to be updating its laptop displays, we’ve now got a timeline update. </p><div>\n        <p><img src=\"https://lifehacker.com/images/short-lifehacker-logo.jpg\" alt=\"Lifehacker Logo\" /></p><div>\n            <p><span>You May Also Like</span></p>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n<p>According to a <a href=\"https://x.com/mingchikuo/status/1968249865940709538\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"open in a new window\"><u>post Kuo made to X on Sept. 17</u></a>, the MacBook Pro will be the first MacBook to receive an OLED update, and as a bonus, the new screen will also support touch. The upgraded model is “expected to enter mass production by late 2026,” although as is par for the course with these leaks, the post didn’t point to any particular sources to back this up. However, if you read between the lines and look at Kuo’s past <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/tech/everything-we-know-about-the-upcoming-iphone-17-series\" target=\"_blank\">spot-on speculations</a>, it’s likely an anonymous source from within Apple.</p><p>For a little bit of assurance, Gurman, who also frequently relies on such sources, was quick to agree with Kuo’s assertions in his <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2025-09-21/mark-gurman-s-iphone-17-first-impressions-touchscreen-macbook-pro-meta-glasses?cmpid=BBD092125_POWERON&utm_medium=email&utm_source=newsletter&utm_term=250921&utm_campaign=poweron\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"open in a new window\"><u>weekly Power On newsletter</u></a> this weekend, pointing to his original reporting on the topic from 2023. However, the reporter also added that the actual release date might be closer to early 2027, depending on how quickly Apple can get supply out. He also clarified that, technically, the revamp was planned for this year, but was moved back “due to OLED supply issues.”</p><p>As for the rest of Apple’s MacBook line, neither expert has updates on that end, although Gurman speculates that “if touch resonates on the MacBook Pro, I expect it to eventually come to other Macs as well.”</p><p>While the benefits behind a touchscreen laptop are fairly self explanatory, OLED is higher on my personal wishlist. The technology’s self-illuminating pixels will help with contrast, yes, <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/tech/extend-iphone-air-battery-life\" target=\"_blank\"><u>but like on the iPhone</u></a>, they should also aid with battery life.

It doesn't help that I 1) live above a noisy Brooklyn bar and 2) share a bed with someone who snores and grinds his teeth. My go-to solution had been wearing my <a href=\"https://zdcs.link/a01KDr?pageview_type=Standard&template=Explainers&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=Anker%20Soundcore%20headphones&short_url=a01KDr&u=https%3A%2F%2Flifehacker.com%2Ftech%2Fozlo-sleepbuds-review&event_label=Anker%20Soundcore%20headphones\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"open in a new window\">Anker Soundcore headphones</a> with some sort of \"deep sleep\" playlist, but to be honest, sleeping with over-ear headphones is like trying to nap while wearing a helmet. Uncomfortable, potentially unsafe, and a surefire way to destroy my expensive electronics.</p><p>That's what led me to the Ozlo Sleepbuds, <a href=\"https://zdcs.link/Qp4Vng?pageview_type=Standard&template=Explainers&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=currently%20available%20for%20%24299&short_url=Qp4Vng&u=https%3A%2F%2Flifehacker.com%2Ftech%2Fozlo-sleepbuds-review&event_label=currently%20available%20for%20%24299\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"open in a new window\">currently available for $299</a>. Unlike my <a href=\"https://zdcs.link/aN8XnV?pageview_type=Standard&template=Explainers&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=AirPod%20Pros&short_url=aN8XnV&u=https%3A%2F%2Flifehacker.com%2Ftech%2Fozlo-sleepbuds-review&event_label=AirPod%20Pros\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"open in a new window\">AirPod Pros</a>, which are great for daily use but pierce my eardrums when I lie on my side, the Ozlo sleepbuds have a remarkably low profile. The pre-installed ear tips fit perfectly, creating a secure seal without the pressure points that make traditional earbuds a nightmare for side sleepers. Despite their <a href=\"https://casabona.org/2025/01/ozlo-sleepbuds-review/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"open in a new window\">mixed</a> online reviews, I've found that these smart earplugs really do help me sleep deeper (and possibly saved my relationship).</p>\n<h2 id=\"the-app-experience\">The app experience</h2><p>Here's where the Ozlo sleepbuds diverge from typical wireless earbuds, and honestly, it's a double-edged sword. Unlike AirPods that connect automatically via Bluetooth, these require opening the Ozlo app like a control center. You'll need to select your soundscape, adjust volume, and set your alarm through the app interface.</p><div>\n    <p><img src=\"https://lifehacker.com/imagery/articles/01K5S72NBMBKD6972CACS3XRXK/images-1.fill.size_2000x1125.v1758561654.png\" alt=\"Ozlo app screenshots\" srcset=\"https://lifehacker.com/imagery/articles/01K5S72NBMBKD6972CACS3XRXK/images-1.fill.size_800x450.v1758561654.png 800w, https://lifehacker.com/imagery/articles/01K5S72NBMBKD6972CACS3XRXK/images-1.fill.size_1400x788.v1758561654.png 1400w, https://lifehacker.com/imagery/articles/01K5S72NBMBKD6972CACS3XRXK/images-1.fill.size_2000x1125.v1758561654.png 2000w\" />\n            </p>\n            <p><span>Setting up my Ozlo sleepbuds.</span>\n                                        <span>Credit: Meredith Dietz</span>\n                    </p>\n    </div>\n<p>Initially, this felt clunky compared to the seamless connectivity we're all used to. But after a few nights, I found myself positively reframing this friction as more of a \"ritual.\" Opening the app, placing the buds in my ears, and selecting a soundscape became a bedtime ritual that signaled to my brain it was time to wind down. </p><h2 id=\"wearing-my-sleepbuds-through-the-night\">Wearing my sleepbuds through the night</h2><p>The moment of truth came on my first night testing them against my boyfriend's powerful snoring. I opted for the \"ocean tide\" sound to lull me to sleep. The audio quality is solid, especially knowing these were created by former Bose engineers.</p><p>So: Did these earbuds completely eliminate my partner's snoring? Not entirely—his snores are truly in a league of their own. But the combination of noise blocking and the ocean tide sound <em>significantly </em>reduced my nightly interruptions from constant to few and far between. Most importantly, when I did hear him, it didn't immediately snap me awake. The soundscapes seemed to cushion the noise, making it less startling.</p><p>But the street noise from the bar below? Completely gone. The upstairs neighbors walking around? Barely noticeable. These Sleepbuds excel at blocking consistent ambient noise while taking the edge off sudden, disruptive sounds.</p><div>\n            <p><span>\n                What do you think so far?\n            </span>\n        </p></div>\n<p>Another feature I love is the in-ear personal alarm. Instead of a jarring phone alarm that jolts both you and your partner awake, the Sleepbuds gently vibrate and play a soft tone directly into your ears. My boyfriend has never been woken up by my alarm since I started using them.</p><h2 id=\"tips-and-tricks-for-sleeping-with-earbuds-in\">Tips and tricks for sleeping with earbuds in</h2><p>After a few weeks of use, I've discovered several ways to optimize the Sleepbuds experience:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Find your perfect soundscape</strong>: Don't settle for the first one you try. I cycled through several before discovering that rain sounds work better for me than ocean waves or white noise.</p></li><li><p><strong>Create a charging routine</strong>: Keep the charging case on your nightstand and make putting the buds back a part of your morning routine. </p></li><li><p><strong>Experiment with volume levels</strong>: I really recommend starting lower than you think you need. Your ears adjust to the soundscape within minutes, and too-loud audio can actually be stimulating rather than relaxing.</p></li><li><p><strong>Use the app's sleep timer</strong>: If you don't want soundscapes playing all night, set a timer. You might only need the audio to fall asleep, not maintain it.</p></li><li><p><strong>Try different sleeping positions</strong>: The low profile means you can experiment with side sleeping even if you've never been able to before.</p></li></ul><h2 id=\"the-bottom-line\">The bottom line</h2><p>Are the Ozlo Sleepbuds perfect? No. The app dependency isn't ideal, and they won't completely eliminate every noise (I'm looking at you, Greg's snores). But compared to my previous solutions—uncomfortable headphones, potentially unsafe sleeping positions, or relegating myself to the couch—these Sleepbuds rock.</p><p>If I'm choosing between traditional foam earplugs, regular earbuds, or these specialized sleep buds, I'd pick the Ozlo Sleepbuds every time. My only concern? I'm becoming so dependent that I'll have trouble sleeping without them. But honestly, if that's the price for consistently good sleep in a noisy city apartment with a snoring partner, I'll take it.</p>\n            </article>"
