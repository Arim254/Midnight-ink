Uncomfortable, potentially unsafe, and a surefire way to destroy my expensive electronics.</p><p>That's what led me to the Ozlo Sleepbuds, <a href=\"https://zdcs.link/Qp4Vng?pageview_type=Standard&template=Explainers&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=currently%20available%20for%20%24299&short_url=Qp4Vng&u=https%3A%2F%2Flifehacker.com%2Ftech%2Fozlo-sleepbuds-review&event_label=currently%20available%20for%20%24299\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"open in a new window\">currently available for $299</a>. Unlike my <a href=\"https://zdcs.link/aN8XnV?pageview_type=Standard&template=Explainers&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=AirPod%20Pros&short_url=aN8XnV&u=https%3A%2F%2Flifehacker.com%2Ftech%2Fozlo-sleepbuds-review&event_label=AirPod%20Pros\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"open in a new window\">AirPod Pros</a>, which are great for daily use but pierce my eardrums when I lie on my side, the Ozlo sleepbuds have a remarkably low profile. The pre-installed ear tips fit perfectly, creating a secure seal without the pressure points that make traditional earbuds a nightmare for side sleepers. Despite their <a href=\"https://casabona.org/2025/01/ozlo-sleepbuds-review/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"open in a new window\">mixed</a> online reviews, I've found that these smart earplugs really do help me sleep deeper (and possibly saved my relationship).</p><div>\n        <p><img src=\"https://lifehacker.com/images/short-lifehacker-logo.jpg\" alt=\"Lifehacker Logo\" /></p><div>\n            <p><span>You May Also Like</span></p>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n<h2 id=\"the-app-experience\">The app experience</h2><p>Here's where the Ozlo sleepbuds diverge from typical wireless earbuds, and honestly, it's a double-edged sword. Unlike AirPods that connect automatically via Bluetooth, these require opening the Ozlo app like a control center. You'll need to select your soundscape, adjust volume, and set your alarm through the app interface.</p><div>\n    <p><img src=\"https://lifehacker.com/imagery/articles/01K5S72NBMBKD6972CACS3XRXK/images-1.fill.size_2000x1125.v1758561654.png\" alt=\"Ozlo app screenshots\" srcset=\"https://lifehacker.com/imagery/articles/01K5S72NBMBKD6972CACS3XRXK/images-1.fill.size_800x450.v1758561654.png 800w, https://lifehacker.com/imagery/articles/01K5S72NBMBKD6972CACS3XRXK/images-1.fill.size_1400x788.v1758561654.png 1400w, https://lifehacker.com/imagery/articles/01K5S72NBMBKD6972CACS3XRXK/images-1.fill.size_2000x1125.v1758561654.png 2000w\" />\n            </p>\n            <p><span>Setting up my Ozlo sleepbuds.</span>\n                                        <span>Credit: Meredith Dietz</span>\n                    </p>\n    </div>\n<p>Initially, this felt clunky compared to the seamless connectivity we're all used to. But after a few nights, I found myself positively reframing this friction as more of a \"ritual.\" Opening the app, placing the buds in my ears, and selecting a soundscape became a bedtime ritual that signaled to my brain it was time to wind down. </p><h2 id=\"wearing-my-sleepbuds-through-the-night\">Wearing my sleepbuds through the night</h2><p>The moment of truth came on my first night testing them against my boyfriend's powerful snoring. I opted for the \"ocean tide\" sound to lull me to sleep. The audio quality is solid, especially knowing these were created by former Bose engineers.</p><p>So: Did these earbuds completely eliminate my partner's snoring? Not entirely—his snores are truly in a league of their own. But the combination of noise blocking and the ocean tide sound <em>significantly </em>reduced my nightly interruptions from constant to few and far between. Most importantly, when I did hear him, it didn't immediately snap me awake. The soundscapes seemed to cushion the noise, making it less startling.</p><p>But the street noise from the bar below? Completely gone. The upstairs neighbors walking around? Barely noticeable. These Sleepbuds excel at blocking consistent ambient noise while taking the edge off sudden, disruptive sounds.</p><div>\n            <p><span>\n                What do you think so far?\n            </span>\n        </p></div>\n<p>Another feature I love is the in-ear personal alarm. Instead of a jarring phone alarm that jolts both you and your partner awake, the Sleepbuds gently vibrate and play a soft tone directly into your ears. My boyfriend has never been woken up by my alarm since I started using them.</p><h2 id=\"tips-and-tricks-for-sleeping-with-earbuds-in\">Tips and tricks for sleeping with earbuds in</h2><p>After a few weeks of use, I've discovered several ways to optimize the Sleepbuds experience:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Find your perfect soundscape</strong>: Don't settle for the first one you try. I cycled through several before discovering that rain sounds work better for me than ocean waves or white noise.</p></li><li><p><strong>Create a charging routine</strong>: Keep the charging case on your nightstand and make putting the buds back a part of your morning routine. </p></li><li><p><strong>Experiment with volume levels</strong>: I really recommend starting lower than you think you need. Your ears adjust to the soundscape within minutes, and too-loud audio can actually be stimulating rather than relaxing.</p></li><li><p><strong>Use the app's sleep timer</strong>: If you don't want soundscapes playing all night, set a timer. You might only need the audio to fall asleep, not maintain it.</p></li><li><p><strong>Try different sleeping positions</strong>: The low profile means you can experiment with side sleeping even if you've never been able to before.</p></li></ul><h2 id=\"the-bottom-line\">The bottom line</h2><p>Are the Ozlo Sleepbuds perfect? No. The app dependency isn't ideal, and they won't completely eliminate every noise (I'm looking at you, Greg's snores). But compared to my previous solutions—uncomfortable headphones, potentially unsafe sleeping positions, or relegating myself to the couch—these Sleepbuds rock.</p><p>If I'm choosing between traditional foam earplugs, regular earbuds, or these specialized sleep buds, I'd pick the Ozlo Sleepbuds every time. My only concern? I'm becoming so dependent that I'll have trouble sleeping without them. But honestly, if that's the price for consistently good sleep in a noisy city apartment with a snoring partner, I'll take it.</p>\n            </article>\n    </div>\n<div>\n    <div>\n        <p><span>The Download Newsletter</span>\n            <span>Never miss a tech story</span>\n        </p>\n        <p><img src=\"https://lifehacker.com/images/team/Jake.png\" alt=\"Jake Peterson portrait\" />\n            <span>Jake Peterson\n            </span>\n            <span>Senior tech editor</span>\n        </p>\n        <p><span>Get the latest tech news, <span></span>reviews, <span></span>and advice from Jake and the team.</span>\n    </p></div>\n    <div>\n        <p><span>The Download Newsletter</span>\n            <span><span>Never miss a tech story.</span> Get the latest tech news, <span></span>reviews, <span></span>and advice from Jake and the team.</span>\n        </p>\n    </div>\n</div>\n    </div>\n            <div>\n                <p><span>\n                        Keep Scrolling for Next Article\n                    </span>\n                </p>\n            </div>\n        </div>\n    </div>"

There were some other unsubstantiated claims about vaccines and autism mixed in, so let me break down what’s actually known and understood here. </p><h2 id=\"what-is-acetaminophen\">What is acetaminophen? </h2><p>Acetaminophen is an over-the-counter medication used to relieve pain and fevers. The flagship products of the Tylenol company are acetaminophen pills and syrups, but Tylenol sells other products as well, including medicines with a mixture of active ingredients. (Always check the Drug Facts label when you take medications to know what you’re getting.) I’ll often use the word Tylenol, since it’s more commonly known, but acetaminophen is also available in other products, like Excedrin and NyQuil..</p>\n<p>Outside the U.S., acetaminophen is often known as paracetamol: Same drug, different generic name, though Trump seems to have stuck with the brand name Tylenol during the press conference. The Tylenol company now has a pop-up on its website pointing customers to <a href=\"https://www.tylenol.com/frequently-asked-questions#concerned-about-acetaminophen-and-autism\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"open in a new window\"><u>this response</u></a>, which correctly points out there is no credible link between Tylenol and autism.</p><h2 id=\"what-the-science-actually-says-about-acetaminophen-and-autism\">What the science actually says about acetaminophen and autism </h2><p>The short answer: There is no credible link between autism and the use of acetaminophen in pregnancy. But HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy, Jr. sorta-kinda spoke correctly when, during the press conference, he said there were some studies that “suggest a potential” connection between acetaminophen and autism. For example, a <a href=\"https://ehjournal.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12940-025-01208-0\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"open in a new window\"><u>review published this year</u></a> (not a study itself, but an analysis of prior studies) found that some studies do in fact show a link between acetaminophen use in pregnancy and autism, although the evidence is mixed. </p><p>A press release about the review noted, “While <strong>the study does not show that acetaminophen directly causes neurodevelopmental disorders</strong> [emphasis mine], the research team’s findings strengthen the evidence for a connection and raise concerns about current clinical practices.” That said, it seems most medical experts aren’t convinced that this review, or the studies that claimed to find a link, are strong enough to change clinical practice. (More in the next section on what medical experts are saying about these claims.) </p><p>So why doesn’t this count as strong evidence? An association (two things tend to occur together) is not the same as causality (this thing definitively causes that thing). People who take acetaminophen during pregnancy tend to be different than those who don’t—for example, if somebody takes Tylenol during pregnancy because they are sick, it may be the sickness rather than the Tylenol that is the risk factor. Or the people who take Tylenol may be different from people who don’t in some other way.</p><p>A <a href=\"https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2817406\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"open in a new window\"><u>large study published last year</u></a> took this into account. The researchers looked at 2.5 million children in Sweden, and their initial analysis found an increase in risk of autism in children whose mothers had taken acetaminophen. But then they looked at whether this relationship held up between pairs of siblings, where one was exposed to acetaminophen in utero and the other was not. And the relationship disappeared. </p><p>In other words, if acetaminophen increased autism risk, you’d expect the sibling exposed to the drug in utero to have a higher likelihood of autism than their sibling who wasn’t. But that wasn’t the case. Instead, it seems some <em>families</em> have a higher likelihood than others of having children with autism, and taking acetaminophen doesn’t increase the risk within that family. </p><h2 id=\"what-medical-experts-say-about-acetaminophen-in-pregnancy\">What medical experts say about acetaminophen in pregnancy</h2><p>Acetaminophen (including Tylenol) is generally considered the safest pain reliever for use in pregnancy. Other common alternatives, like ibuprofen, <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK582759/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"open in a new window\"><u>have known risks</u></a> and are not recommended if you are able to take acetaminophen instead. Medical experts also agree that it’s dangerous to leave pain and fever untreated during pregnancy. </p><p>Several medical organizations issued statements in response to the president’s press conference, all of which are worth reading in full, but here are some key quotes from each: </p><p>The <strong>American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists</strong> said in a <a href=\"https://www.acog.org/news/news-releases/2025/09/acog-affirms-safety-benefits-acetaminophen-pregnancy\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"open in a new window\"><u>statement</u></a>: “Suggestions that acetaminophen use in pregnancy causes autism are not only highly concerning to clinicians but also irresponsible when considering the harmful and confusing message they send to pregnant patients, including those who may need to rely on this beneficial medicine during pregnancy.” The statement goes on to discuss the strength of the evidence, saying that “not a single reputable study has successfully concluded that the use of acetaminophen in any trimester of pregnancy causes neurodevelopmental disorders in children.”</p><p>The <strong>Society for Maternal-Fetal Medicine</strong> said in their <a href=\"https://www.smfm.org/news/smfm-response-to-administration-announcement-on-acetaminophen-use-during-pregnancy-and-autism-\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"open in a new window\"><u>statement</u></a>: “In response to today’s White House press conference announcement, the Society for Maternal-Fetal Medicine (SMFM) reiterates its recommendation advising both physicians and patients that acetaminophen is an appropriate medication to treat pain and fever during pregnancy.  Despite assertions to the contrary, a thorough review of existing research suggesting a potential link between acetaminophen use during pregnancy and an increased risk of autism and attention deficit and hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) in children has not established a causal relationship.”</p><div>\n            <p><span>\n                What do you think so far?\n            </span>\n        </p></div>\n<p>The <strong>American Academy of Pediatrics</strong> said in their <a href=\"https://www.aap.org/en/news-room/news-releases/aap/2025/aap-statement-on-white-house-autism-announcement/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"open in a new window\"><u>statement</u></a>: “Today’s White House event on autism was filled with dangerous claims and misleading information that sends a confusing message to parents and expecting parents and does a disservice to autistic individuals. … Families who have questions about their child’s medications, autism care plans or other health care should consult with their pediatrician or health care provider.”</p><p>The <strong>Autism Science Foundation</strong> said in their <a href=\"https://autismsciencefoundation.org/press_releases/asf-statement-wh-briefing/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"open in a new window\"><u>statement</u></a>: “Any association between acetaminophen and autism is based on limited, conflicting, and inconsistent science and is premature… Today’s announcement distracts from the urgent scientific work needed to understand the true causes of autism and to develop better supports and interventions for autistic people and their families.”</p><p>The <strong>European Medicines Agency</strong>, which plays a similar role in Europe as the FDA does in the U.S., issued a <a href=\"https://www.ema.europa.eu/en/news/use-paracetamol-during-pregnancy-unchanged-eu\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"open in a new window\"><u>statement</u></a> that there is no new evidence that would require reevaluating the status or labeling for acetaminophen, which they call paracetamol. “Paracetamol remains an important option to treat pain or fever in pregnant women. Our advice is based on a rigorous assessment of the available scientific data and we have found no evidence that taking paracetamol during pregnancy causes autism in children.”</p><h2 id=\"there-is-no-evidence-that-vaccines-cause-autism-either\">There is no evidence that vaccines cause autism, either </h2><p>The press conference also repeated <a href=\"https://www.chop.edu/vaccine-education-center/vaccine-safety/vaccines-and-other-conditions/autism\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"open in a new window\"><u>long-debunked myths</u></a> about vaccines and autism. There’s no credible link here, either to vaccines in general, to specific vaccine ingredients like mercury, or to combined vaccines like the MMR (measles-mumps-rubella vaccine). </p><p>And I shouldn’t have to tell any parent this, but babies are not in fact “pumped” with a “vat” of “80 different vaccines” at “one visit,” as Trump claimed. Babies see the pediatrician every few months during their first year of life, getting a few shots each time, many of which are combination vaccines (not just the MMR). Many of these vaccines need to be given in multiple doses—it’s not a one-and-done shot for each one. </p><p>So it’s not true that separating the MMR into its components has “no downside.” Splitting the shots means kids are getting <em>more</em> needle sticks and delaying the date at which they’ll get their last dose of each and be fully protected. (The CDC’s vaccine advisory panel, which was gutted of its longtime experts and <a href=\"https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/anti-science/rfk-announces-new-acip-members-including-vaccine-critics\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"open in a new window\"><u>filled with controversial replacements</u></a> handpicked by the HHS secretary, who has long been an anti-vaccine activist himself, has <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2025/09/19/rfk-cdc-vaccine-acip-mmrv-covid-recommendations/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"open in a new window\"><u>already</u></a> voted to remove the combined MMR-chickenpox vaccine as a standard option for young children.) </p><p>Trump also repeated <a href=\"https://med.umich.edu/1libr/IMMS/RecommendHepBUM.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"open in a new window\"><u>the myth that there’s no reason for babies to get hepatitis B shots at birth</u></a>. Hepatitis B can be sexually transmitted, sure, but it’s not <em>only</em> sexually transmitted. Babies can get it at birth from a parent who doesn’t know they have it; they can also get it during childhood from various non-sexual, non-drug exposures. Hepatitis B is a more severe disease the younger you get it, <em>and</em> it’s one of the vaccines babies’ immune systems can process even in those early days (not all vaccines will work that early) so the risk-benefit calculation is an easy one: this vaccine, like others, offers children real protection.</p>\n            </article>"

</p>\n    <h2 id=\"toc\">Table of Contents</h2>\n    <article>\n        <hr />\n        <p>It turns out the “lifestyle logging” feature introduced with <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/health/garmin-new-venu-4-watch\" target=\"_blank\"><u>Garmin’s Venu 4 watch announcement</u></a> isn’t limited to that watch—it  seems to be available to all Garmin users, which means the app has made a huge stride in catching up with competitors like Whoop. </p><h2 id=\"what-is-lifestyle-logging\">What is lifestyle logging? </h2><p>This feature lets you track different habits, behaviors, or factors that might impact your health metrics. For example, you can log when you have caffeine or alcohol at night, and see how this affects your sleep. (Garmin tends to refer to these as “behaviors,” even though some of them are more like environmental factors or states of being—illness, for example—but I'll allow it.) </p><p><a href=\"https://zdcs.link/9l30vP?pageview_type=Standard&template=How-To&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=Whoop&short_url=9l30vP&u=https%3A%2F%2Flifehacker.com%2Fhealth%2Fgarmin-whoop-feature-lifestyle-logging&event_label=Whoop\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"open in a new window\"><u>Whoop</u></a>, the screenless tracker with the expensive (but arguably worth it) subscription, has <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/health/what-its-like-to-track-your-health-with-whoop\" target=\"_blank\"><u>long had this kind of feature</u></a>, and it will give you detailed breakdowns of how your habits have affected your recovery. The <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/health/bevel-apple-watch-app-review\" target=\"_blank\"><u>Apple Watch app Bevel</u></a> provides similar functionality as well, while the <a href=\"https://zdcs.link/QWwelm?pageview_type=Standard&template=How-To&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=Oura%20ring&short_url=QWwelm&u=https%3A%2F%2Flifehacker.com%2Fhealth%2Fgarmin-whoop-feature-lifestyle-logging&event_label=Oura%20ring\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"open in a new window\"><u>Oura ring</u></a> has “tags” in <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/health/what-ive-learned-from-four-years-of-tracking-my-health-with-the-oura-ring\" target=\"_blank\"><u>its app</u></a>, although they are more for labeling than analysis. </p><div>\n        <p><img src=\"https://lifehacker.com/images/short-lifehacker-logo.jpg\" alt=\"Lifehacker Logo\" /></p><div>\n            <p><span>You May Also Like</span></p>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n<p>Garmin’s version uses your logged behaviors to generate reports that show how the factors you logged affect: </p><ul><li><p>Your sleep score</p></li><li><p>Your overnight <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/what-your-heart-rate-variability-says-about-your-health-1847517391\" target=\"_blank\"><u>HRV</u></a></p></li><li><p>Your overnight stress</p></li></ul><p>These seem to be the only outcomes, so you won’t see whether these behaviors affect, say, your running performance. And as with any feature of this type, the app can’t actually tell you if your behaviors are <em>causing</em> the positive or negative results you get. </p><p>For example, Whoop <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/health/what-its-like-to-track-your-health-with-whoop\" target=\"_blank\"><u>told me</u></a> that I sleep worse on nights I take melatonin, but that’s just a correlation: The melatonin probably isn’t making my sleep worse; it’s more likely that the connection is because I take melatonin on nights when I’m already up late or expect to have trouble sleeping. </p><h2 id=\"which-garmin-devices-can-use-lifestyle-logging\">Which Garmin devices can use lifestyle logging? </h2><p>Logging your behaviors doesn’t require any specific device; I was able to activate it on an account that had no wearable devices paired at all. However, Garmin notes that to get meaningful reports, you’ll need a device that is capable of measuring HRV (which also contributes to your sleep score and overnight stress). Most of the popular Garmin wearables have HRV capabilities, including Venu, <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/health/garmins-vivoactive-6-smartwatch-review\" target=\"_blank\"><u>Vivoactive</u></a>, and <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/health/what-its-like-to-race-with-the-garmin-forerunner-165\" target=\"_blank\"><u>Forerunner</u></a> watches, and the new <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/health/garmin-index-sleep-band-review\" target=\"_blank\"><u>Index sleep monitor</u></a>. </p><h2 id=\"how-to-use-garmins-lifestyle-logging\">How to use Garmin’s lifestyle logging</h2><p>The feature is kind of hidden, so I wouldn’t blame you for not knowing that it’s there. Make sure your Garmin Connect app is up to date, and then tap the three-dot menu in the bottom right corner. Go to <strong>training and planning</strong>, then <strong>health stats</strong>, and then <strong>lifestyle logging</strong>. </p><div>\n            <p><span>\n                What do you think so far?\n            </span>\n        </p></div>\n<p>The first time you do this, you’ll get a few information screens explaining the feature and asking you to acknowledge that it’s not medical advice.</p><p>You’ll then select the items you want to log. Garmin recommends choosing “only a few” items to log at a time, so you can learn more about those specific things rather than trying to wade through mountains of data. The app’s info screen wisely points out that if you log many different factors, “you may get conflicting data and have a difficult time determining what’s really impacting your health stats.”</p><h3>A non-exhaustive list of what you can log </h3><ul><li><p>The <strong>lifestyle</strong> category includes alcohol, caffeine (morning or late), exercise (light, moderate, or vigorous), late meals, and intermittent fasting.</p></li><li><p>The <strong>self-care</strong> category includes cold showers, journaling, and sunlight.</p></li><li><p>The treatments category includes acupuncture and massage.</p></li><li><p>The sleep-related category includes CPAP machine use, eye masks, reading in bed, and having a pet in your bedroom.</p></li><li><p>The life status category includes allergy symptoms, caregiving, illness, and vacation.</p></li></ul><p>You can also create custom items to log. You can give them a quantity if you like, or just set them up as a yes/no answer. You can also indicate if the item is daytime or bedtime related. Finally, after choosing the behaviors you’d like to log, the app will ask if you’d like related morning and/or evening reminders. </p><p>To see results from any of your behaviors, you’ll need to accumulate five yeses and five nos for each. (As with Whoop’s version of this feature, it’s not useful to track a behavior that you always do or never do—there’s just not enough data to work from.) </p><p>You can view your results from the Training and Planning menu, as above, and you can also add a card to the “at a glance” section of your Garmin Connect app home screen. The card will show whether you’ve logged your behaviors for the day, and tapping on it will show what you’ve logged today and in the past. The Venu 4 watch also has a widget for lifestyle logging on the watch itself. </p>\n            </article>\n    </div>\n<div>\n    <div>\n        <p><span>The Daily Newsletter</span>\n            <span>Ready to do everything better?</span>\n        </p>\n        <p><img src=\"https://lifehacker.com/images/team/Jordan.png\" alt=\"Jordan Calhoun portrait\" />\n            <span>Jordan Calhoun\n            </span>\n            <span>Editor in chief</span>\n        </p>\n        <p><span><span>Get daily tips, tricks, <span>and tech guides</span></span> <span>from Jordan and the team.</span></span>\n    </p></div>\n    <div>\n        <p><span>The Daily Newsletter</span>\n            <span><span>Ready to do everything better?</span> <span>Get daily tips, tricks, <span>and tech guides</span></span> <span>from Jordan and the team.</span></span>\n        </p>\n    </div>\n</div>\n    </div>\n            <div>\n                <p><span>\n                        Keep Scrolling for Next Article\n                    </span>\n                </p>\n            </div>\n        </div>\n    </div>"

better search results, including <a href=\"https://www.google.com/preferences/source?q=lifehacker.com\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"open in a new window\">adding Lifehacker as a preferred source for tech news</a></em><em>.</em></p><hr /><p>Yesterday, at its 2025 Meta Connect conference, Meta finally unveiled its <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/tech/meta-unveiled-rumored-display-style-smart-glasses?test_uuid=015ZvAUxXams0rnBpajhMg2&test_variant=A\" target=\"_blank\">first Ray-Ban smart glasses that actually have a screen</a> inside them. I have yet to try them for myself, but according to my colleagues over at CNET, <a href=\"https://www.cnet.com/tech/computing/i-wore-metas-new-ray-ban-display-glasses-and-neural-band-i-feel-augmented/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"open in a new window\">seeing is believing</a>. If you want to book a demo to try out the new Meta Ray-Ban Display glasses, you're in luck: They're popping up in select stores across the country, and you can already schedule your visit. In fact, you'll need to if you actually want to take a pair home.</p><h2 id=\"what-are-the-meta-ray-ban-display-smart-glasses\">What are the Meta Ray-Ban Display Smart Glasses?</h2><p>Meta's Ray-Ban Display smart glasses are similar to the smart glasses the two companies have already been releasing since 2021, but if the name didn't give it away already, now they have a screen inside them. This isn't AR, so you don't get head tracking or a large virtual display situated in your environment, but you do get a little heads-up 600x600 screen over your right eye that you can use to, say, check on texts or watch an Instagram Reel. It's also private, according to my colleagues over at CNET, with some clever manufacturing keeping people from seeing what's on your display through the transparent lens.</p><div>\n        <p><img src=\"https://lifehacker.com/images/short-lifehacker-logo.jpg\" alt=\"Lifehacker Logo\" /></p><div>\n            <p><span>You May Also Like</span></p>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n<p>And it comes with a special \"neural wristband\" for actually navigating content, which can pick up thumb movements, pinches, and the like and translate them into swipes and taps.</p><p>It all sounds fancy— dare I say \"innovative\"?—even if it comes with a $799 price tag (the last generation of Meta Ray-Ban smart glasses was $379). But if you're going to be dropping that much on such an unproven product, I don't blame you for wanting to go hands-on with it before buying. And it seems, neither does Meta.</p><h2 id=\"how-to-try-out-the-meta-ray-ban-display-smart-glasses\">How to try out the Meta Ray-Ban Display Smart Glasses</h2><p>Even though Meta's Ray-Ban Display Smart Glasses technically start shipping on Sept. 30, you can't buy them online. Instead, you'll have to do an in-store demo before you can actually get a pair. These demos are available at Ray-Ban stores, but also partners including LensCrafters, Sunglass Hut, and Best Buy. You can book demos straight through a specific store's site if you have a favorite, as seen on this <a href=\"https://zdcs.link/QLMOwo?pageview_type=Standard&template=News&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=Best%20Buy%20link&short_url=QLMOwo&u=https%3A%2F%2Flifehacker.com%2Ftech%2Fhow-to-demo-meta-ray-ban-display-smart-glasses&event_label=Best%20Buy%20link\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"open in a new window\">Best Buy link</a>, but the best way to see all the demos available near you is through Meta's own site.</p><p>Just navigate to this <a href=\"https://zdcs.link/zn5P33?pageview_type=Standard&template=News&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=scheduler%20page%20on%20the%20Meta%20site&short_url=zn5P33&u=https%3A%2F%2Flifehacker.com%2Ftech%2Fhow-to-demo-meta-ray-ban-display-smart-glasses&event_label=scheduler%20page%20on%20the%20Meta%20site\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"open in a new window\">scheduler page on the Meta site</a> and enter your address to see participating stores near you and the dates when they have demos available. Then hit \"Schedule a Demo\" on a store of your choosing to be taken to that store's site to finish booking.</p><div>\n            <p><span>\n                What do you think so far?\n            </span>\n        </p></div>\n<p>While Meta's site showed me appointments starting today, none of the stores I clicked through to had availability until October, so don't be surprised if the scheduler's data is a little behind.</p><h2 id=\"what-do-you-need-for-your-ray-ban-display-demo\">What do you need for your Ray-Ban Display Demo?</h2><p>Generally, you can just head to your Ray-Ban Display Demo and be golden. But if you wear prescription lenses, you'll either need to wear contacts or know your lens details. Meta's demo kits can accommodate a range of -4.00 to +4.00 prescriptions, so plan accordingly.</p><p>Then, it's just a matter of trying the glasses on. When you're done, you can either buy your pair, or hold off. If you wait, you'll be sent an email with details from your appointment.</p><p>Meta says it's limiting purchases to people who have tried a demo right now to ensure fit and satisfaction, but that more buying options will come \"over time.\" That's great news for folks who live outside of the U.S., as demos are currently limited to Meta's home country. However, the company says demos will expand to Canada, France, Italy, and the U.K. in early 2026.</p>\n            </article>\n    </div>\n<div>\n    <div>\n        <p><span>The Download Newsletter</span>\n            <span>Never miss a tech story</span>\n        </p>\n        <p><img src=\"https://lifehacker.com/images/team/Jake.png\" alt=\"Jake Peterson portrait\" />\n            <span>Jake Peterson\n            </span>\n            <span>Senior tech editor</span>\n        </p>\n        <p><span>Get the latest tech news, <span></span>reviews, <span></span>and advice from Jake and the team.</span>\n    </p></div>\n    <div>\n        <p><span>The Download Newsletter</span>\n            <span><span>Never miss a tech story.</span> Get the latest tech news, <span></span>reviews, <span></span>and advice from Jake and the team.</span>\n        </p>\n    </div>\n</div>\n    </div>\n            <div>\n                <p><span>\n                        Keep Scrolling for Next Article\n                    </span>\n                </p>\n            </div>\n        </div>\n    </div>"

Announced at Google’s <a href=\"https://blog.youtube/news-and-events/live-updates/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"open in a new window\"><u>Made on YouTube</u></a> event today, the site will soon let streamers go live with simultaneous horizontal and vertical streams, plus use AI to automatically “clip that.” Oh, and there’s some new corporate cross-promotion, too.</p><h2 id=\"stream-horizontally-and-vertically-at-the-same-time\">Stream horizontally and vertically at the same time</h2><p>Currently in testing and set to get a wider release “in the coming months,” YouTube’s combined support for horizontal and vertical streaming is probably the most exciting news to me here. I tend to put streams on in the background, and I much prefer doing that on a second monitor rather than on my phone. But with sites like TikTok getting more popular these days, plenty of streamers are eschewing more traditional platforms for them, meaning I’m likely to miss out on content unless I go looking for vertically oriented streams on my mobile device.</p><div>\n        <p><img src=\"https://lifehacker.com/images/short-lifehacker-logo.jpg\" alt=\"Lifehacker Logo\" /></p><div>\n            <p><span>You May Also Like</span></p>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n<p>Now, though, YouTube will let creators put out both horizontal versions of their streams, meant for larger screens, and vertical ones meant for smaller screens, at the same time. That means there’ll be less incentive to stick with a mobile-only platform to try to hop on the new trend, and users across all devices will be able to watch streams however they wish. Whether you’re watching the horizontal stream or the vertical one, you’ll be thrown into a chat room with everyone, and the streamer won’t have split view counts across different uploads. The vertical stream will just have a cropped or letterboxed view, as usual, depending on the content. It seems like a perfect solution, and I’m excited to see more creators trying it out once it’s available to them—finally, at least on YouTube, I won’t have to worry that I’m missing a stream from a favorite creator by not watching on my phone.</p><h2 id=\"ai-generated-livestream-highlights\">AI-generated livestream highlights</h2><p>Meanwhile, as for actually watching streams themselves, YouTube’s making it a bit easier for creators to create highlights from their streams. Personally, while I do have favorite creators, I’ll admit I don’t have the time to watch all of their content, and will often just sort through clips in my free time instead. Unfortunately, not everything gets clipped, because it takes manual effort to do that—that’s why you’ll sometimes see creators tell their fans to “clip that” after a memorable moment. Now, though, YouTube’s throwing some automation into the mix. Starting “in the next few weeks,” you’ll be able to task AI with sorting through your livestreams to automatically find highlights and turn them into YouTube shorts, which you’ll be able to check before uploading. It’s kind of become expected in some corners of the internet for stream clips to be uploaded via unofficial channels, since they currently need a bit of manual work. While I’ve seen streamers express appreciation to their fans for doing this, I also do worry that I’m not supporting the actual content creators enough by watching through these sources. Hopefully, the new tool will make it easier to see clips straight from creators themselves.</p><h2 id=\"live-reaction-and-streaming-playables\">Live reaction and streaming 'Playables'</h2><div>\n    <p><img src=\"https://lifehacker.com/imagery/articles/01K5A0JSCPTB9J92X3337M7BK6/images-1.fill.size_2000x2000.v1758052264.webp\" alt=\"Live reaction on YouTube\" srcset=\"https://lifehacker.com/imagery/articles/01K5A0JSCPTB9J92X3337M7BK6/images-1.fill.size_800x800.v1758052264.webp 800w, https://lifehacker.com/imagery/articles/01K5A0JSCPTB9J92X3337M7BK6/images-1.fill.size_1400x1400.v1758052264.webp 1400w, https://lifehacker.com/imagery/articles/01K5A0JSCPTB9J92X3337M7BK6/images-1.fill.size_2000x2000.v1758052264.webp 2000w\" />\n            </p>\n            <p><span></span>\n                                        <span>Credit: Google</span>\n                    </p>\n    </div>\n<p>Finally, there are two additional features that are set to make it a lot easier to promote content via YouTube. The first is “React Live,” which will allow you to start a vertical livestream with content you’re watching in the upper half and your own feed in the bottom half. This will make it easier for creators to create reaction streams, without forcing them to capture video on their own, but it’ll only work with events and creators that allows their content to be reacted to. Still, if you like to watch tech keynotes alongside your favorite commentators, this should allow creators to start them up without bothering to independently license a stream first, assuming the company behind the keynote allows reaction streams. YouTube expects this to enter testing “early next year.”</p><div>\n            <p><span>\n                What do you think so far?\n            </span>\n        </p></div>\n<p>The second is the ability to stream YouTube’s “<a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/tech/you-can-now-play-these-multiplayer-games-on-youtube\" target=\"_blank\"><u>Playables</u></a>” browser games with the touch of a button, again without needing to capture the gameplay yourself. Having played a bunch of these, I personally think the quality is all over the place, but it should be a good way to get started with streaming without worrying about tech or capture software. And there are a few noteworthy games in there, including <em>Angry Birds Showdown</em> and <em>Cut the Rope</em>. YouTube says this should come to some creators next month, ahead of a larger rollout later this year.</p><h2 id=\"why-does-this-matter\">Why does this matter?</h2><p>I’m personally thrilled to see YouTube drop a few barriers to streaming, both by making it easier to find content to react to, as well as to reach multiple types of viewers at once. In particular, the new updates seem designed to help the site cross the threshold between desktop and mobile without losing its existing audience, which is funny, given that one of YouTube’s top competitors just made it harder to stream on mobile.</p><p>In order to <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/tech/why-you-cant-go-live-on-instagram-anymore\" target=\"_blank\"><u>go live on Instagram</u></a>, as of one month ago, you now need to have a public account and at least 1,000 followers. That probably saves Instagram some server load, but also kills new talent right out of the door. With YouTube quickly catching up, it’s possible it could soon be eating Meta’s lunch. Will other streaming sites be next?</p>\n            </article>\n    </div>\n<div>\n    <div>\n        <p><span>The Download Newsletter</span>\n            <span>Never miss a tech story</span>\n        </p>\n        <p><img src=\"https://lifehacker.com/images/team/Jake.png\" alt=\"Jake Peterson portrait\" />\n            <span>Jake Peterson\n            </span>\n            <span>Senior tech editor</span>\n        </p>\n        <p><span>Get the latest tech news, <span></span>reviews, <span></span>and advice from Jake and the team.</span>\n    </p></div>\n    <div>\n        <p><span>The Download Newsletter</span>\n            <span><span>Never miss a tech story.</span> Get the latest tech news, <span></span>reviews, <span></span>and advice from Jake and the team.</span>\n        </p>\n    </div>\n</div>\n    </div>\n            <div>\n                <p><span>\n                        Keep Scrolling for Next Article\n                    </span>\n                </p>\n            </div>\n        </div>"

    </p>\n    <h2 id=\"toc\">Table of Contents</h2>\n    <article>\n        <hr />\n        <p>I love finding <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/tech/the-best-apps-for-getting-free-stuff\" target=\"_blank\">new ways to use apps to make my life easier</a>, but sometimes, I find that I'm using so much tech in my real life that I get a little bogged down. That's been true with <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/health/fitness-apps-i-use-every-day\" target=\"_blank\">my workouts and health for a while</a>: I weigh myself in the morning <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/health/the-best-bathroom-scales\" target=\"_blank\">on a smart scale</a>, which distributes the data to <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/tech/lifesum-health-app-review\" target=\"_blank\">a nutrition app</a>, Apple Health, and <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/health/peloton-app-review\" target=\"_blank\">Peloton</a>. I go to the gym and use my Apple Watch's Workouts feature to track my cardio, then open up <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/tech/strong-weight-lifting-app-review\" target=\"_blank\">Strong</a> to track my lifting. At home, I use Peloton to track my <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/health/how-to-take-the-peloton-ftp-test\" target=\"_blank\">cycling</a> workouts, <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/health/peloton-stretching-classes-are-helping-me-do-the-splits\" target=\"_blank\">stretching</a>, <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/health/pelotons-yoga-offerings-are-surprisingly-robust\" target=\"_blank\">yoga</a>, and much more. It all gets to be a little much!</p><p>That's why I was pumped when I found an overlooked feature on my Peloton app recently: I can track my non-Peloton workouts with it, meaning I don't have to fiddle as much with some of my <em>other</em> apps. I can keep more of what I'm doing in one place, easy to reference, and streamlined. </p><h2 id=\"how-to-track-independent-workouts-with-peloton\">How to track independent workouts with Peloton</h2><p>When you open your Peloton app, you'll see a bottom menu with five options: <strong>Home</strong>, <strong>Classes</strong>, <strong>Track</strong>, <strong>Community</strong>, and <strong>You</strong>. Most of these are pretty obvious and I'm guessing that the majority of the time, you're hitting <strong>Classes</strong> to follow along with one of the thousands of guided workouts the app offers for up to $44 per month. But a few weeks ago, I decided to hit <strong>Track</strong> just to see what it was all about. </p><div>\n        <p><img src=\"https://lifehacker.com/images/short-lifehacker-logo.jpg\" alt=\"Lifehacker Logo\" /></p><div>\n            <p><span>You May Also Like</span></p>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n<div>\n    <p><img src=\"https://lifehacker.com/imagery/articles/01K57E6J4S14PPZ7RP98R2XF0A/images-1.fill.size_2000x1133.v1757965404.png\" alt=\"Tracking Peloton workouts in iOS\" srcset=\"https://lifehacker.com/imagery/articles/01K57E6J4S14PPZ7RP98R2XF0A/images-1.fill.size_800x453.v1757965404.png 800w, https://lifehacker.com/imagery/articles/01K57E6J4S14PPZ7RP98R2XF0A/images-1.fill.size_1400x793.v1757965404.png 1400w, https://lifehacker.com/imagery/articles/01K57E6J4S14PPZ7RP98R2XF0A/images-1.fill.size_2000x1133.v1757965404.png 2000w\" />\n            </p>\n            <p><span></span>\n                                        <span>Credit: Lindsey Ellefson/Peloton</span>\n                    </p>\n    </div>\n<p>Tapping <strong>Track</strong> brings up a screen that says <strong>Track an activity</strong>. You have options and those will depend on what types of classes or workouts you use the app for most often. For me at this very moment, the app suggests <strong>Outdoor Walking</strong>, <strong>Cycling</strong>, and <strong>Strength</strong>, but you can hit <strong>More options</strong> to see a whole slate of choices that include running, yoga, cardio, meditation, and more. When you select one of these, they'll be filed as \"Just\" classes in your Peloton history, like Just Ride or Just Walk. </p><p>If that reminds you of the Apple Watch's built-in Workouts app, that's because it's basically the same thing. If you select one of those choices on Peloton, a screen pops up with a timer, start and pause buttons, a prompt to share your location \"for accurate metrics,\" a calorie counter, and a heart rate tracker. Basically, the same stuff the Workouts app monitors, too. </p><p>This is most useful if you've paired a heart rate tracker or wearable to your Peloton app, which is <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/health/connect-apple-watch-to-peloton-bike\" target=\"_blank\">something I think everyone should do</a>, since that will help the app better estimate your calorie burn and heart rate. </p><div>\n            <p><span>\n                What do you think so far?\n            </span>\n        </p></div>\n<h2 id=\"why-i-love-this\">Why I love this</h2><p>First and foremost, I like to keep data in one place. I ride my Peloton bike frequently, for instance, but I also <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/health/group-fitness-etiquette-i-wish-everyone-knew\" target=\"_blank\">teach in-person spin classes</a>, and I want to know how those two instances of cycling match up in terms of output, not only for my fitness goals, but for my continued success and employment as a teacher. Tracking my in-person classes with the Peloton app makes these two categories of cardio much easier to compare. </p><p>Plus, I get <em>better</em> data this way. I tracked a lift the other day using the Peloton app, trusting it to monitor my heart rate and effort. I got a detailed graphic showing my heart rate over the two-hour span of my workout, a \"strive score\" (a Peloton-specific metric that measures your output), and a breakdown of how long I spent in each heart rate zone. You get different kinds of data depending on what you do, too. If you do a Just Walk, for instance, you get a little map of your route and can even see what your pace and elevation were at every point along it. Moreover, the strength workout was automatically added to my Workouts and Apple Health data, helping me satisfy the (admittedly arbitrary) goals I set within those apps for daily active minutes and daily burned calories. </p><div>\n    <p><img src=\"https://lifehacker.com/imagery/articles/01K57E6J4S14PPZ7RP98R2XF0A/images-2.fill.size_2000x1126.v1757965404.png\" alt=\"Peloton workout data in iOS\" srcset=\"https://lifehacker.com/imagery/articles/01K57E6J4S14PPZ7RP98R2XF0A/images-2.fill.size_800x451.v1757965404.png 800w, https://lifehacker.com/imagery/articles/01K57E6J4S14PPZ7RP98R2XF0A/images-2.fill.size_1400x788.v1757965404.png 1400w, https://lifehacker.com/imagery/articles/01K57E6J4S14PPZ7RP98R2XF0A/images-2.fill.size_2000x1126.v1757965404.png 2000w\" />\n            </p>\n            <p><span></span>\n                                        <span>Credit: Lindsey Ellefson/Peloton</span>\n                    </p>\n    </div>\n<p>That leads to another reason I like this setup: I use apps not just because it's important to track what I'm doing and monitor my progress, but because they force me into some accountability. As I mentioned, I try to meet my pre-set Apple Health goals every day by \"closing my rings,\" but I also am dedicated to continuing my Peloton \"streak\" of active days. Do these things really matter? No, but doing them motivates me—and the threat of failing to do them on a given day forces me to action when I might otherwise choose to remain sedentary. </p>\n            </article>\n    </div>\n<div>\n    <div>\n        <p><span>The Download Newsletter</span>\n            <span>Never miss a tech story</span>\n        </p>\n        <p><img src=\"https://lifehacker.com/images/team/Jake.png\" alt=\"Jake Peterson portrait\" />\n            <span>Jake Peterson\n            </span>\n            <span>Senior tech editor</span>\n        </p>\n        <p><span>Get the latest tech news, <span></span>reviews, <span></span>and advice from Jake and the team.</span>\n    </p></div>\n    <div>\n        <p><span>The Download Newsletter</span>\n            <span><span>Never miss a tech story.</span> Get the latest tech news, <span></span>reviews, <span></span>and advice from Jake and the team.</span>\n        </p>\n    </div>\n</div>\n    </div>\n            <div>\n                <p><span>\n                        Keep Scrolling for Next Article\n                    </span>\n                </p>\n            </div>\n        </div>\n    </div>"

/><p>Apple’s iOS 26 comes out today, and with it, a new design language called Liquid Glass. While the iPhone home screen has looked more or less the same ever since Apple ditched skeuomorphism in 2013, when you open up your phone today, after <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/tech/when-ios-26-will-release\" target=\"_blank\"><u>downloading the company’s latest update</u></a>, you might be in for a surprise. Apple’s new look for the iPhone prioritizes transparency, and <a href=\"https://x.com/merterdir/status/1932322070634893761\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"open in a new window\"><u>not everyone’s a fan</u></a>.</p><p>Luckily, if you don’t like Liquid Glass, there’s something you can do about it. You can’t get rid of it entirely, but here’s how to make your iPhone look as close as possible to how it used to look before, across both the homescreen and apps like Safari.</p><div>\n        <p><img src=\"https://lifehacker.com/images/short-lifehacker-logo.jpg\" alt=\"Lifehacker Logo\" /></p><div>\n            <p><span>You May Also Like</span></p>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n<h2 id=\"what-is-liquid-glass\">What is Liquid Glass?</h2><p>First, know thine enemy. If you ever used Windows Vista back in the day, you have an idea of what you’re facing here. That operating system was famous for adding transparency effects to Windows that drastically affected performance, and while the iPhone seems to have saved itself from any performance issues with its own update, the goal seems to be the same: let you see what’s below your buttons and overlays by blurring and obscuring your background before letting it bleed through.</p><p>In theory, this adds a bit of depth to your display, and might make it easier to understand how your various screen elements exist in relation to each other. But in practice, <a href=\"https://x.com/stufflistings/status/1932289073319739471\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"open in a new window\"><u>some have complained about it being distracting</u></a>, flooding your screen with irrelevant information you can’t do anything with.</p><p>Apple’s actually <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/tech/the-biggest-features-and-changes-in-ios-26-beta-3\" target=\"_blank\"><u>addressed these complaints</u></a> a bit throughout the iOS 26 beta, specifically <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/tech/ios-26s-second-beta-tones-down-the-liquid-glass-effect\" target=\"_blank\"><u>making the Control Center look less busy</u></a>. But it’s still moving forward with the design changes overall.</p><h2 id=\"how-to-fix-liquid-glass\">How to \"fix\" Liquid Glass</h2><div>\n    <p><img src=\"https://lifehacker.com/imagery/articles/01K571KZKKATN4J35QB6FEN9PV/images-2.fill.size_2000x1125.v1757952485.png\" alt=\"Reduce Transparency Control\" srcset=\"https://lifehacker.com/imagery/articles/01K571KZKKATN4J35QB6FEN9PV/images-2.fill.size_800x450.v1757952485.png 800w, https://lifehacker.com/imagery/articles/01K571KZKKATN4J35QB6FEN9PV/images-2.fill.size_1400x788.v1757952485.png 1400w, https://lifehacker.com/imagery/articles/01K571KZKKATN4J35QB6FEN9PV/images-2.fill.size_2000x1125.v1757952485.png 2000w\" />\n            </p>\n            <p><span></span>\n                                        <span>Credit: Michelle Ehrhardt</span>\n                    </p>\n    </div>\n<p>If you’d rather Apple leave your iPhone’s design alone, though, you have options. During the beta, users discovered a pre-existing accessibility control within iOS that also, seemingly, neuters most of Liquid Glass’ changes. It won’t get rid of all of the updates—the new, wider toggle button is unaffected, for instance—but it goes a long way towards restoring your phone to how it looked before. </p><p>Called <strong>Reduce Transparency</strong>, this control <a href=\"https://support.apple.com/guide/iphone/change-display-colors-iph3e2e1fb0/ios\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"open in a new window\"><u>has been around for years</u></a>, and was originally intended as a way to add a solid background to any pre-Liquid Glass elements that already had transparent or blurred backgrounds, like the Passcode entry screen. Now, though, it turns out it also affects Liquid Glass as a whole.</p><p>You can <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/media?url=https%3A%2F%2Fi.redd.it%2Fmfmsvzuoqz5f1.jpeg\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"open in a new window\"><u>see the changes here</u></a>. Notice how the play button on Apple Music no longer lets blurred album artwork bleed into it, allowing you to more clearly read the artist’s name?</p><div>\n            <p><span>\n                What do you think so far?\n            </span>\n        </p></div>\n<div><p>While I haven’t gotten my hands on Liquid Glass yet, I think I’ll be turning this on right away. I like big, chunky buttons, and <strong>Reduce Transparency</strong> seems like the way to get just that, even as Apple insists transparency is the future. If that sounds like you, here’s where you can turn it on:</p><p><strong>Settings > Accessibility > Display & Text Size</strong>.</p></div><p>And while it doesn’t necessarily have anything to do with Liquid Glass, while you’re in your accessibility controls, you might also want to turn on the <strong>Increase Contrast </strong>option, which will make your apps’ foreground elements pop from the background a bit more. After turning this on, you’ll see it right away on the Settings page’s toggles, which will take on a darker shade of gray when disabled. This is optional, but helps add to the chunky buttons look, and brings back a little bit of the depth Liquid Glass is going for, without making your screen busier.</p><h2 id=\"bring-back-the-old-safari-url-bar\">Bring back the old Safari URL bar</h2><div>\n    <p><img src=\"https://lifehacker.com/imagery/articles/01K571KZKKATN4J35QB6FEN9PV/images-1.fill.size_2000x1124.v1757952485.png\" alt=\"Safari layout options\" srcset=\"https://lifehacker.com/imagery/articles/01K571KZKKATN4J35QB6FEN9PV/images-1.fill.size_800x450.v1757952485.png 800w, https://lifehacker.com/imagery/articles/01K571KZKKATN4J35QB6FEN9PV/images-1.fill.size_1400x787.v1757952485.png 1400w, https://lifehacker.com/imagery/articles/01K571KZKKATN4J35QB6FEN9PV/images-1.fill.size_2000x1124.v1757952485.png 2000w\" />\n            </p>\n            <p><span></span>\n                                        <span>Credit: Pranay Parab</span>\n                    </p>\n    </div>\n<p>For the most part, once you’ve enabled “Reduce Transparency,” you’ve gotten rid of Liquid Glass’ most extreme design decisions. Technically, the update does also allow you to make your icons clear or adjust your lock screen widgets, but those changes <a href=\"https://www.cnet.com/tech/services-and-software/how-to-get-clear-icons-and-other-home-screen-changes-in-the-ios-26-beta/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"open in a new window\"><u>have to be opted into</u></a>. However, one important app will look pretty drastically different by default: <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/tech/how-to-make-the-most-of-safari-ios-26-redesign\" target=\"_blank\"><u>Safari</u></a>.</p><p>When you open Safari after installing iOS 26, you’ll notice that the URL bar is now just a small pill at the bottom of the screen, next to a tiny back button and an even smaller refresh button. All your other old navigation features are instead hidden away in either the three-dots menu, or behind various swipes and long presses.</p><p>Personally, some of us at Lifehacker think the smaller address bar is worth it, but if you want to go back to the old URL bar, you can do that. Simply navigate to <strong>Settings > Apps > Safari</strong>. Under the <strong>Tabs </strong>section, you’ll see three layout options. <strong>Compact</strong> is the new default, but <strong>Bottom</strong> will bring back the old look, with full controls for back, forward, sharing, bookmarks, and tabs all laid out below the address. There’s also a new <strong>Top</strong> option, if you’d like, that moves the website address to the top of the screen but leaves navigation at the bottom.</p>\n            </article>\n    </div>\n<div>\n    <div>\n        <p><span>The Download Newsletter</span>\n            <span>Never miss a tech story</span>\n        </p>\n        <p><img src=\"https://lifehacker.com/images/team/Jake.png\" alt=\"Jake Peterson portrait\" />\n            <span>Jake Peterson\n            </span>\n            <span>Senior tech editor</span>\n        </p>\n        <p><span>Get the latest tech news, <span></span>reviews, <span></span>and advice from Jake and the team.</span>\n    </p></div>\n    <div>\n        <p><span>The Download Newsletter</span>\n            <span><span>Never miss a tech story.</span> Get the latest tech news, <span></span>reviews, <span></span>and advice from Jake and the team.</span>\n        </p>\n    </div>\n</div>\n    </div>\n            <div>\n                <p><span>\n                        Keep Scrolling for Next Article\n                    </span>\n                </p>\n            </div>\n        </div>\n    </div>"

To paraphrase Hume: Just because two things happen at the same time doesn’t mean one is causing the other. Every smart person already already knows this, and it's repeated constantly, but we all still get it wrong. </p><div>\n        <p><img src=\"https://lifehacker.com/images/short-lifehacker-logo.jpg\" alt=\"Lifehacker Logo\" /></p><div>\n            <p><span>You May Also Like</span></p>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n<p>Here are some examples:</p><ul><li><p>The last <a href=\"https://www.nutraingredients.com/Article/2025/07/31/correlation-dressed-up-as-causation-the-reality-of-microbiome-science/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"open in a new window\">20 years of research on \"gut biomes\"</a> could be wrong, partly as a result of both scientists and the media mistaking correlation and causation. (I've always had a gut feeling—get it?—this research was suspect.)</p></li><li><p>For years people believed that drinking alcohol in moderation is good for your health. But it isn't. It's <em>correlated</em> with <a href=\"https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9653126/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"open in a new window\">better health in some populations</a>, but it doesn't <em>cause</em> better health. </p></li></ul><p>Defenders of mistaken beliefs derived from the correlation/causation fallacy will often compile volumes of data that shows a nearly exact correlations between, say, higher rates of autism and higher rates of vaccination, which makes it totally understandable to believe one causes the other. But there's <a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24814559/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"open in a new window\">no evidence that vaccines cause autism</a>, and the correlation is probably because children received vaccines around the age autism is generally diagnosed, and we've gotten better at both vaccinating children and diagnosing autism. But \"probably\" is doing some lifting in that sentence. While no causal link between vaccines and autism has ever been demonstrated, there could be any number of reasons the rates line up. </p><p>Classic debunking examples of correlation and causation, like the link between <a href=\"https://geneticliteracyproject.org/2025/06/17/glp-spaces-on-x-ice-cream-sales-increase-drowning-confusing-correlation-and-causation-yields-strange-and-often-harmful-results\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"open in a new window\">ice cream sales and shark attacks</a>, tend to offer a pat explanation for the causal link—it only seems like ice cream causes shark attacks because both ice cream sales and swimming in the ocean rise when the weather is warmer—but even that is potentially mistaking correlation for causation. It makes sense, but we don’t actually <em>know</em> why those two numbers line up. And sometimes there just isn't any reason for connection between two pieces of disparate information. </p><p>Check out the chart below.

That's why we can never really stop being wrong in this specific way. Our brains <em>want</em> to believe. A neatly phrased explanation, a tidy chart, a plausible-sounding theory—it's so <em>satisfying</em>.  A simple \"we don't know\" can't hold a candle to that certainty. </p><p>Mistaking correlation for causation makes us go on fad diets and believe we're being healthy by drinking wine at dinner. It shapes health advice, public policy, and personal decisions in ways that can actually hurt people. The best we can do is try to be aware of it—when we read a headline that says \"X causes Y,\" to assume this is a \"cat scratches cause fruit consumption\" situation until there's evidence that it isn't. </p>\n            </article>\n    </div>\n<div>\n    <div>\n        <p><span>The Daily Newsletter</span>\n            <span>Ready to do everything better?</span>\n        </p>\n        <p><img src=\"https://lifehacker.com/images/team/Jordan.png\" alt=\"Jordan Calhoun portrait\" />\n            <span>Jordan Calhoun\n            </span>\n            <span>Editor in chief</span>\n        </p>\n        <p><span><span>Get daily tips, tricks, <span>and tech guides</span></span> <span>from Jordan and the team.</span></span>\n    </p></div>\n    <div>\n        <p><span>The Daily Newsletter</span>\n            <span><span>Ready to do everything better?</span> <span>Get daily tips, tricks, <span>and tech guides</span></span> <span>from Jordan and the team.</span></span>\n        </p>\n    </div>\n</div>\n    </div>\n            <div>\n                <p><span>\n                        Keep Scrolling for Next Article\n                    </span>\n                </p>\n            </div>\n        </div>\n    </div>"

Previously, setting your phone down gave your bean time to knit socks, and you could trade those socks for decorations for the bean’s room. Now, there’s a whole new room to unlock. </p><p>Focus Friend is a <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/tech/best-focus-timer-apps\" target=\"_blank\">focus timer app</a> in the same tradition as Forest and Flora. When you start a timer in Focus Friend, the little bean guy begins knitting, and the idea is that you put your phone down and don't use any other apps until he's done. When time is up, he'll happily show you that he knitted some socks! The socks let you buy decorations for his room, so the more you use the app, the cozier you can make his little home.</p><div>\n        <p><img src=\"https://lifehacker.com/images/short-lifehacker-logo.jpg\" alt=\"Lifehacker Logo\" /></p><div>\n            <p><span>You May Also Like</span></p>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n<p>The timing of the new room is perfect. Like many regular users of the app, I’ve maxed out the little room my bean was initially given. My little guy (his name is Beanie) has a desk and chair, a window, a potted plant, even a garland on the wall. But now, with this update, he can walk (or…teleport via beanstalk, apparently?) into a living room!</p><div>\n    <p><img src=\"https://lifehacker.com/imagery/articles/01K4ZM33J6FK4E5M7Y3W541VVD/images-1.fill.size_2000x1125.v1757702884.jpg\" alt=\"Bean screens\" srcset=\"https://lifehacker.com/imagery/articles/01K4ZM33J6FK4E5M7Y3W541VVD/images-1.fill.size_800x450.v1757702884.jpg 800w, https://lifehacker.com/imagery/articles/01K4ZM33J6FK4E5M7Y3W541VVD/images-1.fill.size_1400x788.v1757702884.jpg 1400w, https://lifehacker.com/imagery/articles/01K4ZM33J6FK4E5M7Y3W541VVD/images-1.fill.size_2000x1125.v1757702884.jpg 2000w\" />\n            </p>\n            <p><span></span>\n                                        <span>Credit: Beth Skwarecki/Focus Friend</span>\n                    </p>\n    </div>\n<h2 id=\"how-to-unlock-the-living-room-in-focus-friend\">How to unlock the living room in Focus Friend</h2><p>You won’t see the new room right away, but here’s how you can access it: </p><div>\n            <p><span>\n                What do you think so far?\n            </span>\n        </p></div>\n<ol><li><p>Update the Focus Friend app in the <a href=\"https://zdcs.link/911Lvk?pageview_type=Standard&template=News&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=App%20Store&short_url=911Lvk&u=https%3A%2F%2Flifehacker.com%2Ftech%2Ffocus-friend-bean-now-has-a-living-room&event_label=App%20Store\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"open in a new window\">App Store</a> or <a href=\"https://zdcs.link/aXVYDY?pageview_type=Standard&template=News&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=Google%20Play&short_url=aXVYDY&u=https%3A%2F%2Flifehacker.com%2Ftech%2Ffocus-friend-bean-now-has-a-living-room&event_label=Google%20Play\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"open in a new window\">Google Play</a> store.</p></li><li><p>In Focus Friend, tap the paintbrush icon. </p></li><li><p>See it?

Socks are the in-game currency that your bean earns when you leave them alone. (The bean knits socks for free users. Premium subscribers get more socks, plus the bean also knits scarves, which you can exchange for premium versions of the decorations.) </p><p>Once you’ve unlocked it, you can then start decorating the addition the same way you decorated the initial room. The new items are more expensive than what was available in the first room, some of which only cost 50 socks. The new items include: </p><ul><li><p>A window with curtains, starting at 500 socks</p></li><li><p>Three places to hang pictures on the walls, starting at 150-200 socks each</p></li><li><p>A TV (I almost thought it was a big painting) on the right wall, starting at 300 socks</p></li><li><p>A lamp in the corner between the two walls, starting at 600 socks</p></li><li><p>A couch on the left wall, starting at 600 socks</p></li><li><p>A TV side table on the right wall below the big painting, starting at 300 socks</p></li><li><p>A “figure box” shelf on the right wall, starting at 200 socks</p></li><li><p>A set of little bookshelves on the right wall, starting at 500 socks</p></li><li><p>A coffee table in the middle of the room, starting at 300 socks</p></li><li><p>A little “entry rug,” starting at 300 socks</p></li><li><p>An armchair, starting at 500 socks</p></li><li><p>An end table, starting at 300 socks</p></li></ul><p>Earning all those socks will keep your bean busy for a while!
