I’m more of a PC person than a console one, and this handheld gaming PC has just enough over the <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/entertainment/why-i-prefer-steam-deck-over-nintendo-switch-2\" target=\"_blank\"><u>Steam Deck</u></a> to make it worth it to me, from a more powerful chip to a bigger and higher resolution screen. But even with all that, it was only ever intended as a stopgap between the full-fledged Legion Go and Legion Go 2. Now, Lenovo’s officially announced the Legion Go 2, and while it brings back some features that the Legion Go S cut, it also loses out on some of what made the Legion Go S so special, which puts it in an odd middle ground.</p><h2 id=\"a-new-look-and-feel\">A new look and feel</h2><div>\n    <p><img src=\"https://lifehacker.com/imagery/articles/01K4B320Q9S7JGQHBMXJ1FVVNK/images-1.fill.size_2000x1125.v1757015102.jpg\" alt=\"Legion Go 2 with a detached controller\" srcset=\"https://lifehacker.com/imagery/articles/01K4B320Q9S7JGQHBMXJ1FVVNK/images-1.fill.size_800x450.v1757015102.jpg 800w, https://lifehacker.com/imagery/articles/01K4B320Q9S7JGQHBMXJ1FVVNK/images-1.fill.size_1400x788.v1757015102.jpg 1400w, https://lifehacker.com/imagery/articles/01K4B320Q9S7JGQHBMXJ1FVVNK/images-1.fill.size_2000x1125.v1757015102.jpg 2000w\" />\n            </p>\n            <p><span></span>\n                                        <span>Credit: Michelle Ehrhardt</span>\n                    </p>\n    </div>\n<p>Starting off with the positives: the Legion Go 2 is now a heck of a lot nicer to hold and look at. The first Legion Go set itself apart with detachable wireless controllers on a rail system, similar to the original Nintendo Switch. Lenovo got rid of these on the S, but since those controllers were a little squarish and sharp on the original Go, I didn’t mind their absence. The Legion Go 2 brings the detachable controllers back, but updates them with a rounder, more ergonomic design, seemingly inspired by the S. Apart from looking a little less boxy, these felt way nicer in the hand when I tried them out. They even use the same rail system as the original Go, so any accessories you’ve bought or printed for that device’s controllers will work here. And yes, that means there’s still an optical sensor on the bottom of the right-hand controller, so you can still use it like a mouse (just like a <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/tech/the-switch-2s-mouse-controls-are-nintendo-at-its-most-playful\" target=\"_blank\">Switch 2 joy-con</a>). These are small touches, but they go a long way towards making the device click as “new” in my brain.</p><h2 id=\"upgraded-chips\">Upgraded chips</h2><p>The big upgrade here is the new chips, which have been punched up to AMD’s Z2 family and go up to the Z2 Extreme. That’s a generational leap over the processor in most premium gaming handhelds these days, including the Legion Go S and the <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/asus-rog-ally-z1-review-1850976924\" target=\"_blank\"><u>Asus ROG Ally</u></a>. Given that the Z1 Extreme in the S was already giving me a good 8 to 10 extra frames over the Steam Deck even while running at higher resolutions, you can expect even more performance from this model, although Lenovo didn’t give me any estimates or hands-on gameplay demos. The memory can also be pushed to up to 32GB now (double the previous max of 16GB), which will help ensure smoother play, and the storage now goes up to 2TB, which doubles the first Legion Go’s capacity.</p><div>\n        <p><img src=\"https://lifehacker.com/images/short-lifehacker-logo.jpg\" alt=\"Lifehacker Logo\" /></p><div>\n            <p><span>You May Also Like</span></p>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n<h2 id=\"an-oled-screen\">An OLED screen</h2><div>\n    <p><img src=\"https://lifehacker.com/imagery/articles/01K4B320Q9S7JGQHBMXJ1FVVNK/images-2.fill.size_2000x1125.v1757015102.jpg\" alt=\"Legion Go 2 desktop\" srcset=\"https://lifehacker.com/imagery/articles/01K4B320Q9S7JGQHBMXJ1FVVNK/images-2.fill.size_800x450.v1757015102.jpg 800w, https://lifehacker.com/imagery/articles/01K4B320Q9S7JGQHBMXJ1FVVNK/images-2.fill.size_1400x788.v1757015102.jpg 1400w, https://lifehacker.com/imagery/articles/01K4B320Q9S7JGQHBMXJ1FVVNK/images-2.fill.size_2000x1125.v1757015102.jpg 2000w\" />\n            </p>\n            <p><span></span>\n                                        <span>Credit: Michelle Ehrhardt</span>\n                    </p>\n    </div>\n<p>There are a few other extras as well, like an updated battery with 74WhR of capacity rather than the 49WhR on the first model, as well as a fingerprint reader. Most noteworthy is that while the screen is the same size as before, at 8.8 inches, it trades some resolution for OLED. While the prior IPS model was 1600P, this version is now 1200P, although that’s a compromise I’m willing to make for OLED-level contrast, especially since higher resolutions tend to have diminishing returns on handheld screens. Aside from that, it’s still 144Hz, touch compatible, and maxes out at 500 nits of brightness.</p><p>Otherwise, it’s largely the same unit, albeit a little thicker, which Lenovo says is for extra thermal headroom, and a little weightier, at around 2.03 pounds rather than 1.88 (I didn’t notice that during my short hands-on, although that could change over an extended play session). On top of those mouse controls, you still get a touchpad on the right controller, a sturdy kickstand across the length of the device, all the same buttons, and everything else you might have come to expect from the original Legion Go. </p><div>\n            <p><span>\n                What do you think so far?\n            </span>\n        </p></div>\n<h2 id=\"the-downsides\">The downsides</h2><div>\n    <p><img src=\"https://lifehacker.com/imagery/articles/01K4B320Q9S7JGQHBMXJ1FVVNK/images-3.fill.size_2000x1125.v1757015103.jpg\" alt=\"Legion Go 2 docked\" srcset=\"https://lifehacker.com/imagery/articles/01K4B320Q9S7JGQHBMXJ1FVVNK/images-3.fill.size_800x450.v1757015103.jpg 800w, https://lifehacker.com/imagery/articles/01K4B320Q9S7JGQHBMXJ1FVVNK/images-3.fill.size_1400x788.v1757015103.jpg 1400w, https://lifehacker.com/imagery/articles/01K4B320Q9S7JGQHBMXJ1FVVNK/images-3.fill.size_2000x1125.v1757015103.jpg 2000w\" />\n            </p>\n            <p><span></span>\n                                        <span>Credit: Michelle Ehrhardt</span>\n                    </p>\n    </div>\n<p>I’ll admit that after the S, I’m a little torn. The first Legion Go always seemed a little over-engineered to me, with the controllers in particular being far less intuitive than Nintendo’s joy-cons. If you always struggled to remove or connect the Legion Go controllers before, or were disappointed that you couldn’t use them for two-player, this won’t change your mind, even if these controllers are easier to hold than the original model’s. The S was so seamless to use that, despite being more powerful, the Go 2 comes across as a little user-unfriendly. While keeping compatibility with previous accessories is a nice touch, after <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/entertainment/nintendo-switch-2-review\" target=\"_blank\"><u>using the Switch 2</u></a>, I can’t help but think magnets might have been the way to go here. Or even just controllers that are attached to the system, to be honest.</p><p>That user unfriendliness is also true of the operating system. Unlike the Legion Go S, The Legion Go 2 is only launching with Windows, and Lenovo refused to tell me whether SteamOS was planned to be added as an option further down the line. That’s a huge disappointment after the Legion Go S became the first non Steam Deck handheld to officially ship with Valve’s operating system as an option. While it sounds like a minor gripe, Windows has proven across multiple devices to be a <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/entertainment/how-to-install-steamos-on-a-windows-gaming-handheld\" target=\"_blank\"><u>pain to navigate with a controller</u></a>, while SteamOS is built from the ground-up for controllers. It can also drag down performance, as it’s more resource hungry, and licensing Windows can inflate a device’s price. Microsoft says it’s working on addressing these issues, but we won’t see how that works out until the <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/entertainment/xboxs-first-gaming-handheld-feels-like-a-missed-opportunity\" target=\"_blank\"><u>Xbox handheld</u></a> hits the market. In the meantime, I would have loved to have more options.</p><h2 id=\"worth-the-price\">Worth the price?</h2><p>In other words, I don’t see this replacing the Legion Go S for me, and another big part of that is the price. The Legion Go S starts $200 more than the Steam Deck, and improves on that device just enough that I think it’s worth it. Meanwhile, the Legion Go 2 starts at $1,049, which is several hundred dollars more than the Legion Go S, the first model, or even competitors like the <a href=\"https://www.cnet.com/tech/gaming/asus-rog-ally-x-review-gen-1-5-of-windows-gaming-handhelds/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"open in a new window\"><u>ROG Ally X</u></a>. It’ll be available next month, and while I’d love for it to be a straight upgrade on the Legion Go S or even some kind of adult Nintendo Switch 2, I expect it’ll end up competing more with <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/tech/best-gaming-laptops\" target=\"_blank\">gaming laptops</a> than anything else. That’s great for the rich kids who already go for devices like that, but after the Legion Go S, I can't help but feel like Lenovo's missing an opportunity to take the follow-up in a more attractive, less niche direction. I suppose I'll wait for a Go S 2 in the meantime.</p>\n            </article>\n    </div>\n<div>\n    <div>\n        <p><span>The Download Newsletter</span>\n            <span>Never miss a tech story</span>\n        </p>\n        <p><img src=\"https://lifehacker.com/images/team/Jake.png\" alt=\"Jake Peterson portrait\" />\n            <span>Jake Peterson\n            </span>\n            <span>Senior tech editor</span>\n        </p>\n        <p><span>Get the latest tech news, <span></span>reviews, <span></span>and advice from Jake and the team.</span>\n    </p></div>\n    <div>\n        <p><span>The Download Newsletter</span>\n            <span><span>Never miss a tech story.</span> Get the latest tech news, <span></span>reviews, <span></span>and advice from Jake and the team.</span>\n        </p>\n    </div>\n</div>\n    </div>\n            <div>\n                <p><span>\n                        Keep Scrolling for Next Article\n                    </span>\n                </p>\n            </div>\n        </div>"

For one, they’re beautiful, bringing a blast of fresh, natural beauty into our homes. For another, they’re <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/how-to-cultivate-a-houseplant-collection-on-a-budget-1850168112\" target=\"_blank\">relatively inexpensive</a>, especially when compared to other interior design elements. And some houseplants are <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/home/best-houseplants-for-beginners\" target=\"_blank\">easy to care for</a>, which is ideal for busy lives.</p><p>Despite their popularity, however, most of us sleep on another potential benefit of houseplants: Practical, everyday uses. Houseplants don’t have to be merely decorative—the right ones combine that natural beauty with applications that can improve your life in myriad ways. If you’re looking to start an indoor garden or add to your existing collection, here are some of the most useful houseplants you can acquire.</p><h2 id=\"best-houseplants-for-air-quality\">Best houseplants for air quality</h2><p>While claims that houseplants will scrub and purify your indoor air are overblown, there’s no doubt that houseplants <em>do</em> have a <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/what-you-need-is-a-dust-reducing-houseplant-1847983143\" target=\"_blank\">positive impact on your indoor air quality</a>. All plants absorb carbon dioxide and excrete oxygen, after all, so just by having them you’ll be freshening up your home’s air. But specific plants also have more uses:</p><div>\n        <p><img src=\"https://lifehacker.com/images/short-lifehacker-logo.jpg\" alt=\"Lifehacker Logo\" /></p><div>\n            <p><span>You May Also Like</span></p>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n<ul><li><p><strong>Improving humidity.</strong> If your house is feeling dry, giving you itchy eyes and skin, adding some <strong>spider plants</strong> to specific rooms can improve the situation. Studies have shown that spider plants can <a href=\"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/311962418_Evapotranspiration_from_Spider_and_Jade_Plants_Can_Improve_Relative_Humidity_in_an_Interior_Environment\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"open in a new window\">improve relative humidity in a room</a>, making the space more comfortable. It should be noted that it’s all about leaf surface area, so you need a lot of them to make a real difference: 25 plants in 4-inch pots resulted in a 10% gain of relative humidity in the study, for example, though you could have fewer plants if they were larger.</p></li><li><p><strong>Dust reduction.</strong> Many houseplants can improve the air quality in your home by <a href=\"https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/1420326X16671016\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"open in a new window\">capturing dust</a> and other contaminants, trapping the stuff on their ridged leaves and stems. <strong>Peace lilies</strong>,<strong> English ivy</strong>, and <strong>rubber plants</strong> are great choices to have in the house for dust control. Note that these plants remove dust mechanically by capturing it, not by absorbing it in any way—you’ll need to dust them to actually remove the dust.</p></li></ul><h2 id=\"plants-with-medicinal-uses\">Plants with medicinal uses</h2><p>Some houseplants are useful because they can be used to treat a range of mild discomforts and injuries. You might not be able to throw away all your store-bought stuff just because you have a few potted plants about, but if you include some of these plants in your collection, you can benefit from their proven healing qualities:</p><div>\n            <p><span>\n                What do you think so far?\n            </span>\n        </p></div>\n<ul><li><p><strong>Aloe Vera</strong> has soothing properties, and the gel from a cut leaf can be used to treat minor burns (including sunburns) or other skin irritations. It’s also often used as a mild laxative.</p></li><li><p><strong>Mint</strong>. Mint leaf teas have been <a href=\"https://www.oatext.com/pdf/IFNM-5-203.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"open in a new window\">used in folk medicine</a> for centuries, and there’s <a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16767798/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"open in a new window\">some evidence</a> that mint leaf teas can soothe the digestive tract. Having some fresh mint on hand in the form of an attractive houseplant means you can brew up a little relief any time you want.</p></li><li><p><strong>Chamomile.</strong> Chamomile is often noted for its <a href=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S2210803323000921\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"open in a new window\">soothing qualities</a>, reducing anxiety, aiding digestion, and improving sleep.</p></li></ul><h2 id=\"edible-plants-to-grow-indoors\">Edible plants to grow indoors</h2><p>Your houseplants can be a source of ingredients in your cooking:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Herbs.</strong> The most obvious choices will be herbs like <strong>basil</strong>, <strong>sage</strong>, and <strong>parsley</strong> (among many, many other choices). These plants are attractive, easy to grow indoors, and can supply you with fresh seasoning for your meals.</p></li><li><p><strong>Fruits.</strong> Several fruit trees actually <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/home/best-fruit-trees-to-grow-indoors\" target=\"_blank\">thrive indoors</a>. Figs, <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/how-to-grow-a-lemon-tree-indoors-1847408904\" target=\"_blank\">lemons</a>, cherries, <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/how-to-grow-a-blueberry-bush-in-your-home-1847439584\" target=\"_blank\">blueberries</a>, and even bananas can be grown indoors, supplementing your grocery bills all year round.</p></li><li><p><strong>Vegetables</strong>. <strong>Tomatoes</strong>, <strong>peppers</strong>, and <strong>kale</strong> are all beautiful houseplants that will also <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/how-to-start-an-indoor-vegetable-garden-1847548438\" target=\"_blank\">produce delicious veggies</a> for your salads and other recipes.</p></li></ul><h2 id=\"best-plants-for-sleep-aid\">Best plants for sleep aid</h2><p>There are a lot of reasons to put houseplants <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/the-best-plants-to-put-in-your-bedroom-1850727943\" target=\"_blank\">in your bedroom</a>, and better sleep is one of them. If you have trouble relaxing and falling asleep, just having plants in your bedroom can create a more serene, calm atmosphere that can promote better sleep. There’s also <a href=\"https://academic.oup.com/sleep/article/47/Supplement_1/A176/7654499\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"open in a new window\">some evidence</a> that scent can influence the quality and duration of sleep cycles—but it doesn’t have to be that complicated. Having plants that make the bedroom smell nice (like lavender, jasmine, or valerian) can contribute to a pleasant atmosphere that’s conducive to a good night’s sleep.</p>\n            </article>\n    </div>\n<div>\n    <div>\n        <p><span>Smarter Home &amp; Living <span>Newsletter</span></span>\n            <span>Never miss a story</span>\n        </p>\n        <p><img src=\"https://lifehacker.com/images/team/Lindsey.png\" alt=\"Lindsey Ellefson portrait\" />\n            <span>Lindsey Ellefson\n            </span>\n            <span>Features editor</span>\n        </p>\n        <p><span><span>Get the latest smart home news, trends,</span> <span>and advice from Lindsey and the team.</span></span>\n    </p></div>\n    <div>\n        <p><span>Smarter Home &amp; Living <span>Newsletter</span></span>\n            <span><span>Never miss a story.</span> <span>Get the latest smart home news, trends,</span> <span>and advice from Lindsey and the team.</span></span>\n        </p>\n    </div>\n</div>\n    </div>\n            <div>\n                <p><span>\n                        Keep Scrolling for Next Article\n                    </span>\n                </p>\n            </div>\n        </div>"

While the update doesn't ship with a ton of new features, what <em>is</em> new here is going to be quite obvious. If you have a Pixel that can run Android 16, your phone is going to look and act quite different. Plus, if you have Pixel Buds Pro 2 or a Pixel Watch, there are some new updates to explore as well.  </p><p>Google says that these updates are rolling out starting today, though they will continue \"over the next few weeks.\" As such, you might see some of all of the features hit your devices today, but don't be surprised if they take more time to appear.</p><div>\n        <p><img src=\"https://lifehacker.com/images/short-lifehacker-logo.jpg\" alt=\"Lifehacker Logo\" /></p><div>\n            <p><span>You May Also Like</span></p>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n<h2 id=\"material-3-expressive\">Material 3 Expressive</h2><p>Back in May, <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/tech/google-announced-new-android-16-design\" target=\"_blank\">Google announced Material 3 Expressive</a>, the company's latest design language for Android. Material 3 Expressive has new UI elements, text styles, bright colors, and fresh animations, and while it's not a total design overhaul, it's not a particularly subtle update, either. It also comes with some additional features, like new iPhone-style <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/tech/how-to-set-up-android-calling-cards-for-friends-family\" target=\"_blank\">Calling Cards</a> for Google's Phone app.   </p><p>This new design launched first with <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/tech/what-we-know-about-the-pixel-10-and-pixel-10-pro-made-by-google-2025\" target=\"_blank\">Google's Pixel 10 line of phones</a>, so <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/tech/the-best-preorder-deals-on-pixel-10-made-by-google-2025\" target=\"_blank\">if you bought one</a>, you've already experienced it. However, if you're still rocking an older Pixel, you no longer need to wait to try out Material 3 Expressive. Google announced that the new update is rolling out to Pixel 6 and newer, including Pixel Tablet, starting today. </p><div>\n            <p><span>\n                What do you think so far?\n            </span>\n        </p></div>\n<h2 id=\"adaptive-audio\">Adaptive Audio</h2><p>If you have a set of Pixel Buds Pro 2, you're getting a pretty big update later this month. Google will be rolling Adaptive Audio, a feature that analyzes your surroundings and adjusts audio levels accordingly, to these earbuds. Google doesn't go into much detail here, but it seems similar to <a href=\"https://support.google.com/googlepixelbuds/answer/9642077?hl=en\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"open in a new window\">Adaptive Sound</a>, which is available on previous Pixel Buds devices. Google also highlights \"Loud Noise Protection,\" a feature that \"protects\" your ears if you encounter a loud sound. Again, few details here, but it sounds like Pixel Buds Pro 2 will limit the audio levels coming through the buds when something like a siren passes by. </p><h2 id=\"google-maps-updates-for-pixel-watch\">Google Maps updates for Pixel Watch</h2><p>I feel like smartwatches could be the ideal navigation device. When you're on the move, you don't really want to be looking at your phone all the time to see when the next turn is. Instead, I'd rather glance at my watch, and keep my eyes on my surroundings. </p><p>To that point, Google's latest Pixel Drop makes navigating with a Pixel Watch a bit easier. Now, you can start walking or biking directions on Google Maps on your phone, and your Pixel Watch will automatically pick up navigation. That way, you can set your course on your Pixel, put it away, and be on your way.</p>\n            </article>\n    </div>\n<div>\n    <div>\n        <p><span>The Download Newsletter</span>\n            <span>Never miss a tech story</span>\n        </p>\n        <p><img src=\"https://lifehacker.com/images/team/Jake.png\" alt=\"Jake Peterson portrait\" />\n            <span>Jake Peterson\n            </span>\n            <span>Senior tech editor</span>\n        </p>\n        <p><span>Get the latest tech news, <span></span>reviews, <span></span>and advice from Jake and the team.</span>\n    </p></div>\n    <div>\n        <p><span>The Download Newsletter</span>\n            <span><span>Never miss a tech story.</span> Get the latest tech news, <span></span>reviews, <span></span>and advice from Jake and the team.</span>\n        </p>\n    </div>\n</div>\n    </div>\n            <div>\n                <p><span>\n                        Keep Scrolling for Next Article\n                    </span>\n                </p>\n            </div>\n        </div>"

results, <a href=\"https://www.google.com/preferences/source?q=lifehacker.com\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"open in a new window\">including adding my work at Lifehacker as a preferred source</a></em><em>.</em></p><hr /><p>You once needed a decent computer and expensive software in order to seriously edit video. No longer. These days, you can download a free app on any smartphone, and instantly have the tools necessary to put together a legitimate video, especially for social media platforms like TikTok,  Instagram, and YouTube. </p><p>It would have been difficult to imagine something like Adobe Premiere working properly on a smartphone in the heyday of desktop video editing, but these days, it's a reality. Perhaps that's why Adobe is changing with the times. Following its <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/tech/photoshop-is-officially-available-on-iphone-and-android\" target=\"_blank\">Photoshop mobile app</a> rollout earlier this year, <a href=\"https://blog.adobe.com/en/publish/2025/09/04/adobe-premiere-bringing-pro-quality-video-editing-to-your-iphone\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"open in a new window\">Adobe announced on Thursday</a> that Premiere, the company's flagship video editing software, is coming to smartphones. The app will release first for iPhone on Sept. 30, though the company says an Android version is in the works. </p><div>\n        <p><img src=\"https://lifehacker.com/images/short-lifehacker-logo.jpg\" alt=\"Lifehacker Logo\" /></p><div>\n            <p><span>You May Also Like</span></p>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n<h2 id=\"premiere-for-iphone\">Premiere for iPhone </h2><p>According to Adobe, if you're familiar with Premiere, you'll be familiar with its mobile adaptation. There's the same multi-track timeline, with \"vibrant colors and dynamic audio waveforms,\" that supports frame-by-frame trimming, layering, and tuning. There are automatic captions, subtitles, layers for video, audio, text, and 4K HDR support. </p><p>Unlike the current desktop version of Premiere, which requires a subscription, the mobile version of Premiere is free to download and use. Adobe says that only users who need extra storage or want to use the app's AI features need to pay—though it doesn't appear that Adobe has released pricing information yet. To that point, Adobe is pushing some of its AI features here, including Generative Sound Effects, which combines your voice with text prompts to produce a stylized voice over. There's also Enhance Speech, which uses AI in an attempt to improve the quality of your voice recordings.</p><p>You can also use <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/tech/adobe-is-also-making-an-ai-video-generator\" target=\"_blank\">Adobe Firefly</a>, the company's AI content generator, to generate video, image, and audio assets. Adobe says Firefly content is safe for commercial use, so you should have no issue including generations in your content. In addition, you can tap into any of the assets in the Adobe Stock library, which includes music, sound effects, photos, graphics, and videos. </p><p>While it seems like the major editing tools you'd expect from the full Premiere app are here, there's no doubt this experience was designed for mobile—and the platforms that mobile video editors tend to produce for. Adobe says you can export your projects instantly to platforms like TikTok, YouTube Shorts, or Instagram—as well as Premiere Pro, if you have it—in case you'd like to finish the video in these apps. If you complete the video in Premiere, you can publish the finished product directly to TikTok, YouTube Shorts, and Instagram. Videos can also automatically resize depending on the platform you're sending it to.  </p><p><a href=\"https://apps.apple.com/us/app/adobe-premiere-video-editor/id6742757464\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"open in a new window\">You can preorder the app today through the App Store</a>—though, again, the app itself is free. By preordering it, you are simply telling the App Store to download the app for you when it becomes available.</p><div>\n            <p><span>\n                What do you think so far?\n            </span>\n        </p></div>\n<h2 id=\"will-premiere-on-mobile-be-worth-it\">Will Premiere on mobile be worth it?</h2><p>There are <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/tech/the-best-alternatives-to-capcut\" target=\"_blank\">a lot of video editing apps out there</a> specifically designed for mobile use. That's not to say Premiere won't be a good editing option: Adobe's editor is popular for a reason, and if they've properly designed it to work on an iPhone or Android, it could be a serious threat to existing options like CapCut and LumaFusion. In fact, the company has already dipped its toe into mobile editors before, with Adobe Premiere Rush. That app is much more basic than the version of Premiere Adobe is announcing today.    </p><p>Many users will likely enjoy trying out the app free of charge, and I know most (if not all) will have no problem shirking Adobe's expensive subscriptions. However, as the saying goes, if a product is free, <em>you</em> are the product. According to Premiere's App Privacy report in the App Store, there's a lot of data Adobe collects from you when using this app, including:</p><ul><li><p>Purchases </p></li><li><p>Location</p></li><li><p>Contact Info</p></li><li><p>User Content</p></li><li><p>Search History</p></li><li><p>Identifiers</p></li><li><p>Usage Data</p></li><li><p>Diagnostics</p></li><li><p>\"Other Data\"</p></li></ul><p>Sure, it's great to have a full-fledged video editor on your iPhone, but will it be worth the privacy invasion? It's not the only one of Adobe's apps to collect this much data, nor does Adobe have <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/tech/adobe-has-responded-to-criticism-of-its-new-terms-of-service\" target=\"_blank\">the best track record</a> when it comes to user privacy, but still, it's worth a consideration before you use it. </p><p>If Premiere for mobile is as capable an editor as Premiere Pro, I imagine this could make for a great experience, especially for those already in the Adobe ecosystem. For others, there may be some compromises to weigh. Myself? I might stick to other apps that are a little less creepy.</p>\n            </article>\n    </div>\n<div>\n    <div>\n        <p><span>The Download Newsletter</span>\n            <span>Never miss a tech story</span>\n        </p>\n        <p><img src=\"https://lifehacker.com/images/team/Jake.png\" alt=\"Jake Peterson portrait\" />\n            <span>Jake Peterson\n            </span>\n            <span>Senior tech editor</span>\n        </p>\n        <p><span>Get the latest tech news, <span></span>reviews, <span></span>and advice from Jake and the team.</span>\n    </p></div>\n    <div>\n        <p><span>The Download Newsletter</span>\n            <span><span>Never miss a tech story.</span> Get the latest tech news, <span></span>reviews, <span></span>and advice from Jake and the team.</span>\n        </p>\n    </div>\n</div>\n    </div>\n            <div>\n                <p><span>\n                        Keep Scrolling for Next Article\n                    </span>\n                </p>\n            </div>\n        </div>\n    </div>"

Each week, we tackle the misunderstandings that are going viral.</p>\n        </span>\n    </p>\n    <h2 id=\"toc\">Table of Contents</h2>\n    <article>\n        <hr />\n        <p>I'm sure you've seen displays of \"male enhancement\" products at your local gas station, liquor store, or head shop. With brand names like \"Rhino Power 4000,\" \"Black Mamba,\" or \"X Rated Honey,\" these \"herbal\" or \"all natural\" supplements boast that they will \"increase stamina,\" give you \"rock hard power,\" and \"add inches.\" The packaging may not state it directly, but the overall message is extremely clear: These pills treat erectile dysfunction. </p><p>If you're like me, you've seen these pills and thought, \"These would never work.\" Well, my skeptical friend, this week <em>we</em> are the ones who are wrong. Gas station boner pills often work exactly as expected—but this isn't because herbal ingredients like ginseng and Yohimbe bark are miracle cures for ED. It's because many of these pills are basically mislabeled Viagra or Cialis. It's true: <a href=\"https://www.fda.gov/drugs/medication-health-fraud-notifications/sexual-enhancement-and-energy-product-notifications\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"open in a new window\">The Food and Drug Administration</a> has found all kinds of prescription medication in hundreds of different shady \"supplements,\" but you can still buy them. You shouldn't, but you can. </p><p>How a rack full of unlicensed prescription pills came to be easily available at your local 7-11 is a twisty story. Most of these \"supplements\" originate in foreign factories, especially in China and India, where pharmaceutical manufacturing is cheaper and less tightly regulated. From there, they are distributed as \"dietary supplements.\"</p><div>\n        <p><img src=\"https://lifehacker.com/images/short-lifehacker-logo.jpg\" alt=\"Lifehacker Logo\" /></p><div>\n            <p><span>You May Also Like</span></p>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n<p>Unlike prescription and over-the-counter drugs, dietary supplements don’t have to be tested by the Food and Drug Administration before they're sold, so anyone who wants to make a quick buck can fill some capsules with dried grass, call it a supplement, and start selling it. </p><h2 id=\"the-fda-and-supplement-whack-a-mole\">The FDA and supplement whack-a-mole</h2><p>Of course, hiding the active ingredients in Viagra and Cialis in what you call a supplement is against the law, but the FDA doesn't have enforcement power until <em>after</em> the sale. If people get sick or someone complains, the Feds can step in, but not before. </p><p>To its credit, the FDA steps in frequently. The agency maintains an ever-updated database of problematic \"<a href=\"https://www.fda.gov/drugs/medication-health-fraud-notifications/sexual-enhancement-and-energy-product-notifications\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"open in a new window\">Sexual Enhancement and Energy Products,</a>\" where you can read all about the illicit ingredients in supplements like <a href=\"https://www.fda.gov/drugs/medication-health-fraud/public-notification-green-lumber-contains-hidden-drug-ingredient\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"open in a new window\">Green Lumber</a> (contains tadalafil, the active ingredient in Cialis), <a href=\"https://www.fda.gov/drugs/medication-health-fraud/himgo-may-be-harmful-due-hidden-drug-ingredients\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"open in a new window\">HimGo</a> (contains sildenafil, the active ingredient in Viagra, and diclofenac, an over-the-counter anti-inflammatory drug), and \"<a href=\"https://www.fda.gov/drugs/medication-health-fraud/versace-real-honey-men-may-be-harmful-due-hidden-drug-ingredients\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"open in a new window\">Versace Real Honey</a>\" (sildenafil, tadalafil, and acetaminophen). The FDA even prosecutes people occasionally for selling this stuff, like Jacksonville \"business executive\" Jae Hong Kim who <a href=\"https://www.jacksonville.com/story/news/local/2025/06/27/maker-of-2-million-male-enhancement-pills-pleads-to-misbranding-meds/84344398007/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"open in a new window\">recently pled guilty</a> to selling prescription drugs marketed as “Rhino 69” and “MegaZen Power 5000.”</p><p>But Kim's story is the exception, not the rule. The FDA may pull Mega-Mamba Mojo pills from the market, but in a few weeks, your local gas station will be selling Lightning Lad Libido pills instead, maybe from the same shell company, but now with a different name. These pills can be produced for pennies and sold for up to $20 per, so the risk/reward ratio is solid for people who sell the stuff. </p><div>\n            <p><span>\n                What do you think so far?\n            </span>\n        </p></div>\n<h2 id=\"why-you-should-not-take-male-enhancement-products-from-gas-stations\">Why you should not take male \"enhancement\" products from gas stations</h2><p>You shouldn't take erection pills from a gas station; first, because you don't need to be <em>enhanced</em>; you're beautiful how you are, King. But if you're treating erectile dysfunction, you can do better than a shady supplement. Taking strange pills from a gas station is a bad idea for a lot of reasons, including: </p><ul><li><p><strong>Unknown dosage</strong>: Even if you know it's sildenafil, you have no idea how much you’re taking, but it's usually \"a crap-ton.\" FDA tests of these products have found amounts of prescription drugs well above what a doctor would order, and that often leads to severe headaches, low blood pressure, dizziness, vision changes, or even heart problems. </p></li><li><p><strong>Dangerous interactions</strong>: If you’re on heart meds, blood pressure drugs, or nitrates, ED drugs are generally not safe. For that matter, if you're on <em>any</em> drug they're generally not safe, because literally any drug could be in them.</p></li><li><p><strong>Randomness:</strong> Lack of honest labeling means that you might get Ginkgo Biloba when you're hoping for Viagra, and vice-versa. </p></li></ul><p>Instead of confiding in the guy behind the counter at your local head shop, talk to your doctor. They have heard it before, and the prices of real-deal E.D. are usually better than the gas station equivalent. It's $2 to $10 per pill for generic sildenafil (Viagra) and about $6 to $18 per pill for generic tadalafil (Cialis), where gas station drugs can cost as much as $20 per dose. </p><h2 id=\"why-they-still-sell\">Why they still sell </h2><p>So these pills are dangerous, expensive, and shady, and the FDA constantly warns us not to take them. Why are they still <em>everywhere</em>? First because the minimal oversight of dietary supplements has been baked into law since the <a href=\"https://ods.od.nih.gov/About/DSHEA_Wording.aspx\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"open in a new window\">Dietary Supplement Health and Education Act (DSHEA)</a> passed in 1994. But also because these pills offer both an easy solution and an illicit thrill. The combination of curiosity, desperation, and sheepishness makes those shiny packages by the slushie machine an irresistible impulse purchase to some, especially people who are too shy to discuss medical issues with their doctors. So they keep selling because impulse, embarrassment, and weak regulation all collide, and the result is a product that’s as easy to get as it is risky to take. </p>\n            </article>\n    </div>\n<div>\n    <div>\n        <p><span>The Daily Newsletter</span>\n            <span>Ready to do everything better?</span>\n        </p>\n        <p><img src=\"https://lifehacker.com/images/team/Jordan.png\" alt=\"Jordan Calhoun portrait\" />\n            <span>Jordan Calhoun\n            </span>\n            <span>Editor in chief</span>\n        </p>\n        <p><span><span>Get daily tips, tricks, <span>and tech guides</span></span> <span>from Jordan and the team.</span></span>\n    </p></div>\n    <div>\n        <p><span>The Daily Newsletter</span>\n            <span><span>Ready to do everything better?</span> <span>Get daily tips, tricks, <span>and tech guides</span></span> <span>from Jordan and the team.</span></span>\n        </p>\n    </div>\n</div>\n    </div>\n            <div>\n                <p><span>\n                        Keep Scrolling for Next Article\n                    </span>\n                </p>\n            </div>\n        </div>"
