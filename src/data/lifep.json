It doesn't help that I 1) live above a noisy Brooklyn bar and 2) share a bed with someone who snores and grinds his teeth. My go-to solution had been wearing my <a href=\"https://zdcs.link/a01KDr?pageview_type=Standard&template=Explainers&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=Anker%20Soundcore%20headphones&short_url=a01KDr&u=https%3A%2F%2Flifehacker.com%2Ftech%2Fozlo-sleepbuds-review&event_label=Anker%20Soundcore%20headphones\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"open in a new window\">Anker Soundcore headphones</a> with some sort of \"deep sleep\" playlist, but to be honest, sleeping with over-ear headphones is like trying to nap while wearing a helmet. Uncomfortable, potentially unsafe, and a surefire way to destroy my expensive electronics.</p><p>That's what led me to the Ozlo Sleepbuds, <a href=\"https://zdcs.link/Qp4Vng?pageview_type=Standard&template=Explainers&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=currently%20available%20for%20%24299&short_url=Qp4Vng&u=https%3A%2F%2Flifehacker.com%2Ftech%2Fozlo-sleepbuds-review&event_label=currently%20available%20for%20%24299\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"open in a new window\">currently available for $299</a>. Unlike my <a href=\"https://zdcs.link/aN8XnV?pageview_type=Standard&template=Explainers&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=AirPod%20Pros&short_url=aN8XnV&u=https%3A%2F%2Flifehacker.com%2Ftech%2Fozlo-sleepbuds-review&event_label=AirPod%20Pros\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"open in a new window\">AirPod Pros</a>, which are great for daily use but pierce my eardrums when I lie on my side, the Ozlo sleepbuds have a remarkably low profile. The pre-installed ear tips fit perfectly, creating a secure seal without the pressure points that make traditional earbuds a nightmare for side sleepers. Despite their <a href=\"https://casabona.org/2025/01/ozlo-sleepbuds-review/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"open in a new window\">mixed</a> online reviews, I've found that these smart earplugs really do help me sleep deeper (and possibly saved my relationship).</p><div>\n        <p><img src=\"https://lifehacker.com/images/short-lifehacker-logo.jpg\" alt=\"Lifehacker Logo\" /></p><div>\n            <p><span>You May Also Like</span></p>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n<h2 id=\"the-app-experience\">The app experience</h2><p>Here's where the Ozlo sleepbuds diverge from typical wireless earbuds, and honestly, it's a double-edged sword. Unlike AirPods that connect automatically via Bluetooth, these require opening the Ozlo app like a control center. You'll need to select your soundscape, adjust volume, and set your alarm through the app interface.</p><div>\n    <p><img src=\"https://lifehacker.com/imagery/articles/01K5S72NBMBKD6972CACS3XRXK/images-1.fill.size_2000x1125.v1758561654.png\" alt=\"Ozlo app screenshots\" srcset=\"https://lifehacker.com/imagery/articles/01K5S72NBMBKD6972CACS3XRXK/images-1.fill.size_800x450.v1758561654.png 800w, https://lifehacker.com/imagery/articles/01K5S72NBMBKD6972CACS3XRXK/images-1.fill.size_1400x788.v1758561654.png 1400w, https://lifehacker.com/imagery/articles/01K5S72NBMBKD6972CACS3XRXK/images-1.fill.size_2000x1125.v1758561654.png 2000w\" />\n            </p>\n            <p><span>Setting up my Ozlo sleepbuds.</span>\n                                        <span>Credit: Meredith Dietz</span>\n                    </p>\n    </div>\n<p>Initially, this felt clunky compared to the seamless connectivity we're all used to. But after a few nights, I found myself positively reframing this friction as more of a \"ritual.\" Opening the app, placing the buds in my ears, and selecting a soundscape became a bedtime ritual that signaled to my brain it was time to wind down. </p><h2 id=\"wearing-my-sleepbuds-through-the-night\">Wearing my sleepbuds through the night</h2><p>The moment of truth came on my first night testing them against my boyfriend's powerful snoring. I opted for the \"ocean tide\" sound to lull me to sleep. The audio quality is solid, especially knowing these were created by former Bose engineers.</p><p>So: Did these earbuds completely eliminate my partner's snoring? Not entirely—his snores are truly in a league of their own. But the combination of noise blocking and the ocean tide sound <em>significantly </em>reduced my nightly interruptions from constant to few and far between. Most importantly, when I did hear him, it didn't immediately snap me awake. The soundscapes seemed to cushion the noise, making it less startling.</p><p>But the street noise from the bar below? Completely gone. The upstairs neighbors walking around? Barely noticeable. These Sleepbuds excel at blocking consistent ambient noise while taking the edge off sudden, disruptive sounds.</p><div>\n            <p><span>\n                What do you think so far?\n            </span>\n        </p></div>\n<p>Another feature I love is the in-ear personal alarm. Instead of a jarring phone alarm that jolts both you and your partner awake, the Sleepbuds gently vibrate and play a soft tone directly into your ears. My boyfriend has never been woken up by my alarm since I started using them.</p><h2 id=\"tips-and-tricks-for-sleeping-with-earbuds-in\">Tips and tricks for sleeping with earbuds in</h2><p>After a few weeks of use, I've discovered several ways to optimize the Sleepbuds experience:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Find your perfect soundscape</strong>: Don't settle for the first one you try. I cycled through several before discovering that rain sounds work better for me than ocean waves or white noise.</p></li><li><p><strong>Create a charging routine</strong>: Keep the charging case on your nightstand and make putting the buds back a part of your morning routine. </p></li><li><p><strong>Experiment with volume levels</strong>: I really recommend starting lower than you think you need. Your ears adjust to the soundscape within minutes, and too-loud audio can actually be stimulating rather than relaxing.</p></li><li><p><strong>Use the app's sleep timer</strong>: If you don't want soundscapes playing all night, set a timer. You might only need the audio to fall asleep, not maintain it.</p></li><li><p><strong>Try different sleeping positions</strong>: The low profile means you can experiment with side sleeping even if you've never been able to before.</p></li></ul><h2 id=\"the-bottom-line\">The bottom line</h2><p>Are the Ozlo Sleepbuds perfect? No. The app dependency isn't ideal, and they won't completely eliminate every noise (I'm looking at you, Greg's snores). But compared to my previous solutions—uncomfortable headphones, potentially unsafe sleeping positions, or relegating myself to the couch—these Sleepbuds rock.</p><p>If I'm choosing between traditional foam earplugs, regular earbuds, or these specialized sleep buds, I'd pick the Ozlo Sleepbuds every time. My only concern? I'm becoming so dependent that I'll have trouble sleeping without them. But honestly, if that's the price for consistently good sleep in a noisy city apartment with a snoring partner, I'll take it.</p>\n            </article>\n    </div>\n<div>\n    <div>\n        <p><span>The Download Newsletter</span>\n            <span>Never miss a tech story</span>\n        </p>\n        <p><img src=\"https://lifehacker.com/images/team/Jake.png\" alt=\"Jake Peterson portrait\" />\n            <span>Jake Peterson\n            </span>\n            <span>Senior tech editor</span>\n        </p>\n        <p><span>Get the latest tech news, <span></span>reviews, <span></span>and advice from Jake and the team.</span>\n    </p></div>\n    <div>\n        <p><span>The Download Newsletter</span>\n            <span><span>Never miss a tech story.</span> Get the latest tech news, <span></span>reviews, <span></span>and advice from Jake and the team.</span>\n        </p>\n    </div>\n</div>\n    </div>\n            <div>\n                <p><span>\n                        Keep Scrolling for Next Article\n                    </span>\n                </p>\n            </div>\n        </div>\n    </div>"

that the new phones are in the hands of people who don’t work for Apple, flaws are starting to come to light. Specifically, durability testers are saying that you might want to slap a case on your new phone.</p><p>Most notably, it turns out that the iPhone 17 Pro has a major flaw with its camera bump. While the lenses themselves are fine, the edges on the raised camera “plateau” (as Apple is calling it) can apparently get scuffed just by hanging out in the same bag or pocket as household items like coins or keys. That’s according to testing by reliable YouTube reviewer Zack Nelson, or <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KrOBzFwVzwA&t=50s\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"open in a new window\"><u>JerryRigEverything</u></a>, who bemoaned Apple’s decision to avoid adding a chamfer or other protective barrier around the camera bump.</p><p>“I think it was intentional,” the YouTuber says in his video. “So it looks cooler.”</p><div>\n        <p><img src=\"https://lifehacker.com/images/short-lifehacker-logo.jpg\" alt=\"Lifehacker Logo\" /></p><div>\n            <p><span>You May Also Like</span></p>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KrOBzFwVzwA&t=50s%EF%BF%BC%EF%BF%BCAccording\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"open in a new window\">According</a> to Nelson, the scratches probably have to do with Apple’s decision to move back to anodized aluminum for this model, as opposed to the titanium the company started using with the iPhone 15 Pro. Aluminum provides better cooling, and strong scratch resistance anywhere that the anodizing process adheres to, but the catch is that without chamfers, those corners tend to get missed during the anodizing bath.</p><p>For instance, when Nelson tried to scratch the flat parts of the plateau (as well as the rest of the back of the phone), it only produced dust that could be easily wiped off, good as new. But those camera plateau corners remained permanently chipped, even after wiping.</p><p>This follows a similar report from <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-09-19/chinese-iphone-buyers-complain-of-scratches-on-new-pro-models\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"open in a new window\"><u>Bloomberg</u></a>, which noted that display models of both the blue iPhone 17 Pro and black iPhone Air seemed especially prone to scratches, as well as <a href=\"https://mashable.com/article/broken-iphone-17-air\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"open in a new window\"><u>posts from users</u></a>, pointing out scratches across all colors and multiple models of the new iPhones, especially after being <a href=\"https://x.com/amisecured/status/1969144282809581972\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"open in a new window\"><u>attached to MagSafe accessories</u></a>. While it’s possible that some of these scratches could be wiped away, as shown in Nelson’s video, those around the corners look particularly nasty, and I’m not just talking about the camera plateau.</p><div>\n            <p><span>\n                What do you think so far?\n            </span>\n        </p></div>\n<h2 id=\"how-to-stop-scratches-on-your-iphone-17\">How to stop scratches on your iPhone 17</h2><p>While it’s certainly not ideal that your bare iPhone could be susceptible to scratches, there is a simple solution—slap a case on it. That’ll hide your fancy Apple branding, sure, but it will also ensure your phone doesn’t take the brunt of your keys or loose quarters, and add a barrier around those camera plateau edges. </p><p>This year, Apple has three case options, including a clear plastic, silicone, and a new fabric style case called TechWoven. In testing by YouTuber Arun Maini, or <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/shorts/pa8bfKRgsYE\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"open in a new window\"><u>Mrwhosetheboss</u></a>, the clear case was easily susceptible to scratches by simple household objects, but all other options held up well. That’s a relief for anyone who was burned by Apple’s previous fabric case, FineWoven, which also had its own <a href=\"https://www.cnet.com/tech/mobile/my-iphone-15-pro-maxs-finewoven-case-had-a-rough-week-and-it-shows/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"open in a new window\"><u>scratch-related drama</u></a> when it debuted alongside the iPhone 15 line.</p><p>Alternatively, you could go third-party. In that case, you’ve got plenty of options.

href=\"https://lifehacker.com/tech/best-gaming-laptops?test_uuid=015ZvAUxXams0rnBpajhMg2&test_variant=B\" target=\"_blank\"><u>it’s gaming</u></a>. But if there’s another area, it’s display technology. Yep, while Apple still stands behind its trademark LCD “retina” displays, Windows machines have been adopting OLED and touchscreens for years now. Luckily, according to industry experts, MacBook owners will soon be able to plan on having better screens, too.</p><p>The latest rumors come courtesy of TF International Securities analyst Ming-Chi Kuo, as well as Bloomberg’s Mark Gurman, both of whom have reliable track records reporting on Apple products. While this <a href=\"http://bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-01-11/apple-working-on-adding-touch-screens-to-macs-in-major-turnabout?sref=9hGJlFio\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"open in a new window\"><u>isn’t the first time</u></a> Apple has been rumored to be updating its laptop displays, we’ve now got a timeline update. </p><div>\n        <p><img src=\"https://lifehacker.com/images/short-lifehacker-logo.jpg\" alt=\"Lifehacker Logo\" /></p><div>\n            <p><span>You May Also Like</span></p>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n<p>According to a <a href=\"https://x.com/mingchikuo/status/1968249865940709538\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"open in a new window\"><u>post Kuo made to X on Sept. 17</u></a>, the MacBook Pro will be the first MacBook to receive an OLED update, and as a bonus, the new screen will also support touch. The upgraded model is “expected to enter mass production by late 2026,” although as is par for the course with these leaks, the post didn’t point to any particular sources to back this up. However, if you read between the lines and look at Kuo’s past <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/tech/everything-we-know-about-the-upcoming-iphone-17-series\" target=\"_blank\">spot-on speculations</a>, it’s likely an anonymous source from within Apple.</p><p>For a little bit of assurance, Gurman, who also frequently relies on such sources, was quick to agree with Kuo’s assertions in his <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2025-09-21/mark-gurman-s-iphone-17-first-impressions-touchscreen-macbook-pro-meta-glasses?cmpid=BBD092125_POWERON&utm_medium=email&utm_source=newsletter&utm_term=250921&utm_campaign=poweron\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"open in a new window\"><u>weekly Power On newsletter</u></a> this weekend, pointing to his original reporting on the topic from 2023. However, the reporter also added that the actual release date might be closer to early 2027, depending on how quickly Apple can get supply out. He also clarified that, technically, the revamp was planned for this year, but was moved back “due to OLED supply issues.”</p><p>As for the rest of Apple’s MacBook line, neither expert has updates on that end, although Gurman speculates that “if touch resonates on the MacBook Pro, I expect it to eventually come to other Macs as well.”</p><p>While the benefits behind a touchscreen laptop are fairly self explanatory, OLED is higher on my personal wishlist. The technology’s self-illuminating pixels will help with contrast, yes, <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/tech/extend-iphone-air-battery-life\" target=\"_blank\"><u>but like on the iPhone</u></a>, they should also aid with battery life. That’s because, while current MacBooks rely on a backlight that spans the entire display, parts of an OLED screen can remain off when not in use.</p><div>\n            <p><span>\n                What do you think so far?\n            </span>\n        </p></div>\n<p>It’s notable that Kuo and Gurman’s proposed timeline also matches with the release of the <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/tech/new-ipad-rumors?test_uuid=015ZvAUxXams0rnBpajhMg2&test_variant=B\" target=\"_blank\"><u>iPad Pro just last year</u></a>, which upgraded to an OLED screen for the first time. Given that iPadOS 26 also <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/tech/ipados-26-basically-turns-your-ipad-into-macbook-wwdc-2025?test_uuid=015ZvAUxXams0rnBpajhMg2&test_variant=B\" target=\"_blank\"><u>revamped the iPad user experience to be much more like using a MacBook</u></a>, it’s likely Apple is currently planning for more parity between its product categories.</p><p>On that note, Kuo’s post also reminded readers that a <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/tech/apple-affordable-macbook-rumors\" target=\"_blank\"><u>potential lower-cost MacBook that uses an iPhone processor</u></a> could be in the works for later this year, although specifics are still largely in the dark at this point. The analyst, however, did say this model would likely not include touch support, although that could change in the future.</p><p>As for other rumored Apple products, also still largely in the dark is a potential foldable iPhone, which Gurman says “will be the star of Apple’s 2026 product lineup.” As <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/tech/everything-that-the-iphone-air-tells-us-about-the-iphone-fold\" target=\"_blank\"><u>predicted by my colleague David Nield</u></a>, the reporter’s sources are increasingly telling him that “users should imagine two titanium iPhone Airs side-by-side,” but pricing and release date specifics are still up to the imagination for now.</p>\n            </article>\n    </div>\n<div>\n    <div>\n        <p><span>The Download Newsletter</span>\n            <span>Never miss a tech story</span>\n        </p>\n        <p><img src=\"https://lifehacker.com/images/team/Jake.png\" alt=\"Jake Peterson portrait\" />\n            <span>Jake Peterson\n            </span>\n            <span>Senior tech editor</span>\n        </p>\n        <p><span>Get the latest tech news, <span></span>reviews, <span></span>and advice from Jake and the team.</span>\n    </p></div>\n    <div>\n        <p><span>The Download Newsletter</span>\n            <span><span>Never miss a tech story.</span> Get the latest tech news, <span></span>reviews, <span></span>and advice from Jake and the team.</span>\n        </p>\n    </div>\n</div>\n    </div>\n            <div>\n                <p><span>\n                        Keep Scrolling for Next Article\n                    </span>\n                </p>\n            </div>\n        </div>\n    </div>"

these days. It’s <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/tech/disable-gmail-automatic-gemini-ai-summaries?test_uuid=015ZvAUxXams0rnBpajhMg2&test_variant=B\" target=\"_blank\">in your Gmail</a>, it’s <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/tech/why-gemini-is-replacing-google-assistant?test_uuid=015ZvAUxXams0rnBpajhMg2&test_variant=B\" target=\"_blank\">on your phone</a>, and soon, it’ll be in your browser. While Google’s AI browser integration was already live for Google AI Pro and AI Ultra subscribers, it's now <a href=\"https://blog.google/products/chrome/new-ai-features-for-chrome/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"open in a new window\">rolling out to everyone</a>—and getting a bunch of new features, too.</p><p>If you’re suddenly seeing a new Gemini button in the top right of your Chrome browser (in the same pane as your tabs), then you’ve already been hit with the update. If not, you may need to use the three-dots button in the top right corner and select <strong>Gemini in Chrome</strong> to turn it on, assuming you want to.</p><h2 id=\"how-to-use-gemini-in-chrome\">How to use Gemini in Chrome</h2><p>When you click the Gemini button, or summon it via a keyboard shortcut (Alt + G by default), you’ll be able to try out the same features Google’s paying customers have had access to for a while. That means Gemini will be able to answer questions about the webpage you’re on, or just answer general questions unrelated to what you’re browsing. Or, if you’re in a Google app or on a Google website, it’ll be able to take some simple actions for you, like jumping you to a specific spot in a YouTube video.</p><div>\n        <p><img src=\"https://lifehacker.com/images/short-lifehacker-logo.jpg\" alt=\"Lifehacker Logo\" /></p><div>\n            <p><span>You May Also Like</span></p>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n<p>Additionally, Gemini can also now work across your tabs and compare information between them. Simply start a dialogue with Gemini by tapping the button in the top right corner, and at the bottom of the window, click “Add tab” to give Gemini another source of data to consider.</p><p>Weirdly, while these updates are already pushing live to average folks, Google says businesses will need to wait a couple of weeks, so they can get “enterprise-grade data protections and controls.”</p><p>As of now, aside from the new access, it’s not the biggest update, especially because to try it, you need to be on Windows or Mac, have your language set to English, and be in the U.S.. Google stresses that the Gemini Assistant on Android can also help you browse Chrome, and that it’s working to bring more direct Gemini in Chrome access to both its Android and iOS apps.</p><h2 id=\"more-ai-browsing-is-coming\">More AI browsing is coming</h2><p>Google says it also has big things in store for the feature, with “agentic browsing” set for the “coming months.” This will supposedly let Gemini in Chrome complete tasks, like booking a haircut for you, or ordering your groceries. Alternatively, it’ll also help you browse a bit more easily, as Google says it’s working to let you ask Gemini questions about your browser history when you want to go back to a specific page. For instance, “what was the website where I saw the walnut desk last week?” could take you back to a shopping page you only vaguely remember.</p><div>\n            <p><span>\n                What do you think so far?\n            </span>\n        </p></div>\n<p>A more powerful address bar is apparently in the works that will let you ask questions of Google’s AI model without having to navigate to it first. For now, Gemini in Chrome will start suggesting questions to ask it about whatever page you’re on, right in the address bar.</p><p>The update includes a few security updates too, although they mostly seem to work in the backend, supposedly using AI to better block scammy ads and notifications. Now that’s the type of AI integration I can support wholeheartedly.</p><h2 id=\"how-to-turn-off-gemini-in-chrome\">How to turn off Gemini in Chrome</h2><p>All that said, if you’re a bit skeptical about Gemini in Chrome, you can turn it off. Simply navigate to <strong>Settings > AI Innovations</strong>, and you’ll be able to turn off the Gemini button, as well as disable its keyboard shortcut. You can also restrict its permissions: Set everything to off, and it’ll be like it was never installed in the first place.</p>\n            </article>\n    </div>\n<div>\n    <div>\n        <p><span>The Download Newsletter</span>\n            <span>Never miss a tech story</span>\n        </p>\n        <p><img src=\"https://lifehacker.com/images/team/Jake.png\" alt=\"Jake Peterson portrait\" />\n            <span>Jake Peterson\n            </span>\n            <span>Senior tech editor</span>\n        </p>\n        <p><span>Get the latest tech news, <span></span>reviews, <span></span>and advice from Jake and the team.</span>\n    </p></div>\n    <div>\n        <p><span>The Download Newsletter</span>\n            <span><span>Never miss a tech story.</span> Get the latest tech news, <span></span>reviews, <span></span>and advice from Jake and the team.</span>\n        </p>\n    </div>\n</div>\n    </div>\n            <div>\n                <p><span>\n                        Keep Scrolling for Next Article\n                    </span>\n                </p>\n            </div>\n        </div>\n    </div>"

may have heard of the Pomodoro technique before—<a href=\"https://www.lifehacker.com/productivity-101-a-primer-to-the-pomodoro-technique-1598992730\" target=\"_blank\">perhaps even here at Lifehacker</a>—and might already be aware it’s a solid productivity hack. But applied in another way, i can actually be more than that: This technique is also an excellent study tool that can help you maximize your focus and retention. It's time-tested, variable, and available to you whether you want to do it the old-fashioned way or call in the help of an app. </p><h2 id=\"what-is-the-pomodoro-technique\">What is the Pomodoro technique?</h2><p>Although it has a fancy name, the technique itself is simple: If you have a large task to complete, you should break it down into pieces and schedule breaks to reward yourself in between finishing bits of it. The scheduling is the key part: When following the classic Pomodoro model, you have to set an alarm for 25 minutes and 25 minutes only. So, work for 25 minutes, and when the alarm goes off, take a five-minute break, maybe to grab a snack, refill your coffee, or scroll social media. When the five minutes are up, get back to work. Do this over and over, but every four cycles, give yourself a bigger break, up to a half an hour.</p><div>\n        <p><img src=\"https://lifehacker.com/images/short-lifehacker-logo.jpg\" alt=\"Lifehacker Logo\" /></p><div>\n            <p><span>You May Also Like</span></p>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n<p>In the event something distracts you—whether it’s your phone or another person—you have to reset your timer, so try instead to be direct and tell them you’re busy and will be able to reconnect with them in a bit. Then, put them off until you get your five-minute break or even after your whole task is finished. </p><p>This works because you are aware you’re getting that little reset once your 25 minutes are up. You can throw yourself into the task knowing there’s a little treat coming down the pipeline. And while you rest up, your brain is processing everything you just learned. </p><h2 id=\"how-to-use-pomodoro-for-studying\">How to use Pomodoro for studying</h2><p>We usually discuss the Pomodoro technique in terms of working professionally, especially when there’s a big project you need to complete, but its origins actually come from the academic sphere. The method was invented by Fancesco Cirillo, a developer and entrepreneur, but he came up with it when he was a student. It’s actually named for the little tomato-shaped timer he used when he was studying. Those methods are certainly still viable, but the popularity of his technique has also birthed a cottage industry of specialty timers. On Amazon, <a href=\"https://zdcs.link/aADMrL?pageview_type=Standard&template=Explainers&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=you%20can%20get%20a%20Pomodoro-specific%20timer&short_url=aADMrL&u=https%3A%2F%2Flifehacker.com%2Fhow-to-use-the-pomodoro-method-for-studying&event_label=you%20can%20get%20a%20Pomodoro-specific%20timer\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"open in a new window\">you can get a Pomodoro-specific timer</a> for under $20. These offer different preset time allotments, so you don't have to stick to the 25 on, five off model—but I'll get to that in a moment.</p><p>You can use this method to study for a test by breaking up the content you need to review. You go by chapter, by content, or by “chunk,” if you’re <a href=\"https://www.lifehacker.com/use-the-chunking-method-to-actually-remember-what-you-1850392462\" target=\"_blank\">using the chunking method</a> to divvy up your study load (which you should be). It’s a good way to stay on task if you get easily distracted and dividing your topics up will help you remember them better. It’s not ideal for quick cramming sessions, however, since you need at least two hours to get four “Pomodoros” in. Do this on a day you have plenty of time to devote to studying—and, of course, relaxing.</p><h2 id=\"pomodoro-variations-that-work-for-studying\">Pomodoro variations that work for studying</h2><p>As noted, the classic Pomodoro technique involves 25 minutes on and five minutes off, but you needn't be so rigid—there's a reason those Pomodoro timers don't lock you to those intervals. Twenty-five minute increments worked for Cirillo and countless adherents after him, but they may not work for you. I do recommend starting with the classic technique, but if you're not finding yourself falling into <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/use-deep-work-to-be-more-productive-1850632295\" target=\"_blank\">a state of deep work</a> during those blocks of time, you have to switch things up. </p><p>There's a lot of flexibility to the method, so feel free to experiment. For instance, one student invented \"<a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/work/how-to-use-animedoro-productivity-method\" target=\"_blank\">Animedoro</a>\" a few years ago. This approach involves working for longer intervals, around 40 to 60 minutes, then getting 20 minutes to relax and do something you enjoy—like watching an episode of anime, which tend to be about 20 minutes long. With longer working time, you have a better chance of getting into deep work and focusing, plus not getting discombobulated when your timer suddenly goes off. </p><div>\n            <p><span>\n                What do you think so far?\n            </span>\n        </p></div>\n<p>Another approach is called <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/work/try-pomodoro-20-to-focus-on-deep-work\" target=\"_blank\">Pomodoro 2.0</a> and it involves adding 15 minutes to your work period every time you return to your task, so you focus longer and longer as you go. You still need to take breaks, of course, and you can even make those incrementally longer too. </p><p>Or maybe you prefer to work in quick bursts. You can try variations where you study for just 10 minutes before a short break, giving yourself a sense of urgency as you try to see how many flashcards you can study in that time. The point is it's up to you: A period of work interspersed with breaks is the only core element of the method, and you can approach it in whatever way you find most useful. Just keep in mind that you'll get better results if you commit to a set structure, even if it takes some time to adjust to it.</p><h2 id=\"pomodoro-apps-can-help\">Pomodoro apps can help</h2><p>I'm a fan of those Pomodoro timers because they keep me off my phone, which is a major distraction—it's a slippery slope from setting an alarm to checking a notification and then finding myself in a Reels hole 10 minutes of my allotted study time. </p><p>Then again, the phone can be useful if you're using it productively. Many focus timer apps can be used with the Pomodoro method, and will even block other apps during the work-time increments you set, or otherwise penalize you for getting distracted when you should be focusing. (If you need suggestions, <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/tech/best-focus-timer-apps\" target=\"_blank\">I've previously written about a few of my favorites</a>.)</p><p>There are also Pomodoro-specific apps—including <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/tech/focuspomo-app-review\" target=\"_blank\">my top pick, FocusPomo</a>—that exist purely to help you structure your study or productivity time around the famous technique. If using your phone alarm seems risky and buying a tabletop timer off Amazon feels antiquated, look into one of these. </p>\n            </article>\n    </div>\n<div>\n    <div>\n        <p><span>The Daily Newsletter</span>\n            <span>Ready to do everything better?</span>\n        </p>\n        <p><img src=\"https://lifehacker.com/images/team/Jordan.png\" alt=\"Jordan Calhoun portrait\" />\n            <span>Jordan Calhoun\n            </span>\n            <span>Editor in chief</span>\n        </p>\n        <p><span><span>Get daily tips, tricks, <span>and tech guides</span></span> <span>from Jordan and the team.</span></span>\n    </p></div>\n    <div>\n        <p><span>The Daily Newsletter</span>\n            <span><span>Ready to do everything better?</span> <span>Get daily tips, tricks, <span>and tech guides</span></span> <span>from Jordan and the team.</span></span>\n        </p>\n    </div>\n</div>\n    </div>\n            <div>\n                <p><span>\n                        Keep Scrolling for Next Article\n                    </span>\n                </p>\n            </div>\n        </div>\n    </div>"
