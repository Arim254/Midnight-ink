When you first open the app, you'll see the options to either create a new document or scan one with your iPhone's camera. </p><p>Most of the time, however, you probably you have an existing document you want to open using Preview. If so, you'll find those options in the bottom half of this starting page. This is Preview's integration with the Files app: You can browse your documents from Files and open any with Preview.</p><div>\n        <p><img src=\"https://lifehacker.com/images/short-lifehacker-logo.jpg\" alt=\"Lifehacker Logo\" /></p><div>\n            <p><span>You May Also Like</span></p>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n<p>Once you have a document loaded up, you're able to view, annotate, markup, and edit it. If you need to fill out a document with your information, you can use AutoFill to automatically enter contact info and other saved details. You can add your signature, and if you're on your iPad, you can use your Apple Pencil to draw on the document. Otherwise, you can use your finger to mark up the file. </p><p>You can also export documents from the Preview app. You can work with file types including HEIDC, JPEG, PDF, PNG, and TIFF. And as with Preview on macOS, there are a number of controls when exporting, such as resolution, embedding text, and saving images as JPEG.</p><p>While there's a lot you can do here, the biggest strength I see for this mobile Preview app is using it as a tool for legal documents. If you need to sign an important document, you can quickly scan it into the app, add your signature, fill out any information—perhaps automatically with AutoFill—then email the doc out, all without needing to jump to your computer.</p><h2 id=\"preview-on-ios-is-still-a-work-in-progress\">Preview on iOS is still a work in progress</h2><p>If you look at <a href=\"https://apps.apple.com/us/app/preview/id536344167?platform=iphone\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"open in a new window\">Preview's App Store page</a>, you'll notice some mixed reviews. After using the app for a bit, I understand why. Preview for iOS is definitely still a work in progress and in need of some key upgrades.</p><div>\n            <p><span>\n                What do you think so far?\n            </span>\n        </p></div>\n<p>The biggest quirks I noticed immediately: The main menu page is cluttered, with the Files integration looking more like a glitch than a dedicated window. Speaking of Files, Apple made the decision to have documents in Files open in Preview. At first, that sounds like a good idea, until you experience it in person on both iOS and iPadOS. Being dragged out of the Files app when you're not expecting it is jarring, especially when you're used to viewing your docs directly in the app. </p><p>The workaround here is to avoid Files for opening, well, files. Use the Files integration within Preview, so you stay in the same app. How intuitive. You could also choose to delete the Preview app, but that's a bit of a shame when it's such a major update for iOS and iPadOS 26.</p><p>Also, when you choose the Markup option, there's no clear way to exit without closing the whole app first. As far as I can tell, the only way to do so is to tap the three-dots in the top right, then tap Markup to exit this menu. The Markup button should really stay on screen as it does on macOS, so it's obvious how to dismiss it.    </p>\n            </article>\n    </div>\n<div>\n    <div>\n        <p><span>The Download Newsletter</span>\n            <span>Never miss a tech story</span>\n        </p>\n        <p><img src=\"https://lifehacker.com/images/team/Jake.png\" alt=\"Jake Peterson portrait\" />\n            <span>Jake Peterson\n            </span>\n            <span>Senior tech editor</span>\n        </p>\n        <p><span>Get the latest tech news, <span></span>reviews, <span></span>and advice from Jake and the team.</span>\n    </p></div>\n    <div>\n        <p><span>The Download Newsletter</span>\n            <span><span>Never miss a tech story.</span> Get the latest tech news, <span></span>reviews, <span></span>and advice from Jake and the team.</span>\n        </p>\n    </div>\n</div>\n    </div>\n            <div>\n                <p><span>\n                        Keep Scrolling for Next Article\n                    </span>\n                </p>\n            </div>\n        </div>\n    </div>"

source</a></em><em>.</em></p><hr /><p>On Tuesday, Apple dropped <a href=\"https://www.cnet.com/tech/services-and-software/apple-releases-first-ios-26-1-beta-with-some-subtle-iphone-changes/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"open in a new window\">the first beta for iOS 26.1</a>. With it, we can see what the company is planning for <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/tech/settings-to-change-after-installing-ios-26\" target=\"_blank\">the successor to iOS 26</a>, including new gestures in Apple Music, a new scrubbing bar for the video player, and Liquid Glass support for the keypad in the Phone app. It's a small update on the surface, but there's something quite interesting going on behind the scenes. </p><h2 id=\"notification-forwarding\">'Notification Forwarding'</h2><p><a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2917201/ios-26-1-beta-suggests-the-iphone-will-soon-support-third-party-smartwatches.html\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"open in a new window\">As discovered by Macworld</a>, code within the iOS 26.1 beta suggests that Apple is working on support for third-party smartwatches in future versions of iOS. Macworld found references to a new feature called \"Notification Forwarding,\" which supposedly would allows users to direct alerts from their iPhone to a device not made by Apple. It's a bit vague, as that could mean anything from a tablet to a PC, but Macworld believes it is intended to support notification forwarding to non-Apple smartwatches.</p><div>\n        <p><img src=\"https://lifehacker.com/images/short-lifehacker-logo.jpg\" alt=\"Lifehacker Logo\" /></p><div>\n            <p><span>You May Also Like</span></p>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n<p>The code also seems to indicate that this feature supports notification forwarding to one device at a time. If you were to set your notifications from your iPhone to a Galaxy Watch, for example, it might disable notifications to your Apple Watch. In addition, there are references to an unfinished feature called \"AccessoryExtension,\" which might support pairing third-party watches to your iPhone. </p><p>Notification Forwarding and AccessoryExtension could be indicative of a big change for Apple. One of the things that makes the company so successful is its \"ecosystem,\" the idea that Apple's products are designed to work seamlessly together. If you have an iPhone, it connects to and works with iPads, Macs, and, of course, Apple Watches. When you try to connect to and work with third-party devices, however, you run into road blocks. </p><p>Smartwatches might be among the biggest hurdles here. Apple's smartwatch, of course, does everything you'd expect a smartwatch to do with your smartphone. But if you're thinking of picking up a Pixel Watch or Galaxy Watch, it's a different story. In fact, there's really no way to pair one of these to your iPhone. If you're coming from Android and you try to use your Pixel Watch with your iPhone, you're going to have a bad time. \"Notification Forwarding\" could offer a bridge.</p><div>\n            <p><span>\n                What do you think so far?\n            </span>\n        </p></div>\n<p>Some smartwatches, like those from Garmin, do offer notification forwarding support already, so the feature wouldn't necessarily be groundbreaking. But it could expand smartwatch options for users beyond the limited devices that currently work with iOS' notifications. </p><h2 id=\"two-reasons-you-might-not-see-these-changes-on-your-iphone\">Two reasons you might not see these changes on your iPhone</h2><p>Before you get too excited, there are a couple of caveats here. First, these changes are not an active part of iOS 26.1; rather, they are simply references within the code. That indicates this is something Apple is working on, but not necessarily something that will definitely launch. Until we see the features appear in a future beta update, it's possible this will simply remain an experiment. </p><p>And even if Apple does roll out these changes, it might only be to a select group of users. There's a chance third-party smartwatch support is solely targeted towards the EU, following the union's <a href=\"https://mashable.com/article/apple-dma-eu-connectivity-interoperability-proceedings\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"open in a new window\">Digital Markets Act</a>. That legislation requires Apple to open up iOS to third-party devices, which, notably, includes smartwatches. Apple doesn't tend to open up when it doesn't have to, which is why the EU has third-party app stores on iOS and the rest of the world does not. We could see yet another EU-specific feature in this case: Europeans might be able to use their Android watches with iOS, while the rest of us are stuck with Apple Watches. </p>\n            </article>\n    </div>\n<div>\n    <div>\n        <p><span>The Download Newsletter</span>\n            <span>Never miss a tech story</span>\n        </p>\n        <p><img src=\"https://lifehacker.com/images/team/Jake.png\" alt=\"Jake Peterson portrait\" />\n            <span>Jake Peterson\n            </span>\n            <span>Senior tech editor</span>\n        </p>\n        <p><span>Get the latest tech news, <span></span>reviews, <span></span>and advice from Jake and the team.</span>\n    </p></div>\n    <div>\n        <p><span>The Download Newsletter</span>\n            <span><span>Never miss a tech story.</span> Get the latest tech news, <span></span>reviews, <span></span>and advice from Jake and the team.</span>\n        </p>\n    </div>\n</div>\n    </div>\n            <div>\n                <p><span>\n                        Keep Scrolling for Next Article\n                    </span>\n                </p>\n            </div>\n        </div>\n    </div>"

As such, in order to interpret menus, signs, and packaging, I needed to translate the text back into English. While you might assume you need to use a specific translator app of choice to get this done, you really only need one thing: your iPhone's camera.</p><p>I, along with all of the people I traveled with, have an iPhone, so I assumed all of us knew about this trick. To my surprise, however, nobody in my party knew about this. So, I'm here to make sure your next international trip is a bit easier. </p><div>\n        <p><img src=\"https://lifehacker.com/images/short-lifehacker-logo.jpg\" alt=\"Lifehacker Logo\" /></p><div>\n            <p><span>You May Also Like</span></p>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n<h2 id=\"translate-text-with-your-iphones-camera\">Translate text with your iPhone's camera </h2><p>The next time you need to translate some text in front of you, instead of heading for Google Translate, Microsoft Translator, or even Apple's own Translate app, just open your Camera app. Frame up the text in the middle of the viewfinder and give your iPhone a moment to \"think.\" If all goes well, you should see a yellow frame appear around the text, and a new button appear in the bottom right of the viewfinder—or top right, if you're holding your iPhone in landscape. </p><p>Tap this button, and iOS will cut out the selected text, and zoom in to bring it into focus. Now, tap the \"Translate\" button that appears in the bottom left (or top left in landscape), wait a moment, and presto: The text is replaced by your target language. As you might guess, for me, that's English, but the feature will translate into whichever system language your iPhone is currently set to.</p><div>\n    <p><img src=\"https://lifehacker.com/imagery/articles/01K60TCH66X4WWW8DBDV6P4GMC/images-1.fill.size_2000x1125.v1758820823.png\" alt=\"translating within the camera app\" srcset=\"https://lifehacker.com/imagery/articles/01K60TCH66X4WWW8DBDV6P4GMC/images-1.fill.size_800x450.v1758820823.png 800w, https://lifehacker.com/imagery/articles/01K60TCH66X4WWW8DBDV6P4GMC/images-1.fill.size_1400x788.v1758820823.png 1400w, https://lifehacker.com/imagery/articles/01K60TCH66X4WWW8DBDV6P4GMC/images-1.fill.size_2000x1125.v1758820823.png 2000w\" />\n            </p>\n            <p><span></span>\n                                        <span>Credit: Lifehacker</span>\n                    </p>\n    </div>\n<p>For many applications, this translation is enough. But there's more you can do with this. If you need to share that translated text somewhere, you can tap the translation to pull up a Translate mini window. Here, you can copy the translation so you can paste it wherever you'd like. You'll also be able to have iOS read either the translation or original text out loud, add the translation to your favorites, or open the translation in the Translate app. </p><p>This hidden perk is part of the iPhone's larger <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/how-to-use-live-text-the-best-new-feature-in-ios-15-1847649795\" target=\"_blank\">Live Text feature</a>, which uses OCR (optical character recognition) to identify text in images. Live Text allows you to select text both in images and within the camera's viewfinder for easy copy and pasting. And, since iOS 16, it allows you to translate that text directly within the camera as well. Since it's powered by the Translate app, it supports the languages the app does, which includes:</p><div>\n            <p><span>\n                What do you think so far?\n            </span>\n        </p></div>\n<ul><li><p>Arabic</p></li><li><p>Chinese (Mandarin, Simplified)</p></li><li><p>Chinese (Mandarin, Traditional)</p></li><li><p>Dutch</p></li><li><p>English (UK)</p></li><li><p>French</p></li><li><p>German</p></li><li><p>Hindi</p></li><li><p>Indonesian</p></li><li><p>Italian</p></li><li><p>Japanese</p></li><li><p>Korean</p></li><li><p>Polish</p></li><li><p>Portuguese (Brazil)</p></li><li><p>Russian</p></li><li><p>Spanish (Spain)</p></li><li><p>Thai</p></li><li><p>Turkish</p></li><li><p>Ukrainian</p></li><li><p>Vietnamese </p></li></ul><p>If this feature isn't working for you, it's likely not turned on.

As previously mentioned, iOS comes with a built-in Translate app, which has its own Camera function as well. But with iOS 26, there's a new translation feature that works seamlessly as you use your iPhone: <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/tech/apple-live-translation-messages-facetime-and-your-phone-calls-wwdc-2025\" target=\"_blank\">Live Translate</a>. </p><p>As the name suggests, Live Translate can translate conversations in real time. This works in Messages with text, but also during FaceTime and phone calls when talking to someone in another language. If you have a compatible pair of AirPods, <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/tech/you-dont-need-to-buy-airpods-pro-3-to-use-live-translation\" target=\"_blank\">you can even use this feature when talking to someone in person</a>: You'll hear their words translated in your ears, and they'll see your words translated on your iPhone's display.</p>\n            </article>\n    </div>\n<div>\n    <div>\n        <p><span>The Download Newsletter</span>\n            <span>Never miss a tech story</span>\n        </p>\n        <p><img src=\"https://lifehacker.com/images/team/Jake.png\" alt=\"Jake Peterson portrait\" />\n            <span>Jake Peterson\n            </span>\n            <span>Senior tech editor</span>\n        </p>\n        <p><span>Get the latest tech news, <span></span>reviews, <span></span>and advice from Jake and the team.</span>\n    </p></div>\n    <div>\n        <p><span>The Download Newsletter</span>\n            <span><span>Never miss a tech story.</span> Get the latest tech news, <span></span>reviews, <span></span>and advice from Jake and the team.</span>\n        </p>\n    </div>\n</div>\n    </div>\n            <div>\n                <p><span>\n                        Keep Scrolling for Next Article\n                    </span>\n                </p>\n            </div>\n        </div>\n    </div>"

/><p><a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/family/finals-study-methods\" target=\"_blank\">Study methods</a> are usually all about what you can do in your own time to maximize what you learn and that's generally most important, but bringing someone else in to your process can be helpful if done correctly, too. That’s what Richard Feynman, a theoretical physicist, thought—at least in theory. According to many possibly apocryphal sources, the Nobel Prize-winner once said, “If you cannot explain something in simple terms, you don’t understand it. The best way to learn is to teach.” </p><p>It’s entirely possible Feynman never said that at all. <a href=\"https://improbable.com/2022/03/23/explaining-why-spin-1-2-particles-obey-fermi-dirac-statistics/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"open in a new window\">The closest documented quote I could find</a>, courtesy of his colleague and fellow physicist David Goodstein, stated that Feynman’s inability to break a subject (in this case, a complex question of particle physics) down to the level a freshman student could understand it meant that <em>science</em> didn’t effectively understand it. </p><div>\n        <p><img src=\"https://lifehacker.com/images/short-lifehacker-logo.jpg\" alt=\"Lifehacker Logo\" /></p><div>\n            <p><span>You May Also Like</span></p>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n<p>But whether this study method truly came from Feynman or not, the basic principle—to know you truly understand a subject, you should be able to teach it to someone else—is pretty sound. Here’s how the Feynman study method works and how you can use it to master new concepts (just maybe not particle physics, apparently).</p><h2 id=\"what-is-the-feynman-method\">What is the Feynman method?</h2><p>The Feynman study technique is so popular for learning and retaining information that it’s <a href=\"https://www.colorado.edu/artssciences-advising/resource-library/life-skills/the-feynman-technique-in-academic-coaching\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"open in a new window\">recommended to college students</a> and even r<a href=\"https://todoist.com/inspiration/feynman-technique\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"open in a new window\">eal-world professionals</a>. It’s a four-step technique that should, when practiced correctly, help you fully grasp the content you’re studying. Here are the steps involved:</p><ol><li><p>Identify exactly what material you need to learn (to do that, try using a method like <a href=\"https://www.lifehacker.com/use-the-kwl-study-method-to-learn-more-1850786565\" target=\"_blank\">KWL</a> or <a href=\"https://www.lifehacker.com/use-the-sq3r-method-to-study-more-effectively-1850780175\" target=\"_blank\">SQ3R</a> to determine  which parts of the topic are most critical before you even get started), and then study it on your own using the methods that have proven most effective for you. I recommend the <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/leitner-system-flashcard-studying\" target=\"_blank\">Leitner flashcard method</a> for vocabulary words and simple question-and-answer problems. Then, try <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/two-ways-to-use-the-blurting-method-to-study-1850999140\" target=\"_blank\">blurting</a>, where you write down everything you can remember about the topic before checking it against your materials to see what you missed. </p></li><li><p>Once you feel comfortable with the material, teach it to someone else—ideally someone who has never studied it. Explain the material as though you were doing so to a total neophyte (Feynman advises to imagine talking to a child), as thoroughly and as straightforwardly as possible. </p></li><li><p>Return to your source material whenever you come across an element you have difficulty explaining in detail.</p></li><li><p>Rewrite and streamline your notes, breaking down complex topics into simpler parts, and further clarifying the topic until you reach a level of granularity that seems almost <em>too</em> basic.</p></li></ol><p>Step 2 isn't as simple as it seems, though. You need a pretty willing participant for this and they should ask questions while you teach them. Questions are crucial because the other person may come up with ones you didn't think of while studying the material and a back-and-forth dialogue can help you make connections between concepts in your brain. Don't treat this as though you're standing in front of them giving a lecture. Rather, turn it more into a real conversation where you're presenting the material, but they're also participating. If they ask something you can't answer, head to Step 3, look it up, and then go back to them with the details. </p><h2 id=\"how-the-feynman-method-works\">How the Feynman method works</h2><p>The most important element of this technique is in dissecting and simplifying the material until you feel like you could explain it all to a child. As the story from Goodstein above reveals, Feynman believed if you couldn’t reduce a topic to information comprehensible to a young student, <em>you</em> didn’t really<em> </em>understand it. (A similar quote has also been attributed to Albert Einstein, so consider it a pedagogical philosophy with legs—though <a href=\"https://www.famousscientists.org/einstein-did-not-say-that/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"open in a new window\">there’s no proof Einstein actually said anything of the sort,</a> either.)</p><div>\n            <p><span>\n                What do you think so far?\n            </span>\n        </p></div>\n<p>It works fine if you choose an adult who is unfamiliar with the topic to teach it to. The idea is just for you to simplify it to a child's level of understanding, but you'll probably get more substantive feedback if you actually do the discussion with an adult. Maybe they’ll ask a question you can’t answer, or help you find connections between ideas. Maybe their unique perspectives and experiences will inform their understanding of this new material and launch some groundbreaking revelations for you. Who's to say? This feedback will help you as you move to the third step of reviewing your materials, as it will give you additional things to consider as you do so. </p><p>When you’re done refining your notes further, try teaching the topic to someone else again, or moving on to another technique, <a href=\"https://www.lifehacker.com/use-distributed-practice-to-better-retain-what-you-st-1850808691\" target=\"_blank\">like distributed practice</a> or <a href=\"https://www.lifehacker.com/overlearning-can-force-important-information-into-your-1850797539\" target=\"_blank\">overlearning</a>, where you’ll study your simplified notes periodically until you fully grasp the material.</p><h2 id=\"feynman-when-no-one-else-is-around\">Feynman when no one else is around</h2><p>It's a nice idea to imagine you could call up your mom or best friend to Feynman it out every time you have a big test coming, but realistically, that's probably not possible. If you can't find anyone with whom to practice this technique, turn to AI. Language models like <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/the-best-ways-to-study-but-not-cheat-using-ai-tools\" target=\"_blank\">ChatGPT are great study helpers</a> when used correctly. </p><p>Instruct the chatbot to act like it's totally unfamiliar with the subject, then type everything you can remember about it into the text-entry box, as though you were using the blurting method. Ask if the AI has any questions and go from there. I've done this and actually just told the bot I was using the Feynman method, which it understood, and it worked just as well as talking to a human being, although it felt a little weirder. Fire up ChatGPT before a big test in case of emergency.</p>\n            </article>\n    </div>\n<div>\n    <div>\n        <p><span>The Daily Newsletter</span>\n            <span>Ready to do everything better?</span>\n        </p>\n        <p><img src=\"https://lifehacker.com/images/team/Jordan.png\" alt=\"Jordan Calhoun portrait\" />\n            <span>Jordan Calhoun\n            </span>\n            <span>Editor in chief</span>\n        </p>\n        <p><span><span>Get daily tips, tricks, <span>and tech guides</span></span> <span>from Jordan and the team.</span></span>\n    </p></div>\n    <div>\n        <p><span>The Daily Newsletter</span>\n            <span><span>Ready to do everything better?</span> <span>Get daily tips, tricks, <span>and tech guides</span></span> <span>from Jordan and the team.</span></span>\n        </p>\n    </div>\n</div>\n    </div>\n            <div>\n                <p><span>\n                        Keep Scrolling for Next Article\n                    </span>\n                </p>\n            </div>\n        </div>\n    </div>"

But there’s good reason to believe taking notes by hand helps your brain retain more. Here’s why you should try leaving the laptop behind at home and how to make the switch to the old-school way easier.</p><h2 id=\"digital-note-taking-isnt-perfect\">Digital note-taking isn’t perfect</h2><p>There’s been plenty of research that has suggested hand-taken notes are superior to those you take on a computer, even though typing is so much faster and you can get more information on the page. Actually, that’s part of the problem: When taking notes by hand, you have to be choosy about what is important enough to write down. You have to use critical thinking, make outlines, and listen closely to determine what parts of the lecture are valuable enough to take the time to jot down. When you’re typing, you can just transcribe the whole lecture in real time if you want—and you might go on autopilot to do so without engaging your brain deeply in the material. </p>\n<p>I made this mistake in grad school: I'd type everything the professor said, so focused on getting every word that I didn't actually <em>hear</em> the lesson. Worse, I ended up what amounted to transcripts—and the majority of what the professors would say during three-hour classes wasn't relevant to my concrete learning goals. I'd end up feeding my messy \"notes\" <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/the-best-ways-to-study-but-not-cheat-using-ai-tools\" target=\"_blank\">into AI tools</a> and asking for summaries. I could have just listened more thoughtfully and intentionally the first time around.</p><p>Recent research backing up note-taking as the reigning champ was <a href=\"https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/0098628320979895\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"open in a new window\">published in <em>Teaching of Psychology</em></a> in 2022. Researchers put participants in four categories: those who took notes by hand and took a test on the computer, those who took notes on the computer and took a test by hand, those who took notes and did a test on the computer, and those who did it all by hand. Overall, regardless of how they ultimately took the test, the students who took notes by hand performed better on the quiz overall—and better on conceptual questions. </p><h2 id=\"your-computer-is-distracting\">Your computer is distracting</h2><p>It’s convenient to be able to look up concepts, jot down notes, and maintain tabs of supplemental materials throughout class, but it’s just as convenient to toggle over to a new window and scroll social media or send work emails. Being distracted in class is not helpful for your retention and performance, regardless of whether the tool at hand <em>could </em>help you if you were using it to.</p><p>A <a href=\"https://ojs.lib.uwo.ca/index.php/cjsotl_rcacea/article/view/8002\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"open in a new window\">2012 survey</a> published in the <em>Canadian Journal for the Scholarship of Teaching</em> and Learning showed that of 478 students and 36 instructors surveyed at one university, almost half found the use of technology in class for noneducational purposes distracting. There have been a <em>bunch</em> of other studies showing that use of phones or laptops for noneducational purposes during class has a negative effect on academic performance. It's why we're seeing so many jurisdictions around the country push for<a href=\"https://mashable.com/article/school-phone-ban-survey\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"open in a new window\"> phone-free school zones for kids</a>. The journal articles on these results have pretty straightforward titles like “<a href=\"https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/01443410.2018.1489046?journalCode=cedp20\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"open in a new window\">Dividing Attention in the Classroom Reduces Exam Performance</a>” and make it clear that doing anything but taking notes or following along with class materials on the computer is only impacting your ability to obtain and retain valuable information. </p><p>And since taking notes on the computer isn’t all that great to begin with, you might as well not bring the device at all. </p><div>\n            <p><span>\n                What do you think so far?\n            </span>\n        </p></div>\n<h2 id=\"plan-your-note-taking\">Plan your note-taking </h2><p>If you've been typing your notes out for years, it will be a major adjustment to go back to the old notebook and pencil. How is your handwriting looking these days? Do you even know? Time to reacquaint yourself, but in the process, you'll need a strategy as you embark on this plan.</p><p>There is actually <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/best-note-taking-methods-1849535943\" target=\"_blank\">quite a variety of note-taking methods; </a>the best one for you will depend on what type of content you're studying and what kind of learner you are. I linked my guide to all the approaches above. You might find outlining, the Cornell technique, or \"mapping\" or \"charting\" to work best, but you'll have to play around with them a while to figure it out. </p><p>By the way, just because you take the notes by hand doesn't mean they have to stay hand-written. You can <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/best-ways-digitize-notes-1850896868\" target=\"_blank\">digitize your notes</a> using an app or even invest in a smart notebook that will do it for you as you write. I've used <a href=\"https://zdcs.link/z7Mn0V?pageview_type=Standard&template=Explainers&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=a%20Rocketbook%20smart%20notebook&short_url=z7Mn0V&u=https%3A%2F%2Flifehacker.com%2Fdont-use-laptop-to-take-notes-in-class&event_label=a%20Rocketbook%20smart%20notebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"open in a new window\">a Rocketbook smart notebook</a> in the past and found it intuitive and a nice way to straddle the analog and digital worlds. </p><p>Finally, make sure you <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/revise-your-notes-before-you-leave-class-1850774684\" target=\"_blank\">revise your notes before you leave class</a>, whenever possible. Going through them while the lecture is still fresh in your mind is crucial. You can either start digitizing them then, maybe by <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/tech/xmind-mind-mapping-app-review\" target=\"_blank\">using an app to make a mind map</a>, or just rewrite them on a different notebook page. </p>\n            </article>"

href=\"https://lifehacker.com/health/seven-changes-that-helped-me-stick-to-my-home-fitness-routine\" target=\"_blank\">ever-expanding quest to get better at working out</a> at home. I wanted to put it into action right away, so naturally, I turned to my <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/health/peloton-app-review\" target=\"_blank\">beloved Peloton app</a>, where I figured I'd load up a Pilates workout and get to work. Weirdly, though, that wasn't as easy as it is when I, say, want to follow along with a <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/health/pelotons-yoga-offerings-are-surprisingly-robust\" target=\"_blank\">yoga</a> or <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/health/peloton-stretching-classes-are-helping-me-do-the-splits\" target=\"_blank\">stretching</a> class. Eventually, I figured it out and the Pilates workout (which did incorporate my hoop, thank you very much) was great—and challenging, which is how I like it.</p><h2 id=\"where-to-locate-pilates-classes-on-the-peloton-app\">Where to locate Pilates classes on the Peloton app</h2><p>I knew Peloton had Pilates classes. But when I opened up the app, there was no designated Pilates button the way there are buttons for <strong>Meditation</strong> and <strong>Cycling</strong>. I typed \"Pilates\" into the search bar at the top of the mobile app and it brought up 95 class results, some of which were actually categorized as yoga and others which were listed under strength. </p><div>\n        <p><img src=\"https://lifehacker.com/images/short-lifehacker-logo.jpg\" alt=\"Lifehacker Logo\" /></p><div>\n            <p><span>You May Also Like</span></p>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n<p>So, there <em>are</em> Pilates classes, but they're listed on different landing pages. Across the top of the search results page, you see <strong>Classes</strong>, <strong>Collections</strong>, <strong>Programs</strong>, and <strong>Music Artists</strong>. Tapping <strong>Collections</strong> yields a landing page called \"Pilates with Equipment,\" which has subcategories: Pilates with a Ball, Pilates with Sliders, Pilates with a Band, and—crucially, for me—Pilates with a Ring. There are only a handful of classes in each and they're all technically filed as \"strength classes\" in Peloton's system. I selected \"15 min Pilates\" from the section that incorporates the magic circle. </p><p>Things got harder from there. I wanted to play the class on my TV, which is possible because Peloton has an app on the Roku, but there is no search function on the Roku app. Instead, you have to look through the categories to find a class—which I couldn't do, since there is no Pilates category. I ended up getting the one I wanted by adding it to <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/health/how-to-stack-peloton-classes\" target=\"_blank\">my Peloton Stack</a>, which is like a personal class playlist; deleting everything else from the Stack; and running the Stack on the Roku app. It wasn't efficient or ideal, but ultimately, it worked. </p><div>\n            <p><span>\n                What do you think so far?\n            </span>\n        </p></div>\n<h2 id=\"what-pelotons-pilates-classes-are-like\">What Peloton's Pilates classes are like </h2><p>As much trouble as I had actually finding a class, I hadn't even technically done the \"hard\" part yet. Pilates is supposed to be challenging, after all, and the intermediate-level class I took definitely was. Armed with my mat and my hoop I followed along with some standard moves, like \"hundreds\" and clam shells. It was difficult, but not impossible, which is exactly what I was looking for. </p><p>Again, there are only 95 of these types of classes available and some are more about stretching while others are more strength-focused. That's a small selection compared to how many other types of classes Peloton offers. But what <em>is</em> available is solid. The instruction is clear and precise, modifications are offered, and the audio/video quality is top-tier, making it easy to hear and see what you're supposed to be doing. </p><p>I did the Peloton class last night and took an in-studio reformer class this morning. Granted, my in-person class was four times longer than the one I did from Peloton, but I'd say that adjusted for time, they were both equal in challenge. Because I am now the proud owner of a hoop <em>and </em>the knowledge of how to find high-quality, expert-led Pilates classes to play through Peloton, I'll certainly be doing more of these. Here's hoping we get a dedicated Pilates page on the Peloton app soon.</p>\n            </article>\n    </div>\n<div>\n    <div>\n        <p><span>The Daily Newsletter</span>\n            <span>Ready to do everything better?</span>\n        </p>\n        <p><img src=\"https://lifehacker.com/images/team/Jordan.png\" alt=\"Jordan Calhoun portrait\" />\n            <span>Jordan Calhoun\n            </span>\n            <span>Editor in chief</span>\n        </p>\n        <p><span><span>Get daily tips, tricks, <span>and tech guides</span></span> <span>from Jordan and the team.</span></span>\n    </p></div>\n    <div>\n        <p><span>The Daily Newsletter</span>\n            <span><span>Ready to do everything better?</span> <span>Get daily tips, tricks, <span>and tech guides</span></span> <span>from Jordan and the team.</span></span>\n        </p>\n    </div>\n</div>\n    </div>\n            <div>\n                <p><span>\n                        Keep Scrolling for Next Article\n                    </span>\n                </p>\n            </div>\n        </div>\n    </div>"
