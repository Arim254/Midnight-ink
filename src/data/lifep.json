/><p>Before you sit down to study or get started on a big project for work, you might want to consider hitting the gym or taking a brisk walk. Besides just generally being good for your health, research also shows it can actually help with cognition. And with, say, the start of a new semester bearing down upon you or a work deadline looming, anything that can give you a brain boost is likely welcome. </p><h2 id=\"what-the-research-says-about-exercise-and-studying\">What the research says about exercise and studying</h2><p>There’s no shortage of solid, peer-reviewed research on the effect of exercise on cognition, going back <a href=\"https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Phillip-Tomporowski/publication/10893216_Effects_of_acute_bouts_of_exercise_on_cognition/links/5d9b7b95a6fdccfd0e81034e/Effects-of-acute-bouts-of-exercise-on-cognition.pdf?_sg%5B0%5D=started_experiment_milestone&origin=journalDetail&_rtd=e30%3D\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"open in a new window\">decades</a>. There's just a shortage on explanations. The exact reasons that exercise helps thinking aren’t fully understood, but <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5934999/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"open in a new window\">one 2018 review in <em>Frontiers in Psychology</em></a> discusses evidence that it may increase blood flow to the brain, boost levels of certain neurotransmitters, and increase your feelings of control and self-esteem. Purely anecdotally, I think that's true. When I leave the gym in the morning, I feel like I've already accomplished something and tend to be a little more of a go-getter at work, riding my smug little wave to continue the day's productive streak. </p><div>\n        <p><img src=\"https://lifehacker.com/images/short-lifehacker-logo.jpg\" alt=\"Lifehacker Logo\" /></p><div>\n            <p><span>You May Also Like</span></p>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3951958/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"open in a new window\">Another review</a>, from 2013, notes that “more active” individuals are better able to pay attention to their surroundings and process information more quickly. Exercise may even change our brains for the long term; the 2018 review concluded that “chronic aerobic exercise is associated with potent structural and functional neuroplastic changes, with an improvement in cognitive functions.”</p><h2 id=\"what-exercises-work-best-for-your-brain\">What exercises work best for your brain?</h2><p>The research is pro-exercise in all forms, but especially hones in on acute aerobic exercise—or the kind of exercise where you’re moving around a lot and your heart rate is up. A “single bout” of this kind of movement is related to improved cognitive functions, according to the researchers in <em>Frontiers</em>.</p><div>\n            <p><span>\n                What do you think so far?\n            </span>\n        </p></div>\n<p>So, before you sit down to study, plan your week, or have an important conversation with your boss, consider swimming, biking, jogging, running, hopping on the elliptical, or taking a brisk walk around the block. You want to get in some solid cardio here, even if it is as simple as biking to work or taking your lunch break at the gym. (<a href=\"https://www.lifehacker.com/how-much-exercise-do-i-really-need-1823708126\" target=\"_blank\">Here’s a guide to how much exercise you need</a> each week, in general.)</p><h2 id=\"how-to-make-time-to-work-out\">How to make time to work out</h2><p>I know it's hard to find time to work out, especially if you're a stressed-out student—but that makes it all the more important you do carve out some time for taking care of your body, regardless of the effect it has on your mind. Taking into account that it could make you a <em>better</em> student, it practically becomes non-negotiable. </p><p>If getting to the gym, the bike path, or the rec center truly isn't feasible, there is plenty you can do from the comfort of home or your dorm room. Since we're looking to get the heart rate up here, focus on cardio, to the extent possible in your space. <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/health/the-best-free-cardio-workout-channels-on-youtube\" target=\"_blank\">YouTube is full of great follow-along workout videos</a> that can get blood pumping, for instance. I'd also recommend having a designated workout app to guide you. I'm <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/health/peloton-app-review\" target=\"_blank\">partial to Peloton's app</a>, but while that app has all kinds of class types from <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/health/peloton-class-with-no-peloton-bike\" target=\"_blank\">cycling</a> to <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/health/peloton-guided-walk-workouts-recommendation\" target=\"_blank\">walking</a> to <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/health/pelotons-yoga-offerings-are-surprisingly-robust\" target=\"_blank\">yoga</a>, it can also cost up to $44 a month, making it a little difficult to maintain for a student. As a free alternative, you can try <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/health/nike-training-club-app-review\" target=\"_blank\">Nike Training Club</a>, which has similar classes you can follow along with from home. Check with your university's student center about what's available, too. Schools offer all kinds of wellness-focused resources, from fitness apps to on-campus recreational centers. In grad school, I taught spin classes in my university's rec center that were free for other students to attend—and, true to the research, I always noticed a little cognitive boost when I did it right before class. </p>\n            </article>\n    </div>\n<div>\n    <div>\n        <p><span>The Daily Newsletter</span>\n            <span>Ready to do everything better?</span>\n        </p>\n        <p><img src=\"https://lifehacker.com/images/team/Jordan.png\" alt=\"Jordan Calhoun portrait\" />\n            <span>Jordan Calhoun\n            </span>\n            <span>Editor in chief</span>\n        </p>\n        <p><span><span>Get daily tips, tricks, <span>and tech guides</span></span> <span>from Jordan and the team.</span></span>\n    </p></div>\n    <div>\n        <p><span>The Daily Newsletter</span>\n            <span><span>Ready to do everything better?</span> <span>Get daily tips, tricks, <span>and tech guides</span></span> <span>from Jordan and the team.</span></span>\n        </p>\n    </div>\n</div>\n    </div>\n            <div>\n                <p><span>\n                        Keep Scrolling for Next Article\n                    </span>\n                </p>\n            </div>\n        </div>\n    </div>"

href=\"https://lifehacker.com/tech/best-gaming-laptops?test_uuid=015ZvAUxXams0rnBpajhMg2&test_variant=B\" target=\"_blank\"><u>it’s gaming</u></a>. But if there’s another area, it’s display technology. Yep, while Apple still stands behind its trademark LCD “retina” displays, Windows machines have been adopting OLED and touchscreens for years now. Luckily, according to industry experts, MacBook owners will soon be able to plan on having better screens, too.</p><p>The latest rumors come courtesy of TF International Securities analyst Ming-Chi Kuo, as well as Bloomberg’s Mark Gurman, both of whom have reliable track records reporting on Apple products. While this <a href=\"http://bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-01-11/apple-working-on-adding-touch-screens-to-macs-in-major-turnabout?sref=9hGJlFio\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"open in a new window\"><u>isn’t the first time</u></a> Apple has been rumored to be updating its laptop displays, we’ve now got a timeline update. </p><div>\n        <p><img src=\"https://lifehacker.com/images/short-lifehacker-logo.jpg\" alt=\"Lifehacker Logo\" /></p><div>\n            <p><span>You May Also Like</span></p>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n<p>According to a <a href=\"https://x.com/mingchikuo/status/1968249865940709538\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"open in a new window\"><u>post Kuo made to X on Sept. 17</u></a>, the MacBook Pro will be the first MacBook to receive an OLED update, and as a bonus, the new screen will also support touch. The upgraded model is “expected to enter mass production by late 2026,” although as is par for the course with these leaks, the post didn’t point to any particular sources to back this up. However, if you read between the lines and look at Kuo’s past <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/tech/everything-we-know-about-the-upcoming-iphone-17-series\" target=\"_blank\">spot-on speculations</a>, it’s likely an anonymous source from within Apple.</p><p>For a little bit of assurance, Gurman, who also frequently relies on such sources, was quick to agree with Kuo’s assertions in his <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2025-09-21/mark-gurman-s-iphone-17-first-impressions-touchscreen-macbook-pro-meta-glasses?cmpid=BBD092125_POWERON&utm_medium=email&utm_source=newsletter&utm_term=250921&utm_campaign=poweron\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"open in a new window\"><u>weekly Power On newsletter</u></a> this weekend, pointing to his original reporting on the topic from 2023. However, the reporter also added that the actual release date might be closer to early 2027, depending on how quickly Apple can get supply out. He also clarified that, technically, the revamp was planned for this year, but was moved back “due to OLED supply issues.”</p><p>As for the rest of Apple’s MacBook line, neither expert has updates on that end, although Gurman speculates that “if touch resonates on the MacBook Pro, I expect it to eventually come to other Macs as well.”</p><p>While the benefits behind a touchscreen laptop are fairly self explanatory, OLED is higher on my personal wishlist. The technology’s self-illuminating pixels will help with contrast, yes, <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/tech/extend-iphone-air-battery-life\" target=\"_blank\"><u>but like on the iPhone</u></a>, they should also aid with battery life. That’s because, while current MacBooks rely on a backlight that spans the entire display, parts of an OLED screen can remain off when not in use.</p><div>\n            <p><span>\n                What do you think so far?\n            </span>\n        </p></div>\n<p>It’s notable that Kuo and Gurman’s proposed timeline also matches with the release of the <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/tech/new-ipad-rumors?test_uuid=015ZvAUxXams0rnBpajhMg2&test_variant=B\" target=\"_blank\"><u>iPad Pro just last year</u></a>, which upgraded to an OLED screen for the first time. Given that iPadOS 26 also <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/tech/ipados-26-basically-turns-your-ipad-into-macbook-wwdc-2025?test_uuid=015ZvAUxXams0rnBpajhMg2&test_variant=B\" target=\"_blank\"><u>revamped the iPad user experience to be much more like using a MacBook</u></a>, it’s likely Apple is currently planning for more parity between its product categories.</p><p>On that note, Kuo’s post also reminded readers that a <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/tech/apple-affordable-macbook-rumors\" target=\"_blank\"><u>potential lower-cost MacBook that uses an iPhone processor</u></a> could be in the works for later this year, although specifics are still largely in the dark at this point. The analyst, however, did say this model would likely not include touch support, although that could change in the future.</p><p>As for other rumored Apple products, also still largely in the dark is a potential foldable iPhone, which Gurman says “will be the star of Apple’s 2026 product lineup.” As <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/tech/everything-that-the-iphone-air-tells-us-about-the-iphone-fold\" target=\"_blank\"><u>predicted by my colleague David Nield</u></a>, the reporter’s sources are increasingly telling him that “users should imagine two titanium iPhone Airs side-by-side,” but pricing and release date specifics are still up to the imagination for now.</p>\n            </article>\n    </div>\n<div>\n    <div>\n        <p><span>The Download Newsletter</span>\n            <span>Never miss a tech story</span>\n        </p>\n        <p><img src=\"https://lifehacker.com/images/team/Jake.png\" alt=\"Jake Peterson portrait\" />\n            <span>Jake Peterson\n            </span>\n            <span>Senior tech editor</span>\n        </p>\n        <p><span>Get the latest tech news, <span></span>reviews, <span></span>and advice from Jake and the team.</span>\n    </p></div>\n    <div>\n        <p><span>The Download Newsletter</span>\n            <span><span>Never miss a tech story.</span> Get the latest tech news, <span></span>reviews, <span></span>and advice from Jake and the team.</span>\n        </p>\n    </div>\n</div>\n    </div>\n            <div>\n                <p><span>\n                        Keep Scrolling for Next Article\n                    </span>\n                </p>\n            </div>\n        </div>\n    </div>"

There's a reason for the saying, \"hurts so good,\" right? But it turns out you don't need to suffer to see results: The Rally orbital massager, <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/health/rally-massage-gun-review?test_uuid=015ZvAUxXams0rnBpajhMg2&test_variant=A\" target=\"_blank\">which I have previously reviewed</a>, has completely changed my hard-ass approach to recovery.</p><p>Don't get me wrong—percussive massage guns have their place. They're powerful and effective at working out the deepest knots. But after months of inconsistent use, I realized something: I was avoiding my own recovery tool. The aggressive pounding felt like punishment rather than self-care, turning what should've been a daily wellness ritual into something I'd postpone until I was in serious pain.</p>\n<p>I'd skip sessions when I needed them most, only reaching for my massage gun when my muscles were screaming for attention. By then, I'd need that aggressive percussion just to make a dent in the tension I'd allowed to build up. During marathon training especially, I simply can't let this happen. That's where orbital massages come in.</p>\n<h2 id=\"why-rallys-gentler-recovery-changes-everything\">Why Rally's gentler recovery changes everything</h2><p>The Rally's orbital massage technology works differently than traditional percussive guns—instead of hammering muscles with rapid-fire pulses, picture the circular motion of a car buffer. Luckily, the motion is gentle enough that it feels more like a human touch, as opposed to turning me into a car getting buffed. </p><p>The Rally has taught me something crucial about sustainable self-care: I'm infinitely more likely to reach for a device that feels good to use, rather than one that hurts. It's a game-changer for consistency. With my old massage gun, I'd psyche myself out before sessions: \"<em>Do I really need this? Can I handle the intensity right now?\"</em> With the Rally, there's no mental barrier. I can use it while watching TV, during work breaks, or as part of my bedtime routine, without dreading the experience.</p><h2 id=\"building-up-when-you-need-to\">Building up when you need to</h2><p>Here's the best thing about the Rally: It can double as a percussive massager when you need more intensity. But now, instead of starting with the nuclear option, I work my way up to it. It's more comfortable and, I find, more effective: My muscles respond better to massage when they're already relaxed and have good blood flow. </p><p>I'll begin with the gentle orbital motion to warm up tissues and increase circulation, then switch to percussion mode if I encounter stubborn knots. I am far from anti-percussion massage—there are times when you need that deeper, more aggressive treatment, like after a particularly intense workout, when dealing with chronic knots, or for trigger point therapy. But now, those hurt-so-good instances are the exception, rather than the rule. </p><div>\n            <p><span>\n                What do you think so far?\n            </span>\n        </p></div>\n<p>The Rally's ability to switch between modes means I'm not locked into one approach. I have the gentleness for daily maintenance and the power for when things get serious.</p><h2 id=\"the-best-recovery-tool-is-the-one-you-actually-use\">The best recovery tool is the one you actually use</h2><p>By embracing the gentler, orbital massage as my daily default, I've created a sustainable self-care routine that prevents problems rather than just treating them. Proactive care beats reactive treatment every time.</p><p>Maybe my muscles are thanking me not because I'm punishing them less, but because I'm caring for them more consistently. Sometimes the revolutionary approach is simply being kinder to yourself, and having the tools that make that kindness effective. </p><p>If you've been avoiding your massage gun or find yourself using it only when you're already in pain, consider making the switch to orbital massage as your primary recovery method. Your future self (and your muscles) will thank you for choosing consistency over intensity.</p>\n            </article>"

                          </ol>\n            </div>\n    <h2 id=\"toc\">Table of Contents</h2>\n    <article>\n        <hr />\n        <p>Folks are finally starting to get their iPhone 17s, and now that the new phones are in the hands of people who don’t work for Apple, flaws are starting to come to light. Specifically, durability testers are saying that you might want to slap a case on your new phone.</p><p>Most notably, it turns out that the iPhone 17 Pro has a major flaw with its camera bump. While the lenses themselves are fine, the edges on the raised camera “plateau” (as Apple is calling it) can apparently get scuffed just by hanging out in the same bag or pocket as household items like coins or keys. That’s according to testing by reliable YouTube reviewer Zack Nelson, or <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KrOBzFwVzwA&t=50s\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"open in a new window\"><u>JerryRigEverything</u></a>, who bemoaned Apple’s decision to avoid adding a chamfer or other protective barrier around the camera bump.</p><p>“I think it was intentional,” the YouTuber says in his video. “So it looks cooler.”</p><div>\n        <p><img src=\"https://lifehacker.com/images/short-lifehacker-logo.jpg\" alt=\"Lifehacker Logo\" /></p><div>\n            <p><span>You May Also Like</span></p>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KrOBzFwVzwA&t=50s%EF%BF%BC%EF%BF%BCAccording\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"open in a new window\">According</a> to Nelson, the scratches probably have to do with Apple’s decision to move back to anodized aluminum for this model, as opposed to the titanium the company started using with the iPhone 15 Pro. Aluminum provides better cooling, and strong scratch resistance anywhere that the anodizing process adheres to, but the catch is that without chamfers, those corners tend to get missed during the anodizing bath.</p><p>For instance, when Nelson tried to scratch the flat parts of the plateau (as well as the rest of the back of the phone), it only produced dust that could be easily wiped off, good as new. But those camera plateau corners remained permanently chipped, even after wiping.</p><p>This follows a similar report from <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-09-19/chinese-iphone-buyers-complain-of-scratches-on-new-pro-models\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"open in a new window\"><u>Bloomberg</u></a>, which noted that display models of both the blue iPhone 17 Pro and black iPhone Air seemed especially prone to scratches, as well as <a href=\"https://mashable.com/article/broken-iphone-17-air\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"open in a new window\"><u>posts from users</u></a>, pointing out scratches across all colors and multiple models of the new iPhones, especially after being <a href=\"https://x.com/amisecured/status/1969144282809581972\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"open in a new window\"><u>attached to MagSafe accessories</u></a>. While it’s possible that some of these scratches could be wiped away, as shown in Nelson’s video, those around the corners look particularly nasty, and I’m not just talking about the camera plateau.</p><div>\n            <p><span>\n                What do you think so far?\n            </span>\n        </p></div>\n<h2 id=\"how-to-stop-scratches-on-your-iphone-17\">How to stop scratches on your iPhone 17</h2><p>While it’s certainly not ideal that your bare iPhone could be susceptible to scratches, there is a simple solution—slap a case on it. That’ll hide your fancy Apple branding, sure, but it will also ensure your phone doesn’t take the brunt of your keys or loose quarters, and add a barrier around those camera plateau edges. </p><p>This year, Apple has three case options, including a clear plastic, silicone, and a new fabric style case called TechWoven. In testing by YouTuber Arun Maini, or <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/shorts/pa8bfKRgsYE\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"open in a new window\"><u>Mrwhosetheboss</u></a>, the clear case was easily susceptible to scratches by simple household objects, but all other options held up well. That’s a relief for anyone who was burned by Apple’s previous fabric case, FineWoven, which also had its own <a href=\"https://www.cnet.com/tech/mobile/my-iphone-15-pro-maxs-finewoven-case-had-a-rough-week-and-it-shows/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"open in a new window\"><u>scratch-related drama</u></a> when it debuted alongside the iPhone 15 line.</p><p>Alternatively, you could go third-party. In that case, you’ve got plenty of options.
