    "body": "<article>\n        <hr />\n        <p>The Quick Settings panel on Android is an underrated powerhouse, often forgotten by most Android users. While a lot is said about the iPhone’s Control Center, if you're willing to put in some work, Android’s version is a lot more customizable and powerful.</p><p>You can use third-party apps to put virtually anything you want in the Quick Settings Panel. These can include simple shortcuts to apps and actions, or you could opt for quick access to things like your calendar appointments and weather updates.</p><h2 id=\"how-to-customize-the-quick-settings-panel\">How to customize the Quick Settings panel</h2><p>If you’re new to Android, or if you just haven't customized your phone much, your Quick Settings panel might still be in its default state. Let's check it out.</p>\n<p>Quick Settings is the panel you see on top of your notifications when you pull down the Notifications panel. It usually shows you tiles for controlling settings like Wi-Fi and Bluetooth right away, but you can swipe once more to expand and reveal even more settings and toggles.</p><div>\n    <p><img src=\"https://lifehacker.com/imagery/articles/01K49ER2NYEG5MFD7TJFNCGF29/images-5.fill.size_2000x1500.v1756959083.png\" alt=\"Quick Settings Panel on Pixel expanded.\" srcset=\"https://lifehacker.com/imagery/articles/01K49ER2NYEG5MFD7TJFNCGF29/images-5.fill.size_800x600.v1756959083.png 800w, https://lifehacker.com/imagery/articles/01K49ER2NYEG5MFD7TJFNCGF29/images-5.fill.size_1400x1050.v1756959083.png 1400w, https://lifehacker.com/imagery/articles/01K49ER2NYEG5MFD7TJFNCGF29/images-5.fill.size_2000x1500.v1756959083.png 2000w\" />\n            </p>\n            <p><span></span>\n                                        <span>Credit: Khamosh Pathak</span>\n                    </p>\n    </div>\n<p>I say \"usually\" because the panel looks different with each manufacturer or skin. So the Quick Settings panel will, by default, appear slightly different on Samsung phones than it does on Pixels, though as Android matures, manufacturers seem to be trying to play down differences.</p><div>\n    <p><img src=\"https://lifehacker.com/imagery/articles/01K49ER2NYEG5MFD7TJFNCGF29/images-6.fill.size_2000x1500.v1756959083.png\" alt=\"Editing Quick Settings.\" srcset=\"https://lifehacker.com/imagery/articles/01K49ER2NYEG5MFD7TJFNCGF29/images-6.fill.size_800x600.v1756959083.png 800w, https://lifehacker.com/imagery/articles/01K49ER2NYEG5MFD7TJFNCGF29/images-6.fill.size_1400x1050.v1756959083.png 1400w, https://lifehacker.com/imagery/articles/01K49ER2NYEG5MFD7TJFNCGF29/images-6.fill.size_2000x1500.v1756959083.png 2000w\" />\n            </p>\n            <p><span></span>\n                                        <span>Credit: Khamosh Pathak</span>\n                    </p>\n    </div>\n<p>The entire Quick Settings panel is customizable, and out of the box, you can move, edit, add, and expand the panel's tiles by tapping the <strong>Edit</strong> button in the bottom right corner. You'll see the Android defaults first, but if you scroll enough, you'll even see options for third-party apps. This is where most of the panel's extra power comes in. It's fairly straightforward, but for more on how to actually adjust your Quick Settings panel, check out my guide on <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/tech/how-to-make-quick-settings-better-on-pixel\" target=\"_blank\"><u>customizing the Quick Settings panel in Android 16</u></a>.</p><p>Now that we know how to use and add Quick Settings tiles, let’s talk about some of my favorite tiles for it.</p><h2 id=\"shortcuts-to-apps\">Shortcuts to apps</h2><div>\n    <p><img src=\"https://lifehacker.com/imagery/articles/01K49ER2NYEG5MFD7TJFNCGF29/images-7.fill.size_2000x1500.v1756959083.png\" alt=\"Creating Quick Settings tile for an app.\" srcset=\"https://lifehacker.com/imagery/articles/01K49ER2NYEG5MFD7TJFNCGF29/images-7.fill.size_800x600.v1756959083.png 800w, https://lifehacker.com/imagery/articles/01K49ER2NYEG5MFD7TJFNCGF29/images-7.fill.size_1400x1050.v1756959083.png 1400w, https://lifehacker.com/imagery/articles/01K49ER2NYEG5MFD7TJFNCGF29/images-7.fill.size_2000x1500.v1756959083.png 2000w\" />\n            </p>\n            <p><span></span>\n                                        <span>Credit: Khamosh Pathak</span>\n                    </p>\n    </div>\n<p>Some of the most convenient things to add to the Quick Settings panel are apps and app shortcuts. You can use the <a href=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.tombayley.tileshortcuts\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"open in a new window\">Tile Shortcuts app</a> to essentially put in anything you want in there, including websites and system level options. The app is free to use, but a $0.99 upgrade unlocks more features, like app shortcuts.</p><p>Open the app and tap the <strong>Plus</strong> button to create a new tile. Then choose if you want to add an app, shortcut, or website. Shortcuts are sourced from apps, so you can create a shortcut to open a Drive folder, open a contact, or to go to a saved location. Choose the action you want, select an icon, and you’re done.</p><p>One you create a tile, open the Quick Settings customization page to add it to your Quick Settings panel. But note one quirk. Before you add your tiles, they'll have generic names like “Tile 1” or “Tile 2” (also reflected in the app). Don't worry—this will change once they're actually in your Quick Settings panel.</p><h2 id=\"calendar-appointments\">Calendar appointments</h2><div>\n    <p><img src=\"https://lifehacker.com/imagery/articles/01K49ER2NYEG5MFD7TJFNCGF29/images-1.fill.size_2000x1125.v1756959082.png\" alt=\"CalenTile showing the next appointment.\" srcset=\"https://lifehacker.com/imagery/articles/01K49ER2NYEG5MFD7TJFNCGF29/images-1.fill.size_800x450.v1756959082.png 800w, https://lifehacker.com/imagery/articles/01K49ER2NYEG5MFD7TJFNCGF29/images-1.fill.size_1400x788.v1756959082.png 1400w, https://lifehacker.com/imagery/articles/01K49ER2NYEG5MFD7TJFNCGF29/images-1.fill.size_2000x1125.v1756959082.png 2000w\" />\n            </p>\n            <p><span></span>\n                                        <span>Credit: CalenTile</span>\n                    </p>\n    </div>\n<p><a href=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.gustavoas.calendarqst&amp;hl=en_IN\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"open in a new window\"><u>CalenTile</u></a> is a nifty utility that adds your next calendar appointment as a Quick Settings tile. To make use of this, you’ll have to expand the tile to a larger size. This app costs $0.99, but I think it's worth the expense if you use your Calendar to manage your entire schedule. The tile will show your next appointment’s time and name, and you can tap it to get more information.</p><div>\n            <p><span>\n                What do you think so far?\n            </span>\n        </p></div>\n<h2 id=\"keep-your-screen-active\">Keep your screen active</h2><div>\n    <p><img src=\"https://lifehacker.com/imagery/articles/01K49ER2NYEG5MFD7TJFNCGF29/images-2.fill.size_2000x1500.v1756959082.png\" alt=\"Third-party Quick Settings tiles.\" srcset=\"https://lifehacker.com/imagery/articles/01K49ER2NYEG5MFD7TJFNCGF29/images-2.fill.size_800x600.v1756959082.png 800w, https://lifehacker.com/imagery/articles/01K49ER2NYEG5MFD7TJFNCGF29/images-2.fill.size_1400x1050.v1756959082.png 1400w, https://lifehacker.com/imagery/articles/01K49ER2NYEG5MFD7TJFNCGF29/images-2.fill.size_2000x1500.v1756959082.png 2000w\" />\n            </p>\n            <p><span>Showing third-party Quick Settings tiles like Wakey, Chronus, TickTick, Bitwarden, and more.</span>\n                                        <span>Credit: Khamosh Pathak</span>\n                    </p>\n    </div>\n<p>Your device's screen will time out automatically if you’re not looking at it, but there are times when you might want it to stay on, like if you’re referring to documents, or if you’re using an Android tablet in the background at work. This is where an app like <a href=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.doublep.wakey\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"open in a new window\">Wakey</a> can help. It’s a simple free app, which has an optional $2.5 upgrade for removing ads. Open the app and give it notification access. A new \"Enable Wakey\" tile will show up in the Quick Settings toggle. When enabled, the screen will now stay on no matter what you do, or rather, don’t do, on your device.</p><h2 id=\"see-the-weather-at-a-glance\">See the weather at a glance</h2><p>The <a href=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.dvtonder.chronus\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"open in a new window\">Chronus</a> app offers an array of customizable weather widgets for your Home Screen. But there’s also an option to add a Quick Settings tile that shows just the temperature and weather conditions at a glance. To set this up, first open the Chronus app, tap the <strong>Menu</strong> button, and choose <strong>Quick Settings</strong>. Here, give the app permission to access your location, or add a location manually. Now, add the tile to Quick Settings and you’re done.</p><h2 id=\"a-shortcut-for-adding-reminder\">A shortcut for adding reminder</h2><p>One of the best use cases I can think of for Quick Settings is a shortcut to quickly create a reminder. The faster you can note down something you want to do, the higher the chance you won’t just forget about it later.</p><p>Many popular productivity apps, like <a href=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.ticktick.task&amp;hl=en_IN\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"open in a new window\"><u>TickTick</u></a>, <a href=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.todoist&amp;hl=en_IN\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"open in a new window\"><u>Todoist</u></a>, and <a href=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.microsoft.todos&amp;hl=en_IN\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"open in a new window\"><u>Microsoft To Do</u></a>, offer a Quick Settings tile that does just that. Check to see if your favorite productivity app does.</p><h2 id=\"easy-access-to-system-apps-features\">Easy access to system apps features</h2><div>\n    <p><img src=\"https://lifehacker.com/imagery/articles/01K49ER2NYEG5MFD7TJFNCGF29/images-3.fill.size_2000x1500.v1756959083.png\" alt=\"Adding system apps and toggles to Quick Settings.\" srcset=\"https://lifehacker.com/imagery/articles/01K49ER2NYEG5MFD7TJFNCGF29/images-3.fill.size_800x600.v1756959083.png 800w, https://lifehacker.com/imagery/articles/01K49ER2NYEG5MFD7TJFNCGF29/images-3.fill.size_1400x1050.v1756959083.png 1400w, https://lifehacker.com/imagery/articles/01K49ER2NYEG5MFD7TJFNCGF29/images-3.fill.size_2000x1500.v1756959083.png 2000w\" />\n            </p>\n            <p><span></span>\n                                        <span>Credit: Khamosh Pathak</span>\n                    </p>\n    </div>\n<p>If you’re using a Pixel, you can add some system apps to the Quick Settings panel as well.

It takes what’s on the screen and turns it into a minimalistic reading environment with customizable fonts. It removes all formatting, and even supports text to speech. As this is an accessibility feature, you have to select the page or text you want, and then share it to the Reading mode app to get started. But a faster way to do this is to use the Reading mode tile in Quick Settings. You’ll find the tile in the Third-party apps section, as long as you’ve installed the app linked above.</p>\n            </article>"

I'm content if I get one sale every day or two, as this enables me to purchase new pieces for my wardrobe—then eventually sell those, too. But the motto could also apply to my approach, as I not only earn money every day, but reroute it back into the resale process by using third-party apps to bolster my sales. What's that other motto? You have to spend money to make money? </p><p>Well, it's not entirely true. The three apps below have helped me boost my sales quite a bit, but they have free trials and one of them is completely free. So, really, if you're trying to make a buck on Poshmark, there's no harm in using these apps to get the money flowing. </p><div>\n        <p><img src=\"https://lifehacker.com/images/short-lifehacker-logo.jpg\" alt=\"Lifehacker Logo\" /></p><div>\n            <p><span>You May Also Like</span></p>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n<h2 id=\"vendoo-a-cross-lister\">Vendoo: a cross-lister</h2><div>\n    <p><img src=\"https://lifehacker.com/imagery/articles/01K46DP8ESP17PCGX7YYJZPAKZ/images-2.fill.size_2000x1117.v1756857311.png\" alt=\"Vendoo in iOS\" srcset=\"https://lifehacker.com/imagery/articles/01K46DP8ESP17PCGX7YYJZPAKZ/images-2.fill.size_800x447.v1756857311.png 800w, https://lifehacker.com/imagery/articles/01K46DP8ESP17PCGX7YYJZPAKZ/images-2.fill.size_1400x782.v1756857311.png 1400w, https://lifehacker.com/imagery/articles/01K46DP8ESP17PCGX7YYJZPAKZ/images-2.fill.size_2000x1117.v1756857311.png 2000w\" />\n            </p>\n            <p><span></span>\n                                        <span>Credit: Vendoo/Lindsey Ellefson</span>\n                    </p>\n    </div>\n<p>The first app I love here is <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/tech/vendoo-review-if-you-are-trying-to-sell-your-stuff-online\" target=\"_blank\">Vendoo, a cross-lister</a> that helps me splash my listings out across multiple marketplaces. It helps me list quickly not only to my beloved <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/tech/poshmark-app-review\" target=\"_blank\">Poshmark</a> (where I sell and buy the most, by far), but my second-favorite <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/tech/depop-app-review\" target=\"_blank\">Depop</a>, as well as <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/tech/mercari-resale-app-review\" target=\"_blank\">Mercari</a>, <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/tech/vestiaire-collective-app-review\" target=\"_blank\">Vestiaire Collective</a>, eBay, and more. </p><p>Instead of creating your listing in one of those apps as normal, you create it in Vendoo, where you can then set it to appear across all the other marketplaces where you manage a storefront. When an item sells on one platform, Vendoo will even delist it on the others so you don't run into any trouble with a buyer trying to purchase something that's already sold elsewhere. </p><p>It functions as an inventory manager, showing you which platforms you're performing better on, exactly how much you have for sale, and more. A lot of the individual apps, like <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/tech/what-i-learned-from-downloading-my-poshmark-data\" target=\"_blank\">Poshmark, also produce analytics for you</a>, but Vendoo is helpful in that it allows you to see a fuller picture across all your marketplaces. </p><p>If you're already established on one platform and want to move your listings over to others, you can import them into Vendoo, then export them out across the others. Obviously, this is an app designed for more serious sellers, like those who make a real income through reselling, own a physical boutique and also happen to sell online, or have hundreds of listings. I consider myself a casual seller, but I do have hundreds of listings up (not counting the hundreds I've sold), so it works for me. </p><p>If none of those describe you, it may not be worth it. It's pricey. For free, you can create and cross-list five new items per month and remove the backgrounds from three product images. For $9 per month, you can create and cross-list 25 new items and remove 25 backgrounds. $20 per month will let you create and cross list 125 new items that month, $30 per month will get you 250 that month, and $50 per month will get you 600 that month. For unlimited creations/cross listings, you need to pay $70 per month. You'll also pay additional fees, like $5 per month to include the ability to import listings or the ability to list on up to 10 marketplaces, depending on your needs.</p><h2 id=\"primelister-an-automator\">Primelister: an automator </h2><div>\n    <p><img src=\"https://lifehacker.com/imagery/articles/01K46DP8ESP17PCGX7YYJZPAKZ/images-3.fill.size_2000x1148.v1756857311.png\" alt=\"Primelister in iOS\" srcset=\"https://lifehacker.com/imagery/articles/01K46DP8ESP17PCGX7YYJZPAKZ/images-3.fill.size_800x459.v1756857311.png 800w, https://lifehacker.com/imagery/articles/01K46DP8ESP17PCGX7YYJZPAKZ/images-3.fill.size_1400x803.v1756857311.png 1400w, https://lifehacker.com/imagery/articles/01K46DP8ESP17PCGX7YYJZPAKZ/images-3.fill.size_2000x1148.v1756857311.png 2000w\" />\n            </p>\n            <p><span></span>\n                                        <span>Credit: PrimeLister/Lindsey Ellefson</span>\n                    </p>\n    </div>\n<p><a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/tech/primelister-app-review\" target=\"_blank\">PrimeLister</a> is an automator specifically for Poshmark and eBay, but I only use it for Posh. Essentially, for a fee, it does all the tedious little tasks that get more eyeballs on your listings: It shares items to designated landing pages that correspond to their brand or type, shares other users' listings to earn you good will and return shares that broaden your audience exposure, and automatically follows back new followers, if you want it to. </p><div>\n            <p><span>\n                What do you think so far?\n            </span>\n        </p></div>\n<p>After downloading it and forking over about $30 per month, I definitely saw an increase in sales. The most useful task it performed for me was the sending of automatic discount offers any time someone \"liked\" a listing of mine. I was impressed I could even dictate how long it waited to send those offers so likers aren't immediately spammed with notifications and it doesn't look like I had a robot doing my bidding (although I do). </p><p>Granted, many of these functions can be handled directly through Poshmark. You can share your listings to their appropriate landing pages (known as Posh Parties), send bulk discount offers, and mass-share your own listings to your followers, but you can't share other people's listings or send automatic discounts. Plus, if you do it through Poshmark, you do still have to be active about it. Every hour, you have to log in, check for a Posh Party, manually select all the listings you want to share to it, and share them, for instance. It's not a huge deal, but if you have a lot to sell, the $30 per month may be quite worth the investment. If not, <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/money/poshmark-hidden-bulk-selling-tools\" target=\"_blank\">check here for how to do a lot of these actions on your own</a>. </p><h2 id=\"ai-measure-a-measuring-tool\">AI Measure: a measuring tool</h2><div>\n    <p><img src=\"https://lifehacker.com/imagery/articles/01K46DP8ESP17PCGX7YYJZPAKZ/images-1.fill.size_2000x1131.v1756857311.png\" alt=\"AI Measure\" srcset=\"https://lifehacker.com/imagery/articles/01K46DP8ESP17PCGX7YYJZPAKZ/images-1.fill.size_800x452.v1756857311.png 800w, https://lifehacker.com/imagery/articles/01K46DP8ESP17PCGX7YYJZPAKZ/images-1.fill.size_1400x791.v1756857311.png 1400w, https://lifehacker.com/imagery/articles/01K46DP8ESP17PCGX7YYJZPAKZ/images-1.fill.size_2000x1131.v1756857311.png 2000w\" />\n            </p>\n            <p><span></span>\n                                        <span>Credit: AI Measure/Lindsey Ellefson</span>\n                    </p>\n    </div>\n<p>The final app that's been helping me out quite a bit is AI Measure. Any good reseller on any platform knows that you should include measurement photos with any listing, not only to answer buyer questions before they're asked, but to avoid having something sent back to you for not being as described in the listing. Taking the time to lay a measuring tape across a piece of clothing, photograph it, and upload the pictures can save you a lot of headaches down the road, but that certainly doesn't mean I <em>do</em> it. I'm lazy and I take my chances—or at least I did, until I discovered <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/tech/ai-measure-clothing-app-review\" target=\"_blank\">AI Measure</a>. </p><p>This bare-bones measuring app automatically marks up your images with the measurements of the clothes within them. That's really all it does, but it's kind of a lifesaver. Using the native Measure app on the iPhone doesn't work the same—it doesn't allow you to show two or more measurements at a time. So, if you want to show the waist, inseam, and thigh width of a pair of pants, you'll need to take three pics. On top of that, the native Measure app doesn't have a shutter button, so you're relying on a blurry screenshot. AI Measure puts all the measurements on the image at once, has a shutter button so you can snap a pic, and, in my testing, gets the measurements right consistently. Using it is the same as taking a regular photo and you don't need to haul out a measuring tape, so there's no downside. </p><p>It's free, too. The background removal tool that comes with it didn't work for me, but I don't mind that because the other advertised function works just fine. Be advised that unlike the other two on this list, though, this one is only for iOS.</p>\n            </article>\n    </div>\n<div>\n    <div>\n        <p><span>The Download Newsletter</span>\n            <span>Never miss a tech story</span>\n        </p>\n        <p><img src=\"https://lifehacker.com/images/team/Jake.png\" alt=\"Jake Peterson portrait\" />\n            <span>Jake Peterson\n            </span>\n            <span>Senior tech editor</span>\n        </p>\n        <p><span>Get the latest tech news, <span></span>reviews, <span></span>and advice from Jake and the team.</span>\n    </p></div>\n    <div>\n        <p><span>The Download Newsletter</span>\n            <span><span>Never miss a tech story.</span> Get the latest tech news, <span></span>reviews, <span></span>and advice from Jake and the team.</span>\n        </p>\n    </div>\n</div>\n    </div>\n            <div>\n                <p><span>\n                        Keep Scrolling for Next Article\n                    </span>\n                </p>\n            </div>\n        </div>\n    </div>"

The app now generates practice sessions for you to either listen or speak along with. These lessons are generated by AI, and, according to Google, \"intelligently adapt to your skill level.\" It follows a different AI-powered experiment Google launched back in April called \"<a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/tech/google-launches-an-ai-powered-duolingo-alternative\" target=\"_blank\">Language Lessons</a>,\" though Google Translate's implementation seems a bit more basic.</p><p>This feature is rolling out this week on iOS and Android in beta. It doesn't seem to have landed on my Translate app yet, but here's how Google says it'll work: First, Google Translate will ask you how skilled you are in the current language: \"Basic,\" which means you know some words and phrases; \"Intermediate,\" which means you can express opinions and chat about everyday things; and \"Advanced,\" which means you can talk about a myriad of subjects in-depth. (There is also going to be a \"Just starting\" option, but it's not yet available.) </p><div>\n        <p><img src=\"https://lifehacker.com/images/short-lifehacker-logo.jpg\" alt=\"Lifehacker Logo\" /></p><div>\n            <p><span>You May Also Like</span></p>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n<p>Once you make your choice, you can share your motivation for learning the language—either something you write yourself, or something you choose from the app. (You can skip this if you want, though I imagine it helps the AI focus on lessons tailored to your learning goals.) From here, the app generates experiences for you to practice with. For example, it might suggest a scenario in which you practice asking about different meal times. If you choose this scenario, you then pick whether you'd like to practice listening or speaking. Your listening practice may play you a short clip of someone speaking in your target language, then have you select words from a list you recognize. Speaking practices may have you saying phrases that appear on-screen. </p>\n<p>It's simple, but it could be effective. Google says it worked with \"learning experts\" to develop these tools based on the latest research in language acquisition. If I can learn how to better speak and understand Portuguese for free, that sounds good to me, but only time will tell whether this is on-par with a dedicated language learning app like Duolingo.</p><div>\n            <p><span>\n                What do you think so far?\n            </span>\n        </p></div>\n<h2 id=\"live-conversation-upgrades\">Live Conversation upgrades </h2><p>The other new feature here is an upgrade to the existing \"live conversation\" feature. The idea is to turn on live conversation and to start speaking to the other person as you normally would. Then, the app translates what you said, and shows that translation to the other person. </p><p>The new upgrade, however, appears to push the feature a bit further. Now, the app will translate what you're saying in real time, so the other person can read the translation as you're speaking. If they want or need to hear the translation in full, the app will read out for transcript once you're done speaking. Google says this feature works for live conversations in over 70 languages, including Arabic, French, Hindi, Korean, Spanish, and Tamil, and are available in Google Translate for users in the U.S., India, and Mexico. </p><p>You can see an example of how this new experience works from <a href=\"https://youtu.be/kHbKQjVI_qc\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"open in a new window\">this video</a>. When I tried it out, the app does seem to translate pretty quickly, which I can only imagine makes conversation easier:</p>\n            </article>\n    </div>\n<div>\n    <div>\n        <p><span>The Download Newsletter</span>\n            <span>Never miss a tech story</span>\n        </p>\n        <p><img src=\"https://lifehacker.com/images/team/Jake.png\" alt=\"Jake Peterson portrait\" />\n            <span>Jake Peterson\n            </span>\n            <span>Senior tech editor</span>\n        </p>\n        <p><span>Get the latest tech news, <span></span>reviews, <span></span>and advice from Jake and the team.</span>\n    </p></div>\n    <div>\n        <p><span>The Download Newsletter</span>\n            <span><span>Never miss a tech story.</span> Get the latest tech news, <span></span>reviews, <span></span>and advice from Jake and the team.</span>\n        </p>\n    </div>\n</div>\n    </div>\n            <div>\n                <p><span>\n                        Keep Scrolling for Next Article\n                    </span>\n                </p>\n            </div>\n        </div>"

/><p>Do you ever think to yourself while browsing the internet, \"If only an AI bot could do this for me?\" I don't, but I imagine some people must, as Anthropic is now rolling out an experiment to allow just that for certain Chrome users. </p><p><a href=\"https://www.anthropic.com/news/claude-for-chrome\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"open in a new window\">The company announced the new integration on Tuesday</a>. Eligible users will now have access to a Chrome extension that, when enabled, allows Claude AI to see everything you're doing in your browser. Claude can use this context to better respond to questions and queries, which you can access from the extension's built-in chatbot window. </p><div>\n        <p><img src=\"https://lifehacker.com/images/short-lifehacker-logo.jpg\" alt=\"Lifehacker Logo\" /></p><div>\n            <p><span>You May Also Like</span></p>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n<p>But while this is one component of the feature, Anthropic's vision goes well beyond a more useful chatbot experience. In addition to more contextual interactions, Claude for Chrome can also <em>take over your browser</em>, and run actions for you. It's really the stuff of the future, though I'm not sure it's a future I really want. </p><p>Here's an example: Let's say you're looking for an apartment. Instead of opening Zillow yourself, you can click the Claude button in Chrome to launch the chatbot, and tell it exactly what you're looking for in a new home. As part of that request, you can ask Claude to look up the listings on Zillow for you, and share the best listings. According to Anthropic, Claude will do this for you, and will even tell you which permissions it needs you to enable within the chatbot window to complete the task, such as reading page content on <a href=\"http://zillow.com/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"open in a new window\">Zillow.com</a>. </p><p>In another example, Anthropic shows the user asking Claude to find a well-reviewed restaurant on DoorDash that serves garlic noodles, and add the dish to their cart. Claude walks through its steps, including what it sees on the DoorDash home page, how it needs to search for \"garlic noodles,\" and even that it needs to press \"Enter\" to perform the search.  </p>\n<p>If it works as advertised, it's kind of wild that you can ask a chatbot like Claude to do things on a web browser like Chrome, and it just will. But for most tasks, I don't necessarily see the point. I suppose if you're too busy to look up apartment listings yourself, or to find noodles to order for dinner, Claude for Chrome offers a multitasking opportunity. But I don't usually have a problem with these types of tasks. In fact, when I've had to find a new apartment or home, I've enjoyed looking for myself; I also like picking out a good restaurant for dinner. These aren't things I necessarily need or want a bot for, especially for results that are quite subjective: Why would Claude know what apartments look right for me, or whether I'd prefer noodles from one restaurant over another? I'd prefer to choose those things for myself.</p><div>\n            <p><span>\n                What do you think so far?\n            </span>\n        </p></div>\n<h2 id=\"claude-for-chrome-and-your-security\">Claude for Chrome and your security</h2><p>Then there are the security concerns, which Anthropic is transparent about. The company acknowledges that AI browsers are susceptible to prompt injection attacks, a type of cyberattack in which bad actors add malicious instructions to AI models. In its testing, the company found that before implementing any of its safety measures, prompt injection attacks had a 23.6% success rate. In one of these successful tests, Anthropic sent a malicious email with instructions to delete all emails in an inbox. Claude for Chrome read the email and followed the instructions. Not ideal. </p><p>But this is without the security measures in place, which Anthropic says it has been working on. That includes giving users control over all site-level permissions, as well as checking with the user before taking \"high-risk\" action like publishing content, making purchases, or sharing personal details. The company has also improved Claude's instructions on how to handle personal data, and blocked the bot from \"high-risk\" sites, like those dealing with finances, or adult or pirated content. Anthropic is working on more guardrails too, which is why this feature is currently quite limited.  </p><h2 id=\"how-to-sign-up-for-claude-for-chrome\">How to sign up for Claude for Chrome</h2><p>Right now, Anthropic is only offering the initial test to 1,000 Claude Max subscribers, which costs either $100 or $200 per month. The company will continue rolling out the early access to more Max subscribers over the coming weeks, though I wouldn't be surprised to see them eventually open testing to Pro subscribers ($20/month) down the line.</p><p>If you're eligible, <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScc03qA6A9A0oBRNzDPn8z_QZHt-E_78ke6NmJCPIOXycvz0g/viewform\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"open in a new window\">you can sign up for the waitlist right now</a>.

Sometimes it's <a href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/@xpmovement/video/7109957807843216686?lang=en\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"open in a new window\">muscular men in army fatigues</a>, and others it's people in <a href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/@phenicfox/video/7336457313844333866\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"open in a new window\">furry masks and tails</a> gracefully bounding across parks. </p><p>The movement combines elements of parkour, gymnastics, and animal locomotion, creating workouts that are part fitness routine, part creative expression, and part return to \"primal movement.\"  Welcome to \"quadrobics,\" the latest fitness trend has people literally going back to basics—or rather, back to the movement patterns our four-legged friends never abandoned.</p><p>My colleague Lindsey Ellefson recently recommended <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/health/what-is-primal-movement-exercise\" target=\"_blank\">primal movement</a> as an alternative way to exercise. I agree there's merit to the idea that getting on all fours can reframe exercise as more joyful, especially if you struggle to work out. I'm not here to talk you out of running all fours. I'd simply like to remind anyone who endeavors to follow the <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/health/best-home-gym-equipment\" target=\"_blank\">latest fitness trends</a> that two legs can get the job done just as well.</p><div>\n        <p><img src=\"https://lifehacker.com/images/short-lifehacker-logo.jpg\" alt=\"Lifehacker Logo\" /></p><div>\n            <p><span>You May Also Like</span></p>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n<h2 id=\"what-exactly-is-quadrobics\">What exactly is quadrobics?</h2><p>At its core, quadrobics involves moving on all fours using various animal-inspired patterns. A <a href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/@phenicfox/video/7336457313844333866\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"open in a new window\">quick search on TikTok</a> shows that there's an extra cultural element to the practice: The aesthetic component—complete with animal ears, tails, and masks—has become just as important as the physical exercise itself. If that's not your thing, the fitness side of it still about tapping into your animalistic instincts. You might crawl like a bear, bound like a rabbit, or stalk like a big cat, often incorporating jumps, rolls, and other dynamic movements.</p><p>Despite its unconventional appearance, quadrobics does offer legitimate fitness benefits. Moving on all fours engages the entire body in ways that traditional upright exercises often don't. It requires significant core strength, works the shoulders and arms through weight-bearing positions, and challenges coordination and balance.</p><h2 id=\"four-legs-good-two-legsalso-good\">Four legs good, two legs...also good</h2><p>Part of quadrobics' appeal undoubtedly lies in its visual novelty and social share-ability. In an era where fitness influencers are constantly seeking the next eye-catching workout trend, moving like an animal certainly will make you stand out in a crowded field of kettlebell swings and burpees. The costume element adds another layer of engagement, appealing to communities interested in alternative identities, cosplay, and self-expression.</p><p>While quadrobics enthusiasts are <a href=\"https://nypost.com/2025/08/26/health/run-and-jump-on-all-fours-like-an-animal-for-quadrobics-fitness-trend/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"open in a new window\">having their moment</a> in the social media spotlight, it's worth remembering that human beings evolved to be pretty solid at bipedal locomotion. Running, walking, jumping, dancing, cycling, swimming—the list of highly effective exercises you can do on two legs is virtually endless. It's also worth noting that switching to all-fours introduces some risk: Without proper form, you could easily experience a wrist or shoulder injury from supporting body weight.</p><div>\n            <p><span>\n                What do you think so far?\n            </span>\n        </p></div>\n<h2 id=\"both-two-and-four-legged-exercise-will-serve-you-well\">Both two- and four-legged exercise will serve you well</h2><p>Want to build functional strength? Two-legged squats, lunges, and deadlifts have got you covered. Looking for coordination challenges? Try dance, martial arts, or agility drills. Seeking that mind-body connection? Yoga offers centuries of refined practice. The beauty of bipedal movement is its versatility—you can go from a gentle walk to an intense sprint workout using the same basic mechanics you've been perfecting since you learned to walk as a toddler. While quadrobics practitioners hop and crawl their way to fitness goals, the rest of us can take comfort in knowing that our bipedal design is spectacular as-is. </p><p>The most important thing isn't how many limbs an exercise uses—it's that you move your body regularly in ways that challenge it, bring you satisfaction, and support your long-term health. I love the idea that people are increasingly willing to explore unconventional forms of movement and challenge traditional notions of what exercise should look like. This openness to experimentation is valuable, whether it leads someone to quadrobics, pole dancing, axe throwing, or rediscovering the joy of playground equipment.</p><h2 id=\"the-bottom-line\">The bottom line</h2><p>The real key is finding forms of movement that you genuinely enjoy and can sustain over time. For some people, that might indeed involve channeling their inner wolf. For others, it's a simple daily walk, a weekly tennis game, or a regular yoga practice. The \"best\" workout is ultimately the one you'll actually do consistently. If donning animal ears and practicing your bear crawl brings you joy and gets you moving, there's nothing wrong with embracing your wild side. Just remember this: Your perfectly adequate human legs have taken you this far in life. They're probably up for whatever fitness challenge you want to throw at them next.</p>\n            </article>\n    </div>\n<div>\n    <div>\n        <p><span>The Daily Newsletter</span>\n            <span>Ready to do everything better?</span>\n        </p>\n        <p><img src=\"https://lifehacker.com/images/team/Jordan.png\" alt=\"Jordan Calhoun portrait\" />\n            <span>Jordan Calhoun\n            </span>\n            <span>Editor in chief</span>\n        </p>\n        <p><span><span>Get daily tips, tricks, <span>and tech guides</span></span> <span>from Jordan and the team.</span></span>\n    </p></div>\n    <div>\n        <p><span>The Daily Newsletter</span>\n            <span><span>Ready to do everything better?</span> <span>Get daily tips, tricks, <span>and tech guides</span></span> <span>from Jordan and the team.</span></span>\n        </p>\n    </div>\n</div>\n    </div>\n            <div>\n                <p><span>\n                        Keep Scrolling for Next Article\n                    </span>\n                </p>\n            </div>\n        </div>\n    </div>"
