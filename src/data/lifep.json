href=\"https://www.google.com/preferences/source?q=lifehacker.com\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"open in a new window\">adding Lifehacker as a preferred source for tech news</a></em><em>.</em></p><p>You may have heard of the Pomodoro technique before—<a href=\"https://www.lifehacker.com/productivity-101-a-primer-to-the-pomodoro-technique-1598992730\" target=\"_blank\">perhaps even here at Lifehacker</a>—and might already be aware it’s a solid productivity hack. But applied in another way, i can actually be more than that: This technique is also an excellent study tool that can help you maximize your focus and retention. It's time-tested, variable, and available to you whether you want to do it the old-fashioned way or call in the help of an app. </p><h2 id=\"what-is-the-pomodoro-technique\">What is the Pomodoro technique?</h2><p>Although it has a fancy name, the technique itself is simple: If you have a large task to complete, you should break it down into pieces and schedule breaks to reward yourself in between finishing bits of it. The scheduling is the key part: When following the classic Pomodoro model, you have to set an alarm for 25 minutes and 25 minutes only. So, work for 25 minutes, and when the alarm goes off, take a five-minute break, maybe to grab a snack, refill your coffee, or scroll social media. When the five minutes are up, get back to work. Do this over and over, but every four cycles, give yourself a bigger break, up to a half an hour.</p><div>\n        <p><img src=\"https://lifehacker.com/images/short-lifehacker-logo.jpg\" alt=\"Lifehacker Logo\" /></p><div>\n            <p><span>You May Also Like</span></p>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n<p>In the event something distracts you—whether it’s your phone or another person—you have to reset your timer, so try instead to be direct and tell them you’re busy and will be able to reconnect with them in a bit. Then, put them off until you get your five-minute break or even after your whole task is finished. </p><p>This works because you are aware you’re getting that little reset once your 25 minutes are up. You can throw yourself into the task knowing there’s a little treat coming down the pipeline. And while you rest up, your brain is processing everything you just learned. </p><h2 id=\"how-to-use-pomodoro-for-studying\">How to use Pomodoro for studying</h2><p>We usually discuss the Pomodoro technique in terms of working professionally, especially when there’s a big project you need to complete, but its origins actually come from the academic sphere. The method was invented by Fancesco Cirillo, a developer and entrepreneur, but he came up with it when he was a student. It’s actually named for the little tomato-shaped timer he used when he was studying. Those methods are certainly still viable, but the popularity of his technique has also birthed a cottage industry of specialty timers. On Amazon, <a href=\"https://zdcs.link/aADMrL?pageview_type=Standard&template=Explainers&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=you%20can%20get%20a%20Pomodoro-specific%20timer&short_url=aADMrL&u=https%3A%2F%2Flifehacker.com%2Fhow-to-use-the-pomodoro-method-for-studying&event_label=you%20can%20get%20a%20Pomodoro-specific%20timer\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"open in a new window\">you can get a Pomodoro-specific timer</a> for under $20. These offer different preset time allotments, so you don't have to stick to the 25 on, five off model—but I'll get to that in a moment.</p><p>You can use this method to study for a test by breaking up the content you need to review. You go by chapter, by content, or by “chunk,” if you’re <a href=\"https://www.lifehacker.com/use-the-chunking-method-to-actually-remember-what-you-1850392462\" target=\"_blank\">using the chunking method</a> to divvy up your study load (which you should be). It’s a good way to stay on task if you get easily distracted and dividing your topics up will help you remember them better. It’s not ideal for quick cramming sessions, however, since you need at least two hours to get four “Pomodoros” in. Do this on a day you have plenty of time to devote to studying—and, of course, relaxing.</p><h2 id=\"pomodoro-variations-that-work-for-studying\">Pomodoro variations that work for studying</h2><p>As noted, the classic Pomodoro technique involves 25 minutes on and five minutes off, but you needn't be so rigid—there's a reason those Pomodoro timers don't lock you to those intervals. Twenty-five minute increments worked for Cirillo and countless adherents after him, but they may not work for you. I do recommend starting with the classic technique, but if you're not finding yourself falling into <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/use-deep-work-to-be-more-productive-1850632295\" target=\"_blank\">a state of deep work</a> during those blocks of time, you have to switch things up. </p><p>There's a lot of flexibility to the method, so feel free to experiment. For instance, one student invented \"<a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/work/how-to-use-animedoro-productivity-method\" target=\"_blank\">Animedoro</a>\" a few years ago. This approach involves working for longer intervals, around 40 to 60 minutes, then getting 20 minutes to relax and do something you enjoy—like watching an episode of anime, which tend to be about 20 minutes long. With longer working time, you have a better chance of getting into deep work and focusing, plus not getting discombobulated when your timer suddenly goes off. </p><div>\n            <p><span>\n                What do you think so far?\n            </span>\n        </p></div>\n<p>Another approach is called <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/work/try-pomodoro-20-to-focus-on-deep-work\" target=\"_blank\">Pomodoro 2.0</a> and it involves adding 15 minutes to your work period every time you return to your task, so you focus longer and longer as you go. You still need to take breaks, of course, and you can even make those incrementally longer too. </p><p>Or maybe you prefer to work in quick bursts. You can try variations where you study for just 10 minutes before a short break, giving yourself a sense of urgency as you try to see how many flashcards you can study in that time. The point is it's up to you: A period of work interspersed with breaks is the only core element of the method, and you can approach it in whatever way you find most useful. Just keep in mind that you'll get better results if you commit to a set structure, even if it takes some time to adjust to it.</p><h2 id=\"pomodoro-apps-can-help\">Pomodoro apps can help</h2><p>I'm a fan of those Pomodoro timers because they keep me off my phone, which is a major distraction—it's a slippery slope from setting an alarm to checking a notification and then finding myself in a Reels hole 10 minutes of my allotted study time. </p><p>Then again, the phone can be useful if you're using it productively. Many focus timer apps can be used with the Pomodoro method, and will even block other apps during the work-time increments you set, or otherwise penalize you for getting distracted when you should be focusing. (If you need suggestions, <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/tech/best-focus-timer-apps\" target=\"_blank\">I've previously written about a few of my favorites</a>.)</p><p>There are also Pomodoro-specific apps—including <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/tech/focuspomo-app-review\" target=\"_blank\">my top pick, FocusPomo</a>—that exist purely to help you structure your study or productivity time around the famous technique. If using your phone alarm seems risky and buying a tabletop timer off Amazon feels antiquated, look into one of these. </p>\n            </article>\n    </div>\n<div>\n    <div>\n        <p><span>The Daily Newsletter</span>\n            <span>Ready to do everything better?</span>\n        </p>\n        <p><img src=\"https://lifehacker.com/images/team/Jordan.png\" alt=\"Jordan Calhoun portrait\" />\n            <span>Jordan Calhoun\n            </span>\n            <span>Editor in chief</span>\n        </p>\n        <p><span><span>Get daily tips, tricks, <span>and tech guides</span></span> <span>from Jordan and the team.</span></span>\n    </p></div>\n    <div>\n        <p><span>The Daily Newsletter</span>\n            <span><span>Ready to do everything better?</span> <span>Get daily tips, tricks, <span>and tech guides</span></span> <span>from Jordan and the team.</span></span>\n        </p>\n    </div>\n</div>\n    </div>\n            <div>\n                <p><span>\n                        Keep Scrolling for Next Article\n                    </span>\n                </p>\n            </div>\n        </div>\n    </div>"

Some of the hottest tricks people have been using lately to save on their travels are websites that let you buy other people's non-refundable vacations, from flights to hotels to cruises. If this sounds like your vibe, buckle up. </p><p>Here are some of the best travel websites you can use to snag your next trip on the cheap.</p><h2 id=\"google-flights-explore-tool\">Google Flights' explore tool</h2><p>I expect most people to know this one, but I have to start the list somewhere. For those who might not know, Google Flights has an <a href=\"https://www.google.com/travel/explore\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"open in a new window\">“explore” tool</a> where you see a map of your potential destinations from your local airport and their prices. This is great when you don't have a specific destination in mind but want to get away and see where you could potentially travel to. You can scroll through the planet and find some bargains that you might've never seen otherwise. </p><p><strong>Quick tip</strong>: If you have a budget, use the filters on the top left to set it and see where you can afford to travel to around the world. </p><h2 id=\"use-skyscanner-to-find-the-cheapest-flights\">Use Skyscanner to find the cheapest flights</h2><p>Yes, Google Flights is more user-friendly and has cool features, but if you mean business and are looking for the <em>cheapest </em>flight options you can find, <a href=\"https://www.skyscanner.net/flights\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"open in a new window\">Skyscanner</a> is what you want to use. Here, you’ll find flights that will not even appear on Google Flights, and it even has an <a href=\"https://www.skyscanner.net/transport/flights-from/atla/?oym=2506\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"open in a new window\">explore-like</a> tool similar to Google’s where you simply input your local airport, select “whole month” for dates, and click “search” to find all the possible low-cost destinations for that month (I found a direct flight to Cancun from my home in Atlanta for $183). </p><p>You can catch last-minute flight deals and set alerts for cheap flights as well.</p><h2 id=\"shop-second-hand-vacation-packages-from-people-who-cant-get-refunds\">Shop second-hand vacation packages from people who can't get refunds</h2><p>Imagine you buy a whole package deal for a family vacation months in advance but, like most people, you forego the travel insurance. You have a family emergency and can no longer take the trip. What can you do? Sell your vacation on the internet. </p><p>Websites like Sparefare, Roomer, Plans Change, and Transfer Travel let you buy other people's vacations that they can no longer use themselves. You can both save money and get these people out of a sticky situation. Here's a quick breakdown of your options:</p><h3>TransferTravel</h3><p><a href=\"https://www.transfertravel.com/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"open in a new window\">TransferTravel</a> is like the Facebook Marketplace of travel plans. You can find anything from cruises, to flights, to hotels, events, and more. It's the most wide-ranging of all of these websites that offer transferable travel products. </p><h3>SpareFare</h3><p><a href=\"https://sparefare.net/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"open in a new window\">SpareFare</a> focuses on flight tickets or vouchers, hotel reservations, and holiday packages. You'll be connected directly with the seller to get their non-refundable bookings. SpareFare also helps you manage the name change process for airline tickets, which can get a bit complicated if you do it by yourself.</p><h3>Roomer</h3><p>If you're focusing on finding hotels at a bargain, use <a href=\"https://www.roomertravel.com/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"open in a new window\">Roomer</a>. The website focuses on showing you non-refundable bookings from people desperately trying to recoup any money they can. You can find hotels from all over the world and filter by number of occupants, dates, and location. You might not always find something available where you're staying, but if you do, you'll be a happy camper. </p><div>\n            <p><span>\n                What do you think so far?\n            </span>\n        </p></div>\n<h3>PlansChange</h3><p><a href=\"https://www.planschange.com/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"open in a new window\">PlansChange</a> is exactly like Roomer, but it's smaller in scope and reach. It doesn't hurt to check both when you find yourself looking for a bargain stay.</p><h2 id=\"use-secretflying-to-set-up-alerts-for-their-error-fares\">Use SecretFlying to set up alerts for their “Error Fares”</h2><p>Airlines make mistakes sometimes, and as a savvy traveler, you need to be ready to take advantage of them when you can. <a href=\"https://www.secretflying.com/usa-deals/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"open in a new window\">SecretFlying</a> is a travel deal website that works like many others, but it also has  a special tool to find cheap flights that exist because of mistakes that airlines make. (For example, there was an enticing <a href=\"https://www.secretflying.com/posts/error-fare-chicago-to-london-uk-for-only-58-roundtrip/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"open in a new window\">Chicago to London round-trip for only $58</a> last month.) The error fares go fast, and many might not logistically work for you, but if you ever do catch one of these, you’ll be bragging about it for years to come. </p><h2 id=\"use-the-travel-arrow-extension\">Use the Travel Arrow extension</h2><p>If you're still only using Google Flights to do your searching, you could be missing out on some cheaper options. Travel Arrow is an extension you can install on your browser that will <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/this-chrome-extension-searches-every-airline-booking-si-1850709238\" target=\"_blank\">cross-reference your Google Flight info</a> on Skyscanner, Kayak, Trip, and Expedia (all the major competitors to Google Flights). While it doesn't always work, it's a free tool that will more than pay for itself if you ever end up booking a cheaper flight with it. Keep in mind that some flights might be cheaper because their layovers are longer.</p><h2 id=\"use-these-online-vacation-package-websites\">Use these online vacation package websites</h2><p>There are <em>many</em> websites that sell you travel packages that include flights, hotels, food, tours, and even transportation (rails, buses, taxis, etc.) for <em>much </em>cheaper than you would find if you tried to book each piece individually. The catch is that these packages are typically strict on dates, and their cancellation policies are often less forgiving. <em>But</em> you’ll be able to find amazing deals at locations you might not otherwise be able to afford. </p><p><a href=\"https://www.gate1travel.com/?Brand=GATE1\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"open in a new window\">Gate1</a>, for example, has been around since the '80s—my mom has used it with my dad to visit the eight wonders of the world on a budget over the years. Their best deals come from their <a href=\"https://www.gate1travel.com/featured-specials\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"open in a new window\">weekly specials</a> (you can sign up for their emails) and <a href=\"https://www.gate1travel.com/last-minute-deals\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"open in a new window\">last-minute deals</a> where you can find multi-day trips for big discounts. </p><p>For example, you can do a 13-day Thailand trip for $2,249 with all this included:</p><ul><li><p>Roundtrip flights Los Angeles to Bangkok, or Bangkok to Los Angeles </p></li><li><p>Intra-flight Chiang Mai to Bangkok</p></li><li><p>11 nights First Class accommodations</p></li><li><p>Hotel taxes, fees, service charges, and porterage</p></li><li><p>18 meals: 11 breakfasts, 3 lunches, 4 dinners</p></li><li><p>Sightseeing per itinerary in modern air-conditioned motor coach</p></li><li><p>Services of English-speaking tour manager throughout</p></li><li><p>Entrance fees per itinerary</p></li></ul><p>Here are some other websites similar to Gate1 where you can find great deals on packages for your next trip:</p><ul><li><p><a href=\"https://www.travelpirates.com/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"open in a new window\">TravelPirates</a></p></li><li><p><a href=\"https://www.greatvaluevacations.com/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"open in a new window\">Great Value Vacations</a></p></li><li><p><a href=\"https://www.going.com/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"open in a new window\">Going</a> (formerly Scott’s Cheap Flights)</p></li></ul>\n            </article>"

Scientists have figured out how many units of information you can store in your short-term memory (around seven, <a href=\"https://www.lifehacker.com/preview/study-in-chunks-to-remember-more-1850392462?rev=1682969564950\" target=\"_blank\">though there are great workarounds for remembering more</a> than that), but if you <em>really</em> want to remember something,  you have to go over it a bunch of times until it lodges deeper in your brain. </p><p>There are <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/use-the-leitner-system-to-study-more-effectively-1850786716\" target=\"_blank\">quite a few ways to do that</a> if you have some time to devote to the practice of repetition, but if you’re getting ready for a test at school or a presentation at work, you might not have too long to go over the content again and again and <em>again</em>—but you do, if you make a personal podcast. This technique requires you to make an effort only once, then calls on you to relax and absorb the information more passively, making it ideal for studying or reviewing when you are short on time or heavy on other tasks. </p><div>\n        <p><img src=\"https://lifehacker.com/images/short-lifehacker-logo.jpg\" alt=\"Lifehacker Logo\" /></p><div>\n            <p><span>You May Also Like</span></p>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n<h2 id=\"how-to-make-a-podcast-to-help-you-study\">How to make a “podcast” to help you study</h2><div><p>Next time you want to retain the details of something you’re studying, open up the voice notes feature on your phone, because you’re going to make yourself a little study podcast. You <em>could</em> simply read your notes out loud into the mic; it’s the simplest option, and a good one. (If you’re memorizing a speech, just perform the whole thing. That's what I did in high school, when I was a forensics nerd and felt that using even a single notecard during a speech meet delegitimized my entire presentation. For what it's worth, I won a lot, which I partially attribute to being off-book while everyone else used aids.) </p><p>You do have other, more intensive, options though. You can record separate “episodes” for each mini-topic you’re studying, which will help you organize your thinking <em>and</em> provide an easy way to focus if you need brushing up in a particular area. Use <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/best-note-taking-methods-1849535943\" target=\"_blank\">your preferred note-taking method</a> or a r<a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/use-the-sq3r-method-to-study-more-effectively-1850780175\" target=\"_blank\">eading-and-retaining technique like SQ3R</a> to create outlines that are concise but make sense and hit on the points you most need to study, then write your scripts according to those notes. That part will take a while, but all of it, combined, will help you start to remember what you're supposed to be remembering.</p><p>You don’t have to worry about the thing actually being pleasant for others to listen to, so make it useful for your own study style. A few approaches you could take include asking yourself review questions out loud, pausing, and stating the right answer or reading entire passages from your textbook into the mic. You could even try out different characters and turn it into a role-playing scenario. Don't get too involved with it, though, unless that sort of creativity helps you focus; it's better to stick with facts and straightforward audio.</p></div><p>The most important part comes after you’ve recorded your personal podcast: You have to listen to it. You have to listen to it <em>a lot</em>. Play it through the speakers of your car or through your headphones on the train to make your commute productive. Play it at the grocery store, when you’re doing errands around the house, and when you are relaxing at night. Fall asleep listening to it. The first few times, you'll listen pretty actively, but even having it running as background noise will shove that information into your brain.</p><div>\n            <p><span>\n                What do you think so far?\n            </span>\n        </p></div>\n<h2 id=\"a-second-option-for-your-study-podcast\">A second option for your study podcast</h2><p>If you're going to do this, a major component of what makes it valuable is the part where you have to review the material, outline the script, and say it all out loud into your microphone. That's a big chunk of the studying right there. Still, if you don't have time for that or you are worried you won't highlight the most important parts if left to your own devices, there's another option that works well. </p><p><a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/tech/google-notebooklm-review\" target=\"_blank\">Google's NotebookLM</a> is an AI tool that pulls <em>only</em> from the material you give it. That means that unlike competitors such as ChatGPT, it doesn't answer your questions by searching the entire internet. Rather, it searches through PDFs, YouTube videos, links, and other resources you provide—and that's it. One of its coolest features is that it can <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/tech/use-google-notebooklm-ai-to-turn-your-research-into-a-podcast\" target=\"_blank\">create \"podcasts\"</a> for you based on those materials, in addition to its ability to <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/tech/googles-notebooklm-introduces-quizzes-flashcards-tools\" target=\"_blank\">create flashcards and quizzes</a>. These podcasts sound like real ones you might listen to in your everyday life: They have different voices and characters who speak conversationally but factually about the content of whatever you uploaded to the software. I love NotebookLM and use it all the time to organize my work. It's free to use and generates podcasts quickly, so it's worth considering here, too.</p><h2 id=\"why-a-personal-study-podcast-works\">Why a personal study podcast works</h2><div><p>Picking things up from your personal podcast is an example of rote learning, the process by which we memorize things based on repetition. But it has other advantages, too. </p><p>For instance, even when you’re compiling the notes and deciding <em>what </em>to include in the mini podcast, you’re studying—you’re making decisions about which concepts are most important, how they flow together, and how you can present your mastery of them to others. Even if you choose to let NotebookLM do it, you're still making decisions about which materials from your class or project to upload to the software and how to organize it, which is also studying. </p><p>Reading is all well and good, but you remember things better when you process them in a variety of ways. From organizing your notes to speaking them aloud and listening to them read back to you, every part of this process will help you more thoroughly process and recall the content. Each of those is commonly used on its own as a standalone study technique, so imagine how effective they’ll be together. </p></div>\n            </article>\n    </div>\n<div>\n    <div>\n        <p><span>The Download Newsletter</span>\n            <span>Never miss a tech story</span>\n        </p>\n        <p><img src=\"https://lifehacker.com/images/team/Jake.png\" alt=\"Jake Peterson portrait\" />\n            <span>Jake Peterson\n            </span>\n            <span>Senior tech editor</span>\n        </p>\n        <p><span>Get the latest tech news, <span></span>reviews, <span></span>and advice from Jake and the team.</span>\n    </p></div>\n    <div>\n        <p><span>The Download Newsletter</span>\n            <span><span>Never miss a tech story.</span> Get the latest tech news, <span></span>reviews, <span></span>and advice from Jake and the team.</span>\n        </p>\n    </div>\n</div>\n    </div>\n            <div>\n                <p><span>\n                        Keep Scrolling for Next Article\n                    </span>\n                </p>\n            </div>\n        </div>"

/><p>For as basic a necessity as it is, feeding yourself is a lot of work. What's more, feeding a household is even worse. There's the planning, then the shopping, the unpacking, the cooking, the storing, and finally, the cleaning, all of which has to be done over and over again forever. We all know what it's like to be faced with this task and just decide to open up Uber Eats and pay a bunch of fees to have someone do (most of) it for us. Apps are the saving grace when meal planning gets too daunting—but you're using the wrong apps. Forget Door Dash and Grub Hub: These apps can help you plan, shop for, and prepare meals on your own while still offloading some of the hard work on tech. </p><p>Here are some meal-planning apps that can suggest recipes based on your dietary preferences, put together shopping lists, and even walk you through the cooking. They can't box up leftovers or wash the dishes, but maybe one day in the future, we'll get there, too.</p><div>\n        <p><img src=\"https://lifehacker.com/images/short-lifehacker-logo.jpg\" alt=\"Lifehacker Logo\" /></p><div>\n            <p><span>You May Also Like</span></p>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n<h2 id=\"best-app-for-recipes-bigoven\">Best app for recipes: BigOven </h2><div>\n    <p><img src=\"https://lifehacker.com/imagery/articles/01K5ENZY2QS3V48SX95J2FN89P/images-1.fill.size_2000x1125.v1758218648.png\" alt=\"BigOven on browser\" srcset=\"https://lifehacker.com/imagery/articles/01K5ENZY2QS3V48SX95J2FN89P/images-1.fill.size_800x450.v1758218648.png 800w, https://lifehacker.com/imagery/articles/01K5ENZY2QS3V48SX95J2FN89P/images-1.fill.size_1400x788.v1758218648.png 1400w, https://lifehacker.com/imagery/articles/01K5ENZY2QS3V48SX95J2FN89P/images-1.fill.size_2000x1125.v1758218648.png 2000w\" />\n            </p>\n            <p><span></span>\n                                        <span>Credit: Lindsey Ellefson/BigOven</span>\n                    </p>\n    </div>\n<p><a href=\"https://zdcs.link/9wjZYq?pageview_type=Standard&template=Explainers&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=BigOven&short_url=9wjZYq&u=https%3A%2F%2Flifehacker.com%2Fbest-meal-planning-apps&event_label=BigOven\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"open in a new window\">BigOven</a> is a meal-planning app that grants you access over one million recipes—and new recipes are constantly being added. I like a few different things about it: First, you can input some of the ingredients you already have and get recipes based on those, reducing your grocery shopping and limiting how many of those million-plus recipes you need to scroll through. You can scan handwritten recipes in, too, and let the app turn them into recipes you can store there, preserving family traditions. Finally, I appreciate that it has a browser version, since that makes it easier to type, browse, and scroll. A few of the apps on this list also work on the browser. In general, I like to do a lot of my planning and work on the computer, then call in my phone at crunch time, just when I need to refer to a recipe. </p><p>The free version is nice, but limited. You get the ability to put together a grocery list and one free recipe scan. For more detailed meal planning, you’ll need to upgrade to its paid version for $2.99 per month or $24.99 for the year. Think of it like this: You'll save that much by skipping a delivery order or two. </p><h2 id=\"best-app-for-family-meal-planning-cozi\">Best app for family meal planning: Cozi </h2><div>\n    <p><img src=\"https://lifehacker.com/imagery/articles/01K5ENZY2QS3V48SX95J2FN89P/images-3.fill.size_2000x1131.v1758218648.png\" alt=\"Cozi in iOS\" srcset=\"https://lifehacker.com/imagery/articles/01K5ENZY2QS3V48SX95J2FN89P/images-3.fill.size_800x452.v1758218648.png 800w, https://lifehacker.com/imagery/articles/01K5ENZY2QS3V48SX95J2FN89P/images-3.fill.size_1400x792.v1758218648.png 1400w, https://lifehacker.com/imagery/articles/01K5ENZY2QS3V48SX95J2FN89P/images-3.fill.size_2000x1131.v1758218648.png 2000w\" />\n            </p>\n            <p><span></span>\n                                        <span>Credit: Lindsey Ellefson/Cozi</span>\n                    </p>\n    </div>\n<p><a href=\"https://zdcs.link/QOg182?pageview_type=Standard&template=Explainers&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=Cozi&short_url=QOg182&u=https%3A%2F%2Flifehacker.com%2Fbest-meal-planning-apps&event_label=Cozi\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"open in a new window\">Cozi</a> is a family organizer, so you might not think of food and recipes when you first hear about it—but don't be fooled. In addition to its daily calendar and to-do lists, Cozi provides space for you to keep a grocery list (which any family member can add to in real time) and even offers up recipes. Not only can you plan your meals' content, but you can schedule them for when everyone is available. </p><p>The basic version is free, but the premium version, which is $39.99 per year, offers more features, most of which have to do with the family management aspect (like birthday tracking and calendar searching). If you're using it for meal planning, you may not need to upgrade; I was able to build out an entire schedule of recipes without paying.</p><h2 id=\"best-app-for-fitness-and-nutrition-goals-eat-this-much\">Best app for fitness and nutrition goals: Eat This Much </h2><div>\n    <p><img src=\"https://lifehacker.com/imagery/articles/01K5ENZY2QS3V48SX95J2FN89P/images-4.fill.size_2000x1117.v1758218648.png\" alt=\"Eat This Much in iOS\" srcset=\"https://lifehacker.com/imagery/articles/01K5ENZY2QS3V48SX95J2FN89P/images-4.fill.size_800x447.v1758218648.png 800w, https://lifehacker.com/imagery/articles/01K5ENZY2QS3V48SX95J2FN89P/images-4.fill.size_1400x782.v1758218648.png 1400w, https://lifehacker.com/imagery/articles/01K5ENZY2QS3V48SX95J2FN89P/images-4.fill.size_2000x1117.v1758218648.png 2000w\" />\n            </p>\n            <p><span></span>\n                                        <span>Credit: Lindsey Ellefson/Eat This Much</span>\n                    </p>\n    </div>\n<p><a href=\"https://zdcs.link/9wjZYR?pageview_type=Standard&template=Explainers&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=Eat%20This%20Much&short_url=9wjZYR&u=https%3A%2F%2Flifehacker.com%2Fbest-meal-planning-apps&event_label=Eat%20This%20Much\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"open in a new window\">Eat This Much</a> is really ideal for anyone with specific nutrition and fitness goals. It puts together plans based not only on your budget and personal preferences, but your nutritional plans, as well. You're prompted to enter in how many calories you'd like to eat in a day, as well as how many grams of protein and other nutrients you want to hit. It even doubles as a calorie tracker and comes with a database of nutritional information about restaurant and packaged food. If you're meal planning and prepping for fitness or health goals, this could be the one for you to really focus in on. (Relatedly, if you're in the market for a comprehensive calorie and nutrient tracker, I am a huge fan of <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/tech/lifesum-health-app-review\" target=\"_blank\">Lifesum</a>.)</p><p>Money comes into play if you want more features. For $8.99 per month, you can create meal plans for a week, used advanced search features, view your past meals, and generate reports on your eating habits, to name a few. A bump up to $59 per month unlocks bulk meal plans for over a week in advance, macro tracking, and a recipe database, among other things. That's not exactly a small cost, but if you're serious about meal prepping, give it a look.</p><h2 id=\"best-app-for-when-youre-busy-mealime\">Best app for when you're busy: Mealime </h2><div>\n    <p><img src=\"https://lifehacker.com/imagery/articles/01K5ENZY2QS3V48SX95J2FN89P/images-5.fill.size_2000x1133.v1758218648.png\" alt=\"Mealime in iOS\" srcset=\"https://lifehacker.com/imagery/articles/01K5ENZY2QS3V48SX95J2FN89P/images-5.fill.size_800x453.v1758218648.png 800w, https://lifehacker.com/imagery/articles/01K5ENZY2QS3V48SX95J2FN89P/images-5.fill.size_1400x793.v1758218648.png 1400w, https://lifehacker.com/imagery/articles/01K5ENZY2QS3V48SX95J2FN89P/images-5.fill.size_2000x1133.v1758218648.png 2000w\" />\n            </p>\n            <p><span></span>\n                                        <span>Credit: Mealime/Lindsey Ellefson</span>\n                    </p>\n    </div>\n<p><a href=\"https://zdcs.link/a5X02j?pageview_type=Standard&template=Explainers&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=Mealime&short_url=a5X02j&u=https%3A%2F%2Flifehacker.com%2Fbest-meal-planning-apps&event_label=Mealime\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"open in a new window\">Mealime</a> is widely recommended in forums for meal planners and caters to busier people because it's full of recipes that can be made in under half an hour. You can filter recipes by dietary restrictions or preferences, generate a grocery list, and get on with your day. It's a little bare-bones beyond that, but as a picky eater, I appreciate the ability to eliminate recipes that include the things I don't care for. If you ever catch me eating a single mushroom, call the authorities because I'm sending a distress signal.</p><div>\n            <p><span>\n                What do you think so far?\n            </span>\n        </p></div>\n<p>You'll get plenty of recipes in the free version, but you'll notice some are labeled \"Pro.\" To get those, as well as other features like the ability to add notes, you'll have to upgrade to the paid version for $2.99 per month.

    "body": "<article>\n        <hr />\n        <p><em>Did you know you can customize Google to filter out garbage? <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/tech/you-can-now-tell-google-which-websites-you-prefer-search-results\" target=\"_blank\">Take these steps</a></em><em> for better search results, including <a href=\"https://www.google.com/preferences/source?q=lifehacker.com\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"open in a new window\">adding Lifehacker as a preferred source for tech news</a></em><em>.</em></p><p>In the years since the launch of ChatGPT, AI tools have developed a bad reputation in the academic world for how easy they make it for students to cheat, passing off the work of a large language model as their own. Even if an LLM can produce writing for you that doesn't come off as unnatural and <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/how-to-tell-when-an-artificial-intelligence-is-hallucin-1850280001\" target=\"_blank\">riddled with hallucinations</a>, you'll be shortchanging yourself, because you won't actually absorb any of the material. </p><p>But that's not to say these tools serve no purpose in the academic world. If used correctly, they can actually help you study more efficiently. Here are five ways you can use AI in your schoolwork without cheating—or cheating yourself. </p>\n<h2 id=\"use-chatgpt-to-discuss-concepts\">Use ChatGPT to discuss concepts</h2><p>One study technique I've previously recommended is simply <a href=\"https://www.lifehacker.com/the-best-way-to-know-if-youre-ready-for-a-big-test-1850379720\" target=\"_blank\">having a conversation with another person who doesn’t know anything about the topic you’re studying,</a> to identify areas where your own understanding is lacking. It's a great option because it helps you make connections between concepts as you're working out how to explain them to someone else, and it boosts your confidence in the subject matter when you are able to present it as the expert. But you might not always have someone around to serve as the uninformed rube in your roleplaying, which is when ChatGPT can help you out.</p><p>When I was in grad school, I asked ChatGPT to allow me to \"teach\" it about a topic I was studying—community-based health interventions—and we “discussed” different levels of community engagement. ChatGPT actually had interesting questions that helped me think of creative solutions I could investigate in the course of my work. </p><p>As <a href=\"https://www.apa.org/monitor/2023/06/chatgpt-learning-tool\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"open in a new window\">the American Psychological Association</a> notes, going back and forth with the language model like this not only helps you think critically and creatively, it also helps you practice managing technology in our changing world—a win-win.</p><h2 id=\"use-ai-to-summarize-articles\">Use AI to summarize articles</h2><p>If you have to read a ton of articles or reports, try getting an AI tool to summarize them for you. This is great when you need to compare similarities or differences between pieces of research or get top-line bullet points to help you round out a paper. I fed ChatGPT an old article and asked for a summary and the language model took about 30 seconds to condense 61 pages into one key paragraph, highlighting the study design, the study goals, its findings, and its recommendations. This gave me a good idea of whether it was worth further study. </p><p>If you've only got a few documents to read, it's still best to do it yourself, but this trick that can come in handy if you've got a large number of them you're looking to sort through quickly. Just make sure you double-check the summary against the source document before you take anything in it as gospel. </p><p>My favorite tool for doing this is <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/tech/google-notebooklm-review?test_uuid=015ZvAUxXams0rnBpajhMg2&test_variant=A\" target=\"_blank\">Google's NotebookLM</a>. Despite my broader hesitancy about AI, I use this free software frequently because I find it's more like a personal assistant than a source of knowledge. It is similar to ChatGPT and other language models in that you can ask it questions via text-entry box, but dissimilar in that it only pulls answers from resources you've provided it. You upload PDFs, links, YouTube videos, and whatever else you want to serve as source material, then NotebookLM helps you sort through that material. </p><p>When you're using ChatGPT, it pulls answers from the entire internet, and can make serious mistakes as a result. With NotebookLM, anything it generates includes a citation you can click that reveals the exact spot it pulled the info from in your cache of resources. Instead of doing the work for you, this tool just helps you make sense of and organize all your materials.</p><h2 id=\"use-chatgpt-to-streamline-your-notes\">Use ChatGPT to streamline your notes</h2><p>If your notes are difficult to read or sort through, ChatGPT can help. In grad school, I assigned each of my classes a Google Doc and took notes in it all semester, but inevitably, each document eventually got disorganized, chaotic, and nearly impossible to navigate. As a test, I put my entire semester’s worth of notes for Research Methods into ChatGPT and asked it to pull out the most important information. Not only did it extract the nine steps of research planning and implementation and the principals of the Belmont Report (which were major parts of the midterm), but it reminded me how much of my grade was determined by each test, a fact I had apparently jotted down somewhere in that mess of words. It particularly emphasized things I had written down multiple times, creating a perfect study guide.</p><div>\n            <p><span>\n                What do you think so far?\n            </span>\n        </p></div>\n<h2 id=\"use-ai-to-create-flashcards-and-quiz-yourself\">Use AI to create flashcards and quiz yourself</h2><p>Flashcards and practice quizzes are excellent ways to study because they force you to <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/use-these-active-recall-techniques-the-next-time-you-st-1850797753\" target=\"_blank\">use active recall</a> to pull information from your memory. Making these materials yourself is smart, because even by sorting through your notes and writing down your practice questions, you're studying. But I'll be the first to admit that when I'm in charge of making my own quiz, I tend to go a little easy on myself. (When I'm both the student and the teacher, I somehow always get an A+. Funny how that works.) It's better to outsource the creation of these materials to an unbiased third party, and here's another area where AI can be helpful.</p><p>You can ask ChatGPT to make flashcards and quizzes, but its interface isn't really designed for that, so what it will spit back is an outline of what your flashcards should include based on the notes or resources you upload. From there, you can make the cards yourself, and get to studying (I recommend drilling flashcards using <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/use-the-leitner-system-to-study-more-effectively-1850786716\" target=\"_blank\">the Leitner system</a>, which is better for helping you retain information over the long-term). You can also ask ChatGPT to quiz you, but you have to be specific with your instructions: Ask ChatGPT to quiz you one question at a time, and to not move on to a new question until you've answered the previous one correctly. </p><p>But again, here's where <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/tech/googles-notebooklm-introduces-quizzes-flashcards-tools\" target=\"_blank\">I recommend NotebookLM</a>. It has built-in flashcard and quiz features that are much more interactive and easy to use. You can click a button to generate a multiple-choice quiz or flashcard deck based on the materials you uploaded. The quizzes and cards it creates are clickable, like a quiz you would take in an online class, and are based only on what you upload.</p><h2 id=\"use-ai-to-outline-essays-and-suggest-sources\">Use AI to outline essays and suggest sources</h2><p>You definitely don't want ChatGPT or similar language models to \"write\" your whole essay—more than cheating yourself out of the learning experience, consider the fact that your teacher may run your assignment <a href=\"https://www.zerogpt.com/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"open in a new window\">through a tool like ZeroGPT</a> to get a report on how much of it was likely written by AI, which probably won't do wonders for your grade.</p><p>Instead, you can use AI tools to help you plan and organize your essays. I've already assembled a <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/tech/best-ai-tools-to-help-you-write-an-essay\" target=\"_blank\">list of the best AI essay-helping tools</a>, but here's the gist: You can ask ChatGPT to help you brainstorm a topic or create an essay outline. You can also ask for suggestions for sources you can then research and add into your work that you wouldn't have considered otherwise. </p><p>Two notes of caution: ChatGPT is sometimes known to make up citations, inventing a convincing article title and attributing it to a well-known source. This is why you don't want to rely on it to fully do the work for you, whether writing or research—just use it to source suggestions that you can hunt down and evaluate on your own. It won't take long to realize a source you've been given just doesn't exist. </p><p>Likewise, when ChatGPT gives you a link to a source, it adds a little code at the end of the URL that <em>says </em>\"/?utm_source=chatgpt.com.\" Even if you're being as ethical as possible and clicking every link to read the material fully and consider its merits, it's a very bad look to have a bibliography full of links that make it clear you used ChatGPT for your research—a reader might even assume you had the AI write everything for you. So before turning in work, I recommend searching your documents for mentions of \"chatgpt,\" and deleting that sneaky bit of code from any URL where you find it. Snip out everything from the question mark onward and link will still work, but won't make you look like you're doing something untoward. </p>\n            </article>"

/><p>Diversifying your studying techniques is a great way to stay more engaged as you learn new information, but know this: The classic methods are classic for a reason. Take flashcards, for instance. You've certainly used them in the past, but you may not have been using them in a way that maximized their benefits. </p><p>Behold the Leitner system, which provides more structure to the tried-and-true practice of studying with flashcards and might be the jumpstart your studying needs. This memory-enhancing method is best suited for when you have a substantial amount of time to learn your material, so avoid it for cramming. Instead, get going with it as soon as a semester or new chapter starts. </p><div>\n        <p><img src=\"https://lifehacker.com/images/short-lifehacker-logo.jpg\" alt=\"Lifehacker Logo\" /></p><div>\n            <p><span>You May Also Like</span></p>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n<h2 id=\"what-is-the-leitner-system-for-studying\">What is the Leitner system for studying?</h2><p>This system was devised by science writer Sebastian Leitner in 1972, which is why he gets the honor of having it named for him. (It’s from his book <a href=\"https://zdcs.link/6gNdk?pageview_type=Standard&template=Explainers&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=How%20to%20Learn%20to%20Learn&short_url=6gNdk&u=https%3A%2F%2Flifehacker.com%2Fleitner-system-flashcard-studying&event_label=How%20to%20Learn%20to%20Learn\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"open in a new window\"><em>How to Learn to Learn</em></a>, but while old copies retail for about $4, they're only available in German, so just trust me on this one.) </p><p>For the first few decades of its use, it relied solely on on physical tools: <a href=\"https://zdcs.link/2bLvY?pageview_type=Standard&template=Explainers&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=flashcards&short_url=2bLvY&u=https%3A%2F%2Flifehacker.com%2Fleitner-system-flashcard-studying&event_label=flashcards\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"open in a new window\">flashcards</a> and <a href=\"https://zdcs.link/71dP4?pageview_type=Standard&template=Explainers&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=boxes&short_url=71dP4&u=https%3A%2F%2Flifehacker.com%2Fleitner-system-flashcard-studying&event_label=boxes\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"open in a new window\">boxes</a>. (You’ll also need a pen or pencil to make the flashcards.) Writing out your flashcards by hand is generally a good idea, as <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/why-you-should-stop-bringing-your-laptop-to-class-1850441339\" target=\"_blank\">handwriting something helps stick it into your memory</a>, but these days, you have other, more modern options for your Leitner sessions. We'll get to those, too. </p><p>At its core, this is a version of <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/family/when-to-study-with-blocked-practice-and-when-not-to\" target=\"_blank\">spaced repetition</a>, an <a href=\"https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/2372732215624708\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"open in a new window\">evidence-based technique</a> that helps learners absorb numerous pieces of information and store them in their memory. The system is best used when you have ample time but have to learn a <em>lot </em>of concepts, phrases, or ideas—so use it for an entire course or a really hefty chapter instead of a section or topic that only includes a few new things to learn. Now let's get into what it is and how to execute it.</p><h2 id=\"how-to-use-the-leitner-system\">How to use the Leitner system</h2><p>Let's assume for a moment you're doing this the old-school way—relying on index cards and a pen. The first thing you’re going to do is make your flashcards. Don’t worry about the other steps involving the boxes just yet. Make the flashcards as you normally would by including vocabulary words, new concepts, phrases, important dates, and anything else you need to know. It helps to first use a reading comprehension technique to go through the chapter or subject at hand, so <a href=\"https://www.lifehacker.com/use-the-sq3r-method-to-study-more-effectively-1850780175\" target=\"_blank\">try the SQ3R method</a>, which has you identify questions you have about the material before you start reading, then has you write down the answers to those questions as you find them, plus anything else you learn. You base those questions on subheadings, graphs, tables, summaries, and other key parts of the chapter, but you can later base your flashcards on those same pieces of information, plus the answers you find. Be thorough and include concepts and words you already feel confident you know, even if that seems silly. It’s all part of the Leitner method and will come in handy.</p><p>Once you have a comprehensive flashcard deck, it’s time to use the method. You’ll need five boxes (or envelopes or even labeled binder clips, as long as it’s something that can hold big stacks of cards). You should label them on a timeline, ideally by how long you have to grasp the information. If you have a big midterm in two months, for instance, label Box 1 “daily,” Box 2 “every other day,” Box 3 “weekly,” Box 4 “biweekly,” and Box 5 “monthly.”</p><p>Now, do a round of flashcards. Every card you get right, move to Box 2. Every card you get wrong, keep in Box 1. You see where this is going, but I'll spell it out: Box 1 is a daily review, so you do those flashcards every day, but if you start this activity on a Monday and your Box 2 is designated for every-other-day study, you won’t return to that one until Wednesday. If you answer cards from Box 2 correctly, they’ll go to Box 3, which in this example is your “weekly” box. If you answer any cards in Box 2 incorrectly, you move those back to Box 1, where you’ll study them every day until you get them right.</p><p>In short, when you answer a card right, it moves forward into a box that will have you reviewing it less frequently. When you answer a card wrong, it moves backward into a box that will have you reviewing it <em>more </em>frequently. Eventually, you’ll have cards all the way down in Box 5. Those will be the cards containing information you have effectively stored in your memory and really grasp, so you don’t need to go over them as often. Cards in the lower-numbered boxes contain information you’re not retaining as well and should go over more.</p><h2 id=\"modifications-and-things-to-keep-in-mind-about-the-leitner-system\">Modifications and things to keep in mind about the Leitner system</h2><p>How you use the system will depend on how much time you have to study, as well as how much you have to learn. For instance, if you have just a few concepts you want to drill or you have only two weeks until a big test, you might use three boxes to designated daily, every-other-day, and weekly study. You also have some wiggle room when it comes to incorrect answers. The most faithful adherence to the method would have you moving any incorrect cards all the way back to Box 1 no matter what box it had previously made its way to, for instance, but you can make a judgement call on whether getting it wrong one time means you need to study it every day or whether you think it should only be demoted one box. Personally, I don't see the harm in demoting it all the way to Box 1; if you got it wrong due to a momentary brain fart, it'll make its way back up to the higher numbers easily enough in time; if you got it wrong because the information truly slipped out of your memory, it deserves to get some daily attention until you know it well enough to advance it.</p><div>\n            <p><span>\n                What do you think so far?\n            </span>\n        </p></div>\n<p>You also need to be strategic when you’re studying on a day that involves multiple boxes. If you start on a Monday and use a daily, every-other-day, and weekly setup for your first three boxes, for instance, Friday is going to be pretty big for you. Start with whatever the highest box of the day is, then move backward. By doing this, you’ll get to study any you got wrong and moved backward twice, but won’t have to study any you got right and moved forward twice. Plus, it’ll be a little confidence boost to start on the harder ones and get some right, moving them to a box you won’t have to look at for a while.</p><p>The goal here is to really hammer the cards that contain information that isn’t sticking for you without bogging yourself down studying things you already know. As more cards move into the higher-numbered boxes, add information from new chapters so your deck is a comprehensive overview of everything you’ll need to know for a cumulative test or, ideally, long-term in the real-world application of the information. </p><h2 id=\"apps-can-make-this-easier\">Apps can make this easier</h2><p>Yes, the classic approach to this involves handwriting cards and physically moving them around in boxes or envelopes and while that can be beneficial in its own way, the process is also laborious, time-consuming, and a little hard to manage. Where will you store all those flashcards? Are you going to bring them around to study on the go? The answer is probably no, which means you may find yourself skipping some days if it's not feasible to haul around a stack of cards—and that defeats the purpose of the system entirely. </p><p>That's where apps come in. Always be wary when using your phone to study, since it only takes a few taps of your finger to get distracted by non-educational messages and apps, but honestly, flashcard apps make all of this a lot easier if you can exercise the self-restraint necessary to use them. </p><p>Flashcards in any form are useful, as they force you to <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/use-these-active-recall-techniques-the-next-time-you-st-1850797753\" target=\"_blank\">engage in active recall</a> and pull the answers from your memory, so any flashcard app you download is better than nothing. Be advised, though, that not all of them follow the Leitner method. For Leitner-specific flashcard drills, I recommend <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/tech/brainscape-flashcard-app-review\" target=\"_blank\">Brainscape</a> (my personal favorite), <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/tech/cram-flashcard-app-review\" target=\"_blank\">Cram</a>, and <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/tech/flashcard-lab-app-review\" target=\"_blank\">Flashcard Lab</a>. You can read my full reviews of them through those links, but generally, Brainscape is a sleek and well-produced app that comes with a ton of pre-made decks and simple options for making your own, Cram is much more basic but easy to use, and Flashcard Lab creates flashcards out of your own spreadsheets so the production part is almost too easy. All of them let you indicate whether you got a flashcard answer right or wrong, then move it around in your schedule so you see it more or less frequently. </p><p>Outsourcing the creation and sorting of the cards to tech leaves more time for studying and streamlines the whole process, making you more likely to stick to your Leitner practice. </p>\n            </article>\n    </div>\n<div>\n    <div>\n        <p><span>The Daily Newsletter</span>\n            <span>Ready to do everything better?</span>\n        </p>\n        <p><img src=\"https://lifehacker.com/images/team/Jordan.png\" alt=\"Jordan Calhoun portrait\" />\n            <span>Jordan Calhoun\n            </span>\n            <span>Editor in chief</span>\n        </p>\n        <p><span><span>Get daily tips, tricks, <span>and tech guides</span></span> <span>from Jordan and the team.</span></span>\n    </p></div>\n    <div>\n        <p><span>The Daily Newsletter</span>\n            <span><span>Ready to do everything better?</span> <span>Get daily tips, tricks, <span>and tech guides</span></span> <span>from Jordan and the team.</span></span>\n        </p>\n    </div>\n</div>\n    </div>\n            <div>\n                <p><span>\n                        Keep Scrolling for Next Article\n                    </span>\n                </p>\n            </div>\n        </div>\n    </div>"

You can even see previous historic highs and lows and try to map out the best time to strike. </p><h2 id=\"the-best-price-tracker-for-most-online-retailers-and-to-compare-prices-honey\">The best price tracker for most online retailers and to compare prices: Honey</h2><div>\n    <p><img src=\"https://lifehacker.com/imagery/articles/01HF2GY1EGKVBM56BVJC4RJMWT/images-10.fill.size_2000x890.v1738779720.png\" alt=\"Honey price history on website\" srcset=\"https://lifehacker.com/imagery/articles/01HF2GY1EGKVBM56BVJC4RJMWT/images-10.fill.size_800x356.v1738779720.png 800w, https://lifehacker.com/imagery/articles/01HF2GY1EGKVBM56BVJC4RJMWT/images-10.fill.size_1400x623.v1738779720.png 1400w, https://lifehacker.com/imagery/articles/01HF2GY1EGKVBM56BVJC4RJMWT/images-10.fill.size_2000x890.v1738779720.png 2000w\" />\n            </p>\n            <p><span></span>\n                                        <span>Credit: Honey.com</span>\n                    </p>\n    </div>\n<p>You've probably already heard of the \"<a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/tech/honey-influencer-scam-explained\" target=\"_blank\">Honey influencer scam</a>\" that blew up in December of 2024. Essentially, Honey hijacked affiliate links from influencers who were sponsoring them. Also, in many instances, it deliberately chose not to give the best coupons to users who used the extension (going completely against its business model). Honey is not alone in this behavior. Many coupon aggregator companies hijack affiliate links; Honey just happens to be in the spotlight because it's the biggest one. Use your own judgment if you choose to use any of its services. </p><p>The bad news for those looking for a price-tracking tool that can be used for most online retailers is that Honey is the only option. The good news is that <a href=\"https://www.joinhoney.com/explore\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"open in a new window\">Honey's price-tracking tool</a> can't scam you or give you subpar coupons. The <a href=\"https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/honey-automatic-coupons-r/bmnlcjabgnpnenekpadlanbbkooimhnj?hl=en-GB\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"open in a new window\">Honey browser extension</a> compares prices from a whole bunch of retailers, not just Amazon. You can create a Droplist, which notifies you if the prices drop for an item on your list if you’re willing to wait for a deal. Here is <a href=\"https://www.lifehacker.com/everything-you-should-do-now-if-you-shop-on-black-frida-1850945998#:~:text=Use%20the%20tools%20available%20to%20you\" target=\"_blank\">what creating a Droplist can do for you</a>:</p><blockquote><p>First, it’ll keep the items you want to keep tabs on organized and easily accessible. Second, it’ll track the prices of those products and alert you when they go on sale at any major retailer. You can see how much those prices cost leading up to the sale to see if they are, in fact, good deals or a trick from retailers to take advantage of you, and even compare them with other major retailers to see who has the best deal. You can see how to set up your droplist here.﻿</p></blockquote><p>As long as you don't buy the products using a Honey link, you won't be giving money to the service. Until there's a better alternative, Honey is the only option that can instantly pull up price histories and track prices for multiple retailers with a browser extension (for now).</p><h2 id=\"the-best-tool-to-compare-prices-capital-one-shopping\">The best tool to compare prices: Capital One Shopping</h2><div>\n    <p><img src=\"https://lifehacker.com/imagery/articles/01HF2GY1EGKVBM56BVJC4RJMWT/images-17.fill.size_668x750.v1738779966.png\" alt=\"Screenshot from Amazon using the Capital One Shopping browser extension\" srcset=\"https://lifehacker.com/imagery/articles/01HF2GY1EGKVBM56BVJC4RJMWT/images-17.fill.size_800x898.v1738779966.png 800w, https://lifehacker.com/imagery/articles/01HF2GY1EGKVBM56BVJC4RJMWT/images-17.fill.size_1400x1572.v1738779966.png 1400w, https://lifehacker.com/imagery/articles/01HF2GY1EGKVBM56BVJC4RJMWT/images-17.fill.size_2000x2245.v1738779966.png 2000w\" />\n            </p>\n            <p><span></span>\n                                        <span>Credit: Amazon.com</span>\n                    </p>\n    </div>\n<p><a href=\"https://capitaloneshopping.com/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"open in a new window\">Capital One Shopping</a>, previously known as Wikibuy, compares prices from other sellers when you shop on Amazon.

If you choose to use the <a href=\"https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/capital-one-shopping-add/nenlahapcbofgnanklpelkaejcehkggg\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"open in a new window\">browser extension</a>, it will notify you if a product you are looking at is cheaper somewhere else, and offer a summary of pricing history, estimated delivery time, and total price, including tax and shipping. If you can apply a coupon, it’ll add that as well. When the price drops for a product you’ve viewed, Capital One Shopping will notify you. When you shop, you can earn credits for your purchases at some websites, like Walmart and eBay, that Capital One Shopping has partnered with. You can trade that credit for gift cards or put it toward purchases through Capital One Shopping’s site.</p><p>The extension is available for Chrome, Firefox, Edge, and Safari, and an iOS app allows you to scan barcodes and search products to do price comparisons from your phone.</p><div>\n            <p><span>\n                What do you think so far?\n            </span>\n        </p></div>\n<h2 id=\"the-best-price-tracker-tool-for-gamers-cheapshark\">The best price tracker tool for gamers: CheapShark</h2><div>\n    <p><img src=\"https://lifehacker.com/imagery/articles/01HF2GY1EGKVBM56BVJC4RJMWT/images-12.fill.size_2000x759.v1738779720.png\" alt=\"Three stores on the CheapShark website showing you discounts\" srcset=\"https://lifehacker.com/imagery/articles/01HF2GY1EGKVBM56BVJC4RJMWT/images-12.fill.size_800x304.v1738779720.png 800w, https://lifehacker.com/imagery/articles/01HF2GY1EGKVBM56BVJC4RJMWT/images-12.fill.size_1400x531.v1738779720.png 1400w, https://lifehacker.com/imagery/articles/01HF2GY1EGKVBM56BVJC4RJMWT/images-12.fill.size_2000x759.v1738779720.png 2000w\" />\n            </p>\n            <p><span></span>\n                                        <span>Credit: CheapShark.com</span>\n                    </p>\n    </div>\n<p>While most of the others in the roundup focus on products like electronics, apparel, household goods, and appliances, <a href=\"https://www.cheapshark.com/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"open in a new window\">CheapShark</a> is a great option for those looking to save money on video games. CheapShark combines all of the great places to get discounts on games in one place, one easily searchable directory and database of current prices from sites including Steam, GoG, Green Man Gaming, GameStop, Amazon, and more. Of course, it’s limited to video games, but you can search a game name not just to see how much it’ll cost you to buy, but even if you can buy it at all—and which retailer has it available. If you want, you can even filter by games currently on sale at their selected stores.</p><p>When you search for a specific game, CheapShark tells you what the cheapest-ever price was, when it hit that price, and gives you the choice to either go ahead and buy it from your choice of retailer or to sign up for a price notification if it drops again.</p><h2 id=\"honorable-mentions\">Honorable mentions</h2><h3>Keepa: Practical price-tracking tool for Amazon and eBay</h3><div>\n    <p><img src=\"https://lifehacker.com/imagery/articles/01HF2GY1EGKVBM56BVJC4RJMWT/images-13.fill.size_2000x659.v1738779720.png\" alt=\"Price history of the AirPods on Amazon\" srcset=\"https://lifehacker.com/imagery/articles/01HF2GY1EGKVBM56BVJC4RJMWT/images-13.fill.size_800x264.v1738779720.png 800w, https://lifehacker.com/imagery/articles/01HF2GY1EGKVBM56BVJC4RJMWT/images-13.fill.size_1400x462.v1738779720.png 1400w, https://lifehacker.com/imagery/articles/01HF2GY1EGKVBM56BVJC4RJMWT/images-13.fill.size_2000x659.v1738779720.png 2000w\" />\n            </p>\n            <p><span></span>\n                                        <span>Credit: Amazon.com using the Keepa browser extension</span>\n                    </p>\n    </div>\n<p><a href=\"https://keepa.com/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"open in a new window\">Keepa</a> works very similarly to Camelcamelcamel, but instead of clicking on the extension to see the price history, it'll be automatically displayed below the image of the product. This helps if clicking on the extension or installing is one click too much for you. Keepa also lets you track specific products and sends you notifications when they go below a specific price that you set. It also works on eBay. You can download the extension for Firefox, Chrome, Opera, Edge, and Safari. </p><h3>SlickDeals: Great for finding deals and checking prices</h3><p><a href=\"https://slickdeals.net/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"open in a new window\">SlickDeals</a> is known for bringing you up-to-the-minute discounts, coupons, and other deals from around the web, but its web-based price tracker is also great for watching prices on just about any item on Amazon and on a ton of other popular shopping sites, like Newegg, Gamestop, Chewy, Home Depot, and others.</p><div>\n    <p><img src=\"https://lifehacker.com/imagery/articles/01HF2GY1EGKVBM56BVJC4RJMWT/images-4.fill.size_2000x1124.v1699834131.png\" alt=\"Price history from SlickDeals for Nintendo Switch OLED\" srcset=\"https://lifehacker.com/imagery/articles/01HF2GY1EGKVBM56BVJC4RJMWT/images-4.fill.size_800x450.v1699834131.png 800w, https://lifehacker.com/imagery/articles/01HF2GY1EGKVBM56BVJC4RJMWT/images-4.fill.size_1400x787.v1699834131.png 1400w, https://lifehacker.com/imagery/articles/01HF2GY1EGKVBM56BVJC4RJMWT/images-4.fill.size_2000x1124.v1699834131.png 2000w\" />\n            </p>\n            <p><span></span>\n                                        <span>Credit: SlickDeals</span>\n                    </p>\n    </div>\n<p>The service doesn’t give you a detailed price history like some of the others in the roundup—it only shows a “deal history” under the “price intelligence” section for a few popular products. However, it will track the price of your item from when you create an alert and send you an email if the price drops below a threshold that you set. You can also return to the price tracker at any time, log in to your account, and see all of your tracked items on the same screen.</p><hr /><div>\n            <div>\n                    <p><span>Our Best Editor-Vetted Tech Deals Right Now</span></p>\n                </div>\n            <p><span>Deals are selected by our commerce team</span>\n                            </p>\n        </div>\n            </article>\n    </div>\n<div>\n    <div>\n        <p><span>The Daily Newsletter</span>\n            <span>Ready to do everything better?</span>\n        </p>\n        <p><img src=\"https://lifehacker.com/images/team/Jordan.png\" alt=\"Jordan Calhoun portrait\" />\n            <span>Jordan Calhoun\n            </span>\n            <span>Editor in chief</span>\n        </p>\n        <p><span><span>Get daily tips, tricks, <span>and tech guides</span></span> <span>from Jordan and the team.</span></span>\n    </p></div>\n    <div>\n        <p><span>The Daily Newsletter</span>\n            <span><span>Ready to do everything better?</span> <span>Get daily tips, tricks, <span>and tech guides</span></span> <span>from Jordan and the team.</span></span>\n        </p>\n    </div>\n</div>\n    </div>\n            <div>\n                <p><span>\n                        Keep Scrolling for Next Article\n                    </span>\n                </p>\n            </div>\n        </div>\n    </div>"

these days. It’s <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/tech/disable-gmail-automatic-gemini-ai-summaries?test_uuid=015ZvAUxXams0rnBpajhMg2&test_variant=B\" target=\"_blank\">in your Gmail</a>, it’s <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/tech/why-gemini-is-replacing-google-assistant?test_uuid=015ZvAUxXams0rnBpajhMg2&test_variant=B\" target=\"_blank\">on your phone</a>, and soon, it’ll be in your browser. While Google’s AI browser integration was already live for Google AI Pro and AI Ultra subscribers, it's now <a href=\"https://blog.google/products/chrome/new-ai-features-for-chrome/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"open in a new window\">rolling out to everyone</a>—and getting a bunch of new features, too.</p><p>If you’re suddenly seeing a new Gemini button in the top right of your Chrome browser (in the same pane as your tabs), then you’ve already been hit with the update. If not, you may need to use the three-dots button in the top right corner and select <strong>Gemini in Chrome</strong> to turn it on, assuming you want to.</p><h2 id=\"how-to-use-gemini-in-chrome\">How to use Gemini in Chrome</h2><p>When you click the Gemini button, or summon it via a keyboard shortcut (Alt + G by default), you’ll be able to try out the same features Google’s paying customers have had access to for a while. That means Gemini will be able to answer questions about the webpage you’re on, or just answer general questions unrelated to what you’re browsing. Or, if you’re in a Google app or on a Google website, it’ll be able to take some simple actions for you, like jumping you to a specific spot in a YouTube video.</p><div>\n        <p><img src=\"https://lifehacker.com/images/short-lifehacker-logo.jpg\" alt=\"Lifehacker Logo\" /></p><div>\n            <p><span>You May Also Like</span></p>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n<p>Additionally, Gemini can also now work across your tabs and compare information between them. Simply start a dialogue with Gemini by tapping the button in the top right corner, and at the bottom of the window, click “Add tab” to give Gemini another source of data to consider.</p><p>Weirdly, while these updates are already pushing live to average folks, Google says businesses will need to wait a couple of weeks, so they can get “enterprise-grade data protections and controls.”</p><p>As of now, aside from the new access, it’s not the biggest update, especially because to try it, you need to be on Windows or Mac, have your language set to English, and be in the U.S.. Google stresses that the Gemini Assistant on Android can also help you browse Chrome, and that it’s working to bring more direct Gemini in Chrome access to both its Android and iOS apps.</p><h2 id=\"more-ai-browsing-is-coming\">More AI browsing is coming</h2><p>Google says it also has big things in store for the feature, with “agentic browsing” set for the “coming months.” This will supposedly let Gemini in Chrome complete tasks, like booking a haircut for you, or ordering your groceries. Alternatively, it’ll also help you browse a bit more easily, as Google says it’s working to let you ask Gemini questions about your browser history when you want to go back to a specific page. For instance, “what was the website where I saw the walnut desk last week?” could take you back to a shopping page you only vaguely remember.</p><div>\n            <p><span>\n                What do you think so far?\n            </span>\n        </p></div>\n<p>A more powerful address bar is apparently in the works that will let you ask questions of Google’s AI model without having to navigate to it first. For now, Gemini in Chrome will start suggesting questions to ask it about whatever page you’re on, right in the address bar.</p><p>The update includes a few security updates too, although they mostly seem to work in the backend, supposedly using AI to better block scammy ads and notifications. Now that’s the type of AI integration I can support wholeheartedly.</p><h2 id=\"how-to-turn-off-gemini-in-chrome\">How to turn off Gemini in Chrome</h2><p>All that said, if you’re a bit skeptical about Gemini in Chrome, you can turn it off. Simply navigate to <strong>Settings > AI Innovations</strong>, and you’ll be able to turn off the Gemini button, as well as disable its keyboard shortcut. You can also restrict its permissions: Set everything to off, and it’ll be like it was never installed in the first place.</p>\n            </article>\n    </div>\n<div>\n    <div>\n        <p><span>The Download Newsletter</span>\n            <span>Never miss a tech story</span>\n        </p>\n        <p><img src=\"https://lifehacker.com/images/team/Jake.png\" alt=\"Jake Peterson portrait\" />\n            <span>Jake Peterson\n            </span>\n            <span>Senior tech editor</span>\n        </p>\n        <p><span>Get the latest tech news, <span></span>reviews, <span></span>and advice from Jake and the team.</span>\n    </p></div>\n    <div>\n        <p><span>The Download Newsletter</span>\n            <span><span>Never miss a tech story.</span> Get the latest tech news, <span></span>reviews, <span></span>and advice from Jake and the team.</span>\n        </p>\n    </div>\n</div>\n    </div>\n            <div>\n                <p><span>\n                        Keep Scrolling for Next Article\n                    </span>\n                </p>\n            </div>\n        </div>\n    </div>"

Contents</h2>\n    <article>\n        <hr />\n        <p>Google and Apple’s app stores both have a reputation for being pretty trustworthy these days. It’s easy to assume that if an app is in either the iPhone App Store or the Google Play Store, it’s safe to download. But a new Google crackdown this week reminds us that this isn’t so clear cut.</p><p>Yesterday, a third-party security report revealed that Google had recently removed 224 malicious apps from the Android Play Store. Dubbed “SlopAds” apps by security company Human, which discovered the apps and <a href=\"https://www.humansecurity.com/learn/blog/satori-threat-intelligence-alert-slopads-covers-fraud-with-layers-of-obfuscation/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"open in a new window\"><u>wrote the report</u></a>, these apps evaded Google’s usual security procedures and instead used a clever workaround to secretly install malware on users’ devices, even when downloaded straight from Google’s servers. </p><p>The way these apps worked was that, if you downloaded them by searching for them through the Google Play Store, they would work as advertised with no malware dragging them down. Generally, these apps were pitched as simple utilities, or attempted to pass themselves off as more popular programs like ChatGPT, to try to trick users into downloading them. Not the best tools, certainly, but if accessed directly through Google, they wouldn’t hurt you.</p><div>\n        <p><img src=\"https://lifehacker.com/images/short-lifehacker-logo.jpg\" alt=\"Lifehacker Logo\" /></p><div>\n            <p><span>You May Also Like</span></p>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n<p>But the trick is that, if you downloaded one of these apps after arriving at the Play Store via one of SlopAds ad campaigns, it would also secretly download an encrypted configuration file that, after a few post-download checks, would install malware on your device.</p><p>Once a device was infected, the app would then steal its information, and start using it to generate fake ad impressions on sites run by the scammers, maximizing profit.</p><p>It was a clever way to get around Google’s regular review process, and a good reminder that, even as major companies try to make their app stores safe to use, you should still be vigilant while browsing them.</p><h2 id=\"how-to-avoid-installing-malware-on-your-device\">How to avoid installing malware on your device</h2><p>While SlopAds has been thwarted for now, you should still take a few steps to keep your device safe while downloading new apps, especially since SlopAds <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/tech/necro-trojan-malware-has-infected-11-million-android-devices?test_uuid=015ZvAUxXams0rnBpajhMg2&test_variant=B\" target=\"_blank\"><u>isn’t alone in sneaking Malware onto the Play Store</u></a>. Here are just a few ways to protect your device while browsing for new apps.</p><h3>Download your apps directly from the Play Store</h3><p>Android is different from iOS in that it allows you to sideload apps onto your device. This can be convenient when working with smaller developers, who might not have the resources to get their programs on the Play Store. But downloading an app that hasn’t been verified by Google opens you up to extra risk. Always ensure you trust a developer and the specific APK file you’re using before sideloading an app. Google is currently working to <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/tech/android-is-making-it-more-difficult-to-sideload-apps\" target=\"_blank\"><u>block sideloading</u></a> unless a developer is verified (which has been controversial, despite the extra security it gives you), although these changes aren’t set to hit most of the world until 2027.</p><div>\n            <p><span>\n                What do you think so far?\n            </span>\n        </p></div>\n<h3>Find apps through the Play Store</h3><p>As SlopAds proves, navigating to an app through an outside source can flag it to download extra files to your device that you won’t get if you find the app through the Play Store’s own search functionality. Always be cautious about links to apps that you find on suspicious websites, and especially in ads. Using the Play Store to discover new apps instead could save you some headaches down the line, especially as Google’s search is less likely to send you to suspicious apps than it is popular apps that have been verified as safe by other users.</p><h3>Check user reviews and permissions</h3><p>If you scroll down before downloading an app through the Play Store, you’ll see which permissions an app needs to do its work on your phone, and you’ll also be able to read user reviews. This can be handy if there are known issues with an app, or the requested permissions seem to be a bit too generous for what the app claims to do. However, this isn’t a catch-all solution—SlopAds did its malicious behavior in the background without needing any sort of permissions, and depending on where a user downloaded a SlopAd app from, it might not have even installed malware on their device. It’s possible apps with good reviews could still have harmful software included on the sly.</p><h3>Turn on Google Play Protect</h3><p>While SlopAds was able to bypass Google Play Protect, it’s still a good idea to turn it on if it isn’t enabled on your device already. This will scan an app for known malware before downloading it, giving you an extra layer of protection. It will also periodically scan apps already installed on your device. To ensure it’s turned on, open the Play Store, click your profile icon in the top right corner, and navigate to <strong>Play Protect > Settings</strong>. To scan sideloaded apps, you can also turn on the <strong>Improve harmful app detection</strong> setting, which is in the same spot.</p><h3>Run a Google Security Checkup</h3><p>Finally, you can <a href=\"http://myaccount.google.com/security-checkup\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"open in a new window\"><u>run a Google Security Checkup</u></a> on your device via a web browser. This will help you tighten your online security, encouraging you to take security steps like adding a recovery email or phone number to your Google account. It’ll also list recent security activity, and will generally ensure that, even if a malicious app steals your data, you’ll be able to lock it out of your account with the least issue possible.</p>\n            </article>\n    </div>\n<div>\n    <div>\n        <p><span>The Download Newsletter</span>\n            <span>Never miss a tech story</span>\n        </p>\n        <p><img src=\"https://lifehacker.com/images/team/Jake.png\" alt=\"Jake Peterson portrait\" />\n            <span>Jake Peterson\n            </span>\n            <span>Senior tech editor</span>\n        </p>\n        <p><span>Get the latest tech news, <span></span>reviews, <span></span>and advice from Jake and the team.</span>\n    </p></div>\n    <div>\n        <p><span>The Download Newsletter</span>\n            <span><span>Never miss a tech story.</span> Get the latest tech news, <span></span>reviews, <span></span>and advice from Jake and the team.</span>\n        </p>\n    </div>\n</div>\n    </div>\n            <div>\n                <p><span>\n                        Keep Scrolling for Next Article\n                    </span>\n                </p>\n            </div>\n        </div>\n    </div>"
