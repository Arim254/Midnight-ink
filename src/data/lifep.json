source</a></em><em>.</em></p><hr /><p>Earlier this month, we saw a new running world record—more specifically, running backwards. In heels. Christian Roberto López Rodríguez <a href=\"https://www.guinnessworldrecords.com/news/2025/9/serial-speedster-claims-another-running-record-with-backwards-sprint-in-high-heels\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"open in a new window\">claimed the fastest</a> 100m backwards<em> in high heels</em> with an impressive time of 16.55 seconds.</p><p>I may not be setting that sort of record, but I do see running backwards crop up <a href=\"https://www.therunningweek.com/post/should-you-start-running-backwards-heres-what-science-says\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"open in a new window\">time</a> and <a href=\"https://marathonhandbook.com/retro-running-backwards/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"open in a new window\">time again</a> as a trendy idea for the average runner. Sometimes called \"reverse running,\" it's exactly what it sounds like: runners literally turning around and jogging backwards. But does running backwards genuinely help improve forward running performance, or is it simply another fitness fad destined to fade?</p><div>\n        <p><img src=\"https://lifehacker.com/images/short-lifehacker-logo.jpg\" alt=\"Lifehacker Logo\" /></p><div>\n            <p><span>You May Also Like</span></p>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n<h2 id=\"does-running-backwards-actually-help\">Does running backwards actually help?</h2><p>From a physiological perspective, backwards running fundamentally alters how your body moves and which muscles bear the workload. Physiotherapist <a href=\"https://www.saunny.com/pages/about-us\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"open in a new window\">Alex Lee</a> explains the dramatic shift that occurs when you reverse direction: \"Your quadriceps do the majority of the job of slowing your body down. Your hamstrings work differently too because they aren't pushing you forwards. This variation alleviates stress from the knee joint, specifically the ACL.\" He further explains how running backwards also causes your ankles to \"move with greater dorsiflexion,\" which trains balance and body awareness, known as <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/you-can-actually-do-something-about-how-clumsy-you-are-1848970465\" target=\"_blank\">proprioception</a>.</p><p>As any runner can attest, going easy on the knees is a major draw. Lee notes additional advantages when he trains athletes, explaining how he incorporates running backwards to \"shield their knees, develop leg strength, and enhance coordination.\" </p><h2 id=\"supplemental-not-essential\">Supplemental, not essential</h2><p>While the biomechanical benefits are real, running coach <a href=\"https://www.runbaldwin.com/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"open in a new window\">Will Baldwin</a> offers a more measured approach to backwards running's place in training programs. \"I think the biggest benefit from running backwards is it helps you engage some of your posterior chain and muscles that aren't typically recruited in forward running, like your glutes, some hamstring, and it helps with your pushback a little bit,\" Baldwin explains.</p><p>However, he's quick to temper expectations about performance gains: \"I don't think it makes runners faster. It's probably a good supplemental tool. I don't even think it's a necessity in training, but it definitely can wake some muscles up and can be a fun, different type of coordination skill to work on that's still similar to running.\"</p><p>Baldwin's perspective highlights a crucial consideration in training philosophy—the principle of <em>specificity</em>. \"The law of specificity applies here. If we want to get better at a skill, we need to practice that skill in the specific way we want to compete. We've got to be careful with how much time we waste, especially for busy people. That could be time better spent doing core work or some specific strength training.\"</p><p>For most recreational runners juggling work, family, and training, Baldwin suggests backwards running falls into the \"nice to have\" rather than \"must have\" category: \"You'd really have to be someone with a lot of extra time to experiment and play around with things like this.\"</p><h2 id=\"getting-started-safely\">Getting started safely</h2><p>Running backwards is awkward at best, and genuinely risky at worst. You could fall, and it's easy to twist an ankle or pull something because you can't see where you're landing. If you'd like to experiment with backwards running, start conservatively. Baldwin suggests beginning with walking: \"If someone wanted to try it, I'd start with <em>walking</em> backwards. Especially uphill, on a treadmill or outside, it can really engage, work, and stretch certain muscles. It can be a fun skill to play with, but I'd definitely start with walking before running backwards.\"</p><div>\n            <p><span>\n                What do you think so far?\n            </span>\n        </p></div>\n<p>This gradual approach allows your body to adapt to the different movement patterns while minimizing injury risk. Treadmills provide an ideal controlled environment for initial backwards movement practice, eliminating the hazard of unseen obstacles.</p><p>The bigger concerns, according to Baldwin, relate to training efficiency: \"Wasted time and lack of specificity are probably the bigger ones, but again, not major.\" For time-strapped runners, the opportunity cost of backwards running sessions might outweigh the supplemental benefits.</p><h2 id=\"the-bottom-line\">The bottom line</h2><p>Backwards running offers legitimate benefits—improved proprioception, reduced knee stress, enhanced muscle activation patterns, and increased coordination. </p><p>However, for the average recreational runner seeking to improve their forward running times, backwards running is more of a fun bonus activity, rather than a true game-changer. The time investment might be better allocated to proven <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/health/how-to-do-fartlek-runs\" target=\"_blank\">training methods</a> like tempo runs, interval training, strength work, or simply building up more forward-running mileage.</p><p>Backwards running sits comfortably in the category of \"helpful but not essential\" training methods. It's not the revolutionary breakthrough <a href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/@prolongevityfitness/video/6857672364050713861\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"open in a new window\">some social media posts</a> might suggest, but it's also not entirely without merit. Like many <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/health/is-exercising-on-all-fours-really-better\" target=\"_blank\">fitness trends</a>, the truth lies somewhere between.</p><p>So, for runners with specific needs—such as rehabilitation from knee injuries, athletes requiring enhanced proprioception, or those simply seeking variety in their training routine—backwards running can serve a valuable purpose. For everyone else, it remains an interesting option worth considering if time and safety conditions permit, but not a priority that should displace more fundamental aspects of training.</p>\n            </article>\n    </div>\n<div>\n    <div>\n        <p><span>The Daily Newsletter</span>\n            <span>Ready to do everything better?</span>\n        </p>\n        <p><img src=\"https://lifehacker.com/images/team/Jordan.png\" alt=\"Jordan Calhoun portrait\" />\n            <span>Jordan Calhoun\n            </span>\n            <span>Editor in chief</span>\n        </p>\n        <p><span><span>Get daily tips, tricks, <span>and tech guides</span></span> <span>from Jordan and the team.</span></span>\n    </p></div>\n    <div>\n        <p><span>The Daily Newsletter</span>\n            <span><span>Ready to do everything better?</span> <span>Get daily tips, tricks, <span>and tech guides</span></span> <span>from Jordan and the team.</span></span>\n        </p>\n    </div>\n</div>\n    </div>\n            <div>\n                <p><span>\n                        Keep Scrolling for Next Article\n                    </span>\n                </p>\n            </div>\n        </div>\n    </div>"

Then President-elect Trump had already assured TikTok that his incoming administration would not enforce the ban, as did the outgoing President Biden. As such, once Trump was sworn in, he signed an executive order kicking the TikTok ban down the road. Trump continued to delay enforcing the ban, which, <a href=\"https://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/columnist/2025/06/25/trump-tiktok-ban-delay-extended/84323075007/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"open in a new window\">while legally dubious</a>, allowed the app to continue operating as usual. </p><div>\n        <p><img src=\"https://lifehacker.com/images/short-lifehacker-logo.jpg\" alt=\"Lifehacker Logo\" /></p><div>\n            <p><span>You May Also Like</span></p>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n<p>It seems, however, this wild ride is coming to a close. On Thursday, Trump <a href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/09/saving-tiktok-while-protecting-national-security/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"open in a new window\">signed an executive order</a> that sets the stage for a U.S.-majority stake in TikTok. <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2025/09/25/trump-approves-tiktok-deal-through-executive-order.html\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"open in a new window\">Nothing is set in stone</a>, but American companies like Oracle, as well as individuals like Larry Ellison (Oracle co-founder) and Rupert Murdoch could be among the newest owners of the app. Curiously, a non-American company, the Abu Dhabi-based MGX investment fund, would also be involved. This joint venture would control a majority of the new American TikTok, while ByteDance would control less than 20%. </p><p>Trump says Chinese President Xi Jinping has okayed the deal, though no Chinese representatives were present at the order's signing. Again, nothing is for certain at this point, but we can take a look at the early details to get a sense for how a new \"America-approved\" TikTok would operate in the U.S.</p><h2 id=\"how-would-tiktok-change-in-the-us\">How would TikTok change in the US?</h2><p>First things first: the app itself. It's highly possible you'll need to download a new app entirely in order to keep using TikTok. This has been <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/tech/how-tiktoks-new-app-may-affect-you\" target=\"_blank\">a focus of speculation for a couple months now</a>, but <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2025/09/25/tiktok-deal-sale-algorithm-changes/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"open in a new window\">as the Washington Post reports</a>, TikTok engineers have been working on a U.S.-version of the app. The new app will likely appear identical to the TikTok experience you already know, and, in fact, might be accessible via a link within the current app. The Post makes the point that the harder it is for users to access the new TikTok app, the higher the chance they leave the platform entirely for alternatives like Instagram and YouTube, so TikTok engineers will no doubt be working on ways to make the transition as seamless as possible. </p><p>Then, there's the famous algorithm. This is what makes TikTok so addictive; the app's algorithm is so good, it learns what you like and shows you content to keep you scrolling for hours. Without the algorithm, TikTok very well could lose its addictive nature, and, along with it, its users. The Post reports that, at least at this time, the algorithm is staying put, and will be leased out from ByteDance by the new American TikTok venture. Plus, you should still be able to see international content going forward, not just videos posted by Americans. TikTok should, in theory, be as entertaining (and addicting) as ever. </p><div>\n            <p><span>\n                What do you think so far?\n            </span>\n        </p></div>\n<p>But that's not the end of the story. According to Trump's executive order, the algorithm will be \"retrained and monitored\" by \"trusted security partners\" of the U.S. That does not necessarily inspire confidence in a neutral algorithm for Americans, <a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/tech-news/trump-signs-executive-order-tiktok-deal-know-rcna233518\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"open in a new window\">especially as Trump says he would make it \"100% MAGA\" if he could</a>. </p><p>Finally, there's the question of user data. This was a major concern of the U.S. government, and part of why both the Trump and Biden administrations went after the app. <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/tech/tiktok-isnt-banned-yet#how-did-we-get-here\" target=\"_blank\">It wasn't without reason either</a>, as we learned ByteDance did in fact store American user data and had used it to obtain the IP addresses of American journalists. According to the executive order, all user data from the U.S. version of TikTok will need to be stored in a cloud environment operated by an American company.</p><p>We'll need to see how both ByteDance and the Chinese government address the executive order and potential divestiture going forward, as things could change. As of now, however, it seems both nothing will change, and everything will change. You'll still be able to endlessly scroll through your feed as you do now, but you may need to use a new, yet identical version of the app to do so. You may see the same content you do now, or you might start to see some new content, suspiciously aligned with the values of the current administration. And your data will still be controlled by a faceless third-party, only now it'll be by your own country, rather than a foreign nation.</p>\n            </article>\n    </div>\n<div>\n    <div>\n        <p><span>The Download Newsletter</span>\n            <span>Never miss a tech story</span>\n        </p>\n        <p><img src=\"https://lifehacker.com/images/team/Jake.png\" alt=\"Jake Peterson portrait\" />\n            <span>Jake Peterson\n            </span>\n            <span>Senior tech editor</span>\n        </p>\n        <p><span>Get the latest tech news, <span></span>reviews, <span></span>and advice from Jake and the team.</span>\n    </p></div>\n    <div>\n        <p><span>The Download Newsletter</span>\n            <span><span>Never miss a tech story.</span> Get the latest tech news, <span></span>reviews, <span></span>and advice from Jake and the team.</span>\n        </p>\n    </div>\n</div>\n    </div>\n            <div>\n                <p><span>\n                        Keep Scrolling for Next Article\n                    </span>\n                </p>\n            </div>\n        </div>"

To that point, with <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/tech/the-best-five-ios-26-features\" target=\"_blank\">iOS 26</a>, both the iPhone and the iPad get a new app that was a Mac exclusive for over 20 years: Preview. </p><h2 id=\"what-can-you-do-with-the-preview-app\">What can you do with the Preview app?</h2><p>Like on macOS, the Preview app for iOS and iPadOS is largely made for viewing PDFs and other documents. When you first open the app, you'll see the options to either create a new document or scan one with your iPhone's camera. </p><p>Most of the time, however, you probably you have an existing document you want to open using Preview. If so, you'll find those options in the bottom half of this starting page. This is Preview's integration with the Files app: You can browse your documents from Files and open any with Preview.</p><div>\n        <p><img src=\"https://lifehacker.com/images/short-lifehacker-logo.jpg\" alt=\"Lifehacker Logo\" /></p><div>\n            <p><span>You May Also Like</span></p>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n<p>Once you have a document loaded up, you're able to view, annotate, markup, and edit it. If you need to fill out a document with your information, you can use AutoFill to automatically enter contact info and other saved details. You can add your signature, and if you're on your iPad, you can use your Apple Pencil to draw on the document. Otherwise, you can use your finger to mark up the file. </p><p>You can also export documents from the Preview app. You can work with file types including HEIDC, JPEG, PDF, PNG, and TIFF. And as with Preview on macOS, there are a number of controls when exporting, such as resolution, embedding text, and saving images as JPEG.</p><p>While there's a lot you can do here, the biggest strength I see for this mobile Preview app is using it as a tool for legal documents. If you need to sign an important document, you can quickly scan it into the app, add your signature, fill out any information—perhaps automatically with AutoFill—then email the doc out, all without needing to jump to your computer.</p><h2 id=\"preview-on-ios-is-still-a-work-in-progress\">Preview on iOS is still a work in progress</h2><p>If you look at <a href=\"https://apps.apple.com/us/app/preview/id536344167?platform=iphone\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"open in a new window\">Preview's App Store page</a>, you'll notice some mixed reviews. After using the app for a bit, I understand why. Preview for iOS is definitely still a work in progress and in need of some key upgrades.</p><div>\n            <p><span>\n                What do you think so far?\n            </span>\n        </p></div>\n<p>The biggest quirks I noticed immediately: The main menu page is cluttered, with the Files integration looking more like a glitch than a dedicated window. Speaking of Files, Apple made the decision to have documents in Files open in Preview. At first, that sounds like a good idea, until you experience it in person on both iOS and iPadOS. Being dragged out of the Files app when you're not expecting it is jarring, especially when you're used to viewing your docs directly in the app. </p><p>The workaround here is to avoid Files for opening, well, files. Use the Files integration within Preview, so you stay in the same app. How intuitive. You could also choose to delete the Preview app, but that's a bit of a shame when it's such a major update for iOS and iPadOS 26.</p><p>Also, when you choose the Markup option, there's no clear way to exit without closing the whole app first. As far as I can tell, the only way to do so is to tap the three-dots in the top right, then tap Markup to exit this menu. The Markup button should really stay on screen as it does on macOS, so it's obvious how to dismiss it.    </p>\n            </article>\n    </div>\n<div>\n    <div>\n        <p><span>The Download Newsletter</span>\n            <span>Never miss a tech story</span>\n        </p>\n        <p><img src=\"https://lifehacker.com/images/team/Jake.png\" alt=\"Jake Peterson portrait\" />\n            <span>Jake Peterson\n            </span>\n            <span>Senior tech editor</span>\n        </p>\n        <p><span>Get the latest tech news, <span></span>reviews, <span></span>and advice from Jake and the team.</span>\n    </p></div>\n    <div>\n        <p><span>The Download Newsletter</span>\n            <span><span>Never miss a tech story.</span> Get the latest tech news, <span></span>reviews, <span></span>and advice from Jake and the team.</span>\n        </p>\n    </div>\n</div>\n    </div>\n            <div>\n                <p><span>\n                        Keep Scrolling for Next Article\n                    </span>\n                </p>\n            </div>\n        </div>"

Apple can keep adding new features and designs with each new smartphone iteration, but if the company just announced a new iPhone with record-breaking battery life, customers would be thrilled. </p><p>While we may have to wait for a time when the iPhone can go a couple days in between charges, Apple has added a new option to iOS 26 in an effort to help extend your iPhone's battery life. The feature, Adaptive Power, uses on-device AI to analyze your iPhone usage and guess the times you'll need additional battery life. This is exactly how I want to see AI being used—not for generating <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/tech/you-are-not-prepared-for-this-new-wave-of-ai-generated-videos\" target=\"_blank\">hyper-realistic videos</a> or <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/tech/spotify-ai-music-policies\" target=\"_blank\">musical slop</a>. </p><div>\n        <p><img src=\"https://lifehacker.com/images/short-lifehacker-logo.jpg\" alt=\"Lifehacker Logo\" /></p><div>\n            <p><span>You May Also Like</span></p>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n<h2 id=\"how-adaptive-power-tries-to-boost-your-battery\">How Adaptive Power tries to boost your battery</h2><div><p>When Adaptive Power decides it's time to engage, the feature can adjust your iPhone's performance level. This will make some tasks take longer than they normally would, but that slower speed supposedly saves on battery life. In addition, Adaptive Power lowers screen brightness by 3%, limits background activity, and, when your iPhone reaches 20%, kicks on Low Power Mode without asking you first. </p><p>Apple isn't totally clear here about the difference between Low Power Mode and Adaptive Power in general. From what we know, it seems that Adaptive Power simply reduces processing speeds at select intervals, and only slightly lowers brightness, while Low Power Mode slows speeds and display refresh rate, and limits brightness, 5G, iCloud syncing, and mail fetch, among other tasks.  </p></div><p>Adaptive Power is enabled by default on Apple's newest iPhones, including the iPhone 17, iPhone 17 Pro, iPhone 17 Pro Max, and iPhone Air—the latter of which <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/tech/extend-iphone-air-battery-life\" target=\"_blank\">could most likely benefit from such a feature</a>. For all other compatible iPhones, which includes iPhone 15 Pro and newer, the feature is turned off by default. That means, unless you have an iPhone 17 device, you'll need to turn this on yourself.</p><div>\n            <p><span>\n                What do you think so far?\n            </span>\n        </p></div>\n<h2 id=\"how-to-turn-adaptive-power-on-or-off\">How to turn Adaptive Power on or off</h2><p>Whether you have an iPhone 15 Pro or an iPhone 17, you'll find the controls for Adaptive Power in the same place. Open Settings, then head to <strong>Battery > Power Mode</strong>. Here, you can tap the toggle next to \"Adaptive Power\" to turn the setting on or off. </p><p>Since Adaptive Power turns on and off throughout the day, Apple also offers you the option to receive alerts whenever the feature is active. You can adjust this setting from the \"Adaptive Power Notifications\" toggle.</p><p>I've been using Adaptive Power since <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/tech/when-ios-26-will-release\" target=\"_blank\">iOS 26 dropped on Sept. 15</a>, but it's tough to say whether the feature has had a noticeable impact on my battery life. I think it would help if Apple added Adaptive Power information to my battery stats, so I could compare the impacts before and after using the feature. For now, I'll continue using it, if for no other reason than to offer my battery the best possible chance of making it through the day without its charger. </p>\n            </article>\n    </div>\n<div>\n    <div>\n        <p><span>The Download Newsletter</span>\n            <span>Never miss a tech story</span>\n        </p>\n        <p><img src=\"https://lifehacker.com/images/team/Jake.png\" alt=\"Jake Peterson portrait\" />\n            <span>Jake Peterson\n            </span>\n            <span>Senior tech editor</span>\n        </p>\n        <p><span>Get the latest tech news, <span></span>reviews, <span></span>and advice from Jake and the team.</span>\n    </p></div>\n    <div>\n        <p><span>The Download Newsletter</span>\n            <span><span>Never miss a tech story.</span> Get the latest tech news, <span></span>reviews, <span></span>and advice from Jake and the team.</span>\n        </p>\n    </div>\n</div>\n    </div>\n            <div>\n                <p><span>\n                        Keep Scrolling for Next Article\n                    </span>\n                </p>\n            </div>\n        </div>"

/><p>This week I did over a dozen workouts with Apple’s new Workout Buddy. I ran, I walked, I strength trained, and even did a little indoor cycling. I’ve learned a few things, but the strangest is that I didn’t need an Apple Watch for any of it. </p><p>Workout Buddy is an AI-powered feature that sends a little voice into your headphones to motivate and congratulate you as you’re working out. Apple touted Workout Buddy <a href=\"https://zdcs.link/QxxwGO?pageview_type=Standard&template=Explainers&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=as%20a%20feature%20of%20WatchOS%2026&short_url=QxxwGO&u=https%3A%2F%2Flifehacker.com%2Fhealth%2Fsurprising-things-about-apples-new-workout-buddy&event_label=as%20a%20feature%20of%20WatchOS%2026\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"open in a new window\"><u>as a feature of WatchOS 26</u></a> and <a href=\"https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2025/09/apple-debuts-apple-watch-series-11-featuring-groundbreaking-health-insights/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"open in a new window\"><u>promoted it among the features</u></a> of the new <a href=\"https://zdcs.link/z31xdE?pageview_type=Standard&template=Explainers&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=Series%2011%20Apple%20Watch&short_url=z31xdE&u=https%3A%2F%2Flifehacker.com%2Fhealth%2Fsurprising-things-about-apples-new-workout-buddy&event_label=Series%2011%20Apple%20Watch\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"open in a new window\"><u>Series 11 Apple Watch</u></a>, so you’d be forgiven for thinking it’s part of of the Apple Watch, specifically. But that’s not what I found. </p><div>\n        <p><img src=\"https://lifehacker.com/images/short-lifehacker-logo.jpg\" alt=\"Lifehacker Logo\" /></p><div>\n            <p><span>You May Also Like</span></p>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n<h2 id=\"how-to-use-workout-buddy-without-an-apple-watch\">How to use Workout Buddy without an Apple Watch</h2><p>But as I found when I took a supported Apple Watch out for a trail run with an old iPhone (a 12 Mini), Workout Buddy <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/health/workout-buddy-apple-watch-requirements\" target=\"_blank\"><u>requires a phone that supports Apple Intelligence</u></a>, so I didn’t have access to it. OK, fine, it needs a newer watch <em>and</em> a newer phone. (Or so I thought.) Eventually I got my hands on a 16 Pro and, yep, was able to enable and use Workout Buddy. </p><p>But this week—with a Series 11 Apple Watch on my wrist and WatchOS 26 installed—I discovered something. I could power off the watch, or even leave it at home, and <em>still get Workout Buddy</em>. Here are a few things I tried, <em>all</em> of which got me Workout Buddy: </p><ul><li><p>Starting a workout from the Series 10 or Series 11 Apple Watch</p></li><li><p>Starting a workout from the Fitness app (<a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/health/ios-26-gives-the-iphone-a-real-fitness-app\" target=\"_blank\"><u>you can do that now!</u></a>) with the Powerbeats Pro 2 headphones paired</p></li><li><p>Starting a workout from the Fitness app without any other Apple products in range, just a Coospo heart rate monitor and some Shokz headphones</p></li><li><p>Starting a workout from the Fitness app with just Shokz headphones paired (no heart rate monitor, since it was a GPS-enabled walk)</p></li></ul><p>The only configuration that <em>wouldn’t</em> give me Workout Buddy was using the Fitness app without headphones paired. It’s serious about needing headphones, but they can be paired to either the Watch or the iPhone. </p><h2 id=\"workout-buddy-is-more-of-a-chipper-sidekick-than-a-coach\">Workout Buddy is more of a chipper sidekick than a coach</h2><p>I hoped Workout Buddy might provide some kind of coaching or workout guidance, but found that’s not quite what it’s there for. The biggest difference between having Workout Buddy on versus off during a run is that, with Workout Buddy, you get your splits read to you in a more conversational voice.</p><p>The main advantage of Workout Buddy is that it gives you a check-in at the beginning and end of your workout to let you know where you stand on your goals and progress for the day and the week, and it will call out any notable recent achievements. </p><div>\n            <p><span>\n                What do you think so far?\n            </span>\n        </p></div>\n<p>For example, at the start of pretty much every workout this week—whether running, walking, or strength–it congratulated me on running my fastest-ever 5K last Tuesday. It also let me know I logged at least 16 workouts every week for the past four weeks, which is very consistent of me. </p><p>The workout count seems to be correct (I log a lot of short workouts for device testing), but the 5K callout is wrong. Last Tuesday I earned a 5K badge, but that’s just for logging a run of more than five kilometers, not for running my <em>fastest</em> 5K. According to the Fitness app—remember, the same app that contains Workout Buddy—my fastest 5K was in July of 2021. </p><p>Besides those hallucinations, the information seems to be reasonable. The overly-enthusiastic voice of the Workout Buddy always tells me at the start of each workout where I stand on my ring-closing goals. I need 22 more minutes to close my Exercise ring, it might say, or 37 more calories to close the Move ring. At the start of a run, it will tell me how many miles I’ve already run this week. And if I have music playing, it will name-check the band—seemingly just to let me know it can read that data. “Get into the rhythm with Fleetwood Mac!” it told me once, just as a Fleetwood Mac song was fading out. </p><p>Overall, I find the goal-oriented check-ins useful; knowing I have 22 minutes left on my exercise goal does make me more likely to extend my workout if I was only going to do a 20-minute one. The conversational voice giving me my mile splits is a bit nicer than hearing the generic, more robot-like voice. And if I <em>had</em> run my fastest 5K recently, I’d probably love to be reminded about it at every opportunity. </p>\n            </article>\n    </div>\n<div>\n    <div>\n        <p><span>The Daily Newsletter</span>\n            <span>Ready to do everything better?</span>\n        </p>\n        <p><img src=\"https://lifehacker.com/images/team/Jordan.png\" alt=\"Jordan Calhoun portrait\" />\n            <span>Jordan Calhoun\n            </span>\n            <span>Editor in chief</span>\n        </p>\n        <p><span><span>Get daily tips, tricks, <span>and tech guides</span></span> <span>from Jordan and the team.</span></span>\n    </p></div>\n    <div>\n        <p><span>The Daily Newsletter</span>\n            <span><span>Ready to do everything better?</span> <span>Get daily tips, tricks, <span>and tech guides</span></span> <span>from Jordan and the team.</span></span>\n        </p>\n    </div>\n</div>\n    </div>\n            <div>\n                <p><span>\n                        Keep Scrolling for Next Article\n                    </span>\n                </p>\n            </div>\n        </div>\n    </div>"

target=\"_blank\" title=\"open in a new window\">a \"magic circle\" Pilates prop</a> for personal use in my <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/health/seven-changes-that-helped-me-stick-to-my-home-fitness-routine\" target=\"_blank\">ever-expanding quest to get better at working out</a> at home. I wanted to put it into action right away, so naturally, I turned to my <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/health/peloton-app-review\" target=\"_blank\">beloved Peloton app</a>, where I figured I'd load up a Pilates workout and get to work. Weirdly, though, that wasn't as easy as it is when I, say, want to follow along with a <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/health/pelotons-yoga-offerings-are-surprisingly-robust\" target=\"_blank\">yoga</a> or <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/health/peloton-stretching-classes-are-helping-me-do-the-splits\" target=\"_blank\">stretching</a> class. Eventually, I figured it out and the Pilates workout (which did incorporate my hoop, thank you very much) was great—and challenging, which is how I like it.</p><h2 id=\"where-to-locate-pilates-classes-on-the-peloton-app\">Where to locate Pilates classes on the Peloton app</h2><p>I knew Peloton had Pilates classes. But when I opened up the app, there was no designated Pilates button the way there are buttons for <strong>Meditation</strong> and <strong>Cycling</strong>. I typed \"Pilates\" into the search bar at the top of the mobile app and it brought up 95 class results, some of which were actually categorized as yoga and others which were listed under strength. </p><div>\n        <p><img src=\"https://lifehacker.com/images/short-lifehacker-logo.jpg\" alt=\"Lifehacker Logo\" /></p><div>\n            <p><span>You May Also Like</span></p>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n<p>So, there <em>are</em> Pilates classes, but they're listed on different landing pages. Across the top of the search results page, you see <strong>Classes</strong>, <strong>Collections</strong>, <strong>Programs</strong>, and <strong>Music Artists</strong>. Tapping <strong>Collections</strong> yields a landing page called \"Pilates with Equipment,\" which has subcategories: Pilates with a Ball, Pilates with Sliders, Pilates with a Band, and—crucially, for me—Pilates with a Ring. There are only a handful of classes in each and they're all technically filed as \"strength classes\" in Peloton's system. I selected \"15 min Pilates\" from the section that incorporates the magic circle. </p><p>Things got harder from there. I wanted to play the class on my TV, which is possible because Peloton has an app on the Roku, but there is no search function on the Roku app. Instead, you have to look through the categories to find a class—which I couldn't do, since there is no Pilates category. I ended up getting the one I wanted by adding it to <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/health/how-to-stack-peloton-classes\" target=\"_blank\">my Peloton Stack</a>, which is like a personal class playlist; deleting everything else from the Stack; and running the Stack on the Roku app. It wasn't efficient or ideal, but ultimately, it worked. </p><div>\n            <p><span>\n                What do you think so far?\n            </span>\n        </p></div>\n<h2 id=\"what-pelotons-pilates-classes-are-like\">What Peloton's Pilates classes are like </h2><p>As much trouble as I had actually finding a class, I hadn't even technically done the \"hard\" part yet. Pilates is supposed to be challenging, after all, and the intermediate-level class I took definitely was. Armed with my mat and my hoop I followed along with some standard moves, like \"hundreds\" and clam shells. It was difficult, but not impossible, which is exactly what I was looking for. </p><p>Again, there are only 95 of these types of classes available and some are more about stretching while others are more strength-focused. That's a small selection compared to how many other types of classes Peloton offers. But what <em>is</em> available is solid. The instruction is clear and precise, modifications are offered, and the audio/video quality is top-tier, making it easy to hear and see what you're supposed to be doing. </p><p>I did the Peloton class last night and took an in-studio reformer class this morning. Granted, my in-person class was four times longer than the one I did from Peloton, but I'd say that adjusted for time, they were both equal in challenge. Because I am now the proud owner of a hoop <em>and </em>the knowledge of how to find high-quality, expert-led Pilates classes to play through Peloton, I'll certainly be doing more of these. Here's hoping we get a dedicated Pilates page on the Peloton app soon.</p>\n            </article>\n    </div>\n<div>\n    <div>\n        <p><span>The Daily Newsletter</span>\n            <span>Ready to do everything better?</span>\n        </p>\n        <p><img src=\"https://lifehacker.com/images/team/Jordan.png\" alt=\"Jordan Calhoun portrait\" />\n            <span>Jordan Calhoun\n            </span>\n            <span>Editor in chief</span>\n        </p>\n        <p><span><span>Get daily tips, tricks, <span>and tech guides</span></span> <span>from Jordan and the team.</span></span>\n    </p></div>\n    <div>\n        <p><span>The Daily Newsletter</span>\n            <span><span>Ready to do everything better?</span> <span>Get daily tips, tricks, <span>and tech guides</span></span> <span>from Jordan and the team.</span></span>\n        </p>\n    </div>\n</div>\n    </div>\n            <div>\n                <p><span>\n                        Keep Scrolling for Next Article\n                    </span>\n                </p>\n            </div>\n        </div>\n    </div>"

/><p>Studying can be as easy as sitting down and reading a chapter, but it shouldn't be. I do hate to break that to you, though I'm actually doing you a favor. Just absorbing huge blocks of content isn't necessarily helpful for remembering any of it. Before you do the work of studying, you have to get organized by sorting the content you need to absorb. Even organizing it, especially using the \"chunking\" method, will help you start to grasp and retain the materials, so by the time you're going through them, you'll be in a perfect position to lodge all that information in your memory. Chunking is a psychological trick that experts swear by. Here's how to master it for yourself.</p><h2 id=\"what-is-chunking\">What is chunking?</h2><p><a href=\"https://dictionary.apa.org/chunking\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"open in a new window\">Here’s what the American Psychological Association says</a>: Chunking is “the process by which the mind divides large pieces of information into smaller units (chunks) that are easier to retain in short-term memory. As a result of this recoding, one item in memory (e.g., a keyword or key idea) can stand for multiple other items (e.g., a short list of associated points).”</p><div>\n        <p><img src=\"https://lifehacker.com/images/short-lifehacker-logo.jpg\" alt=\"Lifehacker Logo\" /></p><div>\n            <p><span>You May Also Like</span></p>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n<p>Basically, your short-term memory has a specific capacity for how many units it can store and that capacity is pretty low, ranging from five to nine—but the units themselves can be as complex as you want. The APA says “the exact number of chunks remembered depends on the size of each chunk or the subunits contained within each chunk.”</p><p>Each chunk is a collection of pieces of related information, like words, numbers, or phrases. The key here is they have to be related to each other, but <em>not</em> very related to the other chunks. Chunking is all about grouping related pieces of information so you can stay in that five-to-nine units frame.</p><p>You probably already use chunking in your real life to remember things. Think of your phone number. You likely already sort it into your area code, those first three digits, and the final four digits. Remembering a string of 10 numbers is hard; remembering three “chunks” of smaller digits is less difficult.</p><h2 id=\"so-how-do-you-study-in-chunks\">So how do you study in chunks?</h2><p>Look at the things you have to memorize and start grouping them loosely into categories based on how they’re related. This doesn’t have to be about <em>content</em>, either. If you have to memorize 20 words or concepts, you don’t have to group them by their meaning; you can group them by whether they sound similar, start with the same letter, or whatever you want. If you've ever <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/the-best-ways-to-use-association-to-remember-what-you-1850861942\" target=\"_blank\">used a mnemonic device</a> to remember something like, say, the order of the planets, you've already made a \"chunk\" to study before. </p><div>\n            <p><span>\n                What do you think so far?\n            </span>\n        </p></div>\n<p>You can create your chunks with something as simple as a pencil and paper, listing the words or concepts together and skipping a few spaces between units. From here, you can make flashcard sets of each chunk or use the first letter of each phrase to create a mnemonic device. Try an acrostic, a phrase where the first letter of each word corresponds with the first letter of one of the things you need to remember. If you think better in terms of numbers, try grouping your words or concepts by how many letters are in them. </p><p>The pencil-and-paper technique is helpful for entrenching words in your memory, since <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/dont-use-laptop-to-take-notes-in-class\" target=\"_blank\">you retain things you write down</a> a little better than those you type, but it's not that convenient or functional otherwise. I recommend using apps and digital programs to make this easier. For instance, use a mind-mapping app to sort out your chunks and make them easy to visualize. I always find that even seeing words grouped together and organized can help me remember them and the ways they relate to each other better. <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/tech/xmind-mind-mapping-app-review\" target=\"_blank\">Xmind is my favorite app for this</a>, but you can also use something like Canva, which I have absolutely done in a pinch. Next, you can even use an app to create your flashcards. <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/leitner-system-flashcard-studying\" target=\"_blank\">Flashcards are one of the best</a> and most time-tested methods for studying, but it's wildly unrealistic for you to carry a bunch of notecards around. <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/tech/best-flashcard-apps-for-studying\" target=\"_blank\">These are my five favorite flashcard apps</a>, which will enable you to keep all your study materials accessible on your phone wherever you are. </p><p>I recommend making a new deck for every chunk you create so you can keep your groups separate in your mind. Once you've grasped all the content of your various chunks, try mixing some of the decks together and reviewing them in bigger batches. <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/why-you-should-actually-study-multiple-topics-at-the-sa-1850438252\" target=\"_blank\">Known as interleaving</a>, this technique will gradually help you make connections between different concepts, enhancing not only your recall of them, but your actual understanding. </p><p>Just don't forget to start out by studying each set—or chunk—individually. Even though this doesn’t break down the amount of content, having them in groups with similar characteristics will help you remember it all together, and you’ll be surprised how much of the real material you retain. </p>\n            </article>\n    </div>\n<div>\n    <div>\n        <p><span>The Daily Newsletter</span>\n            <span>Ready to do everything better?</span>\n        </p>\n        <p><img src=\"https://lifehacker.com/images/team/Jordan.png\" alt=\"Jordan Calhoun portrait\" />\n            <span>Jordan Calhoun\n            </span>\n            <span>Editor in chief</span>\n        </p>\n        <p><span><span>Get daily tips, tricks, <span>and tech guides</span></span> <span>from Jordan and the team.</span></span>\n    </p></div>\n    <div>\n        <p><span>The Daily Newsletter</span>\n            <span><span>Ready to do everything better?</span> <span>Get daily tips, tricks, <span>and tech guides</span></span> <span>from Jordan and the team.</span></span>\n        </p>\n    </div>\n</div>\n    </div>\n            <div>\n                <p><span>\n                        Keep Scrolling for Next Article\n                    </span>\n                </p>\n            </div>\n        </div>\n    </div>"

these days. It’s <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/tech/disable-gmail-automatic-gemini-ai-summaries?test_uuid=015ZvAUxXams0rnBpajhMg2&test_variant=B\" target=\"_blank\">in your Gmail</a>, it’s <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/tech/why-gemini-is-replacing-google-assistant?test_uuid=015ZvAUxXams0rnBpajhMg2&test_variant=B\" target=\"_blank\">on your phone</a>, and soon, it’ll be in your browser. While Google’s AI browser integration was already live for Google AI Pro and AI Ultra subscribers, it's now <a href=\"https://blog.google/products/chrome/new-ai-features-for-chrome/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"open in a new window\">rolling out to everyone</a>—and getting a bunch of new features, too.</p><p>If you’re suddenly seeing a new Gemini button in the top right of your Chrome browser (in the same pane as your tabs), then you’ve already been hit with the update. If not, you may need to use the three-dots button in the top right corner and select <strong>Gemini in Chrome</strong> to turn it on, assuming you want to.</p><h2 id=\"how-to-use-gemini-in-chrome\">How to use Gemini in Chrome</h2><p>When you click the Gemini button, or summon it via a keyboard shortcut (Alt + G by default), you’ll be able to try out the same features Google’s paying customers have had access to for a while. That means Gemini will be able to answer questions about the webpage you’re on, or just answer general questions unrelated to what you’re browsing. Or, if you’re in a Google app or on a Google website, it’ll be able to take some simple actions for you, like jumping you to a specific spot in a YouTube video.</p><div>\n        <p><img src=\"https://lifehacker.com/images/short-lifehacker-logo.jpg\" alt=\"Lifehacker Logo\" /></p><div>\n            <p><span>You May Also Like</span></p>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n<p>Additionally, Gemini can also now work across your tabs and compare information between them. Simply start a dialogue with Gemini by tapping the button in the top right corner, and at the bottom of the window, click “Add tab” to give Gemini another source of data to consider.</p><p>Weirdly, while these updates are already pushing live to average folks, Google says businesses will need to wait a couple of weeks, so they can get “enterprise-grade data protections and controls.”</p><p>As of now, aside from the new access, it’s not the biggest update, especially because to try it, you need to be on Windows or Mac, have your language set to English, and be in the U.S.. Google stresses that the Gemini Assistant on Android can also help you browse Chrome, and that it’s working to bring more direct Gemini in Chrome access to both its Android and iOS apps.</p><h2 id=\"more-ai-browsing-is-coming\">More AI browsing is coming</h2><p>Google says it also has big things in store for the feature, with “agentic browsing” set for the “coming months.” This will supposedly let Gemini in Chrome complete tasks, like booking a haircut for you, or ordering your groceries. Alternatively, it’ll also help you browse a bit more easily, as Google says it’s working to let you ask Gemini questions about your browser history when you want to go back to a specific page. For instance, “what was the website where I saw the walnut desk last week?” could take you back to a shopping page you only vaguely remember.</p><div>\n            <p><span>\n                What do you think so far?\n            </span>\n        </p></div>\n<p>A more powerful address bar is apparently in the works that will let you ask questions of Google’s AI model without having to navigate to it first. For now, Gemini in Chrome will start suggesting questions to ask it about whatever page you’re on, right in the address bar.</p><p>The update includes a few security updates too, although they mostly seem to work in the backend, supposedly using AI to better block scammy ads and notifications. Now that’s the type of AI integration I can support wholeheartedly.</p><h2 id=\"how-to-turn-off-gemini-in-chrome\">How to turn off Gemini in Chrome</h2><p>All that said, if you’re a bit skeptical about Gemini in Chrome, you can turn it off. Simply navigate to <strong>Settings > AI Innovations</strong>, and you’ll be able to turn off the Gemini button, as well as disable its keyboard shortcut. You can also restrict its permissions: Set everything to off, and it’ll be like it was never installed in the first place.</p>\n            </article>\n    </div>\n<div>\n    <div>\n        <p><span>The Download Newsletter</span>\n            <span>Never miss a tech story</span>\n        </p>\n        <p><img src=\"https://lifehacker.com/images/team/Jake.png\" alt=\"Jake Peterson portrait\" />\n            <span>Jake Peterson\n            </span>\n            <span>Senior tech editor</span>\n        </p>\n        <p><span>Get the latest tech news, <span></span>reviews, <span></span>and advice from Jake and the team.</span>\n    </p></div>\n    <div>\n        <p><span>The Download Newsletter</span>\n            <span><span>Never miss a tech story.</span> Get the latest tech news, <span></span>reviews, <span></span>and advice from Jake and the team.</span>\n        </p>\n    </div>\n</div>\n    </div>\n            <div>\n                <p><span>\n                        Keep Scrolling for Next Article\n                    </span>\n                </p>\n            </div>\n        </div>\n    </div>"

It doesn't help that I 1) live above a noisy Brooklyn bar and 2) share a bed with someone who snores and grinds his teeth. My go-to solution had been wearing my <a href=\"https://zdcs.link/a01KDr?pageview_type=Standard&template=Explainers&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=Anker%20Soundcore%20headphones&short_url=a01KDr&u=https%3A%2F%2Flifehacker.com%2Ftech%2Fozlo-sleepbuds-review&event_label=Anker%20Soundcore%20headphones\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"open in a new window\">Anker Soundcore headphones</a> with some sort of \"deep sleep\" playlist, but to be honest, sleeping with over-ear headphones is like trying to nap while wearing a helmet. Uncomfortable, potentially unsafe, and a surefire way to destroy my expensive electronics.</p><p>That's what led me to the Ozlo Sleepbuds, <a href=\"https://zdcs.link/Qp4Vng?pageview_type=Standard&template=Explainers&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=currently%20available%20for%20%24299&short_url=Qp4Vng&u=https%3A%2F%2Flifehacker.com%2Ftech%2Fozlo-sleepbuds-review&event_label=currently%20available%20for%20%24299\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"open in a new window\">currently available for $299</a>. Unlike my <a href=\"https://zdcs.link/aN8XnV?pageview_type=Standard&template=Explainers&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=AirPod%20Pros&short_url=aN8XnV&u=https%3A%2F%2Flifehacker.com%2Ftech%2Fozlo-sleepbuds-review&event_label=AirPod%20Pros\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"open in a new window\">AirPod Pros</a>, which are great for daily use but pierce my eardrums when I lie on my side, the Ozlo sleepbuds have a remarkably low profile. The pre-installed ear tips fit perfectly, creating a secure seal without the pressure points that make traditional earbuds a nightmare for side sleepers. Despite their <a href=\"https://casabona.org/2025/01/ozlo-sleepbuds-review/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"open in a new window\">mixed</a> online reviews, I've found that these smart earplugs really do help me sleep deeper (and possibly saved my relationship).</p><div>\n        <p><img src=\"https://lifehacker.com/images/short-lifehacker-logo.jpg\" alt=\"Lifehacker Logo\" /></p><div>\n            <p><span>You May Also Like</span></p>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n<h2 id=\"the-app-experience\">The app experience</h2><p>Here's where the Ozlo sleepbuds diverge from typical wireless earbuds, and honestly, it's a double-edged sword. Unlike AirPods that connect automatically via Bluetooth, these require opening the Ozlo app like a control center. You'll need to select your soundscape, adjust volume, and set your alarm through the app interface.</p><div>\n    <p><img src=\"https://lifehacker.com/imagery/articles/01K5S72NBMBKD6972CACS3XRXK/images-1.fill.size_2000x1125.v1758561654.png\" alt=\"Ozlo app screenshots\" srcset=\"https://lifehacker.com/imagery/articles/01K5S72NBMBKD6972CACS3XRXK/images-1.fill.size_800x450.v1758561654.png 800w, https://lifehacker.com/imagery/articles/01K5S72NBMBKD6972CACS3XRXK/images-1.fill.size_1400x788.v1758561654.png 1400w, https://lifehacker.com/imagery/articles/01K5S72NBMBKD6972CACS3XRXK/images-1.fill.size_2000x1125.v1758561654.png 2000w\" />\n            </p>\n            <p><span>Setting up my Ozlo sleepbuds.</span>\n                                        <span>Credit: Meredith Dietz</span>\n                    </p>\n    </div>\n<p>Initially, this felt clunky compared to the seamless connectivity we're all used to. But after a few nights, I found myself positively reframing this friction as more of a \"ritual.\" Opening the app, placing the buds in my ears, and selecting a soundscape became a bedtime ritual that signaled to my brain it was time to wind down. </p><h2 id=\"wearing-my-sleepbuds-through-the-night\">Wearing my sleepbuds through the night</h2><p>The moment of truth came on my first night testing them against my boyfriend's powerful snoring. I opted for the \"ocean tide\" sound to lull me to sleep. The audio quality is solid, especially knowing these were created by former Bose engineers.</p><p>So: Did these earbuds completely eliminate my partner's snoring? Not entirely—his snores are truly in a league of their own. But the combination of noise blocking and the ocean tide sound <em>significantly </em>reduced my nightly interruptions from constant to few and far between. Most importantly, when I did hear him, it didn't immediately snap me awake. The soundscapes seemed to cushion the noise, making it less startling.</p><p>But the street noise from the bar below? Completely gone. The upstairs neighbors walking around? Barely noticeable. These Sleepbuds excel at blocking consistent ambient noise while taking the edge off sudden, disruptive sounds.</p><div>\n            <p><span>\n                What do you think so far?\n            </span>\n        </p></div>\n<p>Another feature I love is the in-ear personal alarm. Instead of a jarring phone alarm that jolts both you and your partner awake, the Sleepbuds gently vibrate and play a soft tone directly into your ears. My boyfriend has never been woken up by my alarm since I started using them.</p><h2 id=\"tips-and-tricks-for-sleeping-with-earbuds-in\">Tips and tricks for sleeping with earbuds in</h2><p>After a few weeks of use, I've discovered several ways to optimize the Sleepbuds experience:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Find your perfect soundscape</strong>: Don't settle for the first one you try. I cycled through several before discovering that rain sounds work better for me than ocean waves or white noise.</p></li><li><p><strong>Create a charging routine</strong>: Keep the charging case on your nightstand and make putting the buds back a part of your morning routine. </p></li><li><p><strong>Experiment with volume levels</strong>: I really recommend starting lower than you think you need. Your ears adjust to the soundscape within minutes, and too-loud audio can actually be stimulating rather than relaxing.</p></li><li><p><strong>Use the app's sleep timer</strong>: If you don't want soundscapes playing all night, set a timer. You might only need the audio to fall asleep, not maintain it.</p></li><li><p><strong>Try different sleeping positions</strong>: The low profile means you can experiment with side sleeping even if you've never been able to before.</p></li></ul><h2 id=\"the-bottom-line\">The bottom line</h2><p>Are the Ozlo Sleepbuds perfect? No. The app dependency isn't ideal, and they won't completely eliminate every noise (I'm looking at you, Greg's snores). But compared to my previous solutions—uncomfortable headphones, potentially unsafe sleeping positions, or relegating myself to the couch—these Sleepbuds rock.</p><p>If I'm choosing between traditional foam earplugs, regular earbuds, or these specialized sleep buds, I'd pick the Ozlo Sleepbuds every time. My only concern? I'm becoming so dependent that I'll have trouble sleeping without them. But honestly, if that's the price for consistently good sleep in a noisy city apartment with a snoring partner, I'll take it.</p>\n            </article>\n    </div>\n<div>\n    <div>\n        <p><span>The Download Newsletter</span>\n            <span>Never miss a tech story</span>\n        </p>\n        <p><img src=\"https://lifehacker.com/images/team/Jake.png\" alt=\"Jake Peterson portrait\" />\n            <span>Jake Peterson\n            </span>\n            <span>Senior tech editor</span>\n        </p>\n        <p><span>Get the latest tech news, <span></span>reviews, <span></span>and advice from Jake and the team.</span>\n    </p></div>\n    <div>\n        <p><span>The Download Newsletter</span>\n            <span><span>Never miss a tech story.</span> Get the latest tech news, <span></span>reviews, <span></span>and advice from Jake and the team.</span>\n        </p>\n    </div>\n</div>\n    </div>\n            <div>\n                <p><span>\n                        Keep Scrolling for Next Article\n                    </span>\n                </p>\n            </div>\n        </div>\n    </div>"

The new \"<a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/tech/how-to-undo-iphone-ios-26-liquid-glass\" target=\"_blank\">Liquid Glass</a>\" design, while controversial, offers the first major UI overhaul since iOS 7, while <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/tech/the-best-five-ios-26-features\" target=\"_blank\">new features</a> like call screening and hold assist might change the way your make and receive phone calls. </p><p>If you have an iPhone, you may be tempted to install the new update—and, seeing as it has been out for a week and a half now, you might have updated already. If you haven't installed iOS 26, yet, however, think twice before you do, because you're going to be stuck with it: Apple has made it impossible to downgrade and return to iOS 18.</p><h2 id=\"you-cant-go-back-to-ios-18\">You can't go back to iOS 18</h2><p><a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/09/22/apple-stops-signing-ios-18-6-2/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"open in a new window\">As reported by MacRumors</a>, Apple stopped \"signing\" iOS 18.6.2 on Monday. When Apple signs a particular piece of software, it means you can download that software to your compatible device. Apple stops signing software shortly after it releases a new version. It's a system meant to block users from installing old software versions on their Apple devices, intended to protect those users from insecurities in operating systems that haven't been patched.</p><div>\n        <p><img src=\"https://lifehacker.com/images/short-lifehacker-logo.jpg\" alt=\"Lifehacker Logo\" /></p><div>\n            <p><span>You May Also Like</span></p>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n<p>As such, now that iOS 18.6.2 is no longer being signed, there is no way to downgrade to that software version from iOS 26 if you change your mind. Though the process was tedious, previously, <a href=\"https://x.com/badboychadhoy/status/1970549101973418116\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"open in a new window\">you could downgrade from iOS 26</a> by putting your iPhone in recovery mode, erasing it completely, and installing a new version of 18.6.2. Now that Apple has stopped signing 18.6.2, however, there's no way to install it, so a factory reset will only leave you with an iPhone running iOS 26, and none of your data.</p><div>\n            <p><span>\n                What do you think so far?\n            </span>\n        </p></div>\n<p>You might be wondering why you can't downgrade to iOS 18.7, since that's a newer version of iOS 18 than 18.6.2. <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-stops-signing-ios-18-6-2-ios-26-downgrades-now-impossible.2467148/post-34169189\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"open in a new window\">As users on the MacRumors forum point out</a>, you need an IPSW file in order to downgrade your iPhone, but Apple hasn't provided an IPSW file with iOS 18.7, as that update is only available over the air for uses already running iOS 18. That is to say: Unless your iPhone is already running 18.6.2, you can't install iOS 18.7.  </p><p>If you haven't updated your iPhone yet, you have two options. First, there's nothing<em> forcing </em>you to install iOS 26 on your device. You can keep running iOS 18.6.2 or iOS 18.7 as long as you want, and take advantage of any future security updates Apple provides to keep your iPhone protected. Alternately, you can go ahead and install iOS 26, with the understanding that you won't have the option to undo it—<a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/tech/how-to-undo-iphone-ios-26-liquid-glass\" target=\"_blank\">though you will be able to undo many of the UI changes</a>, at least. And if your main concern is performance and <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/tech/extend-iphone-air-battery-life\" target=\"_blank\">battery life</a>, it might be smart to wait for iOS 26.1, which is currently in beta testing. </p>\n            </article>\n    </div>\n<div>\n    <div>\n        <p><span>The Download Newsletter</span>\n            <span>Never miss a tech story</span>\n        </p>\n        <p><img src=\"https://lifehacker.com/images/team/Jake.png\" alt=\"Jake Peterson portrait\" />\n            <span>Jake Peterson\n            </span>\n            <span>Senior tech editor</span>\n        </p>\n        <p><span>Get the latest tech news, <span></span>reviews, <span></span>and advice from Jake and the team.</span>\n    </p></div>\n    <div>\n        <p><span>The Download Newsletter</span>\n            <span><span>Never miss a tech story.</span> Get the latest tech news, <span></span>reviews, <span></span>and advice from Jake and the team.</span>\n        </p>\n    </div>\n</div>\n    </div>\n            <div>\n                <p><span>\n                        Keep Scrolling for Next Article\n                    </span>\n                </p>\n            </div>\n        </div>"
