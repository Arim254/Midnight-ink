On the surface, it does sound pretty invasive, especially from a company that typically promotes user privacy. While this really is a new feature, here's the thing: It isn't as bad as it sounds. And, if you really don't like it, you can turn it off.</p><p>The feature, \"Visited Places,\" is actually intended to be a private way to keep tabs on the places you've been to, and to easily recall your favorites in the future. When the feature is enabled, Maps will take note of places you visit, even if you don't use Maps to get there. It's like a passive, automatic journal, taking note of restaurants, malls, parks, or simply general locations you venture to day-to-day. <a href=\"https://support.apple.com/guide/iphone/view-and-mange-visited-places-iph0c2597c4f/ios\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"open in a new window\">According to Apple</a>, all of this information is stored on your synced devices only, and is end-to-end encrypted, which means Apple has no way to access this data. </p><div>\n        <p><img src=\"https://lifehacker.com/images/short-lifehacker-logo.jpg\" alt=\"Lifehacker Logo\" /></p><div>\n            <p><span>You May Also Like</span></p>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n<p>If you have the feature enabled, you'll find your Visited Places appropriately tucked away in the \"Places\" menu when you launch Maps. I've only had the feature turned on for a day or so, so I only have three locations currently saved, but all three were destinations I visited without using Maps to guide me there. </p><p>Personally, I have no issue with keeping this setting turned on: Nobody has access to the data except for me, and I can imagine it reminding me of the places I've enjoyed visiting during a future scroll.</p><div>\n            <p><span>\n                What do you think so far?\n            </span>\n        </p></div>\n<p>Apple says you will be asked to turn on the feature when you open Maps after updating to iOS 26, and, in my experience, that was the case. However, <a href=\"https://www.cnet.com/tech/services-and-software/your-iphones-maps-app-is-tracking-you-in-ios-26-heres-how-to-stop-it/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"open in a new window\">for CNET writer Zachary McAuliffe</a>, the feature was already enabled without his input. As such, it might be smart to double-check that the feature is set to whichever setting you prefer, lest you allow Maps to track your movements without your knowledge. </p><h2 id=\"how-to-manage-visited-places-in-apple-maps\">How to manage 'Visited Places' in Apple Maps  </h2><p>To check whether the feature is turned on or off, head to <strong>Settings > Apps > Maps > Location</strong>. Alternatively, you can go to <strong>Settings > Privacy & Security > Location Services > Maps</strong>. Either way, check the toggle next to \"Visited Places.\" </p><p>You can also delete any Visited Places without needing to turn the feature off altogether. Open Maps, tap \"Places,\" then \"Visited Places.\" Here, you can swipe left on any place to delete it, or choose \"Clear History\" to delete them all. Plus, you can choose how long you want Maps to store your Visited Places: The default is \"Forever,\" but you can also select \"3 Months\" or \"1 Year,\" if you wish. </p>\n            </article>\n    </div>\n<div>\n    <div>\n        <p><span>The Download Newsletter</span>\n            <span>Never miss a tech story</span>\n        </p>\n        <p><img src=\"https://lifehacker.com/images/team/Jake.png\" alt=\"Jake Peterson portrait\" />\n            <span>Jake Peterson\n            </span>\n            <span>Senior tech editor</span>\n        </p>\n        <p><span>Get the latest tech news, <span></span>reviews, <span></span>and advice from Jake and the team.</span>\n    </p></div>\n    <div>\n        <p><span>The Download Newsletter</span>\n            <span><span>Never miss a tech story.</span> Get the latest tech news, <span></span>reviews, <span></span>and advice from Jake and the team.</span>\n        </p>\n    </div>\n</div>\n    </div>\n            <div>\n                <p><span>\n                        Keep Scrolling for Next Article\n                    </span>\n                </p>\n            </div>\n        </div>"

The new \"<a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/tech/how-to-undo-iphone-ios-26-liquid-glass\" target=\"_blank\">Liquid Glass</a>\" design, while controversial, offers the first major UI overhaul since iOS 7, while <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/tech/the-best-five-ios-26-features\" target=\"_blank\">new features</a> like call screening and hold assist might change the way your make and receive phone calls. </p><p>If you have an iPhone, you may be tempted to install the new update—and, seeing as it has been out for a week and a half now, you might have updated already. If you haven't installed iOS 26, yet, however, think twice before you do, because you're going to be stuck with it: Apple has made it impossible to downgrade and return to iOS 18.</p><h2 id=\"you-cant-go-back-to-ios-18\">You can't go back to iOS 18</h2><p><a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/09/22/apple-stops-signing-ios-18-6-2/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"open in a new window\">As reported by MacRumors</a>, Apple stopped \"signing\" iOS 18.6.2 on Monday. When Apple signs a particular piece of software, it means you can download that software to your compatible device. Apple stops signing software shortly after it releases a new version. It's a system meant to block users from installing old software versions on their Apple devices, intended to protect those users from insecurities in operating systems that haven't been patched.</p><div>\n        <p><img src=\"https://lifehacker.com/images/short-lifehacker-logo.jpg\" alt=\"Lifehacker Logo\" /></p><div>\n            <p><span>You May Also Like</span></p>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n<p>As such, now that iOS 18.6.2 is no longer being signed, there is no way to downgrade to that software version from iOS 26 if you change your mind. Though the process was tedious, previously, <a href=\"https://x.com/badboychadhoy/status/1970549101973418116\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"open in a new window\">you could downgrade from iOS 26</a> by putting your iPhone in recovery mode, erasing it completely, and installing a new version of 18.6.2. Now that Apple has stopped signing 18.6.2, however, there's no way to install it, so a factory reset will only leave you with an iPhone running iOS 26, and none of your data.</p><div>\n            <p><span>\n                What do you think so far?\n            </span>\n        </p></div>\n<p>You might be wondering why you can't downgrade to iOS 18.7, since that's a newer version of iOS 18 than 18.6.2. <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-stops-signing-ios-18-6-2-ios-26-downgrades-now-impossible.2467148/post-34169189\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"open in a new window\">As users on the MacRumors forum point out</a>, you need an IPSW file in order to downgrade your iPhone, but Apple hasn't provided an IPSW file with iOS 18.7, as that update is only available over the air for uses already running iOS 18. That is to say: Unless your iPhone is already running 18.6.2, you can't install iOS 18.7.  </p><p>If you haven't updated your iPhone yet, you have two options. First, there's nothing<em> forcing </em>you to install iOS 26 on your device. You can keep running iOS 18.6.2 or iOS 18.7 as long as you want, and take advantage of any future security updates Apple provides to keep your iPhone protected. Alternately, you can go ahead and install iOS 26, with the understanding that you won't have the option to undo it—<a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/tech/how-to-undo-iphone-ios-26-liquid-glass\" target=\"_blank\">though you will be able to undo many of the UI changes</a>, at least. And if your main concern is performance and <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/tech/extend-iphone-air-battery-life\" target=\"_blank\">battery life</a>, it might be smart to wait for iOS 26.1, which is currently in beta testing. </p>\n            </article>\n    </div>\n<div>\n    <div>\n        <p><span>The Download Newsletter</span>\n            <span>Never miss a tech story</span>\n        </p>\n        <p><img src=\"https://lifehacker.com/images/team/Jake.png\" alt=\"Jake Peterson portrait\" />\n            <span>Jake Peterson\n            </span>\n            <span>Senior tech editor</span>\n        </p>\n        <p><span>Get the latest tech news, <span></span>reviews, <span></span>and advice from Jake and the team.</span>\n    </p></div>\n    <div>\n        <p><span>The Download Newsletter</span>\n            <span><span>Never miss a tech story.</span> Get the latest tech news, <span></span>reviews, <span></span>and advice from Jake and the team.</span>\n        </p>\n    </div>\n</div>\n    </div>\n            <div>\n                <p><span>\n                        Keep Scrolling for Next Article\n                    </span>\n                </p>\n            </div>\n        </div>"

/><p>Summer and fall are the perfect time to prepare for standardized aptitude tests. Prepping through summer will help you be ready for a fall exam, giving you enough time to retake for a higher score it in the spring, if needed, or you can prep through fall and target that spring test. Even if you studied all summer, fall is the ideal time to review and cram down to the last minute. And no matter how you tend to learn, an app can probably help. Here are some of the best ones available on iOS and Android (some are available on a browser, too). </p><h2 id=\"try-khan-academy-if-youre-a-long-term-learner\">Try Khan Academy if you’re a long-term learner</h2><div>\n    <p><img src=\"https://lifehacker.com/imagery/articles/01HF2GN863974CE5FQNADJRYFV/images-1.fill.size_2000x1125.v1759174244.png\" alt=\"Khan Academy in browsr\" srcset=\"https://lifehacker.com/imagery/articles/01HF2GN863974CE5FQNADJRYFV/images-1.fill.size_800x450.v1759174244.png 800w, https://lifehacker.com/imagery/articles/01HF2GN863974CE5FQNADJRYFV/images-1.fill.size_1400x788.v1759174244.png 1400w, https://lifehacker.com/imagery/articles/01HF2GN863974CE5FQNADJRYFV/images-1.fill.size_2000x1125.v1759174244.png 2000w\" />\n            </p>\n            <p><span></span>\n                                        <span>Credit: Khan Academy</span>\n                    </p>\n    </div>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.khanacademy.org/downloads\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"open in a new window\">Khan Academy</a>, a nonprofit organization and partner of the College Board, has become synonymous with test prep. They have free courses in various AP classes, a variety of subjects, and, of course, standardized tests like the SAT and LSAT—which means if you start with Khan while you prepare for the SAT, you can stick with it all the way through wherever your educational journey takes you. </p><div>\n        <p><img src=\"https://lifehacker.com/images/short-lifehacker-logo.jpg\" alt=\"Lifehacker Logo\" /></p><div>\n            <p><span>You May Also Like</span></p>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n<p>Beyond having a deep selection of study materials, Khan Academy serves up information in video form, with clips that go through practice problems similar to the ones you could face on your exam. For real-deal practice questions, you’ll need to use the desktop version of the site, but the app-based videos are great to take on the go.</p><p>What I like about Khan is that some of the videos and articles are informational. For instance, you can read about calculator policies for the SAT or watch a quick clip that gives you an overview of what the test is and what to expect. Studying material is one thing, but being prepared for the experience is another, and this app is well-rounded there. </p><h2 id=\"use-magooshs-sat-app-for-customized-prep\">Use Magoosh’s SAT app for customized prep</h2><div>\n    <p><img src=\"https://lifehacker.com/imagery/articles/01HF2GN863974CE5FQNADJRYFV/images-2.fill.size_2000x1133.v1759174244.png\" alt=\"Magoosh SAT in iOS\" srcset=\"https://lifehacker.com/imagery/articles/01HF2GN863974CE5FQNADJRYFV/images-2.fill.size_800x453.v1759174244.png 800w, https://lifehacker.com/imagery/articles/01HF2GN863974CE5FQNADJRYFV/images-2.fill.size_1400x793.v1759174244.png 1400w, https://lifehacker.com/imagery/articles/01HF2GN863974CE5FQNADJRYFV/images-2.fill.size_2000x1133.v1759174244.png 2000w\" />\n            </p>\n            <p><span></span>\n                                        <span>Credit: Magoosh</span>\n                    </p>\n    </div>\n<p><a href=\"https://sat.magoosh.com/sat-apps\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"open in a new window\">Magoosh</a> flashcards and practice quizzes go over English and math concepts you should know for your test. Out of all the apps, the Practice & Prep offering is unique because it's dedicated purely to the SAT, but it is customizable. The first time you log in, you're prompted to share when your test is so the app can configure what you should study between now and then. There will be a difference in how you approach it if you have one month or one year to get ready and Magoosh's app knows that.</p><p>Like Khan Academy, this platform gives you information on the test itself, too, offering up a landing page of articles on how to prepare. Beyond that, you get practice questions, videos on the reading and writing sections, and practice tests. While flashcards and study games are useful, practice quizzes are pretty crucial, too, because they give you a better sense of how you'll perform when you're facing down a large volume of content. </p><p>Bear in mind there are <a href=\"https://sat.magoosh.com/sat-apps\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"open in a new window\">two apps</a> from this company: I like the Practice & Prep, obviously, because it's so customizable and helpful with the quizzes, but there is a separate flashcard app available if you learn better that way and want to double up on the methods you use for studying. </p><h2 id=\"use-varsity-tutors-sat-practice-prep-flashcards-if-you-want-the-most-variety\">Use Varsity Tutors’ SAT: Practice, Prep, Flashcards if you want the most variety</h2><div>\n    <p><img src=\"https://lifehacker.com/imagery/articles/01HF2GN863974CE5FQNADJRYFV/images-3.fill.size_2000x1130.v1759174244.png\" alt=\"Varsity Tutors SAT in iOS\" srcset=\"https://lifehacker.com/imagery/articles/01HF2GN863974CE5FQNADJRYFV/images-3.fill.size_800x452.v1759174244.png 800w, https://lifehacker.com/imagery/articles/01HF2GN863974CE5FQNADJRYFV/images-3.fill.size_1400x791.v1759174244.png 1400w, https://lifehacker.com/imagery/articles/01HF2GN863974CE5FQNADJRYFV/images-3.fill.size_2000x1130.v1759174244.png 2000w\" />\n            </p>\n            <p><span></span>\n                                        <span>Credit: Varsity Tutors</span>\n                    </p>\n    </div>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.varsitytutors.com/sat-mobile-app\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"open in a new window\">Varsity Tutors</a> is another well-known name in the studying space, and the company's SAT app is thorough.

The beauty of <a href=\"https://www.brainscape.com/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"open in a new window\">Brainscape</a> is that while it's a flashcard app and those are a dime a dozen, it has some legitimacy attached to it because the company works directly with the governing bodies that oversee tests when it creates flashcard decks. AP tests, certification exams, and the SAT are just a few of the options you can study with the knowledge that the questions you're reviewing are actually relevant to the test. Like other apps, Brainscape has an option for reviewing user-generated flashcard decks, too, and that's great—but start with the deck that's been created with the SAT organization itself. </p><p>Crucially, Brainscape uses a version of <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/leitner-system-flashcard-studying\" target=\"_blank\">the Leitner method</a> to quiz you. When you finish answering a flashcard, you indicate how well you knew the answer on a scale of one to five. That determines how often that same card is shown to you, with the lesser-known cards cropping up more frequently and the better-mastered cards popping up less often— it forces you to study more effectively, which is a winning strategy. </p><h2 id=\"use-notebooklm-to-shake-things-up\">Use NotebookLM to shake things up</h2><div>\n    <p><img src=\"https://lifehacker.com/imagery/articles/01HF2GN863974CE5FQNADJRYFV/images-5.fill.size_2000x1125.v1759174244.png\" alt=\"NotebookLM in browser\" srcset=\"https://lifehacker.com/imagery/articles/01HF2GN863974CE5FQNADJRYFV/images-5.fill.size_800x450.v1759174244.png 800w, https://lifehacker.com/imagery/articles/01HF2GN863974CE5FQNADJRYFV/images-5.fill.size_1400x788.v1759174244.png 1400w, https://lifehacker.com/imagery/articles/01HF2GN863974CE5FQNADJRYFV/images-5.fill.size_2000x1125.v1759174244.png 2000w\" />\n            </p>\n            <p><span></span>\n                                        <span>Credit: Google</span>\n                    </p>\n    </div>\n<p>Finally, if you're a student or learner of any kind, not just an SAT-prepper, I recommend <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/tech/google-notebooklm-review\" target=\"_blank\">Google's NotebookLM AI tool</a>. It's like any other AI chatbot except that it doesn't pull its responses from the Internet. Instead, it relies only on information you feed it. If you have SAT prep tests or study materials from school, a tutor, a guidance counselor, or online, you can upload them into <a href=\"https://notebooklm.google.com/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"open in a new window\">NotebookLM</a> and ask the software to generate a practice quiz, flashcards, summary, or even a \"podcast\" that features two voices discussing the content. No matter how you learn best, NotebookLM has a feature to support you. </p><p>Importantly, it only uses the materials you upload, like I said. This means you won't get any random or incorrect content from the far reaches of the Internet; you'll only get information you select and input. ChatGPT gets things wrong all the time (and I have seen it <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/the-best-ways-to-study-but-not-cheat-using-ai-tools\" target=\"_blank\">generate complete nonsense</a> when dealing with people I tutor in writing), so this is a welcome resource if you like using AI but are worried about being misled.

When you first open the app, you'll see the options to either create a new document or scan one with your iPhone's camera. </p><p>Most of the time, however, you probably you have an existing document you want to open using Preview. If so, you'll find those options in the bottom half of this starting page. This is Preview's integration with the Files app: You can browse your documents from Files and open any with Preview.</p><div>\n        <p><img src=\"https://lifehacker.com/images/short-lifehacker-logo.jpg\" alt=\"Lifehacker Logo\" /></p><div>\n            <p><span>You May Also Like</span></p>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n<p>Once you have a document loaded up, you're able to view, annotate, markup, and edit it. If you need to fill out a document with your information, you can use AutoFill to automatically enter contact info and other saved details. You can add your signature, and if you're on your iPad, you can use your Apple Pencil to draw on the document. Otherwise, you can use your finger to mark up the file. </p><p>You can also export documents from the Preview app. You can work with file types including HEIDC, JPEG, PDF, PNG, and TIFF. And as with Preview on macOS, there are a number of controls when exporting, such as resolution, embedding text, and saving images as JPEG.</p><p>While there's a lot you can do here, the biggest strength I see for this mobile Preview app is using it as a tool for legal documents. If you need to sign an important document, you can quickly scan it into the app, add your signature, fill out any information—perhaps automatically with AutoFill—then email the doc out, all without needing to jump to your computer.</p><h2 id=\"preview-on-ios-is-still-a-work-in-progress\">Preview on iOS is still a work in progress</h2><p>If you look at <a href=\"https://apps.apple.com/us/app/preview/id536344167?platform=iphone\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"open in a new window\">Preview's App Store page</a>, you'll notice some mixed reviews. After using the app for a bit, I understand why. Preview for iOS is definitely still a work in progress and in need of some key upgrades.</p><div>\n            <p><span>\n                What do you think so far?\n            </span>\n        </p></div>\n<p>The biggest quirks I noticed immediately: The main menu page is cluttered, with the Files integration looking more like a glitch than a dedicated window. Speaking of Files, Apple made the decision to have documents in Files open in Preview. At first, that sounds like a good idea, until you experience it in person on both iOS and iPadOS. Being dragged out of the Files app when you're not expecting it is jarring, especially when you're used to viewing your docs directly in the app. </p><p>The workaround here is to avoid Files for opening, well, files. Use the Files integration within Preview, so you stay in the same app. How intuitive. You could also choose to delete the Preview app, but that's a bit of a shame when it's such a major update for iOS and iPadOS 26.</p><p>Also, when you choose the Markup option, there's no clear way to exit without closing the whole app first. As far as I can tell, the only way to do so is to tap the three-dots in the top right, then tap Markup to exit this menu. The Markup button should really stay on screen as it does on macOS, so it's obvious how to dismiss it.    </p>\n            </article>\n    </div>\n<div>\n    <div>\n        <p><span>The Download Newsletter</span>\n            <span>Never miss a tech story</span>\n        </p>\n        <p><img src=\"https://lifehacker.com/images/team/Jake.png\" alt=\"Jake Peterson portrait\" />\n            <span>Jake Peterson\n            </span>\n            <span>Senior tech editor</span>\n        </p>\n        <p><span>Get the latest tech news, <span></span>reviews, <span></span>and advice from Jake and the team.</span>\n    </p></div>\n    <div>\n        <p><span>The Download Newsletter</span>\n            <span><span>Never miss a tech story.</span> Get the latest tech news, <span></span>reviews, <span></span>and advice from Jake and the team.</span>\n        </p>\n    </div>\n</div>\n    </div>\n            <div>\n                <p><span>\n                        Keep Scrolling for Next Article\n                    </span>\n                </p>\n            </div>\n        </div>"

/><p>The whole point of studying is to retain information you’ll need later in life, even if it’s just for an impending test on a subject you may never think about again in the future. That’s not easy when you’re taking in a bunch of unfamiliar phrases and concepts—which is why you need a quality method to structure your study sessions. Try the SQ3R technique next time you’re studying, and see the difference it can make.</p><h2 id=\"what-is-the-sq3r-study-method\">What is the SQ3R study method?</h2><p>I touched on a similar method briefly before when <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/best-note-taking-methods-1849535943\" target=\"_blank\">advising on best note-taking practices</a>, but SQ3R has applications well beyond the moments when you’re taking notes in (<a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/revise-your-notes-before-you-leave-class-1850774684\" target=\"_blank\">and after</a>) class. It’s actually a reading comprehension technique that was first introduced in 1946 by Francis P. Robinson in his book <a href=\"https://zdcs.link/neNeq?pageview_type=Standard&template=Explainers&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=Effective%20Study&short_url=neNeq&u=https%3A%2F%2Flifehacker.com%2Fhow-to-use-the-sq3r-study-method&event_label=Effective%20Study\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"open in a new window\"><em>Effective Study</em></a>. (Fun side note: The “P” stands for Pleasant!)</p><div>\n        <p><img src=\"https://lifehacker.com/images/short-lifehacker-logo.jpg\" alt=\"Lifehacker Logo\" /></p><div>\n            <p><span>You May Also Like</span></p>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n<p>SQ3R has withstood the test of time and is now widely recommended by academic counselors on campuses across the country. It’s named for the five steps involved in the method:</p><ul><li><p>Survey</p></li><li><p>Question</p></li><li><p>Read</p></li><li><p>Recite</p></li><li><p>Review</p></li></ul><h2 id=\"how-does-sq3r-work\">How does SQ3R work?</h2><p>It’s important, first of all, to chunk up your work here. The goal is not to do this with an entire textbook or a bunch of materials, but to go chapter by chapter or section by section. You'll see why as you move through the steps, but just bear in mind you want to be hyper-focused on smaller sections. In general, chunking up your review work is a recommended practice and it works well with SQ3R and all kinds of other study approaches, so be sure to <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/how-to-study-better-with-the-chunking-method\" target=\"_blank\">brush up on it</a> while you're restructuring your study approach. </p><h3>Survey</h3><p>You <strong>survey</strong> your materials first, skimming them just enough to grasp what the overall idea is. Look at the chapter title, intros and conclusions, headings, sub-headings, graphics, tables, and summaries, but don’t read the whole thing. </p><p>You can also call on contextual details here. If you got assigned to read this chapter in a lecture, think back on that class, especially on anything the teacher mentioned as being important. Go through any slideshows they uploaded as supplemental material, as well as any existing notes you have. Again, just skim, but get an idea of what, broadly, this section is about.</p><h3>Question</h3><p>Then, you come up with <strong>questions</strong>, like, “What is this section about?” or, “How will I use this information in real life?” The questions can be more specific than that and depend a lot on what the content of your chapter is. </p><p>An easy trick is to turn subheadings into questions. If your subheading just says, “The assassination of Franz Ferdinand,” your question can be, “What were the immediate impacts of the assassination of Franz Ferdinand?” </p><p>Something I like to do is ask myself, \"How might this appear on a test?\" If I'm reading about the founder of a movement, for instance, and they were born in a certain country in a particular year and those details were relevant to their rise to power, I'd assume there would be a question on that on the test, so I might be able to focus my studying better if I can anticipate that.</p><h3>Read</h3><p>Jot the questions down before moving on to the third step, which is finally <strong>reading</strong> the whole chapter or section, paying attention to anything that might answer your questions. Take notes.</p><p>What helps here is writing the answers you find in the material directly under the questions you wrote down. Typically, I advocate for <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/dont-use-laptop-to-take-notes-in-class\" target=\"_blank\">taking handwritten notes</a> and studying with a pen and paper whenever possible, but here, you may find that you don't have enough room to answer the questions you write down or take notes on new information you find while reading. To be on the safe side (and stop yourself from making a disorganized, scribbled-out and erased-up mess) go ahead and use a word processing document for your questions and answers. </p><div>\n            <p><span>\n                What do you think so far?\n            </span>\n        </p></div>\n<h3>Recitation</h3><p>The next step is <strong>recitation</strong>. Use your own words to explain the contents of what you studied and answer your own questions. Pretend you’re explaining it to someone else or even write it all down in a small essay format. </p><p>If you write it all down as a small essay, you'll be using the <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/two-ways-to-use-the-blurting-method-to-study-1850999140\" target=\"_blank\">\"blurting\" method</a>, or at least a variation of it. Blurting asks you to remember everything you can about a topic, then say or write it somewhere before checking your notes and materials for anything you missed. It <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/use-these-active-recall-techniques-the-next-time-you-st-1850797753\" target=\"_blank\">forces active recall</a>, or the act of digging something out of your memory. Here, don't feel too much pressure to remember everything; treat this more like an open-book test, especially if it's your first time through your review. You can use other techniques, like the <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/leitner-system-flashcard-studying\" target=\"_blank\">Leitner flashcard method</a>, to entrench the answers you find in your memory once you've got a grasp of the overall theme of the section. </p><p>You can also go a step further and actually explain the material to someone. That's <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/how-to-use-the-feynman-method-to-study\" target=\"_blank\">the Feynman method</a>, which has you act like a teacher describing the content to someone who knows nothing about it. You can do this with a parent, a friend, or <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/the-best-ways-to-study-but-not-cheat-using-ai-tools\" target=\"_blank\">even ChatGPT</a>. It helps you break the material down into easy-to-understand parts. If you don't understand something well enough to teach it to someone else, you don't understand it well at all. But again, incorporate this over time. You don't need to be ready for this step on your first run-through with SQ3R. It's just an easy way to gauge how well you're mastering a concept. </p><h3>Review</h3><p>Finally, <strong>review</strong> what you read, wrote, and/or said before starting the process again on another chapter. Feel free to move to another chapter or section before you have a firm grasp of the current one, too. <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/why-you-should-actually-study-multiple-topics-at-the-sa-1850438252\" target=\"_blank\">Called interleaving</a>, this practice of studying multiple concepts or ideas at once can force you to make connections between material and better understand both topics than if you were tackling them individually. </p><p>The purpose of all of this is to get you thinking critically and help you stay engaged as you read, hunting for the answers to your questions. From there, you can branch off into the other techniques I mentioned, like Leitner and Feynman, because you created a solid base of chunks of information—questions and answers from the text, essentially—to study. </p><h2 id=\"best-practices-with-sq3r\">Best practices with SQ3R</h2><p>I mentioned earlier that you might want to use a word processor or notes app for this, so you don't run out of space or get frustrated. You do have other options if handwriting and its benefits appeal to you. In that case, I recommend picking up <a href=\"https://zdcs.link/Q4bqgy?pageview_type=Standard&template=Explainers&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=a%20SQ3R%20notebook&short_url=Q4bqgy&u=https%3A%2F%2Flifehacker.com%2Fhow-to-use-the-sq3r-study-method&event_label=a%20SQ3R%20notebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"open in a new window\">a SQ3R notebook</a>. It's only $6, and it provides designated spaces for the different steps; plus, since the sections are pre-defined, it forces you to take on your work in smaller chunks because you don't have room on the page to try to do too much at once. Play around with different methods, from digital to notebook, to see what works for you and the material you study. </p><p>Finally, don't assume you've reached the end of studying when you hit the review portion of SQ3R. Studying is a long-term endeavor, so that \"review\" part is actually ongoing from the time you first get acquainted with the material. After you finish your first round of SQ3R, study the materials periodically, every few days. If, after a few reviews, you feel like you're not grasping the material as well as you want to, try the SQ3R method again on the same chunk of text you already did, formulating different questions and looking for other angles. Once you're more familiar with the topics, you'll come up with more in-depth questions, so repeating SQ3R a few times over a semester is a smart strategy.</p>\n            </article>\n    </div>\n<div>\n    <div>\n        <p><span>The Daily Newsletter</span>\n            <span>Ready to do everything better?</span>\n        </p>\n        <p><img src=\"https://lifehacker.com/images/team/Jordan.png\" alt=\"Jordan Calhoun portrait\" />\n            <span>Jordan Calhoun\n            </span>\n            <span>Editor in chief</span>\n        </p>\n        <p><span><span>Get daily tips, tricks, <span>and tech guides</span></span> <span>from Jordan and the team.</span></span>\n    </p></div>\n    <div>\n        <p><span>The Daily Newsletter</span>\n            <span><span>Ready to do everything better?</span> <span>Get daily tips, tricks, <span>and tech guides</span></span> <span>from Jordan and the team.</span></span>\n        </p>\n    </div>\n</div>\n    </div>\n            <div>\n                <p><span>\n                        Keep Scrolling for Next Article\n                    </span>\n                </p>\n            </div>\n        </div>\n    </div>"

href=\"https://lifehacker.com/health/seven-changes-that-helped-me-stick-to-my-home-fitness-routine\" target=\"_blank\">ever-expanding quest to get better at working out</a> at home. I wanted to put it into action right away, so naturally, I turned to my <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/health/peloton-app-review\" target=\"_blank\">beloved Peloton app</a>, where I figured I'd load up a Pilates workout and get to work. Weirdly, though, that wasn't as easy as it is when I, say, want to follow along with a <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/health/pelotons-yoga-offerings-are-surprisingly-robust\" target=\"_blank\">yoga</a> or <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/health/peloton-stretching-classes-are-helping-me-do-the-splits\" target=\"_blank\">stretching</a> class. Eventually, I figured it out and the Pilates workout (which did incorporate my hoop, thank you very much) was great—and challenging, which is how I like it.</p><h2 id=\"where-to-locate-pilates-classes-on-the-peloton-app\">Where to locate Pilates classes on the Peloton app</h2><p>I knew Peloton had Pilates classes. But when I opened up the app, there was no designated Pilates button the way there are buttons for <strong>Meditation</strong> and <strong>Cycling</strong>. I typed \"Pilates\" into the search bar at the top of the mobile app and it brought up 95 class results, some of which were actually categorized as yoga and others which were listed under strength. </p><div>\n        <p><img src=\"https://lifehacker.com/images/short-lifehacker-logo.jpg\" alt=\"Lifehacker Logo\" /></p><div>\n            <p><span>You May Also Like</span></p>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n<p>So, there <em>are</em> Pilates classes, but they're listed on different landing pages. Across the top of the search results page, you see <strong>Classes</strong>, <strong>Collections</strong>, <strong>Programs</strong>, and <strong>Music Artists</strong>. Tapping <strong>Collections</strong> yields a landing page called \"Pilates with Equipment,\" which has subcategories: Pilates with a Ball, Pilates with Sliders, Pilates with a Band, and—crucially, for me—Pilates with a Ring. There are only a handful of classes in each and they're all technically filed as \"strength classes\" in Peloton's system. I selected \"15 min Pilates\" from the section that incorporates the magic circle. </p><p>Things got harder from there. I wanted to play the class on my TV, which is possible because Peloton has an app on the Roku, but there is no search function on the Roku app. Instead, you have to look through the categories to find a class—which I couldn't do, since there is no Pilates category. I ended up getting the one I wanted by adding it to <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/health/how-to-stack-peloton-classes\" target=\"_blank\">my Peloton Stack</a>, which is like a personal class playlist; deleting everything else from the Stack; and running the Stack on the Roku app. It wasn't efficient or ideal, but ultimately, it worked. </p><div>\n            <p><span>\n                What do you think so far?\n            </span>\n        </p></div>\n<h2 id=\"what-pelotons-pilates-classes-are-like\">What Peloton's Pilates classes are like </h2><p>As much trouble as I had actually finding a class, I hadn't even technically done the \"hard\" part yet. Pilates is supposed to be challenging, after all, and the intermediate-level class I took definitely was. Armed with my mat and my hoop I followed along with some standard moves, like \"hundreds\" and clam shells. It was difficult, but not impossible, which is exactly what I was looking for. </p><p>Again, there are only 95 of these types of classes available and some are more about stretching while others are more strength-focused. That's a small selection compared to how many other types of classes Peloton offers. But what <em>is</em> available is solid. The instruction is clear and precise, modifications are offered, and the audio/video quality is top-tier, making it easy to hear and see what you're supposed to be doing. </p><p>I did the Peloton class last night and took an in-studio reformer class this morning. Granted, my in-person class was four times longer than the one I did from Peloton, but I'd say that adjusted for time, they were both equal in challenge. Because I am now the proud owner of a hoop <em>and </em>the knowledge of how to find high-quality, expert-led Pilates classes to play through Peloton, I'll certainly be doing more of these. Here's hoping we get a dedicated Pilates page on the Peloton app soon.</p>\n            </article>\n    </div>\n<div>\n    <div>\n        <p><span>The Daily Newsletter</span>\n            <span>Ready to do everything better?</span>\n        </p>\n        <p><img src=\"https://lifehacker.com/images/team/Jordan.png\" alt=\"Jordan Calhoun portrait\" />\n            <span>Jordan Calhoun\n            </span>\n            <span>Editor in chief</span>\n        </p>\n        <p><span><span>Get daily tips, tricks, <span>and tech guides</span></span> <span>from Jordan and the team.</span></span>\n    </p></div>\n    <div>\n        <p><span>The Daily Newsletter</span>\n            <span><span>Ready to do everything better?</span> <span>Get daily tips, tricks, <span>and tech guides</span></span> <span>from Jordan and the team.</span></span>\n        </p>\n    </div>\n</div>\n    </div>\n            <div>\n                <p><span>\n                        Keep Scrolling for Next Article\n                    </span>\n                </p>\n            </div>\n        </div>\n    </div>"
