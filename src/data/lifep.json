To that point, with <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/tech/the-best-five-ios-26-features\" target=\"_blank\">iOS 26</a>, both the iPhone and the iPad get a new app that was a Mac exclusive for over 20 years: Preview. </p><h2 id=\"what-can-you-do-with-the-preview-app\">What can you do with the Preview app?</h2><p>Like on macOS, the Preview app for iOS and iPadOS is largely made for viewing PDFs and other documents. When you first open the app, you'll see the options to either create a new document or scan one with your iPhone's camera. </p><p>Most of the time, however, you probably you have an existing document you want to open using Preview. If so, you'll find those options in the bottom half of this starting page. This is Preview's integration with the Files app: You can browse your documents from Files and open any with Preview.</p><div>\n        <p><img src=\"https://lifehacker.com/images/short-lifehacker-logo.jpg\" alt=\"Lifehacker Logo\" /></p><div>\n            <p><span>You May Also Like</span></p>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n<p>Once you have a document loaded up, you're able to view, annotate, markup, and edit it. If you need to fill out a document with your information, you can use AutoFill to automatically enter contact info and other saved details. You can add your signature, and if you're on your iPad, you can use your Apple Pencil to draw on the document. Otherwise, you can use your finger to mark up the file. </p><p>You can also export documents from the Preview app. You can work with file types including HEIDC, JPEG, PDF, PNG, and TIFF. And as with Preview on macOS, there are a number of controls when exporting, such as resolution, embedding text, and saving images as JPEG.</p><p>While there's a lot you can do here, the biggest strength I see for this mobile Preview app is using it as a tool for legal documents. If you need to sign an important document, you can quickly scan it into the app, add your signature, fill out any information—perhaps automatically with AutoFill—then email the doc out, all without needing to jump to your computer.</p><h2 id=\"preview-on-ios-is-still-a-work-in-progress\">Preview on iOS is still a work in progress</h2><p>If you look at <a href=\"https://apps.apple.com/us/app/preview/id536344167?platform=iphone\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"open in a new window\">Preview's App Store page</a>, you'll notice some mixed reviews. After using the app for a bit, I understand why. Preview for iOS is definitely still a work in progress and in need of some key upgrades.</p><div>\n            <p><span>\n                What do you think so far?\n            </span>\n        </p></div>\n<p>The biggest quirks I noticed immediately: The main menu page is cluttered, with the Files integration looking more like a glitch than a dedicated window. Speaking of Files, Apple made the decision to have documents in Files open in Preview. At first, that sounds like a good idea, until you experience it in person on both iOS and iPadOS. Being dragged out of the Files app when you're not expecting it is jarring, especially when you're used to viewing your docs directly in the app. </p><p>The workaround here is to avoid Files for opening, well, files. Use the Files integration within Preview, so you stay in the same app. How intuitive. You could also choose to delete the Preview app, but that's a bit of a shame when it's such a major update for iOS and iPadOS 26.</p><p>Also, when you choose the Markup option, there's no clear way to exit without closing the whole app first. As far as I can tell, the only way to do so is to tap the three-dots in the top right, then tap Markup to exit this menu. The Markup button should really stay on screen as it does on macOS, so it's obvious how to dismiss it.    </p>\n            </article>\n    </div>\n<div>\n    <div>\n        <p><span>The Download Newsletter</span>\n            <span>Never miss a tech story</span>\n        </p>\n        <p><img src=\"https://lifehacker.com/images/team/Jake.png\" alt=\"Jake Peterson portrait\" />\n            <span>Jake Peterson\n            </span>\n            <span>Senior tech editor</span>\n        </p>\n        <p><span>Get the latest tech news, <span></span>reviews, <span></span>and advice from Jake and the team.</span>\n    </p></div>\n    <div>\n        <p><span>The Download Newsletter</span>\n            <span><span>Never miss a tech story.</span> Get the latest tech news, <span></span>reviews, <span></span>and advice from Jake and the team.</span>\n        </p>\n    </div>\n</div>\n    </div>\n            <div>\n                <p><span>\n                        Keep Scrolling for Next Article\n                    </span>\n                </p>\n            </div>\n        </div>"

Apple can keep adding new features and designs with each new smartphone iteration, but if the company just announced a new iPhone with record-breaking battery life, customers would be thrilled. </p><p>While we may have to wait for a time when the iPhone can go a couple days in between charges, Apple has added a new option to iOS 26 in an effort to help extend your iPhone's battery life. The feature, Adaptive Power, uses on-device AI to analyze your iPhone usage and guess the times you'll need additional battery life. This is exactly how I want to see AI being used—not for generating <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/tech/you-are-not-prepared-for-this-new-wave-of-ai-generated-videos\" target=\"_blank\">hyper-realistic videos</a> or <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/tech/spotify-ai-music-policies\" target=\"_blank\">musical slop</a>. </p><div>\n        <p><img src=\"https://lifehacker.com/images/short-lifehacker-logo.jpg\" alt=\"Lifehacker Logo\" /></p><div>\n            <p><span>You May Also Like</span></p>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n<h2 id=\"how-adaptive-power-tries-to-boost-your-battery\">How Adaptive Power tries to boost your battery</h2><div><p>When Adaptive Power decides it's time to engage, the feature can adjust your iPhone's performance level. This will make some tasks take longer than they normally would, but that slower speed supposedly saves on battery life. In addition, Adaptive Power lowers screen brightness by 3%, limits background activity, and, when your iPhone reaches 20%, kicks on Low Power Mode without asking you first. </p><p>Apple isn't totally clear here about the difference between Low Power Mode and Adaptive Power in general. From what we know, it seems that Adaptive Power simply reduces processing speeds at select intervals, and only slightly lowers brightness, while Low Power Mode slows speeds and display refresh rate, and limits brightness, 5G, iCloud syncing, and mail fetch, among other tasks.  </p></div><p>Adaptive Power is enabled by default on Apple's newest iPhones, including the iPhone 17, iPhone 17 Pro, iPhone 17 Pro Max, and iPhone Air—the latter of which <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/tech/extend-iphone-air-battery-life\" target=\"_blank\">could most likely benefit from such a feature</a>. For all other compatible iPhones, which includes iPhone 15 Pro and newer, the feature is turned off by default. That means, unless you have an iPhone 17 device, you'll need to turn this on yourself.</p><div>\n            <p><span>\n                What do you think so far?\n            </span>\n        </p></div>\n<h2 id=\"how-to-turn-adaptive-power-on-or-off\">How to turn Adaptive Power on or off</h2><p>Whether you have an iPhone 15 Pro or an iPhone 17, you'll find the controls for Adaptive Power in the same place. Open Settings, then head to <strong>Battery > Power Mode</strong>. Here, you can tap the toggle next to \"Adaptive Power\" to turn the setting on or off. </p><p>Since Adaptive Power turns on and off throughout the day, Apple also offers you the option to receive alerts whenever the feature is active. You can adjust this setting from the \"Adaptive Power Notifications\" toggle.</p><p>I've been using Adaptive Power since <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/tech/when-ios-26-will-release\" target=\"_blank\">iOS 26 dropped on Sept. 15</a>, but it's tough to say whether the feature has had a noticeable impact on my battery life. I think it would help if Apple added Adaptive Power information to my battery stats, so I could compare the impacts before and after using the feature. For now, I'll continue using it, if for no other reason than to offer my battery the best possible chance of making it through the day without its charger. </p>\n            </article>\n    </div>\n<div>\n    <div>\n        <p><span>The Download Newsletter</span>\n            <span>Never miss a tech story</span>\n        </p>\n        <p><img src=\"https://lifehacker.com/images/team/Jake.png\" alt=\"Jake Peterson portrait\" />\n            <span>Jake Peterson\n            </span>\n            <span>Senior tech editor</span>\n        </p>\n        <p><span>Get the latest tech news, <span></span>reviews, <span></span>and advice from Jake and the team.</span>\n    </p></div>\n    <div>\n        <p><span>The Download Newsletter</span>\n            <span><span>Never miss a tech story.</span> Get the latest tech news, <span></span>reviews, <span></span>and advice from Jake and the team.</span>\n        </p>\n    </div>\n</div>\n    </div>\n            <div>\n                <p><span>\n                        Keep Scrolling for Next Article\n                    </span>\n                </p>\n            </div>\n        </div>"

As of Monday, iOS 26.1 is officially in beta testing, which means developers and public testers can try out Apple's next update early. </p><p>\"Point updates\" like iOS 26.1 are never as feature-filled as the main releases, though 26.1 seems particularly small in scope. Apple seems to have done most of what it planned to do with iOS 26, saving just smaller changes for this upcoming update. Still, there are some interesting new additions in this latest beta, and more could come in subsequent releases. Here's what's new.</p><div>\n        <p><img src=\"https://lifehacker.com/images/short-lifehacker-logo.jpg\" alt=\"Lifehacker Logo\" /></p><div>\n            <p><span>You May Also Like</span></p>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n<h2 id=\"apple-music-gestures\">Apple Music gestures</h2><p>If you want to skip a song in Apple Music, you hit the forward button. If you want to get back to the previous song, or restart the current song, you hit the back button. With iOS 26.1, however, you'll have the option to swipe to switch between songs. </p><p>In the current beta, you can swipe right and left on the Now Playing bar to switch back and forth through your queue. With it, Apple has removed the skip forward button from the Now Playing bar. (The back button wasn't present.) It's a small but cool feature, but one that might take a little time to get used to.</p><blockquote>\n    <a href=\"https://twitter.com/BetaProfiles/status/1970499981493833985\" title=\"open in a new window\" target=\"_blank\">\n        This Tweet is currently unavailable. It might be loading or has been removed.\n    </a>\n</blockquote>\n<h2 id=\"video-playback-bar\">Video playback bar</h2><p>In the current version of iOS 26, the video playback bar in the Photos app is flush with the UI. You might love or hate it, but it can be a bit difficult to make it out, depending on the video in question. The play button and mute button, for example, can disappear when iOS can't change their colors to stand out from the background. </p><p>iOS 26.1 beta 1, however, introduces a new video playback bar that is separate from the UI. It looks good, and is easy to see at all times. Again, a small change, but a smart one.</p><blockquote>\n    <a href=\"https://twitter.com/BetaProfiles/status/1970204922751971838\" title=\"open in a new window\" target=\"_blank\">\n        This Tweet is currently unavailable.

So long as you have an iPhone 15 Pro or newer, as well as AirPods Pro 2, AirPods Pro 3, or AirPods 5 with Active Noise Cancellation, you've been able to try it out since iOS 26's launch.  </p><p>Apple initially rolled out support for French, German, Portuguese (Brazil), and Spanish (Spain), but plans to expand the list in the future. With iOS 26.1, it adds four new options, including:</p><ul><li><p>Chinese (Mandarin, simplified)</p></li><li><p>Chinese (Mandarin, traditional)</p></li><li><p>Italian</p></li><li><p>Japanese</p></li><li><p>Korean</p></li></ul><h2 id=\"eight-new-languages-for-apple-intelligence\">Eight new languages for Apple Intelligence</h2><p>Users with an iPhone 15 Pro and newer, listen up: Apple Intelligence supports eight new languages in iOS 26.1. As of this first beta, that includes the following: </p><div>\n            <p><span>\n                What do you think so far?\n            </span>\n        </p></div>\n<ul><li><p>Chinese (traditional)</p></li><li><p>Danish</p></li><li><p>Dutch</p></li><li><p>Norwegian</p></li><li><p>Portuguese (Portugal)</p></li><li><p>Swedish</p></li><li><p>Turkish</p></li><li><p>Vietnamese</p></li></ul><h2 id=\"liquid-glass-comes-to-the-phones-keypad\">Liquid Glass comes to the Phone's keypad</h2><p><a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/tech/how-to-undo-iphone-ios-26-liquid-glass\" target=\"_blank\">Liquid Glass</a>, Apple's new design language, isn't <em>everywhere </em>in iOS 26. While much of the UI now has a glassy look, some elements still look like iOS 18 and earlier. The Phone app's keypad was one such example: While the app itself is <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/tech/ios-26-missed-call-reminders\" target=\"_blank\">very much changed</a> with this update, switch to the keypad, and it looks the same as ever. </p><p>That changes with iOS 26.1. The beta brings Liquid Glass to the keypad, which, while consistent with most of iOS 26's design, does reduce the visibility of the keys a bit, especially in light mode. I wouldn't be surprised to see Apple workshop this one a bit. </p><blockquote>\n    <a href=\"https://twitter.com/BetaProfiles/status/1970197002941321667\" title=\"open in a new window\" target=\"_blank\">\n        This Tweet is currently unavailable.

Some watches offer notification support, but most simply don't jive well with iOS. </p><p>That might be changing in the future. <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/tech/apple-might-support-third-party-smartwatches\" target=\"_blank\">Code within the iOS 26.1 beta</a> references a new \"Notification Forwarding\" feature, that might allow you to choose a third-party device to send your iPhone alerts to. In addition, an unfinished \"AccessoryExtension\" option might be the framework that lets you pair a third-party watch to your iPhone.</p><p>These are just references in code, not something that you can actively test out in the 26.1 beta, but it's worth noting. Apple is experimenting with supporting third-party watches on iOS, though it could just be to appease the EU's \"Digital Markets Act.\"  </p>\n            </article>\n    </div>\n<div>\n    <div>\n        <p><span>The Download Newsletter</span>\n            <span>Never miss a tech story</span>\n        </p>\n        <p><img src=\"https://lifehacker.com/images/team/Jake.png\" alt=\"Jake Peterson portrait\" />\n            <span>Jake Peterson\n            </span>\n            <span>Senior tech editor</span>\n        </p>\n        <p><span>Get the latest tech news, <span></span>reviews, <span></span>and advice from Jake and the team.</span>\n    </p></div>\n    <div>\n        <p><span>The Download Newsletter</span>\n            <span><span>Never miss a tech story.</span> Get the latest tech news, <span></span>reviews, <span></span>and advice from Jake and the team.</span>\n        </p>\n    </div>\n</div>\n    </div>\n            <div>\n                <p><span>\n                        Keep Scrolling for Next Article\n                    </span>\n                </p>\n            </div>\n        </div>\n    </div>"

/><p><a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/family/finals-study-methods\" target=\"_blank\">Study methods</a> are usually all about what you can do in your own time to maximize what you learn and that's generally most important, but bringing someone else in to your process can be helpful if done correctly, too. That’s what Richard Feynman, a theoretical physicist, thought—at least in theory. According to many possibly apocryphal sources, the Nobel Prize-winner once said, “If you cannot explain something in simple terms, you don’t understand it. The best way to learn is to teach.” </p><p>It’s entirely possible Feynman never said that at all. <a href=\"https://improbable.com/2022/03/23/explaining-why-spin-1-2-particles-obey-fermi-dirac-statistics/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"open in a new window\">The closest documented quote I could find</a>, courtesy of his colleague and fellow physicist David Goodstein, stated that Feynman’s inability to break a subject (in this case, a complex question of particle physics) down to the level a freshman student could understand it meant that <em>science</em> didn’t effectively understand it. </p><div>\n        <p><img src=\"https://lifehacker.com/images/short-lifehacker-logo.jpg\" alt=\"Lifehacker Logo\" /></p><div>\n            <p><span>You May Also Like</span></p>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n<p>But whether this study method truly came from Feynman or not, the basic principle—to know you truly understand a subject, you should be able to teach it to someone else—is pretty sound. Here’s how the Feynman study method works and how you can use it to master new concepts (just maybe not particle physics, apparently).</p><h2 id=\"what-is-the-feynman-method\">What is the Feynman method?</h2><p>The Feynman study technique is so popular for learning and retaining information that it’s <a href=\"https://www.colorado.edu/artssciences-advising/resource-library/life-skills/the-feynman-technique-in-academic-coaching\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"open in a new window\">recommended to college students</a> and even r<a href=\"https://todoist.com/inspiration/feynman-technique\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"open in a new window\">eal-world professionals</a>. It’s a four-step technique that should, when practiced correctly, help you fully grasp the content you’re studying. Here are the steps involved:</p><ol><li><p>Identify exactly what material you need to learn (to do that, try using a method like <a href=\"https://www.lifehacker.com/use-the-kwl-study-method-to-learn-more-1850786565\" target=\"_blank\">KWL</a> or <a href=\"https://www.lifehacker.com/use-the-sq3r-method-to-study-more-effectively-1850780175\" target=\"_blank\">SQ3R</a> to determine  which parts of the topic are most critical before you even get started), and then study it on your own using the methods that have proven most effective for you. I recommend the <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/leitner-system-flashcard-studying\" target=\"_blank\">Leitner flashcard method</a> for vocabulary words and simple question-and-answer problems. Then, try <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/two-ways-to-use-the-blurting-method-to-study-1850999140\" target=\"_blank\">blurting</a>, where you write down everything you can remember about the topic before checking it against your materials to see what you missed. </p></li><li><p>Once you feel comfortable with the material, teach it to someone else—ideally someone who has never studied it. Explain the material as though you were doing so to a total neophyte (Feynman advises to imagine talking to a child), as thoroughly and as straightforwardly as possible. </p></li><li><p>Return to your source material whenever you come across an element you have difficulty explaining in detail.</p></li><li><p>Rewrite and streamline your notes, breaking down complex topics into simpler parts, and further clarifying the topic until you reach a level of granularity that seems almost <em>too</em> basic.</p></li></ol><p>Step 2 isn't as simple as it seems, though. You need a pretty willing participant for this and they should ask questions while you teach them. Questions are crucial because the other person may come up with ones you didn't think of while studying the material and a back-and-forth dialogue can help you make connections between concepts in your brain. Don't treat this as though you're standing in front of them giving a lecture. Rather, turn it more into a real conversation where you're presenting the material, but they're also participating. If they ask something you can't answer, head to Step 3, look it up, and then go back to them with the details. </p><h2 id=\"how-the-feynman-method-works\">How the Feynman method works</h2><p>The most important element of this technique is in dissecting and simplifying the material until you feel like you could explain it all to a child. As the story from Goodstein above reveals, Feynman believed if you couldn’t reduce a topic to information comprehensible to a young student, <em>you</em> didn’t really<em> </em>understand it. (A similar quote has also been attributed to Albert Einstein, so consider it a pedagogical philosophy with legs—though <a href=\"https://www.famousscientists.org/einstein-did-not-say-that/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"open in a new window\">there’s no proof Einstein actually said anything of the sort,</a> either.)</p><div>\n            <p><span>\n                What do you think so far?\n            </span>\n        </p></div>\n<p>It works fine if you choose an adult who is unfamiliar with the topic to teach it to. The idea is just for you to simplify it to a child's level of understanding, but you'll probably get more substantive feedback if you actually do the discussion with an adult. Maybe they’ll ask a question you can’t answer, or help you find connections between ideas. Maybe their unique perspectives and experiences will inform their understanding of this new material and launch some groundbreaking revelations for you. Who's to say? This feedback will help you as you move to the third step of reviewing your materials, as it will give you additional things to consider as you do so. </p><p>When you’re done refining your notes further, try teaching the topic to someone else again, or moving on to another technique, <a href=\"https://www.lifehacker.com/use-distributed-practice-to-better-retain-what-you-st-1850808691\" target=\"_blank\">like distributed practice</a> or <a href=\"https://www.lifehacker.com/overlearning-can-force-important-information-into-your-1850797539\" target=\"_blank\">overlearning</a>, where you’ll study your simplified notes periodically until you fully grasp the material.</p><h2 id=\"feynman-when-no-one-else-is-around\">Feynman when no one else is around</h2><p>It's a nice idea to imagine you could call up your mom or best friend to Feynman it out every time you have a big test coming, but realistically, that's probably not possible. If you can't find anyone with whom to practice this technique, turn to AI. Language models like <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/the-best-ways-to-study-but-not-cheat-using-ai-tools\" target=\"_blank\">ChatGPT are great study helpers</a> when used correctly. </p><p>Instruct the chatbot to act like it's totally unfamiliar with the subject, then type everything you can remember about it into the text-entry box, as though you were using the blurting method. Ask if the AI has any questions and go from there. I've done this and actually just told the bot I was using the Feynman method, which it understood, and it worked just as well as talking to a human being, although it felt a little weirder. Fire up ChatGPT before a big test in case of emergency.</p>\n            </article>\n    </div>\n<div>\n    <div>\n        <p><span>The Daily Newsletter</span>\n            <span>Ready to do everything better?</span>\n        </p>\n        <p><img src=\"https://lifehacker.com/images/team/Jordan.png\" alt=\"Jordan Calhoun portrait\" />\n            <span>Jordan Calhoun\n            </span>\n            <span>Editor in chief</span>\n        </p>\n        <p><span><span>Get daily tips, tricks, <span>and tech guides</span></span> <span>from Jordan and the team.</span></span>\n    </p></div>\n    <div>\n        <p><span>The Daily Newsletter</span>\n            <span><span>Ready to do everything better?</span> <span>Get daily tips, tricks, <span>and tech guides</span></span> <span>from Jordan and the team.</span></span>\n        </p>\n    </div>\n</div>\n    </div>\n            <div>\n                <p><span>\n                        Keep Scrolling for Next Article\n                    </span>\n                </p>\n            </div>\n        </div>\n    </div>"

Oct. 7 to Wednesday, Oct. 8. Lifehacker's Prime Day expert <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/author/danieloropeza\" target=\"_blank\">Daniel Oropeza</a> explains all the <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/money/everything-you-need-to-know-about-october-prime-big-deals-day-2025\" target=\"_blank\">details you need to know about the event</a>. </p><p>As you're scouring for the best deals, one payment option you'll want to reconsider is \"<a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/money/dont-use-buy-now-pay-later-for-prime-day-purchases\" target=\"_blank\"><u>buy now, pay later</u></a>\" financing.</p><div>\n        <p><img src=\"https://lifehacker.com/images/short-lifehacker-logo.jpg\" alt=\"Lifehacker Logo\" /></p><div>\n            <p><span>You May Also Like</span></p>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n<p>Last year Apple discontinued its own take on “buy now, pay later” (BNPL), called \"Apple Pay Later.\" The service may no longer be available in <em>name</em>, but BNPL purchases are readily available when you check out with Apple Pay. So, what exactly has changed about paying with installments via Apple Pay, and what sets it apart from other BNPL programs—for better or for worse? </p><h2 id=\"what-is-buy-now-pay-later\">What is “buy now, pay later?”</h2><p>A “buy now, pay later” service is exactly what it sounds like: You can make a purchase immediately, and then pay for it through a series of installments over time. Although BNPL has some perks for breaking up a major expense, there are risks involved. Even if these loans have little to no interest, you are still taking on debt. And while BNPL plans don’t directly impact users’ credit scores at the moment, that's set to change. Coming this fall, <a href=\"https://investors.fico.com/news-releases/news-release-details/fico-unveils-groundbreaking-credit-scores-incorporate-buy-now\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"open in a new window\">FICO says</a> it will start including BNPL payment histories in how it calculates credit scores. If you're at risk of not getting your BNPL payments in according to schedule, you'll be putting your credit score at risk, too.</p><p>Any personal finance writer with a semblance of a conscience <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/what-to-know-before-using-buy-now-pay-later-financing-1844945584\" target=\"_blank\">will advise against</a> making a habit of using these services. They can be helpful if you really need to finance something big, but whenever possible, it’s best to avoid taking on debt for everyday expenses.</p><h2 id=\"how-can-you-pay-with-installments-using-apple-pay\">How can you pay with installments using Apple Pay?</h2><p>The official \"Apple Pay Later\" is no more, but Apple Pay still includes BNPL options. Major BNPL providers like <a href=\"https://www.affirm.com/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"open in a new window\">Affirm,</a> <a href=\"https://www.afterpay.com/en-US\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"open in a new window\">Afterpay,</a> and <a href=\"https://www.klarna.com/us/payments/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"open in a new window\">Klarna</a> have partnered with Apple to offer their services directly through Apple Pay.</p><h3>How to set up BNPL with Apple Pay</h3><p>The setup process varies slightly depending on your BNPL provider:</p><p><strong>For Klarna:</strong></p><ol><li><p>Download the Klarna app and create an account.</p></li><li><p>Complete the verification process.</p></li><li><p>In the Klarna app, look for the option to add to Apple Wallet.</p></li><li><p>Follow the prompts to add your Klarna card to Apple Pay.</p></li></ol><p><strong>For Affirm:</strong></p><div>\n            <p><span>\n                What do you think so far?\n            </span>\n        </p></div>\n<ol><li><p>Create an Affirm account through their app or website.</p></li><li><p>Get pre-qualified for spending limits, up to $30,000.</p></li><li><p>Add the Affirm virtual card to your Apple Wallet.</p></li><li><p>Use it like any other payment method in Apple Pay.</p></li></ol><p><strong>For Afterpay:</strong></p><ol><li><p>Download the Afterpay app and set up your account.</p></li><li><p>Link a debit or credit card for your installment payments.</p></li><li><p>Afterpay should pop up directly at checkout when using Apple Pay.</p></li></ol><p>When you make a purchase using BNPL through Apple Pay, the total amount is automatically divided into your installment plan. Your first installment is typically charged immediately, while the BNPL company pays the merchant the full amount. All your subsequent installments are automatically charged to your linked payment method according to schedule.</p><h2 id=\"the-risks-of-bnpl-programs\">The risks of BNPL programs</h2><p>Naturally, Apple users may be drawn to the convenience of a BNPL options during Apple Pay checkout. However, that convenience might just be the biggest risk. They can make it all too easy to spend more than you can actually afford. The <a href=\"https://www.consumerfinance.gov/about-us/newsroom/cfpb-publishes-new-findings-on-financial-profiles-of-buy-now-pay-later-borrowers/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"open in a new window\">Consumer Financial Protection Bureau released a report</a> that shows BNPL users were more likely to have higher credit card debt, delinquencies on other credit products, and lower credit scores than non-users.</p><h2 id=\"the-bottom-line\">The bottom line</h2><p>If you are going to use any BNPL service, keep these tips in mind:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Think about your current and future budget.</strong> When a bigger payment gets broken down into smaller installments, you might find yourself overspending in the long run because it \"feels\" like you can afford it. Stay on top of how much you’re actually spending, and how it will impact your overall budget going forward.</p></li><li><p><strong>Stick to the essentials.</strong> BNPL should really only be used on completely necessary purchases that you can’t afford upfront, but can afford in six weeks. </p></li><li><p><strong>Keep an eye on your account balance.</strong> Klarna, Affirm, or an BNPL service are not credit cards. Even if Apple doesn’t charge fees for missed payments, your bank will still charge you overdraft fees. Plus, if you default on a BNPL loan, you’re at risk of damaging your credit score.</p></li></ul><p>The most important thing is that you know what you're doing. Before you pay for anything in installments, be thoughtful about why you’re taking on this debt in the first place.</p>\n            </article>\n    </div>\n<div>\n    <div>\n        <p><span>The Daily Newsletter</span>\n            <span>Ready to do everything better?</span>\n        </p>\n        <p><img src=\"https://lifehacker.com/images/team/Jordan.png\" alt=\"Jordan Calhoun portrait\" />\n            <span>Jordan Calhoun\n            </span>\n            <span>Editor in chief</span>\n        </p>\n        <p><span><span>Get daily tips, tricks, <span>and tech guides</span></span> <span>from Jordan and the team.</span></span>\n    </p></div>\n    <div>\n        <p><span>The Daily Newsletter</span>\n            <span><span>Ready to do everything better?</span> <span>Get daily tips, tricks, <span>and tech guides</span></span> <span>from Jordan and the team.</span></span>\n        </p>\n    </div>\n</div>\n    </div>\n            <div>\n                <p><span>\n                        Keep Scrolling for Next Article\n                    </span>\n                </p>\n            </div>\n        </div>\n    </div>"

So, I'm here to make sure your next international trip is a bit easier. </p><div>\n        <p><img src=\"https://lifehacker.com/images/short-lifehacker-logo.jpg\" alt=\"Lifehacker Logo\" /></p><div>\n            <p><span>You May Also Like</span></p>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n<h2 id=\"translate-text-with-your-iphones-camera\">Translate text with your iPhone's camera </h2><p>The next time you need to translate some text in front of you, instead of heading for Google Translate, Microsoft Translator, or even Apple's own Translate app, just open your Camera app. Frame up the text in the middle of the viewfinder and give your iPhone a moment to \"think.\" If all goes well, you should see a yellow frame appear around the text, and a new button appear in the bottom right of the viewfinder—or top right, if you're holding your iPhone in landscape. </p><p>Tap this button, and iOS will cut out the selected text, and zoom in to bring it into focus. Now, tap the \"Translate\" button that appears in the bottom left (or top left in landscape), wait a moment, and presto: The text is replaced by your target language. As you might guess, for me, that's English, but the feature will translate into whichever system language your iPhone is currently set to.</p><div>\n    <p><img src=\"https://lifehacker.com/imagery/articles/01K60TCH66X4WWW8DBDV6P4GMC/images-1.fill.size_2000x1125.v1758820823.png\" alt=\"translating within the camera app\" srcset=\"https://lifehacker.com/imagery/articles/01K60TCH66X4WWW8DBDV6P4GMC/images-1.fill.size_800x450.v1758820823.png 800w, https://lifehacker.com/imagery/articles/01K60TCH66X4WWW8DBDV6P4GMC/images-1.fill.size_1400x788.v1758820823.png 1400w, https://lifehacker.com/imagery/articles/01K60TCH66X4WWW8DBDV6P4GMC/images-1.fill.size_2000x1125.v1758820823.png 2000w\" />\n            </p>\n            <p><span></span>\n                                        <span>Credit: Lifehacker</span>\n                    </p>\n    </div>\n<p>For many applications, this translation is enough. But there's more you can do with this. If you need to share that translated text somewhere, you can tap the translation to pull up a Translate mini window. Here, you can copy the translation so you can paste it wherever you'd like. You'll also be able to have iOS read either the translation or original text out loud, add the translation to your favorites, or open the translation in the Translate app. </p><p>This hidden perk is part of the iPhone's larger <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/how-to-use-live-text-the-best-new-feature-in-ios-15-1847649795\" target=\"_blank\">Live Text feature</a>, which uses OCR (optical character recognition) to identify text in images. Live Text allows you to select text both in images and within the camera's viewfinder for easy copy and pasting. And, since iOS 16, it allows you to translate that text directly within the camera as well. Since it's powered by the Translate app, it supports the languages the app does, which includes:</p><div>\n            <p><span>\n                What do you think so far?\n            </span>\n        </p></div>\n<ul><li><p>Arabic</p></li><li><p>Chinese (Mandarin, Simplified)</p></li><li><p>Chinese (Mandarin, Traditional)</p></li><li><p>Dutch</p></li><li><p>English (UK)</p></li><li><p>French</p></li><li><p>German</p></li><li><p>Hindi</p></li><li><p>Indonesian</p></li><li><p>Italian</p></li><li><p>Japanese</p></li><li><p>Korean</p></li><li><p>Polish</p></li><li><p>Portuguese (Brazil)</p></li><li><p>Russian</p></li><li><p>Spanish (Spain)</p></li><li><p>Thai</p></li><li><p>Turkish</p></li><li><p>Ukrainian</p></li><li><p>Vietnamese </p></li></ul><p>If this feature isn't working for you, it's likely not turned on. To check, head to <strong>Settings > Camera</strong>, then ensure \"Show Detected Text\" is enabled. </p><h2 id=\"other-ways-to-translate-on-iphone\">Other ways to translate on iPhone</h2><p>This is far from the only way to translate other languages on your iPhone. As previously mentioned, iOS comes with a built-in Translate app, which has its own Camera function as well. But with iOS 26, there's a new translation feature that works seamlessly as you use your iPhone: <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/tech/apple-live-translation-messages-facetime-and-your-phone-calls-wwdc-2025\" target=\"_blank\">Live Translate</a>. </p><p>As the name suggests, Live Translate can translate conversations in real time. This works in Messages with text, but also during FaceTime and phone calls when talking to someone in another language. If you have a compatible pair of AirPods, <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/tech/you-dont-need-to-buy-airpods-pro-3-to-use-live-translation\" target=\"_blank\">you can even use this feature when talking to someone in person</a>: You'll hear their words translated in your ears, and they'll see your words translated on your iPhone's display.</p>\n            </article>\n    </div>\n<div>\n    <div>\n        <p><span>The Download Newsletter</span>\n            <span>Never miss a tech story</span>\n        </p>\n        <p><img src=\"https://lifehacker.com/images/team/Jake.png\" alt=\"Jake Peterson portrait\" />\n            <span>Jake Peterson\n            </span>\n            <span>Senior tech editor</span>\n        </p>\n        <p><span>Get the latest tech news, <span></span>reviews, <span></span>and advice from Jake and the team.</span>\n    </p></div>\n    <div>\n        <p><span>The Download Newsletter</span>\n            <span><span>Never miss a tech story.</span> Get the latest tech news, <span></span>reviews, <span></span>and advice from Jake and the team.</span>\n        </p>\n    </div>\n</div>\n    </div>\n            <div>\n                <p><span>\n                        Keep Scrolling for Next Article\n                    </span>\n                </p>\n            </div>\n        </div>\n    </div>"

The new \"<a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/tech/how-to-undo-iphone-ios-26-liquid-glass\" target=\"_blank\">Liquid Glass</a>\" design, while controversial, offers the first major UI overhaul since iOS 7, while <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/tech/the-best-five-ios-26-features\" target=\"_blank\">new features</a> like call screening and hold assist might change the way your make and receive phone calls. </p><p>If you have an iPhone, you may be tempted to install the new update—and, seeing as it has been out for a week and a half now, you might have updated already. If you haven't installed iOS 26, yet, however, think twice before you do, because you're going to be stuck with it: Apple has made it impossible to downgrade and return to iOS 18.</p><h2 id=\"you-cant-go-back-to-ios-18\">You can't go back to iOS 18</h2><p><a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/09/22/apple-stops-signing-ios-18-6-2/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"open in a new window\">As reported by MacRumors</a>, Apple stopped \"signing\" iOS 18.6.2 on Monday. When Apple signs a particular piece of software, it means you can download that software to your compatible device. Apple stops signing software shortly after it releases a new version. It's a system meant to block users from installing old software versions on their Apple devices, intended to protect those users from insecurities in operating systems that haven't been patched.</p><div>\n        <p><img src=\"https://lifehacker.com/images/short-lifehacker-logo.jpg\" alt=\"Lifehacker Logo\" /></p><div>\n            <p><span>You May Also Like</span></p>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n<p>As such, now that iOS 18.6.2 is no longer being signed, there is no way to downgrade to that software version from iOS 26 if you change your mind. Though the process was tedious, previously, <a href=\"https://x.com/badboychadhoy/status/1970549101973418116\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"open in a new window\">you could downgrade from iOS 26</a> by putting your iPhone in recovery mode, erasing it completely, and installing a new version of 18.6.2. Now that Apple has stopped signing 18.6.2, however, there's no way to install it, so a factory reset will only leave you with an iPhone running iOS 26, and none of your data.</p><div>\n            <p><span>\n                What do you think so far?\n            </span>\n        </p></div>\n<p>You might be wondering why you can't downgrade to iOS 18.7, since that's a newer version of iOS 18 than 18.6.2. <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-stops-signing-ios-18-6-2-ios-26-downgrades-now-impossible.2467148/post-34169189\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"open in a new window\">As users on the MacRumors forum point out</a>, you need an IPSW file in order to downgrade your iPhone, but Apple hasn't provided an IPSW file with iOS 18.7, as that update is only available over the air for uses already running iOS 18. That is to say: Unless your iPhone is already running 18.6.2, you can't install iOS 18.7.  </p><p>If you haven't updated your iPhone yet, you have two options. First, there's nothing<em> forcing </em>you to install iOS 26 on your device. You can keep running iOS 18.6.2 or iOS 18.7 as long as you want, and take advantage of any future security updates Apple provides to keep your iPhone protected. Alternately, you can go ahead and install iOS 26, with the understanding that you won't have the option to undo it—<a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/tech/how-to-undo-iphone-ios-26-liquid-glass\" target=\"_blank\">though you will be able to undo many of the UI changes</a>, at least. And if your main concern is performance and <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/tech/extend-iphone-air-battery-life\" target=\"_blank\">battery life</a>, it might be smart to wait for iOS 26.1, which is currently in beta testing. </p>\n            </article>\n    </div>\n<div>\n    <div>\n        <p><span>The Download Newsletter</span>\n            <span>Never miss a tech story</span>\n        </p>\n        <p><img src=\"https://lifehacker.com/images/team/Jake.png\" alt=\"Jake Peterson portrait\" />\n            <span>Jake Peterson\n            </span>\n            <span>Senior tech editor</span>\n        </p>\n        <p><span>Get the latest tech news, <span></span>reviews, <span></span>and advice from Jake and the team.</span>\n    </p></div>\n    <div>\n        <p><span>The Download Newsletter</span>\n            <span><span>Never miss a tech story.</span> Get the latest tech news, <span></span>reviews, <span></span>and advice from Jake and the team.</span>\n        </p>\n    </div>\n</div>\n    </div>\n            <div>\n                <p><span>\n                        Keep Scrolling for Next Article\n                    </span>\n                </p>\n            </div>\n        </div>"
