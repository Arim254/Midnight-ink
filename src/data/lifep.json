Some of the hottest tricks people have been using lately to save on their travels are websites that let you buy other people's non-refundable vacations, from flights to hotels to cruises. If this sounds like your vibe, buckle up. </p><p>Here are some of the best travel websites you can use to snag your next trip on the cheap.</p><h2 id=\"google-flights-explore-tool\">Google Flights' explore tool</h2><p>I expect most people to know this one, but I have to start the list somewhere. For those who might not know, Google Flights has an <a href=\"https://www.google.com/travel/explore\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"open in a new window\">“explore” tool</a> where you see a map of your potential destinations from your local airport and their prices. This is great when you don't have a specific destination in mind but want to get away and see where you could potentially travel to. You can scroll through the planet and find some bargains that you might've never seen otherwise. </p><p><strong>Quick tip</strong>: If you have a budget, use the filters on the top left to set it and see where you can afford to travel to around the world. </p><h2 id=\"use-skyscanner-to-find-the-cheapest-flights\">Use Skyscanner to find the cheapest flights</h2><p>Yes, Google Flights is more user-friendly and has cool features, but if you mean business and are looking for the <em>cheapest </em>flight options you can find, <a href=\"https://www.skyscanner.net/flights\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"open in a new window\">Skyscanner</a> is what you want to use. Here, you’ll find flights that will not even appear on Google Flights, and it even has an <a href=\"https://www.skyscanner.net/transport/flights-from/atla/?oym=2506\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"open in a new window\">explore-like</a> tool similar to Google’s where you simply input your local airport, select “whole month” for dates, and click “search” to find all the possible low-cost destinations for that month (I found a direct flight to Cancun from my home in Atlanta for $183). </p><p>You can catch last-minute flight deals and set alerts for cheap flights as well.</p><h2 id=\"shop-second-hand-vacation-packages-from-people-who-cant-get-refunds\">Shop second-hand vacation packages from people who can't get refunds</h2><p>Imagine you buy a whole package deal for a family vacation months in advance but, like most people, you forego the travel insurance. You have a family emergency and can no longer take the trip. What can you do? Sell your vacation on the internet. </p><p>Websites like Sparefare, Roomer, Plans Change, and Transfer Travel let you buy other people's vacations that they can no longer use themselves. You can both save money and get these people out of a sticky situation. Here's a quick breakdown of your options:</p><h3>TransferTravel</h3><p><a href=\"https://www.transfertravel.com/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"open in a new window\">TransferTravel</a> is like the Facebook Marketplace of travel plans. You can find anything from cruises, to flights, to hotels, events, and more. It's the most wide-ranging of all of these websites that offer transferable travel products. </p><h3>SpareFare</h3><p><a href=\"https://sparefare.net/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"open in a new window\">SpareFare</a> focuses on flight tickets or vouchers, hotel reservations, and holiday packages. You'll be connected directly with the seller to get their non-refundable bookings. SpareFare also helps you manage the name change process for airline tickets, which can get a bit complicated if you do it by yourself.</p><h3>Roomer</h3><p>If you're focusing on finding hotels at a bargain, use <a href=\"https://www.roomertravel.com/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"open in a new window\">Roomer</a>. The website focuses on showing you non-refundable bookings from people desperately trying to recoup any money they can. You can find hotels from all over the world and filter by number of occupants, dates, and location. You might not always find something available where you're staying, but if you do, you'll be a happy camper. </p><div>\n            <p><span>\n                What do you think so far?\n            </span>\n        </p></div>\n<h3>PlansChange</h3><p><a href=\"https://www.planschange.com/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"open in a new window\">PlansChange</a> is exactly like Roomer, but it's smaller in scope and reach. It doesn't hurt to check both when you find yourself looking for a bargain stay.</p><h2 id=\"use-secretflying-to-set-up-alerts-for-their-error-fares\">Use SecretFlying to set up alerts for their “Error Fares”</h2><p>Airlines make mistakes sometimes, and as a savvy traveler, you need to be ready to take advantage of them when you can. <a href=\"https://www.secretflying.com/usa-deals/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"open in a new window\">SecretFlying</a> is a travel deal website that works like many others, but it also has  a special tool to find cheap flights that exist because of mistakes that airlines make. (For example, there was an enticing <a href=\"https://www.secretflying.com/posts/error-fare-chicago-to-london-uk-for-only-58-roundtrip/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"open in a new window\">Chicago to London round-trip for only $58</a> last month.) The error fares go fast, and many might not logistically work for you, but if you ever do catch one of these, you’ll be bragging about it for years to come. </p><h2 id=\"use-the-travel-arrow-extension\">Use the Travel Arrow extension</h2><p>If you're still only using Google Flights to do your searching, you could be missing out on some cheaper options. Travel Arrow is an extension you can install on your browser that will <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/this-chrome-extension-searches-every-airline-booking-si-1850709238\" target=\"_blank\">cross-reference your Google Flight info</a> on Skyscanner, Kayak, Trip, and Expedia (all the major competitors to Google Flights). While it doesn't always work, it's a free tool that will more than pay for itself if you ever end up booking a cheaper flight with it. Keep in mind that some flights might be cheaper because their layovers are longer.</p><h2 id=\"use-these-online-vacation-package-websites\">Use these online vacation package websites</h2><p>There are <em>many</em> websites that sell you travel packages that include flights, hotels, food, tours, and even transportation (rails, buses, taxis, etc.) for <em>much </em>cheaper than you would find if you tried to book each piece individually. The catch is that these packages are typically strict on dates, and their cancellation policies are often less forgiving. <em>But</em> you’ll be able to find amazing deals at locations you might not otherwise be able to afford. </p><p><a href=\"https://www.gate1travel.com/?Brand=GATE1\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"open in a new window\">Gate1</a>, for example, has been around since the '80s—my mom has used it with my dad to visit the eight wonders of the world on a budget over the years. Their best deals come from their <a href=\"https://www.gate1travel.com/featured-specials\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"open in a new window\">weekly specials</a> (you can sign up for their emails) and <a href=\"https://www.gate1travel.com/last-minute-deals\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"open in a new window\">last-minute deals</a> where you can find multi-day trips for big discounts. </p><p>For example, you can do a 13-day Thailand trip for $2,249 with all this included:</p><ul><li><p>Roundtrip flights Los Angeles to Bangkok, or Bangkok to Los Angeles </p></li><li><p>Intra-flight Chiang Mai to Bangkok</p></li><li><p>11 nights First Class accommodations</p></li><li><p>Hotel taxes, fees, service charges, and porterage</p></li><li><p>18 meals: 11 breakfasts, 3 lunches, 4 dinners</p></li><li><p>Sightseeing per itinerary in modern air-conditioned motor coach</p></li><li><p>Services of English-speaking tour manager throughout</p></li><li><p>Entrance fees per itinerary</p></li></ul><p>Here are some other websites similar to Gate1 where you can find great deals on packages for your next trip:</p><ul><li><p><a href=\"https://www.travelpirates.com/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"open in a new window\">TravelPirates</a></p></li><li><p><a href=\"https://www.greatvaluevacations.com/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"open in a new window\">Great Value Vacations</a></p></li><li><p><a href=\"https://www.going.com/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"open in a new window\">Going</a> (formerly Scott’s Cheap Flights)</p></li></ul>\n            </article>"

(More on that below.)</p>\n<p><strong>Entry level porn VR porn viewing, step-by-step</strong></p><ul><li><p><strong>Lock the door.</strong></p></li><li><p><strong>Put on your headset.</strong></p></li><li><p><strong>Click on your web-browser-of-choice</strong></p></li><li><p><strong>Navigate to a site that hosts VR porn. </strong>Free video megasites like Youporn have a VR section, or you can use Google to search something out. Clicking on a video should launch you into VR—but \"should\" is doing a lot of work. These are random files hosted on janky free porn sites, so don't be surprised if you need to do a little trial-and-error to find one that works correctly. </p></li></ul><p>That’s all you need to know to get a taste of the VR porn thing, but because of the massive file sizes of VR video, streaming is likely to be choppy, and free movies are usually not in the highest resolution—again, janky but free. For a better experience, you’re going to have to (gasp) <em>pay</em> for it.</p><hr /><h3>Suggested headsets for VR porn-viewing:</h3><ul><li><p><a href=\"https://zdcs.link/yAyoO?pageview_type=Standard&template=How-To&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=Meta%20Quest%203&short_url=yAyoO&u=https%3A%2F%2Flifehacker.com%2Fhow-to-watch-virtual-reality-porn&event_label=Meta%20Quest%203\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"open in a new window\">Meta Quest 3</a></p></li><li><p><a href=\"https://zdcs.link/zn5nRj?pageview_type=Standard&template=How-To&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=Meta%20Quest%203S&short_url=zn5nRj&u=https%3A%2F%2Flifehacker.com%2Fhow-to-watch-virtual-reality-porn&event_label=Meta%20Quest%203S\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"open in a new window\">Meta Quest 3S</a></p></li><li><p><a href=\"https://zdcs.link/nV4nl?pageview_type=Standard&template=How-To&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=Valve%20Index%20VR%20Full%20Kit&short_url=nV4nl&u=https%3A%2F%2Flifehacker.com%2Fhow-to-watch-virtual-reality-porn&event_label=Valve%20Index%20VR%20Full%20Kit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"open in a new window\">Valve Index VR Full Kit</a></p></li><li><p><a href=\"https://zdcs.link/LvKG0?pageview_type=Standard&template=How-To&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=Meta%20Quest%202&short_url=LvKG0&u=https%3A%2F%2Flifehacker.com%2Fhow-to-watch-virtual-reality-porn&event_label=Meta%20Quest%202\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"open in a new window\">Meta Quest 2</a></p></li><li><p><a href=\"https://zdcs.link/QqX8J3?pageview_type=Standard&template=How-To&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=HTC%20Vive%20Pro%202&short_url=QqX8J3&u=https%3A%2F%2Flifehacker.com%2Fhow-to-watch-virtual-reality-porn&event_label=HTC%20Vive%20Pro%202\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"open in a new window\">HTC Vive Pro 2</a></p></li></ul><hr />\n<p>The above instructions for streaming \"regular\" VR porn work on Meta Quest 3 and 3S headsets, but the \"3 series\" has front-facing pass-through camera arrays that add a new wrinkle to adult content: augmented reality. </p><p>Getting your pass-through-porn on can be fairly complicated, so here's a separate post that goes into detail about how to get <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/tech/how-to-watch-augmented-reality-porn-on-meta-quest-3\" target=\"_blank\">augmented reality porn to work on your Meta Quest 3 and 3S</a>.</p><h2 id=\"how-to-watch-porn-with-an-apple-vision-pro\">How to watch Porn with an Apple Vision Pro</h2><p>Apple's Vision Pro can stream, download, and play “normal” videos (both adult and \"mainstream\") on gigantic virtual reality screens easily through its web browser, but immersive, 3D videos produced specifically for virtual or augmented reality will not work on your Apple Vision Pro's browser. </p><p>Part of the issue is that WebXR, the programming interface for accessing augmented reality and virtual reality devices, is not automatically enabled in the Vision Pro's browser. Not having WebXR enabled means no VR porn, but it also means you won't have access to a slew of non-adult VR and AR content like web-based games, tours, productivity apps, etc. </p><p>Here's how to turn WebXR on:</p><ol><li><p>Open Settings.</p></li><li><p>Select Apps.</p></li><li><p>Select Safari.</p></li><li><p>Scroll to the bottom of the window and select Advanced.</p></li><li><p>Scroll to the bottom of the window and select Feature Flags.</p></li><li><p>Under Experimental XR Features, enable WebXR Device API and WebXR Hand Input Module.</p></li><li><p>Under WebKit Feature Flags, enable WebXR Augmented Reality Module and WebXR GamePads Module.</p></li><li><p>Exit Settings.</p></li><li><p>Open Safari, or if it's already open, refresh a WebXR-enabled page to check it is working.</p></li></ol><p>But even with WebXR enabled, you still can't launch full VR porn videos on an Apple Vision Pro—yet. I spoke to Alex Novac, of VR Porn site SexLikeReal, and he said, \"a lot has been done on our end to make things work with AVP. It's a great tool for videos. Will be making a huge update soon.\"</p><h2 id=\"advanced-vr-porn-viewing\">Advanced VR porn viewing</h2><p>If you've given free sites a chance and found their VR offerings to be lacking, here's how to go deeper in. </p><ul><li><p><strong>Pick a VR website. </strong>Because VR porn is relatively new, more costly to produce, and has a smaller audience than “normal” adult videos, there aren’t an overwhelming number of sites dedicated to it. Most of the ones that are out there have sample videos to view, and some provide single-day access for very cheap. <a href=\"https://chicagoreader.com/adult/vr-porn-sites/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"open in a new window\">This list</a> of the top VR porn sites is a good place to start.</p></li><li><p><strong>Did you lock the door?</strong></p></li><li><p><strong>Open the browser, navigate to your newly chosen site and enter your credit card digits. </strong>Membership fees vary from site to site, but expect a range of $20 to $30 a month. </p></li></ul><p>From here, you can stream full-length videos at very high quality. If you have decent home internet, streaming should work fine for most VR videos, but if your streaming is choppy, you can:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Download and save video to your device</strong>— These videos can be over 10 gigs, so it might take some time. </p></li><li><p><strong>Play the video</strong>—Major VR headsets come with great video browsers, but if you want advanced features, download Skybox for 10 bucks. That way you can save video to your PC and stream from your computer easily. </p></li><li><p><strong>Get the right player</strong>: Some adult VR sites are configured to work best with specific browsers or video players, and you should be directed as to what to install. </p></li></ul><h2 id=\"the-world-of-virtual-reality-enabled-sex-toys\">The world of virtual reality enabled sex toys</h2><p>If you're looking for the <em>most</em> cutting-edge, technologically advanced virtual sex experience, you're going to need some hardware, specifically, a (<strong>NSFW)</strong> <a href=\"https://bedbible.com/vr-sex-toy/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"open in a new window\">virtual reality sex toy</a>.  These devices are designed to vibrate and oscillated in sync with videos, VR content, or to be controlled remotely over the web. </p><p>Among the best-known teledildonic sex toys is <a href=\"https://www.thehandy.com/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"open in a new window\">TheHandy</a>. Funded through <a href=\"https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/ohdoki/the-handy-2-the-1-male-sex-toy-now-even-better\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"open in a new window\">Kickstarter</a>, this \"high-end male stroker\" syncs with everything from videos to VR content. As is usual with these devices, you hook up a Handy, then stream a video from a (<strong>again</strong>, <strong>NSFW)</strong> <a href=\"https://www.sexlikereal.com/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"open in a new window\">VR site like Sexlikereal</a>, and the device will virtually \"connect\" with the movements you're seeing in your headset, using scripts that are either human-made or AI-created. It's definitely immersive and unique, if you can get past the tech-headache of syncing everything together. (Humans aren't entirely obsolete yet, but we're getting there.)  </p><h2 id=\"is-virtual-reality-porn-any-good\">Is virtual reality porn any good?</h2><p>Now that you know how to view porn in virtual reality, you have to ask yourself if you <em>should</em>. Virtual reality’s “you are there” immersion provides an experience that is different from traditional porn. But it’s not necessarily better. Like all things of this nature, it comes down to personal taste. I checked out some VR porn (for research purposes only, of course), and, without going into too much detail, here are the pros and cons:</p><div>\n            <p><span>\n                What do you think so far?\n            </span>\n        </p></div>\n<h3>Pros</h3><p><strong>It's immersive</strong>: The illusion that you're in a room with another person (or <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/tech/how-to-watch-augmented-reality-porn-on-meta-quest-3\" target=\"_blank\">someone else is in your house</a>) is so convincing, it's almost scary at first. If that's what you're looking for from adult content, you'll find it here.</p><p><strong>It's different</strong>: I'm an experiential kind of person, and VR pornography is definitely not like anything else. </p><p><strong>Gender-bending: </strong>Most virtual reality porn is designed for heterosexual men, and shot from their point-of-view, but not all of it. There is VR porn shot from the POV of all genders, and that provides maybe the most unique experience of the genre: putting yourself in the (virtual) skin of someone else. Looking down at yourself and seeing a different male body, (one that doesn’t skip ab day) is strange enough, but looking down and seeing yourself with a differently <em>gendered</em> body is positively freaky in the best possible way. I can only assume this will lead to a new age of empathy and the end of sexism and homophobia. (A girl can dream.)</p><p><strong>It's cutting-edge</strong>: VR porn is a look into the possible future of human sexuality, especially if you're adding in a literal sex machine like The Handy. It's like communing deeply with the robots. You may be thinking, \"but that sounds more creepy than sexy,\" and you have a point.</p><h3>Cons</h3><p><strong>It's weird</strong>: In general, I like weird things, but VR porn can feel strange in a depersonalizing way. Maybe it's the feigned intimacy from the performers, or maybe it's the uncanny feeling of being in two places at once, but there's something about it that ain't <em>natural</em>, and it's a hard feeling to shake. </p><p><strong>It's a hassle:</strong> Experiencing VR porn in full, with as high a resolution video as possible and with the addition of a virtual sex toy, takes a level of technical and personal dedication that might not be worth it to you. It reminds me of slot-car racing—sure, it's a lot of fun, but is it fun enough to warrant dragging out the tracks, setting everything up, making sure the cars are tuned up, etc.? </p><p><strong>Locked-in perspective: </strong>Putting the viewer right up in the action means the camera is locked to a first-person perspective to make it seem like what's happening in the scene is happening to you. If you like that kind of thing, it’s gravy, but if you don’t … well, you gave it a shot.</p><p><strong>The performance: </strong>The camera/you are <em>very</em> close to the performers in most VR porn videos. The illusion is fairly convincing, but actually <em>selling</em> that kind of intimacy requires acting talent. It’s a different kind of performing than film or stage, and, at the risk of being negative, many pornographic performers don’t have the chops to pull it off, so it can just feel weird—and not sexy-weird, either. Again, your mileage may vary.</p><p><strong>Limited content: </strong>Because it is more expensive and more difficult to shoot VR video, and because there is a smaller audience, it seems like almost all VR porn is geared toward a mainstream porn audience. If you share the tastes of the majority of porn viewers, you’ll be happy. If you’re into something more esoteric, you might find it difficult or impossible to find exactly what you like.</p><p>So there are pluses and minuses. If you’re curious, try it once.

Scientists have figured out how many units of information you can store in your short-term memory (around seven, <a href=\"https://www.lifehacker.com/preview/study-in-chunks-to-remember-more-1850392462?rev=1682969564950\" target=\"_blank\">though there are great workarounds for remembering more</a> than that), but if you <em>really</em> want to remember something,  you have to go over it a bunch of times until it lodges deeper in your brain. </p><p>There are <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/use-the-leitner-system-to-study-more-effectively-1850786716\" target=\"_blank\">quite a few ways to do that</a> if you have some time to devote to the practice of repetition, but if you’re getting ready for a test at school or a presentation at work, you might not have too long to go over the content again and again and <em>again</em>—but you do, if you make a personal podcast. This technique requires you to make an effort only once, then calls on you to relax and absorb the information more passively, making it ideal for studying or reviewing when you are short on time or heavy on other tasks. </p><div>\n        <p><img src=\"https://lifehacker.com/images/short-lifehacker-logo.jpg\" alt=\"Lifehacker Logo\" /></p><div>\n            <p><span>You May Also Like</span></p>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n<h2 id=\"how-to-make-a-podcast-to-help-you-study\">How to make a “podcast” to help you study</h2><div><p>Next time you want to retain the details of something you’re studying, open up the voice notes feature on your phone, because you’re going to make yourself a little study podcast. You <em>could</em> simply read your notes out loud into the mic; it’s the simplest option, and a good one. (If you’re memorizing a speech, just perform the whole thing. That's what I did in high school, when I was a forensics nerd and felt that using even a single notecard during a speech meet delegitimized my entire presentation. For what it's worth, I won a lot, which I partially attribute to being off-book while everyone else used aids.) </p><p>You do have other, more intensive, options though. You can record separate “episodes” for each mini-topic you’re studying, which will help you organize your thinking <em>and</em> provide an easy way to focus if you need brushing up in a particular area. Use <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/best-note-taking-methods-1849535943\" target=\"_blank\">your preferred note-taking method</a> or a r<a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/use-the-sq3r-method-to-study-more-effectively-1850780175\" target=\"_blank\">eading-and-retaining technique like SQ3R</a> to create outlines that are concise but make sense and hit on the points you most need to study, then write your scripts according to those notes. That part will take a while, but all of it, combined, will help you start to remember what you're supposed to be remembering.</p><p>You don’t have to worry about the thing actually being pleasant for others to listen to, so make it useful for your own study style. A few approaches you could take include asking yourself review questions out loud, pausing, and stating the right answer or reading entire passages from your textbook into the mic. You could even try out different characters and turn it into a role-playing scenario. Don't get too involved with it, though, unless that sort of creativity helps you focus; it's better to stick with facts and straightforward audio.</p></div><p>The most important part comes after you’ve recorded your personal podcast: You have to listen to it. You have to listen to it <em>a lot</em>. Play it through the speakers of your car or through your headphones on the train to make your commute productive. Play it at the grocery store, when you’re doing errands around the house, and when you are relaxing at night. Fall asleep listening to it. The first few times, you'll listen pretty actively, but even having it running as background noise will shove that information into your brain.</p><div>\n            <p><span>\n                What do you think so far?\n            </span>\n        </p></div>\n<h2 id=\"a-second-option-for-your-study-podcast\">A second option for your study podcast</h2><p>If you're going to do this, a major component of what makes it valuable is the part where you have to review the material, outline the script, and say it all out loud into your microphone. That's a big chunk of the studying right there. Still, if you don't have time for that or you are worried you won't highlight the most important parts if left to your own devices, there's another option that works well. </p><p><a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/tech/google-notebooklm-review\" target=\"_blank\">Google's NotebookLM</a> is an AI tool that pulls <em>only</em> from the material you give it. That means that unlike competitors such as ChatGPT, it doesn't answer your questions by searching the entire internet. Rather, it searches through PDFs, YouTube videos, links, and other resources you provide—and that's it. One of its coolest features is that it can <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/tech/use-google-notebooklm-ai-to-turn-your-research-into-a-podcast\" target=\"_blank\">create \"podcasts\"</a> for you based on those materials, in addition to its ability to <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/tech/googles-notebooklm-introduces-quizzes-flashcards-tools\" target=\"_blank\">create flashcards and quizzes</a>. These podcasts sound like real ones you might listen to in your everyday life: They have different voices and characters who speak conversationally but factually about the content of whatever you uploaded to the software. I love NotebookLM and use it all the time to organize my work. It's free to use and generates podcasts quickly, so it's worth considering here, too.</p><h2 id=\"why-a-personal-study-podcast-works\">Why a personal study podcast works</h2><div><p>Picking things up from your personal podcast is an example of rote learning, the process by which we memorize things based on repetition. But it has other advantages, too. </p><p>For instance, even when you’re compiling the notes and deciding <em>what </em>to include in the mini podcast, you’re studying—you’re making decisions about which concepts are most important, how they flow together, and how you can present your mastery of them to others. Even if you choose to let NotebookLM do it, you're still making decisions about which materials from your class or project to upload to the software and how to organize it, which is also studying. </p><p>Reading is all well and good, but you remember things better when you process them in a variety of ways. From organizing your notes to speaking them aloud and listening to them read back to you, every part of this process will help you more thoroughly process and recall the content. Each of those is commonly used on its own as a standalone study technique, so imagine how effective they’ll be together. </p></div>\n            </article>\n    </div>\n<div>\n    <div>\n        <p><span>The Download Newsletter</span>\n            <span>Never miss a tech story</span>\n        </p>\n        <p><img src=\"https://lifehacker.com/images/team/Jake.png\" alt=\"Jake Peterson portrait\" />\n            <span>Jake Peterson\n            </span>\n            <span>Senior tech editor</span>\n        </p>\n        <p><span>Get the latest tech news, <span></span>reviews, <span></span>and advice from Jake and the team.</span>\n    </p></div>\n    <div>\n        <p><span>The Download Newsletter</span>\n            <span><span>Never miss a tech story.</span> Get the latest tech news, <span></span>reviews, <span></span>and advice from Jake and the team.</span>\n        </p>\n    </div>\n</div>\n    </div>\n            <div>\n                <p><span>\n                        Keep Scrolling for Next Article\n                    </span>\n                </p>\n            </div>\n        </div>"

may have heard of the Pomodoro technique before—<a href=\"https://www.lifehacker.com/productivity-101-a-primer-to-the-pomodoro-technique-1598992730\" target=\"_blank\">perhaps even here at Lifehacker</a>—and might already be aware it’s a solid productivity hack. But applied in another way, i can actually be more than that: This technique is also an excellent study tool that can help you maximize your focus and retention. It's time-tested, variable, and available to you whether you want to do it the old-fashioned way or call in the help of an app. </p><h2 id=\"what-is-the-pomodoro-technique\">What is the Pomodoro technique?</h2><p>Although it has a fancy name, the technique itself is simple: If you have a large task to complete, you should break it down into pieces and schedule breaks to reward yourself in between finishing bits of it. The scheduling is the key part: When following the classic Pomodoro model, you have to set an alarm for 25 minutes and 25 minutes only. So, work for 25 minutes, and when the alarm goes off, take a five-minute break, maybe to grab a snack, refill your coffee, or scroll social media. When the five minutes are up, get back to work. Do this over and over, but every four cycles, give yourself a bigger break, up to a half an hour.</p><div>\n        <p><img src=\"https://lifehacker.com/images/short-lifehacker-logo.jpg\" alt=\"Lifehacker Logo\" /></p><div>\n            <p><span>You May Also Like</span></p>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n<p>In the event something distracts you—whether it’s your phone or another person—you have to reset your timer, so try instead to be direct and tell them you’re busy and will be able to reconnect with them in a bit. Then, put them off until you get your five-minute break or even after your whole task is finished. </p><p>This works because you are aware you’re getting that little reset once your 25 minutes are up. You can throw yourself into the task knowing there’s a little treat coming down the pipeline. And while you rest up, your brain is processing everything you just learned. </p><h2 id=\"how-to-use-pomodoro-for-studying\">How to use Pomodoro for studying</h2><p>We usually discuss the Pomodoro technique in terms of working professionally, especially when there’s a big project you need to complete, but its origins actually come from the academic sphere. The method was invented by Fancesco Cirillo, a developer and entrepreneur, but he came up with it when he was a student. It’s actually named for the little tomato-shaped timer he used when he was studying. Those methods are certainly still viable, but the popularity of his technique has also birthed a cottage industry of specialty timers. On Amazon, <a href=\"https://zdcs.link/aADMrL?pageview_type=Standard&template=Explainers&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=you%20can%20get%20a%20Pomodoro-specific%20timer&short_url=aADMrL&u=https%3A%2F%2Flifehacker.com%2Fhow-to-use-the-pomodoro-method-for-studying&event_label=you%20can%20get%20a%20Pomodoro-specific%20timer\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"open in a new window\">you can get a Pomodoro-specific timer</a> for under $20. These offer different preset time allotments, so you don't have to stick to the 25 on, five off model—but I'll get to that in a moment.</p><p>You can use this method to study for a test by breaking up the content you need to review. You go by chapter, by content, or by “chunk,” if you’re <a href=\"https://www.lifehacker.com/use-the-chunking-method-to-actually-remember-what-you-1850392462\" target=\"_blank\">using the chunking method</a> to divvy up your study load (which you should be). It’s a good way to stay on task if you get easily distracted and dividing your topics up will help you remember them better. It’s not ideal for quick cramming sessions, however, since you need at least two hours to get four “Pomodoros” in. Do this on a day you have plenty of time to devote to studying—and, of course, relaxing.</p><h2 id=\"pomodoro-variations-that-work-for-studying\">Pomodoro variations that work for studying</h2><p>As noted, the classic Pomodoro technique involves 25 minutes on and five minutes off, but you needn't be so rigid—there's a reason those Pomodoro timers don't lock you to those intervals. Twenty-five minute increments worked for Cirillo and countless adherents after him, but they may not work for you. I do recommend starting with the classic technique, but if you're not finding yourself falling into <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/use-deep-work-to-be-more-productive-1850632295\" target=\"_blank\">a state of deep work</a> during those blocks of time, you have to switch things up. </p><p>There's a lot of flexibility to the method, so feel free to experiment. For instance, one student invented \"<a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/work/how-to-use-animedoro-productivity-method\" target=\"_blank\">Animedoro</a>\" a few years ago. This approach involves working for longer intervals, around 40 to 60 minutes, then getting 20 minutes to relax and do something you enjoy—like watching an episode of anime, which tend to be about 20 minutes long. With longer working time, you have a better chance of getting into deep work and focusing, plus not getting discombobulated when your timer suddenly goes off. </p><div>\n            <p><span>\n                What do you think so far?\n            </span>\n        </p></div>\n<p>Another approach is called <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/work/try-pomodoro-20-to-focus-on-deep-work\" target=\"_blank\">Pomodoro 2.0</a> and it involves adding 15 minutes to your work period every time you return to your task, so you focus longer and longer as you go. You still need to take breaks, of course, and you can even make those incrementally longer too. </p><p>Or maybe you prefer to work in quick bursts. You can try variations where you study for just 10 minutes before a short break, giving yourself a sense of urgency as you try to see how many flashcards you can study in that time. The point is it's up to you: A period of work interspersed with breaks is the only core element of the method, and you can approach it in whatever way you find most useful. Just keep in mind that you'll get better results if you commit to a set structure, even if it takes some time to adjust to it.</p><h2 id=\"pomodoro-apps-can-help\">Pomodoro apps can help</h2><p>I'm a fan of those Pomodoro timers because they keep me off my phone, which is a major distraction—it's a slippery slope from setting an alarm to checking a notification and then finding myself in a Reels hole 10 minutes of my allotted study time. </p><p>Then again, the phone can be useful if you're using it productively. Many focus timer apps can be used with the Pomodoro method, and will even block other apps during the work-time increments you set, or otherwise penalize you for getting distracted when you should be focusing. (If you need suggestions, <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/tech/best-focus-timer-apps\" target=\"_blank\">I've previously written about a few of my favorites</a>.)</p><p>There are also Pomodoro-specific apps—including <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/tech/focuspomo-app-review\" target=\"_blank\">my top pick, FocusPomo</a>—that exist purely to help you structure your study or productivity time around the famous technique. If using your phone alarm seems risky and buying a tabletop timer off Amazon feels antiquated, look into one of these. </p>\n            </article>\n    </div>\n<div>\n    <div>\n        <p><span>The Daily Newsletter</span>\n            <span>Ready to do everything better?</span>\n        </p>\n        <p><img src=\"https://lifehacker.com/images/team/Jordan.png\" alt=\"Jordan Calhoun portrait\" />\n            <span>Jordan Calhoun\n            </span>\n            <span>Editor in chief</span>\n        </p>\n        <p><span><span>Get daily tips, tricks, <span>and tech guides</span></span> <span>from Jordan and the team.</span></span>\n    </p></div>\n    <div>\n        <p><span>The Daily Newsletter</span>\n            <span><span>Ready to do everything better?</span> <span>Get daily tips, tricks, <span>and tech guides</span></span> <span>from Jordan and the team.</span></span>\n        </p>\n    </div>\n</div>\n    </div>\n            <div>\n                <p><span>\n                        Keep Scrolling for Next Article\n                    </span>\n                </p>\n            </div>\n        </div>\n    </div>"

/><p>For as basic a necessity as it is, feeding yourself is a lot of work. What's more, feeding a household is even worse. There's the planning, then the shopping, the unpacking, the cooking, the storing, and finally, the cleaning, all of which has to be done over and over again forever. We all know what it's like to be faced with this task and just decide to open up Uber Eats and pay a bunch of fees to have someone do (most of) it for us. Apps are the saving grace when meal planning gets too daunting—but you're using the wrong apps. Forget Door Dash and Grub Hub: These apps can help you plan, shop for, and prepare meals on your own while still offloading some of the hard work on tech. </p><p>Here are some meal-planning apps that can suggest recipes based on your dietary preferences, put together shopping lists, and even walk you through the cooking. They can't box up leftovers or wash the dishes, but maybe one day in the future, we'll get there, too.</p><div>\n        <p><img src=\"https://lifehacker.com/images/short-lifehacker-logo.jpg\" alt=\"Lifehacker Logo\" /></p><div>\n            <p><span>You May Also Like</span></p>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n<h2 id=\"best-app-for-recipes-bigoven\">Best app for recipes: BigOven </h2><div>\n    <p><img src=\"https://lifehacker.com/imagery/articles/01K5ENZY2QS3V48SX95J2FN89P/images-1.fill.size_2000x1125.v1758218648.png\" alt=\"BigOven on browser\" srcset=\"https://lifehacker.com/imagery/articles/01K5ENZY2QS3V48SX95J2FN89P/images-1.fill.size_800x450.v1758218648.png 800w, https://lifehacker.com/imagery/articles/01K5ENZY2QS3V48SX95J2FN89P/images-1.fill.size_1400x788.v1758218648.png 1400w, https://lifehacker.com/imagery/articles/01K5ENZY2QS3V48SX95J2FN89P/images-1.fill.size_2000x1125.v1758218648.png 2000w\" />\n            </p>\n            <p><span></span>\n                                        <span>Credit: Lindsey Ellefson/BigOven</span>\n                    </p>\n    </div>\n<p><a href=\"https://zdcs.link/9wjZYq?pageview_type=Standard&template=Explainers&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=BigOven&short_url=9wjZYq&u=https%3A%2F%2Flifehacker.com%2Fbest-meal-planning-apps&event_label=BigOven\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"open in a new window\">BigOven</a> is a meal-planning app that grants you access over one million recipes—and new recipes are constantly being added. I like a few different things about it: First, you can input some of the ingredients you already have and get recipes based on those, reducing your grocery shopping and limiting how many of those million-plus recipes you need to scroll through. You can scan handwritten recipes in, too, and let the app turn them into recipes you can store there, preserving family traditions. Finally, I appreciate that it has a browser version, since that makes it easier to type, browse, and scroll. A few of the apps on this list also work on the browser. In general, I like to do a lot of my planning and work on the computer, then call in my phone at crunch time, just when I need to refer to a recipe. </p><p>The free version is nice, but limited. You get the ability to put together a grocery list and one free recipe scan. For more detailed meal planning, you’ll need to upgrade to its paid version for $2.99 per month or $24.99 for the year. Think of it like this: You'll save that much by skipping a delivery order or two. </p><h2 id=\"best-app-for-family-meal-planning-cozi\">Best app for family meal planning: Cozi </h2><div>\n    <p><img src=\"https://lifehacker.com/imagery/articles/01K5ENZY2QS3V48SX95J2FN89P/images-3.fill.size_2000x1131.v1758218648.png\" alt=\"Cozi in iOS\" srcset=\"https://lifehacker.com/imagery/articles/01K5ENZY2QS3V48SX95J2FN89P/images-3.fill.size_800x452.v1758218648.png 800w, https://lifehacker.com/imagery/articles/01K5ENZY2QS3V48SX95J2FN89P/images-3.fill.size_1400x792.v1758218648.png 1400w, https://lifehacker.com/imagery/articles/01K5ENZY2QS3V48SX95J2FN89P/images-3.fill.size_2000x1131.v1758218648.png 2000w\" />\n            </p>\n            <p><span></span>\n                                        <span>Credit: Lindsey Ellefson/Cozi</span>\n                    </p>\n    </div>\n<p><a href=\"https://zdcs.link/QOg182?pageview_type=Standard&template=Explainers&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=Cozi&short_url=QOg182&u=https%3A%2F%2Flifehacker.com%2Fbest-meal-planning-apps&event_label=Cozi\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"open in a new window\">Cozi</a> is a family organizer, so you might not think of food and recipes when you first hear about it—but don't be fooled. In addition to its daily calendar and to-do lists, Cozi provides space for you to keep a grocery list (which any family member can add to in real time) and even offers up recipes. Not only can you plan your meals' content, but you can schedule them for when everyone is available. </p><p>The basic version is free, but the premium version, which is $39.99 per year, offers more features, most of which have to do with the family management aspect (like birthday tracking and calendar searching). If you're using it for meal planning, you may not need to upgrade; I was able to build out an entire schedule of recipes without paying.</p><h2 id=\"best-app-for-fitness-and-nutrition-goals-eat-this-much\">Best app for fitness and nutrition goals: Eat This Much </h2><div>\n    <p><img src=\"https://lifehacker.com/imagery/articles/01K5ENZY2QS3V48SX95J2FN89P/images-4.fill.size_2000x1117.v1758218648.png\" alt=\"Eat This Much in iOS\" srcset=\"https://lifehacker.com/imagery/articles/01K5ENZY2QS3V48SX95J2FN89P/images-4.fill.size_800x447.v1758218648.png 800w, https://lifehacker.com/imagery/articles/01K5ENZY2QS3V48SX95J2FN89P/images-4.fill.size_1400x782.v1758218648.png 1400w, https://lifehacker.com/imagery/articles/01K5ENZY2QS3V48SX95J2FN89P/images-4.fill.size_2000x1117.v1758218648.png 2000w\" />\n            </p>\n            <p><span></span>\n                                        <span>Credit: Lindsey Ellefson/Eat This Much</span>\n                    </p>\n    </div>\n<p><a href=\"https://zdcs.link/9wjZYR?pageview_type=Standard&template=Explainers&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=Eat%20This%20Much&short_url=9wjZYR&u=https%3A%2F%2Flifehacker.com%2Fbest-meal-planning-apps&event_label=Eat%20This%20Much\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"open in a new window\">Eat This Much</a> is really ideal for anyone with specific nutrition and fitness goals. It puts together plans based not only on your budget and personal preferences, but your nutritional plans, as well. You're prompted to enter in how many calories you'd like to eat in a day, as well as how many grams of protein and other nutrients you want to hit. It even doubles as a calorie tracker and comes with a database of nutritional information about restaurant and packaged food. If you're meal planning and prepping for fitness or health goals, this could be the one for you to really focus in on. (Relatedly, if you're in the market for a comprehensive calorie and nutrient tracker, I am a huge fan of <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/tech/lifesum-health-app-review\" target=\"_blank\">Lifesum</a>.)</p><p>Money comes into play if you want more features. For $8.99 per month, you can create meal plans for a week, used advanced search features, view your past meals, and generate reports on your eating habits, to name a few. A bump up to $59 per month unlocks bulk meal plans for over a week in advance, macro tracking, and a recipe database, among other things. That's not exactly a small cost, but if you're serious about meal prepping, give it a look.</p><h2 id=\"best-app-for-when-youre-busy-mealime\">Best app for when you're busy: Mealime </h2><div>\n    <p><img src=\"https://lifehacker.com/imagery/articles/01K5ENZY2QS3V48SX95J2FN89P/images-5.fill.size_2000x1133.v1758218648.png\" alt=\"Mealime in iOS\" srcset=\"https://lifehacker.com/imagery/articles/01K5ENZY2QS3V48SX95J2FN89P/images-5.fill.size_800x453.v1758218648.png 800w, https://lifehacker.com/imagery/articles/01K5ENZY2QS3V48SX95J2FN89P/images-5.fill.size_1400x793.v1758218648.png 1400w, https://lifehacker.com/imagery/articles/01K5ENZY2QS3V48SX95J2FN89P/images-5.fill.size_2000x1133.v1758218648.png 2000w\" />\n            </p>\n            <p><span></span>\n                                        <span>Credit: Mealime/Lindsey Ellefson</span>\n                    </p>\n    </div>\n<p><a href=\"https://zdcs.link/a5X02j?pageview_type=Standard&template=Explainers&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=Mealime&short_url=a5X02j&u=https%3A%2F%2Flifehacker.com%2Fbest-meal-planning-apps&event_label=Mealime\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"open in a new window\">Mealime</a> is widely recommended in forums for meal planners and caters to busier people because it's full of recipes that can be made in under half an hour. You can filter recipes by dietary restrictions or preferences, generate a grocery list, and get on with your day. It's a little bare-bones beyond that, but as a picky eater, I appreciate the ability to eliminate recipes that include the things I don't care for. If you ever catch me eating a single mushroom, call the authorities because I'm sending a distress signal.</p><div>\n            <p><span>\n                What do you think so far?\n            </span>\n        </p></div>\n<p>You'll get plenty of recipes in the free version, but you'll notice some are labeled \"Pro.\" To get those, as well as other features like the ability to add notes, you'll have to upgrade to the paid version for $2.99 per month.

It’s easy to get caught up in frenzied online shopping holidays like the upcoming <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/money/everything-you-need-to-know-about-october-prime-big-deals-day-2025\" target=\"_blank\">October Prime Day sale</a>—<strong> </strong>especially when retailers sometimes <a href=\"https://www.lifehacker.com/that-amazon-deal-might-actually-be-a-hidden-price-hike-1849649849\" target=\"_blank\">sneak price hikes before major sales</a> or deceive shoppers with <a href=\"https://www.lifehacker.com/all-the-ways-amazon-tricks-you-into-spending-more-on-pr-1849158042\" target=\"_blank\">tricks to get you to spend more than you intended to</a>. </p><p>Figuring out the best time to buy something requires constantly watching ever-fluctuating online prices <em>and</em> some knowledge of how prices have changed in the past. As a shopping and deals writer, that is what I do for a living, and I know how time-consuming it can be. Luckily, you don’t have to figure it all out yourself: Here are the best websites and extensions I've been using for years to check price history and track prices so that you can be sure you’re getting the best deal possible.</p><div>\n        <p><img src=\"https://lifehacker.com/images/short-lifehacker-logo.jpg\" alt=\"Lifehacker Logo\" /></p><div>\n            <p><span>You May Also Like</span></p>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n<h2 id=\"the-best-amazon-price-tracker-camelcamelcamel\">The best Amazon price tracker: Camelcamelcamel</h2><div>\n    <p><img src=\"https://lifehacker.com/imagery/articles/01HF2GY1EGKVBM56BVJC4RJMWT/images-8.fill.size_2000x1449.v1738779720.png\" alt=\"Camelcamelcamel price history on website\" srcset=\"https://lifehacker.com/imagery/articles/01HF2GY1EGKVBM56BVJC4RJMWT/images-8.fill.size_800x579.v1738779720.png 800w, https://lifehacker.com/imagery/articles/01HF2GY1EGKVBM56BVJC4RJMWT/images-8.fill.size_1400x1014.v1738779720.png 1400w, https://lifehacker.com/imagery/articles/01HF2GY1EGKVBM56BVJC4RJMWT/images-8.fill.size_2000x1449.v1738779720.png 2000w\" />\n            </p>\n            <p><span></span>\n                                        <span>Credit: Camelcamelcamel.com</span>\n                    </p>\n    </div>\n<p><a href=\"https://camelcamelcamel.com/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"open in a new window\">CamelCamelCamel</a> is among the best ways to track prices on Amazon products.

CamelCamelCamel shows you how the price of the item has gone up or down over time, how prices have changed through Amazon directly, and the fluctuations from third-party Amazon sellers who list new and used items.</p><p>If you sign up for a free account, you can set up alerts so the site can notify you by email when the price of an item drops below a certain amount, if you can get it used for a given price, or if it’s at an all-time low and now is a good time to buy. You can even see previous historic highs and lows and try to map out the best time to strike. </p><h2 id=\"the-best-price-tracker-for-most-online-retailers-and-to-compare-prices-honey\">The best price tracker for most online retailers and to compare prices: Honey</h2><div>\n    <p><img src=\"https://lifehacker.com/imagery/articles/01HF2GY1EGKVBM56BVJC4RJMWT/images-10.fill.size_2000x890.v1738779720.png\" alt=\"Honey price history on website\" srcset=\"https://lifehacker.com/imagery/articles/01HF2GY1EGKVBM56BVJC4RJMWT/images-10.fill.size_800x356.v1738779720.png 800w, https://lifehacker.com/imagery/articles/01HF2GY1EGKVBM56BVJC4RJMWT/images-10.fill.size_1400x623.v1738779720.png 1400w, https://lifehacker.com/imagery/articles/01HF2GY1EGKVBM56BVJC4RJMWT/images-10.fill.size_2000x890.v1738779720.png 2000w\" />\n            </p>\n            <p><span></span>\n                                        <span>Credit: Honey.com</span>\n                    </p>\n    </div>\n<p>You've probably already heard of the \"<a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/tech/honey-influencer-scam-explained\" target=\"_blank\">Honey influencer scam</a>\" that blew up in December of 2024. Essentially, Honey hijacked affiliate links from influencers who were sponsoring them. Also, in many instances, it deliberately chose not to give the best coupons to users who used the extension (going completely against its business model). Honey is not alone in this behavior. Many coupon aggregator companies hijack affiliate links; Honey just happens to be in the spotlight because it's the biggest one. Use your own judgment if you choose to use any of its services. </p><p>The bad news for those looking for a price-tracking tool that can be used for most online retailers is that Honey is the only option. The good news is that <a href=\"https://www.joinhoney.com/explore\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"open in a new window\">Honey's price-tracking tool</a> can't scam you or give you subpar coupons. The <a href=\"https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/honey-automatic-coupons-r/bmnlcjabgnpnenekpadlanbbkooimhnj?hl=en-GB\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"open in a new window\">Honey browser extension</a> compares prices from a whole bunch of retailers, not just Amazon. You can create a Droplist, which notifies you if the prices drop for an item on your list if you’re willing to wait for a deal. Here is <a href=\"https://www.lifehacker.com/everything-you-should-do-now-if-you-shop-on-black-frida-1850945998#:~:text=Use%20the%20tools%20available%20to%20you\" target=\"_blank\">what creating a Droplist can do for you</a>:</p><blockquote><p>First, it’ll keep the items you want to keep tabs on organized and easily accessible. Second, it’ll track the prices of those products and alert you when they go on sale at any major retailer. You can see how much those prices cost leading up to the sale to see if they are, in fact, good deals or a trick from retailers to take advantage of you, and even compare them with other major retailers to see who has the best deal. You can see how to set up your droplist here.﻿</p></blockquote><p>As long as you don't buy the products using a Honey link, you won't be giving money to the service. Until there's a better alternative, Honey is the only option that can instantly pull up price histories and track prices for multiple retailers with a browser extension (for now).</p><h2 id=\"the-best-tool-to-compare-prices-capital-one-shopping\">The best tool to compare prices: Capital One Shopping</h2><div>\n    <p><img src=\"https://lifehacker.com/imagery/articles/01HF2GY1EGKVBM56BVJC4RJMWT/images-17.fill.size_668x750.v1738779966.png\" alt=\"Screenshot from Amazon using the Capital One Shopping browser extension\" srcset=\"https://lifehacker.com/imagery/articles/01HF2GY1EGKVBM56BVJC4RJMWT/images-17.fill.size_800x898.v1738779966.png 800w, https://lifehacker.com/imagery/articles/01HF2GY1EGKVBM56BVJC4RJMWT/images-17.fill.size_1400x1572.v1738779966.png 1400w, https://lifehacker.com/imagery/articles/01HF2GY1EGKVBM56BVJC4RJMWT/images-17.fill.size_2000x2245.v1738779966.png 2000w\" />\n            </p>\n            <p><span></span>\n                                        <span>Credit: Amazon.com</span>\n                    </p>\n    </div>\n<p><a href=\"https://capitaloneshopping.com/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"open in a new window\">Capital One Shopping</a>, previously known as Wikibuy, compares prices from other sellers when you shop on Amazon.

CheapShark combines all of the great places to get discounts on games in one place, one easily searchable directory and database of current prices from sites including Steam, GoG, Green Man Gaming, GameStop, Amazon, and more. Of course, it’s limited to video games, but you can search a game name not just to see how much it’ll cost you to buy, but even if you can buy it at all—and which retailer has it available. If you want, you can even filter by games currently on sale at their selected stores.</p><p>When you search for a specific game, CheapShark tells you what the cheapest-ever price was, when it hit that price, and gives you the choice to either go ahead and buy it from your choice of retailer or to sign up for a price notification if it drops again.</p><h2 id=\"honorable-mentions\">Honorable mentions</h2><h3>Keepa: Practical price-tracking tool for Amazon and eBay</h3><div>\n    <p><img src=\"https://lifehacker.com/imagery/articles/01HF2GY1EGKVBM56BVJC4RJMWT/images-13.fill.size_2000x659.v1738779720.png\" alt=\"Price history of the AirPods on Amazon\" srcset=\"https://lifehacker.com/imagery/articles/01HF2GY1EGKVBM56BVJC4RJMWT/images-13.fill.size_800x264.v1738779720.png 800w, https://lifehacker.com/imagery/articles/01HF2GY1EGKVBM56BVJC4RJMWT/images-13.fill.size_1400x462.v1738779720.png 1400w, https://lifehacker.com/imagery/articles/01HF2GY1EGKVBM56BVJC4RJMWT/images-13.fill.size_2000x659.v1738779720.png 2000w\" />\n            </p>\n            <p><span></span>\n                                        <span>Credit: Amazon.com using the Keepa browser extension</span>\n                    </p>\n    </div>\n<p><a href=\"https://keepa.com/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"open in a new window\">Keepa</a> works very similarly to Camelcamelcamel, but instead of clicking on the extension to see the price history, it'll be automatically displayed below the image of the product. This helps if clicking on the extension or installing is one click too much for you. Keepa also lets you track specific products and sends you notifications when they go below a specific price that you set. It also works on eBay. You can download the extension for Firefox, Chrome, Opera, Edge, and Safari. </p><h3>SlickDeals: Great for finding deals and checking prices</h3><p><a href=\"https://slickdeals.net/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"open in a new window\">SlickDeals</a> is known for bringing you up-to-the-minute discounts, coupons, and other deals from around the web, but its web-based price tracker is also great for watching prices on just about any item on Amazon and on a ton of other popular shopping sites, like Newegg, Gamestop, Chewy, Home Depot, and others.</p><div>\n    <p><img src=\"https://lifehacker.com/imagery/articles/01HF2GY1EGKVBM56BVJC4RJMWT/images-4.fill.size_2000x1124.v1699834131.png\" alt=\"Price history from SlickDeals for Nintendo Switch OLED\" srcset=\"https://lifehacker.com/imagery/articles/01HF2GY1EGKVBM56BVJC4RJMWT/images-4.fill.size_800x450.v1699834131.png 800w, https://lifehacker.com/imagery/articles/01HF2GY1EGKVBM56BVJC4RJMWT/images-4.fill.size_1400x787.v1699834131.png 1400w, https://lifehacker.com/imagery/articles/01HF2GY1EGKVBM56BVJC4RJMWT/images-4.fill.size_2000x1124.v1699834131.png 2000w\" />\n            </p>\n            <p><span></span>\n                                        <span>Credit: SlickDeals</span>\n                    </p>\n    </div>\n<p>The service doesn’t give you a detailed price history like some of the others in the roundup—it only shows a “deal history” under the “price intelligence” section for a few popular products. However, it will track the price of your item from when you create an alert and send you an email if the price drops below a threshold that you set. You can also return to the price tracker at any time, log in to your account, and see all of your tracked items on the same screen.</p><hr /><div>\n            <div>\n                    <p><span>Our Best Editor-Vetted Tech Deals Right Now</span></p>\n                </div>\n            <p><span>Deals are selected by our commerce team</span>\n                            </p>\n        </div>\n            </article>\n    </div>\n<div>\n    <div>\n        <p><span>The Daily Newsletter</span>\n            <span>Ready to do everything better?</span>\n        </p>\n        <p><img src=\"https://lifehacker.com/images/team/Jordan.png\" alt=\"Jordan Calhoun portrait\" />\n            <span>Jordan Calhoun\n            </span>\n            <span>Editor in chief</span>\n        </p>\n        <p><span><span>Get daily tips, tricks, <span>and tech guides</span></span> <span>from Jordan and the team.</span></span>\n    </p></div>\n    <div>\n        <p><span>The Daily Newsletter</span>\n            <span><span>Ready to do everything better?</span> <span>Get daily tips, tricks, <span>and tech guides</span></span> <span>from Jordan and the team.</span></span>\n        </p>\n    </div>\n</div>\n    </div>\n            <div>\n                <p><span>\n                        Keep Scrolling for Next Article\n                    </span>\n                </p>\n            </div>\n        </div>\n    </div>"

<p>With the launch of iOS 26, Apple has added a bunch of new features to the Fitness app—features that it has been sorely missing. Finally, you can track a workout from your phone <em>without</em> an Apple Watch, and you can pair a bluetooth heart rate monitor to your phone to get heart rate data. And though it seems like a small change, Apple Watch users will love the fact that you can now create and edit custom workouts on your phone.</p><h2 id=\"how-to-get-the-new-fitness-updates\">How to get the new Fitness updates</h2><p>The new features in the Fitness app are part of iOS 26, which <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/tech/when-ios-26-will-release\" target=\"_blank\"><u>comes out today</u></a>. (That’s the version with the controversial “liquid glass” look, but you can <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/tech/how-to-undo-iphone-ios-26-liquid-glass\" target=\"_blank\"><u>turn it off if you hate it</u></a>.) To install it, go to <strong>Settings</strong>, <strong>General</strong>, and then tap <strong>Software Update</strong>. </p><p>Once you've, you’ll find that the <a href=\"https://zdcs.link/a5XyWj?pageview_type=Standard&template=News&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=Fitness%20app&short_url=a5XyWj&u=https%3A%2F%2Flifehacker.com%2Fhealth%2Fios-26-gives-the-iphone-a-real-fitness-app&event_label=Fitness%20app&split_test_identifier=015ZvAUxXams0rnBpajhMg2&split_test_variant=B\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"open in a new window\"><u>Fitness app</u></a> has a new tab at the bottom, labeled <strong>Workout</strong>. This is where you’ll find the fun stuff. </p><div>\n        <p><img src=\"https://lifehacker.com/images/short-lifehacker-logo.jpg\" alt=\"Lifehacker Logo\" /></p><div>\n            <p><span>You May Also Like</span></p>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n<h2 id=\"how-to-track-a-workout-from-the-apple-fitness-app-with-or-without-a-watch\">How to track a workout from the Apple Fitness app (with or without a watch)</h2><div>\n    <p><img src=\"https://lifehacker.com/imagery/articles/01K57B2F4J0SCF2E4CHM8HXEB0/images-1.fill.size_2000x1125.v1757961862.jpg\" alt=\"Workout selection screen and in-workout screen\" srcset=\"https://lifehacker.com/imagery/articles/01K57B2F4J0SCF2E4CHM8HXEB0/images-1.fill.size_800x450.v1757961862.jpg 800w, https://lifehacker.com/imagery/articles/01K57B2F4J0SCF2E4CHM8HXEB0/images-1.fill.size_1400x788.v1757961862.jpg 1400w, https://lifehacker.com/imagery/articles/01K57B2F4J0SCF2E4CHM8HXEB0/images-1.fill.size_2000x1125.v1757961862.jpg 2000w\" />\n            </p>\n            <p><span></span>\n                                        <span>Credit: Beth Skwarecki</span>\n                    </p>\n    </div>\n<p>In the Workout tab, you’ll see a variety of workout types that you can start just by tapping the play button. Outdoor Run, Outdoor Walk, Outdoor Cycle, and Hiking are available for everyone. To access the other workout types, like Indoor Run, Indoor Cycle, Yoga, High Intensity Interval Training, and Traditional Strength Training, you’ll need to pair a heart rate monitor. </p><p>(The idea seems to be that the app needs <em>some</em> kind of data to track. If you run outdoors, GPS data tells the app how far and how fast you’re running. If you’re on a treadmill, it’s got nothing to go on—unless it has a device telling it your heart rate.) </p><p>So what counts as a heart rate data source? I had success with: </p><ul><li><p>An Apple Watch (of course)</p></li><li><p>Powerbeats Pro 2 (with the <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/health/powerbeats-pro-2-track-your-heart-rate-from-your-ears-but-not-very-well\" target=\"_blank\"><u>heart rate feature</u></a> enabled—check your <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/tech/how-to-set-up-powerbeats-pro-2\" target=\"_blank\"><u>Powerbeats settings</u></a> if yours isn’t showing up)</p></li><li><p>A third-party Bluetooth heart rate monitor (specifically <a href=\"https://zdcs.link/9YWxZr?pageview_type=Standard&%3Btemplate=Deals&%3Bmodule=content_body&%3Belement=offer&%3Bitem=text-link&%3Belement_label=Coospo%20H6%20chest%20strap&%3Bshort_url=9YWxZr&%3Bu=https%3A%2F%2Flifehacker.com%2Fhealth%2Fmy-most-trusted-heart-rate-monitor-is-just-23-for-prime-day-2025&%3Bevent_label=Coospo%20H6%20chest%20strap&template=News&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=my%20trusty%20Coospo&short_url=9YWxZr&u=https%3A%2F%2Flifehacker.com%2Fhealth%2Fios-26-gives-the-iphone-a-real-fitness-app&event_label=my%20trusty%20Coospo&split_test_identifier=015ZvAUxXams0rnBpajhMg2&split_test_variant=B\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"open in a new window\"><u>my trusty Coospo</u></a>)</p></li></ul><p>I did four short runs today: three testing each of the above, plus one with just the phone by itself and no heart rate monitor. Each of the four tracked my speed and distance, made a map of where I’d been, and (if there was a heart rate monitor paired) recorded my heart rate data. I was able to view these workouts afterward from the Sessions card on the Summary tab, where Apple Watch-only workouts would normally be found.</p><p>To be clear, the three workouts I did without the Apple Watch did not require the watch at all. I left it behind in my car, and was able to track these workouts just fine. </p><h2 id=\"how-to-mirror-your-workouts-from-apple-watch-on-your-phone\">How to mirror your workouts from Apple Watch on your phone</h2><div>\n    <p><img src=\"https://lifehacker.com/imagery/articles/01K57B2F4J0SCF2E4CHM8HXEB0/images-2.fill.size_2000x1125.v1757961862.jpg\" alt=\"in-workout: Apple Watch screenshot on left, iPhone screenshot on right.\" srcset=\"https://lifehacker.com/imagery/articles/01K57B2F4J0SCF2E4CHM8HXEB0/images-2.fill.size_800x450.v1757961862.jpg 800w, https://lifehacker.com/imagery/articles/01K57B2F4J0SCF2E4CHM8HXEB0/images-2.fill.size_1400x788.v1757961862.jpg 1400w, https://lifehacker.com/imagery/articles/01K57B2F4J0SCF2E4CHM8HXEB0/images-2.fill.size_2000x1125.v1757961862.jpg 2000w\" />\n            </p>\n            <p><span>Apple Watch screenshot on left, iPhone screenshot on right.

You can start a workout from the Fitness app, or from your phone, and either way you get a Live Activity on your phone’s lock screen. Tap that, and you’ll see a screen in the Fitness app that shows the same data you see on your watch. </p><p>This can be handy for cardio machines especially—set your phone in front of you, and look at that instead of having to take your hand off the handlebars and turn your wrist to see how many seconds you have left in your interval.</p><div>\n            <p><span>\n                What do you think so far?\n            </span>\n        </p></div>\n<p>If you don’t see the workout view on your phone, swipe right from the workout screen on your watch and select <strong>View</strong> to enable it. </p><h2 id=\"how-to-create-custom-apple-watch-workouts-on-your-phone\">How to create custom Apple Watch workouts on your phone</h2><div>\n    <p><img src=\"https://lifehacker.com/imagery/articles/01K57B2F4J0SCF2E4CHM8HXEB0/images-3.fill.size_2000x1125.v1757961862.jpg\" alt=\"Workout creation screens\" srcset=\"https://lifehacker.com/imagery/articles/01K57B2F4J0SCF2E4CHM8HXEB0/images-3.fill.size_800x450.v1757961862.jpg 800w, https://lifehacker.com/imagery/articles/01K57B2F4J0SCF2E4CHM8HXEB0/images-3.fill.size_1400x788.v1757961862.jpg 1400w, https://lifehacker.com/imagery/articles/01K57B2F4J0SCF2E4CHM8HXEB0/images-3.fill.size_2000x1125.v1757961862.jpg 2000w\" />\n            </p>\n            <p><span></span>\n                                        <span>Credit: Beth Skwarecki</span>\n                    </p>\n    </div>\n<p>The Apple Watch already had a feature where you could create custom workouts, or set yourself a goal for a workout (like running for a certain amount of time, or racing your past self on a favorite route). Now, that’s all available in the fitness app. </p><p>To find it, go to the Workout tab of the Fitness app. instead of hitting the triangle play button on your phone to start a workout, tap the timer icon. This takes you to the screen with routes, goals, and custom workouts. </p><p>I had never before bothered with the custom workouts since they were so annoying to access on the watch, but today I created a short interval workout and ran it as part of my testing. (One thing to know: You need to create a work interval and a rest interval <em>before</em> creating a repeat loop—some apps have you do this in the opposite order, which tripped me up.) </p><p>In total, these new features make the Apple Fitness app a lot more useful. You no longer need a third-party app to <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/why-a-chest-strap-in-the-best-way-to-track-heart-rate-while-exercising\" target=\"_blank\"><u>use a Bluetooth heart rate monitor</u></a> or to track a simple run around the neighborhood. It's now a real workout app, rather than just something you open to check how many times you’ve closed your rings.</p>\n            </article>\n    </div>\n<div>\n    <div>\n        <p><span>The Daily Newsletter</span>\n            <span>Ready to do everything better?</span>\n        </p>\n        <p><img src=\"https://lifehacker.com/images/team/Jordan.png\" alt=\"Jordan Calhoun portrait\" />\n            <span>Jordan Calhoun\n            </span>\n            <span>Editor in chief</span>\n        </p>\n        <p><span><span>Get daily tips, tricks, <span>and tech guides</span></span> <span>from Jordan and the team.</span></span>\n    </p></div>\n    <div>\n        <p><span>The Daily Newsletter</span>\n            <span><span>Ready to do everything better?</span> <span>Get daily tips, tricks, <span>and tech guides</span></span> <span>from Jordan and the team.</span></span>\n        </p>\n    </div>\n</div>\n    </div>\n            <div>\n                <p><span>\n                        Keep Scrolling for Next Article\n                    </span>\n                </p>\n            </div>\n        </div>\n    </div>"

That's because Apple was still waiting on FDA approval for the new feature, even as it announced the new watch. Now, though, it seems that's been taken care of.</p><p>While Apple initially only promised the feature sometime \"this month,\" in a statement sent to press just last night, Apple said that its hypertension notifications have now been approved by the FDA and will be releasing alongside watchOS 26 when it <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/tech/when-ios-26-will-release\" target=\"_blank\">launches to the public on Monday</a>. That means no delay for the update—it'll be ready for the Apple Watch Series 11 at launch, and owners of the Series 9 and Series 10 will get a chance to play with it before then. If your tastes skew a bit fancier, then yes, the Apple Watch Ultra 3 is also set to get the notifications at launch, and the Ultra 2 will be among the older watches getting them on Monday.</p><p>This is all great news for my family, which does have a history of heart problems. While these notifications aren't set to replace a full-on blood pressure cuff, the idea is that they'll help tip you off to potential issues early, so you can know to bring them up to your doctor or pay more attention to them. According to Apple, the <a href=\"https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2025/09/apple-debuts-apple-watch-series-11-featuring-groundbreaking-health-insights/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"open in a new window\">way it works</a> is that the watch will use its existing optical heart rate sensor to passively check \"how your blood vessels respond to the beats of the heart\" over a 30-day period, and then will send you a warning if it detects signs of high blood pressure. After that, it'll encourage you to log your blood pressure for a week using a third-party cuff, and set up an appointment with your doctor.</p><div>\n        <p><img src=\"https://lifehacker.com/images/short-lifehacker-logo.jpg\" alt=\"Lifehacker Logo\" /></p><div>\n            <p><span>You May Also Like</span></p>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n<p>In other words, it won't give you exact numbers, but might let you know if you're at risk. Given that high blood pressure <a href=\"https://www.who.int/news/item/25-08-2021-more-than-700-million-people-with-untreated-hypertension\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"open in a new window\">often goes undiagnosed</a> until it's too late, Apple is hoping these notifications will help change that.</p><p>Personally, I'm inclined to believe it. Earlier this year, my husband actually had surgery to treat a separate heart condition called AFib, and his Apple Watch Series 10 played a big part in detecting and tracking it before it became a problem. As part of his treatment, he's had to regularly check his blood pressure with a cuff, but we're both looking forward to the extra data his watch will now give him.</p><div>\n            <p><span>\n                What do you think so far?\n            </span>\n        </p></div>\n<p>Apple says its hypertension notifications were developed using data from over 100,000 testing participants, and then validated using data from 2,000 additional patients. While I can't guarantee that they'll work perfectly for you out of the box, that's a good sign, even if Apple warns that the new feature \"will not detect all instances of hypertension.\" Interestingly, this follows the <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/health/fda-says-whoops-blood-pressure-feature-is-illegal\" target=\"_blank\">FDA's rejection of a similar feature from Whoop</a>, although that feature purports to provide more data than Apple's. </p><p>If you want to try Apple's hypertension notifications for yourself, there's nothing you need to do for now. Simply ensure you have a compatible Apple Watch, then allow it to update to watchOS 26 on Monday and try to wear it as often as you can over the next 30 days to give it ample opportunities to collect data.</p>\n            </article>\n    </div>\n<div>\n    <div>\n        <p><span>The Download Newsletter</span>\n            <span>Never miss a tech story</span>\n        </p>\n        <p><img src=\"https://lifehacker.com/images/team/Jake.png\" alt=\"Jake Peterson portrait\" />\n            <span>Jake Peterson\n            </span>\n            <span>Senior tech editor</span>\n        </p>\n        <p><span>Get the latest tech news, <span></span>reviews, <span></span>and advice from Jake and the team.</span>\n    </p></div>\n    <div>\n        <p><span>The Download Newsletter</span>\n            <span><span>Never miss a tech story.</span> Get the latest tech news, <span></span>reviews, <span></span>and advice from Jake and the team.</span>\n        </p>\n    </div>\n</div>\n    </div>\n            <div>\n                <p><span>\n                        Keep Scrolling for Next Article\n                    </span>\n                </p>\n            </div>\n        </div>"
