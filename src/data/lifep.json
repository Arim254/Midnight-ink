As of Monday, iOS 26.1 is officially in beta testing, which means developers and public testers can try out Apple's next update early. </p><p>\"Point updates\" like iOS 26.1 are never as feature-filled as the main releases, though 26.1 seems particularly small in scope. Apple seems to have done most of what it planned to do with iOS 26, saving just smaller changes for this upcoming update. Still, there are some interesting new additions in this latest beta, and more could come in subsequent releases. Here's what's new.</p><div>\n        <p><img src=\"https://lifehacker.com/images/short-lifehacker-logo.jpg\" alt=\"Lifehacker Logo\" /></p><div>\n            <p><span>You May Also Like</span></p>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n<h2 id=\"apple-music-gestures\">Apple Music gestures</h2><p>If you want to skip a song in Apple Music, you hit the forward button. If you want to get back to the previous song, or restart the current song, you hit the back button. With iOS 26.1, however, you'll have the option to swipe to switch between songs. </p><p>In the current beta, you can swipe right and left on the Now Playing bar to switch back and forth through your queue. With it, Apple has removed the skip forward button from the Now Playing bar. (The back button wasn't present.) It's a small but cool feature, but one that might take a little time to get used to.</p><blockquote>\n    <a href=\"https://twitter.com/BetaProfiles/status/1970499981493833985\" title=\"open in a new window\" target=\"_blank\">\n        This Tweet is currently unavailable. It might be loading or has been removed.\n    </a>\n</blockquote>\n<h2 id=\"video-playback-bar\">Video playback bar</h2><p>In the current version of iOS 26, the video playback bar in the Photos app is flush with the UI. You might love or hate it, but it can be a bit difficult to make it out, depending on the video in question. The play button and mute button, for example, can disappear when iOS can't change their colors to stand out from the background. </p><p>iOS 26.1 beta 1, however, introduces a new video playback bar that is separate from the UI. It looks good, and is easy to see at all times. Again, a small change, but a smart one.</p><blockquote>\n    <a href=\"https://twitter.com/BetaProfiles/status/1970204922751971838\" title=\"open in a new window\" target=\"_blank\">\n        This Tweet is currently unavailable.

So long as you have an iPhone 15 Pro or newer, as well as AirPods Pro 2, AirPods Pro 3, or AirPods 5 with Active Noise Cancellation, you've been able to try it out since iOS 26's launch.  </p><p>Apple initially rolled out support for French, German, Portuguese (Brazil), and Spanish (Spain), but plans to expand the list in the future. With iOS 26.1, it adds four new options, including:</p><ul><li><p>Chinese (Mandarin, simplified)</p></li><li><p>Chinese (Mandarin, traditional)</p></li><li><p>Italian</p></li><li><p>Japanese</p></li><li><p>Korean</p></li></ul><h2 id=\"eight-new-languages-for-apple-intelligence\">Eight new languages for Apple Intelligence</h2><p>Users with an iPhone 15 Pro and newer, listen up: Apple Intelligence supports eight new languages in iOS 26.1. As of this first beta, that includes the following: </p><div>\n            <p><span>\n                What do you think so far?\n            </span>\n        </p></div>\n<ul><li><p>Chinese (traditional)</p></li><li><p>Danish</p></li><li><p>Dutch</p></li><li><p>Norwegian</p></li><li><p>Portuguese (Portugal)</p></li><li><p>Swedish</p></li><li><p>Turkish</p></li><li><p>Vietnamese</p></li></ul><h2 id=\"liquid-glass-comes-to-the-phones-keypad\">Liquid Glass comes to the Phone's keypad</h2><p><a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/tech/how-to-undo-iphone-ios-26-liquid-glass\" target=\"_blank\">Liquid Glass</a>, Apple's new design language, isn't <em>everywhere </em>in iOS 26. While much of the UI now has a glassy look, some elements still look like iOS 18 and earlier. The Phone app's keypad was one such example: While the app itself is <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/tech/ios-26-missed-call-reminders\" target=\"_blank\">very much changed</a> with this update, switch to the keypad, and it looks the same as ever. </p><p>That changes with iOS 26.1. The beta brings Liquid Glass to the keypad, which, while consistent with most of iOS 26's design, does reduce the visibility of the keys a bit, especially in light mode. I wouldn't be surprised to see Apple workshop this one a bit. </p><blockquote>\n    <a href=\"https://twitter.com/BetaProfiles/status/1970197002941321667\" title=\"open in a new window\" target=\"_blank\">\n        This Tweet is currently unavailable.

Some watches offer notification support, but most simply don't jive well with iOS. </p><p>That might be changing in the future. <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/tech/apple-might-support-third-party-smartwatches\" target=\"_blank\">Code within the iOS 26.1 beta</a> references a new \"Notification Forwarding\" feature, that might allow you to choose a third-party device to send your iPhone alerts to. In addition, an unfinished \"AccessoryExtension\" option might be the framework that lets you pair a third-party watch to your iPhone.</p><p>These are just references in code, not something that you can actively test out in the 26.1 beta, but it's worth noting. Apple is experimenting with supporting third-party watches on iOS, though it could just be to appease the EU's \"Digital Markets Act.\"  </p>\n            </article>\n    </div>\n<div>\n    <div>\n        <p><span>The Download Newsletter</span>\n            <span>Never miss a tech story</span>\n        </p>\n        <p><img src=\"https://lifehacker.com/images/team/Jake.png\" alt=\"Jake Peterson portrait\" />\n            <span>Jake Peterson\n            </span>\n            <span>Senior tech editor</span>\n        </p>\n        <p><span>Get the latest tech news, <span></span>reviews, <span></span>and advice from Jake and the team.</span>\n    </p></div>\n    <div>\n        <p><span>The Download Newsletter</span>\n            <span><span>Never miss a tech story.</span> Get the latest tech news, <span></span>reviews, <span></span>and advice from Jake and the team.</span>\n        </p>\n    </div>\n</div>\n    </div>\n            <div>\n                <p><span>\n                        Keep Scrolling for Next Article\n                    </span>\n                </p>\n            </div>\n        </div>\n    </div>"

target=\"_blank\" title=\"open in a new window\">Apple Watch</a> and in the Apple Health app, grades how well you slept on a scale from 0 to 100. Since it grades you retroactively, I can look back at my last month (or even years) of sleep scores to see how the new numbers compare to the scores I’ve gotten from <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/health/oura-ring-4-review\" target=\"_blank\"><u>Oura</u></a> and other wearables. I tried this out, and one thing stood out: Apple is way too easy on me. </p><p>I’m kidding, sort of. Yes, Apple’s scores are consistently higher than those I get from other wearables, but it’s not like I can definitively say Apple is wrong or Oura is right. I think of a sleep score like a grade on an essay: A bad essay will probably get a bad grade, and a good essay will probably get a good grade, but it’s not like every teacher in the world would agree that your take on <em>Moby Dick</em>’s symbolism deserves exactly a 92%. You may feel like you got away with something if your mid essay comes back with an A+, but as long as the prof is consistent with their grading scheme, you can’t say your grade was <em>wrong</em>. </p><div>\n        <p><img src=\"https://lifehacker.com/images/short-lifehacker-logo.jpg\" alt=\"Lifehacker Logo\" /></p><div>\n            <p><span>You May Also Like</span></p>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n<p>That’s why the accuracy of sleep scores doesn't matter a ton, in my opinion. The World Sleep Society more or less agrees, <a href=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S138994572500173X\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"open in a new window\"><u>saying</u></a> not to read too much into individual scores, but instead keep an eye on trends, like whether your sleep seems to be getting better or worse over time. </p><h2 id=\"how-apples-sleep-scores-measure-up-to-oura-garmin-and-whoop\">How Apple's sleep scores measure up to Oura, Garmin, and Whoop</h2><p>With all of that in mind, I thought it would be interesting to compare my last month or so of Apple sleep scores to those I get from the Oura ring, plus a few data points from my Garmin and Whoop devices. </p><p>Apple calculates your sleep score based on your sleep duration, bedtime consistency, and interruptions. Competing devices each have their own algorithm. Apple can calculate its score based on the data from any device, not just an Apple Watch, so in some cases the Oura and Apple scores are actually using the same underlying data. </p><p>Here are the results: </p><div>\n            <p><span>\n                What do you think so far?\n            </span>\n        </p></div>\n<div>\n    <p><img src=\"https://lifehacker.com/imagery/articles/01K5HC64V6NFCF4R5VN2RK9C8M/images-1.fill.size_2000x1125.v1758298575.png\" alt=\"Graph of Apple, Oura, Garmin, and Whoop sleep scores\" srcset=\"https://lifehacker.com/imagery/articles/01K5HC64V6NFCF4R5VN2RK9C8M/images-1.fill.size_800x450.v1758298575.png 800w, https://lifehacker.com/imagery/articles/01K5HC64V6NFCF4R5VN2RK9C8M/images-1.fill.size_1400x788.v1758298575.png 1400w, https://lifehacker.com/imagery/articles/01K5HC64V6NFCF4R5VN2RK9C8M/images-1.fill.size_2000x1125.v1758298575.png 2000w\" />\n            </p>\n            <p><span>Apple is the red line at the top—usually grading me higher than its competitors.</span>\n                                        <span>Credit: Beth Skwarecki</span>\n                    </p>\n    </div>\n<p>Apple says that over the past month, my most frequent sleep score level is “excellent,” earned on 17 nights. I also had a “high” sleep score on 10 nights, with just one night of “OK” sleep, one of “low” sleep, and no nights “very low.”</p><p>My major takeaway is that Apple’s scores are almost always higher than those I get from other devices. That said, they tend to go up when the others go up, and down when the others go down, which means that all of these scores are probably useful when looked at from a big-picture point of view. </p><p>Subjectively, I don’t think my sleep has been all that good lately. I’ve been staying up late more often than I’d like, and waking up tired more often than not. I’d judge it as mostly OK, occasionally poor, and sometimes good. But that’s just, like, my opinion, man. </p><p>It is true that there’s probably nothing medically wrong with me, and I don't think my sleep is drastically poor—so maybe Apple’s rosy outlook is just a better way to think about my sleep. It’s OK to be a straight-A student sometimes. </p>\n            </article>\n    </div>\n<div>\n    <div>\n        <p><span>The Daily Newsletter</span>\n            <span>Ready to do everything better?</span>\n        </p>\n        <p><img src=\"https://lifehacker.com/images/team/Jordan.png\" alt=\"Jordan Calhoun portrait\" />\n            <span>Jordan Calhoun\n            </span>\n            <span>Editor in chief</span>\n        </p>\n        <p><span><span>Get daily tips, tricks, <span>and tech guides</span></span> <span>from Jordan and the team.</span></span>\n    </p></div>\n    <div>\n        <p><span>The Daily Newsletter</span>\n            <span><span>Ready to do everything better?</span> <span>Get daily tips, tricks, <span>and tech guides</span></span> <span>from Jordan and the team.</span></span>\n        </p>\n    </div>\n</div>\n    </div>\n            <div>\n                <p><span>\n                        Keep Scrolling for Next Article\n                    </span>\n                </p>\n            </div>\n        </div>\n    </div>"

Scientists have figured out how many units of information you can store in your short-term memory (around seven, <a href=\"https://www.lifehacker.com/preview/study-in-chunks-to-remember-more-1850392462?rev=1682969564950\" target=\"_blank\">though there are great workarounds for remembering more</a> than that), but if you <em>really</em> want to remember something,  you have to go over it a bunch of times until it lodges deeper in your brain. </p><p>There are <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/use-the-leitner-system-to-study-more-effectively-1850786716\" target=\"_blank\">quite a few ways to do that</a> if you have some time to devote to the practice of repetition, but if you’re getting ready for a test at school or a presentation at work, you might not have too long to go over the content again and again and <em>again</em>—but you do, if you make a personal podcast. This technique requires you to make an effort only once, then calls on you to relax and absorb the information more passively, making it ideal for studying or reviewing when you are short on time or heavy on other tasks. </p><div>\n        <p><img src=\"https://lifehacker.com/images/short-lifehacker-logo.jpg\" alt=\"Lifehacker Logo\" /></p><div>\n            <p><span>You May Also Like</span></p>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n<h2 id=\"how-to-make-a-podcast-to-help-you-study\">How to make a “podcast” to help you study</h2><div><p>Next time you want to retain the details of something you’re studying, open up the voice notes feature on your phone, because you’re going to make yourself a little study podcast. You <em>could</em> simply read your notes out loud into the mic; it’s the simplest option, and a good one. (If you’re memorizing a speech, just perform the whole thing. That's what I did in high school, when I was a forensics nerd and felt that using even a single notecard during a speech meet delegitimized my entire presentation. For what it's worth, I won a lot, which I partially attribute to being off-book while everyone else used aids.) </p><p>You do have other, more intensive, options though. You can record separate “episodes” for each mini-topic you’re studying, which will help you organize your thinking <em>and</em> provide an easy way to focus if you need brushing up in a particular area. Use <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/best-note-taking-methods-1849535943\" target=\"_blank\">your preferred note-taking method</a> or a r<a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/use-the-sq3r-method-to-study-more-effectively-1850780175\" target=\"_blank\">eading-and-retaining technique like SQ3R</a> to create outlines that are concise but make sense and hit on the points you most need to study, then write your scripts according to those notes. That part will take a while, but all of it, combined, will help you start to remember what you're supposed to be remembering.</p><p>You don’t have to worry about the thing actually being pleasant for others to listen to, so make it useful for your own study style. A few approaches you could take include asking yourself review questions out loud, pausing, and stating the right answer or reading entire passages from your textbook into the mic. You could even try out different characters and turn it into a role-playing scenario. Don't get too involved with it, though, unless that sort of creativity helps you focus; it's better to stick with facts and straightforward audio.</p></div><p>The most important part comes after you’ve recorded your personal podcast: You have to listen to it. You have to listen to it <em>a lot</em>. Play it through the speakers of your car or through your headphones on the train to make your commute productive. Play it at the grocery store, when you’re doing errands around the house, and when you are relaxing at night. Fall asleep listening to it. The first few times, you'll listen pretty actively, but even having it running as background noise will shove that information into your brain.</p><div>\n            <p><span>\n                What do you think so far?\n            </span>\n        </p></div>\n<h2 id=\"a-second-option-for-your-study-podcast\">A second option for your study podcast</h2><p>If you're going to do this, a major component of what makes it valuable is the part where you have to review the material, outline the script, and say it all out loud into your microphone. That's a big chunk of the studying right there. Still, if you don't have time for that or you are worried you won't highlight the most important parts if left to your own devices, there's another option that works well. </p><p><a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/tech/google-notebooklm-review\" target=\"_blank\">Google's NotebookLM</a> is an AI tool that pulls <em>only</em> from the material you give it. That means that unlike competitors such as ChatGPT, it doesn't answer your questions by searching the entire internet. Rather, it searches through PDFs, YouTube videos, links, and other resources you provide—and that's it. One of its coolest features is that it can <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/tech/use-google-notebooklm-ai-to-turn-your-research-into-a-podcast\" target=\"_blank\">create \"podcasts\"</a> for you based on those materials, in addition to its ability to <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/tech/googles-notebooklm-introduces-quizzes-flashcards-tools\" target=\"_blank\">create flashcards and quizzes</a>. These podcasts sound like real ones you might listen to in your everyday life: They have different voices and characters who speak conversationally but factually about the content of whatever you uploaded to the software. I love NotebookLM and use it all the time to organize my work. It's free to use and generates podcasts quickly, so it's worth considering here, too.</p><h2 id=\"why-a-personal-study-podcast-works\">Why a personal study podcast works</h2><div><p>Picking things up from your personal podcast is an example of rote learning, the process by which we memorize things based on repetition. But it has other advantages, too. </p><p>For instance, even when you’re compiling the notes and deciding <em>what </em>to include in the mini podcast, you’re studying—you’re making decisions about which concepts are most important, how they flow together, and how you can present your mastery of them to others. Even if you choose to let NotebookLM do it, you're still making decisions about which materials from your class or project to upload to the software and how to organize it, which is also studying. </p><p>Reading is all well and good, but you remember things better when you process them in a variety of ways. From organizing your notes to speaking them aloud and listening to them read back to you, every part of this process will help you more thoroughly process and recall the content. Each of those is commonly used on its own as a standalone study technique, so imagine how effective they’ll be together. </p></div>\n            </article>\n    </div>\n<div>\n    <div>\n        <p><span>The Download Newsletter</span>\n            <span>Never miss a tech story</span>\n        </p>\n        <p><img src=\"https://lifehacker.com/images/team/Jake.png\" alt=\"Jake Peterson portrait\" />\n            <span>Jake Peterson\n            </span>\n            <span>Senior tech editor</span>\n        </p>\n        <p><span>Get the latest tech news, <span></span>reviews, <span></span>and advice from Jake and the team.</span>\n    </p></div>\n    <div>\n        <p><span>The Download Newsletter</span>\n            <span><span>Never miss a tech story.</span> Get the latest tech news, <span></span>reviews, <span></span>and advice from Jake and the team.</span>\n        </p>\n    </div>\n</div>\n    </div>\n            <div>\n                <p><span>\n                        Keep Scrolling for Next Article\n                    </span>\n                </p>\n            </div>\n        </div>"

</p>\n    <h2 id=\"toc\">Table of Contents</h2>\n    <article>\n        <hr />\n        <p>It turns out the “lifestyle logging” feature introduced with <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/health/garmin-new-venu-4-watch\" target=\"_blank\"><u>Garmin’s Venu 4 watch announcement</u></a> isn’t limited to that watch—it  seems to be available to all Garmin users, which means the app has made a huge stride in catching up with competitors like Whoop. </p><h2 id=\"what-is-lifestyle-logging\">What is lifestyle logging? </h2><p>This feature lets you track different habits, behaviors, or factors that might impact your health metrics. For example, you can log when you have caffeine or alcohol at night, and see how this affects your sleep. (Garmin tends to refer to these as “behaviors,” even though some of them are more like environmental factors or states of being—illness, for example—but I'll allow it.) </p><p><a href=\"https://zdcs.link/9l30vP?pageview_type=Standard&template=How-To&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=Whoop&short_url=9l30vP&u=https%3A%2F%2Flifehacker.com%2Fhealth%2Fgarmin-whoop-feature-lifestyle-logging&event_label=Whoop\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"open in a new window\"><u>Whoop</u></a>, the screenless tracker with the expensive (but arguably worth it) subscription, has <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/health/what-its-like-to-track-your-health-with-whoop\" target=\"_blank\"><u>long had this kind of feature</u></a>, and it will give you detailed breakdowns of how your habits have affected your recovery. The <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/health/bevel-apple-watch-app-review\" target=\"_blank\"><u>Apple Watch app Bevel</u></a> provides similar functionality as well, while the <a href=\"https://zdcs.link/QWwelm?pageview_type=Standard&template=How-To&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=Oura%20ring&short_url=QWwelm&u=https%3A%2F%2Flifehacker.com%2Fhealth%2Fgarmin-whoop-feature-lifestyle-logging&event_label=Oura%20ring\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"open in a new window\"><u>Oura ring</u></a> has “tags” in <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/health/what-ive-learned-from-four-years-of-tracking-my-health-with-the-oura-ring\" target=\"_blank\"><u>its app</u></a>, although they are more for labeling than analysis. </p><div>\n        <p><img src=\"https://lifehacker.com/images/short-lifehacker-logo.jpg\" alt=\"Lifehacker Logo\" /></p><div>\n            <p><span>You May Also Like</span></p>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n<p>Garmin’s version uses your logged behaviors to generate reports that show how the factors you logged affect: </p><ul><li><p>Your sleep score</p></li><li><p>Your overnight <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/what-your-heart-rate-variability-says-about-your-health-1847517391\" target=\"_blank\"><u>HRV</u></a></p></li><li><p>Your overnight stress</p></li></ul><p>These seem to be the only outcomes, so you won’t see whether these behaviors affect, say, your running performance. And as with any feature of this type, the app can’t actually tell you if your behaviors are <em>causing</em> the positive or negative results you get. </p><p>For example, Whoop <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/health/what-its-like-to-track-your-health-with-whoop\" target=\"_blank\"><u>told me</u></a> that I sleep worse on nights I take melatonin, but that’s just a correlation: The melatonin probably isn’t making my sleep worse; it’s more likely that the connection is because I take melatonin on nights when I’m already up late or expect to have trouble sleeping. </p><h2 id=\"which-garmin-devices-can-use-lifestyle-logging\">Which Garmin devices can use lifestyle logging? </h2><p>Logging your behaviors doesn’t require any specific device; I was able to activate it on an account that had no wearable devices paired at all. However, Garmin notes that to get meaningful reports, you’ll need a device that is capable of measuring HRV (which also contributes to your sleep score and overnight stress). Most of the popular Garmin wearables have HRV capabilities, including Venu, <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/health/garmins-vivoactive-6-smartwatch-review\" target=\"_blank\"><u>Vivoactive</u></a>, and <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/health/what-its-like-to-race-with-the-garmin-forerunner-165\" target=\"_blank\"><u>Forerunner</u></a> watches, and the new <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/health/garmin-index-sleep-band-review\" target=\"_blank\"><u>Index sleep monitor</u></a>. </p><h2 id=\"how-to-use-garmins-lifestyle-logging\">How to use Garmin’s lifestyle logging</h2><p>The feature is kind of hidden, so I wouldn’t blame you for not knowing that it’s there. Make sure your Garmin Connect app is up to date, and then tap the three-dot menu in the bottom right corner. Go to <strong>training and planning</strong>, then <strong>health stats</strong>, and then <strong>lifestyle logging</strong>. </p><div>\n            <p><span>\n                What do you think so far?\n            </span>\n        </p></div>\n<p>The first time you do this, you’ll get a few information screens explaining the feature and asking you to acknowledge that it’s not medical advice.</p><p>You’ll then select the items you want to log. Garmin recommends choosing “only a few” items to log at a time, so you can learn more about those specific things rather than trying to wade through mountains of data. The app’s info screen wisely points out that if you log many different factors, “you may get conflicting data and have a difficult time determining what’s really impacting your health stats.”</p><h3>A non-exhaustive list of what you can log </h3><ul><li><p>The <strong>lifestyle</strong> category includes alcohol, caffeine (morning or late), exercise (light, moderate, or vigorous), late meals, and intermittent fasting.</p></li><li><p>The <strong>self-care</strong> category includes cold showers, journaling, and sunlight.</p></li><li><p>The treatments category includes acupuncture and massage.</p></li><li><p>The sleep-related category includes CPAP machine use, eye masks, reading in bed, and having a pet in your bedroom.</p></li><li><p>The life status category includes allergy symptoms, caregiving, illness, and vacation.</p></li></ul><p>You can also create custom items to log. You can give them a quantity if you like, or just set them up as a yes/no answer. You can also indicate if the item is daytime or bedtime related. Finally, after choosing the behaviors you’d like to log, the app will ask if you’d like related morning and/or evening reminders. </p><p>To see results from any of your behaviors, you’ll need to accumulate five yeses and five nos for each. (As with Whoop’s version of this feature, it’s not useful to track a behavior that you always do or never do—there’s just not enough data to work from.) </p><p>You can view your results from the Training and Planning menu, as above, and you can also add a card to the “at a glance” section of your Garmin Connect app home screen. The card will show whether you’ve logged your behaviors for the day, and tapping on it will show what you’ve logged today and in the past.
