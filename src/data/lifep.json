Whether you want to build a smart security system, turn a “dumb” device smart, or simply control your lights from your phone, this guide will help walk you through it.</em></p>\n        </span>\n    </p>\n    <article>\n        <hr />\n        <p>Cleaning is one of those necessary chores that most of us don't have much enthusiasm for. It's often demanding and tedious work, and while you're taking care of it, you do so with the knowledge that you're going to have to do it all again next week.</p><p>There's some good news, though, for the cleaning-averse: Modern day tech can handle a lot of these jobs on your behalf, as smart cleaning gadgets continue to get better and better. In recent years, they've become more reliable and more effective, and you've got a host of different models to choose from.</p><p>This introduction to smart cleaning technology will bring you up to date on the products that are available, and what they can do for you. Yes, you can have a home that's neater and cleaner—with just a few button presses.</p>\n<h2 id=\"the-pros-and-cons-of-cleaning-tech\">The pros and cons of cleaning tech</h2><p>The big positive from investing in smart cleaning gadgets is, of course, that you won't have to do these jobs yourself, so the hours you save can be put towards doing something you actually enjoy.</p><p>These gadgets don't get tired, sick, or irritable, and will work at any time of the day or night—though you don't necessarily want a robot vacuum humming away at 4 a.m.. In many cases they can be operated remotely and work autonomously, so they can be taking care of the chores while you're out at work or on vacation.</p><div>\n    <p><img src=\"https://lifehacker.com/imagery/articles/01K57198V3E3FABSSYCRSRWCH6/images-1.fill.size_2000x1125.v1757951599.jpg\" alt=\"Ecovacs Winbot W2 Pro Omni\" srcset=\"https://lifehacker.com/imagery/articles/01K57198V3E3FABSSYCRSRWCH6/images-1.fill.size_800x450.v1757951599.jpg 800w, https://lifehacker.com/imagery/articles/01K57198V3E3FABSSYCRSRWCH6/images-1.fill.size_1400x788.v1757951599.jpg 1400w, https://lifehacker.com/imagery/articles/01K57198V3E3FABSSYCRSRWCH6/images-1.fill.size_2000x1125.v1757951599.jpg 2000w\" />\n            </p>\n            <p><span>You can get smart devices to wash your windows for you.</span>\n                                        <span>Credit: Ecovacs</span>\n                    </p>\n    </div>\n<p>You <em>are </em>going to have to make an initial investment in the technology, and, for some devices, a rather sizable one. The argument can be made that hiring someone to do your cleaning is a better option than getting robots to do it: They might do a more thorough job, depending on the person and the gadget you're comparing them to, and you can give them more specific instructions. However, getting cleaners in does involve giving someone else access to your home, and finding a mutually convenient time. It will also be an ongoing expense.</p><p>There are a few more cons to consider. One is that a certain amount of tidying up and preparation work is often required before the robots can take over. You may have to pick up toys and clothes, for example, so the robot vacuum can vacuum. By the time you've done that, you might think it makes more sense to just do the whole job yourself.</p><div>\n    <p><img src=\"https://lifehacker.com/imagery/articles/01K57198V3E3FABSSYCRSRWCH6/images-2.fill.size_2000x1125.v1757951599.jpg\" alt=\"Roomba app\" srcset=\"https://lifehacker.com/imagery/articles/01K57198V3E3FABSSYCRSRWCH6/images-2.fill.size_800x450.v1757951599.jpg 800w, https://lifehacker.com/imagery/articles/01K57198V3E3FABSSYCRSRWCH6/images-2.fill.size_1400x788.v1757951599.jpg 1400w, https://lifehacker.com/imagery/articles/01K57198V3E3FABSSYCRSRWCH6/images-2.fill.size_2000x1125.v1757951599.jpg 2000w\" />\n            </p>\n            <p><span>Many smart devices can be controlled via an app.</span>\n                                        <span>Credit: iRobot</span>\n                    </p>\n    </div>\n<p>What's more, these gadgets require a certain level of maintenance: Depending on the device, you need to empty them out, supply them with power, water, and cleaning products, and perhaps even clean parts of them yourself. Like any piece of hardware, they will experience wear and tear, and will eventually need to be replaced.</p><p>There's one other consideration to think about, which is that manual cleaning is a great way to exercise. <a href=\"https://bmcgeriatr.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12877-023-04039-1\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"open in a new window\">Studies have shown</a> that domestic duties can give you enough of a workout to extend your lifespan and improve a host of different health markers, so you might want to use some of the time that these gadgets are saving you to head out for a run or for a session at the gym.</p><h2 id=\"the-best-smart-cleaning-gadgets-you-can-buy\">The best smart cleaning gadgets you can buy</h2><p>If you've decided that you want to transform your home into one that cleans itself, you can automate a number of different processes using a number of different devices. There's plenty of choice out there, so the usual rules apply: Take your time to research the various options and the features they're offering versus their price, and find as many reviews as you can from people who've used them.</p><h3>Robot vacuums and mops</h3><p>This is the obvious place to start, as these are the gadgets that usually come to mind when you think of smart cleaning tech. You can find single-purpose devices that only vacuum or only mop, or devices that combine both functions.</p><p>While early models had their issues with reliability and cleaning power, the robot vacuums you can buy today are generally more impressive in terms of how clean they can get your carpets and floors. You'll find features like LiDAR and camera-powered mapping and obstacle avoidance, self-emptying capabilities, and auto-adjustments depending on what surface is being cleaned. </p><p>Often, everything these machines do can be organized through a companion app, so you can set the cleaners to work on a specific schedule, as well as set zones or rooms that are off limits. We're even starting to see robot vacuums that can <a href=\"https://vacuumwars.com/eufy-marswalker-omni-s2-ifa-2025/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"open in a new window\">climb up the stairs</a>, so they really can get your whole house vacuumed and mopped without an assist.</p><div>\n            <p><span>\n                What do you think so far?\n            </span>\n        </p></div>\n<div>\n    <p><img src=\"https://lifehacker.com/imagery/articles/01K57198V3E3FABSSYCRSRWCH6/images-3.fill.size_2000x1125.v1757951599.jpg\" alt=\"Roborock Saros 10R\" srcset=\"https://lifehacker.com/imagery/articles/01K57198V3E3FABSSYCRSRWCH6/images-3.fill.size_800x450.v1757951599.jpg 800w, https://lifehacker.com/imagery/articles/01K57198V3E3FABSSYCRSRWCH6/images-3.fill.size_1400x788.v1757951599.jpg 1400w, https://lifehacker.com/imagery/articles/01K57198V3E3FABSSYCRSRWCH6/images-3.fill.size_2000x1125.v1757951599.jpg 2000w\" />\n            </p>\n            <p><span>The Roborock Saros 10R comes with its own docking station.</span>\n                                        <span>Credit: Roborock</span>\n                    </p>\n    </div>\n<p>These cleaners can be a significant investment.

Using suction to work their way across windows, cleaning and drying as they go, leaving you with window panes free of dust and grime. Again, these tools can be managed via an app, though a bit more manual setup is required to get them in position to start cleaning.</p><p>The Ecovacs Winbot series includes some of the best window cleaning options on the market at the moment.

These pieces of hardware elevate clothes cleaning with a variety of useful and intelligent tricks, including the ability to adjust cleaning and drying cycles to the type and size of load, remote control via mobile apps, and a number of self-maintaining mechanisms.</p><p>A good example is the <a href=\"https://zdcs.link/9YMkVn?pageview_type=Standard&template=Explainers&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=LG%20WM6700HBA&short_url=9YMkVn&u=https%3A%2F%2Flifehacker.com%2Fhome%2Fall-the-smart-gadgets-for-a-self-cleaning-home&event_label=LG%20WM6700HBA\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"open in a new window\">LG WM6700HBA</a>, which will set you back $1,250. There's on-board AI assistance to work out the best cycles for the clothes you're washing, an automatic dispenser for just the right amount of detergent and fabric softener to cut down on waste, and remote operations and monitoring via the LG ThinQ app.</p><h3>Smart dishwashers</h3><p>Finally we have <strong>smart dishwashers</strong>, which use automated technology to give your crockery and cutlery a better clean than standard appliances might. The features are similar to those you'll find on smart washers and dryers: Sensing technology for understanding what's been loaded in and adjusting the cleaning accordingly, remote app control and smart home integration, and as much automated maintenance and self-cleaning as possible.</p><p>Take a look at the <a href=\"https://zdcs.link/98PJqd?pageview_type=Standard&template=Explainers&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=Bosch%20500%20Series&short_url=98PJqd&u=https%3A%2F%2Flifehacker.com%2Fhome%2Fall-the-smart-gadgets-for-a-self-cleaning-home&event_label=Bosch%20500%20Series\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"open in a new window\">Bosch 500 Series</a>, which is priced at $1,250 at the time of writing.

Whether you want to build a smart security system, turn a “dumb” device smart, or simply control your lights from your phone, this guide will help walk you through it.</em></p>\n        </span>\n    </p>\n    <article>\n        <hr />\n        <p>Smart home devices can streamline a lot of your day-to-day tasks. With an internet connection and some simple automations, you may never have to carry house keys, turn off the lights, or touch your thermostat again. But all of this convenience comes at a potential cost, as smart tech is vulnerable to attack by cyber actors, leaving your personal data and your privacy at risk. </p><p>Here's what you need to know to secure your smart home.</p><h2 id=\"is-your-smart-home-secure\">Is your smart home secure? </h2><p>The short answer: not by default. Smart homes have vulnerabilities at multiple levels, from the devices themselves, to your home network, to the physical endpoints, like your phone, that have access to and control over your Internet of Things (IoT). </p>\n<p>To start, IoT devices may have weak built-in security protocols or lack clear instructions to help users lock them down from factory settings, leaving them vulnerable to hackers, who may have to exert very little effort to access your data or spy on you. Wifi routers and smart home devices often have default credentials that are publicly available and therefore easy to get past—and  <a href=\"https://www.ibm.com/think/insights/router-reality-check-86-percent-default-passwords-have-never-been-changed\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"open in a new window\">data show</a> that the vast majority of users have never changed their router admin password or adjusted any factory settings. If your home network isn't secure, nothing connected to it can be considered secure either. </p><p>Smart devices can also be integrated into botnets, allowing threat actors to conduct malicious activity like account takeovers and malware distribution using your home network. A recent instance of this was <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/tech/this-android-malware-is-attacking-smart-home-devices\" target=\"_blank\">a campaign known as BADBOX 2.0</a>, which targeted off-brand consumer electronics manufactured in China. </p><p>Bill Budington, a senior staff technologist at the <a href=\"https://www.eff.org/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"open in a new window\">Electronic Frontier Foundation</a> (EFF), notes the digital divide may increase the risk for some consumers, who may seek out cheaper devices from low-cost manufacturers that have weaker security and far less to lose in terms of reputation if they are implicated in vulnerabilities as compared to major companies like Amazon. </p><p>Finally, security can be compromised if your physical devices fall into the wrong hands. For example, if you control your smart home using apps on your phone, a threat actor could gain access in the event said phone is lost, stolen, or hacked.  </p><h2 id=\"smart-homes-can-compromise-privacy\">Smart homes can compromise privacy</h2><p>Left unsecured, smart home devices can also put your privacy (and potentially your safety) at risk. Internet-connected cameras, from baby monitors to pet cams, <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/tech/can-someone-spy-through-webcam-or-phone\" target=\"_blank\">are vulnerable to hacking</a>, and threat actors can use them to surveil you and your home. This may include snooping on and tracking your movements, \"shoulder surfing\" to collect sensitive personal information from your devices, recording audio and video footage of your private activities, and sharing or selling live feeds on the dark web. (In <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/nest-baby-monitor-hacked-by-man-who-threatened-kidnapping-2018-12\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"open in a new window\">a particularly alarming incident in 2018</a>, a hacker reportedly issued verbal threats toward a four-month-old child through a Nest-branded baby monitor.)</p><p>Your smart tech is also likely collecting a lot of information about you in the course of its normal activities—all of which could be exploited. For example, your robot vacuum creates and utilizes a map of your home's physical layout to know where to go, and usage patterns from various automations can be used to track your movements and confirm when you're away from home. </p><p>There's also the possibility that your smart home devices are compromising your data in ways you aren't aware of and haven't actively consented to. A <a href=\"https://engineering.nyu.edu/news/new-research-reveals-alarming-privacy-and-security-threats-smart-homes\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"open in a new window\">2023 report from security experts</a>—led by the nonprofit IMDEA Networks and Northeastern University—shows that IoT devices may inadvertently expose personal information that can be harvested and sold to companies involved in surveillance capitalism. Researchers found that spyware apps and advertisers abuse local network protocols to access sensitive data, making it easier to profile users. </p><h2 id=\"no-security-standards-for-smart-homes\">No security standards for smart homes</h2><p>One of the biggest barriers to smart home security is that there isn't a single set of cybersecurity standards that companies have to follow, nor a centralized resource for users to research this information. Earlier this year—during the last few weeks of the Biden administration—the Federal Communications Commission launched the <a href=\"https://www.fcc.gov/CyberTrustMark\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"open in a new window\">U.S. Cyber Trust Mark</a> voluntary labeling program to incentivize device manufacturers to improve security and help consumers buy with confidence. However, under the Trump administration, the agency later <a href=\"https://www.cybersecuritydive.com/news/fcc-cyber-trust-mark-ul-investigation-delay/758507/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"open in a new window\">launched an investigation</a> into the program, delaying its rollout. </p><p>For now, consumers are left to do their own due diligence. In 2017, the nonprofit Mozilla Foundation created a resource called <a href=\"https://www.mozillafoundation.org/en/privacynotincluded/categories/smart-home/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"open in a new window\">*Privacy Not Included</a>, with reviews of products measured against \"minimum security standards\" and breakdowns of any privacy concerns. The site doesn't appear to have been updated in the last year, but you can still find detailed information about the privacy and security history of well-known smart home manufacturers like Amazon, Google, Wyze, and Ecobee. </p><p>Otherwise, Budington suggests simply searching the device you're considering (and the company that makes it) before buying, to see if researchers or users have reported any concerns. </p><div>\n            <p><span>\n                What do you think so far?\n            </span>\n        </p></div>\n<h2 id=\"how-to-improve-your-smart-home-security\">How to improve your smart home security</h2><p>Securing your smart home starts with securing your internet connection via your router. Lifehacker has assembled a whole <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/home/how-to-make-your-home-security-system-and-wireless-network-safe\" target=\"_blank\">guide to protecting your home network</a>, but at the very least, you should change any default router settings—admin usernames, passwords, and network names—to something unique and not personally identifiable, and turn on encryption in your wireless security settings. Regularly check for updates, which provide patches for security flaws, and audit the devices connected to your network to identify anything suspicious and remove those you no longer use. </p><p>You can add another layer of security with a guest network set up specifically for your IoT devices. That way, if your smart devices are compromised, everything connected to your primary network (such as computers and phones with access to your personal and financial accounts) will be protected. </p><p>According to Budington, one way to further mitigate vulnerability is to reduce the number of devices with their own wireless connection, running them through a secure, centralized hub instead. Home Assistant is a <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/tech/self-host-apps\" target=\"_blank\">self-hosted option</a> that can be installed on a Raspberry Pi or a traditional PC or used with the plug-and-play Home Assistant Green. Hubitat also gives you local control over your device data and integrates with a variety of products, including those compatible with the <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/tech/your-most-important-smart-home-decision-is-the-ecosystem-you-choose\" target=\"_blank\">Zigbee, Z-Wave, and Matter standards</a>. </p><p>Once your network is secure, you'll want to <a href=\"https://consumer.ftc.gov/articles/securing-your-internet-connected-devices-home\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"open in a new window\">take similar steps</a> with each of your IoT devices. Change default usernames and passwords to unique, secure alternatives and enable all available security features, such as two-factor authentication and encryption, in the device settings. Ensure your devices (and any apps used to control them) receive automatic firmware updates. </p><p>You should also <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/tech/how-to-protect-your-privacy-when-using-smart-home-tech\" target=\"_blank\">check your device's privacy settings</a>, removing permissions that aren't essential for it to function and disabling features you won't use. For example, you could turn off location tracking on your smart thermostat and disable voice control for devices other than your voice assistant. </p><p>Finally, while we've focused mostly on digital threats, your smart home isn't immune to physical compromise. Be aware of ways your devices can be accessed, such as those installed on the exterior of your house, and ensure phones and tablets and the apps on them that control IoT devices are secured with a PIN or biometric authentication.</p><p>Remember that, by nature, anything connected to the internet is at least somewhat vulnerable to attack. You'll have to consider your own risk tolerance and weigh the convenience of having a smart device against the potential for it to be compromised—and your privacy along with it. You may find that there are some things that you simply don't need to automate, and therefore you can stick with the \"dumb\" alternative. </p>\n            </article>\n    <div>\n    <div>\n        <p><span>The Download Newsletter</span>\n            <span>Never miss a tech story</span>\n        </p>\n        <p><img src=\"https://lifehacker.com/images/team/Jake.png\" alt=\"Jake Peterson portrait\" />\n            <span>Jake Peterson\n            </span>\n        </p>\n        <p><span>Get the latest tech news, <span></span>reviews, <span></span>and advice from Jake and the team.</span>\n    </p></div>\n    <div>\n        <p><span>The Download Newsletter</span>\n            <span><span>Never miss a tech story.</span> Get the latest tech news, <span></span>reviews, <span></span>and advice from Jake and the team.</span>\n        </p>\n    </div>\n</div>\n                        <div>\n                <div>\n                    <p><img src=\"https://lifehacker.com/imagery/authors/01HF2FBGBC5PWJAAJJJHG350CH/image.fill.size_150x150.v1737570988.png\" alt=\"Photo of Emily Long\" />\n                                            </p>\n                </div>\n                <div>\n                                            <div>\n    <p>More by Emily</p>\n        <hr />\n        </div>\n                        <div>\n                <p><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://lifehacker.com/home/make-home-smarter-with-smart-plugs\">\n                    <img src=\"https://lifehacker.com/imagery/articles/01K59HW6N5NJ0YXHKT5P2MGAGY/hero-image.fill.size_75x75.v1759159819.jpg\" alt=\"Smart plugs\" />\n                </a>\n            </p></div>\n        <hr />\n                    <div>\n                <p><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://lifehacker.com/entertainment/wordle-nyt-hint-today-september-30-2025\">\n                    <img src=\"https://lifehacker.com/imagery/articles/01K68RMRZPX32K324ZKZH7GXEJ/hero-image.fill.size_75x75.v1759083390.jpg\" alt=\"wordle art\" />\n                </a>\n            </p></div>\n        <hr />\n                                        </div>\n            </div>\n                                </section>\n                                                </section>\n    </div>"

On the surface, it does sound pretty invasive, especially from a company that typically promotes user privacy. While this really is a new feature, here's the thing: It isn't as bad as it sounds. And, if you really don't like it, you can turn it off.</p><p>The feature, \"Visited Places,\" is actually intended to be a private way to keep tabs on the places you've been to, and to easily recall your favorites in the future. When the feature is enabled, Maps will take note of places you visit, even if you don't use Maps to get there. It's like a passive, automatic journal, taking note of restaurants, malls, parks, or simply general locations you venture to day-to-day. <a href=\"https://support.apple.com/guide/iphone/view-and-mange-visited-places-iph0c2597c4f/ios\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"open in a new window\">According to Apple</a>, all of this information is stored on your synced devices only, and is end-to-end encrypted, which means Apple has no way to access this data. </p><div>\n        <p><img src=\"https://lifehacker.com/images/short-lifehacker-logo.jpg\" alt=\"Lifehacker Logo\" /></p><div>\n            <p><span>You May Also Like</span></p>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n<p>If you have the feature enabled, you'll find your Visited Places appropriately tucked away in the \"Places\" menu when you launch Maps. I've only had the feature turned on for a day or so, so I only have three locations currently saved, but all three were destinations I visited without using Maps to guide me there. </p><p>Personally, I have no issue with keeping this setting turned on: Nobody has access to the data except for me, and I can imagine it reminding me of the places I've enjoyed visiting during a future scroll.</p><div>\n            <p><span>\n                What do you think so far?\n            </span>\n        </p></div>\n<p>Apple says you will be asked to turn on the feature when you open Maps after updating to iOS 26, and, in my experience, that was the case. However, <a href=\"https://www.cnet.com/tech/services-and-software/your-iphones-maps-app-is-tracking-you-in-ios-26-heres-how-to-stop-it/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"open in a new window\">for CNET writer Zachary McAuliffe</a>, the feature was already enabled without his input. As such, it might be smart to double-check that the feature is set to whichever setting you prefer, lest you allow Maps to track your movements without your knowledge. </p><h2 id=\"how-to-manage-visited-places-in-apple-maps\">How to manage 'Visited Places' in Apple Maps  </h2><p>To check whether the feature is turned on or off, head to <strong>Settings > Apps > Maps > Location</strong>. Alternatively, you can go to <strong>Settings > Privacy & Security > Location Services > Maps</strong>. Either way, check the toggle next to \"Visited Places.\" </p><p>You can also delete any Visited Places without needing to turn the feature off altogether. Open Maps, tap \"Places,\" then \"Visited Places.\" Here, you can swipe left on any place to delete it, or choose \"Clear History\" to delete them all. Plus, you can choose how long you want Maps to store your Visited Places: The default is \"Forever,\" but you can also select \"3 Months\" or \"1 Year,\" if you wish. </p>\n            </article>\n    </div>\n<div>\n    <div>\n        <p><span>The Download Newsletter</span>\n            <span>Never miss a tech story</span>\n        </p>\n        <p><img src=\"https://lifehacker.com/images/team/Jake.png\" alt=\"Jake Peterson portrait\" />\n            <span>Jake Peterson\n            </span>\n            <span>Senior tech editor</span>\n        </p>\n        <p><span>Get the latest tech news, <span></span>reviews, <span></span>and advice from Jake and the team.</span>\n    </p></div>\n    <div>\n        <p><span>The Download Newsletter</span>\n            <span><span>Never miss a tech story.</span> Get the latest tech news, <span></span>reviews, <span></span>and advice from Jake and the team.</span>\n        </p>\n    </div>\n</div>\n    </div>\n            <div>\n                <p><span>\n                        Keep Scrolling for Next Article\n                    </span>\n                </p>\n            </div>\n        </div>"

All of these data points come together to build a unique picture of who you are; the more unique your fingerprint, <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/tech/cover-your-tracks-see-whos-following-you-online\" target=\"_blank\">the easier it is to track you</a>, since the odds of someone else with your exact same details is slim. </p><div>\n        <p><img src=\"https://lifehacker.com/images/short-lifehacker-logo.jpg\" alt=\"Lifehacker Logo\" /></p><div>\n            <p><span>You May Also Like</span></p>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n<p>Fingerprinting has a number of applications across the web, but perhaps the largest is for targeted advertising. The reason many of the ads you see are so relevant to your interests and browsing history is because of fingerprinting. Trackers know your internet habits, and can identify and deliver the advertisements you're most likely to click or tap on. Companies can also sell these fingerprinting profiles to brokers and advertisers, making money on both your engagement with ads, as well as your raw data.  </p><p>Advanced Tracking and Fingerprinting Protection simplifies each Safari user's data, so our fingerprints aren't quite so unique. By doing so, it's harder for trackers to identify individuals, and, as such, makes it possible to browser the web more privately. </p><p>This feature was already a thing on iPhone before iOS 26. However, it was limited to Private Browsing by default. If you didn't do all your browsing in a private tab, you likely lost some of these privacy protections, unless you knew to manually change the setting to cover all browsing. The same goes for iPadOS and macOS as well. Most of us probably didn't change the setting, since it's quite buried in each OS' respective settings.</p><div>\n            <p><span>\n                What do you think so far?\n            </span>\n        </p></div>\n<p>Once you update your iPhone, iPad, or Mac to the latest OS, however, your browsing gets these added tracking protections by default.

But there's one area where the smart home of the future became a normal reality while we were barely paying attention: your lights. I've been using smart lights for the better part of a decade and I can't go back to typical lights. </p><p>There are several brands of smart lights from companies like Philips, GE, Wyze, and more that can turn any lamp or light fixture into smart home-controlled lighting. You can use your phone, smart speakers like <a href=\"https://zdcs.link/aADXP4?pageview_type=Standard&template=Explainers&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=Amazon%27s%20Echo&short_url=aADXP4&u=https%3A%2F%2Flifehacker.com%2Fhome%2Fthe-beginners-guide-to-smart-lights&event_label=Amazon%27s%20Echo\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"open in a new window\"><u>Amazon's Echo</u></a> line, or <a href=\"https://zdcs.link/ao6pme?pageview_type=Standard&template=Explainers&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=Google%27s%20Nest&short_url=ao6pme&u=https%3A%2F%2Flifehacker.com%2Fhome%2Fthe-beginners-guide-to-smart-lights&event_label=Google%27s%20Nest\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"open in a new window\"><u>Google's Nest</u></a> speakers. </p><h2 id=\"the-best-smart-light-brands-right-now\">The best smart light brands right now</h2>\n<p>Several major brands manufacture smart lights and, while it is technically possible to mix and match bulbs from different companies, it's easier if you stick to one ecosystem. With that in mind, here are a few of the most established companies and the benefits of each:</p>\n<ul><li><p><strong>The reigning champion: <a href=\"https://zdcs.link/QWEZPd?pageview_type=Standard&template=Explainers&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=Philips%20Hue&short_url=QWEZPd&u=https%3A%2F%2Flifehacker.com%2Fhome%2Fthe-beginners-guide-to-smart-lights&event_label=Philips%20Hue\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"open in a new window\"><u>Philips Hue</u></a></strong><strong>.</strong> These are the lights I personally use. Philips Hue is the most established competitor, with a massive array of bulbs, light strips, lamps and other lighting gear. Its software suite is also one of the most developed, with robust automation tools and colorful scene libraries. Historically, it's also been the most expensive system, but the company recently announced <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/smart-home/768554/philips-hue-essentials-smart-lighting-cheaper-support-matter-thread\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"open in a new window\"><u>a line of cheaper bulbs</u></a>.</p></li><li><p><strong>An inexpensive entry point: <a href=\"https://zdcs.link/9gjB6G?pageview_type=Standard&template=Explainers&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=Wiz&short_url=9gjB6G&u=https%3A%2F%2Flifehacker.com%2Fhome%2Fthe-beginners-guide-to-smart-lights&event_label=Wiz\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"open in a new window\"><u>Wiz</u></a></strong><strong>. </strong>If you don't want to spend $50 per light bulb in your home—and who can blame you?—Wiz is an affordable alternative to Hue. The company offers full-color bulbs that start as low as around $12 per bulb, in a variety of form factors.</p></li><li><p><strong>For stylistic flair: <a href=\"https://zdcs.link/QVEZP3?pageview_type=Standard&template=Explainers&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=LIFX&short_url=QVEZP3&u=https%3A%2F%2Flifehacker.com%2Fhome%2Fthe-beginners-guide-to-smart-lights&event_label=LIFX\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"open in a new window\"><u>LIFX</u></a></strong><strong>.</strong> Similar to Philips Hue, LIFX is a bit more expensive, but the company offers a wide variety of unique, stylish lights, like <a href=\"https://zdcs.link/QKq2PV?pageview_type=Standard&template=Explainers&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=colorful%20tube%20bulbs&short_url=QKq2PV&u=https%3A%2F%2Flifehacker.com%2Fhome%2Fthe-beginners-guide-to-smart-lights&event_label=colorful%20tube%20bulbs\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"open in a new window\"><u>colorful tube bulbs</u></a>, or <a href=\"https://zdcs.link/9YMXPn?pageview_type=Standard&template=Explainers&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=flexible%20LED%20strips&short_url=9YMXPn&u=https%3A%2F%2Flifehacker.com%2Fhome%2Fthe-beginners-guide-to-smart-lights&event_label=flexible%20LED%20strips\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"open in a new window\"><u>flexible LED strips</u></a>. </p></li><li><p><strong>For customizable lighting arrays: <a href=\"https://zdcs.link/98PKkd?pageview_type=Standard&template=Explainers&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=Nanoleaf&short_url=98PKkd&u=https%3A%2F%2Flifehacker.com%2Fhome%2Fthe-beginners-guide-to-smart-lights&event_label=Nanoleaf\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"open in a new window\"><u>Nanoleaf</u></a></strong><strong>.</strong> While Nanoleaf technically makes its own series of typical <a href=\"https://zdcs.link/QPVdPP?pageview_type=Standard&template=Explainers&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=smart%20light%20bulbs&short_url=QPVdPP&u=https%3A%2F%2Flifehacker.com%2Fhome%2Fthe-beginners-guide-to-smart-lights&event_label=smart%20light%20bulbs\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"open in a new window\"><u>smart light bulbs</u></a>, the company is best known for its modular lighting kits. These kits come in shapes like <a href=\"https://zdcs.link/911KNn?pageview_type=Standard&template=Explainers&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=hexagons&short_url=911KNn&u=https%3A%2F%2Flifehacker.com%2Fhome%2Fthe-beginners-guide-to-smart-lights&event_label=hexagons\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"open in a new window\"><u>hexagons</u></a>, <a href=\"https://zdcs.link/aeKnO2?pageview_type=Standard&template=Explainers&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=lines&short_url=aeKnO2&u=https%3A%2F%2Flifehacker.com%2Fhome%2Fthe-beginners-guide-to-smart-lights&event_label=lines\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"open in a new window\"><u>lines</u></a>, <a href=\"https://zdcs.link/QLMdPo?pageview_type=Standard&template=Explainers&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=blocks&short_url=QLMdPo&u=https%3A%2F%2Flifehacker.com%2Fhome%2Fthe-beginners-guide-to-smart-lights&event_label=blocks\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"open in a new window\"><u>blocks</u></a>, and more. Each piece can be individually controlled, and you can combine them to make your own designs for wall lighting. They're not subtle, but they're fun as heck.</p></li></ul><p>These are just a few of the many companies out there producing smart lights. While a few like Philips Hue require dedicated hubs to make their lights work, most companies are now focused on making standalone bulbs that can connect directly to wifi.</p><p>The <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/why-you-need-matter-the-new-open-standard-for-smart-1850826525\" target=\"_blank\"><u>growing Matter standard</u></a> is also (slowly) making it easier to integrate lights from multiple companies. While you'll still likely need to refer to a company's own app or hub to make some changes, Matter-compatible smart lights can usually replace the need to look for \"Works With Google Home\" or similar labels for your specific setup.</p><h2 id=\"what-you-need-to-set-up-smart-lights\">What you need to set up smart lights</h2><p>In most cases, the only thing you'll technically need to set up smart lights is the lights themselves. Most smart light manufacturers at least make bulbs compatible with A19 sockets (the kind in most of your lighting fixtures and lamps), and ecosystems like Wiz, LIFX, and GE's Cync don't require a dedicated hub. Philips Hue, notably, does. And if you're getting into Hue now, you're probably best off <a href=\"https://zdcs.link/9ZMpPM?pageview_type=Standard&template=Explainers&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=getting%20the%20Hue%20Bridge%20Pro&short_url=9ZMpPM&u=https%3A%2F%2Flifehacker.com%2Fhome%2Fthe-beginners-guide-to-smart-lights&event_label=getting%20the%20Hue%20Bridge%20Pro\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"open in a new window\"><u>getting the Hue Bridge Pro</u></a>, which supports syncing lights to your media, using your bulbs as motion sensors, and more new features.</p><p>While that's technically all you <em>need</em> to set up smart lights, there are a few things you can get to make even better use of your new system:</p><ul><li><p><strong>A smart speaker.</strong> I cannot emphasize enough how great it feels to turn your bedroom lights off while tucked snugly under the covers. Voice-controlled speakers like Google Nest and Amazon Echo devices are excellent for this.</p></li><li><p><strong>A smart display.</strong> The one downside to smart lights is that you can't use switches on the walls the same way anymore (more on that later). But a smart display can be a huge improvement. Google Nest Hubs or Amazon Echo Show devices can put an array of controls for your smart lights in a prominent place so anyone in your home can not only turn lights on and off with a tap, but change lighting levels or color scenes.</p></li><li><p><strong>Some smartphone widgets.</strong> While all of the above are convenient, more often than not, you'll probably have your phone on you. Some smart light manufacturers build robust widgets for iPhone and Android devices, so you can tap a button on your home screen to turn your lights on and off. It's worth checking to see which features a company supports before committing to an ecosystem.</p></li></ul><p>The last things you'll need to set up your smart lights are time and patience. While the process has gotten a lot simpler than it was even a few years ago, you might need to spend a bit of time fiddling with room names, syncing services, and testing out a few commands. Fortunately, you usually only need to do this once. I've even moved to a new home and kept my old setup largely intact.</p><h2 id=\"what-you-can-do-with-smart-lights\">What you can do with smart lights</h2><p>\"Okay, sure, smart lights are getting cheaper, but are they really worth the extra money over simple bulbs and a wall switch that's worked for decades?\" I hear you cry. And I'm here to tell you, absolutely, yes. I've used a lot of new tech over the years that's fun at first, but annoying once the novelty wears off. But smart lights are one of the few areas where I never want to go back.</p><div>\n            <p><span>\n                What do you think so far?\n            </span>\n        </p></div>\n<p>Here are a few of the ways I make use of smart lights on a regular basis:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Change lights with the sun.</strong> During the day, the bright, cool light coming in from your windows has a different quality than the warm, dimmer lights you're used to from lamps. With smart lights, you can set your bulbs to automatically adjust based on a set schedule (or your local sunrise/sunset) to ease the lighting conditions in your home.</p></li><li><p><strong>Set the mood for date night... </strong>Sometimes, all it takes to turn a regular Tuesday night into a romantic evening is a simple shift in mood lighting. I have a few scenes in my Philips Hue app saved for when I want to create some nice ambiance for my partner when we're having a chill evening in.</p></li><li><p><strong>…or for self-care.</strong> Similar to the above, one of my favorite Hue scenes is an animation that mimics the flickering of candlelight. Set the lights in your bathroom to this scene, draw a warm bath, toss in a bath bomb, and have the most relaxing night in.</p></li><li><p><strong>Simulate activity while you're away. </strong>One of the best ways to make a local burglar think twice about trying to enter your home is to convince them someone is there. With lighting schedules, you can set your home to turn lights on and off even while you're away.</p></li><li><p><strong>Turn lights on automatically for you.</strong> Ever trip over things in the dark while you're bringing in groceries? No more. Most smart light ecosystems allow you to automatically turn on certain lights when you enter a geofenced area (like your home). Alternatively, some suites like Philips Hue have motion-sensing features so you can turn lights on when you enter a room, without relying on tools like GPS.</p></li></ul><p>With <a href=\"https://ifttt.com/explore/smart-lights-collection\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"open in a new window\"><u>automation services like IFTTT</u></a>, you can even set up more complex controls—e.g., flashing lights when your doorbell rings, or blinking a light in your office when you get an email from your boss.</p><h2 id=\"smart-light-switches-make-it-all-even-easier\">Smart light switches make it all even easier</h2>\n<p>When I first set up smart lights in my home, my loved ones were mostly on board, but there was one point of contention: the light switch. People are still generally used to flipping switches when they enter a room. With smart lights, they generally need to stay on all the time, and you even need to retrain your muscle memory a bit to not forget and accidentally turn them off manually.</p><p>There are two main ways to fix this in the smart home world, and which one you need can depend on how much effort you want to put in (and, frankly, whether you rent or own your home):</p><ul><li><p><strong>In-wall smart light switches.</strong> Some smart light switches, like <a href=\"https://zdcs.link/aADXk4?pageview_type=Standard&template=Explainers&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=this%20one%20from%20LIFX&short_url=aADXk4&u=https%3A%2F%2Flifehacker.com%2Fhome%2Fthe-beginners-guide-to-smart-lights&event_label=this%20one%20from%20LIFX\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"open in a new window\"><u>this one from LIFX</u></a> can be installed directly in place of your existing light switches. This one lets you turn a light on or off from the wall switch, without cutting off the ability to turn it back on from a voice command or smart phone app. Since it also replaces the old switch, there's less need to adjust your muscle memory.</p></li><li><p><strong>Remote control switches.</strong> If you don't want to (or can't) replace your in-wall light switches, companies like Philips Hue offer a handy alternative in the form of <a href=\"https://zdcs.link/aN8bP3?pageview_type=Standard&template=Explainers&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=remote%20switches&short_url=aN8bP3&u=https%3A%2F%2Flifehacker.com%2Fhome%2Fthe-beginners-guide-to-smart-lights&event_label=remote%20switches\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"open in a new window\"><u>remote switches</u></a>. These provide buttons you can use to turn on/off or dim lights from a battery-powered remote. This model in particular comes with a plate you can stick on your wall next to your regular switch, while the remote is removable so you can take it with you around the room.

    "body": "<article>\n        <hr />\n        <p><em>Did you know you can customize Google to filter out garbage? <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/tech/you-can-now-tell-google-which-websites-you-prefer-search-results\" target=\"_blank\">Take these steps</a></em><em> for better search results, <a href=\"https://www.google.com/preferences/source?q=lifehacker.com\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"open in a new window\">including adding my work at Lifehacker as a preferred source</a></em><em>.</em></p><hr /><p>Earlier this month, we saw a new running world record—more specifically, running backwards. In heels. Christian Roberto López Rodríguez <a href=\"https://www.guinnessworldrecords.com/news/2025/9/serial-speedster-claims-another-running-record-with-backwards-sprint-in-high-heels\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"open in a new window\">claimed the fastest</a> 100m backwards<em> in high heels</em> with an impressive time of 16.55 seconds.</p><p>I may not be setting that sort of record, but I do see running backwards crop up <a href=\"https://www.therunningweek.com/post/should-you-start-running-backwards-heres-what-science-says\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"open in a new window\">time</a> and <a href=\"https://marathonhandbook.com/retro-running-backwards/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"open in a new window\">time again</a> as a trendy idea for the average runner. Sometimes called \"reverse running,\" it's exactly what it sounds like: runners literally turning around and jogging backwards. But does running backwards genuinely help improve forward running performance, or is it simply another fitness fad destined to fade?</p>\n<h2 id=\"does-running-backwards-actually-help\">Does running backwards actually help?</h2><p>From a physiological perspective, backwards running fundamentally alters how your body moves and which muscles bear the workload. Physiotherapist <a href=\"https://www.saunny.com/pages/about-us\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"open in a new window\">Alex Lee</a> explains the dramatic shift that occurs when you reverse direction: \"Your quadriceps do the majority of the job of slowing your body down. Your hamstrings work differently too because they aren't pushing you forwards. This variation alleviates stress from the knee joint, specifically the ACL.\" He further explains how running backwards also causes your ankles to \"move with greater dorsiflexion,\" which trains balance and body awareness, known as <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/you-can-actually-do-something-about-how-clumsy-you-are-1848970465\" target=\"_blank\">proprioception</a>.</p><p>As any runner can attest, going easy on the knees is a major draw. Lee notes additional advantages when he trains athletes, explaining how he incorporates running backwards to \"shield their knees, develop leg strength, and enhance coordination.\" </p><p>While the biomechanical benefits are real, running coach <a href=\"https://www.runbaldwin.com/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"open in a new window\">Will Baldwin</a> offers a more measured approach to backwards running's place in training programs. \"I think the biggest benefit from running backwards is it helps you engage some of your posterior chain and muscles that aren't typically recruited in forward running, like your glutes, some hamstring, and it helps with your pushback a little bit,\" Baldwin explains.</p><p>However, he's quick to temper expectations about performance gains: \"I don't think it makes runners faster. It's probably a good supplemental tool. I don't even think it's a necessity in training, but it definitely can wake some muscles up and can be a fun, different type of coordination skill to work on that's still similar to running.\"</p><p>Baldwin's perspective highlights a crucial consideration in training philosophy—the principle of <em>specificity</em>. \"The law of specificity applies here. If we want to get better at a skill, we need to practice that skill in the specific way we want to compete. We've got to be careful with how much time we waste, especially for busy people. That could be time better spent doing core work or some specific strength training.\"</p><p>For most recreational runners juggling work, family, and training, Baldwin suggests backwards running falls into the \"nice to have\" rather than \"must have\" category: \"You'd really have to be someone with a lot of extra time to experiment and play around with things like this.\"</p><h2 id=\"getting-started-safely\">Getting started safely</h2><p>Running backwards is awkward at best, and genuinely risky at worst. You could fall, and it's easy to twist an ankle or pull something because you can't see where you're landing. If you'd like to experiment with backwards running, start conservatively. Baldwin suggests beginning with walking: \"If someone wanted to try it, I'd start with <em>walking</em> backwards. Especially uphill, on a treadmill or outside, it can really engage, work, and stretch certain muscles. It can be a fun skill to play with, but I'd definitely start with walking before running backwards.\"</p><div>\n            <p><span>\n                What do you think so far?\n            </span>\n        </p></div>\n<p>This gradual approach allows your body to adapt to the different movement patterns while minimizing injury risk. Treadmills provide an ideal controlled environment for initial backwards movement practice, eliminating the hazard of unseen obstacles.</p><p>The bigger concerns, according to Baldwin, relate to training efficiency: \"Wasted time and lack of specificity are probably the bigger ones, but again, not major.\" For time-strapped runners, the opportunity cost of backwards running sessions might outweigh the supplemental benefits.</p><h2 id=\"the-bottom-line\">The bottom line</h2><p>Backwards running offers legitimate benefits—improved proprioception, reduced knee stress, enhanced muscle activation patterns, and increased coordination. </p><p>However, for the average recreational runner seeking to improve their forward running times, backwards running is more of a fun bonus activity, rather than a true game-changer. The time investment might be better allocated to proven <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/health/how-to-do-fartlek-runs\" target=\"_blank\">training methods</a> like tempo runs, interval training, strength work, or simply building up more forward-running mileage.</p><p>Backwards running sits comfortably in the category of \"helpful but not essential\" training methods. It's not the revolutionary breakthrough <a href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/@prolongevityfitness/video/6857672364050713861\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"open in a new window\">some social media posts</a> might suggest, but it's also not entirely without merit. Like many <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/health/is-exercising-on-all-fours-really-better\" target=\"_blank\">fitness trends</a>, the truth lies somewhere between.</p><p>So, for runners with specific needs—such as rehabilitation from knee injuries, athletes requiring enhanced proprioception, or those simply seeking variety in their training routine—backwards running can serve a valuable purpose. For everyone else, it remains an interesting option worth considering if time and safety conditions permit, but not a priority that should displace more fundamental aspects of training.</p>\n            </article>"

target=\"_blank\">In April of 2024</a>, President Biden signed a law forcing the app's parent company, ByteDance, to sell its majority stake to an American company, or face a ban in the U.S. ByteDance never did, and so, in January, <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/tech/how-to-use-tiktok-if-its-banned-in-the-us\" target=\"_blank\">the app went dark</a>.</p><p>It was mostly performative, however. Then President-elect Trump had already assured TikTok that his incoming administration would not enforce the ban, as did the outgoing President Biden. As such, once Trump was sworn in, he signed an executive order kicking the TikTok ban down the road. Trump continued to delay enforcing the ban, which, <a href=\"https://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/columnist/2025/06/25/trump-tiktok-ban-delay-extended/84323075007/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"open in a new window\">while legally dubious</a>, allowed the app to continue operating as usual. </p><div>\n        <p><img src=\"https://lifehacker.com/images/short-lifehacker-logo.jpg\" alt=\"Lifehacker Logo\" /></p><div>\n            <p><span>You May Also Like</span></p>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n<p>It seems, however, this wild ride is coming to a close. On Thursday, Trump <a href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/09/saving-tiktok-while-protecting-national-security/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"open in a new window\">signed an executive order</a> that sets the stage for a U.S.-majority stake in TikTok. <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2025/09/25/trump-approves-tiktok-deal-through-executive-order.html\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"open in a new window\">Nothing is set in stone</a>, but American companies like Oracle, as well as individuals like Larry Ellison (Oracle co-founder) and Rupert Murdoch could be among the newest owners of the app. Curiously, a non-American company, the Abu Dhabi-based MGX investment fund, would also be involved. This joint venture would control a majority of the new American TikTok, while ByteDance would control less than 20%. </p><p>Trump says Chinese President Xi Jinping has okayed the deal, though no Chinese representatives were present at the order's signing. Again, nothing is for certain at this point, but we can take a look at the early details to get a sense for how a new \"America-approved\" TikTok would operate in the U.S.</p><h2 id=\"how-would-tiktok-change-in-the-us\">How would TikTok change in the US?</h2><p>First things first: the app itself. It's highly possible you'll need to download a new app entirely in order to keep using TikTok. This has been <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/tech/how-tiktoks-new-app-may-affect-you\" target=\"_blank\">a focus of speculation for a couple months now</a>, but <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2025/09/25/tiktok-deal-sale-algorithm-changes/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"open in a new window\">as the Washington Post reports</a>, TikTok engineers have been working on a U.S.-version of the app. The new app will likely appear identical to the TikTok experience you already know, and, in fact, might be accessible via a link within the current app. The Post makes the point that the harder it is for users to access the new TikTok app, the higher the chance they leave the platform entirely for alternatives like Instagram and YouTube, so TikTok engineers will no doubt be working on ways to make the transition as seamless as possible. </p><p>Then, there's the famous algorithm. This is what makes TikTok so addictive; the app's algorithm is so good, it learns what you like and shows you content to keep you scrolling for hours. Without the algorithm, TikTok very well could lose its addictive nature, and, along with it, its users. The Post reports that, at least at this time, the algorithm is staying put, and will be leased out from ByteDance by the new American TikTok venture. Plus, you should still be able to see international content going forward, not just videos posted by Americans. TikTok should, in theory, be as entertaining (and addicting) as ever. </p><div>\n            <p><span>\n                What do you think so far?\n            </span>\n        </p></div>\n<p>But that's not the end of the story. According to Trump's executive order, the algorithm will be \"retrained and monitored\" by \"trusted security partners\" of the U.S. That does not necessarily inspire confidence in a neutral algorithm for Americans, <a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/tech-news/trump-signs-executive-order-tiktok-deal-know-rcna233518\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"open in a new window\">especially as Trump says he would make it \"100% MAGA\" if he could</a>. </p><p>Finally, there's the question of user data. This was a major concern of the U.S. government, and part of why both the Trump and Biden administrations went after the app. <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/tech/tiktok-isnt-banned-yet#how-did-we-get-here\" target=\"_blank\">It wasn't without reason either</a>, as we learned ByteDance did in fact store American user data and had used it to obtain the IP addresses of American journalists. According to the executive order, all user data from the U.S. version of TikTok will need to be stored in a cloud environment operated by an American company.</p><p>We'll need to see how both ByteDance and the Chinese government address the executive order and potential divestiture going forward, as things could change. As of now, however, it seems both nothing will change, and everything will change. You'll still be able to endlessly scroll through your feed as you do now, but you may need to use a new, yet identical version of the app to do so. You may see the same content you do now, or you might start to see some new content, suspiciously aligned with the values of the current administration. And your data will still be controlled by a faceless third-party, only now it'll be by your own country, rather than a foreign nation.</p>\n            </article>\n    </div>\n<div>\n    <div>\n        <p><span>The Download Newsletter</span>\n            <span>Never miss a tech story</span>\n        </p>\n        <p><img src=\"https://lifehacker.com/images/team/Jake.png\" alt=\"Jake Peterson portrait\" />\n            <span>Jake Peterson\n            </span>\n            <span>Senior tech editor</span>\n        </p>\n        <p><span>Get the latest tech news, <span></span>reviews, <span></span>and advice from Jake and the team.</span>\n    </p></div>\n    <div>\n        <p><span>The Download Newsletter</span>\n            <span><span>Never miss a tech story.</span> Get the latest tech news, <span></span>reviews, <span></span>and advice from Jake and the team.</span>\n        </p>\n    </div>\n</div>\n    </div>\n            <div>\n                <p><span>\n                        Keep Scrolling for Next Article\n                    </span>\n                </p>\n            </div>\n        </div>\n    </div>"

/><p>Summer and fall are the perfect time to prepare for standardized aptitude tests. Prepping through summer will help you be ready for a fall exam, giving you enough time to retake for a higher score it in the spring, if needed, or you can prep through fall and target that spring test. Even if you studied all summer, fall is the ideal time to review and cram down to the last minute. And no matter how you tend to learn, an app can probably help. Here are some of the best ones available on iOS and Android (some are available on a browser, too). </p><h2 id=\"try-khan-academy-if-youre-a-long-term-learner\">Try Khan Academy if you’re a long-term learner</h2><div>\n    <p><img src=\"https://lifehacker.com/imagery/articles/01HF2GN863974CE5FQNADJRYFV/images-1.fill.size_2000x1125.v1759174244.png\" alt=\"Khan Academy in browsr\" srcset=\"https://lifehacker.com/imagery/articles/01HF2GN863974CE5FQNADJRYFV/images-1.fill.size_800x450.v1759174244.png 800w, https://lifehacker.com/imagery/articles/01HF2GN863974CE5FQNADJRYFV/images-1.fill.size_1400x788.v1759174244.png 1400w, https://lifehacker.com/imagery/articles/01HF2GN863974CE5FQNADJRYFV/images-1.fill.size_2000x1125.v1759174244.png 2000w\" />\n            </p>\n            <p><span></span>\n                                        <span>Credit: Khan Academy</span>\n                    </p>\n    </div>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.khanacademy.org/downloads\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"open in a new window\">Khan Academy</a>, a nonprofit organization and partner of the College Board, has become synonymous with test prep. They have free courses in various AP classes, a variety of subjects, and, of course, standardized tests like the SAT and LSAT—which means if you start with Khan while you prepare for the SAT, you can stick with it all the way through wherever your educational journey takes you. </p><div>\n        <p><img src=\"https://lifehacker.com/images/short-lifehacker-logo.jpg\" alt=\"Lifehacker Logo\" /></p><div>\n            <p><span>You May Also Like</span></p>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n<p>Beyond having a deep selection of study materials, Khan Academy serves up information in video form, with clips that go through practice problems similar to the ones you could face on your exam. For real-deal practice questions, you’ll need to use the desktop version of the site, but the app-based videos are great to take on the go.</p><p>What I like about Khan is that some of the videos and articles are informational. For instance, you can read about calculator policies for the SAT or watch a quick clip that gives you an overview of what the test is and what to expect. Studying material is one thing, but being prepared for the experience is another, and this app is well-rounded there. </p><h2 id=\"use-magooshs-sat-app-for-customized-prep\">Use Magoosh’s SAT app for customized prep</h2><div>\n    <p><img src=\"https://lifehacker.com/imagery/articles/01HF2GN863974CE5FQNADJRYFV/images-2.fill.size_2000x1133.v1759174244.png\" alt=\"Magoosh SAT in iOS\" srcset=\"https://lifehacker.com/imagery/articles/01HF2GN863974CE5FQNADJRYFV/images-2.fill.size_800x453.v1759174244.png 800w, https://lifehacker.com/imagery/articles/01HF2GN863974CE5FQNADJRYFV/images-2.fill.size_1400x793.v1759174244.png 1400w, https://lifehacker.com/imagery/articles/01HF2GN863974CE5FQNADJRYFV/images-2.fill.size_2000x1133.v1759174244.png 2000w\" />\n            </p>\n            <p><span></span>\n                                        <span>Credit: Magoosh</span>\n                    </p>\n    </div>\n<p><a href=\"https://sat.magoosh.com/sat-apps\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"open in a new window\">Magoosh</a> flashcards and practice quizzes go over English and math concepts you should know for your test. Out of all the apps, the Practice & Prep offering is unique because it's dedicated purely to the SAT, but it is customizable. The first time you log in, you're prompted to share when your test is so the app can configure what you should study between now and then. There will be a difference in how you approach it if you have one month or one year to get ready and Magoosh's app knows that.</p><p>Like Khan Academy, this platform gives you information on the test itself, too, offering up a landing page of articles on how to prepare. Beyond that, you get practice questions, videos on the reading and writing sections, and practice tests. While flashcards and study games are useful, practice quizzes are pretty crucial, too, because they give you a better sense of how you'll perform when you're facing down a large volume of content. </p><p>Bear in mind there are <a href=\"https://sat.magoosh.com/sat-apps\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"open in a new window\">two apps</a> from this company: I like the Practice & Prep, obviously, because it's so customizable and helpful with the quizzes, but there is a separate flashcard app available if you learn better that way and want to double up on the methods you use for studying. </p><h2 id=\"use-varsity-tutors-sat-practice-prep-flashcards-if-you-want-the-most-variety\">Use Varsity Tutors’ SAT: Practice, Prep, Flashcards if you want the most variety</h2><div>\n    <p><img src=\"https://lifehacker.com/imagery/articles/01HF2GN863974CE5FQNADJRYFV/images-3.fill.size_2000x1130.v1759174244.png\" alt=\"Varsity Tutors SAT in iOS\" srcset=\"https://lifehacker.com/imagery/articles/01HF2GN863974CE5FQNADJRYFV/images-3.fill.size_800x452.v1759174244.png 800w, https://lifehacker.com/imagery/articles/01HF2GN863974CE5FQNADJRYFV/images-3.fill.size_1400x791.v1759174244.png 1400w, https://lifehacker.com/imagery/articles/01HF2GN863974CE5FQNADJRYFV/images-3.fill.size_2000x1130.v1759174244.png 2000w\" />\n            </p>\n            <p><span></span>\n                                        <span>Credit: Varsity Tutors</span>\n                    </p>\n    </div>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.varsitytutors.com/sat-mobile-app\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"open in a new window\">Varsity Tutors</a> is another well-known name in the studying space, and the company's SAT app is thorough.

The beauty of <a href=\"https://www.brainscape.com/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"open in a new window\">Brainscape</a> is that while it's a flashcard app and those are a dime a dozen, it has some legitimacy attached to it because the company works directly with the governing bodies that oversee tests when it creates flashcard decks. AP tests, certification exams, and the SAT are just a few of the options you can study with the knowledge that the questions you're reviewing are actually relevant to the test. Like other apps, Brainscape has an option for reviewing user-generated flashcard decks, too, and that's great—but start with the deck that's been created with the SAT organization itself. </p><p>Crucially, Brainscape uses a version of <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/leitner-system-flashcard-studying\" target=\"_blank\">the Leitner method</a> to quiz you. When you finish answering a flashcard, you indicate how well you knew the answer on a scale of one to five. That determines how often that same card is shown to you, with the lesser-known cards cropping up more frequently and the better-mastered cards popping up less often— it forces you to study more effectively, which is a winning strategy. </p><h2 id=\"use-notebooklm-to-shake-things-up\">Use NotebookLM to shake things up</h2><div>\n    <p><img src=\"https://lifehacker.com/imagery/articles/01HF2GN863974CE5FQNADJRYFV/images-5.fill.size_2000x1125.v1759174244.png\" alt=\"NotebookLM in browser\" srcset=\"https://lifehacker.com/imagery/articles/01HF2GN863974CE5FQNADJRYFV/images-5.fill.size_800x450.v1759174244.png 800w, https://lifehacker.com/imagery/articles/01HF2GN863974CE5FQNADJRYFV/images-5.fill.size_1400x788.v1759174244.png 1400w, https://lifehacker.com/imagery/articles/01HF2GN863974CE5FQNADJRYFV/images-5.fill.size_2000x1125.v1759174244.png 2000w\" />\n            </p>\n            <p><span></span>\n                                        <span>Credit: Google</span>\n                    </p>\n    </div>\n<p>Finally, if you're a student or learner of any kind, not just an SAT-prepper, I recommend <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/tech/google-notebooklm-review\" target=\"_blank\">Google's NotebookLM AI tool</a>. It's like any other AI chatbot except that it doesn't pull its responses from the Internet. Instead, it relies only on information you feed it. If you have SAT prep tests or study materials from school, a tutor, a guidance counselor, or online, you can upload them into <a href=\"https://notebooklm.google.com/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"open in a new window\">NotebookLM</a> and ask the software to generate a practice quiz, flashcards, summary, or even a \"podcast\" that features two voices discussing the content. No matter how you learn best, NotebookLM has a feature to support you. </p><p>Importantly, it only uses the materials you upload, like I said. This means you won't get any random or incorrect content from the far reaches of the Internet; you'll only get information you select and input. ChatGPT gets things wrong all the time (and I have seen it <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/the-best-ways-to-study-but-not-cheat-using-ai-tools\" target=\"_blank\">generate complete nonsense</a> when dealing with people I tutor in writing), so this is a welcome resource if you like using AI but are worried about being misled.

No longer. These days, you can download a free app on any smartphone, and instantly have the tools necessary to put together a legitimate video, especially for social media platforms like TikTok,  Instagram, and YouTube. </p><p>It would have been difficult to imagine something like Adobe Premiere working properly on a smartphone in the heyday of desktop video editing, but these days, it's a reality. Perhaps that's why Adobe is changing with the times. Following its <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/tech/photoshop-is-officially-available-on-iphone-and-android\" target=\"_blank\">Photoshop mobile app</a> rollout earlier this year, <a href=\"https://apps.apple.com/us/app/adobe-premiere-video-editor/id6742757464\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"open in a new window\">Adobe released an official version of Premiere for iPhone on Tuesday</a>. The company had announced the news <a href=\"https://blog.adobe.com/en/publish/2025/09/04/adobe-premiere-bringing-pro-quality-video-editing-to-your-iphone\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"open in a new window\">at the beginning of the month</a>, and confirmed an Android version is in the works. </p><div>\n        <p><img src=\"https://lifehacker.com/images/short-lifehacker-logo.jpg\" alt=\"Lifehacker Logo\" /></p><div>\n            <p><span>You May Also Like</span></p>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n<h2 id=\"premiere-for-iphone\">Premiere for iPhone </h2><p>According to Adobe, if you're familiar with Premiere, you'll be familiar with its mobile adaptation. There's the same multi-track timeline, with \"vibrant colors and dynamic audio waveforms,\" that supports frame-by-frame trimming, layering, and tuning. There are automatic captions, subtitles, layers for video, audio, text, and 4K HDR support. </p><p>Unlike the current desktop version of Premiere, which requires a subscription, the mobile version of Premiere is free to download and use. Adobe says that only users who need extra storage or want to use the app's AI features need to pay—though it doesn't appear that Adobe has released pricing information yet. To that point, Adobe is pushing some of its AI features here, including Generative Sound Effects, which combines your voice with text prompts to produce a stylized voice over. There's also Enhance Speech, which uses AI in an attempt to improve the quality of your voice recordings.</p><p>You can also use <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/tech/adobe-is-also-making-an-ai-video-generator\" target=\"_blank\">Adobe Firefly</a>, the company's AI content generator, to generate video, image, and audio assets. Adobe says Firefly content is safe for commercial use, so you should have no issue including generations in your content. In addition, you can tap into any of the assets in the Adobe Stock library, which includes music, sound effects, photos, graphics, and videos. </p><p>While it seems like the major editing tools you'd expect from the full Premiere app are here, there's no doubt this experience was designed for mobile—and the platforms that mobile video editors tend to produce for. Adobe says you can export your projects instantly to platforms like TikTok, YouTube Shorts, or Instagram—as well as Premiere Pro, if you have it—in case you'd like to finish the video in these apps. If you complete the video in Premiere, you can publish the finished product directly to TikTok, YouTube Shorts, and Instagram. Videos can also automatically resize depending on the platform you're sending it to.  </p><h2 id=\"will-premiere-on-mobile-be-worth-it\">Will Premiere on mobile be worth it?</h2><p>There are <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/tech/the-best-alternatives-to-capcut\" target=\"_blank\">a lot of video editing apps out there</a> specifically designed for mobile use. That's not to say Premiere won't be a good editing option: Adobe's editor is popular for a reason, and if they've properly designed it to work on an iPhone or Android, it could be a serious threat to existing options like CapCut and LumaFusion. In fact, the company has already dipped its toe into mobile editors before, with Adobe Premiere Rush. That app is much more basic than the version of Premiere Adobe is announcing today.    </p><div>\n            <p><span>\n                What do you think so far?\n            </span>\n        </p></div>\n<p>Many users will likely enjoy trying out the app free of charge, and I know most (if not all) will have no problem shirking Adobe's expensive subscriptions. However, as the saying goes, if a product is free, <em>you</em> are the product. According to Premiere's App Privacy report in the App Store, there's a lot of data Adobe collects from you when using this app, including:</p><ul><li><p>Purchases </p></li><li><p>Contact Info</p></li><li><p>User Content</p></li><li><p>Identifiers</p></li><li><p>Usage Data</p></li><li><p>Location (not linked to you)</p></li><li><p>Diagnostics (not linked to you)</p></li></ul><p><a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20250904132416/https://apps.apple.com/us/app/adobe-premiere-video-editor/id6742757464\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"open in a new window\">This is actually an improvement from the initial announcement</a>. Back then, Search History and \"Other Data\" were part of the data collection list, as they are with Adobe Premiere Rush. More concerningly, these data points, along with Location data, were linked to your identity. If Adobe had kept the privacy policies the same, the company would know where you were when editing your videos. At some point in the past month, that changed.</p><p>But there's no denying there are some privacy trade-offs here. Sure, it's great to have a full-fledged video editor on your iPhone, but will it be worth the privacy invasion? It's not the only one of Adobe's apps to collect this much data, nor does Adobe have <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/tech/adobe-has-responded-to-criticism-of-its-new-terms-of-service\" target=\"_blank\">the best track record</a> when it comes to user privacy, but still, it's worth a consideration before you use it. LumaFusion, for example, does not collect any data that is linked to your identity. The data it does collect—identifiers, diagnostics, and usage data—is anonymized, so it can't be traced back to you, though the app does cost $30. While Premiere is not alone in its data collection policies, understand that any purchases, contacts, content, or data generated by your usage can be collected by Adobe and tied to you.  </p><p>If Premiere for mobile is as capable an editor as Premiere Pro, I imagine this could make for a great experience, especially for those already in the Adobe ecosystem. For others, there may be some compromises to weigh.</p>\n            </article>\n    </div>\n<div>\n    <div>\n        <p><span>The Download Newsletter</span>\n            <span>Never miss a tech story</span>\n        </p>\n        <p><img src=\"https://lifehacker.com/images/team/Jake.png\" alt=\"Jake Peterson portrait\" />\n            <span>Jake Peterson\n            </span>\n            <span>Senior tech editor</span>\n        </p>\n        <p><span>Get the latest tech news, <span></span>reviews, <span></span>and advice from Jake and the team.</span>\n    </p></div>\n    <div>\n        <p><span>The Download Newsletter</span>\n            <span><span>Never miss a tech story.</span> Get the latest tech news, <span></span>reviews, <span></span>and advice from Jake and the team.</span>\n        </p>\n    </div>\n</div>\n    </div>\n            <div>\n                <p><span>\n                        Keep Scrolling for Next Article\n                    </span>\n                </p>\n            </div>\n        </div>\n    </div>"
