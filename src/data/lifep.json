By default, trackers steal a <em>lot</em> of your data while you browse the web, but simple settings can block a lot of those trackers from functioning. As it turns out, <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/tech/the-best-five-ios-26-features\" target=\"_blank\">by updating to iOS 26</a>, your iPhone gets an upgraded tool against tracking.</p><p>The feature, called Advanced Tracking and Fingerprinting Protection, is an option in Safari that hides certain browser and device data trackers typically use to build a <a href=\"https://www.cnet.com/tech/services-and-software/enable-this-ios-26-privacy-feature-to-make-it-harder-for-others-to-track-you/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"open in a new window\">digital \"fingerprint\" of users</a>. In this case, a fingerprint is a profile companies use to track your movements across the web. Your fingerprint may be made up of data like your device's IP address, the device itself, your browser, fonts, plug-ins, as well as its screen resolution. All of these data points come together to build a unique picture of who you are; the more unique your fingerprint, <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/tech/cover-your-tracks-see-whos-following-you-online\" target=\"_blank\">the easier it is to track you</a>, since the odds of someone else with your exact same details is slim. </p><div>\n        <p><img src=\"https://lifehacker.com/images/short-lifehacker-logo.jpg\" alt=\"Lifehacker Logo\" /></p><div>\n            <p><span>You May Also Like</span></p>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n<p>Fingerprinting has a number of applications across the web, but perhaps the largest is for targeted advertising. The reason many of the ads you see are so relevant to your interests and browsing history is because of fingerprinting. Trackers know your internet habits, and can identify and deliver the advertisements you're most likely to click or tap on. Companies can also sell these fingerprinting profiles to brokers and advertisers, making money on both your engagement with ads, as well as your raw data.  </p><p>Advanced Tracking and Fingerprinting Protection simplifies each Safari user's data, so our fingerprints aren't quite so unique. By doing so, it's harder for trackers to identify individuals, and, as such, makes it possible to browser the web more privately. </p><p>This feature was already a thing on iPhone before iOS 26. However, it was limited to Private Browsing by default. If you didn't do all your browsing in a private tab, you likely lost some of these privacy protections, unless you knew to manually change the setting to cover all browsing. The same goes for iPadOS and macOS as well. Most of us probably didn't change the setting, since it's quite buried in each OS' respective settings.</p><div>\n            <p><span>\n                What do you think so far?\n            </span>\n        </p></div>\n<p>Once you update your iPhone, iPad, or Mac to the latest OS, however, your browsing gets these added tracking protections by default. Whether you browse in a private or a normal window, trackers will have a difficult time identifying your device. </p><h2 id=\"how-to-check-your-advanced-tracking-and-fingerprinting-protection-settings\">How to check your Advanced Tracking and Fingerprinting Protection settings </h2><p>This setting should be enabled by default when you update your device. But if you want to make sure it's on, here's where to find it. On your iPhone or iPad, open <strong>Settings</strong>, then head to <strong>Apps > Safari > Advanced</strong>. On your Mac, open Safari, press Command + , to pull up Safari's settings, then choose the <strong>Advanced</strong> tab.</p><p>From here, ensure Advanced Tracking and Fingerprinting Protection is set to \"All Browsing\" (iOS/iPadOS) or \"in all browsing\" (macOS).</p>\n            </article>\n    </div>\n<div>\n    <div>\n        <p><span>The Download Newsletter</span>\n            <span>Never miss a tech story</span>\n        </p>\n        <p><img src=\"https://lifehacker.com/images/team/Jake.png\" alt=\"Jake Peterson portrait\" />\n            <span>Jake Peterson\n            </span>\n            <span>Senior tech editor</span>\n        </p>\n        <p><span>Get the latest tech news, <span></span>reviews, <span></span>and advice from Jake and the team.</span>\n    </p></div>\n    <div>\n        <p><span>The Download Newsletter</span>\n            <span><span>Never miss a tech story.</span> Get the latest tech news, <span></span>reviews, <span></span>and advice from Jake and the team.</span>\n        </p>\n    </div>\n</div>\n    </div>\n            <div>\n                <p><span>\n                        Keep Scrolling for Next Article\n                    </span>\n                </p>\n            </div>\n        </div>"

To that point, with <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/tech/the-best-five-ios-26-features\" target=\"_blank\">iOS 26</a>, both the iPhone and the iPad get a new app that was a Mac exclusive for over 20 years: Preview. </p><h2 id=\"what-can-you-do-with-the-preview-app\">What can you do with the Preview app?</h2><p>Like on macOS, the Preview app for iOS and iPadOS is largely made for viewing PDFs and other documents. When you first open the app, you'll see the options to either create a new document or scan one with your iPhone's camera. </p><p>Most of the time, however, you probably you have an existing document you want to open using Preview. If so, you'll find those options in the bottom half of this starting page. This is Preview's integration with the Files app: You can browse your documents from Files and open any with Preview.</p><div>\n        <p><img src=\"https://lifehacker.com/images/short-lifehacker-logo.jpg\" alt=\"Lifehacker Logo\" /></p><div>\n            <p><span>You May Also Like</span></p>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n<p>Once you have a document loaded up, you're able to view, annotate, markup, and edit it. If you need to fill out a document with your information, you can use AutoFill to automatically enter contact info and other saved details. You can add your signature, and if you're on your iPad, you can use your Apple Pencil to draw on the document. Otherwise, you can use your finger to mark up the file. </p><p>You can also export documents from the Preview app. You can work with file types including HEIDC, JPEG, PDF, PNG, and TIFF. And as with Preview on macOS, there are a number of controls when exporting, such as resolution, embedding text, and saving images as JPEG.</p><p>While there's a lot you can do here, the biggest strength I see for this mobile Preview app is using it as a tool for legal documents. If you need to sign an important document, you can quickly scan it into the app, add your signature, fill out any informationâperhaps automatically with AutoFillâthen email the doc out, all without needing to jump to your computer.</p><h2 id=\"preview-on-ios-is-still-a-work-in-progress\">Preview on iOS is still a work in progress</h2><p>If you look at <a href=\"https://apps.apple.com/us/app/preview/id536344167?platform=iphone\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"open in a new window\">Preview's App Store page</a>, you'll notice some mixed reviews. After using the app for a bit, I understand why. Preview for iOS is definitely still a work in progress and in need of some key upgrades.</p><div>\n            <p><span>\n                What do you think so far?\n            </span>\n        </p></div>\n<p>The biggest quirks I noticed immediately: The main menu page is cluttered, with the Files integration looking more like a glitch than a dedicated window. Speaking of Files, Apple made the decision to have documents in Files open in Preview. At first, that sounds like a good idea, until you experience it in person on both iOS and iPadOS. Being dragged out of the Files app when you're not expecting it is jarring, especially when you're used to viewing your docs directly in the app. </p><p>The workaround here is to avoid Files for opening, well, files. Use the Files integration within Preview, so you stay in the same app. How intuitive. You could also choose to delete the Preview app, but that's a bit of a shame when it's such a major update for iOS and iPadOS 26.</p><p>Also, when you choose the Markup option, there's no clear way to exit without closing the whole app first. As far as I can tell, the only way to do so is to tap the three-dots in the top right, then tap Markup to exit this menu. The Markup button should really stay on screen as it does on macOS, so it's obvious how to dismiss it.    </p>\n            </article>\n    </div>\n<div>\n    <div>\n        <p><span>The Download Newsletter</span>\n            <span>Never miss a tech story</span>\n        </p>\n        <p><img src=\"https://lifehacker.com/images/team/Jake.png\" alt=\"Jake Peterson portrait\" />\n            <span>Jake Peterson\n            </span>\n            <span>Senior tech editor</span>\n        </p>\n        <p><span>Get the latest tech news, <span></span>reviews, <span></span>and advice from Jake and the team.</span>\n    </p></div>\n    <div>\n        <p><span>The Download Newsletter</span>\n            <span><span>Never miss a tech story.</span> Get the latest tech news, <span></span>reviews, <span></span>and advice from Jake and the team.</span>\n        </p>\n    </div>\n</div>\n    </div>\n            <div>\n                <p><span>\n                        Keep Scrolling for Next Article\n                    </span>\n                </p>\n            </div>\n        </div>"

In heels. Christian Roberto LÃ³pez RodrÃ­guez <a href=\"https://www.guinnessworldrecords.com/news/2025/9/serial-speedster-claims-another-running-record-with-backwards-sprint-in-high-heels\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"open in a new window\">claimed the fastest</a> 100m backwards<em> in high heels</em> with an impressive time of 16.55 seconds.</p><p>I may not be setting that sort of record, but I do see running backwards crop up <a href=\"https://www.therunningweek.com/post/should-you-start-running-backwards-heres-what-science-says\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"open in a new window\">time</a> and <a href=\"https://marathonhandbook.com/retro-running-backwards/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"open in a new window\">time again</a> as a trendy idea for the average runner. Sometimes called \"reverse running,\" it's exactly what it sounds like: runners literally turning around and jogging backwards. But does running backwards genuinely help improve forward running performance, or is it simply another fitness fad destined to fade?</p><div>\n        <p><img src=\"https://lifehacker.com/images/short-lifehacker-logo.jpg\" alt=\"Lifehacker Logo\" /></p><div>\n            <p><span>You May Also Like</span></p>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n<h2 id=\"does-running-backwards-actually-help\">Does running backwards actually help?</h2><p>From a physiological perspective, backwards running fundamentally alters how your body moves and which muscles bear the workload. Physiotherapist <a href=\"https://www.saunny.com/pages/about-us\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"open in a new window\">Alex Lee</a> explains the dramatic shift that occurs when you reverse direction: \"Your quadriceps do the majority of the job of slowing your body down. Your hamstrings work differently too because they aren't pushing you forwards. This variation alleviates stress from the knee joint, specifically the ACL.\" He further explains how running backwards also causes your ankles to \"move with greater dorsiflexion,\" which trains balance and body awareness, known as <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/you-can-actually-do-something-about-how-clumsy-you-are-1848970465\" target=\"_blank\">proprioception</a>.</p><p>As any runner can attest, going easy on the knees is a major draw. Lee notes additional advantages when he trains athletes, explaining how he incorporates running backwards to \"shield their knees, develop leg strength, and enhance coordination.\" </p><h2 id=\"supplemental-not-essential\">Supplemental, not essential</h2><p>While the biomechanical benefits are real, running coach <a href=\"https://www.runbaldwin.com/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"open in a new window\">Will Baldwin</a> offers a more measured approach to backwards running's place in training programs. \"I think the biggest benefit from running backwards is it helps you engage some of your posterior chain and muscles that aren't typically recruited in forward running, like your glutes, some hamstring, and it helps with your pushback a little bit,\" Baldwin explains.</p><p>However, he's quick to temper expectations about performance gains: \"I don't think it makes runners faster. It's probably a good supplemental tool. I don't even think it's a necessity in training, but it definitely can wake some muscles up and can be a fun, different type of coordination skill to work on that's still similar to running.\"</p><p>Baldwin's perspective highlights a crucial consideration in training philosophyâthe principle of <em>specificity</em>. \"The law of specificity applies here. If we want to get better at a skill, we need to practice that skill in the specific way we want to compete. We've got to be careful with how much time we waste, especially for busy people. That could be time better spent doing core work or some specific strength training.\"</p><p>For most recreational runners juggling work, family, and training, Baldwin suggests backwards running falls into the \"nice to have\" rather than \"must have\" category: \"You'd really have to be someone with a lot of extra time to experiment and play around with things like this.\"</p><h2 id=\"getting-started-safely\">Getting started safely</h2><p>Running backwards is awkward at best, and genuinely risky at worst. You could fall, and it's easy to twist an ankle or pull something because you can't see where you're landing. If you'd like to experiment with backwards running, start conservatively. Baldwin suggests beginning with walking: \"If someone wanted to try it, I'd start with <em>walking</em> backwards. Especially uphill, on a treadmill or outside, it can really engage, work, and stretch certain muscles. It can be a fun skill to play with, but I'd definitely start with walking before running backwards.\"</p><div>\n            <p><span>\n                What do you think so far?\n            </span>\n        </p></div>\n<p>This gradual approach allows your body to adapt to the different movement patterns while minimizing injury risk. Treadmills provide an ideal controlled environment for initial backwards movement practice, eliminating the hazard of unseen obstacles.</p><p>The bigger concerns, according to Baldwin, relate to training efficiency: \"Wasted time and lack of specificity are probably the bigger ones, but again, not major.\" For time-strapped runners, the opportunity cost of backwards running sessions might outweigh the supplemental benefits.</p><h2 id=\"the-bottom-line\">The bottom line</h2><p>Backwards running offers legitimate benefitsâimproved proprioception, reduced knee stress, enhanced muscle activation patterns, and increased coordination. </p><p>However, for the average recreational runner seeking to improve their forward running times, backwards running is more of a fun bonus activity, rather than a true game-changer. The time investment might be better allocated to proven <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/health/how-to-do-fartlek-runs\" target=\"_blank\">training methods</a> like tempo runs, interval training, strength work, or simply building up more forward-running mileage.</p><p>Backwards running sits comfortably in the category of \"helpful but not essential\" training methods. It's not the revolutionary breakthrough <a href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/@prolongevityfitness/video/6857672364050713861\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"open in a new window\">some social media posts</a> might suggest, but it's also not entirely without merit. Like many <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/health/is-exercising-on-all-fours-really-better\" target=\"_blank\">fitness trends</a>, the truth lies somewhere between.</p><p>So, for runners with specific needsâsuch as rehabilitation from knee injuries, athletes requiring enhanced proprioception, or those simply seeking variety in their training routineâbackwards running can serve a valuable purpose. For everyone else, it remains an interesting option worth considering if time and safety conditions permit, but not a priority that should displace more fundamental aspects of training.</p>\n            </article>\n    </div>\n<div>\n    <div>\n        <p><span>The Daily Newsletter</span>\n            <span>Ready to do everything better?</span>\n        </p>\n        <p><img src=\"https://lifehacker.com/images/team/Jordan.png\" alt=\"Jordan Calhoun portrait\" />\n            <span>Jordan Calhoun\n            </span>\n            <span>Editor in chief</span>\n        </p>\n        <p><span><span>Get daily tips, tricks, <span>and tech guides</span></span> <span>from Jordan and the team.</span></span>\n    </p></div>\n    <div>\n        <p><span>The Daily Newsletter</span>\n            <span><span>Ready to do everything better?</span> <span>Get daily tips, tricks, <span>and tech guides</span></span> <span>from Jordan and the team.</span></span>\n        </p>\n    </div>\n</div>\n    </div>\n            <div>\n                <p><span>\n                        Keep Scrolling for Next Article\n                    </span>\n                </p>\n            </div>\n        </div>\n    </div>"

/><p>Studying can be as easy as sitting down and reading a chapter, but it shouldn't be. I do hate to break that to you, though I'm actually doing you a favor. Just absorbing huge blocks of content isn't necessarily helpful for remembering any of it. Before you do the work of studying, you have to get organized by sorting the content you need to absorb. Even organizing it, especially using the \"chunking\" method, will help you start to grasp and retain the materials, so by the time you're going through them, you'll be in a perfect position to lodge all that information in your memory. Chunking is a psychological trick that experts swear by. Here's how to master it for yourself.</p><h2 id=\"what-is-chunking\">What is chunking?</h2><p><a href=\"https://dictionary.apa.org/chunking\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"open in a new window\">Hereâs what the American Psychological Association says</a>: Chunking is âthe process by which the mind divides large pieces of information into smaller units (chunks) that are easier to retain in short-term memory. As a result of this recoding, one item in memory (e.g., a keyword or key idea) can stand for multiple other items (e.g., a short list of associated points).â</p><div>\n        <p><img src=\"https://lifehacker.com/images/short-lifehacker-logo.jpg\" alt=\"Lifehacker Logo\" /></p><div>\n            <p><span>You May Also Like</span></p>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n<p>Basically, your short-term memory has a specific capacity for how many units it can store and that capacity is pretty low, ranging from five to nineâbut the units themselves can be as complex as you want. The APA says âthe exact number of chunks remembered depends on the size of each chunk or the subunits contained within each chunk.â</p><p>Each chunk is a collection of pieces of related information, like words, numbers, or phrases. The key here is they have to be related to each other, but <em>not</em> very related to the other chunks. Chunking is all about grouping related pieces of information so you can stay in that five-to-nine units frame.</p><p>You probably already use chunking in your real life to remember things. Think of your phone number. You likely already sort it into your area code, those first three digits, and the final four digits. Remembering a string of 10 numbers is hard; remembering three âchunksâ of smaller digits is less difficult.</p><h2 id=\"so-how-do-you-study-in-chunks\">So how do you study in chunks?</h2><p>Look at the things you have to memorize and start grouping them loosely into categories based on how theyâre related. This doesnât have to be about <em>content</em>, either. If you have to memorize 20 words or concepts, you donât have to group them by their meaning; you can group them by whether they sound similar, start with the same letter, or whatever you want. If you've ever <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/the-best-ways-to-use-association-to-remember-what-you-1850861942\" target=\"_blank\">used a mnemonic device</a> to remember something like, say, the order of the planets, you've already made a \"chunk\" to study before. </p><div>\n            <p><span>\n                What do you think so far?\n            </span>\n        </p></div>\n<p>You can create your chunks with something as simple as a pencil and paper, listing the words or concepts together and skipping a few spaces between units. From here, you can make flashcard sets of each chunk or use the first letter of each phrase to create a mnemonic device. Try an acrostic, a phrase where the first letter of each word corresponds with the first letter of one of the things you need to remember. If you think better in terms of numbers, try grouping your words or concepts by how many letters are in them. </p><p>The pencil-and-paper technique is helpful for entrenching words in your memory, since <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/dont-use-laptop-to-take-notes-in-class\" target=\"_blank\">you retain things you write down</a> a little better than those you type, but it's not that convenient or functional otherwise. I recommend using apps and digital programs to make this easier. For instance, use a mind-mapping app to sort out your chunks and make them easy to visualize. I always find that even seeing words grouped together and organized can help me remember them and the ways they relate to each other better. <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/tech/xmind-mind-mapping-app-review\" target=\"_blank\">Xmind is my favorite app for this</a>, but you can also use something like Canva, which I have absolutely done in a pinch. Next, you can even use an app to create your flashcards. <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/leitner-system-flashcard-studying\" target=\"_blank\">Flashcards are one of the best</a> and most time-tested methods for studying, but it's wildly unrealistic for you to carry a bunch of notecards around. <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/tech/best-flashcard-apps-for-studying\" target=\"_blank\">These are my five favorite flashcard apps</a>, which will enable you to keep all your study materials accessible on your phone wherever you are. </p><p>I recommend making a new deck for every chunk you create so you can keep your groups separate in your mind. Once you've grasped all the content of your various chunks, try mixing some of the decks together and reviewing them in bigger batches. <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/why-you-should-actually-study-multiple-topics-at-the-sa-1850438252\" target=\"_blank\">Known as interleaving</a>, this technique will gradually help you make connections between different concepts, enhancing not only your recall of them, but your actual understanding. </p><p>Just don't forget to start out by studying each setâor chunkâindividually. Even though this doesnât break down the amount of content, having them in groups with similar characteristics will help you remember it all together, and youâll be surprised how much of the real material you retain. </p>\n            </article>\n    </div>\n<div>\n    <div>\n        <p><span>The Daily Newsletter</span>\n            <span>Ready to do everything better?</span>\n        </p>\n        <p><img src=\"https://lifehacker.com/images/team/Jordan.png\" alt=\"Jordan Calhoun portrait\" />\n            <span>Jordan Calhoun\n            </span>\n            <span>Editor in chief</span>\n        </p>\n        <p><span><span>Get daily tips, tricks, <span>and tech guides</span></span> <span>from Jordan and the team.</span></span>\n    </p></div>\n    <div>\n        <p><span>The Daily Newsletter</span>\n            <span><span>Ready to do everything better?</span> <span>Get daily tips, tricks, <span>and tech guides</span></span> <span>from Jordan and the team.</span></span>\n        </p>\n    </div>\n</div>\n    </div>\n            <div>\n                <p><span>\n                        Keep Scrolling for Next Article\n                    </span>\n                </p>\n            </div>\n        </div>\n    </div>"

If you haven't installed iOS 26, yet, however, think twice before you do, because you're going to be stuck with it: Apple has made it impossible to downgrade and return to iOS 18.</p><h2 id=\"you-cant-go-back-to-ios-18\">You can't go back to iOS 18</h2><p><a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/09/22/apple-stops-signing-ios-18-6-2/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"open in a new window\">As reported by MacRumors</a>, Apple stopped \"signing\" iOS 18.6.2 on Monday. When Apple signs a particular piece of software, it means you can download that software to your compatible device. Apple stops signing software shortly after it releases a new version. It's a system meant to block users from installing old software versions on their Apple devices, intended to protect those users from insecurities in operating systems that haven't been patched.</p><div>\n        <p><img src=\"https://lifehacker.com/images/short-lifehacker-logo.jpg\" alt=\"Lifehacker Logo\" /></p><div>\n            <p><span>You May Also Like</span></p>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n<p>As such, now that iOS 18.6.2 is no longer being signed, there is no way to downgrade to that software version from iOS 26 if you change your mind. Though the process was tedious, previously, <a href=\"https://x.com/badboychadhoy/status/1970549101973418116\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"open in a new window\">you could downgrade from iOS 26</a> by putting your iPhone in recovery mode, erasing it completely, and installing a new version of 18.6.2. Now that Apple has stopped signing 18.6.2, however, there's no way to install it, so a factory reset will only leave you with an iPhone running iOS 26, and none of your data.</p><div>\n            <p><span>\n                What do you think so far?\n            </span>\n        </p></div>\n<p>You might be wondering why you can't downgrade to iOS 18.7, since that's a newer version of iOS 18 than 18.6.2. <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-stops-signing-ios-18-6-2-ios-26-downgrades-now-impossible.2467148/post-34169189\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"open in a new window\">As users on the MacRumors forum point out</a>, you need an IPSW file in order to downgrade your iPhone, but Apple hasn't provided an IPSW file with iOS 18.7, as that update is only available over the air for uses already running iOS 18. That is to say: Unless your iPhone is already running 18.6.2, you can't install iOS 18.7.  </p><p>If you haven't updated your iPhone yet, you have two options. First, there's nothing<em> forcing </em>you to install iOS 26 on your device. You can keep running iOS 18.6.2 or iOS 18.7 as long as you want, and take advantage of any future security updates Apple provides to keep your iPhone protected. Alternately, you can go ahead and install iOS 26, with the understanding that you won't have the option to undo itâ<a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/tech/how-to-undo-iphone-ios-26-liquid-glass\" target=\"_blank\">though you will be able to undo many of the UI changes</a>, at least. And if your main concern is performance and <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/tech/extend-iphone-air-battery-life\" target=\"_blank\">battery life</a>, it might be smart to wait for iOS 26.1, which is currently in beta testing. </p>\n            </article>\n    </div>\n<div>\n    <div>\n        <p><span>The Download Newsletter</span>\n            <span>Never miss a tech story</span>\n        </p>\n        <p><img src=\"https://lifehacker.com/images/team/Jake.png\" alt=\"Jake Peterson portrait\" />\n            <span>Jake Peterson\n            </span>\n            <span>Senior tech editor</span>\n        </p>\n        <p><span>Get the latest tech news, <span></span>reviews, <span></span>and advice from Jake and the team.</span>\n    </p></div>\n    <div>\n        <p><span>The Download Newsletter</span>\n            <span><span>Never miss a tech story.</span> Get the latest tech news, <span></span>reviews, <span></span>and advice from Jake and the team.</span>\n        </p>\n    </div>\n</div>\n    </div>\n            <div>\n                <p><span>\n                        Keep Scrolling for Next Article\n                    </span>\n                </p>\n            </div>\n        </div>"

Then President-elect Trump had already assured TikTok that his incoming administration would not enforce the ban, as did the outgoing President Biden. As such, once Trump was sworn in, he signed an executive order kicking the TikTok ban down the road. Trump continued to delay enforcing the ban, which, <a href=\"https://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/columnist/2025/06/25/trump-tiktok-ban-delay-extended/84323075007/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"open in a new window\">while legally dubious</a>, allowed the app to continue operating as usual. </p><div>\n        <p><img src=\"https://lifehacker.com/images/short-lifehacker-logo.jpg\" alt=\"Lifehacker Logo\" /></p><div>\n            <p><span>You May Also Like</span></p>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n<p>It seems, however, this wild ride is coming to a close. On Thursday, Trump <a href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/09/saving-tiktok-while-protecting-national-security/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"open in a new window\">signed an executive order</a> that sets the stage for a U.S.-majority stake in TikTok. <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2025/09/25/trump-approves-tiktok-deal-through-executive-order.html\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"open in a new window\">Nothing is set in stone</a>, but American companies like Oracle, as well as individuals like Larry Ellison (Oracle co-founder) and Rupert Murdoch could be among the newest owners of the app. Curiously, a non-American company, the Abu Dhabi-based MGX investment fund, would also be involved. This joint venture would control a majority of the new American TikTok, while ByteDance would control less than 20%. </p><p>Trump says Chinese President Xi Jinping has okayed the deal, though no Chinese representatives were present at the order's signing. Again, nothing is for certain at this point, but we can take a look at the early details to get a sense for how a new \"America-approved\" TikTok would operate in the U.S.</p><h2 id=\"how-would-tiktok-change-in-the-us\">How would TikTok change in the US?</h2><p>First things first: the app itself. It's highly possible you'll need to download a new app entirely in order to keep using TikTok. This has been <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/tech/how-tiktoks-new-app-may-affect-you\" target=\"_blank\">a focus of speculation for a couple months now</a>, but <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2025/09/25/tiktok-deal-sale-algorithm-changes/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"open in a new window\">as the Washington Post reports</a>, TikTok engineers have been working on a U.S.-version of the app. The new app will likely appear identical to the TikTok experience you already know, and, in fact, might be accessible via a link within the current app. The Post makes the point that the harder it is for users to access the new TikTok app, the higher the chance they leave the platform entirely for alternatives like Instagram and YouTube, so TikTok engineers will no doubt be working on ways to make the transition as seamless as possible. </p><p>Then, there's the famous algorithm. This is what makes TikTok so addictive; the app's algorithm is so good, it learns what you like and shows you content to keep you scrolling for hours. Without the algorithm, TikTok very well could lose its addictive nature, and, along with it, its users. The Post reports that, at least at this time, the algorithm is staying put, and will be leased out from ByteDance by the new American TikTok venture. Plus, you should still be able to see international content going forward, not just videos posted by Americans. TikTok should, in theory, be as entertaining (and addicting) as ever. </p><div>\n            <p><span>\n                What do you think so far?\n            </span>\n        </p></div>\n<p>But that's not the end of the story. According to Trump's executive order, the algorithm will be \"retrained and monitored\" by \"trusted security partners\" of the U.S. That does not necessarily inspire confidence in a neutral algorithm for Americans, <a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/tech-news/trump-signs-executive-order-tiktok-deal-know-rcna233518\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"open in a new window\">especially as Trump says he would make it \"100% MAGA\" if he could</a>. </p><p>Finally, there's the question of user data. This was a major concern of the U.S. government, and part of why both the Trump and Biden administrations went after the app. <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/tech/tiktok-isnt-banned-yet#how-did-we-get-here\" target=\"_blank\">It wasn't without reason either</a>, as we learned ByteDance did in fact store American user data and had used it to obtain the IP addresses of American journalists. According to the executive order, all user data from the U.S. version of TikTok will need to be stored in a cloud environment operated by an American company.</p><p>We'll need to see how both ByteDance and the Chinese government address the executive order and potential divestiture going forward, as things could change. As of now, however, it seems both nothing will change, and everything will change. You'll still be able to endlessly scroll through your feed as you do now, but you may need to use a new, yet identical version of the app to do so. You may see the same content you do now, or you might start to see some new content, suspiciously aligned with the values of the current administration. And your data will still be controlled by a faceless third-party, only now it'll be by your own country, rather than a foreign nation.</p>\n            </article>\n    </div>\n<div>\n    <div>\n        <p><span>The Download Newsletter</span>\n            <span>Never miss a tech story</span>\n        </p>\n        <p><img src=\"https://lifehacker.com/images/team/Jake.png\" alt=\"Jake Peterson portrait\" />\n            <span>Jake Peterson\n            </span>\n            <span>Senior tech editor</span>\n        </p>\n        <p><span>Get the latest tech news, <span></span>reviews, <span></span>and advice from Jake and the team.</span>\n    </p></div>\n    <div>\n        <p><span>The Download Newsletter</span>\n            <span><span>Never miss a tech story.</span> Get the latest tech news, <span></span>reviews, <span></span>and advice from Jake and the team.</span>\n        </p>\n    </div>\n</div>\n    </div>\n            <div>\n                <p><span>\n                        Keep Scrolling for Next Article\n                    </span>\n                </p>\n            </div>\n        </div>"
