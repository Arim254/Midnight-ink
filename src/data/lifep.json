finally answered my biggest (yet perhaps pettiest) complaint about its iconic smart ring—it’s now getting a battery-powered charging case so you can top up the battery when you’re away from your home. There are also new ring colors available, and finally, multi-ring support so you can switch between rings.</p><p>In addition, Oura has <a href=\"https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20251001647209/en/URA-Debuts-Groundbreaking-Oura-Ring-4-Ceramic-in-Striking-New-Colors\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"open in a new window\"><u>announced</u></a> Health Panels, a feature that lets you book a blood draw at a Quest lab and view your results in the Oura app. Whoop <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/health/whoop-new-blood-testing-feature\" target=\"_blank\"><u>recently announced a similar feature</u></a>, and Ultrahuman launched its <a href=\"https://zdcs.link/aBDqx8?pageview_type=Standard&template=News&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=Blood%20Vision&short_url=aBDqx8&u=https%3A%2F%2Flifehacker.com%2Fhealth%2Foura-ring-new-charging-case&event_label=Blood%20Vision\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"open in a new window\"><u>Blood Vision</u></a> earlier this year. </p><h2 id=\"why-im-excited-for-the-charging-case\">Why I’m excited for the charging case</h2><p>In <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/health/what-ive-learned-from-four-years-of-tracking-my-health-with-the-oura-ring\" target=\"_blank\"><u>all the time that I’ve been using Oura rings</u></a>—since generation 2—the charger has worked the same way: You have a little circular stand that lives on your nightstand, and you set the ring on top of it, fitting it around a little cylinder shape that sticks up from the base. I’ve never loved this format; it’s too easy to send the ring flying if you catch your foot on the cord in the dark. It’s also not the most convenient for travel. </p><div>\n        <p><img src=\"https://lifehacker.com/images/short-lifehacker-logo.jpg\" alt=\"Lifehacker Logo\" /></p><div>\n            <p><span>You May Also Like</span></p>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n<p>Now, however, the Oura ring has a charging <em>case</em>. The case holds about five charges’ worth of battery, so you can top up the charge on your ring by popping it into the case, then closing the case and sticking it in your pocket. Or gym bag. (Weightlifting workouts are my favorite time to charge the ring.) Traveling with the charger is now simple, and you don’t have to worry about losing the ring if the charger gets knocked over. </p><p>Now for the bad news: This puppy is $99, and it’s a separate add-on; you can’t get it in place of the nightstand charger when buying a new ring.</p><p>Like the nightstand chargers, it’s specific to the size of your ring. For example, you need a size 8 charger for a size 8 ring. The new charging case doesn’t seem to be available on Oura’s website yet, but it should be coming soon. (If you can’t wait, or want to save a few bucks, I found this <a href=\"https://zdcs.link/Qp4lEo?pageview_type=Standard&template=News&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=third-party%20case%20that%20holds%20your%20nightstand%20charger&short_url=Qp4lEo&u=https%3A%2F%2Flifehacker.com%2Fhealth%2Foura-ring-new-charging-case&event_label=third-party%20case%20that%20holds%20your%20nightstand%20charger\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"open in a new window\"><u>third-party case that holds your nightstand charger</u></a>—either generation 3 or 4. It's not as sleek as the official one, though.) </p><div>\n            <p><span>\n                What do you think so far?\n            </span>\n        </p></div>\n<h2 id=\"you-can-now-swap-between-rings\">You can now swap between rings</h2><p>Today Oura announced a <a href=\"https://zdcs.link/aRMGe7?pageview_type=Standard&template=News&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=new%20collection%20of%20ceramic%20rings&short_url=aRMGe7&u=https%3A%2F%2Flifehacker.com%2Fhealth%2Foura-ring-new-charging-case&event_label=new%20collection%20of%20ceramic%20rings\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"open in a new window\"><u>new collection of ceramic rings</u></a> in four different colors: white, navy, pastel green, and pink. The new rings have the same internals as the metallic Ring 4, so this isn’t a new generation of ring, just a new appearance. (Oura also notes that the ceramic rings should be more resistant to scratches, and each one comes with a polishing pad to keep its shine.) All colors are $499, the same price as the <a href=\"https://zdcs.link/QWERb7?pageview_type=Standard&template=News&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=gold%20and%20rose%20gold%20finishes&short_url=QWERb7&u=https%3A%2F%2Flifehacker.com%2Fhealth%2Foura-ring-new-charging-case&event_label=gold%20and%20rose%20gold%20finishes\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"open in a new window\"><u>gold and rose gold finishes</u></a> of the regular Ring 4.</p><p>With so many color options, Oura seems to hope existing members will splurge on a second ring. The company is rolling out multi-ring support for the app, another feature I'm surprised they didn’t have before. (When I’ve tested the <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/health/which-is-better-oura-4-vs-oura-3\" target=\"_blank\">gen 3 and 4 rings to compare</a>, I've had to completely reset my ring to switch over, or else use two different accounts.) Oura says you’ll need to select in the app which one you’re wearing, so it’s not quite as seamless as the way Garmin or Apple handles multiple devices. (Garmin has me choose a “priority device” and then I can switch at will; Apple just sets you free to swap as you like, and it does its best). </p><p>If you are done with your old ring after upgrading, Oura now has a <a href=\"https://support.ouraring.com/hc/en-us/articles/44414370533139-Device-Recycling-Program\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"open in a new window\"><u>ring recycling service</u></a> that gives you a shipping label to send back your old ring. Any Oura ring can be recycled through this program, including old or broken ones. (You should factory-reset the ring first.) Rings you recycle won’t be eligible for returns or refunds.</p>\n            </article>\n    </div>\n<div>\n    <div>\n        <p><span>The Daily Newsletter</span>\n            <span>Ready to do everything better?</span>\n        </p>\n        <p><img src=\"https://lifehacker.com/images/team/Jordan.png\" alt=\"Jordan Calhoun portrait\" />\n            <span>Jordan Calhoun\n            </span>\n            <span>Editor in chief</span>\n        </p>\n        <p><span><span>Get daily tips, tricks, <span>and tech guides</span></span> <span>from Jordan and the team.</span></span>\n    </p></div>\n    <div>\n        <p><span>The Daily Newsletter</span>\n            <span><span>Ready to do everything better?</span> <span>Get daily tips, tricks, <span>and tech guides</span></span> <span>from Jordan and the team.</span></span>\n        </p>\n    </div>\n</div>\n    </div>\n            <div>\n                <p><span>\n                        Keep Scrolling for Next Article\n                    </span>\n                </p>\n            </div>\n        </div>\n    </div>"

It's often demanding and tedious work, and while you're taking care of it, you do so with the knowledge that you're going to have to do it all again next week.</p><p>There's some good news, though, for the cleaning-averse: Modern day tech can handle a lot of these jobs on your behalf, as smart cleaning gadgets continue to get better and better. In recent years, they've become more reliable and more effective, and you've got a host of different models to choose from.</p><p>This introduction to smart cleaning technology will bring you up to date on the products that are available, and what they can do for you. Yes, you can have a home that's neater and cleaner—with just a few button presses.</p>\n<h2 id=\"the-pros-and-cons-of-cleaning-tech\">The pros and cons of cleaning tech</h2><p>The big positive from investing in smart cleaning gadgets is, of course, that you won't have to do these jobs yourself, so the hours you save can be put towards doing something you actually enjoy.</p><p>These gadgets don't get tired, sick, or irritable, and will work at any time of the day or night—though you don't necessarily want a robot vacuum humming away at 4 a.m.. In many cases they can be operated remotely and work autonomously, so they can be taking care of the chores while you're out at work or on vacation.</p><div>\n    <p><img src=\"https://lifehacker.com/imagery/articles/01K57198V3E3FABSSYCRSRWCH6/images-1.fill.size_2000x1125.v1757951599.jpg\" alt=\"Ecovacs Winbot W2 Pro Omni\" srcset=\"https://lifehacker.com/imagery/articles/01K57198V3E3FABSSYCRSRWCH6/images-1.fill.size_800x450.v1757951599.jpg 800w, https://lifehacker.com/imagery/articles/01K57198V3E3FABSSYCRSRWCH6/images-1.fill.size_1400x788.v1757951599.jpg 1400w, https://lifehacker.com/imagery/articles/01K57198V3E3FABSSYCRSRWCH6/images-1.fill.size_2000x1125.v1757951599.jpg 2000w\" />\n            </p>\n            <p><span>You can get smart devices to wash your windows for you.</span>\n                                        <span>Credit: Ecovacs</span>\n                    </p>\n    </div>\n<p>You <em>are </em>going to have to make an initial investment in the technology, and, for some devices, a rather sizable one. The argument can be made that hiring someone to do your cleaning is a better option than getting robots to do it: They might do a more thorough job, depending on the person and the gadget you're comparing them to, and you can give them more specific instructions. However, getting cleaners in does involve giving someone else access to your home, and finding a mutually convenient time. It will also be an ongoing expense.</p><p>There are a few more cons to consider. One is that a certain amount of tidying up and preparation work is often required before the robots can take over. You may have to pick up toys and clothes, for example, so the robot vacuum can vacuum. By the time you've done that, you might think it makes more sense to just do the whole job yourself.</p><div>\n    <p><img src=\"https://lifehacker.com/imagery/articles/01K57198V3E3FABSSYCRSRWCH6/images-2.fill.size_2000x1125.v1757951599.jpg\" alt=\"Roomba app\" srcset=\"https://lifehacker.com/imagery/articles/01K57198V3E3FABSSYCRSRWCH6/images-2.fill.size_800x450.v1757951599.jpg 800w, https://lifehacker.com/imagery/articles/01K57198V3E3FABSSYCRSRWCH6/images-2.fill.size_1400x788.v1757951599.jpg 1400w, https://lifehacker.com/imagery/articles/01K57198V3E3FABSSYCRSRWCH6/images-2.fill.size_2000x1125.v1757951599.jpg 2000w\" />\n            </p>\n            <p><span>Many smart devices can be controlled via an app.</span>\n                                        <span>Credit: iRobot</span>\n                    </p>\n    </div>\n<p>What's more, these gadgets require a certain level of maintenance: Depending on the device, you need to empty them out, supply them with power, water, and cleaning products, and perhaps even clean parts of them yourself. Like any piece of hardware, they will experience wear and tear, and will eventually need to be replaced.</p><p>There's one other consideration to think about, which is that manual cleaning is a great way to exercise. <a href=\"https://bmcgeriatr.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12877-023-04039-1\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"open in a new window\">Studies have shown</a> that domestic duties can give you enough of a workout to extend your lifespan and improve a host of different health markers, so you might want to use some of the time that these gadgets are saving you to head out for a run or for a session at the gym.</p><h2 id=\"the-best-smart-cleaning-gadgets-you-can-buy\">The best smart cleaning gadgets you can buy</h2><p>If you've decided that you want to transform your home into one that cleans itself, you can automate a number of different processes using a number of different devices. There's plenty of choice out there, so the usual rules apply: Take your time to research the various options and the features they're offering versus their price, and find as many reviews as you can from people who've used them.</p><h3>Robot vacuums and mops</h3><p>This is the obvious place to start, as these are the gadgets that usually come to mind when you think of smart cleaning tech. You can find single-purpose devices that only vacuum or only mop, or devices that combine both functions.</p><p>While early models had their issues with reliability and cleaning power, the robot vacuums you can buy today are generally more impressive in terms of how clean they can get your carpets and floors. You'll find features like LiDAR and camera-powered mapping and obstacle avoidance, self-emptying capabilities, and auto-adjustments depending on what surface is being cleaned. </p><p>Often, everything these machines do can be organized through a companion app, so you can set the cleaners to work on a specific schedule, as well as set zones or rooms that are off limits.

These pieces of hardware elevate clothes cleaning with a variety of useful and intelligent tricks, including the ability to adjust cleaning and drying cycles to the type and size of load, remote control via mobile apps, and a number of self-maintaining mechanisms.</p><p>A good example is the <a href=\"https://zdcs.link/9YMkVn?pageview_type=Standard&template=Explainers&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=LG%20WM6700HBA&short_url=9YMkVn&u=https%3A%2F%2Flifehacker.com%2Fhome%2Fall-the-smart-gadgets-for-a-self-cleaning-home&event_label=LG%20WM6700HBA\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"open in a new window\">LG WM6700HBA</a>, which will set you back $1,250. There's on-board AI assistance to work out the best cycles for the clothes you're washing, an automatic dispenser for just the right amount of detergent and fabric softener to cut down on waste, and remote operations and monitoring via the LG ThinQ app.</p><h3>Smart dishwashers</h3><p>Finally we have <strong>smart dishwashers</strong>, which use automated technology to give your crockery and cutlery a better clean than standard appliances might. The features are similar to those you'll find on smart washers and dryers: Sensing technology for understanding what's been loaded in and adjusting the cleaning accordingly, remote app control and smart home integration, and as much automated maintenance and self-cleaning as possible.</p><p>Take a look at the <a href=\"https://zdcs.link/98PJqd?pageview_type=Standard&template=Explainers&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=Bosch%20500%20Series&short_url=98PJqd&u=https%3A%2F%2Flifehacker.com%2Fhome%2Fall-the-smart-gadgets-for-a-self-cleaning-home&event_label=Bosch%20500%20Series\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"open in a new window\">Bosch 500 Series</a>, which is priced at $1,250 at the time of writing. It has intelligent sensors to check cleaning progress, an AutoAir feature that automatically pops the dishwasher door open when cleaning is finished to let air circulate, and the option of operating cleaning cycles and other dishwasher features from an app on your phone.</p>\n            </article>\n    <div>\n    <div>\n        <p><span>Smarter Home & Living <span>Newsletter</span></span>\n            <span>Never miss a story</span>\n        </p>\n        <p><img src=\"https://lifehacker.com/images/team/Lindsey.png\" alt=\"Lindsey Ellefson portrait\" />\n            <span>Lindsey Ellefson\n            </span>\n        </p>\n        <p><span><span>Get the latest smart home news, trends,</span> <span>and advice from Lindsey and the team.</span></span>\n    </p></div>\n    <div>\n        <p><span>Smarter Home & Living <span>Newsletter</span></span>\n            <span><span>Never miss a story.</span> <span>Get the latest smart home news, trends,</span> <span>and advice from Lindsey and the team.</span></span>\n        </p>\n    </div>\n</div>\n                        <div>\n                <div>\n            <div>\n                    <p><img src=\"https://lifehacker.com/imagery/authors/01HHFDBG3H1VSXE5XSDZ06W91C/image.fill.size_150x150.v1706808034.jpg\" alt=\"Photo of David Nield\" />\n                                            </p>\n                </div>\n            <div>\n                <p>David Nield</p>\n                                <div>\n                                            <p>David Nield is a technology journalist from Manchester in the U.K. who has been writing about gadgets and apps for more than 20 years. </p>\n                                    </div>\n                <p><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://lifehacker.com/author/david-nield\">Read David's full bio</a>\n                            </p></div>\n        </div>\n                <div>\n                                            <div>\n    <p>More by David</p>\n        <hr />\n        </div>\n                        <div>\n                <p><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://lifehacker.com/home/best-smart-tech-cool-heat-home\">\n                    <img src=\"https://lifehacker.com/imagery/articles/01K59Q1VPXAQSK010BFW6ASQZT/hero-image.fill.size_75x75.v1759157072.jpg\" alt=\"person using smart thermostat\" />\n                </a>\n            </p></div>\n        <hr />\n                    <div>\n                <p><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://lifehacker.com/tech/how-to-watch-pornhub-even-if-its-blocked-in-your-state\">\n                    <img src=\"https://lifehacker.com/imagery/articles/01JWXSQX0KG9KBKARRSGFA13YP/hero-image.fill.size_75x75.v1749051765.jpg\" alt=\"Pornhub goes dark\" />\n                </a>\n            </p></div>\n        <hr />\n                                        </div>\n            </div>\n                                </section>\n                                                </section>\n    </div>"

We'll need to wait for the reviewers to put Gemini and the new Google Home app through their paces, not to mention all of Google's new devices, but until then, we can take a peek at the future Google is selling us on: </p><div>\n        <p><img src=\"https://lifehacker.com/images/short-lifehacker-logo.jpg\" alt=\"Lifehacker Logo\" /></p><div>\n            <p><span>You May Also Like</span></p>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n<h2 id=\"gemini-for-home\">Gemini for Home</h2><div>\n    <p><img src=\"https://lifehacker.com/imagery/articles/01K6G4MS2D5AKWXNXQKK8HZR1W/images-1.fill.size_2000x1128.v1759334369.webp\" alt=\"screenshots of gemini for home\" srcset=\"https://lifehacker.com/imagery/articles/01K6G4MS2D5AKWXNXQKK8HZR1W/images-1.fill.size_800x451.v1759334369.webp 800w, https://lifehacker.com/imagery/articles/01K6G4MS2D5AKWXNXQKK8HZR1W/images-1.fill.size_1400x790.v1759334369.webp 1400w, https://lifehacker.com/imagery/articles/01K6G4MS2D5AKWXNXQKK8HZR1W/images-1.fill.size_2000x1128.v1759334369.webp 2000w\" />\n            </p>\n            <p><span></span>\n                                        <span>Credit: Google</span>\n                    </p>\n    </div>\n<p>Google Assistant is nothing new, but even Google seems to think there's been room for improvement. The company says the experience was \"functional, not intuitive or natural,\" which seems to be informing Google's newest smart home assistant: Gemini for Home.</p><p>As you might expect, Gemini is replacing Google Assistant across all Google smart home products. The company's argument here is that the new experience is much more natural than before: Previously, you might have needed to ensure your commands were succinct and to the point for the assistant to understand them. Going forward, Google says you can take advantage of the AI's contextual awareness for more casual requests. </p><p>If you're asking for help fixing your dishwasher, for example, you don't need to preface each request with the problem at hand. You can begin with a question like \"Hey Google, my dishwasher is having trouble draining. Where should I start?\" If it suggests you check the filter, you don't need to say \"Hey Google, I'm trying to get my dishwasher to drain, but the filter seems fine. What's the next step?\" Instead, you can simply follow up with \"Hey Google, the filter seems fine. What's next?\" Google says Gemini will understand the context, and continue to help. </p><p>If you want to bypass the the constant \"Hey Googles,\" you can say \"Hey Google, let's chat.\" This kicks on Gemini Live, the AI's voice mode, which let's you have a back and forth with Gemini. </p><p>The company says you can do the same when asking questions about things like songs and movies. If you want to look up a song from a movie, but you don't remember the name of either, you can share vague details about the movie and Gemini supposedly can put the pieces together.    </p><p>Perhaps most importantly for the smart home itself, Google says Gemini can handle more complex requests. For example, you can ask it to turn off all lights except for a specific room, or trust that the AI will understand the context of the room you're asking about, e.g., \"Can you turn on the lights by the oven\" will mean turning on the lights in the kitchen. My favorite of Google's promised features, however, is that you can ask Gemini to add items to your grocery lists from recipes, rather than individual items. You can simply request a shopping list for Pad Thai, and, according to Google, Gemini will add all the ingredients necessary to your shopping list.</p><h2 id=\"gemini-with-smart-cameras\">Gemini with smart cameras</h2><div>\n    <p><img src=\"https://lifehacker.com/imagery/articles/01K6G4MS2D5AKWXNXQKK8HZR1W/images-2.fill.size_2000x1085.v1759334447.png\" alt=\"google smart cameras\" srcset=\"https://lifehacker.com/imagery/articles/01K6G4MS2D5AKWXNXQKK8HZR1W/images-2.fill.size_800x434.v1759334447.png 800w, https://lifehacker.com/imagery/articles/01K6G4MS2D5AKWXNXQKK8HZR1W/images-2.fill.size_1400x759.v1759334447.png 1400w, https://lifehacker.com/imagery/articles/01K6G4MS2D5AKWXNXQKK8HZR1W/images-2.fill.size_2000x1085.v1759334447.png 2000w\" />\n            </p>\n            <p><span></span>\n                                        <span>Credit: Google</span>\n                    </p>\n    </div>\n<p>Google says Gemini for Home can also upgrade smart cameras connected to Google Home. The company argues that most smart camera alerts are \"low context,\" pinging you with things like \"motion detected\" or \"person detected,\" but leaving the rest on you to figure out what's really going on. </p><p>With Gemini for Home, Google says it is using AI to make your smart camera experience more contextual. Alerts will offer a \"full narrative of what's happening,\" so you can learn from the notification itself whether you have a USPS delivery, or simply a shadow moving in front of the camera. Gemini will also  organize and summarize all of the day's video clips—you can choose whether to review all the videos taken, or simply scan the summary for any updates the AI thought important. Google says you can ask Gemini questions about your clips, as well. </p><div>\n            <p><span>\n                What do you think so far?\n            </span>\n        </p></div>\n<p>Speaking of which, you can ask Gemini to find specific video clips using natural language. Google says you can ask questions like \"When did the kids get home,\" or \"Did I leave the car door open today?\"</p><h2 id=\"the-new-google-home-app\">The new Google Home app</h2><div>\n    <p><img src=\"https://lifehacker.com/imagery/articles/01K6G4MS2D5AKWXNXQKK8HZR1W/images-3.fill.size_2000x1085.v1759334506.png\" alt=\"google home app\" srcset=\"https://lifehacker.com/imagery/articles/01K6G4MS2D5AKWXNXQKK8HZR1W/images-3.fill.size_800x434.v1759334506.png 800w, https://lifehacker.com/imagery/articles/01K6G4MS2D5AKWXNXQKK8HZR1W/images-3.fill.size_1400x759.v1759334506.png 1400w, https://lifehacker.com/imagery/articles/01K6G4MS2D5AKWXNXQKK8HZR1W/images-3.fill.size_2000x1085.v1759334506.png 2000w\" />\n            </p>\n            <p><span></span>\n                                        <span>Credit: Google</span>\n                    </p>\n    </div>\n<p>Tying all these updates together is the overhauled Google Home app, which reportedly has over 100 new features and performance improvements. Google says there were three goals in mind with this particular update: \"Make it faster, more reliable, and complete.\"</p><p>To that first point, the app should perform quite well, if the company is to be believed. Google claims its new Home app is over 70% faster on some Android devices than before, with crashes down by almost 80%, while smart camera live views supposedly load 30% faster with 40% fewer playback failures. </p><p>The new design comes with three main tabs: There's the Home tab, which is where you see all of the controls for your smart home devices. Within this tab, there are swipeable menus for things like Favorites and devices. Next, there's the Activity tab, which contains your home's activity history. You can see when a routine was started, when motion was detected on a camera, and when a light was turned off. Finally, there's the Automations tab: You can see which automations are coming up, access your entire automations collection, and create new automations as well.  </p><p>Google has also integrated \"the best\" of the Nest app into the new Home app. While the dedicated Nest app is still available, Google clearly intends for Nest functionality to live here long-term. That includes support for Nest Thermostats from 2015 on, as well as Nest Protect smoke and CO emergency alerts and Nest x Yale Lock passcode management. Google says the experience of controlling previous Nest devices is also enhanced in the new app, with higher frame rates and faster loading times.</p><p>Finally, there's \"Ask Home,\" a new Gemini-powered feature that aims to make it easy to find any element of your smart home. For example, Google says you can type things like \"lights\" or \"living room\" to find deices and automations related to those queries. You can look up clips from your smart cameras, stack multiple smart home commands together, or create an automation with natural language.  </p><p>Google says all of these changes are rolling out today, Wednesday, Oct. 1 around the globe. </p>\n            </article>\n    </div>\n<div>\n    <div>\n        <p><span>The Download Newsletter</span>\n            <span>Never miss a tech story</span>\n        </p>\n        <p><img src=\"https://lifehacker.com/images/team/Jake.png\" alt=\"Jake Peterson portrait\" />\n            <span>Jake Peterson\n            </span>\n            <span>Senior tech editor</span>\n        </p>\n        <p><span>Get the latest tech news, <span></span>reviews, <span></span>and advice from Jake and the team.</span>\n    </p></div>\n    <div>\n        <p><span>The Download Newsletter</span>\n            <span><span>Never miss a tech story.</span> Get the latest tech news, <span></span>reviews, <span></span>and advice from Jake and the team.</span>\n        </p>\n    </div>\n</div>\n    </div>\n            <div>\n                <p><span>\n                        Keep Scrolling for Next Article\n                    </span>\n                </p>\n            </div>\n        </div>\n    </div>"

On the surface, it does sound pretty invasive, especially from a company that typically promotes user privacy. While this really is a new feature, here's the thing: It isn't as bad as it sounds. And, if you really don't like it, you can turn it off.</p><p>The feature, \"Visited Places,\" is actually intended to be a private way to keep tabs on the places you've been to, and to easily recall your favorites in the future. When the feature is enabled, Maps will take note of places you visit, even if you don't use Maps to get there. It's like a passive, automatic journal, taking note of restaurants, malls, parks, or simply general locations you venture to day-to-day. <a href=\"https://support.apple.com/guide/iphone/view-and-mange-visited-places-iph0c2597c4f/ios\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"open in a new window\">According to Apple</a>, all of this information is stored on your synced devices only, and is end-to-end encrypted, which means Apple has no way to access this data. </p><div>\n        <p><img src=\"https://lifehacker.com/images/short-lifehacker-logo.jpg\" alt=\"Lifehacker Logo\" /></p><div>\n            <p><span>You May Also Like</span></p>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n<p>If you have the feature enabled, you'll find your Visited Places appropriately tucked away in the \"Places\" menu when you launch Maps. I've only had the feature turned on for a day or so, so I only have three locations currently saved, but all three were destinations I visited without using Maps to guide me there. </p><p>Personally, I have no issue with keeping this setting turned on: Nobody has access to the data except for me, and I can imagine it reminding me of the places I've enjoyed visiting during a future scroll.</p><div>\n            <p><span>\n                What do you think so far?\n            </span>\n        </p></div>\n<p>Apple says you will be asked to turn on the feature when you open Maps after updating to iOS 26, and, in my experience, that was the case. However, <a href=\"https://www.cnet.com/tech/services-and-software/your-iphones-maps-app-is-tracking-you-in-ios-26-heres-how-to-stop-it/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"open in a new window\">for CNET writer Zachary McAuliffe</a>, the feature was already enabled without his input. As such, it might be smart to double-check that the feature is set to whichever setting you prefer, lest you allow Maps to track your movements without your knowledge. </p><h2 id=\"how-to-manage-visited-places-in-apple-maps\">How to manage 'Visited Places' in Apple Maps  </h2><p>To check whether the feature is turned on or off, head to <strong>Settings > Apps > Maps > Location</strong>. Alternatively, you can go to <strong>Settings > Privacy & Security > Location Services > Maps</strong>. Either way, check the toggle next to \"Visited Places.\" </p><p>You can also delete any Visited Places without needing to turn the feature off altogether. Open Maps, tap \"Places,\" then \"Visited Places.\" Here, you can swipe left on any place to delete it, or choose \"Clear History\" to delete them all. Plus, you can choose how long you want Maps to store your Visited Places: The default is \"Forever,\" but you can also select \"3 Months\" or \"1 Year,\" if you wish. </p>\n            </article>\n    </div>\n<div>\n    <div>\n        <p><span>The Download Newsletter</span>\n            <span>Never miss a tech story</span>\n        </p>\n        <p><img src=\"https://lifehacker.com/images/team/Jake.png\" alt=\"Jake Peterson portrait\" />\n            <span>Jake Peterson\n            </span>\n            <span>Senior tech editor</span>\n        </p>\n        <p><span>Get the latest tech news, <span></span>reviews, <span></span>and advice from Jake and the team.</span>\n    </p></div>\n    <div>\n        <p><span>The Download Newsletter</span>\n            <span><span>Never miss a tech story.</span> Get the latest tech news, <span></span>reviews, <span></span>and advice from Jake and the team.</span>\n        </p>\n    </div>\n</div>\n    </div>\n            <div>\n                <p><span>\n                        Keep Scrolling for Next Article\n                    </span>\n                </p>\n            </div>\n        </div>"

No longer. These days, you can download a free app on any smartphone, and instantly have the tools necessary to put together a legitimate video, especially for social media platforms like TikTok,  Instagram, and YouTube. </p><p>It would have been difficult to imagine something like Adobe Premiere working properly on a smartphone in the heyday of desktop video editing, but these days, it's a reality. Perhaps that's why Adobe is changing with the times. Following its <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/tech/photoshop-is-officially-available-on-iphone-and-android\" target=\"_blank\">Photoshop mobile app</a> rollout earlier this year, <a href=\"https://apps.apple.com/us/app/adobe-premiere-video-editor/id6742757464\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"open in a new window\">Adobe released an official version of Premiere for iPhone on Tuesday</a>. The company had announced the news <a href=\"https://blog.adobe.com/en/publish/2025/09/04/adobe-premiere-bringing-pro-quality-video-editing-to-your-iphone\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"open in a new window\">at the beginning of the month</a>, and confirmed an Android version is in the works. </p><div>\n        <p><img src=\"https://lifehacker.com/images/short-lifehacker-logo.jpg\" alt=\"Lifehacker Logo\" /></p><div>\n            <p><span>You May Also Like</span></p>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n<h2 id=\"premiere-for-iphone\">Premiere for iPhone </h2><p>According to Adobe, if you're familiar with Premiere, you'll be familiar with its mobile adaptation. There's the same multi-track timeline, with \"vibrant colors and dynamic audio waveforms,\" that supports frame-by-frame trimming, layering, and tuning. There are automatic captions, subtitles, layers for video, audio, text, and 4K HDR support. </p><p>Unlike the current desktop version of Premiere, which requires a subscription, the mobile version of Premiere is free to download and use. Adobe says that only users who need extra storage or want to use the app's AI features need to pay—though it doesn't appear that Adobe has released pricing information yet. To that point, Adobe is pushing some of its AI features here, including Generative Sound Effects, which combines your voice with text prompts to produce a stylized voice over. There's also Enhance Speech, which uses AI in an attempt to improve the quality of your voice recordings.</p><p>You can also use <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/tech/adobe-is-also-making-an-ai-video-generator\" target=\"_blank\">Adobe Firefly</a>, the company's AI content generator, to generate video, image, and audio assets. Adobe says Firefly content is safe for commercial use, so you should have no issue including generations in your content. In addition, you can tap into any of the assets in the Adobe Stock library, which includes music, sound effects, photos, graphics, and videos. </p><p>While it seems like the major editing tools you'd expect from the full Premiere app are here, there's no doubt this experience was designed for mobile—and the platforms that mobile video editors tend to produce for. Adobe says you can export your projects instantly to platforms like TikTok, YouTube Shorts, or Instagram—as well as Premiere Pro, if you have it—in case you'd like to finish the video in these apps. If you complete the video in Premiere, you can publish the finished product directly to TikTok, YouTube Shorts, and Instagram. Videos can also automatically resize depending on the platform you're sending it to.  </p><h2 id=\"will-premiere-on-mobile-be-worth-it\">Will Premiere on mobile be worth it?</h2><p>There are <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/tech/the-best-alternatives-to-capcut\" target=\"_blank\">a lot of video editing apps out there</a> specifically designed for mobile use. That's not to say Premiere won't be a good editing option: Adobe's editor is popular for a reason, and if they've properly designed it to work on an iPhone or Android, it could be a serious threat to existing options like CapCut and LumaFusion. In fact, the company has already dipped its toe into mobile editors before, with Adobe Premiere Rush. That app is much more basic than the version of Premiere Adobe is announcing today.    </p><div>\n            <p><span>\n                What do you think so far?\n            </span>\n        </p></div>\n<p>Many users will likely enjoy trying out the app free of charge, and I know most (if not all) will have no problem shirking Adobe's expensive subscriptions. However, as the saying goes, if a product is free, <em>you</em> are the product. According to Premiere's App Privacy report in the App Store, there's a lot of data Adobe collects from you when using this app, including:</p><ul><li><p>Purchases </p></li><li><p>Contact Info</p></li><li><p>User Content</p></li><li><p>Identifiers</p></li><li><p>Usage Data</p></li><li><p>Location (not linked to you)</p></li><li><p>Diagnostics (not linked to you)</p></li></ul><p><a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20250904132416/https://apps.apple.com/us/app/adobe-premiere-video-editor/id6742757464\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"open in a new window\">This is actually an improvement from the initial announcement</a>. Back then, Search History and \"Other Data\" were part of the data collection list, as they are with Adobe Premiere Rush. More concerningly, these data points, along with Location data, were linked to your identity. If Adobe had kept the privacy policies the same, the company would know where you were when editing your videos. At some point in the past month, that changed.</p><p>But there's no denying there are some privacy trade-offs here. Sure, it's great to have a full-fledged video editor on your iPhone, but will it be worth the privacy invasion? It's not the only one of Adobe's apps to collect this much data, nor does Adobe have <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/tech/adobe-has-responded-to-criticism-of-its-new-terms-of-service\" target=\"_blank\">the best track record</a> when it comes to user privacy, but still, it's worth a consideration before you use it. LumaFusion, for example, does not collect any data that is linked to your identity. The data it does collect—identifiers, diagnostics, and usage data—is anonymized, so it can't be traced back to you, though the app does cost $30. While Premiere is not alone in its data collection policies, understand that any purchases, contacts, content, or data generated by your usage can be collected by Adobe and tied to you.  </p><p>If Premiere for mobile is as capable an editor as Premiere Pro, I imagine this could make for a great experience, especially for those already in the Adobe ecosystem. For others, there may be some compromises to weigh.</p>\n            </article>\n    </div>\n<div>\n    <div>\n        <p><span>The Download Newsletter</span>\n            <span>Never miss a tech story</span>\n        </p>\n        <p><img src=\"https://lifehacker.com/images/team/Jake.png\" alt=\"Jake Peterson portrait\" />\n            <span>Jake Peterson\n            </span>\n            <span>Senior tech editor</span>\n        </p>\n        <p><span>Get the latest tech news, <span></span>reviews, <span></span>and advice from Jake and the team.</span>\n    </p></div>\n    <div>\n        <p><span>The Download Newsletter</span>\n            <span><span>Never miss a tech story.</span> Get the latest tech news, <span></span>reviews, <span></span>and advice from Jake and the team.</span>\n        </p>\n    </div>\n</div>\n    </div>\n            <div>\n                <p><span>\n                        Keep Scrolling for Next Article\n                    </span>\n                </p>\n            </div>\n        </div>\n    </div>"

announced</a> a whole new fleet of equipment devices and the addition of AI fitness coaching, all in an effort to usher in \"a new era of connective wellness.\" The upgraded Bikes and Treads will probably be the biggest news of the day, but I was interested in another development: the brand's new partnerships and acquisition, which are also aligned with that \"connective wellness\" goal. </p><p>The company deepened its partnership with Hyrox, partnered with two new companies, and acquired Breathwrk, all while also adding more depth to existing elements of \"human connection\" on its robust platform. </p><div>\n        <p><img src=\"https://lifehacker.com/images/short-lifehacker-logo.jpg\" alt=\"Lifehacker Logo\" /></p><div>\n            <p><span>You May Also Like</span></p>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n<h2 id=\"peloton-acquired-breathwrk\">Peloton acquired Breathwrk</h2><p>Yesterday, I attended the press event announcing all the big Peloton news. For the most part, everything made sense. New devices, better software, and updated classes to go along with them seemed like logical steps for a leading at-home fitness company to take over a decade into its existence. But then a presenter mentioned that Peloton had \"acquired <a href=\"https://zdcs.link/QOg36B?pageview_type=Standard&template=News&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=Breathwrk&short_url=QOg36B&u=https%3A%2F%2Flifehacker.com%2Fhealth%2Fpeloton-new-acquisitions-partnerships&event_label=Breathwrk\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"open in a new window\">Breathwrk</a>.\" This, it turns out, is exactly what it sounds like: It's an app that guides the user through breathing exercises—like calming breaths, breathing for sleep, and breathing for energy—designed to \"unleash your peak mental and physical potential.\" </p><p>Earlier this year, Peloton execs <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/health/peloton-price-changes-letter-to-investors\" target=\"_blank\">hinted at price increases</a> for memberships and mentioned a plan to roll out more \"fitness and wellness experiences.\" To that end, I've noticed a lot more \"wellness,\" generally, in the app's offerings. Beyond the cardio and strength classes Peloton is known for, I've found <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/health/why-i-like-pelotons-meditation-classes\" target=\"_blank\">meditation</a>, \"<a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/health/peloton-reflection-rides\" target=\"_blank\">reflection rides</a>,\" and <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/health/peloton-nutrition-recipe-content-youtube\" target=\"_blank\">nutritional content</a>. It's been obvious for a while that the company's aspirations are greater than dominating the exercise space; they want to go deeper on mental health, nutrition, and everything else that goes into being well-rounded and healthy. </p><p>Per Peloton, All Access and App+ members can now access Breathwrk's app by using their Peloton login credentials. Further integrations between the two will be \"coming soon.\" </p><h2 id=\"pelotons-new-partnerships\">Peloton's new partnerships</h2><p>Peloton also announced partnerships with the Hospital for Special Surgery and Respin Health. HSS is a leader in orthopedics and rheumatology. Together, the two will \"produce programming focused on musculoskeletal injury prevention and recovery.\" That's all expected to start rolling out in the next few weeks. It's another bit of news that makes sense. In announcing the addition of an AI coach to personalize every member's workout plan, Peloton's reps pointed out that the software will use users' goals and existing workout data to outline what they should do for the next week—including when they should take rests. While ramping up wellness initiatives, Peloton hasn't overlooked the role rest plays in overall health. I'm interested to see what the HHS programming looks like in practice. </p><p>Respin is a platfor, launched by Halle Berry for those going through everything from perimenopause to postmenopause. The two brands will co-create an eight-week program of Peloton classes to specifically target symptom relief and various improvements for members going through those life changes. Again, these are coming in the next few weeks. </p><div>\n            <p><span>\n                What do you think so far?\n            </span>\n        </p></div>\n<p>Finally, Peloton is doubling down on <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/health/peloton-hyrox-training-classes\" target=\"_blank\">its partnership with Hyrox</a>. That isn't a <em>new</em> partnership, but it's one that has apparently been fruitful enough to warrant the allocation of more resources. If you don't know, <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/health/what-is-hyrox-fitness-competition\" target=\"_blank\">Hyrox is a relatively new sport</a> that involves running plus competing in things like sled pulls and pushes, among other exercises. You have to row, do burpees, and do a farmer's carry, too, all in the name of demonstrating how versatile you are as an athlete. Peloton has had a special Hyrox training program in place for a few months now, but plans to expand its offerings with new branded classes that support training for the various parts of the race. </p><h2 id=\"improvements-to-human-connections\">Improvements to \"human connections\"</h2><p>Peloton is also expanding what users can do with its existing offerings aimed at \"human connections.\" Primarily, this involves the addition of Club Peloton and Official Peloton Teams. </p><p>Club Peloton is a recognition program that awards users a rank based on how consistently they work out and whether they try new types of exercises. If you check your Peloton app right now, you might find you've already been assigned a rank, like bronze, silver, gold, or legendary. The idea is that your rank will eventually earn you rewards, like discounts on products or early access to classes. You'll also get a profile badge which will be visible to others when you're on a class leaderboard. </p><p>Official Peloton Teams is an expansion of Peloton's popular <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/health/pelotons-teams-is-surprisingly-good-at-motivating-me-to-work-out\" target=\"_blank\">Teams feature, which I already love</a>. With Teams, you join forces with friends and compete with or against them to hit certain goals, like a particular amount of workouts per week. You can also join Teams based on attributes like life stage (like being a new mom) or region (like the city where you live). Official Peloton Teams are the newest part of all that and are helmed by the company's famous instructors. You can join ones like Move for Life, Cross Training, Hyrox training, and Menopause Health. </p>\n            </article>\n    </div>\n<div>\n    <div>\n        <p><span>The Daily Newsletter</span>\n            <span>Ready to do everything better?</span>\n        </p>\n        <p><img src=\"https://lifehacker.com/images/team/Jordan.png\" alt=\"Jordan Calhoun portrait\" />\n            <span>Jordan Calhoun\n            </span>\n            <span>Editor in chief</span>\n        </p>\n        <p><span><span>Get daily tips, tricks, <span>and tech guides</span></span> <span>from Jordan and the team.</span></span>\n    </p></div>\n    <div>\n        <p><span>The Daily Newsletter</span>\n            <span><span>Ready to do everything better?</span> <span>Get daily tips, tricks, <span>and tech guides</span></span> <span>from Jordan and the team.</span></span>\n        </p>\n    </div>\n</div>\n    </div>\n            <div>\n                <p><span>\n                        Keep Scrolling for Next Article\n                    </span>\n                </p>\n            </div>\n        </div>\n    </div>"

Whether you want to build a smart security system, turn a “dumb” device smart, or simply control your lights from your phone, this guide will help walk you through it.</em></p>\n        </span>\n    </p>\n    <article>\n        <hr />\n        <p>Smart home devices can streamline a lot of your day-to-day tasks. With an internet connection and some simple automations, you may never have to carry house keys, turn off the lights, or touch your thermostat again. But all of this convenience comes at a potential cost, as smart tech is vulnerable to attack by cyber actors, leaving your personal data and your privacy at risk. </p><p>Here's what you need to know to secure your smart home.</p><h2 id=\"is-your-smart-home-secure\">Is your smart home secure? </h2><p>The short answer: not by default. Smart homes have vulnerabilities at multiple levels, from the devices themselves, to your home network, to the physical endpoints, like your phone, that have access to and control over your Internet of Things (IoT). </p>\n<p>To start, IoT devices may have weak built-in security protocols or lack clear instructions to help users lock them down from factory settings, leaving them vulnerable to hackers, who may have to exert very little effort to access your data or spy on you. Wifi routers and smart home devices often have default credentials that are publicly available and therefore easy to get past—and  <a href=\"https://www.ibm.com/think/insights/router-reality-check-86-percent-default-passwords-have-never-been-changed\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"open in a new window\">data show</a> that the vast majority of users have never changed their router admin password or adjusted any factory settings. If your home network isn't secure, nothing connected to it can be considered secure either. </p><p>Smart devices can also be integrated into botnets, allowing threat actors to conduct malicious activity like account takeovers and malware distribution using your home network. A recent instance of this was <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/tech/this-android-malware-is-attacking-smart-home-devices\" target=\"_blank\">a campaign known as BADBOX 2.0</a>, which targeted off-brand consumer electronics manufactured in China. </p><p>Bill Budington, a senior staff technologist at the <a href=\"https://www.eff.org/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"open in a new window\">Electronic Frontier Foundation</a> (EFF), notes the digital divide may increase the risk for some consumers, who may seek out cheaper devices from low-cost manufacturers that have weaker security and far less to lose in terms of reputation if they are implicated in vulnerabilities as compared to major companies like Amazon. </p><p>Finally, security can be compromised if your physical devices fall into the wrong hands. For example, if you control your smart home using apps on your phone, a threat actor could gain access in the event said phone is lost, stolen, or hacked.  </p><h2 id=\"smart-homes-can-compromise-privacy\">Smart homes can compromise privacy</h2><p>Left unsecured, smart home devices can also put your privacy (and potentially your safety) at risk. Internet-connected cameras, from baby monitors to pet cams, <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/tech/can-someone-spy-through-webcam-or-phone\" target=\"_blank\">are vulnerable to hacking</a>, and threat actors can use them to surveil you and your home. This may include snooping on and tracking your movements, \"shoulder surfing\" to collect sensitive personal information from your devices, recording audio and video footage of your private activities, and sharing or selling live feeds on the dark web. (In <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/nest-baby-monitor-hacked-by-man-who-threatened-kidnapping-2018-12\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"open in a new window\">a particularly alarming incident in 2018</a>, a hacker reportedly issued verbal threats toward a four-month-old child through a Nest-branded baby monitor.)</p><p>Your smart tech is also likely collecting a lot of information about you in the course of its normal activities—all of which could be exploited. For example, your robot vacuum creates and utilizes a map of your home's physical layout to know where to go, and usage patterns from various automations can be used to track your movements and confirm when you're away from home. </p><p>There's also the possibility that your smart home devices are compromising your data in ways you aren't aware of and haven't actively consented to. A <a href=\"https://engineering.nyu.edu/news/new-research-reveals-alarming-privacy-and-security-threats-smart-homes\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"open in a new window\">2023 report from security experts</a>—led by the nonprofit IMDEA Networks and Northeastern University—shows that IoT devices may inadvertently expose personal information that can be harvested and sold to companies involved in surveillance capitalism. Researchers found that spyware apps and advertisers abuse local network protocols to access sensitive data, making it easier to profile users. </p><h2 id=\"no-security-standards-for-smart-homes\">No security standards for smart homes</h2><p>One of the biggest barriers to smart home security is that there isn't a single set of cybersecurity standards that companies have to follow, nor a centralized resource for users to research this information. Earlier this year—during the last few weeks of the Biden administration—the Federal Communications Commission launched the <a href=\"https://www.fcc.gov/CyberTrustMark\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"open in a new window\">U.S. Cyber Trust Mark</a> voluntary labeling program to incentivize device manufacturers to improve security and help consumers buy with confidence. However, under the Trump administration, the agency later <a href=\"https://www.cybersecuritydive.com/news/fcc-cyber-trust-mark-ul-investigation-delay/758507/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"open in a new window\">launched an investigation</a> into the program, delaying its rollout. </p><p>For now, consumers are left to do their own due diligence. In 2017, the nonprofit Mozilla Foundation created a resource called <a href=\"https://www.mozillafoundation.org/en/privacynotincluded/categories/smart-home/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"open in a new window\">*Privacy Not Included</a>, with reviews of products measured against \"minimum security standards\" and breakdowns of any privacy concerns. The site doesn't appear to have been updated in the last year, but you can still find detailed information about the privacy and security history of well-known smart home manufacturers like Amazon, Google, Wyze, and Ecobee. </p><p>Otherwise, Budington suggests simply searching the device you're considering (and the company that makes it) before buying, to see if researchers or users have reported any concerns. </p><div>\n            <p><span>\n                What do you think so far?\n            </span>\n        </p></div>\n<h2 id=\"how-to-improve-your-smart-home-security\">How to improve your smart home security</h2><p>Securing your smart home starts with securing your internet connection via your router. Lifehacker has assembled a whole <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/home/how-to-make-your-home-security-system-and-wireless-network-safe\" target=\"_blank\">guide to protecting your home network</a>, but at the very least, you should change any default router settings—admin usernames, passwords, and network names—to something unique and not personally identifiable, and turn on encryption in your wireless security settings. Regularly check for updates, which provide patches for security flaws, and audit the devices connected to your network to identify anything suspicious and remove those you no longer use. </p><p>You can add another layer of security with a guest network set up specifically for your IoT devices. That way, if your smart devices are compromised, everything connected to your primary network (such as computers and phones with access to your personal and financial accounts) will be protected. </p><p>According to Budington, one way to further mitigate vulnerability is to reduce the number of devices with their own wireless connection, running them through a secure, centralized hub instead. Home Assistant is a <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/tech/self-host-apps\" target=\"_blank\">self-hosted option</a> that can be installed on a Raspberry Pi or a traditional PC or used with the plug-and-play Home Assistant Green. Hubitat also gives you local control over your device data and integrates with a variety of products, including those compatible with the <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/tech/your-most-important-smart-home-decision-is-the-ecosystem-you-choose\" target=\"_blank\">Zigbee, Z-Wave, and Matter standards</a>. </p><p>Once your network is secure, you'll want to <a href=\"https://consumer.ftc.gov/articles/securing-your-internet-connected-devices-home\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"open in a new window\">take similar steps</a> with each of your IoT devices. Change default usernames and passwords to unique, secure alternatives and enable all available security features, such as two-factor authentication and encryption, in the device settings. Ensure your devices (and any apps used to control them) receive automatic firmware updates. </p><p>You should also <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/tech/how-to-protect-your-privacy-when-using-smart-home-tech\" target=\"_blank\">check your device's privacy settings</a>, removing permissions that aren't essential for it to function and disabling features you won't use. For example, you could turn off location tracking on your smart thermostat and disable voice control for devices other than your voice assistant. </p><p>Finally, while we've focused mostly on digital threats, your smart home isn't immune to physical compromise. Be aware of ways your devices can be accessed, such as those installed on the exterior of your house, and ensure phones and tablets and the apps on them that control IoT devices are secured with a PIN or biometric authentication.</p><p>Remember that, by nature, anything connected to the internet is at least somewhat vulnerable to attack. You'll have to consider your own risk tolerance and weigh the convenience of having a smart device against the potential for it to be compromised—and your privacy along with it. You may find that there are some things that you simply don't need to automate, and therefore you can stick with the \"dumb\" alternative. </p>\n            </article>\n    <div>\n    <div>\n        <p><span>The Download Newsletter</span>\n            <span>Never miss a tech story</span>\n        </p>\n        <p><img src=\"https://lifehacker.com/images/team/Jake.png\" alt=\"Jake Peterson portrait\" />\n            <span>Jake Peterson\n            </span>\n        </p>\n        <p><span>Get the latest tech news, <span></span>reviews, <span></span>and advice from Jake and the team.</span>\n    </p></div>\n    <div>\n        <p><span>The Download Newsletter</span>\n            <span><span>Never miss a tech story.</span> Get the latest tech news, <span></span>reviews, <span></span>and advice from Jake and the team.</span>\n        </p>\n    </div>\n</div>\n                        <div>\n                <div>\n                    <p><img src=\"https://lifehacker.com/imagery/authors/01HF2FBGBC5PWJAAJJJHG350CH/image.fill.size_150x150.v1737570988.png\" alt=\"Photo of Emily Long\" />\n                                            </p>\n                </div>\n                <div>\n                                            <div>\n    <p>More by Emily</p>\n        <hr />\n        </div>\n                        <div>\n                <p><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://lifehacker.com/entertainment/wordle-nyt-hint-today-october-2-2025\">\n                    <img src=\"https://lifehacker.com/imagery/articles/01K68S41CHCWJ4F299VWHC7BBE/hero-image.fill.size_75x75.v1759083890.jpg\" alt=\"wordle art\" />\n                </a>\n            </p></div>\n        <hr />\n                    <div>\n                <p><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://lifehacker.com/how-to-cancel-amazon-prime\">\n                    <img src=\"https://lifehacker.com/imagery/articles/01HF2GRAFWZ95BVYWGFVS9A6SE/hero-image.fill.size_75x75.v1699834331.jpg\" alt=\"Amazon boxes on porch\" />\n                </a>\n            </p></div>\n        <hr />\n                                        </div>\n            </div>\n                                </section>\n                                                </section>\n    </div>"
