I ran, I walked, I strength trained, and even did a little indoor cycling. I’ve learned a few things, but the strangest is that I didn’t need an Apple Watch for any of it. </p><p>Workout Buddy is an AI-powered feature that sends a little voice into your headphones to motivate and congratulate you as you’re working out. Apple touted Workout Buddy <a href=\"https://zdcs.link/QxxwGO?pageview_type=Standard&template=Explainers&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=as%20a%20feature%20of%20WatchOS%2026&short_url=QxxwGO&u=https%3A%2F%2Flifehacker.com%2Fhealth%2Fsurprising-things-about-apples-new-workout-buddy&event_label=as%20a%20feature%20of%20WatchOS%2026\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"open in a new window\"><u>as a feature of WatchOS 26</u></a> and <a href=\"https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2025/09/apple-debuts-apple-watch-series-11-featuring-groundbreaking-health-insights/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"open in a new window\"><u>promoted it among the features</u></a> of the new <a href=\"https://zdcs.link/z31xdE?pageview_type=Standard&template=Explainers&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=Series%2011%20Apple%20Watch&short_url=z31xdE&u=https%3A%2F%2Flifehacker.com%2Fhealth%2Fsurprising-things-about-apples-new-workout-buddy&event_label=Series%2011%20Apple%20Watch\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"open in a new window\"><u>Series 11 Apple Watch</u></a>, so you’d be forgiven for thinking it’s part of of the Apple Watch, specifically. But that’s not what I found. </p><div>\n        <p><img src=\"https://lifehacker.com/images/short-lifehacker-logo.jpg\" alt=\"Lifehacker Logo\" /></p><div>\n            <p><span>You May Also Like</span></p>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n<h2 id=\"how-to-use-workout-buddy-without-an-apple-watch\">How to use Workout Buddy without an Apple Watch</h2><p>But as I found when I took a supported Apple Watch out for a trail run with an old iPhone (a 12 Mini), Workout Buddy <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/health/workout-buddy-apple-watch-requirements\" target=\"_blank\"><u>requires a phone that supports Apple Intelligence</u></a>, so I didn’t have access to it. OK, fine, it needs a newer watch <em>and</em> a newer phone. (Or so I thought.) Eventually I got my hands on a 16 Pro and, yep, was able to enable and use Workout Buddy. </p><p>But this week—with a Series 11 Apple Watch on my wrist and WatchOS 26 installed—I discovered something. I could power off the watch, or even leave it at home, and <em>still get Workout Buddy</em>. Here are a few things I tried, <em>all</em> of which got me Workout Buddy: </p><ul><li><p>Starting a workout from the Series 10 or Series 11 Apple Watch</p></li><li><p>Starting a workout from the Fitness app (<a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/health/ios-26-gives-the-iphone-a-real-fitness-app\" target=\"_blank\"><u>you can do that now!</u></a>) with the Powerbeats Pro 2 headphones paired</p></li><li><p>Starting a workout from the Fitness app without any other Apple products in range, just a Coospo heart rate monitor and some Shokz headphones</p></li><li><p>Starting a workout from the Fitness app with just Shokz headphones paired (no heart rate monitor, since it was a GPS-enabled walk)</p></li></ul><p>The only configuration that <em>wouldn’t</em> give me Workout Buddy was using the Fitness app without headphones paired. It’s serious about needing headphones, but they can be paired to either the Watch or the iPhone. </p><h2 id=\"workout-buddy-is-more-of-a-chipper-sidekick-than-a-coach\">Workout Buddy is more of a chipper sidekick than a coach</h2><p>I hoped Workout Buddy might provide some kind of coaching or workout guidance, but found that’s not quite what it’s there for. The biggest difference between having Workout Buddy on versus off during a run is that, with Workout Buddy, you get your splits read to you in a more conversational voice.</p><p>The main advantage of Workout Buddy is that it gives you a check-in at the beginning and end of your workout to let you know where you stand on your goals and progress for the day and the week, and it will call out any notable recent achievements. </p><div>\n            <p><span>\n                What do you think so far?\n            </span>\n        </p></div>\n<p>For example, at the start of pretty much every workout this week—whether running, walking, or strength–it congratulated me on running my fastest-ever 5K last Tuesday. It also let me know I logged at least 16 workouts every week for the past four weeks, which is very consistent of me. </p><p>The workout count seems to be correct (I log a lot of short workouts for device testing), but the 5K callout is wrong. Last Tuesday I earned a 5K badge, but that’s just for logging a run of more than five kilometers, not for running my <em>fastest</em> 5K. According to the Fitness app—remember, the same app that contains Workout Buddy—my fastest 5K was in July of 2021. </p><p>Besides those hallucinations, the information seems to be reasonable. The overly-enthusiastic voice of the Workout Buddy always tells me at the start of each workout where I stand on my ring-closing goals. I need 22 more minutes to close my Exercise ring, it might say, or 37 more calories to close the Move ring. At the start of a run, it will tell me how many miles I’ve already run this week. And if I have music playing, it will name-check the band—seemingly just to let me know it can read that data. “Get into the rhythm with Fleetwood Mac!” it told me once, just as a Fleetwood Mac song was fading out. </p><p>Overall, I find the goal-oriented check-ins useful; knowing I have 22 minutes left on my exercise goal does make me more likely to extend my workout if I was only going to do a 20-minute one. The conversational voice giving me my mile splits is a bit nicer than hearing the generic, more robot-like voice. And if I <em>had</em> run my fastest 5K recently, I’d probably love to be reminded about it at every opportunity. </p>\n            </article>\n    </div>\n<div>\n    <div>\n        <p><span>The Daily Newsletter</span>\n            <span>Ready to do everything better?</span>\n        </p>\n        <p><img src=\"https://lifehacker.com/images/team/Jordan.png\" alt=\"Jordan Calhoun portrait\" />\n            <span>Jordan Calhoun\n            </span>\n            <span>Editor in chief</span>\n        </p>\n        <p><span><span>Get daily tips, tricks, <span>and tech guides</span></span> <span>from Jordan and the team.</span></span>\n    </p></div>\n    <div>\n        <p><span>The Daily Newsletter</span>\n            <span><span>Ready to do everything better?</span> <span>Get daily tips, tricks, <span>and tech guides</span></span> <span>from Jordan and the team.</span></span>\n        </p>\n    </div>\n</div>\n    </div>\n            <div>\n                <p><span>\n                        Keep Scrolling for Next Article\n                    </span>\n                </p>\n            </div>\n        </div>\n    </div>"

But there’s good reason to believe taking notes by hand helps your brain retain more. Here’s why you should try leaving the laptop behind at home and how to make the switch to the old-school way easier.</p><h2 id=\"digital-note-taking-isnt-perfect\">Digital note-taking isn’t perfect</h2><p>There’s been plenty of research that has suggested hand-taken notes are superior to those you take on a computer, even though typing is so much faster and you can get more information on the page. Actually, that’s part of the problem: When taking notes by hand, you have to be choosy about what is important enough to write down. You have to use critical thinking, make outlines, and listen closely to determine what parts of the lecture are valuable enough to take the time to jot down. When you’re typing, you can just transcribe the whole lecture in real time if you want—and you might go on autopilot to do so without engaging your brain deeply in the material. </p>\n<p>I made this mistake in grad school: I'd type everything the professor said, so focused on getting every word that I didn't actually <em>hear</em> the lesson. Worse, I ended up what amounted to transcripts—and the majority of what the professors would say during three-hour classes wasn't relevant to my concrete learning goals. I'd end up feeding my messy \"notes\" <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/the-best-ways-to-study-but-not-cheat-using-ai-tools\" target=\"_blank\">into AI tools</a> and asking for summaries. I could have just listened more thoughtfully and intentionally the first time around.</p><p>Recent research backing up note-taking as the reigning champ was <a href=\"https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/0098628320979895\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"open in a new window\">published in <em>Teaching of Psychology</em></a> in 2022. Researchers put participants in four categories: those who took notes by hand and took a test on the computer, those who took notes on the computer and took a test by hand, those who took notes and did a test on the computer, and those who did it all by hand. Overall, regardless of how they ultimately took the test, the students who took notes by hand performed better on the quiz overall—and better on conceptual questions. </p><h2 id=\"your-computer-is-distracting\">Your computer is distracting</h2><p>It’s convenient to be able to look up concepts, jot down notes, and maintain tabs of supplemental materials throughout class, but it’s just as convenient to toggle over to a new window and scroll social media or send work emails. Being distracted in class is not helpful for your retention and performance, regardless of whether the tool at hand <em>could </em>help you if you were using it to.</p><p>A <a href=\"https://ojs.lib.uwo.ca/index.php/cjsotl_rcacea/article/view/8002\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"open in a new window\">2012 survey</a> published in the <em>Canadian Journal for the Scholarship of Teaching</em> and Learning showed that of 478 students and 36 instructors surveyed at one university, almost half found the use of technology in class for noneducational purposes distracting. There have been a <em>bunch</em> of other studies showing that use of phones or laptops for noneducational purposes during class has a negative effect on academic performance. It's why we're seeing so many jurisdictions around the country push for<a href=\"https://mashable.com/article/school-phone-ban-survey\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"open in a new window\"> phone-free school zones for kids</a>. The journal articles on these results have pretty straightforward titles like “<a href=\"https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/01443410.2018.1489046?journalCode=cedp20\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"open in a new window\">Dividing Attention in the Classroom Reduces Exam Performance</a>” and make it clear that doing anything but taking notes or following along with class materials on the computer is only impacting your ability to obtain and retain valuable information. </p><p>And since taking notes on the computer isn’t all that great to begin with, you might as well not bring the device at all. </p><div>\n            <p><span>\n                What do you think so far?\n            </span>\n        </p></div>\n<h2 id=\"plan-your-note-taking\">Plan your note-taking </h2><p>If you've been typing your notes out for years, it will be a major adjustment to go back to the old notebook and pencil. How is your handwriting looking these days? Do you even know? Time to reacquaint yourself, but in the process, you'll need a strategy as you embark on this plan.</p><p>There is actually <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/best-note-taking-methods-1849535943\" target=\"_blank\">quite a variety of note-taking methods; </a>the best one for you will depend on what type of content you're studying and what kind of learner you are. I linked my guide to all the approaches above. You might find outlining, the Cornell technique, or \"mapping\" or \"charting\" to work best, but you'll have to play around with them a while to figure it out. </p><p>By the way, just because you take the notes by hand doesn't mean they have to stay hand-written. You can <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/best-ways-digitize-notes-1850896868\" target=\"_blank\">digitize your notes</a> using an app or even invest in a smart notebook that will do it for you as you write. I've used <a href=\"https://zdcs.link/z7Mn0V?pageview_type=Standard&template=Explainers&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=a%20Rocketbook%20smart%20notebook&short_url=z7Mn0V&u=https%3A%2F%2Flifehacker.com%2Fdont-use-laptop-to-take-notes-in-class&event_label=a%20Rocketbook%20smart%20notebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"open in a new window\">a Rocketbook smart notebook</a> in the past and found it intuitive and a nice way to straddle the analog and digital worlds. </p><p>Finally, make sure you <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/revise-your-notes-before-you-leave-class-1850774684\" target=\"_blank\">revise your notes before you leave class</a>, whenever possible. Going through them while the lecture is still fresh in your mind is crucial. You can either start digitizing them then, maybe by <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/tech/xmind-mind-mapping-app-review\" target=\"_blank\">using an app to make a mind map</a>, or just rewrite them on a different notebook page. </p>\n            </article>"

/><p>Before you sit down to study or get started on a big project for work, you might want to consider hitting the gym or taking a brisk walk. Besides just generally being good for your health, research also shows it can actually help with cognition. And with, say, the start of a new semester bearing down upon you or a work deadline looming, anything that can give you a brain boost is likely welcome. </p><h2 id=\"what-the-research-says-about-exercise-and-studying\">What the research says about exercise and studying</h2><p>There’s no shortage of solid, peer-reviewed research on the effect of exercise on cognition, going back <a href=\"https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Phillip-Tomporowski/publication/10893216_Effects_of_acute_bouts_of_exercise_on_cognition/links/5d9b7b95a6fdccfd0e81034e/Effects-of-acute-bouts-of-exercise-on-cognition.pdf?_sg%5B0%5D=started_experiment_milestone&origin=journalDetail&_rtd=e30%3D\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"open in a new window\">decades</a>. There's just a shortage on explanations. The exact reasons that exercise helps thinking aren’t fully understood, but <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5934999/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"open in a new window\">one 2018 review in <em>Frontiers in Psychology</em></a> discusses evidence that it may increase blood flow to the brain, boost levels of certain neurotransmitters, and increase your feelings of control and self-esteem. Purely anecdotally, I think that's true. When I leave the gym in the morning, I feel like I've already accomplished something and tend to be a little more of a go-getter at work, riding my smug little wave to continue the day's productive streak. </p><div>\n        <p><img src=\"https://lifehacker.com/images/short-lifehacker-logo.jpg\" alt=\"Lifehacker Logo\" /></p><div>\n            <p><span>You May Also Like</span></p>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3951958/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"open in a new window\">Another review</a>, from 2013, notes that “more active” individuals are better able to pay attention to their surroundings and process information more quickly. Exercise may even change our brains for the long term; the 2018 review concluded that “chronic aerobic exercise is associated with potent structural and functional neuroplastic changes, with an improvement in cognitive functions.”</p><h2 id=\"what-exercises-work-best-for-your-brain\">What exercises work best for your brain?</h2><p>The research is pro-exercise in all forms, but especially hones in on acute aerobic exercise—or the kind of exercise where you’re moving around a lot and your heart rate is up. A “single bout” of this kind of movement is related to improved cognitive functions, according to the researchers in <em>Frontiers</em>.</p><div>\n            <p><span>\n                What do you think so far?\n            </span>\n        </p></div>\n<p>So, before you sit down to study, plan your week, or have an important conversation with your boss, consider swimming, biking, jogging, running, hopping on the elliptical, or taking a brisk walk around the block. You want to get in some solid cardio here, even if it is as simple as biking to work or taking your lunch break at the gym. (<a href=\"https://www.lifehacker.com/how-much-exercise-do-i-really-need-1823708126\" target=\"_blank\">Here’s a guide to how much exercise you need</a> each week, in general.)</p><h2 id=\"how-to-make-time-to-work-out\">How to make time to work out</h2><p>I know it's hard to find time to work out, especially if you're a stressed-out student—but that makes it all the more important you do carve out some time for taking care of your body, regardless of the effect it has on your mind. Taking into account that it could make you a <em>better</em> student, it practically becomes non-negotiable. </p><p>If getting to the gym, the bike path, or the rec center truly isn't feasible, there is plenty you can do from the comfort of home or your dorm room. Since we're looking to get the heart rate up here, focus on cardio, to the extent possible in your space. <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/health/the-best-free-cardio-workout-channels-on-youtube\" target=\"_blank\">YouTube is full of great follow-along workout videos</a> that can get blood pumping, for instance. I'd also recommend having a designated workout app to guide you. I'm <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/health/peloton-app-review\" target=\"_blank\">partial to Peloton's app</a>, but while that app has all kinds of class types from <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/health/peloton-class-with-no-peloton-bike\" target=\"_blank\">cycling</a> to <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/health/peloton-guided-walk-workouts-recommendation\" target=\"_blank\">walking</a> to <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/health/pelotons-yoga-offerings-are-surprisingly-robust\" target=\"_blank\">yoga</a>, it can also cost up to $44 a month, making it a little difficult to maintain for a student. As a free alternative, you can try <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/health/nike-training-club-app-review\" target=\"_blank\">Nike Training Club</a>, which has similar classes you can follow along with from home. Check with your university's student center about what's available, too. Schools offer all kinds of wellness-focused resources, from fitness apps to on-campus recreational centers. In grad school, I taught spin classes in my university's rec center that were free for other students to attend—and, true to the research, I always noticed a little cognitive boost when I did it right before class. </p>\n            </article>\n    </div>\n<div>\n    <div>\n        <p><span>The Daily Newsletter</span>\n            <span>Ready to do everything better?</span>\n        </p>\n        <p><img src=\"https://lifehacker.com/images/team/Jordan.png\" alt=\"Jordan Calhoun portrait\" />\n            <span>Jordan Calhoun\n            </span>\n            <span>Editor in chief</span>\n        </p>\n        <p><span><span>Get daily tips, tricks, <span>and tech guides</span></span> <span>from Jordan and the team.</span></span>\n    </p></div>\n    <div>\n        <p><span>The Daily Newsletter</span>\n            <span><span>Ready to do everything better?</span> <span>Get daily tips, tricks, <span>and tech guides</span></span> <span>from Jordan and the team.</span></span>\n        </p>\n    </div>\n</div>\n    </div>\n            <div>\n                <p><span>\n                        Keep Scrolling for Next Article\n                    </span>\n                </p>\n            </div>\n        </div>\n    </div>"

But it turns out you don't need to suffer to see results: The Rally orbital massager, <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/health/rally-massage-gun-review?test_uuid=015ZvAUxXams0rnBpajhMg2&test_variant=A\" target=\"_blank\">which I have previously reviewed</a>, has completely changed my hard-ass approach to recovery.</p><p>Don't get me wrong—percussive massage guns have their place. They're powerful and effective at working out the deepest knots. But after months of inconsistent use, I realized something: I was avoiding my own recovery tool. The aggressive pounding felt like punishment rather than self-care, turning what should've been a daily wellness ritual into something I'd postpone until I was in serious pain.</p>\n<p>I'd skip sessions when I needed them most, only reaching for my massage gun when my muscles were screaming for attention. By then, I'd need that aggressive percussion just to make a dent in the tension I'd allowed to build up. During marathon training especially, I simply can't let this happen. That's where orbital massages come in.</p>\n<h2 id=\"why-rallys-gentler-recovery-changes-everything\">Why Rally's gentler recovery changes everything</h2><p>The Rally's orbital massage technology works differently than traditional percussive guns—instead of hammering muscles with rapid-fire pulses, picture the circular motion of a car buffer. Luckily, the motion is gentle enough that it feels more like a human touch, as opposed to turning me into a car getting buffed. </p><p>The Rally has taught me something crucial about sustainable self-care: I'm infinitely more likely to reach for a device that feels good to use, rather than one that hurts. It's a game-changer for consistency. With my old massage gun, I'd psyche myself out before sessions: \"<em>Do I really need this? Can I handle the intensity right now?\"</em> With the Rally, there's no mental barrier. I can use it while watching TV, during work breaks, or as part of my bedtime routine, without dreading the experience.</p><h2 id=\"building-up-when-you-need-to\">Building up when you need to</h2><p>Here's the best thing about the Rally: It can double as a percussive massager when you need more intensity. But now, instead of starting with the nuclear option, I work my way up to it. It's more comfortable and, I find, more effective: My muscles respond better to massage when they're already relaxed and have good blood flow. </p><p>I'll begin with the gentle orbital motion to warm up tissues and increase circulation, then switch to percussion mode if I encounter stubborn knots. I am far from anti-percussion massage—there are times when you need that deeper, more aggressive treatment, like after a particularly intense workout, when dealing with chronic knots, or for trigger point therapy. But now, those hurt-so-good instances are the exception, rather than the rule. </p><div>\n            <p><span>\n                What do you think so far?\n            </span>\n        </p></div>\n<p>The Rally's ability to switch between modes means I'm not locked into one approach. I have the gentleness for daily maintenance and the power for when things get serious.</p><h2 id=\"the-best-recovery-tool-is-the-one-you-actually-use\">The best recovery tool is the one you actually use</h2><p>By embracing the gentler, orbital massage as my daily default, I've created a sustainable self-care routine that prevents problems rather than just treating them. Proactive care beats reactive treatment every time.</p><p>Maybe my muscles are thanking me not because I'm punishing them less, but because I'm caring for them more consistently. Sometimes the revolutionary approach is simply being kinder to yourself, and having the tools that make that kindness effective. </p><p>If you've been avoiding your massage gun or find yourself using it only when you're already in pain, consider making the switch to orbital massage as your primary recovery method. Your future self (and your muscles) will thank you for choosing consistency over intensity.</p>\n            </article>"

source</a></em><em>.</em></p><hr /><p>On Tuesday, Apple dropped <a href=\"https://www.cnet.com/tech/services-and-software/apple-releases-first-ios-26-1-beta-with-some-subtle-iphone-changes/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"open in a new window\">the first beta for iOS 26.1</a>. With it, we can see what the company is planning for <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/tech/settings-to-change-after-installing-ios-26\" target=\"_blank\">the successor to iOS 26</a>, including new gestures in Apple Music, a new scrubbing bar for the video player, and Liquid Glass support for the keypad in the Phone app. It's a small update on the surface, but there's something quite interesting going on behind the scenes. </p><h2 id=\"notification-forwarding\">'Notification Forwarding'</h2><p><a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2917201/ios-26-1-beta-suggests-the-iphone-will-soon-support-third-party-smartwatches.html\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"open in a new window\">As discovered by Macworld</a>, code within the iOS 26.1 beta suggests that Apple is working on support for third-party smartwatches in future versions of iOS. Macworld found references to a new feature called \"Notification Forwarding,\" which supposedly would allows users to direct alerts from their iPhone to a device not made by Apple. It's a bit vague, as that could mean anything from a tablet to a PC, but Macworld believes it is intended to support notification forwarding to non-Apple smartwatches.</p><div>\n        <p><img src=\"https://lifehacker.com/images/short-lifehacker-logo.jpg\" alt=\"Lifehacker Logo\" /></p><div>\n            <p><span>You May Also Like</span></p>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n<p>The code also seems to indicate that this feature supports notification forwarding to one device at a time. If you were to set your notifications from your iPhone to a Galaxy Watch, for example, it might disable notifications to your Apple Watch. In addition, there are references to an unfinished feature called \"AccessoryExtension,\" which might support pairing third-party watches to your iPhone. </p><p>Notification Forwarding and AccessoryExtension could be indicative of a big change for Apple. One of the things that makes the company so successful is its \"ecosystem,\" the idea that Apple's products are designed to work seamlessly together. If you have an iPhone, it connects to and works with iPads, Macs, and, of course, Apple Watches. When you try to connect to and work with third-party devices, however, you run into road blocks. </p><p>Smartwatches might be among the biggest hurdles here. Apple's smartwatch, of course, does everything you'd expect a smartwatch to do with your smartphone. But if you're thinking of picking up a Pixel Watch or Galaxy Watch, it's a different story. In fact, there's really no way to pair one of these to your iPhone. If you're coming from Android and you try to use your Pixel Watch with your iPhone, you're going to have a bad time. \"Notification Forwarding\" could offer a bridge.</p><div>\n            <p><span>\n                What do you think so far?\n            </span>\n        </p></div>\n<p>Some smartwatches, like those from Garmin, do offer notification forwarding support already, so the feature wouldn't necessarily be groundbreaking. But it could expand smartwatch options for users beyond the limited devices that currently work with iOS' notifications. </p><h2 id=\"two-reasons-you-might-not-see-these-changes-on-your-iphone\">Two reasons you might not see these changes on your iPhone</h2><p>Before you get too excited, there are a couple of caveats here. First, these changes are not an active part of iOS 26.1; rather, they are simply references within the code. That indicates this is something Apple is working on, but not necessarily something that will definitely launch. Until we see the features appear in a future beta update, it's possible this will simply remain an experiment. </p><p>And even if Apple does roll out these changes, it might only be to a select group of users. There's a chance third-party smartwatch support is solely targeted towards the EU, following the union's <a href=\"https://mashable.com/article/apple-dma-eu-connectivity-interoperability-proceedings\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"open in a new window\">Digital Markets Act</a>. That legislation requires Apple to open up iOS to third-party devices, which, notably, includes smartwatches. Apple doesn't tend to open up when it doesn't have to, which is why the EU has third-party app stores on iOS and the rest of the world does not. We could see yet another EU-specific feature in this case: Europeans might be able to use their Android watches with iOS, while the rest of us are stuck with Apple Watches. </p>\n            </article>\n    </div>\n<div>\n    <div>\n        <p><span>The Download Newsletter</span>\n            <span>Never miss a tech story</span>\n        </p>\n        <p><img src=\"https://lifehacker.com/images/team/Jake.png\" alt=\"Jake Peterson portrait\" />\n            <span>Jake Peterson\n            </span>\n            <span>Senior tech editor</span>\n        </p>\n        <p><span>Get the latest tech news, <span></span>reviews, <span></span>and advice from Jake and the team.</span>\n    </p></div>\n    <div>\n        <p><span>The Download Newsletter</span>\n            <span><span>Never miss a tech story.</span> Get the latest tech news, <span></span>reviews, <span></span>and advice from Jake and the team.</span>\n        </p>\n    </div>\n</div>\n    </div>\n            <div>\n                <p><span>\n                        Keep Scrolling for Next Article\n                    </span>\n                </p>\n            </div>\n        </div>\n    </div>"
