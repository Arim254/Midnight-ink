The new \"<a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/tech/how-to-undo-iphone-ios-26-liquid-glass\" target=\"_blank\">Liquid Glass</a>\" design, while controversial, offers the first major UI overhaul since iOS 7, while <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/tech/the-best-five-ios-26-features\" target=\"_blank\">new features</a> like call screening and hold assist might change the way your make and receive phone calls. </p><p>If you have an iPhone, you may be tempted to install the new update—and, seeing as it has been out for a week and a half now, you might have updated already. If you haven't installed iOS 26, yet, however, think twice before you do, because you're going to be stuck with it: Apple has made it impossible to downgrade and return to iOS 18.</p><h2 id=\"you-cant-go-back-to-ios-18\">You can't go back to iOS 18</h2><p><a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/09/22/apple-stops-signing-ios-18-6-2/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"open in a new window\">As reported by MacRumors</a>, Apple stopped \"signing\" iOS 18.6.2 on Monday. When Apple signs a particular piece of software, it means you can download that software to your compatible device. Apple stops signing software shortly after it releases a new version. It's a system meant to block users from installing old software versions on their Apple devices, intended to protect those users from insecurities in operating systems that haven't been patched.</p><div>\n        <p><img src=\"https://lifehacker.com/images/short-lifehacker-logo.jpg\" alt=\"Lifehacker Logo\" /></p><div>\n            <p><span>You May Also Like</span></p>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n<p>As such, now that iOS 18.6.2 is no longer being signed, there is no way to downgrade to that software version from iOS 26 if you change your mind. Though the process was tedious, previously, <a href=\"https://x.com/badboychadhoy/status/1970549101973418116\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"open in a new window\">you could downgrade from iOS 26</a> by putting your iPhone in recovery mode, erasing it completely, and installing a new version of 18.6.2. Now that Apple has stopped signing 18.6.2, however, there's no way to install it, so a factory reset will only leave you with an iPhone running iOS 26, and none of your data.</p><div>\n            <p><span>\n                What do you think so far?\n            </span>\n        </p></div>\n<p>You might be wondering why you can't downgrade to iOS 18.7, since that's a newer version of iOS 18 than 18.6.2. <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-stops-signing-ios-18-6-2-ios-26-downgrades-now-impossible.2467148/post-34169189\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"open in a new window\">As users on the MacRumors forum point out</a>, you need an IPSW file in order to downgrade your iPhone, but Apple hasn't provided an IPSW file with iOS 18.7, as that update is only available over the air for uses already running iOS 18. That is to say: Unless your iPhone is already running 18.6.2, you can't install iOS 18.7.  </p><p>If you haven't updated your iPhone yet, you have two options. First, there's nothing<em> forcing </em>you to install iOS 26 on your device. You can keep running iOS 18.6.2 or iOS 18.7 as long as you want, and take advantage of any future security updates Apple provides to keep your iPhone protected. Alternately, you can go ahead and install iOS 26, with the understanding that you won't have the option to undo it—<a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/tech/how-to-undo-iphone-ios-26-liquid-glass\" target=\"_blank\">though you will be able to undo many of the UI changes</a>, at least. And if your main concern is performance and <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/tech/extend-iphone-air-battery-life\" target=\"_blank\">battery life</a>, it might be smart to wait for iOS 26.1, which is currently in beta testing. </p>\n            </article>\n    </div>\n<div>\n    <div>\n        <p><span>The Download Newsletter</span>\n            <span>Never miss a tech story</span>\n        </p>\n        <p><img src=\"https://lifehacker.com/images/team/Jake.png\" alt=\"Jake Peterson portrait\" />\n            <span>Jake Peterson\n            </span>\n            <span>Senior tech editor</span>\n        </p>\n        <p><span>Get the latest tech news, <span></span>reviews, <span></span>and advice from Jake and the team.</span>\n    </p></div>\n    <div>\n        <p><span>The Download Newsletter</span>\n            <span><span>Never miss a tech story.</span> Get the latest tech news, <span></span>reviews, <span></span>and advice from Jake and the team.</span>\n        </p>\n    </div>\n</div>\n    </div>\n            <div>\n                <p><span>\n                        Keep Scrolling for Next Article\n                    </span>\n                </p>\n            </div>\n        </div>"

source</a></em><em>.</em></p><hr /><p>On Tuesday, Apple dropped <a href=\"https://www.cnet.com/tech/services-and-software/apple-releases-first-ios-26-1-beta-with-some-subtle-iphone-changes/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"open in a new window\">the first beta for iOS 26.1</a>. With it, we can see what the company is planning for <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/tech/settings-to-change-after-installing-ios-26\" target=\"_blank\">the successor to iOS 26</a>, including new gestures in Apple Music, a new scrubbing bar for the video player, and Liquid Glass support for the keypad in the Phone app. It's a small update on the surface, but there's something quite interesting going on behind the scenes. </p><h2 id=\"notification-forwarding\">'Notification Forwarding'</h2><p><a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2917201/ios-26-1-beta-suggests-the-iphone-will-soon-support-third-party-smartwatches.html\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"open in a new window\">As discovered by Macworld</a>, code within the iOS 26.1 beta suggests that Apple is working on support for third-party smartwatches in future versions of iOS. Macworld found references to a new feature called \"Notification Forwarding,\" which supposedly would allows users to direct alerts from their iPhone to a device not made by Apple. It's a bit vague, as that could mean anything from a tablet to a PC, but Macworld believes it is intended to support notification forwarding to non-Apple smartwatches.</p><div>\n        <p><img src=\"https://lifehacker.com/images/short-lifehacker-logo.jpg\" alt=\"Lifehacker Logo\" /></p><div>\n            <p><span>You May Also Like</span></p>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n<p>The code also seems to indicate that this feature supports notification forwarding to one device at a time. If you were to set your notifications from your iPhone to a Galaxy Watch, for example, it might disable notifications to your Apple Watch. In addition, there are references to an unfinished feature called \"AccessoryExtension,\" which might support pairing third-party watches to your iPhone. </p><p>Notification Forwarding and AccessoryExtension could be indicative of a big change for Apple. One of the things that makes the company so successful is its \"ecosystem,\" the idea that Apple's products are designed to work seamlessly together. If you have an iPhone, it connects to and works with iPads, Macs, and, of course, Apple Watches. When you try to connect to and work with third-party devices, however, you run into road blocks. </p><p>Smartwatches might be among the biggest hurdles here. Apple's smartwatch, of course, does everything you'd expect a smartwatch to do with your smartphone. But if you're thinking of picking up a Pixel Watch or Galaxy Watch, it's a different story. In fact, there's really no way to pair one of these to your iPhone. If you're coming from Android and you try to use your Pixel Watch with your iPhone, you're going to have a bad time. \"Notification Forwarding\" could offer a bridge.</p><div>\n            <p><span>\n                What do you think so far?\n            </span>\n        </p></div>\n<p>Some smartwatches, like those from Garmin, do offer notification forwarding support already, so the feature wouldn't necessarily be groundbreaking. But it could expand smartwatch options for users beyond the limited devices that currently work with iOS' notifications. </p><h2 id=\"two-reasons-you-might-not-see-these-changes-on-your-iphone\">Two reasons you might not see these changes on your iPhone</h2><p>Before you get too excited, there are a couple of caveats here. First, these changes are not an active part of iOS 26.1; rather, they are simply references within the code. That indicates this is something Apple is working on, but not necessarily something that will definitely launch. Until we see the features appear in a future beta update, it's possible this will simply remain an experiment. </p><p>And even if Apple does roll out these changes, it might only be to a select group of users. There's a chance third-party smartwatch support is solely targeted towards the EU, following the union's <a href=\"https://mashable.com/article/apple-dma-eu-connectivity-interoperability-proceedings\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"open in a new window\">Digital Markets Act</a>. That legislation requires Apple to open up iOS to third-party devices, which, notably, includes smartwatches. Apple doesn't tend to open up when it doesn't have to, which is why the EU has third-party app stores on iOS and the rest of the world does not. We could see yet another EU-specific feature in this case: Europeans might be able to use their Android watches with iOS, while the rest of us are stuck with Apple Watches. </p>\n            </article>\n    </div>\n<div>\n    <div>\n        <p><span>The Download Newsletter</span>\n            <span>Never miss a tech story</span>\n        </p>\n        <p><img src=\"https://lifehacker.com/images/team/Jake.png\" alt=\"Jake Peterson portrait\" />\n            <span>Jake Peterson\n            </span>\n            <span>Senior tech editor</span>\n        </p>\n        <p><span>Get the latest tech news, <span></span>reviews, <span></span>and advice from Jake and the team.</span>\n    </p></div>\n    <div>\n        <p><span>The Download Newsletter</span>\n            <span><span>Never miss a tech story.</span> Get the latest tech news, <span></span>reviews, <span></span>and advice from Jake and the team.</span>\n        </p>\n    </div>\n</div>\n    </div>\n            <div>\n                <p><span>\n                        Keep Scrolling for Next Article\n                    </span>\n                </p>\n            </div>\n        </div>\n    </div>"

As of Monday, iOS 26.1 is officially in beta testing, which means developers and public testers can try out Apple's next update early. </p><p>\"Point updates\" like iOS 26.1 are never as feature-filled as the main releases, though 26.1 seems particularly small in scope. Apple seems to have done most of what it planned to do with iOS 26, saving just smaller changes for this upcoming update. Still, there are some interesting new additions in this latest beta, and more could come in subsequent releases. Here's what's new.</p><div>\n        <p><img src=\"https://lifehacker.com/images/short-lifehacker-logo.jpg\" alt=\"Lifehacker Logo\" /></p><div>\n            <p><span>You May Also Like</span></p>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n<h2 id=\"apple-music-gestures\">Apple Music gestures</h2><p>If you want to skip a song in Apple Music, you hit the forward button. If you want to get back to the previous song, or restart the current song, you hit the back button. With iOS 26.1, however, you'll have the option to swipe to switch between songs. </p><p>In the current beta, you can swipe right and left on the Now Playing bar to switch back and forth through your queue. With it, Apple has removed the skip forward button from the Now Playing bar. (The back button wasn't present.) It's a small but cool feature, but one that might take a little time to get used to.</p><blockquote>\n    <a href=\"https://twitter.com/BetaProfiles/status/1970499981493833985\" title=\"open in a new window\" target=\"_blank\">\n        This Tweet is currently unavailable. It might be loading or has been removed.\n    </a>\n</blockquote>\n<h2 id=\"video-playback-bar\">Video playback bar</h2><p>In the current version of iOS 26, the video playback bar in the Photos app is flush with the UI. You might love or hate it, but it can be a bit difficult to make it out, depending on the video in question. The play button and mute button, for example, can disappear when iOS can't change their colors to stand out from the background. </p><p>iOS 26.1 beta 1, however, introduces a new video playback bar that is separate from the UI. It looks good, and is easy to see at all times. Again, a small change, but a smart one.</p><blockquote>\n    <a href=\"https://twitter.com/BetaProfiles/status/1970204922751971838\" title=\"open in a new window\" target=\"_blank\">\n        This Tweet is currently unavailable.

So long as you have an iPhone 15 Pro or newer, as well as AirPods Pro 2, AirPods Pro 3, or AirPods 5 with Active Noise Cancellation, you've been able to try it out since iOS 26's launch.  </p><p>Apple initially rolled out support for French, German, Portuguese (Brazil), and Spanish (Spain), but plans to expand the list in the future. With iOS 26.1, it adds four new options, including:</p><ul><li><p>Chinese (Mandarin, simplified)</p></li><li><p>Chinese (Mandarin, traditional)</p></li><li><p>Italian</p></li><li><p>Japanese</p></li><li><p>Korean</p></li></ul><h2 id=\"eight-new-languages-for-apple-intelligence\">Eight new languages for Apple Intelligence</h2><p>Users with an iPhone 15 Pro and newer, listen up: Apple Intelligence supports eight new languages in iOS 26.1. As of this first beta, that includes the following: </p><div>\n            <p><span>\n                What do you think so far?\n            </span>\n        </p></div>\n<ul><li><p>Chinese (traditional)</p></li><li><p>Danish</p></li><li><p>Dutch</p></li><li><p>Norwegian</p></li><li><p>Portuguese (Portugal)</p></li><li><p>Swedish</p></li><li><p>Turkish</p></li><li><p>Vietnamese</p></li></ul><h2 id=\"liquid-glass-comes-to-the-phones-keypad\">Liquid Glass comes to the Phone's keypad</h2><p><a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/tech/how-to-undo-iphone-ios-26-liquid-glass\" target=\"_blank\">Liquid Glass</a>, Apple's new design language, isn't <em>everywhere </em>in iOS 26. While much of the UI now has a glassy look, some elements still look like iOS 18 and earlier. The Phone app's keypad was one such example: While the app itself is <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/tech/ios-26-missed-call-reminders\" target=\"_blank\">very much changed</a> with this update, switch to the keypad, and it looks the same as ever. </p><p>That changes with iOS 26.1. The beta brings Liquid Glass to the keypad, which, while consistent with most of iOS 26's design, does reduce the visibility of the keys a bit, especially in light mode. I wouldn't be surprised to see Apple workshop this one a bit. </p><blockquote>\n    <a href=\"https://twitter.com/BetaProfiles/status/1970197002941321667\" title=\"open in a new window\" target=\"_blank\">\n        This Tweet is currently unavailable.

Some watches offer notification support, but most simply don't jive well with iOS. </p><p>That might be changing in the future. <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/tech/apple-might-support-third-party-smartwatches\" target=\"_blank\">Code within the iOS 26.1 beta</a> references a new \"Notification Forwarding\" feature, that might allow you to choose a third-party device to send your iPhone alerts to. In addition, an unfinished \"AccessoryExtension\" option might be the framework that lets you pair a third-party watch to your iPhone.</p><p>These are just references in code, not something that you can actively test out in the 26.1 beta, but it's worth noting. Apple is experimenting with supporting third-party watches on iOS, though it could just be to appease the EU's \"Digital Markets Act.\"  </p>\n            </article>\n    </div>\n<div>\n    <div>\n        <p><span>The Download Newsletter</span>\n            <span>Never miss a tech story</span>\n        </p>\n        <p><img src=\"https://lifehacker.com/images/team/Jake.png\" alt=\"Jake Peterson portrait\" />\n            <span>Jake Peterson\n            </span>\n            <span>Senior tech editor</span>\n        </p>\n        <p><span>Get the latest tech news, <span></span>reviews, <span></span>and advice from Jake and the team.</span>\n    </p></div>\n    <div>\n        <p><span>The Download Newsletter</span>\n            <span><span>Never miss a tech story.</span> Get the latest tech news, <span></span>reviews, <span></span>and advice from Jake and the team.</span>\n        </p>\n    </div>\n</div>\n    </div>\n            <div>\n                <p><span>\n                        Keep Scrolling for Next Article\n                    </span>\n                </p>\n            </div>\n        </div>\n    </div>"

/><p>Before you sit down to study or get started on a big project for work, you might want to consider hitting the gym or taking a brisk walk. Besides just generally being good for your health, research also shows it can actually help with cognition. And with, say, the start of a new semester bearing down upon you or a work deadline looming, anything that can give you a brain boost is likely welcome. </p><h2 id=\"what-the-research-says-about-exercise-and-studying\">What the research says about exercise and studying</h2><p>There’s no shortage of solid, peer-reviewed research on the effect of exercise on cognition, going back <a href=\"https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Phillip-Tomporowski/publication/10893216_Effects_of_acute_bouts_of_exercise_on_cognition/links/5d9b7b95a6fdccfd0e81034e/Effects-of-acute-bouts-of-exercise-on-cognition.pdf?_sg%5B0%5D=started_experiment_milestone&origin=journalDetail&_rtd=e30%3D\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"open in a new window\">decades</a>. There's just a shortage on explanations. The exact reasons that exercise helps thinking aren’t fully understood, but <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5934999/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"open in a new window\">one 2018 review in <em>Frontiers in Psychology</em></a> discusses evidence that it may increase blood flow to the brain, boost levels of certain neurotransmitters, and increase your feelings of control and self-esteem. Purely anecdotally, I think that's true. When I leave the gym in the morning, I feel like I've already accomplished something and tend to be a little more of a go-getter at work, riding my smug little wave to continue the day's productive streak. </p><div>\n        <p><img src=\"https://lifehacker.com/images/short-lifehacker-logo.jpg\" alt=\"Lifehacker Logo\" /></p><div>\n            <p><span>You May Also Like</span></p>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3951958/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"open in a new window\">Another review</a>, from 2013, notes that “more active” individuals are better able to pay attention to their surroundings and process information more quickly. Exercise may even change our brains for the long term; the 2018 review concluded that “chronic aerobic exercise is associated with potent structural and functional neuroplastic changes, with an improvement in cognitive functions.”</p><h2 id=\"what-exercises-work-best-for-your-brain\">What exercises work best for your brain?</h2><p>The research is pro-exercise in all forms, but especially hones in on acute aerobic exercise—or the kind of exercise where you’re moving around a lot and your heart rate is up. A “single bout” of this kind of movement is related to improved cognitive functions, according to the researchers in <em>Frontiers</em>.</p><div>\n            <p><span>\n                What do you think so far?\n            </span>\n        </p></div>\n<p>So, before you sit down to study, plan your week, or have an important conversation with your boss, consider swimming, biking, jogging, running, hopping on the elliptical, or taking a brisk walk around the block. You want to get in some solid cardio here, even if it is as simple as biking to work or taking your lunch break at the gym. (<a href=\"https://www.lifehacker.com/how-much-exercise-do-i-really-need-1823708126\" target=\"_blank\">Here’s a guide to how much exercise you need</a> each week, in general.)</p><h2 id=\"how-to-make-time-to-work-out\">How to make time to work out</h2><p>I know it's hard to find time to work out, especially if you're a stressed-out student—but that makes it all the more important you do carve out some time for taking care of your body, regardless of the effect it has on your mind. Taking into account that it could make you a <em>better</em> student, it practically becomes non-negotiable. </p><p>If getting to the gym, the bike path, or the rec center truly isn't feasible, there is plenty you can do from the comfort of home or your dorm room. Since we're looking to get the heart rate up here, focus on cardio, to the extent possible in your space. <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/health/the-best-free-cardio-workout-channels-on-youtube\" target=\"_blank\">YouTube is full of great follow-along workout videos</a> that can get blood pumping, for instance. I'd also recommend having a designated workout app to guide you. I'm <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/health/peloton-app-review\" target=\"_blank\">partial to Peloton's app</a>, but while that app has all kinds of class types from <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/health/peloton-class-with-no-peloton-bike\" target=\"_blank\">cycling</a> to <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/health/peloton-guided-walk-workouts-recommendation\" target=\"_blank\">walking</a> to <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/health/pelotons-yoga-offerings-are-surprisingly-robust\" target=\"_blank\">yoga</a>, it can also cost up to $44 a month, making it a little difficult to maintain for a student. As a free alternative, you can try <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/health/nike-training-club-app-review\" target=\"_blank\">Nike Training Club</a>, which has similar classes you can follow along with from home. Check with your university's student center about what's available, too. Schools offer all kinds of wellness-focused resources, from fitness apps to on-campus recreational centers. In grad school, I taught spin classes in my university's rec center that were free for other students to attend—and, true to the research, I always noticed a little cognitive boost when I did it right before class. </p>\n            </article>\n    </div>\n<div>\n    <div>\n        <p><span>The Daily Newsletter</span>\n            <span>Ready to do everything better?</span>\n        </p>\n        <p><img src=\"https://lifehacker.com/images/team/Jordan.png\" alt=\"Jordan Calhoun portrait\" />\n            <span>Jordan Calhoun\n            </span>\n            <span>Editor in chief</span>\n        </p>\n        <p><span><span>Get daily tips, tricks, <span>and tech guides</span></span> <span>from Jordan and the team.</span></span>\n    </p></div>\n    <div>\n        <p><span>The Daily Newsletter</span>\n            <span><span>Ready to do everything better?</span> <span>Get daily tips, tricks, <span>and tech guides</span></span> <span>from Jordan and the team.</span></span>\n        </p>\n    </div>\n</div>\n    </div>\n            <div>\n                <p><span>\n                        Keep Scrolling for Next Article\n                    </span>\n                </p>\n            </div>\n        </div>\n    </div>"

href=\"https://lifehacker.com/health/seven-changes-that-helped-me-stick-to-my-home-fitness-routine\" target=\"_blank\">ever-expanding quest to get better at working out</a> at home. I wanted to put it into action right away, so naturally, I turned to my <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/health/peloton-app-review\" target=\"_blank\">beloved Peloton app</a>, where I figured I'd load up a Pilates workout and get to work. Weirdly, though, that wasn't as easy as it is when I, say, want to follow along with a <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/health/pelotons-yoga-offerings-are-surprisingly-robust\" target=\"_blank\">yoga</a> or <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/health/peloton-stretching-classes-are-helping-me-do-the-splits\" target=\"_blank\">stretching</a> class. Eventually, I figured it out and the Pilates workout (which did incorporate my hoop, thank you very much) was great—and challenging, which is how I like it.</p><h2 id=\"where-to-locate-pilates-classes-on-the-peloton-app\">Where to locate Pilates classes on the Peloton app</h2><p>I knew Peloton had Pilates classes. But when I opened up the app, there was no designated Pilates button the way there are buttons for <strong>Meditation</strong> and <strong>Cycling</strong>. I typed \"Pilates\" into the search bar at the top of the mobile app and it brought up 95 class results, some of which were actually categorized as yoga and others which were listed under strength. </p><div>\n        <p><img src=\"https://lifehacker.com/images/short-lifehacker-logo.jpg\" alt=\"Lifehacker Logo\" /></p><div>\n            <p><span>You May Also Like</span></p>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n<p>So, there <em>are</em> Pilates classes, but they're listed on different landing pages. Across the top of the search results page, you see <strong>Classes</strong>, <strong>Collections</strong>, <strong>Programs</strong>, and <strong>Music Artists</strong>. Tapping <strong>Collections</strong> yields a landing page called \"Pilates with Equipment,\" which has subcategories: Pilates with a Ball, Pilates with Sliders, Pilates with a Band, and—crucially, for me—Pilates with a Ring. There are only a handful of classes in each and they're all technically filed as \"strength classes\" in Peloton's system. I selected \"15 min Pilates\" from the section that incorporates the magic circle. </p><p>Things got harder from there. I wanted to play the class on my TV, which is possible because Peloton has an app on the Roku, but there is no search function on the Roku app. Instead, you have to look through the categories to find a class—which I couldn't do, since there is no Pilates category. I ended up getting the one I wanted by adding it to <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/health/how-to-stack-peloton-classes\" target=\"_blank\">my Peloton Stack</a>, which is like a personal class playlist; deleting everything else from the Stack; and running the Stack on the Roku app. It wasn't efficient or ideal, but ultimately, it worked. </p><div>\n            <p><span>\n                What do you think so far?\n            </span>\n        </p></div>\n<h2 id=\"what-pelotons-pilates-classes-are-like\">What Peloton's Pilates classes are like </h2><p>As much trouble as I had actually finding a class, I hadn't even technically done the \"hard\" part yet. Pilates is supposed to be challenging, after all, and the intermediate-level class I took definitely was. Armed with my mat and my hoop I followed along with some standard moves, like \"hundreds\" and clam shells. It was difficult, but not impossible, which is exactly what I was looking for. </p><p>Again, there are only 95 of these types of classes available and some are more about stretching while others are more strength-focused. That's a small selection compared to how many other types of classes Peloton offers. But what <em>is</em> available is solid. The instruction is clear and precise, modifications are offered, and the audio/video quality is top-tier, making it easy to hear and see what you're supposed to be doing. </p><p>I did the Peloton class last night and took an in-studio reformer class this morning. Granted, my in-person class was four times longer than the one I did from Peloton, but I'd say that adjusted for time, they were both equal in challenge. Because I am now the proud owner of a hoop <em>and </em>the knowledge of how to find high-quality, expert-led Pilates classes to play through Peloton, I'll certainly be doing more of these. Here's hoping we get a dedicated Pilates page on the Peloton app soon.</p>\n            </article>\n    </div>\n<div>\n    <div>\n        <p><span>The Daily Newsletter</span>\n            <span>Ready to do everything better?</span>\n        </p>\n        <p><img src=\"https://lifehacker.com/images/team/Jordan.png\" alt=\"Jordan Calhoun portrait\" />\n            <span>Jordan Calhoun\n            </span>\n            <span>Editor in chief</span>\n        </p>\n        <p><span><span>Get daily tips, tricks, <span>and tech guides</span></span> <span>from Jordan and the team.</span></span>\n    </p></div>\n    <div>\n        <p><span>The Daily Newsletter</span>\n            <span><span>Ready to do everything better?</span> <span>Get daily tips, tricks, <span>and tech guides</span></span> <span>from Jordan and the team.</span></span>\n        </p>\n    </div>\n</div>\n    </div>\n            <div>\n                <p><span>\n                        Keep Scrolling for Next Article\n                    </span>\n                </p>\n            </div>\n        </div>\n    </div>"
