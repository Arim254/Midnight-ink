To that point, with <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/tech/the-best-five-ios-26-features\" target=\"_blank\">iOS 26</a>, both the iPhone and the iPad get a new app that was a Mac exclusive for over 20 years: Preview. </p><h2 id=\"what-can-you-do-with-the-preview-app\">What can you do with the Preview app?</h2><p>Like on macOS, the Preview app for iOS and iPadOS is largely made for viewing PDFs and other documents. When you first open the app, you'll see the options to either create a new document or scan one with your iPhone's camera. </p><p>Most of the time, however, you probably you have an existing document you want to open using Preview. If so, you'll find those options in the bottom half of this starting page. This is Preview's integration with the Files app: You can browse your documents from Files and open any with Preview.</p><div>\n        <p><img src=\"https://lifehacker.com/images/short-lifehacker-logo.jpg\" alt=\"Lifehacker Logo\" /></p><div>\n            <p><span>You May Also Like</span></p>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n<p>Once you have a document loaded up, you're able to view, annotate, markup, and edit it. If you need to fill out a document with your information, you can use AutoFill to automatically enter contact info and other saved details. You can add your signature, and if you're on your iPad, you can use your Apple Pencil to draw on the document. Otherwise, you can use your finger to mark up the file. </p><p>You can also export documents from the Preview app. You can work with file types including HEIDC, JPEG, PDF, PNG, and TIFF. And as with Preview on macOS, there are a number of controls when exporting, such as resolution, embedding text, and saving images as JPEG.</p><p>While there's a lot you can do here, the biggest strength I see for this mobile Preview app is using it as a tool for legal documents. If you need to sign an important document, you can quickly scan it into the app, add your signature, fill out any information—perhaps automatically with AutoFill—then email the doc out, all without needing to jump to your computer.</p><h2 id=\"preview-on-ios-is-still-a-work-in-progress\">Preview on iOS is still a work in progress</h2><p>If you look at <a href=\"https://apps.apple.com/us/app/preview/id536344167?platform=iphone\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"open in a new window\">Preview's App Store page</a>, you'll notice some mixed reviews. After using the app for a bit, I understand why. Preview for iOS is definitely still a work in progress and in need of some key upgrades.</p><div>\n            <p><span>\n                What do you think so far?\n            </span>\n        </p></div>\n<p>The biggest quirks I noticed immediately: The main menu page is cluttered, with the Files integration looking more like a glitch than a dedicated window. Speaking of Files, Apple made the decision to have documents in Files open in Preview. At first, that sounds like a good idea, until you experience it in person on both iOS and iPadOS. Being dragged out of the Files app when you're not expecting it is jarring, especially when you're used to viewing your docs directly in the app. </p><p>The workaround here is to avoid Files for opening, well, files. Use the Files integration within Preview, so you stay in the same app. How intuitive. You could also choose to delete the Preview app, but that's a bit of a shame when it's such a major update for iOS and iPadOS 26.</p><p>Also, when you choose the Markup option, there's no clear way to exit without closing the whole app first. As far as I can tell, the only way to do so is to tap the three-dots in the top right, then tap Markup to exit this menu. The Markup button should really stay on screen as it does on macOS, so it's obvious how to dismiss it.    </p>\n            </article>\n    </div>\n<div>\n    <div>\n        <p><span>The Download Newsletter</span>\n            <span>Never miss a tech story</span>\n        </p>\n        <p><img src=\"https://lifehacker.com/images/team/Jake.png\" alt=\"Jake Peterson portrait\" />\n            <span>Jake Peterson\n            </span>\n            <span>Senior tech editor</span>\n        </p>\n        <p><span>Get the latest tech news, <span></span>reviews, <span></span>and advice from Jake and the team.</span>\n    </p></div>\n    <div>\n        <p><span>The Download Newsletter</span>\n            <span><span>Never miss a tech story.</span> Get the latest tech news, <span></span>reviews, <span></span>and advice from Jake and the team.</span>\n        </p>\n    </div>\n</div>\n    </div>\n            <div>\n                <p><span>\n                        Keep Scrolling for Next Article\n                    </span>\n                </p>\n            </div>\n        </div>"

/><p>Studying can be as easy as sitting down and reading a chapter, but it shouldn't be. I do hate to break that to you, though I'm actually doing you a favor. Just absorbing huge blocks of content isn't necessarily helpful for remembering any of it. Before you do the work of studying, you have to get organized by sorting the content you need to absorb. Even organizing it, especially using the \"chunking\" method, will help you start to grasp and retain the materials, so by the time you're going through them, you'll be in a perfect position to lodge all that information in your memory. Chunking is a psychological trick that experts swear by. Here's how to master it for yourself.</p><h2 id=\"what-is-chunking\">What is chunking?</h2><p><a href=\"https://dictionary.apa.org/chunking\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"open in a new window\">Here’s what the American Psychological Association says</a>: Chunking is “the process by which the mind divides large pieces of information into smaller units (chunks) that are easier to retain in short-term memory. As a result of this recoding, one item in memory (e.g., a keyword or key idea) can stand for multiple other items (e.g., a short list of associated points).”</p><div>\n        <p><img src=\"https://lifehacker.com/images/short-lifehacker-logo.jpg\" alt=\"Lifehacker Logo\" /></p><div>\n            <p><span>You May Also Like</span></p>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n<p>Basically, your short-term memory has a specific capacity for how many units it can store and that capacity is pretty low, ranging from five to nine—but the units themselves can be as complex as you want. The APA says “the exact number of chunks remembered depends on the size of each chunk or the subunits contained within each chunk.”</p><p>Each chunk is a collection of pieces of related information, like words, numbers, or phrases. The key here is they have to be related to each other, but <em>not</em> very related to the other chunks. Chunking is all about grouping related pieces of information so you can stay in that five-to-nine units frame.</p><p>You probably already use chunking in your real life to remember things. Think of your phone number. You likely already sort it into your area code, those first three digits, and the final four digits. Remembering a string of 10 numbers is hard; remembering three “chunks” of smaller digits is less difficult.</p><h2 id=\"so-how-do-you-study-in-chunks\">So how do you study in chunks?</h2><p>Look at the things you have to memorize and start grouping them loosely into categories based on how they’re related. This doesn’t have to be about <em>content</em>, either. If you have to memorize 20 words or concepts, you don’t have to group them by their meaning; you can group them by whether they sound similar, start with the same letter, or whatever you want. If you've ever <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/the-best-ways-to-use-association-to-remember-what-you-1850861942\" target=\"_blank\">used a mnemonic device</a> to remember something like, say, the order of the planets, you've already made a \"chunk\" to study before. </p><div>\n            <p><span>\n                What do you think so far?\n            </span>\n        </p></div>\n<p>You can create your chunks with something as simple as a pencil and paper, listing the words or concepts together and skipping a few spaces between units. From here, you can make flashcard sets of each chunk or use the first letter of each phrase to create a mnemonic device. Try an acrostic, a phrase where the first letter of each word corresponds with the first letter of one of the things you need to remember. If you think better in terms of numbers, try grouping your words or concepts by how many letters are in them. </p><p>The pencil-and-paper technique is helpful for entrenching words in your memory, since <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/dont-use-laptop-to-take-notes-in-class\" target=\"_blank\">you retain things you write down</a> a little better than those you type, but it's not that convenient or functional otherwise. I recommend using apps and digital programs to make this easier. For instance, use a mind-mapping app to sort out your chunks and make them easy to visualize. I always find that even seeing words grouped together and organized can help me remember them and the ways they relate to each other better. <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/tech/xmind-mind-mapping-app-review\" target=\"_blank\">Xmind is my favorite app for this</a>, but you can also use something like Canva, which I have absolutely done in a pinch. Next, you can even use an app to create your flashcards. <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/leitner-system-flashcard-studying\" target=\"_blank\">Flashcards are one of the best</a> and most time-tested methods for studying, but it's wildly unrealistic for you to carry a bunch of notecards around. <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/tech/best-flashcard-apps-for-studying\" target=\"_blank\">These are my five favorite flashcard apps</a>, which will enable you to keep all your study materials accessible on your phone wherever you are. </p><p>I recommend making a new deck for every chunk you create so you can keep your groups separate in your mind. Once you've grasped all the content of your various chunks, try mixing some of the decks together and reviewing them in bigger batches. <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/why-you-should-actually-study-multiple-topics-at-the-sa-1850438252\" target=\"_blank\">Known as interleaving</a>, this technique will gradually help you make connections between different concepts, enhancing not only your recall of them, but your actual understanding. </p><p>Just don't forget to start out by studying each set—or chunk—individually. Even though this doesn’t break down the amount of content, having them in groups with similar characteristics will help you remember it all together, and you’ll be surprised how much of the real material you retain. </p>\n            </article>\n    </div>\n<div>\n    <div>\n        <p><span>The Daily Newsletter</span>\n            <span>Ready to do everything better?</span>\n        </p>\n        <p><img src=\"https://lifehacker.com/images/team/Jordan.png\" alt=\"Jordan Calhoun portrait\" />\n            <span>Jordan Calhoun\n            </span>\n            <span>Editor in chief</span>\n        </p>\n        <p><span><span>Get daily tips, tricks, <span>and tech guides</span></span> <span>from Jordan and the team.</span></span>\n    </p></div>\n    <div>\n        <p><span>The Daily Newsletter</span>\n            <span><span>Ready to do everything better?</span> <span>Get daily tips, tricks, <span>and tech guides</span></span> <span>from Jordan and the team.</span></span>\n        </p>\n    </div>\n</div>\n    </div>\n            <div>\n                <p><span>\n                        Keep Scrolling for Next Article\n                    </span>\n                </p>\n            </div>\n        </div>\n    </div>"

By default, trackers steal a <em>lot</em> of your data while you browse the web, but simple settings can block a lot of those trackers from functioning. As it turns out, <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/tech/the-best-five-ios-26-features\" target=\"_blank\">by updating to iOS 26</a>, your iPhone gets an upgraded tool against tracking.</p><p>The feature, called Advanced Tracking and Fingerprinting Protection, is an option in Safari that hides certain browser and device data trackers typically use to build a <a href=\"https://www.cnet.com/tech/services-and-software/enable-this-ios-26-privacy-feature-to-make-it-harder-for-others-to-track-you/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"open in a new window\">digital \"fingerprint\" of users</a>. In this case, a fingerprint is a profile companies use to track your movements across the web. Your fingerprint may be made up of data like your device's IP address, the device itself, your browser, fonts, plug-ins, as well as its screen resolution. All of these data points come together to build a unique picture of who you are; the more unique your fingerprint, <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/tech/cover-your-tracks-see-whos-following-you-online\" target=\"_blank\">the easier it is to track you</a>, since the odds of someone else with your exact same details is slim. </p><div>\n        <p><img src=\"https://lifehacker.com/images/short-lifehacker-logo.jpg\" alt=\"Lifehacker Logo\" /></p><div>\n            <p><span>You May Also Like</span></p>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n<p>Fingerprinting has a number of applications across the web, but perhaps the largest is for targeted advertising. The reason many of the ads you see are so relevant to your interests and browsing history is because of fingerprinting. Trackers know your internet habits, and can identify and deliver the advertisements you're most likely to click or tap on. Companies can also sell these fingerprinting profiles to brokers and advertisers, making money on both your engagement with ads, as well as your raw data.  </p><p>Advanced Tracking and Fingerprinting Protection simplifies each Safari user's data, so our fingerprints aren't quite so unique. By doing so, it's harder for trackers to identify individuals, and, as such, makes it possible to browser the web more privately. </p><p>This feature was already a thing on iPhone before iOS 26. However, it was limited to Private Browsing by default. If you didn't do all your browsing in a private tab, you likely lost some of these privacy protections, unless you knew to manually change the setting to cover all browsing. The same goes for iPadOS and macOS as well. Most of us probably didn't change the setting, since it's quite buried in each OS' respective settings.</p><div>\n            <p><span>\n                What do you think so far?\n            </span>\n        </p></div>\n<p>Once you update your iPhone, iPad, or Mac to the latest OS, however, your browsing gets these added tracking protections by default.

As such, in order to interpret menus, signs, and packaging, I needed to translate the text back into English. While you might assume you need to use a specific translator app of choice to get this done, you really only need one thing: your iPhone's camera.</p><p>I, along with all of the people I traveled with, have an iPhone, so I assumed all of us knew about this trick. To my surprise, however, nobody in my party knew about this. So, I'm here to make sure your next international trip is a bit easier. </p><div>\n        <p><img src=\"https://lifehacker.com/images/short-lifehacker-logo.jpg\" alt=\"Lifehacker Logo\" /></p><div>\n            <p><span>You May Also Like</span></p>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n<h2 id=\"translate-text-with-your-iphones-camera\">Translate text with your iPhone's camera </h2><p>The next time you need to translate some text in front of you, instead of heading for Google Translate, Microsoft Translator, or even Apple's own Translate app, just open your Camera app. Frame up the text in the middle of the viewfinder and give your iPhone a moment to \"think.\" If all goes well, you should see a yellow frame appear around the text, and a new button appear in the bottom right of the viewfinder—or top right, if you're holding your iPhone in landscape. </p><p>Tap this button, and iOS will cut out the selected text, and zoom in to bring it into focus. Now, tap the \"Translate\" button that appears in the bottom left (or top left in landscape), wait a moment, and presto: The text is replaced by your target language. As you might guess, for me, that's English, but the feature will translate into whichever system language your iPhone is currently set to.</p><div>\n    <p><img src=\"https://lifehacker.com/imagery/articles/01K60TCH66X4WWW8DBDV6P4GMC/images-1.fill.size_2000x1125.v1758820823.png\" alt=\"translating within the camera app\" srcset=\"https://lifehacker.com/imagery/articles/01K60TCH66X4WWW8DBDV6P4GMC/images-1.fill.size_800x450.v1758820823.png 800w, https://lifehacker.com/imagery/articles/01K60TCH66X4WWW8DBDV6P4GMC/images-1.fill.size_1400x788.v1758820823.png 1400w, https://lifehacker.com/imagery/articles/01K60TCH66X4WWW8DBDV6P4GMC/images-1.fill.size_2000x1125.v1758820823.png 2000w\" />\n            </p>\n            <p><span></span>\n                                        <span>Credit: Lifehacker</span>\n                    </p>\n    </div>\n<p>For many applications, this translation is enough. But there's more you can do with this. If you need to share that translated text somewhere, you can tap the translation to pull up a Translate mini window. Here, you can copy the translation so you can paste it wherever you'd like. You'll also be able to have iOS read either the translation or original text out loud, add the translation to your favorites, or open the translation in the Translate app. </p><p>This hidden perk is part of the iPhone's larger <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/how-to-use-live-text-the-best-new-feature-in-ios-15-1847649795\" target=\"_blank\">Live Text feature</a>, which uses OCR (optical character recognition) to identify text in images. Live Text allows you to select text both in images and within the camera's viewfinder for easy copy and pasting. And, since iOS 16, it allows you to translate that text directly within the camera as well. Since it's powered by the Translate app, it supports the languages the app does, which includes:</p><div>\n            <p><span>\n                What do you think so far?\n            </span>\n        </p></div>\n<ul><li><p>Arabic</p></li><li><p>Chinese (Mandarin, Simplified)</p></li><li><p>Chinese (Mandarin, Traditional)</p></li><li><p>Dutch</p></li><li><p>English (UK)</p></li><li><p>French</p></li><li><p>German</p></li><li><p>Hindi</p></li><li><p>Indonesian</p></li><li><p>Italian</p></li><li><p>Japanese</p></li><li><p>Korean</p></li><li><p>Polish</p></li><li><p>Portuguese (Brazil)</p></li><li><p>Russian</p></li><li><p>Spanish (Spain)</p></li><li><p>Thai</p></li><li><p>Turkish</p></li><li><p>Ukrainian</p></li><li><p>Vietnamese </p></li></ul><p>If this feature isn't working for you, it's likely not turned on. To check, head to <strong>Settings > Camera</strong>, then ensure \"Show Detected Text\" is enabled. </p><h2 id=\"other-ways-to-translate-on-iphone\">Other ways to translate on iPhone</h2><p>This is far from the only way to translate other languages on your iPhone. As previously mentioned, iOS comes with a built-in Translate app, which has its own Camera function as well. But with iOS 26, there's a new translation feature that works seamlessly as you use your iPhone: <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/tech/apple-live-translation-messages-facetime-and-your-phone-calls-wwdc-2025\" target=\"_blank\">Live Translate</a>. </p><p>As the name suggests, Live Translate can translate conversations in real time. This works in Messages with text, but also during FaceTime and phone calls when talking to someone in another language. If you have a compatible pair of AirPods, <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/tech/you-dont-need-to-buy-airpods-pro-3-to-use-live-translation\" target=\"_blank\">you can even use this feature when talking to someone in person</a>: You'll hear their words translated in your ears, and they'll see your words translated on your iPhone's display.</p>\n            </article>\n    </div>\n<div>\n    <div>\n        <p><span>The Download Newsletter</span>\n            <span>Never miss a tech story</span>\n        </p>\n        <p><img src=\"https://lifehacker.com/images/team/Jake.png\" alt=\"Jake Peterson portrait\" />\n            <span>Jake Peterson\n            </span>\n            <span>Senior tech editor</span>\n        </p>\n        <p><span>Get the latest tech news, <span></span>reviews, <span></span>and advice from Jake and the team.</span>\n    </p></div>\n    <div>\n        <p><span>The Download Newsletter</span>\n            <span><span>Never miss a tech story.</span> Get the latest tech news, <span></span>reviews, <span></span>and advice from Jake and the team.</span>\n        </p>\n    </div>\n</div>\n    </div>\n            <div>\n                <p><span>\n                        Keep Scrolling for Next Article\n                    </span>\n                </p>\n            </div>\n        </div>\n    </div>"

target=\"_blank\" title=\"open in a new window\">the first beta for iOS 26.1</a>. With it, we can see what the company is planning for <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/tech/settings-to-change-after-installing-ios-26\" target=\"_blank\">the successor to iOS 26</a>, including new gestures in Apple Music, a new scrubbing bar for the video player, and Liquid Glass support for the keypad in the Phone app. It's a small update on the surface, but there's something quite interesting going on behind the scenes. </p><h2 id=\"notification-forwarding\">'Notification Forwarding'</h2><p><a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2917201/ios-26-1-beta-suggests-the-iphone-will-soon-support-third-party-smartwatches.html\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"open in a new window\">As discovered by Macworld</a>, code within the iOS 26.1 beta suggests that Apple is working on support for third-party smartwatches in future versions of iOS. Macworld found references to a new feature called \"Notification Forwarding,\" which supposedly would allows users to direct alerts from their iPhone to a device not made by Apple. It's a bit vague, as that could mean anything from a tablet to a PC, but Macworld believes it is intended to support notification forwarding to non-Apple smartwatches.</p><div>\n        <p><img src=\"https://lifehacker.com/images/short-lifehacker-logo.jpg\" alt=\"Lifehacker Logo\" /></p><div>\n            <p><span>You May Also Like</span></p>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n<p>The code also seems to indicate that this feature supports notification forwarding to one device at a time. If you were to set your notifications from your iPhone to a Galaxy Watch, for example, it might disable notifications to your Apple Watch. In addition, there are references to an unfinished feature called \"AccessoryExtension,\" which might support pairing third-party watches to your iPhone. </p><p>Notification Forwarding and AccessoryExtension could be indicative of a big change for Apple. One of the things that makes the company so successful is its \"ecosystem,\" the idea that Apple's products are designed to work seamlessly together. If you have an iPhone, it connects to and works with iPads, Macs, and, of course, Apple Watches. When you try to connect to and work with third-party devices, however, you run into road blocks. </p><p>Smartwatches might be among the biggest hurdles here. Apple's smartwatch, of course, does everything you'd expect a smartwatch to do with your smartphone. But if you're thinking of picking up a Pixel Watch or Galaxy Watch, it's a different story. In fact, there's really no way to pair one of these to your iPhone. If you're coming from Android and you try to use your Pixel Watch with your iPhone, you're going to have a bad time. \"Notification Forwarding\" could offer a bridge.</p><div>\n            <p><span>\n                What do you think so far?\n            </span>\n        </p></div>\n<p>Some smartwatches, like those from Garmin, do offer notification forwarding support already, so the feature wouldn't necessarily be groundbreaking. But it could expand smartwatch options for users beyond the limited devices that currently work with iOS' notifications. </p><h2 id=\"two-reasons-you-might-not-see-these-changes-on-your-iphone\">Two reasons you might not see these changes on your iPhone</h2><p>Before you get too excited, there are a couple of caveats here. First, these changes are not an active part of iOS 26.1; rather, they are simply references within the code. That indicates this is something Apple is working on, but not necessarily something that will definitely launch. Until we see the features appear in a future beta update, it's possible this will simply remain an experiment. </p><p>And even if Apple does roll out these changes, it might only be to a select group of users. There's a chance third-party smartwatch support is solely targeted towards the EU, following the union's <a href=\"https://mashable.com/article/apple-dma-eu-connectivity-interoperability-proceedings\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"open in a new window\">Digital Markets Act</a>. That legislation requires Apple to open up iOS to third-party devices, which, notably, includes smartwatches. Apple doesn't tend to open up when it doesn't have to, which is why the EU has third-party app stores on iOS and the rest of the world does not. We could see yet another EU-specific feature in this case: Europeans might be able to use their Android watches with iOS, while the rest of us are stuck with Apple Watches. </p>\n            </article>\n    </div>\n<div>\n    <div>\n        <p><span>The Download Newsletter</span>\n            <span>Never miss a tech story</span>\n        </p>\n        <p><img src=\"https://lifehacker.com/images/team/Jake.png\" alt=\"Jake Peterson portrait\" />\n            <span>Jake Peterson\n            </span>\n            <span>Senior tech editor</span>\n        </p>\n        <p><span>Get the latest tech news, <span></span>reviews, <span></span>and advice from Jake and the team.</span>\n    </p></div>\n    <div>\n        <p><span>The Download Newsletter</span>\n            <span><span>Never miss a tech story.</span> Get the latest tech news, <span></span>reviews, <span></span>and advice from Jake and the team.</span>\n        </p>\n    </div>\n</div>\n    </div>\n            <div>\n                <p><span>\n                        Keep Scrolling for Next Article\n                    </span>\n                </p>\n            </div>\n        </div>\n    </div>"

/><p>Before you sit down to study or get started on a big project for work, you might want to consider hitting the gym or taking a brisk walk. Besides just generally being good for your health, research also shows it can actually help with cognition. And with, say, the start of a new semester bearing down upon you or a work deadline looming, anything that can give you a brain boost is likely welcome. </p><h2 id=\"what-the-research-says-about-exercise-and-studying\">What the research says about exercise and studying</h2><p>There’s no shortage of solid, peer-reviewed research on the effect of exercise on cognition, going back <a href=\"https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Phillip-Tomporowski/publication/10893216_Effects_of_acute_bouts_of_exercise_on_cognition/links/5d9b7b95a6fdccfd0e81034e/Effects-of-acute-bouts-of-exercise-on-cognition.pdf?_sg%5B0%5D=started_experiment_milestone&origin=journalDetail&_rtd=e30%3D\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"open in a new window\">decades</a>. There's just a shortage on explanations. The exact reasons that exercise helps thinking aren’t fully understood, but <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5934999/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"open in a new window\">one 2018 review in <em>Frontiers in Psychology</em></a> discusses evidence that it may increase blood flow to the brain, boost levels of certain neurotransmitters, and increase your feelings of control and self-esteem. Purely anecdotally, I think that's true. When I leave the gym in the morning, I feel like I've already accomplished something and tend to be a little more of a go-getter at work, riding my smug little wave to continue the day's productive streak. </p><div>\n        <p><img src=\"https://lifehacker.com/images/short-lifehacker-logo.jpg\" alt=\"Lifehacker Logo\" /></p><div>\n            <p><span>You May Also Like</span></p>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3951958/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"open in a new window\">Another review</a>, from 2013, notes that “more active” individuals are better able to pay attention to their surroundings and process information more quickly. Exercise may even change our brains for the long term; the 2018 review concluded that “chronic aerobic exercise is associated with potent structural and functional neuroplastic changes, with an improvement in cognitive functions.”</p><h2 id=\"what-exercises-work-best-for-your-brain\">What exercises work best for your brain?</h2><p>The research is pro-exercise in all forms, but especially hones in on acute aerobic exercise—or the kind of exercise where you’re moving around a lot and your heart rate is up. A “single bout” of this kind of movement is related to improved cognitive functions, according to the researchers in <em>Frontiers</em>.</p><div>\n            <p><span>\n                What do you think so far?\n            </span>\n        </p></div>\n<p>So, before you sit down to study, plan your week, or have an important conversation with your boss, consider swimming, biking, jogging, running, hopping on the elliptical, or taking a brisk walk around the block. You want to get in some solid cardio here, even if it is as simple as biking to work or taking your lunch break at the gym. (<a href=\"https://www.lifehacker.com/how-much-exercise-do-i-really-need-1823708126\" target=\"_blank\">Here’s a guide to how much exercise you need</a> each week, in general.)</p><h2 id=\"how-to-make-time-to-work-out\">How to make time to work out</h2><p>I know it's hard to find time to work out, especially if you're a stressed-out student—but that makes it all the more important you do carve out some time for taking care of your body, regardless of the effect it has on your mind. Taking into account that it could make you a <em>better</em> student, it practically becomes non-negotiable. </p><p>If getting to the gym, the bike path, or the rec center truly isn't feasible, there is plenty you can do from the comfort of home or your dorm room. Since we're looking to get the heart rate up here, focus on cardio, to the extent possible in your space. <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/health/the-best-free-cardio-workout-channels-on-youtube\" target=\"_blank\">YouTube is full of great follow-along workout videos</a> that can get blood pumping, for instance. I'd also recommend having a designated workout app to guide you. I'm <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/health/peloton-app-review\" target=\"_blank\">partial to Peloton's app</a>, but while that app has all kinds of class types from <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/health/peloton-class-with-no-peloton-bike\" target=\"_blank\">cycling</a> to <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/health/peloton-guided-walk-workouts-recommendation\" target=\"_blank\">walking</a> to <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/health/pelotons-yoga-offerings-are-surprisingly-robust\" target=\"_blank\">yoga</a>, it can also cost up to $44 a month, making it a little difficult to maintain for a student. As a free alternative, you can try <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/health/nike-training-club-app-review\" target=\"_blank\">Nike Training Club</a>, which has similar classes you can follow along with from home. Check with your university's student center about what's available, too. Schools offer all kinds of wellness-focused resources, from fitness apps to on-campus recreational centers. In grad school, I taught spin classes in my university's rec center that were free for other students to attend—and, true to the research, I always noticed a little cognitive boost when I did it right before class. </p>\n            </article>\n    </div>\n<div>\n    <div>\n        <p><span>The Daily Newsletter</span>\n            <span>Ready to do everything better?</span>\n        </p>\n        <p><img src=\"https://lifehacker.com/images/team/Jordan.png\" alt=\"Jordan Calhoun portrait\" />\n            <span>Jordan Calhoun\n            </span>\n            <span>Editor in chief</span>\n        </p>\n        <p><span><span>Get daily tips, tricks, <span>and tech guides</span></span> <span>from Jordan and the team.</span></span>\n    </p></div>\n    <div>\n        <p><span>The Daily Newsletter</span>\n            <span><span>Ready to do everything better?</span> <span>Get daily tips, tricks, <span>and tech guides</span></span> <span>from Jordan and the team.</span></span>\n        </p>\n    </div>\n</div>\n    </div>\n            <div>\n                <p><span>\n                        Keep Scrolling for Next Article\n                    </span>\n                </p>\n            </div>\n        </div>\n    </div>"

/><p>This week I did over a dozen workouts with Apple’s new Workout Buddy. I ran, I walked, I strength trained, and even did a little indoor cycling. I’ve learned a few things, but the strangest is that I didn’t need an Apple Watch for any of it. </p><p>Workout Buddy is an AI-powered feature that sends a little voice into your headphones to motivate and congratulate you as you’re working out. Apple touted Workout Buddy <a href=\"https://zdcs.link/QxxwGO?pageview_type=Standard&template=Explainers&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=as%20a%20feature%20of%20WatchOS%2026&short_url=QxxwGO&u=https%3A%2F%2Flifehacker.com%2Fhealth%2Fsurprising-things-about-apples-new-workout-buddy&event_label=as%20a%20feature%20of%20WatchOS%2026\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"open in a new window\"><u>as a feature of WatchOS 26</u></a> and <a href=\"https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2025/09/apple-debuts-apple-watch-series-11-featuring-groundbreaking-health-insights/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"open in a new window\"><u>promoted it among the features</u></a> of the new <a href=\"https://zdcs.link/z31xdE?pageview_type=Standard&template=Explainers&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=Series%2011%20Apple%20Watch&short_url=z31xdE&u=https%3A%2F%2Flifehacker.com%2Fhealth%2Fsurprising-things-about-apples-new-workout-buddy&event_label=Series%2011%20Apple%20Watch\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"open in a new window\"><u>Series 11 Apple Watch</u></a>, so you’d be forgiven for thinking it’s part of of the Apple Watch, specifically. But that’s not what I found. </p><div>\n        <p><img src=\"https://lifehacker.com/images/short-lifehacker-logo.jpg\" alt=\"Lifehacker Logo\" /></p><div>\n            <p><span>You May Also Like</span></p>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n<h2 id=\"how-to-use-workout-buddy-without-an-apple-watch\">How to use Workout Buddy without an Apple Watch</h2><p>But as I found when I took a supported Apple Watch out for a trail run with an old iPhone (a 12 Mini), Workout Buddy <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/health/workout-buddy-apple-watch-requirements\" target=\"_blank\"><u>requires a phone that supports Apple Intelligence</u></a>, so I didn’t have access to it. OK, fine, it needs a newer watch <em>and</em> a newer phone. (Or so I thought.) Eventually I got my hands on a 16 Pro and, yep, was able to enable and use Workout Buddy. </p><p>But this week—with a Series 11 Apple Watch on my wrist and WatchOS 26 installed—I discovered something. I could power off the watch, or even leave it at home, and <em>still get Workout Buddy</em>. Here are a few things I tried, <em>all</em> of which got me Workout Buddy: </p><ul><li><p>Starting a workout from the Series 10 or Series 11 Apple Watch</p></li><li><p>Starting a workout from the Fitness app (<a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/health/ios-26-gives-the-iphone-a-real-fitness-app\" target=\"_blank\"><u>you can do that now!</u></a>) with the Powerbeats Pro 2 headphones paired</p></li><li><p>Starting a workout from the Fitness app without any other Apple products in range, just a Coospo heart rate monitor and some Shokz headphones</p></li><li><p>Starting a workout from the Fitness app with just Shokz headphones paired (no heart rate monitor, since it was a GPS-enabled walk)</p></li></ul><p>The only configuration that <em>wouldn’t</em> give me Workout Buddy was using the Fitness app without headphones paired. It’s serious about needing headphones, but they can be paired to either the Watch or the iPhone. </p><h2 id=\"workout-buddy-is-more-of-a-chipper-sidekick-than-a-coach\">Workout Buddy is more of a chipper sidekick than a coach</h2><p>I hoped Workout Buddy might provide some kind of coaching or workout guidance, but found that’s not quite what it’s there for. The biggest difference between having Workout Buddy on versus off during a run is that, with Workout Buddy, you get your splits read to you in a more conversational voice.</p><p>The main advantage of Workout Buddy is that it gives you a check-in at the beginning and end of your workout to let you know where you stand on your goals and progress for the day and the week, and it will call out any notable recent achievements. </p><div>\n            <p><span>\n                What do you think so far?\n            </span>\n        </p></div>\n<p>For example, at the start of pretty much every workout this week—whether running, walking, or strength–it congratulated me on running my fastest-ever 5K last Tuesday. It also let me know I logged at least 16 workouts every week for the past four weeks, which is very consistent of me. </p><p>The workout count seems to be correct (I log a lot of short workouts for device testing), but the 5K callout is wrong. Last Tuesday I earned a 5K badge, but that’s just for logging a run of more than five kilometers, not for running my <em>fastest</em> 5K. According to the Fitness app—remember, the same app that contains Workout Buddy—my fastest 5K was in July of 2021. </p><p>Besides those hallucinations, the information seems to be reasonable. The overly-enthusiastic voice of the Workout Buddy always tells me at the start of each workout where I stand on my ring-closing goals. I need 22 more minutes to close my Exercise ring, it might say, or 37 more calories to close the Move ring. At the start of a run, it will tell me how many miles I’ve already run this week. And if I have music playing, it will name-check the band—seemingly just to let me know it can read that data. “Get into the rhythm with Fleetwood Mac!” it told me once, just as a Fleetwood Mac song was fading out. </p><p>Overall, I find the goal-oriented check-ins useful; knowing I have 22 minutes left on my exercise goal does make me more likely to extend my workout if I was only going to do a 20-minute one. The conversational voice giving me my mile splits is a bit nicer than hearing the generic, more robot-like voice. And if I <em>had</em> run my fastest 5K recently, I’d probably love to be reminded about it at every opportunity. </p>\n            </article>\n    </div>\n<div>\n    <div>\n        <p><span>The Daily Newsletter</span>\n            <span>Ready to do everything better?</span>\n        </p>\n        <p><img src=\"https://lifehacker.com/images/team/Jordan.png\" alt=\"Jordan Calhoun portrait\" />\n            <span>Jordan Calhoun\n            </span>\n            <span>Editor in chief</span>\n        </p>\n        <p><span><span>Get daily tips, tricks, <span>and tech guides</span></span> <span>from Jordan and the team.</span></span>\n    </p></div>\n    <div>\n        <p><span>The Daily Newsletter</span>\n            <span><span>Ready to do everything better?</span> <span>Get daily tips, tricks, <span>and tech guides</span></span> <span>from Jordan and the team.</span></span>\n        </p>\n    </div>\n</div>\n    </div>\n            <div>\n                <p><span>\n                        Keep Scrolling for Next Article\n                    </span>\n                </p>\n            </div>\n        </div>\n    </div>"

As of Monday, iOS 26.1 is officially in beta testing, which means developers and public testers can try out Apple's next update early. </p><p>\"Point updates\" like iOS 26.1 are never as feature-filled as the main releases, though 26.1 seems particularly small in scope. Apple seems to have done most of what it planned to do with iOS 26, saving just smaller changes for this upcoming update. Still, there are some interesting new additions in this latest beta, and more could come in subsequent releases. Here's what's new.</p><div>\n        <p><img src=\"https://lifehacker.com/images/short-lifehacker-logo.jpg\" alt=\"Lifehacker Logo\" /></p><div>\n            <p><span>You May Also Like</span></p>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n<h2 id=\"apple-music-gestures\">Apple Music gestures</h2><p>If you want to skip a song in Apple Music, you hit the forward button. If you want to get back to the previous song, or restart the current song, you hit the back button. With iOS 26.1, however, you'll have the option to swipe to switch between songs. </p><p>In the current beta, you can swipe right and left on the Now Playing bar to switch back and forth through your queue. With it, Apple has removed the skip forward button from the Now Playing bar. (The back button wasn't present.) It's a small but cool feature, but one that might take a little time to get used to.</p><blockquote>\n    <a href=\"https://twitter.com/BetaProfiles/status/1970499981493833985\" title=\"open in a new window\" target=\"_blank\">\n        This Tweet is currently unavailable. It might be loading or has been removed.\n    </a>\n</blockquote>\n<h2 id=\"video-playback-bar\">Video playback bar</h2><p>In the current version of iOS 26, the video playback bar in the Photos app is flush with the UI. You might love or hate it, but it can be a bit difficult to make it out, depending on the video in question. The play button and mute button, for example, can disappear when iOS can't change their colors to stand out from the background. </p><p>iOS 26.1 beta 1, however, introduces a new video playback bar that is separate from the UI. It looks good, and is easy to see at all times. Again, a small change, but a smart one.</p><blockquote>\n    <a href=\"https://twitter.com/BetaProfiles/status/1970204922751971838\" title=\"open in a new window\" target=\"_blank\">\n        This Tweet is currently unavailable.

So long as you have an iPhone 15 Pro or newer, as well as AirPods Pro 2, AirPods Pro 3, or AirPods 5 with Active Noise Cancellation, you've been able to try it out since iOS 26's launch.  </p><p>Apple initially rolled out support for French, German, Portuguese (Brazil), and Spanish (Spain), but plans to expand the list in the future. With iOS 26.1, it adds four new options, including:</p><ul><li><p>Chinese (Mandarin, simplified)</p></li><li><p>Chinese (Mandarin, traditional)</p></li><li><p>Italian</p></li><li><p>Japanese</p></li><li><p>Korean</p></li></ul><h2 id=\"eight-new-languages-for-apple-intelligence\">Eight new languages for Apple Intelligence</h2><p>Users with an iPhone 15 Pro and newer, listen up: Apple Intelligence supports eight new languages in iOS 26.1. As of this first beta, that includes the following: </p><div>\n            <p><span>\n                What do you think so far?\n            </span>\n        </p></div>\n<ul><li><p>Chinese (traditional)</p></li><li><p>Danish</p></li><li><p>Dutch</p></li><li><p>Norwegian</p></li><li><p>Portuguese (Portugal)</p></li><li><p>Swedish</p></li><li><p>Turkish</p></li><li><p>Vietnamese</p></li></ul><h2 id=\"liquid-glass-comes-to-the-phones-keypad\">Liquid Glass comes to the Phone's keypad</h2><p><a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/tech/how-to-undo-iphone-ios-26-liquid-glass\" target=\"_blank\">Liquid Glass</a>, Apple's new design language, isn't <em>everywhere </em>in iOS 26. While much of the UI now has a glassy look, some elements still look like iOS 18 and earlier. The Phone app's keypad was one such example: While the app itself is <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/tech/ios-26-missed-call-reminders\" target=\"_blank\">very much changed</a> with this update, switch to the keypad, and it looks the same as ever. </p><p>That changes with iOS 26.1. The beta brings Liquid Glass to the keypad, which, while consistent with most of iOS 26's design, does reduce the visibility of the keys a bit, especially in light mode. I wouldn't be surprised to see Apple workshop this one a bit. </p><blockquote>\n    <a href=\"https://twitter.com/BetaProfiles/status/1970197002941321667\" title=\"open in a new window\" target=\"_blank\">\n        This Tweet is currently unavailable.

Some watches offer notification support, but most simply don't jive well with iOS. </p><p>That might be changing in the future. <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/tech/apple-might-support-third-party-smartwatches\" target=\"_blank\">Code within the iOS 26.1 beta</a> references a new \"Notification Forwarding\" feature, that might allow you to choose a third-party device to send your iPhone alerts to. In addition, an unfinished \"AccessoryExtension\" option might be the framework that lets you pair a third-party watch to your iPhone.</p><p>These are just references in code, not something that you can actively test out in the 26.1 beta, but it's worth noting. Apple is experimenting with supporting third-party watches on iOS, though it could just be to appease the EU's \"Digital Markets Act.\"  </p>\n            </article>\n    </div>\n<div>\n    <div>\n        <p><span>The Download Newsletter</span>\n            <span>Never miss a tech story</span>\n        </p>\n        <p><img src=\"https://lifehacker.com/images/team/Jake.png\" alt=\"Jake Peterson portrait\" />\n            <span>Jake Peterson\n            </span>\n            <span>Senior tech editor</span>\n        </p>\n        <p><span>Get the latest tech news, <span></span>reviews, <span></span>and advice from Jake and the team.</span>\n    </p></div>\n    <div>\n        <p><span>The Download Newsletter</span>\n            <span><span>Never miss a tech story.</span> Get the latest tech news, <span></span>reviews, <span></span>and advice from Jake and the team.</span>\n        </p>\n    </div>\n</div>\n    </div>\n            <div>\n                <p><span>\n                        Keep Scrolling for Next Article\n                    </span>\n                </p>\n            </div>\n        </div>\n    </div>"

Apple can keep adding new features and designs with each new smartphone iteration, but if the company just announced a new iPhone with record-breaking battery life, customers would be thrilled. </p><p>While we may have to wait for a time when the iPhone can go a couple days in between charges, Apple has added a new option to iOS 26 in an effort to help extend your iPhone's battery life. The feature, Adaptive Power, uses on-device AI to analyze your iPhone usage and guess the times you'll need additional battery life. This is exactly how I want to see AI being used—not for generating <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/tech/you-are-not-prepared-for-this-new-wave-of-ai-generated-videos\" target=\"_blank\">hyper-realistic videos</a> or <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/tech/spotify-ai-music-policies\" target=\"_blank\">musical slop</a>. </p><div>\n        <p><img src=\"https://lifehacker.com/images/short-lifehacker-logo.jpg\" alt=\"Lifehacker Logo\" /></p><div>\n            <p><span>You May Also Like</span></p>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n<h2 id=\"how-adaptive-power-tries-to-boost-your-battery\">How Adaptive Power tries to boost your battery</h2><div><p>When Adaptive Power decides it's time to engage, the feature can adjust your iPhone's performance level. This will make some tasks take longer than they normally would, but that slower speed supposedly saves on battery life. In addition, Adaptive Power lowers screen brightness by 3%, limits background activity, and, when your iPhone reaches 20%, kicks on Low Power Mode without asking you first. </p><p>Apple isn't totally clear here about the difference between Low Power Mode and Adaptive Power in general. From what we know, it seems that Adaptive Power simply reduces processing speeds at select intervals, and only slightly lowers brightness, while Low Power Mode slows speeds and display refresh rate, and limits brightness, 5G, iCloud syncing, and mail fetch, among other tasks.  </p></div><p>Adaptive Power is enabled by default on Apple's newest iPhones, including the iPhone 17, iPhone 17 Pro, iPhone 17 Pro Max, and iPhone Air—the latter of which <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/tech/extend-iphone-air-battery-life\" target=\"_blank\">could most likely benefit from such a feature</a>. For all other compatible iPhones, which includes iPhone 15 Pro and newer, the feature is turned off by default. That means, unless you have an iPhone 17 device, you'll need to turn this on yourself.</p><div>\n            <p><span>\n                What do you think so far?\n            </span>\n        </p></div>\n<h2 id=\"how-to-turn-adaptive-power-on-or-off\">How to turn Adaptive Power on or off</h2><p>Whether you have an iPhone 15 Pro or an iPhone 17, you'll find the controls for Adaptive Power in the same place. Open Settings, then head to <strong>Battery > Power Mode</strong>. Here, you can tap the toggle next to \"Adaptive Power\" to turn the setting on or off. </p><p>Since Adaptive Power turns on and off throughout the day, Apple also offers you the option to receive alerts whenever the feature is active. You can adjust this setting from the \"Adaptive Power Notifications\" toggle.</p><p>I've been using Adaptive Power since <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/tech/when-ios-26-will-release\" target=\"_blank\">iOS 26 dropped on Sept. 15</a>, but it's tough to say whether the feature has had a noticeable impact on my battery life. I think it would help if Apple added Adaptive Power information to my battery stats, so I could compare the impacts before and after using the feature. For now, I'll continue using it, if for no other reason than to offer my battery the best possible chance of making it through the day without its charger. </p>\n            </article>\n    </div>\n<div>\n    <div>\n        <p><span>The Download Newsletter</span>\n            <span>Never miss a tech story</span>\n        </p>\n        <p><img src=\"https://lifehacker.com/images/team/Jake.png\" alt=\"Jake Peterson portrait\" />\n            <span>Jake Peterson\n            </span>\n            <span>Senior tech editor</span>\n        </p>\n        <p><span>Get the latest tech news, <span></span>reviews, <span></span>and advice from Jake and the team.</span>\n    </p></div>\n    <div>\n        <p><span>The Download Newsletter</span>\n            <span><span>Never miss a tech story.</span> Get the latest tech news, <span></span>reviews, <span></span>and advice from Jake and the team.</span>\n        </p>\n    </div>\n</div>\n    </div>\n            <div>\n                <p><span>\n                        Keep Scrolling for Next Article\n                    </span>\n                </p>\n            </div>\n        </div>"
