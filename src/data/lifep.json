By default, trackers steal a <em>lot</em> of your data while you browse the web, but simple settings can block a lot of those trackers from functioning. As it turns out, <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/tech/the-best-five-ios-26-features\" target=\"_blank\">by updating to iOS 26</a>, your iPhone gets an upgraded tool against tracking.</p><p>The feature, called Advanced Tracking and Fingerprinting Protection, is an option in Safari that hides certain browser and device data trackers typically use to build a <a href=\"https://www.cnet.com/tech/services-and-software/enable-this-ios-26-privacy-feature-to-make-it-harder-for-others-to-track-you/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"open in a new window\">digital \"fingerprint\" of users</a>. In this case, a fingerprint is a profile companies use to track your movements across the web. Your fingerprint may be made up of data like your device's IP address, the device itself, your browser, fonts, plug-ins, as well as its screen resolution. All of these data points come together to build a unique picture of who you are; the more unique your fingerprint, <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/tech/cover-your-tracks-see-whos-following-you-online\" target=\"_blank\">the easier it is to track you</a>, since the odds of someone else with your exact same details is slim. </p><div>\n        <p><img src=\"https://lifehacker.com/images/short-lifehacker-logo.jpg\" alt=\"Lifehacker Logo\" /></p><div>\n            <p><span>You May Also Like</span></p>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n<p>Fingerprinting has a number of applications across the web, but perhaps the largest is for targeted advertising. The reason many of the ads you see are so relevant to your interests and browsing history is because of fingerprinting. Trackers know your internet habits, and can identify and deliver the advertisements you're most likely to click or tap on. Companies can also sell these fingerprinting profiles to brokers and advertisers, making money on both your engagement with ads, as well as your raw data.  </p><p>Advanced Tracking and Fingerprinting Protection simplifies each Safari user's data, so our fingerprints aren't quite so unique. By doing so, it's harder for trackers to identify individuals, and, as such, makes it possible to browser the web more privately. </p><p>This feature was already a thing on iPhone before iOS 26. However, it was limited to Private Browsing by default. If you didn't do all your browsing in a private tab, you likely lost some of these privacy protections, unless you knew to manually change the setting to cover all browsing. The same goes for iPadOS and macOS as well. Most of us probably didn't change the setting, since it's quite buried in each OS' respective settings.</p><div>\n            <p><span>\n                What do you think so far?\n            </span>\n        </p></div>\n<p>Once you update your iPhone, iPad, or Mac to the latest OS, however, your browsing gets these added tracking protections by default. Whether you browse in a private or a normal window, trackers will have a difficult time identifying your device. </p><h2 id=\"how-to-check-your-advanced-tracking-and-fingerprinting-protection-settings\">How to check your Advanced Tracking and Fingerprinting Protection settings </h2><p>This setting should be enabled by default when you update your device. But if you want to make sure it's on, here's where to find it. On your iPhone or iPad, open <strong>Settings</strong>, then head to <strong>Apps > Safari > Advanced</strong>. On your Mac, open Safari, press Command + , to pull up Safari's settings, then choose the <strong>Advanced</strong> tab.</p><p>From here, ensure Advanced Tracking and Fingerprinting Protection is set to \"All Browsing\" (iOS/iPadOS) or \"in all browsing\" (macOS).</p>\n            </article>\n    </div>\n<div>\n    <div>\n        <p><span>The Download Newsletter</span>\n            <span>Never miss a tech story</span>\n        </p>\n        <p><img src=\"https://lifehacker.com/images/team/Jake.png\" alt=\"Jake Peterson portrait\" />\n            <span>Jake Peterson\n            </span>\n            <span>Senior tech editor</span>\n        </p>\n        <p><span>Get the latest tech news, <span></span>reviews, <span></span>and advice from Jake and the team.</span>\n    </p></div>\n    <div>\n        <p><span>The Download Newsletter</span>\n            <span><span>Never miss a tech story.</span> Get the latest tech news, <span></span>reviews, <span></span>and advice from Jake and the team.</span>\n        </p>\n    </div>\n</div>\n    </div>\n            <div>\n                <p><span>\n                        Keep Scrolling for Next Article\n                    </span>\n                </p>\n            </div>\n        </div>"

In many cases they can be operated remotely and work autonomously, so they can be taking care of the chores while you're out at work or on vacation.</p><div>\n    <p><img src=\"https://lifehacker.com/imagery/articles/01K57198V3E3FABSSYCRSRWCH6/images-1.fill.size_2000x1125.v1757951599.jpg\" alt=\"Ecovacs Winbot W2 Pro Omni\" srcset=\"https://lifehacker.com/imagery/articles/01K57198V3E3FABSSYCRSRWCH6/images-1.fill.size_800x450.v1757951599.jpg 800w, https://lifehacker.com/imagery/articles/01K57198V3E3FABSSYCRSRWCH6/images-1.fill.size_1400x788.v1757951599.jpg 1400w, https://lifehacker.com/imagery/articles/01K57198V3E3FABSSYCRSRWCH6/images-1.fill.size_2000x1125.v1757951599.jpg 2000w\" />\n            </p>\n            <p><span>You can get smart devices to wash your windows for you.</span>\n                                        <span>Credit: Ecovacs</span>\n                    </p>\n    </div>\n<p>You <em>are </em>going to have to make an initial investment in the technology, and, for some devices, a rather sizable one. The argument can be made that hiring someone to do your cleaning is a better option than getting robots to do it: They might do a more thorough job, depending on the person and the gadget you're comparing them to, and you can give them more specific instructions. However, getting cleaners in does involve giving someone else access to your home, and finding a mutually convenient time. It will also be an ongoing expense.</p><p>There are a few more cons to consider. One is that a certain amount of tidying up and preparation work is often required before the robots can take over. You may have to pick up toys and clothes, for example, so the robot vacuum can vacuum. By the time you've done that, you might think it makes more sense to just do the whole job yourself.</p><div>\n    <p><img src=\"https://lifehacker.com/imagery/articles/01K57198V3E3FABSSYCRSRWCH6/images-2.fill.size_2000x1125.v1757951599.jpg\" alt=\"Roomba app\" srcset=\"https://lifehacker.com/imagery/articles/01K57198V3E3FABSSYCRSRWCH6/images-2.fill.size_800x450.v1757951599.jpg 800w, https://lifehacker.com/imagery/articles/01K57198V3E3FABSSYCRSRWCH6/images-2.fill.size_1400x788.v1757951599.jpg 1400w, https://lifehacker.com/imagery/articles/01K57198V3E3FABSSYCRSRWCH6/images-2.fill.size_2000x1125.v1757951599.jpg 2000w\" />\n            </p>\n            <p><span>Many smart devices can be controlled via an app.</span>\n                                        <span>Credit: iRobot</span>\n                    </p>\n    </div>\n<p>What's more, these gadgets require a certain level of maintenance: Depending on the device, you need to empty them out, supply them with power, water, and cleaning products, and perhaps even clean parts of them yourself. Like any piece of hardware, they will experience wear and tear, and will eventually need to be replaced.</p><p>There's one other consideration to think about, which is that manual cleaning is a great way to exercise. <a href=\"https://bmcgeriatr.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12877-023-04039-1\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"open in a new window\">Studies have shown</a> that domestic duties can give you enough of a workout to extend your lifespan and improve a host of different health markers, so you might want to use some of the time that these gadgets are saving you to head out for a run or for a session at the gym.</p><h2 id=\"the-best-smart-cleaning-gadgets-you-can-buy\">The best smart cleaning gadgets you can buy</h2><p>If you've decided that you want to transform your home into one that cleans itself, you can automate a number of different processes using a number of different devices. There's plenty of choice out there, so the usual rules apply: Take your time to research the various options and the features they're offering versus their price, and find as many reviews as you can from people who've used them.</p><h3>Robot vacuums and mops</h3><p>This is the obvious place to start, as these are the gadgets that usually come to mind when you think of smart cleaning tech. You can find single-purpose devices that only vacuum or only mop, or devices that combine both functions.</p><p>While early models had their issues with reliability and cleaning power, the robot vacuums you can buy today are generally more impressive in terms of how clean they can get your carpets and floors. You'll find features like LiDAR and camera-powered mapping and obstacle avoidance, self-emptying capabilities, and auto-adjustments depending on what surface is being cleaned. </p><p>Often, everything these machines do can be organized through a companion app, so you can set the cleaners to work on a specific schedule, as well as set zones or rooms that are off limits. We're even starting to see robot vacuums that can <a href=\"https://vacuumwars.com/eufy-marswalker-omni-s2-ifa-2025/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"open in a new window\">climb up the stairs</a>, so they really can get your whole house vacuumed and mopped without an assist.</p><div>\n            <p><span>\n                What do you think so far?\n            </span>\n        </p></div>\n<div>\n    <p><img src=\"https://lifehacker.com/imagery/articles/01K57198V3E3FABSSYCRSRWCH6/images-3.fill.size_2000x1125.v1757951599.jpg\" alt=\"Roborock Saros 10R\" srcset=\"https://lifehacker.com/imagery/articles/01K57198V3E3FABSSYCRSRWCH6/images-3.fill.size_800x450.v1757951599.jpg 800w, https://lifehacker.com/imagery/articles/01K57198V3E3FABSSYCRSRWCH6/images-3.fill.size_1400x788.v1757951599.jpg 1400w, https://lifehacker.com/imagery/articles/01K57198V3E3FABSSYCRSRWCH6/images-3.fill.size_2000x1125.v1757951599.jpg 2000w\" />\n            </p>\n            <p><span>The Roborock Saros 10R comes with its own docking station.</span>\n                                        <span>Credit: Roborock</span>\n                    </p>\n    </div>\n<p>These cleaners can be a significant investment.

Using suction to work their way across windows, cleaning and drying as they go, leaving you with window panes free of dust and grime. Again, these tools can be managed via an app, though a bit more manual setup is required to get them in position to start cleaning.</p><p>The Ecovacs Winbot series includes some of the best window cleaning options on the market at the moment.

These pieces of hardware elevate clothes cleaning with a variety of useful and intelligent tricks, including the ability to adjust cleaning and drying cycles to the type and size of load, remote control via mobile apps, and a number of self-maintaining mechanisms.</p><p>A good example is the <a href=\"https://zdcs.link/9YMkVn?pageview_type=Standard&template=Explainers&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=LG%20WM6700HBA&short_url=9YMkVn&u=https%3A%2F%2Flifehacker.com%2Fhome%2Fall-the-smart-gadgets-for-a-self-cleaning-home&event_label=LG%20WM6700HBA\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"open in a new window\">LG WM6700HBA</a>, which will set you back $1,250. There's on-board AI assistance to work out the best cycles for the clothes you're washing, an automatic dispenser for just the right amount of detergent and fabric softener to cut down on waste, and remote operations and monitoring via the LG ThinQ app.</p><h3>Smart dishwashers</h3><p>Finally we have <strong>smart dishwashers</strong>, which use automated technology to give your crockery and cutlery a better clean than standard appliances might. The features are similar to those you'll find on smart washers and dryers: Sensing technology for understanding what's been loaded in and adjusting the cleaning accordingly, remote app control and smart home integration, and as much automated maintenance and self-cleaning as possible.</p><p>Take a look at the <a href=\"https://zdcs.link/98PJqd?pageview_type=Standard&template=Explainers&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=Bosch%20500%20Series&short_url=98PJqd&u=https%3A%2F%2Flifehacker.com%2Fhome%2Fall-the-smart-gadgets-for-a-self-cleaning-home&event_label=Bosch%20500%20Series\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"open in a new window\">Bosch 500 Series</a>, which is priced at $1,250 at the time of writing.

iPhone and iPad.</li>\n                                            <li>The app works similarly to how it does on Mac, with the option to scan, edit, markup, and export documents.</li>\n                                            <li>There is definitely room for improvement, however.</li>\n                                    </ol>\n            </div>\n    <h2 id=\"toc\">Table of Contents</h2>\n    <article>\n        <hr />\n        <p>Your iPhone is essentially a computer that fits in your pocket, so it only makes sense for Apple to treat it as such. To that point, with <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/tech/the-best-five-ios-26-features\" target=\"_blank\">iOS 26</a>, both the iPhone and the iPad get a new app that was a Mac exclusive for over 20 years: Preview. </p><h2 id=\"what-can-you-do-with-the-preview-app\">What can you do with the Preview app?</h2><p>Like on macOS, the Preview app for iOS and iPadOS is largely made for viewing PDFs and other documents. When you first open the app, you'll see the options to either create a new document or scan one with your iPhone's camera. </p><p>Most of the time, however, you probably you have an existing document you want to open using Preview. If so, you'll find those options in the bottom half of this starting page. This is Preview's integration with the Files app: You can browse your documents from Files and open any with Preview.</p><div>\n        <p><img src=\"https://lifehacker.com/images/short-lifehacker-logo.jpg\" alt=\"Lifehacker Logo\" /></p><div>\n            <p><span>You May Also Like</span></p>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n<p>Once you have a document loaded up, you're able to view, annotate, markup, and edit it. If you need to fill out a document with your information, you can use AutoFill to automatically enter contact info and other saved details. You can add your signature, and if you're on your iPad, you can use your Apple Pencil to draw on the document. Otherwise, you can use your finger to mark up the file. </p><p>You can also export documents from the Preview app. You can work with file types including HEIDC, JPEG, PDF, PNG, and TIFF. And as with Preview on macOS, there are a number of controls when exporting, such as resolution, embedding text, and saving images as JPEG.</p><p>While there's a lot you can do here, the biggest strength I see for this mobile Preview app is using it as a tool for legal documents. If you need to sign an important document, you can quickly scan it into the app, add your signature, fill out any information—perhaps automatically with AutoFill—then email the doc out, all without needing to jump to your computer.</p><h2 id=\"preview-on-ios-is-still-a-work-in-progress\">Preview on iOS is still a work in progress</h2><p>If you look at <a href=\"https://apps.apple.com/us/app/preview/id536344167?platform=iphone\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"open in a new window\">Preview's App Store page</a>, you'll notice some mixed reviews. After using the app for a bit, I understand why. Preview for iOS is definitely still a work in progress and in need of some key upgrades.</p><div>\n            <p><span>\n                What do you think so far?\n            </span>\n        </p></div>\n<p>The biggest quirks I noticed immediately: The main menu page is cluttered, with the Files integration looking more like a glitch than a dedicated window. Speaking of Files, Apple made the decision to have documents in Files open in Preview. At first, that sounds like a good idea, until you experience it in person on both iOS and iPadOS. Being dragged out of the Files app when you're not expecting it is jarring, especially when you're used to viewing your docs directly in the app. </p><p>The workaround here is to avoid Files for opening, well, files. Use the Files integration within Preview, so you stay in the same app. How intuitive. You could also choose to delete the Preview app, but that's a bit of a shame when it's such a major update for iOS and iPadOS 26.</p><p>Also, when you choose the Markup option, there's no clear way to exit without closing the whole app first. As far as I can tell, the only way to do so is to tap the three-dots in the top right, then tap Markup to exit this menu. The Markup button should really stay on screen as it does on macOS, so it's obvious how to dismiss it.    </p>\n            </article>\n    </div>\n<div>\n    <div>\n        <p><span>The Download Newsletter</span>\n            <span>Never miss a tech story</span>\n        </p>\n        <p><img src=\"https://lifehacker.com/images/team/Jake.png\" alt=\"Jake Peterson portrait\" />\n            <span>Jake Peterson\n            </span>\n            <span>Senior tech editor</span>\n        </p>\n        <p><span>Get the latest tech news, <span></span>reviews, <span></span>and advice from Jake and the team.</span>\n    </p></div>\n    <div>\n        <p><span>The Download Newsletter</span>\n            <span><span>Never miss a tech story.</span> Get the latest tech news, <span></span>reviews, <span></span>and advice from Jake and the team.</span>\n        </p>\n    </div>\n</div>\n    </div>\n            <div>\n                <p><span>\n                        Keep Scrolling for Next Article\n                    </span>\n                </p>\n            </div>\n        </div>\n    </div>"

When the feature is enabled, Maps will take note of places you visit, even if you don't use Maps to get there. It's like a passive, automatic journal, taking note of restaurants, malls, parks, or simply general locations you venture to day-to-day. <a href=\"https://support.apple.com/guide/iphone/view-and-mange-visited-places-iph0c2597c4f/ios\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"open in a new window\">According to Apple</a>, all of this information is stored on your synced devices only, and is end-to-end encrypted, which means Apple has no way to access this data. </p><div>\n        <p><img src=\"https://lifehacker.com/images/short-lifehacker-logo.jpg\" alt=\"Lifehacker Logo\" /></p><div>\n            <p><span>You May Also Like</span></p>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n<p>If you have the feature enabled, you'll find your Visited Places appropriately tucked away in the \"Places\" menu when you launch Maps. I've only had the feature turned on for a day or so, so I only have three locations currently saved, but all three were destinations I visited without using Maps to guide me there. </p><p>Personally, I have no issue with keeping this setting turned on: Nobody has access to the data except for me, and I can imagine it reminding me of the places I've enjoyed visiting during a future scroll.</p><div>\n            <p><span>\n                What do you think so far?\n            </span>\n        </p></div>\n<p>Apple says you will be asked to turn on the feature when you open Maps after updating to iOS 26, and, in my experience, that was the case. However, <a href=\"https://www.cnet.com/tech/services-and-software/your-iphones-maps-app-is-tracking-you-in-ios-26-heres-how-to-stop-it/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"open in a new window\">for CNET writer Zachary McAuliffe</a>, the feature was already enabled without his input. As such, it might be smart to double-check that the feature is set to whichever setting you prefer, lest you allow Maps to track your movements without your knowledge. </p><h2 id=\"how-to-manage-visited-places-in-apple-maps\">How to manage 'Visited Places' in Apple Maps  </h2><p>To check whether the feature is turned on or off, head to <strong>Settings > Apps > Maps > Location</strong>. Alternatively, you can go to <strong>Settings > Privacy & Security > Location Services > Maps</strong>. Either way, check the toggle next to \"Visited Places.\" </p><p>You can also delete any Visited Places without needing to turn the feature off altogether. Open Maps, tap \"Places,\" then \"Visited Places.\" Here, you can swipe left on any place to delete it, or choose \"Clear History\" to delete them all. Plus, you can choose how long you want Maps to store your Visited Places: The default is \"Forever,\" but you can also select \"3 Months\" or \"1 Year,\" if you wish. </p>\n            </article>\n    </div>\n<div>\n    <div>\n        <p><span>The Download Newsletter</span>\n            <span>Never miss a tech story</span>\n        </p>\n        <p><img src=\"https://lifehacker.com/images/team/Jake.png\" alt=\"Jake Peterson portrait\" />\n            <span>Jake Peterson\n            </span>\n            <span>Senior tech editor</span>\n        </p>\n        <p><span>Get the latest tech news, <span></span>reviews, <span></span>and advice from Jake and the team.</span>\n    </p></div>\n    <div>\n        <p><span>The Download Newsletter</span>\n            <span><span>Never miss a tech story.</span> Get the latest tech news, <span></span>reviews, <span></span>and advice from Jake and the team.</span>\n        </p>\n    </div>\n</div>\n    </div>\n            <div>\n                <p><span>\n                        Keep Scrolling for Next Article\n                    </span>\n                </p>\n            </div>\n        </div>"

I've been using smart lights for the better part of a decade and I can't go back to typical lights. </p><p>There are several brands of smart lights from companies like Philips, GE, Wyze, and more that can turn any lamp or light fixture into smart home-controlled lighting. You can use your phone, smart speakers like <a href=\"https://zdcs.link/aADXP4?pageview_type=Standard&template=Explainers&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=Amazon%27s%20Echo&short_url=aADXP4&u=https%3A%2F%2Flifehacker.com%2Fhome%2Fthe-beginners-guide-to-smart-lights&event_label=Amazon%27s%20Echo\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"open in a new window\"><u>Amazon's Echo</u></a> line, or <a href=\"https://zdcs.link/ao6pme?pageview_type=Standard&template=Explainers&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=Google%27s%20Nest&short_url=ao6pme&u=https%3A%2F%2Flifehacker.com%2Fhome%2Fthe-beginners-guide-to-smart-lights&event_label=Google%27s%20Nest\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"open in a new window\"><u>Google's Nest</u></a> speakers. </p><h2 id=\"the-best-smart-light-brands-right-now\">The best smart light brands right now</h2>\n<p>Several major brands manufacture smart lights and, while it is technically possible to mix and match bulbs from different companies, it's easier if you stick to one ecosystem. With that in mind, here are a few of the most established companies and the benefits of each:</p>\n<ul><li><p><strong>The reigning champion: <a href=\"https://zdcs.link/QWEZPd?pageview_type=Standard&template=Explainers&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=Philips%20Hue&short_url=QWEZPd&u=https%3A%2F%2Flifehacker.com%2Fhome%2Fthe-beginners-guide-to-smart-lights&event_label=Philips%20Hue\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"open in a new window\"><u>Philips Hue</u></a></strong><strong>.</strong> These are the lights I personally use. Philips Hue is the most established competitor, with a massive array of bulbs, light strips, lamps and other lighting gear. Its software suite is also one of the most developed, with robust automation tools and colorful scene libraries. Historically, it's also been the most expensive system, but the company recently announced <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/smart-home/768554/philips-hue-essentials-smart-lighting-cheaper-support-matter-thread\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"open in a new window\"><u>a line of cheaper bulbs</u></a>.</p></li><li><p><strong>An inexpensive entry point: <a href=\"https://zdcs.link/9gjB6G?pageview_type=Standard&template=Explainers&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=Wiz&short_url=9gjB6G&u=https%3A%2F%2Flifehacker.com%2Fhome%2Fthe-beginners-guide-to-smart-lights&event_label=Wiz\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"open in a new window\"><u>Wiz</u></a></strong><strong>. </strong>If you don't want to spend $50 per light bulb in your home—and who can blame you?—Wiz is an affordable alternative to Hue. The company offers full-color bulbs that start as low as around $12 per bulb, in a variety of form factors.</p></li><li><p><strong>For stylistic flair: <a href=\"https://zdcs.link/QVEZP3?pageview_type=Standard&template=Explainers&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=LIFX&short_url=QVEZP3&u=https%3A%2F%2Flifehacker.com%2Fhome%2Fthe-beginners-guide-to-smart-lights&event_label=LIFX\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"open in a new window\"><u>LIFX</u></a></strong><strong>.</strong> Similar to Philips Hue, LIFX is a bit more expensive, but the company offers a wide variety of unique, stylish lights, like <a href=\"https://zdcs.link/QKq2PV?pageview_type=Standard&template=Explainers&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=colorful%20tube%20bulbs&short_url=QKq2PV&u=https%3A%2F%2Flifehacker.com%2Fhome%2Fthe-beginners-guide-to-smart-lights&event_label=colorful%20tube%20bulbs\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"open in a new window\"><u>colorful tube bulbs</u></a>, or <a href=\"https://zdcs.link/9YMXPn?pageview_type=Standard&template=Explainers&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=flexible%20LED%20strips&short_url=9YMXPn&u=https%3A%2F%2Flifehacker.com%2Fhome%2Fthe-beginners-guide-to-smart-lights&event_label=flexible%20LED%20strips\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"open in a new window\"><u>flexible LED strips</u></a>. </p></li><li><p><strong>For customizable lighting arrays: <a href=\"https://zdcs.link/98PKkd?pageview_type=Standard&template=Explainers&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=Nanoleaf&short_url=98PKkd&u=https%3A%2F%2Flifehacker.com%2Fhome%2Fthe-beginners-guide-to-smart-lights&event_label=Nanoleaf\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"open in a new window\"><u>Nanoleaf</u></a></strong><strong>.</strong> While Nanoleaf technically makes its own series of typical <a href=\"https://zdcs.link/QPVdPP?pageview_type=Standard&template=Explainers&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=smart%20light%20bulbs&short_url=QPVdPP&u=https%3A%2F%2Flifehacker.com%2Fhome%2Fthe-beginners-guide-to-smart-lights&event_label=smart%20light%20bulbs\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"open in a new window\"><u>smart light bulbs</u></a>, the company is best known for its modular lighting kits. These kits come in shapes like <a href=\"https://zdcs.link/911KNn?pageview_type=Standard&template=Explainers&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=hexagons&short_url=911KNn&u=https%3A%2F%2Flifehacker.com%2Fhome%2Fthe-beginners-guide-to-smart-lights&event_label=hexagons\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"open in a new window\"><u>hexagons</u></a>, <a href=\"https://zdcs.link/aeKnO2?pageview_type=Standard&template=Explainers&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=lines&short_url=aeKnO2&u=https%3A%2F%2Flifehacker.com%2Fhome%2Fthe-beginners-guide-to-smart-lights&event_label=lines\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"open in a new window\"><u>lines</u></a>, <a href=\"https://zdcs.link/QLMdPo?pageview_type=Standard&template=Explainers&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=blocks&short_url=QLMdPo&u=https%3A%2F%2Flifehacker.com%2Fhome%2Fthe-beginners-guide-to-smart-lights&event_label=blocks\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"open in a new window\"><u>blocks</u></a>, and more. Each piece can be individually controlled, and you can combine them to make your own designs for wall lighting. They're not subtle, but they're fun as heck.</p></li></ul><p>These are just a few of the many companies out there producing smart lights. While a few like Philips Hue require dedicated hubs to make their lights work, most companies are now focused on making standalone bulbs that can connect directly to wifi.</p><p>The <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/why-you-need-matter-the-new-open-standard-for-smart-1850826525\" target=\"_blank\"><u>growing Matter standard</u></a> is also (slowly) making it easier to integrate lights from multiple companies. While you'll still likely need to refer to a company's own app or hub to make some changes, Matter-compatible smart lights can usually replace the need to look for \"Works With Google Home\" or similar labels for your specific setup.</p><h2 id=\"what-you-need-to-set-up-smart-lights\">What you need to set up smart lights</h2><p>In most cases, the only thing you'll technically need to set up smart lights is the lights themselves. Most smart light manufacturers at least make bulbs compatible with A19 sockets (the kind in most of your lighting fixtures and lamps), and ecosystems like Wiz, LIFX, and GE's Cync don't require a dedicated hub. Philips Hue, notably, does. And if you're getting into Hue now, you're probably best off <a href=\"https://zdcs.link/9ZMpPM?pageview_type=Standard&template=Explainers&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=getting%20the%20Hue%20Bridge%20Pro&short_url=9ZMpPM&u=https%3A%2F%2Flifehacker.com%2Fhome%2Fthe-beginners-guide-to-smart-lights&event_label=getting%20the%20Hue%20Bridge%20Pro\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"open in a new window\"><u>getting the Hue Bridge Pro</u></a>, which supports syncing lights to your media, using your bulbs as motion sensors, and more new features.</p><p>While that's technically all you <em>need</em> to set up smart lights, there are a few things you can get to make even better use of your new system:</p><ul><li><p><strong>A smart speaker.</strong> I cannot emphasize enough how great it feels to turn your bedroom lights off while tucked snugly under the covers. Voice-controlled speakers like Google Nest and Amazon Echo devices are excellent for this.</p></li><li><p><strong>A smart display.</strong> The one downside to smart lights is that you can't use switches on the walls the same way anymore (more on that later). But a smart display can be a huge improvement. Google Nest Hubs or Amazon Echo Show devices can put an array of controls for your smart lights in a prominent place so anyone in your home can not only turn lights on and off with a tap, but change lighting levels or color scenes.</p></li><li><p><strong>Some smartphone widgets.</strong> While all of the above are convenient, more often than not, you'll probably have your phone on you. Some smart light manufacturers build robust widgets for iPhone and Android devices, so you can tap a button on your home screen to turn your lights on and off. It's worth checking to see which features a company supports before committing to an ecosystem.</p></li></ul><p>The last things you'll need to set up your smart lights are time and patience. While the process has gotten a lot simpler than it was even a few years ago, you might need to spend a bit of time fiddling with room names, syncing services, and testing out a few commands. Fortunately, you usually only need to do this once. I've even moved to a new home and kept my old setup largely intact.</p><h2 id=\"what-you-can-do-with-smart-lights\">What you can do with smart lights</h2><p>\"Okay, sure, smart lights are getting cheaper, but are they really worth the extra money over simple bulbs and a wall switch that's worked for decades?\" I hear you cry. And I'm here to tell you, absolutely, yes. I've used a lot of new tech over the years that's fun at first, but annoying once the novelty wears off. But smart lights are one of the few areas where I never want to go back.</p><div>\n            <p><span>\n                What do you think so far?\n            </span>\n        </p></div>\n<p>Here are a few of the ways I make use of smart lights on a regular basis:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Change lights with the sun.</strong> During the day, the bright, cool light coming in from your windows has a different quality than the warm, dimmer lights you're used to from lamps. With smart lights, you can set your bulbs to automatically adjust based on a set schedule (or your local sunrise/sunset) to ease the lighting conditions in your home.</p></li><li><p><strong>Set the mood for date night... </strong>Sometimes, all it takes to turn a regular Tuesday night into a romantic evening is a simple shift in mood lighting. I have a few scenes in my Philips Hue app saved for when I want to create some nice ambiance for my partner when we're having a chill evening in.</p></li><li><p><strong>…or for self-care.</strong> Similar to the above, one of my favorite Hue scenes is an animation that mimics the flickering of candlelight. Set the lights in your bathroom to this scene, draw a warm bath, toss in a bath bomb, and have the most relaxing night in.</p></li><li><p><strong>Simulate activity while you're away. </strong>One of the best ways to make a local burglar think twice about trying to enter your home is to convince them someone is there. With lighting schedules, you can set your home to turn lights on and off even while you're away.</p></li><li><p><strong>Turn lights on automatically for you.</strong> Ever trip over things in the dark while you're bringing in groceries? No more. Most smart light ecosystems allow you to automatically turn on certain lights when you enter a geofenced area (like your home). Alternatively, some suites like Philips Hue have motion-sensing features so you can turn lights on when you enter a room, without relying on tools like GPS.</p></li></ul><p>With <a href=\"https://ifttt.com/explore/smart-lights-collection\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"open in a new window\"><u>automation services like IFTTT</u></a>, you can even set up more complex controls—e.g., flashing lights when your doorbell rings, or blinking a light in your office when you get an email from your boss.</p><h2 id=\"smart-light-switches-make-it-all-even-easier\">Smart light switches make it all even easier</h2>\n<p>When I first set up smart lights in my home, my loved ones were mostly on board, but there was one point of contention: the light switch. People are still generally used to flipping switches when they enter a room. With smart lights, they generally need to stay on all the time, and you even need to retrain your muscle memory a bit to not forget and accidentally turn them off manually.</p><p>There are two main ways to fix this in the smart home world, and which one you need can depend on how much effort you want to put in (and, frankly, whether you rent or own your home):</p><ul><li><p><strong>In-wall smart light switches.</strong> Some smart light switches, like <a href=\"https://zdcs.link/aADXk4?pageview_type=Standard&template=Explainers&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=this%20one%20from%20LIFX&short_url=aADXk4&u=https%3A%2F%2Flifehacker.com%2Fhome%2Fthe-beginners-guide-to-smart-lights&event_label=this%20one%20from%20LIFX\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"open in a new window\"><u>this one from LIFX</u></a> can be installed directly in place of your existing light switches. This one lets you turn a light on or off from the wall switch, without cutting off the ability to turn it back on from a voice command or smart phone app. Since it also replaces the old switch, there's less need to adjust your muscle memory.</p></li><li><p><strong>Remote control switches.</strong> If you don't want to (or can't) replace your in-wall light switches, companies like Philips Hue offer a handy alternative in the form of <a href=\"https://zdcs.link/aN8bP3?pageview_type=Standard&template=Explainers&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=remote%20switches&short_url=aN8bP3&u=https%3A%2F%2Flifehacker.com%2Fhome%2Fthe-beginners-guide-to-smart-lights&event_label=remote%20switches\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"open in a new window\"><u>remote switches</u></a>. These provide buttons you can use to turn on/off or dim lights from a battery-powered remote. This model in particular comes with a plate you can stick on your wall next to your regular switch, while the remote is removable so you can take it with you around the room. It uses sticky pads and magnets for mounting, so you can safely put it up in an apartment and take it with you when you move.</p></li></ul><p>Strictly speaking, smart light switches are optional. That's part of the appeal of smart lights, after all. But if you live in a home with multiple people, and if you have guests over who might not have access to your lighting controls, a physical switch can be a handy addition.</p>\n            </article>\n    <div>\n    <div>\n        <p><span>Smarter Home & Living <span>Newsletter</span></span>\n            <span>Never miss a story</span>\n        </p>\n        <p><img src=\"https://lifehacker.com/images/team/Lindsey.png\" alt=\"Lindsey Ellefson portrait\" />\n            <span>Lindsey Ellefson\n            </span>\n        </p>\n        <p><span><span>Get the latest smart home news, trends,</span> <span>and advice from Lindsey and the team.</span></span>\n    </p></div>\n    <div>\n        <p><span>Smarter Home & Living <span>Newsletter</span></span>\n            <span><span>Never miss a story.</span> <span>Get the latest smart home news, trends,</span> <span>and advice from Lindsey and the team.</span></span>\n        </p>\n    </div>\n</div>\n                        <div>\n                <div>\n                    <p><img src=\"https://lifehacker.com/imagery/authors/01HF2FBCTTAXSPT16PPXAXT850/image.fill.size_150x150.v1699836235.jpg\" alt=\"author image\" />\n                                            </p>\n                </div>\n                <div>\n                                            <div>\n    <p>More by Eric</p>\n        <hr />\n        </div>\n                        <div>\n                <p><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://lifehacker.com/home/best-smart-home-gear-entertainment-system\">\n                    <img src=\"https://lifehacker.com/imagery/articles/01K57HA8Q8665JNPEF4CQFDQ41/hero-image.fill.size_75x75.v1759155124.jpg\" alt=\"TV screen with gears in front\" />\n                </a>\n            </p></div>\n        <hr />\n                    <div>\n                <p><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://lifehacker.com/tech/pixel-watch-3-labor-day-sale-2025\">\n                    <img src=\"https://lifehacker.com/imagery/articles/01K3VGYYH3YY3KKHA8HFWJSDT0/hero-image.fill.size_75x75.v1756493346.png\" alt=\"A Pixel Watch 3 on a table\" />\n                </a>\n            </p></div>\n        <hr />\n                                        </div>\n            </div>\n                                </section>\n                                                </section>"

/><p>The whole point of studying is to retain information you’ll need later in life, even if it’s just for an impending test on a subject you may never think about again in the future. That’s not easy when you’re taking in a bunch of unfamiliar phrases and concepts—which is why you need a quality method to structure your study sessions. Try the SQ3R technique next time you’re studying, and see the difference it can make.</p><h2 id=\"what-is-the-sq3r-study-method\">What is the SQ3R study method?</h2><p>I touched on a similar method briefly before when <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/best-note-taking-methods-1849535943\" target=\"_blank\">advising on best note-taking practices</a>, but SQ3R has applications well beyond the moments when you’re taking notes in (<a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/revise-your-notes-before-you-leave-class-1850774684\" target=\"_blank\">and after</a>) class. It’s actually a reading comprehension technique that was first introduced in 1946 by Francis P. Robinson in his book <a href=\"https://zdcs.link/neNeq?pageview_type=Standard&template=Explainers&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=Effective%20Study&short_url=neNeq&u=https%3A%2F%2Flifehacker.com%2Fhow-to-use-the-sq3r-study-method&event_label=Effective%20Study\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"open in a new window\"><em>Effective Study</em></a>. (Fun side note: The “P” stands for Pleasant!)</p><div>\n        <p><img src=\"https://lifehacker.com/images/short-lifehacker-logo.jpg\" alt=\"Lifehacker Logo\" /></p><div>\n            <p><span>You May Also Like</span></p>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n<p>SQ3R has withstood the test of time and is now widely recommended by academic counselors on campuses across the country. It’s named for the five steps involved in the method:</p><ul><li><p>Survey</p></li><li><p>Question</p></li><li><p>Read</p></li><li><p>Recite</p></li><li><p>Review</p></li></ul><h2 id=\"how-does-sq3r-work\">How does SQ3R work?</h2><p>It’s important, first of all, to chunk up your work here. The goal is not to do this with an entire textbook or a bunch of materials, but to go chapter by chapter or section by section. You'll see why as you move through the steps, but just bear in mind you want to be hyper-focused on smaller sections. In general, chunking up your review work is a recommended practice and it works well with SQ3R and all kinds of other study approaches, so be sure to <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/how-to-study-better-with-the-chunking-method\" target=\"_blank\">brush up on it</a> while you're restructuring your study approach. </p><h3>Survey</h3><p>You <strong>survey</strong> your materials first, skimming them just enough to grasp what the overall idea is. Look at the chapter title, intros and conclusions, headings, sub-headings, graphics, tables, and summaries, but don’t read the whole thing. </p><p>You can also call on contextual details here. If you got assigned to read this chapter in a lecture, think back on that class, especially on anything the teacher mentioned as being important. Go through any slideshows they uploaded as supplemental material, as well as any existing notes you have. Again, just skim, but get an idea of what, broadly, this section is about.</p><h3>Question</h3><p>Then, you come up with <strong>questions</strong>, like, “What is this section about?” or, “How will I use this information in real life?” The questions can be more specific than that and depend a lot on what the content of your chapter is. </p><p>An easy trick is to turn subheadings into questions. If your subheading just says, “The assassination of Franz Ferdinand,” your question can be, “What were the immediate impacts of the assassination of Franz Ferdinand?” </p><p>Something I like to do is ask myself, \"How might this appear on a test?\" If I'm reading about the founder of a movement, for instance, and they were born in a certain country in a particular year and those details were relevant to their rise to power, I'd assume there would be a question on that on the test, so I might be able to focus my studying better if I can anticipate that.</p><h3>Read</h3><p>Jot the questions down before moving on to the third step, which is finally <strong>reading</strong> the whole chapter or section, paying attention to anything that might answer your questions. Take notes.</p><p>What helps here is writing the answers you find in the material directly under the questions you wrote down. Typically, I advocate for <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/dont-use-laptop-to-take-notes-in-class\" target=\"_blank\">taking handwritten notes</a> and studying with a pen and paper whenever possible, but here, you may find that you don't have enough room to answer the questions you write down or take notes on new information you find while reading. To be on the safe side (and stop yourself from making a disorganized, scribbled-out and erased-up mess) go ahead and use a word processing document for your questions and answers. </p><div>\n            <p><span>\n                What do you think so far?\n            </span>\n        </p></div>\n<h3>Recitation</h3><p>The next step is <strong>recitation</strong>. Use your own words to explain the contents of what you studied and answer your own questions. Pretend you’re explaining it to someone else or even write it all down in a small essay format. </p><p>If you write it all down as a small essay, you'll be using the <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/two-ways-to-use-the-blurting-method-to-study-1850999140\" target=\"_blank\">\"blurting\" method</a>, or at least a variation of it. Blurting asks you to remember everything you can about a topic, then say or write it somewhere before checking your notes and materials for anything you missed. It <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/use-these-active-recall-techniques-the-next-time-you-st-1850797753\" target=\"_blank\">forces active recall</a>, or the act of digging something out of your memory. Here, don't feel too much pressure to remember everything; treat this more like an open-book test, especially if it's your first time through your review. You can use other techniques, like the <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/leitner-system-flashcard-studying\" target=\"_blank\">Leitner flashcard method</a>, to entrench the answers you find in your memory once you've got a grasp of the overall theme of the section. </p><p>You can also go a step further and actually explain the material to someone. That's <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/how-to-use-the-feynman-method-to-study\" target=\"_blank\">the Feynman method</a>, which has you act like a teacher describing the content to someone who knows nothing about it. You can do this with a parent, a friend, or <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/the-best-ways-to-study-but-not-cheat-using-ai-tools\" target=\"_blank\">even ChatGPT</a>. It helps you break the material down into easy-to-understand parts. If you don't understand something well enough to teach it to someone else, you don't understand it well at all. But again, incorporate this over time. You don't need to be ready for this step on your first run-through with SQ3R. It's just an easy way to gauge how well you're mastering a concept. </p><h3>Review</h3><p>Finally, <strong>review</strong> what you read, wrote, and/or said before starting the process again on another chapter. Feel free to move to another chapter or section before you have a firm grasp of the current one, too. <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/why-you-should-actually-study-multiple-topics-at-the-sa-1850438252\" target=\"_blank\">Called interleaving</a>, this practice of studying multiple concepts or ideas at once can force you to make connections between material and better understand both topics than if you were tackling them individually. </p><p>The purpose of all of this is to get you thinking critically and help you stay engaged as you read, hunting for the answers to your questions. From there, you can branch off into the other techniques I mentioned, like Leitner and Feynman, because you created a solid base of chunks of information—questions and answers from the text, essentially—to study. </p><h2 id=\"best-practices-with-sq3r\">Best practices with SQ3R</h2><p>I mentioned earlier that you might want to use a word processor or notes app for this, so you don't run out of space or get frustrated. You do have other options if handwriting and its benefits appeal to you. In that case, I recommend picking up <a href=\"https://zdcs.link/Q4bqgy?pageview_type=Standard&template=Explainers&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=a%20SQ3R%20notebook&short_url=Q4bqgy&u=https%3A%2F%2Flifehacker.com%2Fhow-to-use-the-sq3r-study-method&event_label=a%20SQ3R%20notebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"open in a new window\">a SQ3R notebook</a>. It's only $6, and it provides designated spaces for the different steps; plus, since the sections are pre-defined, it forces you to take on your work in smaller chunks because you don't have room on the page to try to do too much at once. Play around with different methods, from digital to notebook, to see what works for you and the material you study. </p><p>Finally, don't assume you've reached the end of studying when you hit the review portion of SQ3R. Studying is a long-term endeavor, so that \"review\" part is actually ongoing from the time you first get acquainted with the material. After you finish your first round of SQ3R, study the materials periodically, every few days. If, after a few reviews, you feel like you're not grasping the material as well as you want to, try the SQ3R method again on the same chunk of text you already did, formulating different questions and looking for other angles. Once you're more familiar with the topics, you'll come up with more in-depth questions, so repeating SQ3R a few times over a semester is a smart strategy.</p>\n            </article>\n    </div>\n<div>\n    <div>\n        <p><span>The Daily Newsletter</span>\n            <span>Ready to do everything better?</span>\n        </p>\n        <p><img src=\"https://lifehacker.com/images/team/Jordan.png\" alt=\"Jordan Calhoun portrait\" />\n            <span>Jordan Calhoun\n            </span>\n            <span>Editor in chief</span>\n        </p>\n        <p><span><span>Get daily tips, tricks, <span>and tech guides</span></span> <span>from Jordan and the team.</span></span>\n    </p></div>\n    <div>\n        <p><span>The Daily Newsletter</span>\n            <span><span>Ready to do everything better?</span> <span>Get daily tips, tricks, <span>and tech guides</span></span> <span>from Jordan and the team.</span></span>\n        </p>\n    </div>\n</div>\n    </div>\n            <div>\n                <p><span>\n                        Keep Scrolling for Next Article\n                    </span>\n                </p>\n            </div>\n        </div>\n    </div>"

    "body": "<article>\n        <hr />\n        <p><em>Did you know you can customize Google to filter out garbage? <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/tech/you-can-now-tell-google-which-websites-you-prefer-search-results\" target=\"_blank\">Take these steps</a></em><em> for better search results, <a href=\"https://www.google.com/preferences/source?q=lifehacker.com\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"open in a new window\">including adding my work at Lifehacker as a preferred source</a></em><em>.</em></p><hr /><p>My omnipotent social media algorithms know I'm a sucker for trendy fitness content. What's interesting about today's fitness influencers is they sound nothing like the boot camp battle cries of the past decade. Quite the opposite, really. Instead of \"no pain, no gain,\" think soft lighting, cozy socks, and your favorite comfort show playing in the background. Welcome to \"<a href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/discover/cozy-cardio?lang=en\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"open in a new window\">Cozy Cardio</a>\"—TikTok's antidote to workout burnout.</p><p>\"Cozy cardio\" is all about prioritizing comfort and enjoyment over intensity and intimidation. If you've ever felt like traditional fitness culture wasn't for you, this gentler philosophy might be exactly what you need to rediscover the joy of moving your body.</p>\n<h2 id=\"what-is-cozy-cardio\">What is cozy cardio?</h2><p>Picture this: You're in your softest sweatpants, a candle is flickering nearby, your favorite show is queued up, and you're walking on a treadmill or pedaling on a stationary bike—not to hit a specific target or beat a personal record, but simply to move. At its core, the \"cozy\" in cozy cardio is about creating a low-pressure, comfortable environment for low-impact cardiovascular exercise. </p><p>This trend began with TikTok creator <a href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/@hope_zuckerbrow?lang=en\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"open in a new window\"><u>Hope Zuckerbrow</u></a> back in 2022, who coined the term when she started posting her early-morning cardio routines. It regularly crops up again and again, with creators sharing their relaxed workout setups, complete with mood lighting, comforting beverages, and zero pressure to push past their limits. The message behind all these video is that if you feel alienated by high-intensity workout culture, well, get cozy with it.</p><p>Celebrity trainer <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/plantbasedboxer/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"open in a new window\">Kollins Ezekh</a> sees a clear reason for its popularity: \"I think it's taking off because it makes working out feel less like a chore. For years, fitness was pushed as 'go hard or go home.' Cozy Cardio flips that—it's about moving your body in a way that feels good, not punishing. People can finally picture themselves enjoying the process, and that's powerful.\"</p><h2 id=\"why-cozy-cardio-might-work-for-you\">Why cozy cardio might work for you</h2><p>Traditional fitness culture often frames exercise as something you must <em>endure</em>—a punishment for eating dessert or a means to \"earn\" your rest. This creates a negative association with movement, making it feel like one more demanding item on an endless to-do list.</p><p>What I love about cozy cardio is that it reframes exercise as self-care rather than self-correction. By pairing movement with comforting elements, it becomes something you actually look forward to—a peaceful ritual, rather than an obligation.</p><p>Ezekh emphasizes the importance of environment in this shift: \"The atmosphere matters. If you dim the lights, light a candle, or throw on your favorite show while you move, it creates a calming routine. You're still getting the endorphins from exercise, but the cozy setting tells your body to relax. It turns a workout into something that helps you decompress instead of adding more stress to your day.\"</p><p>Personally, I've found low-impact cardio still delivers in terms of mental benefits. And this is coming from someone who loves already high-intensity cardio. But it's regular walking, light cycling, or gentle movement that seriously boosts my mood and reduces stress. Plus, it comes without the joint strain or exhaustion that I risk with my high-intensity training.</p><h2 id=\"how-to-create-your-own-cozy-cardio-routine\">How to create your own cozy cardio routine</h2><p>Ready to embrace this kinder approach to fitness? Here's how to build a cozy cardio practice that actually sticks.</p><p><strong>Set the mood: </strong>Transform your workout space into a sanctuary. Dim the overhead lights or use lamps for softer illumination. Light a candle with your favorite scent. Play calming music, an engaging podcast, or binge-worthy television. The goal is to create an environment where you feel relaxed and at ease, not on edge or pressured.</p><p><strong>Choose comfortable movement: </strong>Select low-impact activities that feel sustainable: walking on a treadmill, using a stationary bike, stepping in place, gentle dancing, or using an under-desk elliptical. The intensity should feel manageable—you should be able to <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/health/talk-test-better-than-heart-rate-zones\" target=\"_blank\">hold a conversation</a> while moving.</p><p><strong>Dress for comfort: </strong>Forget restrictive athletic wear if it doesn't serve you. Wear your softest loungewear, favorite oversized hoodie, or whatever makes you feel cozy. The only requirement is that your clothing allows you to move freely.</p><div>\n            <p><span>\n                What do you think so far?\n            </span>\n        </p></div>\n<p><strong>Start small and build consistency. </strong>Ezekh advises keeping expectations realistic: \"Keep it simple—walk on a treadmill while watching Netflix, hop on a bike with a podcast, or do light movement in the evening instead of scrolling your phone. Even 10–15 minutes goes a long way. Results come from consistency, not punishment, and cozy cardio makes it easier to show up again and again.\"</p><p><strong>Make it a ritual: </strong>Designate a specific time for your cozy cardio session. Perhaps first thing in the morning with coffee, during your lunch break, or as an evening wind-down. When it becomes a predictable, pleasant part of your routine, you're more likely to maintain it.</p><p><strong>Remove the pressure:</strong> <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/health/how-ditching-my-fitness-watch-changed-the-way-i-run\" target=\"_blank\">Let go of tracking every metric</a>. You don't need to monitor your heart rate, count calories burned, or beat yesterday's performance. If you feel like going for twenty minutes instead of thirty, that's perfectly fine. The point is to move in a way that feels nurturing, not demanding.</p><h2 id=\"the-bottom-line\">The bottom line</h2><p>Personally, I'm a huge fan of this sort of cultural shift in how we approach wellness. It acknowledges that not everyone thrives in competitive fitness environments, that movement shouldn't feel punitive, and that exercise is most sustainable when it's actually enjoyable.</p><p>This trend is particularly valuable for people who are rebuilding their relationship with movement after injury, illness, burnout, or disordered exercise patterns. It offers an entry point that feels safe and accessible, removing the intimidation factor that keeps many people from starting at all.</p><p>Of course, cozy cardio isn't meant to replace all forms of exercise. Those who enjoy high-intensity workouts or competitive sports should absolutely continue those pursuits. But for the countless people who have struggled to maintain a consistent exercise routine because traditional fitness culture felt overwhelming or uninviting, this gentler approach offers a genuine alternative.</p><p>The fitness industry has long operated on the assumption that motivation comes from pushing harder, going faster, and doing more. Cozy cardio suggests something different: that sometimes, the most powerful motivation comes from making movement feel like something you don't want to miss—because it's become the most peaceful, comforting part of your day.</p><p>In a world that constantly demands more from us, there's something quietly revolutionary about a fitness trend that asks for less—less intensity, less pressure, less punishment—and offers more: more enjoyment, more sustainability, and more compassion toward yourself. So dim those lights, turn on your favorite show, and give yourself permission to move gently. </p>\n            </article>"

source</a></em><em>.</em></p><hr /><p>It's been a tumultuous year and a half for TikTok in the U.S. <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/tech/tiktok-isnt-banned-yet#how-did-we-get-here\" target=\"_blank\">In April of 2024</a>, President Biden signed a law forcing the app's parent company, ByteDance, to sell its majority stake to an American company, or face a ban in the U.S. ByteDance never did, and so, in January, <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/tech/how-to-use-tiktok-if-its-banned-in-the-us\" target=\"_blank\">the app went dark</a>.</p><p>It was mostly performative, however. Then President-elect Trump had already assured TikTok that his incoming administration would not enforce the ban, as did the outgoing President Biden. As such, once Trump was sworn in, he signed an executive order kicking the TikTok ban down the road. Trump continued to delay enforcing the ban, which, <a href=\"https://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/columnist/2025/06/25/trump-tiktok-ban-delay-extended/84323075007/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"open in a new window\">while legally dubious</a>, allowed the app to continue operating as usual. </p><div>\n        <p><img src=\"https://lifehacker.com/images/short-lifehacker-logo.jpg\" alt=\"Lifehacker Logo\" /></p><div>\n            <p><span>You May Also Like</span></p>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n<p>It seems, however, this wild ride is coming to a close. On Thursday, Trump <a href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/09/saving-tiktok-while-protecting-national-security/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"open in a new window\">signed an executive order</a> that sets the stage for a U.S.-majority stake in TikTok. <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2025/09/25/trump-approves-tiktok-deal-through-executive-order.html\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"open in a new window\">Nothing is set in stone</a>, but American companies like Oracle, as well as individuals like Larry Ellison (Oracle co-founder) and Rupert Murdoch could be among the newest owners of the app. Curiously, a non-American company, the Abu Dhabi-based MGX investment fund, would also be involved. This joint venture would control a majority of the new American TikTok, while ByteDance would control less than 20%. </p><p>Trump says Chinese President Xi Jinping has okayed the deal, though no Chinese representatives were present at the order's signing. Again, nothing is for certain at this point, but we can take a look at the early details to get a sense for how a new \"America-approved\" TikTok would operate in the U.S.</p><h2 id=\"how-would-tiktok-change-in-the-us\">How would TikTok change in the US?</h2><p>First things first: the app itself. It's highly possible you'll need to download a new app entirely in order to keep using TikTok. This has been <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/tech/how-tiktoks-new-app-may-affect-you\" target=\"_blank\">a focus of speculation for a couple months now</a>, but <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2025/09/25/tiktok-deal-sale-algorithm-changes/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"open in a new window\">as the Washington Post reports</a>, TikTok engineers have been working on a U.S.-version of the app. The new app will likely appear identical to the TikTok experience you already know, and, in fact, might be accessible via a link within the current app. The Post makes the point that the harder it is for users to access the new TikTok app, the higher the chance they leave the platform entirely for alternatives like Instagram and YouTube, so TikTok engineers will no doubt be working on ways to make the transition as seamless as possible. </p><p>Then, there's the famous algorithm. This is what makes TikTok so addictive; the app's algorithm is so good, it learns what you like and shows you content to keep you scrolling for hours. Without the algorithm, TikTok very well could lose its addictive nature, and, along with it, its users. The Post reports that, at least at this time, the algorithm is staying put, and will be leased out from ByteDance by the new American TikTok venture. Plus, you should still be able to see international content going forward, not just videos posted by Americans. TikTok should, in theory, be as entertaining (and addicting) as ever. </p><div>\n            <p><span>\n                What do you think so far?\n            </span>\n        </p></div>\n<p>But that's not the end of the story. According to Trump's executive order, the algorithm will be \"retrained and monitored\" by \"trusted security partners\" of the U.S. That does not necessarily inspire confidence in a neutral algorithm for Americans, <a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/tech-news/trump-signs-executive-order-tiktok-deal-know-rcna233518\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"open in a new window\">especially as Trump says he would make it \"100% MAGA\" if he could</a>. </p><p>Finally, there's the question of user data. This was a major concern of the U.S. government, and part of why both the Trump and Biden administrations went after the app. <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/tech/tiktok-isnt-banned-yet#how-did-we-get-here\" target=\"_blank\">It wasn't without reason either</a>, as we learned ByteDance did in fact store American user data and had used it to obtain the IP addresses of American journalists. According to the executive order, all user data from the U.S. version of TikTok will need to be stored in a cloud environment operated by an American company.</p><p>We'll need to see how both ByteDance and the Chinese government address the executive order and potential divestiture going forward, as things could change. As of now, however, it seems both nothing will change, and everything will change. You'll still be able to endlessly scroll through your feed as you do now, but you may need to use a new, yet identical version of the app to do so. You may see the same content you do now, or you might start to see some new content, suspiciously aligned with the values of the current administration. And your data will still be controlled by a faceless third-party, only now it'll be by your own country, rather than a foreign nation.</p>\n            </article>\n    </div>\n<div>\n    <div>\n        <p><span>The Download Newsletter</span>\n            <span>Never miss a tech story</span>\n        </p>\n        <p><img src=\"https://lifehacker.com/images/team/Jake.png\" alt=\"Jake Peterson portrait\" />\n            <span>Jake Peterson\n            </span>\n            <span>Senior tech editor</span>\n        </p>\n        <p><span>Get the latest tech news, <span></span>reviews, <span></span>and advice from Jake and the team.</span>\n    </p></div>\n    <div>\n        <p><span>The Download Newsletter</span>\n            <span><span>Never miss a tech story.</span> Get the latest tech news, <span></span>reviews, <span></span>and advice from Jake and the team.</span>\n        </p>\n    </div>\n</div>\n    </div>\n            <div>\n                <p><span>\n                        Keep Scrolling for Next Article\n                    </span>\n                </p>\n            </div>\n        </div>\n    </div>"

As such, in order to interpret menus, signs, and packaging, I needed to translate the text back into English. While you might assume you need to use a specific translator app of choice to get this done, you really only need one thing: your iPhone's camera.</p><p>I, along with all of the people I traveled with, have an iPhone, so I assumed all of us knew about this trick. To my surprise, however, nobody in my party knew about this. So, I'm here to make sure your next international trip is a bit easier. </p><div>\n        <p><img src=\"https://lifehacker.com/images/short-lifehacker-logo.jpg\" alt=\"Lifehacker Logo\" /></p><div>\n            <p><span>You May Also Like</span></p>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n<h2 id=\"translate-text-with-your-iphones-camera\">Translate text with your iPhone's camera </h2><p>The next time you need to translate some text in front of you, instead of heading for Google Translate, Microsoft Translator, or even Apple's own Translate app, just open your Camera app. Frame up the text in the middle of the viewfinder and give your iPhone a moment to \"think.\" If all goes well, you should see a yellow frame appear around the text, and a new button appear in the bottom right of the viewfinder—or top right, if you're holding your iPhone in landscape. </p><p>Tap this button, and iOS will cut out the selected text, and zoom in to bring it into focus. Now, tap the \"Translate\" button that appears in the bottom left (or top left in landscape), wait a moment, and presto: The text is replaced by your target language. As you might guess, for me, that's English, but the feature will translate into whichever system language your iPhone is currently set to.</p><div>\n    <p><img src=\"https://lifehacker.com/imagery/articles/01K60TCH66X4WWW8DBDV6P4GMC/images-1.fill.size_2000x1125.v1758820823.png\" alt=\"translating within the camera app\" srcset=\"https://lifehacker.com/imagery/articles/01K60TCH66X4WWW8DBDV6P4GMC/images-1.fill.size_800x450.v1758820823.png 800w, https://lifehacker.com/imagery/articles/01K60TCH66X4WWW8DBDV6P4GMC/images-1.fill.size_1400x788.v1758820823.png 1400w, https://lifehacker.com/imagery/articles/01K60TCH66X4WWW8DBDV6P4GMC/images-1.fill.size_2000x1125.v1758820823.png 2000w\" />\n            </p>\n            <p><span></span>\n                                        <span>Credit: Lifehacker</span>\n                    </p>\n    </div>\n<p>For many applications, this translation is enough. But there's more you can do with this. If you need to share that translated text somewhere, you can tap the translation to pull up a Translate mini window. Here, you can copy the translation so you can paste it wherever you'd like. You'll also be able to have iOS read either the translation or original text out loud, add the translation to your favorites, or open the translation in the Translate app. </p><p>This hidden perk is part of the iPhone's larger <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/how-to-use-live-text-the-best-new-feature-in-ios-15-1847649795\" target=\"_blank\">Live Text feature</a>, which uses OCR (optical character recognition) to identify text in images. Live Text allows you to select text both in images and within the camera's viewfinder for easy copy and pasting. And, since iOS 16, it allows you to translate that text directly within the camera as well. Since it's powered by the Translate app, it supports the languages the app does, which includes:</p><div>\n            <p><span>\n                What do you think so far?\n            </span>\n        </p></div>\n<ul><li><p>Arabic</p></li><li><p>Chinese (Mandarin, Simplified)</p></li><li><p>Chinese (Mandarin, Traditional)</p></li><li><p>Dutch</p></li><li><p>English (UK)</p></li><li><p>French</p></li><li><p>German</p></li><li><p>Hindi</p></li><li><p>Indonesian</p></li><li><p>Italian</p></li><li><p>Japanese</p></li><li><p>Korean</p></li><li><p>Polish</p></li><li><p>Portuguese (Brazil)</p></li><li><p>Russian</p></li><li><p>Spanish (Spain)</p></li><li><p>Thai</p></li><li><p>Turkish</p></li><li><p>Ukrainian</p></li><li><p>Vietnamese </p></li></ul><p>If this feature isn't working for you, it's likely not turned on. To check, head to <strong>Settings > Camera</strong>, then ensure \"Show Detected Text\" is enabled. </p><h2 id=\"other-ways-to-translate-on-iphone\">Other ways to translate on iPhone</h2><p>This is far from the only way to translate other languages on your iPhone. As previously mentioned, iOS comes with a built-in Translate app, which has its own Camera function as well. But with iOS 26, there's a new translation feature that works seamlessly as you use your iPhone: <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/tech/apple-live-translation-messages-facetime-and-your-phone-calls-wwdc-2025\" target=\"_blank\">Live Translate</a>. </p><p>As the name suggests, Live Translate can translate conversations in real time. This works in Messages with text, but also during FaceTime and phone calls when talking to someone in another language. If you have a compatible pair of AirPods, <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/tech/you-dont-need-to-buy-airpods-pro-3-to-use-live-translation\" target=\"_blank\">you can even use this feature when talking to someone in person</a>: You'll hear their words translated in your ears, and they'll see your words translated on your iPhone's display.</p>\n            </article>\n    </div>\n<div>\n    <div>\n        <p><span>The Download Newsletter</span>\n            <span>Never miss a tech story</span>\n        </p>\n        <p><img src=\"https://lifehacker.com/images/team/Jake.png\" alt=\"Jake Peterson portrait\" />\n            <span>Jake Peterson\n            </span>\n            <span>Senior tech editor</span>\n        </p>\n        <p><span>Get the latest tech news, <span></span>reviews, <span></span>and advice from Jake and the team.</span>\n    </p></div>\n    <div>\n        <p><span>The Download Newsletter</span>\n            <span><span>Never miss a tech story.</span> Get the latest tech news, <span></span>reviews, <span></span>and advice from Jake and the team.</span>\n        </p>\n    </div>\n</div>\n    </div>\n            <div>\n                <p><span>\n                        Keep Scrolling for Next Article\n                    </span>\n                </p>\n            </div>\n        </div>\n    </div>"
