/><p><a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/family/finals-study-methods\" target=\"_blank\">Study methods</a> are usually all about what you can do in your own time to maximize what you learn and that's generally most important, but bringing someone else in to your process can be helpful if done correctly, too. That’s what Richard Feynman, a theoretical physicist, thought—at least in theory. According to many possibly apocryphal sources, the Nobel Prize-winner once said, “If you cannot explain something in simple terms, you don’t understand it. The best way to learn is to teach.” </p><p>It’s entirely possible Feynman never said that at all. <a href=\"https://improbable.com/2022/03/23/explaining-why-spin-1-2-particles-obey-fermi-dirac-statistics/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"open in a new window\">The closest documented quote I could find</a>, courtesy of his colleague and fellow physicist David Goodstein, stated that Feynman’s inability to break a subject (in this case, a complex question of particle physics) down to the level a freshman student could understand it meant that <em>science</em> didn’t effectively understand it. </p><div>\n        <p><img src=\"https://lifehacker.com/images/short-lifehacker-logo.jpg\" alt=\"Lifehacker Logo\" /></p><div>\n            <p><span>You May Also Like</span></p>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n<p>But whether this study method truly came from Feynman or not, the basic principle—to know you truly understand a subject, you should be able to teach it to someone else—is pretty sound. Here’s how the Feynman study method works and how you can use it to master new concepts (just maybe not particle physics, apparently).</p><h2 id=\"what-is-the-feynman-method\">What is the Feynman method?</h2><p>The Feynman study technique is so popular for learning and retaining information that it’s <a href=\"https://www.colorado.edu/artssciences-advising/resource-library/life-skills/the-feynman-technique-in-academic-coaching\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"open in a new window\">recommended to college students</a> and even r<a href=\"https://todoist.com/inspiration/feynman-technique\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"open in a new window\">eal-world professionals</a>. It’s a four-step technique that should, when practiced correctly, help you fully grasp the content you’re studying. Here are the steps involved:</p><ol><li><p>Identify exactly what material you need to learn (to do that, try using a method like <a href=\"https://www.lifehacker.com/use-the-kwl-study-method-to-learn-more-1850786565\" target=\"_blank\">KWL</a> or <a href=\"https://www.lifehacker.com/use-the-sq3r-method-to-study-more-effectively-1850780175\" target=\"_blank\">SQ3R</a> to determine  which parts of the topic are most critical before you even get started), and then study it on your own using the methods that have proven most effective for you. I recommend the <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/leitner-system-flashcard-studying\" target=\"_blank\">Leitner flashcard method</a> for vocabulary words and simple question-and-answer problems. Then, try <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/two-ways-to-use-the-blurting-method-to-study-1850999140\" target=\"_blank\">blurting</a>, where you write down everything you can remember about the topic before checking it against your materials to see what you missed. </p></li><li><p>Once you feel comfortable with the material, teach it to someone else—ideally someone who has never studied it. Explain the material as though you were doing so to a total neophyte (Feynman advises to imagine talking to a child), as thoroughly and as straightforwardly as possible. </p></li><li><p>Return to your source material whenever you come across an element you have difficulty explaining in detail.</p></li><li><p>Rewrite and streamline your notes, breaking down complex topics into simpler parts, and further clarifying the topic until you reach a level of granularity that seems almost <em>too</em> basic.</p></li></ol><p>Step 2 isn't as simple as it seems, though. You need a pretty willing participant for this and they should ask questions while you teach them. Questions are crucial because the other person may come up with ones you didn't think of while studying the material and a back-and-forth dialogue can help you make connections between concepts in your brain. Don't treat this as though you're standing in front of them giving a lecture. Rather, turn it more into a real conversation where you're presenting the material, but they're also participating. If they ask something you can't answer, head to Step 3, look it up, and then go back to them with the details. </p><h2 id=\"how-the-feynman-method-works\">How the Feynman method works</h2><p>The most important element of this technique is in dissecting and simplifying the material until you feel like you could explain it all to a child. As the story from Goodstein above reveals, Feynman believed if you couldn’t reduce a topic to information comprehensible to a young student, <em>you</em> didn’t really<em> </em>understand it. (A similar quote has also been attributed to Albert Einstein, so consider it a pedagogical philosophy with legs—though <a href=\"https://www.famousscientists.org/einstein-did-not-say-that/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"open in a new window\">there’s no proof Einstein actually said anything of the sort,</a> either.)</p><div>\n            <p><span>\n                What do you think so far?\n            </span>\n        </p></div>\n<p>It works fine if you choose an adult who is unfamiliar with the topic to teach it to. The idea is just for you to simplify it to a child's level of understanding, but you'll probably get more substantive feedback if you actually do the discussion with an adult. Maybe they’ll ask a question you can’t answer, or help you find connections between ideas. Maybe their unique perspectives and experiences will inform their understanding of this new material and launch some groundbreaking revelations for you. Who's to say? This feedback will help you as you move to the third step of reviewing your materials, as it will give you additional things to consider as you do so. </p><p>When you’re done refining your notes further, try teaching the topic to someone else again, or moving on to another technique, <a href=\"https://www.lifehacker.com/use-distributed-practice-to-better-retain-what-you-st-1850808691\" target=\"_blank\">like distributed practice</a> or <a href=\"https://www.lifehacker.com/overlearning-can-force-important-information-into-your-1850797539\" target=\"_blank\">overlearning</a>, where you’ll study your simplified notes periodically until you fully grasp the material.</p><h2 id=\"feynman-when-no-one-else-is-around\">Feynman when no one else is around</h2><p>It's a nice idea to imagine you could call up your mom or best friend to Feynman it out every time you have a big test coming, but realistically, that's probably not possible. If you can't find anyone with whom to practice this technique, turn to AI. Language models like <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/the-best-ways-to-study-but-not-cheat-using-ai-tools\" target=\"_blank\">ChatGPT are great study helpers</a> when used correctly. </p><p>Instruct the chatbot to act like it's totally unfamiliar with the subject, then type everything you can remember about it into the text-entry box, as though you were using the blurting method. Ask if the AI has any questions and go from there. I've done this and actually just told the bot I was using the Feynman method, which it understood, and it worked just as well as talking to a human being, although it felt a little weirder. Fire up ChatGPT before a big test in case of emergency.</p>\n            </article>\n    </div>\n<div>\n    <div>\n        <p><span>The Daily Newsletter</span>\n            <span>Ready to do everything better?</span>\n        </p>\n        <p><img src=\"https://lifehacker.com/images/team/Jordan.png\" alt=\"Jordan Calhoun portrait\" />\n            <span>Jordan Calhoun\n            </span>\n            <span>Editor in chief</span>\n        </p>\n        <p><span><span>Get daily tips, tricks, <span>and tech guides</span></span> <span>from Jordan and the team.</span></span>\n    </p></div>\n    <div>\n        <p><span>The Daily Newsletter</span>\n            <span><span>Ready to do everything better?</span> <span>Get daily tips, tricks, <span>and tech guides</span></span> <span>from Jordan and the team.</span></span>\n        </p>\n    </div>\n</div>\n    </div>\n            <div>\n                <p><span>\n                        Keep Scrolling for Next Article\n                    </span>\n                </p>\n            </div>\n        </div>\n    </div>"

href=\"https://www.google.com/preferences/source?q=lifehacker.com\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"open in a new window\">including adding my work at Lifehacker as a preferred source</a></em><em>.</em></p><hr /><p>It seems like iOS 26 just dropped, and yet, Apple is back at it with another update. As of Monday, iOS 26.1 is officially in beta testing, which means developers and public testers can try out Apple's next update early. </p><p>\"Point updates\" like iOS 26.1 are never as feature-filled as the main releases, though 26.1 seems particularly small in scope. Apple seems to have done most of what it planned to do with iOS 26, saving just smaller changes for this upcoming update. Still, there are some interesting new additions in this latest beta, and more could come in subsequent releases. Here's what's new.</p><div>\n        <p><img src=\"https://lifehacker.com/images/short-lifehacker-logo.jpg\" alt=\"Lifehacker Logo\" /></p><div>\n            <p><span>You May Also Like</span></p>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n<h2 id=\"apple-music-gestures\">Apple Music gestures</h2><p>If you want to skip a song in Apple Music, you hit the forward button. If you want to get back to the previous song, or restart the current song, you hit the back button. With iOS 26.1, however, you'll have the option to swipe to switch between songs. </p><p>In the current beta, you can swipe right and left on the Now Playing bar to switch back and forth through your queue. With it, Apple has removed the skip forward button from the Now Playing bar. (The back button wasn't present.) It's a small but cool feature, but one that might take a little time to get used to.</p><blockquote>\n    <a href=\"https://twitter.com/BetaProfiles/status/1970499981493833985\" title=\"open in a new window\" target=\"_blank\">\n        This Tweet is currently unavailable. It might be loading or has been removed.\n    </a>\n</blockquote>\n<h2 id=\"video-playback-bar\">Video playback bar</h2><p>In the current version of iOS 26, the video playback bar in the Photos app is flush with the UI. You might love or hate it, but it can be a bit difficult to make it out, depending on the video in question. The play button and mute button, for example, can disappear when iOS can't change their colors to stand out from the background. </p><p>iOS 26.1 beta 1, however, introduces a new video playback bar that is separate from the UI. It looks good, and is easy to see at all times. Again, a small change, but a smart one.</p><blockquote>\n    <a href=\"https://twitter.com/BetaProfiles/status/1970204922751971838\" title=\"open in a new window\" target=\"_blank\">\n        This Tweet is currently unavailable.

So long as you have an iPhone 15 Pro or newer, as well as AirPods Pro 2, AirPods Pro 3, or AirPods 5 with Active Noise Cancellation, you've been able to try it out since iOS 26's launch.  </p><p>Apple initially rolled out support for French, German, Portuguese (Brazil), and Spanish (Spain), but plans to expand the list in the future. With iOS 26.1, it adds four new options, including:</p><ul><li><p>Chinese (Mandarin, simplified)</p></li><li><p>Chinese (Mandarin, traditional)</p></li><li><p>Italian</p></li><li><p>Japanese</p></li><li><p>Korean</p></li></ul><h2 id=\"eight-new-languages-for-apple-intelligence\">Eight new languages for Apple Intelligence</h2><p>Users with an iPhone 15 Pro and newer, listen up: Apple Intelligence supports eight new languages in iOS 26.1. As of this first beta, that includes the following: </p><div>\n            <p><span>\n                What do you think so far?\n            </span>\n        </p></div>\n<ul><li><p>Chinese (traditional)</p></li><li><p>Danish</p></li><li><p>Dutch</p></li><li><p>Norwegian</p></li><li><p>Portuguese (Portugal)</p></li><li><p>Swedish</p></li><li><p>Turkish</p></li><li><p>Vietnamese</p></li></ul><h2 id=\"liquid-glass-comes-to-the-phones-keypad\">Liquid Glass comes to the Phone's keypad</h2><p><a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/tech/how-to-undo-iphone-ios-26-liquid-glass\" target=\"_blank\">Liquid Glass</a>, Apple's new design language, isn't <em>everywhere </em>in iOS 26. While much of the UI now has a glassy look, some elements still look like iOS 18 and earlier. The Phone app's keypad was one such example: While the app itself is <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/tech/ios-26-missed-call-reminders\" target=\"_blank\">very much changed</a> with this update, switch to the keypad, and it looks the same as ever. </p><p>That changes with iOS 26.1. The beta brings Liquid Glass to the keypad, which, while consistent with most of iOS 26's design, does reduce the visibility of the keys a bit, especially in light mode. I wouldn't be surprised to see Apple workshop this one a bit. </p><blockquote>\n    <a href=\"https://twitter.com/BetaProfiles/status/1970197002941321667\" title=\"open in a new window\" target=\"_blank\">\n        This Tweet is currently unavailable. It might be loading or has been removed.\n    </a>\n</blockquote>\n<h2 id=\"calendar\">Calendar</h2><p>Whenever you have Calendar in List view in iOS 26.1, you'll see your daily events color-coded by their respective calendars, rather than simply listed against the same white background.</p><h2 id=\"references-to-third-party-smartwatch-support\">References to third-party smartwatch support</h2><p>If you have an iPhone, you know the only smartwatch that <em>really</em> works well with it is the Apple Watch. Some watches offer notification support, but most simply don't jive well with iOS. </p><p>That might be changing in the future. <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/tech/apple-might-support-third-party-smartwatches\" target=\"_blank\">Code within the iOS 26.1 beta</a> references a new \"Notification Forwarding\" feature, that might allow you to choose a third-party device to send your iPhone alerts to. In addition, an unfinished \"AccessoryExtension\" option might be the framework that lets you pair a third-party watch to your iPhone.</p><p>These are just references in code, not something that you can actively test out in the 26.1 beta, but it's worth noting. Apple is experimenting with supporting third-party watches on iOS, though it could just be to appease the EU's \"Digital Markets Act.\"  </p>\n            </article>\n    </div>\n<div>\n    <div>\n        <p><span>The Download Newsletter</span>\n            <span>Never miss a tech story</span>\n        </p>\n        <p><img src=\"https://lifehacker.com/images/team/Jake.png\" alt=\"Jake Peterson portrait\" />\n            <span>Jake Peterson\n            </span>\n            <span>Senior tech editor</span>\n        </p>\n        <p><span>Get the latest tech news, <span></span>reviews, <span></span>and advice from Jake and the team.</span>\n    </p></div>\n    <div>\n        <p><span>The Download Newsletter</span>\n            <span><span>Never miss a tech story.</span> Get the latest tech news, <span></span>reviews, <span></span>and advice from Jake and the team.</span>\n        </p>\n    </div>\n</div>\n    </div>\n            <div>\n                <p><span>\n                        Keep Scrolling for Next Article\n                    </span>\n                </p>\n            </div>\n        </div>\n    </div>"

But there’s good reason to believe taking notes by hand helps your brain retain more. Here’s why you should try leaving the laptop behind at home and how to make the switch to the old-school way easier.</p><h2 id=\"digital-note-taking-isnt-perfect\">Digital note-taking isn’t perfect</h2><p>There’s been plenty of research that has suggested hand-taken notes are superior to those you take on a computer, even though typing is so much faster and you can get more information on the page. Actually, that’s part of the problem: When taking notes by hand, you have to be choosy about what is important enough to write down. You have to use critical thinking, make outlines, and listen closely to determine what parts of the lecture are valuable enough to take the time to jot down. When you’re typing, you can just transcribe the whole lecture in real time if you want—and you might go on autopilot to do so without engaging your brain deeply in the material. </p>\n<p>I made this mistake in grad school: I'd type everything the professor said, so focused on getting every word that I didn't actually <em>hear</em> the lesson. Worse, I ended up what amounted to transcripts—and the majority of what the professors would say during three-hour classes wasn't relevant to my concrete learning goals. I'd end up feeding my messy \"notes\" <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/the-best-ways-to-study-but-not-cheat-using-ai-tools\" target=\"_blank\">into AI tools</a> and asking for summaries. I could have just listened more thoughtfully and intentionally the first time around.</p><p>Recent research backing up note-taking as the reigning champ was <a href=\"https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/0098628320979895\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"open in a new window\">published in <em>Teaching of Psychology</em></a> in 2022. Researchers put participants in four categories: those who took notes by hand and took a test on the computer, those who took notes on the computer and took a test by hand, those who took notes and did a test on the computer, and those who did it all by hand. Overall, regardless of how they ultimately took the test, the students who took notes by hand performed better on the quiz overall—and better on conceptual questions. </p><h2 id=\"your-computer-is-distracting\">Your computer is distracting</h2><p>It’s convenient to be able to look up concepts, jot down notes, and maintain tabs of supplemental materials throughout class, but it’s just as convenient to toggle over to a new window and scroll social media or send work emails. Being distracted in class is not helpful for your retention and performance, regardless of whether the tool at hand <em>could </em>help you if you were using it to.</p><p>A <a href=\"https://ojs.lib.uwo.ca/index.php/cjsotl_rcacea/article/view/8002\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"open in a new window\">2012 survey</a> published in the <em>Canadian Journal for the Scholarship of Teaching</em> and Learning showed that of 478 students and 36 instructors surveyed at one university, almost half found the use of technology in class for noneducational purposes distracting. There have been a <em>bunch</em> of other studies showing that use of phones or laptops for noneducational purposes during class has a negative effect on academic performance. It's why we're seeing so many jurisdictions around the country push for<a href=\"https://mashable.com/article/school-phone-ban-survey\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"open in a new window\"> phone-free school zones for kids</a>. The journal articles on these results have pretty straightforward titles like “<a href=\"https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/01443410.2018.1489046?journalCode=cedp20\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"open in a new window\">Dividing Attention in the Classroom Reduces Exam Performance</a>” and make it clear that doing anything but taking notes or following along with class materials on the computer is only impacting your ability to obtain and retain valuable information. </p><p>And since taking notes on the computer isn’t all that great to begin with, you might as well not bring the device at all. </p><div>\n            <p><span>\n                What do you think so far?\n            </span>\n        </p></div>\n<h2 id=\"plan-your-note-taking\">Plan your note-taking </h2><p>If you've been typing your notes out for years, it will be a major adjustment to go back to the old notebook and pencil. How is your handwriting looking these days? Do you even know? Time to reacquaint yourself, but in the process, you'll need a strategy as you embark on this plan.</p><p>There is actually <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/best-note-taking-methods-1849535943\" target=\"_blank\">quite a variety of note-taking methods; </a>the best one for you will depend on what type of content you're studying and what kind of learner you are. I linked my guide to all the approaches above. You might find outlining, the Cornell technique, or \"mapping\" or \"charting\" to work best, but you'll have to play around with them a while to figure it out. </p><p>By the way, just because you take the notes by hand doesn't mean they have to stay hand-written. You can <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/best-ways-digitize-notes-1850896868\" target=\"_blank\">digitize your notes</a> using an app or even invest in a smart notebook that will do it for you as you write. I've used <a href=\"https://zdcs.link/z7Mn0V?pageview_type=Standard&template=Explainers&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=a%20Rocketbook%20smart%20notebook&short_url=z7Mn0V&u=https%3A%2F%2Flifehacker.com%2Fdont-use-laptop-to-take-notes-in-class&event_label=a%20Rocketbook%20smart%20notebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"open in a new window\">a Rocketbook smart notebook</a> in the past and found it intuitive and a nice way to straddle the analog and digital worlds. </p><p>Finally, make sure you <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/revise-your-notes-before-you-leave-class-1850774684\" target=\"_blank\">revise your notes before you leave class</a>, whenever possible. Going through them while the lecture is still fresh in your mind is crucial. You can either start digitizing them then, maybe by <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/tech/xmind-mind-mapping-app-review\" target=\"_blank\">using an app to make a mind map</a>, or just rewrite them on a different notebook page. </p>\n            </article>"

/><p>Studying can be as easy as sitting down and reading a chapter, but it shouldn't be. I do hate to break that to you, though I'm actually doing you a favor. Just absorbing huge blocks of content isn't necessarily helpful for remembering any of it. Before you do the work of studying, you have to get organized by sorting the content you need to absorb. Even organizing it, especially using the \"chunking\" method, will help you start to grasp and retain the materials, so by the time you're going through them, you'll be in a perfect position to lodge all that information in your memory. Chunking is a psychological trick that experts swear by. Here's how to master it for yourself.</p><h2 id=\"what-is-chunking\">What is chunking?</h2><p><a href=\"https://dictionary.apa.org/chunking\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"open in a new window\">Here’s what the American Psychological Association says</a>: Chunking is “the process by which the mind divides large pieces of information into smaller units (chunks) that are easier to retain in short-term memory. As a result of this recoding, one item in memory (e.g., a keyword or key idea) can stand for multiple other items (e.g., a short list of associated points).”</p><div>\n        <p><img src=\"https://lifehacker.com/images/short-lifehacker-logo.jpg\" alt=\"Lifehacker Logo\" /></p><div>\n            <p><span>You May Also Like</span></p>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n<p>Basically, your short-term memory has a specific capacity for how many units it can store and that capacity is pretty low, ranging from five to nine—but the units themselves can be as complex as you want. The APA says “the exact number of chunks remembered depends on the size of each chunk or the subunits contained within each chunk.”</p><p>Each chunk is a collection of pieces of related information, like words, numbers, or phrases. The key here is they have to be related to each other, but <em>not</em> very related to the other chunks. Chunking is all about grouping related pieces of information so you can stay in that five-to-nine units frame.</p><p>You probably already use chunking in your real life to remember things. Think of your phone number. You likely already sort it into your area code, those first three digits, and the final four digits. Remembering a string of 10 numbers is hard; remembering three “chunks” of smaller digits is less difficult.</p><h2 id=\"so-how-do-you-study-in-chunks\">So how do you study in chunks?</h2><p>Look at the things you have to memorize and start grouping them loosely into categories based on how they’re related. This doesn’t have to be about <em>content</em>, either. If you have to memorize 20 words or concepts, you don’t have to group them by their meaning; you can group them by whether they sound similar, start with the same letter, or whatever you want. If you've ever <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/the-best-ways-to-use-association-to-remember-what-you-1850861942\" target=\"_blank\">used a mnemonic device</a> to remember something like, say, the order of the planets, you've already made a \"chunk\" to study before. </p><div>\n            <p><span>\n                What do you think so far?\n            </span>\n        </p></div>\n<p>You can create your chunks with something as simple as a pencil and paper, listing the words or concepts together and skipping a few spaces between units. From here, you can make flashcard sets of each chunk or use the first letter of each phrase to create a mnemonic device. Try an acrostic, a phrase where the first letter of each word corresponds with the first letter of one of the things you need to remember. If you think better in terms of numbers, try grouping your words or concepts by how many letters are in them. </p><p>The pencil-and-paper technique is helpful for entrenching words in your memory, since <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/dont-use-laptop-to-take-notes-in-class\" target=\"_blank\">you retain things you write down</a> a little better than those you type, but it's not that convenient or functional otherwise. I recommend using apps and digital programs to make this easier. For instance, use a mind-mapping app to sort out your chunks and make them easy to visualize. I always find that even seeing words grouped together and organized can help me remember them and the ways they relate to each other better. <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/tech/xmind-mind-mapping-app-review\" target=\"_blank\">Xmind is my favorite app for this</a>, but you can also use something like Canva, which I have absolutely done in a pinch. Next, you can even use an app to create your flashcards. <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/leitner-system-flashcard-studying\" target=\"_blank\">Flashcards are one of the best</a> and most time-tested methods for studying, but it's wildly unrealistic for you to carry a bunch of notecards around. <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/tech/best-flashcard-apps-for-studying\" target=\"_blank\">These are my five favorite flashcard apps</a>, which will enable you to keep all your study materials accessible on your phone wherever you are. </p><p>I recommend making a new deck for every chunk you create so you can keep your groups separate in your mind. Once you've grasped all the content of your various chunks, try mixing some of the decks together and reviewing them in bigger batches. <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/why-you-should-actually-study-multiple-topics-at-the-sa-1850438252\" target=\"_blank\">Known as interleaving</a>, this technique will gradually help you make connections between different concepts, enhancing not only your recall of them, but your actual understanding. </p><p>Just don't forget to start out by studying each set—or chunk—individually. Even though this doesn’t break down the amount of content, having them in groups with similar characteristics will help you remember it all together, and you’ll be surprised how much of the real material you retain. </p>\n            </article>\n    </div>\n<div>\n    <div>\n        <p><span>The Daily Newsletter</span>\n            <span>Ready to do everything better?</span>\n        </p>\n        <p><img src=\"https://lifehacker.com/images/team/Jordan.png\" alt=\"Jordan Calhoun portrait\" />\n            <span>Jordan Calhoun\n            </span>\n            <span>Editor in chief</span>\n        </p>\n        <p><span><span>Get daily tips, tricks, <span>and tech guides</span></span> <span>from Jordan and the team.</span></span>\n    </p></div>\n    <div>\n        <p><span>The Daily Newsletter</span>\n            <span><span>Ready to do everything better?</span> <span>Get daily tips, tricks, <span>and tech guides</span></span> <span>from Jordan and the team.</span></span>\n        </p>\n    </div>\n</div>\n    </div>\n            <div>\n                <p><span>\n                        Keep Scrolling for Next Article\n                    </span>\n                </p>\n            </div>\n        </div>\n    </div>"

iPhone and iPad.</li>\n                                            <li>The app works similarly to how it does on Mac, with the option to scan, edit, markup, and export documents.</li>\n                                            <li>There is definitely room for improvement, however.</li>\n                                    </ol>\n            </div>\n    <h2 id=\"toc\">Table of Contents</h2>\n    <article>\n        <hr />\n        <p>Your iPhone is essentially a computer that fits in your pocket, so it only makes sense for Apple to treat it as such. To that point, with <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/tech/the-best-five-ios-26-features\" target=\"_blank\">iOS 26</a>, both the iPhone and the iPad get a new app that was a Mac exclusive for over 20 years: Preview. </p><h2 id=\"what-can-you-do-with-the-preview-app\">What can you do with the Preview app?</h2><p>Like on macOS, the Preview app for iOS and iPadOS is largely made for viewing PDFs and other documents. When you first open the app, you'll see the options to either create a new document or scan one with your iPhone's camera. </p><p>Most of the time, however, you probably you have an existing document you want to open using Preview. If so, you'll find those options in the bottom half of this starting page. This is Preview's integration with the Files app: You can browse your documents from Files and open any with Preview.</p><div>\n        <p><img src=\"https://lifehacker.com/images/short-lifehacker-logo.jpg\" alt=\"Lifehacker Logo\" /></p><div>\n            <p><span>You May Also Like</span></p>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n<p>Once you have a document loaded up, you're able to view, annotate, markup, and edit it. If you need to fill out a document with your information, you can use AutoFill to automatically enter contact info and other saved details. You can add your signature, and if you're on your iPad, you can use your Apple Pencil to draw on the document. Otherwise, you can use your finger to mark up the file. </p><p>You can also export documents from the Preview app. You can work with file types including HEIDC, JPEG, PDF, PNG, and TIFF. And as with Preview on macOS, there are a number of controls when exporting, such as resolution, embedding text, and saving images as JPEG.</p><p>While there's a lot you can do here, the biggest strength I see for this mobile Preview app is using it as a tool for legal documents. If you need to sign an important document, you can quickly scan it into the app, add your signature, fill out any information—perhaps automatically with AutoFill—then email the doc out, all without needing to jump to your computer.</p><h2 id=\"preview-on-ios-is-still-a-work-in-progress\">Preview on iOS is still a work in progress</h2><p>If you look at <a href=\"https://apps.apple.com/us/app/preview/id536344167?platform=iphone\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"open in a new window\">Preview's App Store page</a>, you'll notice some mixed reviews. After using the app for a bit, I understand why. Preview for iOS is definitely still a work in progress and in need of some key upgrades.</p><div>\n            <p><span>\n                What do you think so far?\n            </span>\n        </p></div>\n<p>The biggest quirks I noticed immediately: The main menu page is cluttered, with the Files integration looking more like a glitch than a dedicated window. Speaking of Files, Apple made the decision to have documents in Files open in Preview. At first, that sounds like a good idea, until you experience it in person on both iOS and iPadOS. Being dragged out of the Files app when you're not expecting it is jarring, especially when you're used to viewing your docs directly in the app. </p><p>The workaround here is to avoid Files for opening, well, files. Use the Files integration within Preview, so you stay in the same app. How intuitive. You could also choose to delete the Preview app, but that's a bit of a shame when it's such a major update for iOS and iPadOS 26.</p><p>Also, when you choose the Markup option, there's no clear way to exit without closing the whole app first. As far as I can tell, the only way to do so is to tap the three-dots in the top right, then tap Markup to exit this menu. The Markup button should really stay on screen as it does on macOS, so it's obvious how to dismiss it.    </p>\n            </article>\n    </div>\n<div>\n    <div>\n        <p><span>The Download Newsletter</span>\n            <span>Never miss a tech story</span>\n        </p>\n        <p><img src=\"https://lifehacker.com/images/team/Jake.png\" alt=\"Jake Peterson portrait\" />\n            <span>Jake Peterson\n            </span>\n            <span>Senior tech editor</span>\n        </p>\n        <p><span>Get the latest tech news, <span></span>reviews, <span></span>and advice from Jake and the team.</span>\n    </p></div>\n    <div>\n        <p><span>The Download Newsletter</span>\n            <span><span>Never miss a tech story.</span> Get the latest tech news, <span></span>reviews, <span></span>and advice from Jake and the team.</span>\n        </p>\n    </div>\n</div>\n    </div>\n            <div>\n                <p><span>\n                        Keep Scrolling for Next Article\n                    </span>\n                </p>\n            </div>\n        </div>\n    </div>"
