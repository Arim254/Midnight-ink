Whether you want to build a smart security system, turn a “dumb” device smart, or simply control your lights from your phone, this guide will help walk you through it.</em></p>\n        </span>\n    </p>\n    <article>\n        <hr />\n        <p>Cleaning is one of those necessary chores that most of us don't have much enthusiasm for. It's often demanding and tedious work, and while you're taking care of it, you do so with the knowledge that you're going to have to do it all again next week.</p><p>There's some good news, though, for the cleaning-averse: Modern day tech can handle a lot of these jobs on your behalf, as smart cleaning gadgets continue to get better and better. In recent years, they've become more reliable and more effective, and you've got a host of different models to choose from.</p><p>This introduction to smart cleaning technology will bring you up to date on the products that are available, and what they can do for you. Yes, you can have a home that's neater and cleaner—with just a few button presses.</p>\n<h2 id=\"the-pros-and-cons-of-cleaning-tech\">The pros and cons of cleaning tech</h2><p>The big positive from investing in smart cleaning gadgets is, of course, that you won't have to do these jobs yourself, so the hours you save can be put towards doing something you actually enjoy.</p><p>These gadgets don't get tired, sick, or irritable, and will work at any time of the day or night—though you don't necessarily want a robot vacuum humming away at 4 a.m.. In many cases they can be operated remotely and work autonomously, so they can be taking care of the chores while you're out at work or on vacation.</p><div>\n    <p><img src=\"https://lifehacker.com/imagery/articles/01K57198V3E3FABSSYCRSRWCH6/images-1.fill.size_2000x1125.v1757951599.jpg\" alt=\"Ecovacs Winbot W2 Pro Omni\" srcset=\"https://lifehacker.com/imagery/articles/01K57198V3E3FABSSYCRSRWCH6/images-1.fill.size_800x450.v1757951599.jpg 800w, https://lifehacker.com/imagery/articles/01K57198V3E3FABSSYCRSRWCH6/images-1.fill.size_1400x788.v1757951599.jpg 1400w, https://lifehacker.com/imagery/articles/01K57198V3E3FABSSYCRSRWCH6/images-1.fill.size_2000x1125.v1757951599.jpg 2000w\" />\n            </p>\n            <p><span>You can get smart devices to wash your windows for you.</span>\n                                        <span>Credit: Ecovacs</span>\n                    </p>\n    </div>\n<p>You <em>are </em>going to have to make an initial investment in the technology, and, for some devices, a rather sizable one. The argument can be made that hiring someone to do your cleaning is a better option than getting robots to do it: They might do a more thorough job, depending on the person and the gadget you're comparing them to, and you can give them more specific instructions. However, getting cleaners in does involve giving someone else access to your home, and finding a mutually convenient time. It will also be an ongoing expense.</p><p>There are a few more cons to consider. One is that a certain amount of tidying up and preparation work is often required before the robots can take over. You may have to pick up toys and clothes, for example, so the robot vacuum can vacuum. By the time you've done that, you might think it makes more sense to just do the whole job yourself.</p><div>\n    <p><img src=\"https://lifehacker.com/imagery/articles/01K57198V3E3FABSSYCRSRWCH6/images-2.fill.size_2000x1125.v1757951599.jpg\" alt=\"Roomba app\" srcset=\"https://lifehacker.com/imagery/articles/01K57198V3E3FABSSYCRSRWCH6/images-2.fill.size_800x450.v1757951599.jpg 800w, https://lifehacker.com/imagery/articles/01K57198V3E3FABSSYCRSRWCH6/images-2.fill.size_1400x788.v1757951599.jpg 1400w, https://lifehacker.com/imagery/articles/01K57198V3E3FABSSYCRSRWCH6/images-2.fill.size_2000x1125.v1757951599.jpg 2000w\" />\n            </p>\n            <p><span>Many smart devices can be controlled via an app.</span>\n                                        <span>Credit: iRobot</span>\n                    </p>\n    </div>\n<p>What's more, these gadgets require a certain level of maintenance: Depending on the device, you need to empty them out, supply them with power, water, and cleaning products, and perhaps even clean parts of them yourself. Like any piece of hardware, they will experience wear and tear, and will eventually need to be replaced.</p><p>There's one other consideration to think about, which is that manual cleaning is a great way to exercise. <a href=\"https://bmcgeriatr.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12877-023-04039-1\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"open in a new window\">Studies have shown</a> that domestic duties can give you enough of a workout to extend your lifespan and improve a host of different health markers, so you might want to use some of the time that these gadgets are saving you to head out for a run or for a session at the gym.</p><h2 id=\"the-best-smart-cleaning-gadgets-you-can-buy\">The best smart cleaning gadgets you can buy</h2><p>If you've decided that you want to transform your home into one that cleans itself, you can automate a number of different processes using a number of different devices. There's plenty of choice out there, so the usual rules apply: Take your time to research the various options and the features they're offering versus their price, and find as many reviews as you can from people who've used them.</p><h3>Robot vacuums and mops</h3><p>This is the obvious place to start, as these are the gadgets that usually come to mind when you think of smart cleaning tech. You can find single-purpose devices that only vacuum or only mop, or devices that combine both functions.</p><p>While early models had their issues with reliability and cleaning power, the robot vacuums you can buy today are generally more impressive in terms of how clean they can get your carpets and floors. You'll find features like LiDAR and camera-powered mapping and obstacle avoidance, self-emptying capabilities, and auto-adjustments depending on what surface is being cleaned. </p><p>Often, everything these machines do can be organized through a companion app, so you can set the cleaners to work on a specific schedule, as well as set zones or rooms that are off limits. We're even starting to see robot vacuums that can <a href=\"https://vacuumwars.com/eufy-marswalker-omni-s2-ifa-2025/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"open in a new window\">climb up the stairs</a>, so they really can get your whole house vacuumed and mopped without an assist.</p><div>\n            <p><span>\n                What do you think so far?\n            </span>\n        </p></div>\n<div>\n    <p><img src=\"https://lifehacker.com/imagery/articles/01K57198V3E3FABSSYCRSRWCH6/images-3.fill.size_2000x1125.v1757951599.jpg\" alt=\"Roborock Saros 10R\" srcset=\"https://lifehacker.com/imagery/articles/01K57198V3E3FABSSYCRSRWCH6/images-3.fill.size_800x450.v1757951599.jpg 800w, https://lifehacker.com/imagery/articles/01K57198V3E3FABSSYCRSRWCH6/images-3.fill.size_1400x788.v1757951599.jpg 1400w, https://lifehacker.com/imagery/articles/01K57198V3E3FABSSYCRSRWCH6/images-3.fill.size_2000x1125.v1757951599.jpg 2000w\" />\n            </p>\n            <p><span>The Roborock Saros 10R comes with its own docking station.</span>\n                                        <span>Credit: Roborock</span>\n                    </p>\n    </div>\n<p>These cleaners can be a significant investment.

These pieces of hardware elevate clothes cleaning with a variety of useful and intelligent tricks, including the ability to adjust cleaning and drying cycles to the type and size of load, remote control via mobile apps, and a number of self-maintaining mechanisms.</p><p>A good example is the <a href=\"https://zdcs.link/9YMkVn?pageview_type=Standard&template=Explainers&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=LG%20WM6700HBA&short_url=9YMkVn&u=https%3A%2F%2Flifehacker.com%2Fhome%2Fall-the-smart-gadgets-for-a-self-cleaning-home&event_label=LG%20WM6700HBA\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"open in a new window\">LG WM6700HBA</a>, which will set you back $1,250. There's on-board AI assistance to work out the best cycles for the clothes you're washing, an automatic dispenser for just the right amount of detergent and fabric softener to cut down on waste, and remote operations and monitoring via the LG ThinQ app.</p><h3>Smart dishwashers</h3><p>Finally we have <strong>smart dishwashers</strong>, which use automated technology to give your crockery and cutlery a better clean than standard appliances might. The features are similar to those you'll find on smart washers and dryers: Sensing technology for understanding what's been loaded in and adjusting the cleaning accordingly, remote app control and smart home integration, and as much automated maintenance and self-cleaning as possible.</p><p>Take a look at the <a href=\"https://zdcs.link/98PJqd?pageview_type=Standard&template=Explainers&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=Bosch%20500%20Series&short_url=98PJqd&u=https%3A%2F%2Flifehacker.com%2Fhome%2Fall-the-smart-gadgets-for-a-self-cleaning-home&event_label=Bosch%20500%20Series\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"open in a new window\">Bosch 500 Series</a>, which is priced at $1,250 at the time of writing. It has intelligent sensors to check cleaning progress, an AutoAir feature that automatically pops the dishwasher door open when cleaning is finished to let air circulate, and the option of operating cleaning cycles and other dishwasher features from an app on your phone.</p>\n            </article>\n    <div>\n    <div>\n        <p><span>Smarter Home & Living <span>Newsletter</span></span>\n            <span>Never miss a story</span>\n        </p>\n        <p><img src=\"https://lifehacker.com/images/team/Lindsey.png\" alt=\"Lindsey Ellefson portrait\" />\n            <span>Lindsey Ellefson\n            </span>\n        </p>\n        <p><span><span>Get the latest smart home news, trends,</span> <span>and advice from Lindsey and the team.</span></span>\n    </p></div>\n    <div>\n        <p><span>Smarter Home & Living <span>Newsletter</span></span>\n            <span><span>Never miss a story.</span> <span>Get the latest smart home news, trends,</span> <span>and advice from Lindsey and the team.</span></span>\n        </p>\n    </div>\n</div>\n                        <div>\n                <div>\n            <div>\n                    <p><img src=\"https://lifehacker.com/imagery/authors/01HHFDBG3H1VSXE5XSDZ06W91C/image.fill.size_150x150.v1706808034.jpg\" alt=\"Photo of David Nield\" />\n                                            </p>\n                </div>\n            <div>\n                <p>David Nield</p>\n                                <div>\n                                            <p>David Nield is a technology journalist from Manchester in the U.K. who has been writing about gadgets and apps for more than 20 years. </p>\n                                    </div>\n                <p><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://lifehacker.com/author/david-nield\">Read David's full bio</a>\n                            </p></div>\n        </div>\n                <div>\n                                            <div>\n    <p>More by David</p>\n        <hr />\n        </div>\n                        <div>\n                <p><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://lifehacker.com/home/best-smart-tech-cool-heat-home\">\n                    <img src=\"https://lifehacker.com/imagery/articles/01K59Q1VPXAQSK010BFW6ASQZT/hero-image.fill.size_75x75.v1759157072.jpg\" alt=\"person using smart thermostat\" />\n                </a>\n            </p></div>\n        <hr />\n                    <div>\n                <p><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://lifehacker.com/tech/how-to-watch-pornhub-even-if-its-blocked-in-your-state\">\n                    <img src=\"https://lifehacker.com/imagery/articles/01JWXSQX0KG9KBKARRSGFA13YP/hero-image.fill.size_75x75.v1749051765.jpg\" alt=\"Pornhub goes dark\" />\n                </a>\n            </p></div>\n        <hr />\n                                        </div>\n            </div>\n                                </section>\n                                                </section>\n    </div>"

Today, performance wearable Whoop has <a href=\"https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20250930178710/en/WHOOP-Launches-Clinician-Reviewed-Advanced-Labs-Unlocking-a-Comprehensive-View-of-Human-Health?_gl=1*10pmvmu*_gcl_aw*R0NMLjE3NTc0MzcyMjMuQ2owS0NRandvUF9GQmhERkFSSXNBTlBHMjRQWTJfXzRVN2o3dGtxa0FNNjNYR2hQTVdOdFo1VjNGYm0wbGlpVmFNWFBLdU1UTnFYT2gyMGFBbi16RUFMd193Y0I.*_gcl_au*MzE0MTg4My4xNzU4NTgyMjgy*_ga*Njg5NzEzNzk1LjE3NDI1ODUwMTM.*_ga_ZQWF70T3FK*czE3NTkyMzYzNTQkbzcwJGcxJHQxNzU5MjM2NTM4JGozMyRsMCRoMA\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"open in a new window\">officially launched</a> Advanced Labs, a new feature that connects blood test results with the company's continuous health monitoring platform. <a href=\"https://www.whoop.com/us/en/advanced-labs/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"open in a new window\">Whoop Advanced Labs</a> is in partnership with Quest Diagnostics, adding to a growing trend of more and more wearables aiming to be comprehensive, one-stop health platforms. The launch comes after more than 350,000 members joined a waitlist following the feature's preview in May, signaling mighty strong appetite for this new level of integrated health tracking. </p><h2 id=\"how-whoop-will-track-bloodwork\">How Whoop will track bloodwork</h2><p>Whoop Advanced Labs is designed to analyze biomarkers spanning metabolism, hormones, inflammation, cardiovascular health, and nutrient status—all data that goes far beyond what can be captured through wearable sensors alone. \"At Whoop, we're committed to empowering our members with a highly comprehensive view into their health and performance,\" <a href=\"https://www.whoop.com/us/en/press-center/whoop-to-bring-clinical-lab-testing-from-quest-diagnostics/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"open in a new window\">said John Sullivan</a>, Chief Marketing Officer at Whoop. </p><div>\n        <p><img src=\"https://lifehacker.com/images/short-lifehacker-logo.jpg\" alt=\"Lifehacker Logo\" /></p><div>\n            <p><span>You May Also Like</span></p>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n<p>The vision is that Whoop subscribers will be able access the types of clinical testing that physicians order (like from Quest Diagnostics) to deliver patient care. Here are the two ways that members can bring their bloodwork into their fitness tracking:</p><ol><li><p><strong>Upload pre-existing bloodwork. </strong>Members can now upload results from any lab provider directly into the Whoop app at no additional cost. This is a way to centralize all results, track long-term trends, and connect bloodwork findings to data on sleep, training, recovery, and lifestyle.</p></li><li><p><strong>Book comprehensive testing through the Whoop app. </strong>Members who subscribe to Whoop Advanced Labs and schedule curated blood tests directly through the app. From there, results are automatically synced to the Whoops app and reviewed by a clinician who provides expert context. <a href=\"https://www.whoop.com/us/en/advanced-labs/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"open in a new window\">Subscription options</a> include: one test for $199, two tests per year for $349, or four tests per year for $599, with additional tests available at discounted rates. </p></li></ol><p>To clarify, a third-party provider will review test requests, order tests, deliver results through the Whoop app, and provide phone consultations when requested. All tests are reviewed and ordered by a licensed healthcare provider.</p><h2 id=\"do-you-really-need-to-monitor-everything\">Do you really need to monitor everything?</h2><p>Again, Whoop isn't the first wearable company to head in this direction. Ultrahuman, the maker of the <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/health/ultrahuman-air-smart-ring-review?test_uuid=015ZvAUxXams0rnBpajhMg2&test_variant=A\" target=\"_blank\">Ring AIR smart ring</a>, launched its <a href=\"https://www.ultrahuman.com/blood-vision/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"open in a new window\">Blood Vision</a> feature earlier this year. </p><div>\n            <p><span>\n                What do you think so far?\n            </span>\n        </p></div>\n<p>This feature can help people catch health issues early and take proactive steps to address them. At the same time, it raises questions about whether consumers actually need this level of health monitoring from for-profit wellness companies.</p><p>In my opinion, this all points to a sort of \"medicalization\" of everyday wellness. While access to health data can be empowering, it can also create anxiety and lead people to over-monitor aspects of their health that might not require constant attention. After all, blood biomarkers can fluctuate <a href=\"https://familymedicineandwellness.com/different-outcomes-knowing-why-blood-test-results-may-vary/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"open in a new window\">for many reasons</a>, and abnormal results don't always indicate health problems. </p><h2 id=\"looking-ahead\">Looking ahead</h2><p>As this feature rolls out, anyone interested in Whoop's blood testing integration can still <a href=\"https://www.whoop.com/us/en/waitlist/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"open in a new window\">join the waitlist</a> for Advanced Labs. Whether you'll actually want to know everything your blood appears to be telling you is another question entirely. <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/whoop/top/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"open in a new window\">Anecdotally</a>, the company's existing user base already skews toward serious athletes and health optimization devotees—in other words, the sort of people who would be interested in comprehensive biomarker tracking. For now, I've strapped in to watch the lines between fitness tracker and medical device continue to blur. </p>\n            </article>\n    </div>\n<div>\n    <div>\n        <p><span>The Daily Newsletter</span>\n            <span>Ready to do everything better?</span>\n        </p>\n        <p><img src=\"https://lifehacker.com/images/team/Jordan.png\" alt=\"Jordan Calhoun portrait\" />\n            <span>Jordan Calhoun\n            </span>\n            <span>Editor in chief</span>\n        </p>\n        <p><span><span>Get daily tips, tricks, <span>and tech guides</span></span> <span>from Jordan and the team.</span></span>\n    </p></div>\n    <div>\n        <p><span>The Daily Newsletter</span>\n            <span><span>Ready to do everything better?</span> <span>Get daily tips, tricks, <span>and tech guides</span></span> <span>from Jordan and the team.</span></span>\n        </p>\n    </div>\n</div>\n    </div>\n            <div>\n                <p><span>\n                        Keep Scrolling for Next Article\n                    </span>\n                </p>\n            </div>\n        </div>"

Whether you want to build a smart security system, turn a “dumb” device smart, or simply control your lights from your phone, this guide will help walk you through it.</em></p>\n        </span>\n    </p>\n    <article>\n        <hr />\n        <p>Smart home devices can streamline a lot of your day-to-day tasks. With an internet connection and some simple automations, you may never have to carry house keys, turn off the lights, or touch your thermostat again. But all of this convenience comes at a potential cost, as smart tech is vulnerable to attack by cyber actors, leaving your personal data and your privacy at risk. </p><p>Here's what you need to know to secure your smart home.</p><h2 id=\"is-your-smart-home-secure\">Is your smart home secure? </h2><p>The short answer: not by default. Smart homes have vulnerabilities at multiple levels, from the devices themselves, to your home network, to the physical endpoints, like your phone, that have access to and control over your Internet of Things (IoT). </p>\n<p>To start, IoT devices may have weak built-in security protocols or lack clear instructions to help users lock them down from factory settings, leaving them vulnerable to hackers, who may have to exert very little effort to access your data or spy on you. Wifi routers and smart home devices often have default credentials that are publicly available and therefore easy to get past—and  <a href=\"https://www.ibm.com/think/insights/router-reality-check-86-percent-default-passwords-have-never-been-changed\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"open in a new window\">data show</a> that the vast majority of users have never changed their router admin password or adjusted any factory settings. If your home network isn't secure, nothing connected to it can be considered secure either. </p><p>Smart devices can also be integrated into botnets, allowing threat actors to conduct malicious activity like account takeovers and malware distribution using your home network. A recent instance of this was <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/tech/this-android-malware-is-attacking-smart-home-devices\" target=\"_blank\">a campaign known as BADBOX 2.0</a>, which targeted off-brand consumer electronics manufactured in China. </p><p>Bill Budington, a senior staff technologist at the <a href=\"https://www.eff.org/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"open in a new window\">Electronic Frontier Foundation</a> (EFF), notes the digital divide may increase the risk for some consumers, who may seek out cheaper devices from low-cost manufacturers that have weaker security and far less to lose in terms of reputation if they are implicated in vulnerabilities as compared to major companies like Amazon. </p><p>Finally, security can be compromised if your physical devices fall into the wrong hands. For example, if you control your smart home using apps on your phone, a threat actor could gain access in the event said phone is lost, stolen, or hacked.  </p><h2 id=\"smart-homes-can-compromise-privacy\">Smart homes can compromise privacy</h2><p>Left unsecured, smart home devices can also put your privacy (and potentially your safety) at risk. Internet-connected cameras, from baby monitors to pet cams, <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/tech/can-someone-spy-through-webcam-or-phone\" target=\"_blank\">are vulnerable to hacking</a>, and threat actors can use them to surveil you and your home. This may include snooping on and tracking your movements, \"shoulder surfing\" to collect sensitive personal information from your devices, recording audio and video footage of your private activities, and sharing or selling live feeds on the dark web. (In <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/nest-baby-monitor-hacked-by-man-who-threatened-kidnapping-2018-12\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"open in a new window\">a particularly alarming incident in 2018</a>, a hacker reportedly issued verbal threats toward a four-month-old child through a Nest-branded baby monitor.)</p><p>Your smart tech is also likely collecting a lot of information about you in the course of its normal activities—all of which could be exploited. For example, your robot vacuum creates and utilizes a map of your home's physical layout to know where to go, and usage patterns from various automations can be used to track your movements and confirm when you're away from home. </p><p>There's also the possibility that your smart home devices are compromising your data in ways you aren't aware of and haven't actively consented to. A <a href=\"https://engineering.nyu.edu/news/new-research-reveals-alarming-privacy-and-security-threats-smart-homes\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"open in a new window\">2023 report from security experts</a>—led by the nonprofit IMDEA Networks and Northeastern University—shows that IoT devices may inadvertently expose personal information that can be harvested and sold to companies involved in surveillance capitalism. Researchers found that spyware apps and advertisers abuse local network protocols to access sensitive data, making it easier to profile users. </p><h2 id=\"no-security-standards-for-smart-homes\">No security standards for smart homes</h2><p>One of the biggest barriers to smart home security is that there isn't a single set of cybersecurity standards that companies have to follow, nor a centralized resource for users to research this information. Earlier this year—during the last few weeks of the Biden administration—the Federal Communications Commission launched the <a href=\"https://www.fcc.gov/CyberTrustMark\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"open in a new window\">U.S. Cyber Trust Mark</a> voluntary labeling program to incentivize device manufacturers to improve security and help consumers buy with confidence. However, under the Trump administration, the agency later <a href=\"https://www.cybersecuritydive.com/news/fcc-cyber-trust-mark-ul-investigation-delay/758507/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"open in a new window\">launched an investigation</a> into the program, delaying its rollout. </p><p>For now, consumers are left to do their own due diligence. In 2017, the nonprofit Mozilla Foundation created a resource called <a href=\"https://www.mozillafoundation.org/en/privacynotincluded/categories/smart-home/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"open in a new window\">*Privacy Not Included</a>, with reviews of products measured against \"minimum security standards\" and breakdowns of any privacy concerns. The site doesn't appear to have been updated in the last year, but you can still find detailed information about the privacy and security history of well-known smart home manufacturers like Amazon, Google, Wyze, and Ecobee. </p><p>Otherwise, Budington suggests simply searching the device you're considering (and the company that makes it) before buying, to see if researchers or users have reported any concerns. </p><div>\n            <p><span>\n                What do you think so far?\n            </span>\n        </p></div>\n<h2 id=\"how-to-improve-your-smart-home-security\">How to improve your smart home security</h2><p>Securing your smart home starts with securing your internet connection via your router. Lifehacker has assembled a whole <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/home/how-to-make-your-home-security-system-and-wireless-network-safe\" target=\"_blank\">guide to protecting your home network</a>, but at the very least, you should change any default router settings—admin usernames, passwords, and network names—to something unique and not personally identifiable, and turn on encryption in your wireless security settings. Regularly check for updates, which provide patches for security flaws, and audit the devices connected to your network to identify anything suspicious and remove those you no longer use. </p><p>You can add another layer of security with a guest network set up specifically for your IoT devices. That way, if your smart devices are compromised, everything connected to your primary network (such as computers and phones with access to your personal and financial accounts) will be protected. </p><p>According to Budington, one way to further mitigate vulnerability is to reduce the number of devices with their own wireless connection, running them through a secure, centralized hub instead. Home Assistant is a <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/tech/self-host-apps\" target=\"_blank\">self-hosted option</a> that can be installed on a Raspberry Pi or a traditional PC or used with the plug-and-play Home Assistant Green. Hubitat also gives you local control over your device data and integrates with a variety of products, including those compatible with the <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/tech/your-most-important-smart-home-decision-is-the-ecosystem-you-choose\" target=\"_blank\">Zigbee, Z-Wave, and Matter standards</a>. </p><p>Once your network is secure, you'll want to <a href=\"https://consumer.ftc.gov/articles/securing-your-internet-connected-devices-home\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"open in a new window\">take similar steps</a> with each of your IoT devices. Change default usernames and passwords to unique, secure alternatives and enable all available security features, such as two-factor authentication and encryption, in the device settings. Ensure your devices (and any apps used to control them) receive automatic firmware updates. </p><p>You should also <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/tech/how-to-protect-your-privacy-when-using-smart-home-tech\" target=\"_blank\">check your device's privacy settings</a>, removing permissions that aren't essential for it to function and disabling features you won't use. For example, you could turn off location tracking on your smart thermostat and disable voice control for devices other than your voice assistant. </p><p>Finally, while we've focused mostly on digital threats, your smart home isn't immune to physical compromise. Be aware of ways your devices can be accessed, such as those installed on the exterior of your house, and ensure phones and tablets and the apps on them that control IoT devices are secured with a PIN or biometric authentication.</p><p>Remember that, by nature, anything connected to the internet is at least somewhat vulnerable to attack. You'll have to consider your own risk tolerance and weigh the convenience of having a smart device against the potential for it to be compromised—and your privacy along with it. You may find that there are some things that you simply don't need to automate, and therefore you can stick with the \"dumb\" alternative. </p>\n            </article>\n    <div>\n    <div>\n        <p><span>The Download Newsletter</span>\n            <span>Never miss a tech story</span>\n        </p>\n        <p><img src=\"https://lifehacker.com/images/team/Jake.png\" alt=\"Jake Peterson portrait\" />\n            <span>Jake Peterson\n            </span>\n        </p>\n        <p><span>Get the latest tech news, <span></span>reviews, <span></span>and advice from Jake and the team.</span>\n    </p></div>\n    <div>\n        <p><span>The Download Newsletter</span>\n            <span><span>Never miss a tech story.</span> Get the latest tech news, <span></span>reviews, <span></span>and advice from Jake and the team.</span>\n        </p>\n    </div>\n</div>\n                        <div>\n                <div>\n                    <p><img src=\"https://lifehacker.com/imagery/authors/01HF2FBGBC5PWJAAJJJHG350CH/image.fill.size_150x150.v1737570988.png\" alt=\"Photo of Emily Long\" />\n                                            </p>\n                </div>\n                <div>\n                                            <div>\n    <p>More by Emily</p>\n        <hr />\n        </div>\n                        <div>\n                <p><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://lifehacker.com/entertainment/wordle-nyt-hint-today-october-2-2025\">\n                    <img src=\"https://lifehacker.com/imagery/articles/01K68S41CHCWJ4F299VWHC7BBE/hero-image.fill.size_75x75.v1759083890.jpg\" alt=\"wordle art\" />\n                </a>\n            </p></div>\n        <hr />\n                    <div>\n                <p><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://lifehacker.com/how-to-cancel-amazon-prime\">\n                    <img src=\"https://lifehacker.com/imagery/articles/01HF2GRAFWZ95BVYWGFVS9A6SE/hero-image.fill.size_75x75.v1699834331.jpg\" alt=\"Amazon boxes on porch\" />\n                </a>\n            </p></div>\n        <hr />\n                                        </div>\n            </div>\n                                </section>\n                                                </section>\n    </div>"

announced</a> a whole new fleet of equipment devices and the addition of AI fitness coaching, all in an effort to usher in \"a new era of connective wellness.\" The upgraded Bikes and Treads will probably be the biggest news of the day, but I was interested in another development: the brand's new partnerships and acquisition, which are also aligned with that \"connective wellness\" goal. </p><p>The company deepened its partnership with Hyrox, partnered with two new companies, and acquired Breathwrk, all while also adding more depth to existing elements of \"human connection\" on its robust platform. </p><div>\n        <p><img src=\"https://lifehacker.com/images/short-lifehacker-logo.jpg\" alt=\"Lifehacker Logo\" /></p><div>\n            <p><span>You May Also Like</span></p>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n<h2 id=\"peloton-acquired-breathwrk\">Peloton acquired Breathwrk</h2><p>Yesterday, I attended the press event announcing all the big Peloton news. For the most part, everything made sense. New devices, better software, and updated classes to go along with them seemed like logical steps for a leading at-home fitness company to take over a decade into its existence. But then a presenter mentioned that Peloton had \"acquired <a href=\"https://zdcs.link/QOg36B?pageview_type=Standard&template=News&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=Breathwrk&short_url=QOg36B&u=https%3A%2F%2Flifehacker.com%2Fhealth%2Fpeloton-new-acquisitions-partnerships&event_label=Breathwrk\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"open in a new window\">Breathwrk</a>.\" This, it turns out, is exactly what it sounds like: It's an app that guides the user through breathing exercises—like calming breaths, breathing for sleep, and breathing for energy—designed to \"unleash your peak mental and physical potential.\" </p><p>Earlier this year, Peloton execs <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/health/peloton-price-changes-letter-to-investors\" target=\"_blank\">hinted at price increases</a> for memberships and mentioned a plan to roll out more \"fitness and wellness experiences.\" To that end, I've noticed a lot more \"wellness,\" generally, in the app's offerings. Beyond the cardio and strength classes Peloton is known for, I've found <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/health/why-i-like-pelotons-meditation-classes\" target=\"_blank\">meditation</a>, \"<a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/health/peloton-reflection-rides\" target=\"_blank\">reflection rides</a>,\" and <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/health/peloton-nutrition-recipe-content-youtube\" target=\"_blank\">nutritional content</a>. It's been obvious for a while that the company's aspirations are greater than dominating the exercise space; they want to go deeper on mental health, nutrition, and everything else that goes into being well-rounded and healthy. </p><p>Per Peloton, All Access and App+ members can now access Breathwrk's app by using their Peloton login credentials. Further integrations between the two will be \"coming soon.\" </p><h2 id=\"pelotons-new-partnerships\">Peloton's new partnerships</h2><p>Peloton also announced partnerships with the Hospital for Special Surgery and Respin Health. HSS is a leader in orthopedics and rheumatology. Together, the two will \"produce programming focused on musculoskeletal injury prevention and recovery.\" That's all expected to start rolling out in the next few weeks. It's another bit of news that makes sense. In announcing the addition of an AI coach to personalize every member's workout plan, Peloton's reps pointed out that the software will use users' goals and existing workout data to outline what they should do for the next week—including when they should take rests. While ramping up wellness initiatives, Peloton hasn't overlooked the role rest plays in overall health. I'm interested to see what the HHS programming looks like in practice. </p><p>Respin is a platfor, launched by Halle Berry for those going through everything from perimenopause to postmenopause. The two brands will co-create an eight-week program of Peloton classes to specifically target symptom relief and various improvements for members going through those life changes. Again, these are coming in the next few weeks. </p><div>\n            <p><span>\n                What do you think so far?\n            </span>\n        </p></div>\n<p>Finally, Peloton is doubling down on <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/health/peloton-hyrox-training-classes\" target=\"_blank\">its partnership with Hyrox</a>. That isn't a <em>new</em> partnership, but it's one that has apparently been fruitful enough to warrant the allocation of more resources. If you don't know, <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/health/what-is-hyrox-fitness-competition\" target=\"_blank\">Hyrox is a relatively new sport</a> that involves running plus competing in things like sled pulls and pushes, among other exercises. You have to row, do burpees, and do a farmer's carry, too, all in the name of demonstrating how versatile you are as an athlete. Peloton has had a special Hyrox training program in place for a few months now, but plans to expand its offerings with new branded classes that support training for the various parts of the race. </p><h2 id=\"improvements-to-human-connections\">Improvements to \"human connections\"</h2><p>Peloton is also expanding what users can do with its existing offerings aimed at \"human connections.\" Primarily, this involves the addition of Club Peloton and Official Peloton Teams. </p><p>Club Peloton is a recognition program that awards users a rank based on how consistently they work out and whether they try new types of exercises. If you check your Peloton app right now, you might find you've already been assigned a rank, like bronze, silver, gold, or legendary. The idea is that your rank will eventually earn you rewards, like discounts on products or early access to classes. You'll also get a profile badge which will be visible to others when you're on a class leaderboard. </p><p>Official Peloton Teams is an expansion of Peloton's popular <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/health/pelotons-teams-is-surprisingly-good-at-motivating-me-to-work-out\" target=\"_blank\">Teams feature, which I already love</a>. With Teams, you join forces with friends and compete with or against them to hit certain goals, like a particular amount of workouts per week. You can also join Teams based on attributes like life stage (like being a new mom) or region (like the city where you live). Official Peloton Teams are the newest part of all that and are helmed by the company's famous instructors. You can join ones like Move for Life, Cross Training, Hyrox training, and Menopause Health. </p>\n            </article>\n    </div>\n<div>\n    <div>\n        <p><span>The Daily Newsletter</span>\n            <span>Ready to do everything better?</span>\n        </p>\n        <p><img src=\"https://lifehacker.com/images/team/Jordan.png\" alt=\"Jordan Calhoun portrait\" />\n            <span>Jordan Calhoun\n            </span>\n            <span>Editor in chief</span>\n        </p>\n        <p><span><span>Get daily tips, tricks, <span>and tech guides</span></span> <span>from Jordan and the team.</span></span>\n    </p></div>\n    <div>\n        <p><span>The Daily Newsletter</span>\n            <span><span>Ready to do everything better?</span> <span>Get daily tips, tricks, <span>and tech guides</span></span> <span>from Jordan and the team.</span></span>\n        </p>\n    </div>\n</div>\n    </div>\n            <div>\n                <p><span>\n                        Keep Scrolling for Next Article\n                    </span>\n                </p>\n            </div>\n        </div>\n    </div>"
