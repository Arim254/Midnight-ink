these days. It’s <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/tech/disable-gmail-automatic-gemini-ai-summaries?test_uuid=015ZvAUxXams0rnBpajhMg2&test_variant=B\" target=\"_blank\">in your Gmail</a>, it’s <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/tech/why-gemini-is-replacing-google-assistant?test_uuid=015ZvAUxXams0rnBpajhMg2&test_variant=B\" target=\"_blank\">on your phone</a>, and soon, it’ll be in your browser. While Google’s AI browser integration was already live for Google AI Pro and AI Ultra subscribers, it's now <a href=\"https://blog.google/products/chrome/new-ai-features-for-chrome/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"open in a new window\">rolling out to everyone</a>—and getting a bunch of new features, too.</p><p>If you’re suddenly seeing a new Gemini button in the top right of your Chrome browser (in the same pane as your tabs), then you’ve already been hit with the update. If not, you may need to use the three-dots button in the top right corner and select <strong>Gemini in Chrome</strong> to turn it on, assuming you want to.</p><h2 id=\"how-to-use-gemini-in-chrome\">How to use Gemini in Chrome</h2><p>When you click the Gemini button, or summon it via a keyboard shortcut (Alt + G by default), you’ll be able to try out the same features Google’s paying customers have had access to for a while. That means Gemini will be able to answer questions about the webpage you’re on, or just answer general questions unrelated to what you’re browsing. Or, if you’re in a Google app or on a Google website, it’ll be able to take some simple actions for you, like jumping you to a specific spot in a YouTube video.</p><div>\n        <p><img src=\"https://lifehacker.com/images/short-lifehacker-logo.jpg\" alt=\"Lifehacker Logo\" /></p><div>\n            <p><span>You May Also Like</span></p>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n<p>Additionally, Gemini can also now work across your tabs and compare information between them. Simply start a dialogue with Gemini by tapping the button in the top right corner, and at the bottom of the window, click “Add tab” to give Gemini another source of data to consider.</p><p>Weirdly, while these updates are already pushing live to average folks, Google says businesses will need to wait a couple of weeks, so they can get “enterprise-grade data protections and controls.”</p><p>As of now, aside from the new access, it’s not the biggest update, especially because to try it, you need to be on Windows or Mac, have your language set to English, and be in the U.S.. Google stresses that the Gemini Assistant on Android can also help you browse Chrome, and that it’s working to bring more direct Gemini in Chrome access to both its Android and iOS apps.</p><h2 id=\"more-ai-browsing-is-coming\">More AI browsing is coming</h2><p>Google says it also has big things in store for the feature, with “agentic browsing” set for the “coming months.” This will supposedly let Gemini in Chrome complete tasks, like booking a haircut for you, or ordering your groceries. Alternatively, it’ll also help you browse a bit more easily, as Google says it’s working to let you ask Gemini questions about your browser history when you want to go back to a specific page. For instance, “what was the website where I saw the walnut desk last week?” could take you back to a shopping page you only vaguely remember.</p><div>\n            <p><span>\n                What do you think so far?\n            </span>\n        </p></div>\n<p>A more powerful address bar is apparently in the works that will let you ask questions of Google’s AI model without having to navigate to it first.

Simply navigate to <strong>Settings > AI Innovations</strong>, and you’ll be able to turn off the Gemini button, as well as disable its keyboard shortcut.

Scientists have figured out how many units of information you can store in your short-term memory (around seven, <a href=\"https://www.lifehacker.com/preview/study-in-chunks-to-remember-more-1850392462?rev=1682969564950\" target=\"_blank\">though there are great workarounds for remembering more</a> than that), but if you <em>really</em> want to remember something,  you have to go over it a bunch of times until it lodges deeper in your brain. </p><p>There are <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/use-the-leitner-system-to-study-more-effectively-1850786716\" target=\"_blank\">quite a few ways to do that</a> if you have some time to devote to the practice of repetition, but if you’re getting ready for a test at school or a presentation at work, you might not have too long to go over the content again and again and <em>again</em>—but you do, if you make a personal podcast. This technique requires you to make an effort only once, then calls on you to relax and absorb the information more passively, making it ideal for studying or reviewing when you are short on time or heavy on other tasks. </p><div>\n        <p><img src=\"https://lifehacker.com/images/short-lifehacker-logo.jpg\" alt=\"Lifehacker Logo\" /></p><div>\n            <p><span>You May Also Like</span></p>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n<h2 id=\"how-to-make-a-podcast-to-help-you-study\">How to make a “podcast” to help you study</h2><div><p>Next time you want to retain the details of something you’re studying, open up the voice notes feature on your phone, because you’re going to make yourself a little study podcast. You <em>could</em> simply read your notes out loud into the mic; it’s the simplest option, and a good one. (If you’re memorizing a speech, just perform the whole thing. That's what I did in high school, when I was a forensics nerd and felt that using even a single notecard during a speech meet delegitimized my entire presentation. For what it's worth, I won a lot, which I partially attribute to being off-book while everyone else used aids.) </p><p>You do have other, more intensive, options though. You can record separate “episodes” for each mini-topic you’re studying, which will help you organize your thinking <em>and</em> provide an easy way to focus if you need brushing up in a particular area. Use <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/best-note-taking-methods-1849535943\" target=\"_blank\">your preferred note-taking method</a> or a r<a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/use-the-sq3r-method-to-study-more-effectively-1850780175\" target=\"_blank\">eading-and-retaining technique like SQ3R</a> to create outlines that are concise but make sense and hit on the points you most need to study, then write your scripts according to those notes. That part will take a while, but all of it, combined, will help you start to remember what you're supposed to be remembering.</p><p>You don’t have to worry about the thing actually being pleasant for others to listen to, so make it useful for your own study style. A few approaches you could take include asking yourself review questions out loud, pausing, and stating the right answer or reading entire passages from your textbook into the mic. You could even try out different characters and turn it into a role-playing scenario. Don't get too involved with it, though, unless that sort of creativity helps you focus; it's better to stick with facts and straightforward audio.</p></div><p>The most important part comes after you’ve recorded your personal podcast: You have to listen to it. You have to listen to it <em>a lot</em>. Play it through the speakers of your car or through your headphones on the train to make your commute productive. Play it at the grocery store, when you’re doing errands around the house, and when you are relaxing at night. Fall asleep listening to it. The first few times, you'll listen pretty actively, but even having it running as background noise will shove that information into your brain.</p><div>\n            <p><span>\n                What do you think so far?\n            </span>\n        </p></div>\n<h2 id=\"a-second-option-for-your-study-podcast\">A second option for your study podcast</h2><p>If you're going to do this, a major component of what makes it valuable is the part where you have to review the material, outline the script, and say it all out loud into your microphone. That's a big chunk of the studying right there. Still, if you don't have time for that or you are worried you won't highlight the most important parts if left to your own devices, there's another option that works well. </p><p><a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/tech/google-notebooklm-review\" target=\"_blank\">Google's NotebookLM</a> is an AI tool that pulls <em>only</em> from the material you give it. That means that unlike competitors such as ChatGPT, it doesn't answer your questions by searching the entire internet. Rather, it searches through PDFs, YouTube videos, links, and other resources you provide—and that's it. One of its coolest features is that it can <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/tech/use-google-notebooklm-ai-to-turn-your-research-into-a-podcast\" target=\"_blank\">create \"podcasts\"</a> for you based on those materials, in addition to its ability to <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/tech/googles-notebooklm-introduces-quizzes-flashcards-tools\" target=\"_blank\">create flashcards and quizzes</a>. These podcasts sound like real ones you might listen to in your everyday life: They have different voices and characters who speak conversationally but factually about the content of whatever you uploaded to the software. I love NotebookLM and use it all the time to organize my work. It's free to use and generates podcasts quickly, so it's worth considering here, too.</p><h2 id=\"why-a-personal-study-podcast-works\">Why a personal study podcast works</h2><div><p>Picking things up from your personal podcast is an example of rote learning, the process by which we memorize things based on repetition. But it has other advantages, too. </p><p>For instance, even when you’re compiling the notes and deciding <em>what </em>to include in the mini podcast, you’re studying—you’re making decisions about which concepts are most important, how they flow together, and how you can present your mastery of them to others. Even if you choose to let NotebookLM do it, you're still making decisions about which materials from your class or project to upload to the software and how to organize it, which is also studying. </p><p>Reading is all well and good, but you remember things better when you process them in a variety of ways. From organizing your notes to speaking them aloud and listening to them read back to you, every part of this process will help you more thoroughly process and recall the content. Each of those is commonly used on its own as a standalone study technique, so imagine how effective they’ll be together. </p></div>\n            </article>\n    </div>\n<div>\n    <div>\n        <p><span>The Download Newsletter</span>\n            <span>Never miss a tech story</span>\n        </p>\n        <p><img src=\"https://lifehacker.com/images/team/Jake.png\" alt=\"Jake Peterson portrait\" />\n            <span>Jake Peterson\n            </span>\n            <span>Senior tech editor</span>\n        </p>\n        <p><span>Get the latest tech news, <span></span>reviews, <span></span>and advice from Jake and the team.</span>\n    </p></div>\n    <div>\n        <p><span>The Download Newsletter</span>\n            <span><span>Never miss a tech story.</span> Get the latest tech news, <span></span>reviews, <span></span>and advice from Jake and the team.</span>\n        </p>\n    </div>\n</div>\n    </div>\n            <div>\n                <p><span>\n                        Keep Scrolling for Next Article\n                    </span>\n                </p>\n            </div>\n        </div>"

Now, you can use Visual Intelligence to ask about what you're seeing on your iPhone's display, to add events to your Calendar, or to look up images using Google (similar to Google’s <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/tech/how-to-use-samsung-galaxy-ai-features?test_uuid=015ZvAUxXams0rnBpajhMg2&test_variant=B\" target=\"_blank\">Circle to Search</a>).

Plus, when needed, you'll still be able to trigger Visual Intelligence, even when using thumbnails.</p><h2 id=\"what-you-can-do-with-visual-intelligence-in-ios-26\">What you can do with Visual Intelligence in iOS 26</h2><div>\n    <p><img src=\"https://lifehacker.com/imagery/articles/01JYRQJAXY60XDSAY4P2TV7QA0/images-3.fill.size_2000x1500.v1751029197.png\" alt=\"Visual Intelligence Image Lookup on iPhone.\" srcset=\"https://lifehacker.com/imagery/articles/01JYRQJAXY60XDSAY4P2TV7QA0/images-3.fill.size_800x600.v1751029197.png 800w, https://lifehacker.com/imagery/articles/01JYRQJAXY60XDSAY4P2TV7QA0/images-3.fill.size_1400x1050.v1751029197.png 1400w, https://lifehacker.com/imagery/articles/01JYRQJAXY60XDSAY4P2TV7QA0/images-3.fill.size_2000x1500.v1751029197.png 2000w\" />\n            </p>\n            <p><span></span>\n                                        <span>Credit: Khamosh Pathak</span>\n                    </p>\n    </div>\n<p>Since the <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/tech/apple-intelligence-finally-has-image-generation\" target=\"_blank\">iOS 18.2 update</a>, you’ve been able to use ChatGPT to ask questions about what’s on your screen. But with iOS 26, Apple introduced Automatic Visual Look Up to the mix. This new feature automatically analyzes your screenshots the second they're captured. Then, it pulls in relevant actionable information and adds it below the screenshot.</p><p>For example, if you screenshot is of an invitation to a party, it will show you a one-tap button to add it to your calendar. If your screenshot is of a website, you’ll see a link to go there directly. Plus, there’s a feature that lets you highlight any image to find similar images on Google, as if you were using <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/tech/how-to-use-samsung-galaxy-ai-features\" target=\"_blank\">Circle to Search or Google Lens</a>. This is Apple's justification for expanding screenshot previews to take up your whole screen, but it adds an extra step to actually saving your screenshots.</p><h2 id=\"how-to-disable-the-full-screen-screenshots\">How to disable the full-screen screenshots</h2><p>If you stick with full-screen previews for taking screenshots, which are now the default, you’ll have to tap twice to actually save a screenshot every single time you take one. First, you'll have to tap the checkmark button at the top of the screen, and then choose <strong>Save to Photos</strong>. </p><p>Thankfully, Apple has an option to disable the new screenshot splash screen. To go back to the old method for taking screenshots, go to <strong>Settings</strong> > <strong>General</strong> > <strong>Screen Capture</strong> and disable the <strong>Full-Screen Previews</strong> option.</p><div>\n            <p><span>\n                What do you think so far?\n            </span>\n        </p></div>\n<div>\n    <p><img src=\"https://lifehacker.com/imagery/articles/01JYRQJAXY60XDSAY4P2TV7QA0/images-1.fill.size_2000x1125.v1751029197.png\" alt=\"Disable full-screen previews for screenshots.\" srcset=\"https://lifehacker.com/imagery/articles/01JYRQJAXY60XDSAY4P2TV7QA0/images-1.fill.size_800x450.v1751029197.png 800w, https://lifehacker.com/imagery/articles/01JYRQJAXY60XDSAY4P2TV7QA0/images-1.fill.size_1400x787.v1751029197.png 1400w, https://lifehacker.com/imagery/articles/01JYRQJAXY60XDSAY4P2TV7QA0/images-1.fill.size_2000x1125.v1751029197.png 2000w\" />\n            </p>\n            <p><span></span>\n                                        <span>Credit: Khamosh Pathak</span>\n                    </p>\n    </div>\n<p>Now, when you take a screenshot, you’ll see the familiar thumbnail preview in the bottom-left corner of the screen.

that the new phones are in the hands of people who don’t work for Apple, flaws are starting to come to light. Specifically, durability testers are saying that you might want to slap a case on your new phone.</p><p>Most notably, it turns out that the iPhone 17 Pro has a major flaw with its camera bump. While the lenses themselves are fine, the edges on the raised camera “plateau” (as Apple is calling it) can apparently get scuffed just by hanging out in the same bag or pocket as household items like coins or keys. That’s according to testing by reliable YouTube reviewer Zack Nelson, or <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KrOBzFwVzwA&t=50s\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"open in a new window\"><u>JerryRigEverything</u></a>, who bemoaned Apple’s decision to avoid adding a chamfer or other protective barrier around the camera bump.</p><p>“I think it was intentional,” the YouTuber says in his video. “So it looks cooler.”</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KrOBzFwVzwA&t=50s%EF%BF%BC%EF%BF%BCAccording\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"open in a new window\">According</a> to Nelson, the scratches probably have to do with Apple’s decision to move back to anodized aluminum for this model, as opposed to the titanium the company started using with the iPhone 15 Pro. Aluminum provides better cooling, and strong scratch resistance anywhere that the anodizing process adheres to, but the catch is that without chamfers, those corners tend to get missed during the anodizing bath.</p><p>For instance, when Nelson tried to scratch the flat parts of the plateau (as well as the rest of the back of the phone), it only produced dust that could be easily wiped off, good as new. But those camera plateau corners remained permanently chipped, even after wiping.</p><p>This follows a similar report from <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-09-19/chinese-iphone-buyers-complain-of-scratches-on-new-pro-models\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"open in a new window\"><u>Bloomberg</u></a>, which noted that display models of both the blue iPhone 17 Pro and black iPhone Air seemed especially prone to scratches, as well as <a href=\"https://mashable.com/article/broken-iphone-17-air\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"open in a new window\"><u>posts from users</u></a>, pointing out scratches across all colors and multiple models of the new iPhones, especially after being <a href=\"https://x.com/amisecured/status/1969144282809581972\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"open in a new window\"><u>attached to MagSafe accessories</u></a>. While it’s possible that some of these scratches could be wiped away, as shown in Nelson’s video, those around the corners look particularly nasty, and I’m not just talking about the camera plateau.</p><div>\n            <p><span>\n                What do you think so far?\n            </span>\n        </p></div>\n<h2 id=\"how-to-stop-scratches-on-your-iphone-17\">How to stop scratches on your iPhone 17</h2><p>While it’s certainly not ideal that your bare iPhone could be susceptible to scratches, there is a simple solution—slap a case on it. That’ll hide your fancy Apple branding, sure, but it will also ensure your phone doesn’t take the brunt of your keys or loose quarters, and add a barrier around those camera plateau edges. </p><p>This year, Apple has three case options, including a clear plastic, silicone, and a new fabric style case called TechWoven. In testing by YouTuber Arun Maini, or <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/shorts/pa8bfKRgsYE\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"open in a new window\"><u>Mrwhosetheboss</u></a>, the clear case was easily susceptible to scratches by simple household objects, but all other options held up well. That’s a relief for anyone who was burned by Apple’s previous fabric case, FineWoven, which also had its own <a href=\"https://www.cnet.com/tech/mobile/my-iphone-15-pro-maxs-finewoven-case-had-a-rough-week-and-it-shows/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"open in a new window\"><u>scratch-related drama</u></a> when it debuted alongside the iPhone 15 line.</p><p>Alternatively, you could go third-party. In that case, you’ve got plenty of options.

href=\"https://lifehacker.com/tech/best-gaming-laptops?test_uuid=015ZvAUxXams0rnBpajhMg2&test_variant=B\" target=\"_blank\"><u>it’s gaming</u></a>. But if there’s another area, it’s display technology. Yep, while Apple still stands behind its trademark LCD “retina” displays, Windows machines have been adopting OLED and touchscreens for years now. Luckily, according to industry experts, MacBook owners will soon be able to plan on having better screens, too.</p><p>The latest rumors come courtesy of TF International Securities analyst Ming-Chi Kuo, as well as Bloomberg’s Mark Gurman, both of whom have reliable track records reporting on Apple products. While this <a href=\"http://bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-01-11/apple-working-on-adding-touch-screens-to-macs-in-major-turnabout?sref=9hGJlFio\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"open in a new window\"><u>isn’t the first time</u></a> Apple has been rumored to be updating its laptop displays, we’ve now got a timeline update. </p><p>According to a <a href=\"https://x.com/mingchikuo/status/1968249865940709538\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"open in a new window\"><u>post Kuo made to X on Sept. 17</u></a>, the MacBook Pro will be the first MacBook to receive an OLED update, and as a bonus, the new screen will also support touch. The upgraded model is “expected to enter mass production by late 2026,” although as is par for the course with these leaks, the post didn’t point to any particular sources to back this up. However, if you read between the lines and look at Kuo’s past <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/tech/everything-we-know-about-the-upcoming-iphone-17-series\" target=\"_blank\">spot-on speculations</a>, it’s likely an anonymous source from within Apple.</p><p>For a little bit of assurance, Gurman, who also frequently relies on such sources, was quick to agree with Kuo’s assertions in his <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2025-09-21/mark-gurman-s-iphone-17-first-impressions-touchscreen-macbook-pro-meta-glasses?cmpid=BBD092125_POWERON&utm_medium=email&utm_source=newsletter&utm_term=250921&utm_campaign=poweron\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"open in a new window\"><u>weekly Power On newsletter</u></a> this weekend, pointing to his original reporting on the topic from 2023. However, the reporter also added that the actual release date might be closer to early 2027, depending on how quickly Apple can get supply out. He also clarified that, technically, the revamp was planned for this year, but was moved back “due to OLED supply issues.”</p><p>As for the rest of Apple’s MacBook line, neither expert has updates on that end, although Gurman speculates that “if touch resonates on the MacBook Pro, I expect it to eventually come to other Macs as well.”</p><p>While the benefits behind a touchscreen laptop are fairly self explanatory, OLED is higher on my personal wishlist. The technology’s self-illuminating pixels will help with contrast, yes, <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/tech/extend-iphone-air-battery-life\" target=\"_blank\"><u>but like on the iPhone</u></a>, they should also aid with battery life. That’s because, while current MacBooks rely on a backlight that spans the entire display, parts of an OLED screen can remain off when not in use.</p><div>\n            <p><span>\n                What do you think so far?\n            </span>\n        </p></div>\n<p>It’s notable that Kuo and Gurman’s proposed timeline also matches with the release of the <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/tech/new-ipad-rumors?test_uuid=015ZvAUxXams0rnBpajhMg2&test_variant=B\" target=\"_blank\"><u>iPad Pro just last year</u></a>, which upgraded to an OLED screen for the first time. Given that iPadOS 26 also <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/tech/ipados-26-basically-turns-your-ipad-into-macbook-wwdc-2025?test_uuid=015ZvAUxXams0rnBpajhMg2&test_variant=B\" target=\"_blank\"><u>revamped the iPad user experience to be much more like using a MacBook</u></a>, it’s likely Apple is currently planning for more parity between its product categories.</p><p>On that note, Kuo’s post also reminded readers that a <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/tech/apple-affordable-macbook-rumors\" target=\"_blank\"><u>potential lower-cost MacBook that uses an iPhone processor</u></a> could be in the works for later this year, although specifics are still largely in the dark at this point. The analyst, however, did say this model would likely not include touch support, although that could change in the future.</p><p>As for other rumored Apple products, also still largely in the dark is a potential foldable iPhone, which Gurman says “will be the star of Apple’s 2026 product lineup.” As <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/tech/everything-that-the-iphone-air-tells-us-about-the-iphone-fold\" target=\"_blank\"><u>predicted by my colleague David Nield</u></a>, the reporter’s sources are increasingly telling him that “users should imagine two titanium iPhone Airs side-by-side,” but pricing and release date specifics are still up to the imagination for now.</p>\n            </article>\n    </div>\n<div>\n    <div>\n        <p><span>The Download Newsletter</span>\n            <span>Never miss a tech story</span>\n        </p>\n        <p><img src=\"https://lifehacker.com/images/team/Jake.png\" alt=\"Jake Peterson portrait\" />\n            <span>Jake Peterson\n            </span>\n            <span>Senior tech editor</span>\n        </p>\n        <p><span>Get the latest tech news, <span></span>reviews, <span></span>and advice from Jake and the team.</span>\n    </p></div>\n    <div>\n        <p><span>The Download Newsletter</span>\n            <span><span>Never miss a tech story.</span> Get the latest tech news, <span></span>reviews, <span></span>and advice from Jake and the team.</span>\n        </p>\n    </div>\n</div>\n    </div>\n            <div>\n                <p><span>\n                        Keep Scrolling for Next Article\n                    </span>\n                </p>\n            </div>\n        </div>\n    </div>"
