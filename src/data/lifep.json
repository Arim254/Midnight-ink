href=\"https://lifehacker.com/tech/best-gaming-laptops?test_uuid=015ZvAUxXams0rnBpajhMg2&test_variant=B\" target=\"_blank\"><u>it’s gaming</u></a>. But if there’s another area, it’s display technology. Yep, while Apple still stands behind its trademark LCD “retina” displays, Windows machines have been adopting OLED and touchscreens for years now. Luckily, according to industry experts, MacBook owners will soon be able to plan on having better screens, too.</p><p>The latest rumors come courtesy of TF International Securities analyst Ming-Chi Kuo, as well as Bloomberg’s Mark Gurman, both of whom have reliable track records reporting on Apple products. While this <a href=\"http://bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-01-11/apple-working-on-adding-touch-screens-to-macs-in-major-turnabout?sref=9hGJlFio\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"open in a new window\"><u>isn’t the first time</u></a> Apple has been rumored to be updating its laptop displays, we’ve now got a timeline update. </p><div>\n        <p><img src=\"https://lifehacker.com/images/short-lifehacker-logo.jpg\" alt=\"Lifehacker Logo\" /></p><div>\n            <p><span>You May Also Like</span></p>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n<p>According to a <a href=\"https://x.com/mingchikuo/status/1968249865940709538\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"open in a new window\"><u>post Kuo made to X on Sept. 17</u></a>, the MacBook Pro will be the first MacBook to receive an OLED update, and as a bonus, the new screen will also support touch. The upgraded model is “expected to enter mass production by late 2026,” although as is par for the course with these leaks, the post didn’t point to any particular sources to back this up. However, if you read between the lines and look at Kuo’s past <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/tech/everything-we-know-about-the-upcoming-iphone-17-series\" target=\"_blank\">spot-on speculations</a>, it’s likely an anonymous source from within Apple.</p><p>For a little bit of assurance, Gurman, who also frequently relies on such sources, was quick to agree with Kuo’s assertions in his <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2025-09-21/mark-gurman-s-iphone-17-first-impressions-touchscreen-macbook-pro-meta-glasses?cmpid=BBD092125_POWERON&utm_medium=email&utm_source=newsletter&utm_term=250921&utm_campaign=poweron\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"open in a new window\"><u>weekly Power On newsletter</u></a> this weekend, pointing to his original reporting on the topic from 2023. However, the reporter also added that the actual release date might be closer to early 2027, depending on how quickly Apple can get supply out. He also clarified that, technically, the revamp was planned for this year, but was moved back “due to OLED supply issues.”</p><p>As for the rest of Apple’s MacBook line, neither expert has updates on that end, although Gurman speculates that “if touch resonates on the MacBook Pro, I expect it to eventually come to other Macs as well.”</p><p>While the benefits behind a touchscreen laptop are fairly self explanatory, OLED is higher on my personal wishlist. The technology’s self-illuminating pixels will help with contrast, yes, <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/tech/extend-iphone-air-battery-life\" target=\"_blank\"><u>but like on the iPhone</u></a>, they should also aid with battery life. That’s because, while current MacBooks rely on a backlight that spans the entire display, parts of an OLED screen can remain off when not in use.</p><div>\n            <p><span>\n                What do you think so far?\n            </span>\n        </p></div>\n<p>It’s notable that Kuo and Gurman’s proposed timeline also matches with the release of the <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/tech/new-ipad-rumors?test_uuid=015ZvAUxXams0rnBpajhMg2&test_variant=B\" target=\"_blank\"><u>iPad Pro just last year</u></a>, which upgraded to an OLED screen for the first time. Given that iPadOS 26 also <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/tech/ipados-26-basically-turns-your-ipad-into-macbook-wwdc-2025?test_uuid=015ZvAUxXams0rnBpajhMg2&test_variant=B\" target=\"_blank\"><u>revamped the iPad user experience to be much more like using a MacBook</u></a>, it’s likely Apple is currently planning for more parity between its product categories.</p><p>On that note, Kuo’s post also reminded readers that a <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/tech/apple-affordable-macbook-rumors\" target=\"_blank\"><u>potential lower-cost MacBook that uses an iPhone processor</u></a> could be in the works for later this year, although specifics are still largely in the dark at this point. The analyst, however, did say this model would likely not include touch support, although that could change in the future.</p><p>As for other rumored Apple products, also still largely in the dark is a potential foldable iPhone, which Gurman says “will be the star of Apple’s 2026 product lineup.” As <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/tech/everything-that-the-iphone-air-tells-us-about-the-iphone-fold\" target=\"_blank\"><u>predicted by my colleague David Nield</u></a>, the reporter’s sources are increasingly telling him that “users should imagine two titanium iPhone Airs side-by-side,” but pricing and release date specifics are still up to the imagination for now.</p>\n            </article>\n    </div>\n<div>\n    <div>\n        <p><span>The Download Newsletter</span>\n            <span>Never miss a tech story</span>\n        </p>\n        <p><img src=\"https://lifehacker.com/images/team/Jake.png\" alt=\"Jake Peterson portrait\" />\n            <span>Jake Peterson\n            </span>\n            <span>Senior tech editor</span>\n        </p>\n        <p><span>Get the latest tech news, <span></span>reviews, <span></span>and advice from Jake and the team.</span>\n    </p></div>\n    <div>\n        <p><span>The Download Newsletter</span>\n            <span><span>Never miss a tech story.</span> Get the latest tech news, <span></span>reviews, <span></span>and advice from Jake and the team.</span>\n        </p>\n    </div>\n</div>\n    </div>\n            <div>\n                <p><span>\n                        Keep Scrolling for Next Article\n                    </span>\n                </p>\n            </div>\n        </div>\n    </div>"

There's a reason for the saying, \"hurts so good,\" right? But it turns out you don't need to suffer to see results: The Rally orbital massager, <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/health/rally-massage-gun-review?test_uuid=015ZvAUxXams0rnBpajhMg2&test_variant=A\" target=\"_blank\">which I have previously reviewed</a>, has completely changed my hard-ass approach to recovery.</p><p>Don't get me wrong—percussive massage guns have their place. They're powerful and effective at working out the deepest knots. But after months of inconsistent use, I realized something: I was avoiding my own recovery tool. The aggressive pounding felt like punishment rather than self-care, turning what should've been a daily wellness ritual into something I'd postpone until I was in serious pain.</p>\n<p>I'd skip sessions when I needed them most, only reaching for my massage gun when my muscles were screaming for attention. By then, I'd need that aggressive percussion just to make a dent in the tension I'd allowed to build up. During marathon training especially, I simply can't let this happen. That's where orbital massages come in.</p>\n<h2 id=\"why-rallys-gentler-recovery-changes-everything\">Why Rally's gentler recovery changes everything</h2><p>The Rally's orbital massage technology works differently than traditional percussive guns—instead of hammering muscles with rapid-fire pulses, picture the circular motion of a car buffer. Luckily, the motion is gentle enough that it feels more like a human touch, as opposed to turning me into a car getting buffed. </p><p>The Rally has taught me something crucial about sustainable self-care: I'm infinitely more likely to reach for a device that feels good to use, rather than one that hurts. It's a game-changer for consistency. With my old massage gun, I'd psyche myself out before sessions: \"<em>Do I really need this? Can I handle the intensity right now?\"</em> With the Rally, there's no mental barrier. I can use it while watching TV, during work breaks, or as part of my bedtime routine, without dreading the experience.</p><h2 id=\"building-up-when-you-need-to\">Building up when you need to</h2><p>Here's the best thing about the Rally: It can double as a percussive massager when you need more intensity. But now, instead of starting with the nuclear option, I work my way up to it. It's more comfortable and, I find, more effective: My muscles respond better to massage when they're already relaxed and have good blood flow. </p><p>I'll begin with the gentle orbital motion to warm up tissues and increase circulation, then switch to percussion mode if I encounter stubborn knots. I am far from anti-percussion massage—there are times when you need that deeper, more aggressive treatment, like after a particularly intense workout, when dealing with chronic knots, or for trigger point therapy. But now, those hurt-so-good instances are the exception, rather than the rule. </p><div>\n            <p><span>\n                What do you think so far?\n            </span>\n        </p></div>\n<p>The Rally's ability to switch between modes means I'm not locked into one approach. I have the gentleness for daily maintenance and the power for when things get serious.</p><h2 id=\"the-best-recovery-tool-is-the-one-you-actually-use\">The best recovery tool is the one you actually use</h2><p>By embracing the gentler, orbital massage as my daily default, I've created a sustainable self-care routine that prevents problems rather than just treating them. Proactive care beats reactive treatment every time.</p><p>Maybe my muscles are thanking me not because I'm punishing them less, but because I'm caring for them more consistently. Sometimes the revolutionary approach is simply being kinder to yourself, and having the tools that make that kindness effective. </p><p>If you've been avoiding your massage gun or find yourself using it only when you're already in pain, consider making the switch to orbital massage as your primary recovery method. Your future self (and your muscles) will thank you for choosing consistency over intensity.</p>\n            </article>"

target=\"_blank\" title=\"open in a new window\">Apple Watch</a> and in the Apple Health app, grades how well you slept on a scale from 0 to 100. Since it grades you retroactively, I can look back at my last month (or even years) of sleep scores to see how the new numbers compare to the scores I’ve gotten from <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/health/oura-ring-4-review\" target=\"_blank\"><u>Oura</u></a> and other wearables. I tried this out, and one thing stood out: Apple is way too easy on me. </p><p>I’m kidding, sort of. Yes, Apple’s scores are consistently higher than those I get from other wearables, but it’s not like I can definitively say Apple is wrong or Oura is right. I think of a sleep score like a grade on an essay: A bad essay will probably get a bad grade, and a good essay will probably get a good grade, but it’s not like every teacher in the world would agree that your take on <em>Moby Dick</em>’s symbolism deserves exactly a 92%. You may feel like you got away with something if your mid essay comes back with an A+, but as long as the prof is consistent with their grading scheme, you can’t say your grade was <em>wrong</em>. </p><div>\n        <p><img src=\"https://lifehacker.com/images/short-lifehacker-logo.jpg\" alt=\"Lifehacker Logo\" /></p><div>\n            <p><span>You May Also Like</span></p>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n<p>That’s why the accuracy of sleep scores doesn't matter a ton, in my opinion. The World Sleep Society more or less agrees, <a href=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S138994572500173X\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"open in a new window\"><u>saying</u></a> not to read too much into individual scores, but instead keep an eye on trends, like whether your sleep seems to be getting better or worse over time. </p><h2 id=\"how-apples-sleep-scores-measure-up-to-oura-garmin-and-whoop\">How Apple's sleep scores measure up to Oura, Garmin, and Whoop</h2><p>With all of that in mind, I thought it would be interesting to compare my last month or so of Apple sleep scores to those I get from the Oura ring, plus a few data points from my Garmin and Whoop devices. </p><p>Apple calculates your sleep score based on your sleep duration, bedtime consistency, and interruptions. Competing devices each have their own algorithm. Apple can calculate its score based on the data from any device, not just an Apple Watch, so in some cases the Oura and Apple scores are actually using the same underlying data. </p><p>Here are the results: </p><div>\n            <p><span>\n                What do you think so far?\n            </span>\n        </p></div>\n<div>\n    <p><img src=\"https://lifehacker.com/imagery/articles/01K5HC64V6NFCF4R5VN2RK9C8M/images-1.fill.size_2000x1125.v1758298575.png\" alt=\"Graph of Apple, Oura, Garmin, and Whoop sleep scores\" srcset=\"https://lifehacker.com/imagery/articles/01K5HC64V6NFCF4R5VN2RK9C8M/images-1.fill.size_800x450.v1758298575.png 800w, https://lifehacker.com/imagery/articles/01K5HC64V6NFCF4R5VN2RK9C8M/images-1.fill.size_1400x788.v1758298575.png 1400w, https://lifehacker.com/imagery/articles/01K5HC64V6NFCF4R5VN2RK9C8M/images-1.fill.size_2000x1125.v1758298575.png 2000w\" />\n            </p>\n            <p><span>Apple is the red line at the top—usually grading me higher than its competitors.</span>\n                                        <span>Credit: Beth Skwarecki</span>\n                    </p>\n    </div>\n<p>Apple says that over the past month, my most frequent sleep score level is “excellent,” earned on 17 nights. I also had a “high” sleep score on 10 nights, with just one night of “OK” sleep, one of “low” sleep, and no nights “very low.”</p><p>My major takeaway is that Apple’s scores are almost always higher than those I get from other devices. That said, they tend to go up when the others go up, and down when the others go down, which means that all of these scores are probably useful when looked at from a big-picture point of view. </p><p>Subjectively, I don’t think my sleep has been all that good lately. I’ve been staying up late more often than I’d like, and waking up tired more often than not. I’d judge it as mostly OK, occasionally poor, and sometimes good. But that’s just, like, my opinion, man. </p><p>It is true that there’s probably nothing medically wrong with me, and I don't think my sleep is drastically poor—so maybe Apple’s rosy outlook is just a better way to think about my sleep. It’s OK to be a straight-A student sometimes. </p>\n            </article>\n    </div>\n<div>\n    <div>\n        <p><span>The Daily Newsletter</span>\n            <span>Ready to do everything better?</span>\n        </p>\n        <p><img src=\"https://lifehacker.com/images/team/Jordan.png\" alt=\"Jordan Calhoun portrait\" />\n            <span>Jordan Calhoun\n            </span>\n            <span>Editor in chief</span>\n        </p>\n        <p><span><span>Get daily tips, tricks, <span>and tech guides</span></span> <span>from Jordan and the team.</span></span>\n    </p></div>\n    <div>\n        <p><span>The Daily Newsletter</span>\n            <span><span>Ready to do everything better?</span> <span>Get daily tips, tricks, <span>and tech guides</span></span> <span>from Jordan and the team.</span></span>\n        </p>\n    </div>\n</div>\n    </div>\n            <div>\n                <p><span>\n                        Keep Scrolling for Next Article\n                    </span>\n                </p>\n            </div>\n        </div>\n    </div>"

these days. It’s <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/tech/disable-gmail-automatic-gemini-ai-summaries?test_uuid=015ZvAUxXams0rnBpajhMg2&test_variant=B\" target=\"_blank\">in your Gmail</a>, it’s <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/tech/why-gemini-is-replacing-google-assistant?test_uuid=015ZvAUxXams0rnBpajhMg2&test_variant=B\" target=\"_blank\">on your phone</a>, and soon, it’ll be in your browser. While Google’s AI browser integration was already live for Google AI Pro and AI Ultra subscribers, it's now <a href=\"https://blog.google/products/chrome/new-ai-features-for-chrome/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"open in a new window\">rolling out to everyone</a>—and getting a bunch of new features, too.</p><p>If you’re suddenly seeing a new Gemini button in the top right of your Chrome browser (in the same pane as your tabs), then you’ve already been hit with the update. If not, you may need to use the three-dots button in the top right corner and select <strong>Gemini in Chrome</strong> to turn it on, assuming you want to.</p><h2 id=\"how-to-use-gemini-in-chrome\">How to use Gemini in Chrome</h2><p>When you click the Gemini button, or summon it via a keyboard shortcut (Alt + G by default), you’ll be able to try out the same features Google’s paying customers have had access to for a while. That means Gemini will be able to answer questions about the webpage you’re on, or just answer general questions unrelated to what you’re browsing. Or, if you’re in a Google app or on a Google website, it’ll be able to take some simple actions for you, like jumping you to a specific spot in a YouTube video.</p><div>\n        <p><img src=\"https://lifehacker.com/images/short-lifehacker-logo.jpg\" alt=\"Lifehacker Logo\" /></p><div>\n            <p><span>You May Also Like</span></p>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n<p>Additionally, Gemini can also now work across your tabs and compare information between them. Simply start a dialogue with Gemini by tapping the button in the top right corner, and at the bottom of the window, click “Add tab” to give Gemini another source of data to consider.</p><p>Weirdly, while these updates are already pushing live to average folks, Google says businesses will need to wait a couple of weeks, so they can get “enterprise-grade data protections and controls.”</p><p>As of now, aside from the new access, it’s not the biggest update, especially because to try it, you need to be on Windows or Mac, have your language set to English, and be in the U.S.. Google stresses that the Gemini Assistant on Android can also help you browse Chrome, and that it’s working to bring more direct Gemini in Chrome access to both its Android and iOS apps.</p><h2 id=\"more-ai-browsing-is-coming\">More AI browsing is coming</h2><p>Google says it also has big things in store for the feature, with “agentic browsing” set for the “coming months.” This will supposedly let Gemini in Chrome complete tasks, like booking a haircut for you, or ordering your groceries. Alternatively, it’ll also help you browse a bit more easily, as Google says it’s working to let you ask Gemini questions about your browser history when you want to go back to a specific page. For instance, “what was the website where I saw the walnut desk last week?” could take you back to a shopping page you only vaguely remember.</p><div>\n            <p><span>\n                What do you think so far?\n            </span>\n        </p></div>\n<p>A more powerful address bar is apparently in the works that will let you ask questions of Google’s AI model without having to navigate to it first. For now, Gemini in Chrome will start suggesting questions to ask it about whatever page you’re on, right in the address bar.</p><p>The update includes a few security updates too, although they mostly seem to work in the backend, supposedly using AI to better block scammy ads and notifications. Now that’s the type of AI integration I can support wholeheartedly.</p><h2 id=\"how-to-turn-off-gemini-in-chrome\">How to turn off Gemini in Chrome</h2><p>All that said, if you’re a bit skeptical about Gemini in Chrome, you can turn it off. Simply navigate to <strong>Settings > AI Innovations</strong>, and you’ll be able to turn off the Gemini button, as well as disable its keyboard shortcut. You can also restrict its permissions: Set everything to off, and it’ll be like it was never installed in the first place.</p>\n            </article>\n    </div>\n<div>\n    <div>\n        <p><span>The Download Newsletter</span>\n            <span>Never miss a tech story</span>\n        </p>\n        <p><img src=\"https://lifehacker.com/images/team/Jake.png\" alt=\"Jake Peterson portrait\" />\n            <span>Jake Peterson\n            </span>\n            <span>Senior tech editor</span>\n        </p>\n        <p><span>Get the latest tech news, <span></span>reviews, <span></span>and advice from Jake and the team.</span>\n    </p></div>\n    <div>\n        <p><span>The Download Newsletter</span>\n            <span><span>Never miss a tech story.</span> Get the latest tech news, <span></span>reviews, <span></span>and advice from Jake and the team.</span>\n        </p>\n    </div>\n</div>\n    </div>\n            <div>\n                <p><span>\n                        Keep Scrolling for Next Article\n                    </span>\n                </p>\n            </div>\n        </div>\n    </div>"

    "body": "<article>\n        <hr />\n        <p>Strava's <a href=\"https://support.strava.com/hc/en-us/articles/39113532401421-Training-Zones-on-Strava\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"open in a new window\">new Training Zones</a> feature promises to help runners and cyclists better understand their training load across metrics like heart rate, power, and pace. That sounds like useful information, but if you've recently discovered that most of your runs fall into what's commonly called the \"gray zone\" (<a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/health/benefits-of-zone-3-cardio\" target=\"_blank\">Zone 3</a>), take a deep breath: You aren't doing everything wrong, you don't need to panic, and you definitely don't need to completely overhaul your training.</p><p>Here's why—and how you can use training zones as the helpful tool they're meant to be, rather than as a source of anxiety.</p><h2 id=\"what-are-training-zones\">What are training zones?</h2><p>Before diving into how Strava offers insights into training zones, let's quickly go over what they really are. As Lifehacker senior health editor Beth Skwarecki has <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/what-are-heart-rate-zones-and-how-can-you-find-yours-1848061616\" target=\"_blank\">previously explained</a>, talk of different zones is overhyped, since these zones aren't clearly defined. </p>\n<p>Most talked about is <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/what-is-zone-2-cardio\" target=\"_blank\">the coveted</a> Zone 2, even though <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/what-is-zone-2-cardio-its-complicated\" target=\"_blank\">no one can agree on what exactly it is</a>. On the flip side, I always see warnings about Zone 3 being the \"no man's land\" of training—too hard to be easy, too easy to be hard. This dread is <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/health/benefits-of-zone-3-cardio?test_uuid=015ZvAUxXams0rnBpajhMg2&test_variant=A\" target=\"_blank\">overblown</a>. </p><p>Zone 2 training is celebrated because it helps build your aerobic base and burns calories without incurring significant fatigue. But guess what Zone 3 training also does? It builds your aerobic base, it burns even more calories, and it typically adds only marginally more fatigue than Zone 2. For most recreational runners, the difference between the zones is far less dramatic than <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Marathon_Training/comments/1achhxq/zone_3_training/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"open in a new window\">the online discourse</a> suggests.</p><p>Heart rate zones are indeed a completely valid way to describe how hard you're working during a cardio workout. But it's hardly a matter of \"Zone 2 good, Zone 3 bad,\" particularly given that different devices and apps define the zones differently. Your \"Zone 2\" might be 60% to 70% of max heart rate on an Apple Watch, but 65% to 75% on a Peloton. At 73% of your max heart rate, the Apple Watch would categorize your effort as Zone 3, while the Peloton would call it Zone 2. Which is right? Neither, really—because these boundaries are largely arbitrary.</p><p>The concept of training zones is sound when considered in the right context, but the specific percentages and boundaries aren't set in stone. They're guidelines, not gospel. Your physiology doesn't magically change the moment you cross from 69% to 71% of your max heart rate. And if you're a recreational runner focused on health and enjoyment, the difference between Zone 2 and Zone 3 is a mere technicality. </p><p>Strava's Training Zones use a familiar five-zone system. The feature allows you to filter by sport and analyze training load across different timeframes (seven days, one month, and three months), providing insights into how your training varies across activities.</p><p><strong>Heart Rate Zones:</strong></p><ul><li><p>Zone 1 – Endurance</p></li><li><p>Zone 2 – Moderate</p></li><li><p>Zone 3 – Tempo</p></li><li><p>Zone 4 – Threshold</p></li><li><p>Zone 5 – Anaerobic</p></li></ul><p>These zones indicate exercise intensity levels and are automatically calculated based on your max heart rate. Strava uses the standard formula of 220 minus your age, defaulting to 190 bpm if no age is provided. Your zones update automatically on your birthday unless you've manually set your max heart rate.</p><div>\n            <p><span>\n                What do you think so far?\n            </span>\n        </p></div>\n<h2 id=\"adjust-your-strava-training-zones-to-eliminate-your-workout-anxiety\">Adjust your Strava Training Zones to eliminate your workout anxiety </h2><p>Luckily, you don't need to accept the default settings as law. Strava allows subscribers to set different heart rate zones for running versus cycling, and you can adjust these zones anytime. </p><p>When you scroll down in the <strong>Progress</strong> tab on Strava, you'll see <strong>Training Zones</strong>. Within that menu, select the <strong>Pencil</strong> (edit) icon. If you know your actual max heart rate from testing, use that instead of the age-based estimated maximum.</p><div>\n    <p><img src=\"https://lifehacker.com/imagery/articles/01K5ENR9BVKXVE242YNMZT7DZZ/images-1.fill.size_2000x1125.v1758207944.png\" alt=\"Training Zones in Strava\" srcset=\"https://lifehacker.com/imagery/articles/01K5ENR9BVKXVE242YNMZT7DZZ/images-1.fill.size_800x450.v1758207944.png 800w, https://lifehacker.com/imagery/articles/01K5ENR9BVKXVE242YNMZT7DZZ/images-1.fill.size_1400x788.v1758207944.png 1400w, https://lifehacker.com/imagery/articles/01K5ENR9BVKXVE242YNMZT7DZZ/images-1.fill.size_2000x1125.v1758207944.png 2000w\" />\n            </p>\n            <p><span>You can manually edit your training zones in Strava.</span>\n                                        <span>Credit: Meredith Dietz</span>\n                    </p>\n    </div>\n<p>Even if you don't have exact numbers, you can adjust your zones based on feel. Your <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/health/talk-test-better-than-heart-rate-zones?test_uuid=015ZvAUxXams0rnBpajhMg2&test_variant=A\" target=\"_blank\">perceived exertion</a> might be a better guide than your heart rate monitor. Toggle the \"auto-calculate\" option to manually adjust each individual heart rate zone. If Strava tells you you're in Zone 3-4, but you can easily hold a conversation during that workout, you could then widen the range for Zone 2 to more accurately reflect what you know to be lower effort for you. When a run feels easy and conversational, it's probably serving its purpose, regardless of whether your device says you're in Zone 2 or Zone 3.</p><p>Instead of obsessing over individual workout zones, examine your training distribution over weeks and months. Are you doing mostly easy runs with some harder efforts? That's what matters, not whether your easy pace puts you at the top of Zone 2 or bottom of Zone 3.</p><h2 id=\"the-bottom-line\">The bottom line</h2><p>Training zones should inform your training, not dictate it. They're tools to help you understand intensity and plan progression, not rigid boundaries that determine success or failure. Strava's Training Zones feature can provide valuable insights into your training patterns and help you make more informed decisions about your workouts. </p><p>The next time your watch beeps to tell you you've crossed into Zone 3, remember: The boundaries aren't real, but how your body feels is.</p>\n            </article>"
