A Zoox spokesperson confirmed that it has submitted a petition for a “555 exemption” and continues to work closely with the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration through this new exemption process. </p>\n<p>An NHTSA spokesperson told TechCrunch that Zoox applied for a temporary exemption from eight Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standards applicable to its passenger car equipped with an automated driving system. The NHTSA is reviewing Zoox’s application and will publish a notice seeking public comment after the agency conducts its initial review.</p>\n<p>The request follows two milestones that put Zoox closer to operating a commercial robotaxi service.</p>\n<p>Earlier this month, Zoox launched a <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/09/10/zoox-opens-its-las-vegas-robotaxi-service-to-the-public/\">free robotaxi service</a> that is open to the public in Las Vegas. And in August, the NHTSA gave <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/08/06/federal-regulators-give-zoox-an-exemption-for-its-custom-built-robotaxis/\">Zoox an exemption</a> to demonstrate its custom-built robotaxis on public roads.</p>\n<p>While the August exemption cleared up a long-standing debate over whether Zoox’s custom-built autonomous vehicles complied with federal motor vehicle safety standards, it only covered research and demonstrations on public roads. This latest application is separate and would broaden the scope and pave the way for Zoox to launch a commercial robotaxi service.</p>\n<p>The NHTSA’s exemption in August was part of the agency’s expanded Automated Vehicle Exemption Program, which allows for demonstration of its vehicles on public roads.</p>\n<div>\n\t\t<p>Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t<p><span>San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>October 27-29, 2025</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n<div>\n\t<p>Topics</p>\n</div>\n</div><div><div>\n\t<div>\n\t\t<p>Subscribe for the industry’s biggest tech news</p>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n<p></p><h2 id=\"h-latest-in\">Latest in Transportation</h2><p></p>\n</div>"

    "body": "<div>\n<p>On Wednesday, Enterprise AI model maker Cohere said it raised an additional $100 million — bumping its valuation to $7 billion — in an extension to a round announced in August. The August round was an <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/08/14/cohere-hits-a-6-8b-valuation-as-investors-amd-nvidia-and-salesforce-double-down/\">oversubscribed $500 million round</a> at a $6.8 billion valuation, the company said at the time.</p>\n<p>Cohere also announced an interesting twist on a partnership. While competitor OpenAI <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/09/22/nvidia-plans-to-invest-up-to-100b-in-openai/\">just nabbed an up-to $100 billion investment</a> from the biggest GPU player, Nvidia, Cohere <a href=\"https://cohere.com/blog/september-2025-funding-round\" target=\"_blank\">has signed a dea</a>l with AMD, which is one of its investors.</p>\n<p>The company’s full suite of Command-family AI models, including the Command vision, translate, and reasoning models, can now run on AMD’s Instinct GPU, an Nvidia GPU competitor. Moreover, AMD will be using Cohere internally as a customer. Cohere is not, however, abandoning support of Nvidia GPUs to strictly support AMD, the company tells TechCrunch.</p>\n<p>Cohere began as a front-runner in the AI model race. It was co-founded in 2019 by Aidan Gomez, one of the authors of the “<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attention_Is_All_You_Need\" target=\"_blank\">transformer</a>” paper that gave rise to the modern generative AI boom.</p>\n<p>But, while a zero-to-$7 billion valuation in six years would have been awe-inspiring a decade ago, Cohere has since been overshadowed by the blindingly fast rise of OpenAI and its closest competitor Anthropic. OpenAI, for instance, was <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2025/08/15/openai-6-billion-stock-500-billion-valuation.html\" target=\"_blank\">reportedly valued at $500 billion</a> last month while Anthropic <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/09/02/anthropic-raises-13b-series-f-at-183b-valuation/\">hit a $183 billion valuation</a> early this month.</p>\n<p>Cohere, which has always focused on the enterprise market, is now marketing itself to enterprises where AI sovereignty is urgent — that is, keeping local control of the data and models, rather than putting them in the hands of a foreign entity. To that end, Business Development Bank of Canada (BDC) and <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.nexxuscapital.net/\">Nexxus Capital Management</a> (known for its Singapore network) were new investors in this fresh $100 million round, Cohere says.</p>\n<p><em>Correction: This story has been updated to reflect the international association of investor Nexxus. </em></p>\n<div>\n\t\t<p>Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t<p><span>San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>October 27-29, 2025</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>"

If you want to bring the end screen back, you can tap the Show button.</p>\n<p>The decision to let users hide end screens is a welcome addition to the platform, especially since they can end up covering the last bit of a video and make it hard to see what’s happening in some cases.</p>\n<p>The company also announced that it’s removing the Subscribe button that appears when you hover your cursor over a video’s branded watermark. YouTube explains that it’s doing so because there’s already a Subscribe button directly below the video player.</p>\n<p>YouTube says it’s launching the new features in response to user feedback, as many people said they wanted the option to minimize distractions on videos and for it to be easier to focus on the content they’re currently watching. </p>\n<p>As for creators, YouTube notes that they still have the option to add end screens to videos. The company expects these changes to have a minimal impact on creators’ performance and view count on the platform. </p>\n<p>For instance, YouTube found in an experiment that giving users the option to hide end screens resulted in a less than 1.5% decrease in views from end screens. Plus, it found that less than ~0.05% of all Channel subscriptions come from the hover-to-subscribe functionality on the video watermark. </p>\n<div>\n\t\t<p>Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t<p><span>San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>October 27-29, 2025</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\t\t\t<div>\n\t<p>Topics</p>\n</div>\n<div>\n<div>\n\t\t<p>Aisha is a consumer news reporter at TechCrunch.

Since then, it has introduced smartphones under the brand as well.</p>\n<p>Nothing said that it is partnering with Indian ODM (Original Design Manufacturer) Optiemus to create a joint venture for manufacturing. While the startup didn’t reveal the ownership structure of this venture, it said that it aims to invest more than $100 million over the next three years, while creating over 1,800 jobs.</p>\n<p>The London-based startup, following its <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/09/15/nothing-closes-200m-series-c-led-by-tiger-global-plans-ai-first-device-launch/\">$200 million funding round led by Tiger Global,</a> didn’t say how much money from this round will go into setting up this new venture.</p>\n<p>Nothing’s decision to choose India as CMF’s operational headquarters makes sense for a few reasons.

IDC told TechCrunch via email that Nothing was the fastest-growing brand in the country in Q2 2025, with 85% growth in shipments year over year.</p>\n<p>“India will play a key role in shaping the future of the global smartphone industry. CMF has been well-received by the market since we launched it two years ago. With our end-to-end capabilities, we are uniquely positioned to now build it into India’s first truly global smartphone brand. Our joint venture with Optiemus is a key milestone toward making that vision a reality,” Nothing’s CEO Carl Pei said in a statement. </p>\n<div>\n\t\t<p>Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t<p><span>San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>October 27-29, 2025</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n<p>The company’s move comes after it poached Himanshu Tondon from <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://brandequity.economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/the-people-report/nothing-appoints-himanshu-tandon-as-vice-president-of-business-of-its-sub-brand-cmf/123560056\">Xiaomi’s spin-off brand POCO</a> last month to be VP of Business for CMF. </p>\n</div>\n\t\t\t<div>\n\t<p>Topics</p>\n</div>\n<div>\n<div>\n\t\t<p>Ivan covers global consumer tech developments at TechCrunch.

    "body": "<div>\n<p>Google is turning its vast public data trove into a goldmine for AI with the debut of the Data Commons Model Context Protocol (MCP) Server — enabling developers, data scientists, and AI agents to access real-world statistics using natural language and better train AI systems.</p>\n<p>Launched in 2018, Google’s Data Commons organizes public datasets from a <a href=\"https://datacommons.org/data/\" target=\"_blank\">range of sources</a>, including government surveys, local administrative data, and statistics from global bodies such as the United Nations. With the release of the MCP Server, this data is now accessible via natural language, allowing developers to integrate it into AI agents or applications.</p>\n<p>AI systems are often trained on noisy, unverified web data. Combined with their <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/09/07/are-bad-incentives-to-blame-for-ai-hallucinations/\" target=\"_blank\">tendency to “fill in the blanks”</a> when sources are lacking, this <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/08/14/study-suggests-that-even-the-best-ai-models-hallucinate-a-bunch/\" target=\"_blank\">leads to hallucinations</a>. As a result, companies looking to fine-tune AI systems for specific use cases often need access to large, high-quality datasets. By publicly releasing the MCP Server for its Data Commons, Google aims to tackle both challenges.</p>\n<p>Data Commons’ new MCP server bridges public datasets — from census figures to climate statistics — with AI systems that increasingly depend on accurate, structured context. By making this data accessible via natural language prompts, the release aims to ground AI in verifiable, real-world information.</p>\n<p>“The Model Context Protocol is letting us use the intelligence of the large language model to pick the right data at the right time, without having to understand how we model the data, how our API works,” said Google Data Commons head Prem Ramaswami in an interview.</p>\n<figure><img src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/google-data-commons-mcp-server-gemini.jpg\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/google-data-commons-mcp-server-gemini.jpg 1920w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/google-data-commons-mcp-server-gemini.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/google-data-commons-mcp-server-gemini.jpg?resize=300,201 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/google-data-commons-mcp-server-gemini.jpg?resize=768,514 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/google-data-commons-mcp-server-gemini.jpg?resize=680,455 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/google-data-commons-mcp-server-gemini.jpg?resize=1200,803 1200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/google-data-commons-mcp-server-gemini.jpg?resize=1280,857 1280w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/google-data-commons-mcp-server-gemini.jpg?resize=430,288 430w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/google-data-commons-mcp-server-gemini.jpg?resize=720,482 720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/google-data-commons-mcp-server-gemini.jpg?resize=900,602 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/google-data-commons-mcp-server-gemini.jpg?resize=800,535 800w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/google-data-commons-mcp-server-gemini.jpg?resize=1536,1028 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/google-data-commons-mcp-server-gemini.jpg?resize=668,447 668w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/google-data-commons-mcp-server-gemini.jpg?resize=560,375 560w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/google-data-commons-mcp-server-gemini.jpg?resize=922,617 922w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/google-data-commons-mcp-server-gemini.jpg?resize=708,474 708w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/google-data-commons-mcp-server-gemini.jpg?resize=50,33 50w\" /><figcaption><span>A Sample of Google Data Commons MCP Server connecting AI with real-world Data</span><span><strong>Image Credits:</strong>Google</span></figcaption></figure>\n<p>First <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/11/25/anthropic-proposes-a-way-to-connect-data-to-ai-chatbots/\" target=\"_blank\">introduced by Anthropic last November</a>, MCP is an open industry standard that enables AI systems to access data from various sources, including business tools, content repositories, and app development environments, providing a common framework for understanding contextual prompts.

    "body": "<div>\n<p>Waymo’s ever-expanding robotaxi aspirations have spread to the corporate world. </p>\n<p>The Alphabet-owned self-driving vehicle unit has launched “Waymo for Business,” a new service designed for companies to set up accounts so their employees can access robotaxis in cities like Los Angeles, Phoenix, and San Francisco. </p>\n<p>Waymo announced Wednesday in a <a href=\"https://waymo.com/blog/2025/09/waymo-for-business\" target=\"_blank\">blog post</a> it is inviting organizations to sign up for Waymo for Business. The new service will let businesses subsidize their employees’ rides or purchase promo codes in bulk, which can be handed out to clients, customers, or workers. The Waymo for Business rides will cost the same as its regular service.</p>\n<p>One of Waymo’s first customers is Carvana, the Phoenix-based online used car marketplace. </p>\n<p>While riders already use Waymo’s robotaxis to commute to work, this is the company’s first coordinated commercial effort to target corporations and other organizations.

    "body": "<div>\n<p>For decades, Silicon Valley has valorized the college dropout. Founders like Bill Gates, Steve Jobs, and Mark Zuckerberg left school early to build companies and they became billionaires. </p>\n<p>That ethos was later institutionalized through initiatives like the Thiel Fellowship, which famously pays promising students $100,000 to leave college and start companies.</p>\n<p>For many years, the famed accelerator Y Combinator also quietly reinforced that culture. While it never explicitly required students to drop out, many of its most successful alumni, including Dropbox’s Drew Houston, Reddit’s Steve Huffman, and Stripe’s John and Patrick Collison, joined the program young and left school behind to build their companies.</p>\n<p>Now YC is changing that narrative.</p>\n<p>The accelerator has introduced a new application track called Early Decision, designed for students who want to start companies but don’t want to drop out. The program allows them to apply while still in school, get accepted and funded immediately, and defer their participation in YC until after they graduate. For example, a student applying in fall 2025 could graduate in spring 2026, then participate in YC’s Summer 2026 batch.</p>\n<p>“It’s designed for graduating seniors who want to do a startup but also want to finish school first,” said YC managing partner Jared Friedman in the launch video. </p>\n<p>Friedman added that the idea for Early Decision came from conversations with students. “Between AI Startup School last summer and the more than 20 university trips we’ve done over the past year, we’ve had a lot of opportunities to do that. One of YC’s most common pieces of advice is to ‘talk to your users,’ and we follow it ourselves,” he told TechCrunch over email. </p>\n<div>\n\t\t<p>Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t<p><span>San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>October 27-29, 2025</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n<p>In Silicon Valley culture, dropping out has been almost a rite of passage for aspiring founders Programs like the Thiel Fellowship have turned it into a movement (though it’s worth noting that Peter Thiel himself did not drop out but earned both undergraduate and law degrees from Stanford). </p>\n<p>It’s why YC’s announcement is a meaningful break from that mythos that leaving school early is the optimal, or only, path to startup success. The timing is also significant, coming at a time when more young people are questioning both the cost of college and the trade-offs of staying in school. </p>\n<p>The new program also reflects a growing maturity in how YC thinks about long-term founder outcomes.</p>\n<p>The accelerator has long been a magnet for college-aged builders. Founders of Loom, Instacart, Rappi, and Brex were in their teens or early twenties when they joined the program. But the decision to drop out was often implicit: Do the program now or miss the opportunity.</p>\n<p>Early Decision removes that pressure, offering a middle ground between academic completion and chasing entrepreneurship. The move could broaden YC’s applicant pool to include more cautious, deliberate student founders who are committed to startup life but unwilling to sacrifice education to get there.</p>\n<figure></figure>\n<p>In its <a href=\"https://www.ycombinator.com/early-decision\" target=\"_blank\">announcement</a>, YC highlights Sneha Sivakumar and Anushka Nijhawan, the co-founders of Spur, as a success story from this approach. Spur builds AI-powered quality-assurance testing tools, and the duo applied to YC through Early Decision in fall 2023 while still in school. They graduated in May 2024, joined the Summer 2024 YC batch and have since raised $4.5 million. </p>\n<p>YC notes that the program is open to both graduating students and those earlier in their academic journey. It’s a bet that some of the best founders of the next decade won’t need to choose between college and startups. They’ll do both. </p>\n<p>The move also helps YC secure talent early in an increasingly competitive accelerator and seed funding landscape, giving students an option that competes with other programs like Thiel Fellowship, Neo Scholars, Founders Inc, as well as Big Tech internships and grad school pipelines.</p>\n</div><div>\n<div>\n\t\t<p>Tage Kene-Okafor is a reporter at TechCrunch based in Lagos, Nigeria, covering the intersection of startups and venture capital in Africa.

That wasn’t a target we wanted to pursue.”</p>\n<p>What followed were months of rapid experiments between last December and April, with pivots around ideas in areas like fashion and sports, none of which stuck. “We tried more than 10 different ideas in the span of four or five months,” Ruber said.</p>\n<p>The pressure began to strain their own relationships with friends and partners, a familiar story for many early-stage founders. Ironically, that tension sparked the idea that would finally click.</p>\n<p>The first version was simple: a swipeable deck of questions designed to spark conversations with their partners. Then an intern, now marketing lead at the startup, shared a TikTok about the app that went viral, unexpectedly gaining traction in Europe.</p>\n<div>\n\t\t<p>Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t<p><span>San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>October 27-29, 2025</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n<p>Downloads surged, feedback poured in, and the team leaned into the momentum.

The company says more than 250,000 are active each month, with a DAU/MAU ratio of around 50%, a strong signal of engagement for a consumer social app and an early sign of daily habit potential. Candle has also ranked in Apple’s App Store top 25 multiple times.</p>\n<p>Candle’s wedge is sustaining existing relationships with small, daily prompts and games rather than helping people find new ones. Users answer quick questions, compare results, share photos, and keep a “streak” that shows how consistently they’ve checked in. The mechanics are textbook mobile engagement aimed at Gen Z and young millennials.</p>\n<p>In another atypical move for a consumer social app — but one more common among newer AI-native products — monetization has come early. Candle’s monthly revenue recently crossed $150,000, implying an annual run rate above $1 million.</p>\n<p>The app runs on a freemium model: The free tier offers daily prompts, photo updates, and core games, while premium unlocks extra content and features.</p>\n<p>While growth remains a priority for the startup, monetizing early is a strong signal of product-market fit. “At the end of the day, this app helps people strengthen their connections. Most of it is free, but when users pay for extra content and features, it shows real product-market fit,” the CEO said.</p>\n<p>The months-old platform is one of the few apps in the space, alongside <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/27/paired-pulls-in-3-6m-to-encourage-more-couples-to-get-cosy-with-app-based-relationship-care/\">Paired</a> and Couple Joy, designed to make relationships more fun. These apps are tapping into a cultural undertow where post-pandemic work habits, solo meals, and endless social feeds have hollowed out day-to-day connections and <a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2024/09/loneliness-epidemic-friendship-shortage/679689/?taid=66e7daf9c846530001aa4d26&utm_campaign=the-atlantic&utm_content=true-anthem&utm_medium=social&utm_source=twitter\" target=\"_blank\">left people in the U.S. lonelier than ever</a>.</p>\n<p>For Candle, the bet is that the next wave of social at scale will be less about broadcasting to strangers and more about making it easier to show up daily for a few close people. That insight, combined with its founder and creator-led distribution engine across TikTok and Instagram, is how the team hopes to avoid the fate of many consumer social apps that surge quickly only to stall months later.</p>\n<p>Still, the big questions remain: durability and depth. Can a daily photo-and-game app sustain 12-, 24-, or 36-month retention curves? Can Candle expand from lightweight prompts into a broader suite of “connection types” without bloating the experience? Ruber and CTO Chopra say that’s the roadmap: adding more ways to earn “sparks,” the app’s point system, for a wider range of interactions, and introducing richer features that promote consistency.</p>\n<p>The seed money raised for the team’s earlier shopping app will now give Candle the resources to bring on more engineers, speed up experimentation, and scale faster. Existing backers, including Goodwater Capital, Pioneer Fund, Progression Fund, and Y Combinator, are fully behind the new direction, Ruber said.</p>\n</div>"
