A Zoox spokesperson confirmed that it has submitted a petition for a “555 exemption” and continues to work closely with the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration through this new exemption process. </p>\n<p>An NHTSA spokesperson told TechCrunch that Zoox applied for a temporary exemption from eight Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standards applicable to its passenger car equipped with an automated driving system. The NHTSA is reviewing Zoox’s application and will publish a notice seeking public comment after the agency conducts its initial review.</p>\n<p>The request follows two milestones that put Zoox closer to operating a commercial robotaxi service.</p>\n<p>Earlier this month, Zoox launched a <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/09/10/zoox-opens-its-las-vegas-robotaxi-service-to-the-public/\">free robotaxi service</a> that is open to the public in Las Vegas. And in August, the NHTSA gave <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/08/06/federal-regulators-give-zoox-an-exemption-for-its-custom-built-robotaxis/\">Zoox an exemption</a> to demonstrate its custom-built robotaxis on public roads.</p>\n<p>While the August exemption cleared up a long-standing debate over whether Zoox’s custom-built autonomous vehicles complied with federal motor vehicle safety standards, it only covered research and demonstrations on public roads. This latest application is separate and would broaden the scope and pave the way for Zoox to launch a commercial robotaxi service.</p>\n<p>The NHTSA’s exemption in August was part of the agency’s expanded Automated Vehicle Exemption Program, which allows for demonstration of its vehicles on public roads.</p>\n<div>\n\t\t<p>Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t<p><span>San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>October 27-29, 2025</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n<div>\n\t<p>Topics</p>\n</div>\n</div><div><div>\n\t<div>\n\t\t<p>Subscribe for the industry’s biggest tech news</p>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n<p></p><h2 id=\"h-latest-in\">Latest in Transportation</h2><p></p>\n</div>"

Now when you see an end screen, you can tap a new “Hide” button in the top-right corner of the video player to hide the pop-ups from the current video you’re watching.</p>\n<p>Selecting this button will only hide end screens for the current video you’re watching, not for all videos on the platform, the company notes. If you want to bring the end screen back, you can tap the Show button.</p>\n<p>The decision to let users hide end screens is a welcome addition to the platform, especially since they can end up covering the last bit of a video and make it hard to see what’s happening in some cases.</p>\n<p>The company also announced that it’s removing the Subscribe button that appears when you hover your cursor over a video’s branded watermark. YouTube explains that it’s doing so because there’s already a Subscribe button directly below the video player.</p>\n<p>YouTube says it’s launching the new features in response to user feedback, as many people said they wanted the option to minimize distractions on videos and for it to be easier to focus on the content they’re currently watching. </p>\n<p>As for creators, YouTube notes that they still have the option to add end screens to videos. The company expects these changes to have a minimal impact on creators’ performance and view count on the platform. </p>\n<p>For instance, YouTube found in an experiment that giving users the option to hide end screens resulted in a less than 1.5% decrease in views from end screens. Plus, it found that less than ~0.05% of all Channel subscriptions come from the hover-to-subscribe functionality on the video watermark. </p>\n<div>\n\t\t<p>Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t<p><span>San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>October 27-29, 2025</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\t\t\t<div>\n\t<p>Topics</p>\n</div>\n<div>\n<div>\n\t\t<p>Aisha is a consumer news reporter at TechCrunch.

The August round was an <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/08/14/cohere-hits-a-6-8b-valuation-as-investors-amd-nvidia-and-salesforce-double-down/\">oversubscribed $500 million round</a> at a $6.8 billion valuation, the company said at the time.</p>\n<p>Cohere also announced an interesting twist on a partnership. While competitor OpenAI <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/09/22/nvidia-plans-to-invest-up-to-100b-in-openai/\">just nabbed an up-to $100 billion investment</a> from the biggest GPU player, Nvidia, Cohere <a href=\"https://cohere.com/blog/september-2025-funding-round\" target=\"_blank\">has signed a dea</a>l with AMD, which is one of its investors.</p>\n<p>The company’s full suite of Command-family AI models, including the Command vision, translate, and reasoning models, can now run on AMD’s Instinct GPU, an Nvidia GPU competitor. Moreover, AMD will be using Cohere internally as a customer. Cohere is not, however, abandoning support of Nvidia GPUs to strictly support AMD, the company tells TechCrunch.</p>\n<p>Cohere began as a front-runner in the AI model race. It was co-founded in 2019 by Aidan Gomez, one of the authors of the “<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attention_Is_All_You_Need\" target=\"_blank\">transformer</a>” paper that gave rise to the modern generative AI boom.</p>\n<p>But, while a zero-to-$7 billion valuation in six years would have been awe-inspiring a decade ago, Cohere has since been overshadowed by the blindingly fast rise of OpenAI and its closest competitor Anthropic. OpenAI, for instance, was <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2025/08/15/openai-6-billion-stock-500-billion-valuation.html\" target=\"_blank\">reportedly valued at $500 billion</a> last month while Anthropic <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/09/02/anthropic-raises-13b-series-f-at-183b-valuation/\">hit a $183 billion valuation</a> early this month.</p>\n<p>Cohere, which has always focused on the enterprise market, is now marketing itself to enterprises where AI sovereignty is urgent — that is, keeping local control of the data and models, rather than putting them in the hands of a foreign entity. To that end, Business Development Bank of Canada (BDC) and Nexxus Capital Management (known for its Mexico and Iberia funds) were new investors in this fresh $100 million round, Cohere says.</p>\n<div>\n\t\t<p>Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t<p><span>San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>October 27-29, 2025</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\t\t\t<div>\n\t<p>Topics</p>\n</div>\n\t\t</div>"

That wasn’t a target we wanted to pursue.”</p>\n<p>What followed were months of rapid experiments between last December and April, with pivots around ideas in areas like fashion and sports, none of which stuck. “We tried more than 10 different ideas in the span of four or five months,” Ruber said.</p>\n<p>The pressure began to strain their own relationships with friends and partners, a familiar story for many early-stage founders. Ironically, that tension sparked the idea that would finally click.</p>\n<p>The first version was simple: a swipeable deck of questions designed to spark conversations with their partners.

The company says more than 250,000 are active each month, with a DAU/MAU ratio of around 50%, a strong signal of engagement for a consumer social app and an early sign of daily habit potential. Candle has also ranked in Apple’s App Store top 25 multiple times.</p>\n<p>Candle’s wedge is sustaining existing relationships with small, daily prompts and games rather than helping people find new ones. Users answer quick questions, compare results, share photos, and keep a “streak” that shows how consistently they’ve checked in. The mechanics are textbook mobile engagement aimed at Gen Z and young millennials.</p>\n<p>In another atypical move for a consumer social app — but one more common among newer AI-native products — monetization has come early. Candle’s monthly revenue recently crossed $150,000, implying an annual run rate above $1 million.</p>\n<p>The app runs on a freemium model: The free tier offers daily prompts, photo updates, and core games, while premium unlocks extra content and features.</p>\n<p>While growth remains a priority for the startup, monetizing early is a strong signal of product-market fit. “At the end of the day, this app helps people strengthen their connections. Most of it is free, but when users pay for extra content and features, it shows real product-market fit,” the CEO said.</p>\n<p>The months-old platform is one of the few apps in the space, alongside <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/27/paired-pulls-in-3-6m-to-encourage-more-couples-to-get-cosy-with-app-based-relationship-care/\">Paired</a> and Couple Joy, designed to make relationships more fun. These apps are tapping into a cultural undertow where post-pandemic work habits, solo meals, and endless social feeds have hollowed out day-to-day connections and <a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2024/09/loneliness-epidemic-friendship-shortage/679689/?taid=66e7daf9c846530001aa4d26&utm_campaign=the-atlantic&utm_content=true-anthem&utm_medium=social&utm_source=twitter\" target=\"_blank\">left people in the U.S. lonelier than ever</a>.</p>\n<p>For Candle, the bet is that the next wave of social at scale will be less about broadcasting to strangers and more about making it easier to show up daily for a few close people. That insight, combined with its founder and creator-led distribution engine across TikTok and Instagram, is how the team hopes to avoid the fate of many consumer social apps that surge quickly only to stall months later.</p>\n<p>Still, the big questions remain: durability and depth. Can a daily photo-and-game app sustain 12-, 24-, or 36-month retention curves? Can Candle expand from lightweight prompts into a broader suite of “connection types” without bloating the experience? Ruber and CTO Chopra say that’s the roadmap: adding more ways to earn “sparks,” the app’s point system, for a wider range of interactions, and introducing richer features that promote consistency.</p>\n<p>The seed money raised for the team’s earlier shopping app will now give Candle the resources to bring on more engineers, speed up experimentation, and scale faster. Existing backers, including Goodwater Capital, Pioneer Fund, Progression Fund, and Y Combinator, are fully behind the new direction, Ruber said.</p>\n</div>"

    "body": "<div>\n<p>Waymo’s ever-expanding robotaxi aspirations have spread to the corporate world. </p>\n<p>The Alphabet-owned self-driving vehicle unit has launched “Waymo for Business,” a new service designed for companies to set up accounts so their employees can access robotaxis in cities like Los Angeles, Phoenix, and San Francisco. </p>\n<p>Waymo announced Wednesday in a <a href=\"https://waymo.com/blog/2025/09/waymo-for-business\" target=\"_blank\">blog post</a> it is inviting organizations to sign up for Waymo for Business. The new service will let businesses subsidize their employees’ rides or purchase promo codes in bulk, which can be handed out to clients, customers, or workers. The Waymo for Business rides will cost the same as its regular service.</p>\n<p>One of Waymo’s first customers is Carvana, the Phoenix-based online used car marketplace. </p>\n<p>While riders already use Waymo’s robotaxis to commute to work, this is the company’s first coordinated commercial effort to target corporations and other organizations. Waymo has said nearly one in six of its local riders in San Francisco, Los Angeles, and Phoenix rely on Waymo to commute to work or school.</p>\n<p>Today, users open the Waymo app (or in some cities like Austin, the Uber app) to hail a ride. That process won’t change for employees whose companies have signed up for Waymo for Business. What does change is the control companies can exert over the service.</p>\n<p>Through the Waymo for Business service, companies have access to a business portal that gives the organizations control over their ride programs. Corporate customers can dictate the geographic area in which their employees use the robotaxis, set pickup and drop-off locations, monitor ride activity, and track their budget.</p>\n<div>\n\t\t<p>Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t<p><span>San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>October 27-29, 2025</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n<div><p>Waymo said it plans to bring its new business service to other cities like Washington, DC and Miami, once it has launched commercial operations in those markets. </p><p>Waymo has ramped up operations over the past 18 months making it the dominant robotaxi service provider in the United States. The company has expanded its commercial service from Phoenix to Los Angeles, San Francisco, Austin, and Atlanta.

With the release of the MCP Server, this data is now accessible via natural language, allowing developers to integrate it into AI agents or applications.</p>\n<p>AI systems are often trained on noisy, unverified web data. Combined with their <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/09/07/are-bad-incentives-to-blame-for-ai-hallucinations/\" target=\"_blank\">tendency to “fill in the blanks”</a> when sources are lacking, this <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/08/14/study-suggests-that-even-the-best-ai-models-hallucinate-a-bunch/\" target=\"_blank\">leads to hallucinations</a>. As a result, companies looking to fine-tune AI systems for specific use cases often need access to large, high-quality datasets. By publicly releasing the MCP Server for its Data Commons, Google aims to tackle both challenges.</p>\n<p>Data Commons’ new MCP server bridges public datasets — from census figures to climate statistics — with AI systems that increasingly depend on accurate, structured context. By making this data accessible via natural language prompts, the release aims to ground AI in verifiable, real-world information.</p>\n<p>“The Model Context Protocol is letting us use the intelligence of the large language model to pick the right data at the right time, without having to understand how we model the data, how our API works,” said Google Data Commons head Prem Ramaswami in an interview.</p>\n<figure><img src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/google-data-commons-mcp-server-gemini.jpg\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/google-data-commons-mcp-server-gemini.jpg 1920w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/google-data-commons-mcp-server-gemini.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/google-data-commons-mcp-server-gemini.jpg?resize=300,201 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/google-data-commons-mcp-server-gemini.jpg?resize=768,514 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/google-data-commons-mcp-server-gemini.jpg?resize=680,455 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/google-data-commons-mcp-server-gemini.jpg?resize=1200,803 1200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/google-data-commons-mcp-server-gemini.jpg?resize=1280,857 1280w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/google-data-commons-mcp-server-gemini.jpg?resize=430,288 430w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/google-data-commons-mcp-server-gemini.jpg?resize=720,482 720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/google-data-commons-mcp-server-gemini.jpg?resize=900,602 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/google-data-commons-mcp-server-gemini.jpg?resize=800,535 800w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/google-data-commons-mcp-server-gemini.jpg?resize=1536,1028 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/google-data-commons-mcp-server-gemini.jpg?resize=668,447 668w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/google-data-commons-mcp-server-gemini.jpg?resize=560,375 560w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/google-data-commons-mcp-server-gemini.jpg?resize=922,617 922w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/google-data-commons-mcp-server-gemini.jpg?resize=708,474 708w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/google-data-commons-mcp-server-gemini.jpg?resize=50,33 50w\" /><figcaption><span>A Sample of Google Data Commons MCP Server connecting AI with real-world Data</span><span><strong>Image Credits:</strong>Google</span></figcaption></figure>\n<p>First <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/11/25/anthropic-proposes-a-way-to-connect-data-to-ai-chatbots/\" target=\"_blank\">introduced by Anthropic last November</a>, MCP is an open industry standard that enables AI systems to access data from various sources, including business tools, content repositories, and app development environments, providing a common framework for understanding contextual prompts.

Jim Jordan (R-OH) on Tuesday.</p>\n<p>“Reflecting the Company’s commitment to free expression, YouTube will provide an opportunity for all creators to rejoin the platform if the Company terminated their channels for repeated violations of COVID-19 and elections integrity policies that are no longer in effect,” Alphabet’s legal counsel Daniel F. Donovan wrote. “YouTube values conservative voices on its platform and recognizes that these creators have extensive reach and play an important role in civic discourse.”</p>\n<p>This letter was a response to a <a href=\"https://judiciary.house.gov/sites/evo-subsites/republicans-judiciary.house.gov/files/evo-media-document/2025-03-06-jdj-to-pichai-alphabet-re-subpoena.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">subpoena</a> from Rep. Jordan, who sought to investigate if the Biden-Harris administration had “coerced or colluded” with companies like Alphabet to censor speech.</p>\n<p>At the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, many social platforms like YouTube, Facebook, and Twitter enacted policies to ban the spread of medical misinformation about the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/25/youtube-has-removed-1-million-videos-for-dangerous-covid-19-misinformation/\">virus</a> and <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/29/youtube-will-now-ban-content-with-vaccine-misinformation/\">vaccines</a>. For example, YouTube disallowed content saying that vaccines can cause cancer, a false claim which is <a href=\"https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/coronavirus/in-depth/coronavirus-myths/art-20485720\" target=\"_blank\">not supported</a> by <a href=\"https://www.cancer.gov/about-cancer/coronavirus/covid-19-vaccines-people-with-cancer\" target=\"_blank\">scientific research</a>.</p>\n<p>Later, platforms also took action against content falsely claiming that the 2020 U.S. presidential election was “stolen” from Donald Trump. Twitter, not yet bought and rebranded by Elon Musk, said that it suspended <a href=\"https://blog.x.com/en_us/topics/company/2021/protecting--the-conversation-following-the-riots-in-washington--\" target=\"_blank\">70,000 accounts</a> for sharing QAnon conspiracy content and inciting violence in the week after the January 6 riots.</p>\n<p>But leading up to the presidential election in 2024, online platforms began loosening their policies around misinformation. On YouTube, this included reinstating president Donald Trump, whose account had been <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-64993603\" target=\"_blank\">banned</a> after the January 6 attack for breaking rules around inciting violence. The platform also reinstated <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c0mzk2y41zvo\" target=\"_blank\">Robert F. Kennedy, Jr.</a>, who became the U.S. Secretary of Health and Human Services.</p>\n<p>Now, according to the company’s letter to Rep.

But the company doesn’t say how AI partners or others it sells to could use that data. Voice data could be used to make fake calls that sound like they’re coming from you, or AI companies could use your voice to make their own AI voices.</p>\n<p>“Once your voice is over there, it can be used for fraud,” says Jackson. “Now, this company has your phone number and essentially enough information — they have recordings of your voice, which could be used to create an impersonation of you and do all sorts of fraud.”</p>\n<p>Even if the company itself is trustworthy, Neon doesn’t disclose who its trusted partners are or what those entities are allowed to do with users’ data further down the road. Neon is also subject to potential data breaches, as any company with valuable data may be.</p>\n<figure><img src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Screenshot-2025-09-24-at-3.26.32PM.jpg\" alt=\"Neon mobile website screenshot showing founder \"Alex\"\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Screenshot-2025-09-24-at-3.26.32PM.jpg 3006w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Screenshot-2025-09-24-at-3.26.32PM.jpg?resize=150,57 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Screenshot-2025-09-24-at-3.26.32PM.jpg?resize=300,114 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Screenshot-2025-09-24-at-3.26.32PM.jpg?resize=768,291 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Screenshot-2025-09-24-at-3.26.32PM.jpg?resize=680,258 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Screenshot-2025-09-24-at-3.26.32PM.jpg?resize=1200,455 1200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Screenshot-2025-09-24-at-3.26.32PM.jpg?resize=1280,485 1280w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Screenshot-2025-09-24-at-3.26.32PM.jpg?resize=430,163 430w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Screenshot-2025-09-24-at-3.26.32PM.jpg?resize=720,273 720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Screenshot-2025-09-24-at-3.26.32PM.jpg?resize=900,341 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Screenshot-2025-09-24-at-3.26.32PM.jpg?resize=800,303 800w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Screenshot-2025-09-24-at-3.26.32PM.jpg?resize=1536,583 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Screenshot-2025-09-24-at-3.26.32PM.jpg?resize=2048,777 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Screenshot-2025-09-24-at-3.26.32PM.jpg?resize=668,253 668w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Screenshot-2025-09-24-at-3.26.32PM.jpg?resize=1440,546 1440w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Screenshot-2025-09-24-at-3.26.32PM.jpg?resize=708,269 708w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Screenshot-2025-09-24-at-3.26.32PM.jpg?resize=50,19 50w\" /><figcaption><span><strong>Image Credits:</strong>Neon Mobile</span></figcaption></figure>\n<p>In a brief test by TechCrunch, Neon did not offer any indication that it was recording the user’s call, nor did it warn the call recipient.
