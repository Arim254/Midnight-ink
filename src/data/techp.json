DeepSeek announced the model with <a href=\"https://huggingface.co/deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-V3.2-Exp\" target=\"_blank\">a post on Hugging Face</a>, also posting <a href=\"https://github.com/deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-V3.2-Exp/blob/main/DeepSeek_V3_2.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">a linked academic paper</a> on GitHub.</p>\n<p>The most important feature of the new model is called DeepSeek Sparse Attention, an intricate system described in detail in the diagram below. In essence, the system uses a module called a “lightning indexer” to prioritize specific excerpts from the context window. After that, a separate system called a “fine-grained token selection system” chooses specific tokens from within those excerpts to load into the module’s limited attention window. Taken together, they allow the Sparse Attention models to operate over long portions of context with comparatively small server loads.</p>\n<figure><img src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Screen-Shot-2025-09-29-at-3.35.45-PM.jpg?w=680\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Screen-Shot-2025-09-29-at-3.35.45-PM.jpg 1312w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Screen-Shot-2025-09-29-at-3.35.45-PM.jpg?resize=150,88 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Screen-Shot-2025-09-29-at-3.35.45-PM.jpg?resize=300,175 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Screen-Shot-2025-09-29-at-3.35.45-PM.jpg?resize=768,448 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Screen-Shot-2025-09-29-at-3.35.45-PM.jpg?resize=680,397 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Screen-Shot-2025-09-29-at-3.35.45-PM.jpg?resize=1200,701 1200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Screen-Shot-2025-09-29-at-3.35.45-PM.jpg?resize=1280,747 1280w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Screen-Shot-2025-09-29-at-3.35.45-PM.jpg?resize=430,251 430w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Screen-Shot-2025-09-29-at-3.35.45-PM.jpg?resize=720,420 720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Screen-Shot-2025-09-29-at-3.35.45-PM.jpg?resize=900,525 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Screen-Shot-2025-09-29-at-3.35.45-PM.jpg?resize=800,467 800w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Screen-Shot-2025-09-29-at-3.35.45-PM.jpg?resize=668,390 668w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Screen-Shot-2025-09-29-at-3.35.45-PM.jpg?resize=642,375 642w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Screen-Shot-2025-09-29-at-3.35.45-PM.jpg?resize=1057,617 1057w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Screen-Shot-2025-09-29-at-3.35.45-PM.jpg?resize=708,413 708w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Screen-Shot-2025-09-29-at-3.35.45-PM.jpg?resize=50,29 50w\" /><figcaption><span>Screenshot</span></figcaption></figure>\n<p>For long-context operations, the benefits of the system are significant. Preliminary testing by DeepSeek found that the price of a simple API call could be reduced by as much as half in long-context situations. Further testing will be required to build a more robust assessment, but because the model is open-weight and freely available on Hugging Face, it won’t be long before third-party tests can assess the claims made in the paper.</p>\n<p>DeepSeek’s new model is one of a string of recent breakthroughs tackling the problem of inference costs — essentially, the server costs of operating a pre-trained AI model, as distinct from the cost of training it. In DeepSeek’s case, the researchers were looking for ways to make the fundamental transformer architecture operate more efficiently — and finding that there are significant improvements to be made.</p>\n<p>Based in China, DeepSeek has been an unusual figure in the AI boom, particularly for those who view AI research as a nationalist struggle between the U.S. and China. The company made waves <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/01/30/how-deepseek-changed-silicon-valleys-ai-landscape/\">at the beginning of the year</a> with its R1 model, trained using primarily reinforcement learning at a far lower cost than its American competitors. But the model has not sparked a wholesale revolution in AI training, as some predicted, and the company has receded from the spotlight in the months since.</p>\n<p>The new “sparse attention” approach is unlikely to produce the same uproar as R1 — but it could still teach U.S. providers some much needed tricks to help keep inference costs low.</p>\n</div>\n\t\t\t<div>\n\t<p>Topics</p>\n</div>\n<div>\n<div>\n\t<p>\n\t\tRussell Brandom has been covering the tech industry since 2012, with a focus on platform policy and emerging technologies.

The social media giant <a href=\"https://newsroom.snap.com/snap-memory-storage\" target=\"_blank\">announced</a> that free access to the feature will be limited to 5GB. If your memories exceed this limit, you’ll need to subscribe to one of its new Memories Storage plans.</p>\n<p>The company told TechCrunch in an email that the introductory storage plan offers up to 100GB of storage for $1.99 per month. Snapchat+ users will get up to 250GB of storage as part of their $3.99 monthly subscription, while Snapchat Platinum users will get 5TB as part of their $15.99 monthly subscription. </p>\n<p>Snapchat explains that when it first launched Memories, it didn’t expect it to grow to what it has today, as users have saved more than 1 trillion Memories on the platform.</p>\n<p>“It’s never easy to transition from receiving a service for free to paying for it, but we hope the value we provide with Memories is worth the cost,” Snapchat wrote in a <a href=\"https://newsroom.snap.com/snap-memory-storage\" target=\"_blank\">blog post</a>. “These changes will allow us to continue to invest in making Memories better for our entire community.”</p>\n<p>Snapchat will provide 12 months of temporary Memories storage for any Memories that exceed the 5GB storage limit. The company notes that users can download Memories directly to their devices. If you’re over the limit, but don’t sign up for a plan, your oldest Snaps will be saved, while the most recent ones that are over the storage limit will be deleted. </p>\n<p>Snapchat says the change won’t affect most users, as the vast majority have under 5GB of Memories. It will mainly impact those with “thousands of Snaps,” the company notes. </p>\n<p>Snapchat’s decision to introduce paid storage for Memories allows it to address growing infrastructure costs and monetize users with high storage needs while keeping free access for most users.</p>\n<div>\n\t\t<p>Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t<p><span>San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>October 27-29, 2025</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\t\t\t<div>\n\t<p>Topics</p>\n</div>\n<div>\n<div>\n\t\t<p>Aisha is a consumer news reporter at TechCrunch.

    "body": "<div>\n<p>Job seekers in all fields can expect to soon be doing a lot more initial screening interviews. While that may sound like positive news, it doesn’t mean that there will suddenly be more open positions.</p>\n<p>Instead, recruiters, often bogged down with determining which applicants are qualified for the next round, will outsource the routine screening tasks — like checking backgrounds, salary needs, and availability — to (you guessed it) AI.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.alex.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Alex</a>, a startup building an AI recruiter, says it’s already helping companies conduct video interviews and phone screens.</p>\n<p>Aaron Wang (pictured center, bottom row), who co-founded Alex about 18 months ago, told TechCrunch that the startup’s voice AI tool can conduct autonomous interviews with applicants soon after they apply for a job. “Our AI recruiter does thousands of interviews a day and helps people get hired at some of the biggest companies in the world,” he said.</p>\n<p>Although Wang, who previously worked at Facebook and spent time as a quant for a hedge fund, declined to name customers, he said they include Fortune 100 companies, financial institutions, nationwide restaurant chains, and Big 4 accounting firms.</p>\n<p>Investors view the rise of AI interviewers as a trend that many companies will inevitably adopt. That conviction led to Alex’s new $17 million Series A round, which was led by Peak XV Partners. The round included participation from Y Combinator and Uncorrelated Ventures, along with several chief human resources officers (CHROs) from unnamed Fortune 500 companies, and others. This Series A follows the company’s $3 million seed funding, which was led by 1984 Ventures last year.</p>\n<p>Alex isn’t alone in offering AI recruiting services to companies.

    "body": "<div>\n<p>The social network Bluesky will begin verifying users’ ages in the state of Ohio to comply with new regulations, starting on Monday, September 29. The company — which offers an open and decentralized competitor to X and Threads — says it will enable the <a href=\"https://www.kidswebservices.com/en-US/services/age-verification\" target=\"_blank\">Kids Web Services’ (KWS)</a> age verification solution in the state. This is the same solution that Bluesky is <a href=\"https://bsky.social/about/blog/09-10-2025-age-assurance-approach\" target=\"_blank\">already using in South Dakota and Wyoming</a> to comply with similar laws.</p>\n<p>Bluesky announced the move in Ohio on Sunday via its <a href=\"https://bsky.app/profile/did:plc:eon2iu7v3x2ukgxkqaf7e5np/post/3lzvqklye622a\" target=\"_blank\">Bluesky Safety account,</a> and in an update to <a href=\"https://bsky.social/about/blog/09-10-2025-age-assurance-approach\" target=\"_blank\">last month’s blog post</a> about the matter.</p>\n<p>The changes come as a number of U.S. states are rolling out their own age verification laws to protect children from online risks, given the lack of federal guidance. The Ohio law, meant to protect kids from pornography, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.nbc4i.com/news/local-news/central-ohio-news/how-incoming-age-verification-law-for-adult-content-may-affect-ohio-residents/\">will require users in O</a><a href=\"https://www.nbc4i.com/news/local-news/central-ohio-news/how-incoming-age-verification-law-for-adult-content-may-affect-ohio-residents/\" target=\"_blank\">h</a><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.nbc4i.com/news/local-news/central-ohio-news/how-incoming-age-verification-law-for-adult-content-may-affect-ohio-residents/\">io</a> to upload a copy of their government-issued photo ID or other personal identification before accessing adult content. This includes the type of adult content that can be found on social networks.</p>\n<p>KWS will provide the technical infrastructure that allows Bluesky to verify users’ ages by offering multiple ways for them to do so beyond only uploading a government-issued identity document. According to its website, KWS also lets users verify by facial scans, payment cards, and more. </p>\n<p>Unfortunately for U.S. users, these age assurance laws aren’t all written the same. </p>\n<p>One law that rolled out in Mississippi, which used poorly written and overly broad language, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/08/24/bluesky-blocks-service-in-mississippi-over-age-assurance-law/\">led Bluesky to suspend services in the state.</a> The startup explained at the time that, as a small team, they didn’t have the resources to make the substantial technical changes needed to comply. This left the state open to larger competitors, like Meta, which continues to dominate the social networking market. </p>\n<p>These legal requirements could ultimately hurt smaller startups like Bluesky, which are still working to gain traction under tech giant Meta’s shadow. Having to verify their age may deter potential new users and divert the team’s attention from other areas where it could innovate, like features, protocols, and other underlying technology. </p>\n<p>The addition of an age verification for users in Ohio comes shortly after some Bluesky users began pushing back against updates to the company’s moderation services and terms. Bluesky recently committed to <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/09/22/bluesky-says-its-getting-more-aggressive-about-moderation-and-enforcement/\">more aggressively punishing those who violate </a>the site’s guidelines, including rules against harassment and toxic content.</p>\n</div><div>\n<div><p>\n\t\tSarah has worked as a reporter for TechCrunch since August 2011.

    "body": "<div>\n<p>On Monday, Anthropic launched a new frontier model called <a href=\"https://www.anthropic.com/news/claude-sonnet-4-5\" target=\"_blank\">Claude Sonnet 4.5</a>, which it claims offers state-of-the-art performance on coding benchmarks. The company says Claude Sonnet 4.5 is capable of building “production-ready” applications, rather than just prototypes, representing a leap in reliability from previous AI models.</p>\n<p>Claude Sonnet 4.5 will be available via the Claude API and in the Claude chatbot. The pricing for developers is the same as Claude Sonnet 4: $3 per million input tokens (roughly 750,000 words, or more than the entire “Lord of the Rings” series) and $15 per million output tokens.</p>\n<p>In the last year, Anthropic’s AI models have emerged as a <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/07/31/enterprises-prefer-anthropics-ai-models-over-anyone-elses-including-openais/\">favorite among developers and enterprises</a>, in large part due to their strong performance on software engineering tasks. Apple and Meta reportedly use Claude AI models internally, and Anthropic has made a significant business selling API access to AI coding applications such as Cursor, Windsurf, and Replit. Recently, OpenAI’s <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/08/07/openais-gpt-5-is-here/\">GPT-5</a> has challenged Anthropic’s dominance in the space, outperforming Claude models on a variety of coding benchmarks.</p>\n<p>Anthropic says Claude Sonnet 4.5 offers industry-leading performance on several coding benchmarks, including <a href=\"https://www.swebench.com/\" target=\"_blank\">SWE-Bench Verified</a>. However, Anthropic AI researcher David Hershey tells TechCrunch that it is hard to capture Claude Sonnet 4.5’s performance on benchmarks alone.</p>\n<figure><img src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Screenshot-2025-09-29-at-10.08.34AM.png?w=680\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Screenshot-2025-09-29-at-10.08.34AM.png 1916w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Screenshot-2025-09-29-at-10.08.34AM.png?resize=150,85 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Screenshot-2025-09-29-at-10.08.34AM.png?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Screenshot-2025-09-29-at-10.08.34AM.png?resize=768,434 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Screenshot-2025-09-29-at-10.08.34AM.png?resize=680,384 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Screenshot-2025-09-29-at-10.08.34AM.png?resize=1200,678 1200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Screenshot-2025-09-29-at-10.08.34AM.png?resize=1280,723 1280w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Screenshot-2025-09-29-at-10.08.34AM.png?resize=430,243 430w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Screenshot-2025-09-29-at-10.08.34AM.png?resize=720,407 720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Screenshot-2025-09-29-at-10.08.34AM.png?resize=900,508 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Screenshot-2025-09-29-at-10.08.34AM.png?resize=800,452 800w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Screenshot-2025-09-29-at-10.08.34AM.png?resize=1536,867 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Screenshot-2025-09-29-at-10.08.34AM.png?resize=668,377 668w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Screenshot-2025-09-29-at-10.08.34AM.png?resize=664,375 664w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Screenshot-2025-09-29-at-10.08.34AM.png?resize=1093,617 1093w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Screenshot-2025-09-29-at-10.08.34AM.png?resize=708,400 708w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Screenshot-2025-09-29-at-10.08.34AM.png?resize=50,28 50w\" /><figcaption><span><strong>Image Credits:</strong>Anthropic</span></figcaption></figure>\n<p>Hershey says he’s seen Claude Sonnet 4.5 code autonomously for up to 30 hours during early trials with some enterprise customers. In that time, he watched the AI model not only build an application, but also stand up database services, purchase domain names, and perform a SOC 2 audit to make sure the product was secure.</p>\n<p>In a statement shared with TechCrunch, Cursor CEO Michael Truell said Claude Sonnet 4.5 represents state-of-the-art coding performance, specifically on longer horizon tasks. Windsurf CEO Jeff Wang said in a statement that Claude Sonnet 4.5 represents a “new generation of coding models.”</p>\n<p>Anthropic also claims that Claude Sonnet 4.5 is its most aligned frontier AI model yet, with lower rates of sycophancy and deception than previous models.

It also ensures whistleblower protections for employees at those companies.  </p>\n<p>In addition, SB 53 creates a mechanism for AI companies and the public to report potential critical safety incidents to California’s Office of Emergency Services. Companies also have to report incidents related to crimes committed without human oversight, such as cyberattacks, and deceptive behavior by a model that isn’t required under the EU AI Act.  </p>\n<p>The bill has received mixed reactions from the AI industry. Tech firms have broadly argued that state-level AI policy risks creating a “patchwork of regulation” that would hinder innovation, although <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/09/08/anthropic-endorses-californias-ai-safety-bill-sb-53/\" target=\"_blank\">Anthropic endorsed the bill</a>. Meta and OpenAI lobbied against it. OpenAI even wrote and published an open letter to Gov. Newsom that discouraged his signing of SB 53.</p>\n<p>The new bill comes as some of <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/08/25/silicon-valley-is-pouring-millions-into-pro-ai-pacs-to-sway-midterms/\">Silicon Valley’s tech elite</a> have poured hundreds of millions into super PACs to back candidates that support a light-touch approach to AI regulation. Leaders at OpenAI and <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/09/23/meta-launches-super-pac-to-fight-ai-regulation-as-state-policies-mount/\" target=\"_blank\">Meta</a> have in recent weeks launched pro-AI super PACs that aim to <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/08/26/meta-to-spend-tens-of-millions-on-pro-ai-super-pac/\" target=\"_blank\">back candidates</a> and bills that are friendly to AI. </p>\n<p>Still, other states might look to California for inspiration as they attempt to curb the potential harms caused by the unmitigated advancement of such a powerful emerging technology. In New York, a similar bill was passed by state lawmakers and is awaiting Gov. Kathy Hochul’s signature or veto.  </p>\n<p>“California has proven that we can establish regulations to protect our communities while also ensuring that the growing AI industry continues to thrive,” Newsom said in a statement. “This legislation strikes that balance. AI is the new frontier in innovation, and California is not only here for it — but stands strong as a national leader by enacting the first-in-the-nation frontier AI safety legislation that builds public trust as this emerging technology rapidly evolves.” </p>\n<div>\n\t\t<p>Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t<p><span>San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>October 27-29, 2025</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n<p>The governor is also weighing another bill — <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/09/11/a-california-bill-that-would-regulate-ai-companion-chatbots-is-close-to-becoming-law/\" target=\"_blank\">SB 243</a> — that passed both the State Assembly and Senate with bipartisan support this month.

    "body": "<div>\n<p>A Faraday Future electric SUV caught fire at the startup’s Los Angeles headquarters early Sunday morning, leading to an explosion that blew out part of a wall, the fire department told TechCrunch. </p>\n<p>The fire was extinguished in 40 minutes, and no injuries were reported. Damage to the building — a smaller two-story structure next to the larger portion of the headquarters (pictured above) — was severe enough that the city’s Department of Building and Safety has “red tagged” it, meaning it may need structural work before it can be occupied again.</p>\n<p>“We are aware of a fire at our facility yesterday, there were no injuries to FF staff, and no evacuation was required, and the specific cause and origin of the fire is under investigation,” John Schilling, Faraday Future’s communications director, wrote in an email to TechCrunch. </p>\n<p>The fire comes at an awkward time for Faraday Future because its continued presence at the headquarters — which it has occupied for a decade — is uncertain. </p>\n<p>The startup, which has struggled financially for years, <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/20/18269081/faraday-future-sold-headquarters-la-leasing-ev-electric-car\" target=\"_blank\">sold the headquarters in 2019 to generate cash</a> and has leased it ever since. Current owner Rexford Industrial sued Faraday Future in February 2024 in an attempt to <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/02/16/faraday-future-headquarters-rent/\">evict the startup over late payments</a>. The two sides ultimately <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/04/03/faraday-future-avoids-eviction-at-its-la-headquarters-for-now/\">settled in April 2024</a>. At the time of that settlement, the lease was set to expire at the end of September 2025. </p>\n<p>Schilling, when asked, said he was unsure of the current status of Faraday Future’s lease. The property, including the main building and the one where the fire occurred, is <a href=\"https://www.cbre.com/properties/properties-for-lease/industrial/details/US-SMPL-175591/18455-s-figueroa-st-501-w-190th-st-18455-south-figueroa-street-gardena-ca-90248\" target=\"_blank\">being advertised as available for lease by commercial real estate company CBRE</a>. Representatives for CBRE and Rexford did not immediately respond to requests for comment.</p>\n<p>The blaze was first reported to the Los Angeles Fire Department (LAFD) at 4:37 a.m. local time on September 28. LAFD spokesperson Brian Humphrey told TechCrunch the 911 call came from an eyewitness. Sprinklers in the building helped keep the fire in check until the fire department arrived. An explosion created a major bulge in at least one of the walls, according to a photo viewed by TechCrunch.</p>\n<div>\n\t\t<p>Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t<p><span>San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>October 27-29, 2025</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n<p>Once they arrived, firefighters had to force entry to battle the flames, Humphrey said. The fire was fully extinguished at 5:17 a.m.   </p>\n<p>The specific cause and origin of the FF91 SUV fire have not yet been determined, Humphrey said, noting that fire department investigators did not identify any “human factors.” The FF91 SUV was on display in the office space.</p>\n<p>After the fire was extinguished, an inspector from the Los Angeles Department of Building and Safety evaluated the structure and determined it unfit for occupancy.</p>\n<p>Faraday Future first unveiled the FF91 SUV in 2017. At the time, it was billed as an ultra-luxury electric vehicle with industry-leading range. But the company ran into repeated financial crises, and only started building the <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-03-30/faraday-future-starts-production-of-long-delayed-electric-suvs\" target=\"_blank\">first few production SUVs in 2023</a>. </p>\n<p>Since then, the company has delivered a few more than a dozen FF91s to celebrities and high net worth individuals, although Faraday Future has been accused by employee whistleblowers of <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/04/09/faraday-lawsuit-fake-sales-whistleblowers-retaliation/\" target=\"_blank\">misrepresenting those sales</a>. </p>\n<p>The company is now promoting a more affordable electric van that it appears to be importing from China, and is also trying to spin up a <a href=\"https://app-us.ff.com/ff-v3/news/1273?lang=en-US\" target=\"_blank\">crypto-focused business</a>. Earlier this year, the Securities and Exchange Commission sent <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/07/16/faraday-future-faces-potential-sec-enforcement-action-after-three-year-probe/\" target=\"_blank\">so-called “Wells Notices” to Faraday Future and its founder Jia Yueting</a>, among others, an indication that the financial regulator is preparing to file a lawsuit against the company following a three-year investigation.</p>\n</div><div>\n<div>\n\t\t<p>Sean O’Kane is a reporter who has spent a decade covering the rapidly-evolving business and technology of the transportation industry, including Tesla and the many startups chasing Elon Musk.

In particular, the GPT-5 models were trained with <a href=\"https://openai.com/index/gpt-5-safe-completions/\" target=\"_blank\">a new safety feature that OpenAI calls “safe completions,”</a> which allows them to answer sensitive questions in a safe way, rather than simply refusing to engage.</p>\n<p>It’s a contrast from the company’s previous chat models, which are designed to be agreeable and answer questions quickly. GPT-4o has come under particular scrutiny because of its overly sycophantic, agreeable nature, which has both fueled incidents of AI-induced delusions and drawn a large base of devoted users. When OpenAI rolled out <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/08/07/openais-gpt-5-is-here/\" target=\"_blank\">GPT-5 as the default in August</a>, many users pushed back and demanded access to GPT-4o. </p>\n<p>While many experts and users have welcomed the safety features, others have criticized what they see as an overly cautious implementation, with some users accusing OpenAI of treating adults like children in a way that degrades the quality of the service. OpenAI has suggested that getting it right will take time and has given itself a 120-day period of iteration and improvement.  </p>\n<p>Nick Turley, VP and head of the ChatGPT app, acknowledged some of the “strong reactions to 4o responses” due to the implementation of the router with explanations.  </p>\n<p>“Routing happens on a per-message basis; switching from the default model happens on a temporary basis,” <a href=\"https://x.com/nickaturley/status/1972031686318895253?s=46&t=45_xAnRsdQP1GVqYv9Gdbw\" target=\"_blank\">Turley posted on X</a>. “ChatGPT will tell you which model is active when asked. This is part of a broader effort to strengthen safeguards and learn from real-world use before a wider rollout.” </p>\n<div>\n\t\t<p>Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t<p><span>San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>October 27-29, 2025</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n<p>The implementation of parental controls in ChatGPT received <a href=\"https://x.com/fidjissimo/status/1972602249907146967?s=46\" target=\"_blank\">similar levels of praise and scorn</a>, with some commending giving parents a way to keep tabs on their children’s AI use, and others fearful that it opens the door to OpenAI treating adults like children.</p>\n<p>The controls let parents customize their teen’s experience by setting quiet hours, turning off voice mode and memory, removing image generation, and opting out of model training. Teen accounts will also get <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/09/16/openai-will-apply-new-restrictions-to-chatgpt-users-under-18/\" target=\"_blank\">additional content protections</a> — like reduced graphic content and extreme beauty ideals — and a detection system that recognizes potential signs that a teen might be thinking about self-harm.  </p>\n<p>“If our systems detect potential harm, a small team of specially trained people reviews the situation,” per OpenAI’s <a href=\"https://openai.com/index/introducing-parental-controls/\" target=\"_blank\">blog</a>. “If there are signs of acute distress, we will contact parents by email, text message and push alert on their phone, unless they have opted out.” </p>\n<p>OpenAI acknowledged that the system won’t be perfect and may sometimes raise alarms when there isn’t real danger, “but we think it’s better to act and alert a parent so they can step in than to stay silent.” The AI firm said it is also working on ways to reach law enforcement or emergency services if it detects an imminent threat to life and cannot reach a parent. </p>\n</div><div>\n<div>\n\t\t<p>Rebecca Bellan is a senior reporter at TechCrunch where she covers the business, policy, and emerging trends shaping artificial intelligence.

    "body": "<div>\n<p>ChatGPT users in the U.S. can now make Etsy and Shopify purchases within conversations, marking a next step toward the future of online shopping — both for consumers and the platforms that control product discovery, recommendation, and payments. In other words, OpenAI might be on the path to reshaping who holds power in e-commerce. </p>\n<p>OpenAI’s new “Instant Checkout” feature is available to ChatGPT Pro, Plus, and Free logged-in users buying from U.S.-based Etsy sellers, with more than 1 million Shopify merchants like Glossier, Skims, Spanx, and Vuori “coming soon,” <a href=\"https://openai.com/index/buy-it-in-chatgpt/\" target=\"_blank\">per OpenAI</a>.  </p>\n<p>Instant Checkout builds on previous <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/04/28/openai-upgrades-chatgpt-search-with-shopping-features/?utm_source=chatgpt.com\" target=\"_blank\">shopping features on ChatGPT</a> that surfaced relevant products, images, reviews, prices, and direct links to merchants in response to shopping questions like “what should I get my friend who loves ceramics?” or “best sneakers to wear to the office.” Now, instead of having to leave the conversation, users can just tap “Buy” to confirm their order, shipping, and payment details (options include Apple Pay, Google Pay, Stripe, or credit card) to complete the purchase.  </p>\n<p>Last year, <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/11/18/perplexity-introduces-a-shopping-feature-for-pro-users/?utm_source=chatgpt.com\" target=\"_blank\">Perplexity introduced</a> a similar in-chat shopping and payments feature. Microsoft also offers merchants the ability to create in-chat storefront capabilities with the Copilot Merchant Program. </p>\n<p>This type of frictionless experience has the potential to spark a new movement in how people shop online — one that moves away from search engines like Google and e-commerce platforms like Amazon toward conversational agents with curated recommendations, comparisons, and easy checkout experiences. </p>\n<p>It’s also setting the stage for new power brokers to emerge in e-commerce. Google and Amazon have long been the gatekeepers for retail discovery. If more purchases start inside AI chatbots, the firms behind them will suddenly have more control over what products are surfaced and what commissions or fees they charge.  </p>\n<p>Both <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/06/27/amazon-hit-with-fresh-class-action-style-suit-in-uk-3-4bn-in-competition-damages-sought-for-200000-sellers/\" target=\"_blank\">Amazon</a> and <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2022/02/07/google-shopping-lawsuit/\" target=\"_blank\">Google</a> have previously leveraged their dominance to favor their own products or preferred partners, pushing down competitors in search results or charging steep fees to sellers simply to maintain visibility. OpenAI said in a blog post that the product results it surfaces are “organic and unsponsored, ranked purely on relevance to the user,” and that it will charge merchants a “small fee” for completed purchases.  </p>\n<div>\n\t\t<p>Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t<p><span>San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>October 27-29, 2025</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n<p>TechCrunch has reached out to OpenAI for more information. </p>\n<p>Along with OpenAI’s introduction of in-chat checkout, the AI firm also noted that it will open source its Agentic Commerce Protocol (ACP), the tech that powers Instant Checkout built with Stripe, so that other merchants and developers can integrate agentic checkout. </p>\n<p>“Stripe is building the economic infrastructure for AI,” Will Gaybrick, president of technology and business at Stripe, said in a statement. “That means re-architecting today’s commerce systems and creating new AI-powered experiences for billions of people.” </p>\n<p>While some may balk at handing ChatGPT private payment information, the company says orders, payments, and fulfillment are handled by the merchant using their existing systems. ChatGPT merely acts as an agent, an intermediary that can securely pass along information between user and merchant.  </p>\n<p>Open sourcing ACP makes it easier for merchants to integrate with ChatGPT, widening the adoption of AI chatbots that function as a virtual storefront. It also expands OpenAI’s potential control as a gatekeeper for retail discovery and checkout, and could position the firm to be the de facto architect of the AI commerce ecosystem.  </p>\n<p>That would put it in tension with Google yet again, as the tech giant has recently launched its own open protocol for purchases initiated by AI agents, dubbed <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/09/16/google-launches-new-protocol-for-agent-driven-purchases/\">Agent Payments Protocol (AP2)</a>.   </p>\n</div><div>\n<div>\n\t\t<p>Rebecca Bellan is a senior reporter at TechCrunch where she covers the business, policy, and emerging trends shaping artificial intelligence.

    "body": "<div>\n<p>Venture capital is filled with investors who claim they’ve got inside access to the next big thing. Meanwhile, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/gabrieljarrosson\">Gabriel </a><a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/gabrieljarrosson\" target=\"_blank\">Jarrosson</a>, a French engineer-turned-YouTuber-turned-investor, has built his VC firm around a single filter: If it isn’t a Y Combinator company, he won’t invest in it.</p>\n<p>That discipline pushed Jarrosson from filming scrappy venture explainers in Paris to managing more than $12 million in assets at <a href=\"https://www.lobstercap.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Lobster Capital</a>, with a larger second fund already in the works, according to <a href=\"https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/2066695/000206669525000001/xslFormDX01/primary_doc.xml\" target=\"_blank\">recent SEC filings</a>. His logic is simple: He believes YC’s track record of producing billion-dollar companies beats chasing startups elsewhere.</p>\n<p>In 2017, frustrated by the lack of access to promising French startups, Jarrosson launched a YouTube channel to share his investment journey in French. </p>\n<p>The channel grew a loyal following and evolved into one of Europe’s largest angel syndicates. Since 2020, it has deployed $36 million into startups, mostly YC alumni. That track record paved the way for Lobster Capital, which closed its debut fund at $12 million, surpassing its $8 million target.</p>\n<p>Jarrosson’s reasoning on backing only YC startups rests on probability. According to this <a href=\"https://www.lennysnewsletter.com/p/pulling-back-the-curtain-on-the-magic\" target=\"_blank\">report</a>, roughly 4.5% of YC companies become unicorns (in contrast to the 2.5% outcome for other venture-backed seed-stage startups),<em> </em>and around 45% of companies go on to raise a Series A<em> </em>(higher than the 33% average).<em> </em></p>\n<p>Similarly, YC has funded more than 90 unicorns, with roughly a quarter of those growing into decacorns.</p>\n<p>That’s why the premium for YC deals, where valuations often run multiples higher than non-YC peers at the seed stage, doesn’t deter Jarrosson.</p>\n<div>\n\t\t<p>Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t<p><span>San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>October 27-29, 2025</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n<p>“If you think about the VC math and the returns, these outcomes are obviously great for your portfolio. As investors, you have to ask yourself, can this company become the next unicorn?” said the founder and managing partner in an interview with TechCrunch. </p>\n<p>“If the answer is yes, it’s often okay to invest even at a slightly higher valuation. Maybe it’s a $20 million seed or $30 million, or even $40 million. Some will pass and that’s fine. But I choose to invest.”</p>\n<h3 id=\"h-riding-the-ai-wave-and-content-as-a-moat\">Riding the AI wave and content as a moat</h3>\n<p>Lobster Capital, like most early-stage investors, has ridden the surge of AI-first startups dominating recent YC batches. Jarrosson points out that three cohorts in a row have shattered revenue growth records within the accelerator, with companies reaching millions in ARR within months.</p>\n<p>There are reports that some of that ARR traction globally looks fragile, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/03/24/a16z-and-benchmark-backed-11x-has-been-claiming-customers-it-doesnt-have/\">inflated by pilots or churn-heavy annual contracts</a>. While Jarrosson admits the risk, he insists that early revenue remains the hardest hurdle, and for most of these startups, retention can be fixed.</p>\n<p>But more broadly, the biggest question around Jarrosson’s thesis is access, as YC Demo Days draw hundreds of funds chasing the same companies.</p>\n<p>Jarrosson credits his edge to reputation inside YC’s network, visibility from his content, and his own founder background. YC founders rate investors on Bookface, the accelerator’s internal platform, and Jarrosson claims strong reviews help him land allocations. </p>\n<p>Similarly, his podcast featuring YC founders and 40,000+ LinkedIn followers, where he shares his investment journey and nuggets on anything YC, also serves as ongoing marketing.</p>\n<p>“I try to do well by founders. People also hear about the firm from social media, and as a former founder, they know I can help them because many funds are built by people who have not been operators before,” said Jarrosson, who in the past launched several startups and had some exits, according to his LinkedIn profile.</p>\n<p>Jarrosson is part of a growing list of investors building funds on the back of personal brands. He cites Harry Stebbings, the 20VC podcaster who <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/10/15/20vc-closes-new-400m-fund-to-make-europe-great-again-says-harry-stebbings/\">raised a $400 million fund</a> this year, and Garry Tan, who co-founded Initialized Capital and grew it to $3 billion in AUM <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2022/08/29/garry-tan-y-combinator-q-and-a-ceo-and-president-initialized-capital/\">before becoming YC’s CEO</a>, as inspirations.</p>\n<p>Like both investors, Jarrosson treats social media, YouTube, and podcasting as community tools and deal engines. That content strategy also helps pull in limited partners who often discover him through videos or podcasts before seeing a fund deck, he adds.</p>\n<p>The managing partner has made more than 100 investments through his syndicate and Lobster Capital’s first fund, launched in 2023, which has backed nearly 30 startups in B2B SaaS, fintech infrastructure, and AI tools. </p>\n<p>He counts two unicorns and several “soonicorns” across the syndicate and the fund, including Jeeves, Baubap, FlutterFlow, Metriport, Alinea, and Jiga.</p>\n<p>“YC has the track record. It’s been around for more than 20 years now. We know it backs the best founders and creates the best founders,” Jarrosson said. “Arguably, the results of YC in the future are probably going to be even better. But even if they stay what they are, we know it’s a very good bet.”</p>\n<p>Investing solely in YC-backed companies isn’t an entirely new concept. Other VC firms, including <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2013/08/01/initialized-capital-39m/\">Initialized</a>, Pioneer Fund, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/07/03/y-combinator-alum-launched-a-new-34m-fund-dedicated-to-yc-startups-backed-by-garry-tan/\">Phosphor Capital</a>, and Rebel Fund, also started with the same strategy. <br /></p>\n</div>"

    "body": "<div>\n<p>Making democracy work isn’t easy, as recent events have made clear. Some critics would argue that technology is making it worse. But one startup is hoping that AI could help bridge some differences instead of widen them.</p>\n<p>“I had an <em>a-ha</em> moment one day when I realized people are asking AI to explain something like they’re five years old,” Tomy Lorsch, co-founder and CEO of <a href=\"https://www.complexchaos.ai/\" target=\"_blank\">ComplexChaos</a>, told TechCrunch. “What if we use it as a facilitator to help people understand each other and find common ground?”</p>\n<p>He and co-founder Maya Ben Dror are developing tools to help people arrive at a consensus. One of their first test cases involved <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/09/16/al-gore-on-chinas-climate-rise-i-would-not-have-seen-this-coming/\">climate negotiations</a>, but it really doesn’t matter what the issue is. Their goal is to foster cooperation and shorten the time it takes for groups to come to agreement.</p>\n<p>“Everyone is building software for collaboration like Slack, Google Docs, whatever,” Lorsch said. “Cooperation is a different piece.”</p>\n<p>Facilitating cooperation isn’t something that scales well, he said. Typically, trained facilitators will spend time with groups to help them arrive at a consensus, but that process can slow down when negotiations or preparations happen across time zones or even in different rooms.</p>\n<p>Lorsch was buoyed by a recent LLM developed by Google called the <a href=\"https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.adq2852\" target=\"_blank\">Habermas Machine</a>, which was developed explicitly with that goal in mind. “This is basically an AI that generates group consensus statements where people feel represented both by majority and minority point of view,” he said.</p>\n<p>Lorsch and Ben Dror recently trialed their startup’s tool to help young delegates from nine African nations prepare for climate-related negotiations at a United Nations campus in Bonn, Germany. The tool incorporates both Google’s Habermas Machine and OpenAI’s <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/09/18/chatgpt-everything-to-know-about-the-ai-chatbot/\">ChatGPT</a> to generate questions, come up with goals for conversations, and help summarize long documents.</p>\n<div>\n\t\t<p>Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t<p><span>San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>October 27-29, 2025</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n<p>The goal, Ben Dror said, is to help the delegates arrive at consensus as a bloc before they begin negotiations with others. </p>\n<p>Ideally, the tool would help speed things during negotiations, too. When blocs, or delegates from groups of aligned countries, encounter new information in the process of a large negotiating session, they often need to regroup to process the new information. “Blocs are usually the reason why negotiations have to stop. The bloc has to come out, renegotiate, reposition, and then go back in. And that creates a lot of friction,” Ben Dror said. ComplexChaos hopes that its tool can help shorten that time.</p>\n<p>In the trial with the delegates from African countries, ComplexChaos said that participants reported up to a 60% reduction in the time it took to coordinate, and that 91% of participants said that the AI tool helped them see perspectives they would have otherwise missed.</p>\n<p>ComplexChaos is also pitching its cooperation tool to companies, including tech companies and large consultancies. “Strategic planning by AI is basically the same problem,” Lorsch said. “The annual strategic planning process of most companies takes about three months of the year with back and forth negotiations, multi-layer, across time zones, across teams, and so on and so forth.”</p>\n<p>But Lorsch and Ben Dror are most enthusiastic when talking about climate negotiations. </p>\n<p>“If AI can shorten these processes, simplify them, then we’d be so much better off. Not just for climate, for anything sustainability, for any big challenge that we’re facing,” Ben Dror said.</p>\n</div><div>\n<div>\n\t\t<p>Tim De Chant is a senior climate reporter at TechCrunch.
