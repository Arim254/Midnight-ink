    "body": "<div>\n<p>The MBA-to-VC pipeline remains a very real thing. But that path is a little shakier than it once was, according to <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://pitchbook.com/news/articles/is-an-mba-still-worth-it-if-you-want-to-make-it-in-vc\">PitchBook reporting</a> and new academic research.</p>\n<p>Harvard placed 50 of its 1,004 MBA graduates into VC roles in 2024, with a median starting salary of $177,500. Stanford placed around 30 from its smaller class. More than 10,000 Harvard, Stanford, and Wharton MBA alumni currently hold senior positions at U.S. VC firms, PitchBook data shows.</p>\n<p>The MBA’s grip on venture capital is loosening, however, according to Stanford professor Ilya Strebulaev, who found that 44% of mid-career venture professionals held MBAs in the early 2000s, compared to 32% today.</p>\n<p>What’s driving the change? VC has evolved beyond traditional sectors into AI and hardware, where technical experience beats business school credentials, so firms are increasingly scanning talent from companies like <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.theinformation.com/articles/former-openai-exec-joins-spark-capital-as-venture-push-into-ai-heats-up\">OpenAI</a> and <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://foundersfund.com/team/scott-nolan/\">SpaceX</a> rather than elite MBA programs. “There is less appetite for MBAs currently,” executive recruiter Will Champagne tells PitchBook. </p>\n<p>Students haven’t gotten the memo yet; Stanford’s VC club still boasts 600 members out of the roughly 850 MBA students on campus. They’re paying a steep price, too. Nabbing an MBA at a top program can cost more than $200,000.</p>\n</div>"

    "body": "<div>\n<p>Crypto neo-bank Shield announced on Monday that it has raised a $5 million seed round led by Giant Ventures. </p>\n<p>The company launched in 2022 and pivoted to payments in 2024. It allows exporters and importers to conduct cross-border transactions in US cryptocurrencies, while also providing compliance screenings, such as addressing sanctions and money laundering threats. </p>\n<p>Emmanuel Udotong, co-founder and CEO, said he and his team started Shield because they were “disappointed by the lack of completing mainstream use cases for crypto.” Meanwhile, “bad actors” kept filling the space — and the headlines. </p>\n<p>“We wanted to help bring blockchain technology into the real economy by solving real problems,” Udotong told TechCrunch. So, he teamed up with his brother Isaiah and his college best friend, Luis Carchi, and to address how stablecoins could be used in international payments, as that was a pain point the trio faced when they last tried to build a trade business. </p>\n<p>“Today, trade businesses in regions like Latin America, Africa, and parts of Asia often wait days or weeks for international wires, pay high fees, and in many cases, can’t access US dollars at all,” Udotong continued. “Many companies face limited trade corridors, less buyer opportunities, stunted growth, and, in too many cases, failure.” </p>\n<p>That’s where Shield comes in, which Udotong said hopes to let international businesses amplify their reach — and profit — by expanding access to customers in different markets. It said it’s registered as a Money Service Business in the US and registered as a crypto exchange in the EU. </p>\n<p>Crypto has had a roaring comeback this past year, minting new unicorns and nabbing hundreds of millions of dollars, after a reputationally hard past few years. Shield said since its launch, it has processed more than $100 million in payments, $40 million of which came just from the last month. But Shield is entering a crowded field of competitors of dozens of startups, and big names like PayPal’s Xoom, and Stripe’s Bridge.</p>\n<div>\n\t\t<p>Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t<p><span>San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>October 27-29, 2025</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n<p>Shield met its lead investors, Giant Ventures, through a fellow founder. Others in the round include Chris Dixon’s a16z’s crypto startup accelerator, Factor Capital, alongside Coinbase and Bank of America as strategic angel investors. It has raised $7 million to date, the company said. </p>\n<p>The fresh capital will be used to secure more banking partnerships, as the company already has two main banking partners, though it declined to disclose exact names. It will also look to continue building out its compliance product. </p>\n<p>“That includes expanding licensing coverage, upgrading transaction monitoring and fraud detection, and growing our compliance team headcount and expertise,” Udotong said. </p>\n<p>Overall, Udotong hopes the company will help give businesses more of a fair chance while competing on a global scale. </p>\n<p>“If we succeed, more businesses in underserved regions will survive and grow, creating jobs and wealth for their communities instead of being left behind,” he said.</p>\n</div><div>\n<div>\n\t\t<p>Dominic-Madori Davis is a senior venture capital and startup reporter at TechCrunch.

    "body": "<div>\n<p>For years, some of the most dangerous hacking threats have come from adversarial nation-state hackers conducting espionage, Russian ransomware gangs targeting critical infrastructure, and governments targeting journalists with spyware that can punch through the security of almost any phone.  </p>\n<p>But a new phenomenon of mostly English-speaking young adults and teenage hackers has risen to become a top pressing global threat of today, spanning cybercrime, child abuse, and extremism.</p>\n<p>By tearing through some of the biggest companies, tech giants, and governments, these young and highly financially motivated hackers have destroyed networks and extorted hundreds of millions of dollars from wealthy corporate victims.  </p>\n<p>One of the few companies with eyes on this subculture is Unit 221B, a New Jersey-based security company that has made a name for itself by tracking these hackers and disrupting their operations where others have struggled or outright failed. </p>\n<p>Investors have taken notice of the security company.

This is in large part thanks to its flagship threat intelligence platform eWitness and its diverse team of hackers, engineers, and forensic specialists. </p>\n<p>The company has also helped to recover legal wins and financial losses based on the findings of their investigations.  </p>\n<p>The $5 million in seed funding will be used to expand and improve its eWitness threat intelligence platform, with the aim of helping law enforcement and government investigators track and arrest malicious hackers faster. </p>\n<p>“The problems we’re solving are most acutely how the online threat landscape has evolved — youth that are able to go online and cause very high harm, both in the real world and online world, at much speed and scale, that just didn’t exist a few years ago,” Unit 221B’s chief executive May Chen-Contino tells TechCrunch.  </p>\n<p>“We’re hyper focused on that current problem,” said Chen-Contino. </p>\n<p>eWitness is an invite-only software platform that collects large amounts of threat intelligence — information that can be used for tracking malicious threat actors across the web — from trusted sources, including police, journalists, and security researchers. The platform aims to make it easier for investigators to identify and track these threats, collect and preserve information for building cases, and to hand off intelligence to others for additional work. </p>\n<p>The platform is also used by private companies, including the Fortune 500, who use the collected intelligence to track the threat from these groups, such as how often their brand or their industry vertical are targeted or compromised. </p>\n<p>Allison Nixon, Unit 221B’s chief research officer and a leading expert on English-speaking hacking threats, told TechCrunch that The Com is likely “going to continue to grow in the same trajectory that has been,” and that the funding will help the company further its ability to track and help investigators arrest English-speaking threats. </p>\n</div><div>\n<div>\n\t\t<p>Zack Whittaker is the security editor at TechCrunch.

    "body": "<div>\n<p>U.K.-based fintech <a href=\"https://www.tide.co/\" target=\"_blank\">Tide</a> has entered the unicorn club with a fresh funding of $120 million led by TPG, as the startup now serves over 1.6 million micro and small enterprises globally — with more than half of them based in India, the company’s largest and fastest-growing market.</p>\n<p>The new round — a mix of primary and secondary investment, though the startup declined to confirm the exact split — values the eight-year-old startup at $1.5 billion. It includes share sales by employees, early angels, and a few minority investors. TPG backed the round through its multi-sector impact vehicle, The Rise Fund, which has invested in over 85 mission-driven companies. Existing investor, the Apax Digital Funds, also participated.</p>\n<p>Globally, micro and small enterprises, including contractors, freelancers, and solopreneurs, spend a significant amount of time on business management tasks like accounting, invoicing, taxes, securing loans, and managing payments and expenses. While traditional banks and fintech startups offer services to this segment, most solutions are not purpose-built for their unique needs. Tide aims to change that with its unified business platform, offering tailored tools such as accounting integrations, invoicing, business loans, asset finance, payroll, expense cards, and even company registration.</p>\n<p>Initially <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2017/07/03/uks-tide-raises-14m-to-challenge-big-banks-with-a-mobile-first-service-for-smbs/\" target=\"_blank\">launched</a> in the U.K. in 2017, Tide expanded into India in December 2022 to tap into the country’s vast base of small enterprises — <a href=\"https://www.pib.gov.in/PressReleasePage.aspx?PRID=2099687\" target=\"_blank\">around 60 million micro and small businesses</a> employing over 250 million people, per the recent Indian government data. Since its entry, Tide has onboarded more than 800,000 Indian businesses, which it refers to as “members” — surpassing its U.K. member base of nearly 800,000. In the U.K., where Tide is already profitable, the company serves around 14% of the country’s small and medium business market.</p>\n<p>“There is a huge trend to formalization. So, our biggest enemy is cash, and not any competitors,” said Oliver Prill, CEO of Tide, in an interview.</p>\n<p>“In India, there’s a debate, as the growth rate slowed a little bit, but it’s still a hugely impressive growth rate. You look at continental Europe or the U.K., the growth rate is a lot less,” he told TechCrunch.</p>\n<p>Tide estimates that around four million micro and small businesses are launched in India every year. These businesses typically seek support in areas like accessing formal credit, accepting Indian government-backed Unified Payments Interface (UPI) for payments, and navigating the country’s indirect tax system, the Goods and Services Tax. Tide serves them through its digital platform, available as an app on both iOS and Android.</p>\n<div>\n\t\t<p>Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t<p><span>San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>October 27-29, 2025</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n<p>The U.K. startup expects to onboard one million businesses in India by the end of this year and is already seeing strong demand from tier-3 cities and beyond (referring to smaller, less urbanized towns with limited digital and financial infrastructure), Gurjodhpal Singh, CEO of Tide India, told TechCrunch.</p>\n<p>In India, Tide works with around 25 lenders on its platform to facilitate credit for small businesses, recommending partners based on each business’s needs. The company also offers services such as fixed deposits, bill payments, bank transfers, and cash withdrawals through ATMs.</p>\n<p>In addition to the U.K. and India, Tide launched in Germany in May 2024 and expanded into France earlier this month. The startup offers a tailored experience in each market, including local language support.</p>\n<p>With the fresh funding, Tide plans to expand further geographically, enhance its product, and invest in agentic AI. </p>\n<p>The startup covers a range of finance and admin services already, but there are still some gaps to fill. “In the next few months and quarters, you’ll see some major developments in that area,” Prill said, referring to upcoming product launches enabled by the latest funding round.</p>\n<p>Tide currently employs over 2,500 people across its global operations.</p>\n</div>"

    "body": "<div>\n<p>On Friday, Blue Origin won a major NASA contract to deliver a lunar rover to the moon, a strong vote of confidence in both the Blue Moon lander and the future of human exploration.</p>\n<p>The contract also means that the VIPER rover will finally see the lunar surface after NASA shelved the entire program last year due to delays and cost overruns.</p>\n<p>Under the deal, Blue Origin will carry VIPER – short for “Volatiles Investigating Polar Exploration Rover” – on its uncrewed Blue Moon Mk1 lander. Separately, NASA has awarded the company a human-rated lander contract under Artemis, but that program is distinct from this mission.</p>\n<p>This new award was granted under NASA’s Commercial Lunar Payload Services task order for roughly $190 million. Blue Moon Mk1 is targeting a site near the lunar south pole, where scientists suspect there are significant stores of water ice. VIPER will drill down into the surface to test that hypothesis.</p>\n<p>The decision closes an uncertain chapter for VIPER. The agency first selected Pittsburgh-based <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/11/nasa-picks-astrobotic-to-deliver-its-water-hunting-robot-rover-to-the-moon/\">Astrobotic in 2020</a> to deliver the rover on its Griffin lander, an award initially valued at $199.5 million. After delays on both the rover and lander, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/07/18/nasa-cancels-450m-viper-moon-mission-dashing-ice-prospecting-dreams/\">NASA canceled VIPER in July 2024</a>, citing ballooning costs, even though much of the hardware was already built.</p>\n<p>The move drew criticism from lawmakers and scientists. One month later, NASA issued a request for ideas from U.S. companies to explore ways to put the existing rover to work without adding additional costs to the government.</p>\n<p>For Blue Origin, this win is important: this award gives the cargo workhorse lander its first high-profile scientific payload and pins it to a schedule, late 2027. It also marks a second major NASA endorsement of the company’s lunar ambitions after the Human Landing System contract.</p>\n<div>\n\t\t<p>Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t<p><span>San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>October 27-29, 2025</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n<p>About the size of a golf cart, VIPER will spend roughly 100 days on the lunar surface, driving around, prospecting and drilling to map water ice deposits. The rover is equipped with several instruments, including the drill and three spectrometers designed to detect water, hydrogen and other minerals.</p>\n<p>The results are key to NASA’s future science goals and to any long-term human presence on the moon, where extracting resources in-situ – rather than hauling them from Earth – will be critical.

    "body": "<div>\n<p>It sounds like Bluesky is getting serious about giving some users the boot, with the company saying it will be doing more to “enforce our moderation policies to better cultivate a space for healthy conversations.”</p>\n<p>This is part of <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/08/14/bluesky-rolls-out-massive-revamp-to-policies-and-community-guidelines/\">a broader update</a> to the social media company’s community guidelines, after Bluesky asked users in August to provide feedback on an earlier draft of these changes. In <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://bsky.social/about/blog/09-19-2025-building-healthier-social-media\">a new blog post</a>, the company said it received comments from more than 14,000 community members, and that it “especially heard from community members who shared concerns about how the guidelines could impact creative expression and traditionally marginalized voices.”</p>\n<p>“After considering this feedback, and in a return to our experimental roots, we are going to bring a greater focus to encouraging constructive dialogue and enforcing our rules against harassment and toxic content,” the company said. “For starters, we are going to increase our enforcement efforts.”</p>\n<p>As part of that enforcement, Bluesky said that it will “more quickly escalate enforcement actions towards account restrictions.” When asked for more details, a Bluesky spokesperson told TechCrunch that moving forward, users who violate the guidelines will be getting fewer warnings before their accounts are deactivated.</p>\n<p>In addition, the company will be “making product changes that clarify when content is likely to violate our community guidelines” — so perhaps users will also see more warnings before they post content that might run afoul of the guidelines.</p>\n<p>Who gets banned and why remains a fraught issue for Bluesky (as it is for most social networks). For example, there have been recurring complaints that accounts fundraising for Palestinians in Gaza <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.dailydot.com/viral-politics/bluesky-palestine-moderation/\">have been unfairly suspended</a>.</p>\n<p>More recently, many users criticized Bluesky’s decision to temporarily suspend the horror writer Gretchen Felker-Martin due to <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.tcj.com/horror-it-girl-gretchen-felker-martin-on-dc-pulling-red-hood-after-charlie-kirk-comments-i-had-no-regrets/\">her now-deleted comments about the shooting of Charlie Kirk</a>.

The company has previously said it plans to turn on Sparc later in 2026, and Mumgaard confirmed that CFS is “on track to do that.”</p>\n<p>“One of the reasons we built Sparc is so that we could actually get the experience of what it’s like to build a nearly full-scale system,” he said. “Arc will be the first of many that’s backed by a supply chain that is primed for scale.”</p>\n<p>CFS is widely regarded as a leader in the fusion industry. It’s reactor design is based on the tokamak, a widely studied system in which D-shaped superconducting magnets confine and compress superheated plasma. In that plasma, particles collide, forming new atoms and releasing energy in the process. The company frequently updates scientists on its progress, and it has run extensive simulations to uncover any potential hurdles. </p>\n<p>CFS expects that Sparc will prove be able to generate more power than is required to sustain the fusion reactions. But at the same time, the company won’t know for sure if it all works until Sparc is complete. That’s likely to exhaust a significant fraction of the nearly $3 billion it has raised to date, including an<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/08/28/nvidia-google-and-bill-gates-help-commonwealth-fusion-systems-raise-863m/\"> $863 million Series B2 round</a> announced three weeks ago. That round included checks from a wide range of investors, including Nvidia, Google, Breakthrough Energy Ventures, and Eni.</p>\n<div>\n\t\t<p>Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t<p><span>San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>October 27-29, 2025</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n<p>Which raises the question, what happens to CFS’s deals with Google and Eni if there’s a delay, or worse, if the reactors don’t work as planned?</p>\n<p>The agreements are structured to “walk the line” between punitive and collaborative, Mumgaard said. The partners “understand these challenges that come from first of a kind,” he said. “No one in this situation is like, oh, you know, invent an entire new technology, an entire industry, and if it doesn’t work on this day, we’re just going to walk away.”</p>\n<p>Google has hinted that it will use Arc’s electricity to power its data centers, but Eni, which is one of the world’s largest oil and gas companies, doesn’t have operations in the U.S. that would demand that amount of energy.</p>\n<p>“The power will be sent to the grid at the end of the day,” said Lorenzo Fiorillo, Eni’s director of technology, R&D, and digital. </p>\n<p>In short, Eni will resell it.</p>\n<p>But any electricity generated by Arc, a first-of-its-kind reactor, is going to be expensive. Eni is more likely to lose money trading that power on the grid than it is to profit. </p>\n<p>Instead, this agreement is likely intended to help establish a price for fusion power and rustle up more money to build Arc.</p>\n<p>Mumgaard admitted as much. The power purchase agreement, he said, “gives us the certainty of where the power is going to go, what the price is going to be, etc. And that allows us to then take that package to more financial investors in project finance and other areas and start having conversations about what it’s going to be like to actually finance this plant.”</p>\n</div><div>\n<div>\n\t\t<p>Tim De Chant is a senior climate reporter at TechCrunch.

    "body": "<div>\n<p>Few things generate as much data as simply observing the Earth from above. But Ryan Abernathey and Joe Hamman very quickly realized that all that data still wasn’t enough for their startup to thrive. Their data-centric, climate tech startup, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://earthmover.io/\">Earthmover</a>, would need to pivot.</p>\n<p>The pivot isn’t entirely away from climate tech, though. Instead, the company is shrinking the time scale, focusing on how climate affects daily life — in other words, the weather.</p>\n<p>“What makes a compelling use case for our platform? Data that change frequently,” Abernathey, Earthmover’s co-founder and CEO, told TechCrunch. “That’s where there’s a lot more urgency around solutions. That [data] goes to weather, goes to fire, goes to new observations that are being generated.” </p>\n<p>Climate outputs, he noted, are “important, but they’re kind of static,” with new data emerging every few years.</p>\n<p>Earthmover’s core product remains its data structure, which was built to handle large, complex data sets. “In geospatial they call it a raster. In AI, they call it a tensor. In old school Fortran, they just call it an array,” Abernathey said. On top of that, the startup has built a range of tools to help customers tease insights out of their data.</p>\n<p>The pivot has helped Earthmover find paying customers — more than 10 so far, per Abernathey — and land a $7.2 million seed round, the company exclusively told TechCrunch. The round was led by Lowercarbon Capital, with participation from Costanoa Ventures and Preston-Werner Ventures. The company is using the cash to build new tools atop its data storage platform.</p>\n<p>Earthmover is built on open-source software, including Xarray, Pangeo and Icechunk, and runs on major cloud providers, including Google Cloud, AWS and Microsoft Azure, as well as on-premise servers. Both Abernathey and Hamman, Earthmover’s CTO, have deep ties to the open-source world, having worked on Pangeo and Xarray.</p>\n<div>\n\t\t<p>Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t<p><span>San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>October 27-29, 2025</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n<p>Part of the decision to use those tools was motivated by their facility with Earth observation data, which can quickly demand terabytes or even petabytes of storage. Typical Earthmover customers have between tens to hundreds of terabytes, Abernathey said. </p>\n<p>But the decision to go open source was also motivated by a business reality: Building tools atop open-source projects helps give customers peace of mind, Abernathey said. </p>\n<p>“If you’re a serious multinational company, you’re going to have a dependency on a startup,” he said. But by using open source tools, “the customer’s risk, in a way, is mitigated because if we pivot or go out of business or whatever, they’ve still got all their own data in their own storage.”</p>\n<p>Earthmover’s customers include insurance startup Kettle, which uses the platform to assess wildfire risk, and RWE, the German multinational energy company. Abernathey said renewable companies, which are exposed to the vagaries of the weather, use Earthmover’s tools to forecast supply and demand. </p>\n<p>The goal is to make weather and geospatial data accessible to more users. “If you’re a trading desk, you want to see the map of the latest forecast, and you want it on a dashboard,” Hamman said. “You don’t want to run a Python script or something to do it.”</p>\n</div><div>\n<div>\n\t\t<p>Tim De Chant is a senior climate reporter at TechCrunch.
