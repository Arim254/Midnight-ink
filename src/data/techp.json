The IPO was <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/03/25/cerebras-systems-ipo-is-further-delayed/\" target=\"_blank\">further delayed</a> in early 2025 due to unfilled positions in CFIUS at the beginning of President Donald Trump’s term.  </p>\n<p>Feldman said that the company still plans to IPO, but wouldn’t share specifics. He said that the company is following a common path for late-stage startups of raising a large funding round from largely public investors before listing on the public market itself.  </p>\n<p>“We chose a small number of leaders who would help us, not just in this round, but in the future,” Feldman said. “Companies that are leaders in late-stage private [fundraising], but predominantly do public. And you know, it’s our aspiration to be a public company.” </p>\n</div><div>\n<div>\n\t\t<p>Becca is a senior writer at TechCrunch that covers venture capital trends and startups.

While these are agents that are limited to one browser, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://composite.com/\">Composite</a> aims to build an agentic solution that helps professionals with their tasks, regardless of which browser they use.</p>\n<p>The startup was started earlier this year by Yang Fan Yun and Charlie Deane. Yun is a former product manager at Uber, while Deane founded a company selling server proxies. When he was at Uber, he realized that a lot of people around him were doing grunt work in their browsers.   </p>\n<p>“I saw people in different roles, including marketing, sales, recruitment, and security engineers, do a lot of tedious work in their browsers. I felt that this stops them from putting their education and skill to full use, and I wanted to automate this work easily for them,” Yun told TechCrunch over a call about Composite’s core problem statement.</p>\n<p>The company said today that it has raised $5.6 million in seed funding in a round led by Nat Friedman and Daniel Gross’s venture firm NFDG, with participation from Menlo Ventures and Anthropic’s Anthology Fund.</p>\n<figure><img src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Product-Screenshot.jpeg?w=680\" alt=\"A screenshot showing Composite helping a user get through tasks using AI agents.\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Product-Screenshot.jpeg 3456w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Product-Screenshot.jpeg?resize=150,97 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Product-Screenshot.jpeg?resize=300,194 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Product-Screenshot.jpeg?resize=768,496 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Product-Screenshot.jpeg?resize=680,440 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Product-Screenshot.jpeg?resize=1200,776 1200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Product-Screenshot.jpeg?resize=1280,827 1280w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Product-Screenshot.jpeg?resize=430,278 430w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Product-Screenshot.jpeg?resize=720,465 720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Product-Screenshot.jpeg?resize=900,582 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Product-Screenshot.jpeg?resize=800,517 800w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Product-Screenshot.jpeg?resize=1536,993 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Product-Screenshot.jpeg?resize=2048,1324 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Product-Screenshot.jpeg?resize=668,432 668w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Product-Screenshot.jpeg?resize=580,375 580w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Product-Screenshot.jpeg?resize=954,617 954w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Product-Screenshot.jpeg?resize=708,458 708w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Product-Screenshot.jpeg?resize=50,32 50w\" /><figcaption><span>Image Credits: Composite</span></figcaption></figure>\n<p>Composite offers its solution for Macs at the moment, and setup is very easy, as you just need to install the browser extension for agents to make use of that browser. You can issue different commands across tools that you use on the web, and Composite will get the work done. For instance, it can help you go through your Jira backlog for bugs using relevant documents, leave comments on high-priority bugs, and also mark duplicate bugs as resolved.  </p>\n<p>The startup says security engineers can use it for looking up candidates across sites and draft personalized emails, security engineers can create vulnerability tickets based on alerts, and marketers can pull reports from different sources to create short insights reports.</p>\n<p>Yun said that other AI browsers and agents from companies like OpenAI and Perplexity are solving for non-professional needs, such as helping with shopping and booking tickets. </p>\n<div>\n\t\t<p>Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t<p><span>San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>October 27-29, 2025</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n<p>“We are an ideal tool for professionals who want to set their workflows without having technical knowledge.

But in the coming months, the company is aiming to develop a better mechanism to automatically surface tasks that Composite can do on the user’s behalf. The startup is also working on a way to schedule tasks for recurring usage. </p>\n<p>The startup said that because it doesn’t need users to switch browsers, allows admins to restrict tools, execute tasks locally, and also lets users define what websites are out of bounds, its tools are better suited for professionals.</p>\n<p>There is a lot of competition in the area of having agents do work for professionals. Companies like <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/07/17/openai-launches-a-general-purpose-agent-in-chatgpt/\">OpenAI</a> that use their own browser to take actions, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/09/18/notion-launches-agents-for-data-analysis-and-task-automation/\">Notion</a> relies on users’ context within the app, combined with other connectors.

A lot of these startups are in early stages, and there are questions around AI agents’ efficiency in the long term. While investors are ready to put their money, the startups working in this area will have a lot to prove to justify it. </p>\n<p>Matt Kraning, a partner at Menlo Ventures, is confident in Composite’s ability to stand out. He told TechCrunch over a call that the tool was very intuitive to use for professionals without being overtly technical.</p>\n<p>“Composite handles different modalities and sites very well, and it is designed with professional use cases in mind. The tool is well-suited for people who might have to go through a lot of tasks in a day across a range. of functions,” he said.</p>\n</div><div>\n<div>\n\t\t<p>Ivan covers global consumer tech developments at TechCrunch.

It still needs to meet certain regulatory requirements, which include receiving an exemption from the federal government to deploy its custom, driverless vehicles commercially.</p>\n<div>\n\t\t<p>Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t<p><span>San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>October 27-29, 2025</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n<p>Zoox has made progress on that front: The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration gave <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/08/06/federal-regulators-give-zoox-an-exemption-for-its-custom-built-robotaxis/\">Zoox an exemption</a> in August to demonstrate its custom-built robotaxis on public roads, though it only covers research and demonstrations on public roads.

    "body": "<div>\n<p>David Berg learned a lot about the waste management industry by driving a garbage truck around the country as the first employee at Ohio-based Brattle Motors. </p>\n<p>He discovered that despite the sheer number of sales prospecting platforms, selling to the waste management industry is still an offline endeavor.  </p>\n<p>“All of them had a unanimous way of going to market, which was old school ways of pen and paper, door-to-door knocking, [and] little-to-no technology on both CRM prospecting or any bit of the sales funnel,” Berg told TechCrunch. “We saw an opportunity there to be the first, not only to build within the space, but to disrupt an entire market.” </p>\n<p>Berg launched <a href=\"https://www.commanderai.com/\" target=\"_blank\">CommanderAI</a> in early 2024 as a customer relationship manager (CRM) and sales prospecting platform built for waste management — and other industrial services like dumpster rentals and industrial recyclers – to fill that gap.  </p>\n<p>Berg, who is also the CEO of CommanderAI, said that while Salesforce or HubSpot could be customized for the waste management industry, the technology is too complicated and lacks the necessary nuances about the industry to see widespread adoption. CommanderAI’s software is also better suited to the types of contracts that waste management companies use, he said.</p>\n<p>These platforms don’t have the specific types of data that waste management companies use to find customers, Berg said. Waste management companies sell to small, standalone businesses that might not have an online presence, and to new construction projects that aren’t widely advertised. CommanderAI pulls that information for its users using AI.  </p>\n<p>“Although that data is inherently available somewhere on the public web, to be able to segment it and actually repurpose it to where it’s useful took a lot of work,” Berg said. “That’s where the AI [large language model] pipeline comes in. There’s many more nuances within waste.” </p>\n<div>\n\t\t<p>Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t<p><span>San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>October 27-29, 2025</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n<p>Waste management isn’t a small industry. The U.S. waste management industry generated more than $100 billion in revenue in 2024, according to an industry trade organization. The players in the industry are a diverse mix, ranging from waste haulers with just a handful of trucks up to the $90 billion behemoth Waste Management.  </p>\n<p>“The way that we’re approaching it to them is, ‘Hey, look, we know you have a way of selling. You’ve been doing this for 20 plus years. All we’re here to do is help you sell more efficiently,’” Berg said. “’We’re not here to replace your sales team. We’re not here to change your way of doing things.’” </p>\n<p>The company’s platform is designed to work for haulers with one truck up to enterprise-size businesses, Berg said, and is currently focused on mid-to-large regional players. Currently, the company is finding success with medical and hazardous waste management companies.   </p>\n<p>CommanderAI has just raised a $5 million seed round led by 11 Tribes Ventures with participation from Watchfire Ventures, Gaingels, and Rad Fund. Berg said the company will use the capital to “pour gasoline on the fire” and bulk up the company’s sales team in addition to continuing to build out the product with features including mapping, marketing, and routing.  </p>\n<p>“Most investors, at least a list of investors, don’t have any real investments within waste management,” Berg said. “There are only around 10 active software providers in the entire industry. A lot of it was really just investor education. Here’s who we’re selling to, here’s how they operate.” </p>\n<p>The company plans to expand outside of waste management and into adjacent industries when the timing is right as well.  </p>\n<p>“We’d like to have 30% of the waste management industry using CommanderAI AI as their lead source of AI tooling and really any sort of tooling within their tech stack,” Berg said.</p>\n</div><div>\n<div>\n\t\t<p>Becca is a senior writer at TechCrunch that covers venture capital trends and startups.

With this Opera joins a growing number of companies like Perplexity and The Browser Company that are trying to make agentic browsers happen.</p>\n<p>The company first announced that it was <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/05/28/operas-new-browser-can-code-websites-and-games-for-you/\">working on Neon in May</a>, but the browser was in closed preview. It will now start sending invites to select people, who can use the browser for a fee of $19.99 per month.</p>\n<p>“We built Opera Neon for ourselves – and for everyone who uses AI extensively in their day-to-day. Today, we’re welcoming the first users who will help shape the future of agentic browsing with us,” said Krystian Kolondra, EVP Browsers at Opera, in a statement. </p>\n<p>There are a few key parts of the browser. First, there is a plain old chatbot that you can converse with to get answers to your questions. The more agentic feature of the browser is called Neon Do, which will help you get tasks done.

    "body": "<div>\n<p>On Tuesday, DoorDash unveiled Dot, a small robot it built in-house that can autonomously drive on roads, bike lanes, and sidewalks to deliver food and small packages at speeds up to 20 miles per hour. Dot is designed to look friendly and even cartoonish — painted bright red, with big LED eyes and a mouth that swings open to reveal where it holds your food — though I’d argue it’s slightly creepy.</p>\n<p>DoorDash says it’s already testing the robot with early access partners in the Phoenix metropolitan area, and plans to make it available to the region’s 1.6 million residents by the end of 2025.</p>\n<p>It might sound odd for a food-delivery app like DoorDash to compete with trillion-dollar companies like Google and Tesla on autonomous vehicle (AV) technology. In San Francisco, Austin, and cities around the country, hailing a robotaxi is already commonplace for many residents. DoorDash argues that a similar reckoning is coming for the food delivery space, and that Dot’s size and design are key.</p>\n<p>The stakes are high for this little, cute (terrifying?) robot. Countless startups have flamed out in the AV space, with some even <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/11/15/gms-cruise-to-pay-500000-fine-to-doj-admits-submitting-false-report/\">facing penalties and fines</a> when their machines caused harm.

Sidewalk robots, such as those developed by companies like <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/01/07/serve-robotics-raises-additional-80m-as-it-scales-sidewalk-delivery-robots/\">Serve Robotics</a>, address this challenge of negotiating tight spaces, but they can’t drive on roads or at high speeds like Dot can.</p>\n<p>“You don’t always need a full-sized car to deliver a tube of toothpaste or pack of diapers,” said Tang. “Dot is purpose-built for the millions of deliveries we facilitate every day. It is small enough to navigate doorways and driveways, fast enough to maintain food quality, and smart enough to optimize the best routes for delivery.”</p>\n<p>Dot has four wheels and stands less than five feet tall and three feet wide. It’s roughly a tenth the size of a car and weighs 350 pounds. Press a button on what can only be described as Dot’s “mouth,” and enough cargo space is revealed to fit six pizza boxes or up to 30 pounds of food. There are various inserts that merchants can put inside of a Dot to meet their needs, including cupholders and coolers.</p>\n<div>\n\t\t<p>Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t<p><span>San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>October 27-29, 2025</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n<figure><img src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/DoorDash-Dot-31.jpg?w=680\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/DoorDash-Dot-31.jpg 5568w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/DoorDash-Dot-31.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/DoorDash-Dot-31.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/DoorDash-Dot-31.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/DoorDash-Dot-31.jpg?resize=680,453 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/DoorDash-Dot-31.jpg?resize=1200,800 1200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/DoorDash-Dot-31.jpg?resize=1280,853 1280w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/DoorDash-Dot-31.jpg?resize=430,287 430w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/DoorDash-Dot-31.jpg?resize=720,480 720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/DoorDash-Dot-31.jpg?resize=900,600 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/DoorDash-Dot-31.jpg?resize=800,533 800w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/DoorDash-Dot-31.jpg?resize=1536,1024 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/DoorDash-Dot-31.jpg?resize=2048,1365 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/DoorDash-Dot-31.jpg?resize=668,445 668w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/DoorDash-Dot-31.jpg?resize=563,375 563w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/DoorDash-Dot-31.jpg?resize=926,617 926w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/DoorDash-Dot-31.jpg?resize=708,472 708w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/DoorDash-Dot-31.jpg?resize=50,33 50w\" /><figcaption><span>One of the inserts inside Dot’s cargo space (Credit: DoorDash)</span></figcaption></figure>\n<p>There’s also an LED strip on top of the vehicle to display text, and speakers that can emit a robotic voice.

The company says this was a key design feature to decouple storage and charging of the vehicles.</p>\n<p>For navigation, Dot uses eight external cameras, alongside four radar and three lidar sensors to detect obstacles.

Back in 2019, DoorDash <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2019/08/20/doordash-acquires-autonomous-driving-startup-scotty-labs/\">acquired the AV startup Scotty Labs</a>, and brought on the co-founders of another AV mapping startup, Lvl 5. In 2021, the company hired Ashu Rege, a former executive at the Amazon-owned AV company Zoox, to lead its autonomy division.</p>\n<p>In an interview with TechCrunch, Rege says that DoorDash’s early conversations with lawmakers regarding Dot have been positive. He says city and state officials have touted small vehicle delivery as a way to reduce traffic congestion.</p>\n<p>Human delivery workers may be less enthusiastic. In a press release, DoorDash says humans will still fulfill a vast majority of their daily orders, while automation will let some “focus more on the high-value orders that require human judgment and care.”</p>\n<p>Another hurdle for Dot is safety. Rege says Dot is trained to be deferential to bicyclists and pedestrians, while being large enough to be visible to drivers.</p>\n<p>If a Dot runs into trouble on the road, Rege says Dots cannot be remotely operated by humans. DoorDash believes teleoperation isn’t the right approach for Dot, and instead, trains it to simply wait and pull over to the side of the road (though that’s easier said than done in some cases). Rege says a field operator will be dispatched to the Dot’s location in serious circumstances.</p>\n<p>In Phoenix, DoorDash has created an ecosystem to support its small fleet of Dots: warehouses to store the robots, charging stations to fill up their batteries, and field operators to clean and rescue them. Rege declined to disclose headcount or costs for this ecosystem.</p>\n<p>Much like people have vandalized Waymos, it seems likely that people will try to mess with Dots. DoorDash says it included a camera inside Dot’s cargo space, partially to ensure small humans don’t climb inside. Dot is also light enough to be tipped over by a few people, but Rege says field operators can flip them back upright if that ever happens.</p>\n<p>While Dot may look playful, it’s a serious and massive undertaking for DoorDash. The company would surely like to beat Uber and Instacart to market on autonomous delivery vehicles. Dot could reshape DoorDash’s position in the delivery market, but it could also introduce a wide array of new challenges.</p>\n</div>"

While that may sound like positive news, it doesn’t mean that there will suddenly be more open positions.</p>\n<p>Instead, recruiters, often bogged down with determining which applicants are qualified for the next round, will outsource the routine screening tasks — like checking backgrounds, salary needs, and availability — to (you guessed it) AI.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.alex.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Alex</a>, a startup building an AI recruiter, says it’s already helping companies conduct video interviews and phone screens.</p>\n<p>Aaron Wang (pictured center, bottom row), who co-founded Alex about 18 months ago, told TechCrunch that the startup’s voice AI tool can conduct autonomous interviews with applicants soon after they apply for a job. “Our AI recruiter does thousands of interviews a day and helps people get hired at some of the biggest companies in the world,” he said.</p>\n<p>Although Wang, who previously worked at Facebook and spent time as a quant for a hedge fund, declined to name customers, he said they include Fortune 100 companies, financial institutions, nationwide restaurant chains, and Big 4 accounting firms.</p>\n<p>Investors view the rise of AI interviewers as a trend that many companies will inevitably adopt. That conviction led to Alex’s new $17 million Series A round, which was led by Peak XV Partners. The round included participation from Y Combinator and Uncorrelated Ventures, along with several chief human resources officers (CHROs) from unnamed Fortune 500 companies, and others. This Series A follows the company’s $3 million seed funding, which was led by 1984 Ventures last year.</p>\n<p>Alex isn’t alone in offering AI recruiting services to companies.
