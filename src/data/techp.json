The company’s request comes the same week that President Donald Trump — who Tesla CEO Elon Musk <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2025/02/01/politics/elon-musk-2024-election-spending-millions\" target=\"_blank\">spent $300 million</a> to help elect — told the United Nations General Assembly that he thinks climate change is a “con job” and a “scam.”</p>\n<p>Tesla also asked the EPA not to scuttle a 2009 legal standard known as the Endangerment Finding, which many modern environmental regulations (like the vehicle emissions standards) are based on. Tesla said that finding is “based on a robust factual and scientific record,” according to the company’s letter to the agency.</p>\n<p>The EPA has been seeking comment since August for these proposed attacks on environmental rules. The agency’s administrator, Lee Zeldin, said at the time that, if passed, the rollbacks would drive “a dagger into the heart of the climate change religion.”</p>\n<p>Tesla’s nominal mission is to “accelerate the world’s transition to sustainable energy.” But the company financially benefits from stricter environmental regulations. When other automakers fall short of fleet emissions goals, they pay companies like Tesla hundreds of millions of dollars to buy “credits” to make up the difference. (Those credits technically come from a California program that has <a href=\"https://calmatters.org/environment/2025/05/california-electric-car-mandate-senate-revoke-waiver/\" target=\"_blank\">also been a Republican target</a>.) While Tesla is asking for the standards to be maintained, the company told the EPA it is “open to discussing mechanisms to streamline” them in order to keep them around. </p>\n</div>\n<div>\n\t<p>Topics</p>\n</div>\n</div><div><div>\n\t<div>\n\t\t<p>Subscribe for the industry’s biggest tech news</p>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n<p></p><h2 id=\"h-latest-in\">Latest in Transportation</h2><p></p>\n</div>"

    "body": "<div>\n<p>For years, recruiters used machine learning to find potential hires by searching for keywords in résumés and LinkedIn profiles. Although this method helps to narrow the candidate pool, recruiters still have to manually review each profile to determine the best fit for the job.</p>\n<p>David Paffenholz (pictured left) and Ishan Gupta, then just 22 and 19, respectively, realized that LLMs could find talent faster and more efficiently. They built <a href=\"https://juicebox.ai/\" target=\"_blank\">Juicebox</a>, an AI-powered search engine that uses natural language to analyze professional profiles, personal websites, and other publicly available information to identify the most qualified candidates.</p>\n<p>After attending startup accelerator Y Combinator in the summer of 2022, Paffenholz and Gupta spent a couple more years refining their product. When their AI search engine, PeopleGPT, was ready in late 2023, it was quickly adopted by a wide range of customers, from small startups to large companies like Cognition, Ramp, and Perplexity.</p>\n<p>In a short period of time, it was serving over 2,500 customers and achieving more than $10 million in annual recurring revenue (ARR).</p>\n<p>On Thursday, Juicebox announced that it had raised $36 million in total funding, including a $30 million Series A round led by Sequoia.</p>\n<p>Sequoia partner David Cahn learned about the company while catching up with an early-stage startup founder who said that he is using Juicebox for all of his recruiting efforts. Cahn told TechCrunch that the founder has hired over a dozen people without using a professional recruiter, something that was previously very difficult to do.</p>\n<p>Such a rave review of Juicebox piqued Cahn’s interest. Shortly after, Cahn learned that Sequoia’s internal recruiter was also trying Juicebox to help the firm with its own hiring efforts, which made him even more excited about the startup’s growth potential.  </p>\n<div>\n\t\t<p>Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t<p><span>San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>October 27-29, 2025</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n<p>When Cahn eventually met with Paffenholz and Gupta, he was even more impressed.</p>\n<p>“I’m not sure I’ve ever in my career seen a company with four people that got to 2,000 customers with that small of a team,” Cahn told TechCrunch.</p>\n<p>Although Juicebox has since hired eight additional employees, the company continues to attract customers without a sales team.</p>\n<p>Customers are flocking to Juicebox in part because hiring speed is extremely important for companies racing to build AI functionalities.</p>\n<p>What sets Juicebox’s search engine apart is its ability to infer information about candidates much like a human would.</p>\n<p>“We help find net new candidates that wouldn’t be found elsewhere, because the profiles might not have the keywords or the types of things that we’d expect them to have in the regular searches,” Paffenholz told TechCrunch.</p>\n<p>The startup’s product is popular not only with small companies that lack a dedicated recruiter, but also with talent teams at large corporations. By automating the candidate search, the tool frees up internal recruiters to focus more on building relationships with potential hires.</p>\n<p>Once Juicebox identifies candidates, its agent can automatically email them and schedule initial calls.</p>\n<p>While Juicebox is growing quickly, older talent acquisition startups like <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/10/ai-startup-eightfold-valued-at-2-1b-in-softbank-led-220m-funding/\">Eightfold</a> are also adding AI-powered search functionality to their offerings.</p>\n<p>Still, Cahn is convinced that Paffenholz and Gupta can transform Juicebox into an essential product for every startup’s technology stack.</p>\n<p>“We’ve invested in a number of businesses that become defaults for startups, like Stripe,” he said. “I think Juicebox has a chance to be a default where, every single startup, [it’s] the first thing they use to hire their first employees.”</p>\n</div><div>\n<div>\n\t\t<p>Marina Temkin is a venture capital and startups reporter at TechCrunch.

Its posts, replies, and updates move faster, particularly as news breaks or major events unfold, similar to Elon Musk’s X.

A more real-time interface for “tagging the algorithm” could work better.</p>\n<p>Users on text-focused social apps have grown accustomed to using tools where they reply to posts to take action.

    "body": "<div>\n<p>President Donald Trump has signed an <a href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/09/saving-tiktok-while-protecting-national-security/\" target=\"_blank\">executive order</a> that essentially approves the sale of TikTok’s U.S. operations to an American investor group in order to keep the social media app operational in the country. Vice President JD Vance said that the deal would value TikTok US at “around $14 billion.”</p>\n<p>TikTok was required to divest its American business or be banned in the U.S. via a national security law originally signed by former president Joe Biden. Trump’s executive order essentially bars the attorney general or Department of Justice from enforcing that law for 120 days while the divestiture plan presented to the president is executed.</p>\n<p>TikTok’s owner ByteDance has not yet publicly acknowledged the deal or executive order, but did, on September 19, issue a <a href=\"https://newsroom.tiktok.com/september-19?lang=en\" target=\"_blank\">statement</a> that “it will work in accordance with applicable laws to ensure TikTok remains available to American users through TikTok U.S.”</p>\n<p>Trump said China’s president Xi Jinping spoke to him and gave him approval.</p>\n<p>“I spoke with President Xi; we had a good talk,” Trump said <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3urjiwp_wQ\" target=\"_blank\">during a briefing with reporters</a>. “I told him what we were doing, and he said, ‘Go ahead with it.”</p>\n<p>The order states that TikTok’ U.S. operations will establish a new board of directors, and that the app’s recommendation algorithm, source code, and content moderation system in the US will be transferred to the control of its new owners. Under the deal’s terms, Oracle will oversee the app’s security operations and provide computing services for TikTok US.</p>\n<p>“It’s owned by Americans, and very sophisticated Americans,” Trump said during the briefing. “This is going to be American operated all the way.”</p>\n<div>\n\t\t<p>Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t<p><span>San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>October 27-29, 2025</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n<p>Trump said that Oracle would be among the U.S. investors in TikTok US but did not disclose the full list of new owners. <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2025/09/25/trump-approves-tiktok-deal-through-executive-order.html\" target=\"_blank\">CNBC reports</a> that Oracle, Silver Lake, and Abu Dhabi-based MGX will get a 45% stake in TikTok’s US company.</p>\n<p>“This deal really does mean Americans can use TikTok but actually use it with more confidence than they had in the past because their data is secure and it won’t be used as a propaganda weapon like it has in the past,” Vance said.</p>\n<p>During the briefing, Trump stated that “every group, every philosophy, every policy will be treated fairly” after being asked if the algorithm would show MAGA-related content following the deal.</p>\n<p>Trump last week signed an executive order that extended ByteDance’s deadline to divest TikTok’s U.S. operations or be banned.

    "body": "<div>\n<p>When Sierra Space won a contract to deliver cargo to the International Space Station nearly a decade ago, the company promised a first for the commercial space market: a privately built, rapid reuse and cargo return spaceplane capable of landing on commercial runways.</p>\n<p>That dream has changed. In a modification to the contract announced earlier this week, NASA and Sierra Space agreed to remove the agency’s guarantee to purchase cargo flights to the ISS. Instead, the Dream Chaser spaceplane will debut in a free-flying demonstration in late 2026, and will not dock with the station.</p>\n<p>NASA said it will provide “minimal support” for that test, and only afterward decide whether to order ISS resupply missions at all.</p>\n<p>The contract change is a blow to the Dream Chaser program. Typically, such programs rely heavily, if not entirely, on government support, as the up-front development costs for a crewed or cargo spacecraft are so high that commercial customers are rarely able to provide enough demand to close the business case.</p>\n<p>SpaceX, for example, received billions from NASA through the Commercial Orbital Transportation Services and Commercial Crew programs to develop its Dragon capsule and Falcon 9 rocket.</p>\n<p>So this change also means that Dream Chaser will need to undergo a major rebranding. The mission was always to resupply the ISS under NASA’s Commercial Resupply Services program, alongside SpaceX’s Dragon and Northrop Grumman’s Cygnus. Those contracts have a combined ceiling of $14 billion across the three providers; NASA has obligated roughly $1.43 billion to Sierra Space so far, but now that may be as far as the commitment goes.</p>\n<p>With that guaranteed income gone, Sierra Space now faces the challenge of repositioning itself as a dual-use platform useful to commercial space stations or defense customers.</p>\n<div>\n\t\t<p>Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t<p><span>San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>October 27-29, 2025</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n<p>Company executives are pushing hard on the defense angle, according to a press release issued on Thursday. Its executive chair Fatih Ozmen said the transition will allow Sierra to provide “unique capabilities to meet the needs of diverse mission profiles, including emerging and existential threats and national security priorities that align with our acceleration into the Defense Tech market.”</p>\n<p>Mid-program pivots are relatively rare in aerospace, but they’ve become more common as space startups contend with shifting government priorities and the need to prove out commercial markets before they exist. Historically, aerospace systems were designed around highly specific mission profiles, but Sierra is arguing that Dream Chaser’s reusability and runway capability make it flexible.</p>\n<p>The free-flying demo could help Sierra showcase Dream Chaser’s flexibility — it could host different payloads and demonstrate other capabilities, without having to dock with the ISS.</p>\n<p>Time is running out. The ISS is slated for deorbit around 2030, which leaves Dream Chaser just a few short years to demonstrate cargo delivery in orbit. But if Dream Chaser can prove itself, it can credibly go on to serve multiple customers and carve out a valuable niche as the only winged spacecraft on the market.</p>\n</div><div>\n<div>\n\t\t<p>Aria Alamalhodaei covers the space and defense industries at TechCrunch.

    "description": "Anode Technology Company wants to build mobile battery generators for construction sites, live events, and EV fleets. But first it has to avoid the pitfalls that claimed its predecessor, Moxion.",
    "body": "<div>\n<p>Just over a year ago, Moxion Power closed its doors, adding its name to a list of high-profile bankruptcies that roiled the climate tech world in 2024. The portable battery startup had raised <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2022/09/28/moxion-nails-100m-series-b-to-replace-noxious-diesel-generators-with-silent-batteries/\">more than $110 million</a> in a bid to replace diesel generators at festivals and construction sites, but even that wasn’t enough to get it through the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/04/27/climate-startup-valley-of-death/\">valley of death</a>. Moxion laid off more than 400 employees and its <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.latitudemedia.com/news/portable-battery-startup-moxion-is-bankrupt-what-happened/\">assets were liquidated</a>.</p>\n<p>Now, the startup’s co-founder, Paul Huelskamp, and several former Moxion employees are back with another startup, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://anode.tech/\">Anode Technology Company</a>, hoping to accomplish the same goal — ideally without repeating the same mistakes.</p>\n<p>“We started Anode with that goal to kind of finish what we started,” Huelskamp, now Anode’s CEO, told TechCrunch.</p>\n<p>Anode has been operating quietly, but it is now emerging with $9 million in seed funding. The round was led by Eclipse, and its partner Jiten Behl, who spearheaded the deal, was previously Rivian’s chief growth officer.</p>\n<p>Behl’s interest in the space was sparked by his experience at Rivian, which once had an agreement to sell 100,000 electric delivery vans to Amazon. But the companies soon realized that the problem wasn’t the cost of the vans, but the charging infrastructure.</p>\n<p>“You need a mini power plant to charge 150 vans, and that infrastructure does not exist at depots,” Behl said.</p>\n<p>In a pinch, many fleets will turn to diesel generators. Waymo, for example, was found to be using them at its depot <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgKTVtj1xQU\">in San Francisco</a>. “What businesses are actually looking for is some grid independent solutions that can provide them flexibility,” Behl added.</p>\n<div>\n\t\t<p>Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t<p><span>San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>October 27-29, 2025</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n<p>Other companies, like Sparkcharge and Power Sonic, provide EV charging using mobile batteries, but Huelskamp claims Anode’s integrated hardware should set it apart. The company has designed an inverter that’ll work for the markets it is targeting, including EV charging, construction sites and live events. </p>\n<p>Anode’s mobile battery is also slightly smaller than Moxion’s 600 kilowatt-hour unit, he said, which makes it easier to load onto flatbed trucks.</p>\n<p>“We are optimizing for the lowest cost of delivered energy. The things that drive cost are, how much energy can you put on the back of a truck? How many trucks do you need? How many drivers do you need? How many trips do you have to take?” Huelskamp said. “A smaller footprint, less energy, might mean more energy on the back of a single flatbed truck. It’s a little counterintuitive.”</p>\n<p>“There’s a lot of those types of requirements that, frankly, we just didn’t appreciate at Moxion.”</p>\n<p>The new startup will use contract manufacturers to make its batteries, a key difference from Moxion, which tried to do it all in house. “One of the main lessons learned is it’s really tough as a startup to take on that part of [the manufacturing],” Huelskamp said.</p>\n<p>For Behl, those lessons served a part in drawing him to the investment. “I’m getting the benefit, as an investor, to have those learnings already secured without having to pay for that,” he said.</p>\n<p>While EV charging depots might be an emerging market, construction and live events are more established industries. Currently, many rent fossil fuel-powered generators, which are costly and not as efficient as a large power plant. That inefficiency, Huelskamp thinks, gives Anode an opening. “We’re charging our batteries at three, four, five cents per kilowatt hour, and the industry is used to paying several dollars per kilowatt hour,” he said.</p>\n<p>Huelskamp said Anode will use AI to optimize its operations, including charging and delivery. Eventually, that should drive down the cost close to parity with electricity from the grid, though not quite as low as off-peak pricing, he said.</p>\n<p>“Over time, as we scale up our operations, create all these efficiencies, drive down the cost of delivered energy, and leverage the continued declines in battery costs, I think it approaches the cost of the power that we get from the grid,” Huelskamp said.</p>\n</div><div>\n<div>\n\t\t<p>Tim De Chant is a senior climate reporter at TechCrunch.

    "body": "<div>\n<p>Amr Awadallah, founder of AI startup Vectara, had two reactions when he heard about changes to the H-1B visa program that <a href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/fact-sheets/2025/09/fact-sheet-president-donald-j-trump-suspends-the-entry-of-certain-alien-nonimmigrant-workers/\" target=\"_blank\">raise the application fee for each visa to $100,000</a>.</p>\n<p>He was not surprised. But he was dismayed.</p>\n<p>“I can’t afford to pay $100,000,” Awadallah told TechCrunch. He’s hired one employee on an H-1B, and while the new fee only applies to new applications, he believes it’s too high for many startups and will price them out of hiring internationally.</p>\n<p>The H-1B <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://techcrunch.com/2025/09/20/trump-hits-h-1b-visas-with-100000-fee-targeting-the-program-that-launched-elon-musk-and-instagram/\">visa was created to allow companies to hire skilled talent</a> from a worldwide market for such occupations as IT and engineering. On Friday, Trump announced that the fee hike, typically paid by the employer, would increase from $2,000-$5,000 to $100,000 per application, a change that will especially be felt with the new batch of visas available in March. </p>\n<p>Immigration is a key issue for President Trump, who, even dating back to his 2016 campaign run, accused companies of using the H-1B to take jobs from U.S. citizens.  </p>\n<p>Critics of the fee hike note that this visa helped bring in people who have gone on to start or run multibillion-dollar companies. Former holders include Google’s Sundar Pichai, Microsoft’s Satya Nadella, and Elon Musk. The visa has been more accessible than the O-1 visa for extraordinary ability, and quicker to obtain than a green card. </p>\n<p>“The impact will be severe on the competitiveness and innovation of smaller startups compared to the hyperscales, the big businesses,” Awadallah said. While Big Tech can more easily afford such fees, he feels that startups will miss out. Pricing startups out, he said, “will impact innovation in very, very negative ways longer term.” </p>\n<div>\n\t\t<p>Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t<p><span>San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>October 27-29, 2025</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n<h2 id=\"h-could-cost-the-tech-industry-5-5-billion-a-year\">Could cost the tech industry $5.5 billion a year</h2>\n<p>More than 700,000 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/sep/22/trump-h1b-visa-fee-explainer\" target=\"_blank\">people live in the U.S. on an H-1B</a>, and they’ve brought with them more than 500,000 dependents, such as spouses (who are permitted to work under this visa) and children, according to the immigration and criminal justice advocacy group fwd.us.

Previously, the total cost of hiring these workers fell between $200 million and $400 million, but under the new fee, it would cost the tech industry $5.5 billion a year to hire H-1B tech workers. </p>\n<p>Under the proposed changes, the minimum salary employers must pay an H-1B recipient will also increase, a change touted to help prevent the undercutting of U.S. citizen worker salaries.</p>\n<p>But many questions still loom. For instance, Sophie Alcorn, an immigration lawyer who works with startups, said it’s unclear whether the $100,000 would be returned to the payer if an application is denied. As the price hike technically went into effect on Friday, it’s also unclear if visa petitions currently under review are subject to it.</p>\n<p>“This is forcing us to pause, hopefully temporarily, numerous H-1B petitions for aspiring founders,” she said. “We’re waiting for more guidance.” </p>\n<h2 id=\"h-this-makes-me-kind-of-sad\">“This makes me kind of sad”</h2>\n<p>Silicon Valley founders say they look worldwide because there is a <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/09/24/billionaire-vc-mike-moritz-slams-new-h-1b-visa-fee-as-brutish-extortion-scheme/\">shortage of technical talent in the U.S.</a>, especially for skills like AI engineering. </p>\n<p>Brian Sathianathan, co-founder and CTO of the AI company Iterate, has a handful of employees on the visa and credits the visa for his previous successful startup exit.</p>\n<p>“My last company I co-founded and sold, my co-founder was on an H-1B visa. My head of engineering was on an H-1B visa,” Sathianathan said. With such high fees for the visa application, that “would not have been possible.” </p>\n<p>Other founders warn that the fee sends a signal that foreign talent might not be welcomed.  </p>\n<figure><blockquote><p>The impact will be severe on the competitiveness and innovation of smaller startups compared to the hyperscales, the big businesses.</p></blockquote></figure>\n<p>Hemant Mohapatra, an India-based partner at Lightspeed Venture Partners, was on an H-1B for around 15 years. He said expensive barriers for tech-worker visas could leave <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/0f84298c-4d27-4f23-80d4-2bce6a4c9282\">an innovation gap in the U.S. startup ecosystem</a> because a large percentage of unicorns and decacorns are actually founded by immigrants.</p>\n<p>Many times, he said, people brought to the U.S. on an H-1B visa later go on to start their own U.S. companies. Sometimes, their children grow up to be founders, too.</p>\n<p>That’s the experience of Jeffrey Wang, the co-founder of AI company Exa.ai. While a few of his workers obtained H-1B visas from a previous employer, Wang’s parents immigrated to the U.S. as H-1B recipients.</p>\n<p>“I heard the news and was like this makes me kind of sad,” he told TechCrunch. “I feel like people like my parents wouldn’t be able to come to America anymore.” </p>\n<p>The Trump administration said the visa change was to protect national interests, but Wang believes bringing the best talent to the U.S. helps with the nation’s security. As a nation of immigrants, nearly every important engineering or scientific achievement in the U.S. has involved immigrants, he said. </p>\n<h2 id=\"h-startups-explore-their-options\">Startups explore their options</h2>\n<p>U.S. startups are now scrambling. Some want exceptions carved out for startups. The administration said exemptions were possible in cases of national interest. </p>\n<p>Meanwhile, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.casium.com/\">Casium</a>, a <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.casium.com/\">business immigration</a> service provider, told TechCrunch it’s seen a more than 50% increase in early-stage founders looking at O-1 visas (though spouses can’t work on this visa). Later-stage companies are looking at the EB-1A visa, typically given to those at the top of their fields, and spouses are permitted to work. </p>\n<figure><blockquote><p>I feel like people like my parents wouldn’t be able to come to America anymore.</p></blockquote></figure>\n<blockquote>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Jack Thorogood, the CEO and founder of payroll company Native Teams, said his company has tracked a 50% increase in U.S. companies exploring visa-free global hiring options, like international remote work.</p>\n<p>Native Teams, which works with over 3,000 companies in 85 countries, said that one H-1B hire will now equal up to 20 remote hires in many other countries. </p>\n<p>He believes U.S. startups will just start outsourcing talent or keeping their workers abroad. “It wouldn’t be any more expensive to have talent overseas anyway,” Thorogood said. </p>\n<p>Markets like Canada, Germany, and the U.K. are already burgeoning tech hubs serving as landing spots for companies opening international offices. </p>\n<p>“If the U.S. is raising barriers, the U.K. and others should adapt accordingly to harness the amazing talent that exists from all corners of the world,” Oliver Kent-Braham, CEO and co-founder of the U.K.-based unicorn Marshmallow, told TechCrunch. </p>\n<p>Canadian Daniel Wigdor, founder of an AI venture studio and professor at the University of Toronto, agreed that the visa fee change wasn’t a good step for the U.S.</p>\n<p>“Instead of competing for the world’s best, they’re testing how much companies will pay to import them,” he said. “That stance might play domestically, but it risks undercutting America’s global tech dominance.”</p>\n<p><em>This piece was updated to reflect the proper title of Daniel Wigdor</em> <em>and the spelling of Casium’s name. </em></p>\n</div>"

    "body": "<div>\n<p>Amazon has agreed to pay $2.5 billion to settle a lawsuit from the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) over allegations that it duped users into paying for Prime subscriptions and made it hard to cancel memberships.</p>\n<p>The company will be required to pay a $1 billion civil penalty and provide $1.5 billion in refunds to an estimated 35 million consumers harmed by the company’s “deceptive Prime enrollment practices,” the FTC says. Amazon is also required to stop its “unlawful enrollment and cancellation practices.”</p>\n<p>The suit, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2023/06/21/ftc-sues-amazon-over-deceptive-tactics-used-to-sign-up-customers-for-prime/\">filed in June 2023</a> under the Biden administration, claimed that Amazon created confusing and deceptive user interfaces to lead consumers to enroll in Prime without their knowledge. It also created a complex process for consumers looking to cancel their subscription by making them go through unnecessary steps, the FTC alleged.</p>\n<p>The settlement comes as Amazon and the FTC had just begun the trial this week, during which a jury was supposed to decide the outcome.</p>\n<p>“The evidence showed that Amazon used sophisticated subscription traps designed to manipulate consumers into enrolling in Prime, and then made it exceedingly hard for consumers to end their subscription,” said FTC Chairman Andrew N. Ferguson in a press release. “Today, we are putting billions of dollars back into Americans’ pockets, and making sure Amazon never does this again.”</p>\n<p>As part of the settlement, Amazon is required to include a clear button for customers to decline signing up for Prime. This means that the company can no longer have a button that says “No, I don’t want free shipping.”</p>\n<p>Amazon must also clearly disclose the subscription cost during the enrollment process, along with the billing date and frequency, whether the subscription auto-renews, and the procedure for cancellation. Additionally, the company is required to create an easy way for consumers to cancel Prime, using the same method that consumers used to sign up for the service.</p>\n<div>\n\t\t<p>Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t<p><span>San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>October 27-29, 2025</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n<p>“Amazon and our executives have always followed the law and this settlement allows us to move forward and focus on innovating for customers,” Amazon said in a statement. “We work incredibly hard to make it clear and simple for customers to both sign up or cancel their Prime membership, and to offer substantial value for our many millions of loyal Prime members around the world. We will continue to do so, and look forward to what we’ll deliver for Prime members in the coming years.”</p>\n<p>The settlement is one of the largest in the FTC’s history. In 2019, Facebook (now Meta) <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2019/07/24/facebook-settles-with-ftc-5-billion-and-new-privacy-guarantees/\">reached a $5 billion settlement</a> with the agency for violating consumers’ privacy.</p>\n<p>It’s worth noting that Amazon still faces another federal lawsuit, in which the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2023/09/26/the-ftc-just-hit-amazon-with-a-major-antitrust-lawsuit/\">FTC has accused the company of illegally stifling competition</a> on its way to becoming a ubiquitous retail presence and one of the world’s most valuable companies. </p>\n</div><div>\n<div>\n\t\t<p>Aisha is a consumer news reporter at TechCrunch.

Features like ChatGPT Agent or <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/05/16/openai-launches-codex-an-ai-coding-agent-in-chatgpt/\">Codex</a> aim to make ChatGPT feel more like an assistant rather than a chatbot. With Pulse, OpenAI seemingly wants ChatGPT to be more proactive.</p>\n<p>“We’re building AI that lets us take the level of support that only the wealthiest have been able to afford and make it available to everyone over time,” said OpenAI’s new CEO of Applications, Fidji Simo, in a blog post. “And ChatGPT Pulse is the first step in that direction — starting with Pro users today, but with the goal of rolling out this intelligence to all.”</p>\n<p>OpenAI CEO Sam Altman <a href=\"https://x.com/sama/status/1969835407421374910\" target=\"_blank\">said</a> earlier this week that some of ChatGPT’s new “compute-intensive” products would be limited to the company’s most expensive subscription plan — which is the case for Pulse. OpenAI has previously said it’s <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/02/27/openai-ceo-sam-altman-says-the-company-is-out-of-gpus/\">severely limited</a> in the number of servers it has to power ChatGPT, and it’s rapidly building out <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/09/23/openai-is-building-five-new-stargate-data-centers-with-oracle-and-softbank/\">AI data centers</a> with partners like Oracle and SoftBank to increase its capacity.</p>\n<p>Starting Thursday, OpenAI will roll out Pulse for subscribers to its $200-a-month Pro plan, for whom it will appear as a new tab in the ChatGPT app. The company says it would like to launch Pulse to all ChatGPT users in the future, with Plus subscribers to get access soon, but it first needs to make the product more efficient.</p>\n<p>Pulse’s reports can be roundups of news articles on a specific topic — like updates on a specific sports team — as well as more personalized briefs based on a user’s context.</p>\n<p>In a demo for TechCrunch, OpenAI product lead Adam Fry showed several reports Pulse had made for him: a roundup of news about British soccer team Arsenal; group Halloween costume suggestions for his wife and kids; and a toddler-friendly travel itinerary for his family’s upcoming trip to Sedona, Arizona.</p>\n<div>\n\t\t<p>Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t<p><span>San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>October 27-29, 2025</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n<figure><img src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/ChatGPT-Pulse-examples.png?w=680\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/ChatGPT-Pulse-examples.png 1452w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/ChatGPT-Pulse-examples.png?resize=150,44 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/ChatGPT-Pulse-examples.png?resize=300,88 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/ChatGPT-Pulse-examples.png?resize=768,225 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/ChatGPT-Pulse-examples.png?resize=680,200 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/ChatGPT-Pulse-examples.png?resize=1200,352 1200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/ChatGPT-Pulse-examples.png?resize=1280,376 1280w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/ChatGPT-Pulse-examples.png?resize=430,126 430w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/ChatGPT-Pulse-examples.png?resize=720,211 720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/ChatGPT-Pulse-examples.png?resize=900,264 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/ChatGPT-Pulse-examples.png?resize=800,235 800w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/ChatGPT-Pulse-examples.png?resize=668,196 668w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/ChatGPT-Pulse-examples.png?resize=1440,422 1440w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/ChatGPT-Pulse-examples.png?resize=708,208 708w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/ChatGPT-Pulse-examples.png?resize=50,15 50w\" /><figcaption><span>An example of Pulse’s cards and reports.</span><span><strong>Image Credits:</strong>OpenAI</span></figcaption></figure>\n<p>Each report is displayed as a “card” featuring AI-generated images and text. Users can click on each one to get the full report and can then query ChatGPT about the contents. Pulse will proactively generate some reports, but users can also ask Pulse for new automated reports or offer feedback on existing ones.</p>\n<p>A core part of Pulse is that it stops after generating a few reports and shows a message: “Great, that’s it for today.” According to Fry, that’s an intentional design choice to make the service different from engagement-optimized social media apps. </p>\n<p>Pulse is compatible with <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/06/04/chatgpt-introduces-meeting-recording-and-connectors-for-google-drive-box-and-more/\">ChatGPT’s Connectors</a>, so users can connect apps like Google Calendar and Gmail. Once that’s set up, Pulse will parse through your email overnight to surface the most important messages in the morning, or access your calendar to generate an agenda for upcoming events.</p>\n<p>If users have ChatGPT’s <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/04/18/chatgpt-will-now-use-its-memory-to-personalize-web-searches/\">memory features</a> turned on, Pulse will also pull in context from previous chats to improve your reports. OpenAI’s personalization lead, Christina Wadsworth Kaplan, gave an example of how Pulse automatically picked up on her love of running to create an itinerary for her upcoming trip to London that included running routes.</p>\n<p>Wadsworth Kaplan described Pulse as a “net-new functionality” for a consumer product. As a pescatarian, she says Pulse takes dinner reservations on her calendar and finds menu items that work with her diet.</p>\n<p>But it’s hard to overlook how Pulse could compete with existing news products, such as Apple News, paid newsletters, or traditional journalism outlets. Fry doesn’t expect Pulse to replace the various news apps people use, and the feature cites its sources with links in the same way ChatGPT Search does.</p>\n<p>It remains to be seen if Pulse is worth the computational power it requires to work. Fry says the service can “vary tremendously” in how much computing power it spends on a given task — for some projects, it’s fairly efficient, but others may require searching the web and synthesizing lots of documents.</p>\n<p>Eventually, OpenAI would like to make Pulse more agentic, to the point where it could make restaurant reservations on a user’s behalf, or draft emails that users could approve to be sent. But such features may be a long way out and would likely require OpenAI’s agentic models to improve a great deal before users would trust it with such decisions.</p>\n</div><div>\n<div>\n\t\t<p>Maxwell Zeff is a senior reporter at TechCrunch specializing in AI.

    "body": "<div>\n<p>Food supply chains are notoriously messy. Orders arrive through different channels, staff spend hours manually entering them into clunky enterprise software systems, and compliance often depends on spreadsheets.</p>\n<p>For decades, software vendors have tried, with mixed success, to modernize the workflows behind the global movement of perishable goods.</p>\n<p>Now, a Y Combinator startup called <a href=\"https://www.getburnt.ai/about\" target=\"_blank\">Burnt</a> thinks AI agents — software that can automatically handle tasks typically done by humans — can succeed where traditional enterprise software hasn’t in the <a href=\"http://www.ers.usda.gov/topics/food-markets-prices/food-service-industry/market-segments\" target=\"_blank\">trillion-dollar U.S. food market</a>.</p>\n<p>The company, which automates back-office supply chain tasks with AI, has raised $3.8 million in seed funding led by Penny Jar Capital, the venture firm backed by NBA star Steph Curry, with participation from Scribble Ventures, Formation VC, and angel investors, including Dan Scheinman.</p>\n<p>Burnt co-founder and CEO <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/josephjacob93\" target=\"_blank\">Joseph Jacob</a> grew up around food factories. He says his great-grandfather was the first to export shrimp from India to the U.S. in the 1930s. Since then, each generation of his family has worked somewhere along the seafood supply chain, including farming, processing, exporting, and importing.</p>\n<p>Jacob moved to India during his formative years and, after college, worked on the factory floor of a shrimp processor in a rural area. The experience introduced him to the intricacies of the food and restaurant business.</p>\n<p>When he returned to the U.S. and began managing large volumes of seafood imports, he noticed major inefficiencies.</p>\n<div>\n\t\t<p>Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t<p><span>San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>October 27-29, 2025</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n<p>“I ended up buying hundreds of millions of pounds of seafood, but everything was tracked on Excel sheets and a 20-year-old ERP system,” Jacob told TechCrunch. “In a business with razor-thin margins, it’s nearly impossible to succeed without good supply chain management. We went through multiple software implementations, but two rollouts failed. That’s when I realized I wanted to build software for this industry, not just work in it.”</p>\n<p>Jacob’s experience isn’t an isolated one. Enterprise vendors have long tried to sell distributors on large rollouts that drag on for years, cost millions, and frustrate the small and mid-sized players that dominate the market. </p>\n<p>After two decades of missed software adoption in the industry, Jacob believes<strong> </strong>Burnt’s approach of layering AI agents on top of existing systems rather than replacing them represents a massive opportunity.</p>\n<p>“Everyone we talk to calls their ERP a necessary evil,” said the chief executive. “Traditional software forced teams to rip out old processes and adopt new ones. With AI, you don’t need to change the process; you just get the work done.”</p>\n<p>Here’s how things tend to work today: Sales reps at food distributors receive orders via email, phone calls, WhatsApp, voicemails, texts, and even faxes. Each order then has to be keyed in manually. While critical, the process eats up hours that could be spent on higher-value work like winning new customers or upselling existing ones.</p>\n<p>Burnt’s first agent, Ozai, automates and manages this order-entry process. In fact, Jacob claims it can handle up to 80% of workflows that are currently stuck in legacy systems.</p>\n<p>Since launching in January, the startup has processed more than $10 million in monthly orders across seafood, specialty goods, and packaged food distributors. One of the U.K.’s largest food conglomerates, with billions in revenue, is currently implementing Burnt’s system. The company is already generating six-figure revenue and growing “steadily” month-on-month, though Jacob declined to share exact numbers.</p>\n<p>While building AI for food supply chains may sound unglamorous, Jacob says that’s the point. He argues that decades of failed tech rollouts have left operators skeptical of “tech tourists” with no industry experience. </p>\n<p>His background, as well as that of his co-founders, has helped Burnt gain trust in a sector where relationships matter. Chief Product Officer <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/rheakarimpanal/\" target=\"_blank\">Rhea Karimpanal </a>— Jacob’s childhood friend and now wife — comes from a family that ran restaurants, while CTO <a href=\"https://linkedin.com/in/chandrushanmugasundaram\" target=\"_blank\">Chandru Shanmugasundaram</a> built software systems for restaurant applications.</p>\n<p>Jacob previously worked at Rekki, a Benchmark-backed B2B marketplace for restaurants and suppliers, where he saw firsthand how brittle supply chain tech could be and how AI might transform it.</p>\n<p>Still, winning investors wasn’t straightforward. AI agents may be hot, but convincing VCs to back one for food distributors required a different pitch. Many lacked conviction in the market despite its size, he said. </p>\n<p>That’s where Curry’s Penny Jar Capital came in. The firm’s thesis is centered on backing founders who are building in “overlooked” industries where tech adoption lags. </p>\n<p>“Two decades of missed software adoption is a massive opportunity. Investors who understand this know it can be huge if executed right,” Jacob said.</p>\n</div>"
