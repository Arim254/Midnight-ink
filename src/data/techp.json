The company launched its <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/08/18/openai-launches-a-sub-5-chatgpt-plan-in-india/\">sub-$5 ChatGPT Go paid plan</a> for the country’s users last month and now is rolling out the same plan in Indonesia for Rp75,000 ($4.50) per month.</p>\n<p>The ChatGPT Go plan is a mid-tier subscription option that sits between OpenAI’s free version and its premium $20-per-month ChatGPT Plus plan. Users get 10 times higher usage limits than the free plan for sending questions or prompts, generating images, and uploading files. The plan also allows ChatGPT to remember previous conversations better, enabling more personalized responses over time, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://x.com/nickaturley/status/1970327855038111948\">ChatGPT head Nick Turley said</a> on X.</p>\n<p>Turley said that since the company launched the ChatGPT Go plan in India, paid subscribers have more than doubled.</p>\n<p>This move puts OpenAI in direct competition with Google, which launched its own <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://x.com/GeminiApp/status/1965490977000640833\">similarly-priced AI Plus subscription plan</a> in Indonesia earlier this month. Google’s AI Plus plan gives users access to its Gemini 2.5 Pro chatbot, along with creative tools for image and video creation like Flow, Whisk, and Veo 3 Fast. The plan also includes enhanced features for Google’s AI research assistant NotebookLM and integrates AI capabilities into Gmail, Docs, and Sheets, along with 200GB of cloud storage.<br /></p>\n</div>\n<div>\n\t<p>Topics</p>\n</div>\n</div><div><div>\n\t<div>\n\t\t<p>Subscribe for the industry’s biggest tech news</p>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n<p></p><h2 id=\"h-latest-in\">Latest in AI</h2><p></p>\n</div>"

    "description": "Australia-based Alloy thinks it can help robotics firms with their data problem: The startup is building data infrastructure to help companies process and organize all the data their robots collect.",
    "body": "<div>\n<p>Robotics companies often have to deal with a simple but confounding problem: Robots produce a lot of data. Even a simple robot can easily produce up to a terabyte of data per day, since they continuously capture data from cameras and sensors.</p>\n<p>Sydney, Australia-based <a href=\"https://www.usealloy.ai/\" target=\"_blank\">Alloy</a> thinks it can help with that issue: The startup is building data infrastructure for robotics companies to help them process and organize all the data their robots collect from various sources, including sensors and cameras.  </p>\n<p>At its core, Alloy encodes and labels the data it collects, and allows users to search through their data using natural language to find bugs and errors. Users can also set up rules to catch and flag issues in the future, similar to how observability tools flag errors in software code.  </p>\n<p>“The current pattern is, you look for some kind of anomaly, and then you’ll replay the data,” Joe Harris, the founder and CEO of Alloy, told TechCrunch. “They then are spending hours scrubbing through this data, looking for these issues that have been flagged to them, trying to diagnose from that [while] not really having a good view as to whether this has happened before, if it’s a high-severity issue or this one-off, edge case.” </p>\n<p>Considering how much data a single robot produces, as robotics companies look to scale, this data problem will continue to compound, Harris added.  </p>\n<p>Harris has been fascinated by robotics since he was a kid. But when he graduated from college in 2018, there <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/09/12/we-are-entering-a-golden-age-of-robotics-startups-and-not-just-because-of-ai/\" target=\"_blank\">weren’t many opportunities to work in the field</a>, so he instead worked multiple roles across Australian tech companies including Atlassian and telehealth startup Eucalyptus.  </p>\n<p>In 2024, he decided the time was right to launch a robotics company of his own. He originally thought he’d focus on building robots for the agriculture industry due to an interest in vertical farming, but when he started talking to other founders, the issue of managing the data robots produce kept coming up. He figured he might as well solve that problem first.  </p>\n<div>\n\t\t<p>Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t<p><span>San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>October 27-29, 2025</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n<p>“If I need to solve this problem for myself and my robotics company, I will have a great horizontal solution,” Harris said. “Perhaps that would be a more important near-term mission — to help enable other robotics companies to spend less time on data plumbing and more time on getting to that high reliability.” </p>\n<p>Since its launch in February 2025, Alloy has signed four Australian robotics companies as design partners and looks to push into the U.S. market this year.  </p>\n<p>“The customers that we found have been most excited about this because they’ve gone through the pain of building and maintaining it themselves,” Harris said. “They’d much rather have a fantastic tool, like a Databricks just specifically built for robotics.” </p>\n<p>Alloy has also raised a little more than AUD $4.5 million (about $3 million USD) in a pre-seed round that was led by Blackbird Ventures, with participation from Airtree Ventures, Xtal Ventures, and Skip Capital, in addition to angel investors from robotics companies.  </p>\n<p>The company doesn’t have too many direct competitors yet. Many robotics companies are either retrofitting existing data management tools that aren’t designed for the multimodal data robots produce, or are attempting to build their own internal data management tools.  </p>\n<p>As commercial use cases for robotics continue to increase, Alloy hopes it will be able to capture a good share of the growing market.  </p>\n<p>“It’s never been a better time to build a robotics company,” Harris said. “I really want to make it possible for the next 10,000, 100,000 robotics companies that don’t yet exist, that inevitably will not have to necessarily reinvent the wheel, like every company has.” </p>\n</div><div>\n<div>\n\t\t<p>Becca is a senior writer at TechCrunch that covers venture capital trends and startups.

The market is young, and vibe coding apps continue to improve and work out the bugs. </p>\n<p>New apps in this space are arriving all the time, too. This year, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/vibe-coding-startup-vibecode-helps-build-apps-on-iphone-fundraise-2025-8\">a startup called Vibecode launched with $9.4 million in seed funding</a> from Reddit co-founder Alexis Ohanian’s Seven Seven Six. The company’s service allows users to create mobile apps using AI within its own iOS app. Vibecode is so  new, Appfigures doesn’t yet have data on it.</p>\n<p>For now, most people who want to toy around with vibe coding technology are doing so on the desktop. But vibe coding does have another presence on mobile devices: it’s powering a growing number of existing mobile apps.</p>\n<p>For instance, the subscription platform provider <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://revenuecat.com/\">RevenueCat</a>, now used by over 50,000 apps, reports that it powers the in-app purchases for over 50% of all AI-built iOS apps currently on the market.</p>\n<p>The company told TechCrunch that the share of apps that came to RevenueCat for monetization from an AI assistant or platform — meaning an AI chatbot referred its service to the customer — surged to over 35% of all new signups in the second quarter of this year, up from below 5% in the second quarter of last year.</p>\n<p>The platform, which is already used by nearly 50% of all mobile apps that take payments, notes that vibe coders are using its service to automatically configure their subscriptions with Cursor, Claude Code, and others, via its RevenueCat MCP server, allowing them to quickly create subscriptions and test plans and features.</p>\n<p>Although there’s certainly interest in vibe coding, the consensus is that it’s not ready for prime time. </p>\n<p>TechCrunch recently spoke with <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/09/14/vibe-coding-has-turned-senior-devs-into-ai-babysitters-but-they-say-its-worth-it/\">developers working with AI-generated code</a>, who said the technology still has a long way to go. A separate <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.fastly.com/blog/senior-developers-ship-more-ai-code\">survey from Fastly</a> found that roughly 95% of the nearly 800 developers surveyed said they had to spend extra time fixing AI-generated code.</p>\n<p>Still, user demand is there. A <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://survey.stackoverflow.co/2025/ai\">2025 survey</a> by Stack Overflow found that 84% of respondents are using or planning to use AI tools in their development process, up from 76% last year. Another <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.theinformation.com/articles/information-survey-nearly-75-respondents-vibe-coding-like-results\">survey</a> conducted this summer by the tech media site The Information found that 75% of respondents were at least trying vibe coding.

    "body": "<div>\n<p>Tim Chen, solo VC at his firm Essence VC, said he just closed his fourth fund, a fresh $41 million, without even trying. Limited partner investors were so eager to invest, they preempted it, he told TechCrunch. He didn’t even have time to generate a pitch deck. </p>\n<p>A $41 million raise might not sound like much in this age of multibillion-dollar venture firms and solo VCs like Jack Altman (who <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/09/16/jack-altman-raised-a-new-275m-early-stage-fund-in-a-mere-week/\" target=\"_blank\">just raised his second giant fund, at $275 million</a>). But that’s mainly because Chen didn’t want to take on more. It’s an upsize from Chen’s 2022 third fund of $27 million (which was up from his $5 million second and $1 million first fund). </p>\n<p>Chen hadn’t begun new fundraising activity because, until last month, he was still investing out of his third fund, which has now wrapped. But limited partner investors had begun whispering about him amongst themselves after one of his portfolio companies from his second round, Tabular, was acquired by <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/08/14/databricks-reportedly-paid-2-billion-in-tabular-acquisition/\" target=\"_blank\">Databricks for about $2.2 billion in 2024.</a> </p>\n<p>“That basically, pretty much returned our whole fund,” Chen told TechCrunch, and put him “on the map,” as he described. Suddenly, LPs were hearing his name everywhere: on cap tables, mentioned by other VCs, founders quoting his advice. They wanted in. </p>\n<p>In part, that’s because Chen specializes in developer-tool and infrastructure startups at the earliest stages, a segment growing in popularity in this age of AI. </p>\n<p>Chen cut his teeth as a software engineer, earning street cred from his time as one of the earliest employees at <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2019/08/05/mesosphere-changes-name-to-d2iq-shifts-focus-to-kubernetes-cloud-native/\" target=\"_blank\">Mesophere</a>, a one-time hot open source cloud infrastructure startup backed by Hewlett Packard Enterprise and Microsoft; then he co-founded an “AIops” startup called Hyperpilot and sold it in an acqui-hire to Cloudera in 2018.  </p>\n<p>In 2019, Chen began angel investing and discovered he had a knack for it, backing other deeply technical startups like Jasper, Flatfile, and MotherDuck. “I really enjoyed it. Founders kept loving me, kept telling all their friends.”  </p>\n<div>\n\t\t<p>Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t<p><span>San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>October 27-29, 2025</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n<p>Looking for a new career, he thought venture was it, so he interviewed at several of the big Sand Hill Road firms, only to be rejected by them all.</p>\n<p>“No one wanted to hire me,” he said. “I’m an engineer and small-exit founder. I don’t think that’s a typical profile.” </p>\n<p>Jake Zeller, a friend of his who worked at AngelList (and is now out at his own fund), told Chen not to give up and talked him into launching his own fund on that platform. </p>\n<p>“He told me, ‘Tim, I think you could go raise a $1 million Fund 1 and try it out.’ I said, ‘Wow. I didn’t know that was possible.’ So he gave me a pitch deck template,” Chen recalled, and through introductions, Chen landed LPs like Bain Capital. </p>\n<p>Famed infrastructure and AI investor Martin Casado of Andreessen Horowitz came in as an LP in later funds. And then <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/podcast/heres-why-seed-fund-investor-michael-kim-of-cendana-capital-says-last-year-was-among-his-most-liquid/\" target=\"_blank\">long-time fund-to-fund investor Michael Kim of Cendana Capital</a> invested. After Tabular sold, Kim told him that Cendana had already reserved $15 million for his fourth fund. Chen was shocked.  </p>\n<p>He was also getting calls from others, some who were previous investors like Sapphire, General Catalyst, and new individuals. “I wasn’t fundraising. I didn’t know how much to raise at all. I was just like deploying and vibing,” he said. </p>\n<p>When StepStone pushed him to send LP documents so they could wire the money — and wanted to bring others in — he opted to get his act together and do the fund immediately. AngelList basically did his fundraising documents for him. He settled on a reasonable bump from his last fund, moving cautiously because he still considers himself a beginner at venture.</p>\n<p>Fund IV backers wound up including names like Tomasz Tunguz (former Redpoint partner, now of Theory Ventures ) and Ethan Kurzweil (formerly Bessemer partner, now of Chemistry VC).  </p>\n<p>He credits his growing reputation to his background as an infrastructure engineer. “There’s so few VCs that look like me,” referring to his deeply technical background with software infrastructure.</p>\n<p>While that wasn’t appealing for the big firms, it’s been a boon for his solo investing. Rather than a typical VC focus on traction and sales funnel, Chen helps early founders figure out how to build their products. </p>\n<p>For instance, he invested in a company called <a href=\"https://www.comfy.org/\" target=\"_blank\">ComfyUI </a>which was, at the time, working on a consumer visual AI product based on the open source Stable Diffusion model. After investing, Chen advised the founders to become a developer platform of the models they were fine-tuning.  </p>\n<p>Comfy-org <a href=\"https://blog.comfy.org/p/comfy-raises-17m-funding\" target=\"_blank\">just raised a $17 million Series A</a> to compete with the big closed source model makers. And their blog post publicly thanks Chen for helping them craft their strategy. </p>\n</div>"

    "body": "<div>\n<p>For Julien Emery, the problem has always been personal. </p>\n<p>He’s the CEO and co-founder of Superpanel, a platform that helps law firms seamlessly onboard new clients. </p>\n<p>He listed emotional encounters with the law: As a Canadian, he found access to legal help hard and expensive; he also recalls his mother in a car accident, and how the legal payout helped keep his family afloat for years. He found the legal intake — the process of a firm evaluating a new client or request — tedious. </p>\n<p>“For consumers, it’s a maze of forms, phone calls, and dropped leads that cause most people to give up before getting help,” he told TechCrunch. “For firms, it’s a costly, error-prone bottleneck.” </p>\n<p>Before the recent advancements in artificial intelligence, he said that the intake process was regarded as too complex for automation. But that’s changed. Emery worked at Hootsuite, then founded the health insurance underwriting platform Allay (which exited to Novo Benefits), before teaming up with his friend Dingyu Zhang, who had a background in AI, to launch Superpanel in 2024. </p>\n<p>Superpanel automates half the work of legal intake, Emery said, managing collection and feedback. It provides plaintiff law firms with a “digital teammate” that helps with escalation and compliance. “It engages clients across phone, texting, email, and forums, guiding them through their story and sharing documents,” he continued. For firms, it helps sort case type, jurisdiction, and documentation.</p>\n<p>“When there’s risk of ambiguity, the system escalates to a human team member,” he said. “The result is a unified, multi-channel workflow that delivers measurable results and gives firms a system they can trust like a real employee.” </p>\n<div>\n\t\t<p>Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t<p><span>San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>October 27-29, 2025</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n<p>The company announced Tuesday a seed $5.3 million raise in a round co-led by Outlander VC and Field Ventures. Emery said he met some investors in this round through his last startup, and those early investors introduced him to the ones who led the round for this new one. Others in this round include LOI Venture (co-founded by the founder of Hootsuite), Zenda Capital, 8-Bit Capital, and Behind Genius Ventures. </p>\n<p>“We’ll use the funding to accelerate hiring and expand Superpanel’s capabilities for plaintiff law firms,” he said. </p>\n<p>Legal is one of the top industries seeing transformation as artificial intelligence continues to innovate. So Superpanel certainly isn’t alone in this space, and its competitors include Clio Grow, LegalClerk.ai, MyCase, and Whippy.ai. </p>\n<p>But Emery is hoping Superpanel will stand out from the pack. “Consumers now expect answers and solutions to be instant and self-serve, shaped by AI tools and the online experiences they use every day,” Emery said.  “Superpanel guides them continuously across that journey.”</p>\n</div><div>\n<div>\n\t\t<p>Dominic-Madori Davis is a senior venture capital and startup reporter at TechCrunch.

The startup said on Tuesday that it had raised $4.6 million in funding from Conviction, Genius Ventures, Figma CEO Dylan Field, and Google Research’s chief scientist, Jeff Dean.</p>\n<p>The app launched on an invite-only basis in June, and is now available to everyone on <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://apps.apple.com/us/app/huxe/id6743417504\">iOS</a> and <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.huxe.android.apps.huxe&hl=en_IN\">Android</a>.</p>\n<p>Raiza Martin, along with Jason Spielman and Stephen Hughes, left Google in December 2024 to explore their own ideas. They initially launched a chatbot slanted towards more B2B use cases, but decided to focus on the consumer market and built a personal assistant in March 2025 that could generate personalized images, videos, and audio.</p>\n<figure><img src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/DailyBrief.jpeg?w=680\" alt=\"A pair of screenshot showing audio app Huxe's home screen where you can go through different news briefs and deepdive podcasts generated by AI.\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/DailyBrief.jpeg 2190w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/DailyBrief.jpeg?resize=150,131 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/DailyBrief.jpeg?resize=300,262 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/DailyBrief.jpeg?resize=768,671 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/DailyBrief.jpeg?resize=680,594 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/DailyBrief.jpeg?resize=1200,1049 1200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/DailyBrief.jpeg?resize=1280,1119 1280w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/DailyBrief.jpeg?resize=430,376 430w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/DailyBrief.jpeg?resize=720,629 720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/DailyBrief.jpeg?resize=900,787 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/DailyBrief.jpeg?resize=800,699 800w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/DailyBrief.jpeg?resize=1536,1342 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/DailyBrief.jpeg?resize=2048,1790 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/DailyBrief.jpeg?resize=668,584 668w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/DailyBrief.jpeg?resize=429,375 429w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/DailyBrief.jpeg?resize=706,617 706w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/DailyBrief.jpeg?resize=608,531 608w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/DailyBrief.jpeg?resize=50,44 50w\" /><figcaption><span>Image Credits: Huxe</span></figcaption></figure>\n<p>“During this phase, we realized that people liked having the ability to generate audio for different topics. We also observed that people often used the app at specific times to get their daily brief or catch up with news while getting ready,” Martin told TechCrunch.</p>\n<p>That insight led the three to lean into audio and build <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.huxe.com/\">Huxe</a>.</p>\n<p>Huxe essentially gives you a daily briefing based on the emails you receive and by connecting to your calendars to understand your schedule. It also lets you explore topics, and like NotebookLM, it will generate a podcast with AI hosts discussing the topic. You can interact with the AI hosts at any point in time, ask questions about the topic, or request them to explain points in a different way.</p>\n<div>\n\t\t<p>Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t<p><span>San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>October 27-29, 2025</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n<p>What’s different here is that Huxe lets users build a “live station” of any topic, like tech news, sports, or even celebrity gossip. After you listen to a station, the app will give you updates by tapping different sources — helpful for following developing news. There’s also a personalized interest feed, which automatically generates audio content that might interest you.</p>\n<figure><img src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/LiveStations-Overview.jpeg?w=680\" alt=\"A pair of screenshots showing Live Station feature on audio app Huxe.

People who might want to catch up on their email, schedule, and news can do that without looking at their screen,” she said.</p>\n<p>Huxe currently is suited to the information market, but entertainment can be a possible use case, too.

The Facebook-maker is investing “tens of millions” of dollars into a new super PAC to fight state-level tech policy proposals that could stifle AI advancement, reports <a href=\"https://www.axios.com/2025/09/23/meta-superpac-ai-regulation\" target=\"_blank\">Axios</a>.</p>\n<p>Meta’s pro-AI PAC, called the American Technology Excellence Project, is the company’s latest effort to combat policies it sees as harmful to the development of AI. Last month, <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/08/26/meta-to-spend-tens-of-millions-on-pro-ai-super-pac/\" target=\"_blank\">Meta launched a California-focused PAC</a> to back tech-friendly candidates in state races.</p>\n<p>Axios reports that Meta’s new super PAC will be run by Republican veteran Brian Baker and Democratic consulting firm Hilltop Public Solutions, and will work to elect tech-friendly politicians from both parties in next year’s midterm elections. Rachel Holland, a Meta spokesperson, told the outlet that the super PAC will focus on promoting and defending U.S. tech companies and leadership, advocating for AI progress, and putting parents in charge of how their children experience online apps and AI technologies.  </p>\n<p>The focus on parental control comes amid growing child safety concerns surrounding AI tools.

It is aiming to scale that to $20–$25 million by year’s end and $60–$70 million by June next year, co-founder and CEO Vishal Virani (pictured above, center) said in an exclusive interview.</p>\n<p>Based in Surat — a city famous for diamonds and textiles but far from India’s usual tech hubs — Virani teamed up with Rahul Shingala and Deepak Dhanak to launch Rocket.new. The startup marks a pivot from their earlier venture, DhiWise, which focused on developer workflows.</p>\n<p>“We are building the first vibe solution platform, which is not solving just a problem of day one, but what we are focusing on is solving the problem of day two,” Virani told TechCrunch.</p>\n<p>The 16-week-old startup aims to become a comprehensive agentic system, which will utilize AI not only to build apps and websites but also to conduct competitive research and product development, eliminating the need for product managers.</p>\n<p>“Our entire agentic system will help organizations build all kinds of functions around products — not just generating the source code — but even a facility to scale their product — all by giving natural-language prompts,” Virani asserted.</p>\n<div>\n\t\t<p>Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t<p><span>San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>October 27-29, 2025</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n<p>The current model, which Virani refers to as version 0.3, has already built half a million applications and attracted product managers, solopreneurs, and front-end developers. It also counts users from companies like Meta, PayPal, KPMG, PwC, and Times Internet, who turn to the platform for personal projects.</p>\n<figure><img src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/rocket-new-platform-screenshot.jpg\" alt=\"Rocket.new\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/rocket-new-platform-screenshot.jpg 1910w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/rocket-new-platform-screenshot.jpg?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/rocket-new-platform-screenshot.jpg?resize=300,168 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/rocket-new-platform-screenshot.jpg?resize=768,430 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/rocket-new-platform-screenshot.jpg?resize=680,381 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/rocket-new-platform-screenshot.jpg?resize=1200,672 1200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/rocket-new-platform-screenshot.jpg?resize=1280,717 1280w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/rocket-new-platform-screenshot.jpg?resize=430,241 430w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/rocket-new-platform-screenshot.jpg?resize=720,403 720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/rocket-new-platform-screenshot.jpg?resize=900,504 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/rocket-new-platform-screenshot.jpg?resize=800,448 800w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/rocket-new-platform-screenshot.jpg?resize=1536,860 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/rocket-new-platform-screenshot.jpg?resize=668,375 668w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/rocket-new-platform-screenshot.jpg?resize=1101,617 1101w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/rocket-new-platform-screenshot.jpg?resize=708,397 708w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/rocket-new-platform-screenshot.jpg?resize=50,28 50w\" /><figcaption><span><strong>Image Credits:</strong>Rocket.new</span></figcaption></figure>\n<p>About 80% of Rocket.new’s users have so far built what Virani calls “serious” applications rather than simple landing pages or branding sites. Roughly 12% have created e-commerce platforms in segments like grocery and apparel, 10% have built fintech apps, 5–6% have developed B2B tools, and 4–5% have launched mental health apps, he said.</p>\n<p>Roughly 45% of Rocket.new’s users are building mobile apps and 55% are building websites, Virani said.

    "body": "<div>\n<p>Sila, the battery materials startup, started operations Tuesday at its facility in Moses Lake, Washington, a milestone that could pave the way for longer range, faster charging EVs. The factory, which will initially be capable of making enough battery materials for 20,000 to 50,000 EVs, is the first large-scale silicon anode factory in the West, and future expansion could fulfill demand for as many as 2.5 million vehicles.</p>\n<p>Silicon anodes promise to improve the energy density of lithium-ion batteries by as much as 50%. The technology, which Sila has been working on for the past 14 years, could be the best chance for the U.S. to gain the upper hand in a global race for battery supremacy, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.silanano.com/\">Sila</a> co-founder and CEO <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2022/10/17/silas-gene-berdichevsky-on-the-5-year-roller-coaster-facing-battery-companies/\">Gene Berdichevsky</a> argues.</p>\n<p>“When you invent something new, it’s a lot easier to then produce it where you invent it,” he told TechCrunch.</p>\n<p>Sila currently has agreements to supply anode material to <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2023/12/11/sila-panasonic-deal/\">Panasonic</a> and <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2022/05/17/electric-mercedes-g-class-will-go-the-distance-with-silas-energy-dense-silicon-anodes/\">Mercedes</a>. Though automakers and their suppliers will be the factory’s main focus, Berdichevsky said his company has also been selling to drone manufacturers, satellite companies, and consumer electronics companies.</p>\n<p>The startup isn’t the only company working on silicon anode materials. <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/08/20/group14-lands-463m-from-sk-porsche-and-others-to-make-silicon-anodes-for-evs/\">Group14</a>, which also has operations in Moses Lake, currently produces its proprietary mix at a factory it developed with SK Innovation in South Korea. Amprius, a company based in Fremont, California, is currently producing megawatt-hours worth of its material in the U.S. and gigawatt-hours worth with partners in China.</p>\n<p>But Sila’s Moses Lake factory, which has been under construction for nearly two years, “is really the first auto scale silicon anode plant in the U.S.,” Berdichevsky said. The company <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/06/27/as-battery-startups-fail-sila-snaps-up-375m-in-new-funding/\">raised $375 million last year</a> to help finance the project.</p>\n<figure><img src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/sila-moses-lake-wide-view.jpeg?w=680\" alt=\"Sila's new factory sits amid farm fields in Moses Lake, Washington.\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/sila-moses-lake-wide-view.jpeg 3000w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/sila-moses-lake-wide-view.jpeg?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/sila-moses-lake-wide-view.jpeg?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/sila-moses-lake-wide-view.jpeg?resize=768,432 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/sila-moses-lake-wide-view.jpeg?resize=680,383 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/sila-moses-lake-wide-view.jpeg?resize=1200,675 1200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/sila-moses-lake-wide-view.jpeg?resize=1280,720 1280w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/sila-moses-lake-wide-view.jpeg?resize=430,242 430w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/sila-moses-lake-wide-view.jpeg?resize=720,405 720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/sila-moses-lake-wide-view.jpeg?resize=900,506 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/sila-moses-lake-wide-view.jpeg?resize=800,450 800w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/sila-moses-lake-wide-view.jpeg?resize=1536,864 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/sila-moses-lake-wide-view.jpeg?resize=2048,1152 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/sila-moses-lake-wide-view.jpeg?resize=668,376 668w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/sila-moses-lake-wide-view.jpeg?resize=666,375 666w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/sila-moses-lake-wide-view.jpeg?resize=1097,617 1097w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/sila-moses-lake-wide-view.jpeg?resize=708,398 708w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/sila-moses-lake-wide-view.jpeg?resize=50,28 50w\" /><figcaption><span>Sila’s new factory is capable of producing enough silicon anode material to power tens of thousands of EVs.</span><span><strong>Image Credits:</strong>Sila</span></figcaption></figure>\n<p>In Washington State, Sila found a near perfect confluence of factors that allowed it to build the facility, including cheap hydropower, abundant land, and a nearby supplier of an important raw ingredient.</p>\n<div>\n\t\t<p>Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t<p><span>San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>October 27-29, 2025</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n<p>“The cost structure of this technology is predicated on low cost energy — one of the big inputs — and then some key precursors, and we have that in Washington,” he said.</p>\n<p>The first runs of material at the Moses Lake factory will be used to show customers the material is consistent with the stuff they’ve been sampling for the past few years, which was made at an R&D line in Alameda, California. </p>\n<p>“We have a lot of confidence in that, but obviously the proof’s in the pudding,” Berdichevsky said.</p>\n<p>In a few years, he said batteries made using Sila’s material should be cheaper than those made with graphite anode material sourced from Western suppliers. (Chinese companies make graphite anodes for less, but they also receive generous state subsidies and have fewer environmental regulations, Berdichevsky said.)</p>\n<p>Silicon anodes could also allow automakers to reduce the amount of other pricey materials used in their batteries, including nickel, while maintaining the same level of performance. “Now you have that same performance, plus you get fast charge, plus you get domestic supply, and you get at a lower cost,” he said.</p>\n<p>If demand proves strong, Sila has plans to expand beyond Moses Lake. </p>\n<p>“There’s not a CEO of a Western automaker that doesn’t believe that within a decade, or maybe 15 years at the limit, they’re going to be selling almost all electric vehicles.” Berdichevsky said.“If you play it out 10 years from now, you probably have 10 million EVs in the U.S., so we’re going to need multiple sites.”</p>\n<p>Eventually, the company will look to expand into Europe and Asia, too, but Berdichevsky, who was born in Ukraine, is adamant in his commitment to the United States.</p>\n<p>“As a country, if you don’t make stuff, where’s your pride going to come from?” he said. “I think it’s just so important for us as a country to continue to learn to do this and create the ecosystem so that we can never fall behind again.”</p>\n</div><div>\n<div>\n\t\t<p>Tim De Chant is a senior climate reporter at TechCrunch.
