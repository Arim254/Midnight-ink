The new data centers will bring Stargate’s planned capacity to 7 gigawatts — enough energy to power more than 5 million homes.</p>\n<p>Three of the new sites are being developed with Oracle. They’re located in Shackelford County, Texas; Doña Ana County, New Mexico; and an undisclosed location in the Midwest. The other two sites are being developed with SoftBank, with one in Lordstown, Ohio, and the other in Milam County, Texas.</p>\n<p>The new Stargate AI data centers are part of OpenAI’s massive infrastructure buildout, as the company works to train and serve more powerful AI models. On Monday, OpenAI said it would receive a <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/09/22/nvidia-plans-to-invest-up-to-100b-in-openai/\">$100 billion investment from Nvidia</a> to buy the chipmaker’s AI processors and build out even more AI data centers.</p>\n</div>"

    "body": "<div>\n<p>Google Search is bringing its AI Mode feature — its AI-powered search experience — to Spanish-speaking users, the company <a href=\"https://blog.google/products/search/ai-mode-spanish/\" target=\"_blank\">announced</a> on Tuesday. This expansion will introduce Google’s conversational search interface to a broader market, allowing users to ask questions using natural language queries, engage in back-and-forth conversations, upload images, dig deeper on complex topics, and more.</p>\n<p>The Spanish-language rollout comes on the heels of Google’s major AI Mode expansion in August, when the company released the feature to <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/08/21/googles-ai-mode-expands-globally-adds-new-agentic-features/\">180 more countries worldwide</a>. Previously, it had only been available in the U.S., U.K., and India. During that August rollout, Google also introduced <a href=\"https://blog.google/products/search/ai-mode-agentic-personalized/\" target=\"_blank\">advanced AI capabilities</a> to its Google AI Ultra subscribers, allowing them to request restaurant reservations in AI Mode. The company plans to introduce support for other types of appointments and event ticket purchases in the future.</p>\n<p>Google has been rapidly rolling out AI across its products and services, often with multiple product announcements occurring simultaneously. For instance, the company announced Tuesday that it was bringing <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/09/23/google-photos-users-on-android-can-now-edit-their-photos-by-talking-to-or-texting-the-ai/\">conversational photo editing to all Android users </a>in the U.S. It also announced the same day that its more affordable Google AI Plus subscription plan, first introduced in Indonesia, is now arriving in 40 more countries. This expansion follows OpenAI’s recent launch of its ChatGPT’s Go plan, which launched in India <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/08/18/openai-launches-a-sub-5-chatgpt-plan-in-india/\">in August</a> and in Indonesia <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/09/22/after-india-openai-launches-its-affordable-chatgpt-go-plan-in-indonesia/\">on Tuesday</a>. </p>\n<p>The ChatGPT Go plan is a mid-tier subscription option that sits between OpenAI’s free version and its premium $20-per-month ChatGPT Plus plan. Users get 10 times higher usage limits than the free plan for sending questions or prompts, generating images, and uploading files. According to OpenAI, the plan also allows ChatGPT to remember previous conversations better, enabling more personalized responses over time.</p>\n<p>Google <a href=\"https://blog.google/products/search/ai-mode-expands-more-languages/\" target=\"_blank\">announced</a> earlier this month that AI Mode also now supports Hindi, Indonesian, Japanese, Korean, and Brazilian Portuguese.</p>\n<p>With so many products, users may find it hard to distinguish between different features and functionality, like the difference between Google’s AI Mode and its AI Overviews. The former is a separate, immersive, and conversational experience where users chat directly with Gemini AI. Meanwhile, AI Overviews simply offer a quick, AI-generated summary of information about your search query at the top of Google’s Search results.</p>\n</div><div>\n<div><p>\n\t\tSarah has worked as a reporter for TechCrunch since August 2011.

The market is young, and vibe-coding apps continue to improve and work out the bugs.</p>\n<p>New apps in this space are arriving all the time, too. This year, <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/vibe-coding-startup-vibecode-helps-build-apps-on-iphone-fundraise-2025-8\" target=\"_blank\">a startup called Vibecode launched with $9.4 million in seed funding</a> from Reddit co-founder Alexis Ohanian’s Seven Seven Six. The company’s service allows users to create mobile apps using AI within its own iOS app. Vibecode is so new, Appfigures doesn’t yet have data on it.</p>\n<p>For now, most people who want to toy around with vibe-coding technology are doing so on the desktop. But vibe coding does have another presence on mobile devices: It’s powering a growing number of existing mobile apps.</p>\n<p>For instance, the subscription platform provider <a href=\"http://revenuecat.com/\" target=\"_blank\">RevenueCat</a>, now used by over 50,000 apps, reports that it powers the in-app purchases for over 50% of all AI-built iOS apps currently on the market.</p>\n<p>The company told TechCrunch that the share of apps that came to RevenueCat for monetization from an AI assistant or platform — meaning an AI chatbot referred its service to the customer — surged to over 35% of all new sign-ups in the second quarter of this year, up from below 5% in the second quarter of last year.</p>\n<p>The platform, which is already used by nearly 50% of all mobile apps that take payments, notes that vibe coders are using its service to automatically configure their subscriptions with Cursor, Claude Code, and others, via its RevenueCat MCP server, allowing them to quickly create subscriptions and test plans and features.</p>\n<p>Although there’s certainly interest in vibe coding, the consensus is that it’s not ready for prime time. </p>\n<p>TechCrunch recently spoke with <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/09/14/vibe-coding-has-turned-senior-devs-into-ai-babysitters-but-they-say-its-worth-it/\">developers working with AI-generated code</a>, who said the technology still has a long way to go. A separate <a href=\"https://www.fastly.com/blog/senior-developers-ship-more-ai-code\" target=\"_blank\">survey from Fastly</a> found that roughly 95% of the nearly 800 developers surveyed said they had to spend extra time fixing AI-generated code.</p>\n<p>Still, user demand is there. A <a href=\"https://survey.stackoverflow.co/2025/ai\" target=\"_blank\">2025 survey</a> by Stack Overflow found that 84% of respondents are using or planning to use AI tools in their development process, up from 76% last year. Another <a href=\"https://www.theinformation.com/articles/information-survey-nearly-75-respondents-vibe-coding-like-results\" target=\"_blank\">survey</a> conducted this summer by the tech media site The Information found that 75% of respondents were at least trying vibe coding. A May 2025 study by the software intelligence platform Jellyfish found that 90% had integrated AI into their work, up from 61% last year, as reported by <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/vibe-coding-limits-use-cases-software-companies-airtable-redis-2025-7\" target=\"_blank\">Business Insider</a>.</p>\n</div><div>\n<div><p>\n\t\tSarah has worked as a reporter for TechCrunch since August 2011.

    "body": "<div>\n<p>SpaceX boasts an impressive alumni list. Some have gone on to found the sector’s biggest startups; others become astronauts.</p>\n<p>NASA unveiled its 2025 astronaut class this week, and two familiar names popped out: Anna Menon and Yuri Kubo. Both spent more than a decade at SpaceX, where they played critical roles in the company’s rise to the behemoth it is today.</p>\n<p>Menon joined SpaceX in 2018 after a career at NASA in the Mission Control Center, where she provided biomedical support for astronauts. As a senior engineer at SpaceX, she worked on private astronaut missions and flew as a mission specialist and medical officer aboard the Polaris Dawn private astronaut mission. That mission broke several records, including performing the first commercial spacewalk.  </p>\n<p>Kubo, meanwhile, spent 12 years at SpaceX as a Falcon 9 launch director and in senior roles overseeing the Starshield program and ground systems.  </p>\n<p>These 10 astronauts were chosen out of more than 8,000 applicants. Training is rigorous: The group will spend nearly two years learning the ropes before becoming eligible for assignments on the International Space Station and beyond. The training curriculum includes lessons in robotics, geology, foreign languages, space medicine, and more, alongside conducting simulated spacewalks and flight training, NASA said.</p>\n<p>If they pass training, this group will join the group of over 40 active astronauts, and may be part of the cohort that helps NASA transition to commercial private space stations upon the retirement of the ISS in 2030. This group will also be eligible for future science missions to the moon and Mars.</p>\n<p>This is not the first time SpaceX alumni have made the leap to government astronaut corps. Robb Kulin, former director of flight reliability at SpaceX, joined NASA’s 2017 class as a candidate. In 2021, Anil Menon — SpaceX’s first flight surgeon and medical director — was elected to be part of the Artemis generation of astronauts. (Anil and Anna are married.)</p>\n<div>\n\t\t<p>Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t<p><span>San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>October 27-29, 2025</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n<p>The trend underscores how the world’s most influential private space company is increasingly intertwined with bona fide astronaut work — not only supporting private missions like the Polaris program, but also producing astronauts themselves.  </p>\n<p>For decades, NASA astronauts mostly came from the military and academia. The commercial sector played little role in producing astronaut candidates. But SpaceX has changed that. The company has become a training ground for engineers and mission operators working on human spaceflight.</p>\n</div><div>\n<div>\n\t\t<p>Aria Alamalhodaei covers the space and defense industries at TechCrunch.

    "body": "<div>\n<p>As Google’s project manager for developer tools, Ryan Salva has a front-row seat to the ways AI tools are changing coding. Formerly of GitHub and Microsoft, he’s now responsible for tools like Gemini CLI and <a href=\"https://codeassist.google/\" target=\"_blank\">Gemini Code Assist</a>, nudging developers into the new world of agentic programming.</p>\n<p>His team released <a href=\"https://blog.google/technology/developers/dora-report-2025/\" target=\"_blank\">new third-party research</a> on Tuesday showing how developers actually use AI tools — and how much progress is left to make. I sat down with Salva to talk about the report and his personal experience with AI coding tools.</p>\n<p><em>This interview was edited for length and clarity.</em></p>\n<p><strong>Every year, Google does a survey of developer trends — but this year’s report really focuses on AI tools, and specifically how agentic developers are willing to get in their approach to programming. Was there anything in the research that surprised you?</strong></p>\n<p>One of the really interesting findings was the median date when developers started using AI tools. They found it was April 2024, which corresponds fairly neatly to Claude 3 coming out and Gemini 2.5 coming out. This is really the dawn of the reasoning or thinking models, and around that same time, we got much better at tool-calling. </p>\n<p>For coding tasks, you really need to be able to leverage external information in order to problem solve, so it may need to grep, it may need to compile the code. If the code compiles it may want to run that unit test, and that integration test. I think that tool-calling really is the important piece that gave models the ability to self-correct as they move along.</p>\n<p><strong>How are you using AI coding tools personally?</strong></p>\n<div>\n\t\t<p>Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t<p><span>San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>October 27-29, 2025</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n<p>Most of my coding these days is for hobby projects, and I spend most of my time using command line-based tools. So that includes Gemini CLI. Then there’s a little bit of Claude Code, little bit of Codex in there. And you don’t ever really use a terminal-based tool by itself, so I’m really heterogeneous around the IDEs that I use. I use Zed. I use VS code. I use Cursor. I use Windsurf, all of them, because I’m interested in just seeing how the world works and how the industry is evolving.</p>\n<p>On the professional side, product managers tend to live in documents, so the first thing is using AI to help me write the specification and requirements docs.</p>\n<p><strong>I’m curious how that works. You’re using Gemini CLI to build Gemini CLI, but I would imagine it doesn’t just run itself.</strong></p>\n<p>A development task will usually start as an issue, maybe it’s a GitHub issue that someone’s dropped with a bug. Often, if I’m really being honest, it’s a fairly under-specified issue. So I’ll use Gemini CLI in order to create a more robust requirement doc in Markdown. That will usually create probably about 100 lines of fairly technical, but also outcome-driven specification. Then I will use Gemini CLI to write the code based on that specification and the general preferences in the team documents.</p>\n<p>Across the engineering team, we have a couple of different layers of rules and Markdown docs that get consumed by the model, just laying out our way of working: Here’s how we do testing, here’s how we manage dependencies, and so on. So when it produces the code, it’s also working from those documents.</p>\n<p>And as Gemini CLI is going through and doing the troubleshooting, I’ll have it update my requirements doc saying, “I fixed this step. Now I’m on to the next step,” and so on. Each one of those creates its own commit and pull request in the repository, so I can always rewind or undo.</p>\n<p>I would say probably 70% to 80% of my work is me working in the terminal with natural language, trying to use Gemini CLI to craft the requirements, and then allowing Gemini CLI to write most of the code for me, which I will then go review and read with whatever IDE I happen to be using. But mostly I’m using the IDE as a place to read the code, rather than to write the code.</p>\n<p><strong>Do you think there’s a future for raw computer code? Or will we just move everything into terminal windows?</strong></p>\n<p>For three decades, the IDE was where we went to do everything in software development. You had the IDE, you had the browser, and you had the terminal window.  </p>\n<p>I think that’s still largely the case, but I suspect that over time we’ll end up spending a lot more time working with the requirements, and the amount of time spent in the IDE will gradually shrink. And I think that change may actually happen over a pretty long time horizon. </p>\n<p><strong>There’s a lot of angst about what that means for software development as a progression. If 10 years from now, we’re no longer looking at code, what does that mean for developers? Will there still be a job for them?</strong></p>\n<p>I think that your job as a developer is going to look a lot more like an architect. It is going to be about taking big, complex problems and breaking them down into smaller, solvable tasks. You’ll need to be thinking about like the bigger picture about what you’re trying to produce, rather than the intermediate language in order to express that in machine code.</p>\n</div><div>\n<div>\n\t<p>\n\t\tRussell Brandom has been covering the tech industry since 2012, with a focus on platform policy and emerging technologies.

    "body": "<div>\n<p>Rapido, a popular ride-hailing platform in India that competes with Uber, has doubled its valuation to $2.3 billion following a secondary share sale by food delivery giant Swiggy. The share sale comes just weeks after Rapido <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/08/13/indias-rapido-begins-testing-food-delivery-to-take-on-swiggy-zomato/\" target=\"_blank\">began piloting food deliveries</a>, edging into Swiggy’s core territory.</p>\n<p>Swiggy has offloaded its entire 12% stake in Rapido for ₹24 billion (about $270 million) through two separate deals, according to regulatory filings. Around 10% of the stake is being acquired by Prosus for ₹19.68 billion (roughly $222 million), while the remaining stake is being sold to WestBridge Capital for ₹4.31 billion (about $49 million), according to regulatory filings released after Swiggy’s board meeting on Tuesday.</p>\n<p>The Dutch investment group Prosus is already a common backer of both Swiggy and Rapido, and is the largest shareholder in Swiggy.</p>\n<p>Rapido’s latest share sale pegs the startup at more than twice its $1.1 billion valuation from September 2024, a figure that its CEO confirmed with TechCrunch.</p>\n<p>In August, Rapido ventured into food deliveries in Bengaluru through a pilot program operated by its subsidiary Ownly. The pilot marked Rapido’s entry into a sector long dominated by Swiggy and its archrival Zomato. Rapido co-founder and CEO Aravind Sanka confirmed to TechCrunch about the pilot, stating that it initially began in three neighborhoods within the city.</p>\n<p>Rapido’s entry into food delivery came over three years after Swiggy backed the startup in a <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2022/04/15/swiggy-rapido/\" target=\"_blank\">$180 million funding round</a> in April 2022.</p>\n<p>Rapido also partnered with Swiggy as a last-mile delivery provider, helping fulfill food orders on the platform. Swiggy’s early partnership gave Rapido a window into customer demand patterns and the operational challenges faced by restaurants on the platform, including the commissions required to receive orders, a source familiar with the matter told TechCrunch.</p>\n<div>\n\t\t<p>Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t<p><span>San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>October 27-29, 2025</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n<p>Swiggy hinted earlier this year that it might sell its stake in Rapido. In a July letter to shareholders, Swiggy stated it was reassessing its stake in Rapido due to a potential conflict of interest, as the ride-hailing company prepared to enter the food-delivery market. Swiggy co-founder and CEO Sriharsha Majety also mentioned during a July earnings call that the company “even had some conversations around a potential collaboration in food delivery with Rapido.”</p>\n<p>“Unfortunately, that didn’t materialize, and Rapido decided to enter the business,” Majety <a href=\"https://yourstory.com/2025/07/food-delivery-swiggy-results-earnings-rapido-funding\" target=\"_blank\">told</a> investors on the call.</p>\n<p>It’s still too early to gauge whether Rapido’s emerging food delivery business will affect incumbents like Swiggy and Zomato. </p>\n<p>The entry was expected to pressure existing players to lower their commissions to retain restaurant partners. However, a recent goods and services tax (GST) update by the Indian government may limit pricing flexibility, with a <a href=\"https://www.livemint.com/companies/news/zomato-swiggy-blinkit-orders-likely-to-cost-more-after-18-gst-on-delivery-heres-what-we-know-so-far-11757153566178.html\" target=\"_blank\">flat 18% tax</a> now levied on online food deliveries, making cost competitiveness a less effective edge.</p>\n<p>That said, Rapido has already been a strong contender in India’s ride-hailing market. Uber CEO Dara Khosrowshahi recently described the startup as <a href=\"https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/uber-ceo-dara-khosrowshahi-says-rapido-is-the-toughest-rival-in-india-ola-used-to-bebut-now/articleshow/123507028.cms\" target=\"_blank\">Uber’s biggest rival in India</a> — not the SoftBank-backed incumbent, Ola.</p>\n<p>As Rapido creeps into food delivery, Swiggy continues to build out its instant-commerce business, a competitive industry that offers quick delivery of groceries and other items in less than an hour.</p>\n<p>Swiggy announced the incorporation of a step-down subsidiary for its fast-growing quick commerce arm Instamart. The move could help it strengthen its position in India’s competitive quick commerce market, which includes players such as Zomato’s Blinkit, Flipkart, and Amazon. The structure may also pave the way for a potential spin-off or separate fundraising for Instamart in the future.</p>\n<p>Instamart has emerged as Swiggy’s fastest-growing business in recent months, with its gross order value surging 82% to ₹146.83 billion ($1.7 billion) in <a href=\"https://www.swiggy.com/corporate/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Corporate%20Deck%20FY24-25.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">FY25</a> (PDF) — nearly a third of the company’s total B2C orders. Instamart’s revenue also more than doubled to ₹22.52 billion ($254 million), outpacing the core food delivery segment, which grew 16.4% in order value and 83% in revenue.</p>\n</div><div>\n<div>\n\t\t<p>Jagmeet covers startups, tech policy-related updates, and all other major tech-centric developments from India for TechCrunch.

    "description": "Australia-based Alloy thinks it can help robotics firms with their data problem: The startup is building data infrastructure to help companies process and organize all the data their robots collect.",
    "body": "<div>\n<p>Robotics companies often have to deal with a simple but confounding problem: Robots produce a lot of data. Even a simple robot can easily produce up to a terabyte of data per day, since they continuously capture data from cameras and sensors.</p>\n<p>Sydney, Australia-based <a href=\"https://www.usealloy.ai/\" target=\"_blank\">Alloy</a> thinks it can help with that issue: The startup is building data infrastructure for robotics companies to help them process and organize all the data their robots collect from various sources, including sensors and cameras.  </p>\n<p>At its core, Alloy encodes and labels the data it collects, and allows users to search through their data using natural language to find bugs and errors. Users can also set up rules to catch and flag issues in the future, similar to how observability tools flag errors in software code.  </p>\n<p>“The current pattern is, you look for some kind of anomaly, and then you’ll replay the data,” Joe Harris, the founder and CEO of Alloy, told TechCrunch. “They then are spending hours scrubbing through this data, looking for these issues that have been flagged to them, trying to diagnose from that [while] not really having a good view as to whether this has happened before, if it’s a high-severity issue or this one-off, edge case.” </p>\n<p>Considering how much data a single robot produces, as robotics companies look to scale, this data problem will continue to compound, Harris added.  </p>\n<p>Harris has been fascinated by robotics since he was a kid. But when he graduated from college in 2018, there <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/09/12/we-are-entering-a-golden-age-of-robotics-startups-and-not-just-because-of-ai/\" target=\"_blank\">weren’t many opportunities to work in the field</a>, so he instead worked multiple roles across Australian tech companies, including Atlassian and telehealth startup Eucalyptus.  </p>\n<p>In 2024, he decided the time was right to launch a robotics company of his own. He originally thought he’d focus on building robots for the agriculture industry due to an interest in vertical farming, but when he started talking to other founders, the issue of managing the data robots produce kept coming up. He figured he might as well solve that problem first.  </p>\n<div>\n\t\t<p>Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t<p><span>San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>October 27-29, 2025</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n<p>“If I need to solve this problem for myself and my robotics company, I will have a great horizontal solution,” Harris said. “Perhaps that would be a more important near-term mission — to help enable other robotics companies to spend less time on data plumbing and more time on getting to that high reliability.” </p>\n<p>Since its launch in February 2025, Alloy has signed four Australian robotics companies as design partners and looks to push into the U.S. market this year.  </p>\n<p>“The customers that we found have been most excited about this because they’ve gone through the pain of building and maintaining it themselves,” Harris said. “They’d much rather have a fantastic tool, like a Databricks just specifically built for robotics.” </p>\n<p>Alloy has also raised a little more than AUD $4.5 million (about $3 million) in a pre-seed round that was led by Blackbird Ventures, with participation from Airtree Ventures, Xtal Ventures, and Skip Capital, in addition to angel investors from robotics companies.  </p>\n<p>The company doesn’t have too many direct competitors yet. Many robotics companies are either retrofitting existing data management tools that aren’t designed for the multimodal data robots produce, or are attempting to build their own internal data management tools.  </p>\n<p>As commercial use cases for robotics continue to increase, Alloy hopes it will be able to capture a good share of the growing market.  </p>\n<p>“It’s never been a better time to build a robotics company,” Harris said. “I really want to make it possible for the next 10,000, 100,000 robotics companies that don’t yet exist, that inevitably will not have to necessarily reinvent the wheel, like every company has.” </p>\n</div><div>\n<div>\n\t\t<p>Becca is a senior writer at TechCrunch that covers venture capital trends and startups.
