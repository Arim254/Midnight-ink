    "body": "<div>\n<p>The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) filed a <a href=\"https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/news/press-releases/2025/09/ftc-alleges-sendit-app-its-ceo-unlawfully-collected-personal-data-children-deceived-users-about\" target=\"_blank\">complaint</a> against Sendit, an anonymous question app that became popular with Gen Z and younger, for unlawfully collecting children’s data, deceiving users about who sent them messages, and tricking users into buying memberships.</p>\n<p>On Sendit, users — who are mostly teens — can send each other anonymous questions via integrations with Instagram, TikTok, or Snapchat. Several apps like this have cropped up over the years, including <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/03/anonymous-snapchat-app-sendit-surges-with-3-5m-installs-after-snap-bans-yolo-and-lmk/\">YOLO and LMK</a>, which were suspended on Snapchat in 2021 due to a lawsuit over a child’s suicide. After that suspension, Sendit quickly gained <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/03/anonymous-snapchat-app-sendit-surges-with-3-5m-installs-after-snap-bans-yolo-and-lmk/\">3.5 million downloads</a>, as users flocked to the app to replace those that were no longer available.</p>\n<p>By the following year, TechCrunch <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2022/06/29/anonymous-social-apps-shift-their-attention-to-instagram-in-the-wake-of-snapchats-ban/\">reporting</a> found that the newer anonymous question apps, like Sendit and <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2022/08/04/top-anonymous-social-app-ngl-forced-to-stop-tricking-its-users/\">LMK</a>, were misleading users with fake messages, then offering in-app purchases to reveal who sent the messages.</p>\n<p>This reporting was echoed in the FTC’s complaint, which stated that Sendit sent users fake, provocative messages (like “would you ever get with me?” or “have you done drugs?”).</p>\n<p>If a user wanted to see who sent a message, they could spend $9.99 for a “Diamond Membership,” but the FTC claims that it was not clear that this was a recurring weekly payment, and not a one-time cost. If a user revealed the “identity” behind a message that was actually submitted by Sendit, they would be given false information.</p>\n<p>The FTC also accused Sendit of knowingly collecting data on users under the age of 13 without parental consent, which is illegal under <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Children%27s_Online_Privacy_Protection_Act\" target=\"_blank\">COPPA</a> (Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act). In particular, the FTC cited an instance from 2022 when more than 116,000 users reported that they were under 13, but Sendit parent Iconic Hearts did not notify parents that it had collected this data, nor did it ask for permission.</p>\n<p>That same year, TechCrunch found that Sendit users were complaining in App Store reviews that the Sendit for Instagram app had solicited downloads by marketing itself as “Sendit Reveal,” an app that would “reveal” who sent them anonymous messages. </p>\n<p>At the time, when TechCrunch asked Sendit founder Hunter Rice about these dark patterns, he suggested that we were looking for clickbait.</p>\n<p>“There’s a lot of great things about what we’re doing that are newsworthy,” Rice <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2022/06/29/anonymous-social-apps-shift-their-attention-to-instagram-in-the-wake-of-snapchats-ban/\">told TechCrunch</a> in 2022. “You’re welcome to have your fun with this topic, but I’m only interested in talking about real news.”</p>\n<p>Sendit <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2022/07/15/not-gonna-lie-this-ngl-lawsuit-is-kinda-juicy/\">also sued a competitor, NGL</a>, in 2022, saying it stole the idea of the fake, anonymous questions and other trade secrets. NGL was <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2022/08/04/top-anonymous-social-app-ngl-forced-to-stop-tricking-its-users/\">later forced to end the practice</a> in order to remain in the App Store, following TechCrunch’s reporting.  </p>\n</div><div>\n<div>\n\t\t<p>Amanda Silberling is a senior writer at TechCrunch covering the intersection of technology and culture.

But according to Venmo, this is changing in November.</p>\n<p>“Venmo users and PayPal users will be able to pay each other in the U.S. and worldwide,” Venmo wrote in an email to customers. “That means that PayPal users will be able to find and pay you using your phone number, and later using your email address.” </p>\n<p>For years, customers have used <a href=\"https://wise.com/us/blog/venmo-to-paypal\" target=\"_blank\">convoluted</a> <a href=\"https://www.remitfinder.com/blog/how-to-transfer-money-from-venmo-to-paypal\" target=\"_blank\">workarounds</a> to transfer money between the services. This has long been a pain point for users, especially since Venmo is owned by PayPal, leading users to believe this kind of feature would already exist. (Perhaps integrating the two services would discourage users from creating accounts on both platforms, disincentivizing PayPal to enable this feature sooner.)</p>\n<p>This change means that PayPal users will now be able to find Venmo users by inputting their phone numbers, and later, their email addresses. If you don’t want PayPal users to be able to find you, you can update your settings in the Venmo app by navigating to Settings > Privacy > Find me… and while you’re at it, you might as well default your Venmo transactions to private via Settings > Privacy.

YouTube TV reportedly now has around <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2025/09/25/youtube-tv-nbcuniversal-impending-carriage-dispute.html\" target=\"_blank\">10 million subscribers</a>, in large part due to is live sports-related content. Hulu Live TV and Fubo together have about 6 million subscribers, so this merger is a step toward closing that competitive gap. </p>\n<p>Additionally, if executed well, it could offer sports fans more flexible options. For instance, sources suggest that Fubo may be exploring the idea of introducing a new Hulu-branded package as a perk for streamers, featuring access to Disney’s trio of streaming services (Disney+, Hulu, and ESPN) at no additional cost. The company recently <a href=\"https://thedesk.net/2025/08/fubo-sports-launch-hulu-live-tv-app/\" target=\"_blank\">announced</a> the launch of a skinny sports-only package at a lower price point.</p>\n<p>However, the approval obtained at the Fubo shareholder meeting on Tuesday still awaits regulatory approvals, as the deal will create a larger entity and impact market competition, reducing the number of independent streaming players.</p>\n<p>Once the transaction is finalized, Disney will own approximately 70% of Fubo. However, possibly with those regulatory approvals in mind, Fubo promises it will continue to be available to viewers as an independent offering. That said, Disney is consolidating this unit under a single leader: David Gandler, co-founder and CEO of Fubo, who will oversee the newly merged Fubo and Hulu Live TV operations.</p>\n</div>\n\t\t\t<div>\n\t<p>Topics</p>\n</div>\n<div>\n<div>\n\t\t<p>Lauren covers media, streaming, apps and platforms at TechCrunch.</p>\n<p>You can contact or verify outreach from Lauren by emailing <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:laurenf.techcrunch@gmail.com\">laurenf.techcrunch@gmail.com</a> or via encrypted message at laurenforris22.25 on Signal.</p>\t</div>\n\t<p>\n\t\t<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/author/lauren-forristal/\">View Bio <svg></svg></a>\n\t</p>\n</div>\n\t\t</div>"

    "body": "<div>\n<p>Toyota is looking for the next new thing in mobility, climate, AI, and industrial automation. Its answer is $1.5 billion in new capital that will focus on, and invest in, the life cycle of startups — from the first seeds of an invention through its growth stage and eventually to mature companies.</p>\n<p>Toyota made two related announcements Tuesday that provide a snapshot of the company’s growing interest in the startup ecosystem. It also hints at how those startups, and their inventions, may play a part in Woven City, a prototype city located on a 175-acre site at the foot of Mount Fuji in Japan designed to incubate startups and that <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/01/06/toyotas-woven-city-is-open-for-business-and-looking-for-startups/\">opened this year</a>. </p>\n<p>The Japanese automaker said Tuesday it has created a strategic investment subsidiary called Toyota Invention Partners Co. with about $670 million in capital, while its growth-stage venture arm Woven Capital launched a second $800 million fund. </p>\n<p>The Toyota Invention Partners subsidiary will take a long-term strategy focused on Japan-based startups, eschewing the traditional fixed investment periods found in other funds. Woven Capital general partner George Kellerman described Toyota Invention Partners Co. as a bookend of sorts to the company’s other investment organizations.</p>\n<p>“One way to think about them (Toyota Invention Partners) is they’re bookending what Toyota Ventures and Woven Capital are doing,” Kellerman said in a phone interview. “They’re doing the really early stage on one end, but then they’re maybe doing these longer-term project finance, asset management type of infrastructure investments, that might be a 30-, 40-, 50-year type of investment.”</p>\n<p>Toyota Invention Partners is at the “zero to one” stage, Toyota Ventures covers early-stage, and Woven Capital handles growth stage, he explained. But Toyota Invention Partners may also stick with a startup throughout all of these stages, and if it really scales, it’ll go to the balance sheet of Toyota, Kellerman added.</p>\n<p>Kellerman said the two announcements reflect Toyota’s interest in startups — and the tech and innovation that is coming out of them.</p>\n<div>\n\t\t<p>Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t<p><span>San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>October 27-29, 2025</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n<p>“The thing that really excites me is that Toyota is clearly leaning in; they’re committing over $3 billion across Toyota Invention Partners, Woven Capital’s fund one and two, and all of Toyota Ventures funds,” he said. “And it’s really about making sure that we can serve the needs of the market and the founders that we’re working with, because their needs change depending on their stage.”</p>\n<p>This strategy is illustrated in another investment announcement that was made Tuesday. Machina Labs, a Los Angeles-based advanced manufacturing startup that combines AI and robotics to rapidly produce metal structures, announced a strategic investment from Woven Capital and a pilot project with Toyota Motor North America. The automaker will test Machina Labs’ manufacturing technology to produce automotive body panels and accessories. Woven Capital and Machina Labs didn’t disclose the investment amount or terms.</p>\n<p>Woven Capital, which launched in 2021 with an $800 million fund, is still focused on investing in global startups that are entering into a growth stage. The firm has invested in 18 companies from the first fund, including Foretellix and autonomous vehicle technology startup Nuro. It will continue to pull capital from the first fund to support follow-on investments. </p>\n<p>This second fund, which is also $800 million, will target 20 to 25 new investments in Series B to late-stage companies working on advancing AI, automation, climate technology, energy, sustainability, and more. As part of the new fund announcement, Woven Capital has also been made a wholly owned subsidiary of Toyota.</p>\n</div><div>\n<div><p>\n\t\tKirsten Korosec is a reporter and editor who has covered the future of transportation from EVs and autonomous vehicles to urban air mobility and in-car tech for more than a decade.

The equity stakes will be acquired through no-cost warrants, which are financial instruments that give the government the right to purchase shares at a set price. The new terms came out of a renegotiation with the DOE’s Loan Programs Office<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/09/24/trump-administration-wants-10-stake-in-canadian-lithium-miner-that-sells-to-gm/\"> over a $2.26 billion loan</a> that was awarded to Lithium Americas under the Biden Administration.</p>\n<p>Shares of Lithium Americas spiked 34% in after-hours trading.</p>\n<p>The DOE said the equity stakes will serve as additional collateral on the loan, helping to reduce repayment risk for taxpayers. Lithium is a key chemical element that is used in the batteries of electric vehicles and smartphones.</p>\n<p>“Despite having some of the largest deposits, the United States produces less than 1% percent of the global supply of lithium. Thanks to President Trump’s bold leadership, American lithium production is going to skyrocket,” U.S. Energy Secretary Chris Wright said in a press release. “Today’s announcement helps reduce our dependence on foreign adversaries for critical minerals by strengthening domestic supply chains and ensures better stewardship of American taxpayer dollars. President Trump promised to do both and he is delivering.”</p>\n<p>The announcement Tuesday is the latest action by the Trump administration to take ownership stakes in companies. The Trump administration has announced plans to take a <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/08/22/u-s-government-plans-to-take-a-10-stake-in-intel/\">10% stake in Intel</a> and MP Materials, which operates a rare earth minerals mine in the United States.</p>\n<p>Lithium Americas is developing the Thacker Pass mine in Nevada, which is expected to produce enough lithium to make as many as 800,000 electric vehicles per year in the first phase. President Trump approved the permit for the project in January 2021, at the end of his first term.</p>\n<div>\n\t\t<p>Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t<p><span>San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>October 27-29, 2025</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n<p>GM bought a 38% stake in Lithium Americas last year for $625 million, which gave the automaker the right to buy the entirety of the first phase of production, and lithium from the mine for 20 years during the second phase.

    "body": "<div>\n<p>At its annual hardware event, Amazon introduced a new lineup of Echo devices, built specifically for its AI assistant, Alexa+, which has already rolled out to millions of customers through its early access program. </p>\n<p>To showcase the AI’s capabilities, Amazon is releasing four new Echo devices with improved processing power and memory: the Echo Dot Max, Echo Studio, Echo Show 8, and Echo Show 11.</p>\n<p>Key to the devices are the Alexa+ integrations, allowing the speakers to respond to more queries than earlier models, offering support for natural language conversations, more complex questions, and soon, more add-ons and capabilities.</p>\n<p>This will later include an Alexa+ Store, where users can explore services from brands like Fandango, GrubHub, Lyft, Priceline, Taskrabbit, Thumbtack, and Yahoo Sports. The devices will also be able to manage new or existing subscriptions with Amazon’s own services like Amazon Music, Amazon Kids+, or Alexa Emergency Assist and customize their Alexa experience.</p>\n<p>The new Echo devices launching today run on Amazon’s custom-designed silicon chips, the AZ3 and AZ3 Pro, which include an AI Accelerator designed to run AI edge models. </p>\n<figure><img src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/download-2.png\" alt=\"a photo showing two Amazon Echo devices, a large model and a smaller model.\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/download-2.png 1320w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/download-2.png?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/download-2.png?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/download-2.png?resize=768,432 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/download-2.png?resize=680,383 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/download-2.png?resize=1200,675 1200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/download-2.png?resize=1280,720 1280w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/download-2.png?resize=430,242 430w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/download-2.png?resize=720,405 720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/download-2.png?resize=900,507 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/download-2.png?resize=800,450 800w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/download-2.png?resize=668,376 668w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/download-2.png?resize=666,375 666w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/download-2.png?resize=1096,617 1096w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/download-2.png?resize=708,399 708w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/download-2.png?resize=50,28 50w\" /><figcaption><span><strong>Image Credits:</strong>Amazon</span></figcaption></figure>\n<p>The AZ3 enables better conversation detection on the Echo Dot, letting people talk to the device from anywhere in the room, while still filtering out background noise. The chip also improves detection of the wake word by over 50%, Amazon claims.</p>\n<p>The other three devices — the Studio, Show 8, and 11 — use the AZ3 Pro, which adds support for advanced language models and vision transformers. </p>\n<p>Plus, the AZ3 Pro-enabled devices include Ominisense, a custom sensor platform for ambient AI that uses the 13-megapixel camera on new Echo Show devices, audio, ultrasound, Wi-Fi radar, accelerometer, and Wi-Fi channel state information (CSI). With this feature, the devices allow Alexa to act on events happening in the home, like delivering a reminder when a particular person walks in the room or alerting you to an open garage door before you go to bed at night.</p>\n<figure><img src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/download-1.png\" alt=\"an image showing the two Echo Show devices side-by-side\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/download-1.png 1320w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/download-1.png?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/download-1.png?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/download-1.png?resize=768,432 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/download-1.png?resize=680,383 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/download-1.png?resize=1200,675 1200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/download-1.png?resize=1280,720 1280w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/download-1.png?resize=430,242 430w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/download-1.png?resize=720,405 720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/download-1.png?resize=900,507 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/download-1.png?resize=800,450 800w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/download-1.png?resize=668,376 668w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/download-1.png?resize=666,375 666w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/download-1.png?resize=1096,617 1096w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/download-1.png?resize=708,399 708w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/download-1.png?resize=50,28 50w\" /><figcaption><span><strong>Image Credits:</strong>Amazon</span></figcaption></figure>\n<p>The new Echo Dot Max, $99.99, adds nearly three times the bass for better sound.

The latter integrates with Amazon, Whole Foods, and Amazon Fresh to make reordering favorites and delivery tracking easier.</p>\n<p>Plus, Amazon is teaming up with smart ring maker Oura to bring personalized health and wellness suggestions to Alexa devices. This could help do things like add workout reminders or nudges to head to bed to get the best sleep. </p>\n<p>Other devices from Withings and Wyze will be supported in the future.</p>\n</div>"

    "body": "<div>\n<p><a href=\"https://periodic.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Periodic Labs</a> came out of stealth on Tuesday with a war chest of $300 million as a seed round, backed by a tech industry who’s who: Andreessen Horowitz, DST, Nvidia, Accel, Elad Gil, Jeff Dean, Eric Schmidt, and Jeff Bezos.</p>\n<p>Periodic Labs was founded by Ekin Dogus Cubuk and Liam Fedus. Cubuk led the materials and chemistry team at Google Brain and DeepMind, where one of his projects was, for instance, an AI tool called GNoME. That tool <a href=\"https://deepmind.google/discover/blog/millions-of-new-materials-discovered-with-deep-learning/\" target=\"_blank\">discovered over 2 million new crystals in 2023</a>, materials that could one day be used to power new generations of technology, researchers say.</p>\n<p>Fedus is a former VP of Research at OpenAI, and one of the researchers who helped create ChatGPT. He also led the team that created the <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2101.03961\" target=\"_blank\">first trillion-parameter neural network</a>.</p>\n<p>Its small team is likewise filled with researchers who have worked on other major AI and materials science projects, from building OpenAI’s agent Operator to working on Microsoft’s MatterGen, an LLM materials science discovery AI.</p>\n<p>The goal of Periodic Labs is nothing less than to automate scientific discovery, creating AI scientists, the company says. This means building labs where robots conduct physical experiments, collect data, iterate, and try again, learning and improving as they go.</p>\n<p>The lab’s first goal is to invent new superconductors that it hopes perform better and possibly require less energy than existing superconducting materials. But the well-funded startup also hopes to find other new materials.</p>\n<p>Another goal is to collect all the physical world data that its AI scientists produce as they mix and heat and otherwise manipulate various powers and raw materials in their search for something new.</p>\n<div>\n\t\t<p>Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t<p><span>San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>October 27-29, 2025</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n<p>“Until now, scientific AI advances have come from models trained on the internet” and LLMs have “exhausted” the internet as a source that can be consumed, the company says in an introductory <a href=\"https://periodic.com/\" target=\"_blank\">blog post</a>. “[A]t Periodic, we are building AI scientists <em>and</em> the autonomous laboratories for them to operate.”</p>\n<p>The hope is that, not only will the labs invent next-generation materials, but they will produce invaluable fresh data that AI models can consume to continue their evolution.</p>\n<p>While this might be one of the most impressive groups of researchers to assemble a startup for this purpose, it’s not the only one working on AI scientists. AI as a tool to automate chemistry discoveries has been a <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.06949\" target=\"_blank\">topic of academic research since at least 2023</a>. It is the pursuit of tiny startups like <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/12/22/tetsuwan-scientific-is-making-robotic-ai-scientists-that-can-run-experiments-on-their-own/\">Tetsuwan Scientific</a>, as well as nonprofits like <a href=\"https://www.futurehouse.org/\" target=\"_blank\">Future House</a> and the University of Toronto’s <a href=\"https://acceleration.utoronto.ca/\" target=\"_blank\">Acceleration Consortium</a>.</p>\n</div>"

    "body": "<div>\n<p>Sen. Ted Cruz (R-TX) has blocked an effort to pass legislation that would have extended data privacy protections for federal lawmakers and public officials to everyone in the United States.</p>\n<p>On Monday night, Sen. Ron Wyden (D-OR) asked the U.S. Senate for unanimous consent from fellow senators to pass his legislation, <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/26173848-senate-2850/\" target=\"_blank\">S.2850</a>, or Protecting Americans from Doxing and Political Violence Act.</p>\n<p>Wyden’s bill, if passed, would have taken <a href=\"https://www.congress.gov/bill/119th-congress/senate-bill/2144/text\" target=\"_blank\">bipartisan-passed provisions</a> designed to protect government officials, lawmakers, and their families from having their personal information sold or traded by data brokers, and extend them to every American and person living in the United States.</p>\n<p>“Members of Congress should not receive special treatment,” Wyden said on the Senate floor. “Our constituents deserve protection from violence, stalking, and other criminal threats.”</p>\n<p>“Protecting everyone is the most effective way to protect U.S. military and intelligence personnel, including undercover officers,” Wyden added, per <a href=\"https://www.congress.gov/119/crec/2025/09/29/171/159/CREC-2025-09-29-pt1-PgS6813-3.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">the congressional record</a>.</p>\n<p>Cruz was the sole objecting senator, who claimed without evidence that Wyden’s bill could disrupt law enforcement, “such as knowing where sexual predators are living.”</p>\n<p>Data brokers are part of a worldwide multibillion-dollar industry of companies that profit from hoarding and selling access to huge amounts of Americans’ personal, financial, and granular location information, often collected from phones and other devices connected to the internet. This data gets sold, <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2023/06/13/us-intelligence-report-purchase-americans-personal-data/\" target=\"_blank\">including to governments</a>, which don’t need a warrant for commercially obtainable data.</p>\n<p>The collection of huge banks of data also comes with its own risks, including <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/05/28/data-broker-giant-lexisnexis-says-breach-exposed-personal-information-of-over-364000-people/\" target=\"_blank\">security lapses</a> and <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/01/13/gravy-analytics-data-broker-breach-trove-of-location-data-threatens-privacy-millions/\" target=\"_blank\">data breaches</a>. Information bought by data brokers has been used to dox people, and in recent cases is linked to the shooting of two Minnesota state lawmakers, one of whom died. The killer <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/story/minnesota-lawmaker-shootings-people-search-data-brokers/\" target=\"_blank\">allegedly obtained their home addresses</a> from data brokers.</p>\n<p>Cruz also objected to a second piece of legislation that Wyden introduced soon after, <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/26173849-senate-2851/\" target=\"_blank\">S.2851</a>, which would have extended the protections for federal officials and lawmakers to state officials and their staff, as well as survivors of domestic violence and sexual assault.</p>\n<p>In response, Cruz said that he was “interested in expanding the protection to as wide a universe as is feasible, as is practicable, but that answer is not yet worked out.”</p>\n<p><em>Correction: Updated to show that two Minnesota lawmakers were shot, one of whom died.</em></p>\n</div><div>\n<div>\n\t\t<p>Zack Whittaker is the security editor at TechCrunch.

Users can enroll the faces of their loved ones into the device, enabling Ring to alert them when it recognizes a visitor. The AI will also alert the user when an unfamiliar person is detected, helping them to make informed decisions quickly. </p>\n<p>The company explained <a href=\"https://www.aboutamazon.com/news/devices/ring-camera-4k-home-security\" target=\"_blank\">in today’s blog post</a> that the new feature is meant to empower “customers to reduce notifications triggered by familiar people’s routine activities” and eliminate guesswork for people detection.  </p>\n<p>“Equally important is that if someone you don’t recognize is lingering, you’ll know immediately [they’re] unfamiliar,” Ring founder Jamie Siminoff told press at the event. </p>\n<p>Ring has faced criticism for its close ties with law enforcement and its history of poor data management. Last year, following numerous complaints, the company <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/01/24/amazon-reverses-course-revokes-police-access-to-ring-footage-via-neighbors-app/\">announced </a>that it would no longer accommodate police requests for footage from Ring users without a warrant. </p>\n<div>\n\t\t<p>Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t<p><span>San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>October 27-29, 2025</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n<p>The Familiar Faces feature can be integrated into the broader Alexa+ Greetings system, which will enable specific greetings when the camera recognizes a specific face. This feature transforms the voice assistant into a smart doorbell attendant, enabling it to interact with visitors, manage deliveries, and identify the purpose of visits to keep users informed.</p>\n<p>Another AI feature, Search Party, helps find lost pets by networking Ring cameras. When a user registers a lost pet, neighboring Ring users will receive a description of the pet and can report sightings. The system uses AI to deliver possible matches, although sightings have to be voluntarily reported. The company states that users are in control of their privacy and can choose to ignore the alert if they don’t want to share information with a neighbor. </p>\n<p>Both Familiar Faces and Alexa+ Greeting will roll out to customers starting in December. Search Party for dogs will launch in November, with support for cats and other pets planned for release in the future.</p>\n<figure><img src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/assets.aboutamazon-1.png?w=680\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/assets.aboutamazon-1.png 1200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/assets.aboutamazon-1.png?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/assets.aboutamazon-1.png?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/assets.aboutamazon-1.png?resize=768,432 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/assets.aboutamazon-1.png?resize=680,383 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/assets.aboutamazon-1.png?resize=430,242 430w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/assets.aboutamazon-1.png?resize=720,405 720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/assets.aboutamazon-1.png?resize=900,506 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/assets.aboutamazon-1.png?resize=800,450 800w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/assets.aboutamazon-1.png?resize=668,375 668w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/assets.aboutamazon-1.png?resize=1097,617 1097w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/assets.aboutamazon-1.png?resize=708,398 708w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/assets.aboutamazon-1.png?resize=50,28 50w\" /><figcaption><span><strong>Image Credits:</strong>Amazon Ring</span></figcaption></figure>\n<p>The features will come preloaded onto Ring’s new Retinal 2K and Retinal 4K devices, the company’s new products that use “Retinal Vision,” imaging technology that improves the imaging process with advanced AI.

    "body": "<div>\n<p>South Korea is world-famous for its blazing-fast internet, near-universal broadband coverage, and as a leader in digital innovation, hosting global tech brands like Hyundai, LG, and Samsung. But this very success has made the country a prime target for hackers and exposed how fragile its cybersecurity defenses remain.  </p>\n<p>The country is reeling from a string of high-profile hacks, affecting credit card companies, telecoms, tech startups, and government agencies, impacting vast swathes of the South Korean population. In each case, ministries and regulators appeared to scramble in parallel, sometimes deferring to one another rather than moving in unison. </p>\n<p>Critics argue that South Korea’s cyber defenses are hindered by a fragmented system of government ministries and agencies, often resulting in slow and uncoordinated responses, <a href=\"https://www.koreatimes.co.kr/business/tech-science/20250922/calls-grow-for-cybersecurity-control-tower\" target=\"_blank\">per local media reports</a>. </p>\n<p>With <a href=\"https://en.yna.co.kr/view/AEN20250922001000315#:~:text=In%20response%2C%20the%20government%20announced,advanced%20cyberattacks%20remains%20in%20doubt.\" target=\"_blank\">no clear government agency acting as “first responder”</a> following a cyberattack, the country’s cyber defenses are struggling to keep pace with its digital ambitions. </p>\n<p>“The government’s approach to cybersecurity remains largely reactive, treating it as a crisis management issue rather than as critical national infrastructure,” Brian Pak, the chief executive of Seoul-based cybersecurity firm Theori, told TechCrunch.  </p>\n<p>Pak, who also serves as an advisor to SK Telecom’s parent company’s special committee on cybersecurity innovations, told TechCrunch that because government agencies tasked with cybersecurity work in silos, developing digital defenses and training skilled workers often get overlooked. </p>\n<p>The country is also facing a severe shortage of skilled cybersecurity experts.  </p>\n<p>“[That’s] mainly because the current approach has held back workforce development. This lack of talent creates a vicious cycle. Without enough expertise, it’s impossible to build and maintain the proactive defenses needed to stay ahead of threats,” Pak continued.  </p>\n<p>Political deadlock has fostered a habit of seeking quick, obvious “quick fixes” after each crisis, said Pak, all the while the more challenging, long-term work of building digital resilience continues to be sidelined. </p>\n<p>This year alone, there has been a major cybersecurity incident in South Korea almost every month, further mounting concerns over the resilience of South Korea’s digital infrastructure.  </p>\n<h2 id=\"h-january-2025-nbsp\">January 2025 </h2>\n<ul>\n<li>GS Retail, the operator of convenience stores and grocery markets across South Korea,<a href=\"https://biz.chosun.com/en/en-retail/2025/01/06/VVNMSAYGDBFMPL5TGSDN2M52R4/\" target=\"_blank\"> confirmed</a> a data breach that exposed the personal details of about 90,000 customers after its website was attacked between December 27 and January 4.

A Russian-linked hacking group claimed it stole over a terabyte of internal files, including sensitive customer data, and even leaked samples on the dark web.</li>\n<li>North Korea-linked hackers, believed to be the Kimsuky group, have been spying on foreign embassies in South Korea for months by disguising their attacks as routine diplomatic emails. According to Trellix, the campaign has been active <a href=\"https://therecord.media/north-korean-hackers-target-foreign-embassies?\" target=\"_blank\">since March and has targeted at least 19 embassies and foreign ministries</a> in South Korea. </li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"h-september-2025-nbsp-nbsp\">September 2025  </h2>\n<ul>\n<li>A North Korea-backed hacking group, Kimsuky, used AI-generated deepfake images in a July spear-phishing attempt against a South Korean military organization, according to Genians Security Center. The group has also targeted other South Korean institutions.</li>\n<li>KT, one of South Korea’s biggest telecom operators, has reported a cyber breach that exposed subscriber data from more than 5,500 customers. The attack was linked to illegal “fake base stations” that tapped into KT’s network, enabling hackers to intercept mobile traffic, steal information like IMSI, IMEI, and phone numbers, and even make unauthorized micro-payments. </li>\n</ul>\n<p>In light of the recent surge in hacking incidents, the South Korean Presidential Office’s National Security is stepping in to tighten defenses, <a href=\"https://www.lightreading.com/regulatory-politics/south-korea-forms-interagency-body-to-curb-data-breaches-as-kt-reports-new-incidents?utm_source=chatgpt.com\" target=\"_blank\">pushing for a cross-ministerial effort that brings multiple agencies together in a coordinated</a>, whole-of-government response.  </p>\n<p>In September 2025, the National Security Office announced that it would implement <a href=\"https://en.yna.co.kr/view/AEN20250922008700315\" target=\"_blank\">“comprehensive” cyber measures</a> through an interagency plan, led by the South Korean president’s office. Regulators also signaled a legal change giving the government power to launch probes <a href=\"https://www.ajupress.com/view/20250922154604642\" target=\"_blank\">at the first sign of hacking — even if companies haven’t filed a report</a>.

    "body": "<div>\n<p>Starbase is a city without a police department, but not without police.</p>\n<p>For months, Cameron County sheriff’s deputies have patrolled the roads and beaches surrounding SpaceX’s sprawling rocket facility in South Texas. Now, less than a year after <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/05/04/residents-of-spacexs-starbase-launch-site-vote-to-incorporate-as-a-city/\">Starbase residents voted to incorporate</a>, the city has signed formal agreements making those deputies its de facto police force and Cameron County jails the destination for anyone arrested within city limits.</p>\n<p>The two interlocal deals, approved in September and effective beginning Wednesday, are sweeping. One requires Cameron County to dedicate eight deputies to Starbase, though only two will patrol the city during a single shift.</p>\n<p>The other sees Cameron County providing “jail services,” with Starbase agreeing to pay $100 per day per inmate and to reimburse the county for additional expenses, like medical care or psychiatric services for inmates.  </p>\n<p>It’s a way of standing up a criminal justice system overnight, without having to build one from scratch. Such arrangements are not unheard of in Texas, especially for the myriad small or newly incorporated towns that may not be able to stand up a full police department on their own.</p>\n<p>But Starbase is not a typical town. The population is small, and most of the residents work for SpaceX. The city itself was finalized only after SpaceX bought up old properties in Boca Chica Village and spread its launch-and-manufacturing activities further afield.</p>\n<p>The law enforcement contract sets up more than just routine patrols. Starbase can also opt to pay for security during “special events” — likely rocket launches, when thousands of spectators descend on the small beach town of Boca Chica to watch Starship’s spectacular flights.</p>\n<div>\n\t\t<p>Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t<p><span>San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>October 27-29, 2025</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n<p>The clause allowing extra police for special events is a shrewd move, and it reinforces the idea that Starbase is not a traditional municipality, but a company town built around one purpose: getting Starship flying — frequently.</p>\n<p>The agreement reinforces this fact. While Starbase has its own mayor and commissioners, public safety is carried out by Cameron County. Body camera footage and other records remain with the county, per the agreement, and Starbase residents who have an issue with the local policing will have to take it up with their next-door neighbors. For now, SpaceX has built a town of its own, but the power to enforce laws is still with someone else.</p>\n</div><div>\n<div>\n\t\t<p>Aria Alamalhodaei covers the space and defense industries at TechCrunch.
