The stock has now seen a 27% increase over the last five trading sessions and a 102% surge in the past month.</p><p><strong>What To Know:</strong> The primary catalyst for Monday’s momentum came from Federal Reserve Chair <strong>Jerome Powell's</strong> address <a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/markets/market-summary/25/08/47289236/markets-today-friday-wall-street-small-caps-powell-interest-rates-jackson-hole\" target=\"_blank\">last week at Jackson Hole</a>. Powell suggested a softening stance on monetary policy, hinting that the central bank could consider cutting interest rates if the economy shows further signs of slowing. </p><p>Lower interest rates typically translate to more affordable mortgages, a critical driver for the housing market and Opendoor’s iBuying business model. Prominent supporters on social media amplified the sentiment, suggesting rate cuts could “unfreeze the housing market.”</p><p>Adding to the bullish sentiment, Opendoor's interim CEO, <strong>Shrishia Radhakrishna</strong>, <a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/trading-ideas/movers/25/08/47269768/opendoor-ceo-embraces-ai-and-retail-investors-thanks-for-believing\" target=\"_blank\">recently expressed</a> strong confidence in the company’s future, centered on an AI-driven, multi-product model. </p><p>In a message to investors, Radhakrishna hailed AI as a “core primitive” for the company’s next phase of growth, detailing its role in optimizing cost structures and enhancing platform efficiency.</p><figure><p><span><span></span><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://editorial-assets.benzinga.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/25101929/Screen-Shot-2025-08-25-at-10.19.18-AM-1024x196.png?optimize=medium&amp;dpr=2&amp;auto=webp&amp;width=2048\" srcset=\"https://editorial-assets.benzinga.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/25101929/Screen-Shot-2025-08-25-at-10.19.18-AM-1024x196.png?optimize=medium&amp;dpr=2&amp;auto=webp&amp;width=1080 1x, https://editorial-assets.benzinga.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/25101929/Screen-Shot-2025-08-25-at-10.19.18-AM-1024x196.png?optimize=medium&amp;dpr=2&amp;auto=webp&amp;width=2048 2x\" /></span></p></figure><p><strong>Price Action:</strong> According to data from <a href=\"https://benzinga.grsm.io/register174\" target=\"_blank\">Benzinga Pro</a>, OPEN shares are trading higher by 8.58% to $5.44 Monday morning.

The company has been making strategic moves to navigate the volatile trade landscape, including absorbing some tariff costs and working with vendors. </p><p>However, the prospect of new, and potentially broader, tariffs threatens to squeeze profit margins and disrupt its supply chain at a time when the company is also navigating a challenging high-end housing market.</p><figure><p><span><span></span><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://editorial-assets.benzinga.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/25095856/Screen-Shot-2025-08-25-at-9.58.33-AM-1024x199.png?optimize=medium&amp;dpr=2&amp;auto=webp&amp;width=2048\" srcset=\"https://editorial-assets.benzinga.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/25095856/Screen-Shot-2025-08-25-at-9.58.33-AM-1024x199.png?optimize=medium&amp;dpr=2&amp;auto=webp&amp;width=1080 1x, https://editorial-assets.benzinga.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/25095856/Screen-Shot-2025-08-25-at-9.58.33-AM-1024x199.png?optimize=medium&amp;dpr=2&amp;auto=webp&amp;width=2048 2x\" /></span></p></figure><p><strong>Price Action:</strong> According to data from <a href=\"https://benzinga.grsm.io/register174\" target=\"_blank\">Benzinga Pro</a>, RH shares are trading lower by 5.44% to $230.46 Monday morning.
