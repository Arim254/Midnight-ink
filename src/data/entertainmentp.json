    "body": "<div><p>\n\tFan interactions are inevitable for a star like Leonardo DiCaprio, the former heartthrob turned permanent Hollywood A-lister, but some are more puzzling than others.</p>\n<p>\n\tThough the Oscar winner is approaching his fourth decade in Hollywood, <em>Variety</em> recently asked him and “<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/one-battle-after-another/\">One Battle After Another</a>” costar Benicio del Toro about which of their films connect with younger audiences — particularly those with a YouTube-and-Tik-Tok-drenched media diet, who might not remember the halcyon days of waiting in line at the cineplex for “Titanic” tickets. \n\t</p>\n<p>\n\tOne particular film, DiCaprio said, seems to resonate with pre-teen kids. It doesn’t make him the most comfortable. \n</p>\n<p>\n\t“We’ve probably both done a lot of R-rated stuff, so it depends on what age you’re talking about,” DiCaprio said of he and del Toro. “Some little kids come up to me and go, ‘I loved <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/wolf-of-wall-street/\">Wolf of Wall Street</a>.’ Like, you saw that? How old are you?” </p>\n<p>\n\tReleased in 2013 and directed by frequent DiCaprio collaborator Martin Scorsese, “Wolf of Wall Street” easily ranks among the most hedonistic films the actor has ever made. Inspired by the true story of disgraced stockbroker Jordan Belfort, “Wolf” is set a cocaine-dusted ’80s where corruption and fraud were best practices in the financial sector. </p>\n<p>\n\tQuaalude-induced paralysis, sunken yachts, orgies, child and property endangerment, Jonah Hill’s prosthetic penis, police shootouts and more abound in the film. It introduced the world to Margot Robbie, earned over $400 million at the worldwide box office and landed five Academy Award nominations.\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\tWhile DiCaprio doesn’t seem to have a shorthand for how to talk to young fans about federal indictments and drug abuse, he concedes: “I saw a lot of R-rated movies when I was young.”</p>\n<p>\n\tNext, the youth of America will digest “One Battle After Another,” Paul Thomas Anderson’s revolutionary epic, which hits theaters Friday.</p>\n</div>"

    "body": "<div><p>\n\t<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/jimmy-kimmel/\">Jimmy Kimmel</a> is coming back nationwide on <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/abc/\">ABC</a> stations across the U.S.</p>\n<p>\n\tTV station group <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/nexstar/\">Nexstar</a> said it will resume airing “Jimmy Kimmel Live!” on its 32 ABC affiliates starting Friday night after it had preempted the show over the late-night host’s comments about Charlie Kirk’s killer. Earlier Friday, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/2025/tv/news/sinclair-resumes-jimmy-kimmel-live-abc-stations-1236530166/\">Sinclair said it was bringing Kimmel back to its 38 ABC stations</a>, also reversing its previous position.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tThe decisions by the two station groups end a short-lived protest by the companies that started last week following Kimmel’s remarks on Monday, Sept. 15. ABC suspended the show Sept. 17 before bringing it back this past Tuesday, where it saw record ratings despite the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/sinclair/\">Sinclair</a>-Nexstar blackout.\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\tDisney made no editorial or content concessions to Sinclair or Nexstar in resolving the standoffs, according to a person familiar with the matter. Disney declined to make execs available for comment.</p>\n<p>\n\tThe return of “Jimmy Kimmel Live!” in all U.S. markets is a victory for Disney and ABC, which had been slammed as having <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/2025/tv/news/disney-shareholders-jimmy-kimmel-suspension-records-legal-threat-1236528997/\">caved in to pressure</a> from the Trump administration in sidelining Kimmel. Disney was targeted with protests and consumer threats to boycott its services (i.e., by canceling Disney+) as well as criticism from Hollywood guilds and others for the perception it wasn’t standing up for First Amendment rights. At the same time, by backing Kimmel, Disney has angered a vocal group of conservatives who feel that the host crossed a bridge too far in his political commentary.</p>\n<p>\n\t“We have had discussions with executives at The Walt Disney Company and appreciate their constructive approach to addressing our concerns,” Nexstar said in a statement. “As a local broadcaster, Nexstar remains committed to protecting the First Amendment while producing and airing local and national news that is fact-based and unbiased and, above all, broadcasting content that is in the best interest of the communities we serve. We stand apart from cable television, monolithic streaming services, and national networks in our commitment — and obligation — to be stewards of the public airwaves and to protect and reflect the specific sensibilities of our communities.”\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\tNexstar added: “To be clear, our commitment to those principles has guided our decisions throughout this process, independent of any external influence from government agencies or individuals.”</p>\n<p>\n\tThe Kimmel controversy kicked into high gear after <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/2025/tv/news/brendan-carr-abc-fcc-jimmy-kimmel-charlie-kirk-1236522406/\">FCC chairman Brendan Carr threatened to pursue “news distortion” complaints against ABC stations</a> unless Kimmel was fired. “We can do this the easy way or the hard way,” Carr said Sept. 17 on a conservative podcast. TV broadcasters, he said, “can find ways to change conduct and take action, frankly, on Kimmel or there’s going to be additional work for the FCC ahead.”</p>\n<p>\n\tNexstar’s decision to black out Kimmel was widely seen as an attempt to get in Carr’s good graces, as it has some immediate business before the agency. In August, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/2025/tv/news/nexstar-acquires-tegna-1236492664/\">Nexstar announced an agreement to acquire Tegna for $6.2 billion</a>, a deal that requires FCC approval; <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/2025/tv/news/nexstar-jimmy-kimmel-suspension-fcc-pressure-1236523812/\">the company denied Carr’s threats influenced its decision</a> to yank Kimmel on the air. Sinclair, too, claimed “Our decision to preempt [‘Jimmy Kimmel Live!’] was independent of any government interaction or influence.”</p>\n<p>\n\tIn announcing it was bringing Kimmel back earlier this week, Disney said the decision to suspend the show was “to avoid further inflaming a tense situation at an emotional moment for our country. It is a decision we made because we felt some of the comments were ill-timed and thus insensitive.” The statement continued, “We have spent the last days having thoughtful conversations with Jimmy, and after those conversations, we reached the decision to return the show on Tuesday,” Sept. 23.</p>\n<p>\n\tIn a memo to staff Friday afternoon, Nexstar CEO Perry Sook and president/COO Mike Biard thanked employees for their patience and said some had faced “hostile and even threatening reactions.”</p>\n<p>\n\t“We recognize that our decision created difficult, and at times distressing, circumstances for many of you — particularly at ABC affiliates. Some of you faced hostile and even threatening reactions. We regret that, but we also know standing by principle requires fortitude and a willingness to take the harder path,” the execs wrote. “As FCC licensees, we take seriously our duty to program in the public interest, even when not everyone agrees.”</p>\n<p>\n\tSook and Biard’s memo continued, “We also want to address questions raised about the First Amendment. No one has an unlimited right to say whatever they want on a talk show. Every network and station has made tough calls when on-air conduct crosses a line. That isn’t a violation of the First Amendment — it’s an exercise of editorial responsibility and stewardship of the public airwaves. As we said in our press release, Nexstar remains committed to protecting the First Amendment, delivering fact-based and unbiased news, and broadcasting content that best serves our communities. These principles guided us throughout this process and will continue to do so.”\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\tIrving, Texas-based Nexstar has 32 ABC-affiliated stations (23 are owned by the company and nine are partner stations it provide services to under joint operating agreements).</p>\n<p>\n\tThose include KTVX (Salt Lake City), WGNO (New Orleans), WTEN (Albany, N.Y.), WSYR (Syracuse, N.Y.), WKRN (Nashville, Tenn.), WATE (Knoxville, Tenn.), WOTV (Battle Creek, Mich.), WHTM (Harrisburg, Pa.), WRIC (Richmond, Va.), WJGF (Augusta, Ga.), KTKA (Topeka, Kan.) and WTNH (Hartford-New Haven, Conn.).</p>\n<p>\n\tIn a Sept. 17 statement, Andrew Alford, president of Nexstar’s broadcasting division, had said: “Mr. Kimmel’s comments about the death of Mr. Kirk are offensive and insensitive at a critical time in our national political discourse, and we do not believe they reflect the spectrum of opinions, views, or values of the local communities in which we are located. Continuing to give Mr. Kimmel a broadcast platform in the communities we serve is simply not in the public interest at the current time, and we have made the difficult decision to preempt his show in an effort to let cooler heads prevail as we move toward the resumption of respectful, constructive dialogue.”</p>\n<p>\n\t<em>— Brian Steinberg contributed to this article.</em></p>\n</div>"

    "body": "<div><p>\n\t<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/netflix/\">Netflix</a> subscribers can get ready to laugh, scream and wonder as a slew of original, returning, and licensed titles land on the platform this October.</p>\n<p>\n\tFor laughs, the month opens with the arrival of all three “Austin Powers” and “Beverly Hills Cop” movies along with a long list of other preexisting properties. The most highly anticipated comedy debut of the month, however, comes on Oct. 23, with the release of “<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/nobody-wants-this/\">Nobody Wants This</a>” Season 2. Adam Brody and Kristen Bell return in the heartwarming rom-com series that first hit Netflix in September 2024.\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\tJust in time for the Halloween season, Netflix is also releasing “Monsters: The Ed Gein Story,” the third season in Ryan Murphy’s true crime anthology series.

    "body": "<div><p>\n\t<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/chase-infiniti/\">Chase Infiniti</a> is living the dream she never <em>fully</em> believed would come true.</p>\n<p>\n\tThe 24-year-old Indianapolis native makes her feature debut in <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/paul-thomas-anderson/\">Paul Thomas Anderson</a>’s “<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/one-battle-after-another/\">One Battle After Another</a>,” stepping into the role of Willa Ferguson, a teenager caught between family legacy and personal identity when a group of ex-revolutionaries reunite to rescue her after an enemy resurfaces 16 years later.\n</p>\n<p>\n\t“It’s half Paul and half me,” Infiniti says of Willa’s character. “Half of her comes from his writing, and the other half I brought from my own life and experiences.”\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\tInfiniti’s path to Anderson’s sprawling militia epic wasn’t straightforward. Raised in Indianapolis, she studied musical theater at Columbia College in Chicago. Despite her passion, she didn’t land many roles in college productions, instead finding opportunities in summer stock and community theaters. “I never thought this would happen. I would’ve been happy with even one line in a movie,” she says, recalling her early dreams.</p>\n<p>\n\tInfiniti introduces herself to Hollywood, and the rest of the cinema loving world on the season 12 premiere of the Variety Awards Circuit Podcast. Listen below.</p>\n<p>\n\tHer name, a mash-up of Nicole Kidman’s Chase Meridian from “Batman Forever” and Pixar’s “Toy Story,” feels oddly prophetic for an actor now stepping into Hollywood’s spotlight.</p>\n<div>\n<figure>\n<p><img srcset=\"https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/MCDONBA_WB019.jpg 3000w, https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/MCDONBA_WB019.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/MCDONBA_WB019.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/MCDONBA_WB019.jpg?resize=1920,1280 1920w, https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/MCDONBA_WB019.jpg?resize=1360,907 1360w, https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/MCDONBA_WB019.jpg?resize=1000,667 1000w, https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/MCDONBA_WB019.jpg?resize=910,607 910w, https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/MCDONBA_WB019.jpg?resize=681,454 681w, https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/MCDONBA_WB019.jpg?resize=450,300 450w, https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/MCDONBA_WB019.jpg?resize=250,167 250w\" src=\"https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/MCDONBA_WB019.jpg?w=1024\" alt=\"\" />\n\t</p>\n<figcaption>\n\t\t\t\t\t<span>Chase Infiniti in “One Battle After Another”</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t©Warner Bros/Courtesy Everett Collection\n\t</figcaption>\n</figure>\n</div>\n<p>\n\tIn “One Battle After Another,” Willa is no stock teenager. With a purple belt in martial arts and a razor-sharp sense of agency, she emerges as one of Anderson’s most compelling young protagonists. “She’s assertive, but not pretentious. She’s hopeful. I think she represents the possibility of a better future,” Infiniti explains.\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\tInfiniti prepared for the role by traveling with Anderson and <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/leonardo-dicaprio/\">Leonardo DiCaprio</a> (who plays her father) to Eureka, Calif. “Meeting people in that town helped me lock Willa in. I noticed how communities interacted, and that grounded her for me.”</p>\n<p>\n\tInfiniti shares the screen with DiCaprio, Regina Hall, Teyana Taylor and two-time Oscar winner Sean Penn. A key sequence with Penn, in which Willa undergoes a tense DNA test, became a lesson in restraint and reactive acting. “It felt like sparring,” she describes. “He’s intimidating, but Paul [Thomas Anderson] encouraged us to lean into that raw, natural reaction. It was exhilarating.”</p>\n<p>\n\tInfiniti is particularly effusive in her admiration for both Hall and Taylor during our sitdown. Speaking about Taylor’s performance, she said she was “so amazing” in bringing the character of Perfidia to life, making her “even more colorful” than what appeared on the page.</p>\n<p>\n\tWhen it came to Hall, Infiniti emphasized how much strength and subtlety she brought to the role of Deandra. “Deandra is a quiet character in a sense, but she’s not quiet,” she asserts. “She really is the most central force of strength that’s in the film, and she does a fantastic job of almost honing in every character and being a mother to Willa — a mother that she never got to have.”</p>\n<p>\n\tDespite the starry company, Infiniti admits she’s still adjusting. “Half of me thought I could be here, half of me thought I couldn’t. I had no industry connections, no on-camera work before this. Paul literally hired me without seeing my first job,” she says. “Now I’m on this press tour and it’s surreal.”</p>\n<p>\n\tInfiniti’s real-life parents, meanwhile, are taking it all in. “My mom cries every time she sees the trailer. There’s a shot of Lockjaw holding Willa’s baby picture and she always says, ‘That’s my baby.’”</p>\n<p>\n\tThough she’s only just arrived, Infiniti is already dreaming of future roles. She’d love to work with Greta Gerwig or Steven Spielberg — and she’s vocal about her passion for movie musicals. “If they ever adapt ‘Natasha, Pierre & The Great Comet of 1812’ into a film, I don’t even need to book it. I just want to be seen for Natasha,” she declares.</p>\n<p>\n\tAs for advice to her younger self, Infiniti borrows wisdom passed down to her: “You have nothing to prove, but everything to show.”\n\t</p>\n<div>\n<figure>\n<p><img srcset=\"https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/MCDONBA_WB020.jpg 3000w, https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/MCDONBA_WB020.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/MCDONBA_WB020.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/MCDONBA_WB020.jpg?resize=1920,1280 1920w, https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/MCDONBA_WB020.jpg?resize=1360,907 1360w, https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/MCDONBA_WB020.jpg?resize=1000,667 1000w, https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/MCDONBA_WB020.jpg?resize=910,607 910w, https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/MCDONBA_WB020.jpg?resize=681,454 681w, https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/MCDONBA_WB020.jpg?resize=450,300 450w, https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/MCDONBA_WB020.jpg?resize=250,167 250w\" src=\"https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/MCDONBA_WB020.jpg?w=1024\" alt=\"\" />\n\t</p>\n<figcaption>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t©Warner Bros/Courtesy Everett Collection\n\t</figcaption>\n</figure>\n</div>\n\t<h4>\n\t\tRapid Fire Questions with Chase Infiniti\t</h4>\n<p>\n\t<strong>Favorite Paul Thomas Anderson film (other than “One Battle After Another”)?<br /></strong>“Boogie Nights.”</p>\n<p>\n\t<strong>Favorite Leonardo DiCaprio performance?<br /></strong>“Catch Me If You Can.”</p>\n<p>\n\t<strong>Favorite Benicio del Toro movie?<br /></strong>“The Usual Suspects.”</p>\n<p>\n\t<strong>Favorite horror film?<br /></strong>“Get Out.” (though she admits she’s a self-described “scaredy cat.”)</p>\n<p>\n\t<strong>Movie that makes you cry every time?<br /></strong>“Toy Story 3.”</p>\n<p>\n\t<strong>Funniest movie of all time?<br /></strong>“One Battle After Another.” (“It’s an action comedy!” she laughs.)</p>\n<p>\n\t<strong>Director you’d most like to work with next?<br /></strong>“Steven Spielberg, Greta Gerwig, or the Daniels.

    "body": "<div><p>\n\t<strong>SPOILER ALERT: This article contains mild spoilers about “<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/the-strangers-chapter-2-2/\">The Strangers – Chapter 2</a></strong>,<strong>” now playing in theaters.</strong></p>\n<p>\n\t“The Strangers – Chapter 2” star <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/madelaine-petsch/\">Madelaine Petsch</a> has proven her Scream Queen bona fides through her performances so far in the planned trilogy. The second film, in theaters now via Lionsgate, finds the actor much more in control after being terrorized by the mysterious title baddies in the first film, a reimagining of the 2008 hit. The sequel opens with Maya (Petsch) wounded in a hospital, mourning the death of her fiancé at the end of last year’s “Chapter 1.” But she can’t sit around healing for too long, as the three masked killers are almost immediately after her again. Instead of running, Maya eventually chooses to stand her ground and fight back. Petsch spoke with <em>Variety</em> about surviving the intense shoot, how she was able to take control as a producer and the upcoming third film that will end Maya’s journey.\n\t</p>\n\t<h5>\n\t\tHow are you able to conjure big emotions like screaming or crying on camera once a scene starts?\t</h5>\n<p>\n\tHonestly, so much of my work happens before I get to set. I spend so much time with the character on the page, really building out how she would respond to certain situations. By the time I get to set and I’m put in that situation, it’s just whatever comes out of me. I think the most important thing for me is to let my mind be blank as Madelaine when I’m going into a character.\n</p>\n\t<h5>\n\t\tAfter running around covered with blood on set all day, do you have a self-care ritual?\t</h5>\n<p>\n\tIt’s so funny, because doing press for the first movie, I didn’t get that question at all, and then for the second, I’ve gotten it so much. It made me realize I have a terrible decompression system. I don’t do anything afterwards, but I barely slept during those movies, and that must be why.\n\t</p>\n\t<h5>\n\t\tFor so much of the film, you’re covered in blood and mud and running for your life. Given that Hollywood is so focused on being glam, is it liberating to shoot with the focus on a different side of your physicality?\t</h5>\n<p>\n\tAbsolutely, it really is, when it’s embraced. I remember on set they’d say, “Add more dirt. Add more blood,” and it was such a free experience. No one cares about what I look like in this movie, they care about if I’m selling what’s going on in the film, and that’s really cool. It was very liberating as an artist to be looked at as that and not as something additive physically.</p>\n\t<h5>\n\t\tAt one point, you have a wild scene fighting for your life against a boar. Did you act opposite an actor in a MoCap suit, or a tennis ball or just use your imagination?\t</h5>\n<p>\n\tOh my God, imagine if it <em>was</em> a tennis ball? Originally, they told me it was nothing. I remember when we first got to Slovakia, I asked, “How do you shoot something like this? I’ve never in my wildest dreams done anything like this,” and they said, “It’s just going to be you.” I said, “That can’t possibly be right, that doesn’t make any sense,” so I eventually convinced them to hire a creature actor. He wasn’t in a MoCap suit; he was in a black version of those green screen suits, basically a black latex suit. He just had eye holes open, but he acted as if he was the animal. He made the sounds and it was so helpful. I genuinely don’t know what I would’ve done if I had to do it alone, which is what the original plan was. There are parts where it’s stepping on me and my body gets lowered … If I didn’t have something there, how am I going to do that?</p>\n<div>\n<figure>\n<p><img srcset=\"https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/MCDSTCH_LG031.jpg 3000w, https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/MCDSTCH_LG031.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/MCDSTCH_LG031.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/MCDSTCH_LG031.jpg?resize=1920,1280 1920w, https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/MCDSTCH_LG031.jpg?resize=1360,907 1360w, https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/MCDSTCH_LG031.jpg?resize=1000,667 1000w, https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/MCDSTCH_LG031.jpg?resize=910,607 910w, https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/MCDSTCH_LG031.jpg?resize=681,454 681w, https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/MCDSTCH_LG031.jpg?resize=450,300 450w, https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/MCDSTCH_LG031.jpg?resize=250,167 250w\" src=\"https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/MCDSTCH_LG031.jpg?w=1024\" alt=\"\" />\n\t</p>\n<figcaption>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t©Lions Gate/Courtesy Everett Collection\n\t</figcaption>\n</figure>\n</div>\n\t<h5>\n\t\tYou’re a producer on these movies, and you’ve held that role on several of your projects before. What kind of control and creativity does that give you beyond acting?\t</h5>\n<p>\n\tIt’s different for every project. I think the blessing of my career so far has been that every time I’ve become a producer on one of these major studio films, it’s been very natural. I’ve been asked to come in and act, and then, as I’ve been on set, they’ve asked me to come on as a producer. So it feels additive, which is really important. For “The Strangers,” that gave me a lot of creative control, which is a blessing and a curse, because I had to really work on being in the editing room specifically and not overanalyzing the way I looked, which is so funny because we were talking about how freeing it was. But then you get in this room with your face on a giant screen and think, “Oh my God, my forehead’s so wrinkly. Do I need to go get Botox?” So it was a lot of self-reflection I had to do when I started editing these films, but there is a lot of creative control that comes with that.</p>\n\t<h5>\n\t\tDo you want to try other jobs behind the camera, like writing or directing?\t</h5>\n<p>\n\tI actually rewrote the “Strangers” films with [producer] Courtney [Solomon] on set, so I definitely have a little bit of a bug for writing. I don’t think I am quite developed enough as a writer to write something from scratch, but I can rewrite fairly well because I think I can go into the character’s perspective, which is how I get into everything. In terms of directing, I have a really big passion for it, but I know I need to gain a lot more knowledge before I do it, so I’m just focusing on acting and building up my production company right now.</p>\n\t<h5>\n\t\tYour character kicks a lot more ass in this movie and fights back against the Strangers. Was that something that was important for you to amp up going into the second film?\t</h5>\n<p>\n\tI think the beautiful thing about these films is that it’s very rare to get the script for three movies at one time that are a trilogy or franchise of films. With this situation, I was able to carve out a very clear character arc for Maya, where she starts as a regular girl on a road trip and she’s in this crazy circumstances and in denial the whole movie. As it progresses, you meet her in this movie, and she is coming to terms with: How much is she willing to do to survive? Can you be pushed past your breaking point? What happens when she is? How much of her humanity is she willing to lose in order to survive? By the third film, you’re in a place where she’s a shell of who she once was, and I think that’s the blessing of shooting all three at once. I was able to carve out a very clear character arc because this situation would absolutely change a person.</p>\n\t<h5>\n\t\tWhat can you tease about the next movie?\t</h5>\n<p>\n\tNumber three takes a turn into territory I never thought a horror movie could go. It plays with a magnetism that you wouldn’t expect, and it becomes almost a question of who <em>really</em> is the antagonist of this film?\n\t</p>\n\t<h5>\n\t\tOn Oct. 8, you have a rom-com headed to Amazon Prime Video called “<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6WSAUKWt7ho\" target=\"_blank\">Maintenance Required</a>.” Given that you see so many scripts, what about this one stood out to you?\t</h5>\n<p>\n\tI really love my character, Charlie. I think she’s magnificent because she’s really passionate about one thing, which is car mechanics. She’s completely oblivious to almost everything else going on in the world, including love. I think it’s really charming to see a film like this where usually a man who says, “I don’t care about love” and “I just care about cars” and the girl’s like, “Love me back!” In this situation, it’s opposite, and I think that’s really wonderful. Also, that’s a muscle I haven’t really gotten to tap much is the comedic, sweet muscle. As an actor, variety really is the spice of life. So it was the perfect storm of what I was itching to do in the moment, and Charlie being such a magnetic character and being so stuck in her ways and unique and strong, and the creative team being wonderful. It was a dream.</p>\n<p>\n\tWatch the “Strangers – Chapter 2” trailer below.</p>\n<figure><p>\n<iframe width=\"500\" height=\"281\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/_d55K72DoKg?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\"></iframe>\n</p></figure>\n</div>"

    "body": "<div><p>\n\t<strong>SPOILER ALERT: </strong><em>This story discusses major plot developments in Season 2, Episode 6 of “<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/peacemaker/\">Peacemaker</a>,” currently streaming on HBO Max. </em></p>\n<p>\n\tIn Season 2 of “Peacemaker,” the titular shoot-first-ask-questions-later hero Christopher Smith (John Cena) has been enchanted by an alternate universe in which he had never accidentally killed his older brother when they were kids. On <em>this</em> Earth, Chris, his brother Keith, aka Captain Triumph (David Denman), and their father Auggie, aka Blue Dragon (Robert Patrick), aren’t just a happy family, but a trio of beloved superheroes. The alternative version of the love of Chris’ life, Emilia Harcourt (Jennifer Holland), is emotionally well-adjusted and capable of maintaining a romantic relationship. Life seems so great on this alt-Earth, and Chris’ own life seems so terrible, that at the end of Episode 5, he abandons his world and chooses to move to the alternate one. (It helps that Chris already killed his alt-Earth doppelgänger in Episode 1.)\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd yet, for many viewers, something about this world has always felt…off — and not just because Cheerios is spelled Cheeri-ohs. In Episode 6, “Ignorance Is Chris,” we finally learn just <em>how</em> off, after Harcourt, Adebayo (Danielle Brooks), Vigilante (Freddie Stroma) and Economos (Steve Agee) — who call themselves the 11th Street Kids — all venture into the alt-Earth to convince their Peacemaker to come home. (Because this is “Peacemaker,” en route, they wind up getting splattered with Vigilante’s stash of recovered contraband cocaine.)\n</p>\n<p>\n\tOnce they arrive, they quickly get split up. Harcourt convinces Keith to take her to A.R.G.U.S. headquarters, where en route, she begins to notice that there are no people of color anywhere in town. Vigilante is delighted to find his alt-Earth doppelgänger, who is exactly like him in every conceivable way except one: Alt-Vigilante calls Peacemaker his “archenemy.” Meanwhile, Adebayo and Economos stay behind at the Smith family compound with no clear sense of what to do, so Adebayo decides to explore the neighborhood. As she walks around, people stare at her in shock and disgust, until Keith passes by, slams on his breaks, and screams, “One got out! A Black!” Adebayo starts running for her life as a mob of Nazi Americans chase after her.\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\tAt this same moment, Peacemaker — after he and Harcourt finally have a tearful heart-to-heart about their feelings for each other — takes a closer look at the American flags that line the desks at alt-A.R.G.U.S. To his horror, he discovers that, instead of stars, there’s a swastika. On this Earth — which, like in the DC comics, “Peacemaker” creator and DC Studios co-chief <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/james-gunn/\">James Gunn</a> refers to as “Earth X” — Nazi Germany won World War II.</p>\n<p>\n\tGunn, who wrote and directed the episode, guarded this twist so closely that he declined to send it out to press for advance review. But he did do his own private test screenings of Season 2 to see if anyone noticed that Earth X was populated only with white people before the big reveal in Episode 6.</p>\n<p>\n\t“No one noticed at all,” he tells <em>Variety</em>. “And that was people of color, too, by the way. It wasn’t just, you know, the whites.”</p>\n<p>\n\tThe internet being the internet, however, some fans had correctly guessed this twist was coming after sharing Harcourt’s observation about the population’s whiteness — matched with the fact that on the main Earth, Auggie was a virulent white supremacist known as the White Dragon. </p>\n<p>\n\t“It’s really hard when you’re online and one person out of the millions of people that are watching the show says, ‘Wait a second, here’s a screenshot of what it’s like in the alternate world, and here’s a screenshot of the background actors in the DCU,’ and you see the difference between them immediately,” he says. “A lot of people don’t go online to talk about television. So I got a lot of comments of people that were freaked out. But a lot of people knew it was coming.”</p>\n<p>\n\tGunn talked with <em>Variety</em> about the experience of shooting this episode during the 2024 presidential election, why he brought Lex Luthor (Nicholas Hoult) onto the show, why <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/superman/\">Superman</a> won’t join him and how Lex’s cameo connects to <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/2025/film/news/superman-sequel-man-of-tomorrow-lex-luthor-team-up-1236514155/\">the 2027 feature film “Superman: Man of Tomorrow.”</a></p>\n\t<h5>\n\t\tSo, Nazis.\t</h5>\n<p>\n\tSo, Nazis!</p>\n\t<h5>\n\t\tCould you talk about how you decided to hide this twist sort of in plain sight? It seems like you wanted to put the audience in Peacemaker’s mindset?\t</h5>\n<p>\n\tIn very <em>plain</em> sight! You know, Peacemaker is not a bad guy. He’s not a racist, but he does have this sort of narcissistic tendency to judge moments based on how <em>he’s</em> being treated and judged. He’s able to go to this other planet and not notice at all that, “Hey, wait a second…” I mean, you think <em>we’re</em> blind for not noticing it on a TV show with clips that are 30 seconds long; he didn’t notice it walking and driving around that everybody was white. Whereas Harcourt, who’s more attentive to details, and probably more sensitive to that sort of thing anyway, notices the minute she’s out in public. She’s looking around, going, “What the fuck?”\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\tBut part of it is <em>us</em>, you know? Honest to God, I don’t think I would have noticed if I was in a bubble and not talking to people online about the show. And I think that is something that we maybe can all think about.</p>\n\t<h5>\n\t\tYou said on the official “Peacemaker” podcast about this episode that the first scene outside of Vigilante’s house was shot on Halloween of 2024. How present in your mind was the presidential election while you were shooting this episode and the episodes that are to come?\t</h5>\n<p>\n\tI shot the scene where the cocaine splashes over everyone the morning after the presidential election. But when I’m writing a show like this, I am telling a story, first and foremost. I’m never thinking, “Oh, I’ve got to prove a point about something.” But undoubtedly, there are things from our actual world that influence what I’m writing. Obviously, Adebayo’s situation at the end of the episode, from one perspective, is the most important thing. But at the end of the day, the show is about the 11th Street Kids and their relationships with each other and what they get from each other and how they change each other. Probably the biggest scene in the show was the scene between Peacemaker and Harcourt in the interrogation room. In a lot of ways, that’s the heart of the show. It isn’t about Earth X. It’s about them. </p>\n<p>\n\tAnd people are also going to find out next episode, that Earth X is not simplistic. If we were raised in Nazi world and accepted that as being OK, how would you think? We get a little bit more of that with specific characters next episode. </p>\n\t<h5>\n\t\tSpeaking about the next episode, Rick Flag Sr. (Frank Grillo) visits Lex Luthor in Belle Reve prison and strikes a deal with him in exchange for help finding Peacemaker. Should we expect to see David Corenswet as the Earth X or Earth 1 versions of Superman on the show?\t</h5>\n<p>\n\tNo. In fact, David was very upset that Nick got to be on the show, and he didn’t. It just didn’t work. I needed Lex in the show to serve a specific purpose. And actually, what Lex and Rick Flag are up to affects very much what happens in an aspect of “Man of Tomorrow.” So all of that is connected. But this relationship between Rick Flag and Lex Luthor is a potentially negative thing for Superman and all meta-humans.</p>\n\t<h5>\n\t\tYou were writing this season while you were also working on “Superman,” so did you know where you wanted to take the Lex storyline for “Man of Tomorrow” already?\t</h5>\n<p>\n\tTotally, yeah. I didn’t know some things about it, but I knew what the overall story of the DCU was. That was something I pitched to [Warner Bros. Discovery CEO] David Zaslav before we even took the job. I’m like, here’s the story. There’s going to be this movie, this show, this movie, this show, and those things all fit in in different ways. Some things came, like “Clayface,” that we didn’t expect, and other things have been a harder road to travel. But the general outline of that overall story is what we are following through “Superman,” “Peacemaker,” “Man of Tomorrow” and beyond.\n\t</p>\n\t<h5>\n\t\tHow much of Earth X will play a role in the DCU moving forward?\t</h5>\n<p>\n\tNot much. It’s not a major part of the storytelling. That’s about Peacemaker.</p>\n\t<h5>\n\t\tTo go back to my earlier question, you obviously wrote this show not knowing what the outcome of the presidential election was going to be. But how has it been for you, knowing that this twist was coming, and watching the real world edge closer to Earth X more than anybody would have anticipated?\t</h5>\n<p>\n\t<em>[Long pause] </em>I think I don’t know how to answer the question. Obviously, there are many things in the world I’m not happy with. I’m not so narcissistic as to think of the world in relationship to my TV show. I mean, there’s weird things with this show. There were weird things with “Superman.” Absolutely 100% of that movie was written and done before anything ever happened between Israel and Palestine, and everyone continues to refuse to believe that that’s not what it’s about. It’s not. It just isn’t. You can take whatever you want from that, to mean what you want, but I didn’t write it to be a stand in for Israel and Palestine. </p>\n\t<h5>\n\t\tDo you feel the same way about this season of “Peacemaker”?\t</h5>\n<p>\n\tI mean, you’ll see some things next episode where, of course, there’s parallels. We’ve seen more racism lately, right? Is that because there’s more racism or because it’s more OK to be out in the open? It’s probably the latter. That’s obviously fucking discouraging. And if my stupid TV show has anything to do with people being like, “Oh, maybe I should be more aware of my prejudices,” great. But that isn’t what I write the show for. I write the show for the emotional angle, just like I wrote “Superman” to be about kindness. If there was a sociopolitical aspect of “Superman,” it’s that there has been an absence of kindness and understanding and loving a human being, no matter what their thoughts or feelings are. </p>\n<p>\n\tEverybody’s a fucking antihero. Everybody’s too fucking cool. What about <em>not</em> being cool? What about being a nice human being to someone? Why is that considered old-fashioned and Pollyanna? I want to be Pollyanna. I love that aspect of myself. I believe in the goodness of the human spirit. I think a lot of the people that are doing things I don’t like, I think that they are essentially good people. They just have weird ideas about things, and I think that we can communicate with those people. Maybe I’m naive, I don’t know, but that’s who I am.\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\t<em>This interview has been edited and condensed.</em></p>\n</div>"
