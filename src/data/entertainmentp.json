    "body": "<div><p>\n\tWho are the GOATs — the greatest of all time — deserving the honor of being chiseled into Mount Rushmore? Hollywood power agent and dealmaker <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/ari-emanuel/\">Ari Emanuel</a> has launched a new podcast, “Rushmore,” with friend and music manager Ben Persky in which they argue about the all-time GOATs in various categories.</p>\n<p>\n\t“Rushmore” premieres Sept. 30 exclusively on <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/x/\">X</a>, the social platform controlled by <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/elon-musk/\">Elon Musk</a>, who’s friends with Emanuel. According to Emanuel, the idea for the podcast originated when he was on vacation recently with Musk: “We had a conversation about the ‘Rushmore of meals’ — what would your last meal be?” Musk himself will be a guest on an upcoming episodes. (<em>Watch the trailer below.</em>)\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\tEmanuel teamed up with Persky for the podcast because “every time we go on vacation together, we get into these verbal fights” over the greatest this or that in different areas. “It always ends with, ‘You’re an idiot’ — ‘No, you’re an idiot.'” \n</p>\n<p>\n\t“To be candid, I just wanted to prove to Ben that I’m always right,” Emanuel jokes. He says the “Rushmore” podcast is “where the GOAT game we all love gets real, played each week by some of the biggest names in culture,” adding dramatically: “This is where legends — and egos — collide.”</p>\n<p>\n\tWhy is it exclusively on X? Besides Emanuel’s friendship with the tech mogul, Persky says that “X is kind of naturally an ecosystem that facilitates conversation, especially for ‘best of’ kinds of debates. We hope this will continue to be a conversation for a long time.”</p>\n<p>\n\tNote that on the actual Mount Rushmore National Memorial in South Dakota, there’s <a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/politics-news/donald-trump-mount-rushmore-no-room-stone-rcna227086\" target=\"_blank\">literally no physical room for another face</a>. Nevertheless, MAGA supporters have pushed seemingly serious efforts to have <a href=\"https://www.congress.gov/bill/119th-congress/house-bill/792\" target=\"_blank\">President Trump carved into the façade</a>.\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\tThe “Rushmore” podcast series will be available on the <a href=\"https://x.com/RushmoreOnX\" target=\"_blank\">@RushmoreOnX</a> and <a href=\"https://x.com/AriEmanuel\" target=\"_blank\">@AriEmanuel accounts X</a>, with new episodes to be released weekly each Tuesday. Emanuel and Persky have recorded 10 episodes and “we’ll do another 10 at the beginning of next year,” says Emanuel. “Then we’ll look at each other and see if it continues.”</p>\n<p>\n\tIn each episode, Emanuel and Persky are joined in the debate by two experts in the given field (with the only rule being they can’t be eligible to be GOATs in the category). After the duo inked the deal with X, under which they will receive a share of ad revenue, they started “calling people in our Rolodexes — and it just started happening,” Emanuel says.</p>\n<p>\n\tGuests in the first 10-episode batch of “Rushmore” include Elon Musk, Tom Brady, Peyton Manning, Bobby Kotick, Shaquille O’Neal, Reggie Miller, Rick Rubin, Jimmy Iovine, Bob Costas, Al Michaels, Doris Kearns Goodwin, Jon Meacham, Jeff Koons, Jeffrey Deitch, Inez Van Lamsweerde and Edward Enninful.</p>\n<p>\n\tTopics on the podcast span sports, entertainment, media, fashion, music, gaming and more. Some of the categories “Rushmore” to be debated include: movie villains, bands, pro-football wide receivers, video games, models, music artists, painters, rivalries and “sports chokes” (the last of which features Costas and Michaels).</p>\n<p>\n\tWhile Emanuel, currently chairman of WME Group and CEO of TKO Group, is a powerful figure in the entertainment biz, he’s not exactly a social-media star. His account on X (formerly Twitter) has about 10,000 followers currently — and it appears he has posted only a handful of times on the platform, most recently in a <a href=\"https://x.com/AriEmanuel/status/1972634655771009037\" target=\"_blank\">post</a> Monday touting TKO’s deal with Paramount Skydance for Zuffa Boxing rights.</p>\n<p>\n\tMeanwhile, recall that in 2022 Emanuel texted Musk with <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/2023/digital/news/ari-emanuel-twitter-musk-rejected-insulting-insane-book-1235724599/\">an offer for Endeavor to take over managing Twitter for a $100 million fee</a>, according to Walter Isaacson biography of the techno-titan. According to Isaacson’s book, Jared Birchall, the managing director of the entity housing Musk’s financial assets, called Emanuel’s text “the most insulting, demeaning, insane message.”</p>\n<p>\n\t“Rushmore” is produced by “The Pat McAfee Show” with support from Pantheon Media Group. Persky said he and Emaneul wanted to work with McAfee “because he does social so well…. he has very natural and clear thoughts about the cadence [of a podcast] and when to put stuff out.”\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\tMitchell Smith, X’s head of original content, said in a statement, “As the world’s group chat, X is the platform for declaring and debating what truly defines greatness, which makes ‘Rushmore’ a perfect fit for X Originals. As someone who began their career in the WME mailroom, I have a full appreciation for the prowess of Ari Emanuel, and we couldn’t be more excited to collaborate with him and Ben Persky on their first project in front of the camera.”</p>\n<p>\n\tEmanuel co-founded talent agency Endeavor in 1995 and was CEO of the company until earlier this year after <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/2025/biz/news/endeavor-goes-private-changes-name-wme-ari-emanuel-ceo-1236346250/\">it went private in a transaction with Silver Lake</a>. He now serves as executive chairman of WME Group, the public-facing name of Endeavor Group Holdings. He also is CEO and executive chair of TKO Group, the parent of WWE and UFC whose formation was facilitated by Endeavor. In addition, Emanuel remains an active agent for such big-name WME clients as Martin Scorsese, Larry David, Pete Berg and Mark Wahlberg. (WME also reps Jimmy Kimmel; Emanuel declined to discuss <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/2025/tv/news/disney-shareholders-jimmy-kimmel-suspension-records-legal-threat-1236528997/\">the controversy that the late-night host</a>.)</p>\n<p>\n\tOther podcasts on X include <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/2025/digital/news/serena-venus-williams-video-podcast-x-twitter-1236424663/\">“Stockton Street,” hosted by tennis champions and siblings Venus and Serena Williams</a>, which premiered Sept. 17. It debuted exclusively on X before becoming available a day later on other audio platforms.</p>\n<p>\n\tX’s lineup of more than two dozen podcasts also includes Khloe Kardashian’s “Khloé in Wonder Land,” “Inside the NFL” from NFL Films, and “From the Desk of Anthony Pompliano.”</p>\n<p>\n\tWatch the trailer for “Rushmore”:</p>\n<figure></figure>\n</div>"

But we loved making every single one of them. We’re gonna miss our very special show. Thanks to everyone who watched.”</p>\n<p>\n\tThe multi-cam comedy series originally debuted in March. Nathan Lane, Matt Bomer, Nathan Lee Graham, and Linda Lavin led the cast, although <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/2024/tv/news/linda-lavin-dead-alice-tony-winner-1236261740/\">Lavin passed away in December 2024</a> ahead of the series premiere. \n\t</p>\n<p>\n\tThe official logline states that the show, “follows three best friends — gay gentlemen of a certain age – who, after an unexpected death, decide to spend their golden years living together in Palm Springs where the wealthiest one lives with his mother. As a chosen family, they prove that no matter how hard things get, there’s always someone around to remind you it would be better if you got your neck done.”</p>\n<p>\n\tMutchnick and David Kohan, who previously created “Will & Grace,” co-created the series and served as executive producers, with Ryan Murphy also executive producing. Lane and Bomer were executive producers in addition to starring. James Burrows executive produced and directed all 10 episodes. 20th Television was the studio. </p>\n<p>\n\t“Mid-Century Modern” received mostly positive reviews upon its release, with the show maintaining an 88% critical approval rating on Rotten Tomatoes. It failed to find a significant audience, it seems. Hulu does not typically release viewership information, but the show did not make an appearance in the Nielsen Top 10 streaming charts, which measures streaming viewership. </p>\n</div>"

    "body": "<div><p>\n\t<strong>Warner Chappell Music</strong>, the music publishing arm of Warner Music Group, today announced the signing of <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/eagles/\">Eagles</a> founding member <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/bernie-leadon/\">Bernie Leadon</a> to a long-term, worldwide publishing agreement. </p>\n<p>\n\t “I have been associated with Warner Chappell and the rest of Warner Music since 1971,” said Leadon in a statement. “I am delighted to renew my connections with them now at this point in the 21st Century. Warner Chappell and Warner Music have always been at the pinnacle of support for songwriters and other music creators, and that reality is still very evident in the current leadership and staff. My sincere thanks go to all of them.”\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\tThe Rock and Roll Hall of Famer is slated to release his first solo album in more than two decades,” Too Late to Be Cool,” on Oct. 10. Most recently, Leadon was a headliner at the AmericanaFest in Nashville, Tennessee.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tWCM’s Guy Moot, Co-Chair and CEO, and Carianne Marshall, Co-Chair and COO, said: “It’s no exaggeration to say that much of the music we call Americana today owes a deep debt to Bernie’s boundary-crossing inspiration. He has helped shape a canon of iconic music, from his early years with genre-defying groups like The Flying Burrito Brothers and Dillard & Clark to his generation-defining work with the Eagles to his countless collaborations with other artists. His creativity, musical brilliance, and pure devotion to his craft have made him a true American treasure, with six decades of extraordinary songs and sounds to his credit. We’re honored and excited to welcome him into the Warner Chappell family.”</p>\n<p>\n\tGreg Sowders, SVP, A&R and Catalog, WCM added: “As a master musician, songwriter and member of the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, Bernie inspired me to start my first real band. And now as his music publisher, I continue to be inspired by his writing and playing, particularly by his new album Too Late To Be Cool. His legend continues.”\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\t+ <strong>A2IM</strong> (The American Association of Independent Music), today announces that <strong>Ian Harrison </strong>has been appointed as chief executive officer effective Oct. 1. Harrison succeeds Dr. Richard James Burgess, who will step down at the end of this year. </p>\n<p>\n\tHarrison brings more than 20 years of leadership in the independent music sector, most recently as executive VP of Hopeless Records. Over two decades, he helped transform the label from a small independent into a globally recognized powerhouse. His work as part of the Hopeless Foundation (Sub City) has raised over 3.5 million dollars for a variety of music and mental health charities.</p>\n<p>\n\tIn addition to his label leadership, Harrison has been a longstanding contributor to A2IM and the broader indie community. He has been actively involved with A2IM since 2012 as an Indie Week committee member, five-time speaker and mentor. </p>\n<p>\n\t“The independent community is stronger and more dynamic than ever, yet also facing accelerating challenges that will test our resilience and adaptability. A2IM exists to ensure our members can grow independently in the face of these changes and thrive on their own terms.</p>\n<p>\n\t+ <strong>Carlos “Charly” Pérez</strong> has announced the launch of <strong>Studio VII</strong>, his new firm specializing in communications, public relations, entertainment, as well as the production of experiences and events. The project launches alongside an active strategic alliance with Warner Music Latina, focused on developing new talent and strengthening the company’s artist roster. This collaboration remains non-exclusive, allowing room for new opportunities and partnerships.</p>\n<p>\n\tThe firm is based in the United States, Puerto Rico and is also operating across Mexico, the rest of Latin America and Spain. Studio VII supports artists, brands, and cultural projects from concept to execution, delivering high-impact campaigns, customized events and strategic activations in key markets. </p>\n<p>\n\t“Studio VII represents a new professional chapter that allows me to continue developing projects through an independent structure, while maintaining my collaboration with Warner Music Latina on strategic initiatives,” said Pérez. </p>\n<p>\n\t+ <strong>Communities In Schools of Tennessee </strong>(CISTN) today recognized <strong>Creative Artists Agency</strong> (CAA) and the <strong>Scarlett Family Foundation</strong> for their long-standing support at its “All in For Kids” fundraising breakfast.\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\tCAA, the world’s leading entertainment and sports agency, received the “All in For Kids Award,” which recognizes a CISTN supporter or organization that has generously given time and resources to significantly advance the nonprofit’s mission to ensure all students have the support they need to succeed in school and in life. John Huie, music agent and founding partner of CAA Nashville, accepted the award on behalf of the agency.</p>\n<p>\n\t“20 years ago, our CAA Nashville founders not only recognized but acted upon the importance of leading and providing support for initiatives aimed at creating a more resilient and equitable public education system in Nashville,” said Colby Gallahar, manager, CAA Foundation. “Through our partnership with CISTN, we remain committed to volunteering time and resources to ensure students are provided with the best education possible, protecting their dreams of becoming future community leaders, educators, first responders, and more!”</p>\n<p>\n\tThe Scarlett Family Foundation was recognized with the Alice Chapman Advocacy Award, named in honor of the leadership and legacy of the late Alice Chapman, a member of CISTN’s founding task force who went on to serve as chair of the board. Tara Scarlett, the immediate past chair of CISTN’s board, accepted the award on behalf of her family.</p>\n</div>"

It took the special jury prize at the Transilvania International Film Festival.\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\tPer the film’s logline, “Objects of the Field of Debris as Currently Catalogued” stars Julian Castronovo as a filmmaker named Julian Castronovo (though not quite playing himself), plummeting into a digital conspiracy rabbit hole as he investigates the disappearance of an art forger. The film was inspired by the case of New York art dealer Ely Sakhai, who currently operates a gallery after being convicted of forgery and sentenced to 41 months in prison.\n</p>\n<p>\n\t“In some ways, it was a very difficult film to make. And in other ways, it was very easy. I basically made the entire thing sitting at my desk in my bedroom,” Castronovo <a href=\"https://filmmakermagazine.com/people/julian-castronovo/\" target=\"_blank\">told Filmmaker Magazin</a>e speaking about his debut, which was produced for just $900.</p>\n<p>\n\t“Debut” will release in Castronovo’s local Los Angeles at Now Instant Image Hall on Oct. 17. A New York bow will follow on Oct. 25 at Roxy Cinema. From there, the indie will expand to more locations, with dates to be announced. \n\t</p>\n<p>\n\tWatch the trailer below.</p>\n<figure><p>\n<iframe width=\"500\" height=\"281\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/36XLkkBFRSA?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\"></iframe>\n</p></figure>\n</div>"

    "body": "<div><p>\n\t<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/guillermo-del-toro/\">Guillermo del Toro</a>, who was named this year’s artistic director at the AFI Fest, has revealed the films that he has selected to screen as part of his curated program.</p>\n<p>\n\tAmong the films are Stanley Kubrick’s “Barry Lyndon,” Federico Fellini’s “Casanova,” Pupi Avati’s “Arcane Sorcerer” and Ridley Scott’s “The Duellists.”</p>\n<p>\n\tDel Toro will present the four films on Oct. 25 at The Egyptian Theatre.\n</p>\n<p>\n\t“Guillermo del Toro is one of the great champions of the art form — a visionary filmmaker, a passionate cinephile, and a tireless advocate for bold, original storytelling,” said Bob Gazzale, AFI President and CEO. “As Guest Artistic Director of AFI FEST, he brings a singular perspective that will inspire audiences of all generations.”\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\tInformation on the films is below.</p>\n<p>\n\t<strong>“Barry Lyndon” – 50th Anniversary – New 4K Restoration</strong></p>\n<p>\n\tNotable for writer and director Stanley Kubrick’s painstaking evocation of 18th-century life, including the nighttime scenes illuminated only by candlelight, “Barry Lyndon” — which marks its 50th anniversary this year — is a must-see on the big screen. The callow striver Redmond Barry is played by 1970s heartthrob Ryan O’Neal, in one of his best performances, a reluctant conscript in the British army after leaving his Irish home in disgrace. On the frontlines on the continent, events lead first to Barry’s desertion, then his re-enlistment on the victorious Prussian side; he continues to try his luck in a series of palace intrigues, high-stakes gambling and the strategic seduction of a noblewoman (Marisa Berenson). The film earned seven Academy Award nominations and won four — Best Cinematography, Art Direction, Costume Design and Music.\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\t<strong>“Casanova”-  4K Digital Restoration</strong></p>\n<p>\n\tFederico Fellini’s infamous 1976 take on Giacomo Casanova’s tale is a lavish, hallucinatory reimagining of the legendary Venetian seducer’s life — less historical portrait than fever-dream-induced baroque fantasia. Originally envisioned as a major international production with an American star (Marlon Brando, Al Pacino, Robert Redford and Paul Newman were all considered), the role ultimately went to Donald Sutherland, whose haunting and stylized performance anchors the film’s surreal tone. Far from a romantic hero, Fellini’s “Casanova” is a tragic, melancholy figure moving through a grotesque and dreamlike Europe — one built entirely on the massive soundstages of Cinecittà Studios in Rome. Drawing only loosely from Casanova’s own memoirs, Fellini instead filters the character through his recurring cinematic obsessions — artifice, desire and the absurd theater of sex — as Casanova’s encounters span the bizarre and fantastical, from noblewomen to acrobats, a giantess, a dwarf and even a life-size automaton. Co-written with longtime collaborator Bernardino Zapponi and produced by Alberto Grimaldi, Fellini’s “Casanova” is a visual and sonic spectacle, with striking production design and an unforgettable score by Nino Rota. The result is one of Fellini’s most ambitious and divisive works.</p>\n<p>\n\t<strong>“Arcane Sorcerer”</strong></p>\n<p>\n\tBanished from seminary school after a sacrilegious scandal, young student Giacomo (Stefano Dionisi) flees Bologna seeking refuge. He finds favor with an elderly woman who directs him to a remote countryside villa, home to an excommunicated monsignor (Carlo Cecchi) with a penchant for the occult. In need of a new assistant after his last one died under mysterious circumstances, Giacomo reluctantly becomes the sorcerer’s apprentice. Forced to participate in increasingly macabre rituals and tests, Giacomo is consumed by the sinister — as apparitions, ghosts and deadly rumors start to accumulate. A richly atmospheric, spiritual horror film, “Arcane Sorcerer” is magnificently crafted by Italian journeyman filmmaker Pupi Avati, best known for “Zeder.” A personal favorite of Guillermo del Toro and described by filmmaker Edgar Wright as “the ‘Barry Lyndon’ of horror films,” this rarely seen cult classic will surprise and delight fans of fantastic cinema.\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\t<strong>“The Duellists” – 35mm Print</strong></p>\n<p>\n\tRidley Scott’s striking Cannes prize-winning debut feature is a visually arresting tale of honor, obsession and pride. Set against the backdrop of the Napoleonic wars, “The Duellists” chronicles the 16-year feud between two French officers — cool-headed Armand d’Hubert (Keith Carradine) and hot-blooded Gabriel Feraud (Harvey Keitel) — after a perceived personal slight leads to an escalating series of duels, each more intense yet more meaningless than the last. Adapted from Joseph Conrad’s novella “The Duel,” Scott’s timeless portrait of interpersonal war explores how codes of masculine honor can curdle into obsession, consuming lives as empires rise and fall. With its meticulous attention to detail and the dazzling Baroque-style visuals of cinematographer Frank Tidy — evoking candlelit interiors and fog-drenched battlefields that rival Stanley Kubrick’s “Barry Lyndon in their visual elegance.</p>\n<p>\n\tPrevious Guest Artistic Directors for AFI FEST include Pedro Almodóvar, Bernardo Bertolucci, Ava DuVernay, Greta Gerwig, David Lynch and Agnès Varda.</p>\n<p>\n\t<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/2025/film/festivals/springsteen-deliver-me-from-nowhere-afi-fest-1236495185/\">As previously announced</a>, this year’s festival will open with “Springsteen: <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/deliver-me-from-nowhere/\">Deliver Me From Nowhere</a>” is set to open AFI Fest on Oct. 22. “Song Sung Blue” starring Hugh Jackman and Kate Hudson, will have its world premiere at <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/afi-fest/\">AFI Fest</a> on Oct. 26.

    "body": "<div><p>\n\t<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/ariana-grande/\">Ariana Grande</a> received a direct statement from the White House after the pop singer called out supporters of the Trump administration. </p>\n<p>\n\tOn Sunday night, Grande reshared a post to her <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/stories/arianagrande/\" target=\"_blank\">Instagram</a> that criticized the Trump administration for its ongoing ICE raids and transphobic rhetoric, as well as other threats to democracy. </p>\n<p>\n\tThe post was written by activist Matt Bernstein as a “check-in” for Trump supporters. The paragraph concludes with the following question: “It’s been 250 days. Now that immigrants have been violently torn from their families and communities have been destroyed, now that trans people have been blamed for virtually everything and live in fear, now that free speech is on the brink of collapse for us all — has your life gotten better?”\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\tIn a statement provided to <a href=\"https://ew.com/ariana-grande-calls-out-donald-trump-supporters-white-house-responds-11820681?taid=68dad11fd54062000170e960&utm_campaign=trueAnthem%3A+New+Content+%28Feed%29&utm_medium=trueAnthem&utm_source=twitter\" target=\"_blank\">Entertainment Weekly</a>, White House Deputy Press Secretary Kush Desai responded to Grande directly. The statement utilized Grande’s song titles — including “Save Your Tears,” “Just Like Magic” and “Get Well Soon.” </p>\n<p>\n\t“Save your tears, Ariana. Because President Trump’s actions ended Joe Biden’s inflation crisis and are bringing in trillions in new investment,” Desai said. </p>\n<p>\n\t“He even signed an executive order just like magic that paved the way for the FTC to crack down on Ticketmaster for ripping off Ariana Grande’s concert-going fans. Get well soon, Ariana!”</p>\n<p>\n\tDesai makes reference to the Federal Trade Commission’s recent <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/2025/music/news/ftc-sues-ticketmaster-live-nation-unfair-ticket-practices-1236523547/\">lawsuit </a>aimed at Live Nation and Ticketmaster that claims the entities misled consumers about resale ticket prices. This suit comes a month after it sued a ticket resale company Key Investment Group and affiliated companies including Epic Seats and Totally Tix LLC, alleging that it used illegal methods to secure tickets and resell them at inflated rates for popular concerts, including Taylor Swift’s “Eras” tour.\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\tGrande supported Democratic nominee Kamala Harris during the 2024 presidential election.

    "body": "<div><p>\n\tIt’s a busy start to the week for <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/donald-trump/\">Donald Trump</a>. On Monday, the president sat down at the White House with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, hoping to persuade him to embrace his plan to end the war in Gaza. Later that same afternoon, he met with the top four leaders in Congress, looking to reach a deal to fund the government and avert a shutdown before a Sept. 30 deadline. And yet as the morning began, Trump took to social media with a fresh wave of threats to impose tariffs on films made outside the U.S.\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\tOn Truth Social, the president wrote that the “movie making business has been stolen from the United States of America, by other Countries, just like stealing ‘candy from a baby’,” adding that he would be “imposing a 100% Tariff on any and all movies that are made outside the U.S.”\n</p>\n<p>\n\tStudios and streamers were caught off-guard by the missive. The White House had made no effort to contact them or the Motion Picture Association ahead of the announcement, which mirrors an earlier threat that Trump made last May. They are still uncertain about how to respond to Trump’s message and remain privately skeptical that he will make good on his promise, noting that the president dropped the subject last spring amid questions about how a tariff would be imposed on a film, which is a “service” and not a “good” like cars, steel, aluminum and other things that are subject to new tariffs. </p>\n<p>\n\t“He’s the president, so you have to treat it seriously, but people are mostly just confused by this,” said one studio executive. </p>\n<p>\n\tThe Motion Picture Association declined to comment, but sources said a board meeting was already scheduled for Tuesday. Trump’s tariffs are expected to be on the agenda as <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/mpa/\">MPA</a> board members and entertainment leaders like Disney’s Alan Bergman, Amazon MGM’s Mike Hopkins and NBCUniversal’s Donna Langley convene for a quarterly discussion. Members of the studio’s government relations teams were expected to speak at some point on Monday, according to one studio source, who noted that such talks routinely happen. \n\t</p>\n<p>\n\tThe global filmmaking community has responded to Donald Trump’s <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/2025/film/news/trump-film-tariff-1236533885/\">renewed threats about imposing tariffs</a> on films made outside the U.S. with a mix of concern, confusion, indifference and more than a splash of disdain.</p>\n<p>\n\tIt’s unknown what sparked Trump’s latest declaration, which arrived less than five months after he similarly declared that he would be imposing 100% tariffs on films made outside the U.S. That earlier announcement — also made on social media — came without any details about how the levies would be enforced and which productions they would impact. Since then, no policy has come into effect.</p>\n<p>\n\t“When Trump sent out a tweet a couple of months ago, details were never provided. How do you tariff something like a movie? Who ultimately gets charged for the tariff?  says entertainment lawyer Stephen Weizenecker of Barnes & Thornburg. “But this is his second time talking about it, so I imagine he has something he’s working on.”</p>\n<p>\n\tHowever, whereas the initial suggestion sent much of the international industry into a tailspin as producers, sales agents, distributors and more attempted to pick apart what it meant for the film business, this time it was largely met with an exhaustive eyeroll or, in some cases, expletives.</p>\n<p>\n\t“It’s just hot air again. It’s his brand of Looney Tunes,” British producer and co-managing director of Head Gear Films, Phil Hunt, tells <em>Variety</em>. “I can’t see it helping North America. He doesn’t understand the detail of film being a global business.”</p>\n<p>\n\tThe White House, for its part, did not respond to multiple requests for comment and clarification. </p>\n<p>\n\tKayvan Mashayekh, the head of Producers Without Borders, a network of international producers, understands the “frustration” over runaway shoots but says the application of the tariffs “leaves much to be desired since it’s never ever so black and white.”</p>\n<p>\n\tIndeed, with moviemaking becoming increasingly global, more and more U.S. filmmakers — from Kristen Stewart to Jim Jarmusch and James Gray, to name a few — are working with European producers and financiers, so the nationality of films is becoming an obsolete concept. Many major studio blockbusters, including the next two “Avengers” films, the third “Dune” film and HBO’s “Harry Potter” series, have moved to production hubs in the United Kingdom, Hungary and other European countries that offer richer subsidies than the United States. Shooting a film in California, for instance, can add tens of millions to the budget, making studios hesitant to make movies in the same state where they are headquartered.\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\tFrench producer Charles Gillibert — whose recent work includes the Angelina Jolie-led “Coutures” and Stewart’s debut “The Chronology of Water,” all of which shot across Europe — believes Trump’s tariffs would “condemn the work to never being made.” Gillibert thinks the potential tariff will hurt arthouse films more than major studio tentpoles.</p>\n<p>\n\t“The current cost of filming in the United States does not allow certain auteur films that aren’t commercial vehicles to be made there,” he said. “It is partly this auteur cinema that is targeted by this law, because those films are made by artists who have a freedom of expression vis-à-vis the U.S. industry and its politics.”</p>\n<p>\n\tIronically, many of the artists who would be the most hurt by the tariffs are also the biggest ambassador of American cinema around the world. Jarmusch, for instance, just won the Golden Lion at Venice with “Father Mother Sister Brother,” which mostly shot in Ireland and France. </p>\n<p>\n\t“If the president really wanted to help the American film industry — and help to create more American jobs — he would work with Congress to create national programs to incentivize production in the U.S. that rival the programs that exist in Europe and around the world,” says Joshua Astrachan, a New York-based producer on “Father Mother Sister Brother.”</p>\n<div><p>\n\tLaura Friedman, a Democratic congresswoman from Burbank, said Monday that she is talking with colleagues, including some Republicans, about a proposal to establish a federal tax credit.</p><p>“It’s still my hope there are people within Trump’s universe that will guide him to a solution that makes more sense,” she said, noting that producers, unions and studios are aligned in support of a federal incentive.</p></div>\n<p>\n\tFriedman said she, too, is in the dark about the president’s intentions.</p>\n<p>\n\t“I have no idea what it looks like to tariff a movie,” she said. “My concern remains it would drive up the cost for viewers. That’s not something the industry wants to see.”</p>\n<p>\n\tFor Raphael Benoliel, a leading line producer and executive producer who has worked numerous U.S. productions in France, including “The Walking Dead: Daryl Dixon” and “Emily in Paris,” maintains there’s no point in becoming alarmist until anything more formal has been unveiled.</p>\n<p>\n\t“Right now, we have to have a wait-and-see approach because the man tends to backtrack on his announcements,” he said. “He likes to create chaos, but I like to be patient and serene.”\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\tNorthern Irish producer Trevor Birney, behind the BAFTA-winning hit “Kneecap,” was more succinct in his response to Trump. “Go fuck yourself! Again!” he said. As for the reasoning for the latest outburst, he suggested it was prompted by recent U.S. sporting failures. “Trump obviously didn’t take the Ryder Cup loss very well!”</p>\n<p>\n\t<em>Rebecca Rubin and Gene Maddaus contributed to this report. </em></p>\n</div>"
