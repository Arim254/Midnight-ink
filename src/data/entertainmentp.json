    "description": "“Peaky Blinders” creator Steven Knight has returned to Netflix with his latest drama, “House of Guinness.” Set mainly in Dublin, Ireland, and loosely based on the real-life Guinnesses, the historical series...",
    "body": "<div><p>\n\t“Peaky Blinders” creator <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/steven-knight/\">Steven Knight</a> has returned to <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/netflix/\">Netflix</a> with his latest drama, “<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/house-of-guinness/\">House of Guinness</a>.” Set mainly in Dublin, Ireland, and loosely based on the real-life Guinnesses, the historical series focuses on the famous brewery and the family behind it following the death of their patriarch. Although well-acted and engaging, the show fails to pack the same explosive punch as the Cillian Murphy-starrer “Peaky Blinders” or even <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/2025/tv/reviews/a-thousand-blows-review-hulu-1236312075/\">Knight’s Hulu series, “A Thousand Blows,”</a> which premiered earlier this year. Still, it’s an engrossing enough saga that puts the lore and the myths of one of the Emerald Isle’s most famous dynasties front and center. \n\t</p>\n<p>\n\t“House of Guinness” begins amid death and rebellion. It’s May 27, 1868, and Sir.<strong> </strong>Benjamin Guinness has died, leaving chaos and his towering brewery behind. His passing isn’t exactly a moment of mourning for the people of Dublin. The Fenians (who would become the Irish Republican Army, the IRA) are celebrating his demise, especially amid his long-term partnership with the British. The streets are so chaotic that Guinness Brewery foreman Sean Rafferty (an outstanding <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/james-norton/\">James Norton</a>) has been tasked with ensuring Benjamin’s horse-drawn casket arrives at the church unscathed from bottle-wielding protestors. \n</p>\n<p>\n\tFor their part, Benjamin’s children aren’t moved to tears in the wake of his death either. Meeting at the family home just before the funeral, Anne (Emily Fairn), the only girl sibling, encourages her rambunctious brothers to at least pretend to be a united front in public. However, the men have other plans. Arthur (<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/anthony-boyle/\">Anthony Boyle</a>), the eldest brother, resents being forced to leave his life in London, where he spends his days sexing, drinking and smoking. Ben (Fionn O’Shea), the middle brother, is too drunk to even conceive of what’s happening. Finally, there is Edward (<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/louis-partridge/\">Louis Partridge</a>), the youngest brother, who has followed dutifully in Benjamin’s footsteps and has his own unique ideas, but has the sole misfortune of his birth order. \n\t</p>\n<p>\n\tThe siblings make it through the funeral uneventfully, but the reading of their father’s will throws all of their lives in disarray, changing the course of their futures forever. Ben and Anne are written out of the will for being a drunkard and a woman, respectively. Meanwhile, Arthur and Edward are awarded the brewery, all of the Guinness properties and a massive fortune ($162 million in today’s money) jointly and equally. Unfortunately, neither brother can walk away from the business without forfeiting everything entirely over to the other. </p>\n<p>\n\tOver the course of the season, audiences watch as Edward and Arthur navigate their newfound roles, differences and what the legacy of Guinness requires each of them to sacrifice. (Anne and Ben are mostly relegated to side characters popping in and out of the plot for flair.). Moreover, as Edward looks to expand the business internationally and across the ocean to New York, Arthur finds himself with one foot in the spaces he longs to return to and another in this new public position he must claim. Though the family dynamics anchor the story, the Fenian uprising led by sister/brother duo Ellen (Niamh McCormack) and Paddy Cochran (Seamus O’Hara) are also causing major chaos on the streets of Dublin and within the company’s walls. </p>\n<p>\n\tWhile “House of Guinness” is solid, it lacks the sharpness of Knight’s previous works. Despite the stunning cinematography, punchy music and slick stylization, by Episode 5, it becomes tedious and repetitive, droning on and on to extend itself into eight episodes. It’s interesting to reflect on the wealth of the Irish upper class just two decades after the Irish Potato Famine. However, the latter half of the season feels meandering, with overstuffed episodes diluting the impact of the plot. The series would have significantly benefited from a more precise edit, zeroing in entirely on the top-of-mind characters instead of trying to make space for every single Guinness on the family tree and those surrounding them. </p>\n<p>\n\tThe show isn’t historically accurate, but it’s mostly a fun ride for those interested in the Guinnesses and Ireland’s extensive history. Though “House of Guinness” isn’t Knight’s best work, it’s a compelling tale about family, ambition, desire and what it costs to remain at the top. \n\t</p>\n<p>\n\t<em>“House of Guinness” premieres Sept. 25 on Netflix. </em></p>\n</div>"

As she becomes entangled in her lookalike’s life, she realizes she might be the only one to solve her doppelganger’s disappearance as well as recover a stolen sacred song.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tThe film had its world premiere at Tallinn Black Nights Film Festival, where Roder won best director, and its Asia premiere at the International Film Festival of India (IFFI), Goa. The cast includes Tandin Bidha, Jimmie Wangyal Tshering, Tshering Dorji, Sonam Lhamo and Dorji Wangdi.</p>\n<p>\n\tThis selection represents Bhutan’s fourth official submission to the Academy Awards since the kingdom began participating in 1999. Previous entries include “The Cup” (1999), “Lunana: A Yak in the Classroom” (2020), and “The Monk and The Gun” (2023). “Lunana: A Yak in the Classroom” became Bhutan’s first film to receive an Oscar nomination.</p>\n<p>\n\tThe selection was made by a committee organized through BICMA (Bhutan Information and Communications Media Authority), the country’s main film supporting agency. The Oscar submission committee itself was established relatively recently in Bhutan, as the country previously lacked formal procedures for Academy Award submissions.\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\t“We’re super thrilled to be given this show of support from the committee,” said Roder. “Of course our Oscars journey likely peaks here, since we have zero budget for campaigns or anything now. Still we are honored and thrilled with the seal of recognition from our own country.”</p>\n<p>\n\t“I, The Song” received several international grants, including funding from Visions sud est, MPA APSA Film Fund, Sorfond, WCF Europe, CNC ACM, Ciclic, and Mibac. The film is produced by Roder for Dakinny Productions (Bhutan) and Johann Chapelan for Girelle Production (France), with multiple international co-producers including companies from Norway, Taiwan, Italy, and France, alongside local co-producer Samuh, Bhutan’s first streaming platform. The production had no executive producers or equity investors.</p>\n<p>\n\tAward-winning filmmaker and Academy member Arun Bhattarai, who served on Bhutan’s selection committee, praised the choice: “‘I, The Song’ touched me in a personal way. Dechen has a gift for blending the real and the mysterious, and through that she tells a story that feels deeply Bhutanese.”</p>\n<p>\n\tFellow committee member Thaye Lam Tshering added: “This film touches on a very current state of our world – the going viral economy/reality, how the digital affects reality. The film also showcases plenty of Bhutan’s unique culture and tradition.”</p>\n<p>\n\tProducer Johann Chapelan said: “Today, as women’s rights and fundamental human freedoms are eroded by the rising tide of conservatism and bellicism across the world, this film stands as a reminder of cinema’s power to affirm human dignity.”</p>\n<p>\n\tRoder expressed hope that the recognition would inspire the broader Bhutanese film community: “I hope this recognition gives our own filmmakers a small push of encouragement and inspiration and also creates a small visibility in the global landscape for Bhutanese art/independent films.”</p>\n<p>\n\tDiversion is handling international sales for “I, The Song.”</p>\n<div><p>\n\tThe Oscar international feature shortlist will be announced on Dec. 16 and the final five nominees will be announced on Jan. 22.</p></div>\n</div>"

    "body": "<div><p>\n\tWhen Indian star and filmmaker <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/rishab-shetty/\">Rishab Shetty</a>’s “Kantara” released in 2022, few could have predicted that a Kannada-language film steeped in local folklore would turn into a cultural phenomenon. </p>\n<p>\n\tShot on a modest budget, the film grossed more than $50 million worldwide, ran for over 100 days in Indian cinemas and built a second life on Prime Video, where its haunting imagery and hypnotic song “Varaha Roopam” found audiences far beyond South India. “Kantara” became shorthand for the potential of Kannada-language cinema to compete on a national and global scale, alongside <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/hombale-films/\">Hombale Films</a>’ other breakout franchise, “K.G.F.”\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\tShetty, who wrote, directed and headlined the original, is now returning with a prequel: “<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/kantara-a-legend-chapter-1/\">Kantara A Legend: Chapter 1</a>.” Set centuries before the events of the first film, it promises to dive deeper into the forest mythology, rituals and belief systems that captivated audiences the first time around.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tThe weight of expectation is enormous, but Shetty insists he keeps it in perspective. “Excitement and expectation are always there, but I keep it at one level,” he tells <em>Variety</em>. “Expectation should not pressurize the script, the story, or the filmmaking process. We don’t take it as pressure, but we take it as responsibility. That responsibility makes us put in more effort — in story, in making, in performance, in execution.”</p>\n<p>\n\tMusic was a crucial part of the first film’s success, with composer B. Ajaneesh Loknath’s “Varaha Roopam” inspiring everything from goosebumps in theaters to TikTok remixes. Shetty knows that audiences expect something equally potent in the prequel. “Every film I direct is musical — songs are always very important to me,” he says. “Some things we can’t recreate, but we can create new things. Definitely there are songs in Chapter 1, and I think people will like them very much.”\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\tWhere the first “Kantara” often relied on atmosphere and raw physicality, “Chapter 1” escalates to epic scale. Battle sequences featuring thousands of junior artists were staged with the help of three stunt choreographers — from the Bulgarian, Kannada and Tamil industries. “Safety is something we thought about a lot, we planned a lot,” Shetty notes. “The technical team was very big. Locations were deep inside the forest, very difficult to access. The art department, costume team, technical crew — everyone had to carry their responsibilities perfectly. That is why we could achieve it. It was teamwork.”</p>\n<p>\n\tThe dual challenge of starring and directing on such sequences forced Shetty into constant role-switching. “In some action sequences I was performing, and at the same time, in the background there were issues,” he recalls. “Immediately I would grab the mic, go to a height and talk to the artists. It used to switch immediately between actor and director. But the character I play is also like that — so it felt organic.”</p>\n<p>\n\tThe film’s setting demanded meticulous world-building. “There are no visual references, only some paintings,” Shetty explains. “So we met professors and historians, we discussed and researched. How palaces looked, how ports were, what trade was happening — we had to visualize and establish that on screen.” Archaeological records and oral histories suggest Karnataka’s coast had active maritime links with Arabia and beyond during the period. “We had to show the variety — kingdoms, ports, tribes — the differences,” Shetty says. “Cinematography, costume and design all had to reflect that.” His team worked with historians to translate fragmented evidence into cinematic reality.</p>\n<p>\n\tShetty stresses that while the film has grandeur, authenticity remains at its core. “It has to be cinematic, but it also has to feel real,” he says. “The rituals, the dialects, the costumes — all had to be grounded, even when the storytelling is larger than life.”</p>\n<p>\n\tFrom the moment the first “Kantara” was announced, producer Hombale Films used a visual motif to build intrigue: a burning half-circle in the first poster, later extended through successive reveals. The latest poster shows a well, fire raging, with a figure leaping outward. “For me it is all connected,” Shetty says. “From the beginning it is that circle. Now we are showing the well. I don’t know what all stories are inside the well. There are many stories in the well.” That cryptic remark hints at something larger: “Kantara” is not just a two-film saga but potentially a universe of interconnected tales, rooted in folklore and spirituality, yet open-ended enough to grow into sequels, prequels and spin-offs.\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\tShetty has been candid about the physical risks of filming — working in dangerous locations, pushing his body through extreme action scenes. “Risk is always there,” he admits. “Life itself has risk. You accept the challenge and move forward.” He describes the shoot as “very heavy” but believes divine blessings carried the crew through. “The story demanded certain things, and we had to work hard to achieve them,” he says. “That was the priority.”</p>\n<p>\n\t“Kantara” arrived at a pivotal moment for Kannada cinema, riding on the momentum of the “KGF” films and titles like “777 Charlie” and “Vikrant Rona.” But Shetty cautions against assuming a constant upward curve. “Ups and downs happen in life, in every industry,” he says. </p>\n<p>\n\t“’K.G.F.’ gave a route, a recognition. ‘Kantara’ also went in that route. But success rate is very minimum, maybe 5-6%. What we can do is experiment, try new things. The audience decides.” He points out that even in the single-screen era, only a handful of Kannada films ran successfully for weeks at a stretch. “The perspective was always skewed toward hits,” he explains. “Now the industry is bigger, but the principle remains the same: not every film will work. You have to keep experimenting.”</p>\n<p>\n\tFor Shetty, who has other large scale projects on <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/2024/film/news/rishab-shetty-shivaji-maharaj-1236232731/\">Indian warrior king Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj</a> and Hindu God Hanuman in development, everything is currently subsumed into “Kantara.” “For three years I have been completely inside ‘Kantara,’” he says. “After release, maybe I can see what else is happening outside. Right now it is only this circle.”</p>\n<div><p>\n\t“Kantara A Legend: Chapter 1” releases Oct. 2 worldwide in the Kannada, Hindi, Tamil, Telugu, Malayalam, Bengali and English languages.</p></div>\n</div>"

    "body": "<div><p>\n\tPakistani <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/horror/\">horror</a> film “<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/deemak/\">Deemak</a>” is expanding internationally following its record-breaking local performance, with the supernatural thriller set to reach global audiences starting next month.</p>\n<p>\n\tThe film will open in the U.K., U.S., EU countries and Canada on Oct. 17, followed by a Gulf Cooperation Council release on Oct. 23. The international rollout involves multiple distributors: Bollywood Films & Cinema Specialist handles U.K. distribution, World Cinema Partners and Cinema Specialist cover the U.S. and Canada, Multivoice Pictures Limited takes the EU, and FunAsia manages GCC territories.\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\t“Deemak” has earned PKR17.5 crore ($620,000) at the Pakistani box office, marking an unprecedented achievement for the horror genre in the region. The film claimed the title of Pakistan’s highest-grossing horror film of all time while continuing to play in select local cinemas.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tDirected by Rafay Rashdi (“Badshah Begum,” “The Java Plum Tree”) and written by Ayesha Muzaffar (author of “Abus Jinns” and “Jinnistan”), “Deemak” explores the volatile relationship between a mother-in-law and daughter-in-law against a backdrop of escalating paranormal disturbances in a family home. The film is produced under Wah Wah Productions with Syed Murad Ali serving as executive producer.</p>\n<p>\n\tThe film assembles a cast of Pakistani talent including Faysal Quraishi (“Money Back Guarantee”), Sonya Hussyn (“Tich Button”), Samina Peerzada (“Balaa”), Javed Sheikh (“Chand Nagar”) and Bushra Ansari (“Tere Bin”). </p>\n<p>\n\tThe project also earned recognition on the festival circuit, taking home the best editing award at the Shanghai Cooperation Organization Film Festival earlier this year.\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\t“This is a defining moment for Pakistani cinema,” Rashdi said. “‘Deemak’ has not only broken records at home but also proven that local stories have the power to surpass Hollywood and Bollywood titles in our market. We are excited to now bring this story to international audiences who, we believe, will connect with its emotional and cultural depth as much as its scares.”</p>\n<p>\n\tExecutive producer Murad Ali added: “‘Deemak’ is more than a horror film, it is a cultural export. Its reception in Pakistan and recognition on the global festival stage are proof of its universal resonance. We look forward to audiences around the world experiencing what has become a landmark achievement for our industry.”</p>\n<div>\n\t<p><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/pakistan/\">Pakistan</a>‘s horror cinema has seen sporadic but significant milestones, beginning with the cult classic “Zinda Laash” (1967), widely regarded as the country’s first horror feature and a South Asian take on Dracula. After decades of low-budget productions and TV serials, the genre experienced a modern revival with “Zibahkhana” (2007), an English-Urdu zombie slasher that became Pakistan’s first horror film to screen at several international festivals. This paved the way for titles like “Maya” (2015) and “Aksbandh” (2016), both of which explored supernatural horror with local folklore elements. More recently, “In Flames” (2023), a psychological horror debuting at Cannes’ Directors’ Fortnight, signaled a shift toward arthouse sensibilities. Though still niche and operating under conservative content constraints, Pakistan’s horror genre continues to find footing through hybrid narratives, festival exposure, and indie experimentation.</p></div>\n</div>"

    "body": "<div><p>\n\tIn the fifth episode of “<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/south-park/\">South Park</a>” Season 27, Kyle and his mother go to war with prediction market apps while <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/donald-trump/\">Donald Trump</a> inadvertently terrorizes FCC chair <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/brendan-carr/\">Brendan Carr</a> while trying to kill his butt baby with Satan.</p>\n<p>\n\tSouth Park Elementary is once again engrossed in another fad. This time around, it’s prediction market apps, which, according to Stan, are a form of “social platform betting. People can make any bet they want and users take them up on it.”\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\tCartman fills Kyle in on the hottest bets on campus, which include, “Will the girls’ soccer team win on Friday? Will there be a snow day this month? Will Kyle’s mom strike Gaza and destroy a Palestinian hospital?” Enraged, Kyle is quick to blame Cartman for the antisemitic wager, but Cartman claims he had nothing to do with it. Kyle storms off and vows to find whoever is responsible. His search leads him to Carr and the FCC. Upon hearing there is an “offensive government app” on the market, he rushes to the White House to warn Trump. \n</p>\n<p>\n\tMeanwhile, Trump is plotting how to get rid of his unborn butt baby with Satan so that he won’t have to give up his extravagant lifestyle. However, every time he tries to lure his lover into a trap, a frantic Carr becomes the unintended target. </p>\n<p>\n\tFirst, Trump tries to use a rope and grease to make Satan fall down the stairs, but Carr is the one to take a nasty tumble. Trump then tries to give Satan a stew laced with Plan B. However, Satan doesn’t like carrots, leaving Carr to slurp down the poisoned dish. Finally, Trump tries to infect Satan with toxoplasmosis by dumping pounds of kitty litter on him. However, Carr stumbles into the elaborate trap, landing him in the hospital. \n\t</p>\n<p>\n\tWhen visiting Carr in the ICU, JD Vance asks the doctor about Carr’s condition, and the physician replies, “His bones are healing, so he may regain full range of motion. But if the toxoplasmosis parasite gets to his brain, I’m afraid he may lose his freedom of speech.”</p>\n<p>\n\tVance is delighted to hear Carr is in critical condition. He wants anyone out of the way who could take his place as next in line to the presidency. Threatening Carr to keep his interference to a minimum, Vance tells him, “We can do this the easy way or the hard way.”</p>\n<p>\n\tBack in South Park, Kyle’s mom is determined to find out who created the bet on whether or not she will attack Gaza. The search takes her to Israel, where she confronts Benjamin Netanyahu about the Palestinian conflict. </p>\n<p>\n\t“There you are, Mr. Netanyahu,” Kyle’s mom yells. “Just who do you think you are, killing thousands and flattening neighborhoods, then wrapping yourself in Judaism like it’s some shield from criticism?”</p>\n<p>\n\tHours before fans were expecting the initial release of episode 5 on Sept. 17, creators Trey Parker and Matt Stone took to X to announce that the latest “South Park” installment was <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/2025/tv/news/south-park-delays-episode-1236522027/\">not ready for release</a>, and had to be pushed a week to Sept. 24.</p>\n<p>\n\t“Apparently when you do everything at the last minute sometimes you don’t get it done,” they said. “This one’s on us. We didn’t get it done in time. Thanks to Comedy Central and ‘South Park’ fans for being so understanding. Tune in next week!”</p>\n<p>\n\tThe <a href=\"https://variety.com/2025/tv/news/south-park-donald-trump-satan-pregnant-1236507106/\" target=\"_blank\">last new episode</a>, released on Sept. 3, took a slight detour from politics to cover another ubiquitous chapter in our current cultural zeitgeist: Labubus. However, fans still got a bombshell update in Donald Trump’s relationship with his Satanic lover. While South Park Elementary’s student body obsessed over the red-hot Chinese accessory, Fox News was desperate to find out if Trump was “fucking Satan.” Their relentless pursuit led them to the revelation that Trump was, in fact, “fucking Satan,” and that there is a baby on the way as a result.</p>\n<p>\n\t“You think I don’t want to leave? I am bound to him!” Satan tells a gaggle of reporters. “I want to leave him, but I can’t because I’m pregnant. I am forced to stay in this situation for several more years.”</p>\n<p>\n\t“South Park” also made headlines last week after it <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/2025/tv/news/charlie-kirk-south-park-pulled-comedy-central-1236515229/\">pulled Season 27’s second episode</a> from Comedy Central’s schedule. The episode, titled “Got a Nut,” parodied Charlie Kirk and his public debate forum, and was removed in the wake of the young conservative activist’s death. While it will no longer be aired on Comedy Central, it is still available to stream on Paramount+.</p>\n</div>"

    "body": "<div><p><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/henry-jaglom/\">Henry Jaglom</a>, the indie filmmaker who directed films including “Always” (1985), “New Year’s Day” (1989), “Last Summer in the Hamptons” (1995) and “Déjà Vu” (1997), has died, according to the <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/09/24/movies/henry-jaglom-dead.html\" target=\"_blank\">New York Times</a>. He was 87.</p>\n<p>Both Jaglom’s personality and his films tended to divide people. In the introduction to H. Alex Rubin and Jeremy Workman’s 1997 documentary on the director, “Who Is Henry Jaglom?,” PBS’ “POV” website declared: “Hailed by some as a cinematic genius, a feminist voice and the only true maverick of American cinema, dismissed by others as a voyeuristic, egomaniacal fraud and the ‘world’s worst director,’ Henry Jaglom (‘Eating,’ ‘Babyfever’) obsessively and hilariously confuses and abuses the line between life and art, challenging the boundaries of filmmaking with his unorthodox style.”\n\t</p>\n<p>But the deeply personal, cinema verité style he developed in his stream of consciousness pictures certainly had its supporters.</p>\n<p>The New York Times’ Stephen Holden began a Jaglom review by saying: “Henry Jaglom’s autobiographical films, with their navel-gazing introspection, require a degree of patience that many moviegoers are loath to extend. But even the most self-indulgent Jaglom films loiter in psychic territory that more mainstream explorations of well-heeled angst often overlook.”</p>\n<p>In the “Who Is Henry Jaglom?” documentary, critic Michael Medved declares his opinion that Jaglom’s films are “touching and thought-provoking” while the director Louis Malle says, “He improvises almost completely. But excuse me, it shows” — yet theater director André Gregory makes it clear that that’s the point: “Henry likes to go into the unknown…he enjoys the danger in the process.” Actress Candice Bergen calls Jaglom aggressive, confrontational, but also enormously supportive: “If I had had Henry as a father or as a husband,” she jokes in the documentary, “I could probably have taken Poland.” Dennis Hopper and Ron Silver both laud his innovative methods.\n\t</p>\n<p>Jaglom came from a very wealthy family — indeed, when he and second wife Victoria Foyt were divorcing, she got their mansion — set on what was said to be the largest compound in Santa Monica — and ultimately sold it for $23 million. The money for purchasing such an estate in the first place certainly was not accrued from the box office revenue of Jaglom’s films.</p>\n<p>That he did not have to scrimp in order to make his films fundamentally set him apart from most or all other independent filmmakers, which perhaps contributed a certain undisciplined quality to his work. But that quality was also part of his aesthetic: He often worked without either a script or rehearsals in an impromptu arrangement that, he maintained, allowed him to “shape” and “evoke” performances spontaneously.</p>\n<p>He had something to say, and a need to document his own life in his own movies. The best example was 1985’s “Always,” a “cinema à clef,” in the words of People magazine, documenting the painful breakup of the director’s first marriage, with “Jaglom and Townsend, now divorced, as thinly disguised versions of themselves.”</p>\n<p>In Jaglom’s 1989 “New Year’s Day,” he played a man in a mid-life crisis who decides to leave Los Angeles and start life anew in New York City, but when he arrives at his apartment, he discovers it’s been sublet to two attractive young women; in the following year’s “Eating,” women gather for the birthday party of a friend and discuss their lives and associations with food. Love story “Venice/Venice” followed the relationship between an American director— Jaglom — and a female journalist.</p>\n<p>Roger Ebert described 1994’s “Babyfever” as “another one of his engagingly offhand fictionalized documentaries, in which the characters talk earnestly and all too comprehensively about the problem du jour: In this case, whether or not to have a baby. Like many of his films, it has an appeal almost despite itself. It’s too long, it’s too talky, it indulges itself, and yet because it is sincere and sometimes funny, we are willing to watch.”</p>\n<p>The film in which Jaglom stepped outside of himself the most was 1995’s “Last Summer in the Hamptons,” about a gathering of three generations of an accomplished theatrical family. <em>Variety</em> said: “Henry Jaglom takes a big step forward in ‘Last Summer in the Hamptons,’ a mildly amusing comedy of manners that evokes the spirit, if not the accomplishment, of Chekhov, Renoir and, most specifically, Woody Allen.”\n\t</p>\n<p>Of 1997’s “Deja Vu,” Jaglom’s “fictionalized, wildly romantic retelling of meeting and falling in love with his wife and collaborator, Victoria Foyt,” the New York Times said, “At its insidious best, the film is a seductive advertisement for continuing one’s adolescent search for a romantic soul mate well into middle age and beyond and for scrapping one’s long-standing domestic arrangements if that true love should happen to present itself.”</p>\n<p>Whatever place Jaglom held in the national conversation about independent filmmaking peaked in the mid to late 1990s. Later efforts included “Festival in Cannes” (2001), “Going Shopping” (2005), “Hollywood Dreams” (2006), “Irene in Time” (2009), “Queen of the Lot” (2010), 2012’s “Just 45 Minutes From Broadway” (which began as a play), “The M Word” (2014) and “Ovation” (2015).</p>\n<p>Jaglom was born to a Jewish family in London. His father, who worked in the import-export business, was from a wealthy family from Russia, and his mother was from Germany. They left for the U.K. because of the Nazis, and the family entered the U.S. in 1939. He picked up his first eight millimeter camera as a boy.</p>\n<p>After graduating from the University of Pennsylvania in 1959, Jaglom trained with Lee Strasberg at the Actors Studio, directing the off-Broadway improvisational revue “The Uncommon Denominator,” in which he starred with Karen Black, among others, in 1963.</p>\n<p>He also worked in cabaret before moving to Hollywood in 1965. Under contract to Columbia Pictures, Jaglom guested on TV shows including “Gidget” and “The Flying Nun,” and he appeared in films including Richard Rush’s “Psych-Out” (1968), Boris Sagal’s “The Thousand Plane Raid” (1969), the Jack Nicholson-directed “Drive, He Said” (1971), the Dennis Hopper-helmed “The Last Movie” (1971) and Orson Welles’ never-completed “The Other Side of the Wind.”</p>\n<p>In 1967, he went to Israel to film a documentary on the Six-Day War; and he had been cultivating friendships with the likes of Jack Nicholson, Warren Beatty, Sally Kellerman, the screenwriter Carol Eastman and producer Bert Schneider of BBS Productions, who viewed his movie and hired him to work with Nicholson on the editing of Hopper’s “Easy Rider” (1969).</p>\n<p>The first film Jaglom wrote and directed was 1971’s “A Safe Place,” starring Tuesday Weld, Nicholson and Welles. His next movie, “Tracks” (1977), starred Hopper and was among the earliest films to explore the psychological cost of the Vietnam War. His third film, and first commercial success, was the 1980 comic romp “Sitting Ducks.”\n\t</p>\n<p>Jaglom penned four plays performed on Los Angeles stages: “The Waiting Room” (1974), “A Safe Place” (2003), “Always — But Not Forever” (2007) and “Just 45 Minutes From Broadway” (2009-10).</p>\n<p>Jaglom received a renewed burst of attention with the 2013 publication of Peter Biskind’s “My Lunches With Orson: Conversations Between Henry Jaglom and Orson Welles,” in which Biskind shaped and edited a series of conversations between the two filmmakers that Jaglom had recorded, some say surreptitiously, while Jaglom maintains it was with Welles’ assent. But as NPR pointed out, while Peter Bogdanovich’s reproduced conversations with Welles in the 1992 book “This Is Orson Welles” were of a generally scholarly bent, Jaglom captured Welles in a mood to dish dirt and nasty opinions about fellow celebrities. (“I hate Woody Allen physically. I dislike that kind of man”).</p>\n<p>The director won a lifetime achievement award from Method Fest in 1999. Jaglom had relationships with actress Karen Black and singer Andrea Marcovicci.</p>\n<p>Jaglom was twice married. He was married to occasional actress and script supervisor Patrice Townsend from 1979-83 and to writer-actress Victoria Foyt from 1991-2013. Both marriages ended in divorce.</p>\n<p>He is survived by his two children, Sabrina Jaglom and Simon Jaglom. </p>\n</div>"
