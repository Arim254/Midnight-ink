    "body": "<div><p>\n\t<strong>SPOILER ALERT: </strong><em>This story contains spoilers from “The Real Monsters,” the Season 1 finale of “<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/alien-earth/\">Alien: Earth</a>,” now streaming on Hulu.</em></p>\n<p>\n\t“All children, but one, grow up.” It’s the opening line of J.M. Barrie’s “The Complete Peter Pan,” following the tale of a young boy who can’t grow up, whisking mortal children away from harm’s reach far from adults who plague their imaginative minds. It’s the type of story that Prodigy Corporation’s CEO Boy Kavalier (<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/samuel-blenkin/\">Samuel Blenkin</a>) has built an empire on, becoming the world’s youngest trillionaire, as he’s on the brink of changing humanity by transferring terminally ill children’s subconsciousness into synthetic bodies. \n\t</p>\n<p>\n\tThroughout the season, Boy Kavalier’s real intentions begin to take over Neverland Research Island after successfully securing the alien specimens that the USCSS Maginot had been researching in space, discarding his decade-long work on the hybrids. It’s until the finale that the perspective on Kavalier’s eccentric behavior begins to shift for the Lost Boys as they’re being held in a cell while the island is being terrorized by a loose Xenomorph, killing all Prodigy Corporation guards in sight. With an understaffed island, Boy finds himself at war — not only with the aliens he captured, but with the children set to make him trillions of dollars in revenue.\n</p>\n<div>\n<figure>\n<p><img srcset=\"https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/AE_108_PBR-1906-0467r-1.jpg 3000w, https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/AE_108_PBR-1906-0467r-1.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/AE_108_PBR-1906-0467r-1.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/AE_108_PBR-1906-0467r-1.jpg?resize=1920,1280 1920w, https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/AE_108_PBR-1906-0467r-1.jpg?resize=1360,907 1360w, https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/AE_108_PBR-1906-0467r-1.jpg?resize=1000,667 1000w, https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/AE_108_PBR-1906-0467r-1.jpg?resize=910,607 910w, https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/AE_108_PBR-1906-0467r-1.jpg?resize=681,454 681w, https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/AE_108_PBR-1906-0467r-1.jpg?resize=450,300 450w, https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/AE_108_PBR-1906-0467r-1.jpg?resize=250,167 250w\" src=\"https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/AE_108_PBR-1906-0467r-1.jpg?w=1024\" alt=\"\" />\n\t</p>\n<figcaption>\n\t\t\t\t\t<span>Samuel Blenkin as Boy Kavalier</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCourtesy of Patrick Brown/FX\n\t</figcaption>\n</figure>\n</div>\n<p>\n\tBlenkin spoke with <em>Variety </em>about how that finale reveal has affected his character’s upbringing, what his final laugh represents, and what he imagines a song based on Boy Kavalier would sound like in a future season of “Alien: Earth.”\n\t</p>\n\t<h5>\n\t\t<strong>Boy Kavalier speaks about his upbringing, and reveals that when he was 6 years old, he killed his alcoholic father due to the fact that he was jealous of his son’s intelligence. He was raised by a synthetic he created at a young age, becoming a ruthless CEO in his 20s. How do you imagine his childhood was after being raised by something that was programmed for his own needs?</strong>\t</h5>\n<p>\n\tSo much of how that experience formed him is present throughout the whole series, especially in the sense of someone who doesn’t have any examples in his life of when he has failed in order for him to be humbled slightly. He’s never been humbled before. This character has two separate lives, one is the life that he had before the event of when he killed his father, and the hero version of himself that he invented at some point down the road. He’s got this little part of himself where his father was abusive and horrible to him that’s locked up deep inside. </p>\n<p>\n\tWhen you’re completely surrounded by people who consistently say yes to you, it turns you into a Boy Kavalier type of person. I imagine it being a very strange upbringing, and one that was very fast in coming into power. He ultimately had success at his fingertips from a very young age, and that really does something to somebody.</p>\n\t<h5>\n\t\t<strong>We see Hermit (Alex Lawther) get under Boy’s skin as he’s present on the research island with Wendy (Sydney Chandler) after the rescue mission. Does his hatred for Hermit stem from the knowledge that both siblings had a proper childhood with a father who cared for them, which is something he lacked?</strong>\t</h5>\n<p>\n\tHe can’t have what Hermit has with Wendy, which is an emotional connection that is bonded by being a family. It’s something that he actively got rid of, and removed from his life. The reason why that turns into hatred [for Hermit] is because nobody deserves to have that connection with something or someone that he views as his property. He sees Hermit as a big threat to his ownership of Wendy.</p>\n\t<h5>\n\t\t<strong>There’s a line that Boy says to Dame Sylvia (Essie Davis) in Episode 2, where he reveals that all he wants is to have a proper conversation with someone who is smarter than him. In the final moments of Episode 8, he’s being held hostage with the newfound realization Wendy and the rest of the Lost Boys have been able to outsmart him. Does his final laugh come from the fact that he’s successfully gotten exactly what he’s asked for, which is finally being challenged by something or someone?</strong>\t</h5>\n<p>\n\tThat’s absolutely what’s going through his head. When that laugh comes out, it comes from a sense of what happens in “Peter Pan” is suddenly happening in real life. Wendy is saying that the Lost Boys have to grow up and leave Neverland in order to have meaningful lives. It’s the fact that the book that he loves so much is coming true in real life, but also, he’s kind of proud of them! They did a great job. \n\t</p>\n\t<h5>\n\t\t<strong>He’s looking at them from above in the cage like, “My kids did that!”</strong>\t</h5>\n<p>\n\tExactly, he’s so arrogant about it! He’s like, “I invented these guys and they’re doing exactly what I wanted!” They’ve gone far beyond what he thought they were capable of. That laugh is just filled with admiration for them. </p>\n\t<h5>\n\t\t<strong>While he got his wish of wanting to be challenged intellectually, the hybrids have no idea he’s celebrating his victory even after being chased around by a Xenomorph. </strong>\t</h5>\n<p>\n\tIt’s horrible. I was really excited about the fact that we get a couple of moments in this episode where he does get taken down a rung, as he has been such an arrogant and obnoxious character for the whole season. When he comes face to face with the Xenomorph for the first time, suddenly this performance that he’s been doing for the whole series of being a hero in his own journey completely falls away. In that moment, he is flesh and blood. That moment for me was very much a sense of being my body and realizing how vulnerable my skin is. </p>\n\t<h5>\n\t\t<strong>By seeing the Xenomorph in front of him, he realizes that there’s no one left to protect him, because he’s always been guarded with protection all around him on the island. He’s the reason why so many of his staff members are dead, and while he got what he wanted, it’s not what he imagined.</strong>\t</h5>\n<p>\n\tIt’s a great scene to happen after he’s talking about his father. I love that during that moment, the door swings open [to the cell], and he decides to walk in anyway to talk. It’s that upbringing of never having failed in life and choosing to believe that he can’t be beaten. It takes looking into the Xenomorph’s jaws for him to realize he is actually just a mortal human being.</p>\n\t<h5>\n\t\t<strong>Each episode of “Alien: Earth” is driven by music, from the heavy metal needle drops to Noah Hawley releasing song covers to amplify the soundscape of the series. As a musician who has previously written music for other characters you’ve portrayed in projects like “Mary & George,” if you were asked to compose a song for Boy Kavalier for the series, what do you imagine it would sound like? </strong>\t</h5>\n<p>\n\tThe song would be all about him, and it would be completely unbearable! Nobody watching would want to listen to it. In fact, I’ve been meaning to send Noah some of my work because I write my own songs, and I love the fact that he incorporates music into all of his projects in different ways. So, who knows, maybe in a couple of years! We’ll see. \n\t</p>\n<p>\n\t<em>This interview has been edited and condensed.</em><br /></p>\n</div>"

As the season ends, Wendy — having been awakened to the depredations of adults after watching a fight between authority figures Kirsh (Timothy Olyphant) and Morrow (Babou Ceesay) — has enlisted a Xenomorph, whom she controls, to help place Kirsh, Morrow, Boy Kavalier (Samuel Blenkin) and Dame Sylvia (Essie Davis) into a cage.

But it’s also pure <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/noah-hawley/\">Noah Hawley</a>: The “Alien: Earth” creator, known for “Fargo” and “Legion,” is deeply concerned with what it means to be human — and, as various of his characters have done over time, what it means to opt out. Wendy’s decision going forward, he tells <em>Variety </em>in a postmortem interview about Season 1, is about whether to lean into the flickers of humanity within her or to lean <em>out</em> and embrace the fact that she was built to be something more. It’s a battle that her brother Joe (Alex Lawther) feels deeply, as he remains uncertain whether his sister is really still his sister. (This same human-or-not dynamic also infuses the long-awaited fight between Morrow, a man with some cybernetic upgrades, and Kirsh, a fully synthetic being who delights in being beyond the realm of the human.) \n\t</p>\n<p>\n\tAhead of the “Alien: Earth” finale, Hawley spoke with <em>Variety </em>about all of these complications and how they might inform the show going forward. As he waits to see if “Alien: Earth” will get a Season 2 renewal, Hawley is beginning to plot his next move: “The moment they fire the starting gun,” he says, “I’m out of the block.”</p>\n\t<h5>\n\t\tIn the season’s final moments, it’s clear that Wendy has come into her own. I was really struck by the way that Joe looked at her fearfully during this sequence — and I wondered if that was a sign that she’s embracing her hybrid side more, and moving away from her humanity.\t</h5>\n<p>\n\tThat’s the central question of the series, right? Is Wendy going to choose “human” or “other”? There’s a push-pull between her brother, who represents, on some level, the best of humanity, and the Kirsh or Boy Kavalier sense of, <em>Why settle for human when there’s so much potential there?</em> So her brother is realizing that whatever big brother pull he had is really gone at this point. </p>\n<p>\n\tThe problem with letting children have all that power is that their executive function isn’t great, and their sense of consequences isn’t necessarily fully developed. There’s a hubris there. As she says, “Maybe this Xenomorph could be good,” right? Those of us who know Xenomorphs are like, <em>Well, maybe it can be controlled for a period of time… </em>So it’s worrisome, because she has all this power, but she doesn’t yet have the perspective he thinks she needs.</p>\n<div>\n<figure>\n<p><img srcset=\"https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Wendyandbrother.AlienEarth.jpg 1200w, https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Wendyandbrother.AlienEarth.jpg?resize=150,102 150w, https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Wendyandbrother.AlienEarth.jpg?resize=300,205 300w\" src=\"https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Wendyandbrother.AlienEarth.jpg?w=1024\" alt=\"\" />\n\t</p>\n<figcaption>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCourtesy of  Patrick Brown/FX\n\t</figcaption>\n</figure>\n</div>\n\t<h5>\n\t\tWhat did allowing Wendy to communicate with and to control the Xenomorph open up for you in the writing process?\t</h5>\n<p>\n\tIt obviously gives her a very powerful sidekick, as we see in the last couple of [episodes]. But also, the moment she releases this creature, it kills a bunch of people, and she doesn’t watch. She isn’t facing the consequences of that decision, but there is a real moral conundrum that she’s going to face if part of her power is in causing the injury or death of human beings. Then where’s her moral high ground? </p>\n<p>\n\tFor me, violence, which is so inevitable on “Fargo” and on “Alien” — I never want violence to be entertainment. I always want it to be impactful and meaningful, and to confront the audience with their desire for it. And those moments where we’re trained as an audience to feel like violence is the only way to resolve a conflict, let’s look at that a little more closely and see how we feel about it. \n\t</p>\n\t<h5>\n\t\tThat brings me to the fight between Morrow and Kirsh — which is both exciting, in the sense that we’re finally seeing what it looks like when a cyborg and a synthetic fight, but also thematically rich. It’s (altered) man vs. machine. \t</h5>\n<p>\n\tThe moment I wrote the elevator scene, I knew that you’ve got to pay it off on some level. You don’t want to make people wait for the second season. The hubris of [Morrow’s] statement “Man will always win. It’s a question of will.” Then 25 seconds later, he’s choked out by the machine. It’s like, don’t count the villain out, right? Freddy Krueger never dies. </p>\n<p>\n\tThat battle, on some level, is a fight between heroes and villains, right? And I’d love to take a poll of the audience and say, <em>Who do you want to win this fight? </em>Because I don’t know for sure. It’s like when you see Captain America fight Iron Man, and you’re like, <em>I don’t know what I’m rooting for — neither of them can die</em>. You don’t want that to happen. But who’s right? It becomes a question of whether you believe in authority, or whether you believe in rebellion. </p>\n\t<h5>\n\t\tAll of the show’s authority figures — Morrow, Kirsh, Boy Kavalier, Dame Sylvia — end the season caged, with a Xenomorph looming above them, looking potentially ready to pounce. Will any of them be taken off the board in a potential Season 2? If they’re staying, how will this shape their journeys?  \t</h5>\n<p>\n\tI think what we’ve seen throughout history is: Don’t count the villains out, right? The worst thing you could do is humiliate them or hand them a defeat, because it makes them more dangerous in the long run. There’s always a moment in which somebody humiliates the villain and now all the love in him is gone. </p>\n<div>\n<figure>\n<p><img srcset=\"https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/AlienEarth-finale-Olyphant.jpg 1200w, https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/AlienEarth-finale-Olyphant.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/AlienEarth-finale-Olyphant.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/AlienEarth-finale-Olyphant.jpg?resize=1000,667 1000w, https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/AlienEarth-finale-Olyphant.jpg?resize=910,607 910w, https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/AlienEarth-finale-Olyphant.jpg?resize=681,454 681w, https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/AlienEarth-finale-Olyphant.jpg?resize=450,300 450w, https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/AlienEarth-finale-Olyphant.jpg?resize=250,167 250w\" src=\"https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/AlienEarth-finale-Olyphant.jpg?w=1024\" alt=\"\" />\n\t</p>\n<figcaption>\n\t\t\t\t\t<span>Timothy Olyphant as Kirsh </span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCourtesy of Patrick Brown/FX\n\t</figcaption>\n</figure>\n</div>\n\t<h5>\n\t\tDid Kirsh’s perspective on the Prodigy project shift over the season — or were we just gradually given more insight into how he had always felt about it? \t</h5>\n<p>\n\tThere’s a moment when Kirsh says to Hermit’s character — Hermit’s asking, <em>How do I take care of my sister? </em>And Kirsh says, “That’s like an onion asking ‘How do I take care of a star?’” That’s his perspective on what human beings are, right?</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd so if you think that he was created by humans, and works for humans, and in many ways is programmed with some prime directives not to harm humans or cause them to be harmed — and yet, deep down inside, he knows he’s superior to all of them. That’s kind of a recipe for a personality disorder. Think of all of the people you know who are like, <em>I’m smarter than everybody else </em>— you’re like, you do not have a happy life ahead of you. So I don’t think it’s as much an evolution of his, but more of a sense that he was put in charge of these creatures and has been conducting these experiments, and you begin to realize that maybe the experiments also involve the hybrids and the humans, and that there’s a larger permission that was given.\n\t</p>\n\t<h5>\n\t\tCan we talk about my favorite little guy? The alien eyeball entering Arthur’s (David Rysdahl) body seemed to open up new avenues for a potential Season 2.\t</h5>\n<p>\n\tWhen we met this creature, it was inside this obviously dead cat. So I think we know that it can reanimate a body. For me, there’s something more symbolic about it. If Arthur is the moral center of the show — and perhaps the best of humanity, who died because of the worst qualities of humanity, and now isn’t even allowed to rest in peace, there’s a certain sort of final corruption that happens, in a “Pet Sematary” way. To take the thing that you love and bring it back as other can be really the most disconcerting for an audience.</p>\n\t<h5>\n\t\tUnderstanding that the timeline of this show totally excludes “Prometheus” and “Alien: Covenant,” I am struck by the fact that its events take place shortly before the events of the original 1979 “Alien.” In a potential Season 2, do you think you’ll get closer to that timeline and integrate it? \t</h5>\n<p>\n\tI think there are bridges that you cross right when you come to them. A big part of the world-building and the act of creation on these first eight episodes was to build something that was coherent to itself, that worked within the construct of the movies — the first two movies. </p>\n<p>\n\tIn success, in a Season 2 and beyond, then we really need to dig down and start to think about how these two stories are going to cohere together in the long term. And that doesn’t mean that I don’t have thoughts about it, or haven’t had thoughts about it, but in terms of the planning — part of why I’m successful in this business is that I know which problems I need to solve today, and which problems I need to solve tomorrow. And I don’t worry about tomorrow’s problems until tomorrow. They’re exciting problems — you realize, 50 years later, that you were only looking at half of the puzzle, and now I have to build the other half of the puzzle, to conform to the pieces of the original. I like a challenge like that. I wouldn’t take on this kind of IP if I didn’t, on some level, think that the constraints make for innovation.</p>\n\t<h5>\n\t\tAre you working on writing a Season 2 right now?\t</h5>\n<p>\n\tNo, it’s conversational at this point. You learn to be efficient and don’t work ahead of yourself. There’s conversations that are going on — obviously, the show’s about to wrap, and we’ll get a really complete sense of what the viewership was, and I would imagine that a decision would follow soon after as to whether to do a second season. Obviously, none of us — Disney or myself — want a single day longer than necessary to get a second season on the air, in success. Everyone wants to get this decision right. But we also want to be ready to go. I certainly know where I’m going. The moment they fire the starting gun, I’m out of the block.\n\t</p>\n\t<h5>\n\t\tThis is a bit of an irreverent note to end on, but I’m just curious. Every episode of “Alien: Earth” has ended with a blast of ‘90s metal. I lived for it! But what is going on with that music choice, week after week? \t</h5>\n<p>\n\tI’ve got a lot of quippy ways to talk about it — classic movie, classic rock — but at the end of the day, we made an arena show. We didn’t make the Paramount Theater show. We made the Shea Stadium show. And I wanted to end with that level of emotion that comes from Metallica or Jane’s Addiction or Pearl Jam. You want the big feeling! And those songs — I see you, “Alien” fans, and I know what you listen to, because I listen to it too, right? There’s nothing more rock and roll than an “Alien” movie.</p>\n<p>\n\t<em>This interview has been edited and condensed.</em></p>\n</div>"

    "body": "<div><p>\n\t<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/claudia-cardinale/\">Claudia Cardinale</a>, the sexy Italian movie star who appeared in classic Italian films including Fellini’s “8½” and Visconti’s “Rocco and His Brothers” and “The Leopard,” Sergio Leone’s spaghetti Western “Once Upon a Time in the West,” as well as “The <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/pink-panther/\">Pink Panther</a>,” has died. She was 87.</p>\n<p>\n\tHer agent <a href=\"https://www.france24.com/en/live-news/20250923-film-star-claudia-cardinale-dies-aged-87\" target=\"_blank\">told AFP</a> that she died in Nemours, near Paris. “She leaves us the legacy of a free and inspired woman both as a woman and as an artiste,” Laurent Savry said in a statement.\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\tEarly in her career Cardinale made very distinct impressions in supporting roles: Amid a number of astounding performances in Visconti’s “Rocco and His Brothers,” for example, she still stood out with an impressive turn as the oldest brother’s new wife; similarly, in the director’s “The Leopard,” her sexy effervescence as the Alain Delon character’s bride was memorable even if Burt Lancaster’s towering performance dominated the picture.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tIn Fellini’s “8½” she was second credited after Marcello Mastroianni for her role as Claudia, an elusive, ethereal muse, seductive and imaginary, who offers, as Roger Ebert put it, “the tantalizing possibility that all will be forgiven.”</p>\n<p>\n\tShe also starred opposite Jean Paul Belmondo in Philippe de Broca’s French period adventure “Cartouche” (1963). The New York Times offered its embarrassingly lusty approval: “The beautiful brunette Claudia Cardinale, who gives her all, including her life, so that he may woo his noble lady, is nobly endowed herself. And a quick, flashing smile, a pleasingly husky voice and a sense of humor add to the physical attributes not hidden by her gypsy costumes.”\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\tIn Blake Edwards’ 1963 caper comedy classic “The Pink Panther,” she starred as the Princess Dahla, who owns the jewel of the title that the thief known as the Phantom (David Niven) seeks to steal. (The actress returned to the franchise after Peter Sellers’ death for a role in 1993’s “Son of the Pink Panther,” starring Roberto Benigni.)</p>\n<p>\n\tCardinale did not have a lot to do in Richard Brooks’ 1966 Western “The Professionals,” but the plot did turn on her character: She played the wife of a wealthy man (Ralph Bellamy) who’s kidnapped by a Mexican bandit; the professionals of the title, played by Burt Lancaster and Lee Marvin, are hired to retrieve her. The film was Oscar nominated for director, screenplay and cinematography.</p>\n<p>\n\tIn Sergio Leone’s spaghetti Western “Once Upon a Time in the West,” Cardinale has one great moment as her character, a former prostitute who’s now married with children, arrives at her husband’s homestead after a trip from New Orleans to discover first a funeral procession and then the bodies of her dead offspring.</p>\n<p>\n\tIn the highly regarded 1977 miniseries “Jesus of Nazareth,” starring Robert Powell, Cardinale appeared as the Adulteress. She also had a substantial supporting role in the 1983 NBC miniseries “Princess Daisy,” based on the Judith Krantz novel.</p>\n<p>\n\tShe appeared in Werner Herzog’s notorious “Fitzcarraldo” (1982) — the film about a madman’s bizarrely noble effort that was itself a bizarrely mad but noble effort — as a madam who loves Klaus Kinski’s Fitzgerald, who seeks to drag a steamship across the Brazilian jungle, make a lot of money with it, build an opera house in the jungle and invite Caruso to sing in it.</p>\n<p>\n\tIn 1984 Cardinale starred opposite Mastroianni in Marco Bellocchio’s feature adaptation of Pirandello’s “Enrico IV” (Henry IV), and the film was in the official selection at the Cannes Film Festival.</p>\n<p>\n\tClaude Joséphine Rose Cardinale was born in Tunis, in what is now Tunisia, to parents of Sicilian heritage. Her first languages were French, Tunisian Arabic and the Sicilian language of her parents — she did not learn to speak Italian until she had already begun to be cast in Italian films.</p>\n<p>\n\tShe made her film debut in 1958’s “Goha,” by Jacques Baratier, who had wanted a native Tunisian to cast opposite Omar Sharif.\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\tAn Italian cinema organization in Tunis organized a competition to find the most beautiful Italian girl in Tunisia; the prize was a trip to Venice during the Venice Film Festival. Italian film producers spotted her there, and she was invited to attend the Experimental Center of Cinematography in Rome, but she did not stay, in part because of her lack of fluency in Italian.</p>\n<p>\n\tWhile still in her teens, she was raped, as <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/2017/film/production/cannes-film-festival-actress-claudia-cardinale-1202430992/\">she told <em>Variety</em></a> in 2017, and gave birth to her son Patrick, who was raised as her brother until the truth came out seven years later. “I was forced to accept this lie to avoid a scandal and protect my career,” she said.</p>\n<p>\n\tFranco Cristaldi, who owned the production company Vides, offered her a seven-year exclusive contract. He managed her early career, and they were married from 1966 until 1975.</p>\n<p>\n\tHer first film under the new deal was Mario Monicelli’s 1958 heist film spoof “Big Deal on Madonna Street,” starring Vittorio Gassman and Marcello Mastroianni, which was Oscar nominated for best foreign-language film.</p>\n<p>\n\tShe quickly became a very busy player on the Italian movie scene, with six features in 1959 and four in 1960. She was among the many stars in Abel Gance’s 1960 epic “The Battle of Austerlitz.”</p>\n<p>\n\tThe actress worked steadily for the next five-plus decades. “The thing I find most disturbing these days is that as soon as an actress hits 60, she gets thrown in the trash, with very few exceptions. I’m 79 and I keep working, but I don’t care about money. What I care about is helping directors who are starting out,” she told <em>Variety</em>.</p>\n<p>\n\tCardinale returned to Tunisia for Mehdu Ben Attia’s 2010 film “The String,” in which she played the wealthy mother of a gay Arab raised in France. She also appeared in Spanish director Fernando Trueba’s 2012 “The Artist and the Model” as the wife of the artist played by Jean Rochefort. Critic Rick Marianetti said: “Cardinale is wonderful — spritely and radiant — it’s difficult to comprehend that she appeared in the original ‘The Pink Panther’ and Fellini’s ‘8 ½’ in 1963.”</p>\n<p>\n\tMore recently she appeared in 2014’s Emma Thompson-scripted “Effie Gray,” the story of Victorian art critic John Ruskin’s wife, which starred Dakota Fanning.</p>\n<p>\n\tThe actress won an honorary Golden Bear at the 2002 Berlin Film Festival, a career Golden Lion at the Venice Film Festival in 1993 and a career David at Italy’s David di Donatello Awards in 1997.\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\tShe had won a special David in 1961 for her performance in Valerio Zurlini’s “Girl with a Suitcase” and best actress Davids for Damiano Damiani’s “Mafia” in 1968 and Luigi Zampa’s “A Girl in Australia” in 1971.</p>\n<p>\n\tShe is survived by two children.</p>\n</div>"

    "body": "<div><p>\n\tThe <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/tokyo-international-film-festival/\">Tokyo International Film Festival</a> is expanding its commitment to emerging talent with the launch of a new showcase section, Asian Students’ Film Conference, featuring 15 under-60-minute films from film schools across Asia.</p>\n<p>\n\tWith support from Tokyo Metropolitan Government, the competition showcases live-action and animated works that “redefine the conventional image of student films,” according to festival organizers. The selected titles include works that have been awarded at Cannes and other major festivals, offering what TIFF describes as “fresh perspective and novel insights” from diverse countries that “vividly capture contemporary societal and cultural landscapes.”\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\tLeading the lineup are works from Taiwan, China and Japan, including “Ready!

    "body": "<div><p>\n\t<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/australia/\">Australia</a> has chosen <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/gabrielle-brady/\">Gabrielle Brady</a>‘s climate-focused drama “<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/the-wolves-always-come-at-night/\">The Wolves Always Come at Night</a>” as its contender for the best international feature film category at the 2026 <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/oscars/\">Oscars</a>. </p>\n<p>\n\tThe Mongolian-language film, which combines documentary filmmaking techniques with narrative storytelling, centers on herders forced from their land by increasingly destructive weather patterns. Real-life herders Davaasuren Dagvasuren and Otgonzaya Dashzeveg star in the film while also serving as co-writers alongside Brady.\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\tAustralian selection committee members unanimously backed the choice, with a spokesperson noting: “The Australian selection committee are unanimous in their recommendation and extremely pleased to put forward ‘The Wolves Always Come at Night’ as Australia’s official submission to the Academy Awards. A striking and original portrait of a family deeply affected by climate change and its devastating effects on their traditional way of life, cultural values and homeland. A significant and brilliantly crafted feature film that everyone in the committee regarded as requisite cinema viewing.”\n</p>\n<p>\n\tBrady’s sophomore feature following “Island of the Hungry Ghosts” has built considerable momentum on the festival circuit since its Toronto Film Festival debut in the Platform Competition. The film subsequently screened at several international festivals including London, Zurich, IDFA, San Francisco International, True/False, and Sydney.</p>\n<p>\n\tThe filmmaker said: “My hope is that our film brings audiences closely into the lives of Davaa and Zaya, who face the sudden upheaval of climate displacement, but who also find ways to resist in the face of irreversible change. As our world confronts the growing reality of climate migration, sharing this story on a global stage fills me and our whole team with immense hope and pride.”\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\tThe film’s subjects added: “We are very proud that the film has been selected in this way. We hope this will lead to more people to understand the great changes happening in our pastures and landscapes now – with global warming deeply affecting us, and so many others around the world.”</p>\n<p>\n\tThe production represents an unusual three-way international collaboration between Germany, Australia, and Mongolia – reportedly the first of its kind. Rita Walsh (“The Assistant,” “Buoyancy”) produced alongside Chromosom Film’s Julia Niethammer and Guru Media’s Ariunaa Tserenpil.</p>\n<p>\n\tScreen Australia provided the primary production funding, supplemented by private investment from WeirAnderson Films and Storming Donkey Productions. Additional support came from broadcasters BBC Storyville and SWR Arte, plus distributor Madman Films. Cinephil is handling international sales.</p>\n<p>\n\tThe producing team said: “Our beautiful international collaboration was a deeply important and enriching experience for all of us. Now, being selected by the Australian committee is a hugely special moment for our film team from Australia, but also for all of our team in Mongolia, Germany, Colombia, the U.K., and the U.S. It is such an honor to compete alongside so many other outstanding films.”</p>\n<p>\n\tThe selection continues Australia’s nearly three-decade participation in the international feature category, dating back to 1996. Previous Australian submissions have included indigenous-language films “Ten Canoes” (2006), the shortlisted “Samson and Delilah” (2009), “The Rocket” (2013), and Oscar-nominated “Tanna” (2016).</p>\n<p>\n\tBrady’s film will also compete in the documentary feature category.</p>\n<p>\n\tThe Oscar international feature shortlist will be announced on Dec. 16 and the final five nominees will be announced on Jan. 22.<br /></p>\n</div>"

    "body": "<div><p>\n\tIn a shocking decision, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/apple-tv-2/\">Apple TV+</a> has <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/2025/tv/news/jessica-chastain-savant-postponed-charlie-kirk-1236527401/\">postponed the premiere of the Jessica Chastain drama series “The Savant,”</a> offering another chilling example of how business giants are running scared of the Trump administration, and bowing to pressure before it even exists. The series had been scheduled to premiere Sept. 26.</p>\n<p>\n\t“After careful consideration, we have made the decision to postpone ‘<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/the-savant/\">The Savant</a>,'” an Apple TV+ spokesperson said in a statement to <em>Variety</em>. “We appreciate your understanding and look forward to releasing the series at a future date.”\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\tBased on Cosmopolitan’s 2019 article <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cosmopolitan.com/politics/a28483247/is-it-possible-to-stop-a-mass-shooting-before-it-happens/\">“Is It Possible to Stop a Mass Shooting Before It Happens?,” </a>“The Savant” follows Jodi Goodwin (Chastain), a top-secret investigator (and a veteran) who, as an employee of the fictional Anti-Hate Alliance, infiltrates online hate groups in an effort to stop large-scale attacks of domestic terrorism. The series, adapted by Melissa James Gibson, is based on the real woman profiled in the Cosmo story, but carefully conceals her identity. On the show, Jodi lives in a Cincinnati suburb, and her husband, Charlie (Nnamdi Asomugha), who is Black, is deployed overseas.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tHaving watched the eight-episode series for review — which was set to be under embargo until Sept. 25 — it’s clear that “The Savant” is precisely the type of show America needs right now. It looks at a sector of mostly white male individuals who believe that America belongs to them. Fueled by hate, bigotry, xenophobia and misogyny, they talk cruelly and candidly online about enacting harm and violence toward individuals or “others” who they feel are unworthy of being in “their” country. Nowhere in the show does it mention Donald Trump’s name, and other than depicting white nationalists in a negative light, “The Savant” is a straightforward, non-controversial character study — and a well-paced thriller — about one woman trying to stop domestic terrorism.\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\tIt seems absolutely maddening that Apple TV+ would pull such a move, especially following the disaster that ABC and its parent company Disney faced after<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/2025/tv/news/jimmy-kimmel-returns-late-night-disney-tuesday-1236525670/\"> yanking “Jimmy Kimmel Live!”</a> off the air on Sept. 17, following his frank but fair comments after the death of Charlie Kirk. Like Disney/ABC, it seems that Apple TV+ is cowering to a presidential administration that appears to be more concerned with its own dialogue and viewpoints. As “The Savant” suggests, if we continue to exist in vacuums, unwilling to hear and listen to others while using logic and sound facts, then we are part of the problem. </p>\n<p>\n\t“The Savant” succeeds because it holds a mirror up to present-day American society, reflecting back to us who and where we are currently. The medium of television is so beautiful, because, through its storytelling capabilities, it’s able to reach people across all walks of life, and connect with varied perspectives, allowing us to continue hearing one another. Even if we struggle to find common ground. Snatching relevant TV shows off of networks and streamers out of fear and cowardice is the antithesis of what companies should be doing during this terrifying period, when American life and even the Constitution are under attack. <br /></p>\n</div>"

In a 2021 interview with <em>Variety,</em> Allende reflected on the movie adaptation, noting that in the early ‘90s, one needed a big cast as most people were not used to subtitles then. “Nowadays, it could be in Mayan, Spanish, Quechua or whatever language and you don’t need big names, just good actors,” she said.</p>\n<p>\n\tThe series is produced by FilmNation, the multi Academy Award-winning team behind “Anora” and “Conclave,” with the support of Pablo and Juan de Dios Larrain’s production company Fabula, the Chilean Oscar-winning producers of “The Eternal Memory” and “A Fantastic Woman.”</p>\n<p>\n\tAllende, Eva Longoria (“Desperate Housewives”) and Courtney Saladino (“Jessica Jones”) serve as executive producers.</p>\n<p>\n\tThe much-anticipated Chilean series will be available exclusively on Prime Video in over 240 countries and territories worldwide.</p>\n<p>\n\tIt joins a growing slate of Latin American Amazon Original productions led by “Betty La Fea: La Historia Continúa,”  “Desconectados 2 :Reconectados,” “Vencer o Morir,” “Menem” and “Sayen.”</p>\n<div>\n<figure>\n<p><img srcset=\"https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Eduard-Fernandez-y-Aline-Kuppenheim-.jpg 1712w, https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Eduard-Fernandez-y-Aline-Kuppenheim-.jpg?resize=150,84 150w, https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Eduard-Fernandez-y-Aline-Kuppenheim-.jpg?resize=300,169 300w, https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Eduard-Fernandez-y-Aline-Kuppenheim-.jpg?resize=125,70 125w, https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Eduard-Fernandez-y-Aline-Kuppenheim-.jpg?resize=1000,563 1000w, https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Eduard-Fernandez-y-Aline-Kuppenheim-.jpg?resize=910,511 910w, https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Eduard-Fernandez-y-Aline-Kuppenheim-.jpg?resize=681,383 681w, https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Eduard-Fernandez-y-Aline-Kuppenheim-.jpg?resize=450,253 450w, https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Eduard-Fernandez-y-Aline-Kuppenheim-.jpg?resize=250,140 250w\" src=\"https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Eduard-Fernandez-y-Aline-Kuppenheim-.jpg?w=1024\" alt=\"\" />\n\t</p>\n<figcaption>\n\t\t\t\t\t<span>The House of the Spirits</span>\n\t</figcaption>\n</figure>\n</div>\n</div>"

    "body": "<div><p>\n\t<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/michele-mulroney/\">Michele Mulroney</a> has been elected president of the Writers Guild of America West, with a vow to protect the writers’ health plan and push back on “free work.”</p>\n<p>\n\tMulroney, who has served as vice president of the union, ran unopposed for the union’s top job. She will take over for Meredith Stiehm, who was termed out after four years.</p>\n<p>\n\tTravis Donnelly was elected vice president and Peter Murrieta was elected secretary-treasurer.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tEight other members were elected to the board: Molly Nussbaum, Mike Royce, Maggie Levin, Rob Forman, Adam Conover, Matt Ross, Myles Warden and Marguerite MacIntyre. The ninth place finisher, Cathryn Humphris, was elected to a one-year term to replace Donnelly.\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\tThe WGA is due to negotiate its contract with the major studios next year for the first time since the 148-day strike in 2023. In her candidate statement, Mulroney said that the health plan will be a “headline issue” in those talks, noting it has not been a focus since 2017.</p>\n<p>\n\t“Since then, rapidly rising healthcare costs and fewer contributions to the Plan due to the industry contraction mean we’ll need to make smart moves in order to continue to provide the high level of care and benefits our members have fought so hard to secure,” she wrote.</p>\n<p>\n\tMulroney is a film writer who has long worked on the issue of “free work” — the practice of requiring multiple drafts before a “first draft” is submitted. The union made progress on that front in 2023, guaranteeing a paid “second step” for writers below an income threshold.</p>\n<p>\n\tIn her candidate statement, Mulroney said the “free work” issue has migrated to television, and that the issue must be addressed.\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\tThe Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers, which bargains on behalf of the studios, congratulated Mulroney on her election.</p>\n<p>\n\t“We look forward to working closely with President Mulroney to address key issues for WGA writers and to strengthen our industry with fair, balanced solutions,” an AMPTP spokesperson said.</p>\n<p>\n\tThe union said that 2,567 ballots were cast.</p>\n</div>"

    "body": "<div><p>\n\tTwo former executives at the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/los-angeles-film-school/\">Los Angeles Film School</a> allege in a lawsuit that the school has operated a massive student loan scam for years that involves arranging for thousands of fake job placements for its graduates.</p>\n<p>\n\tThe executives also claim that the school, located on Sunset Boulevard in Hollywood, lied to the Department of Education during a 2017 audit in an effort to cover up the fraud.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tDave Phillips, the school’s former VP of career development, and Ben Chaib, the former VP of admissions, filed a whistleblower lawsuit against the school in 2024. The suit, unsealed earlier this year, alleges that “nearly all” of the tens of millions of dollars the school receives each year from federal student aid programs is the result of fraud.\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\tThe suit accuses the school of “hoodwinking” thousands of students with false claims about graduates’ prospects for employment.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tThe school offers two- and four-year degrees in film and music production, animation and other fields, with tuition ranging from $40,000 to $80,000 per program, according to its website.</p>\n<p>\n\tAccording to the suit, Phillips “observed the vast majority of LAFS graduates were not able to obtain entry level positions.” The lawsuit quotes an internal agenda stating that most graduates “report a yearly income of 0-$5,000 in their field of study.”</p>\n<p>\n\tLAFS receives about $85 million per year in federal assistance, of which about $60 million comes from student loans, the suit states. Another $19 million comes in veterans’ education grants.</p>\n<p>\n\tThe school is owned by James “Bill” Heavener, the CEO, and three partners, who also own and control Full Sail University in Winter Park, Fla. Like LAFS, Full Sail also offers online and in-person instruction in entertainment production and related fields. According to the complaint, Full Sail receives $377 million per year in federal assistance.\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\tThe two former executives allege in the lawsuit that LAFS and Full Sail engaged in fraud in order to meet a key accreditation benchmark — namely, that at least 70% of graduates are able to find work in their field. If they failed to maintain their accreditation, the schools risked losing eligibility for federal student aid.</p>\n<p>\n\tThe complaint alleges that LAFS executives estimated that, at best, 20% of graduates would be able to find work on their own, and so for the remaining 50%, they had to “engineer the gigs.”</p>\n<p>\n\tAccording to the complaint, LAFS paid Ivar Music Group and other entities nearly $1 million from 2010-17 to “hire” its graduates for two-day jobs. The suit alleges that LAFS controlled who would be hired, when they would work and how much they would be paid.</p>\n<p>\n\tThe suit states that the two schools “self-financed thousands of temporary employment opportunities for their graduates through schemes with non-profits and paid-off vendors to give the false impression to incoming students and federal regulators that their graduates were gainfully employed.” </p>\n<p>\n\tThe Los Angeles Film School is expected to file a motion to dismiss the complaint on Oct. 1. In a joint statement of the case filed last week, the school’s attorneys denied the claims, saying that Phillips and Chaib are attempting “to resuscitate time-barred and erroneous allegations, which were already thoroughly investigated and settled by the Department of Education.”</p>\n<p>\n\tThe whistleblower complaint alleges that in addition to arranging for fake jobs, LAFS also illegally tied compensation for its sales team to student enrollment.</p>\n<p>\n\tThe suit further alleges that LAFS executives lied to Department of Education auditors by denying the existence of the incentive compensation system and failing to disclose the link to Ivar Music Group.</p>\n<p>\n\tIn the statement filed last week, LAFS says that the Department of Education conducted a “comprehensive investigation” into the allegations from 2017-2020, resulting in the settlement.</p>\n<p>\n\tThe Accrediting Commission of Career Schools and Colleges last renewed the school’s accreditation in 2023 for a five-year period. The ACCSC did not respond to a request for comment. </p>\n<p>\n\tPhillips, a former William Morris agent, was a vice president in charge of job placement at LAFS, as well as an adviser to the board. Chaib was recruited to work for the school after working in admissions at other for-profit colleges, including Heald College and the University of Phoenix. Each worked at LAFS for 12 years and were members of the top-level executive team.\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\tPhillips left the school in 2022. According to a suit the school filed against him, his contract was not renewed. The school alleged in the lawsuit that Phillips’ counsel later sent LAFS a demand letter that included quotations from his conversations with Heavener and Tammy Elliott, the school’s president. Heavener and Elliott sued, alleging that Phillips had invaded their privacy by secretly recording them. That suit was later dismissed.</p>\n<p>\n\tAccording to the filing made last week, the school reached a settlement with Phillips in 2023. A separate settlement was reached with Chaib in 2021. LAFS alleges that both released their claims against the school at that time, but are now engaged in “a campaign to extract additional money.”</p>\n<p>\n\tPhillips and Chaib filed the whistleblower lawsuit in June 2024, seeking to recover fraudulently obtained student aid funds on behalf of the U.S. government. Private individuals who help bring such misconduct to light can reap 25-30% of any recovery.</p>\n<p>\n\tThe U.S. Department of Justice opted not to get involved in the case last May, leading to the suit being unsealed.</p>\n<p>\n\tAn attorney for the school, Mazda Antia, declined to comment to <em>Variety</em>.</p>\n<p>\n\tThe federal government issued a series of regulations in the 2010s to crack down on for-profit colleges, and state and federal investigations led to the closures of Corinthian Colleges — the owner of Heald College — and ITT Technical Institute.</p>\n<p>\n\tIn 2009, the University of Phoenix paid $67.5 million to settle a whistleblower action brought by two former employees. The case involved allegations of incentive-based compensation for recruiting students. The two former employees were awarded $19 million.</p>\n<p>\n\tThe Department of Education fined Heald College in the amount of $29.7 million in 2015, after determining that the school had lied about its job placement statistics.</p>\n</div>"
