Discovery, Fox and Disney, which was ultimately dissolved. Before that Schwab was a senior HR executive at Apple focusing on the tech giant’s services division that is home to Apple TV+, Sports, Video and Music. \n\t</p>\n<p>\n\tSchwab was at Disney from 2018 to 2023. During that time, she was part of the executive team that launched Disney+ — which required an enormous amount of recruiting and HR support as the streaming unit ramped up to reach global scale at a fast clip.</p>\n<p>\n\tAt Disney and elsewhere, Schwab gained experience managing large teams through complicated M&A and IPOs.</p>\n<p>\n\tSchwab’s appointment is the latest move to bolster UTA’s corporate support staff since Kramer took the reins as CEO of the talent agency in June. </p>\n</div>"

    "body": "<div><p>\n\t<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/amanda-seyfried/\">Amanda Seyfried</a>‘s sweeping musical drama “<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/the-testament-of-ann-lee/\">The Testament of Ann Lee</a>” has found distribution after its <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/venice-film-festival/\">Venice film festival</a> premiere, where it was<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/2025/film/festivals/amanda-seyfried-venice-testament-of-ann-lee-premiere-1236503241/\"> embraced with a rousing 15-minute standing ovation</a>. Searchlight Pictures has acquired rights for North America and most international territories with plans to release the movie theatrically in 2025.</p>\n<p>\n\tDirected by Mona Fastvold, “The Testament of Ann Lee” follows Seyfried as the title character, the founding leader of the Shakers, a radical religious moment that began in the late 1700s. Lee, one of the few female religious leaders of the 18th century, and her followers were known for worshipping through ecstatic song and movement. Thomasin McKenzie, Lewis Pullman, Stacy Martin, Tim Blake Nelson, Christopher Abbott and Matthew Beard also star in the film.\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\t“I was raised in a secular household, and yet Ann Lee’s prophecies — however implausible — moved me deeply. Not because I share her faith, but because I recognize in her a yearning for justice, transcendence and communal grace,” Fastvold said in a statement. “Her radical pursuit of a self- fashioned utopia speaks to the creative impulse at the heart of all artistic endeavor: the urgent need to shape the world anew.”</p>\n<p>\n\tIn <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/2025/film/news/the-testament-of-ann-lee-review-amanda-seyfried-1236503769/\">a positive review for <em>Variety</em></a>, critic Guy Lodge praised the film’s “enthralling, borderline-absurd musical numbers” and the performance of the leading lady. “On paper, this might all sound quite bloodless and conceptual,” he wrote. “In practice, it has an earnest, full-hearted sweep, in large part thanks to a performance of redoubtable commitment and nerve-deep feeling by Amanda Seyfried — far from the musical terrain of either “Mamma Mia!” or “Les Misérables,” but fully in command of her gifts — in the title role.”\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\tFastvold co-wrote “The Testament of Ann Lee” with her partner Brady Corbet. The two most recently penned “The Brutalist,” directed by Corbet. That film, a three-hour and 30-minute epic, was acquired by A24 out of last year’s Venice and scored 10 Oscar nominations in addition to $50 million at the global box office. Fastvold’s other films include 2014’s “The Sleepwalker” and 2020’s “The World to Come.”</p>\n<p>\n\tDuring the official press conference for “The Testament of Ann Lee,” Fastvold and Corbet got candid about the challenges of financing the independent film for just $10 million. The story focuses on a lesser-known chapter of American history, which means the movie wasn’t the most obvious sell to financiers.</p>\n<p>\n\t“It was quite a feat,” Corbet said. “As you can imagine, the elevator pitch for ‘Shaker musical’ wasn’t the easiest to get off the ground.”</p>\n<p>\n\tDespite a lean budget (major studio movies can cost at least five times as much), Fastvold managed to create massive set pieces and craft elaborate musical numbers to bring Ann Lee’s story to the big screen.</p>\n<p>\n\t“I thought Ann Lee deserved something grandiose and wonderful,” said Fastvold. “How many stories have we seen about male icons on a grand scale, again and again and again? Can we not see one story about a woman like this?”</p>\n</div>"

    "body": "<div><p>\n\t“KPop Demon Hunters” has broken yet another viewership record.</p>\n<p>\n\tAfter <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/2025/film/news/kpop-demon-hunters-netflix-most-watched-movie-history-1236496106/\">becoming Netflix’s most popular movie of all time</a> in late August, the musical fantasy had its 15th straight week on the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/netflix/\">Netflix</a> Top 10 during the Sept. 22-28 viewing window, becoming the longest-running title ever on the English-language films chart. Previously, that record was held by “Red Notice,” which has charted 14 times total. The new achievement is additionally impressive as “KPop Demon Hunters” achieved its 15 weeks consecutively, whereas “Red Notice” originally charted for 12 weeks in a row before making two appearances later on. Additionally, “KPop Demon Hunters” has spent eight of its 15 weeks in the No. 1 position and seven weeks at No. 2. It has yet to fall to No. 3 or lower, making it presumable that it will continue to last on the Top 10 for weeks to come — especially when considering that the film notched 19.3 million views in its 15th week, nearly doubling the viewership of the No. 2 title (“Ruth & Boaz,” which debuted with 10.3 million views).\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\t“Wayward” was the top title on the English-language TV chart, debuting with 8.2 million views in its first four days of streaming. It was followed by “Black Rabbit” in its second week of streaming with 7 million views and the debut of “House of Guinness” with 5.2 million views in four days. \n</p>\n<p>\n\tAt No. 4 with 4.4 million views, “Wednesday” Season 2 had its eighth week on the chart overall and its fourth week since the release of Part 2. That brings the season’s total to 107 million views thus far, putting it at No. 7 on Netflix’s all-time list for English-language TV, which is measured based on each title’s first 91 days of streaming. Though the season premiered on Aug. 6, Netflix reset that clock with the release of Part 2 on Sept. 3, meaning the season still has until early December to continue climbing closer to “Wednesday” Season 1, which is the No. 1 most popular English-language Netflix show ever with 252.1 million views.\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\tSee the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/netflix-top-10/\">Netflix Top 10</a> for the week of Sept. 22-28 below, beginning with English-language shows and movies followed by non-English language shows and movies.</p>\n<p>\n\t<em>More to come…</em></p>\n<div>\n<figure>\n<p><img srcset=\"https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Screenshot-2025-09-30-at-3.26.04-PM.png 1310w, https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Screenshot-2025-09-30-at-3.26.04-PM.png?resize=150,119 150w, https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Screenshot-2025-09-30-at-3.26.04-PM.png?resize=300,238 300w\" src=\"https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Screenshot-2025-09-30-at-3.26.04-PM.png?w=1024\" alt=\"\" />\n\t</p>\n<figcaption>\n\t</figcaption>\n</figure>\n</div>\n<div>\n<figure>\n<p><img srcset=\"https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Screenshot-2025-09-30-at-3.21.37-PM.png 1304w, https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Screenshot-2025-09-30-at-3.21.37-PM.png?resize=150,122 150w, https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Screenshot-2025-09-30-at-3.21.37-PM.png?resize=300,243 300w\" src=\"https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Screenshot-2025-09-30-at-3.21.37-PM.png?w=1024\" alt=\"\" />\n\t</p>\n<figcaption>\n\t</figcaption>\n</figure>\n</div>\n<div>\n<figure>\n<p><img srcset=\"https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Screenshot-2025-09-30-at-3.26.21-PM.png 1274w, https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Screenshot-2025-09-30-at-3.26.21-PM.png?resize=150,122 150w, https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Screenshot-2025-09-30-at-3.26.21-PM.png?resize=300,243 300w\" src=\"https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Screenshot-2025-09-30-at-3.26.21-PM.png?w=1024\" alt=\"\" />\n\t</p>\n<figcaption>\n\t</figcaption>\n</figure>\n</div>\n<div>\n<figure>\n<p><img srcset=\"https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Screenshot-2025-09-30-at-3.26.39-PM.png 1250w, https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Screenshot-2025-09-30-at-3.26.39-PM.png?resize=150,126 150w, https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Screenshot-2025-09-30-at-3.26.39-PM.png?resize=300,252 300w\" src=\"https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Screenshot-2025-09-30-at-3.26.39-PM.png?w=1024\" alt=\"\" />\n\t</p>\n<figcaption>\n\t</figcaption>\n</figure>\n</div>\n</div>"

    "body": "<div><p>\n\tWhen the 12th edition of the Sharjah International Film Festival for Children and Youth rolls out its green carpet on Oct. 6, it won’t be chasing star power or celebrity glitz. Instead, under the leadership of <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/sheikha-jawaher-bint-abdullah-al-qasimi/\">Sheikha Jawaher bint Abdullah Al Qasimi</a>, the festival has built a reputation as a platform with “a heart and purpose,” driven by education, cultural exchange, and a commitment to amplifying young voices.</p>\n<p>\n\tLaunched in 2012 at the behest of Her Highness Sheikha Jawaher bint Mohammed Al Qasimi, wife of the Ruler of Sharjah, the festival began as the first event in the Gulf dedicated exclusively to children’s cinema. The director recalls, “People were not so aware that there were different types of children’s films. There are documentaries, there are shorts, different kinds of animation.”\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\tShe stresses that the vision was always distinct from other regional showcases. “Her Highness envisioned a festival with a different purpose,” she explains. “It’s rooted in education, culture, and inspiration for the children and the youth.”\n</p>\n<p>\n\tFrom a starting point of mainly screenings in its debut year, the festival has steadily grown into a multi-venue event with panels, workshops, and thousands of submissions. “Now, we have around 100 guests, filmmakers, directors, and celebrities coming in and sharing knowledge,” Sheikha Jawaher reflects. “We have panel discussions, we get thousands of kids coming from schools all around the UAE to attend, to watch films, and to discuss them.” Since 2013, the festival’s inception, the event has welcomed a total of 236,254 guests.\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\tThis year’s edition will showcase 76 films from 26 countries, selected from more than 1,700 submissions, including first-time participation from São Tomé and Príncipe, Ecuador, and Belize. Three Middle East premieres are slated for the green carpet, including Saudi filmmaker Sarah Talab’s “Hajeer,” Dutch animation “Miss Moxy,” and a South Korean drama from Suryeon Jung recounting the story of a 10-year-old girl isolated from the world. On the sidelines, a pop-up program will feature workshops ranging from Emirati comics to a photography and documentation tour, while panels and keynote sessions will delve into the role of cinema in shaping youth culture. Additionally, guests can attend a film market offering young storytellers a platform to pitch projects, find collaborators, and explore pathways to production</p>\n<p>\n\t<strong>Rooted in Sharjah’s Cultural Vision<br /></strong>The festival reflects the emirate’s broader cultural strategy. “Sharjah has always prioritized culture, knowledge, family, and human development,” Sheikha Jawaher emphasizes. “So we wanted to be a platform where cinema inspires learning, dialogue, empowerment, and inspiration.”</p>\n<p>\n\tThat mission has given SIFF a distinctive identity in a crowded regional calendar. “We’re not here to replicate what you see in Marrakech or Cairo,” she remarks. “We’re here to nurture young voices. That’s what makes us different.”</p>\n<p>\n\t<strong>Elevating Youth Perspectives<br /></strong>At the core of the programming are films both for young audiences and, increasingly, by them. “The films that we screen are for children and youth, as well as by children,” Sheikha Jawaher explains, while noting that the percentage of the programming that comes directly from children filmmakers is still modest, but steadily increasing. As it stands, they make up around 20% of the festival’s programming.</p>\n<p>\n\tTo encourage more authentic work, the festival offers feedback sessions for young applicants whose films aren’t accepted. “We need to be very transparent and very real in this industry,” she underscores. “So when we do reject some of the films, we explain what they can do to enhance the quality. We want to encourage them to submit again.”</p>\n<p>\n\tCuration prizes originality and experimentation. “We look first and foremost, of course, for authenticity,” she states. “We also look for bold experimentation, projects that raise the bar higher and push the boundaries.”\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\t<strong>Broadening Global Connections<br /></strong>SIFF has steadily widened its international footprint, increasing the number of submissions and their countries of origin year after year. That expansion has prompted Sheikha Jawaher to set a new goal: bringing in countries that have never participated in SIFF. “We want to hear stories from all the countries in the world,” she emphasized.</p>\n<p>\n\tIn its 2024 edition, the festival inaugurated the Country of Honor, with Palestine holding that distinction and programming featuring a spate of Palestinian films. She noted that media sometimes questioned whether such a choice was too polarizing. “I remember being asked in interviews, “Isn’t that too political? You’re talking about refugees. You’re talking about wars,” she recounted. “I said, ‘We’re not political. We’re talking about stories. Our kids cannot live in bubbles anymore. They need to know. They need to have a voice so they can make a difference.”</p>\n<p>\n\tThis year, South Korea will be recognized as the Country of Honor, with a strand exploring the history and philosophy of Korean cinema and its global reach.</p>\n<p>\n\tThe 2025 festival will also debut the Children and Youth Film Congress, a new forum designed to bring together filmmakers, industry professionals, and educators to exchange experiences, address challenges, and explore ways to better support youth-focused cinema.</p>\n<p>\n\tSIFF’s jury will also feature 16 international directors and experts, among them Syrian actress Yara Sabri, known for her work in acclaimed drama series, and South Korean animation director Jae Hoon Ahn, best known for “Green Days.”</p>\n<p>\n\t<strong>Challenges and Growth<br /></strong>Building awareness and fostering media literacy has been central to not only SIFF’s mission, but its growth. Still, running a youth-focused festival has not been without hurdles. “At the beginning, people thought, ‘Why are you watching films that are not English or Arabic?’” Sheikha Jawaher recalls. “With time and the boom of Korean titles, for example, more people are open to actually watching a film that’s not in their language, but still having the same feelings. The film will still make you cry, whether you understand what’s being said, whether it’s silent.”</p>\n<p>\n\tParents, too, sometimes resisted films that showed uncomfortable truths. She cites an instance where a mother objected to the content of a film: “She came out saying, ‘Oh my God, the film! The child in the film ate a pebble, and now my son will eat a pebble. What are we teaching our kids?’ And I smiled and I said, ‘But this is reality. We cannot sugarcoat it.’”\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\tUltimately, the festival’s steward affirms, such moments highlight why the festival’s educational role matters. “We cannot ban everything,” she insists. “Kids need to understand consequences, to see reality, but always framed within dialogue and discussion.”</p>\n<p>\n\t<strong>Looking Ahead<br /></strong>As for the next decade, Sheikha Jawaher has an ambitious vision. By 2030, she hopes SIFF will be “a leading platform in the region for young voices where every single aspiring filmmaker in the Arab world knows they can share their work, gain mentorship, and be part of the global conversation.” By 2035, she adds, “I hope it stands as a global reference point for youth cinema. My dream is that the filmmakers who started their journey at the film festival will return as mentors.”</p>\n<p>\n\tFor her, the personal journey has been just as transformative. “It’s taught me that young people have incredible depth of imagination and resilience,” she reflects. “When given the chance, they tell stories with honesty, courage, and creativity. It reminded me that storytelling is about identity, connection, and hope. The youngest voices often carry the most powerful truths.”</p>\n<p>\n\tThat, ultimately, is the festival’s promise: to center stories too often overlooked, and to do so with sincerity. “It gives us a uniqueness,” she affirms. “We are a festival with a heart and purpose.”</p>\n</div>"

    "body": "<div><p>\n\t<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/nicole-kidman/\">Nicole Kidman</a> has officially filed for divorce from <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/keith-urban/\">Keith Urban</a> after 19 years of marriage, <em>Variety</em> has confirmed. News of the Oscar winner filing paperwork in Nashville arrives one day after<em> </em><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/2025/film/news/nicole-kidman-keith-urban-separated-1236534501/\"><em>Variety</em> confirmed </a>Kidman and the country music star were separating. The former couple share two daughters, Sunday Rose and Faith Margaret, who are now 17 and 14 years old, respectively.</p>\n<p>\n\tUrban and Kidman got married in Sydney, Australia in June 2006 after meeting a year prior at the G’Day USA gala in Los Angeles, an event promoting Australia. They went on to become one of Hollywood’s most visible power couples for nearly two decades, with Urban often attending Kidman’s various film events (from premieres to award ceremonies like the Oscars and Emmy Awards) and Kidman attending Urban’s concerts and other music events. The two walked the red carpet together at the Academy of Country Music Awards in May 2025 and were spotted in Nashville in June watching the Los Angeles Football Club play a game during the FIFA Club World Cup.\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\tIn the first months of their marriage, Kidman notably staged an intervention for Urban amid his struggles with alcohol abuse. Urban entered rehab and would go on to credit Kidman as being integral to his rehabilitation and sobriety. When Kidman was awarded the AFI Lifetime Achievement Award in 2024, Urban <a href=\"https://youtu.be/o9g8sd2qtNw\" target=\"_blank\">recounted in his tribute speech</a> how much of a positive influence she was on his life when they met.</p>\n<p>\n\t“Four months into a marriage, I’m in rehab for three months,” Urban said. “I had no idea what was going to happen to us … and if you want to see what love in action really looks like, give that a whirl. Nic pushed through every negative voice, I’m sure even some of her own, and she chose love. And here we are tonight, 18 years later.”\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\t“She’s raw, but resilient; she’s serious and a complete goofball. She also has a bit of a mantra, ‘Choose love.,” Urban added the time. “She has the capacity to love like no one I’ve ever met.”</p>\n<p>\n\tKidman and Urban celebrated their 19th wedding anniversary in June. Urban marked the occasion by <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/DLVlJ3OTJJu/?hl=en\" target=\"_blank\">posting on Instagram</a> a black-and-white photo of the couple embracing along with the caption: “Happy Anniversary Baby.”</p>\n</div>"

    "body": "<div><p>\n\tAt just 22, Emirati filmmaker <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/ali-fuad/\">Ali Fuad</a> is already building the kind of career he once dreamed of while sitting in dark theaters at the Sharjah International Film Festival for Children & Youth. “I’ve attended since I was 16,” he says. “I would watch screenings and Q&As with filmmakers and tell myself, ‘One day that’s going to be me.’”</p>\n<p>\n\tThis year, Fuad comes full circle with two documentaries in the official selection: “Oh Yamal,” a meditation on the UAE’s pearl diving past, and “Guardians of the Mountains,” an exploration of tribal traditions preserved for over millennia.\n\t</p>\n<div>\n<figure>\n<p><img srcset=\"https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Guardians-of-the-Mountains.jpg 1000w, https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Guardians-of-the-Mountains.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Guardians-of-the-Mountains.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Guardians-of-the-Mountains.jpg?resize=910,607 910w, https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Guardians-of-the-Mountains.jpg?resize=681,454 681w, https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Guardians-of-the-Mountains.jpg?resize=450,300 450w, https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Guardians-of-the-Mountains.jpg?resize=250,167 250w\" src=\"https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Guardians-of-the-Mountains.jpg?w=1000\" alt=\"\" />\n\t</p>\n<figcaption>\n\t\t\t\t\t<span>“Guardians of the Mountains”</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCourtesy of Ali Fuad\n\t</figcaption>\n</figure>\n</div>\n<p>\n\t<strong>The Sharjah Pipeline<br /></strong>For Fuad, SIFF has been more than a platform — it has been a pipeline. He served as a junior juror in 2021, an experience he credits with sharpening his critical eye. “They treated us as professional jurors,” he recalls fondly. “They taught us not to just say a movie is good or bad, but to ask why. That confidence to engage with filmmakers at just 18 built a lot in me.”\n</p>\n<p>\n\tTwo years later, Fuad premiered “Office War,” a satirical short he made as part of his coursework at Middlesex University in Dubai, before a festival audience. “Seeing your film on the big screen, with dozens of people laughing and asking questions is truly a dream come true,” he recounts. “You start to realize it’s not just about making films, it’s about connecting with audiences. That love of interaction grows with the craft.”</p>\n<p>\n\t<strong>Unearthing Untold Stories<br /></strong>Fuad’s SIFF 2025 entries continue his mission to spotlight overlooked local Emirati stories. “Oh Yamal” revisits the history of pearl divers whose labor underpinned the UAE’s economy long before oil wealth became synonymous with the Emirates in particular, and the Gulf more generally. “We grew up hearing these stories, but there were no films about them,” he explains. “I wanted people today to remember the resilience of our ancestors, the danger of the sea, the months away from families, the sacrifices.”\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\tHe frames the peril of long months at sea, divers leaving home without knowing if they’d return, through the music that carried them. “I didn’t want to focus only on the struggle,” he notes. “The songs carried their spirit. They made the divers resilient and kept them going.”</p>\n<p>\n\tHe likens the chants to a kind of ancestral archive, voices that still resonate centuries later. “You don’t even need to understand the words,” Fuad stresses. “The emotions tell you everything.”</p>\n<p>\n\tIn “Guardians of the Mountains,” Fuad turns his lens to the Shihuh tribe living in the mountains along the UAE-Oman border. Their dialect, virtually unchanged for two millennia, proved challenging even for him to follow. “When I first visited, I thought, ‘Am I still in the UAE?’ Their traditions are completely different,” he remarks.</p>\n<p>\n\tInitial nerves steadily gave way to deep trust. The locals welcomed him warmly, framing his film as part of their own effort to preserve and pass down their culture. For Fuad, that generosity transformed the project from an act of documentation into one of cultural stewardship, where he was tasked with carrying Shihuh voices forward.</p>\n<p>\n\t<strong>From ‘Magical Glasses’ to Middlesex<br /></strong>Fuad’s filmmaking journey began at just 15 with “Magical Glasses,” produced through the UAE Ministry of Education’s Masterpieces program. The short fantasy, about spectacles that reveal people’s true intentions, was made “mainly for fun,” he admits, but it ignited a lifelong passion. “That love of filmmaking started to grow. From then, I knew I wanted to tell stories from my culture, from this environment.”</p>\n<p>\n\tHe later trained at Warsaw Film School, where he studied under industry veterans who have worked on major European and Hollywood productions. “Even though it was just a year, it felt like three or four years of experience,” he reflects. “Every month I was on a set. Being surrounded by that environment, by that energy really made me who I am today.”</p>\n<p>\n\tBack in the UAE, Fuad directed commercials and joined Image Nation’s Arab Film Studio program, where he learned to handle the pressures of a professional set. “Commercials are fast, fancy, expensive. What it taught me was how to manage a crew and deal with responsibility,” he observes. “When I moved into documentaries, it felt easier: fewer people, less equipment, more time. That made it more artistic.”\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\t<strong>Looking Ahead<br /></strong>Fuad sees his generation of Emirati filmmakers as crucial to safeguarding cultural identity in an ever more globalized world. “The younger generation is drifting from Arabic, from local traditions,” he warns. “That’s why it’s more important than ever to make Emirati films, to archive these stories so they’re not lost.”</p>\n<p>\n\tHis ultimate ambition is a feature-length documentary chronicling the UAE’s history from ancient traditions to the present. “I want a film where anyone who enters the theater leaves knowing everything about the UAE: pearl diving, Bedouins, agriculture, the desert, the sea,” he emphasizes.</p>\n<p>\n\tBeyond that, he has his sights set on fiction, eager to push himself into narratives that might look nothing like the work he’s doing now, a deliberate step into unfamiliar territory, fueled by a desire to explore the reaches of his storytelling.</p>\n<p>\n\tRather than simply a showcase, Fuad views SIFF as a launchpad. With the festival betting on its film market and even more networking platforms, he sees it as a venue to meet collaborators and build sustainable momentum toward larger projects. Being in that environment, he remarks, makes the idea of directing a feature feel less like a dream and more like the next step.</p>\n<p>\n\tFor now, though, he’s savoring the moment. Having once imagined himself on the festival stage, Fuad is now a two-time entrant, sharing deeply personal stories with the audiences who first inspired him. “I didn’t expect to have two films selected,” he concedes. “It motivates me to keep going. Festivals like Sharjah make you forget the hard days on set. They remind you why you do this.”</p>\n</div>"
