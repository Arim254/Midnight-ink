Instead, De Niro pretended to be the new mafioso FCC chairman who was tearing down free speech on behalf of Trump.\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\t“So you tell Whoopi over there, she better show a little respect or the only view she’s getting is from under George Washington. The bridge, not the guy,” De Niro began. He was referring to “The View” host Whoopi Goldberg, whose fellow ABC talk show stayed silent over Kimmel’s suspension last week and finally addressed the controversy on Monday. After yanking Kimmel off the air, Carr then threatened “The View” last week.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tWhen Kimmel asked if he was threatening Goldberg, De Niro replied, “I would never threaten Miss Goldstein. I was just teaching a lesson about consequences.”</p>\n<p>\n\tKimmel followed that up by saying, “Pardon me for saying, and maybe you’re the wrong guy to talk to, but it seems like the FCC is using mob tactics to suppress free speech.” He also reminded the supposed chairman that the FCC will fine the show for swearing on air.</p>\n<p>\n\tDe Niro then went on an expletive-ridden rampage, saying “What the fuck did you just say to me? I am the fucking FCC. I can fucking say whatever the fuck I want.”</p>\n<p>\n\tWatch the video below.</p>\n<figure><p>\n<iframe width=\"500\" height=\"281\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/c1tjh_ZO_tY?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\"></iframe>\n</p></figure>\n</div>"

    "body": "<div><p>\n\tAn emotional <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/jimmy-kimmel/\">Jimmy Kimmel</a> returned to the late-night on Tuesday and spoke out for the first time about his six-day suspension from ABC. </p>\n<p>\n\tKimmel opened the program with clips from different news outlets reacting to his suspension, with one anchor deeming tonight’s show “one of the most pivotal moments in broadcast history.” The show then cut to the host and his sidekick, Guillermo Rodriguez, backstage, costumed as a tiger and a banana, respectively. Kimmel then deadpanned, “We should probably change.”  \n\t</p>\n<p>\n\tKimmel was welcomed by his audience with rapturous applause as he stepped out for his monologue. He then, without missing a stride, quipped, “I’m not sure who had a weirder 48 hours, me or the CEO of Tylenol.” \n</p>\n<p>\n\tHe made sure to thank all of his allies in the industry who spoke out for him, including Stephen Colbert, John Oliver, Conan O’Brien, James Corden, Jay Leno, Howard Stern and David Letterman. But he also made a point to thank the voices who supported him from the far right. </p>\n<p>\n\t“Maybe most of all, I want to thank the people who don’t support my show and what I believe, but support my right to share those beliefs anyway,” he said. “People I never would have imagined,<br />like Ben Shapiro, Clay Travis, Candace Owens, Mitch McConnell, Rand Paul. Even my old pal Ted Cruz, who, believe it or not, said something very beautiful on my behalf.”</p>\n<p>\n\tHe added, “Even though I don’t agree with many of those people on most subjects, some of the things they say even make me want to throw up, it takes courage for them to speak out against this administration, and they did and they deserve credit for it.”\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\tThe host then addressed his Sept. 15 comments on the death of conservative activist Charlie Kirk. Voice breaking, tears in his eyes, he proclaimed, “It was never my intention to make light of the murder of a young man.”</p>\n<p>\n\t“I don’t think there’s anything funny about it,” he said. “I posted a message on Instagram on the day he was killed, sending love to his family and asking for compassion, and I meant it. And I still do. Nor was it my intention to blame any specific group for the actions — it was a deeply disturbed individual. That was really the opposite of the point I was trying to make, but to some, that felt ill-timed or unclear or maybe both, and for those who think I did point a finger, I get why you’re upset. If the situation was reversed, there’s a good chance I would have felt the same way. I have many friends and family members on the other side who I love and remain close to, even though we don’t agree on politics at all. I don’t think the murderer who shot Charlie Kirk represents anyone, this was a sick person who believed violence was a solution, and it isn’t.” </p>\n<p>\n\tLouis Virtel, a writer on “Jimmy Kimmel Live,” also addressed the matter in his podcast “Keep It.” When guest Guy Branum suggested that the FCC’s role in Kimmel’s suspension was a “clear assault by this president and his administration,” Virtel responded that “it almost felt like they were just waiting for the right phrase to pounce on.” Emphasizing his support of Kimmel’s controversial comments, he said, “This is particular wording was illustrating a point and you are choosing to say it means this other thing.”</p>\n<p>\n\t“I think joke-telling is often the fastest way to tell the truth, and tell the truth in a way people remember,” Virtel said later in the podcast. “But when it comes to the word ‘fascism,’ actually, I feel like we all<br />just need to say ‘No. Bad.’ There’s nothing to say. There’s no irony to put on this.”</p>\n<p>\n\tDuring his monologue on Monday, Sept. 15, Kimmel said “the MAGA gang” was “desperately trying to characterize this kid who murdered Charlie Kirk as anything other than one of them,” which was interpreted by some as inaccurate and distasteful. Two days later, Donald Trump’s FCC chairman, Brendan Carr, threatened regulatory pressure on broadcasters who aired such remarks, and Nexstar and Sinclair, companies that own roughly one-quarter of ABC’s affiliate channels, vowed to preempt Kimmel’s show. The Disney-owned ABC immediately followed suit, benching Kimmel “indefinitely.”\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\tThe suspension led to a swift backlash, as <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/2025/tv/news/disney-protests-jimmy-kimmel-pressure-fcc-nexstar-trump-1236523938/\">protests broke out in New York and Los Angeles,</a> and Democratic (and some Republican) politicians decried what they viewed as a breach of the First Amendment. 400 celebrities <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/2025/tv/news/400-celebrities-aclu-protest-jimmy-kimmel-suspension-1236526119/\">signed an open letter</a> with the ACLU protesting Disney’s decision.</p>\n<p>\n\tOn Monday, ABC announced Kimmel would return on Tuesday. The network <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/2025/tv/news/jimmy-kimmel-returns-late-night-disney-tuesday-1236525670/\">wrote in a statement</a> that Kimmel’s comments were “ill-timed and thus insensitive,” and ABC decided to suspend “Jimmy Kimmel Live” to “avoid further inflaming a tense situation at an emotional moment for our country.” The statement concluded, “We have spent the last days having thoughtful conversations with Jimmy, and after those conversations, we reached the decision to return the show on Tuesday.”</p>\n<p>\n\tStill, Tuesday’s broadcast did not reach all ABC stations around the country. Despite Disney’s decision to bring “Jimmy Kimmel Live” back to the air, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/2025/tv/news/nexstar-will-not-air-jimmy-kimmel-joining-sinclair-boycott-1236526911/\">Nexstar and Sinclair maintained that they would continue to preempt the show</a> for the time being. </p>\n</div>"

    "body": "<div><p>\n\tPresident <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/donald-trump/\">Donald Trump</a> slammed <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/abc/\">ABC</a>‘s decision to bring <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/jimmy-kimmel/\">Jimmy Kimmel</a> back to late-night TV — and said, “I think we’re going to test ABC out on this.”</p>\n<p>\n\t“I can’t believe ABC Fake News gave Jimmy Kimmel his job back,” Trump wrote on his Truth Social platform. “The White House was told by ABC that his Show was cancelled! Something happened between then and now because his audience is GONE, and his ‘talent’ was never there.” \n</p>\n<p>\n\tTrump continued, “Why would they want someone back who does so poorly, who’s not funny, and who puts the Network in jeopardy by playing 99% positive Democrat GARBAGE. He is yet another arm of the DNC and, to the best of my knowledge, that would be a major Illegal Campaign Contribution. I think we’re going to test ABC out on this. Let’s see how we do. Last time I went after them, they gave me $16 Million Dollars. This one sounds even more lucrative. A true bunch of losers! Let Jimmy Kimmel rot in his bad Ratings.”\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\tThe $16 million Trump referenced is the total sum <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/2024/tv/news/abc-news-settles-donald-trumps-defamation-suit-15-million-1236249439/\">Disney paid to settle Trump’s defamation suit against ABC News</a> and anchor George Stephanopoulos. In December 2024, Disney agreed to pay a settlement of $15 million to Trump’s presidential library (plus $1 million in legal fees) after Stephanopoulos asserted incorrectly in March 2024 on ABC News’ “This Week” that Trump had been found “liable for rape by a jury.” (In fact, a jury’s verdict found <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/2023/politics/news/donald-trump-verdict-e-jean-carroll-rape-case-1235607751/\">Trump liable for sexually abuse</a> in a civil case brought by writer E. Jean Carroll.)</p>\n<p>\n\tAfter ABC pulled “Jimmy Kimmel Live!” off the air Sept. 17 over comments the host made about Charlie Kirk’s killer, Disney on Monday <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/2025/tv/news/jimmy-kimmel-returns-late-night-disney-tuesday-1236525670/\">said the show would be coming back to regular timeslot on Tuesday</a>. “We have spent the last days having thoughtful conversations with Jimmy, and after those conversations, we reached the decision to return the show on Tuesday,” Disney, ABC’s parent company, said in a statement. <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/2025/tv/news/sinclair-abc-stations-wont-air-jimmy-kimmel-live-1236526649/\">Sinclair</a> and <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/2025/tv/news/nexstar-will-not-air-jimmy-kimmel-joining-sinclair-boycott-1236526911/\">Nexstar Media</a>, two large station groups that had previously said they were preempting Kimmel over his Kirk comments, said Tuesday they will not air “Jimmy Kimmy Live!” for the time being.\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\tTrump’s comments last week about Kimmel made it seem as if the president believed the show had been canceled and that Kimmel had been “fired.”</p>\n<p>\n\t“Great News for America: The ratings challenged Jimmy Kimmel Show is CANCELLED,” <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/2025/tv/news/trump-celebrates-jimmy-kimmel-pulled-abc-1236522617/\">Trump wrote on Truth Social</a> on Sept. 17. “Congratulations to ABC for finally having the courage to do what had to be done. Kimmel has ZERO talent, and worse ratings than even Colbert, if that’s possible. That leaves Jimmy and Seth, two total losers, on Fake News NBC. Their ratings are also horrible. Do it NBC!!! President DJT”</p>\n<p>\n\tAt <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/2025/tv/global/donald-trump-jimmy-kimmel-denies-free-speech-infringement-1236523342/\">a press conference</a> in the U.K. last Thursday, Trump said Kimmel was “fired because of bad ratings more than anyone else.” He also said, “Jimmy Kimmel is not a talented person. He had very bad ratings, and they should have fired him a long time ago. So, you know, you can call that free speech or not. He was fired for lack of talent.” Trump added that Kimmel “said a horrible thing about a gentlemen called Charlie Kirk.” (Kimmel had not said anything on the show about Kirk himself.)</p>\n<p>\n\t<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/2025/tv/news/nexstar-jimmy-kimmel-abc-charlie-kirk-1236522584/\">ABC’s suspension of Kimmel’s show last week</a> came after two big station groups — Nexstar and Sinclair — said they were dropping “Jimmy Kimmel Live!” over Kimmel’s remarks on the Sept. 15 show that “the MAGA gang” was trying to portray Charlie Kirk’s killer “anything other than one of them.” Earlier that same day, FCC chair Brendan Carr said on a podcast that unless ABC “took action” with respect to Kimmel, there would be “additional work for the FCC ahead,” which he suggested would be to investigate complaints of “news distortion” against the network. Carr warned, “We can do this the easy way or the hard way.” The FCC chairman said Kimmel’s commentary was “some of the sickest conduct possible.”</p>\n<p>\n\tDisney’s full statement on Monday (Sept. 22) read, “Last Wednesday, we made the decision to suspend production on the show to avoid further inflaming a tense situation at an emotional moment for our country. It is a decision we made because we felt some of the comments were ill-timed and thus insensitive. We have spent the last days having thoughtful conversations with Jimmy, and after those conversations, we reached the decision to return the show on Tuesday.”</p>\n</div>"

    "body": "<div><p>\n\t<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/australia/\">Australia</a> has chosen <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/gabrielle-brady/\">Gabrielle Brady</a>‘s climate-focused drama “<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/the-wolves-always-come-at-night/\">The Wolves Always Come at Night</a>” as its contender for the best international feature film category at the 2026 <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/oscars/\">Oscars</a>. </p>\n<p>\n\tThe Mongolian-language film, which combines documentary filmmaking techniques with narrative storytelling, centers on herders forced from their land by increasingly destructive weather patterns. Real-life herders Davaasuren Dagvasuren and Otgonzaya Dashzeveg star in the film while also serving as co-writers alongside Brady.\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\tAustralian selection committee members unanimously backed the choice, with a spokesperson noting: “The Australian selection committee are unanimous in their recommendation and extremely pleased to put forward ‘The Wolves Always Come at Night’ as Australia’s official submission to the Academy Awards. A striking and original portrait of a family deeply affected by climate change and its devastating effects on their traditional way of life, cultural values and homeland. A significant and brilliantly crafted feature film that everyone in the committee regarded as requisite cinema viewing.”\n</p>\n<p>\n\tBrady’s sophomore feature following “Island of the Hungry Ghosts” has built considerable momentum on the festival circuit since its Toronto Film Festival debut in the Platform Competition. The film subsequently screened at several international festivals including London, Zurich, IDFA, San Francisco International, True/False, and Sydney.</p>\n<p>\n\tThe filmmaker said: “My hope is that our film brings audiences closely into the lives of Davaa and Zaya, who face the sudden upheaval of climate displacement, but who also find ways to resist in the face of irreversible change. As our world confronts the growing reality of climate migration, sharing this story on a global stage fills me and our whole team with immense hope and pride.”\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\tThe film’s subjects added: “We are very proud that the film has been selected in this way. We hope this will lead to more people to understand the great changes happening in our pastures and landscapes now – with global warming deeply affecting us, and so many others around the world.”</p>\n<p>\n\tThe production represents an unusual three-way international collaboration between Germany, Australia, and Mongolia – reportedly the first of its kind. Rita Walsh (“The Assistant,” “Buoyancy”) produced alongside Chromosom Film’s Julia Niethammer and Guru Media’s Ariunaa Tserenpil.</p>\n<p>\n\tScreen Australia provided the primary production funding, supplemented by private investment from WeirAnderson Films and Storming Donkey Productions. Additional support came from broadcasters BBC Storyville and SWR Arte, plus distributor Madman Films. Cinephil is handling international sales.</p>\n<p>\n\tThe producing team said: “Our beautiful international collaboration was a deeply important and enriching experience for all of us. Now, being selected by the Australian committee is a hugely special moment for our film team from Australia, but also for all of our team in Mongolia, Germany, Colombia, the U.K., and the U.S. It is such an honor to compete alongside so many other outstanding films.”</p>\n<p>\n\tThe selection continues Australia’s nearly three-decade participation in the international feature category, dating back to 1996. Previous Australian submissions have included indigenous-language films “Ten Canoes” (2006), the shortlisted “Samson and Delilah” (2009), “The Rocket” (2013), and Oscar-nominated “Tanna” (2016).</p>\n<p>\n\tBrady’s film will also compete in the documentary feature category.</p>\n<p>\n\tThe Oscar international feature shortlist will be announced on Dec. 16 and the final five nominees will be announced on Jan. 22.<br /></p>\n</div>"

It’s the type of story that Prodigy Corporation’s CEO Boy Kavalier (<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/samuel-blenkin/\">Samuel Blenkin</a>) has built an empire on, becoming the world’s youngest trillionaire, as he’s on the brink of changing humanity by transferring terminally ill children’s subconsciousness into synthetic bodies. \n\t</p>\n<p>\n\tThroughout the season, Boy Kavalier’s real intentions begin to take over Neverland Research Island after successfully securing the alien specimens that the USCSS Maginot had been researching in space, discarding his decade-long work on the hybrids. It’s until the finale that the perspective on Kavalier’s eccentric behavior begins to shift for the Lost Boys as they’re being held in a cell while the island is being terrorized by a loose Xenomorph, killing all Prodigy Corporation guards in sight.

How do you imagine his childhood was after being raised by something that was programmed for his own needs?</strong>\t</h5>\n<p>\n\tSo much of how that experience formed him is present throughout the whole series, especially in the sense of someone who doesn’t have any examples in his life of when he has failed in order for him to be humbled slightly. He’s never been humbled before. This character has two separate lives, one is the life that he had before the event of when he killed his father, and the hero version of himself that he invented at some point down the road. He’s got this little part of himself where his father was abusive and horrible to him that’s locked up deep inside. </p>\n<p>\n\tWhen you’re completely surrounded by people who consistently say yes to you, it turns you into a Boy Kavalier type of person. I imagine it being a very strange upbringing, and one that was very fast in coming into power. He ultimately had success at his fingertips from a very young age, and that really does something to somebody.</p>\n\t<h5>\n\t\t<strong>We see Hermit (Alex Lawther) get under Boy’s skin as he’s present on the research island with Wendy (Sydney Chandler) after the rescue mission. Does his hatred for Hermit stem from the knowledge that both siblings had a proper childhood with a father who cared for them, which is something he lacked?</strong>\t</h5>\n<p>\n\tHe can’t have what Hermit has with Wendy, which is an emotional connection that is bonded by being a family. It’s something that he actively got rid of, and removed from his life. The reason why that turns into hatred [for Hermit] is because nobody deserves to have that connection with something or someone that he views as his property. He sees Hermit as a big threat to his ownership of Wendy.</p>\n\t<h5>\n\t\t<strong>There’s a line that Boy says to Dame Sylvia (Essie Davis) in Episode 2, where he reveals that all he wants is to have a proper conversation with someone who is smarter than him. In the final moments of Episode 8, he’s being held hostage with the newfound realization Wendy and the rest of the Lost Boys have been able to outsmart him. Does his final laugh come from the fact that he’s successfully gotten exactly what he’s asked for, which is finally being challenged by something or someone?</strong>\t</h5>\n<p>\n\tThat’s absolutely what’s going through his head. When that laugh comes out, it comes from a sense of what happens in “Peter Pan” is suddenly happening in real life. Wendy is saying that the Lost Boys have to grow up and leave Neverland in order to have meaningful lives. It’s the fact that the book that he loves so much is coming true in real life, but also, he’s kind of proud of them! They did a great job. \n\t</p>\n\t<h5>\n\t\t<strong>He’s looking at them from above in the cage like, “My kids did that!”</strong>\t</h5>\n<p>\n\tExactly, he’s so arrogant about it! He’s like, “I invented these guys and they’re doing exactly what I wanted!” They’ve gone far beyond what he thought they were capable of. That laugh is just filled with admiration for them. </p>\n\t<h5>\n\t\t<strong>While he got his wish of wanting to be challenged intellectually, the hybrids have no idea he’s celebrating his victory even after being chased around by a Xenomorph. </strong>\t</h5>\n<p>\n\tIt’s horrible. I was really excited about the fact that we get a couple of moments in this episode where he does get taken down a rung, as he has been such an arrogant and obnoxious character for the whole season. When he comes face to face with the Xenomorph for the first time, suddenly this performance that he’s been doing for the whole series of being a hero in his own journey completely falls away. In that moment, he is flesh and blood. That moment for me was very much a sense of being my body and realizing how vulnerable my skin is. </p>\n\t<h5>\n\t\t<strong>By seeing the Xenomorph in front of him, he realizes that there’s no one left to protect him, because he’s always been guarded with protection all around him on the island. He’s the reason why so many of his staff members are dead, and while he got what he wanted, it’s not what he imagined.</strong>\t</h5>\n<p>\n\tIt’s a great scene to happen after he’s talking about his father. I love that during that moment, the door swings open [to the cell], and he decides to walk in anyway to talk. It’s that upbringing of never having failed in life and choosing to believe that he can’t be beaten. It takes looking into the Xenomorph’s jaws for him to realize he is actually just a mortal human being.</p>\n\t<h5>\n\t\t<strong>Each episode of “Alien: Earth” is driven by music, from the heavy metal needle drops to Noah Hawley releasing song covers to amplify the soundscape of the series. As a musician who has previously written music for other characters you’ve portrayed in projects like “Mary & George,” if you were asked to compose a song for Boy Kavalier for the series, what do you imagine it would sound like? </strong>\t</h5>\n<p>\n\tThe song would be all about him, and it would be completely unbearable! Nobody watching would want to listen to it. In fact, I’ve been meaning to send Noah some of my work because I write my own songs, and I love the fact that he incorporates music into all of his projects in different ways. So, who knows, maybe in a couple of years! We’ll see. \n\t</p>\n<p>\n\t<em>This interview has been edited and condensed.</em><br /></p>\n</div>"

These beings have the consciousnesses of human children but synthetic, grown-up bodies, and, in the season finale, their leader, Wendy (Sydney Chandler), has orchestrated something of a coup. As the season ends, Wendy — having been awakened to the depredations of adults after watching a fight between authority figures Kirsh (Timothy Olyphant) and Morrow (Babou Ceesay) — has enlisted a Xenomorph, whom she controls, to help place Kirsh, Morrow, Boy Kavalier (Samuel Blenkin) and Dame Sylvia (Essie Davis) into a cage. As for what lies beyond her taking control of the Neverland research island? Wendy intends, she tells her fellow hybrids, to “rule.”\n\t</p>\n<div>\n<figure>\n<p><img srcset=\"https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/AlienEarth-finale.Wendy_.jpg 1200w, https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/AlienEarth-finale.Wendy_.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/AlienEarth-finale.Wendy_.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/AlienEarth-finale.Wendy_.jpg?resize=1000,667 1000w, https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/AlienEarth-finale.Wendy_.jpg?resize=910,607 910w, https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/AlienEarth-finale.Wendy_.jpg?resize=681,454 681w, https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/AlienEarth-finale.Wendy_.jpg?resize=450,300 450w, https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/AlienEarth-finale.Wendy_.jpg?resize=250,167 250w\" src=\"https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/AlienEarth-finale.Wendy_.jpg?w=1024\" alt=\"\" />\n\t</p>\n<figcaption>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCourtesy of Patrick Brown/FX\n\t</figcaption>\n</figure>\n</div>\n<p>\n\tWendy’s awakening, and her use of a clawed creature to enforce her will, recalls Daenerys’ journey on “Game of Thrones,” a decade of TV history ago. But it’s also pure <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/noah-hawley/\">Noah Hawley</a>: The “Alien: Earth” creator, known for “Fargo” and “Legion,” is deeply concerned with what it means to be human — and, as various of his characters have done over time, what it means to opt out. Wendy’s decision going forward, he tells <em>Variety </em>in a postmortem interview about Season 1, is about whether to lean into the flickers of humanity within her or to lean <em>out</em> and embrace the fact that she was built to be something more. It’s a battle that her brother Joe (Alex Lawther) feels deeply, as he remains uncertain whether his sister is really still his sister. (This same human-or-not dynamic also infuses the long-awaited fight between Morrow, a man with some cybernetic upgrades, and Kirsh, a fully synthetic being who delights in being beyond the realm of the human.) \n\t</p>\n<p>\n\tAhead of the “Alien: Earth” finale, Hawley spoke with <em>Variety </em>about all of these complications and how they might inform the show going forward. As he waits to see if “Alien: Earth” will get a Season 2 renewal, Hawley is beginning to plot his next move: “The moment they fire the starting gun,” he says, “I’m out of the block.”</p>\n\t<h5>\n\t\tIn the season’s final moments, it’s clear that Wendy has come into her own. I was really struck by the way that Joe looked at her fearfully during this sequence — and I wondered if that was a sign that she’s embracing her hybrid side more, and moving away from her humanity.\t</h5>\n<p>\n\tThat’s the central question of the series, right? Is Wendy going to choose “human” or “other”? There’s a push-pull between her brother, who represents, on some level, the best of humanity, and the Kirsh or Boy Kavalier sense of, <em>Why settle for human when there’s so much potential there?</em> So her brother is realizing that whatever big brother pull he had is really gone at this point. </p>\n<p>\n\tThe problem with letting children have all that power is that their executive function isn’t great, and their sense of consequences isn’t necessarily fully developed. There’s a hubris there. As she says, “Maybe this Xenomorph could be good,” right? Those of us who know Xenomorphs are like, <em>Well, maybe it can be controlled for a period of time… </em>So it’s worrisome, because she has all this power, but she doesn’t yet have the perspective he thinks she needs.</p>\n<div>\n<figure>\n<p><img srcset=\"https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Wendyandbrother.AlienEarth.jpg 1200w, https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Wendyandbrother.AlienEarth.jpg?resize=150,102 150w, https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Wendyandbrother.AlienEarth.jpg?resize=300,205 300w\" src=\"https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Wendyandbrother.AlienEarth.jpg?w=1024\" alt=\"\" />\n\t</p>\n<figcaption>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCourtesy of  Patrick Brown/FX\n\t</figcaption>\n</figure>\n</div>\n\t<h5>\n\t\tWhat did allowing Wendy to communicate with and to control the Xenomorph open up for you in the writing process?\t</h5>\n<p>\n\tIt obviously gives her a very powerful sidekick, as we see in the last couple of [episodes]. But also, the moment she releases this creature, it kills a bunch of people, and she doesn’t watch. She isn’t facing the consequences of that decision, but there is a real moral conundrum that she’s going to face if part of her power is in causing the injury or death of human beings. Then where’s her moral high ground? </p>\n<p>\n\tFor me, violence, which is so inevitable on “Fargo” and on “Alien” — I never want violence to be entertainment. I always want it to be impactful and meaningful, and to confront the audience with their desire for it. And those moments where we’re trained as an audience to feel like violence is the only way to resolve a conflict, let’s look at that a little more closely and see how we feel about it. \n\t</p>\n\t<h5>\n\t\tThat brings me to the fight between Morrow and Kirsh — which is both exciting, in the sense that we’re finally seeing what it looks like when a cyborg and a synthetic fight, but also thematically rich. It’s (altered) man vs. machine. \t</h5>\n<p>\n\tThe moment I wrote the elevator scene, I knew that you’ve got to pay it off on some level. You don’t want to make people wait for the second season. The hubris of [Morrow’s] statement “Man will always win. It’s a question of will.” Then 25 seconds later, he’s choked out by the machine. It’s like, don’t count the villain out, right? Freddy Krueger never dies. </p>\n<p>\n\tThat battle, on some level, is a fight between heroes and villains, right? And I’d love to take a poll of the audience and say, <em>Who do you want to win this fight? </em>Because I don’t know for sure. It’s like when you see Captain America fight Iron Man, and you’re like, <em>I don’t know what I’m rooting for — neither of them can die</em>. You don’t want that to happen. But who’s right? It becomes a question of whether you believe in authority, or whether you believe in rebellion. </p>\n\t<h5>\n\t\tAll of the show’s authority figures — Morrow, Kirsh, Boy Kavalier, Dame Sylvia — end the season caged, with a Xenomorph looming above them, looking potentially ready to pounce. Will any of them be taken off the board in a potential Season 2? If they’re staying, how will this shape their journeys?  \t</h5>\n<p>\n\tI think what we’ve seen throughout history is: Don’t count the villains out, right? The worst thing you could do is humiliate them or hand them a defeat, because it makes them more dangerous in the long run. There’s always a moment in which somebody humiliates the villain and now all the love in him is gone. </p>\n<div>\n<figure>\n<p><img srcset=\"https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/AlienEarth-finale-Olyphant.jpg 1200w, https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/AlienEarth-finale-Olyphant.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/AlienEarth-finale-Olyphant.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/AlienEarth-finale-Olyphant.jpg?resize=1000,667 1000w, https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/AlienEarth-finale-Olyphant.jpg?resize=910,607 910w, https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/AlienEarth-finale-Olyphant.jpg?resize=681,454 681w, https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/AlienEarth-finale-Olyphant.jpg?resize=450,300 450w, https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/AlienEarth-finale-Olyphant.jpg?resize=250,167 250w\" src=\"https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/AlienEarth-finale-Olyphant.jpg?w=1024\" alt=\"\" />\n\t</p>\n<figcaption>\n\t\t\t\t\t<span>Timothy Olyphant as Kirsh </span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCourtesy of Patrick Brown/FX\n\t</figcaption>\n</figure>\n</div>\n\t<h5>\n\t\tDid Kirsh’s perspective on the Prodigy project shift over the season — or were we just gradually given more insight into how he had always felt about it? \t</h5>\n<p>\n\tThere’s a moment when Kirsh says to Hermit’s character — Hermit’s asking, <em>How do I take care of my sister? </em>And Kirsh says, “That’s like an onion asking ‘How do I take care of a star?’” That’s his perspective on what human beings are, right?</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd so if you think that he was created by humans, and works for humans, and in many ways is programmed with some prime directives not to harm humans or cause them to be harmed — and yet, deep down inside, he knows he’s superior to all of them. That’s kind of a recipe for a personality disorder. Think of all of the people you know who are like, <em>I’m smarter than everybody else </em>— you’re like, you do not have a happy life ahead of you. So I don’t think it’s as much an evolution of his, but more of a sense that he was put in charge of these creatures and has been conducting these experiments, and you begin to realize that maybe the experiments also involve the hybrids and the humans, and that there’s a larger permission that was given.\n\t</p>\n\t<h5>\n\t\tCan we talk about my favorite little guy? The alien eyeball entering Arthur’s (David Rysdahl) body seemed to open up new avenues for a potential Season 2.\t</h5>\n<p>\n\tWhen we met this creature, it was inside this obviously dead cat. So I think we know that it can reanimate a body. For me, there’s something more symbolic about it. If Arthur is the moral center of the show — and perhaps the best of humanity, who died because of the worst qualities of humanity, and now isn’t even allowed to rest in peace, there’s a certain sort of final corruption that happens, in a “Pet Sematary” way. To take the thing that you love and bring it back as other can be really the most disconcerting for an audience.</p>\n\t<h5>\n\t\tUnderstanding that the timeline of this show totally excludes “Prometheus” and “Alien: Covenant,” I am struck by the fact that its events take place shortly before the events of the original 1979 “Alien.” In a potential Season 2, do you think you’ll get closer to that timeline and integrate it? \t</h5>\n<p>\n\tI think there are bridges that you cross right when you come to them. A big part of the world-building and the act of creation on these first eight episodes was to build something that was coherent to itself, that worked within the construct of the movies — the first two movies. </p>\n<p>\n\tIn success, in a Season 2 and beyond, then we really need to dig down and start to think about how these two stories are going to cohere together in the long term. And that doesn’t mean that I don’t have thoughts about it, or haven’t had thoughts about it, but in terms of the planning — part of why I’m successful in this business is that I know which problems I need to solve today, and which problems I need to solve tomorrow. And I don’t worry about tomorrow’s problems until tomorrow. They’re exciting problems — you realize, 50 years later, that you were only looking at half of the puzzle, and now I have to build the other half of the puzzle, to conform to the pieces of the original. I like a challenge like that. I wouldn’t take on this kind of IP if I didn’t, on some level, think that the constraints make for innovation.</p>\n\t<h5>\n\t\tAre you working on writing a Season 2 right now?\t</h5>\n<p>\n\tNo, it’s conversational at this point. You learn to be efficient and don’t work ahead of yourself. There’s conversations that are going on — obviously, the show’s about to wrap, and we’ll get a really complete sense of what the viewership was, and I would imagine that a decision would follow soon after as to whether to do a second season. Obviously, none of us — Disney or myself — want a single day longer than necessary to get a second season on the air, in success. Everyone wants to get this decision right. But we also want to be ready to go. I certainly know where I’m going. The moment they fire the starting gun, I’m out of the block.\n\t</p>\n\t<h5>\n\t\tThis is a bit of an irreverent note to end on, but I’m just curious. Every episode of “Alien: Earth” has ended with a blast of ‘90s metal. I lived for it! But what is going on with that music choice, week after week? \t</h5>\n<p>\n\tI’ve got a lot of quippy ways to talk about it — classic movie, classic rock — but at the end of the day, we made an arena show. We didn’t make the Paramount Theater show. We made the Shea Stadium show. And I wanted to end with that level of emotion that comes from Metallica or Jane’s Addiction or Pearl Jam. You want the big feeling! And those songs — I see you, “Alien” fans, and I know what you listen to, because I listen to it too, right? There’s nothing more rock and roll than an “Alien” movie.</p>\n<p>\n\t<em>This interview has been edited and condensed.</em></p>\n</div>"
