    "body": "<div><p>\n\tIf you purchase an independently reviewed product or service through a link on our website, Variety may receive an affiliate commission.</p>\n<p>\n\tDelta is rolling out a new <a href=\"https://news.delta.com/delta-welcomes-youtube-and-youtube-premium-onboard\" target=\"_blank\">on-board experience</a> for passengers, that will allow them to <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/2025/biz/news/delta-youtube-inflight-viewing-1236269238/\">view content from YouTube </a>— including YouTube Premium and YouTube Music — on their airline’s <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/in-flight-entertainment/\">in-flight entertainment</a> (IFE) system.</p>\n<p>\n\tFirst announced at <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/2025/shopping/news/best-of-ces-2025-new-tech-1236264278/\">CES in January</a>, the partnership with YouTube adds a curated selection of the streaming site’s content to Delta’s existing offerings, which include <a href=\"https://www.delta.com/us/en/onboard/inflight-entertainment/delta-studio\" target=\"_blank\">Delta Studios</a> for a wide selection of movies, TV shows, music and audiobooks, plus live TV from <a href=\"https://www.tkqlhce.com/click-8134669-15210722?sid=VR&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.directv.com%2Faffiliates%2Fstream\" target=\"_blank\">DirecTV</a> and more entertainment options. The partnership also allows YouTube access via in-flight WiFi and mobile devices, starting on Thursday, Sept. 25.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tAccording to Delta officials, traveling from point-A to point-B doesn’t have to be a bore anymore. While more and more people <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/travel/\">travel</a> with their smartphones and tablets these days to pass the time, airlines like Delta are making sure passengers’ <a href=\"https://www.rollingstone.com/product-recommendations/lifestyle/rolling-stone-travel-awards-2025-1235346426/\" target=\"_blank\">in-flight entertainment experience</a> is just as smooth as the flight itself.</p>\n<p>\n\tDelta’s Managing Director of Engagement & Optimization Sarah Downs says the airline has long been committed to ensuring that the in-flight experience mirrors consuming content at the theater — or at home. “We’re giving customers ways to enjoy content from their favorite studios in multiple ways from multiple screens, just like you might do at home,” Downs tells Variety, noting the “personalization of the seatback screen” through the airline’s ‘Delta Sync’ seatback experience.</p>\n<p>\n\tDelta Sync is the airline’s feature that pairs with the company’s mobile app and your seatback display, providing up-to-the-minute information on your flight, arrival times, gate and baggage information and more. It even has a “continue watching” feature that lets you pick up where you left off if you’re making a connecting flight, but still want to finish <a href=\"https://www.delta.com/us/en/onboard/inflight-entertainment/tv\" target=\"_blank\">TV episodes</a> of “The Office,” “The Last of Us” and “Downton Abbey,” for example, or catch the end of <a href=\"https://www.delta.com/us/en/onboard/inflight-entertainment/current-movies\" target=\"_blank\">movies</a>, like recent Delta releases, “Sinners” and “Lilo & Stitch.”\n</p>\n<p>\n\t“The ‘Continue Watching’ feature allows customers to continue watching flight over flight, so if you didn’t finish watching a movie on the first leg of your trip, you can pick it up after your layover, or on your return flight,” Downs explains. Delta Sync also offers a media recommendation engine that is “serving up content we think you’ll enjoy,” she says, “[and] creating a more seamless and connected experience from trip-to-trip.”</p>\n<p>\n\tOn a recent trip with Delta, we noticed the robust entertainment options with hit movies and TV shows across various genres and styles. However, we were completely surprised with the addition of films from the <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/s?k=criterion+collection&crid=2HOM4GBSGFD85&sprefix=criter%2Caps%2C164&linkCode=ll2&tag=variety0e8-20&linkId=cd07b47319021bf891dac19ec51bfd45&language=en_US&ref_=as_li_ss_tl&asc_source=web&asc_campaign=web&asc_refurl=https%3A%2F%2Fvariety.com%2F2025%2Fshopping%2Fnews%2Fdelta-air-lines-in-flight-entertainment-review-offerings-1236422442%2F\" target=\"_blank\">Criterion Collection</a>, such as “Blood Simple,” “A Brighter Summer Day,” “The Rules of the Game,” “8 1/2” and others. These titles are not often found on in-flight entertainment offerings, so their inclusion was a big surprise and delight on long-haul flights. It’s not often you can watch “Chungking Express” or “In The Mood For Love” on a flight to Hong Kong.</p>\n<p>\n\tThe addition of those films was intentional, Downs explains. “We had several collections with ‘film lover’ organizations [like] Letterboxd, Criterion Channel and The Black List’ [and] we featured those collections to provide some additional diversity to our content offering and to give customers something they wouldn’t necessarily expect to see onboard,” she says. </p>\n<p>\n\tThat’s in addition to partnering with “most of the major movie studios to add fresh content monthly,” she continues, adding that “Our curation team works with them and other partners to ensure customers can enjoy the very best content onboard.” Downs says Delta is now also curating from film festivals to provide an even wider selection of movies onboard.</p>\n<p>\n\tMeanwhile, while other airlines are taking away seatback screens and asking customers to use their own mobile devices, Delta is upgrading their own touchscreens with intelligent 4K HDR QLED displays for vivid and sharp picture quality, as well as built-in Bluetooth connectivity for wireless headphones, and new “do not disturb” features for more comfortable flights. As part of Delta Sync, the company says aircrafts are now also outfitted with stronger and faster WiFi (<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/2025/shopping/news/t-mobile-experience-mobile-plans-sign-up-online-1236378464/\">free for T-Mobile subscribers</a>) and able to accommodate more entertainment and experience options from <a href=\"https://paramountplus.qflm.net/c/256585/175360/3065?subId1=VR&sharedId=VR&u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.paramountplus.com\" target=\"_blank\">Paramount+</a>, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/2025/biz/news/delta-youtube-inflight-viewing-1236269238/\">YouTube</a>, <a href=\"https://crunchyrollstore.sjv.io/c/256585/1730612/20100?subId1=VR&sharedId=VR&u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.crunchyroll.com%2F%3Fsrsltid%3DAfmBOopGVSZYBmeiS5Wl23nAxzn-B6iUlOoxsAQIg0krqX_SQQHtfBT_\" target=\"_blank\">Crunchyroll</a>, <a href=\"https://go.skimresources.com/?id=87443X1540253&xs=1&xcust=VR&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.americanexpress.com&sref=https%3A%2F%2Fvariety.com%2F2025%2Fshopping%2Fnews%2Fdelta-air-lines-in-flight-entertainment-review-offerings-1236422442%2F\" target=\"_blank\">American Express</a>, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/2024/music/news/spotify-delta-passport-series-connecting-artists-1235864823/\">Spotify</a>, Atlas Obscura, Resy and other brands and services, so you can hit the ground running when you arrive at your destination.\n</p>\n<p>\n\t“We’re doubling down on that seatback investment with the coming next-gen Delta Sync seatback platform, which will truly transform the inflight viewing experience,” Downs explains. “We’re continuing to look for ways to lead the industry in IFE, not just in the number of our seatback screens but in the quality and richness of our overall experience.”</p>\n<p>\n\tWhile Delta is seemingly leading the pack with the best in-flight entertainment options — thanks to their wide selection of movies, TV shows, music and playlists, audiobooks, podcasts, games, <a href=\"https://www.delta.com/us/en/onboard/inflight-entertainment/live-tv\" target=\"_blank\">live TV</a>, kids entertainment and much more — it hopes that the wider implementation of Delta Sync will make customer flights smoother and easier, while allowing the airline company to continue to set the bar high.</p>\n<p>\n\t“A big part of what makes Delta stand out today is our commitment to personalization across the entire customer journey,” says Downs. “One of our guiding principles is blending smart technology with the warmth of our team to deliver experiences that feel tailored, relevant and meaningful.”</p>\n</div>"

    "body": "<div><p>\n\tAs <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/2025/film/news/jaff-market-cinepoint-indonesias-film-boom-1236525440/\"><em>Variety</em> recently reported</a>, Indonesian cinema has achieved a remarkable market reversal, with local films now commanding the dominant box office position over Hollywood imports. But behind those statistics lies a more complex story of creative evolution, strategic risk-taking, and an industry learning to balance local authenticity with global ambitions.</p>\n<p>\n\tThe architects of this transformation — <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/indonesia/\">Indonesia</a>’s producers — are now grappling with how to sustain momentum while navigating everything from censorship battles to the challenge of serving 400 ready-to-release films through a distribution system that can only handle 150 annually.\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\tThe numbers underline the scale of the shift. Year-to-date admissions in 2025 stand at 55.8 million for local films (63% market share) against 33.4 million for imports (37%), for a total of 89.2 million. That builds on 2024’s 126 million admissions and Cinepoint forecasts of Indonesian films reaching 100 million admissions annually by 2026, with overall growth projected at 10% per year. Film output is expected to rise from 152 titles in 2024 to around 200 by 2028, while screen count, now at 2,200, is projected to reach 2,700 by 2030. Yet per capita admissions remain below 0.5, highlighting the industry’s headroom for growth.\n</p>\n<p>\n\t“I believe the key lies in the quality of storytelling and production value, regardless of the genre,” says Edwin Nazir, chair of the Association of Indonesian Film Producers (<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/aprofi/\">APROFI</a>). “Over the past couple of years, we’ve seen an increase in the release of high-quality Indonesian films. These films have appealed to broader audiences due to their storytelling quality and genre variation, including animation and cross-genre films such as horror-comedy and drama-action.”\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\tShanty Harmayn, APROFI advisory board member and head of Base Entertainment, points to films like animated hit “Jumbo” and science-fiction love story “Sore” as proof that audiences want more than formula. “There are films for many type of audience. But most important, there are some films that offer something new and pushed boundaries,” she says. She also emphasizes careful release management: “We need to be careful on how many films are being released on the same week, for each film to have the best chance in getting their audience.”</p>\n<p>\n\tThe horror cycle, long a staple of Indonesian cinema, continues but with diminishing returns. “While horror films are still performing well, they are not as strong as last year, and drama films appear to be gaining popularity again,” Nazir notes. Harmayn adds: “There is a cycle of having too many horror films and it creates saturation. But then the cycle is broken with one or two films that pushed the boundaries and offers something fresh, the cycle will start again.”</p>\n<p>\n\tFor <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/yulia-evina-bhara/\">Yulia Evina Bhara</a>, head of international relations at APROFI and founder of KawanKawan Media, the central principle is relevancy. “We need to come up with a film that is relevant for both the global and the local market,” she explains. That means targeting Indonesia’s young, digitally native audience. “Gen Z and young millennials are the main audience,” Harmayn stresses. “Stories need to resonate with them and marketing strategies also need to understand how to communicate with them especially in digital media realm.”</p>\n<p>\n\tStreaming platforms have become crucial as both revenue stream and creative incubator. “Streaming platforms have positively influenced audience movie-viewing habits, benefiting the entire ecosystem,” Nazir says. Harmayn calls them an important secondary channel after theatrical, while Bhara cautions that platforms must support diversity to avoid oversaturation: “If the streamers fail to catch this momentum, I predict that we will plunge into a highly saturated market which could result in the declining trust of the very market that initially waited to explode.”</p>\n<p>\n\tDistribution, however, remains the structural weak link. “As of mid-year, approximately 400 films were ready for theatrical release; however, Indonesian cinemas are constrained to screening only about 150 films annually due to the limited number of screens available,” Bhara says. Nazir adds that investors are eager for production, “but the industry also needs more players in the distribution and exhibition sectors, since we are still under-screened.”\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\tProducers are clear about the need for government action. “More theatres need to be built, and these theaters need to cater to the need of different kind of market. We need theaters in small towns and big towns alike,” Bhara argues. Nazir calls for consistent policy support: “It’s about time for Indonesia’s film industry to have public production funds, tax incentives or rebate schemes, and other policies that will promote growth.”</p>\n<p>\n\tOn censorship, Nazir notes an encouraging shift: “In the past couple of years, we’ve seen an improvement in how our censorship board views films. They are now focusing more on classification and are more open to dialogue with filmmakers. We need to ensure this positive trend continues so it can fully transform from a censorship body to a classification board.”</p>\n<p>\n\tCo-production has become a defining strategy. APROFI members are showcasing several international co-productions at the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/busan-international-film-festival/\">Busan International Film Festival</a>. Harmayn cites “Mothernet,” an Indonesian-language project directed by a Malaysian, shot by a Singaporean cinematographer, and financed with support from Singapore and Taiwan. Bhara’s credits include co-productions “Autobiography,” “Tiger Stripes,” “Whether the Weather Is Fine,” and “The Fox King,” while Nazir highlights collaborations with Korea through IP adaptations and co-financing deals. “We can anticipate more collaborative projects involving various Asian countries in the coming years,” he says.</p>\n<p>\n\tInvestment appetite is rising, but sustainability is the concern. “There are more players in the investment sector, they are looking for projects,” Bhara says. “The challenge is how to keep these investments sustainable. We need to repay the faith of the investors by making sure that film industry is indeed lucrative, so that they don’t lose their faith and invest somewhere else.”</p>\n<p>\n\tLooking ahead, Bhara defines success as building infrastructure that matches creative ambition. “We can go there by supporting our filmmakers who come up with different and very personal stories; by encouraging international co-productions with other countries to cement our position in global film production; and by making sure that censorship will not take away the brilliance of our filmmakers.”\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\tHarmayn adds: “Build on quality, variety, pushing boundaries and understanding our audience and what is relevant for them.” Nazir underscores the producer’s central role: “Since the industry is driven by content, producers play a crucial role in continuously producing high-quality content that appeals to broader audiences, both locally and internationally.”</p>\n<p>\n\tAs the market data tracked by partnerships like JAFF Market and Cinepoint demonstrates Indonesian cinema’s quantitative success, the producers driving this transformation are focused on qualitative challenges that will determine whether the current boom becomes a sustainable cultural movement. Their concerns extend beyond screen counts and admission figures to fundamental questions about creative freedom, distribution equity, and the kind of stories Indonesian cinema should tell as it claims its place on the global stage.</p>\n<p>\n\tWith 44 influential APROFI members — including Mira Lesmana, Harmayn, Ifa Isfansyah, Dian Sastrowardoyo, Bhara and Nazir — leading this creative evolution, Indonesian cinema’s next chapter promises to be as much about artistic ambition as market dominance.</p>\n<div><p>\n\tThe revolution in Indonesian cinema, it turns out, is being written not just in box office receipts, but in the creative choices, policy battles and collaborative innovations of the producers who understand that sustainable success requires more than just beating Hollywood at its own game — it requires defining what Indonesian storytelling means to the world.</p></div>\n</div>"

    "body": "<div><p>\n\t<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/youtube-tv/\">YouTube TV</a> has grappled with carriage-contract showdowns in recent weeks with Fox Corp. and TelevisaUnivison. Next up: <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/nbcuniversal/\">NBCUniversal</a>.</p>\n<p>\n\tNBCU on Thursday evening started telling YouTube TV subscribers that its networks may be pulled off the service because the two companies cannot reach an accord on terms of a new distribution contract. <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/2021/digital/news/nbcu-youtube-tv-reach-deal-1235079414/\">NBCU and YouTube last negotiated a new deal in 2021</a>, and had to agree to a short extension when talks went down to the wire. The companies’ current agreement expires on Tuesday, September 30 — the same day <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/2025/streaming/news/televisaunivision-youtube-tv-may-pull-channels-1236513137/\">a separate pact between YouTube TV and TelevisaUnivision also expires</a>.\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\tIn years past, such arguments were largely held between more traditional companies, with big content outlets like Disney, Paramount and their rivals scrapping with cable and satellite distributors ranging from Altice to Charter Communications. In 2025, however, YouTube TV has become a seismic force because it is not hemmed in to specific regions of the U.S., unlike traditional cable carriers, and its technology is not falling out of favor in the streaming era. Many traditional cable and satellite companies are wrestling with subscriber declines as more consumers migrate to broadband streaming.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tYouTube TV had 9.4 million subscribers as of April, and its service has been boosted in recent years not only by its ease of use — no physical installation is required — but also by its acquisition of rights to the NFL Sunday Ticket package in 2023. NBCU, meanwhile, operates not only the NBC and Telemundo broadcast networks, but cable outlets including MSNBC, Bravo, CNBC and USA. The company is slated to spin off the bulk of its cable holdings <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/2024/tv/news/comcast-cable-spin-buyer-seller-acquisition-deals-1236223992/\">into a new entity called Versant around the end of 2025.</a>\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\tIn recent discussions with NBC, YouTube TV, part of Google parent Alphabet, has sought terms that the broadcaster felt were markedly better than those already negotiated with other carriers, according to a person familiar with the matter.</p>\n<p>\n\tYouTube TV could find itself navigating the loss of the nation’s two biggest Spanish-language programmers, since NBCU owns Telemundo. TelevisaUnivision has already started running promotions and ads telling consumers that YouTube TV plans to pull the large Univision broadcast network from its basic tier and offer it instead as an add-on option. YouTube TV has suggested Univision’s “performance” on YouTube TV doesn’t warrant the terms it seeks and said that it can no longer carry Univision unless the two sides reach a “fair deal.”</p>\n<p>\n\tYouTube TV has also tussled with Fox Corp. in August, with Fox starting to warn subscribers that the Fox broadcasting network, Fox stations, Fox Sports 1 and Fox News Channel, among other properties, might be blacked out. <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/2025/tv/news/youtube-tv-fox-corp-deal-extension-fox-news-blackout-1236498996/\">The two sides came to terms.</a></p>\n<p>\n\tSuch disputes have been a feature of the pay-TV business for decades, and occasionally erupt into the public sphere. In recent years, the companies have bickered about the rise of streaming services, in which the media companies are investing billions of dollars and which lure away cable and satellite customers. In some showdowns, the solution has been found in the pay-TV carrier <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/2025/tv/news/disney-charter-spectrum-deal-hulu-eight-cable-networks-1236441639/\">offering some of the new streaming services as part of their programming package</a>.</p>\n</div>"

Leading Nintendo of America has been the honor of a lifetime, and I am proud of what our team has accomplished in both business results and the experiences we’ve created for consumers.”</p>\n<p>\n\tHe continued: “Now, it’s time for the next generation of leadership and Devon’s track record speaks for itself. She is an exceptional leader, and her promotion is a testament to her strong performance and strategic contributions to the company’s growth. I have full confidence that she will guide the company to even greater heights.”</p>\n<p>\n\tBowser’s boss, Nintendo president Shuntaro Furukawa, said in a separate statement: “During his tenure, Doug made numerous contributions to bring smiles to the faces of people connected to Nintendo. I would like to express my gratitude for his strong efforts. Devon, who will become the next president, has also made many contributions to Nintendo over the years. I am confident that, like Doug, Devon will continue to support Nintendo’s important mission of creating smiles.”\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\t“I am humbled and excited to take on this new role,” Pritchard said. “Doug has been a fantastic mentor, and I look forward to building on the incredible foundation he has helped establish. With characters and worlds that offer something for everyone, my focus will be continuing to build on Nintendo’s legacy of surprising and delighting our longtime fans, while at the same time welcoming new players into the Nintendo family.”</p>\n</div>"

He was formerly an assistant attorney general overseeing the U.S. Department of Justice’s Antitrust Division during President Trump’s first term.</p>\n<p>\n\tDelrahim starts in the new role Oct. 6, 2025, overseeing all legal, regulatory, compliance and public policy matters for the company, including oversight of Paramount’s government relations team. Stephanie Kyoko McKinnon, the company’s general counsel and acting chief legal officer, will continue as general counsel and report to Delrahim.\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\tDelrahim joins Paramount from law firm Latham & Watkins, where he advised clients on high-profile transactions, regulatory and government compliance, and complex litigation. He and the firm provided legal counsel to Skydance Media throughout the M&A process that led to the successful acquisition of Paramount Global; <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/2025/tv/news/paramount-skydance-deal-closes-1236477281/\">the $8 billion deal closed Aug. 7</a>.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tDavid Ellison, chairman and CEO of Paramount Skydance, said in a statement: “We’re thrilled to welcome Makan to the Paramount leadership team. His longstanding collaboration with the Skydance team gives him a unique perspective and provides a strong foundation for our work together as we pursue our vision for the future of Paramount. Makan brings a strategic mindset and a strong track record of navigating complex, cross-sector challenges — qualities that will be instrumental as we shape the next chapter of Paramount and deliver sustained value to our investors, partners, and audiences.”\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\tDelrahim commented, “I’m honored to join Paramount at such a dynamic and transformative time for the media industry. This is a sector where business, technology, and culture converge in increasingly complex ways, creating both challenges and extraordinary opportunities. Throughout my career, I’ve worked at the intersection of law, policy, and innovation, and I look forward to contributing that experience as part of Paramount’s world-class leadership team. I’m excited to support the company as it continues to lead, evolve, and ultimately help shape the future of entertainment.”</p>\n<p>\n\tParamount Skydance said Delrahim is “a recognized expert in antitrust and intellectual property law,” giving lectures on the topics at universities and institutions across the world.</p>\n<p>\n\tAt Latham & Watkins, Delrahim’s clients have included private equity firms Apollo, Hellman & Friedman, KKR and Silver Lake, as well as Caesars Entertainment, Cox Media Group, Eldridge Industries, Endeavor/WME, FanDuel, LIV Golf, Oak View Group, Omnicom, Searchlight Capital, UFC and World Poker Tour.</p>\n<p>\n\tPrior to Latham & Watkins, Delrahim from 2017-21 served as the 35th U.S. assistant attorney general for the DOJ’s Antitrust Division. Prior to that, he held senior posts at the DOJ, on Capitol Hill, at the White House and the Office of the United States Trade Representative, including as deputy assistant attorney general for the DOJ’s Antitrust Division, commissioner on the Antitrust Modernization Commission, and chief counsel and chief of staff of the U.S. Senate Judiciary Committee. </p>\n<p>\n\tBorn in Tehran, Iran, Delrahim holds a master’s degree in biotechnology from Johns Hopkins University, a law degree from George Washington University Law School and a bachelor’s degree from the UCLA. He recently completed certificate programs in both machine learning and blockchain from MIT’s Sloan Graduate School of Management and completed the certificate program in producing at the UCLA School of Theater, Film and Television.</p>\n</div>"

    "body": "<div><p>\n\tThis Oscar season, love is in the air, and so are submission deadlines.</p>\n<p>\n\tThe decision of whether, or how, a movie or performer should campaign for awards consideration is akin to whether a politician should run for president. The stakes are high, the costs are significant, and the ripple effects are long-lasting. Just as a potential candidate must weigh experience, polling data and public appetite before announcing a White House run, studios and strategists face equally consequential questions: where to submit films, how to position talent and when to risk resources on an uncertain path. The ultimate goal is to snag a seat inside the Dolby Theatre as an Oscar nominee — and, ideally, a winner.\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\tWhat could emerge from this year’s campaign strategies could reveal a fundamental shift in how Hollywood approaches awards season. \n</p>\n<p>\n\tFor small independent films, the calculus is a gamble. Submissions to the Academy Screening Room, a crucial platform for voters to see the movies, cost between $8,000 and $20,000. The SAG Awards charge $200 for individual categories and $2,000 for ensemble casts. These are not symbolic investments; rather they represent months of careful budgeting, strategic planning and sometimes hard choices between survival and visibility.</p>\n<div>\n<figure>\n<p><img srcset=\"https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/a-little-prayer.png 1468w, https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/a-little-prayer.png?resize=150,84 150w, https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/a-little-prayer.png?resize=300,169 300w, https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/a-little-prayer.png?resize=125,70 125w, https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/a-little-prayer.png?resize=1000,563 1000w, https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/a-little-prayer.png?resize=910,511 910w, https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/a-little-prayer.png?resize=681,383 681w, https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/a-little-prayer.png?resize=450,253 450w, https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/a-little-prayer.png?resize=250,140 250w\" src=\"https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/a-little-prayer.png?w=1024\" alt=\"\" />\n\t</p>\n<figcaption>\n\t</figcaption>\n</figure>\n</div>\n<p>\n\tAs an example, look at the film “A Little Prayer,” written and directed by Angus MacLachlan, starring David Strathairn, Jane Levy and Celia Weston. Following its 2023 Sundance premiere, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/2025/film/news/a-little-prayer-david-strathairn-angus-maclachlan-1236510516/\">the indie drama only resurfaced after Hollywood’s dual strikes</a>, which delayed its acquisition by Sony Pictures Classics. The rights reverted to MacLachlan, who found a home with Music Box Films. Now, MacLachlan, who lives in North Carolina, is pounding the pavement with a grassroots campaign to garner industry attention. Music Box Films will submit the film for consideration at the Independent Spirit and Gotham Awards, which recognize independent projects. In addition, the film will be on the ballot for the Writers Guild Awards (MacLachlan is a member) and the SAG Awards, where Strathairn will be considered for lead, while Jane Levy and Weston will vie for supporting actress. As of Sept. 19, the film is now on the Academy Screening Room for members to watch and consider.\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\tThe strategic maneuvering becomes most evident in the comedy versus drama debate surrounding several high-profile titles for this season’s Golden Globes, with the submission deadline looming on Oct. 31. </p>\n<p>\n\tA critical early barometer, studios must decide whether to submit in comedy or drama categories — a choice that can be as defining as declaring a political party affiliation. Do you want to be taken more seriously and submit as “drama” or do you want to play up the lighter moments of your movie and vie for “comedy”?</p>\n<p>\n\tWarner Bros. faces a pivotal decision with Zach Cregger’s “Weapons,” the summer box office breakout that grossed $264 million globally. Industry sources say the studio is weighing whether to position the film in the Globes’ comedy/musical categories, where competition may be lighter, or in the drama categories that traditionally carry more Oscar weight. The film’s lead actors, Josh Brolin and Julia Garner, both appear headed for lead acting consideration, but it’s Amy Madigan (eyeing a supporting actress run) that many believe could land a nomination, 30 years after her sole Oscar bid for “Twice in a Lifetime” (1985). Notably, the supporting acting categories at the Globes do not separate between comedy and drama, so the designation would neither help nor hurt her chances.</p>\n<p>\n\tSimilarly, WB must contemplate comedy/musical placement for Paul Thomas Anderson’s epic “One Battle After Another,” opening Friday. The studio faces a more complex challenge with its female ensemble. Chase Infiniti’s breakout performance has generated significant word-of-mouth but positioning her in lead leaves more room for co-stars Teyana Taylor and Regina Hall in supporting roles, and less of a chance of a classic vote-splitting dilemma that has derailed campaigns in the past. No final decisions have been made.</p>\n<p>\n\tThe international feature landscape presents another complication with multiple non-English language titles competing, particularly for distributor Neon. The reigning best picture-winning studio is sitting on a slate of foreign-language titles that could compete across categories. The list includes the Palme d’Or winner “It Was Just an Accident” (all actors will submit in supporting categories), the Brazilian drama “The Secret Agent,” the Spanish-language “Sirāt,” the TIFF international people’s choice winner “<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/no-other-choice/\">No Other Choice</a>,” and its runner-up “Sentimental Value” — all strong contenders for international feature.\n\t</p>\n<div>\n<figure>\n<p><img srcset=\"https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/102842-EOJJEOL_SUGA_EOPDA__NO_OTHER_CHOICE__-_Actor_Lee_Byung-hun-1-e1756397789864.jpg 999w, https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/102842-EOJJEOL_SUGA_EOPDA__NO_OTHER_CHOICE__-_Actor_Lee_Byung-hun-1-e1756397789864.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/102842-EOJJEOL_SUGA_EOPDA__NO_OTHER_CHOICE__-_Actor_Lee_Byung-hun-1-e1756397789864.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/102842-EOJJEOL_SUGA_EOPDA__NO_OTHER_CHOICE__-_Actor_Lee_Byung-hun-1-e1756397789864.jpg?resize=910,607 910w, https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/102842-EOJJEOL_SUGA_EOPDA__NO_OTHER_CHOICE__-_Actor_Lee_Byung-hun-1-e1756397789864.jpg?resize=681,454 681w, https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/102842-EOJJEOL_SUGA_EOPDA__NO_OTHER_CHOICE__-_Actor_Lee_Byung-hun-1-e1756397789864.jpg?resize=450,300 450w, https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/102842-EOJJEOL_SUGA_EOPDA__NO_OTHER_CHOICE__-_Actor_Lee_Byung-hun-1-e1756397789864.jpg?resize=250,167 250w\" src=\"https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/102842-EOJJEOL_SUGA_EOPDA__NO_OTHER_CHOICE__-_Actor_Lee_Byung-hun-1-e1756397789864.jpg?w=999\" alt=\"\" />\n\t</p>\n<figcaption>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCourtesy of CJ ENM, Venice Film Festival.\n\t</figcaption>\n</figure>\n</div>\n<p>\n\tNotably, <em>Variety </em>has confirmed Neon will also take the unconventional step of submitting Park Chan-wook’s “No Other Choice” in the comedy categories, in addition to seeking international feature recognition. That move could open new avenues for lead actor Lee Byung-hun, a TIFF honoree. Coming one year after the musical “Emilia Pérez” became the first non-English language film to win in the comedy/musical category, the strategy could continue the trend. </p>\n<p>\n\tStreaming giant <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/netflix/\">Netflix</a> faces its own set of decisions with several high-profile titles requiring careful positioning. Although not yet to be confirmed, Noah Baumbach’s “Jay Kelly” appears destined for a comedy/musical run, which could make way for George Clooney in the lead actor race. More intriguing is the potential double-header approach for Rian Johnson’s “Wake Up Dead Man,” where Netflix could position both Josh O’Connor and Daniel Craig in lead actor comedy (the former could be a dark horse bid in supporting actor). The move would represent a significant vote of confidence in a category where Netflix has previously succeeded with nominees like Glen Powell (“Hit Man”) and winners like Andrew Garfield (“Tick, Tick… Boom!”).</p>\n<p>\n\tThe Golden Globes’ relatively new cinematic and box office achievement category — which purports to reward films with commercial success and cinematic merit — continues to draw attention and speculation, with its first two winners “Barbie” (2023) and “Wicked” (2024). To qualify, films must gross at least $150 million worldwide with $100 million domestic or achieve “commensurate digital streaming viewership recognized by trusted industry sources.”</p>\n<p>\n\tThis year’s field offers interesting selections. With Warner Bros.’ “A Minecraft Movie” at $423.9 million worldwide, Disney’s “Lilo & Stitch” remake at $423.7 million and DC Studios’ “Superman” at $354.1 million domestic, there’s plenty of popular titles to get people to tune in. Still to come are potential juggernauts such as “Wicked: For Good,” which could defend its crown, and James Cameron’s “Avatar: Fire and Ash,” which could enter contention if voters see it in time. With the submission deadline set for Oct. 31, 2025, studios have weeks to finalize positioning strategies. Nomination ballots must reach voters by Nov. 25, with screening materials uploaded by Dec. 3.\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\tBut let’s be real. Acting categories are where the questions lie, and the ones surrounding the “love stories” are pointing to some interesting trends.</p>\n<p>\n\tThe genre stretches far beyond the familiar “boy meets girl, boy loses girl, boy gets girl back” formula that has dominated cinema for more than a century. Several contenders this year lean into romance as a strategic marketing and campaign hook. Yet, in Oscar history, there are few cases where male-and-female-centered love stories saw one actor positioned in lead and the other in supporting. For this analysis, the focus is strictly on films anchored by a central male-female romance, excluding titles shaped around “love triangles.” From a campaign strategy perspective, it’s easier to justify the category splits of Heath Ledger and Jake Gyllenhaal in “Brokeback Mountain” (2005) or Cate Blanchett and Rooney Mara in “Carol” (2015), even as detractors labeled those choices “category fraud.”</p>\n<p>\n\tChloe Zhao’s “Hamnet,” which follows Agnes and William Shakespeare as they grieve the death of their son, is marketed an “untold love story,” as seen in the trailer (Paul Mescal’s campaign in lead or supporting is still undecided). Benny Safdie’s “The Smashing Machine,” with Dwayne Johnson and Emily Blunt, explores intimacy amid addiction. Bradley Cooper’s “Is This Thing On?” looks at divorce through Will Arnett and Laura Dern’s characters, while Derek Cianfrance’s “Roofman” has Channing Tatum finding connection with Kirsten Dunst while committing a crime spree.</p>\n<p>\n\tBeyond genre, category placement decisions remain thorny, particularly when two romantic leads must decide whether to split the lead and supporting roles. History shows the choices can shape races, and even seasons.</p>\n<p>\n\tFocus Features’ “Song Sung Blue,” directed by Craig Brewer, is likely to present such a case with <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/kate-hudson/\">Kate Hudson</a>‘s performance. Industry buzz suggests she could be a significant awards season factor, 25 years after her sole Oscar nom for “Almost Famous” (2000). The category in which she ultimately lands could tilt the lead or supporting race. Similar strategic choices in recent years — Michelle Williams in “The Fabelmans” (2022) and Lily Gladstone in “Killers of the Flower Moon” (2023) — resulted in noms but not wins for the acclaimed performances. Not every strategic position translates to victory, but it can fundamentally alter how performances are perceived and remembered.\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\tOscar history offers a few examples of how category decisions have affected previous seasons. Depending on how you categorize the respective films, Alicia Vikander went supporting in “The Danish Girl” (2015) while co-star Eddie Redmayne ran lead; Jim Broadbent won supporting for “Iris” (2001) opposite Judi Dench in lead with only eight minutes of screen time difference between them. By contrast, Reese Witherspoon ran lead for “Walk the Line” (2005) and won. According to Matthew Stewart of Screen Time Central, Witherspoon has 46 minutes on screen compared to her co-star Joaquin Phoenix’s 99 minutes, in the 136-minute biopic of Johnny and June Cash.</p>\n<div>\n<figure>\n<p><img srcset=\"https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/4245_FP_00839_R.jpg 1296w, https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/4245_FP_00839_R.jpg?resize=150,84 150w, https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/4245_FP_00839_R.jpg?resize=300,169 300w, https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/4245_FP_00839_R.jpg?resize=125,70 125w, https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/4245_FP_00839_R.jpg?resize=1000,563 1000w, https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/4245_FP_00839_R.jpg?resize=910,511 910w, https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/4245_FP_00839_R.jpg?resize=681,383 681w, https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/4245_FP_00839_R.jpg?resize=450,253 450w, https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/4245_FP_00839_R.jpg?resize=250,140 250w\" src=\"https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/4245_FP_00839_R.jpg?w=1024\" alt=\"\" />\n\t</p>\n<figcaption>\n\t</figcaption>\n</figure>\n</div>\n<p>\n\tOther love stories have blurred the lines, especially when it comes to how it’s initially marketed, versus how viewers ultimately view the film. Jennifer Connelly in “A Beautiful Mind” (2001) and Bérénice Bejo in “The Artist” (2011) both campaigned and were nominated in supporting actress, though their films were ultimately framed as a biopic and a classic Hollywood tale about their leading men Russell Crowe and Jean Dujardin. These decisions often came down to screen time mathematics.</p>\n<p>\n\tBy historical standards and current industry tealeaves, signs point to Hudson going for the lead statuette for “Song Sung Blue,” alongside her co-star Hugh Jackman. However, could a dual-category strategy be in the ether? Much like Catherine Zeta-Jones in “Chicago” (2002) or Maria Bakalova in “Borat Subsequent Moviefilm” (2020) — that could offer flexibility across voting bodies where Hudson competes lead at Globes, and goes supporting elsewhere. That approach didn’t affect Zeta-Jones, who ended up taking home the Oscar.</p>\n<p>\n\tSpeaking of “Chicago,” its director Bill Condon is in the mix with another musical: a remake of “Kiss of the Spider Woman.” As <em>Variety </em>exclusively revealed, its love interests are dividing and conquering in the awards race — Tonatiuh is going for lead and Diego Luna is in supporting, which differs from the 1985 version where Raul Julia and William Hurt (who won) both campaigned in lead.</p>\n<p>\n\tAs awards season progresses, the success or failure of these strategic gambles will likely influence how future romantic dramas approach their campaigns, potentially reshaping decades of precedent in favor of more aggressive positioning strategies.\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\tThe first Golden Globes predictions are below.

While appearing on Theo Von’s <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?si=lWu6HoXs5AU0QEtx&v=EmxcNhJSvzM&feature=youtu.be\" target=\"_blank\">“This Past Weekend” podcast</a> (via <a href=\"https://people.com/pete-davidson-defends-pedro-pascal-online-critics-11816709\" target=\"_blank\">People</a>), the “SNL” alum commented on how social media “can’t wait” to turn against entertainment figures they’ve previously loved.</p>\n<p>\n\t“Fucking two years ago he’s a hardworking, great actor,” Davidson said of Pascal’s reputation. “Everyone was like, ‘He’s worked so hard and has been a struggling actor.’ Fucking blows up so fucking hard. Everyone’s like, ‘Daddy, daddy! Yeah, daddy, daddy.’ Then a year later, he’s in everything now because he’s hot and big and everyone’s like, ‘Go the fuck away, dude.'”\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\t“You got to give someone time to adjust to that new level of fame,” Davidson continued. “He’s been banging at it for 30 years and now he’s learning how to go get a cup of coffee or like deal with someone that taps you on the shoulder while you have your earbuds in and freaks you out. You got to give that guy a fucking second to, like, adjust.”\n</p>\n<p>\n\t“It’s like we build everybody up. It’s, like, so fast to turn [on the celebrity],” Davidson concluded as Von agreed, adding: “The turn is crazy.”</p>\n<p>\n\tDavidson said Pascal is far from alone and social media is “going to do it with Walton Goggins next. … It’s, like, within months.”</p>\n<p>\n\tPascal has hit new career peaks as the leading man of several major Hollywood franchises, from “Star Wars” (his role on “The Mandalorian” will now transfer to the big screen when “The Mandalorian and Grogu” hits theaters in May 2026) to Marvel (“Fantastic Four” opened this summer and he’ll be back as Reed Richards in next year’s “Avengers: Doomsday”) and “The Last of Us.” As part of a <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/story/pedro-pascal-cover-story?srsltid=AfmBOooPhRE3hq2zRHxQGDXZQ1KmCauUj_bgzWnAyC_SdfNeLejEs0KF\">Vanity Fair cover story</a> earlier this year, Pascal revealed it was being cast in the Marvel Cinematic Universe that got him the most strife from social media users.\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\t“I’m more aware of disgruntlement around my casting than anything I’ve ever done,” Pascal said about playing Reed Richards/Mr. Fantastic, adding that the regular complaints he heard were as follows: “He’s too old.

    "body": "<div><p>\n\t<strong>SPOILER ALERT: </strong><em>This story contains spoilers from “Leap,” the final episode of “<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/wayward/\">Wayward</a>,” now streaming on <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/netflix/\">Netflix</a>.</em></p>\n<p>\n\t“Wayward,” Netflix’s new mystery series about a nefarious school for troubled teens in Tall Pines, a town filled with shady citizens and dark secrets, has finally premiered. Fans who binge the whole series will definitely be searching for answers after the eighth and final episode ends. <em>Variety</em> discussed the fates of all of the key characters — including new-to-town cop Alex Dempsey (<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/mae-martin/\">Mae Martin</a>), school leader Evelyn (Toni Collette), Alex’s pregnant wife Laura (Sarah Gadon) and more — and burning questions with the series’ two showrunners, Martin (who also created “Wayward”) and Ryan Scott.\n\t</p>\n\t<h5>\n\t\tMae, you’ve been open about your youth and how the series reflects a close friendship you once had. Was making the show therapeutic for you?\t</h5>\n<p>\n\t<strong>Mae</strong> <strong>Martin: </strong>I always feel like making things is not a substitute for therapy. I learned that a long time ago. But it felt like redressing some injustice in a way, to be able to give a voice to that experience. Those themes of adults processing their adolescence come up in a lot of my work, so it was really cool to dive directly into that time period, rather than writing around it.\n</p>\n\t<h5>\n\t\tBy the end of the season, Laura has taken Evelyn’s spot in the community. Did you always envision that power shift taking place, even in the earliest drafts?\t</h5>\n<p>\n\t<strong>Martin:</strong> We always knew the basic arcs of where we wanted the characters to end up. In sending the scripts to Sarah Gadon, I sent a note saying, “I know Laura, in the first two episodes, is kind of a fantasy, and she’s a bit of a damsel in distress in Episode 1.” I wanted to reassure her that she was going to have this ascension to power by the end.\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\tI think Laura’s my favorite character. She’s pretty interesting and compelling and has a real mid-season shift. As Laura realizes what’s happened to her and that she has had this abuse enacted on her and been drugged and all of these things, it was important to us that she didn’t fall apart or say, “Well, what do we do?” She has a solution, and it’s rising to power and taking Evelyn down. I think that’s satisfying.</p>\n<p>\n\t<strong>Ryan</strong> <strong>Scott</strong>: There’s another component that we were also really excited about in there, which is that all these ideas and belief systems that people create, they don’t die with one person. There’s always another person who comes along that inherits them and adds onto them, and they tumble, whether it be Brigham Young or David Miscavige. These ideas don’t go away. They live in people’s heads, and someone else takes them on, and they become the child of that belief system. So, seeing how families recreate themselves — even within a thing that is trying to get rid of families and the trauma that families can cause, they just recreate it in a different way. And that’s what Laura is; we are recreating these cycles. We can’t escape them in some way.</p>\n<div>\n<figure>\n<p><img srcset=\"https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/TCDWAYW_ZX008.jpg 3000w, https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/TCDWAYW_ZX008.jpg?resize=150,75 150w, https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/TCDWAYW_ZX008.jpg?resize=300,150 300w\" src=\"https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/TCDWAYW_ZX008.jpg?w=1024\" alt=\"\" />\n\t</p>\n<figcaption>\n\t\t\t\t\t<span>Sydney Topliffe and John Daniel</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t©Netflix/Courtesy Everett Collection\n\t</figcaption>\n</figure>\n</div>\n\t<h5>\n\t\tOne of the most interesting visuals was the crosscutting between Laura’s birth and Evelyn’s drug trip. It felt like they were tied together physically. Do you think there is some sort of mystical, physical connection there? Or were you hoping to just show parallels through editing and camerawork?\t</h5>\n<p>\n\t<strong>Scott:</strong> I think both. We discovered that a little bit in editing, how much we could throttle it up. And then some of it was we knew that we were playing with cycles, and we knew that Evelyn’s death was Laura’s birth. The thematic connections between those two were really powerful, the connection between life and death. It just seemed like to twin those stories and to twin the decline and the ascension seemed too easy not to play a power chord.</p>\n<p>\n\t<strong>Martin:</strong> It’s a transition for both of them, and such a major transition point in looking at intergenerational trauma and seeing this next generation being born. Even the echo of “In the Pines,” of Laura using that song. When we shot it, just the imagery, it was so unsettling. Having all the naked people in the room and the baby, a real baby — I think it turned out really well.\n\t</p>\n\t<h5>\n\t\tThe show begins and ends with Pink Floyd’s “Time.” Why was that song so central to the story?\t</h5>\n<p>\n\t<strong>Martin:</strong> It was in the original pilot script, because I’m a deep Floyd fan. Right around puberty, I went to see “Dark Side of Oz,” where they show “The Wizard of Oz” with “Dark Side of the Moon.” It was so beautiful, and the whole album is really a hero’s journey. It’s a concept album that takes you from the birth to the death of a person. Pink Floyd is the soundtrack to my teens, and also for Abbie [Sydney Topliffe] and Leile [Alyvia Alyn Lind], who really mythologized and are obsessed with ’60s culture and the culture of their parents, and feel so let down by their parents’ generation, who abandoned those ideals. I think that was important to show that they’re out of place in the early 2000s, these hippie kids, and that’s what I was like.</p>\n<p>\n\tI wrote a letter to Roger Waters and a letter to David Gilmour, and I can’t believe we got it. It’s really cool that it bookends the series, and also halfway through, we have Duck [Joshua Close] singing and playing it on the guitar. The lyrics are just about that deadening of spirit as you transition into adulthood, that hanging on in quiet desperation is the English way. It’s so good.</p>\n\t<h5>\n\t\tThe skin-to-skin scene at the end is so scary and strange. How did it gestate in your mind?\t</h5>\n<p>\n\t<strong>Scott: </strong>I’m not sure. I think it came for me because I’ve got two kids, and one of them was born in the middle of the night after a very long labor. It was a strenuous thing. I remember that skin-to-skin moment and how bizarre and strange and connecting and visceral and messy it was. It’s a thing that people don’t see a lot, and it’s very intimate when that happens and it’s your first moment of connecting. It’s the beginning of the story of your life with this person and of that connection. I thought it would be particularly interesting in this show, given Mae’s character. All of a sudden, you’re like, “How does everyone connect to this in this world where this is the first kid? What if they all started taking off their clothes?” That was our moment at the end of “Rosemary’s Baby” where there’s a little hand that comes out. It seemed like a really beautiful but eerie, progressive, messy way of telling a story of how perverted it would be if that were the case.\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\t<strong>Martin: </strong>For Alex, who’s so yearning for this heteronormative nuclear family and to be the guy for this baby — to have that moment ripped away from him and, in that moment, have it dawn on Alex that this is not going to be what he thought it was. I think it’s such a jarring image and so deeply icky that he instantly knows he’s made a huge mistake. He’s so desperate for all those rites of passage of fatherhood and all the moments, but he doesn’t get to cut the umbilical cord and things like that. So tragic.</p>\n<div>\n<figure>\n<p><img srcset=\"https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/TCDWAYW_ZX033.jpg 3000w, https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/TCDWAYW_ZX033.jpg?resize=150,75 150w, https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/TCDWAYW_ZX033.jpg?resize=300,150 300w\" src=\"https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/TCDWAYW_ZX033.jpg?w=1024\" alt=\"\" />\n\t</p>\n<figcaption>\n\t\t\t\t\t<span>Toni Collette and Joshua Close</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t©Netflix/Courtesy Everett Collection\n\t</figcaption>\n</figure>\n</div>\n\t<h5>\n\t\tWould you want to do a second season or do you want to leave the ending how it is?\t</h5>\n<p>\n\t<strong>Martin:</strong> I’ve been doing so much press and I’m so interested in people’s reactions to the ending. It seems like people have an appetite for more, but also it’s so funny that people are like, “Well, it’s really ambiguous with Alex.” I’m like, “I don’t know if it’s ambiguous — maybe he just didn’t make the choice that <em>you</em> wanted him to make.” Some of the characters make disappointing and very human choices. I think, hopefully, it works as a mini-series, but then it’s also obviously fun to imagine what would happen. But I feel like the FBI would be in there pretty fast. There are so many dead people now.</p>\n<p>\n\t<strong>Scott: </strong>There’s a lot of dead people. There are a lot of things at the bottom of that pond to find. I’m so excited to see what people think, but I mean, there’s a part of this that’s a tragedy and it does feel a little unresolved in a sense, but mostly also resolved. I think Dempsey makes a very clear decision. It’s a decision that a lot of us make that comes with adulthood, which is that we’re not always willing to risk blowing up our little lives to do what’s right. And sometimes that’s what adulthood feels like. I don’t want that to be the case, but it sometimes is. But there are different resolutions for other characters outside of Dempsey that paint the image of the whole human experience, of how we are all different people. Some people are like Abbie and can really hold on to themselves and be empowered by this and make it. Some people just don’t. That’s like having the panoply of responses and not just one path for dealing with your trauma. That is really important: There’s not just one right way to do everything.</p>\n\t<h5>\n\t\tDo we meet Evelyn’s child during the series, and we might just not know who it is?\t</h5>\n<p>\n\t<strong>Martin:</strong> I think we leave it up to interpretation.\n\t</p>\n\t<h5>\n\t\tDo you think Dwayne (Brandon Jay McLaren) ever liked Alex, or was it all just a front?\t</h5>\n<p>\n\t<strong>Martin: </strong>All a front. Maybe for a second he would entertain that this could be a new friendship, but I think he was a pretty territorial guy and it was always a front.</p>\n\t<h5>\n\t\tDo you think that Alex 100% killed Dwayne or is there a chance he’s alive?\t</h5>\n<p>\n\t<strong>Scott: </strong>He did. I mean, he got smashed in the head with a rock! That guy’s dead.</p>\n<div>\n<figure>\n<p><img srcset=\"https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/TCDWAYW_ZX022.jpg 3000w, https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/TCDWAYW_ZX022.jpg?resize=150,75 150w, https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/TCDWAYW_ZX022.jpg?resize=300,150 300w\" src=\"https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/TCDWAYW_ZX022.jpg?w=1024\" alt=\"\" />\n\t</p>\n<figcaption>\n\t\t\t\t\t<span>Sarah Gadon and Mae Martin</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t©Netflix/Courtesy Everett Collection\n\t</figcaption>\n</figure>\n</div>\n\t<h5>\n\t\tWhy do you think Rabbit (Tattiawna Jones) drugged Evelyn at the end to let Alex escape?\t</h5>\n<p>\n\t<strong>Scott:</strong> Maybe there’s a sense of justice still inside of Rabbit, both for these kids and for herself. Just seeing Evelyn’s abuse of power, she couldn’t take it anymore.</p>\n<p>\n\t<strong>Martin: </strong>I think she really is burned by not being able to take Stacey [Isolde Ardies] under her wing. So the veil is slowly slipping, and her love for Laura. But then, Evelyn’s mask slips so completely in that basement when she slaps Alex and the things that she’s saying to him. I think even though Rabbit’s deeply attached to her abuser, there’s some flickering sense of justice inside.</p>\n<p>\n\t<strong>Scott:</strong> And she cares for Evelyn as she’s dying, immediately pivots into it, which is often how family dynamics work — being the injurer and then the caregiver right afterwards. So it was very much a non-familial family dynamic.</p>\n\t<h5>\n\t\tIs Evelyn definitely dead?\t</h5>\n<p>\n\t<strong>Martin: </strong>I don’t think so. I think she’s a vegetable and, yeah, I’d be curious to see if she could ever come out of it, but she’s definitely a vegetable.</p>\n\t<h5>\n\t\tWhat was your interpretation of Evelyn’s vision with the doors in her mouth? \t</h5>\n<p>\n\t<strong>Martin: </strong>Hopefully, that’s a memorable image that stays with people. It’s all about cycles and generations and looking internally. What she’s expecting to be on the other side of that door is total freedom and relief and euphoria. Of course, she’s just trapped in a sort of purgatorial hell of loneliness when you sever all attachment. </p>\n<p>\n\t<strong>Scott: </strong>It’s definitely reaching within yourself and pulling out your true self and the uncanny experience of self-discovery, which is weird that a person can be hiding inside of yourself. Your true self is inside yourself, hiding somewhere. That’s a weird thing to visualize. Then there’s this weird other, like Mae got really into parables. We really got into the myth. There’s one myth about how a mother is like a crocodile with its mouth open and all of its babies are inside of it and swimming around. They’re both protector and the most dangerous person in your life. So there was this image of mouths and reptiles and frogs and it came up in the brew and cauldron of our room.\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\t<strong>Martin:</strong> There’s also a short story by H.G. Wells called “The Green Door” about a guy who loses track of this magical place that he can access as a child. As he gets older, he can’t find that door again. But it’s all a swampy thing that birthed this.</p>\n\t<h5>\n\t\tIs Abbie going to make it?\t</h5>\n<p>\n\t<strong>Martin: </strong>Yeah, she’s going to be Prime Minister of Canada, I hope.</p>\n<p>\n\t<strong>Scott: </strong>I think when Evelyn says what her future is going to be there, I think she’s kind of right that Abbie’s going to be okay. I think that was a correct read of Abbie in that situation, maybe. Whether it’s right to tell that to a kid or not is different.</p>\n<p>\n\t<em>This interview has been edited and condensed.</em></p>\n<p>\n\tWatch the “Wayward” trailer below.</p>\n<figure><p>\n<iframe width=\"500\" height=\"281\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/2kSNuohhKyc?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\"></iframe>\n</p></figure>\n</div>"
