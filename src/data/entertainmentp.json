    "body": "<div><p>\n\tWith “Bai, Bai,” Murcia-born filmmaker Alba Esquinas turns a formative childhood memory into her debut feature, exploring the subtle but devastating rupture of a first friendship. It’s one of the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/ecam/\">ECAM</a> Incubator titles, a prestigious Madrid Film School initiative that has become a key launchpad for emerging Spanish filmmakers, offering development backing, industry mentorship and access to international markets.</p>\n<p>\n\tThe story follows Ana, 12, who embarks on a long-awaited school trip to Madrid with her best friend Santi. But on the bus ride, Santi chooses to sit with someone else. That empty seat marks the beginning of a painful estrangement, as Ana confronts loneliness for the first time, far from the protection of her parents and her closest companion.\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\tEsquinas traces the project’s origins to an image she encountered in 2021. “I was traveling from Murcia to Almería and saw graffiti on the highway that said ‘BAI, BAI,’ a misspelling of ‘bye, bye,’” she told <em>Variety</em>. “I imagined a girl painting it, knowing her best friend would see it. That way of saying goodbye led me back to my own experiences of losing a friendship.”\n</p>\n<p>\n\tFor Esquinas, the subject is rarely addressed on screen. “In a romantic breakup, you have rituals and guidance to help with grief. But in a friendship, especially as a child, you don’t have those tools. It can feel just as traumatic, but it’s often overlooked,” she said.</p>\n<p>\n\tThe €2 million project is produced by Alejandro González Clemente at Mubox Studio, with financing still to be secured. “It’s always more complicated to finance a debut feature,” González acknowledged. “But we believe one of the strengths of this project is Alba’s sensitivity in telling stories, and the universality of the theme.”\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\tVisually, the director plans to balance realism with expressionism. “I’m looking for a realistic emotional portrait, but one that’s aesthetically expressionist. Ana’s emotions will define the images and sounds — as she accepts the end of her friendship, the settings will also accompany her, like a rite of passage,” Esquinas explained.</p>\n<p>\n\tRejecting nostalgia, she describes “Bai, Bai” as “a more adult coming-of-age.” “There isn’t much room for innocence. Almost from the beginning, there’s a disenchantment with reality that has more to do with an adult perspective,” she said. Among inspirations, she cites Céline Sciamma’s approach to screenwriting and Joanna Hogg’s emotionally precise filmmaking.</p>\n<p>\n\tMubox previously collaborated with Esquinas on her short “Olores” (“Smells”), which premiered at Visions du Réel and won the Grand Prize of <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/spanish-cinema/\">Spanish Cinema</a> at Zinebi. “We loved the way she works and tells stories, so we were excited to see her next script and be part of her step into feature filmmaking,” González said.</p>\n<p>\n\tWhat resonated with the producers was the subtlety of the loss. “It isn’t about a dramatic, heartbreaking event like a death; it’s about two girls drifting apart as their world begins to grow,” González said. “It’s a moment that can feel very traumatic but one we’ve rarely seen portrayed on screen.”</p>\n<p>\n\tCiting the success of debut Spanish features such as Carla Simón’s “Summer 1993” and Estibaliz Urresola’s “20,000 Species of Bees,” Mubox is aiming to position “Bai, Bai” for both the festival circuit and international markets. “Losing a friendship is universal — everyone can relate to it. That gives us confidence in the film’s ability to connect widely,” González said.</p>\n<p>\n\tFor Esquinas, the goal is to balance melancholy with hope. “I want the audience to embrace this disenchantment with hope, despite the shadows Ana must navigate. Accepting that nothing lasts forever is something we can apply to many aspects of our lives. The sooner we accept it, the more hope we have to navigate the losses we suffer,” she said.</p>\n</div>"

    "body": "<div><p>\n\t<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/john-boyega/\">John Boyega</a> isn’t holding back when it comes to his thoughts on how the “<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/star-wars/\">Star Wars</a>” sequel trilogy could have been handled differently.</p>\n<p>\n\tSpeaking at Florida Supercon 2025 in Miami Beach, Boyega — who played former Stormtrooper Finn across “The Force Awakens,” “The Last Jedi” and “The Rise of Skywalker” — offered a candid take on what he would have done if he had been a producer on the films from the beginning. When asked by an audience member during his spotlight panel what changes he would make to remake the sequels, Boyega delivered a blunt assessment of the franchise’s creative choices.\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\t“If I was a producer on ‘Star Wars’ from the beginning, you would have had a whole completely different thing,” Boyega said, <a href=\"https://www.thepopverse.com/movies-star-wars-john-boyega-florida-supercon-2025-finn-han-solo-luke-skywalker-last-jedi\" target=\"_blank\">according to Popverse</a>. “It would be mad. First of all, we’re not getting rid of <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/han-solo/\">Han Solo</a>, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/luke-skywalker/\">Luke Skywalker</a>, all these people. We’re not doing that. The first thing we’re going to do is fulfill their story, fulfill their legacy. We’re going to make a good moment of handing on the baton.”\n</p>\n<p>\n\tBoyega also took aim at the power scaling of new characters in the sequels. “Our new characters will not be OP’d [overpowered] in these movies,” he said. “They won’t just grab stuff and know what to do with it. No. You’ve got to struggle like every other character in this franchise. I’d do that.”</p>\n<p>\n\tBeyond character development, Boyega outlined a different creative approach that would have drawn from the expanded universe of “Star Wars” storytelling. “I’d look to the Old Republic stories and see what we can add to the continuation of that. I would definitely want to see Force Unleashed stories in there,” he said. “I would try to expand the ‘Star Wars’ universe as much as possible while respecting the lore. If we’re expanding the lore, we have to do it within the respective boundaries that stay true.”\n\t</p>\n<div><p>\n\tThe actor was particularly critical of Luke Skywalker’s arc in “The Last Jedi,” where the character appeared as a Force projection during the film’s climax. “But Luke Skywalker wouldn’t be disappearing on a rock. Hell no. Standing there and he’s, like, a projector? I would want to give those characters way more way more.”</p></div>\n</div>"

    "body": "<div><p>\n\t<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/buffalo-8/\">Buffalo 8</a> has secured distribution rights to “<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/shakti/\">Shakti</a>,” the debut narrative feature from Nepali-American filmmaker Nani Sahra Walker, in a seven-year deal covering the U.S., Canada and U.K. markets.</p>\n<p>\n\tThe Kathmandu-set drama follows a determined single mother whose nine-year-old daughter falls mysteriously ill. When medical professionals can’t provide answers, she seeks help from a local shaman, setting both mother and daughter on a journey toward redemption.\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\tWalker, who previously served as executive producer at LA Times Studios, draws parallels between her film and Nepal’s recent political transformation. “Recently in Nepal, young people <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/2025/politics/news/nepal-gen-z-mass-protests-social-media-ban-1236511575/\">dismantled the government </a>and ushered in the country’s first female prime minister who has been fighting for women’s rights for decades. ‘Shakti’ is grounded in that same spirit, carrying both the spirit of resistance and change,” she said.\n</p>\n<p>\n\t“‘Shakti’ confronts fading global attention on sexual violence, caste injustice, and the corruption fueling Nepal’s biggest protests in decades. It’s both a response to Nepal’s urgent call for action and a universal story of justice and resilience,” Walker added. </p>\n<p>\n\tWalker brings notable credits to the project, having overseen award-winning short documentaries at LA Times Studios, including “The Last Repair Shop,” which claimed the Academy Award for Best Documentary Short in 2024. Her 2012 debut documentary “Other Nature,” exploring LGBTQ rights in Nepal, played at BFI Flare, Outfest, Frameline and dozens of international festivals.</p>\n<p>\n\tBehind the camera, acclaimed Japanese cinematographer Keiko Nakahara lensed the project. Nakahara’s decade-plus career spans work on “Mary Kom,” “Tanhaji: The Unsung Warrior” and “The Jane Austen Book Club” across India, Hollywood and Japan.\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\tThe cast includes Laxmi Bardewa (“Bulbul”), Menuka Pradhan (“Saili”), Shristi Shrestha (“The Red Suitcase”) and Polina Oli. Executive producers are Vrushali Satarkar, Snehal Fulzele, Matthew Helderman, Luke Taylor, Grady Craig, Gannon Kenney and Rakesh Mehra, whose credits include “The Warrior” and “Seven Years in Tibet.”</p>\n<p>\n\t“Shakti” will world premiere at the Heartland International Film Festival in Indianapolis before screening in the New American Perspectives lineup at the Hawaii International Film Festival. Additional festival stops include the Tasveer South Asian Film Festival in Seattle and the Female Eye Film Festival in Toronto.</p>\n<div><p>\n\tThe project received backing from ARRI’s International Support Program, a global initiative supporting emerging filmmakers. Production also marked the Nepal debut of the ARRI ALEXA 35 camera system.</p></div>\n</div>"

    "body": "<div><p>\n\tThe 9th <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/pingyao-international-film-festival/\">Pingyao International Film Festival</a> Project Market jurors stressed the importance of balancing creative originality with market feasibility at a press conference on the festival’s opening day. </p>\n<p>\n\tThis year, the festival received 872 submissions, of which the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/2025/film/news/pingyao-film-festival-2025-project-market-selections-1236515244/\">Pingyao Project Promotion (PPP) program presents 16 projects in various stages of development and the Literary Picturized Project (LPP) presents 15 works </a>spanning from short fiction to full-length novels, representing a diverse array of contemporary Chinese literature available for screen adaptation. Awards including the Creativity Prize, Humanitarian Spirit Award and Commercial Potential Prize will be handed out, alongside the Momo Script Award. \n\t</p>\n<p>\n\tDirector Zhang Yang, whose credits include “Shower” and “Paths of the Soul,” highlighted the need for filmmakers to articulate not only their story but also how it will translate into a distinctive cinematic style. “From my perspective, it’s not only the story and characters — those are essential — but also how the director ultimately brings this script to the screen. What is the visual style? Is there a breakthrough or personal pursuit?” Zhang said.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tProducer Ye Ting (“Her Story,” “How Long Will I Love U”) underscored the role of producers in shaping projects for real-world execution. “No matter how strong a script is artistically, if its feasibility and market potential are very limited, then it’s hard to move forward,” Ye said, noting that producers must define the project’s selling points and practical strategies for financing and release.\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\tActor, executive and long-time industry supporter Wu Yanyan, general manager of Dongfang Tianming Film and an adviser to the Wu Tianming Film Fund, observed that many of this year’s selected scripts demonstrated a high level of completeness and commercial awareness. “I was pleasantly surprised. Several projects are close to what the market wants, and the diversity is striking,” she said.</p>\n<p>\n\tPingyao programmer Wu Jueren pointed to the evolution of the selection process: seven preliminary jurors — including distributors, producers and directors — whittled down the field. “There was a huge workload. But we saw a wide range: projects from experienced directors and completely fresh voices. The genres were very diverse,” Wu noted.</p>\n<p>\n\tQuestions of budget feasibility also loomed large. “If a director has only made short films but reports a multimillion budget, then the feasibility is low,” Zhang cautioned. Wu Yanyan added that most projects this year showed realistic financial awareness, with budgets largely under the RMB10 million ($1.4 million) mark.</p>\n<p>\n\tThe jury stressed the importance of originality and timeliness. “What matters most with new directors is new ideas, new thinking,” said Ye. “Originality is the strength of emerging filmmakers, often tied to their life experience and urgent desire to express something of the present moment.”</p>\n<p>\n\tThe Project Market has become a key industry strand at Pingyao, with previous selections including “Journey to the West” and “Lighting Up the Stars” going on to full release. Festival organizers noted that several other past projects are in post-production and set to reach audiences soon.</p>\n<div><p>\n\tThe 9th Pingyao Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon International Film Festival runs Sept. 24–30, in Pingyao, Shanxi, China. Acclaimed filmmaker <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/jia-zhangke/\">Jia Zhangke</a>, a leading figure of the Sixth Generation’ movement of Chinese cinema, established the festival in his home province of Shanxi.</p></div>\n</div>"

We believe the best stories are the ones worth sharing everywhere.”</p>\n<p>\n\tAntti Kairakari (creative producer), Pia Ervasti (CFO/line producer), Aleksi Puranen (head of development) and Petteri Staven (VFX supervisor) will round out the team. </p>\n<p>\n\t“We know the North, we know our craft and we believe the extremes we live with every day – light, dark, isolation, humor – are the perfect foundation for stories that resonate everywhere,” said Kaarlela.  </p>\n</div>"
