He was formerly an assistant attorney general overseeing the U.S. Department of Justice’s Antitrust Division during President Trump’s first term.</p>\n<p>\n\tDelrahim starts in the new role Oct. 6, 2025, overseeing all legal, regulatory, compliance and public policy matters for the company, including oversight of Paramount’s government relations team. Stephanie Kyoko McKinnon, the company’s general counsel and acting chief legal officer, will continue as general counsel and report to Delrahim.\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\tDelrahim joins Paramount from law firm Latham & Watkins, where he advised clients on high-profile transactions, regulatory and government compliance, and complex litigation. He and the firm provided legal counsel to Skydance Media throughout the M&A process that led to the successful acquisition of Paramount Global; <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/2025/tv/news/paramount-skydance-deal-closes-1236477281/\">the $8 billion deal closed Aug. 7</a>.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tDavid Ellison, chairman and CEO of Paramount Skydance, said in a statement: “We’re thrilled to welcome Makan to the Paramount leadership team. His longstanding collaboration with the Skydance team gives him a unique perspective and provides a strong foundation for our work together as we pursue our vision for the future of Paramount. Makan brings a strategic mindset and a strong track record of navigating complex, cross-sector challenges — qualities that will be instrumental as we shape the next chapter of Paramount and deliver sustained value to our investors, partners, and audiences.”\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\tDelrahim commented, “I’m honored to join Paramount at such a dynamic and transformative time for the media industry.

    "description": "President Donald Trump signed an executive order approving the sale of a controlling stake in TikTok's U.S. operations to a group of new American investors, valuing it at $14 billion.",
    "body": "<div><p>\n\t<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/tiktok/\">TikTok</a> is finally about to become legal in the U.S.: President <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/donald-trump/\">Donald Trump</a> signed an executive order Thursday paving the way for TikTok’s U.S. operations to become 80% owned by a group of American investors.</p>\n<p>\n\t“American investors are taking it over,” Trump said about the U.S. version of TikTok in a press briefing in the Oval Office after he signed the executive order. “The young people, they really wanted this to happen.”\n</p>\n<p>\n\tRight now, there aren’t confirmed details about who the new owners are under the proposed pact, aside from Trump reiterating that Oracle and Larry Ellison, tech mogul Michael Dell and Rupert Murdoch are among the investors.\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\tVice President JD Vance, who was in attendance at the event, said the deal values TikTok U.S. at about $14 billion. He said the investors will be announced in due time. Vance said the “fundamental thing” in working out the agreement was to ensure TikTok would remain available to Americans, while putting into place protections for their personal data. “Americans can use TikTok but use it with more confidence than they had in the past,” Vance said, adding that “it won’t be used as a propaganda.”</p>\n<p>\n\tReps for TikTok and ByteDance did not immediately respond to a request for comment.</p>\n<p>\n\t“President Donald J. Trump and @VP Vance SAVE TikTok from a ban while protecting America’s national security by removing TikTok in the U.S. from China’s control,” the <a href=\"https://x.com/WhiteHouse/status/1971322421421670512\" target=\"_blank\">White House posted on X</a>.</p>\n<p>\n\tThe deal still requires the approval of Chinese regulators before it’s official. The new ownership structure of TikTok U.S. would reduce Chinese parent company ByteDance’s ownership in the entity to 19.9%. According to Trump’s executive order, that makes the app a “qualified divestiture” in compliance with the U.S.’s TikTok divest-or-ban law that went into effect in January 2025. The law prohibits distribution in the U.S. of any app that is more than 20% owned by a “foreign adversary.”\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\t<a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2025/09/25/oracle-silver-lake-mgx-tiktok.html\" target=\"_blank\">CNBC reported</a> that Oracle, private-equity firm Silver Lake and Abu Dhabi’s MGX state-owned investment firm will be the primary owners of TikTok U.S. with a combined 45% stake. Oracle, founded by Trump supporter Larry Ellison, already has provided data and computing services for TikTok’s U.S. operations. Current ByteDance investors including venture-capital firms Susquehanna International, KKR and General Atlantic are also part of the ownership group. Trump said in an interview aired Sunday on Fox News that investors in the new TikTok U.S. would likely <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/2025/digital/news/murdochs-fox-corp-tiktok-us-deal-1236526022/\">include Lachlan and Rupert Murdoch,</a> which would be through Fox Corp.</p>\n<p>\n\tTrump reiterated at the signing that Chinese President Xi Jinping has agreed to a deal for TikTok U.S., and China’s top trade negotiator last week said the two countries had agreed in principle on a framework for the transaction. But the final terms of the agreement still need to be OK’d by Chinese regulators.</p>\n<p>\n\tUnder a federal law that went into effect Jan. 19, 2025, it is illegal for U.S. companies to host or distribute TikTok as long as ByteDance owns more than 20% of the app. The bill passed through Congress with overwhelming bipartisan support, and was signed into law by President Biden, over fears TikTok represents a national security threat to the U.S. because of its Chinese ownership — and speculation that the Chinese government could meddle with the app to spy on U.S. citizens or spread misinformation. ByteDance and TikTok had challenged the law on First Amendment grounds but <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/2025/digital/news/supreme-court-tiktok-ban-ruling-shutdown-1236274925/\">the Supreme Court rejected its appeal</a>.</p>\n<p>\n\tLast week, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/2025/digital/news/tikotok-ban-trump-postpones-enforcement-deal-app-1236520948/\">Trump delayed enforcement of the divest-or-ban law (for the fourth time)</a> until Dec. 16 as the parties continue work to finalize the deal.</p>\n<p>\n\tUnder the Trump administration’s proposed deal, ByteDance will license the TikTok content-recommendation algorithm to the U.S. entity, which would operate it separately from the Chinese-controlled version of the technology. The TikTok divest-or-ban law <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.congress.gov/bill/118th-congress/house-bill/7521/text\">expressly prohibits the app in the U.S.</a> from having an “operational relationship” with a foreign adversary, including with respect to the content-recommendation algorithm.</p>\n<p>\n\tThe White House celebrated Trump’s signing of the executive order on TikTok with a post Thursday on the app:</p>\n<figure></figure>\n</div>"

He doesn’t care about the forgotten — anybody but himself and the multibillionaires who stood behind him on Inauguration Day.” However, he adds, “You have to face the fact that a good number of Americans are simply comfortable with his politics of power and dominance.”</p>\n<p>\n\tAs for Trump’s insults against him, he says, “I absolutely couldn’t care less what he thinks about me… He’s the living personification of what the 25th Amendment and impeachment were for. If Congress had any guts, he’d be consigned to the trash heap of history.”\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\tNor does he spare the Democratic party, which has been spectacularly ineffective in the face of Trump and the Republican’s power grabs. “We’re desperately in need of an effective alternative party, or for the Democratic Party to find someone who can speak to the majority of the nation,” he says. “There is a problem with the language that they’re using and the way they’re trying to reach people.”</p>\n<p>\n\tRead the entire interview <a href=\"https://time.com/7319963/bruce-springsteen-songs-albums-deliver-me-from-nowhere/\" target=\"_blank\">here</a>.</p>\n</div>"

    "body": "<div><p>\n\t“<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/stranger-things/\">Stranger Things</a>” auteurs Matt and Ross Duffer spoke for the first time about their blockbuster deal with <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/paramount/\">Paramount</a> on Thursday, at <em>Variety</em>’s Entertainment and Technology Summit in Los Angeles. In August, the Duffers announced that their company Upside Down Pictures is leaving Netflix for an <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/2025/film/news/stranger-things-creators-matt-ross-duffer-paramount-deal-set-netflix-exit-1236493079/\">exclusive, four-year deal with Paramount</a> for movies, television and streaming projects, and as the Duffers explained to <em>Variety</em>‘s Michael Schneider, the decision hinged on their desire to release a feature films in theaters. \n\t</p>\n<p>\n\t“When Matt and I were talking about what we want to do next, it really came down to we wanted to do a movie, specifically an original movie — a big original film,” Ross Duffer said. “And theatrical is so important to us.”\n</p>\n<p>\n\tHe added that they hadn’t sought out a new deal — the brothers are still deep in post-production on the final season of “Stranger Things,” which premieres in November. Instead, Paramount approached them, and the prospect of theatrical distribution “is what really got us excited.”</p>\n<p>\n\t“It’s just something we dreamed about since we were little kids,” Ross Duffer said.</p>\n<p>\n\tWhile they said they specifically will be focusing on making original movies, Matt Duffer said they would be open to looking at existing properties within the Paramount umbrella “that we really respond to.” But the bar appears to be quite high.</p>\n<p>\n\t“The market is so flooded with IP and sometimes it’s like IP that doesn’t mean anything,” Matt Duffer said. “I don’t understand that. How is that bring any value to anything? I like IP that was botched. Someone swung and missed. Then you have an opportunity to do it properly.”\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\tThe Duffers emphasized that they don’t plan on becoming prolific producers of a large stable of shows and films. “We don’t want to become like Bad Robot,” Matt Duffer said, name checking J.J. Abrams’ production company. “Ross and I are incapable of juggling that many things.” Instead, they want to emulate what 21 Laps co-head Shawn Levy did with them when he agreed to produce “Stranger Things” in 2015 even though they had zero experience creating television.</p>\n<p>\n\t“We like identifying really talented people and then just helping them get their vision made and then mostly staying out of the way,” Matt Duffer said.</p>\n<p>\n\tUpside Down Pictures will also develop television projects for Paramount that focus on the “eight-to-10 episode seasons” rather than classic network shows for CBS. “I get fatigued watching 20-episode seasons,” Matt Duffer said. “We didn’t grow up interested in any of that. We only watched movies. That’s the weird thing that we ended up in TV, because we had almost zero interest in television.” </p>\n<p>\n\tInstead, they plan on making event series akin to “Stranger Things.” “If TV shows come out every year, it’s diminishing return,” Matt Duffer said. “I like the buildup.”</p>\n<p>\n\tThe Duffers are staying in business with Netflix with two new series, “The Boroughs” and “Something Very Bad Is Going to Happen,” which are expected to debut in 2026. (“We literally just got the ‘Something Very Bad Is Going to Happen’ release date this morning,” Matt Duffer said, though he declined to say when.) “Stranger Things: Tales From ’85,” an animated series inspired by their love of Saturday morning cartoons, is also imminent. And the Duffers are expected to executive produce a spin-off of “Stranger Things” for Netflix — not as showrunners — but were circumspect about what that could be.</p>\n<p>\n\t“We just want to make sure that if we’re gonna do it, it’s something that we’re very excited about,” Matt Duffer said. “We really are careful about what we bring to Netflix. My thing is, am I gonna be really mad at them if they pass on this?” </p>\n<p>\n\tAs for the final season of “Stranger Things,” the Duffers didn’t want to spoil much about what to expect, though Ross Duffer did say that the season premiere would launch directly into the characters’ hunting for Vecna. “This isn’t going about normal life, and then something supernatural happens to them, which is what we usually do,” he said. \n\t</p>\n<p>\n\tThe final season will be split, with the first four episodes premiering at Thanksgiving, the next three at Christmas, and the finale on Dec. 31 — a split the Duffers said they were able to write to in advance, unlike the split in Season 4 that was necessitated by the pandemic. “Episode 4 and Episode 8 are like movies,” Matt Duffer said. Though he was quick to add, “Every runtime I’ve seen posted online is inaccurate.”</p>\n<p>\n\tWhen discussing their post-production process, Ross Duffer also revealed that the last thing they shot for “Stranger Things” didn’t include anyone from the cast.</p>\n<p>\n\t“We had a close-up of a lunchbox, and we could not find it for the life of us,” he said. </p>\n<p>\n\t“It’s a GI Joe lunchbox, and there’s a blinking red light,” Matt Duffer added. “But there is debate over whether it was actually [shot]. Everyone on the crew thinks we did shoot it and editorial claims we did not.”</p>\n<p>\n\t“So we had to go back and shoot this close-up,” Ross Duffer said. “That was the last shot we ever shot on ‘Stranger Things,’ a lunchbox on the floor.”</p>\n</div>"

    "body": "<div><p>\n\tGoya-winning Spanish filmmaker José Luis Guerin is back in competition at the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/san-sebastian-film-festival-2/\">San Sebastián Film Festival</a> with “<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/good-valley-stories/\">Good Valley Stories</a>” (“Historias del Buen Valle”), almost a quarter of a century after “Work in Progress” played at the Basque fest in 2001. The film takes place over three years in Valbona, a suburban district of Barcelona, as Guerín prods at issues of displacement, identity, urban life, and ecological conflicts in this small neighborhood that serves as a microcosm of the world. \n\t</p>\n<p>\n\tSpeaking with <em>Variety </em>ahead of the world premiere, Guerín says he has had his work featured in some of the largest festivals across the world, but for a film like “Good Valley Stories,” it feels right to have the world premiere in his home country. “Some aspects of it will inevitably be lost in other countries, so I feel San Sebastián is the most appropriate place for a first presentation.”\n</p>\n<p>\n\tHe goes on to recall how the project spawned out of a commission from Barcelona’s Museum of Contemporary Art. “They proposed a small piece about this disadvantaged neighborhood and I gladly accepted it,” he says. “Then I went to this peripheral neighborhood I didn’t know, despite having lived in Barcelona for so many years. I made the piece for the museum super fast, but I was left with the desire to develop that work because I began to discover that the echoes and the resonances of the entire world could be contained in this very small and humble neighborhood. Therein lies the vocation I aspire to as a filmmaker, to find the universal perspective in local realities.”\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\tThe filmmaker reiterated how neighborhoods like Valbona feel somewhat universal, given that “gentrification is a worldwide phenomenon.” “City centres are converted into tourist attractions, essentially becoming theme parks inaccessible to the local population. These are people who are then marginalized to the peripheries, where a more human, normal daily life remains. It’s a process we can recognize everywhere.”</p>\n<p>\n\tBut the director did not want to look at the periphery “only as a space of victimization,” especially as he finds great richness in such spaces. “It is the same case with cinema itself, where the spaces that offer most freedom and creativity aren’t so much at the centre of the industry but on these peripheries.”</p>\n<p>\n\tGuerin spent around a year selecting characters for the film, and added a few more once filming had started, as his method comprises filming and editing concurrently “to allow me to develop a deeper relationship with the people I film while assessing the plot lines.”</p>\n<p>\n\t“Each of these characters helps synthesize the general human landscape of the neighborhood,” says the filmmaker. “The man without memory is related to the housing blocks that have no memory of the neighborhood. Some characters are farmers who call themselves Catalans of the original land. Others represent the Spanish immigration from the South, and others the global emigration of the new century.”</p>\n<div>\n<figure>\n<p><img srcset=\"https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/VARIETY-SIZING-5.png 1000w, https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/VARIETY-SIZING-5.png?resize=150,100 150w, https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/VARIETY-SIZING-5.png?resize=300,200 300w, https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/VARIETY-SIZING-5.png?resize=910,607 910w, https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/VARIETY-SIZING-5.png?resize=681,454 681w, https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/VARIETY-SIZING-5.png?resize=450,300 450w, https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/VARIETY-SIZING-5.png?resize=250,167 250w\" src=\"https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/VARIETY-SIZING-5.png?w=1000\" alt=\"\" />\n\t</p>\n<figcaption>\n\t\t\t\t\t<span>Good Valley Stories</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCourtesy of San Sebastián Film Festival\n\t</figcaption>\n</figure>\n</div>\n<p>\n\t“All of the world’s current conflicts, from climate change to racism, emigration and real estate speculation, everything is felt there,” he highlights. “There are also traces of the past and signs of the future. So I was coordinating those times with the time of the seasons and finally the time of the film itself. The viewer can intuit how the film is being built, which is why, instead of ‘directed by,’ I go with ’work in progress by’ José Luis Guerín. That will always remain because the film is an open, living process.”</p>\n<p>\n\tThe veteran also emphasizes how one of his great battles is “to promote festivals that don’t discriminate against documentaries.” “On too many occasions, documentary film is seen almost as television reporting. It’s not that documentaries are not a tool for sociological, anthropological, or activist research, but they have to be in dialogue with cinema itself.” \n\t</p>\n<p>\n\t<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/2025/film/columns/voice-of-hind-rajab-nuremberg-is-reality-the-same-as-art-1236525146/\">Last week, <em>Variety </em>critic Owen Gleiberman looked at the case of recent festival films like Kaouther Ben-Hania’s “The Voice of Hind Rajab” and James Vanderbilt’s “Nuremberg”</a> to investigate how the use of documentary footage in both films — a recording of a Palestinian girl’s last words, images of the Nazi concentration camps — may be more powerful than the films themselves. </p>\n<p>\n\tWhen posed with the question, Guerin says there is a certain condescension in the way the industry looks at documentary as solely a medium for social work and cause-driven films. “If you’re filming the Nuremberg trials, your moral duty is to seek the most accurate image without any manipulation. Cinema sometimes has to know how to give in to a cause, but another thing entirely is to impoverish cinema by attributing to documentary cinema a mere and strict role of denunciation. For me, cinema has to do with a desire for revelation, to discover something.”</p>\n<p>\n\t“I’ve learned almost everything from fiction cinema, so, for me, the division between documentary and fiction is irrelevant,” he adds. “You have good cinema and bad cinema. To create a separation for documentary is to treat it condescendingly in the same way it is sometimes reduced to the goodness of the causes it approaches. Social cinema must be nurtured, but there is hardly any genuine critical thinking about documentary cinema because there is a guilt about how you might mishandle something that deals with historical memory or denounces conflicts.”</p>\n<p>\n\t“Good Valley Stories” is a Spanish-French co-production between Los Ilusos Films, Perspective Films, 3CAT, Orfeo Iluso AIE and produced by Javier Lafuente, Jonás Trueba, Gaëlle Jones and José Luis Guerin. Shellac handles sales. </p>\n</div>"
