    "body": "<div><p>\n\tGastón Solnicki’s latest film “The Souffler” is, like his previous work, entrancing and mercurial. There is a straightforward plot here (a hotel manager learns his place of employment will soon be no more), but the Argentine filmmaker uses such a threadbare storyline to string together a broader meditation about a changing world. Told through clipped vignettes around and about said hotelier and his staff, the collaboration between Solnicki and <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/willem-dafoe/\">Willem Dafoe</a> — a bleak, black comedy that’s impressionistic in style and substance — is an utter delight.\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\tWhen Lucius (Willem Dafoe) learns that the Intercontinental Hotel in Vienna he’s been managing for decades has been sold to an Argentinean (played by Solnicki) and will soon be redeveloped, he’s stunned, enraged and, the more he thinks about it, perhaps a tad melancholy. He understands deep down that the loss of the illustrious if rather run-down building is a symptom of something larger. The hotel — as a symbol of a city, a country, a continent even — risks being lost to oblivion. No more guests skating in its nearby rink. No more signature cocktails served at its lavish bar. No more soufflés making their way to those white-linen tables at its restaurant.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tThen again, if the soufflés coming out of the kitchen are any indication, the Vienna Intercontinental should really have its days numbered. As a metaphor for the decline of a decades-old hotel of this size, the dish is both blunt and poetic. The same goes for the snippets of routine Solnicki samples. Although Dafoe’s Lucius does end up waging a bit of a futile, farcical war against said foreign developer, “<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/the-souffleur/\">The Souffleur</a>” (co-written with Julia Niemann) is not really concerned with issues of plot and story. This is a film interested instead in details that capture the loss and loneliness Lucius cannot seem to escape.\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\tPortuguese cinematographer Rui Poças — who lensed films as disparate as “Grand Tour,” “Frankie,” “Zama” and “The Ornithologist”<em> </em>— creates textured, tender portraits of characters set against gorgeous vistas that crowd and expand them. Turning his keen eye on Dafoe and the Intercontinental Hotel with studied still frames, Poças encourages audiences to appreciate the spaces Lucius inhabits, whether he’s spraying water over the rink, sitting alone in the perfectly set restaurant or playing a game of chess with his daughter (Lilly Senn) on the rooftop. As the film unfolds, Lucius slowly begins to lose whatever footing he had in a hotel that seems to be falling into disarray faster than he can make an argument for its historical (let alone financial) value. </p>\n<p>\n\tBut while such a description would suggest Solnicki’s latest film is a languorous project about faded glory and the encroaching violence of global capitalist modernity, that is selling “The Souffleur” short — mostly because with Dafoe at the helm, the Vienna-set project has a wry sensibility throughout. The Hollywood actor’s devilish features and unmistakable crackling voice make for a pitch-perfect pair with Solnicki’s sardonic sensibility. Much as Wes Anderson and Yorgos Lanthimos have plumbed Dafoe’s deliciously wicked sense of humor in pieces that straddle the line between the real and the archly stylized, Solnicki understands that a strong Dafoe performance must always teeter between the two. And so, while his Lucius carries on his shoulders the responsibility to stand up to Solnicki’s Facundo, he’s also a character whose winking personality makes him wholly enjoyable to watch (and listen to) throughout. A late scene where he takes utter delight in messing up the hotel’s electricity and lighting is but one example of how hilariously petty he makes this weathered hotel manager without ever making him a maudlin fool.</p>\n<p>\n\tDafoe, who’d been itching to work with the Argentine filmmaker for quite some time, clearly relished the chance to make this collaboration a fruitful one. Their scenes together, where Lucius and Facundo fail to talk to one another (as the former doesn’t speak Spanish and the latter knows no English) are some of the funniest in the film. They’re proof positive the two accomplished a rare kind of alchemy here, speaking across cultures and languages to create a character study that’s more and more unique the more it gets away from language and story. \n\t</p>\n<p>\n\t“The Souffleur” reflects Solnicki at his most accomplished. This is a film that further establishes him as a filmmaking voice unlike any other. “I don’t like order; I don’t like disorder,” Lucius says during one of the film’s many voiceovers. “I like a combination of the two.” He may as well be describing Solnicki’s approach. </p>\n<p>\n\tThe vignettes that make up the film feel at once painstakingly organized and quite improvisational in spirit. There’s an instinctual stitching that binds its many scenes together that build to a heartwrenching ending, culminating in neither a whimper nor a bang but a welcome sigh of relief. Solnicki has created a sly and slippery kind of film that, much like its leading actor’s grin, is hilarious and devastating in equal measure.</p>\n</div>"

Her long-awaited sophomore album, “<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/2025/music/album-reviews/cardi-b-am-i-the-drama-album-review-1236524658/\">Am I the Drama</a>,” has officially debuted at No. 1, earning 200,000 equivalent album units in the United States, according to Luminate.</p>\n<p>\n\tThe 24-track project racked up 146 million official streams in its first week and sold 88,000 units, boosted by a highly-active rollout that made the album available in a variety of formats. Fans could grab digital downloads, multiple vinyl pressings, and even cheeky “courtroom editions” that poked fun at Cardi’s recent meme-worthy court appearances. (She was found <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/2025/music/news/cardi-b-not-liable-million-assault-lawsuit-1236505438/\">not liable</a> in a highly publicized assault case.)\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\tNever one to play it safe, Cardi hit the ground running during and leading up to her release week: She appeared at indie record stores across the country and met fans, posing for viral pics, and signing albums. She was also interviewed on the “The Jennifer Hudson Show” and Alex Cooper’s “Call Her Daddy” podcast, among other press appearances. </p>\n<p>\n\tUpon its release in 2018, the Grammy-winning “Invasion of Privacy,” marked the biggest sales week for any R&B and hip-hop album that year. The set earned 255,000 equivalent album units in the week ending April 12, 2018. </p>\n<p>\n\tWith “Am I the Drama,” Cardi logs the biggest week for an R&B/hip-hop album by a woman this year. </p>\n<p>\n\tShe will soon take this success on the road for her first tour in six years — the “<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/2025/music/news/cardi-b-little-miss-drama-arena-tour-dates-1236520372/\">Little Miss Drama Tour</a>.” The 30+ date arena run will kick off on Wednesday, February 11 in Palm Desert, CA at Acrisure Arena and include stops across North America in Las Vegas, Los Angeles, Vancouver, Austin, Chicago, New York, Toronto, Philadelphia and more before wrapping up on Friday, April 17 in Atlanta, GA at State Farm Arena. </p>\n</div>"

    "body": "<div><p>\n\tIn view of the major shifts in the movie industry in recent years, successful release strategies are becoming more complicated and specific, calling for tailored strategies to create evergreens and attract communities while still relying on festival premieres, social media promotion and wowing Academy members, according to high-profile guest speakers at the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/zurich-summit/\">Zurich Summit</a> on Saturday.</p>\n<p>\n\tProviding the lowdown on the current state of the business were Patrick Wachsberger, head of 193, Michael Barker, co-president of Sony Pictures Classics, Megan Colligan, president of Row K Entertainment, and 30West’s co-president and COO Daniel Steinman.\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\tPerhaps offering a more novel take, Barker praised the Zurich Film Festival’s industry conference for helping to create greater unity in the independent film sector – something that was not always the case.\n</p>\n<p>\n\t“When I started in the business, it was not such a collegial business,” Barker noted. Pointing to the success of independent films in the 1980s and 1990s, Barker said the sector had become much more “collegial in the last 10 years or so, more out of survival than anything else. And this particular place has done a lot for that.”</p>\n<p>\n\tHe added that the indie business “is always hard because you have to watch your expenses, because there’s limited upside on so many of the films. You have to roll with the changes in history, in how to find that niche audience, how to reach out to that niche audience.”</p>\n<p>\n\tWith many independent theaters going out of business, many films that would not normally play in the multiplexes now have to play in the multiplexes. “So you have to make totally new models on how you release a film. You have to pay attention to every revenue stream.”\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\tWhile every company has a different mission and a different agenda, for Sony Classics, “theatrical still has to remain the primary even if the gross goes down.”</p>\n<p>\n\tIt’s essential to “make that marketing impression on the public that these films are the films that become evergreens,” Barker stressed.</p>\n<p>\n\t“One of the keys to Sony Pictures Classics is not only opening a movie and getting the widest audience possible theatrically, but making that film into an evergreen. And those opportunities are there more than ever in making films evergreens if that marketing impression is made on the public, and hopefully they come to the movie theater.”</p>\n<p>\n\tWhat’s become more difficult is that every film is different and needs to be treated differently, he added. “The distributor has to be more creative than ever before. We have a movie called ‘<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/becoming-led-zeppelin/\">Becoming Led Zeppelin</a>‘ and we worked it out with Imax on how to present that documentary with Imax. We were doing Imax again with this anime film we have called ‘<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/scarlet/\">Scarlet</a>.’ We’re going to release ‘Merrily We Roll Along’ with Fathom because they have access to a wide number of screens.”</p>\n<p>\n\tWachsberger stressed that “the traditional spend, I think those days are over. It is more like you have to be completely digital. Everything is interconnected. … For independent movies, it’s really about going to festivals.”</p>\n<p>\n\tUnderscoring the importance of authenticity, Colligan said it used to be “that the genius marketing was to be able to convince an audience that a movie was something and then let them find out later it wasn’t that. I think that’s a lot harder in this day and age, and you can get really burned doing that. I think you have to kind of find what the most authentic truth of your movie is and really lean into that.”</p>\n<p>\n\tCommunal connection can likewise play a significant factor. “I think people are looking for how they connect into community,” Colligan said. “So if you’ve read a book and a movie’s based on a book, that can be a sense of community. If you love Pierce Brosnan, that can be a sense of community. There’s lots of ways to tap into the concept around community, but I think fundamentally, people want to spend their time watching things, spending time with things that they’re likely to love. Their time is valuable and the things that they choose to do also reflect who they are.”\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\tDistributors also have to be cognizant of how social media is used and how to create structure, which can be difficult in the movie business, she added.</p>\n<p>\n\t“When you’re at a concert, you can film yourself dancing to Beyoncé, you can film her on stage. There’s a lot to represent the time that you’ve spent doing something. In the film business it’s a little bit more silent, how to represent your love of something or your time spent doing something. I think those are some of the technological innovations that we have to think about and think about the experience, too.”</p>\n<p>\n\tShe noted, for example, that exhibition sector companies, which have been through a lot, have been investing a great deal in how they deal with their theaters.  </p>\n<p>\n\t“I think from the minute you walk in to the minute you leave, it’s really important that the consumer is being served in a really great way. I am not sure in all cases that’s happening to the best of our collective ability. I think it’s incumbent upon all of us to figure out how to make that a really great experience. And I think we’ve lost something a little bit along the way.”</p>\n<p>\n\tThe panelists also decried the increasing loss of film critics in major newspapers and trades.</p>\n<p>\n\t“Critics still are very important and still matter to some movies; it’s a real lifeline,” Colligan said. “If you’re in the 90s on Rotten Tomatoes, there is no doubt that that matters.”</p>\n<p>\n\tWhile many film fans have lost their favorite movie critics, others, namely younger people, are finding their way into cinema via Letterboxd, she added.</p>\n<p>\n\t“Letterboxd is a really interesting platform and I do think it’s done a lot to engage younger moviegoers and it feels like a very authentic, dynamic way to learn about movies and voices that younger people are wanting to hear. So I think that there are alternatives that matter for some movies more than other movies, for sure.”</p>\n<p>\n\tDespite the growing popularity of foreign films, some politically challenging pics appear to remain difficult for U.S. distributors.</p>\n<p>\n\tLast year’s Oscar-winning “No Other Land,” about the destruction of a Palestinian community in the occupied West Bank by Israeli soldiers, found no U.S. distribution. This year, “The Voice of Hind Rajab,” about a little Palestinian girl brutally killed by Israeli soldiers in Gaza, which received a 23-minute standing ovation in Venice, has a 96% score on Rotten Tomatoes and boasts Brad Pitt, Joaquin Phoenix, Rooney Mara, Alfonso Cuarón and Jonathan Glazer as executive producers, seems to be having equal difficulty in the U.S.\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\tBarker explained that it ultimately comes down to audience interest. “I’ve had a lot of movies with difficult subjects.” For Barker and the Sony Pictures Classics team, the question is, “Is there an audience for the film theatrically, and will people go to see that film theatrically? And can we reach them? If we feel we can’t reach them, we’re not going to pursue that film. It’s not because of an incendiary plot point or whatever.”</p>\n<p>\n\tWith regard to “No Other Land,” Barker said, “We looked at what the theatrical possibilities were, and long before the film won the Oscar, we did not feel that film would do well in the box office theatrically. That is why we didn’t pursue that film.”</p>\n<p>\n\tWachsberger added, however: “I think there are subjects today that people are basically concerned about getting involved with.”</p>\n</div>"

    "body": "<div><p>\n\tThere is an astonishing reminder early on in director <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/john-dower/\">John Dower</a>’s spirited documentary, “<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/the-balloonists/\">The Balloonists</a>,” a crowd-pleaser for Jules Verne fans and adventure lovers alike. There are only 66 short years between 1903, when the Wright Brothers flew the world’s first airplane, and 1969, when mankind landed on the moon. Considering the lightning speed of technological advancements in the skies, one would think there wasn’t another triumph left to pursue on the aviation front, at least on this side of the atmosphere. That realization certainly crossed the mind of Swiss explorer Bertrand Piccard when he was an impassioned kid, the kind (in his words) who would only be moved by a rocket going to the moon, and not by a football game.\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\tExcept, there was still one feat not yet achieved by anyone: circling the entire globe in an uninterrupted hot air balloon journey, a record-breaking quest that Piccard and his counterpart Brian Jones successfully completed in 1999. But it took a while for Picard to get there. For starters, his adorably nerdy interests at a young age didn’t quite make him the most popular student at his school, where even the teachers picked on him for his peculiarities. And what exactly is the next step when one decides to become an explorer, Piccard wondered? But the headstrong adventurer’s life changed after he discovered the world of hot air balloons and made them his life’s passion.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tIn some way, it was inevitable for him to take such an extraordinary route. After all, he came from a long line of inventors and explorers: His grandfather, Auguste, was the first person to enter the stratosphere in a hot air balloon in 1931. An oceanographer and engineer, his father Jacques became the first scientist (along with his colleague Lt. Don Walsh) to reach the floor of the Pacific Ocean’s Mariana Trench in 1960, inside a state-of-the-art submarine that he built. \n\t</p>\n<p>\n\tThat family history was both the right fuel for Piccard and something to live up to, a fact that filmmaker Dower lovingly interprets through a stunning wealth of archival footage and first-person interviews within his film’s compact running time. Through it all, he portrays Piccard’s personality in the fullest sense possible, giving us the story of a driven human being who stubbornly defended his vision for the trip  (sometimes, too stubbornly) and never lost his sense of wonder.</p>\n<p>\n\tThe mission’s various twists and turns eventually united Piccard with British flight instructor Jones, who temporarily swapped his serene married life in England with the voyage, adopting Piccard’s obsession as his own. Running in parallel to the storylines of Piccard and Jones is the global race of the time where many prominent figures, from accomplished aviators to billionaire Richard Branson, were trying to become the first around-the-globe balloonists. This context and backdrop adorns the film with considerable energy, various colorful personalities and smartly edited archival news footage that deepens our understanding of the perilous stakes.</p>\n<p>\n\tBut what’s ultimately the most impressive (and deserving of the big screen) is Piccard and Jones’ actual journey. Here, if the phrase “hot air balloon” conjures up the image of a colorful inflatable mass and a quaint basket in your mind, you might want to trade that for something that looks more like a claustrophobic spacecraft. That’s the environment in which Piccard and Jones lived for nearly three weeks, gliding across oceans and deserts, often in treacherous weather conditions. What they see outside of their window — sometimes, so deeply frozen that they had to scrape off the ice using creative methods — is simply breathtaking, ranging from deep blue seas to expansive sand dunes. Every now and then, an empty fuel tank gets released from the balloon with considerable visual drama. Other times, the duo wonders whether they have enough fuel to complete the expedition across the Atlantic stretch.</p>\n<p>\n\tIn its final chapter, “The Balloonists” plays like an “Apollo 13”-adjacent thriller, especially when the ground crew loses connection with Piccard and Jones. And even though we know the successful outcome of their journey, Dower’s filmmaking panache keeps us invested in the mystery and danger of men going toe-to-toe with nature. On those grounds alone, “The Balloonists” is a deeply satisfying experience. Outside of that, it has the disposition of a vintage buddy movie and an underdog tale, one that celebrates human determination and the notion of advancement through science.</p>\n</div>"

    "body": "<div><p>\n\tA smart, withheld story about the borders between people, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/ulrich-kohler/\">Ulrich Köhler</a>’s self-reflexive “<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/gavagai/\">Gavagai</a>” chronicles on-set tensions between the cast and crew of a filmed update of “Medea” and subtle fissures caused by a racist skirmish during its premiere. Its reinterpretation of Euripides’ play has its symbolic limits — intentional and otherwise — but it makes for an effective backdrop to the widely connected world of international art-house cinema and numerous ongoing debates on cultural optics. Rather than fighting this inevitable tide, Köhler closely examines the subject without didacticism, filtering it through a passive-aggressive relationship drama, until only its most potent ingredients remain.\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\tAn ambitious (and slightly dangerous) scene on a speedboat introduces us to a “Medea” set in some version of Senegal blending modernity and antiquity. The vengeful, eponymous matriarch, played by German actress Maja Tervooren (Maren Eggert), has killed her children and attempts to present their bloodied corpses to her husband Jason, embodied fiercely by French-Senegalese star Nourou Cissokho (Jean-Christophe Folly). The scene doesn’t go as planned, leading its irate French director Caroline Lescot (Nathalie Richard) to cause a slapstick ruckus, shot at a distance by Köhler’s camera.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tTempers fly as “Gavagai” pulls back to reveal behind-the-scenes chaos, including a hastily rewritten climax that irks the performers. Meanwhile, Cissokho’s father Mansour (Roch Peton), a respected Senegalese actor, is lumped in with hungry extras in the sweltering Dakar heat, but the solution to this conundrum involves gestural Band-Aids that neither fix not acknowledge the root issues, as Caroline redirects her grievances toward Maja, accusing her of being just another member of the bourgeoisie incapable of accessing the right emotions or experiences. All the while, the director insists on keeping uncomfortable life vests on the child actors, in service of superficial commentary on Europe’s migrant crisis.\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\t“Gavagai” drips with irony from the word “go,” but Caroline (clearly modeled after Claire Denis) isn’t the movie’s focus. As the shoot winds down, Köhler observes Maja and Nourou engaging in flirtatious tête-à-têtes barely hidden from view. Seemingly mundane chats over dinner illuminate each dynamic in unexpected ways, though these dueling tensions — accusations of inauthenticity that span entire continents — remain unresolved when “Gavagai” skips forward to the characters’ star-studded Berlinale premiere. </p>\n<p>\n\tIn the cold and austere German winter (a far cry from Dakar’s physical and cultural warmth), an anxious Nourou acts up outside a hotel and is accosted by a Polish security guard, setting off a minor chain reaction in which Maja intervenes on his behalf, much to his chagrin. Each new development is underscored by a lingering discomfort about the racial dynamics of the skirmish and about Maja taking action where Nourou might have wanted to leave the whole thing be. Few characters directly address the incident, but its effects linger through the evening.</p>\n<p>\n\tThe subsequent uncertainty and introspection are exacerbated during a pre-festival press conference, which becomes a flashpoint when the cast and crew come under fire for an allegedly careless adaptation. Here, Köhler avoids the temptation to make caricatures out of either the fiery journalists or the defensive cast and crew. In the process, he highlights the numerous pitfalls in remixing old work for the modern world, with its numerous, clashing racial contexts. For instance, Caroline thoughtlessly cites James Baldwin as her North Star for making “Medea” a story of a white woman living as a minority among Africans in order to comment on oppression, an inversion that draws stunned responses. It’s hilariously awkward, but Köhler pulls off a remarkable balancing act by tethering his lens to the director and her naive sincerity.</p>\n<p>\n\tIf “Gavagai” has a major flaw, it’s that it returns too frequently to scenes of Caroline’s “Medea” to emphasize its point and to re-state the connections between the play and its own contemporary drama. However. Köhler’s unbroken visual remove allows his actors to let arguments grow and play out at length. In lieu of a musical score, their dramatic rhythms shape each scene, resulting in simmering tensions that emerge gradually and organically, as Nourou and Maja refuse to acknowledge the personal and professional grievances that prevent them from forging a lasting love. The result is deeply engaging.\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\tThe film’s title recalls the analytical philosophy of W.V. Quine, who posited a scenario where the word “gavagai” (in a made-up native language) could be interpreted in numerous ways. “Gavagai,” therefore, becomes a Tower of Babel story. Characters are seen occasionally translating phrases between French, English, German and Wolof — even the opening credits are presented in four languages — but in Köhler’s conception of the European film world, the folly of humanity isn’t different dialects, but rather, divergent frames of reference and lived experience based on ethnicity and nationality. These gridlocks prevent characters from effectively communicating how they hope to be seen. In the process, their humanity is rarely acknowledged on their own terms. The movie may be simple on its surface, but its conclusions verge on devastating. <strong> </strong></p>\n</div>"

    "body": "<div><p>\n\tSorry, cosplayers, if you’re looking for where to buy Leonardo DiCaprio’s dad robe from “<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/one-battle-after-another/\">One Battle After Another</a>,” you’re going to have a hard time finding it.</p>\n<p>\n\tThe film’s costume designer, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/colleen-atwood/\">Colleen Atwood,</a> confirms it was made from old fabric. “I found some vintage-looking fabric and made the multiples I needed for the robe,” she tells <em>Variety.</em></p>\n<p>\n\tIn the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/paul-thomas-anderson/\">Paul Thomas Anderson</a> film, out this weekend, DiCaprio plays Bob, a revolutionary turned stoner dad who is hanging around his house and has to quickly leave to go in search of his teenage daughter Willa, played by Chase Infiniti.\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\tOriginally, the idea was that Bob was going to be wearing a sweatshirt. But Atwood says, “I don’t know if it’s Paul or Leo who said, ‘What if he’s just in his robe?'” And so Bob, recalling Jeff Bridges’ dazed character in “The Big Lebowski,” spends a good chunk of the movie in his robe.</p>\n<p>\n\tAt the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/2025/film/news/leonardo-dicaprio-one-battle-after-another-premiere-1236512409/\">film’s premiere</a>, DiCaprio described his character as a guy “that sits home and smokes pot all the time,” and said he “took a lot of inspiration” from Bridges’ performance as The Dude.</p>\n<p>\n\tThe plaid robe itself was made from a cotton-wool blend. “It’s an old, cheap dad robe. It’s a comfortable and cozy robe. And we aged the fabric a lot.”</p>\n<p>\n\t And so, finding the costume for him became a fluid process, with the sunglasses and hat coming into the mix. </p>\n<p>\n\tBob’s sneakers also needed to be considered. </p>\n<p>\n\t“A lot of stuff, Leo did it himself. So we had to protect him from the world,” Atwood explains. “Somebody told him about these sneakers that are popular with runners and so we dialled into that brand.” Apparently Leo likes a wide toe box, because he ended up wearing Altra Lone Peak trail runners with the orange sole. “Those are great because we got them filthy, but you’ll see a bit of the orange showing.”\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\tFor those who wish to dress as Bob this Halloween in a robe just like his, Atwood jokes, “A nice Goodwill shop will do the job.”</p>\n<div>\n<figure>\n<p><img srcset=\"https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/rev-1-OBAA-00364245-2_High_Res_JPEG.jpeg 4096w, https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/rev-1-OBAA-00364245-2_High_Res_JPEG.jpeg?resize=150,114 150w, https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/rev-1-OBAA-00364245-2_High_Res_JPEG.jpeg?resize=300,228 300w\" src=\"https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/rev-1-OBAA-00364245-2_High_Res_JPEG.jpeg?w=1024\" alt=\"\" />\n\t</p>\n<figcaption>\n\t</figcaption>\n</figure>\n</div>\n<p>\n\tElsewhere, Willa’s ensemble at the dance with the petticoat dress was inspired by something Anderson had seen. “Before Chase was even cast, and a twinkle in Paul’s eye, we did camera tests with different dresses,” says Atwood. She had ideas in mind, but when Anderson and the film’s production designer, Florencia Martin, went to Eureka High School, the director saw a young girl in an old petticoat skirt. Atwood says, “Paul goes, ‘I really liked it.’ So, I made it in a faded, dirty pink at first.”</p>\n<p>\n\tHowever, once Atwood looked at the environment and where the character was emotionally, pink seemed more vulnerable, so Atwood switched it to blue. “It was a better color, and with the jacket, in our world, it seemed more low-key.”</p>\n<div>\n<figure>\n<p><img srcset=\"https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/rev-1-OBAA-DUS-R4v51_041225-17_High_Res_JPEG-2.jpeg 6144w, https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/rev-1-OBAA-DUS-R4v51_041225-17_High_Res_JPEG-2.jpeg?resize=150,100 150w, https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/rev-1-OBAA-DUS-R4v51_041225-17_High_Res_JPEG-2.jpeg?resize=300,200 300w, https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/rev-1-OBAA-DUS-R4v51_041225-17_High_Res_JPEG-2.jpeg?resize=1920,1280 1920w, https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/rev-1-OBAA-DUS-R4v51_041225-17_High_Res_JPEG-2.jpeg?resize=1360,907 1360w, https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/rev-1-OBAA-DUS-R4v51_041225-17_High_Res_JPEG-2.jpeg?resize=1000,667 1000w, https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/rev-1-OBAA-DUS-R4v51_041225-17_High_Res_JPEG-2.jpeg?resize=910,607 910w, https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/rev-1-OBAA-DUS-R4v51_041225-17_High_Res_JPEG-2.jpeg?resize=681,454 681w, https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/rev-1-OBAA-DUS-R4v51_041225-17_High_Res_JPEG-2.jpeg?resize=450,300 450w, https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/rev-1-OBAA-DUS-R4v51_041225-17_High_Res_JPEG-2.jpeg?resize=250,167 250w\" src=\"https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/rev-1-OBAA-DUS-R4v51_041225-17_High_Res_JPEG-2.jpeg?w=1024\" alt=\"\" />\n\t</p>\n<figcaption>\n\t</figcaption>\n</figure>\n</div>\n<p>\n\tBenicio del Toro’s Sensei Sergio runs a karate dojo where Willa trains. In finding his look, Atwood went to Del Toro’s house for a fitting and took a rack of options for him, including a white karategi. An initial idea was that he would wear that with a zip-up jacket from Puma. “But it made no sense having him in a full white outfit being chased around,” Atwood says. “Anyone in their right mind would have taken the top off so people couldn’t identify him.”</p>\n<p>\n\tIn the film, he’s at the dojo relaxing after work. So, Atwood collaborated with Jimmy McBride, a custom denim designer. “He had this jacket that I knew about, but it was too fancy. So, we took the lines of it and made it basic,” she says. McBride stripped the jacket down to a chainstitch-embroidered jean jacket that fit the Sensei’s vibe.</p>\n<figure></figure>\n<p>\n\tTo complete the look, Atwood put him in cowboy boots that she had found in New Mexico. “I had [them] made in his size.” She adds, “They’re a cross between an early ‘Rebel Without a Cause’-kind of boot and a cowboy boot leaning into the West.”</p>\n<div>\n<figure>\n<p><img srcset=\"https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/rev-1-OBAA-DUS-R8v47F_021325-15_High_Res_JPEG-2.jpeg 6144w, https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/rev-1-OBAA-DUS-R8v47F_021325-15_High_Res_JPEG-2.jpeg?resize=150,100 150w, https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/rev-1-OBAA-DUS-R8v47F_021325-15_High_Res_JPEG-2.jpeg?resize=300,200 300w, https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/rev-1-OBAA-DUS-R8v47F_021325-15_High_Res_JPEG-2.jpeg?resize=1920,1280 1920w, https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/rev-1-OBAA-DUS-R8v47F_021325-15_High_Res_JPEG-2.jpeg?resize=1360,907 1360w, https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/rev-1-OBAA-DUS-R8v47F_021325-15_High_Res_JPEG-2.jpeg?resize=1000,667 1000w, https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/rev-1-OBAA-DUS-R8v47F_021325-15_High_Res_JPEG-2.jpeg?resize=910,607 910w, https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/rev-1-OBAA-DUS-R8v47F_021325-15_High_Res_JPEG-2.jpeg?resize=681,454 681w, https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/rev-1-OBAA-DUS-R8v47F_021325-15_High_Res_JPEG-2.jpeg?resize=450,300 450w, https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/rev-1-OBAA-DUS-R8v47F_021325-15_High_Res_JPEG-2.jpeg?resize=250,167 250w\" src=\"https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/rev-1-OBAA-DUS-R8v47F_021325-15_High_Res_JPEG-2.jpeg?w=1024\" alt=\"\" />\n\t</p>\n<figcaption>\n\t</figcaption>\n</figure>\n</div>\n</div>"
