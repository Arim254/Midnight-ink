    "body": "<div><p>\n\tNew York City mayor candidate <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/zohran-mamdani/\">Zohran Mamdani</a> is pulling out of a televised town hall with WABC News on Sept. 25 due to <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/abc/\">ABC</a>‘s suspension of “<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/jimmy-kimmel/\">Jimmy Kimmel</a> Live.”</p>\n<p>\n\tLast week, the network kowtowed to threats from Donald Trump’s Federal Communications Commission and suspended “Jimmy Kimmel Live” indefinitely following the host’s remarks about the murder of Charlie Kirk. The move was met with swift backlash from <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/2025/tv/news/400-celebrities-aclu-protest-jimmy-kimmel-suspension-1236526119/\">Hollywood figures</a>, Democratic leaders and even some conservative politicians like <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/2025/tv/news/ted-cruz-fcc-jimmy-kimmel-brendan-carr-1236524620/\">Ted Cruz</a>. Protests against ABC parent company Disney broke out in New York and Los Angeles.\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\tMamdani announced he was bowing out of the event, broadcast on ABC’s local New York channel, in defense of free speech and in protest to ABC. “We simply cannot accept any capitulation to Donald Trump’s attacks on our fundamental freedoms,” Mamdani said in a statement to amNY, which <a href=\"https://www.amny.com/news/mamdani-pull-abc-town-hall-jimmy-kimmel-suspension/\" target=\"_blank\">broke the news</a>. “Now is the time for leadership that fights back with action, and collectively, we must use every tool at our disposal to send a message to Washington and corporate powers alike: our freedom to speech is not a bargaining chip.”\n</p>\n<p>\n\tMamdani delivered remarks at a news conference Monday morning at Franklin D. Roosevelt Four Freedoms State Park on Roosevelt Island, a location that honored the president’s 1941 State of the Union address, which listed the freedom of speech as one of four fundamental freedoms of American democracy.</p>\n<p>\n\tOn Wednesday, after Kimmel made comments about the murder of Charlie Kirk on his late-night show and mocked Trump’s reaction to it, FCC chairman Brendan Carr threatened regulatory pressure on broadcasters who aired remarks he considered misleading or against the public interest. Within hours, Nexstar and Sinclair, companies that own ABC affiliate channels, vowed to pull broadcasts of “Jimmy Kimmel Live,” and ABC immediately followed suit, benching the comedian indefinitely.\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\tOn Friday, <em>Variety</em> reported that Kimmel and Disney were <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/2025/tv/news/jimmy-kimmel-abc-disney-late-night-comeback-1236524695/\">working to reach a compromise</a> to bring his show back on-air, but no agreement has been made. Disney has continued to compensate Kimmel’s staff during the work stoppage.</p>\n</div>"

    "body": "<div><p>\n\t<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/mo-amer/\">Mo Amer</a> has set his third Netflix comedy special, “Wild World,” which will debut on the platform on Oct. 28.</p>\n<p>\n\tNetflix calls the special a “timely and fiercely honest hour” that sees the stand-up comedian celebrating his Palestinian heritage, reliving the birth of his son and taking aim at the TSA.</p>\n<p>\n\tAmer is the co-creator and star of the Netflix comedy series “Mo,” which debuted in 2022 and ran for two seasons. The sitcom is loosely based on Amer’s own life as a Palestinian refugee living in Texas.\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\tAs a stand-up comic, Amer delivered the special “The Vagabond” in 2018 and followed it up with the 2021 hour “Mohammed in Texas,” both for Netflix. Earlier this year, Amer set out on “El Oso Palestino” comedy tour — that’s Spanish for “The Palestinian Bear.”\n</p>\n<p>\n\tIn his early days as a comedian, Amer found an ally in Dave Chappelle, who invited him on tour in 2015 and had him come out to Ohio during the pandemic to perform at his COVID-bubble comedy club. In June, Chappelle gave a rare interview with <em>Variety</em>, joining Amer in an <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/2025/tv/news/dave-chappelle-mo-amer-politics-comedy-snl-monologues-1236414683/\">Actors on Actors conversation</a> about political comedy, “Saturday Night Live” and “Mo.”</p>\n<p>\n\tIn addition to his live comedy, Amer starred on Ramy Youssef’s Hulu show “Ramy,” and in 2022 he appeared in the 2022 DC comic book film “Black Adam,” led by Dwayne Johnson.</p>\n<p>\n\t“Mo Amer: Wild World” is directed by Amer himself, and executive produced by Mike Bertolina and Mustafa Abuelhija. All Things Comedy is the production company.</p>\n</div>"

    "body": "<div><p>\n\tAfter two episodes of <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/2025/tv/news/the-view-jimmy-kimmel-silent-abc-fcc-chair-threats-1236523328/\">staying silent</a> on the matter, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/whoopi-goldberg/\">Whoopi Goldberg</a> and her co-hosts on ABC’s “<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/the-view/\">The View</a>” have finally commented on <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/jimmy-kimmel/\">Jimmy Kimmel</a>‘s suspension by the network. Fans had been theorizing amid their silence that the hosts were instructed by their parent company not to discuss Kimmel’s suspension. During the Monday, Sept. 22 episode of “The View,” Goldberg opened the show by saying: , “Did y’all really think we weren’t going to talk about Jimmy Kimmel? I mean, have you watched the show over the last 29 seasons? No one silences us.”\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\t“When the news broke last week about Jimmy Kimmel’s suspension, we took a breath to see if Jimmy was going to say anything about it first,” Goldberg added. “You cannot like a show and it can go off the air. Someone can say something they shouldn’t and get taken off the air. But the government cannot apply pressure to force someone to be silenced.”\n</p>\n<p>\n\tAna Navarro added: “I don’t understand how in this country, where the First Amendment was made to the Constitution to guarantee freedom of the press and freedom of speech, how the government itself is using its weight and power to bully and scare people into silence.”</p>\n<p>\n\t“The First Amendment is the first for a reason, because you need to be able to hold those in power accountable,” Alyssa Farah Griffin said.</p>\n<p>\n\tGoldberg ended with a message of equality.</p>\n<p>\n\t“We talk about freedom of speech a lot because we are always in somebody’s mess because somebody has decided that we have said something that’s offensive,” she said. “But we fight for everybody’s right to have freedom of speech because it means my speech is free, it means your speech is free.”\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\tOn Sept. 18, the day after ABC announced Kimmel’s suspension, FCC chairman Brendan Carr suggested the FCC look into “The View” as well. The hosts’ silence on the matter during the next day’s episode only confounded fans more.</p>\n<p>\n\t“When you look at these other TV shows, what’s interesting is the FCC does have a rule called the equal opportunity rule. But there’s an exception to that rule called the bona fide news exception, which means if you are a bona fide news program, you don’t have to abide by the equal opportunity rule.” Carr said on a radio show. “Over the years, the FCC has developed a body of case law on that and has suggested that most of these late night shows, other than ‘SNL,’ are bona fide news programs. Potentially I would assume you can make the argument that ‘The View’ is a bona fide news show, but I’m not so sure about that, and I think it’s worthwhile to have the FCC look into whether ‘The View’ and some of the programs that you have still qualify as bona fide news programs and therefore exempt from the equal opportunity regime that Congress has put in place.”</p>\n<p>\n\tUnlike the hosts of “The View,” many non-ABC television hosts were quick to condemn Kimmel’s suspension. Stephen Colbert <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/2025/tv/news/stephen-colbert-rips-abc-pulling-kimmel-censorship-1236522765/\">called the decision </a>“blatant censorship” to appease Donald Trump, while Jimmy Fallon <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/2025/tv/news/jimmy-fallon-hopes-kimmel-returns-censored-trump-1236523814/\">expressed his desire</a> for Kimmel to return to air and vowed never to stop making Trump jokes even if there are fears it will get “The Tonight Show” censored.</p>\n<p>\n\t“This is misery,” David Letterman <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/2025/tv/news/david-letterman-slams-jimmy-kimmel-suspension-1236523616/\">said when asked</a> about Kimmel’s suspension. “I feel bad about this. We see where this is all going, correct? It’s managed media. And it’s no good. It’s silly. It’s ridiculous. And you can’t go around firing somebody because you’re fearful or trying to suck up to an authoritarian criminal administration in the Oval Office. That’s just not how this works.”</p>\n<p>\n\tHoward Stern <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/2025/tv/news/howard-stern-cancels-disney-plus-jimmy-kimmel-suspended-1236526075/\">announced he canceled</a> his Disney+ subscription because of ABC’s decision to yank Kimmel off the air and explained: “I just know when the government begins to interfere, when the government says, ‘I’m not pleased with you, so we’re gonna orchestrate a way to silence you,’ it’s the wrong direction for our country… I’m canceling my Disney+. I’m trying to say with the pocketbook that I do not support what they’re doing with Jimmy.”\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\tKimmel remains off the air as of the morning of Monday, Sept. 22.</p>\n</div>"

The event, presented by Chanel, will take place Nov. 12 in New York City.</p>\n<p>\n\t<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/moma/\">MoMA</a>‘s Film Benefit is an annual event dedicated to the continuation and growth of the museum’s department of film, specifically its collection of over 30,000 films and 1.5 million film stills and its series of screenings, premiers, festivals and retrospectives. The Benefit honors actors, writers and directors who have made significant contributions to the craft. \n\t</p>\n<p>\n\tCoppola certainly fits the bill, as she began acting at an early age and has written and directed nine feature films. Five of her films are included in MoMA’s collection: “The Virgin Suicides” (1999), “Lost in Translation” (2003), “Marie Antoinette” (2006), “Somewhere” (2010) and “The Bling Ring” (2013). For “Lost In Translation,” she won the Academy Award for best original screenplay and was nominated for both best director and best picture.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tThe museum’s Celeste Bartos Chief Curator of Film Rajendra Roy said in a statment Monday, “Developing long-term relationships with artists is one of the profound privileges and responsibilities for an institution like MoMA. Sofia Coppola has been a part of the Museum’s artist family since her emergence as an acclaimed director over 25 years ago. We celebrated her in 2004 as a part of our ‘Work in Progress’ series, and we are thrilled to welcome her back now as a field-leading icon.”</p>\n<p>\n\tCoinciding with the Film Benefit, MoMA will also screen all nine of Coppola’s feature films as well as her 1998 short “Lick The Star.” The series is titled “Sofia Coppola: A Tribute” and will take place in the museum’s Roy and Niuta Titus Theaters from Oct. 30 through Nov. 16. </p>\n</div>"

    "body": "<div><p>\n\tAfter 12 seasons playing Dr. Jackson Avery on “Grey’s Anatomy,” <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/jesse-williams/\">Jesse Williams</a> is ready to play a lead in a totally different realm: the international TV space.</p>\n<p>\n\tIn new <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/prime-video/\">Prime Video</a> Italy original “<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/hotel-costiera/\">Hotel Costiera</a>,” Williams — who left “Grey’s” in 2021 but had guest roles on almost every season since then — plays an Italian-American former Marine named Daniel De Luca, who is a problem-solver in one of the most exclusive hotels in the world in Positano on Italy’s iconic Amalfi Coast.\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\tHe is a guest of the hotel owner because DD, as everyone knows him, is the only person who caught a glimpse of the man who may have kidnapped the owner’s daughter. Therefore, he’s the only person who may be able to hunt the kidnapper down. Aside from that storyline, DD basically solves a case in each episode.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tAlongside Williams, “Hotel Costiera” — which drops on Wednesday in the U.S., U.K., Italy and several other territories — features a rich ensemble cast comprising Maria Chiara Giannetta, Jordan Alexandra, Antonio Gerardi, Sam Haygarth, Tommaso Ragno, Amanda Campana, Pierpaolo Spollon, Alejandra Onieva and Jean-Hugues Anglade.</p>\n<p>\n\tThe six-episode show is co-produced by Amazon MGM Studios and Luca Bernabei for Lux Vide, the Fremantle-owned Italian company behind global shows such as “Medici” and financial thriller “Devils.”</p>\n<p>\n\tBelow, Williams speaks to<em> Variety</em> about how he became deeply involved in “Hotel Costiera,” on which he also serves as a hands-on executive producer.</p>\n\t<h5>\n\t\t<strong>What drew you to this project?</strong>\t</h5>\n<p>\n\tIt came to me as an early idea, kind of fleshed out in Italian and then translated into English. It was this core concept created by [producer] Luca Bernabei, with Adam Bernstein making it. So I read the material and met with Adam. I just really loved the [show’s] world. I think I really gravitated towards this guy who had fully committed himself to something in the military and finds himself having to start over. He’s also a character who’s from two worlds. I think there was a relatability factor there, as somebody who’s American but biracial in a polarized country, and authentically of two worlds.\n\t</p>\n\t<h5>\n\t\t<strong>Tell me more.</strong>\t</h5>\n<p>\n\tAll those factors originally attracted me to just kind of want to play with it. And I had been, at the time, wanting to think more about global creativity: thinking outside the borders of the U.S. I always found that interesting. I went to film school, and that’s the lens through which I see the world. You watch Fellini and you’re learning about other places, like also Korea and Japan, through their cinema. Americans aren’t always known for their ability to open up and process and absorb other cultures.</p>\n\t<h5>\n\t\t<strong>What drew you to the show’s global aspect?</strong>\t</h5>\n<p>\n\tAfter I’d left the show [“Grey’s Anatomy”] I was on for so long, [I was] just trying to do a lot of things I had never done. I went straight to Broadway and doing some indie film, just kind of doing everything I hadn’t done. And in this way, I was like, what if I get out of the country and go make something somewhere else.</p>\n<p>\n\tI got a big global footprint because of “Grey’s.” It’s a monster show. So I’ve got some juice in other places. I’d always loved to travel and love to be reminded that there is a whole big world out there. And I think that American audiences are coming to that realization again. I think that cycling back around, we see an appetite to watch shows with a little bit of subtitles, different languages, different cultures. We’ve seen things really pop like “Money Heist” and “Squid Game.” And I think that’s encouraging. Anything that kind of brings us together, I think is encouraging.</p>\n\t<h5>\n\t\t<strong>“Hotel Costiera” is interesting because you play a guy who is rooted in two countries. Did you contribute to developing that aspect?</strong>\t</h5>\n<p>\n\tYes, I was certainly involved in character development. One of the things I wanted to explore with this character is that he’s half Black Italian and half American. That’s a different experience. What are little ways that we can nod to that? That we can acknowledge and include that, without it becoming a lesson? And we have little pieces [of that backstory] kind of peppered in. We had really cool help from consulting producer Trey Ellis, a writer who’s a Black American who lived in Italy forever.</p>\n\t<h5>\n\t\t<strong>Tell me more about Daniel. He has this Neapolitan street kid aspect, known in local slang as “scugnizzo.”</strong>\t</h5>\n<p>\n\tDaniel is somebody who grew up as a street kid in Naples with a character in the show named Bignè, who was one of his old running buddies. And that’s where a lots of his street savvy comes from; his comfort with folks who might be deemed undesirable. That’s his edge. He doesn’t come from high society Naples or Rome, or even Amalfi. I think that has proven to be an important detail. Because now he finds himself working in this hotel with all these wealthy privileged people. So he does all that with a bit of a smirk. He was raised kind of running around the streets, not with a nuclear family. Not with a solid family unit. That kind of fracture probably also sets him up for diving into the military, creating a family. So he keeps finding himself in support of systems [like the hotel] that will kind of hold him, or at least give him mission, give him purpose.\n\t</p>\n\t<h5>\n\t\t<strong>What was it like acting in Italian? Your accent is pretty good. Did you work with a voice coach?</strong>\t</h5>\n<p>\n\tThat was tough for me. Some people take to languages very easily. I admit that I don’t. So I just studied. I had a really great set of coaches. I did a little bit of work before I left the U.S. to start prep and had somebody on set at all times. It was a combination of, I’m being honest, learning syntax and learning some basic rules around the language. So it was a labor of love. It was really fun to do when I nailed it. And I had a lot of teachers, because our entire production crew is Italian.</p>\n\t<h5>\n\t\t<strong>You are the only American actor on the show. What was it like working with an international cast?</strong>\t</h5>\n<p>\n\tThe casting process was really fun. I was very involved in all the casting of every single member. So you’re watching these great tapes from people all over the world, and several of them auditioned for different roles than they ended up playing. Luckily, we got the best in every category, and comedically it made for a really cool kind of melange of styles. I really love British comedy, from “Monty Python” to Ricky Gervais to everything in between. And Sam Haygarth and Jordan Alexandra are both really funny and biting and creative in their comedic style. That jammed up with Antonio Gerardi [who plays Bignè], who has a very different kind of masculine wit. It was a really cool harmony of characters, and I was consistently very pleasantly surprised on set at how they brought things to life.</p>\n<p>\n\t<em>This interview has been edited and condensed for clarity.</em></p>\n<div>\n<figure>\n<p><img srcset=\"https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Hotel-Costiera.jpg 1000w, https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Hotel-Costiera.jpg?resize=150,102 150w, https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Hotel-Costiera.jpg?resize=300,203 300w\" src=\"https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Hotel-Costiera.jpg\" alt=\"\" />\n\t</p>\n<figcaption>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tPrime Video\n\t</figcaption>\n</figure>\n</div>\n</div>"

    "body": "<div><p>\n\tTom Hanks, Jennifer Aniston,  Meryl Streep, Jamie Lee Curtis, Jason Bateman and Martin Short are among the members of the Hollywood community  who have signed an open letter with the American Civil Liberties Union protesting <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/2025/tv/news/nexstar-jimmy-kimmel-abc-charlie-kirk-1236522584/\">Disney’s decision to pull late-night host Jimmy Kimmel’s show</a> off of its shedule and warning of its ramifications on Americans’ right to speak freely.</p>\n<p>\n\tThe letter says  that efforts to pressure artists, journalists, and others with retaliation for their speech “strike at the heart of what it means to live in a free country” and closes by calling on all Americans to defend the right to speak freely.\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\t“We now find ourselves in a modern McCarthy era, facing exactly the type of heavy-handed government censorship our Constitution rightfully forbids. The silencing of Jimmy Kimmel and jawboning of media outlets through lawsuits and threats to their licenses evoke dark memories of the 1950s,” said Anthony D. Romero, executive director of the American Civil Liberties Union, which organized the letter, in a prepared statement. “We must remember, however, that Senator McCarthy was ultimately disgraced and neutralized once Americans mobilized and stood up to him. We must do the same today because, together, our voices are louder and, together, we will fight to be heard.”</p>\n<p>\n\tThe list of signatories also includes Ariana DeBose, Jane Fonda, Maggie Gyllenhaal, Regina King, Julia Louis-Dreyfus, Diego Luna, Lin-Manuel Miranda and Natalie Portman, among others.</p>\n<p>\n\tDisney said last week Disney’s <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/abc/\">ABC</a> that ot would take<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/jimmy-kimmel/\"> Kimmel</a>‘s popular late-night show off its schedule “indefinitely” after one of the biggest owners of TV stations in the U.S., <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/nexstar/\">Nexstar</a> Media, said it intended to pre-empt airings of the program following remarks the host made about the killing of conservative activist <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/charlie-kirk/\">Charlie Kirk</a>. Nexstar said Wednesday that it “strongly objects” to Kimmel’s comments, made during last Monday’s broadcast of his program. Sinclair, another large station owner, has said it also intends to keep Kimmel’s program off of its stations. \n\t</p>\n<p>\n\tThe list includes some actors whose work is distributed by Disney. Martin Short, for example, is a star of the Hulu series “Only Murders in the Building,” in which Meryl Streep has a recurring role. Both Florence Pugh and Julia Louis-Dreyfus starred in the recent Marvel release “Thunderbolts,” has also signed the letter. Jamie Lee Curtis has a prominent recurring role in the FX series, “The Bear.” Kathryn Hahn recently starred in the Marvel streaming series “Agatha All Along.”</p>\n</div>"

Stern joins a growing list of celebrities who have made their Disney+ cancellations public in the days since Kimmel was taken off air, from Cynthia Nixon to Noah Centineo.</p>\n<p>\n\t“As you know, ABC threw Jimmy [Kimmel] off the air,” Stern said. “I don’t know what their plan is, but it looks like they might be firing him. And then I read sometimes that they’re not gonna fire him. I don’t know. I have spoken to Jimmy. I didn’t ask him these questions, I just asked him how he was doing personally. I just know when the government begins to interfere, when the government says, ‘I’m not pleased with you, so we’re gonna orchestrate a way to silence you,’ it’s the wrong direction for our country.”\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\t“I should know. I’ve been involved in something like this, and now ABC is put in the same position and it’s unfortunate that ABC even has to be in this position,” Stern continued. “They shouldn’t have to be in this position. I feel for them too, in this. But someone’s gotta step up and fucking say, ‘Hey, enough, we’re not gonna bow.’ Now it might sound stupid, but the thing I did this morning, I’m canceling my Disney+. I’m trying to say with the pocketbook that I do not support what they’re doing with Jimmy.”\n</p>\n<p>\n\tStern is one of several high-profile entertainments hosts who have condemned ABC and Disney for yanking Kimmel off the air. Stephen Colbert <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/2025/tv/news/stephen-colbert-rips-abc-pulling-kimmel-censorship-1236522765/\">called the decision </a>“blatant censorship” to appease Donald Trump, while Jimmy Fallon <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/2025/tv/news/jimmy-fallon-hopes-kimmel-returns-censored-trump-1236523814/\">expressed his desire</a> for Kimmel to return to air and vowed never to stop making Trump jokes even if there are fears it will get “The Tonight Show” censored.\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\tSimilar to Stern, John Oliver also <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/2025/tv/news/john-oliver-slams-jimmy-kimmel-suspension-disney-trump-1236525844/\">said that Disney</a> should not have bowed down to the FCC or the Trump administration. Oliver added: “If we’ve learned nothing else from this administration’s second term so far, and I don’t think we have, is that giving the bully your lunch money doesn’t make him go away. It just makes him come back hungrier each time… Look, at some point you’re going to have to draw a line. So I’d argue, why not draw it right here? And when they come to you with stupid ridiculous demands, picking fights that you know you could win in court instead of rolling over, why not stand up and use four key words they don’t tend to teach you in business school. Not ‘OK, you’re the boss.’ Not ‘Whatever you say goes.’ But instead, the only phrase that can genuinely make a weak bully go away. And that is, ‘Fuck you, make me.’”</p>\n<p>\n\tWatch Stern announce he is canceling his Disney+ subscription in the video below.</p>\n<figure></figure>\n</div>"

Sylvia’s influence is rooted in an understanding of music’s power to connect with people.</p><p> And as Chairwoman and CEO of our <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/epic-records/\">Epic Records</a>, she has shepherded No. 1 chart successes with 21 Savage, Future, Travis Scott, and Tyla among others.</p><p> It has been our honor to work with a true icon and our collective responsibility to continue to build on her work at Epic Records.</p><p> Thank you, Sylvia, for your leadership and inspiration.</p></em></p><p> In a related memo obtained by <em>Variety</em> that also serves as a history of her unique career, Rhone wrote: </p><p> <em>To My Sony Music Family,<p>           It’s been an extraordinary journey: eleven years since my promotion to President of Epic Records and six years since my appointment as Chairwoman and CEO. This role at Epic represents the third time in my career that I’ve been the first woman and first Black person to serve as CEO of a major record label owned by a Fortune 500 company.</p><p> And today, I am moving on from this historic role at Epic and I’m very excited about the future.</p><p> I’ve always been surrounded by excellent teams, but our current one at Epic is extraordinary. Spanning multiple generations, our team understands music’s history, finds meaning in complex data, and anticipates emerging trends. From Travis Scott, Future and 21 Savage, to Meghan Trainor, Tyla and Madison Beer, Zara Larsson to Giveon and Mariah The Scientist, Q-Tip to Andre 3000 and the late, great Ozzy Osbourne…Epic artists thrive through bespoke campaigns that honor their unique voices and goals. While helping artists maintain authentic fan connections, our team guides them through partnerships in video, fashion, gaming, and content innovation. We’re proud of leading Sony Music’s 2020 “Your Voice, Your Power, Your Vote” campaign and fostering a workplace culture that reflects our values: 62% women and 57% people of color. From day one, we set out to build something special at Epic — and we have.</p><p> This moment of my transition invites reflection on a journey that has been wide-ranging in its scope and impact.</p><p> Following my graduation from The Wharton School, I started as a secretary at Buddha Records and after working my way up through radio promotions, I was privileged to be appointed SVP of Black Music at Atlantic Records.  Those times feel like yesterday, working with Roberta Flack, Donnie Hathaway, En Vogue, LeVert, Brandy, Adina Howard, Troop, DAS EFX, Snow, MC Lyte, Kwamé, Miki Howard, Gerald Albright, The System and Ice Cube’s Lynch Mob and Yo-Yo.  Through our Ruthless Records deal, we also released The D.O.C., JJ Fad, Michel’le, and Easy-E.</p><p> In July 1994, I was appointed Chairwoman of Elektra Records, where we orchestrated a cultural renaissance that still resonates today. There, we became guardians of musical diversity, nurturing the power of AC/DC and Metallica alongside the genius of Missy Elliott and Busta Rhymes. From Pantera’s intensity to Phish’s improvisational spirit, from Tracy Chapman’s truths and Anita Baker’s soul to Tamia’s powerful vocals — each artist flourished on their own frequency. Third Eye Blind, Yolanda Adams, Silk, Ol’ Dirty Bastard, Gerald LeVert, Keith Sweat, Natalie Merchant, The Cure, Björk, Staind, Better Than Ezra, The Afghan Whigs, and Jason Mraz all found their home in our musical family, creating moments that transcended mere entertainment.</p><p> Then came my chapter at Motown, where the label’s iconic history and its future converged under my leadership as Chairwoman and CEO. It was an honor to record Stevie Wonder’s last full-length studio album while simultaneously collaborating with artists like Nelly, Erykah Badu, Kid Cudi, and Akon. We also extended hip-hop’s global reach by distributing Cash Money Records’ roster — elevating Baby, Lil Wayne, Nicki Minaj, and Drake.</p><p> I am blessed to have worked with some of the most brilliant and influential artists in the history of recorded music. And I’ve discovered this: when we channel our strength and creativity in service of a vision, and collaborate with artists who do the same, we create music that reflects our world, questions our assumptions, and uplifts our spirits. This is a kind of magic, a deeply human connection. Right now, when music’s DNA is being reimagined, when artists face existential challenges, and when all of us are building the future in real time, there is little that is more profound.</p><p> Looking back on my Epic era fills me with great pride. To my team of creative champions, you now hold the reins, and I know your best work lies ahead. I’m grateful for Zeke Lewis, Rick Sackheim, Sandra Aflorei, Tyler Pittman, John Shoup, Dave Bell, Lisa Kasha, Shannon Mingal, Margeaux Watson, Justin Duran, Chelsea Donnarumma, Brooke Marcimo, Mez Tara, Gina Harrell, Melissa Victor, Traci Adams, Scott Dimig, Dontay Thompson, Jennifer Goicoechea, Patrick Afeku, John Kirkpatrick, Michael Petullo, Max Sholl, Hector Rosario and the countless other executives who made Epic Records home.</p><p> I thank my daughter Quinn for her unconditional love and my late parents Marie and Bob Rhone for their heroic support. And I am forever grateful for my prior teammates from over the years. Not only did we work great music, but we also created an amazing network of advocacy and goodwill! Thanks to Rob Stringer for his trust and camaraderie and to Doug Morris for empowering me to shatter the glass ceiling.</p><p> I have worked in our industry since vinyl ruled, and women were rarely if ever in line for C-level or even vice-presidential roles. I am proud of my achievements, and of my commitment to those who take inspiration from them. The many individual honors I’ve received — from Billboard, Fortune Magazine’s Most Powerful Women, Essence, Variety, Ms. Magazine’s Woman of the Year, and the recent honorary doctorate from Berklee College of Music — serve as grace notes on my years of dedication. But they pale beside what we’ve all built together. They pale beside the glory of our musical culture.</p><p> Onward and upward,</p><p> Sylvia</p></em></p></div>"
