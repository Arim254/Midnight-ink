The production is set to reach cinemas worldwide from Nov. 27, presented by Neal Street Productions, Playful Productions and National Theatre of Scotland in association with Nica Burns.\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\tIreland’s play, from the writer behind “Ulster American,” follows the twelve-step journey of Alcoholics Anonymous, and centers on two men: James (Freeman), a long-time member of the program who agrees to mentor newcomer Luka (Lowden). Over cups of black coffee, the pair forge a fragile bond through shared experiences. But as Luka approaches the critical fifth step of the program, which demands complete honesty, both men must confront dangerous secrets from their past – revelations that could either strengthen their recovery or send them spiraling back toward addiction.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tThe production was filmed live during its sold-out London West End run at the intimate, in-the-round @sohoplace theatre. Directed by Finn den Hertog, the play originally premiered in Dundee, Edinburgh and Glasgow in 2024 through National Theatre of Scotland before its successful London transfer.</p>\n<p>\n\tLowden originated the role of Luka at the 2024 Edinburgh International Festival under the National Theatre of Scotland banner. </p>\n<p>\n\tThe project marks another high-profile addition to National Theatre Live’s roster of theatrical broadcasts, including <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/2025/theater/news/rosamund-pike-national-theatre-inter-alia-cinema-release-1236347200/\">“Inter Alia,” starring Rosamund Pike. </a>\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\tWatch the trailer for “The Fifth Step” here: </p>\n<figure><p>\n<iframe width=\"500\" height=\"281\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/WLV4Ho-eCTo?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\"></iframe>\n</p></figure>\n</div>"

    "body": "<div><p>\n\tThe <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/spain-film-commission/\">Spain Film Commission</a> has unveiled a bold new initiative aimed at converting iconic filming locations across Spain into innovative and sustainable tourism experiences. The project, developed under the “Experiencias” Program and supported by the Ministry of Industry and Tourism – State Secretariat for Tourism (SETUR), is part of the broader Spain Screen Grand Tour and benefits from European Union Next Generation funding.</p>\n<p>\n\tThe presentation, held at the ongoing San Sebastián International Film Festival ,had Juan Manuel Guimeráns, president of Spain Film Commission, outlining the project’s objectives and the work carried out over recent months. “We’ve created a clear, standardized framework, recognized by both the tourism and audiovisual sectors, that can be implemented across Spain,” he explained.\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\tGuimeráns also highlighted the critical role of public-private collaboration in delivering ambitious, cross-sector projects like this one. “Spain is home to one of the world’s leading tourism industries and a globally competitive audiovisual sector. Bringing these two forces together was a natural step toward redefining how audiences experience our country,” he added.\n</p>\n<p>\n\t<strong>Pilot programs across diverse regions</strong></p>\n<p>\n\tTo develop and validate the methodology, four pilot programs were conducted in strategically chosen locations, each representing a different type of destination:</p>\n<div>\n<ul>\n<li>Formentera (Balearic Islands) – coastal</li>\n<li>Seville (Andalusia) – urban</li>\n<li>Galicia – rural coastal</li>\n<li>Burgos (Castile and León) – natural landscape</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n<p>\n\tThese pilots brought together local tourism professionals, public institutions and audiovisual industry players to co-create screen tourism products inspired by well-known film and TV productions.</p>\n<p>\n\tIn Formentera, the program focused on <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/julio-medem/\">Julio Medem</a>’s “Sex and Lucía,” encouraging off-season travel and offering immersive experiences tied to the film’s narrative and scenery. In Burgos, the legendary film “The Good, the Bad and the Ugly” served as the foundation for tourism experiences centered on the film’s legacy in the region. Galicia drew from the popular Bambú Producciones TV series “<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/farina/\">Fariña</a>,” based on the book by journalist Nacho Carretero. Meanwhile, Seville explored the unique opportunity of designing tourism experiences around a project still in production, demonstrating the potential for pre-release engagement.\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\tIñaki Gaztelumendi, the screen tourism expert leading the initiative, presented the new methodology during the event. All project materials and toolkits are now publicly available on the Spain Film Commission website, enabling other regions to adopt and adapt the model for local implementation.</p>\n<p>\n\t<strong>Widespread collaboration across sectors and territories</strong></p>\n<p>\n\tThe project was made possible through the collaboration of numerous partners across the public and private sectors. Spain Film Commission worked closely with TBS (Tech Brands Stories), Telefónica’s creative production agency, communication consultancy Thinking Heads and tourism consultancy Verne.</p>\n<p>\n\tInstitutional support came from a broad network of regional and local stakeholders including the film commissions of Burgos, Galicia, Balearic Islands and Seville Film & Events, the official film office of the Seville City Council.</p>\n<p>\n\tEach workshop emphasized cross-sector participation, bringing together technical experts, local authorities, hospitality professionals, and cultural organizations to ensure a comprehensive, locally grounded approach.</p>\n<p>\n\t<strong>From viewer to protagonist</strong></p>\n<p>\n\tA key moment during the event was the roundtable discussion titled “From Viewer to Protagonist,” which explored the intersection of storytelling, place-making and tourism through the lens of industry professionals.</p>\n<p>\n\tThe panel featured Esperanza Ibáñez, Director of Public Policy at Netflix for Spain and Portugal; Raúl Izquierdo, Director of TBS at Telefónica Group; Medem; Raquel Puente, coordinator of the Burgos Film Commission, and Carretero, author of “Fariña.”</p>\n<p>\n\t“At Netflix, we see first-hand how stories transcend borders. A single series can put a previously unknown town on the map. Supporting projects like the ‘Experiencias’ Program means believing in culture as a powerful engine for local economic development,” said Ibáñez.</p>\n<p>\n\tIzquierdo, who oversaw the production of the project’s audiovisual materials, stressed the need to raise awareness of these kinds of initiatives both nationally and internationally. “It was important for us to go beyond traditional production models and create something that truly reflects the value of these experiences,” he noted.\n\t</p>\n</div>"

    "body": "<div><p>\n\tTwo Indian entertainment companies are teaming up to tackle one of the industry’s most persistent challenges: creating viable theatrical pathways for independent films in a market dominated by big-budget studio releases.</p>\n<p>\n\t<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/first-ray-films/\">First Ray Films</a> and Max Marketing have launched a strategic partnership this week designed to develop more targeted distribution and marketing strategies for small and mid-budget productions, addressing what they see as systemic inequities in how films are promoted and released regardless of their actual budgets.\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\tThe collaboration pairs First Ray Films’ production expertise with Max Marketing’s extensive campaign experience. First Ray has a perfect batting average so far, with all three of its independently produced films recouping their production investments. The company has <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/2025/film/news/india-first-ray-films-slate-1236519145/\">six additional projects in development</a>, including three theatrical releases scheduled for the next six months totalling $2.5 million in combined budgets.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tMax Marketing brings significant industry credentials to the partnership, having managed campaigns for major hits across different budget ranges, from “Yeh Jawaani Hai Deewani” and “Animal” to “<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/rrr/\">RRR</a>,” “HanuMan,” “Tumbbad,” and “Merry Christmas” over its 15-year track record.</p>\n<p>\n\tThe companies argue that current industry practices create inherent disadvantages for smaller productions, as marketing costs and distribution expenses remain constant whether a film costs INR4 crore ($450,000) or INR400 crore ($4.5 million) to produce.</p>\n<p>\n\tTheir first joint venture, “<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/lord-curzon-ki-haveli/\">Lord Curzon Ki Haveli</a>,” will test a more surgical approach focused on precise audience targeting and budget-appropriate promotional strategies rather than pursuing widespread theatrical footprints or mass-market campaigns.\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\t“Films never fail, budgets fail. And a producer isn’t a financier, producers make and mount films,” said <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/anshuman-jha/\">Anshuman Jha</a>, founder of First Ray Films. “Independent films have always carried the fire of honest storytelling — what they often lack is the marketing muscle to cut through the noise. With Varun and Max Marketing, we aim to create an ecosystem that gives good & well mounted non-studio films the same theatrical fighting chance as big-budget cinema.”</p>\n<p>\n\tJha noted his decade-long professional relationship with Max Marketing’s founder, Varun Gupta, tracing back to his 2016 debut production “Mona_Darling.” “This partnership isn’t just business, it’s belief. And I’m excited to change the game together with our slate of three releases because we aren’t afraid to fail.”</p>\n<p>\n\tVarun Gupta, founder of Max Marketing Limited, praised Jha’s entrepreneurial approach to filmmaking: “We’ve always believed that a good story is bigger than its budget. In addition to being an incredible actor, Anshuman is one of the rare artists in the industry with the drive, passion and vision to build a production house from scratch — and sustain it successfully for a decade.”</p>\n<p>\n\t“Together, we’re not just marketing films — we’re creating the future of independent theatrical cinema in India,” Gupta added.</p>\n<div><p>\n\tThe partnership will undergo a six-month trial period across three theatrical releases. Success could establish a replicable framework for other independent producers and distributors seeking alternatives to traditional marketing models that favor high-budget productions.</p></div>\n</div>"

    "body": "<div><p>\n\tCopenhagen-based <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/monolit-film/\">Monolit Film</a>, the production outfit behind Katrine Brocks’ 2022 San Sebastian premiere “The Great Silence” and “Bad Bitch” director Patricia Bbaale Bandak’s forthcoming feature debut “Wannabe,” continues to grow its slate with a pair of new films from emerging Danish directors Christian Bengtson and Mads Mengel.  </p>\n<p>\n\tMonolit producer and co-founder Victor Cunha announced that his company is prepping “The Migrants,” Bengtson’s follow-up to his 2022 drama “Chrysanthemum,” and is in post-production on Mengel’s debut feature, “The Guest.” Mengel, who’s best known for his work behind the camera on the Danish miniseries “My Different Ways” and “Suplex,” will be presenting his work in progress at <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/finnish-film-affair/\">Finnish Film Affair</a>, the annual industry event running parallel to the Helsinki Intl. Film Festival – Love & Anarchy, which takes place Sept. 24 – 26.\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\t“The Guest” unfolds over the course of a weekend at a seaside hotel, where new parents Karl and Emilie have invited friends and family to celebrate their son’s naming party. Their hopes for an intimate gathering, however, are dashed with the unexpected arrival of Karl’s estranged mother, Vibeke, who is intent on rejoining the family and proving herself as a grandmother.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tBefore long, tensions rise, old patterns resurface, and long-buried family dynamics reemerge. What begins as a celebration slowly unravels into a confrontation with the past, in what the filmmakers describe as “a sharply observed drama about roles we inherit, the people we try to become and the impossibility of ever fully escaping where we come from.”\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\tSpeaking to <em>Variety</em> ahead of Finnish Film Affair, Mengel — who co-wrote the script with Christian Bengtson — said he “wanted to make a film about family dynamics and dysfunctional families.” “On a deeper level, I wanted to make a film about forgiveness and letting go of the past,” he added.</p>\n<p>\n\tThe director noted that “The Guest” has been “a long way coming,” and was initially conceived when he and producer Victor Cunha first bandied about the concept as students in film school. The years since have not only brought professional success for both men, but fatherhood, an experience that helped inform Mengel’s approach to his subject matter.</p>\n<p>\n\t“I realized if I didn’t let go of the grudges and the pain I bore with me from my childhood, I would be forced to repeat the pattern in some way,” he said. “I also realized how difficult it is to be a parent. And I realized my parents were just people themselves when they had me.”</p>\n<p>\n\tAlso upcoming on Monolit’s slate is writer-director Bengtson’s follow-up to his 2022 drama “Chrysanthemum.” Co-written with Nikolaj Arcel, “The Migrants” follows the change in fortunes for a sheep-farming family when the wolf returns to the Danish countryside two centuries after its disappearance, dividing a close-knit community in what the filmmakers describe as “a mythical tale of the struggle between humans and animals for survival.”</p>\n<p>\n\tIn a director’s statement, Bengtson described the real-life fallout in his rural hometown of Thy when, in 2012, a wolf appeared for the first time in 200 years, sparking what he called “a long-standing, highly sensitive conflict that starkly divides rural and urban communities.”</p>\n<p>\n\t“For me, the conflict is not really about the wolf itself, but about what the wolf represents. It ignites powerful, accumulated emotions among the working class — people who, for years, have not been heard,” he said. “The conflict is straightforward, but the setting reveals glimpses of a country and a working-class underbelly that has long been hit by urbanization, reforms and centralization — forces I have witnessed in my own upbringing and seen play out in my family. </p>\n<p>\n\t“‘The Migrants’ will look at people living on the margins of our country, working in professions that are vanishing or under threat in a rapidly changing world,” Bengtson added.\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\t“The Guest” and “The Migrants” mark the latest ventures for the rising production outfit Monolit, which Cunha co-founded with Pernille Tornøe and Emily Nicoline Quist in 2019. The company is developing Bbaale Bandak’s eagerly anticipated “Wannabe,” a ’90s-set film about four girls who get together to form a group when a national TV show announces a music video competition. The director’s groundbreaking TV series, “Bad Bitch,” was the first Danish show boasting an ensemble cast of Black actors. Also in early development is “After the Sun,” the feature adaptation of Jonas Eika’s debut collection of stories, which will be directed by Danish Iranian filmmaker Ánitá Beikpour.</p>\n<p>\n\t“At Monolit, we champion filmmakers with a personal point of view; stories rooted in specificity that open up to something universal,” said Cunha. “‘The Guest’ examines the fragile bonds of family as a son faces his estranged mother, while ‘The Migrants’ portrays a community grappling with change and survival in the wake of political decisions. Different in scope, both films reflect our drive for intimate, character-driven cinema that feels both urgent and timeless.”</p>\n</div>"

    "body": "<div><p>\n\t<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/jimmy-kimmel/\">Jimmy Kimmel</a> never thought he’d be here. But Kimmel has the skill to rise to this moment, at a jarring time in this country’s history as freedoms are under attack and democracy hangs on just by a thread.</p>\n<p>\n\tOn Tuesday’s return of “<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/jimmy-kimmel-live-2/\">Jimmy Kimmel Live!</a>” we were reminded of that. Kimmel struck the perfect tone, acknowledging the gravity of what had just happened, telling his audience that both sides of the aisle should cherish and celebrate free speech — and then not pulling any punches in joking about what Donald Trump has been up to over the last few days. Political satire has been a late night staple since the dawn of the entire genre, and Kimmel was going to make sure it isn’t going anywhere.\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\t“You had the feeling that this was an important moment,” said one audience member who attended the Tuesday taping. “It felt very cathartic, like, not everything is lost.” It was a good reminder that part of the promise of America has being able to speak without fear of government intimidation.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tWe all love Jimmy, but he never asked to be drafted to be the protector of the First Amendment and free speech in this nation. He’s a late night talk show host, not an activist. A comedian whose job is to simply poke fun at our nation’s elected leaders.</p>\n<p>\n\t“This show is not important, what is important is we get to live in a country that allows us to have a show like this,” Kimmel said.</p>\n<p>\n\tBut these days, just pointing out our government’s foibles makes you an enemy of the state. Kimmel found that out last week, but he’s not the only one. President Trump is still celebrating the impending disappearance of “The Late Show With Stephen Colbert.” And he promises that Jimmy Fallon and Seth Meyers are next. Trump has the power of the FCC, the DOJ and other agencies ready to do his bidding — and last week, the administration came very close to getting what it wanted: The silence of one of the few prominent voices still poking fun at the madness coming out of Washington.\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\tLet that sink in for a second: Talk show hosts — comedians whose main job is to crack audiences up and help a rotating cast of guests promote their latest projects — are so embedded in the craw of Trump that he’s demanding his agencies find a way to shut them up.</p>\n<p>\n\t“I just want to say how alarming it is to feel like late night is important,” “Jimmy Kimmel Live!” writer Louis Virtel said this week on his podcast. “Nobody takes this job thinking, ‘and you know why I decided to make jokes about, whatever, Melania Trump today? To make a difference.” On the one hand, Trump loves to bash the hosts as being low-rated no-talents — yet “he’s the one who is constantly bringing up every day how important these people’s speech is.”</p>\n<p>\n\tLike many Angelenos, I’m old enough to remember when Kimmel was “Jimmy the Sports Guy” on KROQ’s “Kevin & Bean,” and waiting in line for the annual Christmas cassette that he helped produce. Trust me, “Jimmy the Sports Guy” wasn’t planning on becoming the national lightning rod for free speech — he started off his career by just wanting to be entertaining on the radio.</p>\n<p>\n\tBut Kimmel’s tenacity and talent was always there, even when he was loitering at stations in Phoenix and Los Angeles, waiting for his big break. After he made his way onto “Kevin & Bean” — famously, the morning show hosts had no idea their program director had even hired him — he quickly found success as the sidekick on “Win Ben Stein’s Money,” as comic relief on “Fox Sports Sunday” and then as one-half of “The Man Show” with Adam Corolla.</p>\n<p>\n\tStill, it was a leap in 2002 when then-ABC Entertainment chairman Lloyd Braun somehow convinced Disney to hire Kimmel and launch an entirely new late night franchise. It was rough going at first, as the show struggled to book guests and wasn’t cleared in several major markets. But Kimmel grew into the role — and as social media came of age and video-sharing websites like YouTube launched, “Jimmy Kimmel Live” was at the front of the pack creating viral moments and turning the show into must-share TV.</p>\n<p>\n\tKimmel was always personal on air — his family and friends were part of the show from the beginning, including the late Uncle Frank, Aunt Chippy, Cousin Sal and best friend-turned-band leader Cleto Escobedo Jr. Over the years, that meant sharing the story of his son Billy’s heart condition — and why he believed everyone deserves proper health care. As the nation faced tragedies like school shootings, Kimmel was open and honest with how tragic the news was — and how frustrating that there seemed to be no attempts to enact sensible ways to stop gun violence. \n\t</p>\n<p>\n\tOften Kimmel would deliver those monologues with real tears in his eyes — which made him a further target of “f— your feelings” right wingers. That included Tuesday’s episode, where he noted how Charlie Kirk’s widow Erika “forgave the man who shot her husband. She forgave him. That is an example we should follow. If you believe in the teachings of Jesus, as I do, that’s it a selfless act of grace forgiveness from a grieving widow. It touched me deeply, and if there’s anything we should take from this tragedy to carry forward I hope it can be that.”</p>\n<p>\n\tBut first and foremost, Kimmel is about the comedy. Always has been. The long-running gags like his “feud” with Matt Damon. The practical jokes such as the ones he pulls on family members and celebs like John Krasinski. And as much as Trump doesn’t like it, Kimmel is simply finding ways to still laugh through all the darkness gripping our country.</p>\n<p>\n\tWhen I last spoke to Kimmel in July, I shared optimistically that even as we see some of our rights stripped away, the one thing they hopefully can’t take away from us is our joy. And he pointed out that there were still plenty of things to have fun with even inside the Trump White House: “Today we learned that Trump’s nickname for Stephen Miller is ‘Weird Stephen,’” he told me that day. “Now, whether you like Trump or not, that’s a funny nickname to give a person. You must give credit where credit is due. So, a lot of horrible things are happening, but there are also some funny things happening. And I don’t know if it’s to keep us off balance or just how it goes with an inconsistent person, but I am able to find the humor in all this.”</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd not only is Kimmel still all about making us laugh, but he continues to share his reverence for the craft of comedy. That’s why he adores icons like David Letterman, Howard Stern and the late Norman Lear, all of whom he’s had the chance to honor on his show.</p>\n<p>\n\tOn Tuesday, Kimmel posted a photo of himself with Lear (with whom he produced the series of specials “Live in Front of a Studio Audience”) along with the caption, “Missing this guy today.” Lear was a true hero — a WWII vet who fought fascism, then came home and built a career making America laugh while also tackling some of the most important issues of our time. Lear adored Kimmel, and he would have loved seeing the host back on his TV screen tonight.\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\tJimmy Kimmel didn’t think he’d be here. But I’m glad he still is.</p>\n</div>"

I found out about a young woman, Belén, who had been imprisoned for having a miscarriage. When I went to receive an award, I brought out a sign that said ‘Freedom for Belén’ and I spoke about it during the ceremony. It made it into the international press and caused a global stir,” she recalls.\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\tAccording to Fonzi, that night at the awards, a film producer began asking about Belén’s case.  Not long after, this same producer bought the rights to a recent book about Belén’s story and commissioned a screenplay, with Fonzi already in mind to play the lawyer.</p>\n<p>\n\tThis producer turned out to be Leticia Cristi of K & S Films. “Leticia came to me and offered me the chance to also direct and write the film. And I couldn’t say no — it was a project that felt tailor-made for me. I had already been following Belén’s case for a long time, so everything fell into place organically. It wasn’t a story I chose to tell — it was brought to me. But then I rewrote it, acted in it and directed it.”</p>\n<p>\n\t“So, yes, it was a commissioned film. But at the same time, it felt so much like mine from the start that it feels deeply personal,” she adds.</p>\n<p>\n\tThis will be Fonzi’s second time at San Sebastián with a film she directed. Her directorial feature debut, “Blondi,” produced by <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/santiago-mitre/\">Santiago Mitre</a> and Agustina Llambi Campbell’s  La Unión de los Rios, also had its world premiere at the fest, which coincidentally opens this year with another film produced by La Unión, Daniel Hendler’s “<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/27-nights/\">27 Nights</a>.” They both vie for San Sebastian’s top honor, the Golden Shell.</p>\n<p>\n\t“San Sebastián is a festival that’s been very much in tune with Latin American issues. They’re engaged and genuinely interested. Jose Luis Rebordinos, the festival director, has been a major supporter of Argentine cinema in general. At San Sebastián, we’ve always been able to create moments that bring visibility to the struggles we’re facing,” she notes.</p>\n<p>\n\tAsked how she handled directing herself, Fonzi responds: “I have a team that supports me, and I have a friend, Ezequiel Díaz, who is like my voice and eyes on set. He was with me on ‘Blondi’ and also on ‘Belén.’ So, apart from having an excellent team, I rely on his watchful support; I deeply value his opinion.”</p>\n<p>\n\tMeanwhile, Fonzi has been working non-stop as an actor. “I haven’t had a single day off in two years. I made a film in Italy, then rewrote a script, then went to Chile to work on ‘The House of the Spirits,’ came back and made this film, then went back to Chile again — and I just returned. Next year, I’d like to take some time off to write and work on smaller projects.”\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\t“Belén” world premieres at the festival on Sept. 23. San Sebastian kicked off on Sept. 19 and wraps on Sept. 27. </p>\n</div>"

Instead, De Niro pretended to be the new mafioso FCC chairman who was tearing down free speech on behalf of Trump.\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\t“So you tell Whoopi over there, she better show a little respect, or the only view she’s getting is from under George Washington. The bridge, not the guy,” De Niro began. He was referring to “The View” host Whoopi Goldberg, whose fellow ABC talk show stayed silent over Kimmel’s suspension last week and finally addressed the controversy on Monday. After yanking Kimmel off the air, Carr then threatened “The View” last week.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tWhen Kimmel asked if he was threatening Goldberg, De Niro replied, “I would never threaten Miss Goldstein. I was just teaching a lesson about consequences.”</p>\n<p>\n\tKimmel followed that up by saying, “Pardon me for saying, and maybe you’re the wrong guy to talk to, but it seems like the FCC is using mob tactics to suppress free speech.” He also reminded the supposed chairman that the FCC will fine the show for swearing on air.</p>\n<p>\n\tDe Niro then went on an expletive-ridden rampage, saying “What the fuck did you just say to me? I am the fucking FCC. I can fucking say whatever the fuck I want. Look. It’s just me, Jimmy, the chairman of the FCC, gently suggesting that you gently shut the fuck up.”\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\t“Speech, it ain’t free no more. We’re charging by the word now,” he added. When Kimmel asked how much he’s charging, De Niro explained: “Depends on what you want to say. Like if you want to say something nice about the president’s beautiful, thick, yellow hair or how he can do his makeup better than any broad, that’s free. But if you want to do a joke like he’s so fat he needs two seats on the Epstein jet, that’s gonna cost you.”</p>\n<p>\n\tWatch the full video below.</p>\n<figure><p>\n<iframe width=\"500\" height=\"281\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/c1tjh_ZO_tY?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\"></iframe>\n</p></figure>\n</div>"

    "body": "<div><p>\n\tSpanish powerhouse producer <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/atresmedia-cine/\">Atresmedia Cine</a> kicked of celebrations for its 25<sup>th</sup> anniversary at the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/san-sebastian-film-festival/\">San Sebastian Film Festival</a> where it presented its upcoming slate.</p>\n<p>\n\tAtresmedia Cine general director Jaime Ortiz de Artiñano led the presentation and a round of toasts where he was joined by some of the actors and filmmakers that have worked on Atresmedia Cine’s multiple films. He also broke the news that Atresmedia Cine would be participating in box office king <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/santiago-segura/\">Santiago Segura</a>‘s upcoming films over the next four years, renewing the collaboration they’ve had on movies like the “Padre no hay más que uno” franchise. Segura’s Bowfinger International Pictures is behind some of the biggest box office hits in Spain.\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\tSince it was founded in November 2000, Atresmedia Cine has set out to support and invigorate Spanish cinema by pairing its broadcast rights acquisition power with robust marketing and communications strategies. Since then, it has been involved in over 180 feature films, becoming one of Spain’s most active and relevant producers.\n</p>\n<p>\n\t<strong>Key Highlights:</strong></p>\n<div>\n<ul>\n<li>Over $591 m (€500 million) invested up to 2024, generating more than 30,000 direct and indirect jobs and helping to consolidate Spain’s film industry.</li>\n<li>A commitment to cultural diversity: films shot across all Spanish autonomous communities and in all official regional languages (Basque, Galician, Catalan, Valencian).</li>\n<li>Strong support for theatrical cinema: all productions aim for the big screen, covering genres that engage, entertain and connect with audiences.</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n<p>\n\t<strong>Box Office & Critical Success:</strong></p>\n<div>\n<ul>\n<li>Atresmedia Cine has produced numerous Spanish box‑office hits, many exceeding $11.8 m (10 million euros) in earnings.</li>\n<li>Notable pics such as “Padre no hay más que uno,” “Undercover”and“Buffalo Kids” have dominated recent releases, with Segura’s “Torrente 3” doing exceptionally well.</li>\n<li>Institutional recognition: up to 50 Goya Awards and other major Spanish film awards, and frequent presence at national and international festivals.</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n<p>\n\t<strong>Recent Performance:</strong>\n\t</p>\n<div>\n<ul>\n<li>In 2024, its best in eight years, Atresmedia Cine’s box office earnings surpassed $47.4 million (40 million Euros), grabbing a market share of Spanish cinema in excess of 50%.</li>\n<li>In the first half of 2025, its films have captured more than a 40% share of the local film market.</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n<p>\n\t<em>Variety </em>spoke to Atresmedia Cine’s Ortiz de Artiñano in the run-up to the company’s slate presentation at the Hotel Maria Cristina:</p>\n<p>\n\t<strong>How has Atresmedia Cine’s strategic vision evolved since its early days, and what will be its key focuses in the years ahead?</strong></p>\n<p>\n\tThe pandemic and the rise of streaming platforms have marked a turning point in the film industry. Before that shift, Atresmedia Cine focused primarily on commercial, mainstream productions — largely driven by high-concept films, in the Hollywood sense. Titles like “La Tribu,”“Ahora o Nunca,”“Toc Toc” or “Villaviciosa de al lado” regularly drew over a million moviegoers</p>\n<p>\n\tSince the pandemic, the appeal of high-concept films in cinemas has declined — though they continue to perform well on streaming platforms. In contrast, more adult-oriented and auteur-driven cinema, which Atresmedia was already supporting with titles like “Marshland” (“La isla minima”) and “The Realm” (“El reino”), has not only held steady but even seen improved results. This shift became clear in 2021 with films like “Maixabel” and “The Good Boss” (“El buen patron”)<em> </em>topping the box office, followed by “The Beasts,”(“As bestas”) “A House on Fire” (“Casa en flames”)<em> </em>and “Undercover” (“La Infiltrada”).</p>\n<p>\n\tThe traditionally commercial model now endures mostly thanks to figures like Santiago Segura. Beyond that, family films and adult comedies have seen their audience numbers drop by half.</p>\n<p>\n\tIn response, Atresmedia Cine is doubling down on diversification, working closely with top-tier directors, screenwriters and producers to create a varied, high-quality slate. The goal is to offer something that stands out — and gets people off the couch and back into theaters.</p>\n<p>\n\tLooking ahead, we’re developing projects with talents like Segura, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/david-trueba/\">David Trueba</a>, Arantxa Echevarría, Mar Olid, Estel Díaz, Beatriz de Silva, Aritz Moreno, Marcel Barrena and Dani Castro — a diverse mix, all with one thing in common: quality.</p>\n<p>\n\t<strong>What role does Atresmedia Cine play in the internationalization of Spanish cinema? What strategies do you have in place to position your films at festivals, on global platforms, or in cinemas outside of Spain? Does the recent agreement with Disney+ represent a step in that direction?</strong>\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\tThe agreement with Disney+ currently applies only to television production. In terms of film, we love working with Disney, but we do so on a project-by-project basis, always with theatrical release in mind. We have two films set to premiere with them in 2026.</p>\n<p>\n\tAs for internationalization, it remains a major challenge for Spanish cinema. We’re in a delicate moment — Spanish films are finding it increasingly difficult to travel. Looking ahead, our strategy is to develop more ambitious productions that can reach international audiences and cross borders. “Karateka” is one such project, but there are others.</p>\n<p>\n\tThat said, the system needs to support this ambition. Making Spanish films with significant budgets is becoming harder — and that must change if we want to truly compete on a global level.</p>\n<p>\n\t<strong>How important are international co-productions and partnerships with platforms like Netflix, Prime Video or Disney+ in Atresmedia Cine’s current model?</strong></p>\n<p>\n\tInternational co-productions are a valuable tool — both for securing financing and for helping our films reach global audiences. Some of our upcoming releases reflect this strategy: “Siempre es invierno” by David Trueba was shot in Liège and “Karateka” was filmed in Japan with post-production in Belgium.</p>\n<p>\n\tHowever, recent regulatory changes have made ambitious international co-productions more difficult. The new General Audiovisual Communication Law only counts productions in Spanish or Spain’s co-official languages toward the investment quota. That makes it harder to co-produce with countries like France or Italy if there’s no reciprocity. A French producer won’t be incentivized to partner on a Spanish-language film if we can’t do the same with a French-language one.</p>\n<p>\n\tAs for the platforms, they play a key role in both financing and international reach. We’ve been working with Netflix for years, and thanks to that partnership, some of our films — “God’s Crooked Lines,”“Politically Incorrect,” “Mikaela” — have been seen around the world. We’ve also collaborated with other platforms. It’s clear they’re a fundamental part of the financing puzzle and an effective way to connect cinema with millions of viewers.</p>\n<p>\n\t<strong>Given the changing audiovisual consumption habits, how does Atresmedia Cine ensure the profitability of its productions? What role do cinemas play compared to digital platforms?</strong></p>\n<p>\n\tAt Atresmedia Cine, we’re involved from the earliest stages of development. We work closely on each project until it’s strong enough to take to market. Once we have a solid script and team, we begin assembling financing — bringing in pay-TV partners, international players, domestic distributors, free-to-air TV rights, public funding tools, sponsorships, etc.\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\tOnce all financing avenues are explored, we calculate the cost minus the secured investments. That determines the financial risk — what producers call the “gap.” That gap is what we aim to recover through box office revenue and any unsold rights.</p>\n<p>\n\tThe challenge today is that, with the current state of the box office and international market, taking on performance-based risk is increasingly difficult. That’s why it’s harder to greenlight ambitious budgets.</p>\n<p>\n\tWe take a project-by-project approach, carefully evaluating risk and maximizing all possible funding sources. Unfortunately, sometimes projects we’re passionate about don’t get greenlit because they’re financially unfeasible — but thanks to our team and track record, that rarely happens.</p>\n<p>\n\t<strong>Is Atresmedia Cine exploring new formats such as interactive cinema, augmented reality, or transmedia content? What role does innovation play in your future strategy?</strong></p>\n<p>\n\tIn my experience, the film industry has seen many so-called technological revolutions that ultimately didn’t stick. Aside from major milestones like Cinemascope or color, formats once thought to be game-changers — like 3D — have ended up being niche experiences.</p>\n<p>\n\tMost audiences still prefer to watch films traditionally: in a dark room, on a big screen, with immersive sound — albeit now with better projection, more comfortable seating and enhanced audio systems. Of course, we stay informed on innovation, but we don’t lose sight of what truly matters: telling great stories meant to be seen in theaters. Where we do focus on innovation is in production processes — anything that helps us do more with less, more efficiently and creatively.</p>\n<p>\n\t<strong>2026 Slate:</strong></p>\n<p>\n\t<strong>“Siempre es invierno,”</strong> <strong>David Trueba.</strong></p>\n<p>\n\tFollows Miguel, a landscape architect, who after a breakup in Belgium, begins to rebuild his life alongside Olga, a local volunteer.

It’s just two people talking – and falling in love,” Karukoski tells <em>Variety </em>in Helsinki. \n\t</p>\n<p>\n\t“This is an adult love story. They are in their 40s, discussing divorce, kids, sex and the sacrifices they’ve made. I’m 48 and that’s what struck me.”  \n</p>\n<p>\n\tIn “Hippo Love” – debuting exclusive first-look stills ahead of its bow at the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/finnish-film-affair/\">Finnish Film Affair</a> – two heartbroken strangers warm up to each other at a wedding party in Greece. Touko (Aku Sipola) is still technically married – Eevis (Pihla Viitala) is about to separate from her partner. But Touko’s wife, famous pop star, is also in attendance. </p>\n<p>\n\t“You are at a wedding, celebrating someone else’s ‘pure love,’ and you’re in the midst of your own divorce and your own pain. This juxtaposition felt super intriguing to me,” says Karukoski, excited to turn to a two-hander after “enormous productions.”</p>\n<p>\n\t“I think it’s a good timing for a film like that – also for me, personally. I’ve had three burnouts. I’m not in the top 10 of director’s burnouts, but I’m getting there.”\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\tHe adds: “When you’re inside the studio system, it can feel like the film is made by assistant directors. Everything is so huge – you’re just trying to survive the production and get everything done. It becomes all about the next car chase and the next explosion. With a smaller scale, it’s easier to forget your vanity and focus on art.”</p>\n<p>\n\tSipola and Viitala – joined by musician Jenni Vartiainen in her first role on screen – are “everything” in the film, produced by Marko Talli for Yellow Film & TV. “It’s about their small gestures, small moments. Then the story got bigger, more intriguing and human. But it’s still two people looking at each other.”</p>\n<p>\n\tViitala already voiced the audiobook version of Sjöholmin’s novel. “With Aku, we actually ended up chatting about kids and breakups after a party. He was much more sensitive than I’d have ever guessed. When I got the book, he was my first call. I said: ‘I think this is for you.’”</p>\n<p>\n\t“It’s about people engaging in conflict, engaging in love. It’s the kind of poetry that’s easily forgotten when you’re doing a large-scale production. Normally, when I’m looking at the rough cut, I’m thinking of several different ways of committing suicide. But this is a film that feels like a hug. I needed it.” </p>\n<p>\n\tAnd as for that title?</p>\n<p>\n\t“When hippos make love, they go underwater and the female kind of suffocates. In any strained marriage or partnership, you feel suffocation, so how do you find freedom and enjoyment within it? These two have hit an emotional wall. That’s life – it’s an ongoing journey of trying to find something that makes you feel emotions you’ve never felt before,” he observes. </p>\n<p>\n\t“We are always told: ‘You have to find your person.’ Then you’re supposed to be with that person for the rest of your life – and if you fail, you’re a failure. There’s something beautiful about learning to get over that disappointment and all these expectations others have for us. They are the ones keeping us underwater.” </p>\n<p>\n\tHe related to his characters, he says. </p>\n<p>\n\t“I wouldn’t say this film was like therapy, but it surely was therapeutical.” </p>\n<p>\n\tAlready developing a film in the U.K., set in the soccer world and centered around a small-time agent trying to survive it, Karukoski isn’t planning on leaving Finland anytime soon. Even despite <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/2025/film/global/finnish-industry-laments-government-cuts-1236522041/\">planned cuts to the culture budget</a>, which he has spoken out about. \n\t</p>\n<p>\n\t“I want to be close to my kids. My son is 11, my daughter is 6. I have maybe one or two good years with my son. Then I’ll be lucky if he answers my calls,” he laughs, admitting he’s also writing a story about fatherhood.</p>\n<p>\n\t“Tolkien grew up without a father – I met mine when I was 14. I always try to find something I can relate to. But this is the most personal thing I’ve ever written.” </p>\n<p>\n\t“We will see how it goes with all the cuts and the difficulties we’re facing now as an industry, but I was so relieved when Guillermo del Toro admitted he wrote 17 or so scripts that were never financed. 17?! At least I wrote less than that.”</p>\n<div>\n<figure>\n<p><img srcset=\"https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/MixCollage-24-Sep-2025-09-26-AM-4028.jpg 1500w, https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/MixCollage-24-Sep-2025-09-26-AM-4028.jpg?resize=150,84 150w, https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/MixCollage-24-Sep-2025-09-26-AM-4028.jpg?resize=300,169 300w, https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/MixCollage-24-Sep-2025-09-26-AM-4028.jpg?resize=125,70 125w, https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/MixCollage-24-Sep-2025-09-26-AM-4028.jpg?resize=1000,563 1000w, https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/MixCollage-24-Sep-2025-09-26-AM-4028.jpg?resize=910,511 910w, https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/MixCollage-24-Sep-2025-09-26-AM-4028.jpg?resize=681,383 681w, https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/MixCollage-24-Sep-2025-09-26-AM-4028.jpg?resize=450,253 450w, https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/MixCollage-24-Sep-2025-09-26-AM-4028.jpg?resize=250,140 250w\" src=\"https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/MixCollage-24-Sep-2025-09-26-AM-4028.jpg?w=1024\" alt=\"\" />\n\t</p>\n<figcaption>\n\t\t\t\t\t<span>“Hippo Love”</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tYellow Film / Antti Lahtinen\n\t</figcaption>\n</figure>\n</div>\n</div>"
