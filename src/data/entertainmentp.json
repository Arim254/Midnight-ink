    "body": "<div><p>\n\t<em><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/taylor-swift/\">Taylor Swift</a> is returning to a movie theater near you.</em></p>\n<p>\n\tThose are magical words to cinema operators, who all ostensibly became Swifties about two years ago. That’s when the pop star’s most recent theatrical venture, 2023’s wildly successful “Taylor Swift: The Eras Tour” concert film, set all kinds of box office benchmarks and provided a lifeline to multiplexes during the industry’s dual strikes.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tSwift is about to boost attendance again with October’s “The Official Release Party of a Showgirl.” It’s not a traditional film but rather an 89-minute event — packed with a music video and behind- the-scenes footage and commentary — tied to her 12th studio album, “The Life of a Showgirl.” (As with “The Eras Tour,” Swift says “dancing is optional but very much encouraged.”) Based on strong presales, “Showgirl” is <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/2025/film/box-office/taylor-swift-showgirl-projected-box-office-smashing-machine-1236534820/\">tracking a debut of $35 million to $40 million</a>. While not record breaking, those returns are huge for a release that wasn’t on anyone’s radar until a few weeks ago.\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\t“As soon as I saw her announcement I thought, ‘Clear the decks and make plenty of room.’ People come out for her like crazy,” says Penn Ketchum, owner of Pennsylvania-based Penn Cinema. “It’s a great way to get people to movie theaters who aren’t there regularly.”</p>\n<p>\n\tSwift’s film is the latest boon to movie theaters, which have benefited in recent months from several unlikely saviors. September was supposed to be <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/2025/film/box-office/weapons-hit-movie-theaters-bleak-box-office-1236492258/\">all doom and gloom</a>. Instead, Sony-owned Crunchyroll’s anime adventure “Demon Slayer: Infinity Castle” ($70 million debut) and the Warner Bros. sequel “The Conjuring: Last Rites” (a franchise-record $84 million debut) shattered projections and lifted the sluggish box office. Overall ticket sales for the month are roughly even with September 2024, which is better than expected.\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\tThose wins followed the surprise success of Netflix’s animated “KPop Demon Hunters,” which became the streamer’s most popular film ever before <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/2025/film/box-office/box-office-kpop-demon-hunters-leads-box-office-over-weapons-1236497070/\">topping the box office </a>with an estimated $18 million when a sing-along edition was released in theaters for two days at the end of August. That’s in addition to several summer-season sleeper hits, including Zach Cregger’s occult thriller “Weapons” ($263 million total), A24’s romantic drama “Materialists” ($103 million total) and “Final Destination: Bloodlines” (a series-best $313 million total).</p>\n<p>\n\t“I’m an optimist and always have been,” says Regal CEO Eduardo Acuna. “But these results put an exclamation point on my optimism. All of these are mid-budget movies that are supposed to be dead. But they are alive and kicking and performing better than anyone expected.”</p>\n<p>\n\tSo far, 2025 at the box office has been defined by the defiance of conventional wisdom. Original ideas or untested IP, such as Ryan Coogler’s vampire thriller “Sinners” and video game adaptation “A Minecraft Movie,” have been thriving while major franchises and sequels, from Marvel to “Mission: Impossible – The Final Reckoning” to “M3GAN 2.0,” <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/2025/film/box-office/box-office-2025-hits-misses-lilo-stitch-mission-impossible-sinners-1236438377/\">haven’t been reliable</a>.</p>\n<p>\n\t“When people talk about fatigue, I’ve always just said it’s mediocre movie fatigue,” says Peter Safran, DC Studios’ co-president and “Conjuring” producer. “If you deliver a film that’s unique and meaningful, people can’t wait to go to the theaters. It gives them a reason to get off their couch.”</p>\n<p>\n\tAudiences could stand to leave the sofa more often. Though the box office is 4% ahead of this time last year, that margin has been rapidly shrinking since the summer. By comparison, revenues in early June were 25% ahead of 2024, per Comscore.</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd while moviegoers have been embracing the unfamiliar, not everything new is breaking out. In March, Bong Joon Ho’s “Mickey 17” fizzled, while more recently, Universal’s “Him,” a sports thriller produced by Jordan Peele, and Sony’s “A Big Bold Beautiful Journey,” a sweeping romantic drama starring Margot Robbie and Colin Farrell, misfired. Disappointing grosses for “Him” and “A Big Bold Beautiful Journey” weren’t exactly a mystery; those films were saddled with terrible reviews.\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\tAcuna believes there’s another culprit to blame for low turnout. In a recent survey by Regal, audiences cited lack of awareness as their main reason for having skipped a particular film.</p>\n<p>\n\t“When they don’t work, it’s not necessarily because the movies are not great,” Acuna says. “It’s probably because people didn’t know these movies existed at all.”</p>\n</div>"

    "body": "<div><p>\n\tAhead of Amazon’s launch of “<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/fallout/\">Fallout</a>” Season 2 this December, the makers of the video game franchise that inspired the Prime Video drama have unveiled plans to incorporate <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/walton-goggins/\">Walton Goggins</a>‘ The Ghoul character and other aspects of the TV series into the ongoing “<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/fallout-76/\">Fallout 76</a>” video game.</p>\n<p>\n\tThe upcoming downloadable content (DLC) for the game is titled “Burning Springs,” and it was designed by Microsoft’s Bethesda Game Studios in partnership with the creative team behind Amazon’s “Fallout” adaptation. The game maker touts the update, which is “Fallout 76’s” 64th major DLC offering, as its most expansive addition to date.\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\tPer publisher Bethesda Softworks’ description for the new update, “‘Fallout 76: Burning Springs’ takes players to a new region in its largest update since 2020. In this free update for all ‘Fallout 76’ players, explore post-nuclear Ohio, meet new characters and factions, and take on all-new Bounty Hunting missions hosted by Walton Goggins as The Ghoul, featured from Prime Video’s ‘Fallout’ television series.”\n</p>\n<p>\n\tAn official release date has not yet been set for the “Burning Springs” update, but Microsoft confirms it will debut in December, with “Fallout” Season 2 set to premiere Dec. 17 on Amazon’s Prime Video. Bethesda Game Studios is set to reveal additional details about the update during its “Fallout Day” presentation Oct. 23. </p>\n<p>\n\tFor uninitiated players, “Fallout 76” is the “Fallout” video game set the furthest back in time for the franchise. That puts the game’s storyline well before the events in Amazon’s “Fallout” Season 1 and its upcoming Season 2, so the most natural way to incorporate aspects from the show into “Fallout 76” was to include a character that has been around in this post-apocalyptic wasteland for quite a while: The Ghoul. The character will now be implemented for the PTS on Oct. 2, featuring Goggins’ likeness and voice. \n\t</p>\n<p>\n\tVoiced by “Fallout” TV series star Goggins himself, The Ghoul will introduce bounty hunting to the game in the “Burning Springs” update: “Players can interact with this iconic character, who hosts bounty missions that can be found all throughout Burning Springs. New bounties will always be rolling in, so players should check with The Ghoul often to pick up the latest bounties – and their rewards upon completion, of course. While not available as a playable character or companion, players can encounter The Ghoul at ‘The Last Resort’ in Highway Town and see which of the many wanted folk in Burning Springs will be the next target.” </p>\n<p>\n\t“I think the biggest thing across the show and with the games, in general, is the stories, the characters, the dialogue all very much match,” “Fallout 76” lead producer Bill LaCoste said. “In terms of the stories we’re trying to tell, the characters we’re developing, people who watch the show but had never played the game we’re asking, how is that representative of the game? Like, are people in The Vault acting like that? I was like, ‘No, that’s real. That’s how they are in the game; they’re a little bit follow-the-leader type sheep. And then people in the wasteland, the Raiders, are exactly like that. It’s a great benefit to us to take a look at what they did in the show — the toasters, cabinets, shelves, everything is like, that’s what is in the game. So people coming in from the show will notice that there’s a lot of similarities, and for good reason.”</p>\n<p>\n\tWhen <em>Variety</em> spoke with the “Fallout 76” team back in July during Summer Game Fest, the developers were already <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/2025/gaming/news/fallout-season-2-fishing-tips-video-game-76-1236451304/\">hinting at an upcoming tie-in</a> with the Amazon show — and the game makers say there still could be more to come after “Burning Springs.”</p>\n<p>\n\t“The good part about working at BGS is how full of creative folks it is,” Bethesda Game Studios’ “Fallout 76” creative director Jon Rush told <em>Variety</em>. “So there are a lot of possible pathways we have forward for future features, or for expanding on existing features, that could have light tie ins to the show, or very direct tie ins to the show.”</p>\n</div>"

Previous reports had indicated that “Lioness” would be back for a third season despite the silence from Paramount, but the news has now been confirmed. </p>\n<p>\n\t“Lioness” stars Zoe Saldaña, Nicole Kidman, Morgan Freeman, Michael Kelly, Laysla De Oliveira, Genesis Rodriguez, Dave Annable, Jill Wagner, LaMonica Garrett, James Jordan, Austin Hébert, Jonah Wharton, Thad Luckinbill and Hannah Love Lanier. The official logline for Season 2 states:\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\t“The CIA’s fight against terror moved closer to home. Joe (Saldaña), Kaitlyn (Kidman), and Byron (Kelly) enlisted a new Lioness operative to infiltrate a previously unknown threat. With pressure mounting from all sides, Joe was forced to confront the profound personal sacrifices she made as the leader of the Lioness program.”\n</p>\n<p>\n\t“Lioness” is one of several Taylor Sheridan shows currently airing on Paramount+. The prolific creator also has the second season of the oil field drama “Landman” coming out in November and Season 4 of “Mayor of Kingstown” out in October, while Season 3 of “Tulsa King” debuted on Sept. 21. Sheridan also has the “Yellowstone” spinoff “The Madison,” which is awaiting a release date.

Glasser, Saldaña, Kidman, Ron Burkle, Bob Yari, David Hutkin, Jill Wagner, David Lemanowicz, Geyer Kosinski, Michael Friedman and Keith Cox.

    "body": "<div><p>\n\t<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/ariana-harwicz/\">Ariana Harwicz</a>, the bestselling author whose first novel “Die My Love” was brought to the screen by Lynne Ramsay, will see her latest book “<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/unfit/\">Unfit</a>” vie for a feature adaptation.</p>\n<p>\n\tPablo Bossi, who has produced iconic Argentinian films such as “Son of the Bride” and “Nine Queen” as well as Víctor Erice’s comeback feature “Close Your Eyes,” has optioned the rights to Harwicz’s “Unfit.” Similarly to “Die My Love,” “Unfit” is another subversive look at a mother on the edge.\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\tVanessa Saal, a London-based film executive with 20 years of experience across international sales, distribution, financing, acquisitions and production, will be working alongside Gloriamundi to develop, package and finance the screen adaptation of the new novel.\n</p>\n<p>\n\t“Unfit” (“Perder el Juicio”) follows an Argentinean mother in France who has lost custody of her two boys. Driven by destitution and desperation, she sneaks into her in-laws’ house, kidnaps her children, sets the barn ablaze and goes on the run. “What follows is a white-knuckled road trip that explores human beings pushed to the edge. A gripping chase that questions all our assumptions — and points out our hypocrisies,” reads the feature project’s synopsis, which describes the novel as “addictively terrifying, savagely sophisticated and shockingly brilliant.”</p>\n<p>\n\tHarwicz, who’s become one of the most prominent and distinctive voices in Latin American literature, has seen novels translated into more than 20 languages. </p>\n<p>\n\t“Die My Love” was longlisted for the Booker International Prize and acquired by Martin Scorsese who is a producer on the film adaptation, which is directed by Lynne Ramsay and stars Jennifer Lawrence, Robert Pattinson, Sissy Spacek and Nick Nolte. The film premiered in competition at Cannes and was acquired by Mubi for the U.S. and multiple other territories in splashy $24 million deal. “Die My Love” has since emerged a potent contender in the awards season, bolstered by Lawrence’s gripping performance as a woman struggling with motherhood and rebelling against society’s expectations.\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\tBossi, who previously founded Patagonik Films and Pampa Films, has produced over 50 feature films in Argentina. In 2012, he launched Gloriamundi Producciones in Madrid, and in 2017, he founded Tandem Films. Bossi is also a founding member of the Argentinean Federation of Film Producers and the National Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences, which he presided over between 2006 and 2010. </p>\n<p>\n\tSaal is currently leading MK2 Films’ U.K. office, advising the Paris-based studio on acquisitions and productions as they grow their English language slate, which includes Kent Jones’ “Late Fame,” which stars Willem Dafoe and Greta Lee, and had its world premiere at Venice. Saal, a member of BAFTA, previously worked as managing director of sales and distribution at Protagonist Pictures where she oversaw sales and international distribution of titles including Sean Baker’s “The Florida Project” and Chloe Zhao’s “The Rider,” Yorgos Lanthimos’ “The Lobster” and Pawel Pawlikowski’s “Cold War.” Prior to that she worked at Studiocanal and repped titles such as Tomas Alfredson’s “Tinker, Tailor, Soldier Spy” and the Coen brothers’ “Inside Llewyn Davis.”</p>\n</div>"

    "body": "<div><p>\n\tSouth by Southwest is getting a revamp for the festival’s 40th anniversary. </p>\n<p>\n\tFor the first time ever, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/sxsw/\">SXSW</a> — held March 12-18, 2026 in Austin, TX — will feature all of its programming running simultaneously across innovation, film & TV, and music for seven days, including an extra night of music.</p>\n<p>\n\t“At South by Southwest, a big part of our mission to focus on community and connection and bringing everyone together,” Greg Rosenbaum, SXSW’s SVP of programming, tells <em>Variety </em>about the way dates for this year’s festival aligned. \n\t</p>\n<p>\n\t“We’ve historically had innovation on the front half and then music on the back half, and film and TV over the course of a nine-day festival. That’s a long run,” Rosenbaum explains. “We know that if we can consolidate that energy into seven days in the downtown area of Austin, Texas, that will really bring a lot of different communities together.”\n</p>\n<p>\n\tThe footprint for the 2026 festival will be physically expanded, too. The Austin Convention Center has been home to SXSW for many years, but with the venue undergoing a full renovation, the team was inspired to reimagine the logistics for the event. As a result, SXSW will take over downtown Austin, transforming the area into a “creative village for global creatives” anchored by three dedicated Clubhouses for each slate of programming: the Innovation Clubhouse (Brazos Hall), the Film & TV Clubhouse (800 Congress), and the Music Clubhouse (The Downright).</p>\n<div>\n<figure>\n<p><img srcset=\"https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/SX-Map-Updated_d8f3c0.jpg 1000w, https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/SX-Map-Updated_d8f3c0.jpg?resize=90,150 90w, https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/SX-Map-Updated_d8f3c0.jpg?resize=180,300 180w\" src=\"https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/SX-Map-Updated_d8f3c0.jpg?w=614\" alt=\"\" />\n\t</p>\n<figcaption>\n\t</figcaption>\n</figure>\n</div>\n<p>\n\tSXSW also announced the first wave of featured sessions, with more than 50 conference sessions, and newly refined tracks spanning Brand & Marketing, Cities & Climate, Creator Economy, Culture, Design, Film & TV, Health, Music, Startups, Sports & Gaming, Tech & AI, and Workplace.

Meanwhile, the Innovation, Film & TV, and Music badges each include access to their dedicated clubhouse and two daily reservations.</p>\n<p>\n\t“We’re excited to introduce a new reservation system that allows attendees to really be thoughtful in their approach,” Rosenbaum says. “Part of the magic of South by is both those planned experiences that you know are going to be central to your time in Austin and the serendipity of discovery while you’re on site. This opportunity allows people, across all of our badge types, to plan ahead and then have the flexibility to discover while they’re at the event.”\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\tThe new reservation system is an upgrade to the previous program, South by Express, which allowed attendees to save their seats 24-48 hours in advance. The new system will allow guests to secure reservations as much as three to four weeks ahead of the festival. </p>\n<p>\n\tRosenbaum adds: “This allows people to make those plans before they’re ever on the plane on their way to Austin.”</p>\n<p>\n\t<em>More to come…</em></p>\n</div>"

    "body": "<div><p>\n\tIn one of the packed events at Madrid’s 5th Iberseries & Platino Industria, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/secuoya-studios/\">Secuoya Studios</a> brought out its latest international partners to discuss its global expansion plans and the perks of its pod business model.</p>\n<p>\n\tSecuoya CEO Brendan Fitzgerald led the panel comprising Chiara Cardoso (BlackBox Multimedia, UK), Sydney Gallonde (Make it Happen Studios, France), Jónas Margeir (Act4, Iceland) and Chris Moukarbel (Permanent Wave Productions, USA).\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\tEach partner shared his or her views on collaborating with the studio and the potential of this model to boost local projects across the international marketplace.\n</p>\n<p>\n\t “Iceland is a country of 390,000 people. That’s very small, we’re all kind of related, and we’re all friends on Instagram,” quipped Iceland’s Jonas Margeir of Act4, adding: “This has been called the age of co-production, where you have to work across borders to get things going but that’s been our reality always. So, when we were approached by Secuoya, it was an absolute joy because we believe that Secuoya stands for quality in content, which aligns perfectly with our vision.”</p>\n<p>\n\tFor Blackbox’s Cardoso, the company has always focused on seeking the best co-production partners, she stressed.  “When the opportunity to collaborate with Secuoya came up, it was the first time we felt we had a partner that not only offers creative collaboration, but also financing and production. It was a dream,” she said.</p>\n<p>\n\tCardoso explained that thanks to this approach, two projects are set to launch in 2025 with the potential to travel and connect with international audiences. “The team understands your needs, provides contracts, talent, and scripts that can work in the best possible way,” she said, extolling the creative inventiveness that makes it possible to recreate British landscapes in northern Spain or the Canary Islands.\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\tDocumentarian Moukarbel of Permanent Wave Productions, stressed that the line between documentary and fictional narrative has become increasingly blurred: “Documentaries have become more cinematic, with production values comparable to fiction. Collaborating with a partner who has credentials in that space makes a lot of sense,” he pointed out. The filmmaker emphasized that people are all documenting their lives and that the internet has become the epicenter of storytelling: “20 or 30 years ago, the only way to access someone’s life was through a documentary. That’s why there’s now a drive to give documentaries a cinematic treatment — to differentiate them and elevate their narrative level,” he said.</p>\n<p>\n\tAsked what aspects of a project would most appeal to them, Cardoso replied that the emotional core of a story was key. Margeir cited the appeal of the multi Emmy-winning “<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/adolescence/\">Adolescence</a>” on Netflix as an example of a simple story that was told differently, that surprised him.</p>\n<p>\n\t“I want you to be ready to die for your project. That’s the only thing that I want,” said Gallonde of Make it Happen Studio, who sees the partnership with Secuoya as a qualitative leap in his way of producing: “Thanks to Secuoya, I’m not alone — now I’m part of a business with talent. That allows me to showcase what we’ve done and what we’re going to do, but also to move faster, close bigger deals and take on more ambitious projects.” Gallonde, who has worked on both French and international adaptations, argued that the strength of a project lies in its roots.</p>\n<p>\n\tBased in Madrid with a strong international footprint, including operations in Mexico, Colombia, Peru, Chile and the U.S., Secuoya Studios is expanding globally through its innovative pod-based model. These creative and production pods allow the studio to quickly and efficiently develop, adapt and deliver content across multiple markets.</p>\n<p>\n\tIn early business news at Iberseries & Platino Industria, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/2025/tv/global/beta-film-secuoya-studios-william-levy-1236534704/\">Munich-based Beta Film unveiled</a> that it will handling international distribution on Secuoya Studios’ “Under a Volcano” and “Road to Arcadia,” both starring William Levy,  and part of a two title three-way deal between Secuoya, William Levy Entertainment and ViX, the streaming service of TelevisaUnivision. </p>\n<div>\n<figure>\n<p><img srcset=\"https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Spotlight-Secuoya-Studios@juancarloslucasDSC_8367-1.jpg 8256w, https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Spotlight-Secuoya-Studios@juancarloslucasDSC_8367-1.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Spotlight-Secuoya-Studios@juancarloslucasDSC_8367-1.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Spotlight-Secuoya-Studios@juancarloslucasDSC_8367-1.jpg?resize=1920,1280 1920w, https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Spotlight-Secuoya-Studios@juancarloslucasDSC_8367-1.jpg?resize=1360,907 1360w, https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Spotlight-Secuoya-Studios@juancarloslucasDSC_8367-1.jpg?resize=1000,667 1000w, https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Spotlight-Secuoya-Studios@juancarloslucasDSC_8367-1.jpg?resize=910,607 910w, https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Spotlight-Secuoya-Studios@juancarloslucasDSC_8367-1.jpg?resize=681,454 681w, https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Spotlight-Secuoya-Studios@juancarloslucasDSC_8367-1.jpg?resize=450,300 450w, https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Spotlight-Secuoya-Studios@juancarloslucasDSC_8367-1.jpg?resize=250,167 250w\" src=\"https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Spotlight-Secuoya-Studios@juancarloslucasDSC_8367-1.jpg?w=1024\" alt=\"\" />\n\t</p>\n<figcaption>\n\t</figcaption>\n</figure>\n</div>\n</div>"
