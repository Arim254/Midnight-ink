    "body": "<div><p>\n\tFounder and CEO of U.K. production banner Good Chaos (“Triangle of Sadness”), <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/mike-goodridge/\">Mike Goodridge</a> likes prestige. But prestige doesn’t pay the bills, emphasized the industry veteran while giving a talk at the Creative Investors’ Conference at the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/san-sebastian-film-festival-2/\">San Sebastián Film Festival</a>. </p>\n<p>\n\tSpeaking about the experience of producing <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/edward-berger/\">Edward Berger</a>’s “<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/ballad-of-a-small-player/\">Ballad of a Small Player</a>,” the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/colin-farrell/\">Colin Farrell</a>-starring psychological thriller playing at the Basque festival later in the week, the exec said it was a “great experience” and a “much bigger production” than what they usually tackle at Good Chaos. “We want to be doing more of those. I have prestige coming out of my ears. Prestige doesn’t pay the bills.” \n\t</p>\n<p>\n\t“What I’m trying to do is create a company that filmmakers would want to work with because they know we’re a secure home,” he added. “That takes a while. We only really started in 2020.” As for projects in his home country, the exec emphasized the U.K. has a “great cinema legacy and every year there are fantastic new films. I’d love to make great British films, and I am planning to.”\n</p>\n<p>\n\tStill, Goodridge thinks it is a “blessing and a curse” that the U.K. shares “the same language as the U.S.,” as “most technicians in the U.K. are employed by American companies.” “‘Harry Potter’ and ‘James Bond’ are British but not really. It’s U.S.. We have to navigate this path through the clutter of America,” he mused. </p>\n<p>\n\tGoodridge’s relationship with “Ballad of a Small Player” started back in 2018. At that time, the producer was the head of the U.K.’s Protagonist Pictures, where he championed major auteur-driven films such as Chloé Zhao’s “The Rider” and Sean Baker’s “The Florida Project.” Goodridge joined Protagonist in 2012 after serving as editor of Screen International. He was working on another project with Lawrence Osborne, the author of the novel that inspired “Ballad of a Small Player,” right before he left Protagonist, and was about to become artistic director of Macao Film Festival. \n\t</p>\n<p>\n\t“Lawrence said: ‘If you’re going to Macao, you should option my Macao story,’” recalled the exec. “I didn’t know at the time that I wanted to become an independent producer. Fortuitously, we took the book to Ed Berger in 2018, and he liked it. But then he was liking a lot of things at that point,” he quipped. </p>\n<p>\n\tGoodridge made a point of reiterating that, even after Berger blew up internationally, winning two Oscars for “All Quiet on the Western Front” in 2023 and then becoming another major Oscar player two years later with “Conclave,” he still “stuck with this project.” “When a director becomes so popular, things come to him so spectacularly. It’s a testament to Berger that he stuck to it.”</p>\n<div>\n<figure>\n<p><img srcset=\"https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/All-Quiet.jpg 1000w, https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/All-Quiet.jpg?resize=150,85 150w, https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/All-Quiet.jpg?resize=300,169 300w, https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/All-Quiet.jpg?resize=125,70 125w, https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/All-Quiet.jpg?resize=910,511 910w, https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/All-Quiet.jpg?resize=681,383 681w, https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/All-Quiet.jpg?resize=450,253 450w, https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/All-Quiet.jpg?resize=250,140 250w\" src=\"https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/All-Quiet.jpg?w=1000\" alt=\"\" />\n\t</p>\n<figcaption>\n\t\t\t\t\t<span>“All Quiet on the Western Front”</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tNetflix\n\t</figcaption>\n</figure>\n</div>\n<p>\n\tShooting in Macao was “the biggest challenge” when it came to Berger’s latest. “Very few Western films were shot there. We had to work through Hong Kong and within Macao. It was one of the most challenging things I’ve ever had to do,” said Goodridge. His experience in Macao, where he served between 2017 and 2021, proved helpful. </p>\n<p>\n\t“I love Macao,” he added. “It’s a very small city; it’s a city-state, so it’s very hard to build an indigenous industry. So you go through Hong Kong, and it’s not easy because they don’t know Macao either. Edward would point to a piece of land he wanted to shoot and we couldn’t find who owned the land, or we had locations we were told to steer away from because of who owned it.” </p>\n<p>\n\tThe story, largely tied to Macao’s bustling casinos, also faced challenges when it came to shooting within the busy betting centers. “Any moment you’re shooting, there is a loss of revenue to them,” said Goodridge, when explaining why they couldn’t shut down a casino for shooting. “They told us once that the high rollers could spend more money in a day than your entire budget.”</p>\n<p>\n\tSpeaking about budget, Goodridge publicly thanked partner Netflix for their support on the project. “We had looked at the value of the film in the independent market. We looked at it to get made, and it could be made for about $15 million, even with Colin Farrell. Netflix came in with more than that. It’s the kind of film you couldn’t make independently, so thank goodness for platforms.”\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\tGood Chaos has yet another partnership with Netflix coming up, with the streamer having acquired most of the global rights to Shih-Ching Tsou’s “Left-Handed Girl.” The film, which premiered at Cannes’ Critics Week earlier in the year, is produced, co-written, and edited by Oscar-winner Sean Baker, who first brought the project to Goodridge back in 2018 after they collaborated on “The Florida Project” via Protagonist. </p>\n<div>\n<figure>\n<p><img srcset=\"https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/ssiff49798_Ballad_of_a_Small_Player_-1.jpg 1200w, https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/ssiff49798_Ballad_of_a_Small_Player_-1.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/ssiff49798_Ballad_of_a_Small_Player_-1.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/ssiff49798_Ballad_of_a_Small_Player_-1.jpg?resize=1000,667 1000w, https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/ssiff49798_Ballad_of_a_Small_Player_-1.jpg?resize=910,607 910w, https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/ssiff49798_Ballad_of_a_Small_Player_-1.jpg?resize=681,454 681w, https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/ssiff49798_Ballad_of_a_Small_Player_-1.jpg?resize=450,300 450w, https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/ssiff49798_Ballad_of_a_Small_Player_-1.jpg?resize=250,167 250w\" src=\"https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/ssiff49798_Ballad_of_a_Small_Player_-1.jpg?w=1024\" alt=\"\" />\n\t</p>\n<figcaption>\n\t\t\t\t\t<span>“Ballad of a Small Player”</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCourtesy of SIFF\n\t</figcaption>\n</figure>\n</div>\n<p>\n\tIt has been a busy fall festival season for Goodridge, who went to Telluride with Berger and Venice with László Nemes’ “Orphan.” Now, the producer is eyeing television, even if he reiterates how often he hears it is “difficult to get people’s attention these days.” </p>\n<p>\n\t“I’m very comfortable in the film world,” he added. “I look at an independent film and I see a financing structure right away. You see it in your mind’s eye, and you’ll get it made one way or another. However, TV is not like that. It’s about broadcasters and commissioners who usually say no, and if they say no, that’s it, and you have to abandon the project. I think there’s a lot of wastage in TV. I [also] think there’s a lot of sharing between film and TV at the moment, so I want to succeed in television.”</p>\n</div>"

    "body": "<div><p>\n\t“<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/baywatch/\">Baywatch</a>” is back. <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/fox/\">Fox</a> has officially given a straight-to-series order for a reboot of the legendary lifeguard series to air during the 2026-2027 broadcast season. </p>\n<p>\n\tFox Entertainment and <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/fremantle/\">Fremantle</a> are co-producing the reboot, which has been given a 12-episode order. Matt Nix will serve as showrunner and executive producer, with Michael Berk, Greg Bonann, Dante Di Loreto, and Doug Schwartz also executive producing.  Berk, Bonnan, and Schwartz were the creators of the original series. \n\t</p>\n<p>\n\t“In its first run, ‘Baywatch’ defined an entire era of beach life and elevated lifeguards to an iconic status. Now, with our partners at Fremantle, this television juggernaut is set for a modern-day comeback,” said Michael Thorn, President of Fox Television Network. “Together, Fox and Fremantle, along with Matt Nix and original co-creator Greg Bonann, will bring the California dream to a whole new generation of fans with fresh stories, rising stars and all the spectacle that make the ‘Baywatch’ franchise a global sensation.”\n</p>\n<p>\n\tFremantle began toying with the idea of rebooting the series and its iconic red swimsuits as early as 2018, with Fox coming onboard in 2024 with a script plus penalty commitment. No cast members are attached to the reboot at the time of this publishing.  </p>\n<p>\n\t“Baywatch” originally debuted in 1989 on NBC. It aired for one season on that network before moving into syndication for the remainder of its 11-season run, during which it aired nearly 250 episodes. It was renamed “Baywatch: Hawaii” for its final two seasons as production moved to the island state from California. A reunion TV movie aired on Fox in 2003. \n\t</p>\n<p>\n\t“’Baywatch’ has always been a treasured asset in Fremantle’s portfolio and remains one of the most iconic series in television history globally. We have found the perfect partners in Fox to help us maintain this legacy. With Matt Nix at the helm, we are in great hands, as he excels at telling engaging and entertaining stories,” said Christian Vesper, CEO of global drama for Fremantle. “Our goal is to reconnect with existing fans while also introducing a new generation to the world of these famous lifeguards.”</p>\n<p>\n\tAt its peak, “Baywatch” was the most-watched show in the world, airing in over 200 countries. The ensemble cast included David Hasselhoff as head lifeguard Mitch Buchannon and helped launch the acting careers of stars like Pamela Anderson, Jason Momoa, Yasmine Bleeth, and Carmen Electra. The show also spawned the short-lived spinoff, “Baywatch Nights,” and was rebooted as a feature film starring Dwayne “The Rock” Johnson and Zac Efron in 2017. </p>\n<p>\n\tWith the series order, “Baywatch” will be the second lifeguard rescue series Fox will have had on the air in recent years. The broadcaster previously aired “Rescue: HI-Surf,” which was executive produced by John Wells. That show was <a href=\"https://variety.com/2025/tv/news/rescue-hi-surf-canceled-fox-1236389931/\" target=\"_blank\">canceled after just one season in May 2025</a>.  </p>\n</div>"

    "body": "<div><p>\n\tLyon, the birthplace of cinema, is preparing to welcome a host of A-list guests for its annual celebration of both heritage and contemporary cinema, the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/lumiere-film-festival-2/\">Lumière Film Festival</a>.</p>\n<p>\n\tRun by Cannes chief Thierry Frémaux, the event is gearing up for its 17th edition, with <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/michael-mann/\">Michael Mann</a> set to receive the festival’s Lumière Award for his body of work.</p>\n<p>\n\tThis year, the festival further strengthens its ties to U.S. film culture with masterclasses by <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/natalie-portman/\">Natalie Portman</a>, guest of honor <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/sean-penn/\">Sean Penn</a>, and the first major retrospective of Hollywood icon Martin Ritt. An actor’s director, Ritt guided 13 of his stars to Oscar glory. U.S.-based Mexican director <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/guillermo-del-toro/\">Guillermo del Toro</a>, a Lumière regular, is returning to Lyon to present Netflix’ “Frankenstein,” one of the fall’s most anticipated releases.\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\tPenn will reflect on his directing career, with a large-scale screening of his 2007 film “Into the Wild,” while Portman will headline a “Black Swan” tribute and present “Arco,” Ugo Bienvenu’s new animation film, which she produced.\n</p>\n<p>\n\t“We felt it was important to turn our attention towards America – what’s going on has left us somewhat speechless in recent months – and to restate our love for its cinema, and our desire to celebrate it,” chief programmer Maelle Arnaud told <em>Variety</em>. “At the same time, we also have a strong line-up from Asia and from Eastern Europe,” she added, emphasizing the festival’s aim to embrace a diversity of perspectives as both a cultural and political gesture.</p>\n<p>\n\t“It’s a reminder that culture has its say in the making of history, and that bringing together narratives from different parts of the world is more important than ever given the fragility of the state of the world,” Arnaud added.\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\tThe program mirrors that outlook, mixing a salute to American movies with tributes to filmmakers from Europe and Asia.</p>\n<p>\n\tHong Kong director John Woo (“The Killer, “Hard Boiled”) will sit for a masterclass and present restored versions of his classics, and Japanese iconoclast Seijun Suzuki, long celebrated for his unruly inventiveness – which inspired the likes of former Lumière Award laureates Quentin Tarantino and Wong Kar-wai – will be feted with five titles.</p>\n<p>\n\tOn the Eastern European side, Hungarian veteran István Szabó will speak about his work reflecting on Europe’s upheavals in the second half of the 20th century, and audiences will have a chance to explore a selection of films by Konrad Wolf, one East Germany’s most influential filmmakers. </p>\n<p>\n\tThe Ritt retrospective offers a chance to rediscover a director known for his socially committed Hollywood dramas such as “Hud,” “The Long Hot Summer,” and “The Spy Who Came In From The Cold.” “What struck us when revisiting his films is this double dimension,” Arnaud said. “On one hand, a deep social engagement – issues of race and social justice – and on the other, an extraordinary delicacy in his portrayal of relationships.”</p>\n<p>\n\tAs part of the festival’s ongoing spotlight on women filmmakers, a major retrospective is devoted to Norwegian director Anja Breien, a central figure of her country’s new wave, celebrated for her sharp feminist stories and social dramas such as “Next of Kin” and “Paper Bird.” Her “Wives” films, where she revisits the same characters a decade apart, remains a landmark in feminist cinema.</p>\n<p>\n\tAnother festival highlight is the tribute to French actor and theater director Louis Jouvet, “one of the great reference points for the Actors Studio and Lee Strasberg,” according to Arnaud – a reminder of how deeply French stage and screen traditions have helped shape international acting.</p>\n<p>\n\tHigh-profile premieres include “Frankenstein” and Disney’s Bruce Springsteen biopic “Springsteen: Deliver Me From Nowhere” starring Jeremy Allen White and directed by Scott Cooper (“Crazy Heart.”) “While Lumière is rooted in cinema history, we believe honoring the past also means embracing the present,” Arnaud noted. “The fact that studios start factoring Lumière into their release strategies says a lot about how much clout the festival has gained,” she added – a point highlighted by del Toro’s habit of bringing his latest work to Lyon.\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\tPalme d’Or contenders “Eagles of the Republic,” the final instalment in Tarik Saleh’s Cairo Trilogy, and Dominik Moll’s “Dossier 137,” as well as directorial debuts by Juliette Binoche (“In-I Motion”) and Shu Qi (“Girl”) will also be screened.</p>\n<p>\n\tLast year’s Lumière Award laureate Isabelle Huppert will return with “La Femme la Plus Riche du Monde” by Thierry Klifa, while Rebecca Zlotowski will present “Vie Privée.”</p>\n<p>\n\tClassic screenings include works by John Ford, Werner Herzog and Stanley Kubrick. Cine-concerts will pair Victor Sjöström’s “The Wind” (1928) with live orchestra and “The Phantom Carriage” (1921) with live organ, while the festival’s all-night filmathon will spotlight Japanese animation from Miyazaki to Satoshi Kon.</p>\n<p>\n\tThe festival’s 17th edition opens with former Lumière Award laureate Milos Forman’s “One Flew Over the Cuckoo’s Nest” on Oct. 11 and wraps with Michael Mann’s “Heat” on Oct. 19.</p>\n</div>"

The hip-hop <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/2024/music/news/kendrick-lamar-drake-j-cole-beef-explained-1235951318/\">beef</a> gave us Lamar’s Grammy-winning anthem, “Not Like Us,” and led to a legal fire with Drake suing his own label, Universal Music Group (UMG), over allegations of “devaluing his brand” amidst tensions. </p>\n<p>\n\tSeveral key figures in hip-hop shared their opinions, while others were directly involved as featured guests on Lamar or others’ multiple diss tracks. A$AP Rocky appeared on Future and Metro Boomin’s single “Show of Hands,” which was thought to be directed at Drake with lyrics referencing his girlfriend — and Drake’s rumored ex — Rihanna.\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\t“Still don’ trust you, it’s always us, never them,” Rocky raps on “Show of Hands.” “Heard you dropped your latest sh*t / Funny how it just came and went (Ha-ha-ha).”</p>\n<p>\n\tOn Tuesday, Rocky shared in an interview with<a href=\"https://www.elle.com/culture/celebrities/a66047766/asap-rocky-interview-2025/?taid=68d292d354c4430001acaee5&utm_campaign=trueanthemTWELM&utm_medium=social&utm_source=twitter\" target=\"_blank\"> Elle</a> that he thought the diss tracks were “healthy for hip-hop.” </p>\n<p>\n\t“The battle was between Kendrick and Drake, not Drake and everybody else who might have said something at that time, and that’s mainly why I fell back,” Rocky told Elle. “I just hate the way it’s turning out with [Drake] suing and all that. What part of the game is that? What type of shit is that? That’s none of my business, I guess.”</p>\n<p>\n\t<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/2025/music/news/universal-lucian-grainge-calls-drake-lawsuit-ridiculous-1236490322/\">Lucian Grainge</a>, chairman and CEO of UMG, the world’s largest music company, called Drake’s claims of defamation and that Grainge was involved in the planning and release of that song “farcical,” “nonsensical,” “groundless and indeed ridiculous” in a declaration letter filed in August. Grainge noted that the company had spent “hundreds of millions” in supporting the Canadian rapper’s music career. \n\t</p>\n<div><p>\n\tPrior to Grainge’s response, Drake had filed a motion to turn over the label’s contract with Lamar, along with details regarding alleged claims of domestic violence and committed by Lamar, who released “Not Like Us” and other songs referencing the battle via UMG’s Interscope division.</p></div>\n</div>"
