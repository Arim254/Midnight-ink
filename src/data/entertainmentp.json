Since 2015, the Kravitz Design x CB2 partnerships have worked to translate Kravitz’s distinct creative sensibility into furniture that balances statement-making style with livable function.</p>\n<p>\n\tThe latest capsule pulls inspiration from European modernism, California’s Case Study Houses, and the laid-back spirit of Malibu, according to a press release. The lineup features sculptural silhouettes with tactile luxury — all with Kravitz’s effortless ease. “I wanted this collection to distill everything we’ve learned in our years of collaboration with CB2 into a mix of elegant and enduring designs,” Kravitz said, citing Ludwig Mies van der Rohe, Philip Johnson, and the architectural movements of the ’20s and ’30s as key influences. “The goal was to create timeless pieces that bring elegance and ease into the modern home.”\n</p>\n<div>\n<figure>\n<p><img srcset=\"https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/CB2FA25_KD_0484_V1.jpg 6000w, https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/CB2FA25_KD_0484_V1.jpg?resize=113,150 113w, https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/CB2FA25_KD_0484_V1.jpg?resize=225,300 225w\" src=\"https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/CB2FA25_KD_0484_V1.jpg?w=768\" alt=\"\" />\n\t</p>\n<figcaption>\n\t</figcaption>\n</figure>\n</div>\n<div>\n<figure>\n<p><img srcset=\"https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/CB2FA25_KD_1011.jpg 6000w, https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/CB2FA25_KD_1011.jpg?resize=113,150 113w, https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/CB2FA25_KD_1011.jpg?resize=225,300 225w\" src=\"https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/CB2FA25_KD_1011.jpg?w=768\" alt=\"\" />\n\t</p>\n<figcaption>\n\t</figcaption>\n</figure>\n</div>\n<div>\n<figure>\n<p><img srcset=\"https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/CB2FA25_KD_HERO_1046.jpg 6000w, https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/CB2FA25_KD_HERO_1046.jpg?resize=113,150 113w, https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/CB2FA25_KD_HERO_1046.jpg?resize=225,300 225w\" src=\"https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/CB2FA25_KD_HERO_1046.jpg?w=768\" alt=\"\" />\n\t</p>\n<figcaption>\n\t</figcaption>\n</figure>\n</div>\n<div>\n<figure>\n<p><img srcset=\"https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/CB2FA25_KD_HERO_WIDE_1176.jpg 6000w, https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/CB2FA25_KD_HERO_WIDE_1176.jpg?resize=113,150 113w, https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/CB2FA25_KD_HERO_WIDE_1176.jpg?resize=225,300 225w\" src=\"https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/CB2FA25_KD_HERO_WIDE_1176.jpg?w=768\" alt=\"\" />\n\t</p>\n<figcaption>\n\t</figcaption>\n</figure>\n</div>\n<p>\n\tMaterials take center stage across the lineup, with Italian twills, suedes, leathers, and Breccia Fantasique marble providing textural contrast and depth.

    "body": "<div><p>\n\tA group of self-described “pro-democracy” organizations sent a letter to <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/disney/\">Disney</a> chief <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/bob-iger/\">Bob Iger</a> on behalf of two shareholders demanding details about ABC’s decision to suspend <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/jimmy-kimmel/\">Jimmy Kimmel</a> amid pressure from the Trump administration.</p>\n<p>\n\tThe letter on behalf of the Disney shareholders — the American Federation of Teachers, which is affiliated with the AFL-CIO, and Reporters Without Borders — requested the production of internal Disney documents and communications related to the decision to take Kimmel off the air for a week. The groups invoked shareholder rights under Delaware law to obtain information from corporations; such requests are granted only in cases of a breach of fiduciary duty and not for routine management decisions.\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\tThe groups contend Kimmel’s suspension is a potential violation of Disney’s obligations to shareholders. The letter, dated Sept. 24, says they are seeking “answers about whether Disney was involved in any wrongdoing in relation to the Kimmel suspension. The sudden disruption of a major late-night show, followed by its return, has sparked concerns about whether Disney violated its fiduciary duties to its shareholders by capitulating to government pressure.”\n</p>\n<p>\n\t“There is a credible basis to suspect that the [Disney] Board and executives may have breached their fiduciary duties of loyalty, care, and good faith by placing improper political or affiliate considerations above the best interests of the Company and its stockholders,” the letter alleged. The groups said they reserved the right to file a lawsuit “in the event that members of the Board or Disney executives did not properly discharge their fiduciary duties.”\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\tReps for Disney did not immediately respond to a request for comment. A copy of the letter from the groups is available at <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Democracy-Defenders-Fund-Disney-Letter.pdf\">this link</a>.</p>\n<p>\n\tThe groups claimed that “Disney’s stock suffered significant declines” in response to the Kimmel suspension. Shares of Disney dropped 3.3% from Sept. 18-23 but closed up 1.05% on Wednesday.</p>\n<p>\n\tABC on Sept. 17 said “Jimmy Kimmel Live!” would be suspended “indefinitely,” following remarks the host said on his show two days prior about “the MAGA gang” trying to score political points over Charlie Kirk’s murder. Disney brought Kimmel back on Tuesday night, which <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/2025/tv/news/jimmy-kimmel-live-ratings-viewers-abc-1236528577/\">scored as its highest-rated episode ever</a>. That’s despite “Jimmy Kimmel Live!” being blacked out on some 70 ABC affiliates operated by Sinclair and Nexstar, representing about 23% of U.S. TV households. The station groups preempted Kimmel after FCC chairman Brendan Carr threatened to pursue “news distortion” complaints against ABC stations unless Kimmel were fired. As noted in the letter, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/2025/tv/news/nexstar-acquires-tegna-1236492664/\">Nexstar’s proposed $6.2 billion acquisition of Tegna</a>, which requires FCC approval.</p>\n<p>\n\tIn the letter to Iger, the groups cited Trump’s social-media post <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/2025/tv/news/trump-disney-abc-jimmy-kimmel-return-bunch-of-losers-1236526488/\">railing against ABC and Kimmel</a>, with the president writing, “I think we’re going to test ABC on this. Let’s see how we do. Last time I went after them, they gave me $16 Million Dollars.” Trump’s threat makes the groups’ concerns “even more timely,” they wrote in the letter.</p>\n<p>\n\tAmong the documents requested by the groups are those related to “the actual or potential financial, contractual, or reputational impact on the Company arising from any such decision or threat by Nexstar or Sinclair to preempt the airing of ‘Jimmy Kimmel Live!'”</p>\n<p>\n\t“Despite Jimmy Kimmel’s return to late night, this affair is far from over. The FCC continues to threaten media organizations over content it doesn’t like and, in the case of Kimmel, dozens of affiliates are still refusing to air his show,” Clayton Weimers, executive director of Reporters Without Borders USA, said in a statement. “The public needs to know how government actions toward the media unfolded in this instance, so we can stop this reckless assault on the First Amendment from going any further.”</p>\n<p>\n\tRandi Weingarten, president of the American Federation of Teachers, added: “Disney shareholders deserve the truth about exactly what went down inside the company after Brendan Carr’s threat to punish ABC unless action was taken against Jimmy Kimmel. The Disney board has a legal responsibility to act in the best interests of its shareholders — and we are seeking answers to discover if that bond was broken to kowtow to the Trump administration.”\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\tLawyers who signed the letter were Christopher J. Clark of Clark Smith Villazor LLP, Roberta A. Kaplan of Kaplan Martin LLP, and Norm Eisen of the Democracy Defenders Fund.</p>\n<p>\n\t“The fallout from suspending ‘Jimmy Kimmel Live!’ sparked criticism as an attack on free speech, triggered boycotts and union support for Mr. Kimmel, and caused Disney’s stock to plummet amid fears of brand damage and concerns that Disney was complicit in succumbing to the government overreach and media censorship,” the letter said. “And the negative repercussions on Disney and its stockholders remain given that, following the announcement that the show would be returning to the air, Donald Trump issued a new threat on his social media platform, Truth Social, stating on September 23, 2025, that ‘I think we’re going to test ABC out on this. Let’s see how we do.’”</p>\n</div>"

They’ll be joined by newcomers to the goofy intergalactic adventure, including Josh Gad, Keke Palmer, Lewis Pullman and Anthony Carrigan.\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\tAmazon MGM has confirmed the full cast now that production is underway. The studio also shared a behind-the-scenes photo of the stars, writers and director at a table read. “Spaceballs 2” is aiming to land in theaters in 2027. \n</p>\n<div>\n<figure>\n<p><img srcset=\"https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Spaceballs-2-Table-Read.jpg 1000w, https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Spaceballs-2-Table-Read.jpg?resize=150,84 150w, https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Spaceballs-2-Table-Read.jpg?resize=300,169 300w, https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Spaceballs-2-Table-Read.jpg?resize=125,70 125w, https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Spaceballs-2-Table-Read.jpg?resize=910,511 910w, https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Spaceballs-2-Table-Read.jpg?resize=681,383 681w, https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Spaceballs-2-Table-Read.jpg?resize=450,253 450w, https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Spaceballs-2-Table-Read.jpg?resize=250,140 250w\" src=\"https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Spaceballs-2-Table-Read.jpg?w=1000\" alt=\"\" />\n\t</p>\n<figcaption>\n\t\t\t\t\t<span>Many of the stars and creatives on “Spaceballs 2”</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tBrook Rushton\n\t</figcaption>\n</figure>\n</div>\n<p>\n\tJosh Greenbaum, who is known for “Barb and Star Go to Vista Del Mar” and “Will & Harper,” is directing from a script by Gad, Benji Samit and Dan Hernandez. The film’s full title and plot description haven’t been confirmed, but Amazon MGM cheekily wrote in the official press release that “the title is rumored to be the name of the movie, and plot details are being described as information about what happens in the story.” A prior logline, also using Brooks-esque humor, described the film as a “non-prequel non-reboot sequel part two but with reboot elements franchise expansion film.” Like the original, the sequel is expected to riff on popular sci-fi franchises like “Star Wars,” “Star Trek” and “Alien.”</p>\n<p>\n\tMoranis is best known for comedies like “Ghostbusters,” “Little Shop of Horrors” and “Honey, I Shrunk the Kids.” He took a long break from acting after his wife, Ann Belsky, died of cancer in 1991. Moranis had plans to return to the screen in 2020 for another sequel to “Honey, I Shrunk the Kids” but the projection was put indefinitely on hold due to COVID. Though he’s voiced characters since, Moranis hasn’t appeared in film since 1997’s “Honey, We Shrunk Ourselves.”\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\tBrooks, 99, is the comedy legend behind classics such as “The Producers,” “Blazing Saddles,” “Young Frankenstein” and “History of the World: Part 1.” He directed and co-wrote the original “Spaceballs” and will serve as a producer the sequel. Imagine Entertainment’s Brian Grazer, Ron Howard, and Jeb Brody, will also produce alongside Gad, Greenbaum and Kevin Salter. Adam Merims, Samit, and Hernandez will executive produce.</p>\n</div>"

    "body": "<div><p>\n\tTereza Nvotová’s drama “<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/father/\">Father</a>” – recently selected as the Slovak <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/academy-awards/\">Academy Awards</a> submission – has sold to multiple territories. The film, which world premiered in Venice, is heading to <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/zurich-film-festival/\">Zurich Film Festival</a>’s Feature Film Competition next.</p>\n<p>\n\tSold by <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/intramovies/\">Intramovies</a> and following the collaboration with Fandango in Italy, the film will be distributed in French-speaking Europe (Epicentre), Greece (Cinobo), the Baltics (Kino Pavasaris) and Spain (Reverso Films).\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\tStarring Milan Ondrík in the title role, it takes on real-life tragedies that are surprisingly common. In a <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/2025/film/global/slovak-director-tereza-nvotova-father-venice-1236497028/\">previous interview</a>, Nvotová said she had heard about three similar cases this year “just in the region I’m from.”\n</p>\n<p>\n\t“I’d only heard about them vaguely. But once I started working on the film, I realized how often this really happens,” Ondrík told <em>Variety</em>. In the film, which deals with so-called “Forgotten Child Syndrome,” he plays a father whose normal day turns into horror. </p>\n<p>\n\t“It’s shocking, because it’s not about ‘bad people.’ It’s about ordinary families, fathers and mothers who love their children – one moment of distraction turns life into hell. That’s why it was important for me to approach Michal with respect and to show his pain and humanity truthfully.”</p>\n<p>\n\tHe wanted to play him also because “it shows how fragile life really is.” </p>\n<p>\n\t“Michal is not a criminal or a villain. He’s an ordinary man, a father, and in one terrible moment he makes a mistake that destroys everything he loves. That’s terrifying and very human. I gave myself one condition as an actor: I had to live through this role, not just play it. It happened – painfully for me, but fortunately for the film.”\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\tHe’s joined by Dominika Morávková, Aňa Geislerová and Martina Sľúková.</p>\n<p>\n\tIn the film, Michal seems to have his life in order. But as his ordeal becomes public, people are quick to judge him. </p>\n<p>\n\t“I never saw him as a villain. Society may label him that way, but for me he’s still the same man: a father who loves his daughter, a husband trying to hold his family together,” said Ondrík. </p>\n<p>\n\t“He’s guilty, yes, but he’s also human. The tragedy is that people often can’t see both sides at the same time. My job was to show that paradox. He can be broken and still deserve compassion.”</p>\n<p>\n\tMaking the film watchable was crucial to the director – and to Ondrík as well. </p>\n<p>\n\t“Tereza and I talked a lot about finding balance. The film is dark and cruel, but it’s also about love and hope. Showing the right emotions in the right moments – that’s what keeps the audience connected to the character, even in such a heavy story.” </p>\n<p>\n\tLong takes also allowed the viewers to “stay right inside Michal’s head.” </p>\n<p>\n\t“It makes the film raw, but also intimate. I think that’s why people respond to it. They feel the tragedy and they also feel the humanity. And the possibility that even in the darkest place, there can still be some light.”</p>\n<p>\n\tSylvie Leray, CEO of Reverso Films, also praised the “subtle and nuanced” acting in the film. </p>\n<p>\n\t“Reverso Films is always attentive to the talents of Central and Eastern European countries and is particularly sensitive to a tough and universal subject, led by the poignant storytelling of the director.”</p>\n</div>"

    "body": "<div><p>\n\t<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/liev-schreiber/\">Liev Schreiber</a>, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/mayim-bialik/\">Mayim Bialik</a> and <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/debra-messing/\">Debra Messing</a> are among more than 1,200 entertainment industry names who have signed a new open letter denouncing the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/2025/film/global/stars-sign-pledge-complicit-israeli-film-companies-1236511010/\">call for a boycott of Israeli film institutions</a> over the war in Gaza.  </p>\n<p>\n\tThe letter, released on Thursday by the nonprofit organizations Creative Community for Peace and The Brigade, urges the nearly 4,000 signees of the boycott pledge — including Emma Stone and Joaquin Phoenix — to reconsider their stance. Other stars and industry professonals putting their names behind the new open letter include Gene Simmons, Sharon Osbourne, Greg Berlanti, Jerry O’Connell, Howie Mandel, Jennifer Jason Leigh, Lisa Edelstein, Erin Foster, Anthony Edwards, Rebecca De Mornay, Sherry Lansing and Haim Saban.\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\t“We know the power of film. We know the power of story. That is why we cannot stay silent when a story is turned into a weapon, when lies are dressed up as justice, and when artists are misled into amplifying antisemitic propaganda,” the letter begins. “The pledge circulated under the banner of Film Workers for Palestine is not an act of conscience. It is a document of misinformation that advocates for arbitrary censorship and the erasure of art. To censor the very voices trying to find common ground and express their humanity, is wrong, ineffective and a form of collective punishment.”\n</p>\n<p>\n\tThe boycott pledge, originally released on Sept. 8, said its signees would refuse to work with Israeli institutions and companies that are “implicated in genocide and apartheid against the Palestinian people.” Alongside Stone and Phoenix, signees included Yorgos Lanthimos, Ava DuVernay, Adam McKay, Boots Riley, Olivia Colman, Ayo Edebiri, Lily Gladstone, Mark Ruffalo, Hannah Einbinder, Peter Sarsgaard, Aimee Lou Wood, Paapa Essiedu, Gael Garcia Bernal, Riz Ahmed, Melissa Barrera, Cynthia Nixon, Tilda Swinton, Javier Bardem, Joe Alwyn and Josh O’Connor.\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\tAs the new letter points out, in spite of the boycott calls, much of the country’s left-leaning film and TV industry has been <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/2025/film/news/israeli-filmmakers-industry-boycott-hurt-anti-war-stories-1236519217/\">standing against the Israeli government</a> at their own risk. Just last week, the film “The Sea” — which tells the story of a young Palestinian boy who risks his life to go to the beach in Tel Aviv — won the top prize at Israel’s Ophir Awards and was submitted as the country’s selection for the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/2025/film/global/israel-the-sea-oscars-international-feature-race-1236520921/\">Oscars international feature race</a>. As a result, the Israeli sports and culture minister <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/2025/film/global/israeli-film-academy-awards-government-defunding-the-sea-1236521602/\">vowed to cut funding</a> from the awards.</p>\n<p>\n\t“When artists boycott fellow artists based solely on their country of origin, it is blatant discrimination and a betrayal of our role as storytellers,” Messing said in a statement. “History shows us that boycotts against Jews have long been a tool of authoritarian regimes — by joining this effort, these artists are knowingly or unknowingly aligning themselves with a dark legacy of antisemitism.”</p>\n<p>\n\tAdded Bialik: “Artists and creatives have a unique opportunity and responsibility to remind the world of our shared humanity. Boycotting filmmakers, studios, production companies and individuals simply because they are Israeli fuels division and contributes to a disturbing culture of marginalization. Additionally, this boycott pledge does nothing to end the war in Gaza, bring the hostages home, or help curb the alarming rise of antisemitism globally.”</p>\n<p>\n\tThe new open letter also comes on the heels of <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/2025/film/news/paramount-condemns-israeli-film-boycott-1236516511/\">Paramount condemning</a> the boycott call in a statement on Sept. 12. “We do not agree with recent efforts to boycott Israeli filmmakers,” Paramount chief communications officer Melissa Zukerman said. “Silencing individual creative artists based on their nationality does not promote better understanding or advance the cause of peace,” the statement continued. “The global entertainment industry should be encouraging artists to tell their stories and share their ideas with audiences throughout the world. We need more engagement and communication — not less.”</p>\n<p>\n\tRead the full open letter below and see <a href=\"https://www.creativecommunityforpeace.com/blog/2025/09/24/filmopenletter/\" target=\"_blank\">all the signees here</a>.</p>\n<p>\n\t<em>To our fellow artists and the global film community,</em></p>\n<p>\n\t<em>We know the power of film. We know the power of story. That is why we cannot stay silent when a story is turned into a weapon, when lies are dressed up as justice, and when artists are misled into amplifying antisemitic propaganda.</em>\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\t<em>The pledge circulated under the banner of “Film Workers for Palestine” is not an act of conscience. It is a document of misinformation that advocates for arbitrary censorship and the erasure of art.</em></p>\n<p>\n\t<em>To censor the very voices trying to find common ground and express their humanity, is wrong, ineffective, and a form of collective punishment.</em></p>\n<p>\n\t<em>Israel’s film industry includes groundbreaking, celebratory, and critical projects about Palestinians and Jews, which many of you have lauded and celebrated. Israel’s film community is restless, argumentative, and independent, where directors challenge ministers and many of the very festivals you target, consistently program dissent.</em></p>\n<p>\n\t<em>Israel’s entertainment industry is a vibrant hub of collaboration between Jewish and Palestinian artists and creatives, who work together every single day to tell complex stories that entertain and inform both communities and the world. Israeli film institutions are not government entities. They are often the loudest critics of government policy.</em></p>\n<p>\n\t<em>The pledge uses nebulous terms like ‘implicating’ and ‘complicity.’ Who will decide which Israeli filmmakers and film institutions are ‘complicit’? A McCarthyist committee with blacklists? Or is ‘complicity’ just a pretext to boycott all Israelis and Zionists — 95% of the world’s Jewish population — no matter what they create or believe?</em></p>\n<p>\n\t<em>History warns us. Censorship has been used to silence filmmakers before: Nazi Germany’s propaganda machine, Soviet censorship, and even Hollywood’s own blacklists. Every time it was dressed up as virtue. And every time it was oppression. Every time, its targets expanded.</em></p>\n<p>\n\t<em>We know that many of you have good intentions and believe you are standing for peace. But your names are being weaponized and tied to lies and discrimination. This pledge erases dissenting Israeli voices, legitimizes falsehoods, and shields Hamas from blame.</em></p>\n<p>\n\t<em>If you want peace, call for the immediate release of the remaining hostages. Support filmmakers who create dialogue across communities. Stand against Hamas.</em></p>\n<p>\n\t<em>Let art speak the whole truth.</em></p>\n<p>\n\t<em>We call on all our colleagues in the entertainment industry to reject this discriminatory and antisemitic boycott call that only adds another roadblock on the path to peace.</em></p>\n</div>"

    "body": "<div><p>\n\tDanish director Frederik Sølberg’s “<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/hana-korea/\">Hana Korea</a>” emerged as a crowd favorite at this year’s <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/busan-international-film-festival/\">Busan International Film Festival</a>, taking home the Flash Forward competition audience award for its nuanced portrayal of North Korean defection and resettlement. </p>\n<p>\n\tThe film, which world premiered at BIFF, represents a creative journey that began with a chance encounter in Seoul and culminated in an equal Danish-Korean co-production that challenges conventional filmmaking models.\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\t“Fifteen years ago, I traveled to South Korea for the first time,” Sølberg recalls of the project’s genesis. “On my first evening in Seoul, I walked into a restaurant and struck up a conversation with two Korean men who had taken part in some kind of war memorial event. Their English was limited, but they managed to express how deeply they were affected by the division of Korea. I remember one of them said to me: ‘All we want is hana Korea’ — which means ‘one Korea.'”\n</p>\n<p>\n\tThat encounter planted a seed that would eventually bloom into a feature film, but not before years of research and relationship-building. Sølberg’s fascination with Hanawon, South Korea’s integration center for North Korean refugees, led him to make a radio documentary about the facility. “That experience planted the seed for a film – not about North Korea itself, but about the transformation the North Koreans go through, a film about what it means to be North Korean in South Korea.”</p>\n<p>\n\tIn 2019, while researching with Danish producer Sara Stockmann and Korean producer Heejung Oh, the team met Hyorin, a young North Korean woman whose experiences would inspire the film’s protagonist. “Hyorin immediately stood out,” Sølberg explains. “She shared stories I never expected to hear from a North Korean refugee. Her presence, her honesty, and sincerity left us awestruck.”\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\tCrucially, Hyorin challenged Sølberg to tell her story. “At the end of our conversation, her message to me was: ‘I want you to make a film about this. I want you to do it — because you are not Korean. You are not part of the context.'” Since then, she has been involved throughout the process, even inviting Sølberg to her wedding. “Today we’re friends,” he notes.</p>\n<p>\n\tThe script, co-written with Sharon Choi (known for her work with Bong Joon Ho), transformed Hyorin’s experiences into the fictional character of Hyesun. “Sharon has a rare ability to combine deep insight into female experiences and life as a young Korean woman, with intellectual reflections over life, identity, and belonging, and with a sharp sense of structure, dramaturgy, and character development,” Sølberg says.</p>\n<p>\n\tFor the demanding lead role, Sølberg turned to <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/kim-minha/\">Kim Minha</a>, fresh off her acclaimed performance in Apple TV’s “Pachinko.” “I watched the Apple TV series ‘Pachinko,’ in which Minha stars and her performance absolutely blew me away,” the director recalls. “From the moment she walked through the door, it was clear that she fully understood the direction we were taking.”</p>\n<p>\n\tFor Minha, the biggest challenge was mastering the North Korean dialect. “When I first started working with a dialect coach, the very first thing they told me was to forget the dialects we usually hear in the media,” she explains. “To portray Hyesun’s hometown dialect from Ryanggang Province with more precision, I invested a lot of time and received sharp feedback from the coaches on every single take.”</p>\n<p>\n\tThe actor approached the role with careful attention to her character’s gradual transformation. “Hyesun is someone who is constantly on guard, quick to protect herself. But as she gradually settles into life in the South, she also becomes more flexible. I wanted to capture those shifts — her softening — through subtle changes in her expressions, tone, and gestures.”</p>\n<p>\n\tCinematically, Sølberg developed a visual grammar that mirrors Hyesun’s journey toward freedom. “Initially, I had a guiding principle, almost like a rule: using slow cinema tableaux, a fixed frame whenever Hyesun is limited, constrained, or under custody. In contrast, we would employ more vibrant, hand-held shots as she grows, adapts, and gains freedom.”\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\tWorking with DOP Stephanie Stål Axelgård, the team extended this concept beyond framing. “We defined how time, silence, blocking, lighting, color, and production design could all reinforce Hyesun’s emotional journey,” Sølberg explains. “For us it was overall important to work with a cinematic style that elevates and supports Hyesun’s emancipation: she is not only breaking free from the situation she has ended up in, she also breaks free from how the camera sees her and in that sense takes control of her own narrative.”</p>\n<p>\n\tCentral to the film’s structure are letters Hyesun writes to her mother — a device inspired by Hyorin’s actual correspondence. “Early in development, we were fortunate to gain access to Hyorin’s letters to her family,” Sølberg reveals. “They were deeply heartfelt, a stark reminder of the gravity of the choices she had to make, and of how central her family remained throughout her journey.”</p>\n<p>\n\tFor Minha, these letters provided crucial insight into her character. “Hyesun was inspired by a real North Korean refugee woman, whom the production team followed for five years while developing the script. I read her actual letters, and they gave me a great deal of inspiration. When I first received the script, what moved me the most was the voiceover and it felt very precious to me.”</p>\n<p>\n\t“Hana Korea” represents an innovative approach to international co-production. Despite the Danish Film Institute being the main funder, the team established what Sølberg calls “an equal co-production structure.”</p>\n<p>\n\t“We were convinced the film could not succeed – storywise or artistically – unless the Korean perspective was fully integrated from the very beginning,” he explains. “This is the framework under which ‘Hana Korea’ has been produced: our Korean producer and our Danish producer have worked as equal partners in every phase of the production, from early research to the final film, sharing a joint leadership role.”</p>\n<p>\n\tThe approach extended to the creative process, with extensive consultation with North Korean experts and defectors throughout production. “Over the years, we interviewed nearly 30 North Koreans and spoke with experts and staff,” Sølberg notes. “For us, it was crucial to create a film grounded in real experiences rather than simplified narratives.”\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\t“Hyorin constantly reminds us that this story is not abstract. It’s real,” he adds. “That gives a feeling of responsibility — that we need to do our best to make a film that somehow pays respect to Hyorin and her fellow North Koreans. To make a film that makes them feel recognized.”</p>\n<p>\n\tWith <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/2024/film/global/kim-joo-ryung-reinvent-sharon-choi-1236004385/\">REinvent handling international sales</a>, “Hana Korea” is positioned for wider festival and theatrical release. </p>\n</div>"

    "body": "<div><p>\n\t<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/2023/music/news/ai-vs-music-industry-fake-drake-eminem-who-gets-paid-1235601494/\">Problems surrounding AI </a>have been one of the music industry’s most pressing issues in recent months, and <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/spotify/\">Spotify</a> has announced a strengthening of its platform’s protections against “AI slop,” spamming and other fraudulent activity.  The company notes that in the past 12 months, it has removed over 75 million “spammy” tracks from its platform.</p>\n<p>\n\tIts new protections include a policy to police unauthorized vocal impersonation (“deepfakes”) and fraudulent music uploaded to artists’ official profiles; an enhanced spam filter to prevent mass uploads, duplicates, SEO hacks, artificially short tracks designed to fraudulently boost streaming numbers and payments. The company also says it’s collaborating with industry partners to devise an industry standard in a song’s credits to “clearly indicate where and how AI played a role in the creation of a track.”\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\t“The pace of recent advances in generative AI technology has felt quick and at times unsettling, especially for creatives,” the company writes in a just-published post on its official blog. “At its best, AI is unlocking incredible new ways for artists to create music and for listeners to discover it. At its worst, AI can be used by bad actors and content farms to confuse or deceive listeners, push ‘slop’ into the ecosystem, and interfere with authentic artists working to build their careers.\n</p>\n<p>\n\t“The future of the music industry is being written, and we believe that aggressively protecting against the worst parts of Gen AI is essential to enabling its potential for artists and producers.”\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\tIn a press briefing on Wednesday, Spotify VP and Global Head of Music Product Charlie Hellman said, “I want to be clear about one thing: We’re not here to punish artists for using AI authentically and responsibly. We hope that they will enable them to be more creative than ever. </p>\n<p>\n\t“But we <em>are</em> here to stop the bad actors who are gaming the system. And we can only benefit from all that good side if we aggressively protect against the bad side.” </p>\n<p>\n\tAccording to the announcement, those protections include:</p>\n<p>\n\t<strong>Stronger impersonation rules</strong></p>\n<p>\n\t<em>The issue: We’ve always had a policy against deceptive content. But AI tools have made generating vocal deepfakes of your favorite artists easier than ever before.</em></p>\n<p>\n\t<em>What we’re announcing: We’ve introduced a new impersonation policy that clarifies how we handle claims about AI voice clones (and other forms of unauthorized vocal impersonation), giving artists stronger protections and clearer recourse. Vocal impersonation is only allowed in music on Spotify when the impersonated artist has authorized the usage.</em></p>\n<p>\n\t<em>We’re also ramping up our investments to protect against another impersonation tactic — where uploaders fraudulently deliver music (AI-generated or otherwise) to another artist’s profile across streaming services. We’re testing new prevention tactics with leading artist distributors to equip them to better stop these attacks at the source. On our end, we’ll also be investing more resources into our content mismatch process, reducing the wait time for review, and enabling artists to report “mismatch” even in the pre-release state.</em></p>\n<p>\n\t<em>Why it matters: Unauthorized use of AI to clone an artist’s voice exploits their identity, undermines their artistry, and threatens the fundamental integrity of their work. Some artists may choose to license their voice to AI projects — and that’s their choice to make. Our job is to do what we can to ensure that the choice stays in their hands.</em></p>\n<p>\n\t<strong>Music spam filter</strong></p>\n<p>\n\t<em>The issue: Total music payouts on Spotify have grown from $1B in 2014 to $10B in 2024. But big payouts entice bad actors. Spam tactics, such as mass uploads, duplicates, SEO hacks, artificially short track abuse, and other forms of slop, have become easier to exploit as AI tools make it easier for anyone to generate large volumes of music.</em>\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\t<em>What we’re announcing: This fall, we’ll roll out a new music spam filter — a system that will identify uploaders and tracks engaging in these tactics, tag them, and stop recommending them. We want to be careful to ensure we’re not penalizing the wrong uploaders, so we’ll be rolling the system out conservatively over the coming months and continue to add new signals to the system as new schemes emerge.</em></p>\n<p>\n\t<em>Why it matters: Left unchecked, these behaviors can dilute the royalty pool and impact attention for artists playing by the rules. Our new music spam filter will protect against this behavior and help prevent spammers from generating royalties that could be otherwise distributed to professional artists and songwriters.</em></p>\n<p>\n\t<strong>AI disclosures for music with industry-standard credits</strong></p>\n<p>\n\t<em>The issue: Many listeners want more information about what they’re listening to and the role of AI technology in the music they stream. And, for artists who are responsibly using AI tools in their creation process, there’s no way on streaming services for them to share if and how they’re using AI. We know the use of AI tools is increasingly a spectrum, not a binary, where artists and producers may choose to use AI to help with some parts of their productions and not others. The industry needs a nuanced approach to AI transparency, not forced to classify every song as either “is AI” or “not AI”.</em></p>\n<p>\n\t<em>What we’re announcing: We’re helping develop and will support the new industry standard for AI disclosures in music credits, developed through DDEX. As this information is submitted through labels, distributors, and music partners, we’ll begin displaying it across the app. This standard gives artists and rightsholders a way to clearly indicate where and how AI played a role in the creation of a track — whether that’s AI-generated vocals, instrumentation, or post-production. This change is about strengthening trust across the platform. It’s not about punishing artists who use AI responsibly or down ranking tracks for disclosing information about how they were made.</em></p>\n<p>\n\t<em>This is an effort that will require broad industry alignment, and we’re proud to be working on this standard alongside a wide range of industry partners, including: Amuse, AudioSalad, Believe, CD Baby, DistroKid, Downtown Artist & Label Services, EMPIRE, Encoding Management Service – EMS GmbH, FUGA, IDOL, Kontor New Media, Labelcamp, NueMeta, Revelator, SonoSuite, Soundrop and Supply Chain.</em>\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\t<em>Why it matters: By supporting an industry standard and helping to drive its wide adoption, we can ensure listeners see the same information, no matter which service they’re listening on. And ultimately, that preserves trust across the entire music ecosystem, as listeners can understand what’s behind the music they stream. We see this as an important first step, which will undoubtedly continue to evolve.</em></p>\n<p>\n\tThe post concludes, “We support artists’ freedom to use AI creatively, while actively combating its misuse by content farms and bad actors. Spotify does not create or own music; this is a platform for licensed music where royalties are paid based on listener engagement, and all music is treated equally, regardless of the tools used to make it.</p>\n<p>\n\t“These updates are the latest in a series of changes we’re making to support a more trustworthy music ecosystem for artists, for rightsholders, and for listeners. We’ll keep them coming as the tech evolves, so stay tuned.”</p>\n<p>\n\t<em>Variety</em> will have more on the situation as it continues to develop.</p>\n</div>"
