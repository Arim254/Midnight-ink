    "body": "<div><p>\n\tA key initiative connecting filmmakers, producers and creators from Ibero-America and Europe with fiction, documentary or animated projects in late-stage development, the Iberseries Co-Production & Financing forum aims to back high-level productions and spark strategic collaborations between industry professionals on both sides of the Atlantic.</p>\n<p>\n\tSelected teams will engage in tailored one-on-one meetings with potential co-producers, sales agents, distributors, financiers and platforms.\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\tIberseries & Platino Industria continues to expand its global network through partnerships with major festivals and markets such as Blood Window, FICCI, Rio2C, BIF Market, and Seriencamp. These alliances enable top-tier projects to join the Forum as special guests, creating new paths for international co-production and distribution.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tMore than a pitching space, the Forum serves as a dynamic hub for building partnerships and tracking emerging creative and business trends within the Ibero-American audiovisual sector.</p>\n<p>\n\tThis year’s crop hail from not only from Spain, Portugal and Latin America but also from Romania, Italy and Germany, Canada and the U.K., among others.</p>\n<p>\n\tEach of the 11 series projects selected for the Forum aim for resonance both at home and abroad, showcasing the wide range of today’s Ibero-American storytelling — from noir thrillers to intimate dramedies, hybrid docudramas and even adult animation. Some stand out for their pedigree — a thriller adapted from João Tordo’s bestseller, or a docudrama reopening the Columbus debate. Others for sheer originality — a Buenos Aires flat turned into a marital experiment, or a fallen TV axolotl plotting a comeback.\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\t<strong>A List of the Projects in the Forum:</strong></p>\n<p>\n\t<strong>FILM</strong></p>\n<p>\n\t<strong>“Accounts”</strong> (“Los relatos,” Miguel del Arco, Spain, Romania)<br />20 years after being imprisoned for his wife’s murder, Pablo returns to his hometown as his biography is published. “The film interweaves multiple perspectives to explore gender violence, social reintegration and collective memory in the aftermath of the crime,” says director Miguel del Arco. Now shooting, the film is produced by Spain’s Aquí y Allí Films (“Life and Nothing More”), 3040 Cine and Avanpost.</p>\n<p>\n\t<strong>“Cabildo 71” </strong>(Victoria “Pitoka” Pena, Uruguay, Spain, Brazil)<br />Inspired by the 1970 escape of Tupamara prisoners, the film follows political prisoner La Parda as she joins a secret plan for the largest women’s prison break in history. A Monarca Films-led co-production with highly active player Vitrine Filmes and Boulevard Filmes, now in financing. Selected for Iberseries, Cine Qua Non Lab, and FRAPA. Brazil’s reliably excellent Maeve Jinkings (“Charcoal”) stars. “An intimate lens on resistance,” says Pena.</p>\n<div>\n<figure>\n<p><img srcset=\"https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/ClosedForMourning-Portada-Horizontal.png 1920w, https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/ClosedForMourning-Portada-Horizontal.png?resize=150,84 150w, https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/ClosedForMourning-Portada-Horizontal.png?resize=300,169 300w, https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/ClosedForMourning-Portada-Horizontal.png?resize=125,70 125w, https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/ClosedForMourning-Portada-Horizontal.png?resize=1000,563 1000w, https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/ClosedForMourning-Portada-Horizontal.png?resize=910,511 910w, https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/ClosedForMourning-Portada-Horizontal.png?resize=681,383 681w, https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/ClosedForMourning-Portada-Horizontal.png?resize=450,253 450w, https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/ClosedForMourning-Portada-Horizontal.png?resize=250,140 250w\" src=\"https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/ClosedForMourning-Portada-Horizontal.png?w=1024\" alt=\"\" />\n\t</p>\n<figcaption>\n\t</figcaption>\n</figure>\n</div>\n<p>\n\t<strong>“Closed for Mourning” </strong>(“Cerrado por Duelo,” Darío Mascambroni, Argentina, Italy, Chile)<br />A fatal accident, a faked suicide and a family implosion drive this dark comedy-drama about two men spiraling toward tragedy. In advanced development, the project is backed by Jaque Content (Argentina), The Piranesi Experience (Italy) and Juntos Films (Chile). Selected for EAVE Puentes, Berlinale Talents, and Iberseries. “A ruthless, absurdist take on family as battleground,” says Mascambroni.</p>\n<p>\n\t<strong>“Disposable”</strong> (“Desechable,” Carlos Gómez-Salamanca, Colombia, Spain)<br />In this animated revenge thriller, a biochemist-turned-junkie transforms into El Colibrí, an assassin targeting corruption after losing his only companion—his dog. “A brutal, hallucinatory journey through violence, grief, and resistance,” says Gómez-Salamanca. A co-production between Jaibo Films (“My Grandmother’s House) and Nocroma Estudio, currently in production. Backed by ICAA, FDC, TVE and ECAM Incubator.</p>\n<p>\n\t<strong>“Holy Relief” </strong>(“Santo Alivio,” Maritza Blanco and Iván Onatra, Colombia)<br />Set in an early 19th-century convent, this provocative erotic comedy follows cloistered nuns who discover that divine pleasure—specifically, masturbation—is the most effective remedy for treating the mutilated bodies and tortured minds of dying soldiers. “This is a transgressive film that, through laughter, confronts us with ideas both pleasurably uncomfortable and socially taboo,” says co-writer and producer Maritza Blanco of Dessu Prods. Filming is projected for the first half of 2027. Colombian funding covers 35% of budget.\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\t<strong>“It Was Her Idea”</strong> (“Fue idea de ella,” Lucas Mirvois and Azul Lombardía, Argentina, Spain)</p>\n<p>\n\tCurrently in advanced development, “It Was Her Idea” follows a couple whose dreams of parenthood and success spiral when they attempt blackmail after catching their neighbor’s affair via drone — only to get pulled into an awkward friendship after a freak accident. “What makes it unique is its blend of domestic espionage with heartfelt comedy,” says producer Lucas Mirvois of La Maldita, with offices in Spain and Argentina. In advanced script development.</p>\n<div>\n<figure>\n<p><img srcset=\"https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/LuxNoctis_6bf89e.jpeg 2048w, https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/LuxNoctis_6bf89e.jpeg?resize=150,63 150w, https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/LuxNoctis_6bf89e.jpeg?resize=300,126 300w\" src=\"https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/LuxNoctis_6bf89e.jpeg?w=1024\" alt=\"\" />\n\t</p>\n<figcaption>\n\t\t\t\t\t<span>Lux Noctis, Courtesy of Maligno Gorehouse</span>\n\t</figcaption>\n</figure>\n</div>\n<p>\n\t<strong>Lux Noctis</strong> (Maligno Gorehouse, Mexico)<br />Set in a matriarchal community where women create light to survive darkness, Lina’s forbidden love challenges brutal rituals. Producers Javier Sepúlveda and Eduardo Lecuona say, “Lux Noctis is a genre redefining work of dystopian folk horror… Through Damiana’s uncompromising vision, a wordless and desolate world emerges… reminding global audiences that even in darkness, hope endures.” Filming is planned for summer 2026. Maligno Gorehouse (“Huesera”) produces.</p>\n<div>\n<figure>\n<p><img srcset=\"https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/OffBalanceTiempo_Fuera_image.001.jpeg 1920w, https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/OffBalanceTiempo_Fuera_image.001.jpeg?resize=150,84 150w, https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/OffBalanceTiempo_Fuera_image.001.jpeg?resize=300,169 300w, https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/OffBalanceTiempo_Fuera_image.001.jpeg?resize=125,70 125w, https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/OffBalanceTiempo_Fuera_image.001.jpeg?resize=1000,563 1000w, https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/OffBalanceTiempo_Fuera_image.001.jpeg?resize=910,511 910w, https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/OffBalanceTiempo_Fuera_image.001.jpeg?resize=681,383 681w, https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/OffBalanceTiempo_Fuera_image.001.jpeg?resize=450,253 450w, https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/OffBalanceTiempo_Fuera_image.001.jpeg?resize=250,140 250w\" src=\"https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/OffBalanceTiempo_Fuera_image.001.jpeg?w=1024\" alt=\"\" />\n\t</p>\n<figcaption>\n\t</figcaption>\n</figure>\n</div>\n<p>\n\t<strong>Off Balance</strong> (“Tiempo fuera,” Pedro Levati, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/twins-latin-films/\">Twins Latin Films</a>, Amada Contents, Argentina)</p>\n<p>\n\tSofía (played by Belen Cuesta) inherits a modest basketball club after her husband’s death, sparking a journey blending dance and sport that leads to self-discovery. Silvina Dell’Occhio of Torneos says, “It is the kind of content we want to be part of: a story balancing sensitivity, humor and broad appeal, combining strong artistic vision, high production values and sports at its core.” In development.</p>\n<p>\n\t<strong>“Sunward Hell” </strong>(“Ruta al Sol,” Jorge Leyva, La Tuerca Films, Mexico)<br />A folk horror thriller where Sara, a doubting preacher, and her friends confront a savage pagan whose secrets could unleash the Final Judgment. Jorge Leyva says, “’Ruta al Sol’ was born from a personal wound… confronting audiences with an unsettling question: in the face of absolute evil, what would I do?” Won two Blood Window prizes at Ventana Sur. Filming is planned for early 2026. Company finances via private and public funds, through co-productions, incentives and strategic partners.</p>\n<p>\n\t<strong>“The Infinite Life”</strong> (“La vida infinita,” Marina Seresesky, Spain)<br />Four years after her son’s disappearance, a grieving mother travels to Latin America, convinced she’s found his reincarnation. “Our protagonist’s journey is both physical and mental; her life will take a 180-degree turn, and all her beliefs will be called into question,” say Seresesky and producer Álvaro Lavín. A suspense-driven emotional thriller from Meridional Producciones, now seeking co-production partners. Backed by Spanish tax incentives.\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\t<strong>“The Jump Into the Void” </strong>(“El salto al vacío,” Oriol Gispert and Toni Comas, Spain, Germany)<br />In development, this docu-fiction hybrid revisits the tragic story of Yelena Miróshina, the Russian diver who won silver at the 1992 Barcelona Olympics and died under mysterious circumstances three years later. “This is a never-before-told story about elite athletes—specifically divers—who suffered severe post-Olympic consequences,” says Oriol Gispert. “It offers a new lens to explore mental health.” Producers: La Lupa Prods, 3Cat, Moviestar Plus+ and Germany’s Ravir Media. Filming is planned for 2026.</p>\n<p>\n\t<strong>The Legend of Don Juan Manuel</strong> (<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/black-sheep-productions/\">Black Sheep Productions</a>, Spain, Mexico)<br />Based on a true story, an aristocrat close to the Viceroy of New Spain begins a series of murders in 1637 Mexico City, exploiting his status to avoid justice. “What makes Don Juan Manuel unique is how it blends a gripping historical setting with a deeply psychological thriller. It’s not only a story of jealousy and obsession, but also a reflection on power, madness and the darkness within. The combination of period authenticity and universal human conflict sets this project apart,” says producer Mónica Aguirre. Currently in development with plans to film in the Basque Country and Jalisco.</p>\n<p>\n\t<strong>“There is No Surf in Mars”</strong> (“No hay surf en Marte,” Hernán Zin, Spain, Brazil)</p>\n<p>\n\tWritten by Diego Betancor, produced by Doc Land Films, a doc-fiction hybrid by Emmy, Goya, Grammy-nominated Hernán Zin who’s been to at least 80 territories as a war correspondent and documentarian, including war torn Afghanistan, Gaza, Rwanda and Syria.

Creator Horacio Alcalá (“Finlandia,” “A ras de cielo”) partners with The Aurora Project (Spain), Belgium’s Ginger Pictures (“The Kingdom”) and Mexico’s The Maestros. Supported by Ibermedia, Torino Film Lab and the García Márquez Prize, it mixes heist mechanics, social satire and the high stakes of privilege.</p>\n<p>\n\t<strong>“La Negra Dominga,”</strong> (Mónica Dopico, Spain)<br />A 4×45’ thriller written by former National Police officer Mónica Dopico and produced by Paloma Mora at TV ON Producciones (“Favàritx”) alongside Admirable Films.

Based on the best-selling trilogy by Finnish-born Iceland-based author Satu Rämö, the show is lighter, more human than the traditional Nordic noir, with the main characters – Icelandic police officer Hildur – finding solace in surfing, as revealed in the first image, and her Finnish sidekick Jakob in knitting.\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\tIn the English/Scandinavian-language crime thriller, main character Hildur carries a trauma, the unsolved disappearance of her two sisters on their way from school 25 years earlier. Now back in her hometown in Iceland, the cop (played by Ebba Katrín Finnsdóttir of “Vigdís,” “Reykjavík 112”) is drawn into the investigation of a series of crimes, flanked by unlikely allies: Finnish trainee officer Jakob (Lauri Tilkanen of “Deadwind”) and the German recruit Florian (Rick Okon of “Das Boot,” “Sisi 4”) mistakenly assigned to her team. \n</p>\n<p>\n\t“What grabbed us initially when we were looking to pick up the series was the compelling and original narrative of the show,” said Tom Misselbrook, Cineflix Rights’ SVP, scripted sales and development, about the six-part series, produced by Finland’s <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/take-two-studios/\">Take Two Studios</a> and Iceland’s <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/sagafilm/\">Sagafilm</a> (“The Minister,” “Stella Blómkvist.” “It takes place in an incredibly atmospheric setting in the Westfjords of Iceland, and has a strong, but troubled detective, Hildur, at the heart of the story. “</p>\n<p>\n\t“Hildur is a Nordic crime thriller with a point of difference that we haven’t seen before,” insisted the TV executive. “It embraces the concept of Nordic Blue, leaning into the genre of a gripping police thriller, but also has a levity to it. It doesn’t just promise crime and mystery but also explores bigger themes of friendship, familial bonds, love and humor and the emotional fallout of loss. So, this genre mix ensures it feels distinct and appeals beyond pure crime thriller fans. \n\t</p>\n<p>\n\tBeyond the material itself, Misselbrook said “the IP also stood out to us in a big way, adapted from Satu Ramo’s bestselling Hildur trilogy which has sold over 1 million copies in 22 territories. So, we recognised that the IP had a large pre-existing fanbase and the show is pre-built to reach a wide audience.”</p>\n<p>\n\tOne of the first on board to tackle the TV adaptation, seasoned scribe and crime author himself Matti Laine (“<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/2020/tv/global/the-paradise-screenwriter-matti-laine-on-riitta-havukainen-ran-tellem-finnish-drama-1203470554/\">The Paradise</a>,” “Bordertown”) said he was among the 600,000+ Finns who had read Rämö’s novels when approached by Take Two. “It was obvious why people loved the book – the combination of the main character Hildur, her backstory, her passions, her life in the remote little Icelandic town of Ísafjörður, the Finnish police offer who is a great sidekick for her. Then the Nordic Blue crime is fresh; character-driven more than whodunnit, with the icy landscape making it blue, not noir.”</p>\n<p>\n\tIcelandic co-writer Margret Örnolfsdóttir (“Trapped,” “<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/2019/film/global/goteborg-margret-ornolfsdottir-drills-down-the-flatey-enigma-1203117863/\">The Flatey Enigma</a>”), said her initial reaction was slightly different from Laine as the first book in the “Hildur” series wasn’t yet published in Iceland when she was asked to come on board.</p>\n<div>\n<figure>\n<p><img srcset=\"https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Hildur-courtesy-Cineflix-TakeTwo-Bjorgvin-Hilmarsson-1.jpg 1200w, https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Hildur-courtesy-Cineflix-TakeTwo-Bjorgvin-Hilmarsson-1.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Hildur-courtesy-Cineflix-TakeTwo-Bjorgvin-Hilmarsson-1.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Hildur-courtesy-Cineflix-TakeTwo-Bjorgvin-Hilmarsson-1.jpg?resize=1000,667 1000w, https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Hildur-courtesy-Cineflix-TakeTwo-Bjorgvin-Hilmarsson-1.jpg?resize=910,607 910w, https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Hildur-courtesy-Cineflix-TakeTwo-Bjorgvin-Hilmarsson-1.jpg?resize=681,454 681w, https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Hildur-courtesy-Cineflix-TakeTwo-Bjorgvin-Hilmarsson-1.jpg?resize=450,300 450w, https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Hildur-courtesy-Cineflix-TakeTwo-Bjorgvin-Hilmarsson-1.jpg?resize=250,167 250w\" src=\"https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Hildur-courtesy-Cineflix-TakeTwo-Bjorgvin-Hilmarsson-1.jpg?w=1024\" alt=\"\" />\n\t</p>\n<figcaption>\n\t\t\t\t\t<span>Hildur</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCourtesy of Cineflix, TakeTwo, Bjorgvin Hilmarsson\n\t</figcaption>\n</figure>\n</div>\n<p>\n\t“For me it was mind-blowing to hear about “Hildur”’s success in Finland. In a way, I was a bit sceptical at the beginning about Satu’s own story – a Finnish best-selling author living in Iceland, in the Westfjord region that I know very well. It felt unreal. But then, Satu has indeed been living here 20 years and when I did read the novel I was pleasantly surprised by its authenticity” said Örnolfsdottir.</p>\n<p>\n\tAlso introduced for the first time to the Nordic Blue crime concept, the seasoned Icelandic scribe said it “definitely captures today’s zeitgeist.” “Nordic Noir is déjà vu; people are a bit fed up with the darkness. This [sub-genre] brings us closer to real life and the blue colour is exactly what I’ve experienced in the Westfjords – there is so much light; it can be crazily blue!”</p>\n<p>\n\tDirector Tinna Hrafnsdóttir, (“Descendants,” “Vigdis”) concurs with her Icelandic colleague. “It’s a Nordic Blue because of the backstory of murders, combined with the beautiful relationship between Hildur and Jakob, which is perhaps what I love the most. As a filmmaker, I wanted to emphasize that human connection. But then the Westfjords scenery is a major character in itself,” she added. “It’s an area full of contrasts, with a mix of sadness and beauty as we’ve had quite a few tragic avalanches and people dying there,” she underscored.\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\tAll creatives agreed that reinterpreting the IP and using it mostly as inspiration was quintessential for the TV version. “With any book adaptation, it’s the same – you have to make it yours, especially with crime novels,” noted Örnolfsdottir. “You might love the suspense, but it’s often a slow burner as a read, therefore when adapting it for the screen, you have to rethink it completely. Invent new stuff, add new characters to keep the viewers’ attention going without changing the core elements. The most important is to stay true to the beating heart and universe of the original IP.”</p>\n<p>\n\t“Considering the books’ success in Finland, we could only fail in adapting it, so we decided to distance ourselves from the source material, while staying true to our own vision,” Laine added. “With our show, one of the biggest changes we’ve made is bringing in the character of Florian, which adds flesh and humor.”</p>\n<p>\n\tHrafnsdóttir said she was extremely pleased with the casting of the three main actors Finnsdóttir, Tilkanen and Okon and the natural chemistry between them, visible on screen. She also made sure to physically transform Finnsdóttir “known in Iceland with her long blond hair” to better fit her character. </p>\n<p>\n\t“With my very experienced hair and make-up artist team, we agreed to push Hildur’s traits as a tough cookie on the outside, but with a warm heart. We gave Ebba Katrín short and dark hair. As an actress myself, I know how changing your looks can impact your playing. That was a huge decision.”</p>\n<p>\n\t“One thing I couldn’t control however was the weather,” added the director who said she “prayed” to get some snow. “We didn’t get it every day, but we made it work.”</p>\n<p>\n\tCommenting on the Icelandic-Finnish collaboration, Take Two’s Sara Norberg, one of the executive producers, said it was “very fruitful and quite exceptional.” Underlining that “normally, Iceland and Finland are on the fringes of the core Nordic partnerships, as the smallest of the Nordic nations,” she said “Hildur” was lifted to the highest production standard, with a budget of €1 million ($1.1 million) per episode, thanks to Sagafilm’s extensive experience and the backing from Nelonen Media in Finland, Siminn in Iceland, private venture funder <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://ipr.vc/\">IPR.VC</a> and Cineflix Rights that entered at an early stage.\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\tThe show is scheduled to air early 2026 on Nelonen’s streamer Ruutu in Finland. </p>\n<p>\n\tMisselbrook said so far Cineflix Rights has received strong interest from buyers and he hopes to announce first pre-sales shortly. “At Mipcom, we’ll be introducing our buyers to the series in a more detailed way at pitch meetings, including some behind the scenes footage and it will have a major marketing presence on our stand. We will then have the first two episodes to follow immediately after the market,” he said.</p>\n<p>\n\tAt a time when buyers are “increasingly risk averse”, having “recognisable genres with a point of difference, ideally adapted from exciting IP and with first-class talent in front of and behind the camera” is what Cineflix strives to source,” added the sales executive, citing two other strong shows on Cineflix’s Mipcom lineup: the RTÉ/BBC drama “The Walsh Sisters” based on Marian Keyes’ multi-million copy selling books, and the Australian crime comedy “Sunny Nights” starring Will Forte (“The Four Seasons,” “Last Man on Earth”) and D’Arcy Carden (“Nobody Wants This”).</p>\n</div>"

With the help of a Spanish hermit, Cícero Guzmán, she defies orders to pursue a psychopath across rain-soaked Lisbon.  \n\t</p>\n<p>\n\tPortuguese actress Helena Caldeira (“Turn of the Tide”) leads the cast. Gascon will direct from a script co-written with Tordo and Spain’s María Mínguez (“Custodia compartida”).\n</p>\n<p>\n\tSet to shoot in 2026 across Spain’s Valencia and Portugal’s Cascais and Lisbon, the project has secured support from Portuguese pubcaster RTP, Pic Portugal cash rebates and Spain’s Instituto Valenciano de Cultura. </p>\n<p>\n\t“Past Waters” project was first introduced at Conecta Fiction 2024 and later selected for Serielizados’ Mind the Gap, building industry momentum ahead of Iberseries.</p>\n<p>\n\t“We’re thrilled to bring ‘Past Waters’ to the screen with RTP and TV ON, especially with talents like João Tordo, Bruno Gascon and María Mínguez on board,” said Joana Domingues, a producer at Caracol Studios.</p>\n<p>\n\t“Based on Tordo’s bestselling novel, this gripping thriller features complex characters and a story with global appeal, uniting top talent from Portugal and Spain.”\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\tThe series’ long-term potential is underlined by Paloma Mora, CEO of TV ON:  “This first season adapts the opening novel of João Tordo’s trilogy, with the possibility of continuing with future installments. Presenting the series at Iberseries is a great opportunity to complete financing and position the project internationally.”</p>\n<p>\n\tGascon, known for Portuguese features such as “Carga” and “Sombra” and series “Irreversíbel,” described “Past Waters” as more than a procedural, calling it “a psychological thriller that blends crime investigation with a portrait of resilience and strength in the face of darkness.”</p>\n<p>\n\tTordo’s growing credits also include RTP dramas “O Segredo de Miguel Zuzarte,” “Filhos do Rock” and “País Irmão,” as well as Netflix Portugal’s breakout “Turn of the Tide,” aka “Rabo de Peixe.”</p>\n</div>"

Colbert then told his wife, who was adamant that he tell his staff as soon as possible.\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\t“She said, ‘Are you going to tell the staff?'” Colbert recalled. “I said, ‘I don’t know. Maybe I will tell them after the summer break.’ She said, ‘You are going to tell them tomorrow.’ I said, ‘I don’t think so.’ She said, ‘I am coming to work with you tomorrow because I think you are telling your staff.’ I get up in the elevator. I had sweat through my shirt. I didn’t want to know anything my staff didn’t know.”\n</p>\n<p>\n\tAt first, Colbert only told his executive producers so that the rest of the staff wouldn’t be affected while taping. After the episode was shot, Colbert told his crew and the audience, “Nobody leave. We have one more act of the show.”</p>\n<p>\n\t“My stage manager said, ‘We are done,'” Colbert said. “I said, ‘No, there is one more act of the show. Please don’t let the audience go.’ He said, ‘No, boss, we are done.’ I said, ‘I am aware of that. I am here to tell you there is one more act of the show.'”</p>\n<p>\n\tColbert said he was very nervous when going back on stage to deliver the news, made worse by the fact that there was no teleprompter. The late-night host recalls the audience snickering at first, thinking it was a joke. But when he finally said his piece, no one was laughing.\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\t“I was so nervous about doing it,” Colbert explained. “There was nothing on the prompter. I fucked up twice. I had to restart, and the audience thought it was a bit. They started going, ‘You can do it. Come on Steve. You can do it.’ I always messed up on the sentence that told them what was happening. I got to the sentence that told them what was happening, and they didn’t laugh. They didn’t laugh. That is it. That is how I did it.”</p>\n<p>\n\tIn July, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/2025/tv/news/cbs-cancel-late-show-stephen-colbert-financial-decision-1236464356/\">CBS announced</a> that “The Late Show” would be canceled after the next TV season, citing the move as a “financial decision.” Some speculated that the move was actually to appease the FCC and ensure a smooth merger between Paramount, CBS’s parent company, and Skydance Media.</p>\n</div>"

The world premiere drama sees her confront the truth behind her husband’s death. \n\t</p>\n<p>\n\tA high-profile gala is Peter Ho-sun Chan’s “She Has No Name,” which has previously played Cannes, Shanghai and Toronto, starring Zhang Ziyi as a Shanghai housewife accused of her husband’s grisly murder in the 1940s, with Lei Jiayin co-starring. The film revisits one of China’s most notorious unsolved cases.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tTIFF had previously confirmed its opening, centerpiece and closing films, all by marquee directors. <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/2025/film/festivals/everest-tabei-junko-biopic-tokyo-film-festival-1236510716/\">Sakamoto Junji’s “Climbing for Life,” </a>chronicling Everest pioneer Junko Tabei, opens the festival with Yoshinaga Sayuri leading the cast.

Closing the edition is Oscar-winner Chloé Zhao’s “Hamnet,” toplined by Jessie Buckley and Paul Mescal, which dramatizes the loss that inspired Shakespeare’s “Hamlet.”</p>\n<p>\n\tThe competition section blends emerging voices with seasoned auteurs.

    "body": "<div><p>\n\tGoogle and <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/nbcuniversal/\">NBCUniversal</a> inked a short-term extension on their existing carriage deal for <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/youtube-tv/\">YouTube TV</a>, keeping the networks on the service for now as the sides work to hammer out final terms. The announcement came just after their previous pact expired Sept. 30 at midnight ET.</p>\n<p>\n\t“We’ve reached a short-term extension to avoid disruption to our service while we work toward a new agreement with NBCUniversal,” a Google spokesperson said. “We appreciate our subscribers’ patience while we negotiate on their behalf.”\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\tNBCU last week started <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/2025/tv/news/nbcuniversal-youtube-tv-blackout-contract-1236529578/\">warning YouTube TV subs they they might lose access to its networks</a>. Google has claimed that the media company “is asking us to pay more than what they charge consumers for the same content on Peacock, which would mean less flexibility and higher prices for our subscribers.” If NBCU programming content is “unavailable for an extended period of time,” YouTube TV subscribers will be eligible to receive a $10 credit, Google said in a message on its customer-support site.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tAt risk of going dark YouTube TV as a result of the dispute have been <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/nbc/\">NBC</a> shows including “Saturday Night Live,” “The Voice,” “Law & Order,” “Chicago Fire,” “Today” and “The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon” as well as NFL and college football and more, plus cable channels like Bravo, MSNBC, CNBC and USA.</p>\n<p>\n\tEarlier Tuesday evening, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/2025/tv/news/univision-goes-dark-on-youtube-tv-blackout-televisaunivision-1236535360/\">YouTube TV dropped Univision and other TelevisaUnivision networks</a> after the sides were unable to come to terms on a contract renewal. The previous YouTube TV carriage agreement with TelevisaUnivision expired Sept. 30 as well. YouTube TV is offering affected subscribers a $6 credit or refund with the TelevisaUnivision blackout.\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\tThe affected NBCU channels include those that are set to be spun off into Versant, the new company that will house its cable TV properties (with the exception of Bravo). The channels are: NBC local stations; MSNBC; USA; Bravo; Golf Channel; CNBC; Oxygen True Crime; E!; Cozi; Syfy; American Crimes; NBC News Now; and Telemundo and Universo. Also affected are regional sports networks NBC Sports Philadelphia, NBC Sports Bay Area, NBC Sports Boston and NBC Sports California.</p>\n<p>\n\tYouTube TV had an estimated 9.5 million customers as of the end of 2024, according to research firm MoffettNathanson — making it the biggest internet-delivered pay TV provider in the U.S.</p>\n<p>\n\tGoogle has been embroiled in YouTube TV distribution deal disputes with other big programmers this year. After contentious deal talks, YouTube TV and Paramount Global (now Paramount Skydance) renewed their <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/2025/tv/news/paramount-youtube-tv-reach-distribution-deal-averting-blackout-1236309622/\">agreement to carry CBS stations nationwide and more than 20 other channels</a> in February. And Fox Corp. and YouTube TV reached a renewal in August 2025 after a public back-and-forth.</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd four years ago, Google and NBCU had tangled over YouTube TV: In 2021, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/2021/digital/news/nbcu-youtube-tv-reach-deal-1235079414/\">NBCU’s distribution deal for YouTube TV expired</a> but the companies quickly worked out a long-term pact.</p>\n<p>\n\tJustin Connolly, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/2025/tv/news/disney-loses-legal-bid-block-youtube-justin-connolly-hiring-1236418567/\">former head of distribution at Disney</a>, joined YouTube as VP, global head of media this spring. Disney sued YouTube and Connolly, alleging breach of contract and seeking to block his employment at Google, but a California state court rejected Disney’s request. According to Disney’s lawsuit, the media company’s contract for YouTube TV is up for renewal soon.</p>\n<p>\n\t<em>Pictured top: NBC’s “Chicago Fire”</em></p>\n</div>"

    "body": "<div><p>\n\tAlex Rey’s MiraChechu Productions has partnered with Películas Pendelton, the high-profile production company founded by Javier Fesser and Luis Manso (“Champions,” “Championext”), to produce “Sábado Sabadete” (“Saturday Sabadete”), a standout adult animation series pitching this week at <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/iberseries/\">Iberseries</a> & Platino Industria 2025.</p>\n<p>\n\tFor Películas Pendelton, best known for box office smashes and family crowd-pleasers, the move signals a sharp turn into adult animation, adding heavyweight backing to Rey’s irreverent vision.\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\t“Saturday Sabadete” follows Sabadete, a giant pink axolotl who ruled Spanish TV in the 1980s by humiliating his sidekick Mostachón. \n</p>\n<p>\n\tDecades later, Sabadete is broke and forgotten, plotting a comeback with fellow washed-up TV stars — while facing off against his old partner, now a powerful producer determined to shut him down.</p>\n<p>\n\tRey, who directs, produces and voices all characters, has already delivered a full bible, trailer and pilot episode. The project first caught industry attention at Spain’s Weird Market showcase.</p>\n<p>\n\t“This is an animated series for adults set and rooted in Spain,” Rey told <em>Variety</em>. “For years we’ve consumed shows like ‘South Park’ or ‘Family Guy’ from the U.S., but never one that reflects our own culture. There’s a huge audience waiting for a Spanish voice in this space.”</p>\n<p>\n\tFounded in 2005, MiraChechu Productions began as Rey’s one-man creative vehicle, scripting, animating and voicing shorts that earned national and international prizes. His “Pobre Marciano” screened at the Ottawa Festival, one of the world’s top animation meetings. \n\t</p>\n<div>\n<figure>\n<p><img srcset=\"https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Imagen1H-1.jpg 1200w, https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Imagen1H-1.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Imagen1H-1.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Imagen1H-1.jpg?resize=1000,667 1000w, https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Imagen1H-1.jpg?resize=910,607 910w, https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Imagen1H-1.jpg?resize=681,454 681w, https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Imagen1H-1.jpg?resize=450,300 450w, https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Imagen1H-1.jpg?resize=250,167 250w\" src=\"https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Imagen1H-1.jpg?w=1024\" alt=\"\" />\n\t</p>\n<figcaption>\n\t\t\t\t\t<span>Saturday Sabadete</span>\n\t</figcaption>\n</figure>\n</div>\n<p>\n\tWith “Saturday Sabadete,” MiraChechu scales up in partnership with Películas Pendelton.</p>\n<p>\n\tLuis Manso’s involvement adds industry heft. Alongside Fesser, he has steered Películas Pendelton to some of Spain’s most distinctive hits, from “The Miracle of P. Tinto” and “Mortadelo and Filemón: Mission Implausible” to the runaway success of “Champions,” which grossed €19.1 million ($22.3 million) in Spain, released by Universal. </p>\n<p>\n\tFor Rey, the alliance marks a leap from indie cult shorts to industrial-scale production, positioning “Saturday Sabadete” as a bold attempt to push adult animation with a local edge onto the global stage.</p>\n<p>\n\t“Sábado Sabadete” will be pitched on Wednesday, Oct. 1, as part of the Co-Production and Financing Forum at Iberseries & Platino Industria 2025 in Madrid. </p>\n</div>"

    "body": "<div><p>\n\tThere are few genres I like less than the snarky violent action comedy. I didn’t care for it much in the ’80s (though “48 HRS.” is splendid popcorn), I liked it even less in the ’90s (though occasionally I would see something like “The Last Boy Scout” or “Rush Hour” that packed a disreputable wallop), and now that the genre has mostly been taken over by the streamers, it seems to have entered its weirdly postmodern and annoying convoluted cookie-cutter phase. But “<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/play-dirty/\">Play Dirty</a>,” directed and co-written by <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/shane-black/\">Shane Black</a> (who wrote “Lethal Weapon” and the famously expensive script for “The Last Boy Scout”), is an action-comedy throwback powered by enough casual violence to inspire more grins and groans. Black, as a director, has made this retro action power cheese his brand, not always successfully (I think “Kiss Kiss Bang Bang” is cloying and overpraised; I really like “The Nice Guys”). But in this case he reminds you of why he’s good at it.\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\t“Play Dirty” is made of standard-issue parts, but it casts <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/mark-wahlberg/\">Mark Wahlberg</a> as Parker, the robber hero of 24 crime novels by Donald E. Westlake (all written under the pseudonym Richard Stark), and the film’s lethal pop-cutout version of Parker is enough of a borderline sociopath to hold our interest. Casual killings at point-blank range, vicious motorcycle jackings, tossing someone off a building, assassinating the actual Mark Cuban (playing himself) — this, in the movie, is what the <em>good</em> guys do. That it’s all set at Christmas is a bit of a tired joke (the whole “Die Hard” as Yuletide classic thing<em>. Merry Christmas, motherfucker!</em>), but every time you’re ready to give up on “Play Dirty,” it ups the body count in just the right holly jolly way. The movie can, at times, feel like a half-hearted “Ocean’s” sequel crossed with “National Treasure,” but there’s a what-the-hell-we’ll-kill-you nasty bite to it.\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\tMost action comedies throw disparate elements into the blender to create a junk-movie smoothie: Here are some car chases, some patter, some sex, some gunplay, some formula plotting. But Shane Black approaches this mongrel of a commercial genre as if it were an art form. He’s trying to turn a dog-food recipe into haute cuisine. The film opens with Parker and his crew engaged in a horse-track robbery, holding everyone in the back office hostage as they enter the safe, and when the plan goes awry — a parking attendant thinks he’s going to rob the robbers — they wind up escaping in a car chase that spills out onto the track, resulting in an action dance of vehicles and horses and flying jockeys that evokes the insanity of the opening sequence of Brian De Palma’s “The Fury.”</p>\n<p>\n\tEvery bit as jolting is what occurs when they get back to the hideout with the loot. Zen (Rosa Salazar), a saboteur, reveals herself by stripping down to her undies and then whipping out a gun and killing everyone there (except for Parker, who can just about dodge a bullet). The flippancy with which these characters are made to bite the dust establishes the film’s combustible tone.</p>\n<p>\n\tWahlberg, still sleek at 54, and cool as a dozen cucumbers, comes on like the more natural version of what Tom Cruise tried to bring off (and never quite did, in my estimation) in the Jack Reacher films. He simply wasn’t cutthroat enough, but Wahlberg has never lost that stoic Boston B-boy glint. His Parker, who will kill you in a heartbeat, goes on the hunt for Zen, who was once part of a South American dictator’s elite guard unit, and when he locates her, the two join forces to bring off a heist (though he’s got his own reasons for entering into the partnership). They will steal the sunken treasure from a 15th-century Spanish galleon, notably the golden figurehead on the prow — a statue of the Lady of Arintero. Tony Shaloub, cast against type, is the dyspeptic corporate criminal who has himself arranged to steal the Lady and sell it to an “asshole billionaire” (Chukwudi Iwuji).</p>\n<p>\n\tIt’s locked in a security cage made of a tungsten/carbon alloy, which sounds just old-fashioned enough to have come out of the pre-tech ’80s. “Play Dirty” is an alloy too — a tongue-wagging/car-crash alloy that might feel every bit as old as the films it’s evoking if it weren’t for Shane Black’s attitude of nihilistic nonchalance. It’s there in the most tossed-off jokes, like when Keegan-Michael Key, as part of Parker’s new crew, turns the dial up on a console that controls a speeding subway train, saying, “We’re at 30 m.p.h…35 m.p.h…,” and Claire Lovering, as his partner in crime, says, “Stop saying m.p.h.”\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\tIt’s also there in the casual viciousness of the scene where Wahlberg and <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/lakeith-stanfield/\">LaKeith Stanfield</a>, as a criminal associate who’s so laidback he’s almost floating on air (until his anger explodes, at which point you need to duck for cover), try to get Shaloub’s sleazy bitcoin-obsessed assistant (Nat Wolff) to tell them where the Lady of Arintero is. Though they’ve got him at gunpoint, he’s literally too scared to tell them because he thinks they’re going to throw <em>him</em> off a building. (He’s right to be worried.) That extra dollop of destruction is what makes the film funny and gives it momentum.</p>\n<p>\n\tHow good/not good a movie is “Play Dirty”? Released by Amazon MGM, it’s 10 times better than your average Netflix action espionage caper, but it’s also an overloaded, functionally lit slab of action-heist formula on steroids. “The Nice Guys” was a more stylish Shane Black caper. Yet there’s something compelling about how Wahlberg’s Parker is less invested in the heist than he is in maintaining his lone-wolf status. I could easily sit through another installment of Wahlberg holding down the center of his own cut-rate “Mission: Irascible.”</p>\n</div>"
