    "body": "<div><p>\n\tSpain, in a way, has its own “Adolescence.” No company can hope to break out in their wildest dreams as the Netflix U.K. drama.</p>\n<p>\n\tNonetheless, where comparison can be drawn with Spanish series “Puberty” (“Pubertad”), <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/leticia-dolera/\">Leticia Dolera</a>’s follow-up as a creator to her top Canneseries prize winner “Perfect Life,” is that “Puberty” also focuses on the issue of teen violence, here filtered through the lens of adolescent sexual abuse.\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\tSold by <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/beta-film/\">Beta Film</a> and to be released in Spain and Portugal by <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/hbo-max/\">HBO Max</a> on Sept. 24, “Puberty” was presented by Dolera and producer Miriam Porté at a high-profile press conference Monday, Sept. 22, at Spain’s San Sebastián Film Festival, where Dolera walked an industry audience through three emblematic scenes from the six-part series.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tPorté recalled at the press conference that the project began with Dolera, whose early commitment allowed development to move forward. Once it had taken shape, the team turned to Catalonia’s cultural authorities. “Because this is not a series in Catalan, somehow it’s like a natural gateway, so they were the first to support the project,” she said. That support was quickly followed by Francisco Vargas, director of the audiovisual area at ICEC, who, Porté noted, “immediately understood that ambitious, large-scale, quality series needed support, and they supported us.” TV3 and 3CAT soon came on board. “It would have been impossible without HBO, totally impossible,” she added, describing the financing process as “very complex.”</p>\n<p>\n\tIn the first clip, Julia, a single mother and successful feminist journalist, and her teen son eat lunch with her father Marti Sr., (Lluís Marco) head of a local human tower collective in a small town in Catalonia, and Martí her brother played by Xavi Sáez, who will take over the group given the father’s illness. Martí Sr. is spoiling for an argument with Julia, its catalyst comes when the mother mentions in conciliatory fashion that there’s now even a feminist human pyramid. “Even with that, you lot aren’t happy,” spits Martí Sr. Julia rises to the bait. “Maybe they [feminists] have motives,” she answers back. “The kid needs a male reference,” Martí retorts. Julia’s son looks uncomfortable. Then Pol, Martí’s macho young teen son, turns up, who obviously won’t get on with Julia’s boy. \n\t</p>\n<p>\n\t“The series has multiple layers,” Dolera tells <em>Variety.</em> “One is legacy, in many ways. One is cultural and patriarchal, another family-based and psychological. All the psychological inheritance, taboos, how masculinity models pass from father to son and grandson.”</p>\n<p>\n\tBy this time, the series has already shown the local castle team, rehearsing for a competition the next day. Why did Dolera set “Puberty” in a small Catalan town in the world of human tower builders? “The human towers reflect a society, how you have to work as a group,” she said. “Societies aren’t created by individualized stay-at-home members. Creating a castle means meeting people, doing something together, where values, structures, ethical consensus come into play. Today, that seems almost revolutionary — the human trust. If the castle isn’t well built, it will fall, because it’s fragile, like communities. So the human towers are a beautiful paradigm of human beings, of their light and shade, their contradictions.”</p>\n<p>\n\tThe second clip sees Julia meeting with Estel, a friend played by Betsy Túrnez (“The 47”), who recalls an incident when she was a teen with a boy, Ortiz, who wanted sex. She refused. He suggested oral sex instead. She didn’t want to, but went along. “This isn’t a case of crime, but an area which can generate wounds, traumas, in both parties,” Dolera explained. Later we see the incident marked Estel’s self-esteem, while Ortiz’s perception of women and sexuality is also warped.</p>\n<p>\n\tMeanwhile, rumors build on social media that three teens in the castells team are involved in a sexual aggression case. In a third scene, the group debates what to do. Some want to go to the police. Others worry that going public will cost sponsors. Another reason for Martí’s caution may be that his son Pol is one of the accused. “The scene shows, above all, the confusion suffered by adults, who don’t know how to address the subject. It’s a key, centerpiece scene in the series,” Dolera said.</p>\n<p>\n\tThat confusion reflects a broader generational disconnect, Dolera suggested: “So, I think it’s about reflecting as a community on this problem that I believe is already blowing up in our faces, because I have the feeling that there are generations of kids who have grown up with a phone in their hands, and whose parents are a bit lost, also absorbed by a capitalist system that increasingly swallows them up and demands more of their time at work to pay for housing, to pay for a lot of things, right?”\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\t“Puberty” is produced by Porté’s Distinto Films and Corte y Confección y Uri Films, both headed by Oriol Maymó, two of Catalonia’s most successful companies.</p>\n<p>\n\tLaunched by Miriam Porté, Barcelona-based Distinto Films is behind Berlin 2025 Panorama Audience Award winner “Deaf,” SXSW best performance laureate “Mamífera” and Lucía Aleñar’s “Forastera,” which just over a week ago scooped a Toronto Fipresci International Critics’ Prize for Emerging Filmmakers.</p>\n<p>\n\tMaymó produced Cannes Jury Prize winner “Sirât,” series “Vida Perfecta” and “La Línea Invisible” as well as Sundance-selected “Buried” and took a production credit on “[REC 3] Genesis” and “[REC 4] Apocalypse.”</p>\n<p>\n\tDistinto Films and Maymó’s Uri Films produce “Puberty” with Brussels’ AT-Prod. Go-ahead Catalan public broadcaster 3Cat co-produces.</p>\n</div>"

    "body": "<div><p>\n\tAs one of the five Films to Come at this year’s Incubator program of the Madrid Film School (ECAM), “Face of Grace” (“Cara de santa”) features a host of women behind the camera. It will be co-helmed by Anna Martí Domingo and Laura Santos Martí and produced by Mayca Sanz of Allegra Films and Laura Rubirola of Nocturna Pictures.</p>\n<p>\n\tThe project focuses on a subject matter close to their hearts, born organically out of conversations around a theme that has deeply unsettled them and raised many questions.\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\t“A lot of these questions came from talking with our mothers and reflecting on their place in the world. That’s where the film originates — from that intergenerational dialogue between our generation and the generation of women born in the 1960s. Although the story is fictional, they were undeniably a key starting point for its creation,” say Domingo and Santos Marti.  \n</p>\n<p>\n\t“Face of Grace” follows 63-year-old Dolores who as a teacher, a wife and mother has always lived up to expectations. Her life in Barcelona is stable but suffocating: a dull marriage, a grown son about to make her a grandmother, and yet another Christmas far from her hometown. </p>\n<p>\n\tOn Christmas Eve, something snaps. After feeling provoked, she assaults a man in public — an impulsive, violent act that seems completely out of character. Suddenly, she’s thrust into a hostile system that puts her sanity and womanhood on trial. The world says she’s lost control, but something deeper has been set in motion.</p>\n<p>\n\tAsked how they plan to split the directing tasks between them, the answer comes easy to them.\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\t“Each of us brings our own personal experience in the industry and our individual background, which turn out to be very complementary when it comes to directing,” they say. Domingo’s has had some directing experience, having made the short “Nens,” which played at Valladolid’s Seminci last year, and has had more experience in directing actors. Santos Marti, on the other hand, was the production designer behind such lauded films as “Salve María” by Mar Coll, and has a stronger command of the formal aspects — the visual style and the camera.</p>\n<p>\n\tWhile it will be the first time for them to co-direct a feature, they’ve worked together on the same sets. The project took shape when they were selected for the Feature Film Script Residency at the prestigious EICTV – International Film and Television School of Cuba.</p>\n<p>\n\t“The idea was in a very early stage, and that residency helped solidify it. Thanks to the guidance of the mentors and the sessions we received, we left with a strong foundation that became the starting point for what the film is today. The way the school approaches screenwriting — their vision and methodology — is something we’ve carried with us ever since, and we’re not letting it go. It was an incredible and enriching experience,” they say.</p>\n<p>\n\tFor producing partners Sanz and Rubirola, the project captivated them at once. “We were deeply intrigued by the questions it raises and the debate it can spark. “‘Face of Grace’<em> </em>is a film that shines a light on society’s reaction when the rules that govern our coexistence are broken, and a physical aggression is used as a response to a perceived offense. Specifically: how does society react when the rule-breaker is a woman? Is she judged the same way as a man? And what happens when that woman is a social pillar, a schoolteacher?” they say.</p>\n<p>\n\t“The seemingly inexplicable violent outburst of a 63-year-old educator and mother puts both her sanity and her place in the community on trial. At the same time, it reveals the everyday frustrations many women of a certain age face—and how they are seen by their children and society at large,” they reflect.</p>\n<p>\n\tAt the moment, the project has the development support of the Catalan Goverment’s <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/icec/\">ICEC</a> in Catalonia as well as the resources provided by ECAM’s Incubator, which has allowed them to participate in Focus Coproduction at Cannes and the EAVE marketing training.\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\t“We also hope to secure production support from ICEC, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/icaa/\">ICAA</a>, public broadcasters and streaming platforms, as well as bring on a European partner to access <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/eurimages/\">Eurimages</a> and additional funds to complete the production,” the producers say.</p>\n<p>\n\tPrincipal photography will take place in Barcelona, which plays a pivotal role in the story. “We want to portray Barcelona at Christmas, which is the time frame in which Dolores’s story unfolds. We hope to begin filming in the winter of 2026-2027,” say Domingo and Santos Marti.</p>\n</div>"

    "body": "<div><p>\n\tJust two editions in, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/noka-ekoizpena/\">Noka Ekoizpena</a>, a women-focused mentorship and production-acceleration program based in San Sebastián, is beginning to deliver on its promise: to help Basque and Navarrese female directors and producers push late-stage features over the line into production.</p>\n<p>\n\tFunded by the Basque Government through <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/zineuskadi/\">Zineuskadi</a> and backed by Creative Europe Media, the program works hand-in-glove with other regional entities such as the San Sebastián Film Festival Industry Office and Ikusmira Berriak, offering a structured path from script development to financing. Each receives intensive support across five modules — script doctoring, budgeting, legal frameworks, funding applications, and production planning — plus a €4,000 ($4,640) stipend, one-on-one mentorship, and exposure at Spain’s indie industry showcase Abycine Lanza.\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\tEarly results are promising. From its inaugural edition, “Canción Animal” is moving into production with CSC Films and an international co-producer, while “La Koreana” is looks likely to be backed by a major Spanish company, after runs at Porto/Post/Doc, Berlinale Visitors and San Sebastián’s Ikusmira Berriak residency, where 2023 San Sebastián winner Estíbaliz Urresola boarded as a producer.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tFor directors, the program has proved both a creative reset and a market launchpad. “I hadn’t planned on working so much on the script,” director María Monreal told <em>Variety</em> “but that turned out to be necessary too, and it has helped me a lot to better understand the film and know what I want to tell.” She is now seeking a lead producer and international co-production partners, targeting meetings at this year’s San Sebastián Festival.\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\tHer producing partner, Laura Lizuma, a Latvian-born industry professional who has lived in the Basque Country for over a decade, said Noka had allowed her to re-anchor herself in the local sector. “Presenting at SSIFF will be a decisive moment, as we are looking for a majority producer to take it forward,” she told <em>Variety</em>..</p>\n<p>\n\tJoana Moya, director of “La Koreana,” has found the scheme transformational. “Noka was the springboard that launched and positioned the project, not only within Basque cinema but also on broader stages such as Abycine Lanza,” she said. The program’s collaborative model also blurred the lines between tutor and partner: “The tutors ended up joining the team: Estíbaliz Urresola came on board as producer and Rocío Mesa continues to accompany the project from Andalusia.”</p>\n<p>\n\tFellow participant Zaira Zanguitu, director of “Pajarracos,” described the lab’s support in more metaphorical terms: “A workshop is like a long bike ride; it’s not the same if you have a battery…. Writing is a solitary activity, but Noka has been a collaborative space.”</p>\n<p>\n\tMentorship has been key. The second edition tutors include award-winning director Mar Coll and producer Valérie Delpierre, alongside Itsaso Arana and Chelo Loureiro, all contributing creative and production know-how as well as longer-term professional alliances.</p>\n<p>\n\tFor Nerea Castro, director of “Canción Animal,” Noka’s role was clear: “Thanks to Noka, I carried out a deep rewrite that allowed me to capture the essence of the film. The dossier also improved significantly, and it helped me sharpen both my vision and my way of communicating the story.” That project is now in casting, with Flor&Txabe searching for a lead actress and Basque singer-composer Ana Arsuaga already writing original songs.</p>\n<p>\n\tMore generally, there is a strong and growing sense of solidarity between participants. “I think there’s cinema of very high quality being made in Spain, and this new generation of women directors has a lot to do with that.” Monreal said: “I feel proud of what we are achieving in terms of equality in the sector, even though there’s still a long way to go.”</p>\n<p>\n\tWith both of its first-edition projects now advancing to production, new titles poised to enter financing rounds, and major producers boarding at an early stage, Noka Ekoizpena is positioning itself as a notable accelerator designed not just to mentor but to deliver women-led films to production.</p>\n</div>"

    "body": "<div><p>\n\tNorwegian auteur <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/joachim-trier/\">Joachim Trier</a> got honest about fatherhood during an in-depth conversation event at the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/san-sebastian-film-festival-2/\">San Sebastián Film Festival</a>. In the Basque city to present his Cannes-winning drama “<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/sentimental-value/\">Sentimental Value</a>” — Norway’s official entry for the best international feature film Oscar race — the director was asked how he “relates” to the film’s main character, Gustav Borg. The fictional film director played by Stellan Skarsgård is professionally renowned but emotionally distant, having traded a healthy relationship with his two daughters for a lauded career in film. \n\t</p>\n<p>\n\t“You’re asking a big question,” pointed out the director. “This is the first film I made while having two children. I said going in, ‘I’m really scared of failing as a father,’ and it’s very symbolic to make this film for me because I don’t want to be Borg. We shot in Oslo, I could go home every night, and that was a big deal for me. That was one of the big achievements of this film for me, too.”\n</p>\n<p>\n\t“I was longing to have children,” continued Trier before pivoting into commenting about how feminist advancements in Norway changed the way parents work on set — both male and female. “We’ve had a lot of progression [with] female directors over the last 15, 20 years. That has been great for us male directors too because we have gotten a focus on good set culture where the macho energy is lessened. It’s not just tough guys but also private conversations about balancing being an artist with the demands on you as a director, and also having children.”</p>\n<p>\n\t“The feminist discourse around cinema has helped men allow ourselves this bigger freedom of figuring out open conversations around how we make movies,” he highlighted, before adding that he feels he is an “okay father even though I’m a film director.”\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\tThe filmmaker said he was being “very personal” with his answer to the question because he felt it was an “important one,” especially given he had children later in life and wanted to be a “responsible parent.” Trier recalled a moment during the pre-production phase of “Sentimental Value” when assistant director Lars Thomas told him to leave the office to catch his daughter’s kindergarten play. “Just run now. You don’t want to be Gustav Borg,” said Thomas. “I saw the play and wept because she was great. I’m being a bit cheesy here, forgive me, but those things matter.”</p>\n<p>\n\tTrier’s preoccupations with a healthy set are also a testament to his directing philosophy. When speaking about his role on set, the filmmaker said his job is to sit next to the camera and show actors “love.” “It sounds cheesy, but it really is. And if I’m not open to the possibility of the unexpected, we won’t create something that has life.”</p>\n<p>\n\t“The directorial position is so often this man of power,” he reiterated. “It’s macho bullshit. I feel the opposite. Yes, I will have to lead the team and make up my mind and be quick, but ultimately, it’s a humble position of just gratitude. Like, ‘O.K., we are going to try this thing and we could fuck it up but I believe in you.’ That’s what matters. Outside the set, we’ve got to do a lot of fighting to get the money and make sure no one steps on our creativity, but on set we have to be humble towards the actors.”</p>\n<p>\n\tThe Norwegian auteur also retains full control creatively outside of the set, emphasizing that he won’t negotiate his final cut rights. “I’ve had [final cut] since film one,” he said when recalling how he spent some time in the U.S. following the success of his 2006 debut “Reprise,” which got picked up by Miramax and did well outside of Europe. When Trier tried to make his sophomore feature in the U.S. afterwards, he realized the industry post the 2008 crisis was not as open to creative autonomy and auteurship as they were in the late ’90s, when major studios launched independent labels and placed their chips on more daring filmmakers. </p>\n<p>\n\t“To me, it’s a moral implication of taking responsibility for what the actors give a director,” he added of final cut. “If they show their emotions, their bodies, I carry the responsibility of what they bring to the final product.” \n\t</p>\n<p>\n\tOnce Trier realized he wouldn’t manage to make his sophomore feature within the U.S. studio system, the director looked back to his home country. The result was “Oslo, August 31st,” which he called a “panic reaction” to taking too long to follow up on his debut. “When I did ‘Reprise,’ 80% of directors only made one film,” he pointed out, adding that his second feature spawned out of a desire to prove he could make a film “really fast.”</p>\n<p>\n\tTrier made a point to emphasize that his English-language debut, “Louder Than Bombs,” might have featured major American talent such as Jesse Eisenberg, but was still made within the European financing model. “I only work in the European financing system, and I’m super happy about it. It’s given me a platform to express myself freely,” he said, noting that this freedom is “constantly under political threat.”</p>\n<p>\n\t“Right-wing political movements are always trying to diminish the idea of soft money support for the arts across most countries in Europe,” he continued. “It’s important that we have a system that protects free expression through the arts. We need support. Most art has always been supported by someone with an intention of not just making money, but supporting artistic expression.”</p>\n<p>\n\tThe director emphasized the importance of the European financing model not only when it comes to production but, vitally, distribution. “I think it’s important to be aware that there are incentives to distribute films between our cultures. So when I grew up watching Pedro Almodóvar’s films, and what [I] like about him is the feeling he has a universe which is his. When I was growing up, I didn’t want to see him go to L.A. and do a heist movie.”</p>\n<p>\n\tNeon will open Joachim Trier’s “Sentimental Value” in limited release on Nov. 7. The San Sebastián Film Festival runs Sept. 19-27</p>\n</div>"

    "body": "<div><p>\n\tIn Rai Marìa’s “The Big Rip,” (“El gran desgarro”), an upcoming film from the Madrid Film School (<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/ecam/\">ECAM</a>) incubator program, aspiring writer Lorena is racing to finish her first novel in time for a prestigious literary prize — her last chance at some glory. Determined to meet the deadline, she isolates herself to focus, but the chaos of everyday life keeps intruding: a broken boiler in Madrid’s scorching summer, her flatmates’ crises, a neglected child next door, and above all, her brother’s spiraling paranoia as he becomes convinced the world is about to end. \n\t</p>\n<p>\n\tStuck on the final chapter, with no inspiration in sight, Lorena’s life begins to mirror the unraveling universe around her.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tFor Maria, “The Big Rip” will be her third feature and her most personal to date. “It cuts through me on every level. I think, in some way, it all began with the depression I experienced some time ago. Turning 40 wasn’t easy, and like the characters in this story, I felt something inside me break open,” she says.</p>\n<p>\n\t“But even though the starting point was dark and painful, I always knew I wanted to make a comedy — an existential comedy — one that would allow me to look at our everyday struggles with humor and tenderness,” she adds.</p>\n<p>\n\t“Not long ago, I realized that everything I do is marked by the idea of destiny,” she mused, adding: “Though each of my films is very different, in all of them I’ve tried to capture the invisible thread between the micro and the macro — that line (that tear) between the intimate, the banal, the everyday… and the transcendent — the moment of revelation.”\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\t“Some of the themes that unsettle me most are present in this film: the housing crisis, the economic and emotional precarity the characters endure. But beyond the themes, what truly interests me is finding what I call ‘the lightning bolt’ — the idea, the concept that cuts through the film and gives it its cinematic shape. Without that bolt, there’s nothing,” she notes.</p>\n<p>\n\tWhile she has filmed in her home region of Extremadura in recent years, Maria plans to shoot in Madrid since much of the story takes place in the working-class neighborhood of Carabanchel. “I’m finally making a film that feels truly contemporary — and unmistakably Madrilenian. The great rupture at the heart of the story could only happen in Madrid,” she says.</p>\n<p>\n\tFor producer Cristina Hergueta of Garde, “The Great Rip” will be her third collaboration with Maria, which began with feature “Karen,” followed by short “La niña mártir,” which went on to win the Gijón Film Festival.</p>\n<p>\n\t“Both works were critically acclaimed and had strong festival runs. Now, we’re ready to take the next step — working together on what will be our most ambitious and expansive film to date,” says Hergueta.</p>\n<p>\n\t“’The Great Rip’ is a natural evolution of our creative journey together. Over these eight years, Rai María and I have built a friendship that goes beyond the professional, allowing us to understand each other perfectly. We have grown side by side as filmmakers and cherish the team we’ve formed,” she adds.</p>\n<p>\n\tAccording to Hergueta, the project is subject to a public funding cap of 75% of the total budget, which allows them to combine public grants with tax incentives. They’ve already secured private investors, and are in discussions with local co-producers as well as actively seeking international partners.</p>\n<p>\n\tCombining their support from the Junta de Extremadura, the ECAM Industry Incubator and confirmed private investment, they’ve already secured 23% of the film’s financing, says Hergueta.</p>\n<p>\n\tAmong her other projects are artist <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/pedro-g-romero/\">Pedro G. Romero</a>’s next two flamenco film projects: “Caracafé in Kazakhstan,” now in post and “Cinco Cadi,” in pre-production.</p>\n<p>\n\tShe adds: “We have just completed post-production on the documentary feature ‘What We Did in the Shadows’ by Sara Moralo, which follows a group of elderly LGBTQ+ individuals fighting to find a safe space after a lifetime of repression.”</p>\n</div>"

    "body": "<div><p>\n\tBasque cinema is punching above its weight at San Sebastián, with 75% of Spanish competition titles fully or partially Basque, underscoring how regional industries, once seen as peripheral, are increasingly shaping Spain’s national film landscape. Two flagships — José Mari Goenaga and Aitor Arregi’s “<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/maspalomas/\">Maspalomas</a>” and Asier Altuna’s “<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/karmele/\">Karmele</a>” — exemplify the strategies of their producers, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/xabi-berzosa/\">Xabi Berzosa</a> and <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/marian-fernandez-pascal/\">Marian Fernández Pascal</a>, as Basque production powers up.\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\tA 100% Basque production, “Maspalomas” dramatizes a late-life coming out, then retreat, set between Gran Canaria’s gay scene and a San Sebastián nursing home. “I went to Maspalomas for the first time in 2016, and I thought this was a reality rarely seen in cinema,” Goenaga told <em>Variety</em>. “We’ve seen films about people coming out. But not about someone who decides to go back inside,” added Arregi.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tFor Berzosa, producer at <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/irusoin/\">Irusoin</a> and founding partner at <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/moriarti/\">Moriarti</a> Produkzioak, the creative ambition required a gamble: shooting on 35mm. “Sometimes it doesn’t make sense, but here it did,” he said. “When you shoot in 35mm and say ‘camera rolling,’ everyone is 100% focused. With digital, it’s easier to be less laser focused. Film creates a different atmosphere, and we wanted that for this project.” </p>\n<p>\n\tThe reels nearly went missing in transit from the Canary Islands to Madrid, but the risk, he argued, paid off in intimacy. Financing was entirely Basque, though he shrugs at the symbolism: “If A24 produced something in Basque, I would still say it’s a Basque film. The key element is language and culture.”\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\tIf “Maspalomas” turns on the intimate, Altuna’s “Karmele” is a Basque-language historical epic, adapted from Kirmen Uribe’s novel “The Hour of Waking Together.” Spanning many decades from 1937 France, Venezuela and the Basque Country, it tells of exiled artists and a love story forged in diaspora. “The book was so huge you could make a 12-episode series,” said Fernández Pascal. “The challenge was to tell it in less than two hours, across decades and continents, with a limited budget. But I think the audience will still feel the emotional and geographical journey.”</p>\n<p>\n\tInitially planned as a broader international co-production, “Karmele” scaled back after COVID. “We realised we could make the film without travelling so far,” Fernández Pascal said. “In the end, Basque TV, Spanish public TV, the Basque Government and tax incentives were decisive.” For her, working in Basque is natural: “Maybe from outside people ask ‘why in Basque?’ But for us, why not? The language isn’t the problem — the story is.”</p>\n<p>\n\tSan Sebastián’s lineup reflects the sector’s range. Alongside “Maspalomas” and “Karmele,” Basque presence also takes in Alauda Ruiz de Azúa’s Spanish-language “Sundays,” co-produced by Movistar Plus+, as well as Buenapinta Media, Colosé Producciones, Sayaka Producciones and Encanta Films. It met with a warm reception at a press conference on Monday.</p>\n<p>\n\tFurther Official Selection titles are Alberto Rodríguez’s “Los Tigres,” another Movistar Plus+ feature, co-produced by Kowalski Films; and Agustín Díaz Yanes’ “She Walks in Darkness,” a Netflix original produced by J.A.Bayona via Basque-based production company Basoilarraren Filmak created specifically for the film. </p>\n<p>\n\t“I’m more interested in co-productions than ever, even as a minority partner,” said Fernández Pascal. “The industry is changing so fast. We need to stay flexible.”</p>\n<p>\n\tThat change has been at least two decades in the making. “20 years ago, the Spanish industry was absolutely Madrid-focused,” Berzosa noted. “Now it’s much more balanced, and that’s healthy. It keeps talent in different regions, lets each area develop independently, and brings new directors into the system.” Fernández Pascal added: “Now we have technicians, production companies, directors and screenwriters with ideas, and finance partners committed to supporting Basque-language work.”\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\tThe growth has drawn outside partners — Tornasol, Buendía Estudios, Toboggan among them — while Netflix continues to invest in originals. Local hubs like Tabakalera and EQZE are training a new generation, widening the talent pool. The region isn’t defined by one genre but many, not by one generation but several, and not by narrow collaborations but expansive ones.</p>\n<p>\n\tYet both producers strike a note of caution. “We share the same fears as Hollywood producers,” Berzosa warned. “How society is changing, how we might lose the communal cinema experience. Everyone talks about streaming’s success. But we don’t talk enough about how to keep the whole ecosystem alive. For me, it has to start with cinemas.” Fernández Pascal agreed: “Another crisis will come. But we’ve survived before, and we’ll adapt.” With ambitious epics and intimate dramas side by side, Basque cinema has never looked stronger. For all the momentum, uncertainty remains. It’s a bumper year, on an always bumpy ride.</p>\n</div>"

    "body": "<div><p>\n\tFor more than a decade, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/basque-cinema/\">Basque cinema</a> has increased reach at San Sebastián and beyond, largely on the back of auteur dramas and robust regional support. This year, at Sitges four Basque films are unspooling, and all of them, from animation to folk horror to high-concept sci-fi, are rooted in genre.</p>\n<p>\n\t<strong>Four Films, Four Directions</strong></p>\n<p>\n\tSitges audiences will get a first taste of <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/paul-urkijo/\">Paul Urkijo</a>’s “<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/gaua/\">Gaua</a>”, his third Basque-language feature after the breakout success of “Errementari” and hit “Irati.” Produced by Irusoin, Ikusgarri Films and Vilaüt Films, the film plunges into nocturnal folklore and 17th-century superstition as Kattalin, played by Yune Nogueiras, ventures into a forest bristling with mythical beings. “With ‘Gaua’ we continue a line of work we started years ago: producing in Basque, with strong genre elements, but thinking from the very beginning that the film has to cross borders,” Xabi Berzosa of Irusoin told Variety.\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\t<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/alberto-vazquez/\">Alberto Vázquez</a> returns with “<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/decorado/\">Decorado</a>,” following Goya-winning “Unicorn Wars.” Produced by Abano Producións along with Uniko Estudio Creativo, Glow Animation, Sardinha Em Lata, and María y Arnold AIE.in a Spanish-Portuguese partnership. This adult animation zigs toward existential satire: Arnold, a middle-aged mouse, wanders a world that feels staged, every backdrop like cardboard scenery. As his crises accumulate, emotional, professional, even romantic  he suspects that his reality is artificial. What begins as paranoia becomes a symbolic journey to loosen the scaffolding of illusion and to find the genuine.\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\tIon de Sosa delivers the Spanish premiere of “<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/balearic/\">Balearic</a>” in Sitges’ Oficial Fantàstic competition having World Premiered at Locarno. The film is produced by Umbracle Cine, Apellaniz y de Sosa and Jaibo Films in co-production with La Fabrica Nocturna Cinéma.  A poolside party descends into menace as a group of young people are trapped in a villa’s swimming pool, black dogs circling outside while a St. John’s Eve party rages next door. Part survival thriller, part social allegory, the director told Variety earlier this year that its seed “stemmed from “looking at how young and older people communicate and also at myself critically and wondering what I was doing, if any, to make the world a better place.” </p>\n<p>\n\tFinally, “<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/singular/\">Singular</a>,” from Alberto Gastesi and produced by White Leaf Producciones and Vidania Films , brings Patricia López Arnaiz and Javier Rey into a lakeside house where an AI specialist encounters a figure uncannily resembling her dead son. Blending grief drama with speculative science fiction, it taps into the open and zeitgeist question of just where technology is taking us.</p>\n<p>\n\t<strong>Why Basque Filmmakers Are Turning to Genre</strong></p>\n<p>\n\tBerzosa places the trend squarely with directors. “I don’t think that producers have been so important in green-lighting those projects. It’s more the directors and the creators’ appeal to the genre. Luckily, it’s also a very demanded genre nowadays. So it’s great as a producer to see and take part in it.”</p>\n<p>\n\tOne of Spain’s most exciting younger genre auteurs Paul Urkijo embodies that shift. “Paul is a very special case. He is an absolute genre lover, but at the same time his imagination is rooted in Basque culture. That combination is rare, and that’s why his films are so different,” Berzosa observed.</p>\n<p>\n\tFinancing for “Gaua” reflects the new internationalism of Basque production. “We were lucky to put together Irusoin, Ikusgarri and Vilaüt, and to have Filmax involved from the start. It gave the film an international frame even before the shoot.”</p>\n<p>\n\t<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/ivan-minambres/\">Iván Miñambres</a>, executive producer at UniKo, sees both tradition and market opportunity driving the surge. “In the Basque Country there is a strong storytelling tradition rooted in mythology, and in the duality between the everyday and the extraordinary. That background naturally lends itself to genre cinema.” he told <em>Variety</em>. “At the same time, in recent years we have seen a new generation of producers and filmmakers willing to take risks, to experiment visually and thematically, and to connect with international audiences through universal themes wrapped in genre or surreal narratives. Strong institutional support and co-production networks have also given these projects the resources to compete internationally.,”\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\tFor Miñambres, the trend is just beginning. “The international market has become increasingly receptive to original and daring voices in cinema, and as producers we must take advantage of this moment. ” he said, adding “I believe we will see even more productions coming from our region, not only because of this global openness, but also because local talent is now more ambitious and connected than ever. Genre is proving to be a powerful tool to talk about contemporary fears, contradictions, and identities from a unique and distinctive perspective.”</p>\n<p>\n\tCompared to Basque festival breakouts of the past decade such as  Estibaliz Urresola Solaguren debut “20000 species of Bees” or David Pérez Sañudo’s “Ane Is Missing,” dramas shot through with regional specificity,  these films look louder, darker, perhaps weirder. Yet they carry forward the same DNA of bold aesthetics and cultural awareness.</p>\n<p>\n\t“We are talking about very local, very Basque mythology, but it connects with how every country approaches storytelling. Each country has its own, but we can understand one another through story. It always comes down to drama and character,” Berzosa stressed.</p>\n<p>\n\tSitges has long functioned as Europe’s premier launchpad for fantastic cinema. Alongside exposure it gives entry into a network of buyers and fans who treat genre as serious cinema. The four films make clear Basque productions constant diversification, and genre as a strong calling card. </p>\n</div>"

I’m incredibly thrilled and proud to be part of ‘Mard Mombatti’s’ journey and supporting Guneet’s vision.”</p>\n<p>\n\tDogra cut his teeth as a producer at Indian indie powerhouse Sikhya Entertainment, the banner behind Academy Award winner “The Elephant Whisperers.” During his tenure there, he wore multiple hats in production and producing capacity on projects including 2015 <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/busan-international-film-festival/\">Busan International Film Festival</a> opener “Zubaan,” Netflix film “Pagglait,” Kathryn Bigelow’s “Zero Dark Thirty” and “Monsoon Shootout” before transitioning to the director’s chair.\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\t“‘Mard Mombatti’ is about the shadows we bury — of desire, of identity, of the silences that eat away at us when we cannot speak,” Dogra said. “To have my debut film premiere at Tasveer, a festival that has nurtured South Asian voices with immense care, feels like the most generous beginning. Having Anjay’s support as executive producer is both humbling and inspiring — it tells me that a small, fragile film made with limited means can still find belief from someone who has worked at the highest level.”</p>\n</div>"
