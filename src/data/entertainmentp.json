We’ve launched over 100 new safety features over the course of the last year. A lot of the negative press has come from things that have happened five years ago. Roblox has always prioritized safety, and we continue to iterate over time. So our platform is very different today than it was even six months.”</p>\n<p>\n\tThe Roblox safety boss’ remarks come on the heels of the implementation of additional safety features on Roblox, and the company’s recently announced goal of <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/2025/gaming/news/roblox-expand-age-estimation-all-users-end-2025-1236506212/\">expanding its age-estimation technology to all of its users</a> by the end of the year.</p>\n</div>\n<div>\n\t<h2 id=\"section-heading\">\n\t\tMore from Variety\n\t</h2>\n\t<ul>\n\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n<div>\n\t\t\t<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/2025/film/news/polygamy-arab-horror-movie-the-vile-fantastic-fest-1236526823/\">\n\t\t\t<p><img src=\"https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/The-Vile.jpg?w=250&h=167&crop=1\" alt=\"The Vile\" />\n\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t</a>\n\t</div>\n\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n<div>\n\t\t\t<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/2025/film/news/idfa-short-documentary-section-1236526896/\">\n\t\t\t<p><img src=\"https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/An-Open-Field.jpg?w=250&h=167&crop=1\" alt=\"An Open Field\" />\n\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t</a>\n\t</div>\n\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n<div>\n\t\t\t<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/2025/film/news/basque-women-noka-ekoizpena-filmmakers-abycine-1236526454/\">\n\t\t\t<p><img src=\"https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/DSC03207.jpg?w=250&h=167&crop=1\" alt=\"Noka Ekoizpena\" />\n\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t</a>\n\t</div>\n\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n<div>\n\t\t\t<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/2025/digital/news/youtube-reinstate-channels-banned-election-covid-misinformation-1236527333/\">\n\t\t\t<p><img src=\"https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/YouTube.jpg?w=250&h=167&crop=1\" alt=\"YouTube\" />\n\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t</a>\n\t</div>\n\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n<div>\n\t\t\t<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/2025/tv/news/leticia-dolera-puberty-san-sebastian-hbo-beta-1236526788/\">\n\t\t\t<p><img src=\"https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Puberty-Photo-by-Quim-Vives-1.jpg?w=250&h=167&crop=1\" alt=\"Puberty\" />\n\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t</a>\n\t</div>\n\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n<div>\n\t\t\t<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/2025/film/news/rio-film-festival-secret-agent-dolores-fellipe-barbosa-1236526114/\">\n\t\t\t<p><img src=\"https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/VARIETY-SIZING-1.png?w=250&h=167&crop=1\" alt=\"The Secret Agent\" />\n\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t</a>\n\t</div>\n\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t</ul>\n\t</div>\n\t\t\t</article>\n\t\t</div>"

    "body": "<div><p>\n\tFans of FX’s critically acclaimed three-season series “Reservation Dogs” saw firsthand how much creator <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/sterlin-harjo/\">Sterlin Harjo</a> revered the art of cinema. Episodes would often contain nods to various genres and films; the series finale was even an homage to Robert Altman’s “Nashville.”</p>\n<p>\n\tSo, it’s no surprise that when Harjo set out to create his follow-up to “Rez Dogs,” he decided to tackle another one of his favorite film styles: Noir. “<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/the-lowdown/\">The Lowdown</a>,” which premieres Sept. 23 on FX, stars <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/ethan-hawke/\">Ethan Hawke</a> as citizen journalist Lee Raybon, who calls himself a “truthstorian” while investigating the seedy underbelly of Tulsa, Okla.\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\t“I just am such a fan of noir,” says Harjo, who exec produces “The Lowdown” in addition to writing and directing the pilot. “And I just had always thought that I could set one in Tulsa. Noirs that are set in LA, that’s kind of been done. But the underbelly of Tulsa, the conspiracy of Tulsa, places in the middle of America, they haven’t been explored yet.”\n</p>\n<p>\n\tHarjo grew up in the area; he’s a member of the Muscogee Creek tribe, which founded Tulsa — so this is also personal for him, just as “Reservation Dogs” was. Harjo says he loves Tulsa — but doesn’t gloss over its terrible past. The story of the devastating 1921 Tulsa Race Massacre, in which hundreds of Black residents were killed by mobs of white Tulsans, has become better known in recent years thanks to activists and even TV shows like “Watchmen”; it’s also referenced in “The Lowdown.”</p>\n<p>\n\t“I think every place has a really dark history in America,” Harjo says. “A lot of people have brought more truths out about the history of Tulsa, especially when it pertains to the Tulsa race massacre. That truth and being honest with your past is healing, and it brings a community back together and wakes people up. You’re seeing that happen now. There’s still a long way to go, but it’s happening. \n\t</p>\n<p>\n\t“The history of Tulsa, and the history of Oklahoma in general, is one of darkness, just like the rest of the United States,” he adds. “Specifically it was Indian Territory. My tribe and a lot of other tribes were marched here to Oklahoma, on the Trail of Tears… But then it’s also a story of survival. Those tribes rebuilt, and those tribes are thriving now. So as much as it is a story of the  you’re touching on darkness, it’s also, you see survival in Oklahoma and in Tulsa.”</p>\n<p>\n\tAs a young independent filmmaker in the 2010s, Harjo worked with the local Tulsa muckraking journal This Land Press (and the spinoff This Land TV), which also played an important role in exploring the city’s history and future.</p>\n<p>\n\t“They gave me free reign to make documentaries in Tulsa about whatever I wanted to make,” Harjo says. “We were talking about stories that happened locally, and we were really kind of holding a mirror up to our city. And really kind of presenting the city with a reflection of itself, for better and for worse, the good and the bad.”</p>\n<p>\n\tIt was there that Harjo met Lee Roy Chapman, who ultimately inspired Hawke’s character in “The Lowdown.”</p>\n<p>\n\t“I did a series with him called ‘Tulsa Public Secrets,’ where I rode shotgun in his white van,” Harjo says. “He was a journalist. He was also a historian, a researcher. One thing that he was obsessed with was talking about things that a lot of people weren’t either interested in or didn’t want to talk about, involving the truth. I took a lot from him, was inspired by him.”</p>\n<p>\n\tAfter Chapman died in 2015, Harjo considered making a film about him — but then he got busy with “Reservation Dogs.” After that show ended, Harjo started kicking around that noir idea — and soon realized he could adapt his take on Chapman into “The Lowdown.”</p>\n<div>\n<figure>\n<p><img srcset=\"https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/IMG_6286r_f54.jpg 3000w, https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/IMG_6286r_f54.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/IMG_6286r_f54.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/IMG_6286r_f54.jpg?resize=1920,1280 1920w, https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/IMG_6286r_f54.jpg?resize=1360,907 1360w, https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/IMG_6286r_f54.jpg?resize=1000,667 1000w, https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/IMG_6286r_f54.jpg?resize=910,607 910w, https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/IMG_6286r_f54.jpg?resize=681,454 681w, https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/IMG_6286r_f54.jpg?resize=450,300 450w, https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/IMG_6286r_f54.jpg?resize=250,167 250w\" src=\"https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/IMG_6286r_f54.jpg?w=1024\" alt=\"\" />\n\t</p>\n<figcaption>\n\t\t\t\t\t<span>Sterlin Harjo, Ethan Hawke, “The Lowdown” (Shane Brown/FX)</span>\n\t</figcaption>\n</figure>\n</div>\n<p>\n\tSigning Hawke to executive produce and star in the project was a natural; Harjo and Hawke have known each other for years. (The two have written together, and Hawke appeared as a guest star in the final season of “Rez Dogs.”) But because they’re close, Harjo didn’t want to presume he could just ask his buddy to take part in “The Lowdown,” so he concocted a plan.</p>\n<p>\n\t“You don’t want to  hurt the friendship,” Harjo says. “So I just sent it to him under the guise that I wanted notes back from my script. I was just trying to see if he was into it, and what his reaction was. And luckily, he read it and said, ‘why am I not playing this guy?’ From that point on, I’m like, ‘Well, you are!’”\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\tIn “The Lowdown,” Hawke’s character, Lee, investigates the powerful Washberg family, including an Oklahoma state gubernatorial candidate (played by Kyle MacLachlan) whose brother (Tim Blake Nelson) kills himself under mysterious circumstances. Jeanne Tripplehorn plays the widow, while “The Lowdown” also stars Kaniehtiio Horn as Lee’s ex, and Ryan Kiera Armstrong as their daughter.</p>\n<p>\n\t“So many people agreed to be in this show,” Harjo says. “Part of that is Ethan, part of that is other actors, but I think a lot of it is ‘Reservation Dogs.’ A lot of people were inspired and really liked that show. I think it’s a movie lover’s show, and they could see that I was also a movie lover, and they wanted to support me in some way.”</p>\n<p>\n\t“The Lowdown” touches on other themes including Lee’s attempts to be a good father despite the taxing nature of his job — something Harjo says he could relate to. “When I was working for This Land Press, my daughter was around 13,” he recalls. “I had crazy living situations, trying to be an independent filmmaker and trying to make a living, and wondering if I had a future, wondering if I was actually hurting my daughter by doing this.”</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd then there’s the topic of journalism and wading through facts, two things that appear to be in danger in modern society. “We need people fighting for truth, and we need people fighting for what’s righteous and leading us into the future,” he says. “I mean, our children literally depend on it.”</p>\n<p>\n\tHarjo hopes to keep “The Lowdown” going in future seasons, with Hawke’s character investigating a different crime in each installment. Harjo is also working on more projects, including a comedic Western series and an undisclosed piece of American literature that he’s aiming to develop into a another show. He’s also busy with a feature that has been set up at Searchlight.</p>\n<p>\n\tMeanwhile, Harjo also hopes to revisit the “Reservation Dogs” universe with a film idea he’s kicking around.</p>\n<p>\n\t“It’s still on the horizon,” he says. “It’s a little bit away, but I’d love to make one of those. I just don’t want to screw it up!”</p>\n<p>\n\tIn the meantime, “Rez Dogs” fans will find plenty of Easter eggs in “The Lowdown” — starting with the very opening scene, when Hawke walks past “Rez Dogs” star Paulina Alexis (in character as Willie Jack).\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\t“That’s a handoff,” Harjo says. “We were about to shoot the opening, and I got a call from Paulina. She’s like, ‘Uncle, I’m in town! I just came for a visit.’ And so she came to set, and I said, ‘you’ve got to be in this.’ So I have her walking by Ethan in the beginning, and she just does one of her Willie Jack nods at him. It was a really poignant, beautiful moment, this meaningful thing for me. ‘Reservation Dogs’ really is what leveled me up and got me here, and I want to honor that.”</p>\n<p>\n\t<em>“The Lowdown”  premieres on Tuesday, Sept. 23, at 9 p.m. ET on FX, and streams the next day on Hulu.</em></p>\n</div>"

    "description": "YouTube will soon let creators back on the platform who were previously banned over now-retired content policies -- including those prohibiting misinformation about the 2020 U.S. presidential election and COVID-19. ",
    "body": "<div><p>\n\t<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/youtube/\">YouTube</a> will soon let creators back on the platform who were previously banned over now-retired content policies — including those prohibiting misinformation about the 2020 U.S. presidential election and <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/covid-19/\">COVID-19</a>. A lawyer for Alphabet, in disclosing the move, said the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/biden-administration/\">Biden administration</a> had pressured the internet company to crack down on YouTube content with information government officials at the time felt was misinformation about COVID.\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\tThe news was included in a “statement of facts” from Alphabet, the parent of YouTube and Google, sent in response to subpoenas issued to the company by the House Judiciary Committee, chaired by Rep. Jim Jordan (R-Ohio).\n</p>\n<p>\n\tThe <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Alphabet_Letter_HJC_2025-09-23.pdf\">letter sent to the committee</a>, dated Sept. 23, was signed by King & Spalding partner Daniel Donovan, a lawyer representing Alphabet in the matter. (A company rep confirmed that the letter, posted by the House Judiciary Committee, is authentic.)\n</p>\n<p>\n\t“YouTube’s Community Guidelines allow for a wider range of content regarding COVID-19 and elections integrity,” the letter said. “Reflecting the Company’s commitment to free expression, YouTube will provide an opportunity for all creators to rejoin the platform if the Company terminated their channels for repeated violations of COVID-19 and elections integrity policies that are no longer in effect.”</p>\n<p>\n\tThe letter continued, “YouTube values conservative voices on its platform and recognizes that these creators have extensive reach and play an important role in civic discourse. The Company recognizes these creators are among those shaping today’s online consumption, landing ‘must-watch’ interviews, giving viewers the chance to hear directly from politicians, celebrities, business leaders, and more.”\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\tIn a <a href=\"https://x.com/UpdatesFromYT/status/1970549152699543938\" target=\"_blank\">post on X</a> Tuesday, YouTube said, “We’ve had a lot of questions about a pathway back to YouTube for some terminated creators to set up a new channel. This will be a limited pilot project that will be available to a subset of creators in addition to those channels terminated for policies that have been deprecated.”</p>\n<p>\n\tThe reinstatement program, which is set to officially launch in a few weeks, will encompass users who had been banned not only under the election and COVID misinformation bans but other now-defunct policies.</p>\n<p>\n\tAccording to the letter from Alphabet’s lawyer, senior Biden administration officials, including White House officials, “conducted repeated and sustained outreach to Alphabet and pressed the Company regarding certain user-generated content related to the COVID-19 pandemic that did not violate its policies. While the Company continued to develop and enforce its policies independently, Biden Administration officials continued to press the Company to remove non-violative user-generated content.”</p>\n<p>\n\tThe letter continued, “As online platforms, including Alphabet, grappled with these decisions, the Administration’s officials, including President Biden, created a political atmosphere that sought to influence the actions of platforms based on their concerns regarding misinformation. It is unacceptable and wrong when any government, including the Biden Administration, attempts to dictate how the Company moderates content, and the Company has consistently fought against those efforts on First Amendment grounds.”</p>\n<p>\n\tTwo years ago, YouTube reversed its <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/2020/digital/news/youtube-remove-videos-trump-election-misinformation-1234849450/\">ban on videos that falsely claimed Trump won the 2020 U.S. presidential election</a>. The video platform announced that as of June 2, 2023, it would “stop removing content that advances false claims that widespread fraud, errors or glitches occurred in the 2020 and other past U.S. Presidential elections.”</p>\n<p>\n\tAs of December 2024, YouTube had fully retired its COVID-19 misinformation policy to allow for “discussion of various treatments” for the disease. COVID now falls under its broader Medical Misinformation framework covering content related to infectious diseases (including influenza and measles). In October 2020, YouTube had announced a <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/2020/digital/news/youtube-bans-covid-vaccine-conspiracy-theories-misinformation-1234804376/\">ban on videos that include claims about coronavirus vaccinations</a> and treatments that contradicted information from health authorities.\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\t“No matter the political atmosphere, YouTube will continue to enable free expression on its platform, particularly as it relates to issues subject to political debate. Political debate and discussion are in the public’s interest,” the letter from Alphabet’s lawyer said. </p>\n<p>\n\tThe letter added that YouTube does not operate a fact-checking program. However, it has in the past provided <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/2020/digital/news/youtube-fact-checks-us-misinformation-covid-19-1234591908/\">fact-checking “panels” aimed at debunking conspiracy theories</a> in conjunction with third-party partners.</p>\n<p>\n\tThe Alphabet lawyer’s letter also said, “The Company appreciates the accountability from the House Judiciary Committee — led by Chairman Jim Jordan — and its critical role in advancing the core American value of freedom of expression. The Company has a commitment to freedom of expression. This commitment is unwavering and will not bend to political pressure.”</p>\n</div>"

    "body": "<div><p>\n\tLeading Brazilian producer <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/rodrigo-teixeira/\">Rodrigo Teixeira</a> of <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/rt-features/\">RT Features</a> is teaming with Argentina’s <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/rei-pictures/\">Rei Pictures</a> to produce Benjamín Naishtat’s “Glaxo.” Adapted from Hernán Ronsino’s eponymous novel, the film will star popular Argentine actor and singer Lali Espósito (“Permitidos,” “Sky Rojo”), Esteban Lamothe (“El estudiante”) and Marcelo Subiotto (“Puan”), with CAA Media Finance handling sales. Production is scheduled to begin this year in Brazil and Argentina. \n\t</p>\n<p>\n\tThe news comes as Espósito is serving on the Official Jury of the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/san-sebastian-film-festival-2/\">San Sebastián Film Festival</a>, presided by J.A. Bayona.   \n</p>\n<p>\n\tSet in a small provincial town between the late 1950s and the 1980s, “Glaxo” tells the story of four young men whose friendship is shattered forever when a former policeman and his beautiful wife arrive in the town where the titular factory is located. The film is described as “about desire and revenge, set at a time when a whole country lost its innocence.”</p>\n<p>\n\tNaishtat’s debut “History of Fear” premiered in competition in Berlin in 2014, with “The Movement” making its first bow at Locarno a year later. “Rojo,” his 2018 film about the months leading up to Argentina’s coup d’état, won best director, actor and cinematography at the San Sebastián Film Festival in 2018. </p>\n<p>\n\tThe director won top prizes at the festival once again five years later with “Puan,” which he co-directed with María Alché. “Puan” went on to be a hit in the Argentine box office and was ultimately acquired by Amazon, where it reached No.1 . Naishtat also recently wrote the script for Laura Casabe’s “The Virgin of the Quarry Lake,” which premiered at Sundance at the beginning of the year.\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\tOn top of “Glaxo,” Teixeira’s RT Features continues on a busy schedule following an Oscar win for Walter Salles’s history-making “I’m Still Here” earlier in the year. The label is currently in pre-production on “La Perra” by Dominga Sotomayor (“The Year of the Everlasting Storm”) and just wrapped production on James Gray’s “Paper Tiger,” starring two-time Oscar-nominee Scarlett Johansson and Miles Teller. RT Features is also in post-production on Rami Kodeih’s “Wolves,” inspired by the real-life collapse of Lebanon’s banking system in 2019. The Brazilian company is also behind major indie hits such as Luca Guadagnino’s “Call Me By Your Name” and Noah Baumbach’s “Frances Ha.”</p>\n<p>\n\tAcclaimed Argentinian production house Rei Pictures is known for championing major Latin American auteurs. Its slate includes a series of critically acclaimed festival hits such as Luis Ortega’s “Kill the Jockey,” Felipe Gálvez’s “The Settlers” and Lucrecia Martel’s “Zama” and “Landmarks.” “Glaxo” will mark yet another collaboration between Naishtat and Rei Pictures, which has also produced “History of Fear.” Rei Pictures <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/2025/film/global/argentina-rei-pictures-spain-mexico-primo-1236500188/\">announced recently</a> an expansion, launching offices in Spain and Mexico. </p>\n<p>\n\tOther cast includes Manu Fanego (“El amor después del amor”), Alan Sabbagh (“El rey del once”) and Esteban Bigliardi (“La Flor”). “Glaxo” is produced by Rodrigo Teixeira and Berta Marchiori for RT Features alongside Rei Pictures. The film will be co-produced by Santiago Gallelli, Benjamin Domenech and Matías Roveda. </p>\n<p>\n\t<em>John Hopewell contributed to this article.</em></p>\n</div>"

    "body": "<div><p>\n\t<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/mitch-albom/\">Mitch Albom</a>‘s latest novel, “Twice,” has been acquired by <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/netflix/\">Netflix</a> in a competitive situation. </p>\n<p>\n\t<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/paul-weitz/\">Paul Weitz</a>, who recently helmed the Kevin Hart-starring dramedy “Fatherhood” for the streamer, will adapt and direct the film. Weitz will also produce the movie with Andrew Miano through their company, Depth of Field.</p>\n<p>\n\tTo be published on October 7 by Harper, “Twice” is a love story about magical second chances. The novel asks: “What if you got to do everything in your life — again?” That’s the reality for Alfie Logan, who discovers the magical ability to undo any moment and live it again. The one catch, a synopsis of the story explains, is that he must accept the consequences of his second try, for better or worse. \n\t</p>\n<p>\n\tThe synopsis continues: “Eventually, Alfie turns his gift to his love life, studying his crushes and going back to make himself more appealing. In time, he falls deeply in love with Gianna, the woman he believes is the one. He seems to find contentment. But as the years pass, Alfie’s eye begins to wander. Which is when he learns a lone caveat to his power: once he undoes a love, that person can never fall in love with him again. Knowing if he gives in to temptation, he will risk losing what he has with Gianna, Alfie makes a choice that changes his life forever. The book begins many years later, after an ailing Alfie is arrested for allegedly cheating and winning millions at a casino roulette wheel. As a curious detective interrogates him, he slowly uncovers Alfie’s incredible story, and its most unlikely conclusion.”\n</p>\n<p>\n\t“Twice” is the latest of Albom’s novels to be adapted for the screen. Four of the author’s bestsellers have been turned into successful TV movies: 1999’s “Tuesdays With Morrie,” starring Jack Lemmon and Hank Azaria, produced by Oprah Winfrey and which won four Emmy awards; 2004’s “Five People You Meet in Heaven,” which was the most-watched TV movie of the year with 19 million viewers; 2007’s “For One More Day,” also produced by Winfrey and which earned Ellen Burstyn a Screen Actors Guild nomination; and 2011’s “Have a Little Faith” for Hallmark Hall of Fame. Albom’s books have collectively sold 42 million copies worldwide and have been published in 51 territories and in 48 languages around the world.\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\tWeitz’s filmography also includes the Apple TV+ series “Murderbot,” starring Alexander Skarsgard; “About a Boy,” which earned him a best adapted screenplay Oscar nomination; the comedy classic “American Pie”; “Moving On,” starring Jane Fonda and Lily Tomlin; “Grandma,” also with Tomlin; and “Admission,” with Tina Fey and Paul Rudd.</p>\n<p>\n\tCAA represents Albom and Weitz. Albom is also repped by the David Black Agency and attorney Eric Brown. Weitz is also repped by Untitled Entertainment and Yorn, Levine, Barnes, Krintzman, Rubenstein, Kohner, Endlich, Goodell & Gellman.<br /></p>\n</div>"

    "body": "<div><p>\n\t<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/yung-miami/\">Yung Miami</a>, the rapper born Caresha Brownlee, and one half of the hip-hop duo City Girls, has authored a letter of support for <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/2025/music/news/diddy-bail-denied-1236478165/\">Sean “Diddy” Combs</a> before his sentencing on prostitution charges next week. The artist and former girlfriend of Combs praised him as a “loving, genuine, supportive, and always encouraging” figure, pleading to the judge: “he belongs at home, with his family.” </p>\n<p>\n\tMiami was in a relationship with Combs from approximately 2021 to 2023, and notes how Combs supported her personally and professionally. She specifically highlights him inviting her to the Met Gala in 2023, and notes how he gave her a platform for her “Caresha Please” podcast on <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/2024/tv/news/sean-diddy-combs-revolt-ownership-employees-1236024723/\">Revolt </a>(Combs stepped down as chairman of the television and media company in June 2024). \n\t</p>\n<p>\n\tCombs was found guilty earlier this year on two felony charges of transportation to engage in prostitution. He was acquitted on sex trafficking and racketeering charges. </p>\n<p>\n\t“Behind the scenes, he was loving, genuine, supportive and always encouraging,” Miami wrote. “He believed in me, pushed me to grow and taught me how to be a better business woman. He helped me find balance between chasing my dreams and being present for my family, because that’s what he did — no matter how busy he was, he never missed holidays or special moments with his family.</p>\n<p>\n\tThere was so many moments where he gave — quitely, privately, without cameras, because his heart genuinely wanted to help.” </p>\n<p>\n\tShe also made mention of Combs’ philanthropic and “real inner work,” including his decision to “check himself into anger management, start therapy, and commit to physical healing through therapy.”\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\tMiami’s letter was one of 75 in support of Combs ahead of his sentencing where he is facing a maximum of 20 years in prison. </p>\n</div>"
