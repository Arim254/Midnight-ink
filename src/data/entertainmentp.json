Directed by Leila Sy and produced by Virginie Silla, the movie is headlined a powerful female duo, Nora Arnezeder and Maria Bello. </p>\n<p>\n\tInspired by a true story, “Hell in Paradise” stars Arnezeder as Nina, a young French girl who leaves her native Marseille and accepts her first job as a receptionist at a luxurious hotel resort on a magnificent island of the Maldives, hoping for a better life. But when a tragedy befalls the hotel, Nina is propelled in a relentless spiral of lies and manipulations. Wrongly accused and sentenced to life in prison, she will have no other choice but to run between traps and escape this paradise turned into hell. Karine Silla (“A Butterfly Kiss”) penned the script.  \n\t</p>\n<figure><p>\n<iframe width=\"500\" height=\"281\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/M7rW1qwKR9A?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\"></iframe>\n</p></figure>\n<p>\n\tGregoire Melin’s Kinology handles international sales on the hot project which complements EuropaCorp’s roster of hit franchises from Luc Besson, from “Taken” to “Lucy.”\n</p>\n<div>\n<figure>\n<p><img srcset=\"https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/HIP_PHOTOGRAMMES_4K_1.0.jpg 4096w, https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/HIP_PHOTOGRAMMES_4K_1.0.jpg?resize=150,63 150w, https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/HIP_PHOTOGRAMMES_4K_1.0.jpg?resize=300,126 300w\" src=\"https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/HIP_PHOTOGRAMMES_4K_1.0.jpg?w=1024\" alt=\"\" />\n\t</p>\n<figcaption>\n\t</figcaption>\n</figure>\n</div>\n<p>\n\tThe film is “a story of resilience, a reminder that you should never give up, even in the darkest moments.

    "body": "<div><p>\n\tOne does not simply walk into Aramán — they will be thrown into it.</p>\n<p>\n\tWhen <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/critical-role/\">Critical Role</a> debuts the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/2025/tv/news/critical-role-campaign-4-trailer-1236522539/\">first episode of its Campaign 4 Thursday</a>, viewers will see the cast of the Dungeons & Dragons actual-play series begin their new edition of the tabletop roleplaying game mid-story. The in-medias-res choice comes as Dropout’s “Dimension 20” star <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/brennan-lee-mulligan/\">Brennan Lee Mulligan</a> is taking his first turn as <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/2025/gaming/news/critical-role-brennan-lee-mulligan-campaign-4-1236477230/\">game master for a full mainline Critical Role campaign</a>, and allowing longtime GM <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/matthew-mercer/\">Matthew Mercer</a> to sit this one out and become a cast member.\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\t“Brennan comes out of the gate swinging. This is not your coffee shop D&D game where everyone is meeting in a tavern,” Critical Role co-founder, creative director and cast member Marisha Ray told <em>Variety</em>. “And don’t get me wrong — there’s a reason why a lot of games start by everybody meeting in taverns. It’s a good place, everyone can have a few drinks, everyone gets to know each other. This is not that. You are already entering into a pretty detailed woven tapestry of relationships and history between characters, history with the world and the NPCs. So know that you are jumping into a pretty well-cooked stew.”\n</p>\n<p>\n\t(<em>Variety</em> is told that within that metaphorical stew, there will be fictional cranberry rolls served.)</p>\n<p>\n\tMulligan made this unique choice in how to enter the world of Aramán, his newly created setting for Campaign 4, of with the support of Ray, Mercer and the Critical Role team, but it was his initial concept and actually born out of Mulligan’s improv comedy history.</p>\n<p>\n\t“I subscribe to a methodology and a guideline that I learned in improv, which is beginning in the middle is often more clarifying, even though it’s more information dense than beginning at the beginning,” Mulligan said. “It was a great old lesson I learned doing improv, which was, you are going to listen to a 10-minute phone call, but you only get to pick 15 seconds, and you’re only hearing one side of the conversation. So you have 15 seconds to understand what a 10-minute phone call is about. Do you put your 15 seconds at the very beginning, do you put it at the very end, or do you put it in the very middle, in order to increase your chances of understanding what the conversation was about? And most people intuitively know that you go into the middle of a conversation, you are actually more likely to understand what’s going on than going to the beginning or the end of it.” \n\t</p>\n<p>\n\tMulligan added: “Immediately starting without context actually gives you the most context. So I think that a lot of this beginning episode, to me, was about showing you characters in the middle of complicated lives as a way of creating the most possible clarity. Even though it’s very information rich, the idea is you’re going to learn so much about these characters by starting in the middle of events as they are speeding forward.”</p>\n<p>\n\tPer Critical Role, Campaign 4 will see the cast “traverse the new world of Aramán in a West Marches-style approach to gameplay where the story unfolds through the perspectives of three distinct rotating tables: the valiant Soldiers, the vigorous Seekers and the veiled Schemers. As their paths converge, we’ll dive deeper into Aramán, a world of wonder with sorcery stemming from the graveyard of the gods and carrying forward the spirit of epic sagas reminiscent of ‘The Lord of the Rings’ and ‘Game of Thrones.'”</p>\n<p>\n\tThough Critical Role has been choosy with its character art teases and plot hints ahead of Campaign 4’s premiere on Beacon.tv — as well as the Critical Role YouTube and Twitch channels Oct. 2 — Mercer said a great deal will be revealed right up top.</p>\n<p>\n\t“There is a fair amount of deep mystery, very quickly. Very deep mystery with personal stakes across the board,” said Mercer, who is chief creative officer at Critical Role Productions. “As far as pilots for a long-running story go, it’s pretty solid and pretty dense in a really exciting way, where even as players, we were caught off guard when it was our turn to come to the table, because we were so rapt with the other players’ scenes. We’re as much of a fan of the story as we are just people playing in it. So you can definitely look forward to that intensity at times. That goes with just how we engage with the world, but also sometimes how we engage with each other. Not everything starts with friendship — intensely so, at times, so look forward to that good stuff.”</p>\n<p>\n\tThe Campaign 4 cast includes in a mix of old and new Critical Rolers, including Mercer, Ray, Laura Bailey, Taliesin Jaffe, Ashley Johnson, Liam O’Brien, Sam Riegel, Travis Willingham, Luis Carazo, Robbie Daymond, Aabria Iyengar, Whitney Moore and Alexander Ward.</p>\n<p>\n\tAmong the newbies is Moore, who has been overwhelmed to see the frenzy Critical Role fans (known as “Critters”) are already in before the first episode is out.\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\t“It’s been so crazy to see the reception of the characters. I mean, we’ve seen cosplays already. It’s been so wild,” Moore said. “And for me, that’s been one of the most rewarding parts is just knowing that this is a community of artists, and that our little brains and the things that we’re doing and playing a game is inspiring other people to make art. It’s the best feeling in the world.”</p>\n<p>\n\tAs for the staple players, while it will certainly be an adjustment to go to the rotating-tables format and added in so many more cast members for the campaign, the extra additions are very welcome, original Critical Role cast member Sam Riegel said.</p>\n<p>\n\t“It’s been so exciting for the original eight Critical Role folks, because for the past 10 years, we’ve had a text thread among the eight of us, where we have been sharing fan art and cosplay and memes and GIFs and all kinds of stuff that Critters have made about the three campaigns,” Riegel said. “And we still love sharing it with each other. And now that text thread is 14-people large, and it’s so exciting for us to see the new folks geeking out just as hard as we are about every little fan theory and shipping and fan-art piece that we’ve seen so far.”</p>\n</div>"

    "body": "<div><p>\n\t<strong>SPOILER ALERT:</strong> This story contains spoilers from the Wednesday, Oct. 1 episode of “<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/chicago-med/\">Chicago Med</a>.”</p>\n<p>\n\tIt’s official: Hannah Asher (Jessy Schram) and Dean Archer (<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/steven-weber/\">Steven Weber</a>) are having a baby. The Season 11 premiere of “Chicago Med” picked up directly after the events of the Season 10 finale, with Hannah showing up at Dean’s door to tell him that she’s expecting, and <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/2025/tv/news/chicago-med-steven-weber-dean-father-hannahs-baby-1236508449/\">he’s the father</a>. </p>\n<p>\n\tAlthough Dean and Hannah have had a flirty vibe throughout the past five seasons, viewers have never seen them act on that. Of course, that was also due to her on-off relationship with Ripley (Luke Mitchell). The cliffhanger left viewers wondering whether Ripley or possibly Dean could be the father, but there was actually a third option, too.\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\t“We had three possible fathers in that scenario. Ripley, Archer, and the third one. We didn’t talk about this for long, but briefly, we were talking about the door opening, it being Will Halstead,” showrunner Allen MacDonald tells <em>Variety</em>. “That would be the first time we would see Will Halstead for a long time.”</p>\n<p>\n\tNick Gehlfuss, who played Dr. Halstead for eight years before leaving the show in 2023, will <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/2025/tv/news/nick-gehlfuss-chicago-med-season-11-1236498982/\">be back in the second episode</a>, but not because of Hannah. Instead, viewers will get an update on where he’s at with Natalie (Torrey DeVitto); while she won’t be in the episode, Halstead will be back in town with her son, Owen.</p>\n<div>\n<figure>\n<p><img srcset=\"https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/NUP_208235_00134.jpg 1000w, https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/NUP_208235_00134.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/NUP_208235_00134.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/NUP_208235_00134.jpg?resize=910,607 910w, https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/NUP_208235_00134.jpg?resize=681,454 681w, https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/NUP_208235_00134.jpg?resize=450,300 450w, https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/NUP_208235_00134.jpg?resize=250,167 250w\" src=\"https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/NUP_208235_00134.jpg?w=1000\" alt=\"\" />\n\t</p>\n<figcaption>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tElizabeth Sisson/NBC\n\t</figcaption>\n</figure>\n</div>\n<p>\n\tUltimately, MacDonald decided that making Archer the father would create “the most interesting and fertile ground for storytelling dramatically,” since their friendship has grown so much. He explains that the pair slept together at the end of “The Book of Archer,” the 17th episode of Season 10, when Hannah showed up at Dean’s door with dinner and dessert.\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\t“Jesse and Steven both beautifully played the aftermath of that,” he says. “It’s like ‘The Sixth Sense.’ You can go back and watch, and you can see it. It’s right there on screen; you just weren’t looking for it. They slept together, then decided to continue to be friends, and were doing fine with that.”</p>\n<p>\n\t(Going back and watching episode 18, when Hannah and Ripley go have a discussion, Dean is shown giving the pair the side eye, possibly showing a bit of jealousy.)</p>\n<p>\n\tSo far, the audience has never even seen the two kiss — “they have always been friends with a little bit of a vibe that they don’t even necessarily acknowledge or deny,” MacDonald explains — and there are no plans to show the night they got together via flashbacks.</p>\n<p>\n\t“The reason that it was off-camera is because we wanted to preserve the surprise,” he says. “As a fan, I’m not gonna lie. I would have wanted to see that, but it just seemed that the surprise when she shows up at his door, and the surprise of the confirmation in the premiere was the way to go.”</p>\n<p>\n\tWeber jokes, “I don’t think anybody wants to see that,” but adds, “There’s a whole season to go beyond this. Where the story goes from there is, it’s going to be up and down. I wouldn’t be surprised if there will be some show of affection. It’s something that measures up to the kind of relationship that they have developed, which is a unique relationship. So, whatever affection they are capable of bringing to this unique relationship, it will be consonant with who they are, and it will be earned, not just from a TV romance kind of thing.”</p>\n<p>\n\tAs for what’s next, the duo “decided to continue to be friends” after their hookup, and now, everything has changed, says MacDonald. “Now she’s pregnant. How is that going to affect their relationship? Moving forward, will they remain friends? Are they even going to get along? Is it going to be an issue between them? How does it affect their feelings? But one way or another, it’s going to shake things up between them.”</p>\n<p>\n\tHannah’s storyline will mark the first time a series regular first responder on a “One Chicago” show will have a seemingly positive pregnancy arc. Over the last decade, the franchise has featured multiple miscarriages and fertility issues, as well as couples choosing to adopt.\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\t“It’s a lot to ask of an actor, because it means, on a very basic level, that Jesse’s going to have a prosthetic strapped to her, and it’s going to get bigger and bigger as the season goes on. It’s hard. I’m not the first TV writer to say this, but it’s hard to commit to having a baby on a TV show, but I felt that this was the right way to do it,” MacDonald says. “Jesse was completely on board. It’s going to be hard on her for that part of it, but it is something we intend to follow through with.”</p>\n<p>\n\t“Chicago Med,” produced by Universal Television and Wolf Entertainment, airs on NBC Wednesdays at 8 p.m. ET.</p>\n</div>"

Featuring over 200 hours of footage, the project won a cash prize at the Lau Haizetara Forum in San Sebastián and was presented this week to buyers and platforms at Madrid’s 5<sup>th</sup> Iberseries & Platino Industria.\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\tQuijote Films is also a co-producer on 2025 <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/berlinale/\">Berlinale</a> Silver Bear winner “<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/the-blue-trail/\">The Blue Trail</a>,” which has already surpassed 150,000 admissions in Brazilian cinemas, and the upcoming “A Colmeia,” filmed earlier this year in the Atacama Desert with Brazilian producer Sara Silveira.\n</p>\n<p>\n\t“Collaborating with Brazil has been an incredible experience,” said Quijote Films’ Giancarlo Nasi who said his connection to Brazil goes back many years when he studied there and, for over a decade, served as a mentor at BrLab. “I’ve seen up close the strength and resilience of their film industry. Working hand-in-hand with Brazilian partners continues to affirm why Brazil is such a valuable ally for Quijote,” he said.</p>\n<p>\n\t“With ‘Mariana x BHP,’ we continue to strengthen our international co-production strategy, developing content across the Americas and beyond. Next year, we’ll be in production on projects with partners in Canada, Argentina, Mexico and the U.S. Creating global content with international talent is part of our DNA—just like the commitment to excellence and craft we’ve inherited from auteur cinema,” he pointed out.\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\t“This week at Iberseries, as we presented it to platforms, we felt we had a film with a strong identity – socially and politically resonant, yet with the potential to reach a wide audience. We’re shaping it with the tone of a legal thriller: compelling, critical of the system, conversation-starting, but also deeply engaging,” said Quijote Films producer Sergio Karmy, who extended his gratitude to the Quijote team led by their department head Eugenia Campos, who “together with Giancarlo, is behind the entire creative universe – the pitches, the decks, all the incredible materials we use every day.”</p>\n<p>\n\t “As a Brazilian director, I’ve witnessed firsthand the stories of the victims in Brazil and the lawyers who formed an unprecedented alliance to take on the world’s largest mining company,” said Flumian who had been closely following the unprecedented class action in London for six years.</p>\n<p>\n\tHe added: “This documentary follows their fight for justice and the broader potential of the case to reshape how multinational corporations are held accountable—not just in Latin America, but across the Global South. Starting from a local tragedy, the film reveals how global power actually operates, through a narrative that is gripping, emotional and resonates with audiences around the world.”</p>\n<p>\n\tFlumian’s previous credits include “The Hardest Conversation to Have With Your Parents” (NYT Op-Docs, 2024), which was lauded internationally for its raw portrayal of intergenerational conversations about intimacy; the documentary series “Acende a Luz “(Globoplay, 2023), which explores sexuality in later life and the upcoming action-comedy “Velhos Bandidos,“ starring the legendary Fernanda Montenegro, nominated for an Academy Award for her perf in Walter Salles’ “Central Station” and a star of “I’m Still Here.”</p>\n<div>\n<figure>\n<p><img srcset=\"https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/MarianaxBHP-recibiendo-Premio-San-Sebastian.jpeg 901w, https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/MarianaxBHP-recibiendo-Premio-San-Sebastian.jpeg?resize=132,150 132w, https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/MarianaxBHP-recibiendo-Premio-San-Sebastian.jpeg?resize=264,300 264w\" src=\"https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/MarianaxBHP-recibiendo-Premio-San-Sebastian.jpeg\" alt=\"\" />\n\t</p>\n<figcaption>\n\t</figcaption>\n</figure>\n</div>\n</div>"

Both will compete in the festival’s international competition with their latest shows “Riot Women” and “The Danish Woman” respectively.\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\t<strong>Spanish Series Competition</strong><br />In today’s full announcement of its 12<sup>th</sup> edition, Serielizados also unveiled its four-title Spanish series competition, to be judged by Norwegian showrunner-actress Henriette Steenstrup (“Pørni,” “Nepobaby”), Berlinale Series Market’s Jana Daedelow and Argentine critic Diego Batlle.</p>\n<p>\n\tHeadlining the slate is <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/movistar-plus-2/\">Movistar Plus+</a>/<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/arte-france/\">Arte France</a>’s “Anatomy of a Moment.” Helmed by Alberto Rodríguez, co-writer with Rafael Cobos and Fran Araújo, the series about the 1981 Spanish coup d’état, was one of the most buzzed about titles at the recent San Sebastian Film Festival where it world premiered.</p>\n<p>\n\t“We wanted to open with ‘Moment,’ a highly stylish political biopic that is another sample of a successful co-production between Arte France and Movistar Plus + that have brought us so many good series in recent years,” commented Sala, before adding: “It’s not that common to film a show about recent historical events in Spanish TV drama during these polarized times, and this is a show about people who need to give something up in order to get something bigger than themselves: democracy; It’s about how fragile those days really were.”</p>\n<p>\n\tUnderscoring Movistar Plus+’ role as top purveyor of quality Spanish drama output, the Original “Yakarta” – reuniting writer Diego San José and helmer Elena Trapé of Series Mania’s award-winning “Celeste” – will also be showcased in competition, ahead of its national premiere on Nov. 6. ‘It’s one of my personal top choices as it comes from one of our favorite showrunners, Diego San José. who won best screenplay last year at Serielizados with ‘Celeste,’ said Sala.</p>\n<p>\n\tIn “Yakarta,” Javier Cámara (“Rapa”) plays Joserra, a former Olympic badminton player who makes end meet by teaching PE at a state high school. His uneventful life takes a new turn when he discovers at a school tournament the young prodigy Mar (Carla Quílez, a San Sebastian winner for “Motherhood”). </p>\n<div>\n<figure>\n<p><img srcset=\"https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Yakarta-Movistar-Plus.jpg 1107w, https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Yakarta-Movistar-Plus.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Yakarta-Movistar-Plus.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Yakarta-Movistar-Plus.jpg?resize=1000,667 1000w, https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Yakarta-Movistar-Plus.jpg?resize=910,607 910w, https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Yakarta-Movistar-Plus.jpg?resize=681,454 681w, https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Yakarta-Movistar-Plus.jpg?resize=450,300 450w, https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Yakarta-Movistar-Plus.jpg?resize=250,167 250w\" src=\"https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Yakarta-Movistar-Plus.jpg?w=1024\" alt=\"\" />\n\t</p>\n<figcaption>\n\t\t\t\t\t<span>Yakarta</span>\n\t</figcaption>\n</figure>\n</div>\n<p>\n\tThe show is produced by 100 Balas, part of The Mediapro Studio, and Buendía Estudios Canarias<br />From Secuoya Studios and pubcaster <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/rtve/\">RTVE</a>, the high-end historical thriller “The 39” (“Los 39”) tells the fact-based story of the 39 men that Christopher Columbus abandoned in 1492 on the Hispaniola Island, now the Dominican Republic.The show, created by David Martínez and Roberto Serrano, is co-helmed by Max Lemcke (“Casual Day”) and Jorge Saavedra (“Zorro,” “Road to Arcadia”).\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\tIn a totally different genre, “Argi Gorriak,” a Basque series ordered by pubcaster EITB and starring Itziar Ituño of Netflix “Money Heist” fame, weighs in as a quirky family comedy drama about a dubbing actress whose life is turned upside down by the return of her ex-husband, physically incapacitated by a recent stroke.

For Sala, this “unusual fact for Serializados’s 12<sup>th</sup> edition” reflects the successful push in quality scripted content backed by pubcaster EiTB and the Basque region’s incentives.</p>\n<p>\n\tClosing the festival will be the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/3cat/\">3Cat</a> -Vértigo Films’ young adult drama “Sense FilTRES”, which just scooped best screenplay at Cádiz’s South International Series Festival.

    "body": "<div><p>\n\tAmid rising backlash from fellow comedians and human rights advocates, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/bill-burr/\">Bill Burr</a> is defending his appearance at the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/riyadh-comedy-festival/\">Riyadh Comedy Festival</a>, calling it “one of the top three experiences I’ve had” and “mind blowing.”</p>\n<p>\n\t“It was great to experience that part of the world and to be a part of the first comedy festival over there in Saudi Arabia,” Burr said on the Sept. 29 episode of his “<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TXf2e5nHKfI\" target=\"_blank\">Monday Morning Podcast</a>.” “The royals loved the show. Everyone was happy. The people that were doing the festival were thrilled.”\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\tDuring the episode, Burr talks about arriving in Riyadh with apprehension due to the years of negative portrayals in Western media. “You think everybody’s going to be screaming ‘Death to America’ and they’re going to have like fucking machetes and want to chop my head off,” Burr said. “Because this is what I’ve been fed about that part of the world.”\n</p>\n<p>\n\tHis biggest surprise, came from the restaurants available and from the audience itself, which he described as young, diverse and eager to engage with stand-up comedy.</p>\n<p>\n\t“Is that a Starbucks next to a Pizza Hut next to a Burger King next to a McDonald’s? They got a fucking Chili’s over here!”</p>\n<p>\n\tHe continued: “I had to stop a couple times during the show and say, ‘I’ll be honest with you guys, I cannot fucking believe any of you have any idea who I am,’” Burr said. “It was just this great exchange of energy. They know their reputation. So they were extra friendly.”</p>\n<p>\n\tFellow comedian Atsuko Okatsuka said she previously declined an invitation to perform, sharing excerpts from a contract that included bans on political, religious and LGBTQ+ content. Burr acknowledged those original restrictions but claims they were loosened after artists pushed back.\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\t“The organizers were told, ‘If you want some good comedians, this isn’t going to work,’” Burr explained. “To their credit, they said, ‘All right, what do we got to do?’ And they negotiated it all the way down to just a couple things: don’t make fun of royals or religion.”</p>\n<p>\n\tAccording to Burr, he was able to perform most of his regular act with only minor adjustments.</p>\n<p>\n\tIn one tense moment, he recalls beginning a joke about sex, only to see a couple get up and leave.</p>\n<p>\n\t“I’m like, ‘Oh fuck. Am I in trouble?’” Burr recalled. “But they came back a few minutes later, and afterward, security told me, ‘You’re fine. All that stuff is allowed here.’”</p>\n<p>\n\tBut not everyone is convinced.</p>\n<p>\n\tOn Monday, comedian David Cross <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/2025/tv/news/david-cross-slams-bill-burr-riyadh-comedy-festival-1236534601/\">released a scathing public statement</a> blasting performers who agreed to take the stage in Riyadh.</p>\n<p>\n\t“I am disgusted and deeply disappointed in this whole gross thing,” Cross wrote. “That people I admire…would condone this totalitarian fiefdom for… what, a fourth house? A boat? More sneakers?”</p>\n<p>\n\tCross singled out Burr, Dave Chappelle, and Louis C.K., arguing they had forfeited the right to complain about censorship or “cancel culture” in the U.S.</p>\n<p>\n\tOther comics such as Marc Maron and Shane Gillis <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/2025/politics/global/marc-maron-human-rights-riyadh-comedy-festival-1236530044/\">have also publicly condemned the festival</a>, along with Human Rights Watch calling the festival part of the Saudi government’s long-running “whitewashing” campaign on an interview with CBS News.</p>\n<p>\n\tThe Riyadh Comedy Festival, which runs through mid-October, is the latest effort by Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman’s Vision 2030 initiative to modernize and diversify Saudi Arabia’s economy through entertainment and tourism. In addition to Burr, the lineup includes Kevin Hart, Aziz Ansari, Whitney Cummings, Pete Davidson, Gabriel Iglesias and others. The festival’s ties to Saudi Arabia’s controversial Minister of Entertainment, Turki Al-Sheikh, and the kingdom’s broader human rights record — including the 2018 murder of journalist Jamal Khashoggi, alleged ties to the 9/11 attacks, and repression of LGBTQ+ individuals and political dissidents — continue to cast a shadow over the event.</p>\n<p>\n\tDespite the criticism, Burr remained unapologetic on the episode. </p>\n<p>\n\t“People are cool. Governments are the problem,” Burr said. “Every time I travel, I learn the same thing. And the people I met there? They just wanted to laugh. And they fucking did.”</p>\n</div>"

    "body": "<div><p>\n\t<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/shane-black/\">Shane Black</a>‘s name is synonymous with some of the most macho movies ever made, including “Lethal Weapon,” “The Nice Guys” and “The Last Boy Scout.” His newest film, “<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/play-dirty/\">Play Dirty</a>,” now streaming on Amazon Prime Video, is no exception. A contemporary interpretation of Donald E. Westlake’s classic “Parker” novels about a high-stakes robber, the film stars <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/mark-wahlberg/\">Mark Wahlberg</a> and LaKeith Stanfield as thieves aiming to pull the biggest international heist of their lives. Yet a globetrotting action movie starring two alpha dogs was well-trodden territory for Black, who has spent his life working with larger-than-life A-listers like Robert Downey Jr., Arnold Schwarzenegger, Bruce Willis and Russell Crowe. Needless to say, he’s figured out the method to maintain control on set when he’s in the director’s chair.\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\t“I’ve been absolutely blessed to work with some of the ‘magic people,'” Black says. “‘Magic people,’ to me, are those that you hire and say, ‘There’s that actor that does that thing. There he is, doing that thing that we paid him for.’ But the more interesting thing has always been when you hire them, knowing you don’t quite know what you’re going to get — you just know it’s going to be great. I’ve worked with a number of those, chief among them Robert Downey Jr., who was just lightning in a bottle. You’re not quite sure what you’re going to get. And I’m happy to take credit for it when suddenly it’s on the screen.”\n</p>\n<p>\n\tWahlberg showed his magic in a unique way, coming in with a preparedness that reflects his notorious work ethic.</p>\n<p>\n\t“Mark showed up having memorized the script,” Black says. “He knew every nuance of it. He didn’t sit before, mumbling — he knew all the lines, so then you could vary from that. If someone wants to improv, and there were some people on the set who were particularly prone to that, Mark keeps up. Mark just jumps at it. He sees a chance to fire back. That sort of being in the moment is what I like about Mark in particular, because as much preparation as he does, when he steps onto set, he lets go and is in the now. I think that’s an actor’s greatest asset: to let the previous work inform the performance, but not be thinking about it when you’re in the moment.”\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\tMany of Black’s scripts are defined by a bickering buddy dynamic, and “Play Dirty,” which he wrote with Charles Mondry and Anthony Bagarozzi, is no different. Wahlberg’s foil is played by Stanfield, and Black, an actor himself, says the “Atlanta” alum approaches the craft in a completely different way.</p>\n<p>\n\t“I was talking to LaKeith about acting and I said, ‘I was always a little bit nervous. I felt like I couldn’t quite get there.'” Black says. “And he said, ‘I don’t understand that, because to me you have all these choices. You just pick one. You’re at the hub of a wheel, and all these spokes are going out to the edge, to the behavior of the character. You go, “Which one do I want to take?”‘ It’s like that frustrating musician: when you can’t write music and you say, ‘How do you do it?’ He goes, ‘Oh my God, there are melodies in the air. You just pluck one.’ It’s like, dude, it’s not that easy, you know? But to him it is, because he’s just an inquisitive soul.”</p>\n<div>\n<figure>\n<p><img srcset=\"https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/MCDPLDI_MG002.jpg 3000w, https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/MCDPLDI_MG002.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/MCDPLDI_MG002.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/MCDPLDI_MG002.jpg?resize=1920,1280 1920w, https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/MCDPLDI_MG002.jpg?resize=1360,907 1360w, https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/MCDPLDI_MG002.jpg?resize=1000,667 1000w, https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/MCDPLDI_MG002.jpg?resize=910,607 910w, https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/MCDPLDI_MG002.jpg?resize=681,454 681w, https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/MCDPLDI_MG002.jpg?resize=450,300 450w, https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/MCDPLDI_MG002.jpg?resize=250,167 250w\" src=\"https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/MCDPLDI_MG002.jpg?w=1024\" alt=\"\" />\n\t</p>\n<figcaption>\n\t\t\t\t\t<span>Mark Wahlberg and LaKeith Stanfield in “Play Dirty.”</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t©MGM/Courtesy Everett Collection\n\t</figcaption>\n</figure>\n</div>\n<p>\n\tWhile he’s quick to cite the talents of his cast and crew, Black’s reputation in Hollywood as a nice guy who gets results precedes him. Jules Daly, who produced “Play Dirty” as well as big action features like “The Tomorrow War” and “Ghosted,” says that the chance to work with Black was what first drew her to the project.</p>\n<p>\n\t“There’s talk about Shane Black being a bit reserved, being shy, being insular, being brilliant but being those things — and we had the greatest time,” Daly says. “Working with anyone who’s a writer and director for a producer is just such a pleasure because you can be on the go, you can be sitting at video village and make a change. We also had [co-writers] Anthony and Chuck with us. So it wasn’t like we were sending pages overnight back to the U.S. and waking up to them and they weren’t good enough the next day. But sitting with the three of them and making the movie was just an absolute pleasure and a laugh.”</p>\n<p>\n\tDaly also says that Black’s previous hits made one specific part of her job easier.</p>\n<p>\n\t“More so than any director I’ve worked with, all cast wants to work with Shane Black,” she says. “There was nobody that we couldn’t get on the phone, no one that didn’t want to be in the movie. It was all just about scheduling. That was more remarkable than almost any director I’ve worked with. It was just such an easy movie to cast and the cast is delicious.”\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\tDespite the success of his previous work, Black says it’s critical for him to remain focused by toning down the outside noise.</p>\n<p>\n\t“Shutting off the hype is necessary in the same way that you can’t think about the money,” he says. “When you’re hired to write a script, you can’t think, ‘Oh my God, this page was this much money, it better be good.’ Once you take on the job, the job becomes it. That’s all there is, the focus on and attention to bringing whatever instinct you have to it.”</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd sometimes that comes with having to trust your gut and not get too meta. For example, many of Black’s most famous movies are set during Christmas, from “Lethal Weapon” to “Kiss Kiss Bang Bang” to “Iron Man 3.” But even though Black knew a yuletide feel in “Play Dirty” would get a nod of recognition from fans, at first he didn’t want to lean into it.</p>\n<p>\n\t“People often talk about the Christmas motif that I sometimes have in movies,” Black says. “Once people notice that, that jig is up. I would do it, but at the same time, I was thinking, ‘Now that it’s sort of a one-trick pony that people are actually noticing, it’s actually part of what you called “the hype,” then it’s kind of lost its luster.’ Now, in this movie, I wanted to do winter in New York City, and I thought, ‘Oh my God, here we go again.’ We could set it in February on Presidents’ Day, but you know, why? We’re in New York, it’s winter, might as well be Christmas.”</p>\n<p>\n\tThat sense of adventure is what Black says keeps him making movies.</p>\n<p>\n\t“I tend to look for things that, especially as I get older, are arguments to myself to still believe in a sense of wonder, to still believe in writing the next chapter,” he says. “Themes that are important seem to be people who get knocked down and find a reason — despite themselves — to get up and continue.”</p>\n<p>\n\tWatch the “Play Dirty” trailer below.</p>\n<figure><p>\n<iframe width=\"500\" height=\"281\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/6paP2-ry-QY?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\"></iframe>\n</p></figure>\n</div>"

She spoke directly to the next generation, instilling hope, responsibility, and the belief that every individual can make a difference. She inspired millions to care, to act, and to hope. She never stopped.”</p>\n<p>\n\t“My last message to Jane was simple: ‘You are my hero.’ Now, we all must carry the torch for her in protecting our one shared home.”</p>\n<p>\n\tHe asked that readers honor her legacy by supporting the <a href=\"https://janegoodall.org/\" target=\"_blank\">Jane Goodall Institute</a> and other conservation groups she cared about. </p>\n<p>\n\tLast year, it was announced that DiCaprio’s Appian Way production company would make a <a href=\"https://deadline.com/2024/12/jane-goodall-biopic-appian-way-disney-eleanor-catton-1236188761/\" target=\"_blank\">feature biopic</a> about Goodall’s life for Disney. It would mark the first time an actress would portray her on film. Eleanor Catton is writing the screenplay for the film, which is still in development.</p>\n</div>"
