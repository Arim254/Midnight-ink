    "body": "<div><p>\n\tMexico’s Academy of Cinematographic Arts & Science has opted to send Pierre Saint Martin’s acclaimed debut feature “We Shall Not Be Moved’ (“No nos moverán”) to vie for the best international feature <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/oscar/\">Oscar</a>.</p>\n<p>\n\tProduced by Varios Lobos’ Víctor Léycegui and Pablo Zimbrón, the black & white drama recently won four of Mexico’s prestigious Ariel awards: best first feature, screenplay, actress and new actor. It is also being sent to represent Mexico at Spain’s Oscar equivalent, the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/goyas/\">Goyas</a>.\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\tThe drama follows 67-year-old Socorro, a retired lawyer who is obsessed with finding the soldier that killed her brother back in 1968 during the infamous Tlatelolco massacre. This was where university students protesting against the upcoming Olympics were gunned down by Mexican armed forces. Her relentless fixation has impacted her relationships with her sister Esperanza (70) and her son Jorge (45).\n</p>\n<p>\n\tOne day, she receives a vital clue that will lead her to this soldier. She decides to carry out an outlandish operation to avenge her brother’s death but risks putting her relationship with her family, her legacy and even her own life at risk.</p>\n<p>\n\tSaid Saint Martin: “’We Shall Not Be Moved’ seeks to reclaim our country’s historical memory in a more humane way, starting with my mother’s family history, which resonates with other families who lost loved ones in the massacre of October 2, 1968, in Mexico.”</p>\n<p>\n\t“The main character, based on my mother, who has survived many tragedies with humor, was the compass for understanding that this drama had to be portrayed with humor in order to criticize the many sufferings faced by the characters, such as nostalgia and grief,” he continued, adding: “We made this film as a celebration of life from the darkness of the human soul. A laugh full of pain, and a tribute to hope, which, as Julio Cortázar said, does not belong to humans; ‘hope is life itself defending itself.’”\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\tFor lead actress Luisa Huertas, who won an Ariel for her performance, “Pierre Saint Martin and Iker Compeán’s script sets 57 years after that date and places us in the present of a family like many others in Mexico in the aftermath they have been left with. It is an intimate, loving, and entertaining story that has touched people not only in México, but also in Europe, Latin America and the United States.”</p>\n<p>\n\t“We Shall Not Be Moved” beat out nine other contenders by more established filmmakers, among them Rodrigo Garcia’s “Las locuras;” Mexico’s first stop motion animated feature “I Am Frankelda;” “Hombres integros” by Alejandro Andrade; “Corina” by Urzula Barba Hopfner and the documentary “Concierto para otras manos” by Ernesto González Díaz. </p>\n<p>\n\tDistributed by Nicolas Celis’ <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/pimienta-films/\">Pimienta Films</a> (“Roma”), the pic had a limited release and according to Léycegui, earned ₱1.5 million (approx. $75,000) and lured 23,000 admissions. Talks are underway with an SVOD platform, he said, adding that the release was limited to arthouse cinemas and that it performed better than other similar films.</p>\n<p>\n\t“’We Shall Not Be Moved’ has surprised us at every stage of distribution and exhibition. The project began as a debut feature with a limited budget that simply sought to give Pierre the opportunity to show that he had a powerful voice as a director and that he really had something to say,” said Léycegui, who noted that the film has participated in more than 40 international festivals and generated more than double the projected box office.</p>\n<p>\n\tJoshua Sobel, Martín Burillo and Saint Martin serve as executive producers.</p>\n<p>\n\tThe Oscar international feature shortlist will be announced on Dec. 16 while the final five nominees will be announced on Jan. 22. The 98<sup>th</sup> Academy Awards take place on March 15, 2026 while Spain’s Goyas are on Feb. 28 next year.</p>\n<div><p><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Still-9.jpg?w=1024\" srcset=\"https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Still-9.jpg 1772w, https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Still-9.jpg?resize=150,79 150w, https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Still-9.jpg?resize=300,158 300w\" /></p></div>\n</div>"

    "body": "<div><p>\n\tThe third edition of San Sebastian’s Creative Investors’ Conference, co-organized with <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/caa-media-finance/\">CAA Media Finance</a>, wrapped Wednesday on a spirited note with a mano a mano between CAA Media Finance’s co-head Roeg Sutherland and 193 CEO Patrick Wachsberger, followed by execs weighing the relative merits of the U.S. and Europe. </p>\n<p>\n\tNobody claimed that these are the best of times. “We live in a time as that is not so much difficult as very specific,” said Sutherland, at a fireside chat with Wachsberger. “It’s have or have not. If you hit a target, you are doing just as well as you were doing in pre-pandemic times. If you don’t hit it hard, there’s no parachute.”\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\tWith other speakers laying it down the line on issues from independent production to scale, big pre-sales, Latin and America and Africa, this was a highly informative state-of-the-nation take on the Europe and the U.S., where the days of the world’s being centered around American films according to some takes may now be over.  \n</p>\n<p>\n\t<strong>The Touchstone: Talent</strong></p>\n<p>\n\t“The most important thing is not the idea itself, but the people, the creators. That’s what really excites me,” said Domingo Corral. That was his core strategy as director of fiction & entertainment at Movistar Plus+. It will now be his touchstone tactic as an independent producer. Companies, however large, share the same talent-led thinking, one of the only tried-and-tested formulas for success since Gaumont launched in 1895. “The way we work is [asking] how do we best support our production companies on making the films that they want to make?” said <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/fremantle/\">Fremantle</a>’s Christian Vesper. Talent takes in both producers and creators, he added. \n\t</p>\n<p>\n\t<strong>Scale</strong></p>\n<p>\n\tQuestions of scale threaded many European panelists’ comments. “Europe now has capital markets access and powerhouses,” said Anton’s Sebastien Raybaud. “The one thing still missing maybe is projects’ scale.” “It’s challenging to finance films from Europe at $20 million-$25 million to $50 million,” noted Rodolphe Buet, at Studio TF1. “If we are going to compete at Cannes, Venice or the Oscars, we need to finance film budgeted at least around $10 million. The whole Movistar Plus+ strategy of film originals was to give creators and the producers enough resources to make bigger films,” added Corral, citing “Sirât,” a Cannes Jury Prize winner, Neon pickup which has sold out the world. </p>\n<p>\n\t<strong>Brands</strong></p>\n<p>\n\tOne possible way forward, for part of the industry, at least. “Brands, such as fashion houses, are starting to play a more significant prominence in film financing, observed David Taghioff at Library Pictures Intl. He remembered Saint Laurent’s boarding Emilia Pérez,” which he co-financed. “It recognized that it could either pay for it as a marketer or get the same marketing assets, but yet have a recoupment and a profit position.” Brand involvement has also evolved. “Before it was about product placement. Now it’s much more about creative alignment, where a brand wants to be associated with the director or a certain themes,” Iconoclast’s Robert Walak noted.</p>\n<p>\n\t<strong>The Sales Business’ Challenges</strong></p>\n<p>\n\tIn the roaring 1990s, the heyday of pre-sales and output deals, Patrick Wachsberger was able to cover 125% of a budget via bank finance and pre-sales, or so interviewer Roeg Sutherland in a warm humored chat. Those days will never come back. One problem is that very few bigger U.S. distributors are pre-buying or streamers paying equitable license fees for post-theatrical Pay 1 and Pay 2 windows, AGC Studios Stuart Ford commented at Locarno’s StepIn. “We take risk on most of our films because at the end of the day, most likely you won’t pre-sell the U.S.,” said Raybaud at San Sebastián. “You look at all the major countries, you really only have kind of three distributors with the capacity of being big and reliable,” said Wachsberger. “When you talk to those big distributors today, you realize they already have their slate until 2027 or mid-2027,” he added. Yet there’s light at the end of a soon-to-reached tunnel,” Sutherland argued. “The U.S. market is disrupted, but there’ll be four new distribution companies by January,” he added.  \n\t</p>\n<p>\n\t<strong>U.S. Downside: Costs and Tax Credits </strong></p>\n<p>\n\tProducers don’t just come to Europe for the croissants or paella. The cost differential with the U.S. is now dramatic. Fremantle’s Christian Vesper noted that on “Chronology of Water,” in order to make Kristen Stewart’s feature debut, “it needed to be done in a way that minimized risk, so that she would have more freedom.” Stewart had imagined shooting in Portland, Oregon. They ended up shooting outside Riga, Latvia, as the Baltic States become an international shoot destination of choice. “We have a little problem in the U.S. in that it’s very difficult to get tax credit paid back,” said Sutherland. “Louisiana’s difficult, New York impossible. And that’s coupled with the fact that making a movie there is that much more expensive,” he added.</p>\n<p>\n\t<strong>Co-Production</strong></p>\n<p>\n\tOr collaboration. “Our clients still need big local successes and audiences want local products,” said Mediawan’s Elisabeth d’Arvieu. Another way to go, however, is for Mediawan companies to partner on production and sometimes joint acquisition of IP. She name-checked European flagship title ‘The Count of Monte Cristo,” produced by Italy’s Palomar and DEMD Productions, both Mediawan companies, and now Jean-Pierre Jeunet’s “Violette,” Palomar partnering with France’s 24 25 Films to adapt Valérie Perrin’s literary sensation “Fresh Water for Flowers,” which sold over 3 million copies worldwide.</p>\n<p>\n\t<strong>Latin America, the Way Forward</strong></p>\n<p>\n\tOne way: “Action,” “a genre that probably isn’t very akin to Latin America,” but “is working very well, said Amazon MGM Studios, citing Mapuche eco-actioned “Mayen,” made with Fabula, Andrés Baiz’s gasoline smuggler thriller “Pimpinero: Blood and Oil” and now Mexico’s “Venganza.” Again, scale is an issue. “We have to grow in terms of a film’s size, to be in the range of between $10 million-$25 million, to compete,” said Larraín. 10 years ago auteur fest pics cost $1 million. Now they cost $5 million and have started to have a cast, instead of using non-actors, to compete globally,” said Snowglobe’s Katrin Pors. “Raising scale, they do get distribution in Europe and a big part of financing out of Europe.” Some of the momentum may come from the private sector. MUV Capital’s Laura Rossi noted that both Oscar winner “I’m Still Here” and “A Dog’s Will 2,” Brazil’s two recent big box office hits, were made with totally private finance.   \n\t</p>\n<p>\n\tMore to come </p>\n</div>"

Here a miserable delivery boy gets by disposing of mummies recovered in Iquique, North of Chile. “The Chinchorro mummies emerge as figures that guide the characters’ journey, inviting us to explore the memory of bodies that transcend death,” says producer Rodrigo Díaz. Project teams Chile’s Axolotl and Mimbre Films with Belgium’s Michigan. \n\t</p>\n<p>\n\tBaumeister’s second feature after the high-profile Toronto player and San Sebastián winner “Daughter of Rage,” begins on a full moon night in the Mexican desert, Virginia, a young Nicaraguan migrant, is rescued by Aurora, a sheep shearer.

    "body": "<div><p>\n\tIt’s time for <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/rob-lowe/\">Rob Lowe</a> to hit “<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/the-floor/\">The Floor</a>” again. </p>\n<p>\n\tThe fourth season of “<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/9-1-1/\">9-1-1</a>: Lone Star” alum Lowe’s trivia challenge debuts on Fox Wednesday with a few new twists, including a USA-themed competition and a chance to really screw with your fellow competitors.</p>\n<p>\n\t“The stakes are bigger and we have a couple of new wrinkles to the game that I think are super, super cool,” Lowe told <em>Variety</em>. “First of all, this year we’re playing state against state, so every state and country is represented, which is really fun. I was born in Virginia, raised in Ohio, lived my whole life in California, so I was rooting for those three states. That was fun. But we also have a category swap. Now if you win three rounds in a row, you could look out on The Floor and go, ‘I want your category,’ steal someone’s category, and then they have to play yours.”\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\tSee below for more from<em> Variety</em>‘s chat with Lowe about the Season 4 premiere of “The Floor,” his upcoming horror movie “The Third Parent” and film project “The Musical,” and if he’ll reprise his “9-1-1: Lone Star” role Owen Strand on brother Chad Lowe’s new ABC series “9-1-1: Nashville.” \n</p>\n\t<h5>\n\t\tHow do you prep for playing “Host Rob” on “The Floor”? Does it come naturally at this point?\t</h5>\n<p>\n\tThe thing that has surprised me the most is how much I look forward to doing the show every year, and it’s because I get to utilize muscles that I don’t get to utilize in other work. It’s part one-man show, it’s part stand-up comic act. You have to think like a producer on the spot, like, what do you lean into? What do you talk about? What do not talk about? It’s part air traffic controller, because you’ve got someone in your ear reminding you of the gameplay and the stakes and where the game is headed. It’s all on a big, beautiful stage, there’s a live audience. There’s so much stimuli that I get really pumped doing it. And I think my favorite part of it is being able to ad-lib. The banter with the players, that’s for sure my favorite part.\n\t</p>\n\t<h5>\n\t\tWhat’s a particularly good incident of banter you can tease from “The Floor” Season 4?\t</h5>\n<p>\n\tWell, when I realized that one of the categories was “Brat Pack,” I was like, “Boy, if my picture isn’t first, there is going to be hell to pay.”</p>\n\t<h5>\n\t\tYou have two movies coming up, one being “The Musical” with Gillian Jacobs and Will Brill.\t</h5>\n<p>\n\tYes! This is one of the smartest and most audacious scripts that I have read in years. And it’s a first time writer for basically a first time director. And to see newcomers with this level of craft and intelligence and confidence, it kind of reminds me of when I read “Thank You for Smoking” years ago, and it very much was giving me like young- Alexander Payne-“Election” vibes.</p>\n\t<h5>\n\t\tThere’s also the horror film “The Third Parent,” which is based on a viral internet horror story.\t</h5>\n<p>\n\tYes, it’s a movie with Bleecker Street that I made in the spring that will be coming out I believe with a February release date. It’s based on a sub-Reddit of really weird, bizarre, sort of cult IP about the legend of a maybe-person, maybe-creature, maybe-robot alien that gets into people’s homes and then holds them hostage. It’s extraordinarily creepy. And I play the father, and when they told me who was playing the strange alien and said it was Crispin Glover, I was so in.</p>\n\t<h5>\n\t\tJust as you exited Ryan Murphy’s “9-1-1” franchise with the end of Fox’s “Lone Star” spinoff in the spring, your brother is at work on ABC’s new spinoff, “9-1-1: Nashville,” which premieres this fall. Have you been keeping up with what they’re doing and comparing notes on the new emergencies?\t</h5>\n<p>\n\tI’m really excited. I’ve been getting live updates from my brother Chad, who’s the executive producer/director, and it’s all my friends on it. I play golf with Chris O’Donnell. Kimberly Williams-Paisley I’ve worked with twice, who’s the most adorable, wonderful woman. And there are a couple other folks on the show that I know, and I keep hearing people go, “It’s crazy! We’re hanging from a bridge!” I’m like, “Yeah, that’s what you’ve signed up for!” I’m just glad I don’t have to wear the fireman outfit in the Nashville summer; that’s the number one thing I’ve been thinking about.</p>\n\t<h5>\n\t\tDo you see yourself reprising your own “9-1-1” franchise role as Owen Strand for “Nashville”?\t</h5>\n<p>\n\tI love Owen Strand and I love how people miss that character. It means a lot to me that the people really related to him and liked him. And I don’t ever rule anything out, but at the moment I don’t think there are any plans to do it.\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\t<em>This interview has been edited and condensed.</em></p>\n</div>"

    "body": "<div><p>\n\t<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/vince-gilligan/\">Vince Gilligan</a> is staying put with the renewal of his overall deal at <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/sony-pictures-television/\">Sony Pictures Television</a>, his studio home for the past two decades. The renewal is four years, with Gilligan set to continue developing and producing scripted series for Sony TV under his High Bridge production banner. </p>\n<p>\n\t“Every three or four years I figure it’s time to try someplace new…but then I remember I’ve got it pretty great at Sony Pictures Television,” said Vince Gilligan. “I really like Katherine, Ravi, and all the folks there. They’re excellent partners who treat me well — and they do a fine job of looking out for ‘Breaking Bad,’ ‘Better Call Saul’ and now ‘Pluribus. ‘Therefore, I’m proud (and a little sad) to be working for Hollywood’s last independent studio. I think our industry would benefit from more of them.”\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\tGilligan is best known as the creator of “Breaking Bad,” which was produced by Sony TV. The series aired for five critically-acclaimed seasons on AMC and is widely regarded as one of the best shows of the 21st century if not all time. He followed that up with the spinoff “Better Call Saul,” which explored the pre- and post-“Breaking Bad” life of Saul Goodman, once again played by Bob Odenkirk. Gilligan and Sony were also behind the “Breaking Bad” followup movie “El Camino,” which closed out the story of Jesse Pinkman, played by Aaron Paul. \n</p>\n<p>\n\t“Beyond being a legend and a true giant in our business, Vince Gilligan is an incredible human being, who is always looking out for and shining the spotlight on others,” said Katherine Pope, president of Sony Pictures Television Studios. “He’s a humble genius, the rarest of the rare, and we couldn’t be prouder to continue our unprecedented partnership with him.”\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\tNext up for Gilligan is the Apple TV+ series “Pluribus,” which has been picked up for two seasons at the streamer. “Better Call Saul” star Rhea Seehorn leads the series, which debuts with its first two episodes on Nov. 7 followed by new episodes weekly through Dec. 26. </p>\n<p>\n\t“Pluribus” is described as a “genre-bending original in which the most miserable person on Earth must save the world from happiness.” In addition to Seehorn, the series stars Karolina Wydra and Carlos-Manuel Vesga, with guest stars Miriam Shor and Samba Schutte. </p>\n<p>\n\tGilligan is repped by CAA and Del Shaw Moonves.</p>\n<p>\n\t“Pluribus” is produced by Sony Pictures Television and executive produced by Gilligan alongside Gordon Smith, Alison Tatlock, Diane Mercer, Allyce Ozarski, and Jeff Frost. Jenn Carroll and Trina Siopy serve as co-executive producers.</p>\n</div>"

    "body": "<div><p>\n\t<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/bob-broder/\">Bob Broder</a>, the respected talent agent who ran the prosperous Broder Kurland literary agency for nearly 30 years before seguing to head Chuck Lorre Prods., has died after a battle with cancer.</p>\n<p>\n\tBroder died on Sept. 23, surrounded by his family, the Broder family confirmed Wednesday.</p>\n<p>\n\tBroder represented some of the most influential showrunners and directors of the past 50 years, including James Burrows, Chuck Lorre, “Modern Family” co-creator Christopher Lloyd and “Cheers” co-creators Glen Charles and Les Charles. He was a respected elder statesman in the industry. He was known as a tough negotiator on behalf of his A-list clients, and also for his deep sense of personal business ethics. \n\t</p>\n<p>\n\tBroder was famous for always choosing his words carefully and for a stentorian delivery that commanded attention. He was active in industry philanthropy efforts and he served on the board of the Association of Talent Agencies.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tIn a statement confirming Broder’s death, his family pointed to the fact that Broder died on Rosh Hashanah.</p>\n<p>\n\t“In Jewish tradition, passing away on Rosh Hashanah, the Jewish New Year, holds deep spiritual meaning. It is believed that a person who dies on this holy day is viewed as a tzaddik, a person of exceptional righteousness. Bob accepted his cancer diagnosis with grace and dignity, as he did with everything. He leaves behind his beloved wife Cindy, his daughter Julie, son Greg and his cherished extended family,” the statement read.</p>\n<p>\n\tBroder founded Broder Kurland agency with fellow literary agent Norman Kurland in 1978. Broder Kurland was buoyed by the growth of network television in the late 1970s and into the 1990s. Among his other notable clients over the years were top showrunners such as Don Bellisario, Chris Carter and Martha Williamson. The agency also was a training ground for future agency stars, including CAA’s Chris Silbermann and Ted Chervin and UTA’s Matt Rice.\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\tThe dawn of “Cheers,” created by Burrows and the Charles brothers, on NBC in 1982 was a transformative moment for Broder Kurland. The series struggled at first but when on to be one of the most beloved TV comedies of all time and a pillar of NBC’s Must-See TV schedule. It also begat “Frasier,” which extended the riches of “Cheers” and also greatly enhanced the agency’s coffers. </p>\n<p>\n\tBroder’s craggy profile was immortalized in shadow in the closing moments of the final episode of “Cheers” in 1993. Ted Danson’s Sam Malone is closing up the show’s titular bar for the night when a man walks up to its distinctive wooden door hoping to get a drink. Malone shouts to the man “Sorry, we’re closed.” Wearing a classic fedora, Broder’s profile is seen briefly as the spurned patron walks away. That bit was an in-joke nod to the fact that Broder tried hard to squeeze a 12th season out of “Cheers,” but Danson was ready to move on.</p>\n<p>\n\tBroder Kurland was acquired by ICM in 2006. Broder joined ICM’s senior management ranks and stayed through 2012, when the agency completed the management buyout of its private equity owner, Rizvi Traverse. Broder then moved to Warner Bros.-based Chuck Lorre Productions, where he continued to advise his longtime client on business matters. </p>\n<p>\n\tBroder was instrumental in overseeing Lorre’s interests on massive international global licensing deals for Lorre-produced comedies such as “The Big Bang Theory.” Broder’s oversight became even more crucial as the streaming era opened up wide new moneymaking horizons for vintage series.</p>\n<p>\n\tBroder was an active supporter and served on the boards of such charities as UCLA’s Center for Early Education, the Saban Free Clinic and others. The family requests that donations may be made in his honor to the Dian Fossey Gorilla Fund International or The Saban Clinic.</p>\n<p>\n\tDuring his tenure at ICM, Broder established an agent trainee program to help educate newcomers and boost the career prospects of assistants, coordinators, colleagues and young agents.</p>\n<p>\n\t“The program is designed to take the really ambitious, highly motivated, smart young people who are working for us and give them a great opportunity to learn more about the business and more about themselves,” Broder told <em>Variety </em>in 2011. “The common wisdom we tell them is, ‘We’re going to work you very hard, pay you very little and hopefully you will learn a great deal that will serve you well for the future.’ ”\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\tIn his private life, Broder enjoyed spending time at his home in Utah, playing poker, hosting cigar Fridays in his garden with friends and doting on his beloved Golden Retrievers.</p>\n<p>\n\t<em>Here is </em>Daily Variety<em>‘s coverage of Bob Broder’s ICM training program, published June 6, 2011.</em></p>\n<div>\n<figure>\n<p><img srcset=\"https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/clipping0-2025-09-24T122949.220.jpg 2176w, https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/clipping0-2025-09-24T122949.220.jpg?resize=118,150 118w, https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/clipping0-2025-09-24T122949.220.jpg?resize=235,300 235w\" src=\"https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/clipping0-2025-09-24T122949.220.jpg?w=802\" alt=\"\" />\n\t</p>\n<figcaption>\n\t\t\t\t\t<span>From the June 6, 2011, edition of <em>Daily Variety</em></span>\n\t</figcaption>\n</figure>\n</div>\n</div>"

    "body": "<div><p>\n\tOn Tuesday night, viewers in more than 60 U.S. markets couldn’t watch “<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/jimmy-kimmel/\">Jimmy Kimmel</a> Live!” — <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/2025/tv/news/jimmy-kimmel-chokes-up-return-suspension-charlie-kirk-1236526490/\">his first show back</a> after a weeklong suspension by Disney — on their local <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/abc/\">ABC</a> stations. The Kimmel boycotts by two big TV station groups, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/sinclair/\">Sinclair</a> and <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/nexstar/\">Nexstar</a>, clearly drove many fans in those areas to watch his monologue on YouTube, where ABC posted it around midnight ET. It quickly became the show’s most-viewed video on the platform so far in 2025.\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\tOstensibly, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/2025/tv/news/sinclair-abc-stations-wont-air-jimmy-kimmel-live-1236526649/\">Sinclair</a> and <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/2025/tv/news/nexstar-will-not-air-jimmy-kimmel-joining-sinclair-boycott-1236526911/\">Nexstar are refusing to air “Jimmy Kimmel Live!”</a> in protest of comments Kimmel made last week about Charlie Kirk’s killer. (Sinclair and Nexstar aired news programming on their ABC stations in the late-night timeslot instead.) There’s this much-discussed plotline: FCC chairman Brendan Carr, who wants to promote local TV stations’ efforts to push back on liberal-leaning programming, suggested the agency would pursue investigations into “news distortion” complaints against Kimmel’s show and thereby, in not so many words, cause the FCC to make life difficult for them unless “Jimmy Kimmel Live!” was canceled. Critics cried foul — accusing Carr of attempting to thwart speech that he and the Trump administration don’t like. Nexstar and Sinclair both want to FCC to lift the 39% TV station ownership cap rule, with Nexstar’s $6.2 billion proposed Tegna takeover requiring FCC approval and a change to the ownership cap. Ergo, the obvious conclusion is that those companies want to get in Carr’s good graces.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tWhatever the motivations for Sinclair and Nexstar, the question now is: When will they bring back “Kimmel” (if ever) to their stations? And who has more to lose — Disney and ABC, or Sinclair and Nexstar?\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\tOn Wednesday, Nexstar said that it is “continuing to evaluate the status of ‘Jimmy Kimmel Live!’ on our ABC-affiliated local television stations, and the show will be preempted while we do so. We are engaged in productive discussions with executives at The Walt Disney Company, with a focus on ensuring the program reflects and respects the diverse interests of the communities we serve.”</p>\n<p>\n\tFor now, it’s unclear how long “Jimmy Kimmel Live!” will be off the air on Sinclair’s 38 ABC affiliates and Nexstar’s 28 ABC stations. Reps for Sinclair did not respond to requests for comment, and Nexstar isn’t saying what might happen beyond Wednesday. A Disney spokesperson declined to comment.</p>\n<p>\n\tBut the financial impact on Disney, Nexstar and Sinclair would be “negligible,” even if the Kimmel blackout by the station groups stretched on for a year, according to Matt Dolgin, senior equity analyst at Wall Street research firm Morningstar.</p>\n<p>\n\t“Bottom line, Disney would be out only a few million dollars” if the two station groups, which represent about 25% of the U.S. TV audience, preempted “Jimmy Kimmel Live!” for the next 12 months, according to Dolgin. For the media giant ($91.4 billion in revenue for fiscal 2024) it’s barely a rounding error. Dolgin estimates that Nexstar and Sinclair collectively get less than $10 million in ad revenue annually from “Kimmel.”</p>\n<p>\n\t“Disney will be fine either way. For that reason, I don’t expect the station owners will push this too far,” says Dolgin. “Far more important is the relationship between Disney and these station owners, and, to me, Disney holds all the leverage.” The analyst notes that both station groups have affiliate agreements with Disney expiring in 2026, “and it’s critical for the station owners to renew. This is far more important than current monetary impact of preemptions.”</p>\n<p>\n\tFor Disney, what also limits the financial fallout of the Sinclair and Nexstar disputes is that ABC has owned-and-operated stations in four of the five biggest U.S. markets — New York, Los Angeles, Chicago, Dallas-Fort Worth and Philadelphia — with Tegna-owned WFAA serving the DFW market.</p>\n<p>\n\tOf the ABC affiliates operated by Nexstar and Sinclair, only two are in top 20 U.S. markets: Sinclair’s WJLA in Washington, D.C., and KOMO in Seattle. “We suspect Kimmel’s ratings are lower in the smaller, typically more Republican-leaning markets where Nexstar and Sinclair have ABC affiliates,” Morningstar’s Dolgin says. Nexstar stations affiliated with ABC include KTVX (Salt Lake City), WGNO (New Orleans), WTEN (Albany, N.Y.), WSYR (Syracuse, N.Y.), WKRN (Nashville, Tenn.), WATE (Knoxville, Tenn.), WOTV (Battle Creek, Mich.), WHTM (Harrisburg, Pa.), WRIC (Richmond, Va.), WJGF (Augusta, Ga.), KTKA (Topeka, Kan.) and WTNH (Hartford-New Haven, Conn.). Other Sinclair ABC stations include KDNL (St. Louis), KATV (Little Rock, Ark.), KTUL (Tulsa, Okla.), WTVC (Chattanooga, Tenn.) and WCIV (Charleston, S.C.).\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\tThe risk for the station groups that choose to engage in a prolonged blackout of Kimmel’s show “is that people would be ticked off because they would want to see Kimmel, or in the larger sense ticked off because that kind of specific blocking of content speaks to First Amendment rights,” says Prof. Danilo Yanich of the University of Delaware, a professor of public policy and administration whose research focuses on the media industry.</p>\n<p>\n\tPushback by viewers in Sinclair and Nexstar’s ABC markets, and the perception that the companies are kowtowing to the FCC chairman’s anti-liberal ideology, could be a factor to lead the companies to relent. “You have an FCC chair who is functioning in a way we’ve never seen before — he is openly partisan, saying the FCC’s function is to support the president’s policies,” Yanich says.</p>\n<p>\n\tIf Disney opts to not renew ABC affiliation deals with Sinclair or Nexstar, that would be “the nuclear option,” Yanich says. A wildcard here is that if the FCC raises or eliminates the 39% ownership cap, that could result in much larger TV stations groups that would have more leverage in talks with Disney. “Consolidation is power. The FCC is poised now to remove broadcast ownership restrictions,” says Yanich.</p>\n<p>\n\tDisney would take a financial hit if it opted to not renew the ABC affiliation agreements with Nexstar and Sinclair — but it would “face no existential threat,” according to Dolgin. Indeed, if Disney secured no new affiliate deals in those markets, it could still reach the entire U.S. with its content via its streaming services and cable networks. It would be a disruptive action for Disney and ABC to take, upending the way the broadcast TV biz has worked since its inception, and not its preferred option. But traditional TV has been slowly shrinking for years. And Disney could drive more revenue to its streaming services (Hulu, Disney+ and ESPN Unlimited), which could potentially have 100% of ABC programming, helping to offset the “already modest impact” of any loss of linear television, the analyst adds.</p>\n<p>\n\tIn stark contrast, Dolgin says, Nexstar and Sinclair’s sales “are almost completely dependent on broadcast-affiliated linear television programming, so maintaining affiliation is existential.” In 2024, ABC affiliates accounted for 27% of Sinclair’s total advertising revenue. Nexstar doesn’t disclose revenue by network affiliation, but 19% of its “Big Four” affiliations (ABC, CBS, Fox, NBC) are with ABC.\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\t<strong>SEE ALSO: <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/2025/tv/news/nexstar-sinclair-jimmy-kimmel-live-disney-backfire-fcc-1236525294/\">As Nexstar and Sinclair Take on Disney Over Jimmy Kimmel, the FCC Is Happy — but Will It Backfire?</a></strong></p>\n</div>"
