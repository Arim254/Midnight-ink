    "body": "<div><p>\n\tJust an hour before ABC made the announcement that “<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/jimmy-kimmel/\">Jimmy Kimmel</a> Live!” would return to the airwaves on Tuesday, a group of politicians and Hollywood guild leaders held a press conference and rally in front of the show’s Hollywood studio to urge Disney to bring the show back.</p>\n<p>\n\t“Trump’s allies think the First Amendment comes with an asterisk,” said Rep. <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/laura-friedman/\">Laura Friedman</a> (D-Calif. District 30). “They think that it means it gets free speech as long as Donald Trump likes it. But he does not get to silence dissent. He does not get to tell the American people what to say or what they can and cannot listen to… This is not just about a late night show. It’s about jobs and it’s about our rights as Americans. How the FCC’s job is to protect Americans, not the President’s ego. And I would remind every corporation in America and that many of their business models cannot survive in a world where the government gets to tell them what to say.”\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\tFriedman pulled out a large copy of the First Amendment while adding, “You do not get to cancel the United States Constitution, not today, not tomorrow, not on our watch.”\n</p>\n<p>\n\tThe press conference did not go off without a hitch; a Trump supporter with a microphone loudspeaker attempted to drown out the event; that’s when attendees shouted back “Free speech!” Later, a low flying Fox 11/KTTV helicopter, which was getting video of the event, also drowned out some of the speakers.</p>\n<p>\n\tRep. Brad Sherman (D-Calif. District 32) attempted to point out that the far-right Charlie Kirk has now been lauded as a free speech absolutist — which is why, in his mind, muzzling Kimmel was hypocritical.\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\t“This mafia administration is so bold that they do the language of the mafia in plain sight,” he said. “What this administration is doing, what Brendan Carr is to undermine the words of Charlie Kirk. Charlie Kirk said you should be allowed to say outrageous things. There is rogue speech, there is evil speech, and it is all protected by the First Amendment. Jimmy Kimmel did not contradict the words of Charlie Kirk. Donald Trump did. His FCC.”</p>\n<p>\n\tSherman than said that he personally, as a citizen, planned to boycott and businesses that advertised on ABC at 11:35 p.m. if Kimmel was not brought back. He also said if Kimmel returned, he would support those advertisers — which is presumably what he will now do.</p>\n<p>\n\t“The First Amendment deals with what we do as a government, and the government should be concerned, but we are also private citizens,” he said. “And I, for one, will be looking at who’s advertising on ABC from 11:30 p.m. to 12:30 p.m. And speaking just for my own family, if we see Jimmy Kimmel, we’re going to watch those advertisers. And if we see alternative programming, we will be boycotting those who buy the time.”</p>\n<p>\n\tRep. Judy Chu (D-Calif. District 32), co-chairs the Congressional Creative Rights Caucus, warned that President Trump has been demanding Kimmel’s scalp for some time. “First, Trump wrote, more than two months ago that Jimmy Kimmel’s show should be canceled. Then last week, Trump’s FCC chair said that companies should take action on Kimmel, even saying that they can ‘either do it the easy way or the hard way.’ And the companies got the message.”</p>\n<p>\n\tShe then criticized Nexstar: “ABC’s largest distributor, which needs the FCC’s approval for a $6.2 billion merger, immediately followed his orders and preempted the show, and ABC took it off the air indefinitely. So this was not about comments that a comedian made about Charlie Kirk. This is about a president leveraging the power of the federal government to silence his critics, a plan he’s been open about four months. Now he’s saying that the FCC should go further and cancel the broadcasting licenses of networks that criticize him. Well, are we going to be bullied like that? Are we going to be silenced? Every single one of us has a responsibility to stand up for our constitutional rights that are under attack. And this doesn’t just fall on the shoulders of workers. We need corporations and their executives to start standing up to this coercion.”\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\tRep. Ted Lieu added that this is not just about Kimmel. “Last year, the Supreme Court ruled a unanimous decision that government officials cannot force third parties to punish or suppress the views that government officials is fake, and my message to ABC is very simple: You do not kneel,” he said. “What happens when you kneel? The bully comes after you again, and now the FCC chair Brendan Carr is threatening ABC because he doesn’t like the statements made by ‘The View.’ When is this going to stop? ABC, you have a choice. You can continue to be bowing or you can stand up for yourself, stand up for the First Amendment and invoke the protection of the First Amendment, an amendment that generations of Americans have given their blood, sweat and tears to defend. We will not kneel. We will continue to be true.”</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd to prove his point, Lieu said: “I get to say things like Donald Trump is partly on Epstein files because he is all over the Epstein files.”</p>\n<p>\n\tOther speakers at the event included Writers Guild of America-West president Meredith Stiehm, in addition to members of SAG-AFTRA, Teamsters, IATSE and other unions.</p>\n</div>"

A source close to the production says that shooting is expected to start up again on Sept. 29, and will not have an impact on the film’s July 31, 2026, release date. No one else was injured in the incident on the Pinewood set in London, and Holland is recuperating “out of an abundance of caution,” says the source.\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\tLast month, Sony marked the start of production by <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/2025/film/news/spider-man-brand-new-day-footage-tom-holland-tank-1236486147/\">releasing a video of Holland</a> on set on the first day in Glasgow, in an elaborate stunt sequence that had Holland, as Spider-Man, landing on a tank careening through the city.\n</p>\n<p>\n\t“It’s funny, putting the suit on, it feels different this time, somehow,” Holland says in the video. “It’s also the first time we ever had fans on set day one, so it’s really exciting to share this with them. We’ve got some familiar faces on set. I’m just going to do my best, hopefully get it right, no pressure.”</p>\n<p>\n\tFranchise regulars Zendaya and Jacob Batalon are returning for Holland’s fourth Spidey film, along with newcomers Sadie Sink, Liza Colón-Zayas and Tramell Tillman. Mark Ruffalo is set to play Bruce Banner (aka the Hulk), alongside Jon Bernthal as Frank Castle (aka the Punisher) and Michael Mando, reprising his role as Mac Gargan (aka Scorpion) from 2017’s “Spider-Man: Homecoming.”</p>\n<p>\n\t“Brand New Day” is written by <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/2021/film/news/spider-man-no-way-home-writers-1235133693/\">regular Spidey scribes</a> Chris McKenna and Erik Sommers, with Amy Pascal and Kevin Feige producing.\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\tDeadline first reported the suspension of production.</p>\n</div>"

    "body": "<div><p>\n\t<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/jimmy-kimmel/\">Jimmy Kimmel</a> will have more to say on late-night TV.</p>\n<p>\n\tDisney and <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/abc/\">ABC</a> will bring the comedian back to its schedule starting Tuesday night, after a decision to take his show, “Jimmy Kimmel Live,” off the air for an indefinite period of time. “Last Wednesday, we <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/2025/tv/news/nexstar-jimmy-kimmel-abc-charlie-kirk-1236522584/\">made the decision to suspend production on the show</a> to avoid further inflaming a tense situation at an emotional moment for our country.  It is a decision we made because we felt some of the comments were ill-timed and thus insensitive,” the company said in a statement. “We have spent the last days having thoughtful conversations with Jimmy, and after those conversations, we reached the decision to return the show on Tuesday.”\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\t<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/2025/tv/news/nexstar-jimmy-kimmel-abc-charlie-kirk-1236522584/\">Disney’s decision to bench one of its signature personalities</a> came after two major station owners, Nexstar Media and Sinclair, said they would pre-empt his program following a Kimmel monologue last Monday during which he offered remarks tied to the death of conservative activist Charlie Kirk. Those announcements came after Federal Communications Commission chair Brendan Carr appeared to suggest to broadcasters they ought to work to curb Kimmel and force ABC to remove him from its schedule.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd yet, after Kimmel was taken off the air, Disney faced protest from the creative community. On Monday, 400 celebrities —<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/2025/tv/news/400-celebrities-aclu-protest-jimmy-kimmel-suspension-1236526119/\"> including people like Martin Short and Tom Hank</a>s, who have created memorable characters for Disney in the recent past — signed a letter from the American Civil Liberties Union decrying the blow the maneuver delivered to free speech in America. First Amendment advocates from both sides of the political aisle have decried the situation in recent days.\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\tThe decision to bring Kimmel back was approved by Bob Iger, Disney’s CEO, and Dana Walden, co-chair of Disney Entertainment, according to a person familiar with the matter. The executives acted based on what was best for the company, this person said, and not on external factors. Indeed, it remains unclear if all ABC affiliates will air Kimmel’s program. Spokespersons for Nexstar and Sinclair could not be reached for immediate comment.</p>\n<p>\n\tIt is not clear if Kimmel will offer an apology for his remarks, but whatever he and Disney executives agreed to have him do will be seen Tuesday night. In the past, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/2025/tv/news/jimmy-kimmel-abc-late-night-host-apologies-letterman-maher-1236524338/\">late-night hosts have had to tender apologies for remarks that offended</a>, with David Letterman, Bill Maher and Samantha Bee among those who had to express regret for jokes or one-liners that caused more outrage than laughter.</p>\n<p>\n\tThe comedian offended conservatives by discussing some of the theories about Kirk’s death, caused by an assassin who shot him in Utah. “We hit some new lows over the weekend with the MAGA gang trying to characterize this kid who killed Charlie Kirk as anything other than one of them,” Kimmel said. He also poked fun at President Trump’s response to a question from the press about how he was mourning Kirk’s death after Trump pivoted to a discussion of the construction of a new White House ballroom.</p>\n<p>\n\tDisney’s decision to take Kimmel off the air put a new spotlight on how uncertain traditional media companies have become in an era when the White House and the Federal Communications Commission pounce on individual reports with comments and legal pushback. President Trump has in recent months sued both ABC News and CBS News for comments made by ABC News anchor George Stephanopoulos and the editing of an interview with former U.S. Vice President Kamala Harris on “60 Minutes.” In both cases, the companies agreed to pay multi-million dollar settlements, even though the legal cases were deemed to be quite flimsy by experts.</p>\n<p>\n\tIn a different era, late-night hosts were more measured in their commentary. Johnny Carson famously kept his politics to himself, while poking fun at whoever happened to be in the White House. In recent years, however, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/2018/tv/news/late-night-tv-donald-trump-samantha-bee-crossroads-1202837365/\">hot talk and political humor have driven social-media chatter and viral pass-along — and ratings</a>. Meanwhile, the audiences for the programs have begun to dwindle, with an increasing number of would-be viewers opting to sift through clips of the various shows on social media the day after the original episodes aired. Stephen Colbert’s “Late Show” on CBS has been the most watched of TV’s late-night programs as the host followed a theme of commenting on the latest headlines. For a good part of Colbert’s tenure on TV, President Trump has been at the center of them.\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\tSuch dynamics may be poised to cease. Paramount is getting out of the late-night business, and <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/2025/tv/news/inside-cbs-breakup-stephen-colbert-late-night-audience-1236464740/\">has canceled Colbert’s “Late Show,” </a>which will end in May. While the company cited a downturn in advertising, there continue to be suspicions that Paramount Skydance’s new leader, David Ellison, wants to tamp down political sniping and is eager to cater to a more conservative base.</p>\n<p>\n\tKimmel’s return to wee-hours TV gives the comedian a little more time to enjoy his work. His current contract with ABC is expected to end in 2026, and people familiar with the host’s thinking say he’s been mulling stepping down from the role at some point in the near future. Whether that’s next year or after one or more new contract cycles remains to be seen.</p>\n</div>"

Excellence is beautiful, it’s important, but freedom is more important.”</p>\n<p>\n\tWillie “Prophet” Stiggers, BMAC CEO/co-founder/president, reflected on the non-profit’s growth over the past five years. “Tonight as we honor those who have used their platforms to drive real social change, let us recognize this truth – that BMAC is no longer just an organization. We are in fact the movement rooted in accountability and action, an unwavering belief that the future of music must be as just and as free and as powerful as the music itself.”</p>\n</div>"

    "body": "<div><p>\n\tNobel Peace Prize winner Malala Yousafzai and “Succession” actor <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/arian-moayed/\">Arian Moayed</a> have signed on as executive producers of the feature documentary “<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/champions-of-the-golden-valley/\">Champions of the Golden Valley</a>.”</p>\n<p>\n\tDirected by Ben Sturgulewski, the doc follows former Afghan Olympic hopeful Alishah Farhangm as he brings together athletes of all ages and abilities from neighboring and often divided villages in the ancient Afghanistan mountain town of Bamyan to form a competitive ski community. An Oscar-qualifying theatrical run for “Champions of the Golden Valley” will begin on Oct. 31 in Los Angeles.\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\t“Champions of the Golden Valley” is a moving and timely story about what joy and unity look like when everything else is falling apart,” Yousafzai said in a statement. “I’m proud to support this film and the young people whose courage and spirit it so beautifully captures.”\n</p>\n<p>\n\tMoayed added, “Champions of the Golden Valley” resonates because it’s a story about people who refuse to stop dreaming. “These beautiful and resilient Afghans show us the power of what sport, community, and shared purpose can do, no matter what the obstacles may be.”</p>\n<p>\n\tThe doc premiered at the 2024 Tribeca Festival and has screened at over 50 festivals and received over 30 grand prize, jury, and audience awards, including best documentary at both SCAD Savannah Film Festival and Berkshire International Film Festival.</p>\n<p>\n\t“Director Ben Sturgulewski captures an Afghanistan that few outsiders ever see in his exuberant debut feature film,” Tribeca Fest programmer Andrea Passafiume said. “A unique story that goes beyond skiing, ‘Champions of the Golden Valley’ is about resilience, finding joy amidst difficult circumstances, and what it means to be a champion.”\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\tYousafzai has supported several documentary projects. In 2023, Yousafzai boarded Oscar-shortlisted doc “Stranger at the Gate” as an executive producer. The film charted the surprising change of heart of a PTSD-suffering former U.S. Marine who set out to bomb a mosque but instead converted to Islam. In 2022, Yousafzai boarded “Joyland” as executive producer. The film tells the tale of a young Pakistani man from a patriarchal family who joins an erotic dance theater and falls for an ambitious transgender starlet.</p>\n<p>\n\tYousafzai began her activism by blogging about life in Pakistan under the Taliban and was shot in the head for speaking out. She received the Nobel Peace Prize in recognition of her work for education and equality. An Oxford University graduate and a self-professed TV fan, she struck a multi-year programming pact with Apple TV+ in 2021 through Extracurricular Productions, where she is president.</p>\n</div>"

    "body": "<div><p>\n\t<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/row-k/\">Row K</a> Entertainment, the newly launched theatrical distribution company, is filling out its core team. </p>\n<p>\n\tIt has appointed three senior executives — Mo Rhim will join as chief revenue officer, Ben Carlson has been named chief marketing officer, and Steve Garrett will serve as head of distribution and acquisitions.</p>\n<p>\n\tThis announcement comes shortly after Row K, which was backed by Media Capital Technologies, made two major acquisitions out of the 2025 Toronto International Film Festival, where it launched. These included signing deals for Gus Van Sant’s “Dead Man’s Wire” starring Bill Skarsgård, Dacre Montgomery, Cary Elwes, Myha’la, Colman Domingo, and Al Pacino, as well as Tom Dean and Mac Eldridge’s “Charlie Harper” starring Nick Robinson and Emilia Jones.\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\tRhim, Carlson, and Garrett will work alongside Row K president <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/megan-colligan/\">Megan Colligan</a>, a veteran executive who previously had leadership roles at Paramount and Imax.\n</p>\n<p>\n\t“With Megan at the helm and Mo, Steve, and Ben joining the team, we’ve assembled a seasoned leadership group capable of managing every aspect of distribution. This gives the company a strong foundation to scale strategically and rapidly, while setting a new standard for filmmakers and audiences,” said MCT principals and Row K co-chairman Christopher Woodrow and Raj Singh. “Building on the momentum of our acquisitions at TIFF and leveraging this team’s track record, Row K is positioned to redefine the landscape as a bold, commercially driven distributor.”</p>\n<p>\n\t“This team is composed of some of the most talented, multi-faceted executives in the business. Their combined expertise and breadth of knowledge give Row K the ability to move quickly, take risks, and innovate at a moment when the market is demanding it,” said Colligan. “We are building a modern studio for a modern audience, and this is exactly the right team to bring it to life.”\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\tRhim was the founder and CEO of The Advisory Collective, a strategic consultancy that helped corporations, brands, and creators in film, streaming, and interactive media develop next-generation business models, commercialization strategies and partnerships. Recently, she served as chief strategy officer at Imax, where she spearheaded initiatives to expand partnerships, content strategy, and interactive theatrical experiences across theatrical, out-of-home and in-home platforms. Previously, Rhim was the SVP of international digital marketing at Paramount Pictures, developing strategy across theatrical releases and regions. Rhim began her career at Google as the company’s first head of industry for media and entertainment, where she built strategic partnerships with Netflix and Warner Bros.</p>\n<p>\n\tCarlson is an expert in audience insights and brand strategy, most recently serving as EVP and general manager of media, sports, and entertainment at MarketCast. He previously founded Fizziology, a social media analytics and predictive audience insights firm acquired by MarketCast in 2017, and earlier led brand strategy and creative innovation at Bradley and Montgomery.</p>\n<p>\n\tGarrett most recently served as SVP, head of alternative and domestic distribution at Imax, where he managed the alternative content business for the global network alongside domestic studio releases. Prior to Imax, Garrett spent 15 years at Paramount Pictures, rising to SVP and general sales manager after serving as head of sales for Paramount Vantage.</p>\n</div>"
