In the caption, Holland wrote that he is “feeling better and on the mend” from his injury.</p>\n<p>\n\t“What a night! Another huge success,” Holland wrote. “The Brothers Trust means more to me than I could possibly say and I have to say a huge thank you to my Mum and her wonderful friends for putting on another incredible night. Raising money for fantastic causes and having fun doing it! I’m sorry I had to leave early but I’m feeling better and on the mend. A huge thanks to my Dad for taking over after I left.

Suited up as the titular web-slinger, Holland was shown performing a blockbuster stunt involving a tank.</p>\n<p>\n\t“It’s funny, putting the suit on, it feels different this time, somehow,” Holland says in the video. “It’s also the first time we ever had fans on set day one, so it’s really exciting to share this with them. We’ve got some familiar faces on set. I’m just going to do my best, hopefully get it right, no pressure.”</p>\n</div>"

    "body": "<div><p>\n\tJournalists and filmmakers and cinema itself are facing growing political threats and increasing difficulties, according to film industry reps at the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/zurich-summit/\">Zurich Summit</a> on Saturday.</p>\n<p>\n\tTaking part in a discussion on the political turmoil engulfing the entertainment industry at the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/zurich-film-festival/\">Zurich Film Festival</a> industry event were Kathleen Fournier of Charlotte Street Films, producer of the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/julian-assange/\">Julian Assange</a> doc “The Six Billion Dollar Man;” David Unger, CEO of Artist International Group; Nathanaël Karmitz, chairman of Paris-based MK2; and Stephen Follows, film data researcher and consultant for Guinness World Records.\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\tOffering a stark example of the darkening climate for filmmakers was Fournier’s experience in producing Eugene Jarecki’s “The Six Billion Dollar Man,” which screens at the Zurich Film Festival.\n</p>\n<p>\n\t“As a filmmaker, as a producer, there is substantial risk sometimes involved for me and my team personally,” Fournier said, explaining how she moved with her family to Berlin to work on the documentary, which tells “the definitive story of Wikileaks,” due to the potentially explosive footage they had obtained.</p>\n<p>\n\t“We didn’t feel comfortable editing in the U.K. or in the U.S. because there are laws there and ways to seize footage, and journalists aren’t protected in the way they are in Germany. So we moved the entire production and editing team to Berlin, and that was really inspiring and very interesting … until Gaza happened and we started to see that even Germany, with all of its civic mindedness, is fallible to ideology and to erosion. So it was very interesting to see journalists challenged there in real time and to react to that.”\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\tShe added: “I think we really do need a mechanism in place to protect journalists. And that’s what our film is about.”</p>\n<p>\n\tFournier also noted how the changing political climate and growth of streaming platforms have impacted the prospects of certain types of documentaries.</p>\n<p>\n\t“It used to be that if you won an Emmy, won the Sundance Grand Jury prize, won a Grierson Award, you would have no trouble getting your films made. And we won all of those with many of our films. I’m not complaining that doors have closed, but what I’m seeing is that as documentaries move to streaming platforms, many of the political and more nuanced and difficult or subjective documentaries did not make that leap.</p>\n<p>\n\t“The sort of documentaries you now find on streaming platforms tend to be historical – there’s the past, so it flattens the stakes in a way because those people are gone, that time is finished – or it’s true crime or it’s often very sort of personal stories. So it is interesting trying to make a film at this particular juncture as the media landscape is changing fundamentally, dramatically.”</p>\n<p>\n\tYet life has always been difficult, Fournier added. “Every epoch has its challenges, and I think we as a generation, my generation, inherited a lot of the fruits of other people’s labor in the civil rights movement, in terms of civil liberties. Now it’s up to us to stand up for those and really investigate what it means as some of those rights and liberties get challenged or taken away.”</p>\n<p>\n\tDespite winning this year’s Golden Eye Special Jury Prize at Cannes and a “phenomenal” screening in Zurich, “The Six Billion Dollar Man” has yet to land a U.S. distributor.</p>\n<p>\n\t“We’ve been dancing with lots of partners and talking. People love the film, but it’s a difficult film. … It talks about Trump, it talks about the deep state. It uses all the facts that come from various court cases. It’s an incredibly, deeply researched film.”</p>\n<p>\n\tOffering a sharp critique of the industry, Follows argued that the onus was on companies to exhibit greater courage, as was the case in the 1970s, which saw much braver, more diverse and interesting storytelling than what was produced in subsequent decades.</p>\n<p>\n\t“The film industry is fundamentally, as a business and as an ecosystem, risk averse and scared and cowardly. … It’s absolutely cowardly that they’re not releasing these films. You think about how ‘Bowling for Columbine’ got media releases and things like that. So this needs agitators. If we leave it and don’t actively do things, the industry acts in horrible ways. The reason Me Too had to happen is because when left to our own devices as an industry, we didn’t police, we didn’t sort out.”\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\tWhile stressing that politics and cinema have always been very linked, Karmitz said: “What is new is that we ask this question, and we ask this type of question because culture is under attack and cinema is under attack.”</p>\n<p>\n\tKarmitz said that while the press was talking less and less about films, far-right accounts on the social media platform X were systematically attacking “everything about movies and French movies.”</p>\n<p>\n\tThe far-right has become the major voice discussing cinema on X, he added. “Is this a problem? Yes, it is, because the question is, how do we organize to fight back?”</p>\n<p>\n\tKarmitz noted that many of MK2’s cinema events and discussions attract contentious reactions from far-right critics.</p>\n<p>\n\tLooking at the broader situation in France, he also stressed the recent legal challenge faced by the CNC national film center in Parliament and the ongoing right-wing assault on national television.</p>\n<p>\n\tUnger, for his part, expressed optimism that the climate would eventually improve. He recalled how earlier films by the likes of Charlie Chaplin and Stanley Kramer “were unbelievably controversial” in their day. Kramer’s 1967 classic “Guess Who’s Coming to Dinner,” for example, no longer causes the great ruckus it once did.</p>\n<p>\n\tHe also underscored the importance of such a discussion at the Zurich Summit. “I see that this register’s here. And I think for us to have this dialogue here is important, because it’s forcing all of us in this room to kind of examine where the business is and how we can help shape it.”</p>\n</div>"

    "body": "<div><p>\n\tThere aren’t very many shows where you can reasonably claim that if it ended after the first number, you’d have gone home happy. And maybe even in the case of <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/paul-mccartney/\">Paul McCartney</a>‘s concert Friday night at the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/santa-barbara-bowl/\">Santa Barbara Bowl</a>, it would count as  hyperbolic. An audience that paid $300-600 for tickets to see him in an uncharacteristically smallish venue would have expected — and got — a little more for their money than that. Even so, let’s just go with that slightly exaggerated feeling and emphasize what a major kick it was to see McCartney open his 2025 tour by singing the John Lennon-associated Beatles song “Help!” in full in public for the first time in his career. \n\t</p>\n<p>\n\tIt was a <em>you had to be there</em> moment, but a lot more people <em>will</em> be there in the weeks to come, and presuming this stays as the opener for all the shows to come, the joy will be spread around to considerably more than just the roughly 4,900 people who got to see it in Friday’s underplay gig. The tour continues Monday night on a different end of southern California, at Palm Springs’ Acrisure Arena, where it will have what was initially set to be (and may still count as) its official opening, and will definitely count as the first truly representative show of the tour, with no staging or curfew restrictions. \n</p>\n<p>\n\tWe won’t be sure until Palm Springs, in other words, whether McCartney’s regular setlists might be a little longer than the hour and 55 minutes that he played in Santa Barbara, which due to its mid-residential nature has a hard out of 10 p.m. But who cares about curfew issues, anyway? Didn’t I just say it could have ended at 8:05 and it’d have been fine?\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\tThe asterisk on his performance of “Help!” is that, as Macca-holics will well remember, McCartney <em>did</em> have it in his nighty setlist back in 1990 — but only a 50-seconds-or-so snippet of it as part of a Lennon tribute medley late in the show. Kicking off his shows with the number now is a more radical and expansive move. It follows in a recent tradition, actually, of beginning concerts with a Lennon-associated number, something he did a decade ago with “A Hard Day’s Night.” But “Help!” is even more identified as a John song … some of us would even consider it <em>the</em> best John song, if forced to do something so foolish as single out such a thing. And as tributes to his fallen comrade go, this is a hundred times more effective at this point than reviving “Here Today” again would be. No speeches or preambles necessary — it’s an inherently sentimental choice that’s also just viscerally exciting, regardless of whether you’re giving its rarity or heritage a second thought.</p>\n<p>\n\tThe second number of the show was, if not as much of a surprise, equally a corker… and a thematically appropriate choice for the followup choice in the set. Right after singing “I’m feeling down,” he kicked into “Coming Up”… because let’s face it, in Paul McCartney’s oft-rosy world, no one is going to suffer from depression, even exhilarating depression, for more than one song at a time. And “Coming Up” is underrated, if anything, as one of McCartney’s great explosions of joy (at least in the live single version that became a No. 1 hit in 1980). On a big screen behind the stage, McCartney’s crew put up animated footage of an apocalyptic cityscape giving way to massive flower blooms, as a three-man brass section, the Hot City Horns, came out for the first of many appearances to help McCartney and his funk-efficient band in set the world aright again. (It didn’t hurt that the ensemble worked a few bars of Henry Mancini’s “Peter Gunn Theme” into the song as a smoking interpolation,) This might be the best one-two punch to open a show that McCartney has ever had on one of his tours.</p>\n<p>\n\tFrom there, the concert followed along more expected lines in its sequence and content, as largely a condensed version of the epic show that passed through SoCal in 2022, when he was playing SoFi Stadium. If you were hoping that he would be using the occasion of an upcoming Wings book, documentary and best-of collection to start pulling out some ’70s obscurities, no, this tour is not offering that kind of a refresh, at least as of opening night. At 83, McCartney is definitely staying focused on what he now considers to be his core concert repertoire, But it’s a solidification, not a calcification. If you’ve seen him in recent years, you have a very good idea of what’s coming in the setlist, following that startling opening. \n\t</p>\n<p>\n\tBut what you don’t see or remember coming, maybe, is how good it feels to hear <em>this band</em> playing <em>those songs</em>, in a way that makes you feel like you’re setting the needle down on “Let Me Roll It” or “Jet” for the first or second time. As has been noted, his ensemble — guitarist Rusty Anderson, guitarist-bassist Brian Ray, drummer Abe Laboriel Jr. and keyboardist Paul “Wix” Wickens — has been with him for about a thousand years longer than the Beatles were ever together, give or take. And they still seem to be having as much fun as McCartney is, which is a high bar. Collectively with their front-legend, they are pulling off a neat hat trick: playing the classics very close to the way they were recorded — there’s hardly anything in the set you could even call a re-arrangement — but as fresh takes that are living and breathing on their own with little flourishes and ad libs that reinforce we are hearing the songs in real time. It’s no wonder he wants to stay on the road: Against the odds, everything comes together to make it feel like there is still a lot of tread on the tires of everything that is being performed.</p>\n<p>\n\tThere can also be some element of surprise in what most galvanizes a crowd. The audience in Santa Barbara, not surprisingly, looked to be a little older on average than even the median age for a McCartney show “in town,” as it were — and so there was just a surprising amount of <em>sitting</em>, up in the seated areas of the house, if obviously not in the GA floor area. But looking through the setlist, would you guess the number that finally got everyone in the Bowl on their feet, en masse, no exceptions? You would probably not, because that song was… “Ob-La-Di, Ob-La-Da.” Nothing against it, bra, but we would not have pegged it as <em>the</em> completely irresistible, take-no-prisoners barnburner of the night. (At future tour stops, your crowd’s mileage may vary.)</p>\n<p>\n\tThe Santa Barbara show was tacked on to the beginning of the tour with the proviso that it would not be the full, <em>full </em>production than fans would see beginning Monday in Palm Springs. But you could have fooled the Santa Barbarians: Far from a bare-bones presentation, Friday’s show certainly looked as if it could be the whole setup, with two vertical screens on either side of the stage for musician closeups and a rear screen for pre-recorded video and the occasional crowd shot. The green lasers we’ve been seeing since the “Wings Over the World” tour of ’75-76, which by now have to count as a nostalgic touch? Still present and accounted for. During “Live and Let Die,” smoke plumes went up, violently, on the appropriate beats — but the only flames were on the screen, so it’s possible that actual pyro is the one thing fans missed out on that will turn up from Palm Springs forward. We’ll quickly find out.\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\t(An additional side note about the Santa Barbara show, set at one of the world’s loveliest amphitheater settings: As much turmoil as there was around untold thousands of people trying and failing to get tickets through the online lottery earlier in the week… there <em>were</em> tickets on sale at the Bowl box office, after all, in the run-up to showtime, for those willing to brave their way first to SB and then navigate the long and rather confusing box office lines. Read it and weep.)</p>\n<p>\n\tThe real beginning of the show, pre-“Help!,” was a computer-graphics video that climaxed with the sight of McCartney’s Hofner bass exploding into tiny shards. <em>Noooo, he just got it back</em>, the crowd cried (not really, but there <em>is</em> a <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/2025/film/global/paul-mccartney-stolen-guitar-documentary-superman-bbc-1236506795/\">forthcoming documentary movie about that</a>). Not to worry, this very intact artifact was his instrument of choice for the beginning of the show, though he naturally switched to electric and acoustic guitars, piano and (for “Dance Tonight”) mandolin over the course of the next two hours. (No drums; some vintage footage of him on a kit during the “Get Back” sessions had to suffice there.) </p>\n<p>\n\tHe played only a little bit of lead guitar, but the fact that this is a band with three lead guitarists of course comes into play during the climactic “The End” when he, Ray and Anderson take turns playing elaborate variations on the solo bits that he, Lennon and Harrison played on the same stretch of “Abbey Road.” This is a reliable conceit of theirs, thrilling in the final moments, that still gives “three-ways” a good name.</p>\n<p>\n\tAt the outset, McCartney promised “some old songs, some new songs and some in-betweeners.” The “new songs” part was a bit of a misnomer; no, he was not about to offer a sneak preview of the album he’s apparently been working on in spurts with producer Andrew Watt since 2021, and the freshest solo song in the set was 207’s “Dance Tonight.” But technically, we would count as new the one number that post-dates his previous stop in these parts three years ago, the “final” Beatles song, “Now and Then.” The other Beatles were only spliced into this number on the big screen, not on audiotape — although, for the encore of “I’ve Got a Feeling,” he continues to bring in both audio and video of Lennon’s duet part. (Those of us who have  longed to hear McCartney take over the entire tune and be the one to sing “everybody had a wet dream” still just have to wait.)\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\tSpeaking of “I’ve Got a Feeling,” there is a moment in that great, great song that provides a sort of a test for McCartney: How long into his advanced years will he be able to sing that uppity bridge — <em>“All that I been lookin’ for was somebody who looked like you!”</em> — and still sound at least a little like Little Richard?</p>\n<p>\n\tThe answer, I’m happy to report, is that at 83, he has not rounded that bend. Fans, of course, will be looking for a report on the state of McCartney’s voice, just as they are before or after buying tickets for any of the rockers who are now out there doing it in their 80s, whether it’s the ones who were not belters per se but still are among the great idiosyncratic voices, like Paul Simon and Mick Jagger, or those whom we might worry about more, who <em>are</em> all-time howlers, like Roger Daltrey (whose <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/2025/music/news/the-who-hollywood-bowl-concert-review-farewell-tour-1236523723/\">farewell tour with the Who</a> is also passing through SoCal this week). McCartney, of course, belongs in that latter camp — he’s got arguably the greatest rock ‘n’ roll voice of all time, and just for the sake of argument, let’s go ahead and say that’s inarguable.</p>\n<p>\n\tWould you believe me if I tell you he’s still got it? Granted, he had a few shaky moments near the beginning of the show, including in “Help!”; if I had just one wish for the show, it would’ve been that he would have come back around at the end and reprised it as a final encore, when he was completely warmed up and then some. Because McCartney completely came into his power over the course of the first few numbers, and unless you are the kind of nitpicker who is unable to make any allowance for the effects of age, there were few nits to pick with his performance Friday night. The suppleness of a tender reverie like “My Valentine” may not be 100% what it was to when he first recorded it, but it’s close enough for balladic rock ‘n’ roll. Certainly by the time he got to a solo acoustic “Blackbird,” he was in pitch-perfect form. And when it comes to the actual rockers, he is still going for it and seemingly holding almost nothing back, going screamo on us in “Helter Skelter” or engaging in fun little bits of falsetto melisma, not seeming or sounding at all like a guy who is worried he needs to be conservative with his voice.</p>\n<p>\n\tAll to say: his marvelous singing continues to be one of the wonders of the world, even without an 83-is-the-new-38 handicap, but especially taking that into account. (The act of dragging one’s sorry ass up the hundreds of steps required to reach the scenic heights of the Santa Barbara Bowl does give one time to consider decrepitude, or someone else’s lack of it.) Simply put: If you are one of the folks we occasionally encounter on the internet saying they won’t consider coming because they prefer to remember McCartney as he was (versus more defensible reasons, like distance or economics), then you, sir, may be the fool on the hill.\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\tHere’s one trivial question that may lead to a less trivial one: Does this count as a new tour, or is it the continuation of an ongoing one? It’s kind of both: The attendant publicity and McCartney himself have described it as a tour kickoff, yet the advertising and poster art still have it as the “Got Back” tour, which officially extends back to 2022. But he has adopted an off-again, on-again touring model that kind of renders this a moot point. He’s rather like Bob Dylan, in that way, who has been on his so-called “never ending tour” for decades now, putting batches of fresh dates on sale without making clear demarcations  between which “era” the concerts belong to. For both these artists, it’s not about the act of plugging, it’s about the joy of playing. And about hitting markets they have rarely or even never played before, as they spread their immortality around. </p>\n<p>\n\tTheir approaches couldn’t be more different, when it comes to on-stage personas: Dylan is acting his age, while McCartney is defying his. Either mindset is valid and has its own separate rewards for the audience and themselves. But what a life-giving kick it is to see Sir Paul with the preternatural ability to do this raucous of a show as effectively, as merrily and even ras apturously as he has for decades. From every indication, he will be doing this until the wheels come off and, until they do, riding atop this very sturdy vehicle, saying: Let me roll it to you.</p>\n<p>\n\t<strong>Setlist for Paul McCartney at the Santa Barbara Bowl, Sept. 26, 2025:</strong></p>\n<p>\n\tHelp!<br />Coming Up<br />Got to Get You Into My Life<br />Let Me Roll It/Foxy Lady<br />Getting Better<br />Let ‘Em In<br />My Valentine<br />Nineteen Hundred and Eighty-Five<br />I’ve Just Seen a Face<br />Love Me Do<br />Dance Tonight<br />Blackbird<br />Now and Then<br />Lady Madonna<br />Jet<br />Ob-La-Di, Ob-La-Da<br />Get Back<br />Let It Be<br />Live and Let Die<br />Hey Jude</p>\n<p>\n\tEncore:<br />I’ve Got a Feeling<br />Sgt.

Wintour, who served as Vogue’s lead fashion editor from 1988 to 2025, was the supposed inspiration for Streep’s mercilessly powerful, yet impeccably elegant Priestly, who runs the fictional fashion magazine Runway in the film. \n\t</p>\n<p>\n\tBoth donning their iconic dark sunglasses at the indoor event, the pair shared a hug and a laugh backstage.

Kennith Bragah joins the cast as Priestly’s husband alongside fellow franchise newcomers Lucy Liu, Justin Theroux, B.J. Novak and Pauline Chalamet.

Tucci sported a deconstructed single-breasted Galles wool suit with a black cotton shirt and a leopard print chiffon foulard, while Ashley wore a tulle corset with satin cups and satin boning detail above a crystal mesh skirt from the FW24-25 runway, a collection of satin corset-style culottes with the DG logo and patent leather pumps. She carried a black leather MySicily handbag. All three put on the serious demeanors of their fashion-savvy characters for the show’s duration.</p>\n</div>"

That’s when producer <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/devon-franklin/\">DeVon Franklin</a> decided to ask Serayah to audition for the role of Ruth. He was already familiar with her acting and singing talents from producing the BET+ series “Kingdom Business,” a drama in which she starred, set in the gospel music industry. \n\t</p>\n<p>\n\t“The moment she auditioned, it was like ‘There’s Ruth,'” Franklin told <em>Variety</em>. “But we didn’t know who Boaz was going to be.” \n</p>\n<p>\n\tThe filmmakers watched hundreds of actors’ auditions and settled on a handful of finalists, he recalled. “Then, at the 11th hour, Tyler Lepley sent in his self-tape. And we were like, ‘There’s Boaz,'” Franklin said. “We did a chemistry read [with Serayah], and it was just magic.”</p>\n<p>\n\tAs fate would have it, the actors had recently wrapped making a movie together, the upcoming horror film “Goons,” before reuniting for these roles. “It was a beautiful thing for them to have this type of chemistry, to have already worked together and now get the chance to bring this classic love story to the big screen,” Franklin said, acknowledging the divine alignment at play. “It was just amazing how it came together.”</p>\n<div>\n<figure>\n<p><img srcset=\"https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Screenshot-2025-09-24-at-10.15.50 https://variety.com/2025/film/news/ruth-boaz-serayah-tyler-lepley-producer-devon-franklin-1236528178/AM.png 1018w, https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Screenshot-2025-09-24-at-10.15.50 https://variety.com/2025/film/news/ruth-boaz-serayah-tyler-lepley-producer-devon-franklin-1236528178/AM.png?resize=150,76 150w, https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Screenshot-2025-09-24-at-10.15.50 https://variety.com/2025/film/news/ruth-boaz-serayah-tyler-lepley-producer-devon-franklin-1236528178/AM.png?resize=300,151 300w\" src=\"https://variety.com/wp-content/themes/pmc-variety-2020/assets/public/lazyload-fallback.gif\" alt=\"\" />\n\t</p>\n<figcaption>\n\t\t\t\t\t<span>Serayah and Tyler Lepley in “Ruth & Boaz.”</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tNetflix\n\t</figcaption>\n</figure>\n</div>\n<p>\n\t“Ruth & Boaz,” now streaming on Netflix, puts a modern spin on the bible story and centers on rising hip-hop artist Ruth Moably (Serayah), who gives up her promising music career and leaves Atlanta after a heated dispute with her manager results in the death of her boyfriend. In hopes of a fresh start, Ruth moves to a rural city in Tennessee, where she cares for her late boyfriend’s widowed mother, Naomi (Phylicia Rashad). Ruth takes on a new job working in a local vineyard, where she meets Boaz (Lepley), a winemaker, and begins to fall in love, rediscovering her passion for music in the process.\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\t​Serayah, who is also a music artist, was surprised by some of the parallels she shared with Ruth. She said that Ruth finding her voice, speaking up and stepping out on faith are similar to the experiences she’s had to navigate in the music industry.</p>\n<p>\n\t​“Falling in love is also a parallel in my real life,” Serayah said. “You never know where things are going to lead you. When you’re open enough to receive and let your guard down, you realize you have to stop fighting yourself. I have to stop fighting divinity. I have to give in. There’s something beautiful on the other side of that.”</p>\n<p>\n\t​Set against the backdrop of Atlanta’s music scene, “Ruth & Boaz” included cameo appearances from industry powerhouses Jermaine Dupri, Yung Joc and Kenneth “Babyface” Edmonds. In fact, the R&B maestro Babyface wrote, recorded and produced a song for the film, titled “Faithful,” which Serayah performs onscreen. </p>\n<p>\n\tThe collaboration was Serayah’s first time working with the 13-time Grammy winner, and she admitted she was a little terrified to work with the high-profile artist. “I didn’t want to fan girl too much and make him uncomfortable, but I’m like, ‘You wrote this?’ It’s a beautiful record,” Serayah said, with a laugh. “It was amazing,” Serayah said about working with the 13-time Grammy winner for the first time. “His voice is angelic. It sounds just like the records. He’s just so poised, grounded, easy to talk to and create with.”</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd, for the record, she’d love to collaborate again. “That would be a dream come true,” Serayah said at the suggestion that they make another track.</p>\n<div>\n<figure>\n<p><img srcset=\"https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Screenshot-2025-09-24-at-10.14.47 https://variety.com/2025/film/news/ruth-boaz-serayah-tyler-lepley-producer-devon-franklin-1236528178/AM.png 943w, https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Screenshot-2025-09-24-at-10.14.47 https://variety.com/2025/film/news/ruth-boaz-serayah-tyler-lepley-producer-devon-franklin-1236528178/AM.png?resize=150,100 150w, https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Screenshot-2025-09-24-at-10.14.47 https://variety.com/2025/film/news/ruth-boaz-serayah-tyler-lepley-producer-devon-franklin-1236528178/AM.png?resize=300,199 300w, https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Screenshot-2025-09-24-at-10.14.47 https://variety.com/2025/film/news/ruth-boaz-serayah-tyler-lepley-producer-devon-franklin-1236528178/AM.png?resize=910,607 910w, https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Screenshot-2025-09-24-at-10.14.47 https://variety.com/2025/film/news/ruth-boaz-serayah-tyler-lepley-producer-devon-franklin-1236528178/AM.png?resize=681,454 681w, https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Screenshot-2025-09-24-at-10.14.47 https://variety.com/2025/film/news/ruth-boaz-serayah-tyler-lepley-producer-devon-franklin-1236528178/AM.png?resize=450,300 450w, https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Screenshot-2025-09-24-at-10.14.47 https://variety.com/2025/film/news/ruth-boaz-serayah-tyler-lepley-producer-devon-franklin-1236528178/AM.png?resize=250,167 250w\" src=\"https://variety.com/wp-content/themes/pmc-variety-2020/assets/public/lazyload-fallback.gif\" alt=\"\" />\n\t</p>\n<figcaption>\n\t\t\t\t\t<span>Kenny “Babyface” Edmonds in “Ruth & Boaz.”</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tNetflix\n\t</figcaption>\n</figure>\n</div>\n<p>\n\tUnlike Serayah, who said she was familiar with the bible story before starring in the film, Lepley was introduced to <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/ruth-and-boaz/\">Ruth and Boaz</a> once he signed on to the project. While he might not have been as well-versed on the ins and outs of their story, the actor said he isn’t a stranger to having his faith tested. Just like Boaz, he has also faced challenges where relying on his faith was his only option.</p>\n<p>\n\t​“For the most part, my faith hasn’t wavered,” Lepley explained. “But we’re human. You’re going to go up. You’re going to go down. I feel like I have it figured out, then I don’t. All we have is God at the end of the day.”\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\tDirected by Alanna Brown, ​“Ruth & Boaz” marks the first film that <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/tyler-perry/\">Tyler Perry</a> and Franklin have produced <a href=\"https://variety.com/2024/film/news/tyler-perry-devon-franklin-faith-films-netflix-1235992932/\" target=\"_blank\">under their first-look partnership </a>with Netflix to bring more faith-based stories to the platform. Franklin, who is also a minister, was inspired to tell this particular Bible story after preaching a sermon series on singleness and relationships.</p>\n<p>\n\t​“As I was studying, it helped me understand what it means to be single and committed to service and a purpose greater than yourself,” Franklin said. </p>\n<p>\n\tHe also recognized that Ruth and Boaz’s tale had all the elements of a great movie. “This has romance. There’s some danger. There are great characters,” he explained. “I did some research, and I don’t think there’s ever been a modern version of the story of Ruth and Boaz. It felt like everything was aligning and that this was the right story to tell at the right time.”</p>\n<p>\n\tWhile grief, faith and love are embedded throughout the film, the last of those themes is what Franklin hopes inspires viewers the most. </p>\n<p>\n\t“Love is the most powerful force in the universe,” he said. “Love always wins. Stay open to love. When we’re open, love can go out and come in. If we have love, we have everything that we need.”</p>\n<div>\n<figure>\n<p><img srcset=\"https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Screenshot-2025-09-24-at-11.06.57 https://variety.com/2025/film/news/ruth-boaz-serayah-tyler-lepley-producer-devon-franklin-1236528178/AM.png 992w, https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Screenshot-2025-09-24-at-11.06.57 https://variety.com/2025/film/news/ruth-boaz-serayah-tyler-lepley-producer-devon-franklin-1236528178/AM.png?resize=150,102 150w, https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Screenshot-2025-09-24-at-11.06.57 https://variety.com/2025/film/news/ruth-boaz-serayah-tyler-lepley-producer-devon-franklin-1236528178/AM.png?resize=300,204 300w\" src=\"https://variety.com/wp-content/themes/pmc-variety-2020/assets/public/lazyload-fallback.gif\" alt=\"\" />\n\t</p>\n<figcaption>\n\t\t\t\t\t<span>Serayah in “Ruth & Boaz.”</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tNetflix\n\t</figcaption>\n</figure>\n</div>\n</div>"

    "body": "<div><p>\n\tFamily was the focus at tonight’s San Sebastián Film Festival awards ceremony, as a jury led by Spanish director J.A. Bayona bypassed harder-edged fare to reward a number of heart-led films centered on parent-child relationships. Bayona, the Barcelona native whose credits include “The Orphanage” and “Society of the Snow,” also kept things close to home, as half the jury’s prizes went to Spanish productions.</p>\n<p>\n\tForemost among those was “Sundays,” the third feature by Spanish writer-director Alauda Ruiz de Azúa, which took the Golden Shell for Best Film — marking the third consecutive year, following Jaione Camborda’s “The Rye Horn” and Albert Serra’s documentary “Afternoons of Solitude,” that the Spanish festival’s top prize has gone to a homegrown title. Popular with local audiences, “Sundays” follows a 17-year-old girl at a profound personal crossroads, torn between her parents’ wishes for her to attend university and her own desire to become a nun.\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\tBelgian auteur Joachim Lafosse was a two-time winner, landing both Best Director and — together with his co-writers Chloé Duponchelle and Paul Ismaël — Best Screenplay for “Six Days in Spring,” a delicate, sweetly melancholic study of a single mother taking her twin sons on vacation in the wake of splitting from their father, borrowing her former in-laws’ holiday home without permission. It’s a gentle change of pace for Lafosse, best known for more emotionally harrowing domestic dramas, as he acknowledged in his acceptance speech. “I tried for the first time to direct a <em>souvenir d’enfance</em>, and it was a real pleasure for me,” he said, before paying tribute to his leading lady Eye Haïdara: “Without her, we don’t have a movie.”\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\tHaïdara had to be content with her director’s praise, as the jury’s gender-neutral award for Best Leading Performance was shared between two other performers: Spanish TV veteran José Ramón Soroiz, as a 76-year-old gay man retreating into the closet after reuniting with his estranged daughter in Jose Mari Goenaga and Aitor Arregi’s local charmer “Maspalomas”; and Chinese big-screen newcomer Zhao Xiaohong for her affecting turn in Qin Xiaoyu’s “Her Heart Beats In Its Cage,” playing an ex-con forging a new relationship with her son after a decade behind bars for murdering her husband.</p>\n<p>\n\tA supporting performance prize went to Argentine actor Camila Plaate for her wrenching performance in the title role of “Belén,” director-star Dolores Fonzi’s rousing legal drama about the real-life case of a woman imprisoned for murder after suffering a miscarriage — and the national reproductive-rights campaign that her story inspired across Argentina. Recently tapped as Argentina’s submission for the Best International Feature Oscar, Fonzi’s film was one of the festival’s biggest crowdpleasers, and looks set to be a widespread audience favorite following its world premiere in San Sebastián.</p>\n<p>\n\tA special jury prize was presented to Spanish filmmaker José Luis Guerin for his humanistic community portrait “Good Valley Stories,” while another Spanish title, Alberto Rodriguez’s brother-sister drama “Los Tigres,” took Best Cinematography for DP Pau Esteve. </p>\n<p>\n\tAs is often the case at San Sebastián, Bayona’s jury — which also included directors Gia Coppola and Laura Carreira, actors Mark Strong, Zhou Dongyu and Lali Esposito, and producer Anne-Dominique Toussaint — opted not to reward a number of the bigger-name titles in competition, with Claire Denis’s “The Fence,” Alice Winocour’s Angelina Jolie vehicle “Couture” and Edward Berger’s Colin Farrell-starring romp “Ballad of a Small Player” among those leaving the festival empty-handed.</p>\n<p>\n\tIn two of the festival’s other competitive sections, prizewinners from previous major festivals this year added to their hardware. Seven months after winning a Silver Bear at the Berlinale for her enigmatic adult fairytale “The Ice Tower,” French director Lucile Hadžihalilović won the top prize in the festival’s arthouse-oriented Zabaltegi-Tabakalera competition with the same film. Colombian director Simon Mesa Soto won an Un Certain Regard award at Cannes for his dark literary comedy “A Poet,” and followed that up by taking top honors in San Sebastián’s Latin Horizons program. \n\t</p>\n<p>\n\tIn the festival’s New Directors competition, however, Marco Muller’s jury handed the award to a San Sebastián world premiere: Danish director Emilie Thalund’s “Weightless,” a warm, compassionate portrait of a 15-year-old girl coming out of her shell at a summer weight-loss camp.</p>\n<p>\n\tThe festival’s Audience Award, meanwhile, went to Tunisian director Kaouther Ben Hania’s “The Voice of Hind Rajab,” an emotionally pummelling docudrama utilizing real-life audio of a young Palestinian girl killed in one of last year’s Israeli attacks on the Gaza Strip. The win was hardly a surprise: Ben Hania’s film, a Grand Jury Prize winner at Venice earlier this month, has left audiences in floods of tears, and at a festival marked throughout by pro-Palestine protests at the red carpet — and where everyone from Donostia Award honoree Jennifer Lawrence to a number of tonight’s winners have felt compelled to make a vocal anti-genocide statement at the festival — the recognition felt fitting.</p>\n<p>\n\tFull list of award winners below:</p>\n<p>\n\t<strong>OFFICIAL SELECTION AWARDS</strong></p>\n<p>\n\t<strong>Golden Shell for Best Film: </strong>“Sundays,” Alauda Ruiz de Azúa</p>\n<p>\n\t<strong>Special Jury Prize: </strong>“Good Valley Stories,” José Luis Guerin</p>\n<p>\n\t<strong>Silver Shell for Best Director: </strong>“Six Days in Spring,” Joachim Lafosse</p>\n<p>\n\t<strong>Silver Shell for Best Leading Performance: </strong><em>(ex aequo)</em> “Her Heart Beats in Its Cage,” Zhao Xiaohong; “Maspalomas,” Jose Ramon Soroiz</p>\n<p>\n\t<strong>Silver Shell for Best Supporting Performance: </strong>“Belén,” Camila Plaate</p>\n<p>\n\t<strong>Jury Prize for Best Cinematography: </strong>“Los Tigres,” Pau Esteve</p>\n<p>\n\t<strong>Jury Prize for Best Screenplay: </strong>“Six Days in Spring,” Joachim Lafosse, Chloé Duponchelle, Paul Ismaël</p>\n<p>\n\t<strong>OTHER OFFICIAL AWARDS</strong></p>\n<p>\n\t<strong>New Directors Award: </strong>“Weightless,” Emilie Thalund<br /><strong>Special Mention: </strong>“Aro Berria,” Irati Gorostidi Agirretxe</p>\n<p>\n\t<strong>Horizontes Latinos Award:</strong> “A Poet,” Simón Mesa Soto<br /><strong>Special Mention: </strong>“The Ivy,” Ana Cristina Barragán; “A Loose End,” Daniel Hendler</p>\n<p>\n\t<strong>Zabaltegi-Tabakalera Award:</strong> “The Ice Tower,” Lucile Hadžihalilović<br /><strong>Special Mention:</strong> “Two Times João Liberada,” Paula Tomás Marques; “Blue Heron,” Sophy Romvari</p>\n<p>\n\t<strong>Audience Award for Best Film: </strong>“The Voice of Hind Rajab,” Kaouther Ben Hania</p>\n<p>\n\t<strong>Audience Award for Best European Film: </strong>“Little Amélie,” Maïlys Valladeania</p>\n<p>\n\t<strong>Irizar Basque Film Award: </strong>“Sundays,” Alauda Ruiz de Azúa\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\t<strong>Culinary Zinema Award: </strong>“Mam,” Nan Feix</p>\n<p>\n\t<strong>RTVE Another Look Award: </strong>“The Currents,” Milagros Mumenthaler<br /><strong>Special Mention: </strong>“Belén,” Dolores Fonzi</p>\n<p>\n\t<strong>Spanish Cooperation Award: </strong>“Good Valley Stories,” José Luis Guerin</p>\n<p>\n\t<strong>PREVIOUSLY ANNOUNCED AWARDS</strong></p>\n<p>\n\t<strong>Nest the Mediapro Studio Award:</strong> “How to Listen to Fountains,” Eva Sajanová<br /><strong>Special Mention: </strong>“The Old Bull Knows, or Once Knew,” Milan Kumar</p>\n<p>\n\t<strong>Movistar Plus+ Award for Best Short Film</strong>: “The Loneliness of Lizards,” Inês Nunes</p>\n<p>\n\t<strong>Tabakalera Short Film Award: </strong>“Life is Like That and Not Otherwise,” Lenia Friedrich</p>\n<p>\n\t<strong>Euskadi Basque Country 2030 Agenda Award: </strong>“The Voice of Hind Rajab,” Kaouther Ben Hania</p>\n<p>\n\t<strong>Zinemaldia Startup Challenge Best Spanish Project: </strong>Quickets, Felipe Ortiz</p>\n<p>\n\t<strong>Zinemaldia Startup Challenge Best European Project:</strong> Novel Fire Masks Engineered With 3D Technology, Raoul Peltier</p>\n<p>\n\t<strong>Zinemaldia Startup Challenge Special Mention for Entrepreneurship:</strong> Quickets, Felipe Ortiz</p>\n<p>\n\t<strong>WIP Latam Industry Award:</strong> “Flies,” Fernando Eimbcke</p>\n<p>\n\t<strong>Egeda Platino Industria Award For The Best WIP Latam:</strong> “We Were No Longer Five,” Esteban Hoyos Garcia, Juan Miguel Gelacio Ramirez</p>\n<p>\n\t<strong>WIP Europa Industry Award:</strong> “February, Seven Days,” Tatjana Moutchnik</p>\n<p>\n\t<strong>WIP Europa Award:</strong> “February, Seven Days,” Tatjana Moutchnik</p>\n<p>\n\t<strong>XIII Europe-Latin America Co-production Forum Best Project Award: </strong>“Do Not Let Me Die Alone,” Francisco Rodriguez Teare</p>\n<p>\n\t<strong>DALE!
