    "body": "<div><p>\n\tWhen a zombie plague is unwittingly unleashed on a small farming town, murder and mayhem ensue in Finnish filmmaker <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/pekka-ollula/\">Pekka Ollula</a>’s directorial debut “Pigtown,” which won the top prize among Nordic projects this week at <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/finnish-film-affair/\">Finnish Film Affair</a>, the industry event running parallel to the Helsinki Intl. Film Festival – Love & Anarchy.</p>\n<p>\n\tBilled by the director as a “rural romantic zombie comedy,” “Pigtown” follows Iida, a long-time animal rights activist, who wants to turn over a new leaf and stop breaking into farms. Her radical friend Anja, however, goes too far, poisoning pig feed with a strange black liquid that gradually turns the pigs into bloodthirsty zombies. When an unlucky farmhand gets bitten, the disease spreads to humans.\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\tMeanwhile, Sami, a city boy ashamed of his roots, arrives for a relaxing weekend on his family farm. When he meets Iida at the village festival, sparks fly — until the villagers start turning into zombies one by one and the village bingo game erupts into a bloodbath. What follows is a “rural genre mash up like no other,” according to Ollula, and “an unforgettable cult experience about farming, food and survival.”\n</p>\n<p>\n\tSpeaking to <em>Variety</em> in Helsinki, where he heralded his Finnish Film Affair triumph as “a win for all genre filmmakers,” the director described the “recipe” for “Pigtown” as “extremely simple.” </p>\n<p>\n\t“You take one part of ‘Shaun of the Dead’ for the humor; you take one part of ‘Aliens’ for the action; you take one part of George Miller’s ‘Babe’ for the heart; and then you add a generous dose of Peter Jackson’s ‘Bad Taste’ and ‘Braindead’ for the extra kick,” he said. “Mix it together with the Finnish countryside and serve it in cinemas worldwide with a good wine. That’s the recipe for mayhem.”\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\tWritten and directed by Ollula and produced by his production shingle Oohlala Pictures and Sweden’s GötaFilm, “Pigtown” won raves from the Nordic Selection jury in Helsinki, which celebrated the “sheer fun, passion and energy” the filmmaking team brought to their pitch. </p>\n<p>\n\t“The global potential for this European co-production is obvious, and they even managed to make it personal and authentic by touching on the importance of community and family, which isn’t easy when your story happens to be a horror zombie comedy,” the jury said.<em></em></p>\n<p>\n\tFinding himself behind the camera for the first time, “Pigtown” marks a new direction for industry veteran Ollula, who cut his teeth as part of the marketing team of 2012’s “Iron Sky” — Timo Vuorensola’s Finnish-German-Australian sci-fi spoof about Nazis on the moon — as well as its 2019 sequel “Iron Sky: The Coming Race.” </p>\n<p>\n\tHis producing credits include the comedy-horror “The Redeemers,” which racked up a string of international sales for Reel Suspects following its 2022 premiere, and the action-horror film “Delivery Run,” which was featured at the Cannes Market’s Frontières Platform for genre films last year. Pic premieres next month at the Sitges Film Festival ahead of a Nov. 5 theatrical release in Finland.</p>\n<p>\n\tAlso on the slate at Oohlala is “Crime and Punishment of Toivo Harald Koljonen,” a true crime horror film currently in development about a notorious axe murderer who was the last person to be executed in Finland.</p>\n<p>\n\t“Pigtown” marks the latest step on an unlikely filmmaking journey for Ollula that began in the Finnish farm town of Huhtamo, where his passion for cinema was sparked at an early age. Speaking in Helsinki, the director recalled how he and his friends would pop cassettes into the family’s VHS player and watch their favorite movies on an endless loop: Peter Jackson’s “Bad Taste” and “Braindead,” “RoboCop,” each entry in the “Evil Dead” and “Friday the 13th” franchises. </p>\n<p>\n\tWith his father’s camcorder, they would then make their own schlocky slasher flicks and splatter pics, with Ollula’s younger brother often serving as their go-to victim.</p>\n<p>\n\tThough Ollula left Huhtamo at the age of 16 to pursue his higher education in Helsinki, the town remains the director’s “source of creativity,” he said. To that end, he launched the biannual Huhtamo Intl. Film Festival in 2017 in an effort to breathe new life into his struggling hometown.\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\t“As a pig farmer’s son, I’ve been watching the decline of the countryside from very close by. Businesses going away, people dying and moving away,” he said. “I started thinking, ‘What can I do to help the situation? I need to do my part.’”</p>\n<p>\n\tCelebrating its fifth edition this year, the festival features folksy innovations such as converting a working barn into a cinema, while recent editions have seen “The Big Lebowski” playing in the town bowling alley and “Top Gun: Maverick” screening on a local airstrip — what Ollula described as “the first and only ‘fly-in’ cinema that I’m aware of.”</p>\n<p>\n\t“Pigtown,” he hopes, will further his mission to use his filmmaking and the festival to give a boost to the local community, both by collaborating with the townspeople during production and by showcasing Huhtamo on the big screen.</p>\n<p>\n\t“My shooting locations are the same locations where my festival happens,” he said. “So at one point, you can be at my festival, watching my film and realizing, ‘Wait a minute — I’m here and there!’”</p>\n<p>\n\tFinnish Film Affair takes place Sept. 24 – 26 in Helsinki.</p>\n</div>"

    "body": "<div><p>\n\tFour years after Ridley Scott’s “House of <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/gucci/\">Gucci</a>” angered members of the Gucci family and a large part of Italy’s film community for what they claimed was a crass and inaccurate portrayal of the Gucci saga, pay-TV operator <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/sky/\">Sky</a> has announced a high-end Italian TV series that will aim to set things right.</p>\n<p>\n\tThe six-episode series — titled “Gucci: Game Over” — will be directed by Gabriele Muccino, who helmed Will Smith-starrer “The Pursuit of Happyness” and a slew of Italian film and TV hits. The show is based on a memoir by Allegra Gucci, the daughter of Maurizio Gucci and Patrizia Reggiani (who were played by Adam Driver and Lady Gaga in “House of Gucci”).\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\t“We will recount the Italian point of view as a response to ‘House of Gucci’ through the eyes of Allegra Gucci,” said Nils Hartmann, EVP Sky Studios Italy during an upfront presentation of Comcast-owned Sky Italia.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tOn March 27, 1995, Maurizio Gucci, the head of the Gucci fashion house and grandson of brand founder Guccio Gucci, was shot dead on the doorstep of his Milan office. The crime was organized by his ex-wife Patrizia Reggiani, who was convicted in 1998.  </p>\n<p>\n\tAllegra Gucci’s book — which is in the form of letters to her murdered father — reveals many family secrets, talks about her parents’ relationship before and after the divorce and describes the details of the March 1995 murder.</p>\n<p>\n\t“After ‘House of Gucci,’ I had the opportunity to tell this important story,” Allegra Gucci said at the Sky presentation, noting that she was “very disappointed” by the Ridley Scott film “because it was a missed opportunity to tell a real and powerful story.”\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\t“It’s a very complex story that we are depicting from Allegra’s point of view,” Muccino added. “It’s a story with plenty of pain, but also glamour, money and power which is the reason why this family group cannibalized itself.”</p>\n<p>\n\tShooting on “Gucci: Game Over” is set to start in the spring of 2026. The show is being co-produced by Sky Studios and Italy’s Lucky Red.</p>\n<p>\n\t“It’s a story that is known around the world, both due to the fame of the brand and the tragedy involved,” said Lucky Red chief Andrea Occhipinti. He also specified that the “Gucci: Game Over” cast will be all Italian — Italy’s film community was not pleased about that fact that Ridley Scott did not use any Italian actors in lead “House of Gucci” roles.</p>\n<p>\n\tWhile fully Italian in terms of talent, the “Gucci: Game Over” TV series certainly has international ambitions.</p>\n<p>\n\t“The prospect of making this important series with Sky gives it international scope,” Occhipinti noted, saying that he is already getting positive feedback from the global market.</p>\n</div>"

    "body": "<div><p>\n\tFinnish filmmaker <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/hanna-nordenswan/\">Hanna Nordenswan</a> makes her feature documentary debut with “Sense and Sensibility,” which tells the story of the unique relationship between a mother and daughter who both work at a cemetery. The project won the award for best documentary at <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/finnish-film-affair/\">Finnish Film Affair</a>, which ran Sept. 24 – 26.</p>\n<p>\n\tProduced by Helsinki-based Zone2 Pictures, “Sense and Sensibility” follows a recovering alcoholic who leans on her mother for support. Their relationship has become symbiotic, and their lives intertwined with the cemetery where both live in employee housing. \n\t</p>\n<p>\n\tThe two women, however, are polar opposites. Whereas Carita’s personality is charged with emotion, her daughter, Christa, depends on logic and rationality. Since becoming sober, she refuses to let people in. Instead, her life revolves around the cemetery, her mother and her rescue dogs.   \n</p>\n<p>\n\tBut as time passes, Carita’s retirement begins to loom, and a heart attack — coupled with Christa’s increasing exhaustion from the demands of her job — changes their relationship to each other and towards the future. Faced with a newfound uncertainty, Christa must decide if she’s ready to leave the safety of the cemetery and confront the world beyond its gates — and, perhaps more importantly, let that world inside.</p>\n<p>\n\tSpeaking to <em>Variety</em> in Helsinki, Nordenswan recalled coming across an article about the quirky mother-daughter duo in the late-2010s, when a Finnish newspaper profiled the women and their unconventional family arrangement. “I had just kept it open as a tab on my computer for two years,” the director said.\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\tAn accomplished journalist who’d directed a handful of documentary shorts, Nordenswan left Helsinki to attend a master’s program at New York’s School of Visual Arts, returning to Finland just before the outbreak of the coronavirus pandemic. Like many others around that time, she said, she found herself preoccupied with thoughts of death. </p>\n<p>\n\tThat, in turn, led her back to Christa and Carita, who spent their working lives cremating bodies, comforting mourners and performing other jobs around the cemetery — tasks they handled with grace and humor. Nordenswan wondered if “maybe they [would] be able to make me feel more comfortable with the idea of death.”</p>\n<p>\n\tOnce approached by the director, the women were hardly camera-shy. “They were like, ‘Well, we have been thinking that this would be a good reality show. Everything that happens here is so crazy, and people should know about it,’” Nordenswan said. “I think they also acknowledged that their relationship is pretty special.”</p>\n<p>\n\tNordenswan began filming in 2022, and “very quickly, I realized that they have this super unique relationship,” she said. “They’re very funny characters. The death part became the background, more than the subject [of the film].”</p>\n<p>\n\t“Sense and Sensibility” wowed the jury at Finnish Film Affair, who praised its “clear vision” and “deeply human yet extraordinary theme” while presenting the story of a mother and daughter “that is highly relatable and could resonate across borders.” The jury added that the film “promises to portray death as a natural part of life, leveraging a comedic tone at parts and strong stylistic choices from the director.”</p>\n<p>\n\tThough Nordenswan initially set out to make “Sense and Sensibility” as a way to conquer her fears about dying, the filmmaking process hasn’t entirely yielded the results she’d hoped for. Yet she said it’s been a gratifying journey nonetheless.</p>\n<p>\n\t“Working on this film hasn’t really made me feel less scared about death the way I had hoped, even though many of the processes surrounding it feel less scary now,” she said. “But it has affected the way I think about my relationship to my mother. I think I’ve learned something about trying to see the best in your mother or daughter, the way the protagonists in this film do.”</p>\n</div>"

With a purple belt in martial arts and a razor-sharp sense of agency, she emerges as one of Anderson’s most compelling young protagonists. “She’s assertive, but not pretentious. She’s hopeful. I think she represents the possibility of a better future,” Infiniti explains.\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\tInfiniti prepared for the role by traveling with Anderson and <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/leonardo-dicaprio/\">Leonardo DiCaprio</a> (who plays her father) to Eureka, Calif. “Meeting people in that town helped me lock Willa in. I noticed how communities interacted, and that grounded her for me.”</p>\n<p>\n\tInfiniti shares the screen with DiCaprio, Regina Hall, Teyana Taylor and two-time Oscar winner Sean Penn. A key sequence with Penn, in which Willa undergoes a tense DNA test, became a lesson in restraint and reactive acting. “It felt like sparring,” she describes. “He’s intimidating, but Paul [Thomas Anderson] encouraged us to lean into that raw, natural reaction. It was exhilarating.”</p>\n<p>\n\tInfiniti is particularly effusive in her admiration for both Hall and Taylor during our sitdown. Speaking about Taylor’s performance, she said she was “so amazing” in bringing the character of Perfidia to life, making her “even more colorful” than what appeared on the page.</p>\n<p>\n\tWhen it came to Hall, Infiniti emphasized how much strength and subtlety she brought to the role of Deandra. “Deandra is a quiet character in a sense, but she’s not quiet,” she asserts. “She really is the most central force of strength that’s in the film, and she does a fantastic job of almost honing in every character and being a mother to Willa — a mother that she never got to have.”</p>\n<p>\n\tDespite the starry company, Infiniti admits she’s still adjusting. “Half of me thought I could be here, half of me thought I couldn’t. I had no industry connections, no on-camera work before this. Paul literally hired me without seeing my first job,” she says. “Now I’m on this press tour and it’s surreal.”</p>\n<p>\n\tInfiniti’s real-life parents, meanwhile, are taking it all in. “My mom cries every time she sees the trailer. There’s a shot of Lockjaw holding Willa’s baby picture and she always says, ‘That’s my baby.’”</p>\n<p>\n\tThough she’s only just arrived, Infiniti is already dreaming of future roles. She’d love to work with Greta Gerwig or Steven Spielberg — and she’s vocal about her passion for movie musicals. “If they ever adapt ‘Natasha, Pierre & The Great Comet of 1812’ into a film, I don’t even need to book it. I just want to be seen for Natasha,” she declares.</p>\n<p>\n\tAs for advice to her younger self, Infiniti borrows wisdom passed down to her: “You have nothing to prove, but everything to show.”\n\t</p>\n<div>\n<figure>\n<p><img srcset=\"https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/MCDONBA_WB020.jpg 3000w, https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/MCDONBA_WB020.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/MCDONBA_WB020.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/MCDONBA_WB020.jpg?resize=1920,1280 1920w, https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/MCDONBA_WB020.jpg?resize=1360,907 1360w, https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/MCDONBA_WB020.jpg?resize=1000,667 1000w, https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/MCDONBA_WB020.jpg?resize=910,607 910w, https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/MCDONBA_WB020.jpg?resize=681,454 681w, https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/MCDONBA_WB020.jpg?resize=450,300 450w, https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/MCDONBA_WB020.jpg?resize=250,167 250w\" src=\"https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/MCDONBA_WB020.jpg?w=1024\" alt=\"\" />\n\t</p>\n<figcaption>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t©Warner Bros/Courtesy Everett Collection\n\t</figcaption>\n</figure>\n</div>\n\t<h4>\n\t\tRapid Fire Questions with Chase Infiniti\t</h4>\n<p>\n\t<strong>Favorite Paul Thomas Anderson film (other than “One Battle After Another”)?<br /></strong>“Boogie Nights.”</p>\n<p>\n\t<strong>Favorite Leonardo DiCaprio performance?<br /></strong>“Catch Me If You Can.”</p>\n<p>\n\t<strong>Favorite Benicio del Toro movie?<br /></strong>“The Usual Suspects.”</p>\n<p>\n\t<strong>Favorite horror film?<br /></strong>“Get Out.” (though she admits she’s a self-described “scaredy cat.”)</p>\n<p>\n\t<strong>Movie that makes you cry every time?<br /></strong>“Toy Story 3.”</p>\n<p>\n\t<strong>Funniest movie of all time?<br /></strong>“One Battle After Another.” (“It’s an action comedy!” she laughs.)</p>\n<p>\n\t<strong>Director you’d most like to work with next?<br /></strong>“Steven Spielberg, Greta Gerwig, or the Daniels.

    "body": "<div><p>\n\tThe 30th <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/busan-international-film-festival/\">Busan International Film Festival</a> wrapped its 10-day run with record attendances, but beneath the star-studded red carpets and celebratory atmosphere, the landmark edition spotlighted an industry in transition. From the crisis facing Korean cinema to the festival’s competitive transformation, here are the five key takeaways that emerged from BIFF 2025.</p>\n<p>\n\t<strong>Korean Cinema’s Crisis Was the Headline</strong>Far from being whispered about in corridors, Korean cinema’s crisis was front and center throughout BIFF, with industry leaders using the platform to openly diagnose challenges and seek solutions. According to Korean Film Council figures, the Korean box office took in around $293 million in the first half of 2025, a drop of 33% year-on-year, with admissions falling by roughly the same margin. August saw a revival of sorts before the onset of fall witnessed more stagnation. A dearth of domestic blockbusters, rising competition from streaming platforms and consumer belt-tightening are drivers of the slump, which threatens to upend one of Asia’s most dynamic theatrical markets. The industry is currently confronting an existential threat to its once-thriving theatrical culture.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tOpening film director <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/2025/film/news/park-chan-wook-korean-cinema-crisis-wga-expulsion-no-other-choice-1236524182/\">Park Chan-wook told <em>Variety</em></a>: “I think that it’s not so much the crisis of cinema. It’s a crisis of the movie theaters. But I also think, in turn, the crisis of the movie theaters is actually, in fact, the crisis of cinema.”\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\tDuring a Winston Baker panel at the Busan market, Jerry Ko of CJ ENM spoke about the challenges facing Korean cinema, noting that “the marketing environment has changed significantly” and that “the blockbuster model that led Korea’s high growth in the 2010s no longer works the same way.” He explained that marketing channels have fragmented and shifted from traditional TV and broadcasting to Instagram, social media, and YouTube, making it “difficult for blockbuster films to spread information to many people.” Ko also discussed financing challenges, stating that “capital markets have generally stagnated” and “financing investors have become increasingly hesitant to invest.”</p>\n<p>\n\tFestival chair Park Kwang-su acknowledged the severity during an India-Korea event, stating: “At present, the Korean film industry is going through a very challenging time.” \n\t</p>\n<p>\n\tOne of the solutions appears to be co-productions, with major Korean companies like CJ ENM and Hive deepening ties with the vibrant Indonesian market. At the same India-Korea event, Busan market chief Ellen Y.D. Kim said, “We look forward to Indian cinema, Korea, and all of Asia working together more closely to create new stories for the future.”</p>\n<p>\n\t<strong>Netflix and Hollywood Agencies Stake Asian Territory</strong></p>\n<p>\n\tNetflix made its strongest play yet for Asian dominance at Busan, delivering its most high-profile slate ever to the festival. The streaming giant partnered with BIFF to present Creative Asia 2025, a day-long industry summit featuring <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/2025/film/festivals/guillermo-del-toro-yeon-sang-ho-creative-process-busan-1236525150/\">masterclasses from Guillermo del Toro, Korean genre master Yeon Sang-ho</a>, and <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/2025/tv/festivals/kpop-demon-hunters-creator-maggie-kang-favorite-character-1236525113/\">“Kpop Demon Hunters” creator Maggie Kang.</a></p>\n<p>\n\tBeyond the summit programming, Netflix had a nine-title slate at the festival including Noah Baumbach’s “Jay Kelly,” Guillermo del Toro’s “Frankenstein,” Kathryn Bigelow’s thriller “A House of Dynamite,” and Byun Sung-hyun’s “Good News.” </p>\n<p>\n\tUTA made its most ambitious Asian expansion push yet, with senior partner David Park unveiling the agency’s multi-territory strategy. “Our plans for Asia are ambitious,” <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/2025/film/news/kpop-demon-hunters-uta-strategy-asian-expansion-1236524163/\">Park told <em>Variety</em></a> ahead of UTA’s annual BIFF party. “We’re thinking about Asia not just in terms of what business we can bring to the U.S., but how can we expand our global footprint working with great artists already in Asia.”</p>\n<p>\n\tUTA’s strategy centers on Korea as its priority, with Japan close behind, extending into Philippines, Vietnam, India and Indonesia through music and cross-medium talent. The agency aims to become “a true partner to multi-hyphenates all across the region,” moving beyond traditional representation to encompass music, brand partnerships and corporate consulting.</p>\n<p>\n\tThe Motion Picture Association ran its Bridge to Hollywood workshop through the Chanel X BIFF Asian Film Academy, with “Rio” director Carlos Saldanha serving as a judge, reflecting growing American interest in developing Asian talent pipelines.</p>\n<p>\n\t<strong>Market Navigates Calendar Challenges</strong></p>\n<p>\n\tBIFF’s move from its traditional October slot to Sep. 17-26, necessitated by the Korean fall holiday Chuseok falling during the festival’s usual dates, created logistical challenges across the international festival ecosystem.</p>\n<p>\n\tThe new dates meant BIFF followed closely after Toronto and overlapped with San Sebastián. Most notably affected was the European Film Promotion delegation, which could only field 18 companies for the traditional EUROPE! umbrella stand at the Asian Contents & Film Market, compared to the usual 30, as several European sales companies cited calendar conflicts and proximity to San Sebastián.\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\tYet ACFM still achieved record-breaking numbers with 30,006 participants, a 13.5% increase from 2024. Market badges reached 3,024 participants from 54 countries, representing a 14.3% increase. Ellen Y.D. Kim, head of ACFM, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/2025/film/markets-festivals/busan-market-chief-tech-driven-future-asian-content-hub-1236525037/\">told <em>Variety</em></a> that ACFM is “evolving beyond a mere transactional venue into a dynamic crossroads where creators, investors, and platforms converge to spark new opportunities reflecting Asia’s content landscape.”</p>\n<p>\n\tThe compressed European presence was offset by strengthened Asian regional participation, with<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/2025/film/markets-festivals/india-korea-coproductions-busan-market-1236525892/\"> India establishing its first-ever pavilion</a> at the market through the WAVES Bazaar – Bharat Pavilion, while Indonesia has had a <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/2025/film/markets-festivals/indonesia-matta-cinema-slate-busan-market-1236525419/\">growing presence at ACFM</a> in recent years.</p>\n<p>\n\t<strong>Competition Section Marks Historic Transformation</strong></p>\n<p>\n\tBIFF’s launch of its first-ever competition section represents the festival’s most dramatic transformation since its 1996 inception. Festival director Jung Hanseok merged the longstanding New Currents and Kim Jiseok programs to create a more impactful platform exclusively for Asian cinema, with 14 films competing for five categories of the new Busan Award.</p>\n<p>\n\t“I came to realize that our two representative sections, New Currents and the Jiseok section, had reached their limits in terms of influence,” Jung <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/2025/film/festivals/busan-director-jung-hanseok-new-course-1236525042/\">explained to <em>Variety</em></a>. The competition jury, chaired by “The Chaser” director Na Hong-jin and comprising Tony Leung Ka-fai, Nandita Das, Marziyeh Meshkiny, Kogonada, Yulia Evina Bhara, and Han Hyo-joo, elevated the section’s profile significantly.</p>\n<p>\n\tAward trophies designed by Palme d’Or winner Apichatpong Weerasethakul added artistic gravitas to the proceedings. The grand prize winner’s selection as the closing film marked another break from tradition, with the competition photocall ceremonies at Busan Cinema Center attracting substantial audiences and establishing the new format as a tentpole event.</p>\n<p>\n\t<strong>Star Power Returns in Full Force</strong></p>\n<p>\n\tBIFF 2025 delivered spectacular guest lineups, achieving record attendance of 238,697 — an increase of approximately 20,000 from the previous year. From special guest Lisa of <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/blackpink/\">Blackpink</a> to Michael Mann, Marco Bellocchio, Guillermo del Toro, Sean Baker, Juliette Binoche, Nishijima Hidetoshi, Kim Minha and Tony Leung Ka-fai the festival attracted an unparalleled roster of talent.\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\tThe festival’s <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/2025/film/news/shu-qi-girl-zhang-lu-gloaming-in-luomu-busan-honors-1236530018/\">competition section delivered notable wins</a>, with Zhang Lu’s “Gloaming in Luomu” taking best film honors and Taiwanese actor Shu Qi winning best director for her directorial debut “Girl.” Shu Qi was pulling double duty at the festival, also starring in Netflix’s “The Resurrected.” </p>\n<p>\n\tThe opening ceremony red carpet buzzed with energy as Lee Byung-hun, star of the opening film “No Other Choice” and fresh from “Squid Game” global success, served as host. The festival welcomed distinguished award recipients including Jafar Panahi (Asian Filmmaker of the Year), Sylvia Chang (Camellia Award), and Chung Ji-young (Korean Cinema Award).</p>\n<p>\n\tGuillermo Del Toro’s appearance alongside actor Shin Yeeun particularly delighted audiences and generated significant social media attention. The festival’s 323 guest visit sessions across 67 events created numerous opportunities for audience interaction.</p>\n<div><p>\n\tMaster classes with Mann and Kogonada drew capacity crowds, while the Actors’ House program featuring Lee Byung-hun, Son Ye-jin, and Ninomiya Kazunari proved particularly popular. The robust programming helped BIFF achieve its highest attendance in recent years, reinforcing the festival’s position as a crucial launchpad for Asian cinema even as the Korean industry grapples with unprecedented challenges.</p></div>\n</div>"

    "body": "<div><p>\n\t“<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/sneakermania/\">Sneakermania</a>” shows no signs of slowing down.</p>\n<p>\n\tIn the upcoming eight-episode Finnish series, produced by <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/helsinki-filmi/\">Helsinki-filmi</a> and set to be broadcast on YLE in February 2026, teenage sneakerhead Ola is determined to become a fashion influencer. </p>\n<p>\n\tWith his friend Bee, Ola – who lives for Air Jordan 1 Low OG Chicago – is trying to build a following and grow their TikTok channel. Until his former best friend Jay steals his thunder. \n\t</p>\n<p>\n\t“The story shifts from lighthearted, friendly banter to moments of envy and dishonesty. While the tone often stays comedic, the characters face real challenges: moments that test their morals, motives, and the limits of what they’re willing to sacrifice,” said director Ima Iduozee. \n</p>\n<p>\n\tOne of the main themes is belonging, he stated. </p>\n<p>\n\t“The desire to be seen, heard and accepted. Social media plays a central role in ‘Sneakermania,’ offering a space to create your self-image and brand, giving you a sense of autonomy over how others perceive you. For Ola, it becomes a way of gaining motion and respect.”</p>\n<p>\n\tWhile there’s “a lot of great stuff coming out of Finland right now,” many stories still wait to be told, stressed Iduozee, also a choreographer for the first Finnish Netflix Original series “Dance Brothers.”</p>\n<p>\n\t“We have so much more to offer than Nordic noir and detective dramas. I wanted to show a version of Helsinki that felt authentic to me. A generation of young creatives who are bold, self-determined and unafraid to go after what they want.”</p>\n<p>\n\tSneaker culture, which has evolved into a global phenomenon, felt like a perfect way in.\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\tThe series debuts its trailer here:</p>\n<figure><p>\n<iframe width=\"500\" height=\"281\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/GPz483KQ_30?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\"></iframe>\n</p></figure>\n<p>\n\t“For a massive number of young adults, sneakers are much more than shoes. They are a cultural language representing identity, creativity and community,” said Mia Ylönen, head of drama at Helsinki-filmi. </p>\n<p>\n\tThe company has also showcased anticipated thriller <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/2024/tv/news/icebreaker-helsinki-filmi-keshet-international-studiocanal-1235963293/\">“Icebreaker” </a>– awarded MipDrama’s Coup de Coeur – at the Helsinki industry event <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/finnish-film-affair/\">Finnish Film Affair</a>. Set on a stranded boat in the middle of icy nowhere, it sees its crew members disappear, one by one. </p>\n<p>\n\tAccording to Ylönen, “Sneakermania” taps into fashion, music and social media through its “magnetic lead characters that represent Helsinki in 2025.” “It’s a series about ambition, self-expression, fashion and, above all, a story about friendship.”</p>\n<p>\n\tLed by first-time headwriter Vilja Keskimäki, the story features tracks from Finnish artists Turisti, Averagekidluke and Bizi. </p>\n<p>\n\t“We brought fashion stylists, designers, dancers and influencers on board early during the production. It was important for us to collaborate with people who truly live the fashion, culture and music of the sneaker world.”</p>\n<p>\n\tOla might be “the beating heart and driving force” of the story, but he’s accompanied by a group of young adults. </p>\n<p>\n\t“They share his passion for sneakers, DIY culture and creative self-expression, and the thrills of finding their place in the world while navigating friendship and ambition,” said Iduozee.</p>\n<p>\n\tYlönen added: “I believe Ima is the next best thing to come out of Finland: a young, creatively unique director whose vibrant vision is something we haven’t seen on Finnish screens before.” </p>\n<p>\n\t“We were looking for the right project and when ‘Sneakermania’ landed on my table, I knew we had the perfect match.” </p>\n<div>\n<figure>\n<p><img srcset=\"https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/MixCollage-27-Sep-2025-09-00-AM-4235.jpg 1500w, https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/MixCollage-27-Sep-2025-09-00-AM-4235.jpg?resize=150,84 150w, https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/MixCollage-27-Sep-2025-09-00-AM-4235.jpg?resize=300,169 300w, https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/MixCollage-27-Sep-2025-09-00-AM-4235.jpg?resize=125,70 125w, https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/MixCollage-27-Sep-2025-09-00-AM-4235.jpg?resize=1000,563 1000w, https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/MixCollage-27-Sep-2025-09-00-AM-4235.jpg?resize=910,511 910w, https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/MixCollage-27-Sep-2025-09-00-AM-4235.jpg?resize=681,383 681w, https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/MixCollage-27-Sep-2025-09-00-AM-4235.jpg?resize=450,253 450w, https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/MixCollage-27-Sep-2025-09-00-AM-4235.jpg?resize=250,140 250w\" src=\"https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/MixCollage-27-Sep-2025-09-00-AM-4235.jpg?w=1024\" alt=\"\" />\n\t</p>\n<figcaption>\n\t\t\t\t\t<span>“Sneakermania”</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCourtesy of Helsinki-filmi\n\t</figcaption>\n</figure>\n</div>\n</div>"

Estonian actor Rea Lest, known for “The Manslayer/The Virgin/The Shadow” and Rainer Sarnet’s “November,” takes on the titular role of Julia. \n\t</p>\n<p>\n\tLaura Hyppönen’s film sees a perfect island holiday spiraling out of control when Julia, a music producer in her early 30s, travels to her new friend Anna’s isolated villa. When Anna introduces her husband JP, Julia instantly recognizes him from her past. \n</p>\n<p>\n\t“It’s a story of a rape survivor meeting her date rapist years after their previous encounter. It explores the dilemmas and differing perceptions of both the victim and the alleged perpetrator, also including the view of the third party – the wife of the alleged rapist,” explained Hyppönen. </p>\n<p>\n\tInspired by personal experience “which took years to distill into a character-driven fiction film,” the Finnish director wanted to “dig deep into the subject of acquaintance rape without moralizing or sensationalizing.” </p>\n<p>\n\tHyppönen’s second feature – following “Live East Die Young,” set in London’s East End’s party scene – was partly shot on a remote private island in the Nordic archipelago. </p>\n<p>\n\t“The film is written as a slow-burning, character-driven suspense drama. The setting adds tension to the story,” she noted, commenting on the “raw, primitive quality” of the footage obtained this way. \n\t</p>\n<p>\n\t“Much of my filmography has been created in a very DIY setting. This sense of restriction is quite apparent in ‘Lex Julia,’ where I chose a single location and only three actors. I love the claustrophobia this kind of limitation creates.”</p>\n<p>\n\tHyppönen opened up about her leads.</p>\n<p>\n\t“For Julia, I wanted to find an actor that could convey strength and vulnerability while also bringing dark humor and unpredictability to the role. For Anna, I looked for someone who could play with lightness and sophistication, but also show a darker undercurrent beneath the surface.” For JP, it was all about “warmth and charm that can flip into coldness and cruelty.”</p>\n<p>\n\tShe was also “looking for an ensemble”: “A trio that would play together, supporting and challenging each other and be willing to explore the darker aspects of the material. I feel very lucky this is exactly what I found in Rea, Jessica and Christian.”</p>\n<p>\n\tProduced by Merja Ritola and Essi Haukkamaa-Judge for Finland’s Greenlit Productions – also at work on “Northern Lights,” recently spotlighted at the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/finnish-film-affair/\">Finnish Film Affair</a> – “Lex Julia” is co-produced by Magdalena Zimecka and Marta Krzeptowska for Studio Produkcyjne Orka (Poland), Marianne Ostrat for Alexandra Film (Estonia) and Daniel Lägersten for GötaFilm in collaboration with Gila Bergqvist Ulfung for Breidablick (Sweden).</p>\n<p>\n\tFrom the very beginning, Hyppönen saw it as a “Nordic film for an international audience.” </p>\n<p>\n\t“I started writing when I was still living in London, but I always imagined it set in the stark and primal Nordic landscape, with its specific light and a social setting that prides itself on gender equality. I wanted to question how deep this Nordic brand of equality actually goes,” she said. </p>\n<p>\n\t“I love films that use genre elements to engage an audience, but do so intelligently enough to explore something real – and shine some light onto the blind spots we all have.” </p>\n<p>\n\t“Film is a very powerful medium and I try to use it to move people. In the case of ‘Lex Julia,’ my goal is to both seduce and to disturb the audience out of their comfort zone.”</p>\n<p>\n\tWhile faced with <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/2025/film/global/finnish-industry-laments-government-cuts-1236522041/\">cultural cuts in Finland</a>, Hyppönen isn’t losing her faith just yet. </p>\n<p>\n\t“Smaller and more experimental films have always been risky endeavors and these tend to be the first ones to be cut when the going gets tough. At the same time, it would seem like a good business idea to continue supporting projects with a riskier profile to ensure diversity and innovation in storytelling.” \n\t</p>\n<p>\n\t“I believe humans have a deep, innate need to share their stories and experiences, no matter what. If public funding doesn’t support more experimental voices, these voices may be buried underground for a while, only to emerge stronger and more confrontational,” she said. </p>\n<p>\n\t“Our prospects may be bleak, but I like to think restrictions and collective rage can create a momentum for change. And change is what we need.”</p>\n</div>"

    "body": "<div><p>\n\tMinutes into “<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/two-pianos/\">Two Pianos</a>,” two former lovers unexpectedly run into each other in the narrow lobby of an venerable Lyon apartment building, after several years of estrangement. In the real world, this would be a cue for some halting, awkward small talk, perhaps, or a passive-aggressive nod of acknowledgement, or just a simple cold shoulder. The world of French auteur <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/arnaud-desplechin/\">Arnaud Desplechin</a>, however, is rather more heated than that: The man promptly faints, banging his head on the elevator door on his way down, while the woman frantically flees, as if from a crime scene. The melodrama begins at such a high pitch in Desplechin’s latest, you might think it has nowhere to go but down, yet this earnestly inflamed tale of art, grief, betrayal and all-consuming <em>amour</em> on steroids keeps finding new, hysterical ways to surprise.\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\tHigh emotions and heightened storytelling have long been fixtures of Desplechin’s filmmaking, not least in the peak-form days of “Kings and Queen” (2004) and “A Christmas Tale” (2008), though he’s lately ramped it up several notches: His last fiction feature, the incest-laced sibling-rivalry drama “Brother and Sister,” was shrill and overwrought from the jump, to swiftly off-putting effect. “Two Pianos” is very nearly as ripely played and ludicrously plotted as its predecessor, though it invites its audience a little more into its theatrics — and has a marvelous cooling factor in Charlotte Rampling, at her most briskly imperious, to counter the emotional chaos drummed up by the film’s younger characters. The result will likely net wider international arthouse exposure than Desplechin’s last few efforts.\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\tFresh off a César nomination for exploring equally torrid territory in last year’s “Beating Hearts” — though here he plays rather more bourgeois — François Civil stars as Mathias, a gifted concert pianist who has spent the last few years teaching in Tokyo, where he appears to have both rested his prodigious talents and closed his heart to romantic possibilities. Now returning to his hometown of Lyon, he’s commissioned by his former mentor Elena (Rampling), herself a celebrated piano virtuoso, to duet with her in a series of concerts that she intends to be her last. </p>\n<p>\n\tOne look at Elena’s fierce demeanor and knife-mouthed expression and it’s clear Mathias never had the option of refusing, even if he’s hesitant for several reasons to return home and to the spotlight: Rampling plays her with the kind of ruler-backed stance and no-syllable-wasted terseness that projects absolute assurance in herself while demolishing it in others. Yet there’s more vulnerability behind that searingly direct gaze than she cares to let on, and her growing awareness of her mortality makes her especially aggravated that her onetime star discovery has, in her view, been wasting his best years. “Two Pianos” is most affecting when centered on the testy nuances of this still tightly bound teacher-pupil relationship.</p>\n<p>\n\tBut there’s a whole lot else going on here besides, beginning with that aforementioned lobby encounter between Mathias and blonde mystery woman Claude (Nadia Tereszkiewicz, more breathily reminiscent than ever of a younger Marion Cotillard). The plotting in Desplechin and Kamen Velkovsky’s script is perhaps more staggered than it needs to be, though we gradually pick up that Claude is an old flame, now married to Mathias’ former best friend Pierre (Jeremy Lewin). </p>\n<p>\n\tNo sooner have we processed that information than a sudden, breakneck narrative swerve places Claude back on the market romantically, and in this particular school of sped-up melodrama, she has no intention of wearing her widow’s weeds longer than a day or two. And that’s before the already frazzled Mathias chances upon a young boy in the park who’s an eerie döppelganger for his childhood self — a discovery that initially threatens a Shyamalan-style supernatural pivot, though a perfectly logical explanation awaits. \n\t</p>\n<p>\n\tLogical, that is, within the faintly cuckoo reality of “Two Pianos,” where no rash decision is left unmade, and the total population of Lyon boils down to about a dozen people. Either you roll with this high-end soap opera register or you don’t, but the actors all commit with considerable integrity to the cause — including Tereszkiewicz, unenviably saddled with the flightiest, least explicable character here, despite her insistence that “I can’t drive men mad, I lack the audacity.” </p>\n<p>\n\tAnd there are ample pleasures of craft here: DP Paul Guilhaume recycles some propulsive handheld technique from his Oscar-nominated work on “Emilia Pérez,” though he also lacquers the love story in suitably saturated, perennially autumnal tones, while composer Grégoire Hetzel provides temperamental orchestral rage and melancholy to accompany the soundtrack’s classical lifting from Bach and Chopin. Only a strangely anticlimactic denouement departs from the florid playbook, as Desplechin chooses exactly the wrong moment to go easy-breezy for a change: For better or worse, “Two Pianos” feels most itself when playing altogether too many notes.</p>\n</div>"
