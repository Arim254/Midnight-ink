    "body": "<div><p>\n\tJ.K. Rowling has taken aim once again at “<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/harry-potter/\">Harry Potter</a>” actor <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/emma-watson/\">Emma Watson</a> amid their <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/2025/film/news/emma-watson-jk-rowling-complicated-relationship-harry-potter-1236528074/\">ongoing rift </a>making headlines this month. The author wrote in a new post on X that Watson “has so little experience of real life she’s ignorant of how ignorant she is,” claiming that she once got a letter from Watson that allegedly showed sympathy towards the public backlash Rowling was enduring for sharing views on the trans community that Watson had already publicly disagreed with.\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\tThe rift between Rowling and Watson started in 2020 after the “Harry Potter” author began sharing views on the transgender community that many found to be transphobic. Watson joined “Harry Potter” co-stars like Daniel Radcliffe by publicly opposing Rowling, sharing in a statement at the time: “Trans people are who they say they are and deserve to live their lives without being constantly questioned or told they aren’t who they say they are.”\n</p>\n<p>\n\tIn her new X post, Rowling said it is completely fine for Watson and Radcliffe to have opinions that do not align with her own. She explained: “I’m not owed eternal agreement from any actor who once played a character I created. The idea is as ludicrous as me checking with the boss I had when I was 21 for what opinions I should hold these days. Emma Watson and her co-stars have every right to embrace gender identity ideology. Such beliefs are legally protected, and I wouldn’t want to see any of them threatened with loss of work, or violence, or death, because of them.”</p>\n<p>\n\t“However, Emma and Dan in particular have both made it clear over the last few years that they think our former professional association gives them a particular right – nay, obligation – to critique me and my views in public,” Rowling continued. “Years after they finished acting in ‘Potter,’ they continue to assume the role of de facto spokespeople for the world I created.”\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\tWatson and Rowling’s rift became a viral talking point this month after Watson spoke on the matter during a recent episode of the “On Purpose With Jay Shetty” podcast. Rowling wrote in her X post that she had always turned down requests to comment on Watson in the past because “I didn’t want her to be hounded as the result of anything I said.” That now changed given Watson’s interview with Jay Shetty, in which Watson said that she can still love her experience of working with Rowling on the “Harry Potter” movies while disagreeing with Rowling’s views on the trans community.</p>\n<p>\n\t“I really don’t believe that by having had that experience and holding the love and support and views that I have, mean that I can’t and don’t treasure Jo and the person that I had personal experiences with,”  Watson said. “I will never believe that one negates the other and that my experience of that person, I don’t get to keep and cherish.”</p>\n<p>\n\tAccording to Rowling, Watson once “asked someone to pass on a handwritten note from her to me, which contained the single sentence ‘I’m so sorry for what you’re going through’ (she has my phone number). This was back when the death, rape and torture threats against me were at their peak, at a time when my personal security measures had had to be tightened considerably and I was constantly worried for my family’s safety. Emma had just publicly poured more petrol on the flames, yet thought a one line expression of concern from her would reassure me of her fundamental sympathy and kindness.”</p>\n<p>\n\t“Like other people who’ve never experienced adult life un-cushioned by wealth and fame, Emma has so little experience of real life she’s ignorant of how ignorant she is,” the author continued. “She’ll never need a homeless shelter. She’s never going to be placed on a mixed sex public hospital ward. I’d be astounded if she’s been in a high street changing room since childhood. Her ‘public bathroom’ is single occupancy and comes with a security man standing guard outside the door. Has she had to strip off in a newly mixed-sex changing room at a council-run swimming pool? Is she ever likely to need a state-run rape crisis centre that refuses to guarantee an all-female service? To find herself sharing a prison cell with a male rapist who’s identified into the women’s prison?”\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\t“I wasn’t a multimillionaire at fourteen. I lived in poverty while writing the book that made Emma famous,” Rowling added. “I therefore understand from my own life experience what the trashing of women’s rights in which Emma has so enthusiastically participated means to women and girls without her privileges. The greatest irony here is that, had Emma not decided in her most recent interview to declare that she loves and treasures me – a change of tack I suspect she’s adopted because she’s noticed full-throated condemnation of me is no longer quite as fashionable as it was – I might never have been this honest.”</p>\n<p>\n\t<em>Variety</em> has reached out to Watson’s representative for comment.</p>\n<p>\n\tAfter Watson, Radcliffe and other “Harry Potter” stars originally spoke out against her views, Rowling went on record saying she would <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.scottishdailyexpress.co.uk/celebrity-news/jk-rowling-says-wont-forgive-32562050\">“never forgive”</a> them after they “cozied up to a movement intent on eroding women’s hard-won rights.” When Shetty asked Watson on the recent podcast episode if she remained open to having a dialogue with Rowling, Watson replied, “Yeah, and I always will. I believe in that. I believe in that completely.”</p>\n<p>\n\tRowling originally reacted to Watson’s interview by <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/2025/film/news/jk-rowling-emma-watson-parody-video-rift-trans-1236530533/\">sharing a parody video</a> of it on X. Comedian IntelLady spoofed Watson’s interview, and Rowling praised the video and added in her caption: “I’m here for all the spoofs.”</p>\n<figure><div>\n<blockquote><div><p>I'm seeing quite a bit of comment about this, so I want to make a couple of points.</p><p>I'm not owed eternal agreement from any actor who once played a character I created.

(The characters’ spoken lines are voiced by Arden Cho, May Hong and Ji-young Yoo.) “KPop Demon Hunters” debuted on Netflix on June 20 and rapidly skyrocketed to popularity. By early August, it had <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/2025/tv/news/kpop-demon-hunters-ratings-netflix-1236478933/\">debuted on Netflix’s list of its most popular movies</a> of all time in the fourth place position, and by the end of that month, it was <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/2025/film/news/kpop-demon-hunters-netflix-most-watched-movie-history-1236496106/\">at the top of that list</a>. The film has surpassed 325 million views, and has remained on the Netflix Top 10 for 14 weeks and counting, most recently charting as the No. 2 title of the week. The massive streaming success led Netflix to release a sing-along version of <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/2025/film/columns/netflix-big-screen-kpop-demon-hunters-sing-along-column-1236496949/\">“KPop Demon Hunters” in theaters</a> for two days in August, which <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/2025/film/box-office/box-office-kpop-demon-hunters-leads-box-office-over-weapons-1236497070/\">grossed $18-20 million at the box office</a>.\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\tThe music from “KPop Demon Hunters” was comparably huge, debuting on top of the Billboard 200 Soundtrack chart and remaining the best-selling soundtrack of 2025. “Golden” was the first-ever female K-pop single to reach No. 1 on the Billboard Hot 100, and it remained there for six weeks. On the Billboard Global 200, “Golden” was No. 1 for 10 weeks.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tThe Oct. 7 episode of “The Tonight Show” will also feature Jennifer Lopez.\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\t“The Tonight Show” is produced by Universal Television and Broadway Video, with Lorne Michaels executive producing.

    "body": "<div><p>\n\tPresident <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/donald-trump/\">Donald Trump</a> has renewed his threat of implementing tariffs on films produced outside the United States. </p>\n<p>\n\t“Our movie making business has been stolen from the United States of America, by other Countries, just like stealing ‘candy from a baby.’ California, with its weak and incompetent Governor, has been particularly hard hit,” he wrote Monday on his social media platform Truth Social. “Therefore, in order to solve this long time, never ending problem, I will be imposing a 100% Tariff on any and all movies that are made outside of the United States. Thank you for your attention to this matter.”\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\tIt’s unclear what reignited the proclamation, but <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/2025/film/news/trump-tariff-foreign-film-national-security-1236386566/\">Trump made a similar declaration in May</a> because he deemed foreign productions a “national security threat” to the American movie industry, adding that they not only draw filmmakers out to other markets but also bring “messaging and propaganda” into the United States. There was uncertainty at the time about whether the president had the authority to institute such a tariff or how it would be implemented.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tFilm and television production in recent years has been decamping from Hollywood to shoot in locations that offer lucrative tax incentives, like the United Kingdom, Australia and New Zealand, which makes filming less expensive. But some movies are filmed internationally because the story takes place in other parts of the world — and directors like Denis Villeneuve (“Dune”) and Christopher Nolan (the upcoming “Odyssey”) prefer to shoot on location rather than soundstages.</p>\n<p>\n\tGov. Gavin Newsom of California, whom Trump referenced in his Truth Social post, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/2025/film/news/gavin-newsom-expansion-film-credit-750-million-1236446309/\">has pushed recently to increase the state’s tax incentive program</a>, including film credits, to boost production in Los Angeles. Meanwhile, Newsom for months has been relentlessly trolling Trump on social media over his policies and proclamations, with the governor regularly making posts that mimic the nature of the president’s unfiltered (and often all caps) tone.\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\t“It’s following his example,” Newsom said at a <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/08/20/us/newsom-trump-social-media.html\">press conference over the summer</a>. </p>\n</div>"

This makes it the fourth international version of the acclaimed Nordic noir series.</p>\n<p>\n\tDirected by Rohan Sippy and starring <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/konkona-sen-sharma/\">Konkona Sen Sharma</a> (“Mumbai Diaries”), Surya Sharma (“Hostages”), Shiv Panditt (“Shaitaan”), and Dhruv Sehgal (“Little Things”), the series consists of six episodes produced by Applause Entertainment and Highgate Entertainment.\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\tCreated by Søren Sveistrup, the original Danish series premiered on DR1 in 2007 and became a cultural milestone, helping establish the international Nordic noir movement. The show followed detective Sarah Lund, played by Sofie Gråbøl, whose distinctive knitwear and tenacious investigative methods became widely recognized. Running for three seasons, the series was notable for its real-time narrative approach and combination of criminal investigation with political themes. It earned a BAFTA among other honors and broadcast in over 100 territories worldwide.\n</p>\n<p>\n\t“Each time ‘The Killing’ is adapted, it feels like an extraordinary honor,” said Sveistrup. “It serves as a lasting reminder of the exceptional talent and vision of the team behind the original. We created a deeply compelling story that resonated with millions around the world, placing Danish television drama on the international stage in a manner that exceeded all our expectations. Congratulations to ‘The Killing’ for continuing its long and remarkable journey.”\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\tPrevious adaptations include the four-season AMC series that aired from 2011 to 2014 and achieved significant success in its own right, a 2016 Russian adaptation, and “Monataf Khater,” which launched on Shahid VIP for Middle East and North Africa audiences in 2022.</p>\n<p>\n\tDR Sales continues expanding its scripted portfolio, having recently received a greenlight from FX for “Cry Wolf,” with additional format deals expected to be announced.</p>\n<div><p>\n\tThe show streams on JioHotstar from Oct. 10.</p></div>\n</div>"

    "body": "<div><p>\n\t<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/emerald-fennell/\">Emerald Fennell</a> has spoken for the first time about her already controversial film adaptation of Emily Brontë’s 1847 novel “<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/wuthering-heights/\">Wuthering Heights</a>.”</p>\n<p>\n\tDuring a panel at the Brontë Women’s Writing Festival in England on Friday, the “Saltburn” and “Promising Young Woman” director said she wanted the movie — starring <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/margot-robbie/\">Margot Robbie</a> as Cathy and <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/jacob-elordi/\">Jacob Elordi</a> as Heathcliff — to convey how she felt reading the book for the first time as a teenager.\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\t“I wanted to make something that made me feel like I felt when I first read it, which means that it’s an emotional response to something,” Fennell said, <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cly0nnrr48ko\" target=\"_blank\">according to the BBC</a>. “It’s, like, primal, sexual.”\n</p>\n<p>\n\tThe <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/2025/film/news/wuthering-heights-trailer-margot-robbie-jacob-elordi-1236481719/\">first trailer for “Wuthering Heights,”</a> which released earlier this month, certainly portrayed that. It features shots of bread being kneaded suggestively, sweat dripping down Elordi’s back, a finger being placed in a fish’s mouth and plenty of bodice-ripping, all set to a remixed version of Charli xcx’s “Everything Is Romantic.” The teaser continued to fuel fervent debate about the film, with some calling it too erotic.</p>\n<p>\n\tBut Fennell disagrees, saying: “There’s an enormous amount of sadomasochism in this book. There’s a reason people were deeply shocked by it [when it was published].”</p>\n<p>\n\tShe added, “It’s been a kind of masochistic exercise working on it because I love it so much, and it can’t love me back, and I have to live with that. So it’s been troubling, but I think in a really useful way.”</p>\n<p>\n\tFennell said that she recognizes the “huge responsibility” of adapting the book, which has been brought to screen several times before, perhaps most notably with the 1992 version starring Juliette Binoche and Ralph Fiennes. \n\t</p>\n<p>\n\t“I know that if somebody else made it, I’d be furious,” she continued. “It’s very personal material for everyone. It’s very illicit. The way we relate to the characters is very private, I think.”</p>\n<p>\n\tThough she’s taken some liberties elsewhere, Fennell — who also wrote the screenplay for the film — asserted that she kept much of Brontë’s original dialogue. </p>\n<p>\n\t“I was really determined to preserve as much of her dialogue [as possible] because her dialogue is the best dialogue ever,” she said. “I couldn’t better it, and who could?”</p>\n<p>\n\tBeyond the film’s apparent eroticism, Fennell has also faced some heat for casting Robbie and Elordi. Cathy is a teenager in the book while Robbie is 35, and Heathcliff is described as being “dark-skinned” while Elordi is not. </p>\n<p>\n\tHowever, Fennell enthusiastically stood by her casting choices during the panel, telling the crowd she knew Elordi was her Heathcliff when she met him on the set of “Saltburn.”</p>\n<p>\n\tElordi “looked exactly like the illustration of Heathcliff on the first book that I read,” Fennell said. “And it was so awful because I so wanted to scream. Not the professional thing to do, obviously.”</p>\n<p>\n\tShe added, “I had been thinking about making [‘Wuthering Heights’], and it seemed to me he had the thing… he’s a very surprising actor.”</p>\n<p>\n\tOf Robbie, the director said she is “not like anyone I’ve ever met — ever — and I think that’s what I felt like with Cathy,” adding that the “Barbie” star is “so beautiful and interesting and surprising, and she is the type of person who, like Cathy, could get away with anything.”</p>\n<p>\n\t“I think honestly she could commit a killing spree and nobody would mind. And that is who Cathy is to me. Cathy is somebody who just pushes to see how far she can go,” Fennell continued. “So it needed somebody like Margot, who’s a star, not just an incredible actress — which she is — but somebody who has a power, an otherworldly power, a Godlike power, that means people lose their minds.”</p>\n<p>\n\t“Wuthering Heights” releases in theaters on Feb. 14.</p>\n</div>"

    "body": "<div><p>\n\tOn the silver screen, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/chris-pine/\">Chris Pine</a> has played heart-stopping action heroes. Now, as narrator of podcast series “Cardiac Cowboys,” he tells the true story of the renegade medical pros who risked their reputations to establish life-saving techniques in heart surgery.</p>\n<p>\n\tFrom <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/iheartpodcasts/\">iHeartPodcasts</a>, “Cardiac Cowboys” is narrated by Pine, the actor, producer, director and writer who is known his roles as Capt. James T. Kirk in the Star Trek reboot film trilogy, Steve Trevor in DC’s “Wonder Woman” films and voicing one of the Peter Parkers/Spider-Men in 2018’s “Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse.”\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\tThe entire six-part series is being released Monday, Sept. 29, <a href=\"https://world-heart-federation.org/world-heart-day/\" target=\"_blank\">which is this year’s World Heart Day</a>. “Cardiac Cowboys” is distributed by iHeartPodcasts, available on the iHeartRadio app and across all major podcast platforms including Spotify and Apple Podcasts.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tPer the show’s logline: “For most of human history, the heart was a sacred organ, off-limits to surgeons. ‘Cardiac Cowboys’ will transport listeners into the operating rooms where these audacious young doctors first dared to challenge conventional wisdom. Working on shoestring budgets, they made use of makeshift laboratories and home garages, rigging together old dairy pumps and beer tubes to build medical devices. In the span of a few short years, these American mavericks pioneered the world’s first open-heart operations, forging tools and techniques that still save lives today.”</p>\n<p>\n\tPine said in a statement, “As the narrator of ‘Cardiac Cowboys,’ I was struck by the sheer bravery and relentless determination of these medical pioneers. This story is about rule-breakers who risked everything to save lives and changed the course of medicine for all of us.”\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\tThe podcast is produced by OSO Studios, founded by Dub Cornett, in association with Pine’s Barry Linen Motion Pictures and 13th Lake Media. John Mankiewicz serves as executive producer. The creative team includes writer and co-host Jamie Napoli and composer David Mansfield.</p>\n<div>\n<figure>\n<p><img srcset=\"https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Cardiac-Cowboys.jpeg 640w, https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Cardiac-Cowboys.jpeg?resize=150,150 150w, https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Cardiac-Cowboys.jpeg?resize=300,300 300w\" src=\"https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Cardiac-Cowboys.jpeg?w=300\" alt=\"\" />\n\t</p>\n<figcaption>\n\t</figcaption>\n</figure>\n</div>\n<p>\n\tSaid Cornett: “When I first heard the story, I knew we had to gather our team and create this series. It’s epic in its real-life battles of life and death. The Cardiac Cowboys have saved countless lives and their work continues to this day. By partnering with iHeartPodcasts to bring this series to the world, we celebrate the physicians whose achievements have touched every family, in one way or another, reaching all of us who have a heart.”</p>\n<p>\n\tWill Pearson, president of <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/iheartmedia/\">iHeartMedia</a>‘s iHeartPodcasts division, commented: “The story of the ‘Cardiac Cowboys’ is a testament to human courage and innovation — qualities that resonate deeply with so many of us. We believe this series will not only honor the pioneers of heart surgery but also inspire listeners to consider what’s possible when boundaries are challenged.”</p>\n<p>\n\tPine will next be seen in “The Kidnapping of Arabella,” which premiered at the Venice Film Festival. Pine just wrapped the Zellner brothers’ “Alpha Gang” alongside Cate Blanchett, Léa Seydoux and Riley Keough. Pine made his directorial debut last year with “Poolman,” which he also co-wrote, produced and starred in opposite Annette Bening, Danny DeVito and Jennifer Jason Leigh. Pine has starred in films including Oscar-nominated “Hell or High Water,” “Dungeons & Dragons: Honor Among Thieves,” Disney’s “Wish,” “Don’t Worry Darling,” “All the Old Knives” and “The Contractor.” He is repped by CAA.</p>\n<p>\n\tListen to “Cardiac Cowboys”:</p>\n</div>"

    "body": "<div><p>\n\t<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/comcast/\">Comcast</a> named <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/michael-cavanagh/\">Michael Cavanagh</a> as co-CEO of the company effective January 2026, a move that would seem to set a succession plan for <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/brian-roberts/\">Brian Roberts</a>, scion of Comcast’s founder and its chairman.</p>\n<p>\n\tRoberts, 66, will continue as chairman and co-CEO, and Cavanagh will be named to the Comcast Board of Directors.</p>\n<p>\n\tCavanagh, 59, will take Comcast’s helm at a challenging moment in the traditional media sector. Comcast’s large cable business has been shedding customers as they move to broadband venues for entertainment, information and sports. And the company is splitting off old-school cable assets from NBCUniversal into a new entity called Versant, betting that its broadcast and streaming assets will grow more without having to be lumped in with cable outlets such as E!, CNBC or Syfy.\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\tCavanagh’s presence has grown at Comcast in recent years. He shepherds the company’s calls with investors, with Roberts weighing in on larger industry issues or future-facing initiatives. And Cavanagh took on oversight of operations at NBCU after the exit of former CEO Jeff Shell — even as he maintained his larger corporate duties.\n</p>\n<p>\n\t“Since joining Comcast a decade ago, Mike has proven himself to be a trusted and collaborative leader,” said Roberts, in a prepared statement. “He is the ideal person to help lead Comcast as we manage the pivot we are making to drive growth across the company. Mike and I work seamlessly together, and I am thrilled to be partnering with him as co-CEO and with the rest of our talented management team, for years to come.”</p>\n<p>\n\tCavanagh joined Comcast in 2015 as chief financial officer, and then rising to president. He previously spent more than two decades in financial services, including as co-CEO of JPMorgan Chase’s Corporate & Investment Bank. He also served as JPMorgan Chase’s CFO for six years, helping the company “successfully navigate the financial crisis.”\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\t“Comcast is a special company with exceptional businesses and an incredible team. It is an honor to work with Brian and the entire Comcast NBCUniversal leadership team during this exciting and transformative time in our industry,” said Cavanagh in a statement.</p>\n</div>"

    "body": "<div><p>\n\t<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/claire-foy/\">Claire Foy</a> opened up about her career at <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/zurich-film-festival/\">Zurich Film Festival</a>.</p>\n<p>\n\tThe British actor, in town also to pick up the Golden Eye Award, presented her latest feature “<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/h-is-for-hawk/\">H Is for Hawk</a>,” fresh off screenings at Telluride.  </p>\n<p>\n\tIn the film, her character Helen unexpectedly loses her father (Brendan Gleeson). To cope with his death, she takes in a hawk: Mabel. Directed by Philippa Lowthorpe, it’s based on Helen MacDonald’s memoir. <em>Variety</em>’s Peter Debruge called it an <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/2025/film/reviews/h-is-for-hawk-review-claire-foy-1236502594/\">“unconventional yet moving grief drama.”</a>\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\t“I had a strong, visceral reaction when I read it,” she said, discussing her character and her way of grieving.  \n</p>\n<p>\n\t“It was there for everybody to see. People still weren’t brave to say: ‘What do you need?’ It’s also a real story of friendship and not abandoning people when they are being very difficult.”</p>\n<p>\n\tFoy had to learn falconry for the role. </p>\n<p>\n\tPreviously, she worked with an elephant in “Breathe” – “I don’t know if I ‘worked’ with an elephant. The elephant was just there,” she joked. She got to know “these incredible birds” before we started shooting. </p>\n<p>\n\t“The training is basically to allow the bird to trust you and get used to you. You just have to be patient and kind, and compassionate. It’s like a house spider – you are terrified of it but it’s more terrified of you. In the book, there’s so much humanity in the way Helen talks about it. That was the key to it. As soon as I knew it was vulnerable, I wasn’t afraid of it.”</p>\n<p>\n\tShe added: “They all had different personalities and I loved all of them.” \n\t</p>\n<p>\n\tFoy drew attention already in 2008 thanks to “Little Dorrit” and “Upstairs Downstairs.” “Wolf Hall” was a “job of a lifetime.” “I met Hilary Mantel and asked her what she had for lunch. I just thought: ‘Say something, say something.’ I think she went: ‘Oh dear.’”</p>\n<p>\n\t“I didn’t think I could ‘make it’. But as a child, I got used to being ignored and then not wanting to be ignored. I was very loud. As a teenager, I went the opposite direction – I avoided anything that involved anyone looking at me. But I loved theater and saw ‘Titanic’ 12 times or something obscene like that. Mostly because of Leonardo DiCaprio.”</p>\n<p>\n\tShe also opened up about 2011 curio “Season of the Witch” – “With Nicolas Cage! I was in Budapest with him, thinking: ‘What on earth?!’ People were getting helicopters and private jets, and that doesn’t exist anymore. To work with an absolute living legend… It was extraordinary.”</p>\n<p>\n\tBut it was Netflix smash “The Crown,” where she played Queen Elizabeth II, that introduced her to mass audiences. She won two Emmy Awards for her portrayal. </p>\n<p>\n\tShe was heavily pregnant at the time. </p>\n<p>\n\t“[Stephen Daldry] had me flirting with Winston Churchill as a very pregnant queen. He likes to see how you can stretch a character. I loved it – it felt like someone was paying attention.” She still remained caution, though. “I was convinced it was going to be a bit silly. Me, pretending to be the queen.”</p>\n<p>\n\tShe noted: “She was much more unguarded [as a younger woman]. I could see her as a person, not as a figurehead.” They never interacted.</p>\n<p>\n\t“That’s the point of the institution: you don’t engage in that. Also, it’s not like ‘H Is for Hawk’ when Helen was on board from the beginning. They didn’t want this to be made. I wasn’t expecting to hear from her.” </p>\n<p>\n\tShe wasn’t afraid of being typecast. “There are not that many queens,” she laughed. Now, an adaptation of Enid Blyton’s children’s novel <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/2024/film/global/enid-blyton-magic-faraway-tree-uk-distribution-1236128055/\">“Magic Faraway Tree”</a> is also looming on the horizon, also starring Andrew Garfield. </p>\n<p>\n\t“I was at Zurich before, with ‘Breathe,’ but it was Andrew Garfield who won the Golden Eye,” she deadpanned.  </p>\n<p>\n\t“With [lifetime achievement] awards, you always think you don’t really deserve that. It’s other people who get these things.”\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\tNot anymore. </p>\n</div>"
