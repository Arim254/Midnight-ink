    "body": "<div><p>\n\tChile’s <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/juntos-films/\">Juntos Films</a> has forged a strategic partnership with <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/bandada/\">Bandada</a>, the new label of former <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/fabula/\">Fabula</a> exec Daniel Castell. The move is aimed bolster its scripted content slate for platforms across the Spanish-speaking market worldwide while also establishing exclusivity for all series moving forward. This includes a first-look deal between the two companies that encompasses both scripted and unscripted feature films as well as non-fiction series.\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\tJuntos partners Francisco Hervé and Moisés Sepúlveda are attending the showrunner workshop at Madrid confab Iberseries & Platino Industria with their series project “Culpables Inocentes.”\n</p>\n<p>\n\tThe company has built its reputation on films designed “to entertain, move and spark reflection,” said Hervé, one of the three partners at Juntos Films. “Our focus has always been on marrying strong creative development with streamlined production processes and this new alliance opens the door to bring that philosophy into premium series,” he added.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tIts credits include the acclaimed “<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/the-fabulous-gold-harvesting-machine/\">The Fabulous Gold Harvesting Machine</a>” by Alfredo Pourailly, which snagged best film at Guadalajara, Sanfic and Lima in 2024; “Bitter Gold” by Juan Olea, awarded in Warsaw and selected in Cairo and India last year; documentary “The Other One” by Francisco Bermejo, which won Best Film in the Burning Lights section at Visions du Réel 2020; and thriller “Immersion” by Nico Postiglione, a multiple winner at Guadalajara and now streaming on Amazon Prime worldwide.</p>\n<p>\n\tFor Castell, who spent nearly 10 years as a creative producer at Pablo and Juan de Dios Larraín’s Fabula before founding Bandada, the partnership marks a logical progression in his career. During his time at Fabula, he played a key role in evolving the company’s TV division – from serving solely the Chilean market to landing original scripted content for international streaming platforms in under five years.\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\tHis credits include Apple TV+’s “Midnight Family”; Spanish co-production “A Long Petal of the Sea,” based on <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/isabel-allende/\">Isabel Allende</a>’s novel with shoot dates and platform yet to be set; Netflix originals “Baby Bandito” and “Homemade”; Amazon Prime Video’s “The Pack” and “The President” as well as Spotify’s audio originals “Quemar tu casa” and “Creepyhunters,” both created by acclaimed scribe <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/julio-rojas/\">Julio Rojas</a> (“Case 63”).</p>\n<p>\n\t“At Bandada we’re dedicated to developing bold, internationally resonant IPs across scripted film and television – ideas that are fresh, outside the box, and built in collaboration with non-hegemonic voices,” Castell said. “Joining forces with Juntos allows us to push those ideas further and wider, combining our networks and creative muscle to build premium series from Latin America for the world. Juntos has a proven track record of backing innovative and risk-taking stories, which makes this partnership especially exciting.”</p>\n<p>\n\tWith Castell on board, Juntos is poised to widen its footprint in premium series, capitalizing on his track record and global experience to develop IPs with large scale appeal.</p>\n<p>\n\t“This alliance signals the beginning of a new chapter for us — one where Chilean stories can thrive on a global stage,” said Juntos’ Sepúlveda.</p>\n<div>\n<figure>\n<p><img srcset=\"https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Daniel-Juntos-ByN-4k-02.jpg 6240w, https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Daniel-Juntos-ByN-4k-02.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Daniel-Juntos-ByN-4k-02.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Daniel-Juntos-ByN-4k-02.jpg?resize=1920,1280 1920w, https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Daniel-Juntos-ByN-4k-02.jpg?resize=1360,907 1360w, https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Daniel-Juntos-ByN-4k-02.jpg?resize=1000,667 1000w, https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Daniel-Juntos-ByN-4k-02.jpg?resize=910,607 910w, https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Daniel-Juntos-ByN-4k-02.jpg?resize=681,454 681w, https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Daniel-Juntos-ByN-4k-02.jpg?resize=450,300 450w, https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Daniel-Juntos-ByN-4k-02.jpg?resize=250,167 250w\" src=\"https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Daniel-Juntos-ByN-4k-02.jpg?w=1024\" alt=\"\" />\n\t</p>\n<figcaption>\n\t\t\t\t\t<span>Daniel Castell  Credit: Felipe Viedma</span>\n\t</figcaption>\n</figure>\n</div>\n</div>"

Vol. 2: Ibiza” at the San Sebastian Film Festival and at Madrid confab Iberseries & Platino Industria.  </p>\n<p>\n\t“33 Days” is the first television series created by renowned true-crime investigative journalist Carles Porta.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tInspired by the real-life escape of two inmates from the Lleida prison in 2001, “33 Days” chronicles their breakout which triggered a 33-day manhunt by Catalonia’s police force, the Mossos d’Esquadra.\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\tThe series focuses on the Mossos’ investigative team and the escapees, whose plan begins to unravel, forcing them to improvise. Then a newly established police force, the Mossos faced mounting pressure and institutional criticism as they faced new challenges at every turn.</p>\n<p>\n\t“We changed the names of the real people involved in order to protect their privacy and also to allow us more creative freedom,” said Porta at the presentation.</p>\n<p>\n\tJosé Manuel Poga and Julián Villagrán star as Prieto and Calatrava as the pair of escapees. Nausicaa Bonnín and Pau Durà play officers Clara Moyano and Pau García.</p>\n<p>\n\tThe cast also includes Blanca Parés, Arnau Casanovas, Xavi Sáez, Alba Pujol and Joan Solé, among others.</p>\n<p>\n\tProduced by <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/atresmedia/\">Atresmedia</a> in collaboration with Luminol Media, Goroka and Lastor Media, the series unfolds over six episodes.</p>\n<div>\n<figure>\n<p><img srcset=\"https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/atresplayer_LaRutaVol2_01-@LaiaLluch.jpg 5084w, https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/atresplayer_LaRutaVol2_01-@LaiaLluch.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/atresplayer_LaRutaVol2_01-@LaiaLluch.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/atresplayer_LaRutaVol2_01-@LaiaLluch.jpg?resize=1920,1280 1920w, https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/atresplayer_LaRutaVol2_01-@LaiaLluch.jpg?resize=1360,907 1360w, https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/atresplayer_LaRutaVol2_01-@LaiaLluch.jpg?resize=1000,667 1000w, https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/atresplayer_LaRutaVol2_01-@LaiaLluch.jpg?resize=910,607 910w, https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/atresplayer_LaRutaVol2_01-@LaiaLluch.jpg?resize=681,454 681w, https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/atresplayer_LaRutaVol2_01-@LaiaLluch.jpg?resize=450,300 450w, https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/atresplayer_LaRutaVol2_01-@LaiaLluch.jpg?resize=250,167 250w\" src=\"https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/atresplayer_LaRutaVol2_01-@LaiaLluch.jpg?w=1024\" alt=\"\" />\n\t</p>\n<figcaption>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tLAIALLUCH\n\t</figcaption>\n</figure>\n</div>\n<p>\n\tMeanwhile, the Ibiza-set Season 2 of ‘La Ruta,’ winner of the 2023 Ondas Award for Best Drama Series and three Feroz Awards, is set to drop on Oct. 26.\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\t“La Ruta. Vol. 2: Ibiza” stars Àlex Monner, who reprises his role as Marc Ribó and also plays Marc’s father, Manuel. Joining the main cast are Carla Díaz, Marina Salas and Irene Escolar.</p>\n<p>\n\tComprising six 50-minute episodes, the new season unfolds along two timelines, acting as both a sequel and a prequel to the first season.</p>\n<p>\n\tSet in 1996, Marc Ribó is the resident DJ at Amnesia, one of Ibiza’s most legendary clubs, as the island rises to global fame as the epicenter of nightlife. But 25 years earlier, in the early 1970s, Ibiza was a very different place—an offbeat, free-spirited refuge under the shadow of Franco’s regime. It was this version of the island that Marc’s parents knew, shortly before their lives were cut short in the 1972 Caravelle plane crash—at the same age Marc is now.</p>\n<p>\n\tMarc’s own youth in Ibiza mirrors that of his parents: parallel yet profoundly different. Just like the island itself, their stories are separated by time but strangely intertwined – echoes of the past resurfacing in the rhythms of the present.</p>\n<p>\n\tTold across two timelines, the new season centers on legacy and the passing of values from parents to children.</p>\n<p>\n\tCast also includes Lucía Martín-Abelló, Fernando Delgado-Hierro and Fernanda Orazi. Several actors from the first season also return.</p>\n<p>\n\tDirected by Borja Soler, “La Ruta. Vol. 2: Ibiza” was shot in the Valencian Community and the Balearic Islands.</p>\n<p>\n\tIn recent years, Atresplayer has become a prominent player in the Spanish fiction landscape, releasing more original series than any other platform in Spain.</p>\n<p>\n\tOriginal productions, available exclusively to premium users, include hits like “Veneno,” “FoQ: La nueva generación,” “Cardo,” “La novia gitana,” and “Drag Race España.”</p>\n<p>\n\t In 2025, the lineup expands with “Mariliendre,” “El Gran Salto,” “Mar afuera” and “Las hijas de la criada,” out in November.</p>\n<p>\n\t“La Ruta. Vol. 2: Ibiza” and “33 Days” both screen at Iberseries & Platino Industria on Sept. 30, its first day of activities.  </p>\n</div>"

    "body": "<div><p>\n\tArgentina’s Twins Latin Films has boarded Natalia Smirnoff’s upcoming feature “Roger on the Loose” (“Roger suelto”), which is poised to shoot next year in the forests and sierras of Córdoba, Argentina.</p>\n<p>\n\tLed by producers Lorena Quevedo and Pablo Di Patrizio, Twins Latin Films joins Argentina’s Año Cero, Spain’s Fasten Films and Mexico’s Maria Jose Cordova of Somos Maravillosa to co-produce the drama.  \n</p>\n<p>\n\tMeanwhile, Twin Latins Films is participating in <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/iberseries/\">Iberseries</a> & Platino Industria’s co-production forum with sports family dramedy “Tiempo fuera.”\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\t“Roger on the Loose” marks a new milestone in Smirnoff’s career, best known for “Puzzle” (Berlinale) and “Lock Charmer” (Sundance).</p>\n<p>\n\tDrama follows Roger, a 33-year-old neurodivergent man living with his sister, Margarita, in their family’s guesthouse nestled in a quiet mountain town. Deeply fascinated by fungi and their ecological mysteries, Roger lives a carefully structured life – one that begins to unravel with the arrival of curious tourists and, in particular, Lucy, who is drawn to the area in search of hallucinogenic mushrooms. As their connection deepens, long-buried desires surface, pushing Roger to confront his growing need for independence and the limits of his reliance on his sister – ultimately setting him on a path toward self-discovery.</p>\n<p>\n\tSmirnoff co-penned the screenplay with María Meira, whose notable credits include “The Substitute” and “Una especie de familia.”</p>\n<p>\n\t“When Federico invited us to join ‘Roger on the Loose,’ it felt incredibly meaningful – a project that combines Natalia’s artistic strength with the urgent need to give voice to neurodiversity and environmental themes, all set against the rich backdrop of Córdoba’s natural landscapes and local talent,” said Quevedo and Di Patrizio.\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\t“Bringing on partners with experience, energy and commitment is key at this stage of the project. We are also excited to shoot in Córdoba, which has been consolidating as one of the country’s strongest audiovisual hubs,” said Federico Sande Novo of Año Cero.</p>\n<p>\n\tCordoba offers a 40% cash rebate program, which provides a beacon of hope for many local beleaguered filmmakers who can no longer count on the support of the National Film Institute, INCAA under the administration of President Milei.</p>\n<p>\n\tTwins Latin Films’ credits include “El Casero” (Best Director, Mar del Plata) and “Almamula” (Berlinale Generation).</p>\n<p>\n\tAño Cero produced Sebastián Muñoz’s “The Prince,” winner of a Queer Lion, Venice, while Barcelona-based Fasten Films’ slate includes “Mediterráneo” and Cannes Golden Camera winner “Inside the Yellow Cocoon Shell.”</p>\n<p>\n\tMaria Jose Cordova of Somos Maravillosa is best known for backing such popular titles as “The House of Flowers,” “Holy Family” and “Someone Has to Die.”</p>\n<p>\n\tThe production team is completed by Rossana Baumeister (“Daughter of Rage”) who serves as an executive producer.</p>\n</div>"

    "body": "<div><p>\n\tFrom Prime Video’s hit series “Red Queen” to Rodrigo Sorogoyen’s “The Beloved” starring Javier Bardem and Diego Luna’s “A Mouthful of Ash,” Madrid has hosted this year high-profile co-productions, many with Latin-American partners.</p>\n<p>\n\tOn the eve of the 5<sup>th</sup> <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/iberseries/\">Iberseries</a> & Platino Industria – the go-to networking event for the Spanish and Portuguese-language audiovisual industry – the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/madrid-film-office/\">Madrid Film Office</a>’s honcho Raúl Torquemada spoke to <em>Variety</em> about the hike in co-productions and filming in the Spanish capital, facilitated by the Madrid City Council’s promotional body.\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\t“Our strategy is two-fold: first to sell the city and its locations. Madrid is a city chameleon-which can easily pass for Buenos Aires, Paris or Mexico, so the filming opportunities are vast. At the same time, we support the local talent and audiovisual sector, to create value for the industry, our city and our region,” Torquemada summarised, pinpointing Spain’s international competitiveness through the 30% tax rebates, wealth of talent, sustained public support, and largest cluster of Madrid-based audiovisual groups – from Netflix, Disney, Amazon Prime Video to Spanish groups Atresmedia, Movistar Plus+, The Medipro Studio, RTVE and Mediaset España . \n</p>\n<p>\n\t“There is an ecosystem in Madrid which favors the development of the entire audiovisual industry,” he insisted, referring to the Madrid-based 3,500 audiovisual outfits and 30,000+ professionals that accounted for 2.6% of Madrid’s GDP according to AFI (Analistas Financieros Internacionales), more than doubling the national average of 1.2%. \n\t</p>\n<p>\n\tTorquemada also underlined the Netflix effect in lifting the Spanish capital to its status of a leading European production hub since the global streamer first set up shop locally a decade ago. “Netflix’s ‘La casa de papel’ [‘Money Heist’] was a landmark show for Madrid and for Spain as it showed what we could do in terms of delivering the highest-quality international production in our city, our region and our country. Moreover, Netflix’s establishment at Secuoya Studios in Tres Campos has fuelled the development of filming infrastructure, with other groups such as EFD Studios following suit. </p>\n<p>\n\tThe collaboration between the private and public sector is key to us,” insisted the Spanish executive.<br />Recent figures regarding the surge of filming activity in Madrid and its region, and of international co-productions -especially with Latin-America-also speak for themselves.</p>\n<p>\n\tAccording to data from Spanish film agency ICAA, shared by the Madrid Film office (MFO), between 2021-2023, almost 40% of the 972 Spanish films produced (fiction, documentaries, animation) were spearheaded by Madrid-based outfits, a level upped to 53% in 2023. Of the 972 films, 194 were international co-productions and 89 (more than 46%) were produced by Madrid-based companies. </p>\n<p>\n\tConfirming the strong ties with Latin America, most feature co-productions during that period involve Argentina (15), Mexico (12) and Peru (7), as well as European countries such as France (16), Portugal (7) or Italy (6). Only some of those films used Madrid as a filming location. </p>\n<p>\n\tLooking at 2024 and MFO’s own data, the Office answered 3,853 specific shooting requests, up almost 18% from 2023, which already saw a 17% climb in demands from the previous year. The city was the setting for 41 films (matching 2023 figures), including 14 co-productions such as Renny Harlin’s “The Beast.” Nearly half of the co-productions (6) involved Latin America, with Mexico contributing five. </p>\n<p>\n\tConfirming Madrid’s status as a prime European hub for series production, 48 fiction and five docu series chose it as filming location, almost on par with 2023 (49 fiction/6 doc).</p>\n<p>\n\tNine of the shows were high-profile international co-productions such as AMC’s third season of “The Walking Dead: Daryl Dixon” and MGM+/BBC’s thriller “Nine Bodies in a Mexican Morgue” starring Eric McCormack and David Ajala which starts airing Sept. 27 on the BBC. Weighing in heavily again, three of the international shows involved Mexico – such as Prime Video’s mega hit “The Red Queen” Season 2 (“Reina Negra: Loba Negra”) based on Juan Gómez Jurado’s bestselling novel trilogy. Meanwhile Argentine star Óscar Martínez toplined the Movistar Plus+ original “Fine Arts” (“Bellas Artes”) as the new director of an important modern art museum in Madrid.\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\tFigures for the first seven months of 2025 reflect the continued growth in feature film productions shot in the Spanish capital, with 46 titles including 10 international co-productions such as the French-Spanish drama “The Beloved” (“El ser querido”) by Oscar-nominated Rodrigo Sorogoyen starring Javier Bardem. Two anticipated titles are co-produced with Mexico: “Mouthful of Ash” (“Ceniza en la boca”) helmed by “Andor” star Diego Luna and the comedy “La navidad en sus manos 2” by Joachín Mazón.</p>\n<p>\n\tOn the TV front, Madrid hosted 33 series, including three co-productions: the high-profile Movistar Plus+ and Arte France’s “The Anatomy of a Moment” (“Anatomía de un instante”) starring Alvaro Morte “(“Honey Heist”), the true crime “El Immortal” Season 3, another Movistar Plus+ Original, produced with DLO and Telemundo International Studios, and Prime Video’s “Red Queen” Season 2.</p>\n<p>\n\tCommercials are plays a key part on Madrid’s filming boom, with 410 shot in 2023, 430 in 2024 and 264 for the first seven months of 2025. </p>\n<p>\n\tLooking ahead Torquemada said “strengthening and projecting Madrid’s image as a friendly and competitive city for international production” will remain his priority, on top of developing filming sustainability efforts.</p>\n<p>\n\tNext to the filming backup, the head of MFO emphasized the Office’s continued “institutional commitment and support to events aimed at bringing the industry together to exchange projects and ideas, where co-production with the rest of Latin America is central.</p>\n<p>\n\t“This is the case”, he underscored, “with Iberseries & Platino Industria, the Platino Awards, the ECAM Forum, and the Documenta PRO and Animario PRO sections, among other events that we sponsor or organize directly from the Madrid Film Office. We can add here also the collaboration between Madrid City Council and Spain’s Academia de Cine for writing residences which always includes one or two Latin-American creators,” he noted.</p>\n<p>\n\tEnhancing the Madrid City Council’s wide range of support to the international film and TV community, Torquemada also cited the “significant line of grants” available via the General Coordination of the Mayor’s Office. “These grants are aimed at promoting Madrid-based productions and, since 2023, they include an endowment similar to that incorporated in the ICAA grant line for minority international co-productions, amounting to 10% of the total budget [€200,000 or $233,000],” he said. \n\t</p>\n<p>\n\tOrganised by EGEDA (Audiovisual Producers’ Rights Management Entity) and the Secuoya Foundation, with support from FIPCA (Ibero-American Federation of Film and Audiovisual Producers), the Community of Madrid, and the Madrid City Council, Iberseries & Platino Industria’s 5<sup>th</sup> edition will run between over Sept. 30  – Oct. 3 at Madrid’s Matadero culture center.</p>\n</div>"

    "body": "<div><p>\n\tMadrid-based confab Iberseries & Platino Industria, now on its fifth edition, welcomes South Korea as this year’s Country in Focus and has invited the Korea Creative Content Agency (<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/kocca/\">KOCCA</a>) to become a strategic partner.</p>\n<p>\n\tThis groundbreaking alliance reaffirms the annual event’s international ambition as it broadens its role to serve as a bridge between Asia, Ibero-America and Europe.\n</p>\n<p>\n\t“We’ve gone from being a transatlantic event to becoming an international one,” said co-director Samuel Castro, who handles the TV industry side while co-director Juan Alía manages film. Players from ZDF, RAI and Beta are also among the participants this year.\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\tKOCCA’s presence at Iberseries will include pitching sessions, conferences and an exclusive showcase of Korean titles with high global appeal.</p>\n<p>\n\t“I say this both as a cinephile and as someone who devours series: I believe Korean content has really connected with European and North American audiences. Korean storytelling aligns well with our own content style and I think that can help facilitate content sales, acquisitions and even co-productions,” said Castro.</p>\n<p>\n\tWhile Iberseries will continue to offer its core programs – co-production forums, pitch sessions, screenings and expert panels –  it will be introducing new talks on trends such as remakes and strategies to boost Latin American content’s worldwide reach, said Castro.</p>\n<p>\n\tMeanwhile Mexican comedian-producer Eugenio Derbez will deliver a keynote address and later lead talks on his Prime Video program, “Traveling with the Derbez,” now on its fifth season. He caps his visit with a talk alongside “Money Heist” lead Pedro Alonso and the cast of “El Juicio,” also produced by his 3Pas Studios, that explores the pursuit of a sexual abuse case.\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\t“We’ve opened up the programming to include content and platforms that want to discuss unscripted content, with companies led by <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/mediapro/\">Mediapro</a> and HBO focusing on unscripted formats — which is something new for us,” he said, adding that Iberseries was also hosting a special conference with TikTok, YouTube and Twitch.</p>\n<p>\n\t“As an event, we need to be ready to offer producers real business opportunities in that evolving space,” he reflected.</p>\n<p>\n\tAnother hot-button topic, AI, will also be covered, with the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/madrid-audiovisual-cluster/\">Madrid Audiovisual Cluster</a>, an economic interest group comprising over 100 Madrid-based companies, leading discussions on artificial intelligence. It will focus on specific cases, production workflows and technical procedures for visual effects (VFX).</p>\n<p>\n\t“The conversation will center on how artificial intelligence can be a useful tool, rather than engaging in the controversy around AI replacing professional jobs,” Castro pointed out.</p>\n<p>\n\tOn the film side, Alia observed how the Ibero-American audiovisual industry has undergone a rapid transformation in recent years. “Today, key trends include the consolidation of international co-productions, which help expand audiences and optimize resources; the growing commitment of streaming platforms to locally produced content with global appeal, and the increasing professionalization of creative and technical teams,” he said.</p>\n<p>\n\tReflecting on the challenges facing Ibero-American filmmakers today, Alía noted that access to financing and sustainable production models remains difficult, especially in an increasingly competitive environment. “Distribution is another key hurdle – ensuring their work reaches both cinemas and streaming platforms to connect with broader audiences,” he noted.</p>\n<p>\n\t“A further challenge lies in adapting to the evolving dynamics of the global market, which increasingly values diverse voices and the ability to resonate with international audiences without losing local identity,” he observed, adding: “In this context, platforms like Iberseries & Platino Industria play a crucial role. They provide opportunities for co-production, training and visibility, helping creators overcome these barriers and strengthen their presence in the global industry.”</p>\n<p>\n\tTo that end, Iberseries plans to expand training workshops and pitch sessions, as these are among the most in-demand activities for accredited participants, Alía said, adding: “As the event continues to grow, our goal is to offer an increasingly diverse range of options that respond to participants’ needs and help them make the most of their experience at Iberseries.”</p>\n</div>"

    "body": "<div><p>\n\tAt Singapore’s <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/all-that-matters/\">All That Matters</a> conference, senior executives from Sony Music Entertainment Japan, Amazon Music, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/netflix/\">Netflix</a> and Gold House dissected Asia’s expanding role as a global content powerhouse, citing anime, K-pop and AI-driven production as forces reshaping the industry.</p>\n<p>\n\tModerated by Angel Lee, who handles music business and legal affairs for Netflix across Southeast Asia, Australia/New Zealand and Taiwan, the “East Meets Everywhere” session explored how Asian IP is scaling across music, anime, gaming and film.\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\tBing Chen, executive chair and CEO of Gold House, stressed the paradigm shift underway. “Historically, global has meant going to the West. The largest trend we’re all complicit in is ensuring that Asia doesn’t need the West — Asia has Asia,” he said. Chen highlighted K-pop’s cross-pollination with Indian music and argued that franchises must evolve beyond star-driven sequels. “’Pokémon’ is the best example,” he noted, citing its world-building structure that allows endless new characters and stories without reliance on superstar actors.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tSony Music Entertainment Japan’s Nobu Nakatake emphasized the persistence required to incubate global fandom. He pointed to “<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/demon-slayer-kimetsu-no-yaiba-infinity-castle-3/\">Demon Slayer: Kimetsu no Yaiba Infinity Castle</a>,” which has grossed more than $600 million worldwide and drawn 67 million admissions. “Building the fan base on a global basis is tenacious work,” he said, underscoring that the franchise’s journey began nearly a decade ago with a manga series before exploding into a cultural phenomenon.</p>\n<p>\n\tAmazon Music’s Frankie Yaptinchay spotlighted the platform’s cross-vertical reach, recalling the milestone of booking K-pop group <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/twice/\">Twice</a> for “Amazon Music Live” in a prime slot following Thursday Night Football. “We saw record viewership,” he said, crediting the combination of Twitch, Prime Video and live fan experiences. Yaptinchay argued that collaborations resonate most when authentic: “It encapsulated all the different pieces that made Amazon special.”\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\tPanelists also pushed for direct artist-to-artist connections. “Artists should speak with the same language with an artist or a creator,” Nakatake said, warning against label-engineered collaborations. Chen added that cultivating smaller circles of devoted fans often drives outsized impact, urging creators to ritualize fan experiences and offer status-based privileges.</p>\n<p>\n\tAs for takeaways, Chen urged artists to harness AI despite creative concerns: “There is, unfortunately, a very high direct correlation between the volume of content created and the size of audience.” Yaptinchay pressed for greater Asian representation at global institutions such as the Grammys, citing the work of the Gold Music Alliance. Nakatake’s closing note was clear: “Be distinct with respecting your cultural identity, not copying the Western top hit chart songs.”</p>\n</div>"

He then explained that when the country faced such tragedy in the past, “the routine would be we express our shock, we express our sadness, we offer thoughts and prayers, we spend a day or two arguing about the appropriateness of bringing up guns at all, and then we do nothing until the next time.” But now, the cycle has been replaced by a “new post-shooting pastime” Stewart labled as “what this one yours?”\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\tStewart then cut to clips of several news outlets plastering political motivations onto mass shooters, saying things like, “The guy is a right-wing Trump-supporting evangelical Christian,” and “He is a Biden supporter. Case closed.”\n</p>\n<p>\n\t“It’s America’s new gender reveal tradition,” Stewart joked. “‘Boom! It’s blue! Ha ha! I’m so happy to blame you! For violence!’ The game is so ubiquitous, now it’s often played before we even know who the perpetrator is.”</p>\n<p>\n\tStewart later explained that it wasn’t always like this. He said that in the “good ol’ days of mass shootings,” the media made a point to “not shower attention on acts designed to get attention.”</p>\n<p>\n\tStewart then cut to clips of older news coverage of mass shootings, with pundits saying things like, “We will not say the gunman’s name or show his photograph,” and “We don’t like naming the gunman because so often they do things just to get attention.”\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\t“That’s right, boys and girls, when I was a boy, there was a brief period in American media where not only wouldn’t they say the suspected killer’s name, they wouldn’t constantly show the suspected killer’s OnlyFans hot shots,” Stewart said, before cutting to a shirtless photo of Luigi Mangione. “Oh, dear lord! Oh, my god! He could have done so much good with those!”</p>\n<p>\n\tWatch the entire segment below.</p>\n<figure><p>\n<iframe width=\"500\" height=\"281\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/k8j3N7dEwzY?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\"></iframe>\n</p></figure>\n</div>"

    "body": "<div><p>\n\tChinese superstar <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/yao-chen/\">Yao Chen</a> returned to the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/pingyao-international-film-festival/\">Pingyao International Film Festival</a> this year in a new role — as a juror for the Roberto Rossellini Awards competition for international films. For the star, the experience of sitting on the other side of the table offered a window into the wider state of global cinema.</p>\n<p>\n\t“I believe not only the Chinese market is facing challenges globally. I think it is a collective predicament,” Yao says, reflecting on the current state of the industry. “If the fortress of cinema cannot withstand the shock, no one in that castle can protect itself.”\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\tAs a juror, she was struck by young filmmakers seeking fresh cinematic languages. Citing Akinola Davies’ Nigerian film “My Father’s Shadow” – which <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/2025/film/global/pingyao-film-festival-2025-winners-1236534600/\">added Pingyao’s Roberto Rossellini Awards best director gong</a> to its Cannes special mention – and experiments with traditional Kodak stock while exploring dreamlike imagery, she says “the interesting dichotomy is that it was exploring a novel cinematic language.” \n</p>\n<p>\n\tYao, known for her razor-sharp performances and social activism, has carved a niche as both a box office draw and a producer with a conscience. Breaking out with the hit series “My Own Swordsman,” Yao transitioned seamlessly into film, headlining critical and commercial hits like “Caught in the Web” and “Lost, Found.” Behind the camera, she’s built a reputation for championing socially resonant stories under the Bad Rabbit Pictures banner, founded by Yao alongside cinematographer Cao Yu and producer Liu Hui, with projects that spotlight women’s perspectives and overlooked narratives.\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\t“In terms of their spiritual kernel or the core of the movie, they are always in coverage of humanity, among god on earth, human, the deities and the nature and involve elements of music and dancing,” she explains. “That is what drives me to trace the origin of our life.”</p>\n<p>\n\tHer recent productions include the arthouse titles Huo Meng’s “Living the Land,” which won best director at the Berlinale, and Rima Das’ Busan winner “Village Rockstars 2,” which are waiting for the right moment to reach Chinese audiences. “Given the difficult market we are facing, we are looking for better timing to bring such good arthouse films to the general public and the audience,” she says. “In recent years, the environment or the living space for arthouse films have been narrower and narrower. We are always in search of solutions to the problems one after another, so we have trained ourselves to be better problem solvers.”</p>\n<div><p>\n\tYao stressed that she wants to remain active both in front of and behind the camera. “Over the years, I have produced many films where I cannot act, but that is also one of my ways of expression,” she says. “For the next project I would look for a project where I can both produce and also help to create, so that I can be in better control of the quality of creation.” She adds with a laugh: “I hope I get to hang around in front of the lenses of the camera until I get totally aged.”</p></div>\n</div>"

    "body": "<div><p>\n\tAt <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/all-that-matters/\">All That Matters</a> in Singapore, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/sony-music/\">Sony Music</a> Asia and Middle East president <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/shridhar-subramaniam/\">Shridhar Subramaniam</a> spotlighted Asia’s fast-rising influence in the global music business, emphasizing cultural diversity, localization and the power of fan-driven economies.</p>\n<p>\n\tSpeaking with veteran music executive Ralph Simon, Subramaniam, who also serves as chair of the International Federation of the Phonographic Industry (IFPI), pointed to the org’s launch of weekly charts across six Asian countries as “an amazing effort” that offers new benchmarks for measuring success. \n\t</p>\n<p>\n\t“Across Asia, there’s a tremendous amount of obvious language diversity, cultural diversity,” Subramaniam said. “It’s almost like the stratified Grand Canyon. As it goes deeper, you’re suddenly revealing new cultures, new colors and new material.”\n</p>\n<p>\n\tSubramaniam highlighted the evolution of regional genres into global formats, citing Indonesia’s folk-rooted dangdut music. Once played in villages, the style has been reimagined by urban youth as “hipdut,” blending traditional rhythms with modern beats. “If you look at the Indonesian charts now, pretty much for most of this year, it’s been one of these sounds that has been sitting on the charts, number one to number 10,” he noted.</p>\n<p>\n\tSony has invested early, launching a dedicated label and acquisitions strategy around dangdut. Subramaniam compared its trajectory to reggaeton, which crossed into Afrobeats and Punjabi music. “We’re seeing a similar thing with this,” he said.</p>\n<p>\n\tThe Philippines is also carving out a niche with Pinoy pop. <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/2025/music/news/sb19-filipino-boy-band-vulnerability-global-impact-netflix-documentary-1236466781/\">Acts like SB19</a>, modeled partly on the K-pop system but deeply localized, are drawing “billions of streams” and now expanding into Japan through live tours and collaborations. “They actually recently landed in Japan, worked with a sister company to try and build out a live tour, and collaborate with local artists,” Subramaniam explained.\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\tThailand’s growing importance was underscored by rising cross-border interest. “China is now starting to have an interest in Thai pop and Thai artists,” Subramaniam said, noting collaborations involving Korean and Japanese players as well as Chinese producers.</p>\n<p>\n\tWhile global breakthroughs often start with pioneers, Subramaniam stressed that “it all starts with having success at home.” He added: “People forget that the rise of K-pop was fundamentally by home fans who propelled it outside of Korea. That’s a concerted effort, but they did that.”</p>\n<p>\n\tWith Spotify uploading 135,000 new songs daily, Subramaniam warned that developing artists is harder than ever. Strategies range from fan economies and live touring to syncs with television, film, gaming and influencers. “You now have a toolkit as wide as to what you can do,” he said. “The challenge is to find the map and the right road for each of these artists.”</p>\n<p>\n\tDespite fragmentation, he remains bullish on Asia’s prospects: “Asia is having its moment, not just from a revenue but also a cultural point of view. About five to seven years ago, we used to account for less than 5% to 7% of the global market. Now we’re up to close to 14% and 15% and could potentially get up to 20%.”</p>\n<div><p>\n\tHe predicted hyper-local scenes will increasingly shape global culture through sheer volume and algorithmic dominance. “It’s almost like you look at the YouTube video charts. It’s insane. It’s entirely operated by Indian and Latin American acts. And so you’ll see that happen on other platforms,” he said.</p></div>\n</div>"
