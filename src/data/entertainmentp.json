    "body": "<div><p>\n\t<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/leonardo-dicaprio/\">Leonardo DiCaprio</a> is paying tribute to a fellow environmentalist, his friend and colleague <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/jane-goodall/\">Jane Goodall</a>, who <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/2025/film/news/jane-goodall-dead-chimpanzees-1236536481/\">died Wednesday</a>. </p>\n<p>\n\tGoodall, 91, was in Los Angeles to give a talk at UCLA.</p>\n<p>\n\t“Today we have lost a true hero for the planet, an inspiration to millions, and a dear friend,” the actor and activist wrote on Instagram. \n</p>\n<p>\n\t“Jane Goodall devoted her life to protecting our planet and giving a voice to the wild animals and the ecosystems they inhabit,” he continued. “Her groundbreaking research on chimpanzees in Tanzania transformed our understanding of how our closest relatives live, socialize, and think — reminding us that we are deeply connected not only to chimpanzees and the other great apes, but to all life.”\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\t“For decades, Jane traveled the world with tireless energy, awakening generations to the wonder of the natural world. She spoke directly to the next generation, instilling hope, responsibility, and the belief that every individual can make a difference. She inspired millions to care, to act, and to hope. She never stopped.”</p>\n<p>\n\t“My last message to Jane was simple: ‘You are my hero.’ Now, we all must carry the torch for her in protecting our one shared home.”</p>\n<p>\n\tHe asked that readers honor her legacy by supporting the <a href=\"https://janegoodall.org/\" target=\"_blank\">Jane Goodall Institute</a> and other conservation groups she cared about. </p>\n<p>\n\tLast year, it was announced that DiCaprio’s Appian Way production company would make a <a href=\"https://deadline.com/2024/12/jane-goodall-biopic-appian-way-disney-eleanor-catton-1236188761/\" target=\"_blank\">feature biopic</a> about Goodall’s life for Disney. It would mark the first time an actress would portray her on film. Eleanor Catton is writing the screenplay for the film, which is still in development.</p>\n</div>"

    "body": "<div><p>\n\tOne does not simply walk into Aramán — they will be thrown into it.</p>\n<p>\n\tWhen <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/critical-role/\">Critical Role</a> debuts the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/2025/tv/news/critical-role-campaign-4-trailer-1236522539/\">first episode of its Campaign 4 Thursday</a>, viewers will see the cast of the Dungeons & Dragons actual-play series begin their new edition of the tabletop roleplaying game mid-story. The in-medias-res choice comes as Dropout’s “Dimension 20” star <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/brennan-lee-mulligan/\">Brennan Lee Mulligan</a> is taking his first turn as <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/2025/gaming/news/critical-role-brennan-lee-mulligan-campaign-4-1236477230/\">game master for a full mainline Critical Role campaign</a>, and allowing longtime GM <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/matthew-mercer/\">Matthew Mercer</a> to sit this one out and become a cast member.\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\t“Brennan comes out of the gate swinging. This is not your coffee shop D&D game where everyone is meeting in a tavern,” Critical Role co-founder, creative director and cast member Marisha Ray told <em>Variety</em>. “And don’t get me wrong — there’s a reason why a lot of games start by everybody meeting in taverns. It’s a good place, everyone can have a few drinks, everyone gets to know each other. This is not that. You are already entering into a pretty detailed woven tapestry of relationships and history between characters, history with the world and the NPCs. So know that you are jumping into a pretty well-cooked stew.”\n</p>\n<p>\n\t(<em>Variety</em> is told that within that metaphorical stew, there will be fictional cranberry rolls served.)</p>\n<p>\n\tMulligan made this unique choice in how to enter the world of Aramán, his newly created setting for Campaign 4, of with the support of Ray, Mercer and the Critical Role team, but it was his initial concept and actually born out of Mulligan’s improv comedy history.</p>\n<p>\n\t“I subscribe to a methodology and a guideline that I learned in improv, which is beginning in the middle is often more clarifying, even though it’s more information dense than beginning at the beginning,” Mulligan said. “It was a great old lesson I learned doing improv, which was, you are going to listen to a 10-minute phone call, but you only get to pick 15 seconds, and you’re only hearing one side of the conversation. So you have 15 seconds to understand what a 10-minute phone call is about. Do you put your 15 seconds at the very beginning, do you put it at the very end, or do you put it in the very middle, in order to increase your chances of understanding what the conversation was about? And most people intuitively know that you go into the middle of a conversation, you are actually more likely to understand what’s going on than going to the beginning or the end of it.” \n\t</p>\n<p>\n\tMulligan added: “Immediately starting without context actually gives you the most context. So I think that a lot of this beginning episode, to me, was about showing you characters in the middle of complicated lives as a way of creating the most possible clarity. Even though it’s very information rich, the idea is you’re going to learn so much about these characters by starting in the middle of events as they are speeding forward.”</p>\n<p>\n\tPer Critical Role, Campaign 4 will see the cast “traverse the new world of Aramán in a West Marches-style approach to gameplay where the story unfolds through the perspectives of three distinct rotating tables: the valiant Soldiers, the vigorous Seekers and the veiled Schemers. As their paths converge, we’ll dive deeper into Aramán, a world of wonder with sorcery stemming from the graveyard of the gods and carrying forward the spirit of epic sagas reminiscent of ‘The Lord of the Rings’ and ‘Game of Thrones.'”</p>\n<p>\n\tThough Critical Role has been choosy with its character art teases and plot hints ahead of Campaign 4’s premiere on Beacon.tv — as well as the Critical Role YouTube and Twitch channels Oct. 2 — Mercer said a great deal will be revealed right up top.</p>\n<p>\n\t“There is a fair amount of deep mystery, very quickly. Very deep mystery with personal stakes across the board,” said Mercer, who is chief creative officer at Critical Role Productions. “As far as pilots for a long-running story go, it’s pretty solid and pretty dense in a really exciting way, where even as players, we were caught off guard when it was our turn to come to the table, because we were so rapt with the other players’ scenes. We’re as much of a fan of the story as we are just people playing in it. So you can definitely look forward to that intensity at times. That goes with just how we engage with the world, but also sometimes how we engage with each other. Not everything starts with friendship — intensely so, at times, so look forward to that good stuff.”</p>\n<p>\n\tThe Campaign 4 cast includes in a mix of old and new Critical Rolers, including Mercer, Ray, Laura Bailey, Taliesin Jaffe, Ashley Johnson, Liam O’Brien, Sam Riegel, Travis Willingham, Luis Carazo, Robbie Daymond, Aabria Iyengar, Whitney Moore and Alexander Ward.</p>\n<p>\n\tAmong the newbies is Moore, who has been overwhelmed to see the frenzy Critical Role fans (known as “Critters”) are already in before the first episode is out.\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\t“It’s been so crazy to see the reception of the characters. I mean, we’ve seen cosplays already. It’s been so wild,” Moore said. “And for me, that’s been one of the most rewarding parts is just knowing that this is a community of artists, and that our little brains and the things that we’re doing and playing a game is inspiring other people to make art. It’s the best feeling in the world.”</p>\n<p>\n\tAs for the staple players, while it will certainly be an adjustment to go to the rotating-tables format and added in so many more cast members for the campaign, the extra additions are very welcome, original Critical Role cast member Sam Riegel said.</p>\n<p>\n\t“It’s been so exciting for the original eight Critical Role folks, because for the past 10 years, we’ve had a text thread among the eight of us, where we have been sharing fan art and cosplay and memes and GIFs and all kinds of stuff that Critters have made about the three campaigns,” Riegel said. “And we still love sharing it with each other. And now that text thread is 14-people large, and it’s so exciting for us to see the new folks geeking out just as hard as we are about every little fan theory and shipping and fan-art piece that we’ve seen so far.”</p>\n</div>"

    "body": "<div><p>\n\t<strong>SPOILER ALERT:</strong> This story contains spoilers from the Wednesday, Oct. 1 episode of “<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/chicago-med/\">Chicago Med</a>.”</p>\n<p>\n\tIt’s official: Hannah Asher (Jessy Schram) and Dean Archer (<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/steven-weber/\">Steven Weber</a>) are having a baby. The Season 11 premiere of “Chicago Med” picked up directly after the events of the Season 10 finale, with Hannah showing up at Dean’s door to tell him that she’s expecting, and <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/2025/tv/news/chicago-med-steven-weber-dean-father-hannahs-baby-1236508449/\">he’s the father</a>. </p>\n<p>\n\tAlthough Dean and Hannah have had a flirty vibe throughout the past five seasons, viewers have never seen them act on that. Of course, that was also due to her on-off relationship with Ripley (Luke Mitchell). The cliffhanger left viewers wondering whether Ripley or possibly Dean could be the father, but there was actually a third option, too.\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\t“We had three possible fathers in that scenario. Ripley, Archer, and the third one. We didn’t talk about this for long, but briefly, we were talking about the door opening, it being Will Halstead,” showrunner Allen MacDonald tells <em>Variety</em>. “That would be the first time we would see Will Halstead for a long time.”</p>\n<p>\n\tNick Gehlfuss, who played Dr. Halstead for eight years before leaving the show in 2023, will <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/2025/tv/news/nick-gehlfuss-chicago-med-season-11-1236498982/\">be back in the second episode</a>, but not because of Hannah. Instead, viewers will get an update on where he’s at with Natalie (Torrey DeVitto); while she won’t be in the episode, Halstead will be back in town with her son, Owen.</p>\n<div>\n<figure>\n<p><img srcset=\"https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/NUP_208235_00134.jpg 1000w, https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/NUP_208235_00134.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/NUP_208235_00134.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/NUP_208235_00134.jpg?resize=910,607 910w, https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/NUP_208235_00134.jpg?resize=681,454 681w, https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/NUP_208235_00134.jpg?resize=450,300 450w, https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/NUP_208235_00134.jpg?resize=250,167 250w\" src=\"https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/NUP_208235_00134.jpg?w=1000\" alt=\"\" />\n\t</p>\n<figcaption>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tElizabeth Sisson/NBC\n\t</figcaption>\n</figure>\n</div>\n<p>\n\tUltimately, MacDonald decided that making Archer the father would create “the most interesting and fertile ground for storytelling dramatically,” since their friendship has grown so much. He explains that the pair slept together at the end of “The Book of Archer,” the 17th episode of Season 10, when Hannah showed up at Dean’s door with dinner and dessert.\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\t“Jesse and Steven both beautifully played the aftermath of that,” he says. “It’s like ‘The Sixth Sense.’ You can go back and watch, and you can see it. It’s right there on screen; you just weren’t looking for it. They slept together, then decided to continue to be friends, and were doing fine with that.”</p>\n<p>\n\t(Going back and watching episode 18, when Hannah and Ripley go have a discussion, Dean is shown giving the pair the side eye, possibly showing a bit of jealousy.)</p>\n<p>\n\tSo far, the audience has never even seen the two kiss — “they have always been friends with a little bit of a vibe that they don’t even necessarily acknowledge or deny,” MacDonald explains — and there are no plans to show the night they got together via flashbacks.</p>\n<p>\n\t“The reason that it was off-camera is because we wanted to preserve the surprise,” he says. “As a fan, I’m not gonna lie. I would have wanted to see that, but it just seemed that the surprise when she shows up at his door, and the surprise of the confirmation in the premiere was the way to go.”</p>\n<p>\n\tWeber jokes, “I don’t think anybody wants to see that,” but adds, “There’s a whole season to go beyond this. Where the story goes from there is, it’s going to be up and down. I wouldn’t be surprised if there will be some show of affection. It’s something that measures up to the kind of relationship that they have developed, which is a unique relationship. So, whatever affection they are capable of bringing to this unique relationship, it will be consonant with who they are, and it will be earned, not just from a TV romance kind of thing.”</p>\n<p>\n\tAs for what’s next, the duo “decided to continue to be friends” after their hookup, and now, everything has changed, says MacDonald. “Now she’s pregnant. How is that going to affect their relationship? Moving forward, will they remain friends? Are they even going to get along? Is it going to be an issue between them? How does it affect their feelings? But one way or another, it’s going to shake things up between them.”</p>\n<p>\n\tHannah’s storyline will mark the first time a series regular first responder on a “One Chicago” show will have a seemingly positive pregnancy arc. Over the last decade, the franchise has featured multiple miscarriages and fertility issues, as well as couples choosing to adopt.\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\t“It’s a lot to ask of an actor, because it means, on a very basic level, that Jesse’s going to have a prosthetic strapped to her, and it’s going to get bigger and bigger as the season goes on. It’s hard. I’m not the first TV writer to say this, but it’s hard to commit to having a baby on a TV show, but I felt that this was the right way to do it,” MacDonald says. “Jesse was completely on board. It’s going to be hard on her for that part of it, but it is something we intend to follow through with.”</p>\n<p>\n\t“Chicago Med,” produced by Universal Television and Wolf Entertainment, airs on NBC Wednesdays at 8 p.m. ET.</p>\n</div>"

The rollout will include presentations in 70mm and 35mm, with plans to play in all major markets.</p>\n<p>\n\t“I wrote and directed it as one movie — and I’m so glad to give the fans the chance to see it as one movie,” Tarantino wrote in a statement on the release. “The best way to see ‘<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/kill-bill-the-whole-bloody-affair/\">Kill Bill: The Whole Bloody Affair</a>‘ is at a movie theater in glorious 70mm or 35mm. Blood and guts on a big screen in all its glory!”\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\t“The Whole Bloody Affair” removes the cliffhanger ending from “Kill Bill Vol. 1” and the recap opener of “Kill Bill Vol. 2,” bringing the pair together as a single cohesive storyline. The release will also include a never-before-seen 7 1/2-minute animated sequence.\n</p>\n<p>\n\t“Kill Bill” was originally conceived and filmed as a single feature, but was split into two installments during the editing process to accommodate its epic-length four-hour-plus runtime. The parts were released six months apart, in October 2003 and April 2004. The pair of installments, considered by Tarantino as his collective fourth feature, were a box office success, grossing more than $330 million worldwide between them.</p>\n<p>\n\tTarantino premiered “The Whole Bloody Affair” at the Cannes Film Festival in 2006, playing out of competition. In 2008, he first floated plans to put out “The Whole Bloody Affair” as a single release. The re-edited work debuted in 2011 at the director’s own New Beverly Cinema in Los Angeles. The film has remained in the vault for years since, becoming somewhat of a white whale for the director’s fans.\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\tThe film only came back to a theater this past summer, with his Cannes personal print, French subtitles and all, getting an eventized limited run at L.A.’s Vista Theater, which the director also owns. That run included an intermission between the first and second parts.</p>\n<p>\n\tLionsgate currently manages library distribution rights for several Tarantino features, including “Reservoir Dogs,” “Jackie Brown,” “Inglourious Basterds,” “Django Unchained,” “The Hateful Eight” and “Death Proof.”</p>\n</div>"

    "body": "<div><p>\n\t<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/shane-black/\">Shane Black</a>‘s name is synonymous with some of the most macho movies ever made, including “Lethal Weapon,” “The Nice Guys” and “The Last Boy Scout.” His newest film, “<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/play-dirty/\">Play Dirty</a>,” now streaming on Amazon Prime Video, is no exception. A contemporary interpretation of Donald E. Westlake’s classic “Parker” novels about a high-stakes robber, the film stars <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/mark-wahlberg/\">Mark Wahlberg</a> and LaKeith Stanfield as thieves aiming to pull the biggest international heist of their lives. Yet a globetrotting action movie starring two alpha dogs was well-trodden territory for Black, who has spent his life working with larger-than-life A-listers like Robert Downey Jr., Arnold Schwarzenegger, Bruce Willis and Russell Crowe. Needless to say, he’s figured out the method to maintain control on set when he’s in the director’s chair.\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\t“I’ve been absolutely blessed to work with some of the ‘magic people,'” Black says. “‘Magic people,’ to me, are those that you hire and say, ‘There’s that actor that does that thing. There he is, doing that thing that we paid him for.’ But the more interesting thing has always been when you hire them, knowing you don’t quite know what you’re going to get — you just know it’s going to be great. I’ve worked with a number of those, chief among them Robert Downey Jr., who was just lightning in a bottle. You’re not quite sure what you’re going to get. And I’m happy to take credit for it when suddenly it’s on the screen.”\n</p>\n<p>\n\tWahlberg showed his magic in a unique way, coming in with a preparedness that reflects his notorious work ethic.</p>\n<p>\n\t“Mark showed up having memorized the script,” Black says. “He knew every nuance of it. He didn’t sit before, mumbling — he knew all the lines, so then you could vary from that. If someone wants to improv, and there were some people on the set who were particularly prone to that, Mark keeps up. Mark just jumps at it. He sees a chance to fire back. That sort of being in the moment is what I like about Mark in particular, because as much preparation as he does, when he steps onto set, he lets go and is in the now. I think that’s an actor’s greatest asset: to let the previous work inform the performance, but not be thinking about it when you’re in the moment.”\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\tMany of Black’s scripts are defined by a bickering buddy dynamic, and “Play Dirty,” which he wrote with Charles Mondry and Anthony Bagarozzi, is no different. Wahlberg’s foil is played by Stanfield, and Black, an actor himself, says the “Atlanta” alum approaches the craft in a completely different way.</p>\n<p>\n\t“I was talking to LaKeith about acting and I said, ‘I was always a little bit nervous. I felt like I couldn’t quite get there.'” Black says. “And he said, ‘I don’t understand that, because to me you have all these choices. You just pick one. You’re at the hub of a wheel, and all these spokes are going out to the edge, to the behavior of the character. You go, “Which one do I want to take?”‘ It’s like that frustrating musician: when you can’t write music and you say, ‘How do you do it?’ He goes, ‘Oh my God, there are melodies in the air. You just pluck one.’ It’s like, dude, it’s not that easy, you know? But to him it is, because he’s just an inquisitive soul.”</p>\n<div>\n<figure>\n<p><img srcset=\"https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/MCDPLDI_MG002.jpg 3000w, https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/MCDPLDI_MG002.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/MCDPLDI_MG002.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/MCDPLDI_MG002.jpg?resize=1920,1280 1920w, https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/MCDPLDI_MG002.jpg?resize=1360,907 1360w, https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/MCDPLDI_MG002.jpg?resize=1000,667 1000w, https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/MCDPLDI_MG002.jpg?resize=910,607 910w, https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/MCDPLDI_MG002.jpg?resize=681,454 681w, https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/MCDPLDI_MG002.jpg?resize=450,300 450w, https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/MCDPLDI_MG002.jpg?resize=250,167 250w\" src=\"https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/MCDPLDI_MG002.jpg?w=1024\" alt=\"\" />\n\t</p>\n<figcaption>\n\t\t\t\t\t<span>Mark Wahlberg and LaKeith Stanfield in “Play Dirty.”</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t©MGM/Courtesy Everett Collection\n\t</figcaption>\n</figure>\n</div>\n<p>\n\tWhile he’s quick to cite the talents of his cast and crew, Black’s reputation in Hollywood as a nice guy who gets results precedes him. Jules Daly, who produced “Play Dirty” as well as big action features like “The Tomorrow War” and “Ghosted,” says that the chance to work with Black was what first drew her to the project.</p>\n<p>\n\t“There’s talk about Shane Black being a bit reserved, being shy, being insular, being brilliant but being those things — and we had the greatest time,” Daly says. “Working with anyone who’s a writer and director for a producer is just such a pleasure because you can be on the go, you can be sitting at video village and make a change. We also had [co-writers] Anthony and Chuck with us. So it wasn’t like we were sending pages overnight back to the U.S. and waking up to them and they weren’t good enough the next day. But sitting with the three of them and making the movie was just an absolute pleasure and a laugh.”</p>\n<p>\n\tDaly also says that Black’s previous hits made one specific part of her job easier.</p>\n<p>\n\t“More so than any director I’ve worked with, all cast wants to work with Shane Black,” she says. “There was nobody that we couldn’t get on the phone, no one that didn’t want to be in the movie. It was all just about scheduling. That was more remarkable than almost any director I’ve worked with. It was just such an easy movie to cast and the cast is delicious.”\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\tDespite the success of his previous work, Black says it’s critical for him to remain focused by toning down the outside noise.</p>\n<p>\n\t“Shutting off the hype is necessary in the same way that you can’t think about the money,” he says. “When you’re hired to write a script, you can’t think, ‘Oh my God, this page was this much money, it better be good.’ Once you take on the job, the job becomes it. That’s all there is, the focus on and attention to bringing whatever instinct you have to it.”</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd sometimes that comes with having to trust your gut and not get too meta. For example, many of Black’s most famous movies are set during Christmas, from “Lethal Weapon” to “Kiss Kiss Bang Bang” to “Iron Man 3.” But even though Black knew a yuletide feel in “Play Dirty” would get a nod of recognition from fans, at first he didn’t want to lean into it.</p>\n<p>\n\t“People often talk about the Christmas motif that I sometimes have in movies,” Black says. “Once people notice that, that jig is up. I would do it, but at the same time, I was thinking, ‘Now that it’s sort of a one-trick pony that people are actually noticing, it’s actually part of what you called “the hype,” then it’s kind of lost its luster.’ Now, in this movie, I wanted to do winter in New York City, and I thought, ‘Oh my God, here we go again.’ We could set it in February on Presidents’ Day, but you know, why? We’re in New York, it’s winter, might as well be Christmas.”</p>\n<p>\n\tThat sense of adventure is what Black says keeps him making movies.</p>\n<p>\n\t“I tend to look for things that, especially as I get older, are arguments to myself to still believe in a sense of wonder, to still believe in writing the next chapter,” he says. “Themes that are important seem to be people who get knocked down and find a reason — despite themselves — to get up and continue.”</p>\n<p>\n\tWatch the “Play Dirty” trailer below.</p>\n<figure><p>\n<iframe width=\"500\" height=\"281\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/6paP2-ry-QY?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\"></iframe>\n</p></figure>\n</div>"

(<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/2021/tv/features/and-just-like-that-michael-patrick-king-explains-major-character-death-1235131079/\">Big was shockingly killed off during the premiere episode of “And Just Like That”</a> after suffering a heart attack while working out on a Peloton.) </p>\n<p>\n\t“Big was fantastic for her and it was such perfect casting with Chris Noth,” Corbett said.</p>\n<p>\n\tCarrie and Aidan originally went their separate ways during “Sex and the City” after she wouldn’t commit to a marriage proposal. But Corbett reprised his role in “And Just Like That.”</p>\n<p>\n\tWhile Aidan and Carrie tried to make things work this time around, the series finished with them split up for good. The last episode ended with Carrie revising the epilogue to her novel to read, “The woman realized she was not alone – she was on her own.”</p>\n<p>\n\t“And Just Like That” aired its final episode on Aug. 14, just two weeks after it was revealed that the third season would be its final one. </p>\n<p>\n\t“And just like that… the ongoing storytelling of the ‘Sex and the City’ universe is coming to an end,” showrunner, writer and director <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/2025/tv/news/and-just-like-that-series-finale-carrie-ending-1236488455/\">Michael Patrick King</a> wrote in a social media post at the time. “While I was writing the last episode of ‘And Just Like That…’ Season 3, it became clear to me that this might be a wonderful place to stop.”\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\t<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/2025/tv/news/sarah-jessica-parker-reacts-and-just-like-that-ending-carrie-1236476787/\">Parker wrote on Instagram</a>, in part, “Carrie Bradshaw has dominated my professional heartbeat for 27 years. I think I have loved her most of all. I know others have loved her just as I have. Been frustrated, condemned and rooted for her. The symphony of all those emotions has been the greatest soundtrack and most consequential companion. Therefore the most sentimental and profound gratitude and lifetime of debt. To you all.”</p>\n<p>\n\tCorbett said he learned the show was ending through news reports. “I was as shocked as everybody when it was announced that it was over,” he said, adding, “I’m bummed. I’m gonna miss seeing what those girls are up to.”</p>\n<p>\n\tAs for Carrie being single in the end, Corbett laughed, “Carrie’s gonna be alone for about 12 hours. As soon as she breaks up with somebody, it’s about seven or eight hours before she’s in the sack with someone else. Don’t be fooled by Carrie being alone. By dinner time the next night, she’ll have a new guy.”</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Just-for-Variety-Logo-Lockup-Headshot.pngtiw=639\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Just-for-Variety-Logo-Lockup-Headshot.png 639w, https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Just-for-Variety-Logo-Lockup-Headshot.png?resize=150,55 150w, https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Just-for-Variety-Logo-Lockup-Headshot.png?resize=300,111 300w\" /></p>\n</div>"

    "body": "<div><p>\n\tAmid rising backlash from fellow comedians and human rights advocates, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/bill-burr/\">Bill Burr</a> is defending his appearance at the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/riyadh-comedy-festival/\">Riyadh Comedy Festival</a>, calling it “one of the top three experiences I’ve had” and “mind blowing.”</p>\n<p>\n\t“It was great to experience that part of the world and to be a part of the first comedy festival over there in Saudi Arabia,” Burr said on the Sept. 29 episode of his “<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TXf2e5nHKfI\" target=\"_blank\">Monday Morning Podcast</a>.” “The royals loved the show. Everyone was happy. The people that were doing the festival were thrilled.”\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\tDuring the episode, Burr talks about arriving in Riyadh with apprehension due to the years of negative portrayals in Western media. “You think everybody’s going to be screaming ‘Death to America’ and they’re going to have like fucking machetes and want to chop my head off,” Burr said. “Because this is what I’ve been fed about that part of the world.”\n</p>\n<p>\n\tHis biggest surprise, came from the restaurants available and from the audience itself, which he described as young, diverse and eager to engage with stand-up comedy.</p>\n<p>\n\t“Is that a Starbucks next to a Pizza Hut next to a Burger King next to a McDonald’s? They got a fucking Chili’s over here!”</p>\n<p>\n\tHe continued: “I had to stop a couple times during the show and say, ‘I’ll be honest with you guys, I cannot fucking believe any of you have any idea who I am,’” Burr said. “It was just this great exchange of energy. They know their reputation. So they were extra friendly.”</p>\n<p>\n\tFellow comedian Atsuko Okatsuka said she previously declined an invitation to perform, sharing excerpts from a contract that included bans on political, religious and LGBTQ+ content. Burr acknowledged those original restrictions but claims they were loosened after artists pushed back.\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\t“The organizers were told, ‘If you want some good comedians, this isn’t going to work,’” Burr explained. “To their credit, they said, ‘All right, what do we got to do?’ And they negotiated it all the way down to just a couple things: don’t make fun of royals or religion.”</p>\n<p>\n\tAccording to Burr, he was able to perform most of his regular act with only minor adjustments.</p>\n<p>\n\tIn one tense moment, he recalls beginning a joke about sex, only to see a couple get up and leave.</p>\n<p>\n\t“I’m like, ‘Oh fuck. Am I in trouble?’” Burr recalled. “But they came back a few minutes later, and afterward, security told me, ‘You’re fine. All that stuff is allowed here.’”</p>\n<p>\n\tBut not everyone is convinced.</p>\n<p>\n\tOn Monday, comedian David Cross <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/2025/tv/news/david-cross-slams-bill-burr-riyadh-comedy-festival-1236534601/\">released a scathing public statement</a> blasting performers who agreed to take the stage in Riyadh.</p>\n<p>\n\t“I am disgusted and deeply disappointed in this whole gross thing,” Cross wrote. “That people I admire…would condone this totalitarian fiefdom for… what, a fourth house? A boat? More sneakers?”</p>\n<p>\n\tCross singled out Burr, Dave Chappelle, and Louis C.K., arguing they had forfeited the right to complain about censorship or “cancel culture” in the U.S.</p>\n<p>\n\tOther comics such as Marc Maron and Shane Gillis <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/2025/politics/global/marc-maron-human-rights-riyadh-comedy-festival-1236530044/\">have also publicly condemned the festival</a>, along with Human Rights Watch calling the festival part of the Saudi government’s long-running “whitewashing” campaign on an interview with CBS News.</p>\n<p>\n\tThe Riyadh Comedy Festival, which runs through mid-October, is the latest effort by Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman’s Vision 2030 initiative to modernize and diversify Saudi Arabia’s economy through entertainment and tourism. In addition to Burr, the lineup includes Kevin Hart, Aziz Ansari, Whitney Cummings, Pete Davidson, Gabriel Iglesias and others. The festival’s ties to Saudi Arabia’s controversial Minister of Entertainment, Turki Al-Sheikh, and the kingdom’s broader human rights record — including the 2018 murder of journalist Jamal Khashoggi, alleged ties to the 9/11 attacks, and repression of LGBTQ+ individuals and political dissidents — continue to cast a shadow over the event.</p>\n<p>\n\tDespite the criticism, Burr remained unapologetic on the episode. </p>\n<p>\n\t“People are cool. Governments are the problem,” Burr said. “Every time I travel, I learn the same thing. And the people I met there? They just wanted to laugh. And they fucking did.”</p>\n</div>"

    "body": "<div><div>\n<p>\n\t<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/james-cameron/\">James Cameron</a> prefers not to revisit his movies after they’ve opened in theaters. “I usually have a moratorium of a couple of years where I just don’t want to think about it,” he says. “There’s a certain point when you’ve been away from where you could start to be more of an audience and less of a picky filmmaker.”</p>\n<p>\n\tThe filmmaker had to break that rule, however, with 2022’s “<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/avatar-the-way-of-water/\">Avatar: The Way of Water</a>,” because of the impending release of the third film in the series, “<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/avatar-fire-and-ash/\">Avatar: Fire and Ash</a>,” in December. </p>\n</div>\n<p>\n\t“We’re going through the finish of the VFX now [on ‘Fire and Ash’] — we have been, really, for the last two years, but we’re really coming down to the wire now,” he says. “And I want to be thematically consistent about the way music was used and underscore during dialogue scenes and things like that. So I have rewatched it. It’s a pretty good ride, I have to say!”</p>\n<p>\n\tAudiences will have their own chance to re-watch “The Way of Water” on the big screen on Oct. 3, when the film — which grossed $2.3 billion worldwide — <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/2025/film/news/avatar-way-of-water-screenings-fire-and-ash-footage-1236529491/\">is re-released into theaters</a> in anticipation of “Fire and Ash.” The former film traces the family saga of Jake Sully (Sam Worthington) and Neytiri (Zoe Saldaña) after the events of 2009’s “Avatar,” when they defeated the military assault on the Na’vi by Col. Miles Quaritch (Stephen Lang). In the sequel, set 16 years later, Jake and Neytiri have a clan of five children, including an adopted daughter, Kiri (Sigourney Weaver), born from the inert Na’vi avatar of Weaver’s deceased human character from the 2009 film, Dr. Grace Augustine, and a quasi-adopted human son, Spider (Jack Champion), who was orphaned when his biological parents, including Quaritch, died in battle. Quaritch is resurrected in “The Way of Water” into his own Na’vi avatar, and he resumes his relentless pursuit of the Sully family, which puts Spider in the middle of the conflict.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tIn an interview with <em>Variety</em>, Cameron discussed what else from “The Way of Water” will pay off in “Fire and Ash,” the major change he made to “Fire and Ash” after he’d finished filming, how the future of the “Avatar” franchise (Disney has a fourth and fifth film dated for 2029 and 2031) could affect his plans to <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/2024/film/news/james-cameron-ghosts-of-hiroshima-last-train-from-film-1236146096/\">direct a feature adaptation of the book</a> “Ghosts of Hiroshima,” and why he is working to make the visual effects process a more “creative culture.” (Note: This interview was conducted on Sept. 26, before the controversy started over AI performance simulation Tilly Norwood.)\n\t</p>\n<div>\n<figure>\n<p><img srcset=\"https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/DF-116378_R2.jpg 6240w, https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/DF-116378_R2.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/DF-116378_R2.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/DF-116378_R2.jpg?resize=1920,1280 1920w, https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/DF-116378_R2.jpg?resize=1360,907 1360w, https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/DF-116378_R2.jpg?resize=1000,667 1000w, https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/DF-116378_R2.jpg?resize=910,607 910w, https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/DF-116378_R2.jpg?resize=681,454 681w, https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/DF-116378_R2.jpg?resize=450,300 450w, https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/DF-116378_R2.jpg?resize=250,167 250w\" src=\"https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/DF-116378_R2.jpg?w=1024\" alt=\"\" />\n\t</p>\n<figcaption>\n\t\t\t\t\t<span>James Cameron on the set of “Avatar: The Way of Water.”</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMark Fellman / 20th Century Studios\n\t</figcaption>\n</figure>\n</div>\n\t<h5>\n\t\tWhen you re-watch your films, do you find that allows you to discover new things about the movie that you hadn’t noticed before?\t</h5>\n<p>\n\tIt does in the sense that you start to realize how much of filmmaking is subconscious and can’t be quantified. My job all day long is to quantify minutia. I’m looking at a VFX shot: “OK, you see the way his foot comes down on that one fern and the way it brushes aside. I’m not quite buying that. I think you should re-sim that.” I mean, it’s endless. It’s every detail, every blade of grass, every flicker of fire, all of the lighting interactions, and you get so down into the weeds that it takes stepping back and seeing the film to realize that there’s a big unconscious driver that’s running underneath all of that detail that’s telling you when you’ve got the essence of the moment. And so when I see the film, I go, “Oh, that actually works. I actually feel what I’m supposed to be feeling.” I guess what I see after the fact is, yeah, I get sucked down the rabbit hole of the details, but I don’t sacrifice the essence. </p>\n\t<h5>\n\t\tHow is the VFX process going for you now?\t</h5>\n<p>\n\tIn fact, as I’m working with the VFX people, I’m trying to create a new culture around that — not a technical culture, but a creative culture. When I’m talking to the effects sequence supervisors and the animators and the lighters, it’s like, “What is the most important thing about the shot and why? What is its narrative purpose? What are we saying with this shot? Now, don’t think in shots. Think in flow.” I’m trying to get them to think in flow. Why does this shot exist? I could do anything. I could not have it in the movie. I could have done a completely different shot. Why do you think I did that shot? \n\t</p>\n\t<h5>\n\t\tWhat’s the goal for you?\t</h5>\n<p>\n\tI want them to internalize for themselves that storytelling process. They go way down the rabbit hole, much deeper than me, on the technical side, and are far more capable technically than I am. So I want to give them a little bit of that storytelling magic dust to own for themselves. And it’s working. It started on “The Way of Water,” and it’s continued a lot more on “Fire and Ash.” It’s what I call a first look final. It’s the craziest thing in the world. The creative culture is so strong across all these artists that I can look at a shot for review for the very first time and say “It’s done.” That is the craziest thing. Anybody that’s worked in VFX is going to be saying “Whaaaat?” </p>\n<p>\n\tNow, they may be on version 400 but they’ve had enough input previously that they’re now working within a culture that encourages the creativity and the specificity of our “Avatar” world and our characters. So this idea of really encouraging them to think as storytellers is really paying off. And this is why the Gen AI stuff is never going to take the place of that. We need our artists. It’s artists in control of the process, right? </p>\n<p>\n\tSo it’s actually become a kind of crazily joyful finish. You know, it was a fraught production, let’s face it, but it’s been a kind of a joyful finish, because it’s really starting to resonate and fire on all cylinders, and we’re getting a lot of first look finals, which is nuts.\n\t</p>\n\t<h5>\n\t\tYou shot most of the material for “The Way of Water” and “Fire & Ash” from 2017 to 2019, right?\t</h5>\n<p>\n\tYeah, we started September of 2017. We went for 18 months, but we did both movies, all of it, other than some planned reshoots and some places where I got creative and wrote some new scenes. But the vast majority — call it 95% — was shot in that 18 month window. That was Sigourney playing 15-year-old Kiri across both movies, which actually worked great, because she’s got a story arc across the two movies. There was a kind of a major story arc, where 2 and 3 really tell one big story. And then ultimately, if I get so lucky and I make 4 and 5, 4 and 5 tell one big story. So it kind of stops for a beat after the end of 3. I don’t mean we’ll necessarily stop in production, but the story kind of stops and then it jumps forward in time a little bit.</p>\n\t<h5>\n\t\tSo how that distance affect your relationship to the material? With the kids especially, they’re much older now than when you were first filming.  \t</h5>\n<p>\n\tIt creates this weird cognitive dissonance, where I’m always shocked by how long it’s been since we actually captured the moment. Because there’s a sense of immediacy. I’m<em> in</em> the story, working on this scene. It feels very immediate. I can remember where everybody was standing. I can remember even secondary characters in the background, which of our troop characters played each one of those secondary characters. It feels like I did it last week. It was five or six years ago.</p>\n<p>\n\tFortunately, the cast are just as energetic. I just was doing press with them last week. They’re just as pumped and passionate about their characters and what we’re doing as they ever were, and can’t wait to get on to the next one — if we should get so lucky as to make some money with these now that are being re-released and being released. So the energy is there, the excitement’s still there, but it’s a weird cognitive dissonance.</p>\n<div>\n<figure>\n<p><img srcset=\"https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/AFA-TP-89395.jpg 1600w, https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/AFA-TP-89395.jpg?resize=150,84 150w, https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/AFA-TP-89395.jpg?resize=300,169 300w, https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/AFA-TP-89395.jpg?resize=125,70 125w, https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/AFA-TP-89395.jpg?resize=1000,563 1000w, https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/AFA-TP-89395.jpg?resize=910,511 910w, https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/AFA-TP-89395.jpg?resize=681,383 681w, https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/AFA-TP-89395.jpg?resize=450,253 450w, https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/AFA-TP-89395.jpg?resize=250,140 250w\" src=\"https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/AFA-TP-89395.jpg?w=1024\" alt=\"\" />\n\t</p>\n<figcaption>\n\t\t\t\t\t<span>Sam Worthington in “Avatar: Fire and Ash”</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCourtesy of 20th Century Studios\n\t</figcaption>\n</figure>\n</div>\n\t<h5>\n\t\tDoes that dissonance wind up affecting the film?\t</h5>\n<p>\n\tThe good news is I don’t really second guess my creative impulses. Unless, and this happened a little bit on “Fire and Ash,” I’m looking at it going, you know, I’m not that much of a genius screenwriter. There’s something a little off here in the storytelling. And so, our Toruk is back [in “Fire and Ash”], right? You know, the big bird that Jake rides [in the climax of the first “Avatar”]. I’ve always been waiting for the question, “Why doesn’t he just go get the big red bird and kill everybody like he used to do?” Because that doesn’t exist in “The Way of Water” at all. \n\t</p>\n<p>\n\tI got a big scoop here. It didn’t exist in “Fire and Ash.” And I went, “Oh, he’s got to go get the bird.” Come on! I was saving it for a later film. I was like, “Fuck that! He should get the bird. Get the Toruk.” There’s something in Jake’s destiny that requires it, right? So I just re-wrote it, and we went back and we shot two or three scenes around that concept, and I threw some stuff out and stuck that in. And we’re at three hours, big surprise! But it works beautifully, and the actors were super-excited about that idea. It’s like, oh, okay, that feels right, you know? </p>\n<p>\n\tSo it’s not set in stone. It’s a constantly evolving creative process. And that’s what keeps you vigorous and engaged. </p>\n\t<h5>\n\t\tBased on the “Fire & Ash” trailers, it’s clear that Spider and Kiri play crucial roles in the third film. Are there any other elements introduces in “The Way of Water” that audiences should especially pay attention to when re-watching the film?\t</h5>\n<p>\n\tYou’ve got the primary couple, Jake and Neytiri. Obviously at the end of “The Way of Water” — three years in, I don’t think we have to worry about spoilers — their eldest son dies. In the typical universe of superheroes and so on, grief is not really dealt with, because it’s an impediment to all the cool stuff you want to see. But I thought, Nah, I want to be very authentic about these people emotionally. I want them to be real. I want that to inform and put pressure on their relationship. Because in the real world, when parents lose a child — I’m a parent of five. Sam has three. Zoe has three sons. You know, it’s the inconceivable thing for all of us that we all fear. What would that do? In the real world, it tears marriages apart. There’s blame, there’s grief that gets in the way and a lot of marriages don’t survive that. So we got the ultimate love story, kind of Romeo and Juliet, you know, Smith and Pocahontas on another planet. And then it gets challenged. Are they going to survive as a relationship?</p>\n\t<h5>\n\t\tAnything else?\t</h5>\n<p>\n\tYou’ve got these new characters, Spider, Kiri, Lo’ak, they all come to real fruition in movie 3. But the beautiful thing about this re-release is you get to remind yourself of how important all these relationships are, and then we pay them all off — sometimes for good, sometimes not so good. But the point is, they’re on a greater arc. Kiri’s arc, very important. Spider’s arc, I think you could tell from the trailer, we’re going places with him. He’s also the glue that glues all the other relationships together. Jake and Quaritch, they’d just be two guys trying to kill each other for six hours of two movies. Sorry, that’s boring. Where it gets nuanced is when they’ve got this kid between them, and they’re the two different father figures, and sometimes they have to work together to keep him alive. It becomes much more nuanced as a result of these younger characters. And by the way, if you’re a kid, you’re going follow them. It’s not a family movie about the parents. It’s a family movie about the kids.\n\t</p>\n<div>\n<figure>\n<p><img srcset=\"https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/avatar-2-spider.png 1800w, https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/avatar-2-spider.png?resize=150,100 150w, https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/avatar-2-spider.png?resize=300,200 300w, https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/avatar-2-spider.png?resize=1360,907 1360w, https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/avatar-2-spider.png?resize=1000,667 1000w, https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/avatar-2-spider.png?resize=910,607 910w, https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/avatar-2-spider.png?resize=681,454 681w, https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/avatar-2-spider.png?resize=450,300 450w, https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/avatar-2-spider.png?resize=250,167 250w\" src=\"https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/avatar-2-spider.png?w=1024\" alt=\"\" />\n\t</p>\n<figcaption>\n\t\t\t\t\t<span>Jack Champion in “Avatar: The Way of Water”</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCourtesy of 20th Century Studios\n\t</figcaption>\n</figure>\n</div>\n\t<h5>\n\t\tFinally, what is the timeline for you to direct “Ghosts of Hiroshima”? You’ve said that right now, there’s nothing keeping you from directing the next two “Avatar” movies.\t</h5>\n<p>\n\tWell, I first of all, “Ghosts of Hiroshima” was written by a friend of mine. I gave them permission to announce that I had bought it to turn into a film, but I haven’t written a script yet. So once I get a script I like, then I can answer that question, but that’s not the case right now. Now, I’ve got a couple of other things that haven’t been announced that I also want to do, and it’s a question of — that one [“Ghosts of Hiroshima”] I will direct. Doesn’t matter when I do it, I’ll direct that one. There are others that I may or may not direct. And the big swing in all of this is, do we make any money with “Avatar 3”? I mean, we’ll make some money. But the question is, what kind of a profit margin, if any, is there, and how much of an inducement is that to continue on in this universe? Or maybe we wait a while until we figure out how to bring costs down. Because production costs have spiraled over the last few years, especially in VFX. Everything’s gone up an enormous amount, and it’s starting to close out the type of films that I like to make. </p>\n<p>\n\tSo there’s an argument for taking a pause and figuring that out. There’s an argument for going out and doing some smaller, more personal film in the meantime, while that gets figured out. There’s an argument, in wild success, for us just launching and just going straight into [“Avatar 4” and “Avatar 5”] and I figure out a production methodology where I have a bit of a hiatus where I can make another film. And there’s another argument that says just go make those two damn movies and figure everything else out when I’m 80.</p>\n\t<h5>\n\t\tSo where are you in those arguments?\t</h5>\n<p>\n\tIf you’re interpreting from that that I’m at a bit of a crossroads here — it’s not all mapped out. You know, life isn’t like that. I <em>am</em> at a bit of a crossroads here, and I’m going to have to see what draws me to what as I go forward. The only thing I can tell you right now, I’m not going to stop being a director and a storyteller. That’s the only thing I can confirm at this stage.\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\t<em>This interview has been edited and condensed.</em></p>\n</div>"
