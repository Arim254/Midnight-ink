    "body": "<div><p>\n\t<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/elizabeth-olsen/\">Elizabeth Olsen</a> is finally back as Scarlet Witch in “<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/marvel-zombies/\">Marvel Zombies</a>,” albeit just in a voice role. The four-episode Disney+ animated series is a spinoff of “What If…?” and is set in a world where most of the population, including the Avengers, are zombies. Olsen voices her fan favorite superhero alongside many returning Marvel alum, including Paul Rudd as Ant-Man, Iman Vellani as Ms. Marvel, Simu Liu as Shang-Chi and more.</p>\n<p>\n\t“I truly recorded that years ago. I can’t remember <em>anything</em>,” Olsen admitted at L.A. Comic Con (via <a href=\"https://www.gamesradar.com/entertainment/marvel-tv-shows/scarlet-witch-star-elizabeth-olsen-cant-remember-anything-about-marvel-zombies-despite-being-a-main-character-in-the-mcu-show/\" target=\"_blank\">GamesRadar</a>) when asked about her Scarlet Witch return. “I need to watch it. I have no idea what [happens in] ‘Marvel Zombies.'”<br /><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.gamesradar.com/entertainment/marvel-tv-shows/scarlet-witch-star-elizabeth-olsen-cant-remember-anything-about-marvel-zombies-despite-being-a-main-character-in-the-mcu-show/\"></a><br />Olsen continued, “It’s my voice. I did it in my house, I wasn’t even in an office space. This must have been 2020, 2021? Why was I working in my house and not in a studio? I really have no idea what it was like. I’m so sorry.”\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\tOlsen debuted as Scarlet Witch in the post-credits scene of 2014’s “Captain America: The Winter Soldier” before her proper supporting role in 2015’s “Avengers: Age of Ultron.” She has since gone on to star in blockbusters like “Avengers: Infinity War” and “Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness” and headlined the Disney+ series “WandaVision,” for which she earned an Emmy nomination. \n</p>\n<p>\n\tThe “Doctor Strange” sequel remains Olsen’s last in-person Marvel appearance as Scarlet Witch. The movie turned the character into a full blown villain and ended with Scarlet Witch crushed under a collapsed building. Her fate is unknown, and neither Olsen nor Marvel have yet to announce when Scarlet Witch will reappear. She has not been announced as a cast member for next year’s “Avengers: Doomsday.”\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\tOlsen<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/2024/film/news/elizabeth-olsen-marvel-misused-scarlet-witch-1236140748/\"> said last year</a> she’s open to reprising Scarlet Witch in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, but only if there’s a way to use the character well.</p>\n<p>\n\t“It’s a character that I love going back to when there’s a way to use her well, and I think I have been lucky that when I started I was used well,” Olsen said in a recent interview with FM104 (via <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://collider.com/elizabeth-olsen-mcu-scarlet-witch/\">Collider</a>). “People didn’t know what to do with me for a second there. … If there’s a good way to use her I’m always happy to come back.”</p>\n<p>\n\tAll four episodes of “Marvel Zombies” are now available to stream on Disney+.</p>\n</div>"

    "body": "<div><p>\n\tGiven the pressures of modern existence, it’s clear why an adaptation of Michael Ende’s 1973 novel “<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/momo/\">Momo</a>” would appear utterly relevant in 2025. More than ever, the hours in the day seem insufficient.</p>\n<p>\n\tIn writer-director <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/christian-ditter/\">Christian Ditter</a>’s glossy take on the fantastical story about the preciousness of time, an enigmatic red-haired girl named Momo (Alexa Goodall) lives inside the amphitheater of an unnamed European city (perhaps closest in look to Rome). Locals take an interest in Momo given her special talent for listening to people. When someone confides in her, the speaker feels magically compelled to be truthful. They leave the exchange feeling relieved and acknowledged, a rarity in the attention-starved era of the internet. Strangely, instead of being integral to the narrative as a whole, Momo’s fit serves as the vehicle for her to learn the Grey corporation’s villainous plans.\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\tThose who work for Grey are “time thieves,” otherworldly entities that rely on stealing hours from humans to live. Their ploy to do so is convincing the populace to wear bracelets that monitor when they use their time in a productive manner or when they “waste” it on enjoyment. All the time saved, they think, will accumulate for them to spend it with their loved ones or pursue their passions later in life. It’s a straightforward cautionary tale about how modern economic systems demand productivity and consumption, while robbing the masses of the energy and space to chase fulfilment during their all-too-finite lives. However, the way time is actually extracted or how it might be returned to the person saving it is left unexplained. For a film that also introduces other well-defined futuristic technology as not-so-distant threats, the lack of concrete mechanics for this core aspect feels disappointing.\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\tMomo’s mysterious origin as a young girl who appeared without a family makes for an intriguing departure point. But once she accepts her mission to save everyone else from the time thieves, the heroine isn’t allowed any ambivalence or contemplation about her future or her past. And while that’s in line with the notion of living in the moment, one wonders if the character doesn’t long for a parent, or to go to school, or to experience life as other kids her age do. Does she not question why she was chosen or created? Momo comes across more like a concept than a person. Goodall’s charismatic performance should certainly further her nascent career, but within “Momo,” there are built-in limitations to what she can showcase emotionally beyond unwavering determination.</p>\n<p>\n\tAside from the amphitheater’s good-natured janitor Beppo (Kim Bodnia), Momo’s most meaningful relationship is her friendship with Gino (Araloyin Oshunremi), a teenager working multiple jobs to help his mother Liliana (Jennifer Amaka Pettersson) support his siblings. When Grey offers him a platform to realize his dream of building a fanbase, Gino becomes a digital star via high-tech contact lenses that people wear to watch content. As with most ideas in “Momo,” this nod to how social media warps our worldview and eats away our time is blatantly obvious, but only skin deep since the filmmaker won’t engage with the whys.</p>\n<p>\n\tPartway through, Momo, aided by a tortoise whose shell displays glowing text to communicate, travels to an alternate reality to meet Master Hora (an amusing Martin Freeman), a generic benevolent magic man who discloses a bit more exposition in the form of narration throughout the adventure. Carefully deployed VFX enhance the whimsy in this realm where a giant pendulum over water represents the passage of time. There’s an atemporal quality to the film’s stylized alternate reality, which blends an old-world charm with signs of a technocratic dystopia, all contained to a few blocks in an imaginary town. The film’s impressive production values at least makes for an eye-catching watch.</p>\n<p>\n\t“Momo” struggles to shape its derivative components into a cohesive whole, but as soon as one digs any deeper about the lore or the characters’ motivations or inner conflicts, the film reveals itself to be shallow. The commentary on how responsibilities take over our lives, forcing us to dismiss what’s truly valuable, never dares to substantially poke at the reasons why this occurs, such as economic inequality, lack of opportunities and corporate greed. In evolving the original text for current times, keeping the theme’s profundity to “time doesn’t exist in their watches but in their hearts” feels almost disingenuous, even if aimed at young audiences.\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\tWhen Momo inevitably saves the day, after stopping time and facing off against the leader of the Grey antagonists (played by a stoic Claes Bang), it all seems to go back to normal. Everyone has presumably learned the value of time, but have their material conditions changed for them to actually be able to focus on the things they want to do? That much remains a mystery.</p>\n</div>"

    "body": "<div><div><p>\n\tLet’s be frank: everyone thinks they can act. On a weekly basis, I have people ask me about “getting some voice over work for extra money” or doing a show “for fun.” And I have to wonder if any other industry is viewed this way. Do doctors have friends who suggest popping in for a quick organ transplant for kicks? Do relatives ask cops if they can borrow their gun and badge for a day? There’s a reason acting is so aspirational and yet so hard to succeed at.</p><p>When stories broke over the weekend about what people are calling the first AI-generated actress, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/tilly-norwood/\">Tilly Norwood</a>, the response from Hollywood was so negative that one really had to wonder what the creators expected. In a time where the industry has been decimated by COVID, strikes and changing business models, who thought this would be celebrated? Celebrities from Kiersey Clemons to Melissa Barrera quickly <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/2025/film/global/ai-actress-tilly-norwood-backlash-hollywood-1236533740/\">weighed in</a>, with the former noting: “How gross, read the room.” Perhaps Oscar-nominated actor Toni Collette said it best, when she posted the story with a series of screaming-face emojis.\n\t</p></div>\n<p>\n\tLet’s put aside the issues of taking already-diminishing jobs from working actors, in addition to the ethical ambiguity of essentially passing animation off as a person. What makes me cringe the most right now is that people have quickly come to label Norwood an AI “actress,” a term that is like Freddy Kruger’s glove on a chalkboard to me. It’s inaccurate, it’s insulting and it’s interesting to note that even her creators don’t refer to her that way. Norwood is the creation of Xicoia, an “AI talent studio” (a contradictory term, really) from Eline Van der Velden, the CEO of London-based tech production company Particle6. In a response to the backlash this morning, Van der Velden said, “To those who have expressed anger over the creation of my AI character, Tilly Norwood, she is not a replacement for a human being, but a creative work — a piece of art.”\n</p>\n<p>\n\tThat last claim is a whole other column but the first part caught my eye instantly – even Van der Velden (an actor herself) refers to Norwood as a “creation.” She argues that Norwood is a work of art, “an act of imagination and craftmanship, not unlike drawing a character, writing a role or shaping a performance.”<br />In which case, we should call Norwood a “creation” or even “an art project,” which I’d be fine with. It’s probably gentler than some of the terms my actor friends suggested this morning, which include: a deepfake, an animated character, a “hamdroid” and – my personal favorite – Grand Theft Automaton.\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\tIt can be easy to dismiss the craft of acting – perhaps it should be taken as a compliment that actors make their job look easy. It’s a testament to their talent. But as someone who has been cut out of almost every film and TV role they’ve shot (even when cast as myself!) let me assure you: It Is Not. While some people are gifted with an inherent talent, it requires practice and craft to deliver a great performance. Every great athletes still practice, they don’t just show up on game day. And that craft is informed my many things – empathy, free will and life experience. That’s not something that can’t be built through an algorithm or crowdsourcing.</p>\n<div><p>\n\tIn her initial statement, Van der Velden said the company wanted Norwood “to be the next Scarlett Johansson or Natalie Portman” which shows a grotesque lack of understanding not only of acting but precisely what makes those actors special. I hesitate to even drag them into this, as both are gifted performers who spent years proving they are more than precisely what Norwood is: an attractive face that can repeat lines. It’s also somewhat ironic that she named two actors who have carved their own, outspoken paths despite an industry that has wanted to box them in their entire careers. Portman and Johansson’s longevity isn’t just about talent, but smart career choices and standing up for what they believe in. (You’re not going to see Norwood suing Disney for pay she’s owed, which I’m sure is part of the appeal.)</p><p>What makes so many actors special – and stars – is their individuality, their uniqueness, that quality that no one else can bring to a role. Go to an audition and you’re likely to see a line-up of a similar types being cast. What is it that makes one person stand apart and win the role over hundreds of others? Talent, chemistry, how they fit into the existing cast all play a role but also that indefinable quality that is just “it.” We’re still teaching AI that humans only have five fingers, I don’t think we’re quite ready to pull off that nuance.</p></div>\n<p>\n\tAn <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3sVO_j4czYs&t=114s\" target=\"_blank\">early promo</a> from Particle6 for Norwood didn’t inspire much faith, either. One speaker referred to her as “like if a Sunday roast went to drama school and got BAFTA-optimized” – as if that were a good thing and as if and great actors are literal pieces of meat. Another person in the promo asked, “But can she cry on Graham Norton?” To which another talking head responded: “Of course she can. And it will be clipped, subtitled and monetized on TikTok by lunchtime.” Statements like this and the joy with which they’re expressed show not just a lack of understanding, but borderline disdain for the profession.</p>\n<p>\n\tI know not everyone’s journey is the same. But until an AI character endures living paycheck to paycheck, countless cattle calls, screaming directors and the constant battle with imposter syndrome, I’m not willing to call it an actor. Even giving a piece of art a name and gender and what I assume will be personality attributes (I dread the inevitable first “exclusive” interview with Norwood where she “breaks her silence” about this) is problematic to me. I’m not even going to get into how this AI was generated, as I assume it’s from composites of actual actors and people – possibly without their knowledge or consent.\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd considering how poorly Norwood’s creators have already read the landscape, I’m not feeling confident that their AI creation is going to pull off the nuance required to give her a lasting career.</p>\n<p>\n\t<iframe width=\"500\" height=\"281\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/3sVO_j4czYs?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\"></iframe></p>\n</div>"

For the star, the experience of sitting on the other side of the table offered a window into the wider state of global cinema.</p>\n<p>\n\t“I believe not only the Chinese market is facing challenges globally. I think it is a collective predicament,” Yao says, reflecting on the current state of the industry. “If the fortress of cinema cannot withstand the shock, no one in that castle can protect itself.”\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\tAs a juror, she was struck by young filmmakers seeking fresh cinematic languages. Citing Akinola Davies’ Nigerian film “My Father’s Shadow” – which <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/2025/film/global/pingyao-film-festival-2025-winners-1236534600/\">added Pingyao’s Roberto Rossellini Awards best director gong</a> to its Cannes special mention – and experiments with traditional Kodak stock while exploring dreamlike imagery, she says “the interesting dichotomy is that it was exploring a novel cinematic language.” \n</p>\n<p>\n\tYao, known for her razor-sharp performances and social activism, has carved a niche as both a box office draw and a producer with a conscience. Breaking out with the hit series “My Own Swordsman,” Yao transitioned seamlessly into film, headlining critical and commercial hits like “Caught in the Web” and “Lost, Found.” Behind the camera, she’s built a reputation for championing socially resonant stories under the Bad Rabbit Pictures banner, founded by Yao alongside cinematographer Cao Yu and producer Liu Hui, with projects that spotlight women’s perspectives and overlooked narratives.\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\t“In terms of their spiritual kernel or the core of the movie, they are always in coverage of humanity, among god on earth, human, the deities and the nature and involve elements of music and dancing,” she explains. “That is what drives me to trace the origin of our life.”</p>\n<p>\n\tHer recent productions include the arthouse titles Huo Meng’s “Living the Land,” which won best director at the Berlinale, and Rima Das’ Busan winner “Village Rockstars 2,” which are waiting for the right moment to reach Chinese audiences. “Given the difficult market we are facing, we are looking for better timing to bring such good arthouse films to the general public and the audience,” she says. “In recent years, the environment or the living space for arthouse films have been narrower and narrower. We are always in search of solutions to the problems one after another, so we have trained ourselves to be better problem solvers.”</p>\n<div><p>\n\tYao stressed that she wants to remain active both in front of and behind the camera. “Over the years, I have produced many films where I cannot act, but that is also one of my ways of expression,” she says. “For the next project I would look for a project where I can both produce and also help to create, so that I can be in better control of the quality of creation.” She adds with a laugh: “I hope I get to hang around in front of the lenses of the camera until I get totally aged.”</p></div>\n</div>"

    "body": "<div><p>\n\tIn January 2011, first-grade teacher Ellen Greenberg was found dead with 20 stab wounds in the kitchen of her Philadelphia apartment. After breaking down a latched door, Sam Goldberg, Greenberg’s fiancé, discovered her body with a 10-inch-long kitchen knife sticking out of her chest and stab wounds to the back of the head and her back.</p>\n<p>\n\tAt the scene, police surprised all of Greenberg’s family and friends when they ruled her death a suicide. After police removed her body, a professional cleaning company wiped down Greenberg’s kitchen.\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\tThen, just days later, during Greenberg’s funeral, the Philadelphia Medical Examiner’s Office ruled the case a homicide. Inexplicably, four months later, Greenberg’s cause of death was switched back to suicide. The city of Philadelphia closed the case without further investigation.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tGreenberg’s bizarre and tragic death is the subject of the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/abc-news-studios/\">ABC News Studios</a> docuseries “<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/death-in-apartment-603/\">Death in Apartment 603</a>: What Happened to Ellen Greenberg?” The three-part series, directed by Nancy Schwartzman, reexamines the grisly case and follows Ellen’s parents, Josh and Sandra Greenberg, who having never believed that their daughter killed herself, spent the last 14 years trying to discover what really happened.</p>\n<p>\n\tSchwartzman began filming the series in February, right after a civil lawsuit that the Greenbergs raised against the city of Philadelphia was settled with an agreement that the current medical examiner would reexamine the case. Philadelphia officials were ordered to complete their reinvestigation into the death of Ellen Greenberg by Oct. 14.\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\t“It was this perfect moment to get the cameras rolling on the story because there was momentum,” says Schwartzman. “There was legal action, which took forever, but suddenly, finally, all came together so that when we filmed, we had that in-the-moment, unfolding right now story coupled with who Ellen was, who her family was, and how all of this evidence came together.”</p>\n<p>\n\tFor the Josh and Sandra Greenberg, teaming with ABC News and Schwartzman meant a chance to bring more attention to the case and Ellen’s life.</p>\n<p>\n\t“We would love to have this documentary to help bring justice for Ellen,” Josh Greenberg says. “But the main part of this series is to talk about Ellen and how special she was.”</p>\n<p>\n\tSandra Greenberg adds, “We wanted the world to get to know us as a family. We wanted people to learn who Ellen was and what kind of person she was. She loved life.”</p>\n<p>\n\tIn addition to the Greenbergs, Schwartzman interviewed Ellen’s friends and extended family, Philadelphia Inquirer reporter Stephanie Farr, former Philadelphia police officers, a detective, and forensic pathologists Joseph Scott Morgan and Dr. Michelle Dupree, who noted that they had never heard of a case where someone stabs themselves in the back. The pathologists also discuss “textbook strangulation marks” on Greenberg’s neck as well as bruises in various stages of healing across her body.</p>\n<p>\n\t“There are no rumors, theories, and conspiracies (in this doc),” says Schwartzman. “Everything we (examine) in the series is public record and came through legal process and discovery. It raises a lot of questions. What we saw with our dive into the investigation is that there was obviously human error made.”</p>\n<p>\n\tThose human errors arguably include cleaning the kitchen where Greenberg died and Sam Goldberg’s uncle mysteriously taking Greenberg’s computer from her bedroom without permission after her death.</p>\n<p>\n\t“Basically, what we wanted to point out was this snowball effect,” Schwartzman says. “You have all of these grave errors, whether they are nefarious or not, that would be considered mistakes in any investigation, and then a lack of willingness to actually just come correct and say, ‘You know what. On that night, our beat cops made a mistake.'”</p>\n<p>\n\tWhile Goldberg did not participate in the series, his voice can be heard via a 911 call he made after discovering his fiancée’s bloody body. \n\t</p>\n<p>\n\t“She fell on a knife!,” Goldberg tells the 911 operator. “Her knife is sticking out. There’s a knife sticking out of her heart.”</p>\n<p>\n\tWhen the 911 operator says she’ll walk him through doing CPR, if he’s willing, Goldberg replies, “I have to, right?”</p>\n<p>\n\t“The man that was going to marry my daughter, have children with her –  when he is asked to do CPR  and says “I have to, right,” I couldn’t believe my ears,” says Sandra Greenfield.</p>\n<p>\n\tThe series also includes Governor Josh Shapiro’s voice via archival news footage. Shapiro inherited the case when he was the Attorney General of Pennsylvania. In 2019, his office reaffirmed its ruling of the case as a suicide.</p>\n<p>\n\tShapiro’s stance on the Greenberg case remains unchanged. “There’s nothing I wanted more than to give these parents some finality, some answer, some clarify and we received more evidence more information during the course of our investigation that sadly didn’t show what they wanted it to show, but actually rather pointed to more data more information that pointed toward a suicide,” Shapiro said at a press conference in February.</p>\n<p>\n\tSchwartzman reached out to Shapiro for an interview. He declined, as did Philadelphia’s Police Department, Medical Examiner’s office, Attorney General’s office, and the District Attorney’s office.  </p>\n<p>\n\t“I think this is where documentary films really shine because we do our best to hold those in power to account,” Schwartzman says.</p>\n<p>\n\t“Death in Apartment 603: What Happened to Ellen Greenberg?” is currently streaming on <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/hulu/\">Hulu</a>.</p>\n</div>"

A boat? More sneakers?”</p>\n<p>\n\tHe continued, “We can never again take seriously anything these comedians complain about (unless it’s complaining that we don’t support enough torture and mass executions of journalists and LGBQT peace activists here in the states, or that we don’t terrorize enough Americans by flying planes into our buildings).”\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\tCross went on to call out specific names from the lineup, including comedy giants <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/dave-chappelle/\">Dave Chappelle</a>, Louie CK and <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/bill-burr/\">Bill Burr</a>.</p>\n<p>\n\t“Clearly you guys don’t give a shit about what the rest of us think, but how can any of us take any of you seriously ever again?” Cross added. “All of your bitching about ‘cancel culture’ and ‘freedom of speech’ and all that shit? Done. You don’t get to talk about it ever again. By now we’ve all seen the contract you had to sign.”</p>\n<p>\n\tThe “Mr. Show” star<a href=\"https://variety.com/2025/politics/global/marc-maron-human-rights-riyadh-comedy-festival-1236530044/\" target=\"_blank\"> isn’t the first comedian to take issue</a> with the Riyadh Comedy Festival. Marc Maron recently took to his “WTF” podcast to slam those participating in the event.</p>\n<p>\n\t“I mean, how do you even promote that? ‘From the folks that brought you 9/11. Two weeks of laughter in the desert, don’t miss it!’” he said. “I mean, the same guy that’s gonna pay them is the same guy that paid that guy to bone-saw Jamal Khashoggi and put him in a fucking suitcase. But don’t let that stop the yucks, it’s gonna be a good time!”\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\tShane Gillis also disavowed the festival, saying on his “Secret Podcast” that he turned down an invitation and a “significant bag” for an appearance fee.</p>\n<p>\n\tHe said, “I took a principled stand. You don’t 9/11 your friends.”</p>\n<p>\n\tOther U.S. comedians set to appear at the Riyadh Comedy Festival include Kevin Hart, Pete Davidson, Russell Peters, Gabriel Iglesias, Wayne Brady, Jeff Ross, Tom Segura and Hannibal Buress.</p>\n</div>"

    "body": "<div><p>\n\tTaiwanese director Shen Ko-shang’s “<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/deep-quiet-room/\">Deep Quiet Room</a>” claimed the top honor at the 9th <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/pingyao-international-film-festival/\">Pingyao International Film Festival</a>, the Fei Mu Award for best film, along with a cash prize of RMB1 million ($137,000). </p>\n<p>\n\tHalf of the prize will support Shen’s next project, while the other half goes to the film’s Chinese distributor. The jury praised the film’s “solid narrative and incisive expression,” noting how “the director brilliantly controls the rhythm, and advances the story layer by layer until it reaches its profound core.”\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\tJoseph Chang took home the Fei Mu Award for best actor for his performance in “Deep Quiet Room,” portraying a husband navigating family trauma. The jury highlighted his “nuanced depiction” that “lays bare the character’s complex transformations at each stage.” The Fei Mu Awards, for emerging filmmakers making films in the Chinese language are disbursed to selections in the festival’s Hidden Dragons strand. \n</p>\n<p>\n\tZhang Zhongchen won best director in the Fei Mu Awards for “Nighttime Sounds,” with the jury noting his journey “from a guard in a film academy” to “self-taught director” who “composes a poem with his lens.”</p>\n<p>\n\tRanice Tay earned the best actress prize for her role in “Amoeba,” directed by Tan Siyou. The jury described her as embodying “a new generation caught in the turbulence of adolescence, where fear coexists with courage.” Tan’s film proved a festival favorite, collecting three awards total: best actress, the Youth Jury Award, and the Cinephilia Critics’ Award. The Youth Jury noted it presents “the perspective of the youth, through which we can both see their situation, and value their bold expressions.”\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\tLouis Vuitton, as a festival partner, presented jewelry and accessories boxes to the acting winners and Youth Jury Award recipient, “encouraging them to continue the spirit of Fei Mu’s artistic exploration.”</p>\n<p>\n\tIn the Roberto Rossellini Awards section for international films – the Crouching Tigers strand of the festival – Hasan Hadi’s “The President’s Cake” won best film, receiving $20,000. The jury called it “a brilliant if harrowing portrait” of two Iraqi children in the early 1990s navigating “the absurdity of political oppression and the numbing brutality of war.”</p>\n<p>\n\tAkinola Davies Jr. took the Rossellini best director prize for “My Father’s Shadow,” shot on 35mm film. The jury praised his “vibrant portrait of a Nigeria that is equally personal and political.” Yoon Ga-eun’s “The World of Love” received the Rossellini Jury Award for its exploration of sexual violence in a silent community.</p>\n<p>\n\tMiao Zhuangzhuang’s “Daughters” won both the Tong Ye Award and the Netpac Award for best first film. The filmmaker from Yangquan, Shanxi, received praise for creating “an intimate film that, in a quiet way, reveals deep inner conflicts and love within a family.”</p>\n<p>\n\tQi Yanyan’s documentary “The Toddling Youths” received the Fei Mu Jury Award. The jury noted that “through a panorama of settings and interactions, ‘The Toddling Youths’ captures the journeys and decisions of youth, and reveals vibrant characters of truth.”</p>\n<p>\n\tIn the short film categories, Chu Hoi Ying’s “After the Cat” won the Fei Mu Award for best short film, while Li Longjianhui’s “Quick Pause, Quick Breath” from the Central Academy of Drama took best student short Film. Special mentions went to Liu Canwen’s “I Wanna Fly” from Shanghai Vancouver Film School and Song Yibo’s “Downstream” from Beijing Film Academy.</p>\n<p>\n\tThe festival’s Pingyao Project Promotion section awarded development funds to emerging filmmakers. Wang Xiying and Wang Ruiyuan’s “The Songs We Never Sang” won the Creative Award and RMB150,000 ($21,000). Song Dongxu’s “Grassland Ska!” received the Humanism Award with RMB100,000 ($14,000), while An Jingyi’s “Good, Bye” took the Most Promising Award with RMB100,000 ($14,000).</p>\n<p>\n\tMomo Pictures sponsored a screenplay competition, with Memet Emetjan’s “The Flower Seller” winning the grand prize of RMB250,000 ($35,100). Five projects received Momo Sky Selection Prizes of RMB50,000 ($7,000) each: Ravine Yang’s “Girl Crush,” Qi Linlin’s “Take It Easy,” Ma Huaichang and Xu Xiao’s “The Killer Has No Weekend,” Guo Qianhui’s “Three-Life Stone,” and “The Flower Seller.”\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\tThe festival also presented lifetime achievement honors, including the Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon East-West Award to filmmaker Feng Xiaogang and script supervisor Teruyo Nogami, and the International Contribution to Chinese Cinema Award to Busan International Film Festival co-founder Kim Dong-ho.</p>\n<p>\n\t<strong>COMPLETE WINNER LIST:</strong></p>\n<p>\n\t<strong>Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon East-West Award</strong></p>\n<p>\n\tFeng Xiaogang<br />Teruyo Nogami</p>\n<p>\n\t<strong>International Contribution to Chinese Cinema Award</strong></p>\n<p>\n\tKim Dong-ho</p>\n<p>\n\t<strong>Fei Mu Awards</strong> (Hidden Dragons)</p>\n<p>\n\tBest Short Film: “After the Cat,” dir.
