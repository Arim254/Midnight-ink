She also revealed the new dates, which are set for Sept. 2026.\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\t“I want the fans and public to hear directly from me that, unfortunately, I will need to postpone my upcoming Las Vegas concerts,” she wrote. “As many of you know, I have been dealing with some health challenges, and my doctors tell me that I must have a few procedures. As I joked with them, it must be time for my 100,000-mile check-up, although it’s not the usual trip to see my plastic surgeon! In all seriousness, given this, I am not going to be able to rehearse and put together the show that I want you to see, and the show that you deserve to see. You pay good money to see me perform, and I want to be at my best for you.”\n</p>\n<p>\n\tParton did note that she doesn’t have any plans to retire and that she’s taking this as a sign that she needs to slow down. “While I’ll still be able to work on all of my projects from here in Nashville, I just need a little time to get show ready, as they say,” she continued. “And don’t worry about me quittin’ the business because God hasn’t said anything about stopping yet. But, I believe He is telling me to slow down right now so I can be ready for more big adventures with all of you. I love you and thank you for understanding.”\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\tIn June, Parton announced her six-show run at Caesars Palace in Vegas. Officially named “Dolly: Live in Las Vegas,” the residency was slated to take place from Dec. 4 through Dec. 13. It was promised to be a “hit-driven concert event” and marked Parton’s first string of shows since her “Pure & Simple” tour wrapped up in 2016.</p>\n<figure></figure>\n</div>"

Her long-awaited sophomore album, “<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/2025/music/album-reviews/cardi-b-am-i-the-drama-album-review-1236524658/\">Am I the Drama</a>,” has officially debuted at No. 1, earning 200,000 equivalent album units in the United States, according to Luminate.</p>\n<p>\n\tThe 24-track project racked up 146 million official streams in its first week and sold 88,000 units, boosted by a highly-active rollout that made the album available in a variety of formats. Fans could grab digital downloads, multiple vinyl pressings, and even cheeky “courtroom editions” that poked fun at Cardi’s recent meme-worthy court appearances. (She was found <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/2025/music/news/cardi-b-not-liable-million-assault-lawsuit-1236505438/\">not liable</a> in a highly publicized assault case.)\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\tNever one to play it safe, Cardi hit the ground running during and leading up to her release week: She appeared at indie record stores across the country and met fans, posing for viral pics, and signing albums. She was also interviewed on the “The Jennifer Hudson Show” and Alex Cooper’s “Call Her Daddy” podcast, among other press appearances. </p>\n<p>\n\tUpon its release in 2018, the Grammy-winning “Invasion of Privacy,” marked the biggest sales week for any R&B and hip-hop album that year. The set earned 255,000 equivalent album units in the week ending April 12, 2018. </p>\n<p>\n\tWith “Am I the Drama,” Cardi logs the biggest week for an R&B/hip-hop album by a woman this year. </p>\n<p>\n\tShe will soon take this success on the road for her first tour in six years — the “<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/2025/music/news/cardi-b-little-miss-drama-arena-tour-dates-1236520372/\">Little Miss Drama Tour</a>.” The 30+ date arena run will kick off on Wednesday, February 11 in Palm Desert, CA at Acrisure Arena and include stops across North America in Las Vegas, Los Angeles, Vancouver, Austin, Chicago, New York, Toronto, Philadelphia and more before wrapping up on Friday, April 17 in Atlanta, GA at State Farm Arena. </p>\n</div>"

    "body": "<div><p>\n\tCelebrities are the “hot ones,” but they’re giving the cold shoulder to traditional media, at least in podcast form.</p>\n<p>\n\tIn the shifting landscape of Hollywood publicity, a curious paradox has emerged: the most press-averse celebrities are suddenly embracing the very medium that demands the most intimate conversation. The traditional press junket, with its rowdy hotel suites and rotating carousel of journalists armed with the same five questions, is giving way to podcasters.\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\tStars like <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/leonardo-dicaprio/\">Leonardo DiCaprio</a>, who has spent decades perfecting the art of strategic media avoidance, recently settled into the surprisingly comfortable confines of Travis Kelce and Jason Kelce’s “<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AOHXxaah38o\" target=\"_blank\">New Heights</a>” podcast to discuss “One Battle After Another,” his $130 million Warner Bros. epic that struggled to find its footing at the box office this past weekend. For a full hour, the notoriously private actor shared anecdotes that would have been unthinkable in a traditional press setting, including the revelation that his childhood agent once suggested he rebrand himself as “<a href=\"https://variety.com/2025/film/news/leonardo-dicaprio-ex-agent-name-too-ethnic-lenny-williams-1236528713/\" target=\"_blank\">Lenny Williams</a>” because “Leonardo DiCaprio” was deemed “too ethnic.”\n</p>\n<p>\n\tSimilarly, and earlier this year, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/joaquin-phoenix/\">Joaquin Phoenix</a>, who has made his disdain for conventional press obligations abundantly clear, made his podcast debut on Theo Von’s show to promote Ari Aster’s “Eddington” — another hefty-budget gamble that failed to ignite opening weekend audiences. Phoenix’s appearance felt less like a promotional obligation and more like a genuine conversation, a stark contrast to his expressed hatred of “TV stuff.”\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\tThis migration to podcasts represents a significant media evolution and a strategic pivot toward demographics that studios desperately need to recapture. The young male audiences that populate the listener bases of these celebrity-hosted shows are the same moviegoers who have been steadily abandoning theaters. It’s a pattern that extends far beyond Hollywood — politicians and business figures have similarly embraced long-form podcast appearances, with figures like Joe Rogan playing increasingly influential roles in shaping public discourse and, arguably, electoral outcomes.</p>\n<p>\n\tYet this new landscape comes with its own complications. While podcasts offer the promise of more authentic conversation, they rarely deliver the journalistic rigor that traditional media aspires to maintain.</p>\n<p>\n\tThese aren’t adversarial interviews designed to challenge or probe; they’re largely collaborative exercises where celebrity guests are invited to be charming versions of themselves without significant pushback.</p>\n<p>\n\tThe appeal for notoriously private stars becomes clearer when considered against the backdrop of traditional celebrity media obligations. Beyoncé hasn’t granted a conventional interview in over a decade, not since releasing her self-titled album in 2013. Since then, her rare media appearances have been entirely on her terms — personal essays submitted to magazines or carefully curated profiles where her silence speaks louder than words.</p>\n<p>\n\t“F1” star Brad Pitt once articulated the fundamental tension: “There’s this whole other entity that you get sucked into. You have to go and sell your wares. It’s something I never made my peace with.”</p>\n<p>\n\tThis reluctance stands in stark contrast to performers who view publicity as integral to their craft. Jamie Lee Curtis has become legendary for her promotional enthusiasm, with many crediting her tireless advocacy as instrumental in “Everything Everywhere All at Once” securing seven Oscar wins, including her own supporting actress victory. It helped Pamela Anderson with her campaign last year for “The Last Showgirl” and had a great opening weekend for the sequel “Freakier Friday.”</p>\n<p>\n\t“I wish I had 10 Jamie Lee Curtis’s on every one of my films and titles,” an awards strategist tells <em>Variety</em>. “It would make my job, and yours, infinitely easier and even more enjoyable. There’s nothing like someone who gets it and is positive about it.”\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\tBut Curtis represents an increasingly rare breed in an industry where privacy has become both more precious and more impossible to maintain. As social media continues to erode the boundaries between public and private personas, the podcast format offers something unprecedented: the illusion of intimacy without the adversarial undertones of traditional journalism.</p>\n<p>\n\tThat doesn’t mean these big podcasters aren’t good at what they do. Sean Evans has built a recognizable brand with spicy talk series “Hot Ones,” and is constantly praised for his insightful and thought-provoking questions.</p>\n<p>\n\tThe success of celebrity podcast appearances like DiCaprio’s says that audiences are hungry for authentic connection with stars, even as those same stars become increasingly wary of traditional media exposure. It’s a delicate balance that speaks to larger questions about celebrity, privacy, and the evolving relationship between performers and their audiences.</p>\n<p>\n\tI think we’d like to see a world with both, right?</p>\n</div>"

The Oscar-winner returned to acting after an eight-year absence to star in the directorial debut of his son, Ronan.</p><p>“It’s a privilege beyond words to be here with everyone tonight,” Ronan Day-Lewis, who co-wrote the script with his dad, told the packed house at Lincoln Center’s Alice Tully Hall. “I’m at a loss for words.”\n</p></div>\n<p>\n\tSet in Northern England, “Anemone” follows Day-Lewis as Ray, a recluse and former British soldier who has been living in isolation in the woods for two decades. His life is upended when his brother, portrayed by Sean Bean, shows up and forces him to confront his mysterious past. Samantha Morton, Samuel Bottomley and Safia Oakley-Green, who weren’t in attendance at Sunday afternoon’s premiere, round out the cast.\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\tRonan Day-Lewis described a “very intuitive” working relationship with his father. “We fell into a rhythm early on,” Ronan told <em>Variety</em> on the red carpet. “It was a real sense of play and freedom.”</p>\n<p>\n\tDaniel Day-Lewis echoed his son’s sentiments, insisting the on-set collaboration between the two was familiar and easy. </p>\n<p>\n\t“Over the years since Ronan was very, very small, we’ve worked on a lot of different things together,” he told <em>Variety</em>. “There was always a great ease in each other’s company, and this was really an extension of that. It was just a bigger toy box to play in.” </p>\n<p>\n\t”Anemone” actually isn’t the first cinematic team-up between Daniel and Ronan, the younger Day-Lewis revealed from the stage after the screening. Growing up, Ronan said, “We made a fake Nike commercial starring my pet tortoise.”</p>\n<p>\n\tWhen it came to adding to their duo, both Day-Lewis men agreed that Bean was the only choice to play Ray’s estranged brother. Before filming, Bean was invited by Daniel Day-Lewis to Ireland, where the two bonded over “pints of Guinness and whiskey.”\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\t“It was a great way to explore a situation,” Bean said. “We got along very well and that was crucial to me to get into the story of two brothers.” </p>\n<p>\n\tPrior to “Anemone,” Daniel Day-Lewis had last appeared in Paul Thomas Anderson’s 2017 period drama “Phantom Thread,” for which he earned his sixth Oscar nomination. The actor, considered one of the best of his generation, has won three Academy Awards for 1989’s “My Left Foot,” 2007’s “There Will Be Blood” and 2012’s “Lincoln.” </p>\n<p>\n\tHe decided to return to Hollywood this time around because he wanted to work with his son. “I had some residual sadness because I knew Ronan was going to go on to make films, and I was walking away from that,” he <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.rollingstone.com/tv-movies/tv-movie-features/daniel-day-lewis-son-ronan-anemone-interview-1235420815/\">previously told Rolling Stone</a>. “I thought, ‘Wouldn’t it be lovely if we could do something together and find a way of maybe containing it, so it didn’t necessarily have to be something that required all the paraphernalia of a big production?'”</p>\n<p>\n\tDay-Lewis had retired from acting in the past. After starring in 1997’s sports drama “The Boxer,” he took an extended absence from the screen to become a shoemaker in Italy. He returned in Martin Scorsese’s 2002 crime epic “Gangs of New York” as Bill the Butcher.</p>\n<p>\n\t“Looking back on it now — I would have done well to just keep my mouth shut, for sure. It just seems like such grandiose gibberish to talk about. I never intended to retire, really,” he said in the Rolling Stone interview. “I just stopped doing that particular type of work so I could do some other work. Apparently, I’ve been accused of retiring twice now. I never meant to retire from anything! I just wanted to work on something else for a while.”</p>\n</div>"

    "body": "<div><p>\n\tGastón Solnicki’s latest film “The Souffler” is, like his previous work, entrancing and mercurial. There is a straightforward plot here (a hotel manager learns his place of employment will soon be no more), but the Argentine filmmaker uses such a threadbare storyline to string together a broader meditation about a changing world. Told through clipped vignettes around and about said hotelier and his staff, the collaboration between Solnicki and <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/willem-dafoe/\">Willem Dafoe</a> — a bleak, black comedy that’s impressionistic in style and substance — is an utter delight.\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\tWhen Lucius (Willem Dafoe) learns that the Intercontinental Hotel in Vienna he’s been managing for decades has been sold to an Argentinean (played by Solnicki) and will soon be redeveloped, he’s stunned, enraged and, the more he thinks about it, perhaps a tad melancholy. He understands deep down that the loss of the illustrious if rather run-down building is a symptom of something larger. The hotel — as a symbol of a city, a country, a continent even — risks being lost to oblivion. No more guests skating in its nearby rink. No more signature cocktails served at its lavish bar. No more soufflés making their way to those white-linen tables at its restaurant.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tThen again, if the soufflés coming out of the kitchen are any indication, the Vienna Intercontinental should really have its days numbered. As a metaphor for the decline of a decades-old hotel of this size, the dish is both blunt and poetic. The same goes for the snippets of routine Solnicki samples. Although Dafoe’s Lucius does end up waging a bit of a futile, farcical war against said foreign developer, “<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/the-souffleur/\">The Souffleur</a>” (co-written with Julia Niemann) is not really concerned with issues of plot and story. This is a film interested instead in details that capture the loss and loneliness Lucius cannot seem to escape.\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\tPortuguese cinematographer Rui Poças — who lensed films as disparate as “Grand Tour,” “Frankie,” “Zama” and “The Ornithologist”<em> </em>— creates textured, tender portraits of characters set against gorgeous vistas that crowd and expand them. Turning his keen eye on Dafoe and the Intercontinental Hotel with studied still frames, Poças encourages audiences to appreciate the spaces Lucius inhabits, whether he’s spraying water over the rink, sitting alone in the perfectly set restaurant or playing a game of chess with his daughter (Lilly Senn) on the rooftop. As the film unfolds, Lucius slowly begins to lose whatever footing he had in a hotel that seems to be falling into disarray faster than he can make an argument for its historical (let alone financial) value. </p>\n<p>\n\tBut while such a description would suggest Solnicki’s latest film is a languorous project about faded glory and the encroaching violence of global capitalist modernity, that is selling “The Souffleur” short — mostly because with Dafoe at the helm, the Vienna-set project has a wry sensibility throughout. The Hollywood actor’s devilish features and unmistakable crackling voice make for a pitch-perfect pair with Solnicki’s sardonic sensibility. Much as Wes Anderson and Yorgos Lanthimos have plumbed Dafoe’s deliciously wicked sense of humor in pieces that straddle the line between the real and the archly stylized, Solnicki understands that a strong Dafoe performance must always teeter between the two. And so, while his Lucius carries on his shoulders the responsibility to stand up to Solnicki’s Facundo, he’s also a character whose winking personality makes him wholly enjoyable to watch (and listen to) throughout. A late scene where he takes utter delight in messing up the hotel’s electricity and lighting is but one example of how hilariously petty he makes this weathered hotel manager without ever making him a maudlin fool.</p>\n<p>\n\tDafoe, who’d been itching to work with the Argentine filmmaker for quite some time, clearly relished the chance to make this collaboration a fruitful one. Their scenes together, where Lucius and Facundo fail to talk to one another (as the former doesn’t speak Spanish and the latter knows no English) are some of the funniest in the film. They’re proof positive the two accomplished a rare kind of alchemy here, speaking across cultures and languages to create a character study that’s more and more unique the more it gets away from language and story. \n\t</p>\n<p>\n\t“The Souffleur” reflects Solnicki at his most accomplished. This is a film that further establishes him as a filmmaking voice unlike any other. “I don’t like order; I don’t like disorder,” Lucius says during one of the film’s many voiceovers. “I like a combination of the two.” He may as well be describing Solnicki’s approach. </p>\n<p>\n\tThe vignettes that make up the film feel at once painstakingly organized and quite improvisational in spirit. There’s an instinctual stitching that binds its many scenes together that build to a heartwrenching ending, culminating in neither a whimper nor a bang but a welcome sigh of relief. Solnicki has created a sly and slippery kind of film that, much like its leading actor’s grin, is hilarious and devastating in equal measure.</p>\n</div>"

    "body": "<div><p>\n\tIn “<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/anemone/\">Anemone</a>,” which marks the return of <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/daniel-day-lewis/\">Daniel Day-Lewis</a> to the big screen after <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/2017/film/columns/daniel-day-lewis-retiring-1202477843/\">his retirement </a>eight years ago (he needn’t be ashamed of reneging on that — it just places him in the category of rock stars like David Bowie), the fabled 68-year-old actor plays a grizzled hermit with a silver-gray buzzcut and a handlebar mustache who lives in a cabin in the woods in Northern England. The character’s name is Ray, and he’s lugging around a couple of Big Secrets — though as the film starts to shade in his identity, you may think his principal secret is that in a past life he was at the center of a middling ’90s art-house film produced by Miramax.\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\t“Anemone” — we’ll get to that title in a moment, but for now just know that it’s pronounced <em>uh-NEM-uh-nee — </em>is not a movie with a lot of dialogue, but over time Ray reveals himself in several extended monologues. The first of these is, quite simply, so <em>gross</em> that you can’t quite fathom what you’re hearing. Ray is telling the story of how he took revenge on the priest who molested him when he was growing up. Ray describes how he later had an encounter with the priest in which he pretended to come on to him, then had the priest lay down, face up, on the floor. Earlier that day, Ray had imbibed a special regimen of food and Guinness that would leave his bowels in a very active state; by the time he saw the priest, they were rumbling with need. And that’s when he took down his trousers, crouched over the priest’s face, and…let loose. Trust me, I’m describing this far more abstractly than Ray does, and Day-Lewis, his face rippled with a grin of malice, digs with hideous relish into the scatological description of what went down.\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\tThey used to say that Laurence Olivier was such a great actor that he could read the phone book and leave you entranced. But I’m not sure that even Laurence Olivier could deliver this speech in “Anemone” and make you want to listen to it. Daniel Day-Lewis certainly can’t (though he, for one, seems to be enjoying himself).</p>\n<p>\n\t“Anemone” includes several settings and a handful of austerely aesthetic woodland images, but the movie is basically a two-hander set in and around Ray’s cabin. His brother, Jem (Sean Bean), has shown up to reconnect, and for a long time these two sit around not saying very much, pouring drinks and scowling at each other, at one point getting their ya-yas out with a midnight rock ‘n’ roll dance, then scowling some more.</p>\n<p>\n\tDay-Lewis doesn’t have to remind us of what a brilliant actor he is (whenever he talks, we’re hanging on each word). Yet over the course of his screen career, which encompassed just 21 movies, he gave performances that were startling and for the ages (“My Left Foot,” “The Unbearable Lightness of Being,” “There Will Be Blood,” “Lincoln,” “The Last of the Mohicans”), and he also gave performances that were fine in a prosaic way and not especially memorable (“The Boxer,” “The Ballad of Jack and Rose”). This is one of those. It is, in the end, a rather recessive role, and maybe that’s because on some level Day-Lewis doesn’t want his comeback to overshadow the movie itself. He wants “Anemone” to be all about his son, 27-year-old Ronan Day-Lewis, who directed the film and co-wrote it with his father.</p>\n<p>\n\tI think it’s touching that Daniel Day-Lewis came out of retirement to launch his son’s movie career. That’s a dad for you! And I have no problem with the nepo babyness of it all. But “Anemone” is still a dud of a movie — aridly pretentious and static, with too much self-conscious art photography and gloomsday indie rock and not enough drama. The film is driven by “themes” that feel weirdly cherry-picked from other movies: child sexual abuse within the Catholic Church (a topic that’s raised by Ray’s monologue…and never mentioned at any other point in the film); the trouble with the Troubles. It’s all wrapped around a domestic saga that’s supposed to give the movie heart but remains detached and unconvincing, as we learn that Jem and his partner, Nessa (Samantha Morton), have raised a son, Brian (Samuel Bottomley), who’s closer to Ray than we think. The fact that both of them like to fight so much is our first clue.\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\tThere are flashes of talent in “Anemone.” Ronan Day-Lewis, who has come up in the world as a visual artist, knows how to frame a shot, and he’s canny about playing off the mystique of his father. The whole plot, with Jem entreating Ray to come out of his self-imposed exile, is almost a sly metaphor for how Daniel Day-Lewis would take a sabbatical from acting to become a cobbler or cabinet maker, or for his retirement now. Yet for most of its 125-minute running time, “Anemone” just sits there.</p>\n<p>\n\tThere’s another monologue, and this one, unlike the priest crap-a-thon, explains a lot, as Day-Lewis delivers it with a measured anguish. Ray, it seems, was a soldier in the British army, and one night he was ordered to patrol a house that the IRA was planning to attack. A bomb went off, destroying the people inside — or nearly so, as one young man lay nearly dead, his guts hanging out. Ray, in that moment, made a decision he thought was humane (and we in the audience would tend to agree). But he was accused of a war crime. This strikes us as an injustice — but just as much, it strikes us as puzzling. Why, in the middle of the Troubles, would <em>this</em> be a war crime? In the midst of the chaos and death of the bombing, how would anyone even know about it?</p>\n<p>\n\tThe anemone, incidentally, is a flower, and in the movie’s grand scheme it means…something meaningful (about loss and new beginnings). As does everything else in “Anemone.” As you watch the film, though, it’s amazing how things that should mean a lot could come to so little, including the return of Daniel Day-Lewis.</p>\n</div>"

    "body": "<div><p>\n\tThere is a mild buzz outside the open door of <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/amanda-shires/\">Amanda Shires</a>’ dressing room backstage at the Grand Ole Opry House. “Sorry, there’s a tour going on out there,” she says, looking over a visitor’s shoulder at the gaggle, “and they’re gonna probably ask to peek in.” She’s leaving her door open for producers to come find her as she prepares to rehearse for what will be the public premiere of her new single, “A Way It Goes,” on this Saturday evening. It’s not necessarily what you’d immediately identify as a country song, per se, but the Opry does love a woman who can play a mean fiddle, as Shires does, when she is not strictly focused on belting out some of the most bracingly confessional songs being written in any American genre.\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\tSpeaking of asking to peek in: that’s why we’re here, too. Not to get a gander at the portraits of all the bygone country legends on the dressing room walls, but to get a better picture of the feelings that drove Shires to make a transfixing new album, “Nobody’s Girl,” that has been a subject of great curiosity ever since she announced it, or even before. The Texas-bred, Nashville-based singer-songwriter has always written from the heart, without stinting on the rough stuff, as was evident from her previous record, 2022’s critically acclaimed “Take It Like a Man.” That previous record was produced by <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/lawrence-rothman/\">Lawrence Rothman</a> and featured guest appearances from <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/jason-isbell/\">Jason Isbell</a>, but only Rothman is returning for “Nobody’s Girl,” since Isbell filed for divorce proceedings at the end of 2023. For the almost two years since, fans have been on pins and needles to hear how Shires would use her next album to express what her life has been like.\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\tIt’s definitely not a cover-up. (Yes, there’s an allusion there that’s intentional.) But neither is it a tell-all. A few of the tracks get into the nitty-gritty of what went wrong in that very public union, where Shires was half of one of America’s most celebrated musical couples. In “A Way It Goes,” she expresses her ambivalence about dwelling on the pain of that split in her music — but she does also have a song on the album called “The Details,” which does spill some. In all, anyway, “Nobody’s Girl” is mostly about the ruggedness and tenderness of a path back to independence, for someone who feels she surrendered some of that along the way. She won’t balk if you call it a divorce album (or at least won’t if her pal Shooter Jennings candidly calls it that). But a reclamation album is better, whether or not the critics really keep a category title handy for that.</p>\n<p>\n\tIt was important to Shires to air out the mess while also exercising some restraint, on the record. As she must now in life, as she deals with a habit she’s needed to kick. “Would you believe I haven’t vaped in nine days?” she asks. “I was all-out vaping. I was in front of everybody vaping. I’d vape on stage; I didn’t care. But now I’m a nine-day not-vapor.” How is that going? “It’s all right. I’m doing chewing gum, but I’d rather be vaping. Sometimes I just go outside and look at big clouds, for inspiration, or to feel like I’m chuffing.”</p>\n<p>\n\tDid we mention that Shires is one of the more naturally funny interviewees you’ll run into? Thankfully, she’s good with gallows humor, too, which might be part of what got her through the trauma of the last two years, though you won’t hear a lot of dark yuks on “Nobody’s Girl” itself. It doesn’t stint on the gravity of a journey that, to her, has felt “longer than the Holland Tunnel” in a bad rush hour.</p>\n<p>\n\tGiven that most of the audience out there at the Opry House is not hers, will they have the slightest idea that they are hearing a woman spill her guts on a crucial personal subject for the first time? Not likely. Nonetheless, if nothing else, she is going to dazzle them with the “big-ass dress” she’s about to put on, figuring that the Opry, in its 100<sup>th</sup> anniversary year, deserves no less of a sartorial effort from her. Meanwhile, “Nobody’s Girl” — which just came out this weekend — is beautiful and jolting enough to deserve nothing less than our full attention. (The following Q&A has been edited for length and clarity.)\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\t<strong>It’s a very forthright album. People who know your work wouldn’t expect anything less from you. But when you were writing for it, did you have to kind of measure along the way, “How much do I want reveal to people?”</strong></p>\n<p>\n\tI used music more to get me through this hard time than I’ve ever used it in my life, to work myself and walk myself through the emotional turmoil and “what is my life?” and the transitions that have been befalling me. I don’t think that those things need to be decided before you are doing music, if you’re doing it for self-care and for your mental health. The decisions come later when you decide if you’re gonna record it or if you’re gonna keep the song in the end. I think I wrote 30-something songs for this, and some of them Lawrence didn’t even hear, just to work through it on my own. Because that’s how I taught myself to work through the big feelings and the sadness and the bitterness and the anger. But you don’t want to put bitter and angry songs on records, because that’s not helping anybody. And then in the end you decide, what is the story that you feel comfortable telling? Or that you feel comfortable with your child reading later? You know, I never want to cause harm at all. But I also don’t want to not have my opportunity to be true to myself. And that’s how I decided which songs made the collection in the end.</p>\n<p>\n\t<strong>You started recording a followup to “Take It Like a Man” in Nashville before the divorce happened, and then you and your producer reconvened in L.A. to start again. Because of the tumult in your life, were there, like, two different versions of the album you were making?</strong></p>\n<p>\n\tWhat I was working on a couple years ago, most of that’s on a different hard drive. There’s not a lot left from that Nashville session. “The Details,” which is on this album, started out as a different song, and I kept some of that track from the Nashville session, but I rewrote all the words. “Can’t Hold Your Breath,” the climate change song, is from the Nashville sessions, at least the vocal take. But everything else — yeah, I had a different record, and then my life got turned upside down, so I started from there.</p>\n<p>\n\tI’ll be honest with you, I tried to skip all of that [making a record with songs about the split], because I wanted to just go to the part where I get to feeling better about life. And then Shooter (Jennings) said, “You can’t just skip all this!  — as your divorce record consultant.” I was like, “It’s not really a divorce record.” Or maybe it is. But he said, “You can’t just skip all that, because then it’s not acknowledging all the (hard parts).” Which is true. I was gonna go one way, and Lawrence wanted me to go this way, and I was being stubborn. And then Shooter was the tiebreaker — not the tie-breaker, maybe, but the voice of reason that somehow got in there. And I listened.\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\tI was thinking: “I don’t know if I want to sing that every day.” And then I decided: yes, I wouldn’t mind singing this group of songs every day. I had gotten to a place where I felt comfortable with my new life and wanted to talk about that, but the truth is, is in the middle of it all, I truly wasn’t over it yet, and I was trying to force myself into a head space before I was ready. I kept telling myself everything was fine … as one does. I was telling myself that I was healed, when I wasn’t.</p>\n<div>\n<figure>\n<p><img srcset=\"https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/LOOK_6_Brett_Warren.jpg 5504w, https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/LOOK_6_Brett_Warren.jpg?resize=100,150 100w, https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/LOOK_6_Brett_Warren.jpg?resize=200,300 200w\" src=\"https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/LOOK_6_Brett_Warren.jpg?w=683\" alt=\"\" />\n\t</p>\n<figcaption>\n\t\t\t\t\t<span>Amanda Shires</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tBrett Warren\n\t</figcaption>\n</figure>\n</div>\n<p>\n\t<strong>The irony is that you need other voices to sound off of when you’re writing about being alone, isn’t it?</strong></p>\n<p>\n\tThese came after me kicking and bucking about how I’d thought I’d written enough songs. Lawrence saying, “It’s not about that. It’s about writing your way through it, like you always do.” In the ways we know each other as friends, Lawrence could tell that there was still stuff to get off the old chest, whether it got recorded or not. So we sat down and started experimenting with sound to see what would happen, and “A Way It Goes” came out of that, and then that one turned out to be one that I felt was important and necessary to the collection. Luckily, we all ended up feeling the same way. Otherwise, we would’ve had to get to wrestling, and I would’ve won, because I have more muscles than Lawrence. I could break Lawrence in half.</p>\n<p>\n\tIt’s part of the nature of getting through something difficult is that you have to just say it over and over, and then as you work on it daily and start taking out your feelings at the gym. and with your pastor, then you start feeling better. And, you know, making new friends, joining backgammon leagues, all these things are helpful.</p>\n<p>\n\t<strong>Backgammon was a part of your healing process?</strong></p>\n<p>\n\tDo you play?</p>\n<p>\n\t<strong>No.</strong></p>\n<p>\n\tDammit. I’ve been playing for over a year now. I recommend it. I’ve discovered that more people play backgammon that I know than I realize. My piano player of 10 years, Peter; Dominic, who played bass on this record, from Jack White’s band; Jimbo Hart [the former bassist for the 400 Unit, now in Shires’ band], this whole time I’ve known this man, he plays backgammon. It’s more fun to me than chess, because you kind of memorize things in chess, and in this one, there’s too many variables that could happen in the way the dice just fall for you that day. It teaches you a lot about yourself. I like doing Texas Hold ‘Em and playing card games for money, too. But in this game, you have to learn how to go to war and hit people that you’re friends with. And I was very uncomfortable with that at first. You know, it’s not just a game to me.\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\t<strong>Here’s hoping for a backgammon song on the next record. Going back to “A Way It Goes,” you start the record right off talking about what you’ve been through recently and what people want to know from you.</strong></p>\n<p>\n\tYeah, why not address the elephant in the room? That song is one of the last ones I wrote for the record, because that is the contention I was having, and I was thinking I would rather people see me as I normally am, or healthy. But the truth is that life is hard, and I’ve never shied away from showing the hard bits. And I think a lot of people are going through it right now, anyway, so I addressed that in the first song. And by the time we get to the third verse… going further on into the journey of it, you realize that it’s a death of a <em>time</em>, but it’s not the death of <em>you</em>. And you do heal, and you do grow, so I even surprised myself.</p>\n<p>\n\tI wrote the song because I really couldn’t believe it when I felt my heart feeling hope or joy. And it’s not like I can’t always find joy in little things. But it does surprise you when you’re going through something where you feel clouds and darkness to, suddenly, you might have a shred of hope and possibility again, or a rumor or whisper of it. But when you’re in that tunnel, it’s a long one. Longer than the Holland Tunnel on peak traffic day.</p>\n<figure><p>\n<iframe width=\"500\" height=\"375\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/2GmoXcuBETU?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\"></iframe>\n</p></figure>\n<p>\n\t<strong>You’ve mentioned that heartbreak takes on a lot of different moods and forms on this album. You can address a painful situation head on and still have a lot of variation on what that feels like on a given day. And anybody who’s gone through a divorce has probably felt about 50 different things.</strong></p>\n<p>\n\tOh, 500 million of ‘em. And then you find yourself again and your identity again, not the same as you were before, but a different version. And you find yourself reclaiming lots of things along the way. …. But I’ve found reclamation in a lot of spots where I didn’t know that I had compromised little things along the way. And that’s pretty nice… and scary at the same time. Well, it was scary at first. That Taylor Swift song, “crying at the gym” [“Down Bad”], is real. That really happens. [Laughs.]</p>\n<p>\n\t<strong>No one who sees your arms when you play the violin on stage will probably be surprised that you work out.</strong>\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\tWell, you’ve gotta have a place to exert some physical energy. Not only is it good for your endorphins and your serotonin levels, but staying active keeps you from just doing what I did for weeks, which was cover up all the mirrors, lay on the damn bed and eat golden double-stuffed Oreos. Like, sleeves of them — I mean, that was my sustenance for a long time. I was just trying to douse myself in that golden goodness, and I wound up putting on 20 pounds. And that was fine. I didn’t care. I had leggings, it was winter. [Laughs.]</p>\n<p>\n\tTo be physically strong and mentally strong, they kinda work together. And if I can get through that, then I can also quit vaping. Can’t do it all at once, though. You’re just asking for it: <em>What’s left?</em></p>\n<figure><p>\n<iframe width=\"500\" height=\"281\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/Xxm7mgSgV0Q?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\"></iframe>\n</p></figure>\n<p>\n\t<strong>It seemed like you were backing off social media during and after that rough time.</strong></p>\n<p>\n\tI didn’t really have room for thinking about it. I would sometimes get on it and see if I could find some kind of levity. But I mostly just painted and worked with my backgammon coach, worked out, did everything you do. Do laundry and make sure the homework got done and school lunches, and be strong for my daughter. Sometimes cry in the pantry when nobody was looking. But I made some new friends, and that always helps, because it’s part of it too — in this business, people kind of choose sides.</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd during that time, I thought, “What am I gonna say that’s gonna spread any kind of joy in the world, at the moment?” Whining’s not becoming, either. Also, being the default parent is a whole other ball on its own of things to accomplish and priorities.</p>\n<p>\n\t<strong>The last we saw you before any of this in L.A. was at a premiere at the Grammy Museum for the HBO documentary you co-starred in with Jason [“<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/jason-isbell-running-with-our-eyes-closed/\">Jason Isbell: Running With Our Eyes Closed</a>”].</strong></p>\n<p>\n\tAnd I went along with that. That’s fine. Oh well!</p>\n<p>\n\t<strong>If you had it all to do over again, would you not film that documentary?</strong></p>\n<p>\n\tNo, because we all make choices and decide things and we’re doing it for our family and all this kind of stuff. That’s where I was then. To do it all over again, I would ask (director) Sam Jones to recut that wine shot, where we were celebrating Dave Cobb’s anniversary or something. Everybody says I showed up drinking wine. They paint me to be some kind of lush, when really I’m just celebrating like the rest of them. We’re celebrating Jesus’ first miracle, too! That’s all I would do, have him recut that part, because things get taken out of context, I guess as they have to be, to make better documentaries. But it’s all water up under the bridge.\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\t<strong>Your fans relate to you personally so much, and feel they have a stake in your life… and not just you as an individual but the solidity of the relationship they think they’re seeing. And so when all this stuff happens, fans of one or both of you are thinking, “Where do I place those feelings, where I thought everything was this one way?”</strong></p>\n<p>\n\tAnd I thought it was too, guys, I’ll tell you. But life is a funny thing. The best way to be, I guess, is flexible. Yeah, I thought it was that way, too. But it’s a mystery.</p>\n<div>\n<figure>\n<p><img srcset=\"https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/jason-amanda-P1380776.jpg 5184w, https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/jason-amanda-P1380776.jpg?resize=150,113 150w, https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/jason-amanda-P1380776.jpg?resize=300,225 300w\" src=\"https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/jason-amanda-P1380776.jpg?w=1024\" alt=\"\" />\n\t</p>\n<figcaption>\n\t\t\t\t\t<span>Jason Isbell and Amanda Shires at the Grammy Museum</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tVariety\n\t</figcaption>\n</figure>\n</div>\n<p>\n\t<strong>So, we just have to ask: Did you listen to Jason’s new record (“Foxes in the Snow,” released earlier this year, which also includes songs about the divorce)?</strong></p>\n<p>\n\tUm, I thought that… I did. I listened to it. I think I listened to all of it. I did.</p>\n<p>\n\tIt was during that time, though, that I was listening to Jack White’s record, “No Name,” which I was playing mostly on repeat the whole time. That Jack White record got me through this. Because it had my feelings of angst and drive and everything that I needed to cope. He has that song “That’s How I’m Feeling Right Now.” It’s like my anthem, and then I’m bombing out. [She sings Jack White’s guitar lick out loud.] So good! If I was gonna make a divorce recommendation playlist, that whole record would definitely be a part of it. Or any hardship, you know, any kind of grief — a death of whatever.</p>\n<p>\n\t<strong>Just one last question about a specific lyric…</strong></p>\n<p>\n\tYou can ask me whatever you want. I’ll tell you. I always do, for better or worse.</p>\n<p>\n\t<strong>“The Details” is probably the most pointed song on the album. [Sample lyrics: “</strong><strong>I got him help, and then he bailed</strong><strong> / What were all those promises for? / Cover me up, nothing’s ever enough / Gonna have to put the house up for sale / He scared me then, he still scares me now / Never will hear me out / The thing is he justifies it, using me / And cashing in on our marriage.”] You’re saying there that the marriage was </strong><strong>commoditized.</strong></p>\n<p>\n\tWell, do you think it was?</p>\n<p>\n\t<strong>Well, that wouldn’t be for me to judge. As an outsider, some of us like confessional-seeming songs, and it’s not always easy to make a distinction between somebody just revealing their life versus creating an image.</strong>\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\tAs a person who helped build all that, it’s an odd thing… I mean, we always had this thing where you write the song about whatever, when we both are songwriters. But there was a leaning on that. You know, I didn’t feel it as pressure. But we were building that and building a future and building for our family, and then now there’s not that. So, yeah, I do think there’s that (element) mixed with the songwriting. Because, you know, sometimes you just write a song, but yeah, definitely, I think there was an image filter on that.</p>\n<p>\n\t<strong>You do actually quote the title “Cover Me Up” in there.</strong></p>\n<p>\n\tI do, don’t I? I did put that in there… What can you do?</p>\n<p>\n\t<strong>You do have a couple of songs on the album that are outliers, in that they are about other situations, and not necessarily as heavy — like “Friend Zone,” which is about at least considering dating, but being thwarted in that by a one-sided attraction.</strong></p>\n<p>\n\tLike, I haven’t dated since anybody in a hundred thousand years… But you think you might have a crush on somebody and then they put you in the friend zone, but then in hindsight you’re glad that you’re just friends with people. But also, yeah, it felt like it needed just a little bit of lightness in there.</p>\n<p>\n\t<strong>Your friend and Highwomen cohort Maren Morris had an album out earlier this year that seemed like a mixture of divorce songs and then songs about getting back on the dating circuit.</strong></p>\n<p>\n\tI haven’t really done that. I’ve been on, like, two dates, but I wasn’t ready. I want to be a whole person before I venture into those territories. I don’t want to take any of my dirty laundry and unsorted baggage with me; I want to have it sorted.</p>\n<p>\n\t<strong>Regardless of whether you’re on social media much or not, you must be aware that you have a lot of guy fans out there who are saying, hopefully jokingly, “OK, now I’ve got a shot.”</strong></p>\n<p>\n\tYou do not want this shot with this person that likes to spend a lot of time alone, and with inanimate objects, and watch Westerns over and over. Or maybe you do. If you like gardening, if you like Westerns, if you like helping with home repair, by all means, step up. I need help! I do not know how to fix the dishwasher.</p>\n<p>\n\t<strong>You mentioned earlier that you were thinking about your daughter hearing the record, now or later, in deciding how candid to be with the songs you were putting on it.</strong>\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\tIt doesn’t mean I’m censoring my art for that, though, I just want to to be mindful and aware best I can. I know I can’t do it perfectly, but I don’t wanna run into anything that I wouldn’t be able to talk to her about, or that would make her life harder than it needs to be. But also, at the same time, I’ve got about 50 listeners, so she won’t have to be asked too much about what I said on my record, you know?  But it’s not like we’re writing about murder or something crazy. It’s like I told her: It’s our feelings and they rhyme, and if she has questions, she can ask me.</p>\n<p>\n\tBut I’m not gonna get on there and say, “You old son of a bitch!” That would be rude. I might say that at the <em>gym</em>, when I’m trying to deadlift. But I could be talking to my trainer.</p>\n<p>\n\t<strong>You walk some fine lines really nicely with this record, and maybe it’s the way the song selection turned out, but it’s not a super angry record, per se. But you do have your moments where you have your back up.</strong></p>\n<p>\n\tI appreciate you for noticing that. Yeah, I think tact is a good thing. But I’ve never been good at just holding my tongue completely. I can sort of put it half in, like some kind of stoned cat.</p>\n<p>\n\t<strong>In the very last lines of the last song on the album (“Not Feeling Anything”), you have a beautiful image of natural beauty you are taking in as you reestablish your independence: “Come in when I want / Take long, long walks / A moon-sized moonflower reminds me where I stopped.” Is than just a random observation or an important symbol to you?</strong></p>\n<p>\n\tIt’s an important symbol. They bloom at night and they open at night for various pollinators that do night work. They smell really, really good, and then they close in the morning, kind of like the opposite of a morning glory. It gets really hot in Tennessee. Nobody has any business being out there gardening in the daytime. I like to garden in the evening times, like dusk and onward, because I’m not an idiot. And I also have high blood pressure, and when you mix that and sunshine, it’s a bad combination. So I garden at night, which is also nice because it’s quiet and you don’t have to send emails and bedtime has happened and you have the time to yourself. And the way those big old things are bursting open, it’s really beautiful, because you can see ‘em in the dark.\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\t<strong>That resonates with your spirit somehow.</strong></p>\n<p>\n\tYeah, it does. I always feel like plants and gardening keeps me close to my dad and my grandparents. [Shires’ father passed away shortly after this interview was conducted.] It keeps me centered. I think you learn your center early on as a kid, and so much of what we’re doing on this planet is exactly what the plants are doing: growing through the weather and all the stages, and then making it through things like early frosts and winds and rains. To me, it’s mimetic of what we’re doing here. Except for the part where our country’s a shambles, because…  well, let’s not go on that tangent.</p>\n<div>\n<figure>\n<p><img srcset=\"https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Amanda-Shires-Nobodys-Girl-album-cover-2.jpg 3600w, https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Amanda-Shires-Nobodys-Girl-album-cover-2.jpg?resize=150,150 150w, https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Amanda-Shires-Nobodys-Girl-album-cover-2.jpg?resize=300,300 300w\" src=\"https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Amanda-Shires-Nobodys-Girl-album-cover-2.jpg?w=1024\" alt=\"\" />\n\t</p>\n<figcaption>\n\t</figcaption>\n</figure>\n</div>\n<p>\n\t<strong>The title of that final song, “Not Feeling Anything,” has you ending on neither a note of devastation nor joy, but acceptance.</strong></p>\n<p>\n\tYeah, I think that you get to a place where it feels OK to not feel so up and down, and where you can think and talk about it more easily. It’s still kind of hard to talk about because unless you’ve had a marriage and a divorce, it’s hard to find common language with folks. But for myself, I also think about it in the way that a record ends: I listen to records on loop, and I like to make sure it would sound right going into the loop again. And I don’t know if that’s a musical preference or my own neuroses. But it can be a good thing when you’re not feeling anything. Your feeling numb is a way better feeling than feeling all the other things, like self-loathing or confusion or lost, or “who am I?”</p>\n<p>\n\tI think, for me, when I quit feeling those huge, enormous feelings, I was able to get back to “what am I doing?” You can do more when you’re not feeling anything extreme; you can feel closer to your own center, again, after the big feelings had seemed to take over. It’s then that you can feel like you’re on the road to something. When I got to that point, I started identifying the things that I still had and the things that I had more of now. In my reclamation of things, I pulled them all in and started counting them. Much like a dragon does with treasure.</p>\n<p>\n\t<strong>Some people would hear a description that sounds like numbness and, because of how people with artistic temperaments are trained to value emotions, could be thinking “Not Feeling Anything” sounds like you’re describing a bad thing. But it’s a place of being more objective, isn’t it?</strong>\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\tExactly. Think a little clearer. Make better decisions. Control your limbs. [Laughs.]</p>\n<p>\n\t<strong>It sounds like you’re in a good place.</strong></p>\n<p>\n\tYeah. I made a list. I keep this list going of things that I reclaimed. It’s not a bad list. I like to look at it every once in a while (and think), “Good job, Shires.” Because it’s so many parts of your identity that may not seem big, but they make up big pieces of you. And you don’t know that until you’re back to only yourself in the room. It’s hard to explain how you become a different identity when you’re a married person, an identity of two. orhowever many.</p>\n<p>\n\t[She pulls out her phone to read off the list she’s been compiling.] <em>“Ireclaim my time and how I choose to spend it. My name no longer an extension of someone else’s. My space, my voice, my body, every room I enter, every word I speak, every way I move and rest and live.”</em> That’s true. <em>“Reclaim my choices, every small decision, every leap without apology. Reclaim my quiet, the right to be still, to be unseen, to belong to myself, in my little chaos. My order, my future, my joy and my loyalty. Keeping it for those who deserve it, starting with myself. Reclaim the silence they mistook for surrender, the tenderness they mistook for weakness and the fire they thought they could extinguish.”</em></p>\n<p>\n\tI’m gonna keep adding to that. It has a lot of “I’s” in it. [Laughs.] I’m already self-editing… Too many “I” statements.</p>\n</div>"
