The album arrived after its promised release time of midnight, appearing first on <a href=\"https://music.youtube.com/playlist?list=OLAK5uy_nw1x_-4T3M8EcDwtVFko4s488OKq9oSK0\" target=\"_blank\">YouTube Music</a> before hitting other streaming services. On Instagram, Bieber addressed the delays in a series of posts, stating, “I’m sorry for the wait their telling me any second” and “Me waiting with u, not baiting u not sure wut the fuckkyyy is going on clicking refreshhhhhh.”\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\t“Swag II” was teased early Thursday morning with billboards popping up in London and banners appearing in West Hollywood, much like he had done with the grassroots advertising of the album’s predecessor. He confirmed the album’s imminent arrival on Instagram, stating that the record would drop at midnight.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tBieber has been posting photos from the studio over the past month or so, suggesting that he was hard at work on another project. He’d done the same with “Swag,” teasing that new music was potentially on the way. Hits Daily Double previously reported that “Swag” was a precursor to a second, more pop-oriented album expected to be released later this year. Presumably, “Swag II” is the record in question, serviced as an addendum to “Swag” and upping the total track count to 44 songs.</p>\n<p>\n\tThe first “Swag” clocked in at 21 tracks and featured guest appearances from Gunna, Sexyy Red, Druski, Dijon, Lil B, Cash Cobain, Eddie Benjamin and Marvin Winans. Bieber handled the production on “Swag” alongside contributions from Tobias Jesso Jr., Carter Lang, Dylan Wiggins, Daniel Caesar, mk.gee, Daniel Chetrit, Knox Fortune and more.\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\tUpon release, “Swag” debuted at No. 2 on the Billboard 200 and marked his biggest streaming week yet. “Daisies” also bowed at No. 2 on the Billboard Hot 100, while “Yukon” peaked at No. 8 and “First Place” landed at No. 52.</p>\n<p>\n\tListen to “Swag II” below:</p>\n<figure></figure>\n</div>"

Under the leadership of filmmaker <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/danish-renzu/\">Danish Renzu</a>, the label has carved out a niche by combining music curation with cinematic storytelling through music videos.\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\tWarner’s distribution muscle will now support a roster that spans both established and emerging voices. The talent pipeline includes Zahra Banoo, Noor Mohammad, Hyder Dar, Adam, Saqib Wani, Shivani Matyal, Bilal Tantray, Afaq Dar, Kafil Qureshie, Tasneef Bukhari, and Masrat Un Nissa.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tSeveral high-profile fusion projects anchor the label’s current slate. Folk legend Noor Mohammad appears on multiple tracks, collaborating with Rashmeet Kaur on “Ranjha” and with Shikha Joshi on “Maryo.” IP Singh rounds out the featured releases with “Chingari.”</p>\n<p>\n\t“Our goal was to bring music from Kashmir to a larger audience and create a bridge between Kashmir and the rest of the world,” said Danish Renzu. “The distribution partnership with Warner does exactly that—it helps the sounds of Kashmir travel across the globe. I’m grateful to Vaibhav [Nagpal, head of partner relations, acquisition and distribution at Warner Music India] for putting his faith in us and excited to see where this journey takes us. We have some exciting projects lined up to share with the world.”\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\tThe deal has attracted endorsements from entertainment industry figures who see cultural significance in the partnership. Actor Saba Azad noted the broader implications: “Kashmir is often in the news but there is little to nothing of its culture that makes it to the mainstream. I’m delighted Danish is bringing the music of the people of Kashmir to mainstream India and the world and that Warner has put their faith in his efforts.”</p>\n<p>\n\tFor the artists involved, the collaboration represents an opportunity to blend traditional and contemporary approaches. Shikha Joshi reflected on her experience: “Creating an Indian fusion that blended Kashmiri folk with contemporary elements was so enriching. It was lovely working alongside naturally gifted artists like Noor Mohammad ji whose authentic folk texture gave a truly unique sound.”</p>\n<div><p>\n\tActor Udit Arora, known for Netflix’s “The Royals” and a collaborator on one of the label’s Kashmiri tracks, emphasized the timing: “Music from Kashmir is beautiful and I’m glad that finally this music is getting its well-deserved platform. We want to focus on more success stories from the valley. It’s time.”</p></div>\n</div>"

    "body": "<div><p>\n\tThe <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/unifrance-rendez-vous/\">Unifrance Rendez-Vous</a> TV market in Le Havre came to a close on Thursday with a celebration of animation, namely the latest season and 55th anniversary of the beloved classic series “Barbapapa: One Big Happy Family.”</p>\n<p>\n\tWhile animation has traditionally been one of France’s biggest exports, international sales continue to wane for local toon shows – one of the symptoms perhaps of a fast-changing global market whose reverberations are being felt in Normandy. \n\t</p>\n<p>\n\tAs Unifrance President Gilles Pélisson explained to <em>Variety </em>ahead of this year’s event, “independent production and distribution face increasing pressure as they compete with streamers and consolidated media groups.” In addition, “broadcasters face mounting challenges and platforms must adapt. We are witnessing an overall slowdown in market attendance, fueled by today’s uncertain geopolitical context.”\n</p>\n<p>\n\tSpeaking at the Rendez-Vous, Gaëtan Bruel, president of French national film center CNC, added: “We know we are navigating through a challenging period. The contraction of the international market, the changing consumption patterns, the transformation of economic models, and the deployment of new artificial intelligence tools, all of this is reshaping deeply the industry worldwide.”</p>\n<p>\n\tHe nevertheless offered an upbeat assessment of local productions: “French TV series continue to captivate audiences around the world, from the adaptation of the cult manga ‘Cat’s Eyes’that won the Unifrance TV export award last year,to the political drama ‘The Trigger’ – not to mention strong IPs with big success registered by light crime series like ‘Astrid &amp; Raphaëlle,’ a huge asset in today’s uncertain environment.”\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\tBruel stressed that documentary programs also drive international sales, and, “despite the international crisis affecting the animation industry, France continues to shine with strong IPs such as ‘Mystery Lane,’ ‘Molang,’ or ‘Miraculous: Tales of Ladybug &amp; Cat Noir.'”</p>\n<p>\n\tThis year’s major takeaways at the Rendez-Vous:</p>\n<p>\n\t<strong>Drama Up, Animation, U.S. Tumble Says Export Report</strong></p>\n<p>\n\tHard facts and figures on 2024 French TV export announced Tuesday Sept. 6 by the CNC and Unifrance confirmed market trends. On the sunny-side, overall exports at €209.6 million ($244.2 million) were up 3% from 2023, marking the second-highest level in 30 years fueled by co-productions (up 58% year on year at $135.3 million), especially with Europe. Drama confirmed its best-seller status (35.9% of sales).</p>\n<p>\n\tOn the downside animation — although weighing in as the second biggest export category — dropped for the fifth consecutive year, hit mostly by a sharp downturn in U.S. buys, pubcasters’ cuts both in youth programs and specialized staff in kids and youth, and streamers’ turning away from the medium in favor of entertainment and sports.</p>\n<p>\n\tAcross all program types, the report highlighted the need for strong IP to drive sales in a risk-averse environment. Region-wise, Western Europe still dominated (43.2% of revenues), but sales to North America tumbled to its lowest level ever at 7.9% of total export revenues.</p>\n<p>\n\t<strong>Safe Fiction Bets — Thrills and Light Bites</strong></p>\n<p>\n\tFrench crime — across various shades of noir — led the drama offer, catering to the international buyers who flocked earlier for Studio TF1’s “HIP,” <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/mediawan/\">Mediawan</a>’s “Tom &amp; Lola” or <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/france-tv-distribution/\">France TV Distribution</a>’s “Astrid et Raphaëlle.”</p>\n<p>\n\tAmong new crime shows, France TV’s Corsican thriller “Vendetta” had a splashy gala launch on Tuesday, attended by the main cast and crew led by creator Ange Basterga and co-stars Thierry Neuvic and Vahina Giocante, while Mediawan Rights bowed Louis Aubert and Matthieu Bernard’s eco-thriller “After Us” in the same Cinéma Pathé Docks Vauban. Federation International had a full slate of new crime titles ranging from “Skin Deep,” set in the world of plastic surgery, to the procedurals “Vigilantes,” “A Case for Kin,” “River Patrol” and the hit multi-season lighter “Deadly Tropics,” back for a seventh run.\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\tFederation’s lineup wasn’t just crime and dark drama – it was already promoting its first ever Christmas comedy, “My Hubert’s Christmas.” Wild Bunch TV, which had a red-carpet launch of its raunchy Prime Video soap “Escort Boys” Season 2, was also in a Christmassy mood with its new offer, “Single Bells.” “It’s light, funny and has a great adaptation potential,” said Diana Bartha, the banner’s head of acquisitions and international sales.</p>\n<p>\n\t“There is an appetite for solid crime and high-end series, at the same time, bold foreign-language dramas continue to travel well when the stand out in an oversaturated market,” noted Julie Mateille of About Premium Content, which balances English-language drama with well-crafted foreign-language fare.</p>\n<p>\n\t<strong>Strategic Pre-Mipcom Showcase</strong></p>\n<p>\n\tUnfolding just over a month ahead of Mipcom, Unifrance’s Rendez-vous proved yet again its importance for French sellers and producers as a unique market fully dedicated to French audiovisual works.</p>\n<p>\n\tFederation International’s co-head of distribution, Guillaume Pommier, underlined Le Havre’s strategic value: “Le Havre is a privileged moment to connect with our partners in a more informal setting, sharing meals, attending events together, which creates a different kind of bond. And as the market is strategically placed ahead of Mipcom, it allows us to present our lineup, get first feedback on certain titles, and fine-tune our strategy before Cannes.</p>\n<p>\n\t“Also, this year, we took the opportunity to do a screening event for ‘Nature: The Call for Reconciliation,’ the latest event documentary from filmmaker and environmental activist Yann Arthus-Bertrand.”</p>\n<p>\n\tSafaa Benazzouz, executive VP, Distribution at Xilam Animation, added: “It’s become a tradition at Xilam to attend Unifrance Rendez-vous as a great way to kick off our market season, and the event offers us an ideal opportunity to meet with both new and existing partners.”</p>\n<p>\n\t<strong>Europe Eager to Harmonize Audience Measurement</strong></p>\n<p>\n\tDiscussing the need and progress of establishing greater standardization in audience measurements, Yannick Carriou, head of research company Médiamétrie, stressed the pivotal effect of the rise of ad-supported services (AVOD) among major streamers that has forced them to be more cooperative in audience measurement: “Advertising agencies and brands have literally eased discussions [with streamers]. They told the likes of Netflix, Paramount, HBO Max-Disney: if you’re using ad-supported content, go and see Mediamétrie, because we believe in the reliability and transparency of their figures.”\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\tCarriou stressed: “Streamers have to be accountable to brands, and this has enticed them to change their attitude towards audience measurement.”</p>\n<p>\n\tRegarding the U.S. audience measurement market and main player Nielsen, Carriou underscored that Nielsen was not self-regulated, but owned by an investment fund, unlike Mediamétrie, a GIE, or economic interest group made up of private and public actors.</p>\n<p>\n\t“The U.S. market– dominated by streamers – is rather intricate and murky,” Carriou noted.</p>\n<p>\n\tCommenting on the implementation of the E.U.’s European Media Freedom Act (EMFA), he noted that it was intended “to strengthen freedom of expression and media pluralism, trying to impose through a legal framework the superiority of the self-regulatory model versus streamers’ authoritarian model of data ownership and analysis without external intervention. Streamers are not very pleased, but we are slowly making progress and obtaining better cooperation from their part.”</p>\n<p>\n\t<strong>Streamer Consolidation Squeezing Markets</strong></p>\n<p>\n\tDiscussing the impact of growing concentration in the market, Julia Schulte, SVP International Sales at France TV Distribution, said: “I think we are now feeling the consequences of what it really means to have such worldwide consolidation of the big streamers. In the long-term, it’s all about getting the best out of the whole markets, but investing maybe less. We still work a lot with the streamers, but it’s becoming more local, focused on French territories.”</p>\n<p>\n\tProducer Iris Bucher, CEO of Quad Drama, maker of the hit thriller “Surface,” said producing “has become more difficult nowadays than, for example, five years ago,” when U.S. platforms were actively chasing subscribers. “Money has become more difficult to get. People are probably more into saving and anxious about the future,” she said, noting the threats by U.S. President Trump to impose tariffs on European movies and TV series. “For the time being, we don’t have that problem, but perhaps one day we will. So it would be even more difficult to sell French shows all over the world.”</p>\n<p>\n\t<strong>The Deals</strong></p>\n<p>\n\tBrad Pitt’s L.A.-based Plan B Entertainment, part of Mediawan, is opening an office in London headed by producer Ed Macdonald (“Baby Reindeer”), proving yet again France’s pulling power as a leading financial and creative platform for audiovisual works, despite already heavy market build among major indie players.\n\t</p>\n<div>\n\t<p><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/oble/\">Oble</a> closed the Albert Camus-adaptation “The Plague” with TV5 Monde, Walter Presents for the U.S. (PBS Masterpiece Prime Video) and RTP for Portugal, adding to multi-deals inked earlier with the likes of AMC Networks International Southern Europe. The show, directed by “Call My Agent!” helmer Antoine Garceau premiered on France Télévisions to strong ratings. The French comedy-drama “Extra,” which screened in competition at Series Mania 2024 ahead of its local premiere on OCS, was swooped on by RTP and Swiss pubcaster RTS. In a separate deal, the lavish period drama “Winter Palace,” the first co-production between Netflix, RTS and Oble, also went to Walter Presents in the U.S., RTP in Portugal and SBS in Australia.</p><p>Federation International sold the Yann Arthus-Bertrand event documentary “Nature — The Call for Reconciliation” to Cescka TV for the Czech Republic and ZDF for Germany ahead of its screening in Le Havre. The call to individual action on climate change first aired on France’s M6 in February.</p><p>Xilam Animation added several European pubcasters to the BBC, France Télévisions and ZDF-commissioned preschool show “Piggy Builders.” New heavyweight buyers on board include Warner Bros. Discovery in Italy, SVT in Sweden, Yle in Finland, VRT Ketnet in Flemish Belgium, Téléquebec in French Canada and RTS in Switzerland.</p></div>\n<p>\n\tFrance Telévisions picked up Alain Moreau’s historical drama “Unchained,” produced by Tetra Media Fiction. Set in 1806 in Réunion Island, the show, which delves into France’s colonial past, stars Cannes winner Olivier Gourmet (“Le Fils”) and rising talent Enzo Rose.</p>\n<div><p>\n\tFrance TV Distribution also added Marine Gacem’s sexual assault drama “When the Night Comes,” produced by top banner Elephant Story. The thriller, inspired by true events, was produced for France 2.</p><p>About Premium Content, sales arm of global boutique group APC Studios, boarded the crime drama-family saga “Blue Gold,” produced by Authentic Prod for France Télévisions. “The Amateur’s” Barbara Probst headlines the soapy drama, in which a curse tied to water runs as a thread across two timelines — the 1980s and contemporary Provence.</p></div>\n<div><p>\n\tJava Films debuted in Le Havre the premium doc “Franco: Spain’s Scorned Memory” helmer Gaëlle Pialot’s exploration of the former authoritarian figure’s legacy in Spain, 50 years after his death. The film produced by Galaxie Presse, is due to premiere in France on Histoire TV this fall.</p><p>Kids specialist Madgic Distribution sold “Jade Armor” Season 2 to RTBF Belgium, Telequebec in Canada, Narrative in the U.K.; Hong-Kong-based PCCW bought a package, including “Nitso and the Very Hairy Alphabet,” “Lana Longbead,” “Isadora Moon” and “Jade Armor” Season 2. Elsehwere, TVO Canada and ABC Australia bought “Isadora Moon” and CBBC’s “High Hoops.”</p></div>\n<p>\n\tMiam!

Kinology is handling global sales, with Chanel supplying key costumes. \n</p>\n<p>\n\t“This comes from a more personal place and is less referential than my previous films,” Gonzalez explains. “It centers on a woman my own age, so it naturally touches on questions very close to me: desire at this stage of life, the ways we navigate intimacy and connection as we grow older, and the approach of mortality. In many ways, it’s a film about maturity.” </p>\n<div>\n<figure>\n\t\t\t<p><img srcset=\"https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/knifeheart-cannes.jpg 1000w, https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/knifeheart-cannes.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/knifeheart-cannes.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/knifeheart-cannes.jpg?resize=910,607 910w, https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/knifeheart-cannes.jpg?resize=681,454 681w, https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/knifeheart-cannes.jpg?resize=450,300 450w, https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/knifeheart-cannes.jpg?resize=250,167 250w\" src=\"https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/knifeheart-cannes.jpg?w=1000\" alt=\"\" />\n\t</p>\n\t\t\t<figcaption>\n\t\t\t\t\t<span>‘Knife + Heart’ </span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCourtesy of Cannes Film Festival\n\t</figcaption>\n</figure>\n</div>\n<p>\n\tJoining Paradis on screen are singer and funnyman Philippe Katerine (“Sink or Swim”), Italian rising star Filippo Scotti (“The Hand of God”), and trailblazing African-American filmmaker Fronza Woods (“Killing Time”), all performing in French. Production wrapped earlier this summer, ahead of a spring 2026 delivery.</p>\n<p>\n\tShot on 35mm stock by “Anatomy of a Fall” DP Simon Beaufils, the macabre thriller draws on Italian giallo for inspiration, with Gonzalez citing Francesco Barilli’s Mimsy Farmer-led “The Perfume of the Lady in Black” as a key reference.\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\t“I wanted to make a mental labyrinth, a gothic story with hints of horror,” he says. “Some elements recall my previous work, but this time there’s no comedy. It’s a more serious film – though we had a lot of fun making it.” </p>\n<p>\n\tThe filmmaker has also teamed with artist and composer Alain Garcia Vergara on the decidedly adult-skewing anthology “Memory Slot” – which Gonzalez describes as a “queer porno mixtape.”</p>\n<p>\n\t“Music drives everything on set,” he explains. “We’re taking eight tracks we love, from the 90s to today, and turning each into a short porno film, all held within a 70 minute feature. If we make it right, it could live in midnight screenings, a party where people dance and fuck to the music we love. A roadshow would be a dream. It’s not for traditional financiers; it sits between contemporary art and cinema, so we’ll need alternative funding. But that’s exactly the space I want to inhabit.”</p>\n</div>"

    "body": "<div><p>\n\tIt’s been an uncharacteristically strong year for Balkan cinema, with filmmakers from the southeastern corner of Europe fighting — often against all odds — to bring their stories to the screen, despite challenges ranging from civil unrest to moribund support from state-backed funding bodies.</p>\n<p>\n\tNevertheless, this year has seen the return of old masters, like Romanian provocateur Radu Jude (“<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/2025/film/reviews/dracula-review-radu-jude-1236486110/\">Dracula</a>”), and the emergence of fresh voices, such as Slovenia’s Urška Djukić (“<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/2025/film/reviews/little-trouble-girls-review-1236307876/\">Little Trouble Girls</a>”), alongside triumphs including North Macedonian director Georgi M. Unkovski’s dual Sundance prizewinner “<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/2025/film/reviews/dj-ahmet-review-1236285742/\">DJ Ahmet</a>” and Croatian director Igor Bezinović’s Rotterdam-winning docu-drama “<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/2025/film/reviews/fiume-o-morte-review-1236301450/\">Fiume O Morte!</a>”\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\tThat momentum has carried into the fall festivals, where North Macedonian directors Teona Strugar Mitevska (“The Happiest Man in the World”) and two-time Academy Award nominee Tamara Kotevska (“<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/2019/film/reviews/honeyland-review-1203124547/\">Honeyland</a>”) both launched their latest works at the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/venice-film-festival/\">Venice Film Festival</a>. They were joined on the Lido by veteran Bulgarian filmmaker Stephan Komandarev (“<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/2023/film/reviews/blagas-lessons-review-1235661246/\">Blaga’s Lessons</a>”), as well as Romanian director Mihai Mincan (“To the North”), making his second appearance at the festival. Meanwhile, Serbia’s Goran Stanković — best known as the co-creator of the Canneseries award-winning drama “<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/2024/tv/global/operation-sabre-zoran-dindic-1235963810/\">Sabre</a>” — premieres his feature directorial debut “Our Father” in Toronto.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tIn a fractious corner of Europe where political stability and uncertainty are often the norm, these and other filmmakers continue to propel regional cinema to new heights. Most encouraging of all, a crop of emerging Balkan directors is “creating increasingly daring works, especially with regards to their social and political criticisms of topics ranging from religion, family, gender politics, to corruption at state levels,” according to Dorota Lech, lead programmer of TIFF’s Discovery strand.\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\tThat audacious spirit has found its way into movies such as Serbian director Ivana Mladenović’s Locarno competition entry “<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/2025/film/reviews/sorella-di-clausura-review-1236495802/\">Sorella di Clausura</a>,” a riotous portrait of a jaded thirtysomething harboring an obsession with an aging pop star, and Mitevska’s “Mother,” which the director describes as a “<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/2024/film/global/noomi-rapace-mother-teresa-teona-strugar-mitevska-1236113498/\">punk rock</a>” biopic that stars Noomi Rapace as a young Mother Teresa.</p>\n<p>\n\tOpening the Horizons strand of the Venice Film Festival, “Mother” shows the future saint as the frustrated Mother Superior of a Kolkata convent awaiting permission from the Vatican to establish her own order. In Teresa’s struggle against the male-dominated Catholic power structure, Mitevska says she saw something of herself as an emerging filmmaker in the Balkans, where “it took years [for women] to be taken seriously.”</p>\n<p>\n\tAn iconoclastic director who was, like Teresa, born and raised in Skopje, Mitevska is among the trailblazers who paved the way for a younger generation of Balkan women behind the camera. Praising the “audacity” of those directors for claiming “the right to just say, ‘Fuck it,’ without fear,” Mitevska insists that she’s “always fought to have an equal part in the world we live in,” a sentiment echoed in “Mother” by a <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/2025/film/global/noomi-rapace-mother-teresa-teona-strugar-mitevskas-mother-1236498471/\">steely-eyed Rapace</a>. “I’m a woman in a system run by men,” she complains to her confessor. “Men, men, men.” </p>\n<div>\n<figure>\n\t\t\t<p><img srcset=\"https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/MixCollage-03-Sep-2025-08-24-AM-4299.jpg 2160w, https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/MixCollage-03-Sep-2025-08-24-AM-4299.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/MixCollage-03-Sep-2025-08-24-AM-4299.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/MixCollage-03-Sep-2025-08-24-AM-4299.jpg?resize=1920,1280 1920w, https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/MixCollage-03-Sep-2025-08-24-AM-4299.jpg?resize=1360,907 1360w, https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/MixCollage-03-Sep-2025-08-24-AM-4299.jpg?resize=1000,667 1000w, https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/MixCollage-03-Sep-2025-08-24-AM-4299.jpg?resize=910,607 910w, https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/MixCollage-03-Sep-2025-08-24-AM-4299.jpg?resize=681,454 681w, https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/MixCollage-03-Sep-2025-08-24-AM-4299.jpg?resize=450,300 450w, https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/MixCollage-03-Sep-2025-08-24-AM-4299.jpg?resize=250,167 250w\" src=\"https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/MixCollage-03-Sep-2025-08-24-AM-4299.jpg?w=1024\" alt=\"\" />\n\t</p>\n\t\t\t<figcaption>\n\t\t\t\t\t<span>Goran Stanković’s “Our Father” premieres at the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/toronto-film-festival/\">Toronto Film Festival</a>.</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCourtesy of This and That Productions\n\t</figcaption>\n</figure>\n</div>\n<p>\n\tThe patriarchy looms just as large in the cloistered world of “Our Father,” Goran Stanković’s riveting debut that premieres in the Discovery section in Toronto. The film follows a recovering addict in an isolated Serbian monastery whose Orthodox patriarch employs unorthodox methods that are often more extreme than effective at getting results.</p>\n<p>\n\t“Our Father,” which is based on a real events, is a piercing study of authoritarian power and its abuse, a theme that speaks directly to our current historical moment. “When you look at the mechanics of such a group and such a leader, I think you can draw parallels to our contemporary reality,” says Stanković. “Whether it’s Serbia, whether it’s all these countries that have strong leaders that are misusing the trust of the people and using fear.” \n\t</p>\n<p>\n\tSince last year, Serbia has been in the throes of civil unrest that began with student protests and has now broadened into a wider movement against the government of President Aleksandar Vučić. Though “Our Father” was written before those protests began, the director says the film nevertheless harnesses the energy of this pivotal moment for his country. “It is a warning tale,” he says. “It calls for action.”</p>\n<p>\n\tThe turbulence has had a dramatic impact on film and television production in Serbia, where the state-run film center cancelled its latest round of funding, and where Stanković says “the whole industry is at stake.” Yet that crisis is perhaps emblematic of the reality facing most filmmakers in Southeast Europe, a region that Maša Marković, head of the Sarajevo Film Festival’s influential industry strand, insists “is always in some kind of turmoil.” </p>\n<p>\n\tThe fortunes of individual industries in the Balkans often rise and fall in “cycles,” says Marković, but “the filmmakers in the region are very [pro-active] in finding new ways to finance films.” More often than not, she adds, “they have to be very flexible” in order to adapt to a shifting political landscape. </p>\n<p>\n\tThe Croatian and Slovenian industries are enjoying protracted periods of stability, while North Macedonia — bolstered by a change of leadership at its state-run film agency — has had a breakout year, with a trio of films at A-class festivals. Romania, meanwhile, has tried to right the ship after several wayward years of mismanagement at the Romanian Film Center, and a pile of unpaid debts from its cash rebate program that the government is finally close to settling in full.</p>\n<div>\n<figure>\n\t\t\t<p><img srcset=\"https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Milk-Teeth.jpg 1000w, https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Milk-Teeth.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Milk-Teeth.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Milk-Teeth.jpg?resize=910,607 910w, https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Milk-Teeth.jpg?resize=681,454 681w, https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Milk-Teeth.jpg?resize=450,300 450w, https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Milk-Teeth.jpg?resize=250,167 250w\" src=\"https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Milk-Teeth.jpg?w=1000\" alt=\"\" />\n\t</p>\n\t\t\t<figcaption>\n\t\t\t\t\t<span>“Milk Teeth” premiered at the Venice Film Festival.</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tAndrei Oană\n\t</figcaption>\n</figure>\n</div>\n<p>\n\tThe system<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/2025/film/global/revamped-romanian-cash-rebate-1236436931/\"> appears to be back on track</a>, but Mihai Mincan — whose latest film, “Milk Teeth,” premieres in the Venice Film Festival’s Orizzonti sidebar — says he still feels “completely unsupported by the Romanian state.” While small groups of filmmakers continue to work in their own “little churches,” as he describes it, Mincan insists: “I don’t think we have an industry.”</p>\n<p>\n\t“Milk Teeth” draws on the director’s own coming of age at the tail end of the communist era in Romania, just as the country was making its uncertain transition to democracy — a time the director describes as “the most beautiful moment” of his life. \n\t</p>\n<p>\n\t“There was so much hope in the air,” he says. “We had expectations, and we had dreams, as all young people do. But Romania has this amazing talent at crushing your dreams very fast.”</p>\n<p>\n\tThat is perhaps in part because the fall of strongman Nicolae Ceaușescu, which ushered in the democratic era in Romania, brought along with it a headlong rush toward a turbo-charged model of capitalism whose calamitous, long-lasting impact can be felt — in Romania, and across its former Eastern Bloc neighbors — to this day.</p>\n<p>\n\tIt’s there in recent Romanian films including Mladenović’s “<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/2025/film/global/sorella-di-clausura-ivana-mladenovic-balkan-comedy-1236490999/\">Sorella di Clausura</a>” and Jude’s 2024 Berlin prizewinner “<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/2025/film/reviews/kontinental-25-review-1236311447/\">Kontinental ’25</a>,” as well as in Stephan Komandarev’s Venice premiere “Made in EU,” which follows a coronavirus outbreak in a Bulgarian sweatshop. The film, set in a provincial town in what the director describes as “one of the poorest regions in Europe,” highlights what he calls a Bulgarian ethos of “working till you drop and barely making a living.”</p>\n<p>\n\tIf the filmmakers of Southeast Europe are united by a common history and a shared experience of today’s hardships, they’re also joined by a spirit of togetherness: most of the films to emerge from the region are multi-country co-productions that rely heavily on collaboration with neighboring nations.</p>\n<p>\n\tStill, cultural support for many countries in the region is in decline, with Mincan noting that “it’s harder and harder to build co-productions.” The director believes Balkan filmmakers should instead take inspiration from the indie American movement of the ’90s, when directors like Jim Jarmusch, Kelly Reichardt and Quentin Tarantino made “films with a lot of attitude that didn’t care…about financial support.”</p>\n<p>\n\tThat revolutionary decade, which Mincan notes produced scores of “super low-budget films, [with] universal themes, done very fast without a lot of money,” gave a voice to directors who were determined to make their movies, with or without the support of the studio system. </p>\n<p>\n\tIt’s a spirit that would do just as well for Balkan filmmakers who are determined to meet the urgency of this moment, with Mincan insisting: “We’re living in a world where if you have something to say, it’s important to say it now.”</p>\n</div>"

With a mansion filled with files, cameras and an army of waitstaff, Prater reveals himself as not just a collector of killers, but an eager applicant to the Dexter School of Dark Passengers after he commits his first kill by murdering Batista. The plan by Prater and his resourceful sidekick Charley (Uma Thurman) is to leave Dexter in the vault for three days without food and water until he dies. Of course, he’s holding a gala to raise money for local police just downstairs.\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\tOne thing Prater and Charley didn’t count on was Batista still having his cellphone on him, which begins to ring with a call from his former partner Joey Quinn (Desmond Harrington), who leaves a voicemail saying he’s worried about him after the NYPD called and learned that Batista was retired and no longer a cop, and still pursuing the Bay Harbor Butcher case. Quinn has no idea that Batista is dead, but that will surely be a factor next season.</p>\n<div>\n<figure>\n\t\t\t<p><img srcset=\"https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/DexterResurrection-finale-brother.jpg 1200w, https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/DexterResurrection-finale-brother.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/DexterResurrection-finale-brother.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/DexterResurrection-finale-brother.jpg?resize=1000,667 1000w, https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/DexterResurrection-finale-brother.jpg?resize=910,607 910w, https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/DexterResurrection-finale-brother.jpg?resize=681,454 681w, https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/DexterResurrection-finale-brother.jpg?resize=450,300 450w, https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/DexterResurrection-finale-brother.jpg?resize=250,167 250w\" src=\"https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/DexterResurrection-finale-brother.jpg?w=1024\" alt=\"\" />\n\t</p>\n\t\t\t<figcaption>\n\t\t\t\t\t<span>Christian Camargo as Brian Moser</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCourtesy of Zach Dilgard/Paramount+\n\t</figcaption>\n</figure>\n</div>\n<p>\n\tSo with a cellphone in hand, Dexter calls his son, Harrison (Jack Alcott), who is currently in the midst of intimate relations with his girlfriend Gigi. Harrison goes to the gala, where he was hired to work, but declined after he’d met Prater two episodes ago. While Dad tries to give Harrison directions from inside a vault, with the camera on FaceTime, Harrison is busy using waiter routes and vault codes to navigate the mansion. Their whispered phone tag turned power play — Dexter wanting him to run, Harrison doubling down — is fun (but also frustrating), and the finale (mostly) cements Harrison as a worthy strategic partner.</p>\n<p>\n\tHarrison gets to the vault area and has to input an eight-digit code that you only get one chance at before the alarms go off and the police show up. Good thing Dexter is in the room with a file cabinet containing a treasure trove of documents on every serial killer in the world, including the ones Dexter has killed this season. One file is on Prater himself, which has the clue Dexter thinks will unlock the door.</p>\n<p>\n\tSo Harrison, with FaceTime on, springs into action. Meanwhile, Charley has spent all season in chic jackets and moral quicksand, and once she runs into Harrison and looks like she’s about to kill him, Dexter dangles bait, telling her Prater is pulling the strings, as he has a file on her too. Dexter threatens to send it out, and her counteroffer is he doesn’t send it out, she won’t kill Harrison, but Dexter must still stay in there and die. She walks out to deal with Prater.</p>\n<div>\n<figure>\n\t\t\t<p><img srcset=\"https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/DexterResurrection-finale-Prater-Harrison.jpg 1200w, https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/DexterResurrection-finale-Prater-Harrison.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/DexterResurrection-finale-Prater-Harrison.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/DexterResurrection-finale-Prater-Harrison.jpg?resize=1000,667 1000w, https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/DexterResurrection-finale-Prater-Harrison.jpg?resize=910,607 910w, https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/DexterResurrection-finale-Prater-Harrison.jpg?resize=681,454 681w, https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/DexterResurrection-finale-Prater-Harrison.jpg?resize=450,300 450w, https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/DexterResurrection-finale-Prater-Harrison.jpg?resize=250,167 250w\" src=\"https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/DexterResurrection-finale-Prater-Harrison.jpg?w=1024\" alt=\"\" />\n\t</p>\n\t\t\t<figcaption>\n\t\t\t\t\t<span>Peter Dinklage as Leon Prater and Jack Alcott as Harrison Morgan </span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCourtesy of Zach Dilgard/Paramount+\n\t</figcaption>\n</figure>\n</div>\n<p>\n\tCharley’s final conversations — with Dexter, and then Prater — are loaded with possible teases for more of her in future seasons (perhaps?). She escapes with her ailing mother and tells her they’re going back “home,” wherever that is.\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\tFrom the vault, Batista’s cellphone is dying (thanks Apple!), and after Dexter changes his mind about which numbers Harrison should enter, it dies. But don’t worry, the door opens and the two are reunited. The father-son escape — sneaking through service corridors and improvising under the noses of NYPD brass — which was pure “Dexter” and kind of hilarious in a time of technology being everywhere.</p>\n<p>\n\tDexter decides to gather all the files on him and other killers to take with him. He tells Harrison to leave, but Prater sees him, just moments after Charley goes up to him and quits. Prater goes to his head of security, tells him to turn off all the cameras in the mansion and goes after Harrison. He calls Dexter back upstairs, and has a gun to Harrison’s head. After he pleads for Prater to kill him instead, which he declines, we find out the “protection” that Dexter slipped his son two episodes ago, which led us all to believe was a condom for his shenanigans with his girlfriend, was one of his signature needles to put his prey to sleep. Harrison sticks Prater with it, and he goes down.</p>\n<div>\n<figure>\n\t\t\t<p><img srcset=\"https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/DexterResurrection-finale-Dexer-Prater.jpg 1200w, https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/DexterResurrection-finale-Dexer-Prater.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/DexterResurrection-finale-Dexer-Prater.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/DexterResurrection-finale-Dexer-Prater.jpg?resize=1000,667 1000w, https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/DexterResurrection-finale-Dexer-Prater.jpg?resize=910,607 910w, https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/DexterResurrection-finale-Dexer-Prater.jpg?resize=681,454 681w, https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/DexterResurrection-finale-Dexer-Prater.jpg?resize=450,300 450w, https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/DexterResurrection-finale-Dexer-Prater.jpg?resize=250,167 250w\" src=\"https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/DexterResurrection-finale-Dexer-Prater.jpg?w=1024\" alt=\"\" />\n\t</p>\n\t\t\t<figcaption>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCourtesy of Zach Dilgard/Paramount+\n\t</figcaption>\n</figure>\n</div>\n<p>\n\tDexter sets up a kill room in the vault and delivers a closing narration on par with Season 4 when he killed the Trinity Killer (John Lithgow), which reframed Dexter’s arc. A very audibly whiny Prater is killed by one of the knives in the room. Dexter cleans up (so fast, by the way that my wife was impressed), sets the alarm off and goes off into the night with Prater’s bloody thumb so he can get out of the room, and to his boat to dump his body right in front of the Statue of Liberty (there have to be cameras there, though, right?). He leaves Batista in there for the cops to find, and the gun with Prater’s prints on it. They think he did it, which he did, but also, is no one going to check Angel’s phone logs and see he called Harrison Morgan after he died? Maybe that’s Quinn’s clue for his arc next season. Is everyone from Miami Metro about to come to NYC one at a time, and end up dying because of Dexter? Remember: Eric Stonestreet’s ponytail killer is still out there after bailing out of the intermission of “Hamilton.”</p>\n<p>\n\tIn a very fitting internal monologue as he gets rid of Prater’s chopped up body, Dexter puts the series back into focus. Once resigned to isolation, he now admits he needs Harrison — not just as a son, but as a confidant. “I’m exactly who I need to be. Exactly who you want me to be,” he tells the audience in voiceover. \n\t</p>\n<div>\n<p>\n\tBut let’s get to the underwhelming part. For weeks, the New York Ripper case has lurked on the periphery of the series — a boogeyman that the show kept hinting was someone in Dexter’s life. We’ve learned the killer’s weapon of choice was a crowbar-like tool, that his spree ended eight years ago and that he now torments families with cruel late-night phone calls. One of his murder weapons was revealed among Prater’s grotesque collection. In the finale, the mystery became tangible when Dexter discovered a file in Prater’s homage room to serial killers. On it: a name. Are you ready? Don Framt.</p>\n<div>\n<p>\n\tWho? Exactly. </p>\n<p>\n\tThe reveal left more questions than it provided answers. Was Prater manipulating evidence? Is Framt a nobody, a red herring or someone we’ve already met under a different name? For now, Dexter left the Ripper file as a gift to Detective Claudette Wallace (Kadia Saraf), the “Stayin’ Alive”-loving cop whose instincts may prove vital in the story’s future. It’s less closure for the season, than a breadcrumb trail to Season 2.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>"

    "body": "<div><p>\n\tThe secret of “Maddie’s Secret” — or maybe it’s the central joke — is that the movie’s creator and star, comedian <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/john-early/\">John Early</a>, takes the whole thing seriously.</p>\n<p>\n\tA tongue-in-cheek critique of influencer culture crossed with a sincere homage to the heyday of disease-of-the-week TV movies, the tricky, one-of-a-kind stunt stars Early (who is male) as Maddie “the Fattie” Ralph (who is not). But gender doesn’t factor into the queer comedian’s play-it-straight directorial debut, at least not insofar as his food-passionate protagonist’s fragile reality is concerned.\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\tJust as John Waters’ muse, Divine, assumed dowdy-housewife drag in movies such as “Hairspray” and “Polyester,” Early dons a blond wig and falsies to embody his film’s titular ingenue: a guileless vegetarian chef whose overnight viral-video success triggers her long-suppressed eating disorder. And also like Waters, who channeled the so-lush-they’re-lurid style of Douglas Sirk’s 1950s melodramas, Early adopts the gauzy, soft-light look of “tasteful” ’80s telepics like “The Burning Bed” and “The Best Little Girl in the World” for an ironic send-up of those over-earnest issue movies.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tBulimia is no joke, even if Early finds unexpected humor in satirizing how such issues were once dealt with by mainstream TV. But he’s not poking fun at the underlying disorder so much as the Emmy-chasing performances that such conditions inspired among a certain category of actor. The entire cast — which is composed mostly of comedians — is acting in air quotes here, delivering the most awards-hungry version of every line reading.\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\tMaddie works for a Condé Nast-owned cooking brand called GourMaybe, washing dishes for her idol, Emily Brown (Claudia O’Doherty). It’s a toxic work environment, to say the least, in that the network’s backside-slapping boss (Conner O’Malley) expects a taste of the talent, so to speak. The harassment situation’s no better in the trenches, as Maddie’s lesbian best friend Deena (Kate Berlant) has less-than-admirable intentions as well.</p>\n<p>\n\tMaddie’s too much the good girl to stoop to such short cuts, and besides, she’s unwaveringly faithful to her husband, Jake (Eric Rahill), who supports Maddie’s cooking dreams, but knows nothing about the childhood trauma that turned her off to red meat. Hint: It has everything to do with unresolved tensions between Maddie and her mother, a ravenous cougar named Beverlee (Kristen Johnston).</p>\n<p>\n\tOne evening after work, Jake films Maddie making dinner and then edits the footage into binge-worthy content — or as he puts it, using “all the tricks to keep people in a stupor on the platforms.” Sure enough, the segment racks up more than half a million views overnight, earning Maddie an instant promotion to recipe developer and an audition to consult on the hit restaurant show “The Boar.” As Maddie’s star rises, so too does her anxiety, and the next thing we know, she’s sneaking away to the bathroom to regurgitate her food (although the purging happens off camera, Maddie’s bloodshot eyes and puke-splattered lips make clear what’s happening).</p>\n<p>\n\tWhen Jake finds her bent over the toilet bowl, he’s gullible enough to believe that she’s pregnant. Deena isn’t nearly so daft, though she’s more of an enabler, using Maddie’s secret to insinuate herself deeper into the life of her inappropriate workplace crush. During one especially strenuous workout at the “radically inclusive” queer gym Deena recommended, Maddie goes into cardiac arrest and nearly dies. Her doctor (Chris Bauer) insists that she go to rehab immediately.</p>\n<p>\n\tThe next segment of the movie recalls 2017 Sundance drama “To the Bone,” in which Lily Collins battled anorexia, or 2023’s “Parachute,” featuring Brittany Snow. Early treads lightly here: He doesn’t want to downplay the gravity of such conditions, taking care to offer the same advice such legitimately concerned dramas might provide. But that doesn’t stop him from embracing a retro-funky tone (courtesy of composer Michael Hesslein) and parodying some of the genre’s more overplayed clichés — like Maddie’s unstable roommate (Vanessa Bayer) or the facility’s raccoon-eyed rebel (Leah Hennessey), both straight out of “Girl, Interrupted.”\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\tIs there someone out there who might watch “Maddie’s Secret” and not realize that the main character is being played by a man? Perhaps, although this is hardly Early’s first female character (“Vicky With a V” is especially popular with his fans). With his dreamy blue eyes and slender nose, Early looks like a woman  less than he resembles Ryan Gosling in drag, though it all adds to the movie’s body dysmorphia premise. As casting choices go, here is an extreme case where there are no limits on who can play what, sure to tickle some and tick off others on both sides of the aisle. </p>\n<p>\n\tIt’s fun to watch Berlant, Early’s longtime partner in comedy, poke fun at queer stereotypes (as when she receives a call from “this married chick I’m bangin’,” or in her character’s final scene). There’s an inherent absurdity in watching Jake embrace his wife from behind, convinced that he can feel the baby in her growing belly. More twisted still is the underlying explanation for Maddie’s psychosis, which eventually comes out in therapy, giving Johnston a chance to play the unrepentant screen mom.</p>\n<p>\n\tAs wild as things can get (tamer than you might expect), Early keeps the film emotionally grounded. Can Maddie be cured? Maybe not, but her secret’s safe with him.</p>\n</div>"
