Earlier deals were sealed with Be-tv in Belgium and RÚV in Iceland. Main commissioner TV2 Norway will launch the show domestically in October.\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\tJes Brandhoj, director of sales & series acquisitions at Nordisk Film, said the early commitment from the Nordic broadcasters is “a fantastic vote of confidence.” “With its mix of humour, heart, and relatable family drama, “Nepobaby” is exactly the kind of feel‑good storytelling that connects people and we can’t wait to see it come to life on their platforms.”\n</p>\n<p>\n\tCreated by Henriette Steenstrup with “Pørni” actor Vivild Falk Berg in mind, “Nepobaby” was co-written by Steenstrup with “Young & Promising”’s Siri Seljeseth, in collaboration with Tina Rygh. Gunnar Vikene and Hallvar Witzø are co-directing.</p>\n<p>\n\tThe first season centres on Emma, a newly graduated physiotherapist who has just bought her first apartment with her fiancé, Niko (Deniz Kaya of “The Worst Person in the World”). Her world is turned upside down when she discovers she is the secret daughter of shipping magnate Ludvig “Doddo” Bullmann and one of his heirs. \n\t</p>\n<p>\n\tHer newfound wealthy siblings are played by Steenstrup, Nicolai Cleve Broch (“The Sandhamn Murders”), Kristin Grue (“Power Play”) and Helle Ryg Eia (“Peak TV”). </p>\n<p>\n\t“It’s ‘Succession’ meets ‘Veep’ made in a fun way,” Canneseries artistic director Albin Lewi said last April when the series world premiered in Cannes. The Norwegian six-parter will be showcased at the Panorama section of Barcelona’s Serielizados festival in November.</p>\n<p>\n\tA second season is waiting for a greenlight.  “Nepobaby” was produced by Ida Håndlykken Kvernstrøm and Bård Ljones Fjulsrud for Oslo-based Eldorado Content Club.</p>\n<p>\n\tAt Mipcom, Oble’s co-founder Katia Sol will continue negotiating rights on the show, next to other premium shows including “Winter Palace,” co-produced by Oble and Point Prod for RTS and Netflix, the Canneseries-selected “Jailbreak” (“Zonz”) from France and “Noob” from New Zealand. </p>\n</div>"

I spent my life on the road, moving around the world as kind of a musical ambassador for America … trying to measure the distance between American reality, where we’ve often fallen short of our ideals.”</p>\n<p>\n\tHe added, “But for a lot of folks out there, she continues to be a land of hope and dreams, not of fear or divisiveness or government censorship or hatred.”</p>\n<p>\n\tWatch a clip of Springsteen’s surprise New York Film Festival performance below.</p>\n<figure></figure>\n</div>"

    "body": "<div><p>\n\tA high-powered panel at the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/all-that-matters/\">All That Matters</a> conference in Singapore brought together leaders from sports, gaming, music, marketing and emerging tech to debate what drives entertainment now — and what will shape its future.</p>\n<p>\n\tModerated by Branded CEO Jasper Donat, the discussion featured Amanda Staveley, CEO of PCP Capital Partners; Akshat Rathee, managing director of Nodwin Gaming; Gita de Beer, global strategy and incubator brands lead at Heineken; Rebecca Barkin, co-founder and CEO of Lamina1; and Calvin Wong, CEO of Universal Music Group Southeast Asia and Korea.\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\tStaveley, who with her husband has built a global investment portfolio across media and sport, said her group is raising a dedicated sports and media fund. “The one thing that is consistent is that sport is fabulous content,” she noted, adding that younger demographics demand “leading edge” delivery and fan engagement. She flagged the looming shift to direct-to-consumer models, saying it could take “six, seven billion pounds” ($8-9.4 billion) to embed fully at Premier League soccer level.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tRathee highlighted seismic changes underway in gaming. “For the first time ever, there are more young gamers on planet Earth than older gamers,” he said, noting the median age is dropping by about seven months each year. He also pointed to “power in gaming shifting from China to Saudi Arabia,” alongside a move from PC to mobile-first consumption.</p>\n<p>\n\tAt one point, Rathee declared that “it’s all going to be on this,” while gesturing to his glasses. He explained that Meta, Google and Amazon are all preparing new smart glasses, signaling what he sees as the coming redundancy of mobile devices. He predicted the next generation of breakout titles will come from fans themselves, citing the history of “<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/counter-strike/\">Counter-Strike</a>” and “<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/dota/\">Dota</a>” as mods that grew into decades-long franchises. Looking ahead, he argued that “the highest level of premium experiences will go physical, but they’ll be based on digital camaraderie,” pointing to phenomena such as Comic-Con and “<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/kpop-demon-hunters/\">Kpop Demon Hunters</a> mashups” as examples of communities born online that spill over into real-world gatherings.\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\tDe Beer identified three key factors for brands: speed, localization and attention. “For global brands, they really need to build global brands, but with a very hard local soul,” she said, warning that consumer attention spans have now shrunk to “less than a second.” </p>\n<p>\n\tBarkin stressed the importance of decentralization and giving both creators and fans a stake in IP. “For entirely too long, IP creators have sacrificed their rights in exchange for visibility,” she said. Lamina1, co-founded with sci-fi writer Neal Stephenson, is developing blockchain-based platforms aimed at restructuring content economics. “The idea that you could have a direct connection with fans as an IP holder and work with them to do world building… with better economics and a piece of equity — that’s what we’re focused on,” she added.</p>\n<p>\n\tWong underlined copyright protection and long-term artist development as central to UMG’s strategy. “If the ecosystem doesn’t allow that to happen, music will become a lot more boring going forward,” he said, referencing the years-long development of artists such as Sabrina Carpenter. He pointed to the global rise of Asian talent, including Malay-Sikh DEF Jam rapper Abangsapau, who performed at the event, Indian rapper Hanumankind and Thai acts selling out Japan. Wong also highlighted UMG’s new “music for wellness” initiatives, using pop songs with artists’ permission to aid focus, relaxation and sleep.</p>\n<p>\n\tAll That Matters, which began as a music conference, and has grown to encompass sports, gaming, web3, marketing and content, is celebrating its 20th edition this year. </p>\n</div>"

    "body": "<div><p>\n\tDirector Jonas Ulrich formed an actual black metal band for his debut feature “<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/wolves/\">Wolves</a>.” </p>\n<p>\n\tWLVS – led by actor <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/bartosz-bielenia/\">Bartosz Bielenia</a>, known for Oscar-nominated “Corpus Christi” – ended up touring and performing in real clubs. As well as its own world premiere at <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/zurich-film-festival/\">Zurich Film Festival</a>. </p>\n<p>\n\t“To take it seriously, we shot real concerts. We wrote a full album and built a stage show. I wanted musicians to watch it and say: ‘I know exactly what that feels like,’” says Ulrich, explaining the whole shoot was built around the gigs they managed to book.\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\t“I like music films when the human drama also stands on its own – when you could remove the music and the story still works. ‘Control’ and ‘Sound of Metal’ are good examples of that. We also wanted to push against the formula. In the end, the film isn’t really about the band.”\n</p>\n<p>\n\t“I used to only listen to Iron Maiden and Tool, but since we’ve made the film, this music stayed with me,” adds Bielenia. </p>\n<p>\n\t“I’ve always wanted to start a metal band, but I didn’t have the strength – or the skills. It was a great adventure to play these concerts and convince people with our performance. People who didn’t even know they were taking a part in a film.” </p>\n<p>\n\tIn “Wolves,” Luana (Selma Kopp) decides to join her cousin’s black metal band on tour. She falls for its singer, Wiktor (Bartosz Bielenia), but his views might be more radical than she thinks. </p>\n<p>\n\t“I’m a metalhead. I used to do booking, promotion and concert photography for underground bands. I wanted a film that treats this world seriously, not some cliché about 1980s rock star antics or satanic rituals,” says Ulrich.\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\tKopp had no prior connection to black metal. </p>\n<p>\n\t“That was exactly what intrigued me, because I love discovering new worlds and life realities through acting. It was an exciting challenge to immerse myself in such a different environment and grow from it,” she notes. </p>\n<p>\n\t“Music is always central to my preparation process. For every role I create playlists to capture the character’s emotions. With Luana, this worked perfectly, since I already knew what kind of music she listens to. It helped me connect with her world on a deeper level.”</p>\n<p>\n\tSold by Yellow Affair and produced by Dynamic Frame GmbH, “Wolves” – which debuted its <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/2025/film/global/wolves-trailer-zurich-1236529494/\">trailer</a> with <em>Variety</em> last week – is taking a look at a female perspective “within a largely male scene.”</p>\n<p>\n\t“Especially in black metal. I wanted to show how they’re perceived and how relationships get complicated. From the start, we aimed to show both the good and the bad,” says Zurich-born Ulrich.</p>\n<p>\n\tIntrigued by “people who aren’t what they first appear to be,” he started to look for the right actors “long before” the script was even finished. </p>\n<p>\n\t“We mixed professional actors with real musicians to get the world right, which created a rough, alive chemistry on screen.”</p>\n<p>\n\tBielenia, soon to be seen in <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/2025/film/news/time-that-never-came-rogowska-1236388760/\">“The Time That Never Came,”</a> is also an experienced stage actor. Kopp is making her acting debut.</p>\n<p>\n\t“Luana makes some difficult and even wrong decisions over the course of the film. To portray her authentically, I needed to find a way into her motivations and emotions, which wasn’t always easy. But I came to understand her, and I believe the audience can as well,” she says. </p>\n<p>\n\tBielenia calls Wiktor a “very dark person.”</p>\n<p>\n\t“In my mind, a lot of his problems, and his darkness, comes from his overwhelming solitude. He’s in a strange place, among strangers. He has no connection to his home or his family,” explains Bielenia. </p>\n<p>\n\tWiktor “clings to relationships as some kind of confirmation of his worth” and uses other people. But there are affectionate moments.  </p>\n<p>\n\t“Maybe there’s some hope for him? I always try to understand my character. We had added a story of Wiktor’s orphanhood and loneliness. He’s an uprooted tree. He only has himself.”\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\tBielenia notes: “In a climate of growing unrest and fascist movements, when even CEOs of large corporations sometimes give the Nazi salute, such gestures were difficult for us and only used as a last resort. But I think it’s worth showing how easy it is to fall into the trap of extreme ideology.”</p>\n<div>\n<figure>\n<p><img srcset=\"https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/MixCollage-28-Sep-2025-07-18-PM-6135.jpg 1500w, https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/MixCollage-28-Sep-2025-07-18-PM-6135.jpg?resize=150,84 150w, https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/MixCollage-28-Sep-2025-07-18-PM-6135.jpg?resize=300,169 300w, https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/MixCollage-28-Sep-2025-07-18-PM-6135.jpg?resize=125,70 125w, https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/MixCollage-28-Sep-2025-07-18-PM-6135.jpg?resize=1000,563 1000w, https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/MixCollage-28-Sep-2025-07-18-PM-6135.jpg?resize=910,511 910w, https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/MixCollage-28-Sep-2025-07-18-PM-6135.jpg?resize=681,383 681w, https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/MixCollage-28-Sep-2025-07-18-PM-6135.jpg?resize=450,253 450w, https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/MixCollage-28-Sep-2025-07-18-PM-6135.jpg?resize=250,140 250w\" src=\"https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/MixCollage-28-Sep-2025-07-18-PM-6135.jpg?w=1024\" alt=\"\" />\n\t</p>\n<figcaption>\n\t\t\t\t\t<span>“Wolves”</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCourtesy of Zurich Film Festival\n\t</figcaption>\n</figure>\n</div>\n</div>"

Ve y dile a tu abuela, que seremos el HALFTIME SHOW DEL SUPER BOWL.”\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\tJust moments before the announcement, Bad Bunny took to X to say that he had one show planned for the United States. “Estuve pensando en estos días, y luego de hablarlo con mi equipo, creo que haré una sola fecha en Estados Unidos,” he <a href=\"https://x.com/sanbenito/status/1972478017307042265\" target=\"_blank\">wrote</a>, which translates in English to, “I’ve been thinking about it these days, and after discussing it with my team, I think I’ll do just one date in the United States.”\n</p>\n<p>\n\tHe was referring to his upcoming Debí Tirar Más Fotos World Tour, which kicks off on December 5 in Costa Rica and heads to Mexico, Spain and England before wrapping in Italy on July 17-18. He previously <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/2025/music/news/bad-bunny-didnt-include-us-in-tour-dates-fear-ice-raids-1236514269/\">said</a> that he did not book gigs in the United States for fear of ICE raids. He has shows scheduled before and after the Super Bowl, with dates set for Chile on Feb. 5-7 and Argentina on Feb. 15-17, though it’s unclear if those performances will still take place.</p>\n<p>\n\t“What Benito has done and continues to do for Puerto Rico is truly inspiring,” said Roc Nation founder Jay-Z in a statement. His company has partnered with the NFL since 2019 to book the Super Bowl Halftime Show. “We are honored to have him on the world’s biggest stage.”\n\t</p>\n<figure></figure>\n<p>\n\tThis marks the first time that the Puerto Rican musician has graced the Super Bowl stage. He’s coming off a red-hot year that began with the release of his seventh album “Debí Tirar Más Fotos” in January, serving as an homage to his native land. He then staged a 30-date residency at San Juan’s José Miguel Agrelot Coliseum that started in July and <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/2025/music/news/bad-bunny-marc-anthony-puerto-rico-residency-emotional-duet-1236525490/\">recently wrapped on September 20</a>. </p>\n<p>\n\tRumors had been swirling over the past few weeks that Adele and Taylor Swift both passed on performing during next year’s game. Earlier this month, NFL commissioner <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/2025/music/news/taylor-swift-welcome-to-play-super-bowl-halftime-nfl-goodel-1236506089/\">Roger Goodell said on “Today”</a> that Swift was “welcome at any time” to perform during the Halftime Show. “We would always love to have Taylor play,” Goodell said. “She is a special, special talent and obviously, she would be welcome at any time.”</p>\n<p>\n\tLast year, Kendrick Lamar performed with appearances from SZA, Samuel L. Jackson, Mustard and Serena Williams. In the years prior, the NFL featured Usher, Rihanna and, in 2022, a slate of hip-hop and R&B royalty including Dr. Dre, Snoop Dogg, Eminem, Mary J. Blige and Lamar, with featured guests 50 Cent and Anderson .Paak.</p>\n</div>"

    "body": "<div><p>\n\tSingapore national broadcaster <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/mediacorp/\">Mediacorp</a> unveiled its plans to make 2025 the “year of <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/microdramas/\">microdramas</a>” at the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/all-that-matters/\">All That Matters</a> conference, with chief customer and corporate development officer Angeline Poh announcing that the broadcaster will roll out at least 10 titles across social and owned platforms by year-end. </p>\n<p>\n\t“It’s a new storytelling medium for us… immediately reaching a regional, if not global audience,” Poh said, noting that brand partners are already integrating into the short-form scripted format.\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\tThe microdrama push underscores how Mediacorp is evolving from a traditional network into a multi-platform content and talent incubator. In conversation with Branded CEO Jasper Donat, Poh noted that the broadcaster now reaches 96% of Singapore’s adult population weekly across TV, radio, digital and social platforms. \n</p>\n<p>\n\t“We’re obsessed about maintaining this national reach so that we can serve our purpose as the national media network,” she said at the conference, which is taking place in Singapore. Period drama “Emerald Hill” became the country’s No. 1 drama and held the top spot on Netflix in Southeast Asia for four weeks, while indie musicians nurtured through Mediacorp audio brands have performed at the National Day Parade.</p>\n<p>\n\tOn the news front, Poh highlighted Mediacorp’s global digital traction, citing coverage of China’s World War II Victory Day parade that generated more than 50 million views, with the U.S. emerging as its most engaged non-Singapore YouTube market. “We don’t have a stake in the game, we’re neutral. We’re just telling it as it is. That speaks to a global audience,” she said.\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\tMediacorp is also retooling its youth brands, with DJs livestreaming everyday life on TikTok and Instagram, and expanding its creator arm, which has signed 130 talents to date. On the commercial side, Poh pointed to performance-driven partnerships with Lazada and Pizza Hut, one of which had to pause mid-campaign when demand for a new cheesy pizza outstripped supply.</p>\n<p>\n\t“There’s no playbook to follow. We’re inventing it as we go — scary and exciting,” Poh said, closing with a call for partners “who share that excitement” to collaborate with Mediacorp in Singapore and across the region.</p>\n<div><p>\n\tAll That Matters, which began as a music conference, and has grown to encompass sports, gaming, web3, marketing and content, is celebrating its 20th edition this year.</p></div>\n</div>"

    "body": "<div><p>\n\tForget the tree.</p>\n<p>\n\tThat iconic lone tree from the stage directions in Samuel Beckett’s tragicomic masterwork “<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/waiting-for-godot/\">Waiting for Godot</a>” is offstage in <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/jamie-lloyd/\">Jamie Lloyd</a>’s re-envisioned revival. The polarizing British director who has placed his conceptual stamp on “<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/2023/legit/reviews/a-dolls-house-review-jessica-chastain-broadway-1235548661/\">A Doll’s House</a>,” “<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/2024/legit/reviews/sunset-boulevard-review-nicole-scherzinger-broadway-1236181291/\">Sunset Boulevard</a>” and “<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/2025/legit/reviews/evita-review-rachel-zegler-musical-west-end-1236445000/\">Evita</a>,” again challenges the norms in his latest production, taking on the master of ambiguity, absurdity and minimalism — but with mixed results. \n\t</p>\n<p>\n\tThough Lloyd supplants Beckett’s bleak and barren setting with something brighter, cleaner and cosmic — but minus any “Sunset Boulevard”-style video flourishes this go-round — the play’s existential angst in an irrational world remains as powerful as ever — and perhaps more attractive to new audiences due to the casting.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tThis New York revival is driven by the star power of <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/keanu-reeves/\">Keanu Reeves</a> (of the “The Matrix” and “John Wick” film series), who is making a respectable Broadway bow. Joining him in this earnest project as Beckett’s Sisyphean vagabonds is Reeves’ longtime bud, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/alex-winter/\">Alex Winter</a>, his goofball bro from the loopy time-traveling “Bill & Ted’s Excellent Adventure” films which began in 1989 (the year of Beckett’s death). </p>\n<p>\n\tThis return match-up (“Together again at last!”) has turned the playwright’s vaudevillian clowns into comics of a cooler sort. If not stoner dudes — they are, after all, both 60ish now — they’re more like go-with-the-flow buds with their own relaxed rhythms, encircling speech patterns and genuine bond. Though the two actors have a kind of slacker ease in the nonsensical volleys, this lower temperature approach too often misses the work’s humor, horror and emotional resonance.\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\tWith scraggly hair and beard and a dazed countenance of man waking up from an unspeakable dream, Reeves brings the tender vulnerability to his Estragon (aka Gogo). Sometimes with his arms tightly folded in full pout or for protection, sometimes in a fearful fetal position as if protecting himself from the unknown, he’s a man-child lost in time, space and memory. But the sense of the poet that Gogo once was is absent here — and Gogo needs to be a soul worth saving.</p>\n<p>\n\tHowever, Winter’s unbowed Vladimir (aka Didi) is. He’s clearly the driver here as the duo patiently and impatiently wait for the mysterious Godot to arrive. Didi considers his tasks to be: staying the course, keeping the faith, buoying his buddy, and clinging to hope, despite a hopeless loop of disappointments and deferrals.</p>\n<p>\n\tWinter’s face has the weathered look of a person whose struggles for survival in a cruel and violent world have taken its toll. In the end his Didi hangs by a thread as he movingly faces the void, realizing that taking it one day at a time is a life sentence he can barely endure and yet he does.</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd about that void: Beckett’s country road is replaced here with a giant spiral structure that encompasses the stage, designed by Soutra Gilmour. It’s a stunning and glistening setting — perhaps it’s an ivory pipeline to the universe or maybe the eye of God or whatever one projects. Though shocking at first sight for this play’s familiar landscape, it also feels thematically fitting.</p>\n<p>\n\tJon Clark’s no-place-to-hide lighting unnervingly brightens Beckett’s shadowy world but without losing its sense of dread, allowing both light and dark at the end of this infinite tunnel. The actors also make great physical use of the epic curvature, comically sliding, slipping and cradling themselves to sleep though they’re more often than not swallowed up in the setting that severely limits the playing field.</p>\n<p>\n\tBreaking into the duo’s static world are Brandon J. Dirden as the pompous interloper Pozzo and Michael Patrick Thornton as his almost-silent, strangely masked slave Lucky.  Dirden brings many colors to the indulgent bombast of this self-centered sociopath, his fascistic brutality disguised as hollow civility. He’s repellent but Dirden makes it so we can’t take our eyes off him.\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\tBut Lloyd’s awkward staging here and questionable affectations (including an audience clap-along) makes Pozzo’s relationship with Lucky unfocused and puzzling. Beckett’s symbols of master and slave — the whip, the rope, the servant weighed down with baggage — are either mimed or cut and in doing so lose its real horror. </p>\n<p>\n\tThornton uses a wheelchair, and here his Lucky is guided by his tormentor. But the character’s state of servitude is largely hidden in clumsy blocking. Thornton, however, is magnificent in Lucky’s epic “thinking” tirade, a babbling aria with its own inner logic.</p>\n<p>\n\tZaynn Arora as the boy messenger (Eric Williams in alternate performances) who delivers the news of  Godot’s postponement is suitably fragile, fearful and haunting.</p>\n<p>\n\tOne might also wonder what Beckett — whose strict oversight of productions was legendary — would make of Reeves and Winter’s air-guitar riff, echoing the duo’s signature stance from their film partnership. (Robin Williams also tossed pop-culture references into <a href=\"https://www.lct.org/shows/waiting-for-godot/\" target=\"_blank\">a 1988 production</a> in which he was paired with Steve Martin.) Certainly many in the audience love it. Purists not so much — but this production is clearly not meant for them.</p>\n<p>\n\tStill, as a resigned Didi says, “the essential doesn’t change.” Whether on stages in post-war Europe, a hall in San Quentin, or on a pandemic Zoom, Beckett’s wandering refugees and their desperate need to be seen as they search for meaning, purpose and hope continue to find fresh relevance. In the current dystopia, this evergreen play and provocative production may just be worth the wait.</p>\n</div>"
