    "body": "<div><p>\n\t<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/june-squibb/\">June Squibb</a> is set to host the upcoming <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/oxygen/\">Oxygen</a> true crime series “Killer Grannies,” <em>Variety</em> has learned exclusively. </p>\n<p>\n\tThe show was first announced as part of the cabler’s slate back in May. It is due to premiere on Oxygen later this year, though no official premiere date has been set at the time of this publishing. The official logline for the show states: </p>\n<p>\n\t“A true-crime series that chronicles the most shocking and unpredictable cases involving a killer no one would suspect: Grandma. In every self-contained episode, a rollercoaster ride of a case unfolds as investigators dig deep and chase every lead until they finally catch their unexpected killer. Through gripping archival footage, selective recreations and cinematic imagery, and in-depth interviews with investigators, prosecutors, friends and family, every episode will peel back the plastic cover on the couch to uncover a world of sinister plots and evil deeds unpacking why and how these maternal matriarchs of the family can turn deadly.” \n\t</p>\n<p>\n\tSquibb is a much beloved and highly celebrated actress with a stage and screen career spanning seven decades. She began working on Broadway in the 1950s, while she made her feature film debut in 1990. She received an Oscar nomination for best supporting actress for her role in the 2013 Alexander Payne film “Nebraska” in addition to numerous other accolades and nominations. In 2024, she played the first leading film role of her career in “Thelma,” playing a woman who falls victim to a phone scam and sets out to retrieve her money. Squibb has also appeared in episodes of shows like “Shameless,” “American Horror Stories,” “Modern Family,” “Glee,” and “Good Girls.” \n\t</p>\n<p>\n\tShe is repped by Innovative Artists. </p>\n<p>\n\t“Killer Grannies” is produced by Jarrett Creative. Seth Jarrett, Julie Insogna Jarrett and Josh Bingham serve as executive producers.</p>\n</div>"

    "body": "<div><p>\n\t<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/jessica-chastain/\">Jessica Chastain</a> has released a statement regarding the postponement of her Apple TV+ series, “<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/the-savant/\">The Savant</a>,” saying she is “not aligned” with the streamer “on the decision to pause the release.”</p>\n<p>\n\tOn Tuesday, it was announced that Apple will withhold the series from its planned Sept. 26 release, a decision that was largely contextualized by the recent murder of right-wing political commentator Charlie Kirk. In “The Savant,” Chastain plays an undercover investigator who infiltrates online hate groups to prevent domestic extremism.\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\tThe Oscar winner emphasized that, while she “values” her partnership with Apple and “deeply respects” their team, she does not agree with delaying the series.\n</p>\n<p>\n\t“In the last five years since we’ve been making the show, we’ve seen an unfortunate amount of violence in the United States: the kidnapping attempt on Michigan Governor Gretchen Whitmer; the January 6th attack on the Capitol; the assassination attempts on President Trump; the political assassinations of Democratic representatives in Minnesota; the attack on Speaker Pelosi’s husband; the assassination of conservative commentator Charlie Kirk; the recent shooting at an ABC affiliate station in California; and over 300 school shootings across this country,” Chastain <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/DO_V2EyEZmj/\" target=\"_blank\">wrote on Instagram</a>. “These incidents, though far from encompassing the full range of violence witnessed in the United States, illustrate a broader mindset that crosses the political spectrum and must be confronted. I’ve never shied away from difficult subjects, and while I wish this show wasn’t so relevant, unfortunately it is.”\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\tChastain continued, “‘The Savant’ is about the heroes who work every day to stop violence before it happens, and honoring their courage feels more urgent than ever. While I respect Apple’s decision to pause the release for now, I remain hopeful the show will reach audiences soon. Until then, I’m wishing safety and strength for everyone, and I’ll let you know if and when ‘The Savant’ is released.”</p>\n<p>\n\tWriting about Apple’s decision to halt the show’s release, <em>Variety</em> chief TV critic <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/2025/tv/columns/apple-postponing-savant-charlie-kirk-huge-mistake-1236527471/\">Aramide Tinubu argued</a> that “The Savant” is “precisely the type of show America needs right now.” While, she wrote, the show does not mention Donald Trump’s name, “it seems that Apple TV+ is cowering to a presidential administration that appears to be more concerned with its own dialogue and viewpoints. As ‘The Savant’ suggests, if we continue to exist in vacuums, unwilling to hear and listen to others while using logic and sound facts, then we are part of the problem.”<br /></p>\n</div>"

    "body": "<div><p>\n\tThe ninth Pingyao Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon International Film Festival opened inside the 14th-century Chinese walled city on Tuesday with a celebration of Shanxi province’s cinematic legacy, live music, dance and the presentation of its signature East-West award to director <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/feng-xiaogang/\">Feng Xiaogang</a>.</p>\n<p>\n\tProceedings took place at the Platform open-air theatre, a 1,500-seat venue named after <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/jia-zhangke/\">Jia Zhangke</a>’s 2000 film. Indie band Orange Ocean launched the evening with “Summer Cozy Rock,” followed by a montage of landmark Shanxi-set films, ranging from Zhang Yimou’s “Raise the Red Lantern” to Jia’s own “Platform” and “Ash Is Purest White.” A stylized dance based on an ancient sacrificial ritual added a cultural flourish before the program concluded with the world premiere of Zhang Dalei’s short “Happy New Year Mr. Wood.”\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\tFestival founder, Shanxi native Jia Zhangke, welcomed the audience, noting that this year’s lineup spans 53 films from 20 territories, including 30% world premieres and 62% Asian premieres. He also flagged the special showcase “People Will Triumph,” devoted to films about the Chinese resistance during World War II.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tThe Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon East-West Award, which honors achievements in cinema and contributions to the development of East-West film culture, was presented in two parts. First, a career recognition went to Nogami Teruyo, the 98-year-old Japanese producer, script supervisor and author who collaborated extensively with Kurosawa Akira on classics from “Rashomon” through “Ran.” Nogami, unable to travel, sent a letter of thanks that was read aloud on stage.\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\tThe award was also bestowed on Feng Xiaogang, recognized for his contributions to Chinese cinema across comedy, drama and historical epics. Writer-producer Liu Zhenyun and director Guan Hu presented the trophy to Feng, who received a standing ovation. “Making films is a long road that requires persistence,” Feng said, adding that he would continue his creative journey.</p>\n<p>\n\tActor <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/yao-chen/\">Yao Chen</a>, serving as a jury member for the Rossellini Honor Award, told the audience: “The last time I came to Pingyao was as an actress; this time I’m here as a jury member. Next time, I hope I can come purely as a tourist.” She said she looked forward to connecting with young directors and drawing inspiration from their work.</p>\n<p>\n\tPop singer Wu Mochou later performed the theme from “The Banquet,” bringing a mainstream note to the otherwise auteur-driven evening.</p>\n<p>\n\tThe night also previewed Bi Gan’s “Resurrection,” starring Jackson Yee, Shu Qi and Zhao Youting, which bowed earlier this year at Cannes and is now set for its China launch at Pingyao.</p>\n<div><p>\n\tWith its mix of heritage, star power and international reach, Pingyao once again underscored its ambition to serve as a bridge between Chinese and global independent cinema.</p></div>\n</div>"

    "body": "<div><p>\n\tA Golden Gate Bridge that’s a glowing shade of lavender. A cupcake that cries not tears but sprinkles. A psychedelic Day-Glo underwater dance-pop number that’s like Busby Berkeley meets “Bubble Guppies.” A set of miniature cat friends so neatly decorated they look like they were acquired on Etsy. A winter wonderland made entirely of frosting, with pink cotton-candy clouds and a donut raft and giant Gummy worms that arrive with the momentousness of the sandworms in “Dune.”\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\tI could tell you that “Gabby’s Dollhouse: The Movie” is all about how Gabby (Laila Lockhart Kraner), who is now old enough to leave her kiddie dreams behind, teams up with her girlhood kitty friends, the Gabby Cats, to take control of the Dollhouse back from Vera (<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/kristen-wiig/\">Kristen Wiig</a>), a high-camp, high-vamp cat lady who has lost touch with the child within. I could tell you about how the movie, which bounces off the idea that playthings will feel abandoned when their child owners grow up, is like “Toy Story” meets “Trolls” meets a confectionary version of “Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs.” (I should add that it’s wispy enough to make each of those look like a Dickens novel.)\n</p>\n<p>\n\tReally, though, “Gabby’s Dollhouse: The Movie” is about the <em>textures</em> — the fun of spending 90 minutes in a child’s universe that feels like it wasn’t so much animated as baked. Going into the movie, I knew nothing of the DreamWorks Animation series that premiered on Netflix in 2021. But by the time “Gabby’s Dollhouse” was over, I felt like the Gabby Cats were my friends too. The movie, make no mistake, is a genial throwaway that skitters through incidents with a G-rated innocuousness that makes it perfect for a very pint-sized demo. Yet the design of it is captivating, and so, in a minor way, is the affection with which the film’s director, Ryan Crego, embraces childhood things.  \n\t</p>\n<p>\n\tGabby starts out as a live human, played by the series’ star, Laila Lockhart Kraner, who is now 17, but it’s a bit awkward having someone who looks like they’re getting ready to apply to college interfacing with three-inch-high cat toys. So as Gabby embarks on a road trip with her Grandma Gigi (Gloria Estefan) to the city of Cat Francisco, she becomes a girlish animated version of herself. Standouts in the cat-boutique vocal cast include Donovan Patton as the acerbic CatRat, Julien Donenfield as Cakey the cupcake, and Maggie Lowe as the innocent Baby Box, who’s got a head like a small house.</p>\n<p>\n\tAs for Kristen Wiig, in white hair and a purple turban and an outfit dominated by billowy purple leather sleeves, she does a version of the stylish misanthropic kitsch camping that has served actors from Emma Thompson in “Cruella” to Gal Gadot in “Snow White.” Wiig’s Vera, the CEO of a kitty-litter company, isn’t <em>such</em> a villain — her crime is that she’s forgotten how to play and wants to turn the Gabby Cats into collectibles (which, in a way, is just what they are).</p>\n<p>\n\tThe antagonist who comes to the fore is Chumsley (Jason Mantzoukas), the orange cat with pink yarn for whiskers, who was so hurt when Vera grew up and abandoned him that he has become a wounded megalomaniac, speaking in a lisp of anger. The resolution of this that takes place in that winter wonderland, atop a rickety footbridge made of sugar wafers, is mildly touching, though it’s such a knockoff of the “Toy Story” films that that becomes part of the candified simulacrum of it all.</p>\n<p>\n\tIn a funny way, kiddie adventures where animation meets live action are becoming more and more about their own world-building. “Gabby’s Dollhouse” is the definition of slight, but like “A Minecraft Movie” it invites the audience to imagine itself into a universe where objects have to be imagined to life.

    "body": "<div><p>\n\tThere isn’t a dry eye in All Saints Chapel on Thursday and Friday’s “<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/general-hospital/\">General Hospital</a>” episodes, as family, friends and colleagues gather to honor Dr. Monica Quartermaine, who passed away peacefully in her sleep last week. The emotion on screen was real — <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/2025/tv/news/leslie-charleson-general-hospital-dies-79-1236272564/\">Leslie Charleson</a>, who’d brought Monica to life since 1977, died in January at 79, making these scenes a farewell to both the character and the actress.</p>\n<p>\n\t“It was very, very difficult to play her alive when she had already passed in real life. It extended the mourning because we had to keep her alive when she wasn’t,” says <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/jane-elliot/\">Jane Elliot</a>, who plays Tracy Quartermaine, Monica’s sister-in-law. “I had to mourn her death twice.”\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\tGet out the tissues — you’re going to need them. The memorial service begins quietly. Jason (Steve Burton), who was raised by Monica, waits in the chapel to greet mourners, his grief written on his face. Looking at Monica’s photo, his eyes fill with tears. He admits to Elizabeth (Rebecca Herbst) that he regrets the distance he once kept from the Quartermaines, but she reassures him that living at the mansion this past year meant the world to Monica. She loved having her son under her roof.</p>\n<div>\n<figure>\n<p><img srcset=\"https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/GENERAL-HOSPITAL-Steve-Burton.jpg 2754w, https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/GENERAL-HOSPITAL-Steve-Burton.jpg?resize=150,102 150w, https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/GENERAL-HOSPITAL-Steve-Burton.jpg?resize=300,203 300w\" src=\"https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/GENERAL-HOSPITAL-Steve-Burton.jpg?w=1024\" alt=\"\" />\n\t</p>\n<figcaption>\n\t\t\t\t\t<span>“Steve Burton (Jason) was very close with her as well,” Elliot says of his relationship with Charleson, his TV mom.</span>\n\t</figcaption>\n</figure>\n</div>\n<p>\n\tAt the Quartermaine mansion — as seen in the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/exclusive/\">exclusive</a> video — Brook Lynn (Amanda Setton) tells Chase (Josh Swickard) she understands why Tracy ran off to Atlantic City presumably to avoid going to Monica’s funeral. Brook Lynn understands her grandmother not wanting to show her grief in public, says everyone has to mourn in their own way. Ned (Wally Kurth) flashes back to his own complicated history with Monica and admits to Olivia (Lisa LoCicero) that he still feels her presence everywhere in the house.\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\tSlowly, the mourners arrive at the church: the Qs, Michael (Rory Gibson), Portia (Brook Kerr), Stella (Vernee Watson), Felicia (Kristina Wagner), Lucy (Lynn Herring), Lulu (Alexa Havins), Gio (Giovanni Mazza), Laura (Genie Francis) and Lois (Rena Sofer), each remembering how Monica shaped their lives. Tracy looks at the photo of Monica and struggles with her emotions. When Ned thanks Michael for greeting everyone, he learns Jason has been quietly doing it — something that deeply touches Tracy, who tells him he’s made his mother proud.</p>\n<p>\n\tAs the service begins, all eyes turn to Tracy, worried she’ll sneak off, unable to deal with the reality of Monica’s death. But she takes a steadying breath, nods, and steps inside the chapel. One by one, Monica’s loved ones share stories, laughter mixing with tears. Ned doesn’t know how they’ll get by without Monica, but at least today they don’t have to. He takes paper from his pocket, revealing that Monica left one final message for them all.</p>\n<div>\n<figure>\n<p><img srcset=\"https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/GENERAL-HOSPITAL-Quartermaines.jpg 2212w, https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/GENERAL-HOSPITAL-Quartermaines.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/GENERAL-HOSPITAL-Quartermaines.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/GENERAL-HOSPITAL-Quartermaines.jpg?resize=1920,1280 1920w, https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/GENERAL-HOSPITAL-Quartermaines.jpg?resize=1360,907 1360w, https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/GENERAL-HOSPITAL-Quartermaines.jpg?resize=1000,667 1000w, https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/GENERAL-HOSPITAL-Quartermaines.jpg?resize=910,607 910w, https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/GENERAL-HOSPITAL-Quartermaines.jpg?resize=681,454 681w, https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/GENERAL-HOSPITAL-Quartermaines.jpg?resize=450,300 450w, https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/GENERAL-HOSPITAL-Quartermaines.jpg?resize=250,167 250w\" src=\"https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/GENERAL-HOSPITAL-Quartermaines.jpg?w=1024\" alt=\"\" />\n\t</p>\n<figcaption>\n\t\t\t\t\t<span>The Quartermaine family on ABC’s “General Hospital”</span>\n\t</figcaption>\n</figure>\n</div>\n<p>\n\t“Leslie left two voids in my life,” Elliot says. “She left a void as an acting partner and a friend. Leslie and I knew each other for 60 years. We met in 1965. I was 18 and she was 20, and she was dating a boy in a play that I was in in New York City. She would come to the theater on Saturdays and hang out in my dressing room and wait for him to be done so that they could go out to dinner between shows. We would sit and gab, and she’d watch me put on my makeup. We had a lot of shared experience and stuff to talk about. And then we lost touch. And in 1978 I got hired to play Tracy [on ‘GH’] only to discover that I was to play her sister-in-law.”</p>\n<div>\n<figure>\n<p><img srcset=\"https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/LESLIE-AND-JANE_100760_4569.jpg 3000w, https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/LESLIE-AND-JANE_100760_4569.jpg?resize=150,105 150w, https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/LESLIE-AND-JANE_100760_4569.jpg?resize=300,210 300w\" src=\"https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/LESLIE-AND-JANE_100760_4569.jpg?w=1024\" alt=\"\" />\n\t</p>\n<figcaption>\n\t\t\t\t\t<span>Stuart Damon (Alan), <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/leslie-charleson/\">Leslie Charleson</a> (Monica), Jane Elliot (Tracy) and Jed Allan (Edward).</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t©2004 American Broadcasting Com\n\t</figcaption>\n</figure>\n</div>\n<p>\n\tElliot and Charleson became very good friends off the set, even as their “GH” characters were constantly bickering. They took trips together, had birthday parties for each other, and when Elliot got married, Charleson gave her a wedding shower. “She was an integral part of my life…It’s hard enough to mourn somebody’s death once, but then to do it again. One was obviously the person, and the other was the character, but at a certain point they blended. You know, Monica was Leslie, and Leslie was Monica. I had shared experience with Monica, and I had shared experience with Leslie, so she left me twice.”\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\tMonica’s death is hitting Tracy especially hard. When Tracy was introduced onto the show, her brother Alan was already married to Monica, who Tracy thought was beneath him in stature and in place in society. She mocked and diminished her for years. “And then everybody [in Tracy’s life] died — Alan died, Lila died. Edward died. And Monica and Tracy were the last two standing,” she explains.</p>\n<p>\n\t“Monica had been the head of the hospital, and Monica had been a successful surgeon. Monica was on the board. And Tracy started to see her as an equal. Tracy had evolved over the years and was a more substantive human being and had gone through the heartbreak of losing Luke twice, and she developed a fuller personality. Because of that, she could see Monica’s weight and respected her for it.”</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd now, Tracy stands alone. “It’s a huge loss for her. All of her contemporaries are gone. Her mother, her father, her brother, Luke, Gregory,” Elliot says. “I mean, Monica was it. They were the last two standing hand in hand, side by side. So losing her was like losing an arm.”</p>\n<p>\n\tWill Tracy be able to put on a brave face and share her deep emotions by speaking at Monica’s service? “She’s adamant she’s not going to do it, but there are a lot of people who really want her to do it,” she says. “The question is, will someone get her to change her mind?”</p>\n<div>\n<figure>\n<p><img srcset=\"https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/GENERAL-HOSPITAL-Monica-Funeral-Genie-Francis.jpg 1000w, https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/GENERAL-HOSPITAL-Monica-Funeral-Genie-Francis.jpg?resize=150,102 150w, https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/GENERAL-HOSPITAL-Monica-Funeral-Genie-Francis.jpg?resize=300,203 300w\" src=\"https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/GENERAL-HOSPITAL-Monica-Funeral-Genie-Francis.jpg\" alt=\"\" />\n\t</p>\n<figcaption>\n\t\t\t\t\t<span>Laura (Genie Francis) shares loving thoughts at Monica’s memorial service.</span>\n\t</figcaption>\n</figure>\n</div>\n</div>"
