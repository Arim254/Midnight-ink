    "body": "<div><p>\n\t<em><strong>SPOILER ALERT</strong>: This story contains spoilers for Season 2, Episode 5 of “<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/gen-v/\">Gen V</a>,” now streaming on Amazon’s Prime Video.</em></p>\n<p>\n\tThis week’s episode of “Gen V,” titled “The Kids Are Not All Right,” might just as easily be named “Escape From Elmira,” as the plot centers around Marie (Jaz Sinclair) & co.’s attempt to save Cate (<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/maddie-phillips/\">Maddie Phillips</a>) from the depths of the evil supe containment center.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tCate is made to take the fall for the plan to expose Cipher (Hamish Linklater) in Episode 4, and Marie can’t handle knowing that Cate is stuck in Elmira. While Jordan (London Thor/Derek Luh) and Emma (Lizze Broadway) are willing to let it go — noting all the horrible things Cate has brought on them — Marie insists they cannot let Cate go through what they did in the place where Andre (Chance Perdomo) died, or they are no better than their enemies at Vought.\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\tThey do reach her and she’s overwhelmed with gratitude for their efforts — but then they are all caught. Cate then rises to the occasion and facilitates their ultimate escape, with Sam (Asa Germann) even joining them along the way.</p>\n<p>\n\t<em>Variety</em> spoke with Phillips about filming the episode and how the ending — which features not only a reunion between Marie and her sister, Annabeth, but a scene in which Marie uses her extreme power to bring her sister back to life after Cipher has her killed in Elmira — affects Cate and “<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/the-boys/\">The Boys</a>” spinoff crew moving forward.</p>\n\t<h5>\n\t\tWhat was it like for you filming the scenes where Cate is sent to Elmira by Cipher as punishment for what she did in Episode 4? She’s required to strip down, go through a cavity search and be aggressively physically handled by the guards.\t</h5>\n<p>\n\tI had never done anything on screen that was so exposing in that way. Thankfully, I’m so grateful for the crew that we have; everybody is just so incredibly skilled at not only what they do, but also making us feel really comfortable. I’m always really blown away at how the crew is always there long before the actors get to set, and they always are the ones with impeccable energy. They set the tone in a really beautiful way. And it’s important when you’re doing vulnerable scenes like that to feel really safe so that you can fully surrender. I felt so looked after and so respected, because I’ve never done anything like that. I mean, I had to have tape in places I’ve never had tape before! What’s really interesting, though, is how quickly you desensitize in those situations.\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\tAt first, my adrenals were going, my nervous system was really activated. And then I found that I wasn’t looking for costumes or the intimacy coordinator to come over and bring me my robe when I was standing there. What’s so interesting about that is I do remember feeling not like a woman, not like a person, which was quite jarring. You just sort of become a thing with skin. That’s really interesting when you think about how Cate would have been feeling — not only in Elmira, but just now that she’s had her arm blasted off, now that she’s got these staples in her head. Because I really found, even as an actor, how dehumanizing it made me feel. Which just goes to show how incredibly privileged we are being able bodied and being able to wake up feeling like you can make yourself look a certain way in order to align yourself with whatever identity you’ve decided is the one you’re rocking with in your life.</p>\n<p>\n\tIt was really interesting to experience the sensations of, not only really raw vulnerability, but also a quick desensitization, and that helped me in my performance. Because you start on one side of the line, which is panic and feeling vulnerable in survival mode, and then that survival mode switches, and you’re on the other side. You’re desensitized and you’re numb, and that’s how you can compartmentalize. I definitely feel like I used that numb desensitization in my performance as well, and I really didn’t find like I had to act too much by the end of it.</p>\n\t<h5>\n\t\tIn the final moments, Marie, Cate, Jordan and Emma go to save Marie’s little sister, Annabeth, after Marie discovers she’s still alive and trapped in Elmira. But when they arrive, Annabeth has bled out to death on the floor. Marie uses her powers to revive Annabeth’s body, while everyone else looks on in awe. What do you think Cate was feeling during all of that, after having been rescued by the team?\t</h5>\n<p>\n\tI decided on the day that there’s going to be just so much empathy and sympathy for Marie. I think Cate was flooded with gratitude that they came and got her. And she knows Marie’s heart, she knows that everybody has just been trying in their own ways to do the right thing, and nobody’s out here being a villain. Even though Marie blew her arm off and everything, she knows more than anybody that things happen because of where our perspectives are being directed and whatnot. Whether it was her ability to hear thoughts or just knowing Marie’s character, she just knows that this was an incredibly huge moment for Marie to find her sister. She knows the context of the situation. She hasn’t known where her sister has been for a very long time. And knowing how it feels to have a sibling disappear and have it be your fault, I think it was just a huge moment of deep empathy and just really feeling for her. Cate was having sort of like a secret bonding moment with Marie, even though Marie was not even thinking of her in that moment.\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\t<em>This interview has been edited and condensed.</em></p>\n</div>"

    "body": "<div><div>\n<p>\n\t<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/james-cameron/\">James Cameron</a> prefers not to revisit his movies after they’ve opened in theaters. “I usually have a moratorium of a couple of years where I just don’t want to think about it,” he says. “There’s a certain point when you’ve been away from where you could start to be more of an audience and less of a picky filmmaker.”</p>\n<p>\n\tThe filmmaker had to break that rule, however, with 2022’s “<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/avatar-the-way-of-water/\">Avatar: The Way of Water</a>,” because of the impending release of the third film in the series, “<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/avatar-fire-and-ash/\">Avatar: Fire and Ash</a>,” in December. </p>\n</div>\n<p>\n\t“We’re going through the finish of the VFX now [on “Fire and Ash”] — we have been, really, for the last two years, but we’re really coming down to the wire now,” he says. “And I want to be thematically consistent about the way music was used and underscore during dialogue scenes and things like that. So I have rewatched it. It’s a pretty good ride, I have to say!”</p>\n<p>\n\tAudiences will have their own chance to re-watch “The Way of Water” on the big screen on Oct. 3, with the film — which grossed $2.3 billion worldwide — <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/2025/film/news/avatar-way-of-water-screenings-fire-and-ash-footage-1236529491/\">is re-released into theaters</a> in anticipation of “Fire and Ash.” The former film traces the family saga of Jake Sully (Sam Worthington) and Neytiri (Zoe Saldaña) after the events of 2009’s “Avatar,” when they defeated the military assault on the Na’vi by Col. Miles Quaritch (Stephen Lang). In the sequel, set 16 years later, Jake and Neytiri have a clan of five children, including an adopted daughter, Kiri (Sigourney Weaver), born from the inert Na’vi avatar of Weaver’s deceased human character from the 2009 film, Dr. Grace Augustine, and a quasi-adopted human son, Spider (Jack Champion), who was orphaned when his biological parents, including Quaritch, died in battle. Quaritch is resurrected in “The Way of Water” into his own Na’vi avatar, and he resumes his relentless pursuit of the Sully family, which puts Spider in the middle of the conflict.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tIn an interview with <em>Variety</em>, Cameron discussed what else from “The Way of Water” will pay off in “Fire and Ash,” the major change he made to “Fire and Ash” after he’d finished filming, how the future of the “Avatar” franchise (Disney has a fourth and fifth film dated for 2029 and 2031) could affect his plans to <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/2024/film/news/james-cameron-ghosts-of-hiroshima-last-train-from-film-1236146096/\">direct a feature adaptation of the book</a> “Ghosts of Hiroshima,” and why he is working to make the visual effects process a more “creative culture.” (Note: This interview was conducted on Sept. 26, before the controversy started over AI performance simulation Tilly Norwood.)\n\t</p>\n<div>\n<figure>\n<p><img srcset=\"https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/DF-116378_R2.jpg 6240w, https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/DF-116378_R2.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/DF-116378_R2.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/DF-116378_R2.jpg?resize=1920,1280 1920w, https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/DF-116378_R2.jpg?resize=1360,907 1360w, https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/DF-116378_R2.jpg?resize=1000,667 1000w, https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/DF-116378_R2.jpg?resize=910,607 910w, https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/DF-116378_R2.jpg?resize=681,454 681w, https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/DF-116378_R2.jpg?resize=450,300 450w, https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/DF-116378_R2.jpg?resize=250,167 250w\" src=\"https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/DF-116378_R2.jpg?w=1024\" alt=\"\" />\n\t</p>\n<figcaption>\n\t\t\t\t\t<span>James Cameron on the set of “Avatar: The Way of Water.”</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMark Fellman / 20th Century Studios\n\t</figcaption>\n</figure>\n</div>\n\t<h5>\n\t\tWhen you re-watch your films, do you find that allows you to discover new things about the movie that you hadn’t noticed before?\t</h5>\n<p>\n\tIt does in the sense that you start to realize how much of filmmaking is subconscious and can’t be quantified. My job all day long is to quantify minutia. I’m looking at a VFX shot: “OK, you see the way his foot comes down on that one fern and the way it brushes aside. I’m not quite buying that. I think you should re-sim that.” I mean, it’s endless. It’s every detail, every blade of grass, every flicker of fire, all of the lighting interactions, and you get so down into the weeds that it takes stepping back and seeing the film to realize that there’s a big unconscious driver that’s running underneath all of that detail that’s telling you when you’ve got the essence of the moment. And so when I see the film, I go, “Oh, that actually works. I actually feel what I’m supposed to be feeling.” I guess what I see after the fact is, yeah, I get sucked down the rabbit hole of the details, but I don’t sacrifice the essence. </p>\n\t<h5>\n\t\tHow is the VFX process going for you now?\t</h5>\n<p>\n\tIn fact, as I’m working with the VFX people, I’m trying to create a new culture around that — not a technical culture, but a creative culture. When I’m talking to the effects sequence supervisors and the animators and the lighters, it’s like, “What is the most important thing about the shot and why? What is its narrative purpose? What are we saying with this shot? Now, don’t think in shots. Think in flow.” I’m trying to get them to think in flow. Why does this shot exist? I could do anything. I could not have it in the movie. I could have done a completely different shot. Why do you think I did that shot? \n\t</p>\n\t<h5>\n\t\tWhat’s the goal for you?\t</h5>\n<p>\n\tI want them to internalize for themselves that storytelling process. They go way down the rabbit hole, much deeper than me, on the technical side, and are far more capable technically than I am. So I want to give them a little bit of that storytelling magic dust to own for themselves. And it’s working. It started on “The Way of Water,” and it’s continued a lot more on “Fire and Ash.” It’s what I call a first look final. It’s the craziest thing in the world. The creative culture is so strong across all these artists that I can look at a shot for review for the very first time and say “It’s done.” That is the craziest thing. Anybody that’s worked in VFX is going to be saying “Whaaaat?” </p>\n<p>\n\tNow, they may be on version 400 but they’ve had enough input previously that they’re now working within a culture that encourages the creativity and the specificity of our “Avatar” world and our characters. So this idea of really encouraging them to think as storytellers is really paying off. And this is why the Gen AI stuff is never going to take the place of that. We need our artists. It’s artists in control of the process, right? </p>\n<p>\n\tSo it’s actually become a kind of crazily joyful finish. You know, it was a fraught production, let’s face it, but it’s been a kind of a joyful finish, because it’s really starting to resonate and fire on all cylinders, and we’re getting a lot of first look finals, which is nuts.\n\t</p>\n\t<h5>\n\t\tYou shot most of the material for “The Way of Water” and “Fire & Ash” from 2017 to 2019, right?\t</h5>\n<p>\n\tYeah, we started September of 2017. We went for 18 months, but we did both movies, all of it, other than some planned reshoots and some places where I got creative and wrote some new scenes. But the vast majority — call it 95% — was shot in that 18 month window. That was Sigourney playing 15-year-old Kiri across both movies, which actually worked great, because she’s got a story arc across the two movies. There was a kind of a major story arc, where 2 and 3 really tell one big story. And then ultimately, if I get so lucky and I make 4 and 5, 4 and 5 tell one big story. So it kind of stops for a beat after the end of 3. I don’t mean we’ll necessarily stop in production, but the story kind of stops and then it jumps forward in time a little bit.</p>\n\t<h5>\n\t\tSo how that distance affect your relationship to the material? With the kids especially, they’re much older now than when you were first filming.  \t</h5>\n<p>\n\tIt creates this weird cognitive dissonance, where I’m always shocked by how long it’s been since we actually captured the moment. Because there’s a sense of immediacy. I’m<em> in</em> the story, working on this scene. It feels very immediate. I can remember where everybody was standing. I can remember even secondary characters in the background, which of our troop characters played each one of those secondary characters. It feels like I did it last week. It was five or six years ago.</p>\n<p>\n\tFortunately, the cast are just as energetic. I just was doing press with them last week. They’re just as pumped and passionate about their characters and what we’re doing as they ever were, and can’t wait to get on to the next one — if we should get so lucky as to make some money with these now that are being re-released and being released. So the energy is there, the excitement’s still there, but it’s a weird cognitive dissonance.</p>\n<div>\n<figure>\n<p><img srcset=\"https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/AFA-TP-89395.jpg 1600w, https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/AFA-TP-89395.jpg?resize=150,84 150w, https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/AFA-TP-89395.jpg?resize=300,169 300w, https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/AFA-TP-89395.jpg?resize=125,70 125w, https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/AFA-TP-89395.jpg?resize=1000,563 1000w, https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/AFA-TP-89395.jpg?resize=910,511 910w, https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/AFA-TP-89395.jpg?resize=681,383 681w, https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/AFA-TP-89395.jpg?resize=450,253 450w, https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/AFA-TP-89395.jpg?resize=250,140 250w\" src=\"https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/AFA-TP-89395.jpg?w=1024\" alt=\"\" />\n\t</p>\n<figcaption>\n\t\t\t\t\t<span>Sam Worthington in “Avatar: Fire and Ash”</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCourtesy of 20th Century Studios\n\t</figcaption>\n</figure>\n</div>\n\t<h5>\n\t\tDoes that dissonance wind up affecting the film?\t</h5>\n<p>\n\tThe good news is I don’t really second guess my creative impulses. Unless, and this happened a little bit on “Fire and Ash,” I’m looking at it going, you know, I’m not that much of a genius screenwriter. There’s something a little off here in the storytelling. And so, our Toruk is back [in “Fire and Ash”], right? You know, the big bird that Jake rides [in the climax of the first “Avatar”]. I’ve always been waiting for the question, “Why doesn’t he just go get the big red bird and kill everybody like he used to do?” Because that doesn’t exist in “The Way of Water” at all. \n\t</p>\n<p>\n\tI got a big scoop here. It didn’t exist in “Fire and Ash.” And I went, “Oh, he’s got to go get the bird.” Come on! I was saving it for a later film. I was like, “Fuck that! He should get the bird. Get the Toruk.” There’s something in Jake’s destiny that requires it, right? So I just re-wrote it, and we went back and we shot two or three scenes around that concept, and I threw some stuff out and stuck that in. And we’re at three hours, big surprise! But it works beautifully, and the actors were super-excited about that idea. It’s like, oh, okay, that feels right, you know? </p>\n<p>\n\tSo it’s not set in stone. It’s a constantly evolving creative process. And that’s what keeps you vigorous and engaged. </p>\n\t<h5>\n\t\tBased on the “Fire & Ash” trailers, it’s clear that Spider and Kiri play crucial roles in the third film. Are there any other elements introduces in “The Way of Water” that audiences should especially pay attention to when re-watching the film?\t</h5>\n<p>\n\tYou’ve got the primary couple, Jake and Neytiri. Obviously at the end of “The Way of Water” — three years in, I don’t think we have to worry about spoilers — their eldest son dies. In the typical universe of superheroes and so on, grief is not really dealt with, because it’s an impediment to all the cool stuff you want to see. But I thought, Nah, I want to be very authentic about these people emotionally. I want them to be real. I want that to inform and put pressure on their relationship. Because in the real world, when parents lose a child — I’m a parent of five. Sam has three. Zoe has three sons. You know, it’s the inconceivable thing for all of us that we all fear. What would that do? In the real world, it tears marriages apart. There’s blame, there’s grief that gets in the way and a lot of marriages don’t survive that. So we got the ultimate love story, kind of Romeo and Juliet, you know, Smith and Pocahontas on another planet. And then it gets challenged. Are they going to survive as a relationship?</p>\n\t<h5>\n\t\tAnything else?\t</h5>\n<p>\n\tYou’ve got these new characters, Spider, Kiri, Lo’ak, they all come to real fruition in movie 3. But the beautiful thing about this re-release is you get to remind yourself of how important all these relationships are, and then we pay them all off — sometimes for good, sometimes not so good. But the point is, they’re on a greater arc. Kiri’s arc, very important. Spider’s arc, I think you could tell from the trailer, we’re going places with him. He’s also the glue that glues all the other relationships together. Jake and Quaritch, they’d just be two guys trying to kill each other for six hours of two movies. Sorry, that’s boring. Where it gets nuanced is when they’ve got this kid between them, and they’re the two different father figures, and sometimes they have to work together to keep him alive. It becomes much more nuanced as a result of these younger characters. And by the way, if you’re a kid, you’re going follow them. It’s not a family movie about the parents. It’s a family movie about the kids.\n\t</p>\n<div>\n<figure>\n<p><img srcset=\"https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/avatar-2-spider.png 1800w, https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/avatar-2-spider.png?resize=150,100 150w, https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/avatar-2-spider.png?resize=300,200 300w, https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/avatar-2-spider.png?resize=1360,907 1360w, https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/avatar-2-spider.png?resize=1000,667 1000w, https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/avatar-2-spider.png?resize=910,607 910w, https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/avatar-2-spider.png?resize=681,454 681w, https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/avatar-2-spider.png?resize=450,300 450w, https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/avatar-2-spider.png?resize=250,167 250w\" src=\"https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/avatar-2-spider.png?w=1024\" alt=\"\" />\n\t</p>\n<figcaption>\n\t\t\t\t\t<span>Jack Champion in “Avatar: The Way of Water”</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCourtesy of 20th Century Studios\n\t</figcaption>\n</figure>\n</div>\n\t<h5>\n\t\tFinally, what is the timeline for you to direct “Ghosts of Hiroshima”? You’ve said that right now, there’s nothing keeping you from directing the next two “Avatar” movies.\t</h5>\n<p>\n\tWell, I first of all, “Ghosts of Hiroshima” was written by a friend of mine. I gave them permission to announce that I had bought it to turn into a film, but I haven’t written a script yet. So once I get a script I like, then I can answer that question, but that’s not the case right now. Now, I’ve got a couple of other things that haven’t been announced that I also want to do, and it’s a question of — that one [“Ghosts of Hiroshima”] I will direct. Doesn’t matter when I do it, I’ll direct that one. There are others that I may or may not direct. And the big swing in all of this is, do we make any money with “Avatar 3”? I mean, we’ll make some money. But the question is, what kind of a profit margin, if any, is there, and how much of an inducement is that to continue on in this universe? Or maybe we wait a while until we figure out how to bring costs down. Because production costs have spiraled over the last few years, especially in VFX. Everything’s gone up an enormous amount, and it’s starting to close out the type of films that I like to make. </p>\n<p>\n\tSo there’s an argument for taking a pause and figuring that out. There’s an argument for going out and doing some smaller, more personal film in the meantime, while that gets figured out. There’s an argument, in wild success, for us just launching and just going straight into [“Avatar 4” and “Avatar 5”] and I figure out a production methodology where I have a bit of a hiatus where I can make another film. And there’s another argument that says just go make those two damn movies and figure everything else out when I’m 80.</p>\n\t<h5>\n\t\tSo where are you in those arguments?\t</h5>\n<p>\n\tIf you’re interpreting from that that I’m at a bit of a crossroads here — it’s not all mapped out. You know, life isn’t like that. I <em>am</em> at a bit of a crossroads here, and I’m going to have to see what draws me to what as I go forward. The only thing I can tell you right now, I’m not going to stop being a director and a storyteller. That’s the only thing I can confirm at this stage.\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\t<em>This interview has been edited and condensed.</em></p>\n</div>"

The first season of the series, which debuted on <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/apple-tv-2/\">Apple TV+</a> in 2024, was based on the book of the same name by Scott Turow. The second season will be based on the book “Dissection of a Murder” by Jo Murray, which is due to be published in 2026.\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\tExact plot and character details are being kept under wraps, but the description from publisher Pan Macmillan states, “When Leila Reynolds (Brosnahan) is handed her first murder case, she’s shocked at how high-profile it is: the murder of a well-respected, well-known judge. This shouldn’t be the kind of case she’s leading; it’s way beyond her expertise. But the defendant, Jack Millman, is clear. He wants her, and only her.”\n</p>\n<p>\n\tThis marks Shaw’s second series with Apple TV+, following her role in the dark comedy “Bad Sisters.” Shaw previously received two Emmy nominations for her role in “Killing Eve” and another for “Fleabag.” Her other recent TV roles include “True Detective: Night Country,” “Andor,” and “Baptiste.” In film, she is known for starring in the “Harry Potter” franchise, “My Left Foot,” and “Enola Holmes,” among others.

    "body": "<div><p>\n\tDonald Trump’s former campaign manager Corey Lewandowski appeared on Benny Johnson’s web interview series “The Benny Show” and warned that ICE agents will be present at the 2026 <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/super-bowl/\">Super Bowl</a>, where <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/bad-bunny/\">Bad Bunny</a> is <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/2025/music/news/bad-bunny-to-perform-2026-super-bowl-halftime-show-1236533627/\">set to perform</a> the Halftime Show.</p>\n<p>\n\tNotably, the Halftime Show, presented by Apple Music, is Bad Bunny’s only U.S. concert appearance that’s set for 2026 at this time, as his highly-anticipated Debí Tirar Más Fotos World Tour, which is scheduled to run from December through July 2026, is not stopping in the states. Bad Bunny told <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://i-d.co/article/bad-bunny-puerto-rico-residency-issue-375-cover/\">I-D magazine</a> last month that his fear of ICE raids was part of the reason why he skipped touring in the U.S.\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\tWhen Johnson asked Lewandowski if “ICE will have enforcement at the Super Bowl” where Bad Bunny is performing, the Trump advisor responded: “There is nowhere you can provide safe haven to people who are in this country illegally. Not the Super Bowl and nowhere else. We will find you and apprehend you and put you in a detention facility and deport you. Know that is a very real situation under this administration, which is contrary to how it used to be.”\n</p>\n<p>\n\tLewandowski has long been in Trump’s inner circle, first working as his campaign manager in 2016. He returned to the president’s campaign in 2024. Since Trump’s election, he has aligned himself with the Department of Homeland Security and Secretary Kristi Noem, serving as an adviser to DHS as a special government employee in the department.</p>\n<p>\n\t“It’s so shameful they’ve decided to pick somebody who seems to hate America so much to represent them at the Halftime Show,” Lewandowski said about Bad Bunny. “We should be trying to be inclusive, not exclusive. There are plenty of great bands and entertainment people who could be playing at that show that would be bringing people together and not separating them.”\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\tHe concluded, “If there are illegal aliens, I don’t care if it’s a concert for Johnny Smith or Bad Bunny or anybody else. … We’re going to do enforcement everywhere. We are going to make Americans safe. That is a directive from the president. If you’re in this country illegally, go home.”</p>\n<p>\n\tSpeaking to I-D last month, Bad Bunny explained that part of the reason he did his Puerto Rico residency and will continue to tour around the world without stopping in the U.S. is because “fucking ICE could be outside [my concert]. And it’s something that we were talking about and very concerned about.”</p>\n<p>\n\t“There were many reasons why I didn’t show up in the U.S., and none of them were out of hate — I’ve performed there many times,” he added. “All of [the shows] have been successful. All of them have been magnificent. I’ve enjoyed connecting with Latinos who have been living in the U.S. But specifically, for a residency here in Puerto Rico, when we are an unincorporated territory of the U.S. … People from the U.S. could come here to see the show.”</p>\n<p>\n\t<em>Variety </em>has reached out to Apple Music and representatives for Bad Bunny for comment.</p>\n<figure><div>\n<blockquote><div><p>CONFIRMED: ICE will be active and on-site at Bad Bunny’s Super Bowl performance.</p><p>Trump Advisor Corey Lewandowski warns: there’s no place ICE won’t go to remove criminal aliens from the US, even the Super Bowl: </p><p>\"There is nowhere you can provide safe haven to people who are in… <a href=\"https://t.co/kfKlGcuR7Q\" target=\"_blank\">pic.twitter.com/kfKlGcuR7Q</a></p></div>— Benny Johnson (@bennyjohnson) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/bennyjohnson/status/1973410583811604635?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\" target=\"_blank\">October 1, 2025</a></blockquote>\n</div></figure>\n</div>"

    "body": "<div><p>\n\t<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/alexander-skarsgard-2/\">Alexander Skarsgård</a> is still excited that the story in “<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/pillion/\">Pillion</a>” got to be told. </p>\n<p>\n\tHis latest film, directed by Harry Lighton, stars “Harry Potter” alumnus <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/harry-melling/\">Harry Melling</a> as a young gay man, Colin, embarking on a dominant/submissive relationship with a charismatic biker gang leader Ray (Skarsgård).</p>\n<p>\n\t“I found that in this case, it’s not really relevant what my background is. I mean, I do have a kid, but what I’ve done in the past, who I’ve been with, men, women… To me, what was important was that this felt like an opportunity to tell a story about a subculture I hadn’t seen portrayed this way – with so much authenticity,” he said at <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/zurich-film-festival/\">Zurich Film Festival</a>.\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\t“My experience of watching this on screen was through [Al Pacino starrer] ‘Cruising,’ where it’s this dark underbelly of New York City and it’s dangerous, murderous and scary. Leather gays are scary. I’m no Ray, but I have a little bit of experience from that world and I know that’s not the truthful depiction.”\n</p>\n<p>\n\tRobbie Taylor Hunt was the film’s intimacy coordinator. </p>\n<p>\n\t“It wasn’t so much about making sure we were comfortable, because we were too comfortable with each other. But there’s a dramatic narrative in these scenes, which is not always the case. I often find sex on screen quite boring. Usually, all the tension is leading up to that moment, and then once people are in the sack… During Colin’s birthday and that orgy scene, a lot happens emotionally,” he noted.</p>\n<p>\n\t“We wanted it to be clumsy and weird. On screen, it often looks like a ballet, but sex can be awkward and funny.” \n\t</p>\n<p>\n\tHe appreciated that Lighton “didn’t put on silk gloves to tell this story.” </p>\n<p>\n\t“He embraced the awkwardness of it. All these characters were fully fledged and the sex scenes weren’t graphic for the sake of being graphic. We shot way more graphic stuff than you’ve seen just now,” he said. </p>\n<p>\n\t“Harry did a beautiful job of calibrating it. You don’t shy away from it because ‘Oh, we can’t show men having sex,’ but you also don’t show a closeup of a dick just because you can, for the shock value. I think my mom will like this movie, and it’s about kinky gay bikers and a D/s relationship. Portrayed with the perfect amount of respect, but not too much respect.” </p>\n<p>\n\tSkarsgård didn’t know Lighton’s work before making the film. </p>\n<p>\n\t“I want to credit the logline,” he announced. </p>\n<p>\n\t“I hadn’t seen ‘Wren Boys’ or any of Harry’s shorts – didn’t know anything about him. I can’t remember exactly how they summarized the film, but it was something like ‘wallflower Colin meets Ray from a kinky gay biker gang, and this is the beginning of a strange, odd, beautiful love story.’ That piqued my interest.” </p>\n<p>\n\tHe added: “It felt so original, and that’s quite rare. I’ve read great scripts where I’m like: ‘This is great, but it reminds me of 10 films I’ve seen.’ I was invited into this world with so much love and compassion, but he didn’t do it with too much reverence. Sometimes, when you portray a subculture, you’re so worried about offending [someone] or getting something wrong that you’re too precious about it. I immediately called my agents and said: ‘I wanna talk to this mad child.’”</p>\n<p>\n\tHis character, Ray, remains mysterious throughout the film. </p>\n<p>\n\t“I kind of embraced it as an excuse to be very lazy, and not have to come up with a backstory. I liked that he was enigmatic. Harry Melling and I met two days before we started shooting the film. We met rehearsing the wrestling scene, which is a great way to get to know someone,” he laughed. </p>\n<p>\n\t“I did love that Ray was an enigma at the beginning of the film, but also at the end. Reading the script, I was so nervous that at some point, say, Colin discovers Ray has a secret wife and then it’s a big dramatic moment. I was hoping Harry [Lighton] was brave enough not to fall into that, thinking: ‘Don’t disappoint me.’ And he sure didn’t.”\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\tJoking about what usually attracts him to his roles – “Money. Yeah! Capitalism, baby” – Skarsgård admitted he approached intimate scenes with Nicole Kidman in “Big Little Lies” very differently.</p>\n<p>\n\t“On this one, Harry and I were excited about just literally throwing ourselves into that ring. On ‘Big Little Lies,’ it was important for Nicole and I to get to know each other before and really build that trust, because we knew we wanted to shoot in a very safe but authentic way.”</p>\n<p>\n\t“A lot of those scenes are shot with a single camera. The whole scene plays through from the beginning till the end and they are quite violent physically and really difficult emotionally.</p>\n<p>\n\tI would go over to Nicole’s house, play with her kids and just hang out and have lunch and talk. By the time we started shooting, we were like two friends getting into this together.”</p>\n<p>\n\tSo far, the subculture it portrays welcomes “Pillion” with open arms, said Skarsgård, recalling the very first screening at Cannes.  </p>\n<p>\n\t“The bikers in the movie are members of GBMCC, the Gay Bikers Motorcycle Club in the U.K. Five of them drove from London to be there. We had the most extraordinary day and night celebrating together. Paul [Tallis] threw his pup mask on right after the screening.” </p>\n<p>\n\t“We had a joint after party with a Nigerian film where homosexuality is illegal. It was the first Nigerian film ever to play at Cannes Film Festival, so there were ambassadors and politicians from Nigeria – we had our kinky gay bikers in leather harnesses and Paul in his pup mask. It was pretty beautiful to watch,” he said. </p>\n<p>\n\t“If you’re not a [professional] actor, even if you’re proud of the end result, it can be really weird to sit in a movie theater with thousands of people, at the biggest film festival in the world, and watch yourself running around naked on screen. That they were just loving it and felt proud, it meant the world to me.” </p>\n</div>"

    "body": "<div><p>\n\t<strong>SPOILER ALERT</strong><em><strong>:</strong> This article contains spoilers from “Libertá,” the finale of “The Twisted Tale of <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/amanda-knox/\">Amanda Knox</a>,” now streaming on Hulu.</em></p>\n<p>\n\t“<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/the-twisted-tale-of-amanda-knox/\">The Twisted Tale of Amanda Knox</a>” wraps up Amanda Knox’s story with an unlikely reunion between Knox (<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/grace-van-patten/\">Grace Van Patten</a>) and her prosecutor, Giuliano Mignini (Francesco Acquaroli).​</p>\n<p>\n\tThe eight-episode drama has chronicled the true tale of the American college student who was wrongfully convicted of murdering her British roommate, Meredith Kercher, while studying abroad in Italy in 2007. The series revisits the case, retelling the story from Knox’s perspective as she experiences the injustice throughout her 20s and up to the present day.​\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\tAfter being acquitted by an Italian court, some might expect Knox’s story to end there. However, the saga continues with Knox meeting in person with her prosecutor years later — which is how the series begins in Episode 1.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tTheir reunion may come as a surprise to those unfamiliar with Knox’s real-life story. However, in her most recent book, “Free: My Search For Meaning,” Knox shared how she has since formed a friendship with Mignini and returned to Perugia, Italy, to meet him face to face.​</p>\n<p>\n\tThe finale fast-forwards to an older Amanda in her 30s, now a mother and wife, who continues to grapple with the players involved in her imprisonment, particularly her prosecutor. In an effort to understand why Mignini was convinced she was guilty, she starts communicating with him.</p>\n<p>\n\t​The pair reconnect by sending each other letters, which ultimately leads to Knox risking it all by returning to Italy to confront him. Speaking with her prosecutor, the conversation shows an emotionally charged Knox in tears as she pushes for an ounce of clarity about Mignini’s involvement in her case. Despite him not apologizing for the role he played in her incarceration, she is able to forgive him.\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\t​Below, Patten spoke with <em>Variety</em> about the shocking finale, working with Knox on set, “Tell Me Lies” Season 3 and more.</p>\n\t<h5>\n\t\tThe moment Amanda reunited with her prosecutor was interesting to see unfold, and it will be especially surprising for viewers unfamiliar with her story. Since Knox co-wrote the episode, what type of conversations did you have with Amanda about how to portray that particular scene?\t</h5>\n<p>\n\tI understood Amanda the most after she told me that it was the moment when she fully took the reins of her own life and regained control of a situation that she had never had control of. I hope that when the audience watches it, they understand her a little bit more too. Amanda helped write that, which was super vital to getting the specifics of the scene and the tone right. It’s the only information in this show that will be a surprise to the audience. A lot of the other facts you can look up and are right there, but this is kind of new information to the public, which I hope makes people think about the whole situation. </p>\n\t<h5>\n\t\tWatching your character confront Giuliano and attempt to profess her innocence once again was intense. What was it like for you emotionally to film that scene?\t</h5>\n<p>\n\tI felt fearful in a lot of ways, but very eager to tell that part of the story. It was this contrasting mix of pressure learning all that Italian for it and getting the correct emotions across. But once we were in it, Francesco Acquaroli is so powerful and present as an actor that it just felt like it flowed in the right way. We shot that one scene in two or three days. It was a monster that we all knew to tackle at the end of the shoot. But when it was over, we were all happy and relieved that we did it in a way that felt authentic and truthful to Amanda’s story.</p>\n\t<h5>\n\t\tWhat was the energy like on set while filming that specific scene?\t</h5>\n<p>\n\tAmanda was on set. I didn’t know how I would feel about that, in terms of my own insecurities, but she comforted me so much. I knew how available she was to answer any question at any moment, which made me feel safe to to to go for it because I knew that I could ask her anything. It was intense. This is the most pivotal moment in this woman’s life, and we were bringing it to life in front of her eyes. It was a very emotional couple of days and shoot in general.\n\t</p>\n<div>\n<figure>\n<p><img srcset=\"https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/176947_0333_V1.jpg 3000w, https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/176947_0333_V1.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/176947_0333_V1.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/176947_0333_V1.jpg?resize=1920,1280 1920w, https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/176947_0333_V1.jpg?resize=1360,907 1360w, https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/176947_0333_V1.jpg?resize=1000,667 1000w, https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/176947_0333_V1.jpg?resize=910,607 910w, https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/176947_0333_V1.jpg?resize=681,454 681w, https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/176947_0333_V1.jpg?resize=450,300 450w, https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/176947_0333_V1.jpg?resize=250,167 250w\" src=\"https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/176947_0333_V1.jpg?w=1024\" alt=\"\" />\n\t</p>\n<figcaption>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCourtesy of Hulu\n\t</figcaption>\n</figure>\n</div>\n\t<h5>\n\t\tYou had to learn Italian for this role, but during the confrontation between Amanda and Giuliano, the dialogue starts in Italian but switches to English. What was the creative decision of shifting between both languages in that specific scene? \t</h5>\n<p>\n\tThere were a lot of discussions about this and how language could be used as an artistic tool. I was relieved because it was originally all in Italian. It was 25 pages. I was very relieved that it was going back and forth. The director of Episodes 7 and 8 had this cool idea to have that shot going in a circle, transitioning from Italian to English and then back. In a moment where Giuliano gets vulnerable, he goes back to Italian. It was a smart way to transition the languages and use them as a creative, artistic tool to tell more of the story. </p>\n\t<h5>\n\t\tWas it challenging to switch between the languages throughout filming?\t</h5>\n<p>\n\tYes, it was everyday homework. Every night, I’d come home and I’d practice. I wanted to be as comfortable with the language as possible so that I could have the freedom to improvise, or if other actors speaking Italian were going off their lines, I would know what they were saying. It required studying Italian every day, which I’ve never had to do for a role.</p>\n\t<h5>\n\t\tWhat discussions were you having with Amanda to reach that emotional depth around her desire to reunite with Giuliano?\t</h5>\n<p>\n\tA very important discussion I had with her was differentiating Amanda in the different time periods before the tragedy happened, while she was in prison, when she had to readapt to normal life and then present day. I had her walk me through the differences in those phases of her life, and how I could portray those on screen so that the audience can understand her in all of these different moments.</p>\n\t<h5>\n\t\tAmanda’s ability to show empathy for Giuliano even as he resists saying what he knew to be true was striking. Knowing this is based on real events, did Amanda’s compassion surprise you when you first read the script?\t</h5>\n<p>\n\tI am so inspired by her compassion and empathy for the people who are sources of the most traumatic part of her life. We can all learn from that. Her ability to forgive is so powerful, and I think it’s the reason she’s been able to live a peaceful life after what happened. She’s been able to have a family and live a life that isn’t filled with resentment and anger, which would be so easy to do after experiencing something like that. I love that this scene in Episode 8 shows the idea of Amanda thinking she was going to hear him say, “I’m sorry,” or have him understand her.\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\tThe most powerful thing is that Amanda just understood him. She saw him, and that gave her closure. Sometimes it takes understanding the person as opposed to the person understanding you, especially if they’re not able to do that. It took her understanding him as a man to help her move on.</p>\n\t<h5>\n\t\tYour character also returns to Italy, hiding under a blanket, which was a moment foreshadowed in the very beginning. What was your interpretation of Amanda risking it all to go back?\t</h5>\n<p>\n\tI’m so thankful that she was able to get closure out of that trip. The idea of putting herself and family in danger was a risk. But the fact that it worked out and she got something out of it is really beautiful. That was the first scene we shot. It set the tone for the tensions that followed her through the whole series.</p>\n\t<h5>\n\t\tWe have to talk about that final scene with the confessional box. It opened the door for more of this story to be told. What did you think of that scene?\t</h5>\n<p>\n\tI’m obsessed with that ending. It is so rare for an ending to not just wrap everything up in a bow and give people this concrete finish. It’s going to make people think, and I love that. I got chills every time I read it. It says so much without saying too much. I haven’t heard anything about more of this story being told. It’s told up until what happened recently. It did its purpose, which is to help Amanda reclaim her story.

    "body": "<div><p>\n\tAs AI performer <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/tilly-norwood/\">Tilly Norwood</a> continues to spark debate about the intersection of Hollywood and technology, the new president of the actors’ union is doubling down on protection for his members.</p>\n<p>\n\t<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/sean-astin/\">Sean Astin</a>, star of “Rudy” and the just-elected leader of <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/sag-aftra/\">SAG-AFTRA</a>, spoke to <em>Variety</em> about global curiosity over Norwood. She is the creation of a company called Particle6, which caused uproar in late September when leadership said notable talent agencies were interested in representing her for work in film and TV.\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\t“I appreciate that this story has captured the imagination of people, but it’s not the first shoe to drop. We had a 118-day strike, fighting very hard to put AI provisions and protections in place. The teams at SAG-AFTRA have been in this fight for longer than people might realize. As technology continues to advance at light speed, we’re going to meet the challenge,” Astin said.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tThe ”Stranger Things” actor also said the matter will be addressed with the Association of Talent Agents, the trade association representing major firms like CAA, WME and UTA, in upcoming agreement talks.</p>\n<p>\n\t“Our agreement with the ATA is important, and we look forward to a healthy, constructive conversation with agencies to make sure that we continue to help each other. We performers rely on our agent’s judgment and their good work and their sincerity, and they rely on our talent and our marketability,” he said. “The real issue at play is how our work is exhibited and what kinds of permissions and compensations we get for its use.”</p>\n<p>\n\tThe guild head, son of film and TV treasure Patty Duke, pointed to legislation signed by California Governor Gavin Newsome on Friday, for which SAG-AFTRA provided testimony. When it comes to the synthetic star, Astin said his union “knows what this is and how to treat it.” And that means leverage.\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\t“With regard to AI, we have an extraordinary amount of leverage, because the audience wants to see real human performers in movies, TV shows, animation, video games, audio books and in all the other ways that we represent our members,” Astin concluded.</p>\n<p>\n\tAstin’s remarks come after a formal condemnation of Norwood from SAG-AFTRA, as well as <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/2025/film/global/ai-actress-tilly-norwood-backlash-hollywood-1236533740/\">outcry from dozens of actors</a>, including Emily Blunt, Melissa Barrera, Lukas Gage and more.</p>\n</div>"

Skydance Media’s $8 billion acquisition of Paramount Global closed in early August.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tSilverman will oversee the company’s consumer products, live experiences, publishing, partnerships and ecommerce. According to Paramount Skydance, he will work with leaders of at brands including Paramount Pictures and Nickelodeon “to bring stories to life in new ways.”\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\tLast week came news that <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/2025/tv/global/pam-kaufman-leaving-paramount-1236529989/\">Pam Kaufman is exiting</a> as Paramount’s president and CEO of international markets, global consumer products and experiences.

Pictures’ “Barbie” movie. He also led initiatives including the World of Barbie traveling exhibit, Hot Wheels Monster Trucks Live and the upcoming Mattel Adventure Parks.</p>\n<p>\n\tPrior to Mattel, Silverman held senior leadership roles at Marvel Entertainment and Disney. He joined Marvel in 2001 as a corporate attorney in the business and legal affairs group before his promotion to SVP of global business development and licensing operations. Following Disney’s $4.3 billion acquisition of Marvel in 2009, he worked across Marvel divisions on global strategic and tactical matters and corporate brand management.\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\tIn 2011 he moved over to Disney, where he most recently served as EVP of global third-party commercialization, leading Disney’s consumer product licensing business, third-party retail and flexible business models, as well as overseeing the Disney Stores and commercialization for Disney Interactive and Disney Publishing. Silverman received an undergraduate degree from New York’s Ithaca College and a law degree from Brooklyn Law School.</p>\n<p>\n\t“I’m incredibly energized by the entrepreneurial spirit across Paramount,” Silverman said in a statement. “As we build global ecosystems for fans, there’s an extraordinary opportunity to unlock new value by leveraging renowned IP and mining the portfolio for fresh stories and experiences. I’m excited to collaborate across teams to deepen the emotional connection between audiences and the brands, franchises, and characters they love.”</p>\n<p>\n\tShell, who was formerly CEO of NBCUniversal, said: “Josh brings a combination of strategic vision, deep industry experience, and a proven track record of driving global growth across beloved brands and franchises. We are excited to see him harness Paramount’s world-class library and creative engines to reach our audiences in new and exciting ways and fuel the expansion of our consumer products and experiences businesses.”</p>\n<p>\n\tOther recent high-level hires by the company include chief product officer <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/2025/tv/news/paramount-skydance-dane-glasgow-chief-product-officer-1236514290/\">Dane Glasgow, most recently at Meta’s Facebook</a> as VP of product management, and <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/2025/biz/news/paramount-skydance-makan-delrahim-chief-legal-officer-1236529577/\">chief legal officer Makan Delrahim, who had advised Skydance on its acquisition of Paramount Global</a> and was the assistant attorney general overseeing the U.S. Department of Justice’s Antitrust Division during President Trump’s first term.</p>\n<p>\n\tIn addition, Paramount Skydance, which officially calls itself “Paramount, a Skydance Corporation,” <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/2025/film/news/paramount-skydance-board-directors-scale-ai-dennis-k-cinelli-1236521023/\">appointed Scale AI’s CFO, Dennis Cinelli, to its board of directors</a>.</p>\n</div>"
