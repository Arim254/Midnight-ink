    "body": "<div><p>\n\t<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/ulrich-kohler/\">Ulrich Köhler</a>’s “Gavagai” has debuted its trailer with <em>Variety</em> ahead of the film’s screening on Sunday at the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/zurich-film-festival/\">Zurich Film Festival</a>.</p>\n<figure><p>\n<iframe width=\"500\" height=\"281\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/RPD7sgekPiQ?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\"></iframe>\n</p></figure>\n<p>\n\tInternational sales for the film, which had its world premiere at New York Film Festival on Saturday, are being handled by LuxBox.</p>\n<p>\n\tThe film unspools during the turbulent shoot of a “Medea” adaptation in Senegal. On set, Maja seeks solace in a love affair with her co-star Nourou. Months later, they meet again at the film’s premiere in Berlin. Old feelings resurface, but a racist incident unsettles their reunion. Tensions rise as everyone tries to do the right thing. While the ancient tragedy plays out on screen, a contemporary drama unfolds.\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\tDennis Lim, artistic director of the New York Film Festival, commented: “Köhler specializes in cunning, tonally surprising films about cross-cultural disconnection, and ‘Gavagai’ is his most ambitious and expansive film yet—a pinpoint-accurate account of moral crises and social biases, modern and ancient, internal and external.”\n</p>\n<p>\n\tThe cast includes Jean-Christophe Folly (Nourou), Maren Eggert (Maja), Nathalie Richard (Caroline), Anna Diakhere Thiandoum (Aïta) and Mateusz Malecki (Kolakowski).</p>\n<p>\n\tThe producers are Ingmar Trost and Clement Duboin. The co-producer is Maren Ade. The lead production company is Sutor Kolonko, and the co-production partner is Good Fortune Films.</p>\n<p>\n\tKöhler’s “Bungalow” (2002) and “Montag kommen die Fenster” (2006) were shown at numerous festivals and received several prizes. “Schlafkrankheit (2011) was awarded the Silver Bear for best director at the Berlinale. “In My Room” (2018) premiered in Cannes’ Un Certain Regard section. “A Voluntary Year” (2019), made in collaboration with Henner Winckler, screened in competition at Locarno.</p>\n</div>"

The drama charts her gradual journey from vulnerability to self-determination.\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\tThe film, produced by Komola Collective and Goopy Bagha Productions Limited, stars Aanon Siddiqua as Dipa, delivering a breakout performance that anchors the narrative.

    "body": "<div><p>\n\tChinese auteur <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/jia-zhangke/\">Jia Zhangke</a> is set to begin production on his next feature in December, marking a shift toward contemporary storytelling after his recent trilogy spanning decades of Chinese social change.</p>\n<p>\n\t“My last three films tracked a long period of time from the end of the last century until the present. For my next project, I’m going to this moment contemporary film,” Jia tells <em>Variety</em> at the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/pingyao-international-film-festival/\">Pingyao International Film Festival</a>, which he founded, though he declined to reveal the title.\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\tWhile social change has been central to much of his work, Jia says his upcoming film takes a different approach. “The world is changing, and China is changing particularly fast. So there will be some message regarding changes, but changes will not be the focus of storytelling,” he explains.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tJia’s distribution company <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/2025/film/news/jia-zhangke-china-distribution-company-1236331108/\">Unknown Pleasures Pictures</a> has released two films in China so far: Paola Cortellesi’s Italian film “There’s Still Tomorrow” and Charlie Chaplin’s classic “Gold Rush.” The upcoming slate includes Joachim Trier’s “Sentimental Value,” Kleber Mendonça Filho “The Secret Agent,” Fukada Koji’s “Love on Trial,” Miyake Sho’s “Two Seasons, Two Strangers” and Andrea Segre’s “The Great Ambition.”</p>\n<p>\n\t“I don’t see any barrier, except that we need to raise against the films that have been leaked on the internet,” Jia says, citing online piracy as the primary challenge. “That is the lethal blow to our releases.”</p>\n<p>\n\tHis production company Wings International, focused on funding non-Chinese films, closed financing last month. “We are well set for operation,” Jia says, adding that several projects have been identified and are being finalized.\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\tAt Pingyao, Jia highlights what he sees as two key trends in Chinese cinema. The first is the rise of Chinese directors working abroad. He points to “Jet Lag in Summer” by Yan Kunao, set in the U.S., and “On the Road” by Wei Dongchen, a film made in Japan by a Hong Kong director. The second trend he notes is filmmakers entering cinema from other fields, such as “A Woman in Their Eyes” by former paraglider athlete Gu Ying and “Happy Girls” by Meng Xing, whose background is in material science.</p>\n<p>\n\t“These new works make it increasingly difficult to define what is a Chinese film and what is an international film,” Jia says.</p>\n<p>\n\tAs Pingyao approaches its 10th anniversary next year, Jia emphasizes keeping the festival “always young, always volatile, sometimes a little temperamental” rather than becoming a “classic” institution. He says the goal is not to become “a classic film festival” but to stay young and adaptable.</p>\n<p>\n\t“We don’t want to be old money,” he says. “We want to be flexible and nimble.”</p>\n<p>\n\tThe festival has introduced a new section for microdramas and short-form content, acknowledging their popularity in China. “Some people see the rise of such a short form series as a fanciful challenge to cinema,” Jia says. “We would like to enable filmmakers to know what short form series actually are, because many are discussing it without watching.”</p>\n<p>\n\tPingyao’s project market continues supporting emerging talent through two tracks: developing screenplays into films and adapting literature for cinema. This year introduced venture capital connections for short film directors, linking them with major Chinese studio executives during pitch sessions.</p>\n<p>\n\tJia founded the Pingyao International Film Festival in his home province of Shanxi, choosing the ancient city over modern metropolises like Beijing or Shanghai. “Unlike Beijing, Shanghai and other contemporary modern cities, Pingyao itself is an ancient city where ordinary people live,” he says, positioning the festival as encouraging films about authentic lived experiences.</p>\n<div><p>\n\tThe festival opened this year with a <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/2025/film/festivals/pingyao-film-festival-shanxi-cinema-tribute-feng-xiaogang-honor-1236528045/\">tribute to Shanxi cinema</a>, honoring works by directors including Bernardo Bertolucci, Zhang Yimou and Chen Kaige that were shot in the province and inspired Jia’s own filmmaking journey.</p></div>\n</div>"

    "body": "<div><p>\n\tJournalists and filmmakers and cinema itself are facing growing political threats and increasing difficulties, according to film industry reps at the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/zurich-summit/\">Zurich Summit</a> on Saturday.</p>\n<p>\n\tTaking part in a discussion on the political turmoil engulfing the entertainment industry at the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/zurich-film-festival/\">Zurich Film Festival</a> industry event were Kathleen Fournier of Charlotte Street Films, producer of the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/julian-assange/\">Julian Assange</a> doc “The Six Billion Dollar Man;” David Unger, CEO of Artist International Group; Nathanaël Karmitz, chairman of Paris-based MK2; and Stephen Follows, film data researcher and consultant for Guinness World Records.\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\tOffering a stark example of the darkening climate for filmmakers was Fournier’s experience in producing Eugene Jarecki’s “The Six Billion Dollar Man,” which screens at the Zurich Film Festival.\n</p>\n<p>\n\t“As a filmmaker, as a producer, there is substantial risk sometimes involved for me and my team personally,” Fournier said, explaining how she moved with her family to Berlin to work on the documentary, which tells “the definitive story of Wikileaks,” due to the potentially explosive footage they had obtained.</p>\n<p>\n\t“We didn’t feel comfortable editing in the U.K. or in the U.S. because there are laws there and ways to seize footage, and journalists aren’t protected in the way they are in Germany. So we moved the entire production and editing team to Berlin, and that was really inspiring and very interesting … until Gaza happened and we started to see that even Germany, with all of its civic mindedness, is fallible to ideology and to erosion. So it was very interesting to see journalists challenged there in real time and to react to that.”\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\tShe added: “I think we really do need a mechanism in place to protect journalists. And that’s what our film is about.”</p>\n<p>\n\tFournier also noted how the changing political climate and growth of streaming platforms have impacted the prospects of certain types of documentaries.</p>\n<p>\n\t“It used to be that if you won an Emmy, won the Sundance Grand Jury prize, won a Grierson Award, you would have no trouble getting your films made. And we won all of those with many of our films. I’m not complaining that doors have closed, but what I’m seeing is that as documentaries move to streaming platforms, many of the political and more nuanced and difficult or subjective documentaries did not make that leap.</p>\n<p>\n\t“The sort of documentaries you now find on streaming platforms tend to be historical – there’s the past, so it flattens the stakes in a way because those people are gone, that time is finished – or it’s true crime or it’s often very sort of personal stories. So it is interesting trying to make a film at this particular juncture as the media landscape is changing fundamentally, dramatically.”</p>\n<p>\n\tYet life has always been difficult, Fournier added. “Every epoch has its challenges, and I think we as a generation, my generation, inherited a lot of the fruits of other people’s labor in the civil rights movement, in terms of civil liberties. Now it’s up to us to stand up for those and really investigate what it means as some of those rights and liberties get challenged or taken away.”</p>\n<p>\n\tDespite winning this year’s Golden Eye Special Jury Prize at Cannes and a “phenomenal” screening in Zurich, “The Six Billion Dollar Man” has yet to land a U.S. distributor.</p>\n<p>\n\t“We’ve been dancing with lots of partners and talking. People love the film, but it’s a difficult film. … It talks about Trump, it talks about the deep state. It uses all the facts that come from various court cases. It’s an incredibly, deeply researched film.”</p>\n<p>\n\tOffering a sharp critique of the industry, Follows argued that the onus was on companies to exhibit greater courage, as was the case in the 1970s, which saw much braver, more diverse and interesting storytelling than what was produced in subsequent decades.</p>\n<p>\n\t“The film industry is fundamentally, as a business and as an ecosystem, risk averse and scared and cowardly. … It’s absolutely cowardly that they’re not releasing these films. You think about how ‘Bowling for Columbine’ got media releases and things like that. So this needs agitators. If we leave it and don’t actively do things, the industry acts in horrible ways. The reason Me Too had to happen is because when left to our own devices as an industry, we didn’t police, we didn’t sort out.”\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\tWhile stressing that politics and cinema have always been very linked, Karmitz said: “What is new is that we ask this question, and we ask this type of question because culture is under attack and cinema is under attack.”</p>\n<p>\n\tKarmitz said that while the press was talking less and less about films, far-right accounts on the social media platform X were systematically attacking “everything about movies and French movies.”</p>\n<p>\n\tThe far-right has become the major voice discussing cinema on X, he added. “Is this a problem? Yes, it is, because the question is, how do we organize to fight back?”</p>\n<p>\n\tKarmitz noted that many of MK2’s cinema events and discussions attract contentious reactions from far-right critics.</p>\n<p>\n\tLooking at the broader situation in France, he also stressed the recent legal challenge faced by the CNC national film center in Parliament and the ongoing right-wing assault on national television.</p>\n<p>\n\tUnger, for his part, expressed optimism that the climate would eventually improve. He recalled how earlier films by the likes of Charlie Chaplin and Stanley Kramer “were unbelievably controversial” in their day. Kramer’s 1967 classic “Guess Who’s Coming to Dinner,” for example, no longer causes the great ruckus it once did.</p>\n<p>\n\tHe also underscored the importance of such a discussion at the Zurich Summit. “I see that this register’s here. And I think for us to have this dialogue here is important, because it’s forcing all of us in this room to kind of examine where the business is and how we can help shape it.”</p>\n</div>"

They became fast friends and went on to collaborate on several projects together. Blanco produced two tracks on Gomez’s 2015 album “Revival,” and Gomez was later featured on Blanco’s 2019 release. The pair collaborated again in 2023 on Gomez’s song “Single Soon.” They began dating the same year, and by December 2024, Gomez and Blanco were engaged.\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\tIn March, Blanco and Gomez’s collaborative history reached new heights with the release of their j<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/2025/music/news/selena-gomez-benny-blanco-release-i-said-i-love-you-first-1236336891/\">oint 14-song album “I Said I Love You First.”</a> Ahead of the album’s debut, Spotify released a 33-minute one-on-one conversation between the couple, in which they went behind the scenes on their writing process.\n</p>\n<p>\n\t“We’d get up in the morning and have a conversation. But our conversation was never led going, ‘What are we going to write in the album?’” Gomez said.</p>\n<p>\n\t“I was constantly just writing whatever you said wherever we were,” Blanco added. “Sometimes, you’d be saying something really important, and I didn’t know if you even realized, but I would always open my phone and be like, ‘Fuck, that’s such a good line for a song.’”</p>\n</div>\n<div>\n\t<h2 id=\"section-heading\">\n\t\tMore from Variety\n\t</h2>\n\t<ul>\n\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n<div>\n\t\t\t<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/2025/biz/news/variety-power-of-women-honorees-1236521088/\">\n\t\t\t<p><img src=\"https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Variety-Power-of-Women-Honorees-2025.jpg?w=250&h=167&crop=1\" alt=\"Variety Power of Women Honorees 2025\" />\n\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t</a>\n\t</div>\n\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t</ul>\n\t</div>\n\t\t\t</article>\n\t\t</div>"
