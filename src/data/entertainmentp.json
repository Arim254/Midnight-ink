    "body": "<div><p>\n\t“Mare’s Nest,” the latest feature from British artist and experimental filmmaker <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/ben-rivers/\">Ben Rivers</a> (“Two Years at Sea,” “A Spell to Ward Off the Darkness,”) has been acquired for North America by Grasshopper Film. </p>\n<p>\n\tThe film had its world premiere at the 78th <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/locarno-film-festival/\">Locarno Film Festival</a>, where it competed in the main competition and won the ecological Pardo Verde Prize. It went on to have its North American premiere earlier this month at the Toronto International Film Festival. The U.S. premiere will take place on Oct. 2 as the Centerpiece Selection in the Currents Section of the 63rd New York Film Festival.\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\t“Mare’s Nest” follows Moon (Moon Guo Barker), who travels through a mysterious world free of adults. She meets a sage, and her translator, in a mountain hut, where she tries to understand what is happening. As per the synopsis: “She meets many others who show her different possibilities for living. She observes and moves on into an unknown future.”\n</p>\n<p>\n\t“It’s a real pleasure to reunite with Ben, whose film ‘Two Years at Sea’ I had the privilege of releasing years ago,” commented Ryan Krivoshey of Grasshopper Film. “Ben Rivers is one of the most visionary and original voices in contemporary cinema and ‘Mare’s Nest’ is another remarkable work — mysterious, dreamlike, and quietly revelatory. We’re thrilled to bring it to audiences.”</p>\n<p>\n\tProduced by Rivers and Andrea Queralt, with co-producers Aonan Yang, Andreas Mendritzki, and Fabrizio Polpettini, the film is a collaboration between Urth Films, 4A4 Productions, La Bête, Le Fresnoy, and GreenGround Productions. Rivers wrote the screenplay, which is based on Do DeLillo’s climate-focussed one-act play “The Word for Snow.”\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\tThe deal was negotiated by Krivoshey of Grasshopper Film with Fen Chen of Rediance.<br /></p>\n</div>"

    "body": "<div><p>\n\tThe affable yet thin Hulu comedy “<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/chad-powers/\">Chad Powers</a>” is a redux on several fronts. The basic premise — a silly gag set against the backdrop of high-level football, extrapolated into a feel-good sports series named for its protagonist — has obvious parallels to that of the Apple TV+ hit “Ted Lasso.” For leading man and co-creator <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/glen-powell/\">Glen Powell</a>, “Chad Powers” marks the second major role in which his character’s physical transformation for the sake of a disguise prompts and reflects an interior shift. The first, the Netflix film “Hit Man,” was the latest of several collaborations with the filmmaker Richard Linklater; Powell co-wrote the script and played a mild-mannered professor who starts posing as killers for hire to entrap potential clients.\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\t“Chad Powers” is not as astonishing a show of Powell’s range as “Hit Man.” Nor does it manage, as “Ted Lasso” did, to transcend its initial gimmick over the course of its awkwardly compressed six-episode season. (What happened <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/2023/tv/news/ted-lasso-season-3-review-final-season-1235629420/\">after that initial success</a> need not be spoken of.) Powell remains one of movie stardom’s great young hopes, a blonde and beaming Texan taken under the wing of Tom Cruise who shares his mentor’s embrace of visible, enthusiastic effort. With “Chad Powers,” he’s returning to live-action TV work for the first time in a decade, since a part in Ryan Murphy’s horror comedy “Scream Queens” helped kickstart his ascent. But even though “Chad Powers” helps cement Powell’s rise by placing him at the top of the call sheet, the college football quarterback seems unlikely to be remembered as one of his signature roles.\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\tThe first person to assume the Chad Powers moniker was retired New York Giants star Eli Manning, who donned a fake name, a wig and prosthetics to pose as a Penn State walk-on prospect in a <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lLhsjH3IBPc&t=73s\" target=\"_blank\">viral sketch</a> for his ESPN show with older brother Peyton. (Both Mannings executive produce the Hulu project via their company Omaha Productions.) Powell and co-creator Michael Waldron, the “Loki” showrunner, have given Powers a slightly more convincing hair and makeup job, a reedy voice and a fleshed-out backstory. This Powers’ true identity is not an NFL veteran but Russ Holliday, a former college athlete whose career ended in humiliating fashion on the national stage. Years later and now a Cybertruck-driving, crypto-plugging Z-list celebrity, Russ takes inspiration from “Mrs. Doubtfire” and decides his best shot at redemption is to become someone else.</p>\n<p>\n\tThe most interesting wrinkle in the story of how Russ becomes Chad, the unlikely new face of the fictional South Georgia Catfish — default cheer: “Go fish!” — is Russ’ father Mike (the great Toby Huss), a Hollywood makeup artist whose tricks of the trade Russ steals for his secret project. But like so much else in this rushed-feeling hero’s journey, the dynamic between a gay single dad and his unrepentant sports bro of a son doesn’t get much space to deepen beyond the initial comedic contrast.</p>\n<p>\n\tOnce on campus and under the supervision of head coach Jake Hudson (Steve Zahn), Chad strikes up an alliance of convenience with team mascot Danny (Frankie A. Rodriguez), who recognizes Russ from DeuxMoi and volunteers to abet his scheme, and a flirtation with Jake’s daughter Ricky (Perry Mattfeld), an assistant coach who’s trying to be taken seriously. Both relationships evolve at a pace that seems shaped more by the scant episode order, so common in contemporary TV comedies, than Russ’ organic evolution. The season ends on a cliffhanger, a choice that’s both frustrating but at least portends a seemingly inevitable second installment that can elaborate on what’s initially left bare bones.</p>\n<p>\n\tChad himself requires as Herculean a commitment from Powell — not to mention the makeup department, led by Alexei Dmitriew — as the persona does for Russ. Chad doesn’t just have a bigger nose or longer hair than his creator; he’s also a kinder, gentler person, if one whose bizarre behavior leads a booster to callously but reasonably speculate may have “the seety.” (She means CTE, a sharper-edged joke than the show typically goes for.) “You want to come across as a quiet, likeable leader,” Danny advises his collaborator. “Try and be the opposite of yourself.” Chad is so much the opposite of Russ that Russ starts referring to him in the third person, like he’s a completely separate entity.\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\tBut Chad is, and remains, such a cartoon that the story’s more earnest elements never quite resonate. “Chad Powers” lands plenty of jokes at its namesake’s expense, from all his absurd, unbelievable lies (Chad and Danny are close because Danny’s family “‘Blind Side’-ed” him; Chad is late to a game because his garage door opener got a virus) to one coach’s drive-by insults, such as “Sling Blade” and “Flowers for Algernon.” It just can’t synthesize these bits with, say, Jake’s quotidian marital woes into a uniform tone. “Chad Powers” is now more than a sketch, but it’s not quite all the way to being a full-fledged TV show.</p>\n<p>\n\t<em>The first two episodes of “Chad Powers” are now streaming on Hulu, with remaining episodes streaming weekly on Tuesdays.</em></p>\n</div>"

    "body": "<div><p>\n\t<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/lainey-wilson/\">Lainey Wilson</a> has been named as the host of the 2025 <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/country-music-association-awards/\">Country Music Association Awards</a> on ABC — handling those duties by herself this year, after having been brought on as one of three co-hosts for the previous year.</p>\n<p>\n\tProducers picking the country star to be the telecast’s sole pilot is a sign of how fast her star has risen and how dominant she is as an ambassador for country music at the moment. As it happens, this will mark a rare occurrence of an artist who is nominated for the most trophies on a televised awards show also being the host of that show. Going into this year’s CMAs,<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/2025/music/news/cma-awards-nominations-2025-lainey-wilson-megan-moroney-1236511466/\"> Wilson is tied with Ella Langley and Megan Moroney for the most noms</a>, with six each.\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\tIt’s only the second time in the last 22 years that the CMAs have gone with a solo host. The previous instance came when Luke Bryan took the reins alone for the 2021 telecast. Prior to that, it hadn’t happened since Vince Gill was the sole host for the show for a long run that lasted from 1994 to 2003.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tIn 2024, Wilson came on board as a third member of the hosting team, joining Bryan and football great Peyton Manning, who had been paired up as a duo the previous two years.</p>\n<p>\n\t“I grew up watching the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/cma-awards/\">CMA Awards</a> like it was the Super Bowl,” Wilson said in a statement, “so to be hosting for a second year is a true honor. I’m humbled that CMA has trusted me with this role, and I can’t wait to love on this genre that has given me so much.”</p>\n<p>\n\tThe 59th annual show airs live on ABC from Nashville’s Bridgestone Arena on Nov. 19 at 8 p.m. ET. It will be available be available for streaming the next day on Hulu. \n\t</p>\n<p>\n\tIf Wilson should stay on as host for years to come, she has a couple of role models whose boots she might follow in, as far as racking up a lot of successive years fronting the broadcast. </p>\n<p>\n\tThe aforementioned Gill had a long stint as host with his 10-year run. But the hosts who racked up the greatest number of years in the role were Carrie Underwood, who assumed the role for a dozen years from 2008 to 2019, followed by Brad Paisley, who co-hosted with Underwood for the first 11 of those 12 years. (In her 13th year, Underwood co-hosted with Reba McEntire and Dolly Parton.)</p>\n<p>\n\tThe awards Wilson is up for this year include the top prize, entertainer of the year, which she previously won in a surprise victory in 2023, the first time she was nominated. She is considered a leading favorite to reclaim it this time around, given her recent success selling out her first headlining arena tour. (Last year, she was nominated for the top award a second time but lost to Morgan Wallen, who did not show up to claim the prize.) </p>\n<p>\n\tBesides being up for entertainer of the year again, Wilson’s other five nominations this year are in the categories for female vocalist of the year; single of the year and song of the year (both for “4x4xU”); album of the year (for “Whirlwind”); and music video of the year (for “Somewhere Over Laredo,” a single included on the deluxe version of “Whirlwind”).</p>\n<p>\n\t“Whirlwind” is only Wilson’s third major-label album, after she began her career climb with 2021’s “Sayin’ What I’m Thinkin’.” A small recurring role on the hit TV series “Yellowstone” provided a boost in her rise to fame. She has had eight top 5 hits on the country airplay chart in the last five years, five of those as a solo artist and three as a featured duet partner.</p>\n</div>"

    "body": "<div><p>\n\tConan O’Brien stopped by “The Late Show” on Monday night to remind <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/stephen-colbert/\">Stephen Colbert</a> of some sage advice he offered before stepping away from the world of late-night four years ago. Colbert is about to become a late-night vet himself after CBS decided to end “The Late Show” in May 2026. </p>\n<p>\n\t“Just as I was leaving my late-night show, I took you and all the other late-night hosts out,” O’Brien began. “Remember this? I took you to a wonderful Sizzler restaurant, and we all had our trays and I told you guys, ‘Take care of late night. If you take care of late night, late night will take care of you.’ I said, ‘Don’t do anything to ruffle any feathers.’ Remember? I said that. And I said, ‘Whatever you do, don’t speak truth to power.’ I said, ‘Cowardice is the way.'”\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\tO’Brien joked that in his 28 years of being a late-night host, he “never read the news. I had a masturbating bear and a plastic dog. I didn’t even know who was president!” \n</p>\n<p>\n\tAs the crowd howled with laughter, Colbert deadpanned, “Thanks for being here, Conan.” </p>\n<p>\n\tOn a more serious note, O’Brien told Colbert: “I, of course, adore you. I love you. I know you as a person and also a comedic force and, like a lot of people, I’m very sad that this chapter is ending.”</p>\n<p>\n\tHe added, “But I also want to say that you are going to do amazing things, you’re going to have a lot of fun. And the connection you have — and this isn’t just you, it’s Mr. Kimmel and Fallon, all these guys have — it’s very special. The connection you have with the audience, you’re taking with you. No one else owns that. That’s yours for the rest of your life.”\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\tLate-night television is in the midst of a reckoning after Colbert’s “Late Show” was canceled and “Jimmy Kimmel Live” was taken off the air following the host’s comments about the assassination of Charlie Kirk. After Kimmel’s suspension was lifted last week, Colbert celebrated during his show, saying: “Our long national late nightmare is over … Come on! Wonderful news for my dear friend Jimmy and his amazing staff.”</p>\n<p>\n\tWatch O’Brien’s full interview on “The Late Show With Stephen Colbert” below.</p>\n<figure><p>\n<iframe width=\"500\" height=\"281\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/Nv9kkpBeqdw?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\"></iframe>\n</p></figure>\n</div>"
