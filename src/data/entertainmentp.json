    "body": "<div><p>\n\tOn this week’s episode of “<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/the-daily-show/\">The Daily Show</a>,” <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/jon-stewart/\">Jon Stewart</a> celebrated the return of “<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/jimmy-kimmel/\">Jimmy Kimmel</a> Live!” after ABC <a href=\"https://variety.com/2025/tv/news/nexstar-jimmy-kimmel-abc-charlie-kirk-1236522584/\" target=\"_blank\">pulled the late-night program</a> from its schedule.</p>\n<p>\n\tAfter taking a jab at <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/donald-trump/\">Donald Trump</a>‘s new claim that using Tylenol during pregnancy causes autism in children, Stewart announced to rapturous applause, “Young Jimmy Kimmel is coming back to television! I’ll tell you, Jimmy Kimmel is flying high like Advil today. Acetaminophen is like boom, Advil’s like, ‘What’s up, motherfuckers? You got a headache, where are you going to turn?'”\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\tThe late-night pundit facetiously congratulated his audience for launching a successful, although fraudulent, campaign to help bring Kimmel back.\n</p>\n<p>\n\t“The campaign that you all launched, pretending that you were going to cancel Hulu while secretly racing through four seasons of ‘Only Murders in the Building,’ really worked,” he said. “Congratulations!”</p>\n<p>\n\tStewart then tackled the reason Kimmel was pulled off the air. He joked that, to his knowledge, it “had nothing to do with the Trump administration and their explicit FCC threat that they could remove the show the easy way or the hard way.”</p>\n<p>\n\tThe show then cut to a clip of a Fox News correspondent echoing the same opinion. She said, “My gosh, this had nothing to do with Donald Trump not agreeing with anything Jimmy Kimmel said or not.”</p>\n<p>\n\t“I mean, gee willickers,” Stewart said. “All my days. I mean, I don’t know why people would think that. We just randomly remove one show a week!”</p>\n<p>\n\tCutting back to Fox News, the correspondent added, “If Donald Trump wanted to take everyone off the air who had criticisms for him, there would basically only be a handful of individuals left on television.”\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\t“That is funny, but it also may be a cause for self-reflection?” Stewart asked. “‘Hey, if everybody on TV is criticizing me, except for, like, four people, and one of them is my daughter-in-law, am I the drama?'”</p>\n<p>\n\tDisney and ABC <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/2025/tv/news/jimmy-kimmel-returns-late-night-disney-tuesday-1236525670/\">revealed Monday</a> that they are putting Kimmel back on the air after preempting his program on Sept. 17. Upon the announcement, Disney said in a statement, “Last Wednesday, we made the decision to suspend production on the show to avoid further inflaming a tense situation at an emotional moment for our country. It is a decision we made because we felt some of the comments were ill-timed and thus insensitive. We have spent the last days having thoughtful conversations with Jimmy, and after those conversations, we reached the decision to return the show on Tuesday.”</p>\n<p>\n\tABC pulled Kimmel from its schedule after Nexstar Media and Sinclair, two of the nation’s largest TV station owners, vowed to preempt “Jimmy Kimmel Live!” for the host’s on-air statements about the death of conservative activist Charlie Kirk. Those announcements were made shortly after FCC chair Brendan Carr <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/2025/tv/news/brendan-carr-abc-fcc-jimmy-kimmel-charlie-kirk-1236522406/\">seemed to suggest</a> broadcasters should take action against Kimmel for his commentary.</p>\n<p>\n\tSinclair <a href=\"https://variety.com/2025/tv/news/sinclair-abc-stations-wont-air-jimmy-kimmel-live-1236526649/\" target=\"_blank\">revealed Monday</a> that its ABC stations will still preempt “Jimmy Kimmel Live!” starting Tuesday, and that negotiations for the show’s return remain ongoing. </p>\n<p>\n\tKimmel’s comeback, set for Tuesday night, was approved by Disney CEO Bob Iger and Disney Entertainment co-chair Dana Walden. Terms of his return are still unclear, including whether or not Kimmel must apologize for his comments on Kirk.</p>\n</div>"

    "body": "<div><p>\n\t<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/kamala-harris/\">Kamala Harris</a> began her career in public life as a prosecutor. But, to this day, she remains unwilling to place herself in the sights of a real interrogator. </p>\n<p>\n\tOn Monday night, ahead of the Sept. 23 release of her campaign memoir “107 Days,” Harris sat with <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/rachel-maddow/\">Rachel Maddow</a> on MSNBC. The interview was, by its design, gooily sympathetic. Maddow, a TV veteran, somewhat bafflingly began the broadcast by declaring “I’m a little nervous about this interview, because it’s a big deal.” She told the former vice president and presidential nominee, in setting up an early softball, “You’ve become the patron saint of ‘I told you so.’” And she laughingly responded when Harris nostalgically brought up the 2024 campaign line “I know his type.” (Harris, like other prominent Democrats including Michelle Obama and Joe Biden, avoided using Trump’s name.)\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\tIt’s not that Harris deserves to be filleted, especially in a political climate where Harris, out of office, has relatively little real influence, and those who do hold power are restructuring our society on every level, every day. But… “I know his type” didn’t work. There are reasons beyond Harris that Harris lost the 2024 election, but an interview that seemed determined to avoid them left potential insight on the table. \n</p>\n<p>\n\tMaddow and Harris seemed to have a genuine rapport, and in moments, the Harris who seemed just beyond the veil in 2024 — laughing hard, comfortable in her skin, freewheeling — poked through. One felt for Maddow’s interview subject: Anyone who’s ever written and published a personal essay can perhaps relate to Harris’ discomfort in being reminded of the things she’d put on the page about various Democratic politicians. She took care to note, several times, that California Gov. Gavin Newsom, who Harris reportedly writes ghosted her request for support in her presidential bid as it began, has a great sense of humor, while she split hairs over how to describe her ultimate decision not to include first-choice running mate Pete Buttigieg on her ticket: It wasn’t <em>because </em>he’s gay, it’s because a gay man and a woman of color together would have been too much to introduce to the nation so rapidly.\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\tBut allowing so much time for Harris to attempt to unsay what her book says made for a frustrating viewing experience for someone outside the core MSNBC demographic. Harris’ whole thing, to this point, has been a certain unknowability, a tendency Maddow could sometimes, with her amiable approach to Harris, encourage. During her foreshortened presidential campaign, for example, Harris did relatively little press, and tended to do so late and only in utterly familiar settings. (She also struggled even within those: An appearance on “The View” in which she could not name a difference between her governing style and Joe Biden’s could be argued to have been her campaign’s death knell.) </p>\n<p>\n\tAs the principal on a presidential campaign, Harris generally avoided opportunities to speak on her own behalf in a setting the campaign did not control. While it’s apparent Maddow was literally free to write her own questions, she was doing so for an audience predisposed to want to see Harris get a win. The result, for any curious viewer interested in seeing how Harris was doing, could obscure as much as it revealed. </p>\n<p>\n\tAt times, indeed, it seemed as though Maddow was pushing Harris toward that potential win. Though being Biden’s vice president, reporting on “107 Days” indicates, was arduous in many ways, it may have been easier than being the face of the campaign in just one way: Harris wasn’t obligated to speak for herself. Similarly, in this interview, she was much more comfortable acting in direct opposition (as when she decried the Trump administration’s policies and urged “feckless” billionaires to oppose him) or espousing generally approved wisdom (applauding Jimmy Kimmel’s return to ABC as a result of “the power of the people”) than she was in looking to a vision of Harrisesque politics — a way forward. Asked a rare off-talking-points question by Maddow about whether she supported New York City mayoral candidate Zohran Mamdani, a Democratic Socialist, Harris said she supports any Democratic nominee for office, and went on to say that more of the nation’s attention should be on other candidates, in other cities.</p>\n<p>\n\tMamdani and Harris are different politicians, of different generations, with vastly different media approaches. And only one of them has ever been vice president! But — at least for a viewer living in the New York media market — it’s hard not to contrast his approach to the media with hers. Harris, aside from the opening in which she pleaded with billionaires to change their behavior, seemed in this interview to be largely interested in playing the hits. (That she told Maddow that she is genuinely not focused on the question of whether or not to run for president in 2028 seemed candid and honest — Harris is not presenting as if she wants to go through <em>that </em>gauntlet again.) Mamdani, and others like him, use spotlights like these to look forward. “107 Days” sounds like a riveting book, and I can’t wait to read it. But Harris’ interview — the substance of it, and the unchallenging venue she chose out of a continued desire to reduce her exposure — have made me suspect that I won’t be reading it as a book about current events. It seems to be a book about history.</p>\n</div>"

Go to him now before I change my mind.’ Only one resulted in a crying face meme,” Van Der Beek said. He went on to introduce Norm Lewis to the stage to perform “The Music of the Night.”</p>\n<p>\n\tAnother surprise of the night was when Steven Spielberg — Dawson’s hero throughout the series — appeared on screen with a message. “Dawson, you made it.

    "body": "<div><p>\n\t“<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/steal-away/\">Steal Away</a>” starts with intertitles that announce it as a tale of “two princesses.” The implied fairy tale trappings are appropriate for this metaphor heavy film. Director <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/clement-virgo/\">Clement Virgo</a> adapts, with Tamara Faith Berger, the nonfiction novel “Steal Away Home” by Karolyn Smardz Frost. The book explored the relationship between an escaped slave and her mistress, whom she met when they were both young girls. Virgo’s film takes that premise and reimagines it as a twisty psychological allegory, laden with weighty themes. But “Steal Away” proves more rewarding to decipher afterward than to sit through.\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\tWithout establishing time or geographic setting, the film follows Cecile (Mallori Johnson), a young woman from the Congo who flees war in her home country and arrives as a refugee taken in by a white family who live in a strange big mansion. There she becomes the companion of Fanny (<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/angourie-rice/\">Angourie Rice</a>), a girl her age who appears extremely naive in contrast. Cecile is worldly and has seen her share of sorrow, while Fanny has been cloistered in this elaborate old castle under the watchful eye of an over-protective mother and eccentric grandmother. The differences between Cecile and Fanny, in race and in maturity, become the reason they are both fascinated and repelled by each other. \n</p>\n<p>\n\tAs Fanny starts imitating Cecile — wearing her clothes, picking up her mannerisms — the film recalls movies of double personalities like “Persona” or even the more schlocky “Single White Female” — only here with added racial undertones. When Fanny wears Cecile’s Afro futuristic costumes, the themes explored encompass cultural appropriation. The film wisely lets the audience take in these topics and does not push into them with obvious dialogue. \n\t</p>\n<p>\n\tBut “Steal Away” never builds a true psychological conflict between its two leads. Cecile starts a steamy relationship with the mansion’s gardener’s son (Idrissa Sanogo Bamba) whom Fanny had eyes for. So all these considerable themes the film was trying to explore end up adding up to little more than a rudimentary sexual jealousy plot.</p>\n<p>\n\tThere are other more successful elements in the world-building of this fantasy land, which bears resemblance to several historical realities. The film could be argued as being set in a small European country in the mid 20th century, or in the contemporary American South, or even a futuristic yet unknown place. The political, social and racial mores of this place are in tandem with the current migration crisis attitudes in North America and Europe. There are visual motives and African costumes that hint at themes of colonization and cultural appropriation.</p>\n<p>\n\tHowever, hinting is all that “Steal Away” does. It remains elusive, never confronting any of these themes head on. There is a difference between trying to start a conversation by not stating the obvious and staying so opaque that a dialogue never even starts. “Steal Away” leans towards the latter. Johnson has an earthy screen presence that contrasts well with Rice’s ice princess ingenue. The actors are able to bring life to the abstract dialogue while building believable tension and affection between their characters. Johnson’s character has more to do, thus she remains intriguing throughout; Fanny is not given much of an arc, so Rice has to keep repeating the same notes. </p>\n<p>\n\tIn the end,<em> “</em>Steal Away” feels incomplete: an assemblage of evocative ideas and images that never cohere to a resonant dramatic narrative. Virgo and Berger gesture at their themes rather than fully exploring them. Perhaps most egregiously, they give up in the end and fully explain the film’s metaphorical mystery. It’s unforgivable for a film whose most ambitious element to that point was keeping the audience guessing. Still a mood lingers, one of dislocation and unease. “Steal Away” occupies a peculiar place: too elusive to satisfy as narrative, too suggestive to dismiss as mere ornament — and ultimately too obvious to take seriously as an exploration of the tumultuous political and socioeconomic present.</p>\n</div>"

We have spent the last days having thoughtful conversations with Jimmy, and after those conversations, we reached the decision to return the show on Tuesday.”\n</p>\n<p>\n\tABC <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/2025/tv/news/nexstar-jimmy-kimmel-abc-charlie-kirk-1236522584/\">sidelined Kimmel</a> after Nexstar Media and Sinclair, two major U.S. TV station owners, vowed to preempt “Jimmy Kimmel Live!” for the host’s on-air comments about the death of conservative activist Charlie Kirk. Those announcements were quickly made after FCC chair Brendan Carr <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/2025/tv/news/brendan-carr-abc-fcc-jimmy-kimmel-charlie-kirk-1236522406/\">seemed to suggest </a>that broadcasters should penalize Kimmel for his commentary.</p>\n<p>\n\tMany in the entertainment industry quickly rallied behind the late-night host, including Meryl Streep, Tom Hanks and Martin Short, who – along with 400 other stars- <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/2025/tv/news/400-celebrities-aclu-protest-jimmy-kimmel-suspension-1236526119/\">signed an open letter</a> protesting Disney’s decision to pull Kimmel from the air.\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\tKimmel’s comeback, to take place Tuesday night, was approved by Disney CEO Bob Iger and Disney Entertainment co-chair Dana Walden. Terms of the agreement are still unclear, including whether Kimmel will have to apologize for his comments on Kirk.</p>\n<p>\n\tSinclair vowed last week to run a special news report on Charlie Kirk during Kimmel’s slot last week instead of the replacement programming ABC planned to air. But the company ended up moving the special to its streaming platform, and sticking with an ABC game show.</p>\n</div>"

    "body": "<div><p>\n\t“<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/catfish-the-tv-show/\">Catfish: The TV Show</a>” is dead in the water.</p>\n<p>\n\tThe reality show that investigated deceptive online relationships has been canceled at MTV after nine seasons, sources tell <em>Variety</em>. The network is allowing the producers to shop the series elsewhere, and MTV will continue to air episodes from the “Catfish” library.</p>\n<p>\n\tHosted by Nev Schulman, “Catfish” helped people discover the truth about their suspicious digital romances — and sometimes come to terms with the person on the other side of the computer screen. The series is based on Schulman’s 2010 documentary of the same name, which coined the term “catfish” for someone who uses a false identity or stolen photos to deceive others on the internet.\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\tDeveloped by Schulman, Ariel Schulman and Max Joseph, “Catfish: The TV Show” debuted in 2012 on MTV and ended with Season 9 in July 2024. Nev Schulman and Joseph co-hosted the show for its first seven seasons. In 2018, Joseph was replaced by a rotating list of presenters, including Elle King, Nick Young and Machine Gun Kelly. Eventually, Kamie Crawford joined as a permanent host, joining Schulman for 96 episodes.\n</p>\n<p>\n\t“Catfish” not only gave a name to the phenomenon of digital deception. The series also spawned international spinoffs in Colombia, Chile, Brazil, Mexico and the United Kingdom. Its legacy continues on-screen: a recent episode of “The Paper” centered on an employee being catfished by someone impersonating a celebrity, and the current No. 1 documentary on Netflix is titled “Unknown Number: The High School Catfish.”</p>\n<p>\n\tSince the end of Season 9, the status of “Catfish: The TV Show” was up in the air, as it had not received a renewal or cancellation from MTV amid the restructuring of the Paramount merger. Last month, Schulman announced he had earned his real estate broker’s license and would be helping people buy and sell homes in New York. </p>\n</div>"

Come on! Wonderful news for my dear friend Jimmy and his amazing staff.” \n\t</p>\n<p>\n\tThen, Colbert grabbed the Emmy that he won last weekend for outstanding talk show: “I’m so happy for them, plus, now that Jimmy’s not being canceled, I get to enjoy this again!” Then he quipped: “Once more, I am the only martyr in late nights. Wait, unless, CBS, you want to announce anything?”\n</p>\n<div>\n<figure>\n<p><img srcset=\"https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/3112416_0020-e1758588635577.jpg 2000w, https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/3112416_0020-e1758588635577.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/3112416_0020-e1758588635577.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/3112416_0020-e1758588635577.jpg?resize=1920,1280 1920w, https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/3112416_0020-e1758588635577.jpg?resize=1360,907 1360w, https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/3112416_0020-e1758588635577.jpg?resize=1000,667 1000w, https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/3112416_0020-e1758588635577.jpg?resize=910,607 910w, https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/3112416_0020-e1758588635577.jpg?resize=681,454 681w, https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/3112416_0020-e1758588635577.jpg?resize=450,300 450w, https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/3112416_0020-e1758588635577.jpg?resize=250,167 250w\" src=\"https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/3112416_0020-e1758588635577.jpg?w=1024\" alt=\"\" />\n\t</p>\n<figcaption>\n\t\t\t\t\t<span>“The Late Show with Stephen Colbert” during Monday’s September 22, 2025 show.

After Kimmel was suspended, Google searches for ‘cancel Disney+’ and ‘cancel Hulu’ spiked — which explains why the other trending search was ‘how to entertain feral child without Bluey?’ he quipped.</p>\n<p>\n\t“So Disney put Kimmel back on because you, the American people, were upset,” Colbert said. “But not just people. Also Ted Cruz. Cruz was one of the conservatives who were outraged by the administration’s attack on free speech.” Colbert then ran audio of Cruz, and expressed shock that he agreed with Cruz on something. \n\t</p>\n<p>\n\t“Welcome back, Jimmy,” Colbert added. “Long may you wave.”</p>\n<p>\n\t<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/stephen-colbert/\">Last week, Colbert</a> came to the defense of Kimmel, after ABC “indefinitely” suspended “Jimmy Kimmel Live!” The news was widely seen as an assault on the First Amendment and free speech rights, after Federal Communications Commission chairman Brendan Carr threatened action against Disney if it didn’t bench Kimmel. In an unprecedented threat, Carr went on a far-right podcast to proclaim that the FCC had “remedies we can look at. We can do this the easy way or the hard way.”</p>\n<p>\n\tIn his Sept. 18 monologue, Colbert noted that “Shortly after Carr made his statements about ABC, Kimmel gets yanked off the air. This decision came after senior executives at ABC, Disney and affiliates convened emergency meetings during which multiple execs felt that Kimmel had not actually said anything over the line, but the threat of Trump administration retaliation loomed. As one source at ABC put it, they were pissing themselves all day. On the bright side, that proves Disney is No. 1 in streaming.”</p>\n<p>\n\tColbert continued in that Sept. 18 monologue, “Carr was quick to reassure everyone posting, ‘While this may be an unprecedented decision, it is important for broadcasters to push back on Disney programming that they determine falls short of community values.’ Well, you know what my community values are, buster? Freedom of speech.”</p>\n<p>\n\tDuring that episode “The Late Show” also parodied “Be Our Guest” from “Beauty and the Beast,” in which the character Lumiere sings for Disney employees to “shut your trap” and “the new rule at ABC don’t make fun of Donny T.” </p>\n<p>\n\tColbert also called the Kimmel decision “blatant censorship” and added “With an autocrat, you cannot give an inch… Jimmy, I stand with you and your staff 100%.”</p>\n<p>\n\tEarlier this summer, Kimmel had thrown his support behind Colbert after CBS announced it would cancel “The Late Show” and end that talker’s run in May 2026. “Jimmy Kimmel Live!” even put up Emmy For Your Consideration billboards throwing Kimmel’s support behind Colbert. And it worked: Colbert won the outstanding talk series Emmy at this year’s ceremony.</p>\n<p>\n\tWhen Colbert’s show was canceled, it was also seen as a means by Paramount Global to curry favor with the FCC as it needed the agency’s approval to be acquired by Skydance. Both Paramount and Skydance denied that speculation, but the timing of the news still left many curious about how Colbert’s cancellation was handled.\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\tKimmel <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/2025/tv/awards/jimmy-kimmel-defends-colbert-late-night-tv-not-dying-1236479160/\">later told <em>Variety</em></a><em>: </em>“I think we were all shocked and disappointed that this kind of thing is happening in America, and also disappointed that we don’t see more people on the right stepping up and saying, ‘Hey, this is no good.’ Silencing comedians, commentators, whatever you want to call people… I have to say, if Joe Biden had used his muscle to get Sean Hannity kicked off the air, you may be surprised to learn that I would not support that. I would, in fact, support Sean Hannity in that situation, because I thought one of the founding principles of this country was free speech. But people don’t seem to care about protecting it unless you agree with them.”</p>\n</div>"

    "body": "<div><p>\n\tA vivid portrait of a legendary kabuki actor over the course of his career, “<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/kokuho/\">Kokuho</a>” joins a rich tradition of films that depict the personal cost of making art. Too often, such stories present an overly simplified version of the given artform’s rigors and qualities, diluting any undergirding sense of what drives the characters to put themselves through the ringer. By contrast, Japanese director <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/lee-sang-il/\">Lee Sang-il</a>’s surprise hit “Kokuho” spends a great deal of its lengthy runtime capturing the beautiful physicality and anguished storylines around which the performances revolve, mirroring the many struggles and complicated triumphs of its central protagonist’s existence.\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\tThe title “Kokuho” translates to “national treasure,” a title bestowed by the Japanese government upon high masters of an art or craft. Its director, Lee, is best known for his films “Hula Girls” (2006) and “Unforgiven,” a 2013 remake of the Clint Eastwood movie, starring Ken Watanabe. “Kokuho” has become a veritable phenomenon in Japan, where it has earned nearly $100 million since opening in June, shortly after it premiered in Directors’ Fortnight at Cannes. The film was subsequently picked to represent Japan at the Oscars.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tAfter Kikuo (played by Ryo Yoshizawa as an adult and Ryusei Yokohama as a child) — the 14-year-old son of a yakuza leader in 1964 Nagasaki — witnesses the death of his father, he moves to Osaka to begin studying as an apprentice to Hanjiro (Ken Watanabe), widely considered the best kabuki actor in the city. There, he forms a bond with the performer’s son, Shunsuke (Ryusei Yokohama), who only possesses a modicum of passion compared to the intense drive and natural ability to inhabit the role of an onnagata (a man playing a woman’s role in traditional kabuki), beginning a friendship and rivalry that will last for many years.\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\tAt nearly three hours, “Kokuho” takes its time in covering the events of 50 years — ending, after its longest of many time jumps, in 2014 — but it remains engaging throughout, in no small part because of its ambivalent perspective toward its protagonist. As viewed by Lee and screenwriter Satoko Okudera (who adapted the novel by Shuichi Yoshida, whose work inspired Lee’s 2010 film “Villain”), Kikuo is deliberately something of a cipher, clearly a performer who takes great pride in his work but whose sense of self and his ability to relate to others is often murky. As becomes clear through the course of the film, kabuki puts high importance on family lineage. Shunsuke is the heir to the House of Tanban-ya to which Hanjiro belongs. Despite his gift, Kikuo must resort to questionable tactics to maintain his standing in the insular community.</p>\n<p>\n\tWhen Ryo Yoshizawa takes over the role of Kikuo approximately 40 minutes in, this aspect of his character becomes even more paramount to the essential mystery of “Kokuho.” When not in the heavy stage makeup that blurs the lines between Kikuo and Shunsuke, there is a slight coldness to his affect, especially compared to Yokohama’s more extroverted performance, which constantly calls into question the sincerity of his sentiments. Though other characters bear the extreme strain of kabuki training and performance much more harshly, the 31-year-old actor appears oddly alien as he ages, a man who never fit into the preestablished traditions of his artform who nevertheless achieves success.</p>\n<p>\n\tIn many ways, Kikuo acts as an embodiment of his art’s place in post-war Japan. Though the film makes little mention of the world outside kabuki — save for Kikuo’s mention that the “A-bomb disease” killed most of his family — it subtly forms a portrait of the changing times, signaled primarily by costume and production design. Kabuki never loses its popularity in the film, similar to its continued place of honor in real life, but there’s a great tension between its 17th-century roots and the machinations of the 20th century, reflected most prominently in the Mitsutomo Corporation’s heavy sponsorship of the House of Tanban-ya. After all, it is an elaborate production, which must be bankrolled through distinctly modern means.\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\tTo bring all this to life, Lee Sang-il relies heavily on both tight closeups and widescreen long shots that work in tandem to capture the physicality of the many performances. Cinematographer Sofian El Fani (“Blue Is the Warmest Color”)’s bright colors render Yohei Taneda’s art direction and Kumiko Ogawa’s costumes with the appropriate vibrancy. But perhaps the most fascinating touch of all comes courtesy of chyrons that appear when a new kabuki play is introduced. In the American release of “Kokuho,” the Japanese name of the play appears, along with its English translation and a brief description of the play’s narrative. Though performances are not presented in their entirety, this approach offers Western audiences a fuller understanding of the often tragic nature of these tales of unrequited love and death, plus a deeper appreciation of kabuki’s legacy.</p>\n</div>"

    "body": "<div><p>\n\t<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/dave-bautista/\">Dave Bautista</a> recently <a href=\"https://collider.com/dave-bautista-afterburn-jj-perry-highlander-the-killers-game/\" target=\"_blank\">told Collider </a>that he’s no longer going to work with assholes because it’s “absolutely awful,” and he’s fortunately hit a threshold in his acting career where he can be choosier about the projects he takes on and the actors who become his co-stars.</p>\n<p>\n\t“I’m just at the age and at the point of my life where life’s just too goddamn short,” Bautista said. “I want to work with people I just love and respect, because I love this business. I love filmmaking, and if people don’t want to be there, I don’t want to be there with them. You know?”\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\t“I’m <em>happy </em>to be there. It’s a love thing for me, and I’m passionate about it,” Bautista added. “I want to be there, and I want to make the most of it, so I don’t want to hear people bitching, complaining, moaning, and groaning about doing something that we’re all fortunate enough to be doing and making.”\n</p>\n<p>\n\tBautista has long been candid about his desire to diversify his acting filmography and branch out far beyond his breakthrough role as Drax the Destroyer in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, including James Gunn’s “Guardians of the Galaxy” trilogy. He’s even lost weight to gain access to a larger pool of acting roles.</p>\n<p>\n\t“I started trimming down because I got really big for a role. Uncomfortably big,” Bautista <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/2024/film/news/dave-bautista-weight-loss-acting-career-1236142514/\">said last year</a>. “For ‘Knock at the Cabin’ I got really big. I was around 315 pounds…I put the weight on really fast and I put on an uncomfortable amount of weight and it took forever to shed it out.”</p>\n<p>\n\t“The more I trimmed down the better I looked on camera and the better I looked next to other actors,” he explained. “I’m still a large human being. At 6’4 and 240 pounds next to your typical actor, I look like a gorilla and it’s distracting. I’ll probably lose a few more pounds. I’m just killing myself to be this trim. I’m training hard.”\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\tBautista told <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.gq.com/story/gq-hype-dave-bautista\">GQ magazine</a> around the same time that “I just want to be a good fucking actor. A respected actor.” For this reason, he’s always cherished his collaborations with Denis Villeneuve, such as “Blade Runner 2049” and the “<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/dune/\">Dune</a>” films. </p>\n<p>\n\t“I’ve never had a director until Denis, since Denis, say to me that you’re a very strong actor,” Bautista told <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://gizmodo.com/dave-bautista-dune-2-character-wwe-marvel-drax-scifi-1851287353\">Gizmodo</a> last year. “And he said this to me on the first film. I was holding back because I was self-conscious [and] I was. I was very unsure of myself. And he came to me. He said, ‘I feel like you’re holding back. You’re a very strong actor, my friend. Just follow your instincts.’ And so I started belting it out, and I started finding this character. He not only loved it so much, but he was so supportive of my performance that he wanted to capture other people’s reactions to my performance. And so when you’re getting that kind of support, that was an experience I’ve never had before or since, with a director of that caliber. So it means everything. It’s validation.”</p>\n<p>\n\tBautista currently stars in “Afterburn,” now playing in theaters. His upcoming credits include the action thriller “Trap House,” the indie science-fiction movie “Alpha Gang” and a voice role in “The Legend of Aang: The Last Airbender.”<br /></p>\n</div>"
