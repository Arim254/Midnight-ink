    "body": "<div><p>\n\t<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/stephen-king/\">Stephen King</a> recently spoke to <a href=\"https://www.thetimes.com/culture/books/article/stephen-king-author-77-writing-dementia-worries-interview-2w85zz6cq\" target=\"_blank\">The Times UK</a> and criticized Hollywood’s superhero movies for often depicting baseless violence. In various Marvel and DC movies, entire cities are destroyed without the viewer seeing any actual harm to human life. King, whose dystopian horror novel “The Long Walk” gets the film adaptation treatment this month, does not agree with this approach to movie violence.</p>\n<p>\n\t“If you look at these superhero movies, you’ll see some supervillain who’s destroying whole city blocks but you never see any blood,” King said. “And man, that’s wrong. It’s almost, like, pornographic… I said [for ‘The Long Walk’], if you’re not going to show it, don’t bother. And so they made a pretty brutal movie.”\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\tDirected by “The Hunger Games” veteran Francis Lawrence and adapted by “Strange Darling” filmmaker JT Mollner, “The Long Walk” movie follows the same setup as King’s 1979 novel. Set in a dystopian United States, the story centers on a group of teenage boys who compete in the eponymous contest that requires them to walk at a certain speed or get killed. The film stars Cooper Hoffman, David Jonsson, Judy Greer, Mark Hamill and more.</p>\n<p>\n\tIn a recent <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/2025/film/features/cooper-hoffman-the-long-walk-acting-challenges-1236498409/\">interview with </a><em><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/2025/film/features/cooper-hoffman-the-long-walk-acting-challenges-1236498409/\">Variety</a>,</em> Hoffman said the movie’s storyline required the actors to often walk “15 miles a day in 100-degree weather” during filming.</p>\n<p>\n\t“There are moments where you’re forced to be method actors,” Hoffman said. “Whatever ‘method’ means to people. But we <em>are </em>walking. No one is faking that. And it is exhausting.”</p>\n<p>\n\t“The Long Walk” opens in theaters Sept. 12 from Lionsgate.</p>\n</div>"

The series will debut on Paramount+ in the U.S., Canada, U.K., Australia, Latin America, Brazil, Italy, Germany, Switzerland, Austria, and Japan.\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\t“‘NCIS: Tony &amp; Ziva’ picks up after Ziva’s (Cote de Pablo) supposed death when Tony (Michael Weatherly) left the NCIS team to go raise their daughter. Years later, Ziva was discovered alive, leading her to complete one final mission with NCIS before she was reunited with Tony and their daughter in Paris. Since then – and where we find them in the new show– Tony and Ziva have been raising their daughter, Tali (Isla Gie), together. When Tony’s security company is attacked, they must go on the run across Europe, try to figure out who is after them and maybe even learn to trust each other again so they can finally have their unconventional happily ever after.”\n</p>\n<p>\n\t“What a luxury it is to revisit a character after such a long time,” de Pablo told a crowd while teasing a clip from the series at Mipcom in Cannes earlier this year. De Pablo and Weatherly worked together on “NCIS” for 10 years, playing longtime co-workers who always seemed to have a romantic spark between them. The pair haven’t been seen together on screen in the “NCIS” universe since 2013, when de Pablo exited as a series regular.\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\tAlong with de Pablo, Weatherly, and Gie, the cast of the series includes Amita Suman, Maximilian Osinski, Lara Rossi, Nassima Benchicou, Terence Maynard, Julian Ovenden, and James D’Arcy.</p>\n</div>"

    "body": "<div><p>\n\t<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/madelyn-cline/\">Madelyn Cline</a> is a “sleepy girl” — understandably so. This summer, she’s had two massive films come out — first, the highly anticipated “<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/i-know-what-you-did-last-summer/\">I Know What You Did Last Summer</a>,” and second, Prime Video’s romance “<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/the-map-that-leads-to-you/\">The Map That Leads to You</a>.” By the time the latter came out, she was back in Charleston to film the fifth and final season of “<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/outer-banks/\">Outer Banks</a>.”</p>\n<p>\n\t“I think sometimes managing all of it is a little difficult. That’s my own fault. I definitely need an assistant — my Oura ring says I need to do better, mostly with sleep and taking care of myself,” Cline says during a Zoom interview. “It’s about learning how to juggle all of it, while also prioritizing myself. Sometimes I feel like I’m constantly playing catch-up. Centering myself in the middle of it all has been a little difficult. Like anything, the longer the time goes on, the better I get at it. We’re a traveling circus. That’s just the name of the game, and that’s the fun of it.”\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\tCurrently, she’s in the throes of “Outer Banks” and will likely be filming until December or January 2026, depending on whether or not storms delay production. During our conversation, we discuss her very busy year, whether she’ll take time off, playing <em>pregnant</em> Sarah Cameron in Season 5 and the “OBX” pairing she hopes <em>is not</em> endgame.\n</p>\n\t<h5>\n\t\tYou’ve been going nonstop. How are you handling all of this? \t</h5>\n<p>\n\tShooting “Outer Banks” is always really physically taxing, and I don’t feel like I get a whole lot of time for myself, which is something that I love. I love being able to spend time alone or be quiet and recharge, and that has definitely not been the theme of this year so far. But it’s ultimately been very fulfilling, and it’s a great lesson in relinquishing any need or want to control outcomes or situations. I simply can’t, which I think is always a really good life lesson to come back to. I’m mainly just really tired. I’ve always been a very sleepy girl!\n\t</p>\n\t<h5>\n\t\tLet’s start out with “The Map That Leads to You.” What made you say yes to this?\t</h5>\n<p>\n\tThe first time I read it, it made me sob uncontrollably. I thought the story was really, really beautiful, and I was really attached to Heather and Jack. But I love a good romance, I love a good love story, and I think theirs is really special.</p>\n\t<h5>\n\t\tKJ Apa is excellent as Jack, and your chemistry is great. How did you go about finding that bond?\t</h5>\n<p>\n\tI knew from our chemistry read that KJ was Jack, and that was step one. And then once we got there, step two was to live in these adventures that these characters were on. The line between reality and stories started to get a little blurry, and we were also giving ourselves up to the experience and the travel. I think that’s when I knew things were working. The energy, it felt like, was all kind of conspiring with us. The experience itself was special, and it’s hard for that to <em>not</em> translate.</p>\n\t<h5>\n\t\tHow did you feel about the ending?\t</h5>\n<p>\n\tI personally love an ambiguous ending. I like to cry, I like to sob. I like to go into a downward spiral for catharsis. An ending that’s not definitive, I find, is more personal because you can superimpose your own thoughts and feelings. I was also a big fan of an alternate ending that was even more ambiguous. There were lots and lots of conversations about how much we lean to the imagination. I was fully in the imagination station corner.</p>\n\t<h5>\n\t\tSo, is there a possibility we could get a sequel?\t</h5>\n<p>\n\tWe have joked about it, actually. And Marty Bowen, one of our producers, has jokingly given me a plot. I don’t want to spoil it, but it’s really funny. It leans more into the “com” than “rom.”</p>\n<div>\n<figure>\n\t\t\t<p><img srcset=\"https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/65420-6-0003_r.jpeg 663w, https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/65420-6-0003_r.jpeg?resize=99,150 99w, https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/65420-6-0003_r.jpeg?resize=199,300 199w\" src=\"https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/65420-6-0003_r.jpeg\" alt=\"\" />\n\t</p>\n\t\t\t<figcaption>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tJonny Marlow\n\t</figcaption>\n</figure>\n</div>\n\t<h5>\n\t\tYou said earlier, “Nostalgia is overrated.” But “I Know What You Did Last Summer” was nostalgic for many of us!\t</h5>\n<p>\n\t“I Know What You Did Last Summer,” even though it’s a legacy sequel, is still kind of its own. They also brought such an amazing camp to it. That was really fun to shoot.</p>\n\t<h5>\n\t\tHow do you feel now that it’s out in the world? Do you read reviews?\t</h5>\n<p>\n\tSometimes I get curious and maybe seek out some reviews. If I’m feeling a little self-loathing, maybe I’ll even read the bad ones. Ultimately, what I love is that people are just very, very passionate about what they like and what they don’t like. They have opinions, and everyone’s entitled to that. \n\t</p>\n\t<h5>\n\t\tYou have scenes with Sarah Michelle Gellar and Freddie Prinze Jr. Did you get any time with Jennifer Love Hewitt on set, too?\t</h5>\n<p>\n\tActually, no. I met her for the first time at the premiere. Some of our days overlapped, but we were like passing ships in the night. We were on such a tight schedule. Everything was so under wraps, especially our legacy cast members — super top secret. She was so sweet, I walked up to her at the premiere and I was like, “Hi, mom. Mother!”</p>\n\t<h5>\n\t\tThat ending is also set up for a sequel, with most of the women surviving! Have you talked about what that would look like?\t</h5>\n<p>\n\tNo, we have not spoken about it at all. We’ve had a good laugh about it, and we’ve talked about what would be funny or cool but not officially.</p>\n\t<h5>\n\t\tCan I ask one plot question: Where were Danica and Ava’s (Chase Sui Wonders) parents at the end? Why didn’t anyone pick them up at the hospital?\t</h5>\n<p>\n\tI don’t know! At least Danica’s parents were at her first bridal shower. The parents were kind of an afterthought.</p>\n<div>\n<figure>\n\t\t\t<p><img srcset=\"https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/OUTERBANKS_410_Unit_28223RC.jpg 667w, https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/OUTERBANKS_410_Unit_28223RC.jpg?resize=100,150 100w, https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/OUTERBANKS_410_Unit_28223RC.jpg?resize=200,300 200w\" src=\"https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/OUTERBANKS_410_Unit_28223RC.jpg\" alt=\"\" />\n\t</p>\n\t\t\t<figcaption>\n\t\t\t\t\t<span>“Outer Banks”</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tJACKSON LEE DAVIS/NETFLIX\n\t</figcaption>\n</figure>\n</div>\n\t<h5>\n\t\tOK, let’s dive into “Outer Banks.” Production has started on Season 5. Does it feel different, knowing you’re filming the final season?\t</h5>\n<p>\n\tBesides the obvious of how much things have changed, it’s definitely already different. But knowing that this is the last go around, there’s definitely some nostalgia. There’s definitely some bittersweet energy.</p>\n\t<h5>\n\t\tIs there a time jump? \t</h5>\n<p>\n\tActually no. We pick up pretty soon after Season 4 ends. We have one big time jump in all five, but just like the prior seasons, everything happens in such a short amount of time; it feels like it would be this huge, months-long adventure, but it actually doesn’t take that much time at all. I think this one follows the same formula.</p>\n\t<h5>\n\t\tAt the end of Season 4, Sarah finds out she’s pregnant. What can you say about her journey this season?\t</h5>\n<p>\n\tWell, I’m not wearing a baby bump. Everyone’s like, “Where’s the baby?” I don’t know. I’m not jumping over walls and getting thrown off the back of boats and sprinting at full speed away from bad guys in a silicone baby bump. When I said yes to this storyline, that was my one stipulation: “Please don’t do that to me in the South Carolina summer heat.” Most of July, the heat index was 100-116.</p>\n\t<h5>\n\t\tWhen were you told the ending?\t</h5>\n<p>\n\tI have known from the beginning the way they wanted to end — not the full wrap-up, but I remember when we were first shooting Season 1, I asked [co-creator] Jonas Pate if they knew how the story ended, and in very broad strokes, three sentences, he told me.\n\t</p>\n\t<h5>\n\t\tLet’s talk about the show’s romances. With Rudy Pankow being gone, people are really hoping Rafe (Drew Starkey) and Kiara (Madison Bailey) will get together. How do you feel about that?\t</h5>\n<p>\n\tI hate that. I really don’t want to yuck anyone’s yum, but I actually think that that’s really yuck. Just because there’s a single character doesn’t mean she has to get with anyone, especially not the psychotic older brother. But maybe that’s just me! I understand — I, too, am a girl who looks and says, “I can fix him.” I get it. I’ve been there. We’ve all been there. But I just don’t think Rafe Cameron is for Kiara. She deserves better. He deserves a therapist.</p>\n\t<h5>\n\t\tI really like that you said just because she’s single, it doesn’t mean she needs to be paired off.\t</h5>\n<p>\n\tThat’s one thing I really don’t like! Sometimes, just because there’s a single girl, we refuse to try and pass the Bechdel test. So much has happened to her. She’s gone through so much, and to just throw her into a relationship storyline, I think kind of downplays all the exploration of grief, and basically her whole arc. Kiara’s always been such a strong character, and I love seeing her explore coming into her power. I know there are shippers — they keep saying it, we keep saying no!</p>\n\t<h5>\n\t\tWill you be taking a break after “Outer Banks”?\t</h5>\n<p>\n\tI say I will, but also, if I’m sitting and it’s too quiet for too long, I feel like I need to find a job. </p>\n<p>\n\t<em>This interview has been edited and condensed.</em></p>\n</div>"

It was totally necessary,” Early says, his eyes narrowing. “I feel quite heartbroken about some of the shots where you can… see it.”</p>\n<p>\n\tSitting in a park in New York’s Chinatown, Early discusses “Maddie’s Secret” publicly for the first time, ahead of its Sept. 4 premiere at the Toronto Intl. Film Festival. “It didn’t feel like drag,” Early says of his performance as Maddie. “I just felt like an actress.”</p>\n<div>\n<figure>\n\t\t\t<p><img srcset=\"https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/MADDIES-SECRET_Still-1.jpg 3840w, https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/MADDIES-SECRET_Still-1.jpg?resize=150,81 150w, https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/MADDIES-SECRET_Still-1.jpg?resize=300,162 300w\" src=\"https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/MADDIES-SECRET_Still-1.jpg?w=1024\" alt=\"\" />\n\t</p>\n\t\t\t<figcaption>\n\t\t\t\t\t<span>Eric Rahill and John Early in “Maddie’s Secret”</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCourtesy of John Early\n\t</figcaption>\n</figure>\n</div>\n<p>\n\tShot independently over just four weeks in Los Angeles, the film walks a tonal tightrope, oscillating between a lurid melodrama and a played-straight workplace soap that almost resembles a Disney Channel original movie. “I wanted it to be both a hard comedy and a hard drama, and not a dramedy,” Early says.</p>\n<p>\n\tIn the film, Maddie cheerfully navigates the politics of her jealous co-worker (Claudia O’Doherty), exacting boss (Connor O’Malley) and lesbian BFF (Berlant) at the sunny studios of Gourmaybe. But away from the ring lights, cowering in the dark corners of her home, lies a pivotal conflict that dares the viewer to take Maddie — and thus a wig-laden Early — seriously.\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\t“The transformation into Maddie is a magic trick,” says Early. “Once the audience accepts it in the beginning, then they have suspended their disbelief, and they’re willing to go along with a tone that’s very heightened.”</p>\n<p>\n\tBut while Early insists the film would not work without him embodying the female lead, it was nonetheless a risk. “I was nervous that I had written myself a role that required an incredible emotional commitment,” he says. “I had moments of paralyzing fear, where I was like, ‘You are the one holding the gun to your head. Put down the gun.’”</p>\n<p>\n\tIn fact, the entire concept for the film came from Early’s desire to play a “blonde ingénue in a high-style melodrama.” He specifically wanted it to be set in contemporary life, and he wanted to avoid a “sent-up satire,” instead aiming for something “more emotionally strange and compelling.” When it came time to develop the character, Early thought what better modern-day ingénue than a culinary content creator? “They are my princesses,” Early says. “I watch their videos at night before bed with no intention of making the recipe, but just because their presence is soothing.” Plus, “It felt very funny to me to say things like Hulu or [the Chinese sauce brand] Fly by Jing in the way that Lana Turner might have said it in the 1950s.”</p>\n<p>\n\t“Maddie’s Secret” showcases elegantly crafted, social media-ready dishes, but it also claws behind that beautiful facade and scratches at the grotesque and sometimes carnal way we view food.</p>\n<p>\n\t“Half of my algorithm is Turkish men getting their pecks rubbed with oil, and the other half is girls emulsifying pasta in a pan, where the noodles are slapping the edge, and it’s really creamy and buttery,” Early says. “It’s unmistakably sexual, you know? There was something very dark in my algorithm with the intersection of food and sex.”</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd central to the film is not only how we consume food but how it can, in turn, consume us.</p>\n<p>\n\t“I obviously knew that I was stepping into something very sensitive and potentially very painful for people,” Early says of depicting Maddie’s eating disorder. “But I’ve always felt that it’s the job of art to drill fearlessly into the emotions of it, instead of carefully stepping back. It’s not a filmmaker’s job to be educational about these issues, it’s about exploding them into mythic proportions.”</p>\n</div>"

    "body": "<div><p>\n\t<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/jessica-chastain/\">Jessica Chastain</a>’s path to stardom began at age 7, after watching a production of “Joseph and the Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat.”<br /></p>\n<p>\n\t“My grandmother took me,” Chastain remembers. “It was the first time I realized it was a job that people could have, and after watching it, I was like, ‘Oh, I’m an actor.’”<br /></p>\n<p>\n\tOn Sept. 4, that status will be permanently enshrined in showbiz history when she receives her very own star on the Hollywood <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/walk-of-fame/\">Walk of Fame</a>. Even so, the journey from starry-eyed spectator to industry mainstay was anything but a straight line for the actress.<br />\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\t“I felt it really young,” Chastain tells Variety. “Even though I dropped out of high school and went back and got my diploma later on, I was voted ‘Most Talented’ in our yearbook. So very early on, I was getting feedback that it was something I was good at, and that helped a lot.” Despite that praise, the future star of “The Tree of Life,” “Zero Dark Thirty,” “Interstellar” and “The Martian” hadn’t yet set her sights on anything so ambitious as movie stardom: “I thought I was going to be in the Oregon Shakespeare Festival Repertory Company,” she admits.<br />\n</p>\n<p>\n\tHer work on stage led to a scholarship at Juilliard, and only after that did she begin to make her first industry inroads. “It was hard auditioning, because don’t think I was a type that people necessarily maybe saw for the character that they were casting physically,” the natural redhead recalls. Critics weren’t altogether kinder: her first high-profile mention in the Hollywood trades came when a 2006 <em>Variety</em> review panned the then 29-year-old’s performance in a production of “Salomé” opposite Al Pacino, one of two former collaborators who will be present at the ceremony to receive her star. The experience proved uniquely instructive.\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\t<br />“It’s something I think is really important for actors to learn, and it was such an example in that scenario, that one person’s opinion isn’t everyone else’s,” she observes. “‘Salomé’ launched me in terms of having a film career,” Chastain insists. “All of a sudden, I started from nothing to get leads, and it was because people went to see that play — and they thought I did a good job.”</p>\n<p>\n\t<br />Rather than enduring a fallow period, she spent the next five years of her planting seeds that wouldn’t stop blooming: Chastain premiered six films in 2011 alone. “It’s the year I got my first Oscar nomination [for ‘The Help],” she says. “I’d made ‘The Tree of Life’ four years before opposite Brad Pitt and Sean Penn, the biggest actors working at the time. But the years that I had to wait for all this stuff to come out gave me the opportunity to really study how I wanted to be in the industry.”</p>\n<p>\n\t<br />“The Help” in particular introduced her to Viola Davis, who alongside Pacino will also speak on her behalf at the Sept. 3 event. Davis says she instantly recognized in Chastain a kindred spirit, both as a collaborator and an individual. “‘The Help’ was one of those experiences where, every once in a while, you do a project with people and you know that they’re going to be a part of your life forever.”</p>\n<p>\n\t<br />“A part of it is because we were all thrust in Greenwood, Miss., for three months — there wasn’t a lot to do but go to Walmart or Sonic,” Davis says. “But with all of those women, Jessica included, not enough can be said about their bravery — the bravery to release one’s vanity, one’s ego, and just to get down to the brass tacks of the work. She’s someone who doesn’t mistake their presence for the event.”</p>\n<p>\n\t<br />While releasing four more films across 2012, Chastain earned her second Academy Award nomination for playing a CIA analyst in Kathryn Bigelow’s “Zero Dark Thirty.” Showcasing her skillset so vividly in such a short span of time led to opportunities to work with industry legends like Liv Ullmann, Christopher Nolan, Ridley Scott and Guillermo Del Toro. It also whet her appetite for roles that were thornier than could be condensed in a script’s cover-page logline. “There was a few years where I was saying, ‘Please, can we stop saying strong female character?” she remembers.\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\t<br />“The reality is biologically, women have a stronger threshold of pain than men — they give birth — so all women are strong,” Chastain points out. “But I’m excited to play characters that are really complex, where I’m OK if someone leaves my film and goes, ‘I’m not sure I liked it.’ I want to push people a little bit outside their comfort zone.”</p>\n<p>\n\t<br />Since then, she’s done that again and again, with the help of several regular collaborators, including Davis (whom she reunited with in “The Disappearance of Eleanor Rigby”), Oscar Issac (“A Most Violent Year,” “Scenes From a Marriage”) and Michael Shannon (“Take Shelter,” “George &amp; Tammy”). Chastain acknowledges that there are many incredible filmmakers she wants to work with she’ll likely be unable to, but says there’s one in particular she’s still holding out hope for: “Michael Haneke. I don’t know how many more movies he’s going to make, but I think he’s so incredible.”</p>\n<p>\n\t<br />Chastain has consistently balanced those patience-testing projects with crowd pleasers, appearing in splashy franchise films like “The Huntsman: Winter’s War,” “Dark Phoenix” and “It: Chapter Two.” “I don’t think in terms of ‘one for me and one for them,’” she maintains. “Because they’ve all got to be for them, and they’ve all got to be for me. Otherwise, what are you doing?” Yet in the absence of certain opportunities being offered to her by virtue of her acting pedigree or box office muscle, Chastain formed Freckle Films in 2016 to develop her own projects. The company’s second film, “The Eyes of Tammy Faye,” earned Chastain a best actress Oscar.</p>\n<p>\n\t<br />While nuturing a thriving career and raising two children, Chastain is enrolled at the John F. Kennedy School of Government at Harvard University, where she’s getting her master’s degree in public administration. “I am really excited about learning about society from an anthropological point of view,” she says. Perhaps that’s why she seems particularly thrilled about the quotidian pleasures of having her own star on the Walk of Fame, even more than the spectacle. “I’m excited that it’ll just be there, and my kids will be able to take pictures and swipe the gum off of it.”\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\t<br />Yet even if Chastain regards the “incredibly meaningful” honor with a decidedly simpler sense of gratitude and appreciation, Davis is quick to highlight the breadth of accomplishments that the five-pointed landmark encompasses for her friend and colleague. “I see this award as a culmination of one’s career,” Davis says.</p>\n<p>\n\t<br />“Jessica’s commitment is to the artistry of the work, but also you see her using her platform as a way of leaving a legacy — and what’s really wonderful about Jessica is the anticipation of what and who she is going to become. When I meet her, I always see someone who has a new goal and a new landscape and a new terrain to explore. And I think that’s going to carry her into even her older years. She’s an artist, and she’s an extraordinary human being.”</p>\n</div>"

    "body": "<div><p>\n\tOne of audio entertainment’s top studios is hitting the gas on a fresh slate of top-tier titles, including a new season of “Revisionist History” from <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/pushkin-industries/\">Pushkin Industries</a> co-founder Malcom Gladwell and author <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/michael-lewis/\">Michael Lewis</a> revisiting “<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/the-big-short/\">The Big Short</a>” as an audio book and companion podcast.</p>\n<p>\n\tPushkin execs are also touting the return of “Heavyweight,” the deep-dive exploration of issues and personal relationships hosted by Jonathan Goldstein, who acts like “a therapist with a time machine,” per the company. The first season to air under the Pushkin banner debuts Sept. 18 for a 10-episode run.\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\t“This new slate of podcasts showcases the passion we have at Pushkin for the power of creative and premium audio storytelling,” Pushkin CEO Gretta Cohn told <em>Variety</em>. “We are excited by what our dynamic roster of storytellers will bring to audiences as we continue building the future of audio — one story at a time.”\n</p>\n<p>\n\tThe fall release slate comes as Pushkin also renews its podcast ad sales and distribution pact with iHeartMedia. Pushkin Industries, founded in 2018 by Gladwell and former Slate Group CEO Jacob Weisberg, first teamed with iHeart in 2020. Weisberg is CEO of Pushkin. Eric Sandler, Pushkin’s chief strategy officer, discusses the audio studio’s creative ethos and business outlook in an interview featured on the Sept. 4 edition of the “Daily Variety” podcast.</p>\n<p>\n\tPushkin has big plans to mark the 10-year anniversary of the movie “The Big Short,” based on Lewis’ best-seller of the same name. The Adam McKay-helmed film starring Christian Bale, Steve Carell, Ryan Gosling and Brad Pitt captured the dynamics that led to the mortgage meltdown of 2008-09 crisis.\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\tOn Oct. 14, Pushkin will publish the first audiobook edition of “The Big Short” narrated by Lewis, the highly regarded scribe behind such nonfiction books as “Moneyball” and “Liar’s Poker.” Lewis also hosts the eclectic “Against the Rules” recurring Pushkin podcast. On the same day as the audiobook release, Lewis will launch a companion “Big Short” podcast “exploring how the events detailed in the book led to what we see happening in U.S. politics more than a decade later,” per Pushkin.</p>\n<p>\n\tLidia Jean Kott, a reporter known to Pushkin listeners for her work with Lewis on “Against the Rules,” will take the helm of her own investigative docuseries “The Chinatown Sting,” about a notorious Manhattan undercover drug bust in the late 1980s. The six-episode run begins Sept. 16.</p>\n<p>\n\tGladwell returns to his long-running “Revisionist History” series with a deep dive into the disturbing Alabama murder case involving surrounding the 1988 murder of Elizabeth Sennett. The long sordid legal saga came to a somber end in January 2024 when Kenneth Eugene Smith was executed via nitrogen gas in Alabama after being convicted in a murder-for-hire plot. “At its core, it’s a story about the cascade of moral failures, performative justice, and why systems set up to relieve suffering so often make suffering worse,” per Pushkin. The seven-episode season bows Oct. 2.</p>\n<p>\n\tLeon Neyfakh, host of Pushkin’s historical docu-series “Fiasco,” turns his prism to “a hard look at the 2012 attack on the U.S. diplomatic compound in Benghazi, Libya and the ramifications it had on everything from social media to world politics.” The six-episode season bows Sept. 18.</p>\n<p>\n\tIn addition to publishing a range of podcasts, the Pushkin network includes a healthy menu of audiobook titles. </p>\n<p>\n\tPushkin’s fall lineup also includes fresh episodes of six returning series:</p>\n<p>\n\t** “The Happiness Lab”<br />** “Cautionary Tales”<br />** “Broken Record”<br />** “A Slight Change of Plans”<br />** “Risky Business”<br />** “What’s Your Problem?”</p>\n</div>"

It recently wrapped production at Versa Studios in partnership with Dimension Studios. </p>\n<div><p>\n\t“Sirius”<strong> </strong>boasts an ensemble cast that includes Simon Sears (“Secrets We Keep”), Søren Malling (“Off the Record”), Jason Wong (“Dungeons &amp; Dragons: Honor Among Thieves”), Jon Xue Zhang (“The Brothers Sun”), Aiden Cheng (“Trying”), Rob Kazinsky (“Star Trek: Section 31”), Aidan Cheng (“3 Body Problem”), Bruce Chong ( “The Gentleman”), Samuel Edward-Cook (“Peaky Blinders”), Wade Briggs (“Heads of State”) and Ben Batt (“Toxic Town”).  Academy Award-winning editor Lee Smith (“Dunkirk”) will direct from a screenplay by Tony Mosher.</p><p> <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/neon/\">Neon</a> International is representing foreign sales rights and will continue sales in Toronto. Decal, Neon’s specialty label, will handle the film’s wide release in the U.S.</p></div>\n<div><p>\n\tPascal Degove and Matt Williams are producing for Future Artists Entertainment.

They lead a strong ensemble of international talent who each bring real weight and authenticity to the story.”</p><p> The Neon International sales slate includes Osgood Perkins’ “The Young People” starring Lola Tung and Nico Parker; Damian McCarthy’s “Hokum” starring Adam Scott; Takashi Miike’s next film “Bad Lieutenant: Tokyo” starring Shun Oguri and Lily James; and Kevin Bacon’s “Family Movie” starring Bacon and Kyra Sedgwick.</p><p> Cole is represented by UTA and The Way.
