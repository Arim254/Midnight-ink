    "body": "<div><p>\n\tThe industry’s 12 biggest media and entertainment companies set another new content-spending record in 2024, paying out around $210 billion, up 4% on the year, according to an analysis by <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/kpmg/\">KPMG</a>.</p>\n<p>\n\t<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/comcast/\">Comcast</a>/NBCUniversal held the No. 1 spot on KPMG’s ranking of 2024 content spending among the biggest players, with an outlay of $37 billion (flat with 2023). That’s followed by <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/youtube/\">YouTube</a> ($32 billion), <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/disney/\">Disney</a> ($28), Amazon ($20 billion) and Netflix ($17 billion).\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\tFrom 2020 to 2024, KPMG estimates that content spending among the cohort has climbed at a 10% compound annual growth rate (CAGR), fueled by traditional media companies investing in their own direct-to-consumer streaming services like Disney+, NBCU’s Peacock, Warner Bros. Discovery’s HBO Max and Paramount+.\n</p>\n<figure></figure>\n<p>\n\tBut according to KPMG’s analysis, the biz hasn’t hit its content-spending ceiling yet. “While some argue that ‘peak content’ has been reached, we believe the industry is far from saturation — although the reality is more nuanced,” the firm says in the report, “Money in Motion: The Future of Content Spend and Business Models in Media,” released Tuesday. “Content spend is not growing uniformly across formats and genres.” For example, investments in sports rights have continued to rise, while investments in other areas like scripted and reality programming have slowed.</p>\n<p>\n\t“It’s not just about ‘more content’ now. We’re seeing more deliberate investment,” said Scott Purdy, media strategy leader for KPMG U.S. “Leaders are using their learnings from the past few years and the increasing power of data-driven insights to prioritize their bets, shape creative decisions, and drive better returns.”\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\tIn particular, the shift toward user-generated content and ad-supported models and the ongoing growth of free, ad-supported streaming services (such as Paramount’s Pluto TV and Fox’s Tubi) are poised to drive further content expansion, per the report. The growth of UGC has outpaced other segments and “will likely see continued expansion, fueled by increased ad dollars and a robust creator economy,” the KPMG report says.</p>\n<p>\n\tKPMG’s report also addresses the “evolving” impact of AI. Artificial intelligence will make certain elements of the production process likely both faster and cheaper over time, and in the near term “AI will augment the production process, rather than take it over,” according to the firm. </p>\n<p>\n\t“AI is rewriting the content playbook — creation, personalization, distribution, monetization,” said Frank Albarella, KPMG’s U.S. sector leader, media and telecommunications. “Media leaders thoughtfully and strategically experimenting with AI today are building tomorrow’s competitive advantage.”</p>\n<p>\n\tFor the report, KPMG compiled data from primary and secondary sources between April-August 2025. The firm’s content-spending estimates are based on a select group of “large, publicly traded media companies” with financial data spanning 2020-24.</p>\n</div>"

    "body": "<div><p>\n\tWhat are some of the major issues currently faced by European powerhouses in the international market today? In a panel during the Creative Investors’ Conference at the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/san-sebastian-film-festival-2/\">San Sebastián Film Festival</a>, leading figures within European production and distribution spoke about the need for a joint continental mindset, how the severe challenges facing the U.S. co-production market affected the euro landscape and the need to regulate platforms like YouTube in an increasingly digital market. \n\t</p>\n<p>\n\tCEO of global drama at <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/fremantle/\">Fremantle</a>, Christian Vesper, said the British multinational has been “very good” at making “mainly small, disciplined European films.” Their main challenge now is to be more like the Fremantle’s Irish film studio Element Pictures, with the exec highlighting how impressive it is for a company to be behind films like Yorgos Lanthimos’ “Bugonia” and Harry Lighton’s “Pillion” within the same calendar year. “For our companies to thrive, we need to find this level of scale diversity.” \n</p>\n<p>\n\tManaging director at France’s <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/mediawan/\">Mediawan</a> Pictures, Elisabeth d’Arvieu, praised the current European market, calling it “almost perfect.” “The U.S. co-production market has been almost closed for the last three years,” she said. “Now, in Europe, we have almost everything. We have a great pool of creative talents in all categories, fantastic locations, state-of-the-art technical teams and studio facilities.” </p>\n<p>\n\tAll of that, d’Arvieu reiterated, is combined with two key European advantages in efficient tax incentives and subsidies and regulations that largely protect creators and independent producers. “All of that combined is working super efficiently. The proof of that is that it has allowed us major European powerhouses to emerge in front of the U.S. studios. Today, some of the biggest production companies are European.”\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\tChief distribution officer of <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/studio-tf1/\">Studio TF1</a>, Rodolphe Buet, divided the main challenges into three categories: the instability in securing financing from traditional players such as linear television, which has historically supported European production and currently faces cost reductions across the continent; box office numbers that have not recovered since COVID; and what he calls the “U.S. situation,” referring to how independent distribution in the U.S. has been squeezed in recent years, decreasing the slots for the distribution of European arthouse films even further. </p>\n<div>\n<figure>\n<p><img srcset=\"https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/4243_D002_00037.jpg 4500w, https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/4243_D002_00037.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/4243_D002_00037.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/4243_D002_00037.jpg?resize=1920,1280 1920w, https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/4243_D002_00037.jpg?resize=1360,907 1360w, https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/4243_D002_00037.jpg?resize=1000,667 1000w, https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/4243_D002_00037.jpg?resize=910,607 910w, https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/4243_D002_00037.jpg?resize=681,454 681w, https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/4243_D002_00037.jpg?resize=450,300 450w, https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/4243_D002_00037.jpg?resize=250,167 250w\" src=\"https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/4243_D002_00037.jpg?w=1024\" alt=\"\" />\n\t</p>\n<figcaption>\n\t\t\t\t\t<span>Emma Stone stars in Yorgos Lanthimos’ “Bugonia” (Courtesy of Atsushi Nishijima/Focus Features)</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tAtsushi Nishijima/Focus Features\n\t</figcaption>\n</figure>\n</div>\n<p>\n\tOne burning issue to emerge from the conversation was the threat of YouTube as a growing player in Europe. David Atlan-Jackson, chief content officer at <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/vuelta-group/\">Vuelta Group</a>, portrayed the platform as one of its “main competitors.” “Because of the fragmentation of the landscape in terms of distribution, the audience has become very selective and knowledgeable. There is no more space for lukewarm content.” </p>\n<p>\n\tBuet called YouTube “one of the key threats” in Europe. “They are catching a significant part of the audience without contributing to the global ecosystem. YouTube counts for more views than all platforms together [in Europe], but they tend to contribute [only] 50% of the cost of production of the creators. The reality is that they are supporting very few creators and are catching part of the traditional views that support the financing of TV and films in Europe. We have to find ways to regulate the system in Europe to make sure we will still support talent and creators to make great European television and films.”</p>\n<p>\n\tThe execs were asked about a statement released by the European Producers Club on Sunday, highlighting their concerns over proposals to replace Creative Europe, the European Union program that supports and promotes culture and media. According to the EPC, the proposed change raises “serious concerns for the future of independent European audiovisual creation.”</p>\n<p>\n\t“I’m not worried,” Buet said. “I think the European Commission understands how culture is key to protecting and defending European values. There are some discussions around the independent European community on who should be able to access the support. We should work together instead of finding ways for some of us not to be able to access the support of Creative Europe,” he added.\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\tOn the financing side, Vesper spoke about how “celebrities” and high-profile projects matter when securing early financing stakes, but, for Fremantle, it is about how to best support their production companies to make the films they want to make. The exec cited “Bugonia” as a recent example, saying that, alongside Element Pictures, Fremantle was able to greenlight the project before taking it to market. “It was us putting our weight behind a project. It’s a lot of work to get my board to support that. But we have faith in them and we want to be able to create as much leverage as possible on a market.” In the case of Kristen Stewart’s directorial debut “The Chronology of Water,” Fremantle relocated the shoot from Oregon to Latvia, enabling the actor-turned-director to “make the film she wanted to make because it didn’t cost that much.”</p>\n<p>\n\t“We do finance films. We prefer to go to the market with CAA or Film Nation and put equity investments where we need to,” he concluded.</p>\n<div>\n<figure>\n<p><img srcset=\"https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/187638.jpg 1600w, https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/187638.jpg?resize=150,84 150w, https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/187638.jpg?resize=300,169 300w, https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/187638.jpg?resize=125,70 125w, https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/187638.jpg?resize=1000,563 1000w, https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/187638.jpg?resize=910,511 910w, https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/187638.jpg?resize=681,383 681w, https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/187638.jpg?resize=450,253 450w, https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/187638.jpg?resize=250,140 250w\" src=\"https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/187638.jpg?w=1024\" alt=\"\" />\n\t</p>\n<figcaption>\n\t\t\t\t\t<span>Kristen Stewart’s directorial debut “The Chronology of Water”</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCourtesy of Cannes Film Festival\n\t</figcaption>\n</figure>\n</div>\n<p>\n\tOther ways to assist with revenue are, of course, to expand audience reach. On that, Buet mentioned Studio TF1’s recent deal with Netflix. Starting in summer 2026, all Netflix members in France will be able to watch TF1 channels and on-demand content from TF1+ directly on Netflix in a deal signed last June. </p>\n<p>\n\t“People are watching less television, and we are facing the competition of platforms,” Buet said. “When we look at the figures in France, 50% of the Netflix subscribers never watched TF1 Plus, mainly because the demographic is not similar. Being in a position to get a greater reach for the films and television we are financing is key. The more we strengthen the position of TF1 in access to audiences, the better it will be for the industry, the more we will contribute with the revenue we generate.”</p>\n</div>"

Several other candidates among the 24 titles in the running to be designated made their debut in competition at Venice this year, including Gianfranco Rosi’s doc “Below the Clouds,” which won the Special Jury Prize at Venice. Other submissions in the running that recently launched in competition from the lido and were considered frontrunners included Pietro Marcello’s “Duse,” starring Valeria Bruni Tedeschi as legendary actress Eleonora Duse, and Leonardo Di Costanzo’s psychological drama “Elisa.”   \n\t</p>\n<p>\n\tPaolo Sorrentino’s Venice opener “La Grazia” was not on the list due to its scheduled early 2026 release date.\n</p>\n<p>\n\t“Familia” follows the harrowing journey of Luigi, a young man grappling with a toxic family legacy and his entanglement with extremist ideologies. Based on Luigi Celeste’s autobiographical book “It Won’t Be Like This Forever,” the story delves into the destructive cycles of violence and the struggle for redemption.</p>\n<p>\n\t“Familia” launched in 2024 from the Venice’s Horizons strand and won the section’s prize for best actor which went to Francesco Gheghi. The film’s cast also  conprises Barbara Ronchi (“Kidnapped” by Marco Bellochio), and Francesco Di Leva (“Nostalgia” by Mario Martone). \n\t</p>\n<p>\n\tCostabile previously garnered critical acclaim for his debut feature “Una Femmina — The Code of Silence” about women who’ve had the courage to break away from the grip of the Calabrian mob’s blood ties and codes. </p>\n<p>\n\t“Familia” is produced by Attilio de Razza and Nicola Picone at Rome-based Tramp Limited. The co-producers are Nicola Giuliano at Rome’s Indigo Film and Pierpaolo Verga at Naples’ O’Groove, and in association with Medusa Film.</p>\n<p>\n\tAMPAS will unveil the 15 films shortlisted in the international feature film category on Dec. 16.</p>\n</div>"

In this case, through the short life of a man who embodies the promiscuous relationship between public security and criminality,” Lima tells<em> Variety</em>. “The very notion of property defence in a country forged in the violence of slavery. The process was similar to sifting through a box of evidence from an old crime, like those cold-case shows we see on cable TV.”</p>\n<p>\n\tA drama, “(Des)controle,” helmed by Rosane Svartman and Carol Minêm, turns on a female writer who has to deal with family and professional challenges and a drinking problem.</p>\n<p>\n\tMiguel Falabella’s and Hsu Chien’s “Querido Mundo” is based on a Falabella play.

    "body": "<div><p>\n\tSpain, in a way, has its own “Adolescence.” No company can hope to break out in their wildest dreams as the Netflix U.K. drama.</p>\n<p>\n\tNonetheless, where comparison can be drawn with Spanish series “Puberty” (“Pubertad”), <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/leticia-dolera/\">Leticia Dolera</a>’s follow-up as a creator to her top Canneseries prize winner “Perfect Life,” is that “Puberty” also focuses on the issue of teen violence, here filtered through the lens of adolescent sexual abuse.\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\tSold by <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/beta-film/\">Beta Film</a> and to be released in Spain and Portugal by <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/hbo-max/\">HBO Max</a> on Sept. 24, “Puberty” was presented by Dolera and producer Miriam Porté at a high-profile press conference Monday, Sept. 22, at Spain’s San Sebastián Film Festival, where Dolera walked an industry audience through three emblematic scenes from the six-part series.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tPorté recalled at the press conference that the project began with Dolera, whose early commitment allowed development to move forward. Once it had taken shape, the team turned to Catalonia’s cultural authorities. “Because this is not a series in Catalan, somehow it’s like a natural gateway, so they were the first to support the project,” she said. That support was quickly followed by Francisco Vargas, director of the audiovisual area at ICEC, who, Porté noted, “immediately understood that ambitious, large-scale, quality series needed support, and they supported us.” TV3 and 3CAT soon came on board. “It would have been impossible without HBO, totally impossible,” she added, describing the financing process as “very complex.”</p>\n<p>\n\tIn the first clip, Julia, a single mother and successful feminist journalist, and her teen son eat lunch with her father Marti Sr., (Lluís Marco) head of a local human tower collective in a small town in Catalonia, and Martí her brother played by Xavi Sáez, who will take over the group given the father’s illness. Martí Sr. is spoiling for an argument with Julia, its catalyst comes when the mother mentions in conciliatory fashion that there’s now even a feminist human pyramid. “Even with that, you lot aren’t happy,” spits Martí Sr. Julia rises to the bait. “Maybe they [feminists] have motives,” she answers back. “The kid needs a male reference,” Martí retorts. Julia’s son looks uncomfortable. Then Pol, Martí’s macho young teen son, turns up, who obviously won’t get on with Julia’s boy. \n\t</p>\n<p>\n\t“The series has multiple layers,” Dolera tells <em>Variety.</em> “One is legacy, in many ways. One is cultural and patriarchal, another family-based and psychological. All the psychological inheritance, taboos, how masculinity models pass from father to son and grandson.”</p>\n<p>\n\tBy this time, the series has already shown the local castle team, rehearsing for a competition the next day. Why did Dolera set “Puberty” in a small Catalan town in the world of human tower builders? “The human towers reflect a society, how you have to work as a group,” she said. “Societies aren’t created by individualized stay-at-home members. Creating a castle means meeting people, doing something together, where values, structures, ethical consensus come into play. Today, that seems almost revolutionary — the human trust. If the castle isn’t well built, it will fall, because it’s fragile, like communities. So the human towers are a beautiful paradigm of human beings, of their light and shade, their contradictions.”</p>\n<p>\n\tThe second clip sees Julia meeting with Estel, a friend played by Betsy Túrnez (“The 47”), who recalls an incident when she was a teen with a boy, Ortiz, who wanted sex. She refused. He suggested oral sex instead. She didn’t want to, but went along. “This isn’t a case of crime, but an area which can generate wounds, traumas, in both parties,” Dolera explained. Later we see the incident marked Estel’s self-esteem, while Ortiz’s perception of women and sexuality is also warped.</p>\n<p>\n\tMeanwhile, rumors build on social media that three teens in the castells team are involved in a sexual aggression case. In a third scene, the group debates what to do. Some want to go to the police. Others worry that going public will cost sponsors. Another reason for Martí’s caution may be that his son Pol is one of the accused. “The scene shows, above all, the confusion suffered by adults, who don’t know how to address the subject. It’s a key, centerpiece scene in the series,” Dolera said.</p>\n<p>\n\tThat confusion reflects a broader generational disconnect, Dolera suggested: “So, I think it’s about reflecting as a community on this problem that I believe is already blowing up in our faces, because I have the feeling that there are generations of kids who have grown up with a phone in their hands, and whose parents are a bit lost, also absorbed by a capitalist system that increasingly swallows them up and demands more of their time at work to pay for housing, to pay for a lot of things, right?”\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\t“Puberty” is produced by Porté’s Distinto Films and Corte y Confección y Uri Films, both headed by Oriol Maymó, two of Catalonia’s most successful companies.</p>\n<p>\n\tLaunched by Miriam Porté, Barcelona-based Distinto Films is behind Berlin 2025 Panorama Audience Award winner “Deaf,” SXSW best performance laureate “Mamífera” and Lucía Aleñar’s “Forastera,” which just over a week ago scooped a Toronto Fipresci International Critics’ Prize for Emerging Filmmakers.</p>\n<p>\n\tMaymó produced Cannes Jury Prize winner “Sirât,” series “Vida Perfecta” and “La Línea Invisible” as well as Sundance-selected “Buried” and took a production credit on “[REC 3] Genesis” and “[REC 4] Apocalypse.”</p>\n<p>\n\tDistinto Films and Maymó’s Uri Films produce “Puberty” with Brussels’ AT-Prod. Go-ahead Catalan public broadcaster 3Cat co-produces.</p>\n</div>"

    "body": "<div><p>\n\tNorwegian auteur <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/joachim-trier/\">Joachim Trier</a> got honest about fatherhood during an in-depth conversation event at the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/san-sebastian-film-festival-2/\">San Sebastián Film Festival</a>. In the Basque city to present his Cannes-winning drama “<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/sentimental-value/\">Sentimental Value</a>” — Norway’s official entry for the best international feature film Oscar race — the director was asked how he “relates” to the film’s main character, Gustav Borg. The fictional film director played by Stellan Skarsgård is professionally renowned but emotionally distant, having traded a healthy relationship with his two daughters for a lauded career in film. \n\t</p>\n<p>\n\t“You’re asking a big question,” pointed out the director. “This is the first film I made while having two children. I said going in, ‘I’m really scared of failing as a father,’ and it’s very symbolic to make this film for me because I don’t want to be Borg. We shot in Oslo, I could go home every night, and that was a big deal for me. That was one of the big achievements of this film for me, too.”\n</p>\n<p>\n\t“I was longing to have children,” continued Trier before pivoting into commenting about how feminist advancements in Norway changed the way parents work on set — both male and female. “We’ve had a lot of progression [with] female directors over the last 15, 20 years. That has been great for us male directors too because we have gotten a focus on good set culture where the macho energy is lessened. It’s not just tough guys but also private conversations about balancing being an artist with the demands on you as a director, and also having children.”</p>\n<p>\n\t“The feminist discourse around cinema has helped men allow ourselves this bigger freedom of figuring out open conversations around how we make movies,” he highlighted, before adding that he feels he is an “okay father even though I’m a film director.”\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\tThe filmmaker said he was being “very personal” with his answer to the question because he felt it was an “important one,” especially given he had children later in life and wanted to be a “responsible parent.” Trier recalled a moment during the pre-production phase of “Sentimental Value” when assistant director Lars Thomas told him to leave the office to catch his daughter’s kindergarten play. “Just run now. You don’t want to be Gustav Borg,” said Thomas. “I saw the play and wept because she was great. I’m being a bit cheesy here, forgive me, but those things matter.”</p>\n<p>\n\tTrier’s preoccupations with a healthy set are also a testament to his directing philosophy. When speaking about his role on set, the filmmaker said his job is to sit next to the camera and show actors “love.” “It sounds cheesy, but it really is. And if I’m not open to the possibility of the unexpected, we won’t create something that has life.”</p>\n<p>\n\t“The directorial position is so often this man of power,” he reiterated. “It’s macho bullshit. I feel the opposite. Yes, I will have to lead the team and make up my mind and be quick, but ultimately, it’s a humble position of just gratitude. Like, ‘O.K., we are going to try this thing and we could fuck it up but I believe in you.’ That’s what matters. Outside the set, we’ve got to do a lot of fighting to get the money and make sure no one steps on our creativity, but on set we have to be humble towards the actors.”</p>\n<p>\n\tThe Norwegian auteur also retains full control creatively outside of the set, emphasizing that he won’t negotiate his final cut rights. “I’ve had [final cut] since film one,” he said when recalling how he spent some time in the U.S. following the success of his 2006 debut “Reprise,” which got picked up by Miramax and did well outside of Europe. When Trier tried to make his sophomore feature in the U.S. afterwards, he realized the industry post the 2008 crisis was not as open to creative autonomy and auteurship as they were in the late ’90s, when major studios launched independent labels and placed their chips on more daring filmmakers. </p>\n<p>\n\t“To me, it’s a moral implication of taking responsibility for what the actors give a director,” he added of final cut. “If they show their emotions, their bodies, I carry the responsibility of what they bring to the final product.” \n\t</p>\n<p>\n\tOnce Trier realized he wouldn’t manage to make his sophomore feature within the U.S. studio system, the director looked back to his home country. The result was “Oslo, August 31st,” which he called a “panic reaction” to taking too long to follow up on his debut. “When I did ‘Reprise,’ 80% of directors only made one film,” he pointed out, adding that his second feature spawned out of a desire to prove he could make a film “really fast.”</p>\n<p>\n\tTrier made a point to emphasize that his English-language debut, “Louder Than Bombs,” might have featured major American talent such as Jesse Eisenberg, but was still made within the European financing model. “I only work in the European financing system, and I’m super happy about it. It’s given me a platform to express myself freely,” he said, noting that this freedom is “constantly under political threat.”</p>\n<p>\n\t“Right-wing political movements are always trying to diminish the idea of soft money support for the arts across most countries in Europe,” he continued. “It’s important that we have a system that protects free expression through the arts. We need support. Most art has always been supported by someone with an intention of not just making money, but supporting artistic expression.”</p>\n<p>\n\tThe director emphasized the importance of the European financing model not only when it comes to production but, vitally, distribution. “I think it’s important to be aware that there are incentives to distribute films between our cultures. So when I grew up watching Pedro Almodóvar’s films, and what [I] like about him is the feeling he has a universe which is his. When I was growing up, I didn’t want to see him go to L.A. and do a heist movie.”</p>\n<p>\n\tNeon will open Joachim Trier’s “Sentimental Value” in limited release on Nov. 7. The San Sebastián Film Festival runs Sept. 19-27</p>\n</div>"

    "body": "<div><p>\n\tAs one of the five Films to Come at this year’s Incubator program of the Madrid Film School (ECAM), “Face of Grace” (“Cara de santa”) features a host of women behind the camera. It will be co-helmed by Anna Martí Domingo and Laura Santos Martí and produced by Mayca Sanz of Allegra Films and Laura Rubirola of Nocturna Pictures.</p>\n<p>\n\tThe project focuses on a subject matter close to their hearts, born organically out of conversations around a theme that has deeply unsettled them and raised many questions.\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\t“A lot of these questions came from talking with our mothers and reflecting on their place in the world. That’s where the film originates — from that intergenerational dialogue between our generation and the generation of women born in the 1960s. Although the story is fictional, they were undeniably a key starting point for its creation,” say Domingo and Santos Marti.  \n</p>\n<p>\n\t“Face of Grace” follows 63-year-old Dolores who as a teacher, a wife and mother has always lived up to expectations. Her life in Barcelona is stable but suffocating: a dull marriage, a grown son about to make her a grandmother, and yet another Christmas far from her hometown. </p>\n<p>\n\tOn Christmas Eve, something snaps. After feeling provoked, she assaults a man in public — an impulsive, violent act that seems completely out of character. Suddenly, she’s thrust into a hostile system that puts her sanity and womanhood on trial. The world says she’s lost control, but something deeper has been set in motion.</p>\n<p>\n\tAsked how they plan to split the directing tasks between them, the answer comes easy to them.\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\t“Each of us brings our own personal experience in the industry and our individual background, which turn out to be very complementary when it comes to directing,” they say. Domingo’s has had some directing experience, having made the short “Nens,” which played at Valladolid’s Seminci last year, and has had more experience in directing actors. Santos Marti, on the other hand, was the production designer behind such lauded films as “Salve María” by Mar Coll, and has a stronger command of the formal aspects — the visual style and the camera.</p>\n<p>\n\tWhile it will be the first time for them to co-direct a feature, they’ve worked together on the same sets. The project took shape when they were selected for the Feature Film Script Residency at the prestigious EICTV – International Film and Television School of Cuba.</p>\n<p>\n\t“The idea was in a very early stage, and that residency helped solidify it. Thanks to the guidance of the mentors and the sessions we received, we left with a strong foundation that became the starting point for what the film is today. The way the school approaches screenwriting — their vision and methodology — is something we’ve carried with us ever since, and we’re not letting it go. It was an incredible and enriching experience,” they say.</p>\n<p>\n\tFor producing partners Sanz and Rubirola, the project captivated them at once. “We were deeply intrigued by the questions it raises and the debate it can spark. “‘Face of Grace’<em> </em>is a film that shines a light on society’s reaction when the rules that govern our coexistence are broken, and a physical aggression is used as a response to a perceived offense. Specifically: how does society react when the rule-breaker is a woman? Is she judged the same way as a man? And what happens when that woman is a social pillar, a schoolteacher?” they say.</p>\n<p>\n\t“The seemingly inexplicable violent outburst of a 63-year-old educator and mother puts both her sanity and her place in the community on trial. At the same time, it reveals the everyday frustrations many women of a certain age face—and how they are seen by their children and society at large,” they reflect.</p>\n<p>\n\tAt the moment, the project has the development support of the Catalan Goverment’s <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/icec/\">ICEC</a> in Catalonia as well as the resources provided by ECAM’s Incubator, which has allowed them to participate in Focus Coproduction at Cannes and the EAVE marketing training.\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\t“We also hope to secure production support from ICEC, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/icaa/\">ICAA</a>, public broadcasters and streaming platforms, as well as bring on a European partner to access <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/eurimages/\">Eurimages</a> and additional funds to complete the production,” the producers say.</p>\n<p>\n\tPrincipal photography will take place in Barcelona, which plays a pivotal role in the story. “We want to portray Barcelona at Christmas, which is the time frame in which Dolores’s story unfolds. We hope to begin filming in the winter of 2026-2027,” say Domingo and Santos Marti.</p>\n</div>"
