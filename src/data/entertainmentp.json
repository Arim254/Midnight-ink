    "body": "<div><p>\n\tIf history had gone differently, “Titanic” would’ve starred Lenny Williams.</p>\n<p>\n\tIn a recent appearance on the “<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AOHXxaah38o\" target=\"_blank\">New Heights</a>” podcast, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/leonardo-dicaprio/\">Leonardo DiCaprio</a> said an agent told him in his early teens that his name was “too ethnic,” and suggested he go by the stage name Lenny Williams instead.</p>\n<p>\n\t“I finally got an agent. They said, ‘Your name is too ethnic,’” DiCaprio recalled. “I go, ‘What do you mean? It’s Leonardo DiCaprio?’ They go, ‘No, too ethnic. They’re never going to hire you. Your new name is Lenny Williams.’”\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\tHe continued, “I said, ‘What is Lenny?’ I was 12,13. I said, ‘What is Lenny Williams?’ ‘We took your middle name and we made it. Now you’re Lenny.’”\n</p>\n<p>\n\tThe “Wolf of Wall Street” star added that when he showed his father his headshot printed with the new name, he “ripped it up, and he said, ‘Over my dead body.’”</p>\n<p>\n\t<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/benicio-del-toro/\">Benicio Del Toro</a>, who appeared in the interview alongside DiCaprio, also had an agent push him to change his name. He shared, “I was told the same thing. ‘You’re Benny Del.’”</p>\n<p>\n\tDiCaprio and Del Toro co-star in <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/paul-thomas-anderson/\">Paul Thomas Anderson</a>‘s upcoming thriller “<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/one-battle-after-another/\">One Battle After Another</a>,” which hits theaters Sept. 26. The film stars DiCaprio as Bob, a burnt-out revolutionary who must team up with his former conspirators to rescue his daughter from an old foe.</p>\n<p>\n\t<em>Variety</em> film critic Owen Gleiberman was keen on the film. He <a href=\"https://variety.com/2025/film/reviews/one-battle-after-another-review-leonardo-dicaprio-sean-penn-1236520520/\" target=\"_blank\">wrote in his review</a>, “‘One Battle After Another’ is a movie that taps into the fierce urgency of now; it gives you a chill that’s also a wake-up call. Yet when you hear the movie described, it can sound rather aggressive in its dystopian topicality, like a bombs-away, knowingly over-the-top thriller-satire of where we are today and where we might be headed.”</p>\n</div>"

The Marvel adaptation was previously scheduled for June 25. On its new spot, “Spider-Verse” will open around two holidays, Father’s Day and Juneteenth. It’ll land one week after Universal’s live-action “How to Train Your Dragon 2” and on the same day as Disney’s animated adventure “Gatto.”\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\t“Beyond the Spider-Verse” concludes a trilogy that began with 2018’s “Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse” and continued with 2023’s “Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse.” The series centers on Brooklyn high schooler Miles Morales, who becomes the new Spider-Man and joins other Spider-People from parallel universes to save New York City — and other multiversal locales — from various threats. Plot details for the third film haven’t been revealed but the story presumably involves Miles Morales facing another crisis.\n</p>\n<p>\n\t“We have crafted what we feel is a very satisfying ending, and we can’t wait for fans to experience it,” filmmakers Bob Persichetti and Justin K.

    "body": "<div><p>\n\t<strong>SPOILER ALERT:</strong> <em>This article contains spoilers for “<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/marvel/\">Marvel</a> Zombies,” now streaming on Disney+.</em></p>\n<p>\n\tThe MCU is embracing blood and gore once again — this time in the animated universe.</p>\n<p>\n\t“<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/marvel-zombies/\">Marvel Zombies</a>,” an undead spinoff from “What If…?,” is Marvel’s first M-rated animated series, following live-action, R-rated hits like “Deadpool & Wolverine” (in theaters) and “Daredevil: Born Again” (on Disney+). Bryan Andrews directed the Season 1 episode of “What If…?” that introduced a horrifying Quantum Realm virus that turns nearly everyone in the world into shambling zombies, including many beloved superheroes. With “Marvel Zombies,” which continues the story, Andrews ratchets up the viscera and dismemberment as the rating goes from TV-14 to TV-MA.\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\tSeveral heroes and villains return from the “What If…?” episode, like Spider-Man (voiced by Hudson Thames), the disembodied head of Ant-Man (Paul Rudd) and zombie versions of Scarlet Witch (Elizabeth Olsen), Thanos and more. Recent MCU additions, like Ms. Marvel (Iman Vellani), Red Guardian (David Harbour), Yelena Belova (Florence Pugh) and Shang-Chi (Simu Liu), also get some major screen time. One character even gets his MCU introduction before his live-action debut: the day-walking vampire Blade. He comes with a slight caveat, though; the “Marvel Zombies” hero is actually an amalgamation of Blade and Moon Knight, with no relation to Mahershala Ali’s version of the character that’s still waiting to make his big-screen debut. (The character is voiced instead by Todd Williams.) For eagle-eyed viewers, Blade Knight made a brief appearance in the “What If…?” series finale last year.\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\tWith <em>Variety</em>, Andrews discusses creating Blade Knight, why the Fantastic Four and X-Men are absent from the show, why “Marvel Zombies” was almost a movie, and what his plans are for a possible Season 2.</p>\n\t<h5>\n\t\tWhen did you first get the idea to do a spinoff of the “What If…?” Season 1 zombie episode?\t</h5>\n<p>\n\tIt was early on, once it was decided that we’re gonna be doing “What If…?” Kevin Feige was a fan of the comics and the zombie genre in general. Way early on, Kevin had said something to [Marvel animation executive] Brad Winderbaum, who then said to us, “We’re totally doing a zombie thing!” It was almost one of the reasons to even do “What If…?” — so that we could do an episode that was zombies. We found a place in time, right around [the events of] “Infinity War,” because it provided a number of heroes that were out and about. Kevin loved it, so it was like we should be doing a bigger thing and explore this world a little bit more.</p>\n\t<h5>\n\t\tDid you know this would be Marvel’s first M-rated, animated show? How did you convince them to let you murder all those superheroes?\t</h5>\n<p>\n\tWe made the blood darker zombie goo so we could get away with that type of stuff to make [the “What It…?” episode] TV-14. When the decision was to do it straight-up and make it a bigger story, well, it’s gotta be TV-MA. Brad, Kevin and the rest were like, “Oh, hells yeah.” They were thinking the same thing. You don’t want to have to keep pulling punches. You want to be able to go for it, really create something within that genre and do it justice. Everyone was down for that, thankfully.</p>\n<p>\n\tWe self-police ourselves pretty well. I’m down for the insanity, but I also don’t want it to be gratuitous in a tasteless sense. There’s a right way and a wrong way. It’s not like you look at all the guts and linger on the shot for 12 minutes. There’s no reason for that. If we were going to get a chance to do another one, which would be awesome, there are certain things I would push further at times. For this one, we wanted to make sure the story was there and all the action and violence you can enjoy, but it doesn’t become only about that.</p>\n\t<h5>\n\t\tHow did you choose Kamala Khan, aka Ms. Marvel, to follow as the primary character?\t</h5>\n<p>\n\tIt came from trying to do something a little different than “What If…?,” where there are a lot of these powerful, big characters that we know. We wanted to be able to start with some young blood and new peeps who, because of that timeframe in MCU history that we chose, have not elevated themselves yet. They don’t know how to do this and they’re learning as they go during a zombie apocalypse. It gives them something to learn. We get to point out their naïveté and their hopeful, youthful, wide-eyed, bushy-tailed-ness. Can they stand against the onslaught of horribleness? Can they come out unscathed, or what would the scars be? They seemed primely placed to do that and then allow other individuals to come in and have our ensemble grow and change.\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\tWe wanted it to be pretty epic, and there was so much story we couldn’t put it all in. So there’s stuff going on with other characters that aren’t even in this that we know what’s going on with them, and we would love to tell those stories. It started feeling like “Lord of the Rings” in that we wanted it to be this history that was bigger than the audience was aware of, with events happening off camera. As a result, we started thinking of Kamala like Frodo, where this fellowship can gather around her on this crazy journey since she was ill-prepared at the time. To do the zombie movie, we started thinking about it like a fantasy or like a Dungeons and Dragons campaign.</p>\n\t<h5>\n\t\tThis is the first time since “The Marvels” that we’re seeing Ms. Marvel, and she’s with Riri Williams, aka Ironheart, and Kate Bishop’s Hawkeye as the Young Avengers. We also see the Thunderbolts after they debuted earlier this year. Were there any restrictions on how you could use these characters?\t</h5>\n<p>\n\tIt was pretty open. It was early on when we started developing this. Some of those shows hadn’t even come out yet. “Ironheart” was a ways away when we started, but we knew it was coming and they seemed like exciting, fun, young characters to play with. Because this is its own little pocket side universe, and it’s early in their superhero careers, there wasn’t that much worry. All we needed to know was who they were early on, even before those shows started, so there’s that thread of cohesiveness. We never got them in the booth to record together, but when they got the material, they’re like, “Wait, so we’re all, like, a thing?” They, separately on their own, were super-excited that their animated avatar was hanging out with the other gals. It was so fun to watch them nerd out about that.</p>\n\t<h5>\n\t\tWhy didn’t you use any characters from the Fantastic Four or X-Men?\t</h5>\n<p>\n\tI would have loved to have them in, but at the time, “Fantastic Four” was so far off. They’re also in a different multiverse. Same with the X-Men. How would they get here? So there are all those questions and rigmarole. But, I mean, never say never. That’s why I’m hoping, if there’s a second season around, there are already a few ideas of, like, can we get extra crazy? So who knows, but it would be amazing, and it gives us just more opportunities for more zombies and crazy heroes to go down swinging.\n\t</p>\n\t<h5>\n\t\tBlade makes his official MCU debut as Blade Knight, but he was teased in the “What If…?” Season 3 finale very briefly. Did you know back then that you wanted to introduced him?\t</h5>\n<p>\n\tWe did Season 3 of “What If…?” and “Zombies” basically concurrently. Because “Agatha” came out on a particular Halloween, “Zombies” was actually ready to come out then. But they were like, “Oh shit, we don’t want to have one eat the other attention-level-wise, and it’s a big deal to do ‘Agatha’ so let’s hold ‘Zombies.'” Everyone’s seeing it now, but it’s actually been waiting in the wings to come out. When it came time to do all those images at the end of Season 3, we were like “fuck yeah!” It’s a little bit of a tease that something was coming.</p>\n<p>\n\tPretty early, it wasn’t going to be Blade. We already knew immediately it was going to be Blade Knight. We also didn’t know that we were going to come out before a Blade movie. When we’re doing the animated stuff and they’ve got a live-action property at the same time, it’s really difficult because you have to be beholden to what they’re doing with that character in live-action. Sometimes they’re figuring it out, and we’re like, “We gotta go with this thing. We need the decision now.” It’s really hard, so we didn’t want to deal with Blade because there was this script, that script, whatever. Like, what are they even doing? We don’t even know. If we did Blade Knight, that completely separates it from whatever they’re doing in the movie and makes it our own and it’s rad. Blade, the Fist of Khonshu, was early on and so natural. It was perfect to have him pair up with our young protagonist that has no idea what the heck they’re doing. It really created this great way for to work him in.</p>\n\t<h5>\n\t\tHave you gotten any feedback on Blade Knight and if his character may influence the live-action Blade?\t</h5>\n<p>\n\tI have no idea when they’re planning Marvel-wise. I know Kevin digs this and Blade Knight. I like the response that the fans are giving off the trailer, even that one little fight people are nerding out over. I love it when they say, “Hey, if the live-action isn’t as good as this, then what’s the point?” That makes me really happy. People are responding exactly how I wanted them to respond. It would be great if that could influence the movie in some way, because I feel the same way. If the live-action movie doesn’t feel as badass that one little moment, then what’s the hell is the point?\n\t</p>\n\t<h5>\n\t\tIf you have all these ideas for more stories, why’d you only get four episodes to work with?\t</h5>\n<p>\n\tTime and money, man. It’s “Hey, this is all you got.” We’re like, “Oh shit! All right.” We were creating a thing and didn’t know what the limit was going to be. Then they’re like, “Oh no, no, guys.” Then we thought, “Well, let’s make it a movie.” We were going to make it a movie and have it released. It should be an epic, it’s gonna be two, two and a half hours long. It’s gonna be amazing. But, there were contractual issues because of Spider-Man in it. So, there are Sony rules that come into play. We were like, “Oh shit, that’s a thing? Oh no, okay, I guess we can’t do that.” So we broke it up. Now, it plays like four chapters in a book. Even with the four chapters, it would have been awesome if we had more time to make each installment a little bit longer, just so we could milk those quiet moments a bit longer. We tried to put it in as much as possible, and it moves at a breakneck pace. We put in those moments of stillness and reflection as best we could. Maybe next time around, if everyone loves it enough and yells online enough to demand more, maybe they’ll give us more time and more money.</p>\n\t<h5>\n\t\tIt sounds like there’s enough material for a second season.\t</h5>\n<p>\n\tSo much material. It’s crazy. There are other characters that people are like, “So-and-so is not even in it.” Yeah, we know. We know what’s going on. We know how people got from A to B. You guys have no idea the insanity that’s just waiting around the corner if we get a chance. Brad and I already know how the next one would start already. Our original idea was more medieval fantasy. It was set so far after the different kingdoms, fiefdoms and ruling factions have grown. Some of our old guard would be old. We were doing crazy shit. Brad wisely said people want to see their favorites and not see them so crazy. We rolled it back and didn’t time-jump so far forward.</p>\n\t<h5>\n\t\tThat sounds like the “What If…?” episode set in 1602. Are there any other episodes from that series that you’d want to expand?\t</h5>\n<p>\n\tWe love the Shang-Chi Western in Season 3. My original idea for that was far crazier and bigger and incorporated Captain America and Falcon and Nick Fury. That world could be ripe, where you take all the Marvel stuff and put it through a Western lens. It could be one. There are a number of “What If…?” episodes that were A+ ideas that Kevin loved, but there are just too many great episodes to put in a season, so some of those get left to the side for other future seasons. There was one that was going to be D&D. It’s basically Marvel superhero D&D. It was going to follow a group of C-level characters, maybe some of them not even superheroes, as if they’re first-level characters, and they’re trying to go on this big adventure that’s a 20th-level module. You see your A-level heroes going off to do the thing, but these idiots want to do it anyway and they Forrest Gump their way into the ending before the other heroes get the ending. So they get all the cool, powerful weapons and level up and then save the other team who’s fighting the big boss and losing. It could have been so great and nerd out over all that RPG lore and mix in all the Marvel stuff with it.\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\t<em>This interview has been edited and condensed.</em></p>\n</div>"

    "body": "<div><p>\n\t“<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/jimmy-kimmel/\">Jimmy Kimmel</a> Live” returned to the air with a whopping 6.3 million viewers on Tuesday — its most-watched regularly scheduled episode ever. </p>\n<p>\n\tThe series has only seen a larger audience than that twice in its history, during special Sunday episodes that aired directly after the 2006 Super Bowl and the 2014 Oscars. Tuesday’s broadcast also represents a 343% increase from the previous season’s average of 1.4 million viewers. \n</p>\n<p>\n\tTuesday’s total, which comes from preliminary Live + Same Day data from Nielsen, would have been even higher if the episode had been available nationwide. However, because Nexstar and Sinclair have continued to preempt “<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/jimmy-kimmel-live/\">Jimmy Kimmel Live</a>” on their stations after Disney lifted the show’s suspension, it did not air in 23% of U.S. households.\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\tAmong adults aged 18-49, “Jimmy Kimmel Live” hit a 0.87 rating, marking a 568% increase from the previous season’s average rating of 0.13 as well as the best demo rating for a regularly scheduled episode since 2015.</p>\n<p>\n\tDuring Tuesday’s broadcast, Kimmel joked about the strong viewership his return episode was likely to achieve. Throughout the six days that “Jimmy Kimmel Live” was off the air, Donald Trump, Fox News anchors and other critics of Kimmel claimed that the show gets “no ratings.” “Well, I do tonight!” Kimmel said in his monologue. “You almost have to feel sorry for [Trump]. He tried his best to cancel me. Instead, he forced millions of people to watch the show. That backfired bigly. He might have to release the Epstein files to distract us from this now.”</p>\n<p>\n\tKimmel spent most of the monologue emphasizing the importance of free speech and thanking those who pointed to the First Amendment throughout his suspension. After shouting out his fellow late night hosts, who share his liberal politics, he said, “Maybe most of all, I want to thank the people who don’t support my show and what I believe, but support my right to share those beliefs anyway. People I never would have imagined, like Ben Shapiro, Clay Travis, Candace Owens, Mitch McConnell, Rand Paul. Even my old pal Ted Cruz, who, believe it or not, said something very beautiful on my behalf.”\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\t“Even though I don’t agree with many of those people on most subjects, some of the things they say even make me want to throw up, it takes courage for them to speak out against this administration, and they did, and they deserve credit for it,” he continued.</p>\n</div>"

    "body": "<div><p>\n\t“<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/sisu-road-to-revenge/\">Sisu: Road to Revenge</a>” is the second chapter in the saga of Aatami Korpi (Jorma Tommila), the Finnish badass who brutally killed a TON of Nazis who tried to steal his gold in 2022’s “Sisu.” In the sequel, Aatami, a man of few words, dismantles his family home after the Red Army moves the borders of his country. His plan? Drive the materials to a new homeland and rebuild. But given all the blood on his hands from the first movie, a Soviet Red Army leader (Richard Brake) hires the violent officer who killed Aatami’s family (Stephen Lang) to eliminate the patriarch next. <em>Variety</em> spoke with Jalmari Helander, the films’ Finnish writer and director, after its <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/fantastic-fest/\">Fantastic Fest</a> world premiere to break down why he wrote a sequel, the hazards of having blood-filled setpieces and potential sequel plans.\n\t</p>\n\t<h5>\n\t\tWhat inspired you to make a sequel?\t</h5>\n<p>\n\tSony wanted me to do a sequel, and I had an idea for it, but then I decided that it wasn’t good enough. Then my producer, Petri [Jokiranta], made me think harder because he said, “But we kind of promised that he can do it.” So one day I got the idea of him going to get his home back, which I thought was a really good idea. It was good enough that I will have the balls to actually try to do a better film than “Sisu,” because, of course, I needed to do that, or think at least that I will do that.\n</p>\n\t<h5>\n\t\tHow do you come up with the ideas of these set pieces, with planes and trucks and tanks all used as vehicles of destruction?\t</h5>\n<p>\n\tI’m doing something other than trying to have ideas like that. I always remember the best ones. I remember where I was when I had the weird idea of Aatami sucking oxygen out of Nazi lungs. It’s funny when it happens, when it suddenly comes.\n\t</p>\n\t<h5>\n\t\tHow did Stephen Lang end up as the villain?\t</h5>\n<p>\n\tIt was Sony’s idea to ask him, because I was thinking someone younger. But when I heard that idea, it felt so obvious that “Yes, it <em>has</em> to be Stephen Lang.” And there’s some kind of similarity in Steven and in Jorma, how they are, and it worked beautifully.</p>\n\t<h5>\n\t\tRichard Brake also joins the film. What was it collaborating with him?\t</h5>\n<p>\n\tIt was really cool. He was really into it, and he really liked the first “Sisu.” He was really happy to come for the second one. They were really nice guys, and I don’t even have to lie when I say that. Everyone is always saying, “Yeah, we had the best crew and the actors were wonderful.” Usually they are not, probably, but this time they were really nice.</p>\n\t<h5>\n\t\tWhen it comes to taking a ton of damage without dying, how do you kind of find that line between man and superhero for Aatami?\t</h5>\n<p>\n\tI’m not sure. I think I’m crossing the line constantly, but that’s what I try to do. I’m trying to find where the limit is. And sometimes I cross it and take a step back, but it doesn’t happen very often nowadays. It’s like hiding the knife in your leg. <em>[Editor’s note: In one scene, Aatami opens up a wound on his leg, in which he had hidden a long knife under his skin.]</em> My original idea is was that he was hiding more things. He actually had a pistol in his stomach.</p>\n\t<h5>\n\t\tWhat are some of the movies that inspired you for this film?\t</h5>\n<p>\n\tIndiana Jones for sure, and some old Bond films also. It has a similar kind of fun action in it. Those probably are the biggest influences.</p>\n\t<h5>\n\t\tWhy do you think that it’s so satisfying for people to watch Nazis and members of the Soviet Red Army get blown up?\t</h5>\n<p>\n\tI think that people love to see when bad guys get their ass kicked in a proper way. We live in a world where it seems like that’s not happening, and movies are a good place to do things that make people happy.</p>\n\t<h5>\n\t\tThere’s so much blood in this movie. Was it hard to keep continuity when doing second takes?\t</h5>\n<p>\n\tIf we’re doing something like the shootout in the train, it’s a one-take wonder because there are so many squibs going on and it’s really expensive and time-consuming. Having all that set up takes more than one day. I’m just hoping for the best when it goes off, because you don’t reset it like that.</p>\n\t<h5>\n\t\tHow are you able to be so economical with your storytelling and still get across Aatami’s pain and anguish?\t</h5>\n<p>\n\tI know that I need to do my work really well with the emotional stuff in the beginning to set the story up so that you really feel for Aatami and you are interested in his actions, and you want him to get that house, and you hope for best things for him. If I can manage to do that in the beginning, then I have permission to blow everything up and have some fun with it.\n\t</p>\n\t<h5>\n\t\tThis movie ends with a rare moment of relief for Aatami. Was that always the goal?\t</h5>\n<p>\n\tYeah, it was one of the things I invented very early on, how I want this to end. There’s something really cool with the last scene of the film.</p>\n\t<h5>\n\t\tDo you have ideas for what a third adventure could look like, potentially?\t</h5>\n<p>\n\tI have ideas, but I’m not sure if that’s going to happen ever, but you never know.</p>\n\t<h5>\n\t\tHave you thought about Aatami’s life as a younger man? Maybe a prequel?\t</h5>\n<p>\n\tI’ve thought it through, how was his life before, especially when I was making the second one: His family and the war and what the war did to him and all that.</p>\n<p>\n\tWatch the “Sisu: Road to Revenge” trailer below.</p>\n<figure><p>\n<iframe width=\"500\" height=\"281\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/VmStqCXIgio?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\"></iframe>\n</p></figure>\n</div>"

    "body": "<div><p>\n\tIs “<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/eureka-day/\">Eureka Day</a>,” a Tony-winning comedy now on the boards at the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/pasadena-playhouse/\">Pasadena Playhouse</a>, as uproariously funny as it is because the script feels veritably ripped from today’s headlines? Or does it get its chuckles in spite of that pressing topicality? After all, not very many people are laughing right now about the battles over child vaccinations, which is the subject of the seriocomic arguments that erupt among a group of parents in Jonathan Spector’s script. But the fact that the play is now being presented as a period piece, set in the late 2010s, when it was first produced, puts us at just enough of a remove from the present madness to let down our guards and guffaw. If the climate hasn’t yet immunized you against that sort of thing.\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\tThe primary setting is a classroom at a progressive private school in Berkeley, unfolding almost entirely in a series of board meetings where disagreements over how to handle a mumps outbreak expose deep and eventually quite angry rifts among the parents, on and off the board. The first thing to know is that, as opposed to how we might be receiving news stories about vaccine wars at the moment, this is not a right-versus-left thing. All of the parents at the Eureka Day school are liberals in good standing, just as a baseline, and the play serves as a reminder that virulent anti-vaxxers have been found on the left, too, even if we’re not hearing much from those voices right now. We sure hear a lot from them in “Eureka Day,” though, and the comedy comes from how quickly a left-leaning, peace-loving community can turn into a circular firing squad, given the right trigger.\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\tStrong performances are equally spread out among the five actors on stage. (Technically, there are six, but revealing the nature of the extra cameo would involve a minor spoiler.) The man ostensibly in charge of the board is a somewhat passive-aggressive fellow named Don, played by Rick Harmon, who looks and sounds a little like “Office Space’s” Bill Lumbergh, if he had something closer to a good heart. Don wants to make sure everyone is treated equally, to almost painful extremes, but is inevitably the guy most likely to step on other opinions. Anyone who’s ever been in a business meeting amid a controversy may recognize him as the type of leader who responds to something that could be an existential threat by pulling out a marking pen and inviting suggestions for a list of “action steps.” He’s villainous only to the extent that his platitudes are a time-suck.</p>\n<p>\n\tThe three women characters are all of a more cut-the-bullshit mindset, or at least they all eventually end up there, allthough it’s at different points in the proceedings that they each arrive to peak impatience, and for quite different reasons. The clearest firebrand of the group is Suzanne (Mia Barron), whose patronizing politeness will eventually give way to rage once her views are challenged. Carina (Cherise Boothe), a Black lesbian newcomer to the school and to the board — and the audience’s surrogate for getting caught up on how things work there — is the most grounded character, with a willingness to step back and let more experienced players lead that will be challenged when things begin to spiral. It may not be an accident that Meiko (Camille Chen) has “meek” built right into her name, which portends that her eventual eruption under pressure may be the most explosive of all. What we know best about her in the early going is that she is having an affair with the second male character, Eli (Nate Corddry), although it may not count as illicit as this ultra-pleasant tech guru is allowed to experiment, in his open marriage to an unseen partner… maybe.</p>\n<p>\n\tIn the first scene, any bickering among this mostly harmonious enough group occurs over such inconsequential agenda items as whether to add identities as specific “transracial adoptee” to a list of self-descriptors in the school’s pulldown list. That’s an example of how blatant the spoofery can be in “Eureka Day” — self-spoofery, anyway, since in its broadest strokes, the show <em>is</em> a satire of liberalism, but an inherently affectionate one. Conservatives might come to the show and get a kick out of the ribbing that’s doled out to the most touchy-feely wing of progressivism, although at some point they’d know this has been written as more of an intra-family fight than owning the libs.\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\tThe idea that the infighting is all in the family gets put to the test when the aforementioned mumps outbreak occurs, and the school has to be shut down, with the debate happening over whether a vaccine mandate will be put in place before classrooms reopen. This leads to a mid-play “town hall” scene in which the board sets up an online forum for all of the school’s parents to weigh in with their opinions, which turns out to be a horrible idea unforeseeable only to anyone who’s never seen open warfare erupt in an internet forum before.</p>\n<p>\n\tTherein is a scene that unfolds as something really unique in comic theater. At least I can say that I don’t ever remember laughter coming across as loud in the confines of an 800-seat space as what transpires with a full house at the Pasadena Playhouse during this sequence. The funny part, if you will, is that not that much of it is due to what the cast members are doing on stage. No slight to them, at all, but they are basically playing straight men and women to the overhead screen, where we see a scroll of of the increasingly hostile messages that the parents attending the virtual meeting are sending the board and each other. At some points the laughter becomes so loud that you can’t even heard what the cast is saying on stage, and you hope that it’s inconsequential enough that you don’t need to, because the yuks are coming from the off-stage parents who, one at a time, are going completely nuclear in the chat. Finally, the board will have the good sense to just snap their host laptop shut, but not before a wickedly riotous 10 minutes or so in which absolutely no one backs away from the keyboard.</p>\n<p>\n\t“Eureka Day” is never going to top that extended mid-play sequence for hilarity, and so thankfully it doesn’t try. But an inevitable dip in the final scenes into something poignant doesn’t let the comedy slip completely away. Characters do come on- and off-stage during these blackouts, and the one who is putting up the greatest resistance to a vaccine mandate gives a compelling monologue explaining why she ended up there — in which you can feel playwright Spector doing his own humanist duty in reminding the audience that even the adversaries of what we’d consider reason have <em>their</em> reasons, as often as not.\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\tBut the deck is stacked, so if you happen to be an anti-vaxxer, don’t come to “Eureka Day” imagining that the cards are going to be doled out equally. If anything, Spector stacks it a little more against the play’s driving anti-immunization force than he needs to, also seeming to make her a casual, if accidental, racist, one more strike against her than is really necessary. Just as it becomes all too clear what we’re going to wind up thinking of Suzanne, it’s not quite clear enough what we’re to make of Eli, the tech mogul who kind of serves a purpose as a deus ex machine at the end, or his romantic partner, Meiko. It’s nothing short of a pleasure to see Chen’s low simmer finally boil over, but then once she’s gotten mad, really mad, she retreats to the margins for the final scenes, making you wish she merited a real climax, or at least proper anticlimax, of her own.</p>\n<p>\n\tThose quibbles aside, it’s hard to overstate what a good time you will have settling in with this splendid cast, under the beautifully paced direction of Teddy Bergman. Spector’s dialogue is so sharp that you may find yourself making an immediate note to go see anything and everything of his that will ever pop up on the theater calendar. He’s written the kind of play where, when the last scene in (the intermission-less) action turns out to be much shorter than those that have preceded it, you may let out a sigh of disappointment, that the whole affair isn’t going to go on just a little bit longer. (You will certainly be left wondering how the original version of the play that ran in the late 2010s ended; this version has a perfect punchline that could not been written pre-pandemic, and that’s all we’ll give away about that.)</p>\n<p>\n\tMost of all, if you’re at least halfway toward the progressive end of the spectrum, “Eureka Day” is notable for just how much it at least regards its characters as apparently decent souls, whatever digs it gets in at their fallacies, self-delusions and eagerness to toe certain lines at any cost. Spending time with a set of sharp-talkers who bicker and break down but ultimately <em>mean well</em>, on some level, counts as some kind of balm in an environment where we may be coming to believe of our fellow citizens and leaders that maybe a lot of them just don’t. With the combination of wicked banter and ultimate good will that “Eureka Day” has to offer, you’d be well-advised to take the jab.\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\t<em>“Eureka Day” runs at the Pasadena Playhouse through Oct. 5.
