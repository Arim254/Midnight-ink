    "body": "<div><p>\n\t<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/jimmy-kimmel/\">Jimmy Kimmel</a> is coming back nationwide on <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/abc/\">ABC</a> stations across the U.S.</p>\n<p>\n\tTV station group <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/nexstar/\">Nexstar</a> said it will resume airing “Jimmy Kimmel Live!” on its 32 ABC affiliates starting Friday night after it had preempted the show over the late-night host’s comments about Charlie Kirk’s killer. Earlier Friday, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/2025/tv/news/sinclair-resumes-jimmy-kimmel-live-abc-stations-1236530166/\">Sinclair said it was bringing Kimmel back to its 38 ABC stations</a>, also reversing its previous position.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tThe decisions by the two station groups end a short-lived protest by the companies that started last week following Kimmel’s remarks on Monday, Sept. 15. ABC suspended the show Sept. 17 before bringing it back this past Tuesday, where it saw record ratings despite the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/sinclair/\">Sinclair</a>-Nexstar blackout.\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\tThe return of “Jimmy Kimmel Live!” in all U.S. markets is a victory for Disney and ABC, which had been slammed as having <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/2025/tv/news/disney-shareholders-jimmy-kimmel-suspension-records-legal-threat-1236528997/\">caved in to pressure</a> from the Trump administration in sidelining Kimmel. Disney was targeted with protests and consumer threats to boycott its services (i.e., by canceling Disney+) as well as criticism from Hollywood guilds and others for the perception it wasn’t standing up for First Amendment rights.</p>\n<p>\n\t“We have had discussions with executives at The Walt Disney Company and appreciate their constructive approach to addressing our concerns,” Nexstar said in a statement. “As a local broadcaster, Nexstar remains committed to protecting the First Amendment while producing and airing local and national news that is fact-based and unbiased and, above all, broadcasting content that is in the best interest of the communities we serve. We stand apart from cable television, monolithic streaming services, and national networks in our commitment — and obligation — to be stewards of the public airwaves and to protect and reflect the specific sensibilities of our communities.”\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\tNexstar added: “To be clear, our commitment to those principles has guided our decisions throughout this process, independent of any external influence from government agencies or individuals.”</p>\n<p>\n\tThe Kimmel controversy kicked into high gear after <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/2025/tv/news/brendan-carr-abc-fcc-jimmy-kimmel-charlie-kirk-1236522406/\">FCC chairman Brendan Carr threatened to pursue “news distortion” complaints against ABC stations</a> unless Kimmel was fired. “We can do this the easy way or the hard way,” Carr said Sept. 17 on a conservative podcast. TV broadcasters, he said, “can find ways to change conduct and take action, frankly, on Kimmel or there’s going to be additional work for the FCC ahead.”</p>\n<p>\n\tNexstar’s decision to black out Kimmel was widely seen as an attempt to get in Carr’s good graces, as it has some immediate business before the agency. In August, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/2025/tv/news/nexstar-acquires-tegna-1236492664/\">Nexstar announced an agreement to acquire Tegna for $6.2 billion</a>, a deal that requires FCC approval; <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/2025/tv/news/nexstar-jimmy-kimmel-suspension-fcc-pressure-1236523812/\">the company denied Carr’s threats influenced its decision</a> to yank Kimmel on the air. Sinclair, too, claimed “Our decision to preempt [‘Jimmy Kimmel Live!’] was independent of any government interaction or influence.”</p>\n<p>\n\tIn announcing it was bringing Kimmel back earlier this week, Disney said the decision to suspend the show was “to avoid further inflaming a tense situation at an emotional moment for our country. It is a decision we made because we felt some of the comments were ill-timed and thus insensitive.” The statement continued, “We have spent the last days having thoughtful conversations with Jimmy, and after those conversations, we reached the decision to return the show on Tuesday,” Sept. 23.</p>\n<p>\n\tIrving, Texas-based Nexstar has 32 ABC-affiliated stations (23 are owned by the company and nine are partner stations it provide services to under joint operating agreements).</p>\n<p>\n\tThose include KTVX (Salt Lake City), WGNO (New Orleans), WTEN (Albany, N.Y.), WSYR (Syracuse, N.Y.), WKRN (Nashville, Tenn.), WATE (Knoxville, Tenn.), WOTV (Battle Creek, Mich.), WHTM (Harrisburg, Pa.), WRIC (Richmond, Va.), WJGF (Augusta, Ga.), KTKA (Topeka, Kan.) and WTNH (Hartford-New Haven, Conn.).</p>\n<p>\n\tIn a Sept. 17 statement, Andrew Alford, president of Nexstar’s broadcasting division, had said: “Mr. Kimmel’s comments about the death of Mr. Kirk are offensive and insensitive at a critical time in our national political discourse, and we do not believe they reflect the spectrum of opinions, views, or values of the local communities in which we are located. Continuing to give Mr. Kimmel a broadcast platform in the communities we serve is simply not in the public interest at the current time, and we have made the difficult decision to preempt his show in an effort to let cooler heads prevail as we move toward the resumption of respectful, constructive dialogue.”</p>\n</div>"

    "body": "<div><p>\n\tFan interactions are inevitable for a star like Leonardo DiCaprio, the former heartthrob turned permanent Hollywood A-lister, but some are more puzzling than others.</p>\n<p>\n\tThough the Oscar winner is approaching his fourth decade in Hollywood, <em>Variety</em> recently asked him and “<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/one-battle-after-another/\">One Battle After Another</a>” costar Benicio del Toro about which of their films connect with younger audiences — particularly those with a YouTube-and-Tik-Tok-drenched media diet, who might not remember the halcyon days of waiting in line at the cineplex for “Titanic” tickets. \n\t</p>\n<p>\n\tOne particular film, DiCaprio said, seems to resonate with pre-teen kids. It doesn’t make him the most comfortable. \n</p>\n<p>\n\t“We’ve probably both done a lot of R-rated stuff, so it depends on what age you’re talking about,” DiCaprio said of he and del Toro. “Some little kids come up to me and go, ‘I loved <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/wolf-of-wall-street/\">Wolf of Wall Street</a>.’ Like, you saw that? How old are you?” </p>\n<p>\n\tReleased in 2013 and directed by frequent DiCaprio collaborator Martin Scorsese, “Wolf of Wall Street” easily ranks among the most hedonistic films the actor has ever made. Inspired by the true story of disgraced stockbroker Jordan Belfort, “Wolf” is set a cocaine-dusted ’80s where corruption and fraud were best practices in the financial sector. </p>\n<p>\n\tQuaalude-induced paralysis, sunken yachts, orgies, child and property endangerment, Jonah Hill’s prosthetic penis, police shootouts and more abound in the film. It introduced the world to Margot Robbie, earned over $400 million at the worldwide box office and landed five Academy Award nominations.\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\tWhile DiCaprio doesn’t seem to have a shorthand for how to talk to young fans about federal indictments and drug abuse, he concedes: “I saw a lot of R-rated movies when I was young.”</p>\n<p>\n\tNext, the youth of America will digest “One Battle After Another,” Paul Thomas Anderson’s revolutionary epic, which hits theaters Friday.</p>\n</div>"

Viki offers a range of free and subscription streaming options and is widely distributed across Samsung, LG and other connected TV platforms.\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\tViki’s push for the “K-Drama Day” campaign targeting U.S. viewers is a nod to the growing appeal of Korean-language serial drama series.

Gerson, CEO and Chairman of Universal Music Publishing Group, sits on the board of directors for Project Healthy Minds, and appeared at the Summit to discuss the growing focus on mental health in the music space.\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\t“There’s a whole level of artists now who don’t go the distance, don’t need to be superstars, because they have to take care of their mental health first,” said Gerson. “And there are bunch of artists who recognize what their limitations are, and they’re going, you know what? That’s too much for me. I can’t do that. It’s not good for my mental health. And I think that’s the change that I’ve seen. They’re outspoken about how they feel. I think that’s gonna change the way people see mental health and how they’re treated.”\n</p>\n<p>\n\tSchermer, who launched Project Healthy Minds in 2020, noted that there are 65 million Americans with a mental health condition, and that 60 percent of them never get any form of care due to either stigma or lack of access.</p>\n<p>\n\t“Our whole vision is there should be a front door on the Internet for finding mental health care, where all the services are vetted by clinicians,” he said. Project Healthy Minds offers a mental health marketplace that allows users to access the care that they need. The organization has partnered with musicians including Demi Lovato and the Kid Laroi to help get the message out about their services.\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\t“The idea is to be able to show people and fans that artists and entertainment companies are partnering with Project Healthy Minds to help connect people to care,” he said. “And the amazing thing is we can see all the data. Every time we do one of these partnerships, thousands of people start seeking care immediately and we see, well, what kind of care are they searching for and what do they need? And to us, it’s an amazing way to see the impact.”</p>\n<p>\n\tProject Healthy Minds will next stage its World Mental Health Day Gala on Oct. 9 in New York. Prince Harry and Meghan, Duke and Duchess of Sussex, will be honored with the Humanitarians of the Year award.</p>\n</div>"

    "body": "<div><p>\n\tEvery class has its resident troublemaker, and in Swedish filmmaker <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/jonatan-etzler/\">Jonatan Etzler</a>’s (“One More Time”) first English-language feature “Bad Apples,” that troublemaker is named Danny. As feral as they come, his rage knows no bounds, and after a brutal assault on the star pupil, his stretched-thin teacher Maria will go to unimaginable lengths to ensure he’s absent for the upcoming school audit.</p>\n<p>\n\tOff the heels of its premiere at <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/tiff/\">TIFF</a> and ushering in the New Directors Competition at San Sebastian, the thrilling and acerbic high-octane comedy sets the audience up for a joyride through its twisted plot, where nothing remains as it seems.\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\t“We had a really good reception at TIFF, most people seemed to really like it. I felt like in San Sebastián, it was possibly even better. They responded very well to the cheekiness of it,” Etzler told <em>Variety</em>.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tPlayed by an increasingly-maniacal Saoirse Ronan (”Ladybird”), Maria seems the embodiment of meek and temperate. Going through the motions and showing up to her job like a lamb to the slaughter most days. Down-on-her-luck would be an understatement, she’s out to sea without a life vest until she finally snaps under the immense pressure, finding herself in the possession of one very angry outcast, who’ll reside in her basement until she figures out how to cope.</p>\n<p>\n\tThe story was adapted by Etzler and Jess O’Kane from Rasmus Lindgren’s debut novel De Oönskade.</p>\n<p>\n\tEach character is set up simply, but as the narrative builds, so do their idiosyncrasies. With Danny held hostage, Maria’s life begins to flourish and that star pupil, Pauline, inches ever-closer to her favorite docent as sympathies slip away and oscillate between characters, the film making quick work of manipulating mounting emotions.\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\tRonan takes up court with enigmatic newcomer Eddie Waller and burgeoning child star Nia Brown, as well as a cast of school-aged extras, playing off of the frenetic energy only youth can deliver. Etzler, amused and challenged directing the film, admits to instilling a sense of playfulness on set to coax the kids into their big emotions, crediting casting director Fiona Weer, who previously cast “Harry Potter” films, with finding the perfect pint-sized talent and shouting out his crew, who were able to remain on their toes, following the action where it led.</p>\n<p>\n\t“I think finding Danny was hard because we wanted someone who could sense that anger underneath the skin, that’s what we found with Eddie,” he relayed. “It’s a challenge when you’re working with children because it’s unpredictable. You hope that you’re going to get everything that you want, but you also have to be flexible and adaptable. Luckily, these children became professional quite quickly. Nia, who plays Pauline, after her second or third day — and she’d never acted on screen before — I told her to go ‘stand over there’ or something like that. She said, ‘Oh, I don’t think my character would do that.’ She immediately became this super professional actress. She was really brilliant.” </p>\n<p>\n\tThe aesthetic and score are notable. From the first scene, they play a role in establishing the menacing and foreboding mood of the film. From the cool, dank blue-gray tones of Maria’s basement to the clever signage that adorns the schoolroom walls, the production mechanics work to pull viewers further into this high stakes character study. For the affecting final edit, Etzler points to production designer Jacqueline Abrahams, known for her work on “The Lobster,” Swedish sound designer Andreas Franck, who’s collaborated on several Ruben Östlund films, and composer Chris Roe (“After Love”), who handled further scoring.</p>\n<p>\n\t“We worked with the idea of some steady rhythm all the time, like a machine that’s pumping that can’t stop. That works well with the story, with Maria setting this thing in motion that you really can’t stop. We wanted it to be very organic, so we used lots of orchestra, lots of flutes which have this strange, airy feeling to them that makes it very light, but in a slightly strange way,” he explained.\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\t“What’s also been great is that there’s quite a Swedish presence in this film. It’s based on a Swedish novel, we have a brilliant Swedish DP, Nea Asphäll, and then we have editor Robert Krantz, and the sound and post was done in Sweden. People from the U.K. think it’s very Scandi, and I think people from Sweden think it’s very British, which is interesting,” he added.</p>\n<p>\n\tProduced by Oskar Pimlott at the U.K.’s Pulse Films and picked up by Paramount’s indie shingle Republic Pictures, “Bad Apples” provides an existential commentary on the human condition and placing collective convenience over the wellbeing of our most vulnerable outsiders, using dark comedy as a vehicle to provoke a frenzy of sentiment. </p>\n<p>\n\tWhere other projects have found success discussing the same notions bleakly, Etzler trusts his sardonic approach will tempt audiences to let their guards down and allow the subject matter to resonate, perhaps looking inward at their own complicity in the process.</p>\n<p>\n\t“A lot of the luxuries that we have in daily life here in the Western world are based on someone else’s suffering. It’s very hard to get away from that. I read a short story that inspired me when we were working on this film, it was called “The Ones Who Walk Away From Omelas” by Ursula K. Le Guin. It’s about this village where everybody’s prosperous and happy and living this beautiful, lovely life, but it’s all because one child is suffering in a cellar. People, when they grow up, they find out about this. I think that’s the world we live in now,” Etzler mused.</p>\n<p>\n\tHe added: “It could easily become a very depressing film, I think laughter helps with that. Laughter’s also a reaction to discomfort, and how difficult these complex issues are. I’m very excited for the moment it reaches a worldwide audience through theaters, to see what discussions it sparks.”</p>\n</div>"

    "body": "<div><p>\n\t<em>Variety’s</em> Entertainment & Technology Summit gathered top executives, marketing leaders, technologists, entrepreneurs and creators across film, television and gaming on Thursday for a full day of keynote speakers, panel discussions and networking opportunities. </p>\n<p>\n\tIndustry insiders from Warner Bros. Discovery, Meta, Paramount+, Vizio, Netflix, Fox Entertainment and more shared their insights on current trends, tools and strategies that are revolutionizing the entertainment industry during the event held at the London West Hollywood hotel.\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\tThere were keynote conversations with Matt Duffer and Ross Duffer, who spoke for the first time about their four-year deal with Paramount as well as the future of “Stranger Things” as it enters its final season this fall on Netflix.</p>\n<p>\n\tLater on, “F1: The Movie” producer Jerry Bruckheimer joined the stage for a discussion about his legacy, a potential follow-up to the racing film, “Top Gun 3” and a new “Pirates of the Caribbean” installment.</p>\n<p>\n\tGabrielle Union was also honored with <em>Variety’s </em>inaugural Entrepreneur Impact Award for her accomplishments in co-founding Proudly, a sustainable baby care brand with products designed for infants of color.</p>\n<p>\n\tAdditionally, conversations included panel discussions on leveraging content creators and influencers for digital campaigns, expanding on new and existing fandoms through live experiences, virtual reality reshaping entertainment, integrating AI to elevate human creativity, among other topics.</p>\n<p>\n\tRead below for a few of the key takeaways from the 2025 Entertainment and Technology Summit:  \n\t</p>\n\t<h4>\n\t\tExpanding Entertainment: VR’s Role in Shaping New Audience Experiences\t</h4>\n<p>\n\tSarah Malkin, director of entertainment content for Meta’s Reality Labs, discussed how virtual reality is changing the way audiences experience live entertainment. “We are watching VR enable and empower a whole slew of new experiences that are often very complementary and additive to the fandom that people already have for entertainment that they love,” she said.</p>\n<p>\n\tAs VR works to enhance the consumer experience, Malkin said the main hurdle that they still face is developing a universal headset that doesn’t intimidate audiences who are unfamiliar with the technology.</p>\n<p>\n\t Despite the challenge, Malkin said that the huge success within the gaming community inspired them to expand their entertainment catalog into sports, concerts, films, TV and other entertainment experiences.</p>\n<p>\n\tAdditionally, Malkin talked about their recent partnerships with creators like filmmaker James Cameron and film producer Jason Blum of Blumhouse Productions. “We see it [VR] continuing to complement other forms of entertainment to have a new way of experiencing, providing tools for storytellers and consumers and an economy around that.”</p>\n\t<h4>\n\t\tThe Booming Live Experience Economy\t</h4>\n<p>\n\tLive experiences experts from Funko, Ernst & Young, Warner Bros. Discovery and Pinterest explored how the increased consumer demand for live experiences has become critical to the entertainment industry.</p>\n<p>\n\tJudy Lee, global head of experiences at Pinterest, emphasized the importance of bridging the gap between world-building and fandoms to create deeply immersive real-life experiences that resonate with audiences at the core.</p>\n<p>\n\t“Fandom and authenticity are so important to audiences,” Lee said. “I think that [quarantine] left a gap for people and a hunger to connect and feel something. I’ve learned that these younger generations blur the lines between the physical and digital worlds.”</p>\n<p>\n\tShe continued, “To them, they think digital is real. That is their life. That is authentic, and they’re much savvier than people who aren’t digital natives. They crave authenticity, transparency and main character energy.”</p>\n<p>\n\tSimon Robinson, COO of WB Studios and Head of Global Experiences, added that they key to creating successful live experiences is keeping it authentic to the brand.\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\t“The key to success is not just a commercial experience,” Robinson said. “It’s about the extension of the brand. Everything in the experiential world should be a brand deposit, not a chance to rip money out of someone’s pocket.”</p>\n\t<h4>\n\t\tGroundbreakers of Creative Marketing \t</h4>\n<p>\n\tMarketing leaders from Neon, NBCUniversal, Walt Disney Studios and Warner Records talked about how word-of-mouth remains impactful and the ways they use content creators and influencers as part of their marketing strategies to deliver buzz for their campaigns.</p>\n<p>\n\tMargaret Walker, executive vice president of entertainment marketing at NBCUniversal, said that she leverages their talent to build exceptional content, build fandom and drive loyalty and community.  </p>\n<p>\n\t“It’s really important when finding creators to work with to find a creator who will most authentically resonate with the audience you’re trying to reach and authentically loves our brand,” Walker said.</p>\n<p>\n\tDustin Sandoval, senior vice president of digital marketing at Walt Disney Studios, spearheaded the campaign strategy for “Freakier Friday” and credited its success to creating one-of-a-kind moments that naturally went viral among the audiences that the content creators and influencers serve.</p>\n<p>\n\t“You create opportunities and moments for content creation,” Sandoval said. “It happened organically, and all of these moments sparked and just hit everyone’s FYP in a positive way. The film, hitting $150 million globally recently, was just a big success, and we’re very proud of the campaign.”</p>\n\t<h4>\n\t\tLeveling Up in the Entertainment Industry: AI to Unlock New Creative Frontiers\t</h4>\n<p>\n\tJason Chen, Desert Eclipse CEO, founder and executive producer, shared how he has integrated AI in his studio to shorten the production timelines for feature films and animations. </p>\n<p>\n\t“We’re putting the artists first,” Chen said. “We go in from a writer’s perspective and use technology to allow creators and filmmakers to open up those books of ideas that you would think would never be possible.” </p>\n<p>\n\tHe shared an example of using AI to shorten variation shots for CG modeling or motion tracking to ultimately reduce animation production timelines down to 12-18 months.</p>\n<p>\n\tShahrzad Rafati, founder and CEO of RHEI, said she uses AI in her workflow to elevate human creativity and streamline the creative process. “The amount of content that we’re putting out there is far more educational, entertaining and higher quality,” she said. You’re allowing everyone to achieve their full potential for creativity.”\n\t</p>\n\t<h4>\n\t\t<strong>Behind the Scenes with Zeam, featuring John Stamos and Jack Perry</strong>\t</h4>\n<p>\n\tAfter launching in 2009, Jack Perry, founder and CEO of Zeam, discussed how he’s expanding his platform beyond supporting the live streams of local broadcasters to venture into live event streaming. </p>\n<p>\n\t“We’re trying to lead by example on the content side, so we can show what could be leaning very heavily on pop-up live.” </p>\n<p>\n\tAs a way to push the envelope of technology, Perry has worked with John Stamos to crowdsource creatives for more content opportunities that run 24/7 on Zeam. </p>\n<p>\n\tThe duo has joined forces to take their streaming on the road with destination content in music and comedy, ultimately extending their reach by becoming more of a consumer-facing brand.</p>\n\t<h4>\n\t\tTV Industry Transformed \t</h4>\n<p>\n\tEvan Adlman, executive vice president of commercial sales and revenue operations at AMC Networks, talked about the current challenge of the TV landscape is figuring out how to get their content in front of as many viewers as possible due to the current model being extremely fragmented. </p>\n<p>\n\tHowever, Adlman emphasized the importance of fandom to combat the industry issue that networks are facing.</p>\n<p>\n\t“The way that we’re trying to capitalize on that is to make it easier for clients, advertisers, and our partners to understand what true fandom is versus passive viewing. And passive viewing doesn’t exist as much as it used to.”</p>\n<p>\n\tDespite fragmented viewership, inability to measure across different platforms and other disruptions, the panel of industry leaders mentioned their excitement for the future of advertising and finding new ways to create the best viewer experience. </p>\n<p>\n\tSean Booker, head of media and entertainment sales at Vizio, noted that shoppable TV is up next for the future of advertising and TV.</p>\n<p>\n\t“Shoppable TV will be huge in the future,” Booker said. “TV is the heartbeat of the home. The ability to transact on your TV and things like that will clearly come to the forefront in the near future.” </p>\n\t<h4>\n\t\tChampions of Sports Culture Across Platforms \t</h4>\n<p>\n\tWhen it comes to scaling success on a broadcast network, Robert Gottlieb, president of marketing at Fox Sports, shared an example of how crucial it is to get core fans to engage outside of the sporting events that they’re familiar with by finding their passion point.\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\t“IndyCar is the fastest racing on earth,” he said. “They’re faster than F1 and NASCAR. That’s a compelling, interesting truth to people who are interested in motorsports. So we’ve built off of that.” </p>\n<p>\n\tCarlos “Olek” Lewenstein, president of global sports at Televisa Univision, emphasized the importance of utilizing multiple social platforms as a marketing tool.</p>\n<p>\n\t“If you have a sports property and you’re not unfolding into every single platform, you’re leaving money on the table because the leagues are charging you for that platform anyway.” </p>\n\t<h4>\n\t\tStorytelling Entrepreneurs\t</h4>\n<p>\n\tSarah Foster, executive producer of “Nobody Wants This,” shared how authentic storytelling laid the framework for her Netflix show and is what she has found resonates with audiences the most. </p>\n<p>\n\t“When I was writing the ‘Nobody Wants This’ pilot, I wasn’t writing a rom-com, and I wasn’t trying to bring rom-coms back or tell a different kind of story,” she said. “I just wanted to tell a story that was meaningful to me.”</p>\n<p>\n\tShe continued, “It was not following an act structure or an A/B story that I had learned in college. It was really just the story I wanted to tell.”</p>\n<p>\n\tMatt Rogers, host of “Las Culturistas,” spoke about creating the podcast in 2016 with Bowen Yang and how their “Las Culturistas Culture Awards” started as a joke during one of their segments before transforming into a live awards show that aired on Bravo in July.</p>\n<p>\n\t“It was to make us have fun, laugh and involve everyone in a big tent of fun because we need that. My job and purpose are to just make people laugh and smile.”</p>\n<p>\n\tWhen asked about what stories they would like to see next, Nicole Byer said a love story and Jake Shane brought up a comedy, in which he would lead. Sarah and Erin Foster want to explore relationships more, whereas Benito Skinner would like to see more stories about friendships.</p>\n<p>\n\t<em>(Pictured top: “Therapuss” host Jake Shane, actor-comedian Benito Skinner, “Los Culturistas” host Matt Rogers)</em></p>\n</div>"
