    "body": "<div><p>\n\tWhile not autobiographical, Costa Rican Kim Torres’s feature debut “If We Don’t Burn How Do We Light Up The Night” (“Si no ardemos, cómo iluminar la noche”) is rooted in her childhood experiences. It draws inspiration from her early years in rural <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/costa-rica/\">Costa Rica</a> where she began to perceive certain dynamics in the village and grew more aware of the dangers lurking in this idyllic setting.</p>\n<p>\n\t“My film has to do with that transition into adulthood and understanding the violence we experience in Latin America and worldwide. It’s something that’s very present in Latin America, more so than in other places,” she tells <em>Variety.</em>\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\tHer coming-of-age drama, which world premieres at the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/san-sebastian-film-festival/\">San Sebastian Film Festival</a>’s New Directors sidebar, follows 13-year-old Laura who feels stifled in her new family. As she begins to adjust to her new environment, surrounded by verdant forests and palm plantations, she finds out that the village hides a shadowy secret that preys on the women in it.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tIts trailer, debuting exclusively in <em>Variety,</em> opens to Laura’s arrival at the village with her mother who has taken Laura to live with her and her boyfriend plus his young daughters.</p>\n<figure><p>\n<iframe width=\"500\" height=\"281\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/ljeQP37i_I0?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\"></iframe>\n</p></figure>\n<p>\n\tAccording to Torres, the title draws inspiration from a line in the poem “Kerem Gibi” by the Turkish poet Nâzım Hikmet. “In the film, we reimagine its original meaning within the poem and see the burning as a light that shines through the pain. An eternal love that never fades and endures, honoring all those who are no longer with us,” she explains.\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\tHer debut feature is in a way an extension of her previous short films, which also explore childhood and adolescence. “In them, there’s always a subtle shift in reality—it’s never completely grounded in the real world. There’s always something that feels slightly off, like in this case, it’s the mysterious, almost legendary aspect,” she notes.</p>\n<p>\n\tHer short “Night Light” (2022) became the first Costa Rican film nominated for a Palme d’Or at <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/cannes-2/\">Cannes</a>. Her works have been presented at NYFF, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/locarno/\">Locarno</a>, San Sebastián, MoMA, Lincoln Center and the Eye Film Museum.</p>\n<p>\n\t“While making this film, I was drawn to the lightness of childhood — the joy of play, the tenderness of love, the quiet bonds of friendship. At the same time, I wanted to capture the weight carried by a girl standing at the threshold between childhood and adulthood, learning to navigate a world where violence lingers like a shadow. It is a specter that touches not only her own body, but also the bodies of the women she loves, those who have shaped her heart and spirit,” Torres states.</p>\n<p>\n\tThe three young girls are non-pros which Torres found with her casting director Kim Picado, who also served as an acting coach. The casting process focused not so much on the volume of applicants but on the depth of the selection, she recalls.</p>\n<p>\n\t“From the very beginning, we did a pre-selection of candidates, but once we had a group, the real work began — much more in-depth casting and rehearsal. And it was about creating connections between the actors, finding a common language that I really think is what made the whole thing flow so smoothly and created that magic while working with them. We set up this beautiful, calm, and safe atmosphere. And the girls, especially the three of them, really brought something special to the project,” says Torres.</p>\n<p>\n\tThe three young non-pros are Lara Yuja Mora, who plays Laura, Keylin Delgado Arguedas (Daniela) and Valentina Chaves Jimenez (Gaby).</p>\n<p>\n\tThe rest of the cast are Michelle Jones, Teresa Sánchez, Juan Luis Araya, Gabriel Guzmán Rodríguez and Luis Carlos Canhoto Baptista da Silva.</p>\n<p>\n\tThe screenplay is co-penned by Torres and Luisa Mora Fernández.</p>\n<p>\n\t“If We Don’t Burn…” is produced by Costa Rica’s Alejandra Vargas Carballo of Noche Negra Prods. alongside co-producers Mariana Monroy of Tropical Films, Mexico and Camille Ferrero of Les Films du Clan, France.\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\tThe 73<sup>rd</sup> San Sebastian Film Festival kicked off on Sept. 19 and wraps on Sept. 27.</p>\n<div>\n<figure>\n<p><img srcset=\"https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/SNA_Still-11.jpg 3339w, https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/SNA_Still-11.jpg?resize=150,97 150w, https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/SNA_Still-11.jpg?resize=300,194 300w\" src=\"https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/SNA_Still-11.jpg?w=1024\" alt=\"\" />\n\t</p>\n<figcaption>\n\t\t\t\t\t<span>If We Don’t Burn How Do We Light Up The Night, Courtesy of Noche Negra Prods. </span>\n\t</figcaption>\n</figure>\n</div>\n</div>"

    "body": "<div><p>\n\t“Day of the Jackal,” the Eddie Redmayne-fronted TV spy series that became a ratings smash for both Sky and Peacock last year, has a new lead writer for its second series. </p>\n<p>\n\t<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/ronan-bennett/\">Ronan Bennett</a>, who created the show, produced by <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/carnival-films/\">Carnival Films</a> and a modern day interpretation of Frederick Forsyth’s novel and its hit 1973 film adaptation about a globe-trotting assassin and the intelligence officer on his tail, is stepping back from his writing duties due to other commitments but will continue to exec produce.\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\tFor Bennett’s replacement, Carnival has turned to David Harrower, who created its critically acclaimed “Lockerbie: A Search for Truth” drama starring Colin Firth and chronicling the decades-long quest to find the culprits of 1988’s Pam Am Flight 103 bombing. “Lockerbie” was also aired by both Sky and Peacock.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tSpeaking to <em>Variety</em> recently, Carnival CEO Gareth Neame acknowledged that while the first season of the “Day of the Jackal” featured a completely different plot to the original, it had the “same dynamic between the hunter and the hunted” and included numerous references to the film. For season two, due to start production in the coming months, he said there were still “lots of elements from [Forsyth’s] novel that we didn’t utilize in season one” that would appear.</p>\n<p>\n\t“Hopefully it’s going to be another very lavish, slickly directed, well acted, high-octane twist and turn thriller,” he said. </p>\n<p>\n\tAlongside “Day of the Jackal,” Bennett — who first made a name for himself on TV as the creator of “Top Boy” — has recently been behind Paramount+ series “<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/mobland/\">MobLand</a>,” starring Tom Hardy and Pierce Brosnan that was renewed for a second season in June this year. In August, it was announced that Bennett was returning to U.K. network Channel 4 for the first time since “Top Boy” with <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/2025/tv/global/ronan-bennett-series-army-of-shadows-channel-4-1236492725/\">“Army of Shadows,”</a> a six-part drama series inspired by Jean Pierre Melville’s 1969 film and Joseph Kessel’s book of the same name about the French Resistance during WWII, this time set in a near-future authoritarian Britain. \n\t</p>\n<p>\n\tStarring Redmayne as the eponymous hitman and Lashana Lynch as an MI6 agent, “<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/the-day-of-the-jackal/\">The Day of the Jackal</a>” became Sky’s biggest Original series ever with 3 million viewers in its first week in November 2024, ahead of “House of the Dragon” and “Chernobyl.” In the U.S., it became Peacock’s most-watched new original drama series ever after 75 days of viewership, according to NBCUniversal in February of this year.</p>\n</div>"

    "body": "<div><p>\n\t“Emilia Pérez” star Adriana Paz and “<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/society-of-the-snow/\">Society of the Snow</a>” lead Agustín Pardella will star in the untold story of Hilda Gadea, the first wife of revolutionary Ernesto “<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/che/\">Che</a>” Guevara.</p>\n<p>\n\tBased on Gadea’s memoirs, “My Life With Him (Che)” (“Mi vida con él (Che))” turns on the woman whose influence was pivotal in shaping the political vision of one of the most significant icons of the 20th century but whose voice was largely lost in the telling of his.\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\tProduction companies Salado (Uruguay) and Arboleda (Argentina) have joined forces to adapt her memoir for the big screen. Silvina Estévez, best known for her documentaries “Años cortos, dias eternos,” “Me gusta cuando hablas” and “School-of-Life,” is attached to direct the narrative feature.  \n</p>\n<p>\n\tSet in the 1950s, the film will retrace the momentous meeting between a young Ernesto – long before he became “Che” – and Hilda, a Peruvian economist, intellectual and activist, whose sharp political vision and energy left a lasting mark on his path. At its core, the story delves into their romantic bond, Hilda’s journey through motherhood and the agonizing choice that ultimately shaped her life: remain by her daughter’s side or follow the call of the revolution.</p>\n<p>\n\t“Hilda Gadea is not just Che’s wife. She is a woman with strong ideas, a professional, an activist and mother. As a director, I am deeply moved to have Adriana Paz, an actress of immense sensitivity and strength, embody Hilda,” said Estévez.</p>\n<p>\n\tSaid Paz: “To interpret Hilda Gadea is both a privilege and a tremendous responsibility. Her story reminds us that behind every historical figure are voices that deserve to be heard –especially the voices of women who influenced and transformed their time. Being part of this film is a way to bring that memory to life and to question how history is told. Moreover, being part of a Latin American production that unites us through Spanish and our shared roots is profoundly meaningful to me.”\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\tArgentine actor Agustín Pardella, known for his role in J.A. Bayona’s acclaimed “Society of the Snow,” will play Ernesto Guevara.</p>\n<p>\n\t“I celebrate that this is a project told by women. I firmly believe that there are ways of seeing the world that only exist if we are given the opportunity to put them on screen. Just as Hilda understood that economics was a tool of power, so too is film.”</p>\n<p>\n\tNow in development, the project is looking for international production partners to help bring to life a story that weaves the personal and the political into a powerful, globally resonant narrative.</p>\n</div>"

    "body": "<div><p>\n\t<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/filmax/\">Filmax</a> has picked up international sales on “<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/karmele/\">Karmele</a>,” directed by Basque <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/asier-altuna/\">Asier Altuna</a> and produced by <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/marian-fernandez-pascal/\">Marian Fernández Pascal</a> at San Sebastián-based <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/txintxua-films/\">Txintxua Films</a> and <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/esnatzeko-ordua-films/\">Esnatzeko Ordua Films</a>. </p>\n<p>\n\tInspired by Kirmen Uribe’s fact based novel “La hora de despertarnos juntos,” the Basque  drama retraces the life of a real-life figure, Karmele Urresti, a nurse forced into exile during the Spanish Civil War. Played by <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/jone-laspiur/\">Jone Laspiur</a>, she falls in love with trumpet player Txomin Letamendi (<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/eneko-sagardoy/\">Eneko Sagardoy</a>) in France, and together they build a family across Paris, Caracas and Bilbao while navigating the fracture between love, loyalty and political conviction. \n\t</p>\n<p>\n\tAltuna was struck by the density of events packed into the couple’s biography: expulsion, clandestine work against the dictatorship, collaboration with U.S. intelligence, two exiles in as many decades. “The temptation was to chase the sweep of history,” he admits, but the film deliberately narrows its gaze. “I had to restrain myself. What mattered most was their inner life — their dignity, but also their doubts, fears and contradictions.”\n</p>\n<p>\n\tThe relationship at the center of the film reflects that tension between personal and political. Txomin throws himself into militancy, committed to the collective cause. Karmele looks toward the family, to care, to the future of her children. Neither yields, and the fracture between their paths becomes part of the film’s central conflict. Altuna insists this is what makes them relatable: strength mixed with fragility, love complicated by conviction.\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\tLanguage itself becomes a field of resistance. Karmele’s mother, Carmen, was a teacher barred from her profession for giving classes in Basque. “She was disqualified and banished for 15 years, simply for teaching children who often didn’t speak another language,” Altuna told <em>Variety</em>. </p>\n<p>\n\tThat experience shapes Karmele’s outlook, even in exile. She dedicates herself to ensuring her children recover the freedom to speak the forbidden tongue. “It’s not only a story of militancy or exile; it’s about transmission. Identity is preserved through language. In the everyday, in the small things, a battle for dignity is also fought.”</p>\n<p>\n\tThe film’s visual and sonic texture reflects that interplay between joy and loss. Early sequences hum with music, Basque folk, jazz, salsa conveying the excitement of discovery as exiles navigate new worlds. The Eresoinka choir’s rendition of Gernika embodies the defiance of a displaced community, while an improvised bertsolari verse reaches back toward something primal. Yet when the family returns to Bilbao, the soundtrack falls away. “Suddenly, there is silence. That was a conscious decision. Only then is the weight of oppression truly felt,” Altuna explained.</p>\n<p>\n\tHe and composer Aitor Etxeberria avoided dramatic scoring, leaning instead on diegetic music and the absence of sound. “We didn’t want to impose an emotion,” the director explains. “Silence itself becomes oppressive. The audience is left space to construct their own narrative.”</p>\n<p>\n\tVisually, the film favors ellipsis and detail. Instead of re-creating battles, Altuna lingers on gestures: a farmer bartering milk for squid, a father hiding valuables in a chest, a woman’s arms folded. “Nature has its own drama. I like to dwell on nuances, on what connects us to memory,” he said. “Those images come from stories I heard as a child, from the fragments of war that reached us in peacetime. They are part of my truth.”</p>\n<div>\n<figure>\n<p><img srcset=\"https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/KARMELE_004.jpg 3840w, https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/KARMELE_004.jpg?resize=150,81 150w, https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/KARMELE_004.jpg?resize=300,162 300w\" src=\"https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/KARMELE_004.jpg?w=1024\" alt=\"\" />\n\t</p>\n<figcaption>\n\t\t\t\t\t<span>Karmele</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCourtesy of Filmax Films\n\t</figcaption>\n</figure>\n</div>\n<p>\n\tActors Jone Laspiur (“Ane Is Missing”) and Eneko Sagardoy (“Irati”) worked closely from accounts given by Karmele’s surviving children, who described her speech, gestures and way of facing life. Weeks of preparation preceded the short shoot, allowing performances to emerge naturally. “The actors knew exactly where they were in each scene,” Altuna recalled. “Rehearsals, costumes, sets — everything helped step into another era. The result feels balanced: performance, staging, narrative all supporting each other.”\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\tThough grounded in Basque experience, “Karmele” aims wider. It asks what happens when the world collapses and people are forced to decide between surrender and dignity. “This is not just another Civil War film. If the same events were happening today, anywhere rights are violated and fear imposed, it would be the same story. It speaks to how we sustain humanity in the midst of chaos.”</p>\n<p>\n\tThe director is especially drawn to the way his protagonists chose art as a form of resistance. Basque exiles formed the Eresoinka choir to tour Europe, warning of fascism’s advance through music and dance. “Against violence and authoritarianism they opted for culture. They believed art could alert democracies to barbarism,” he says.</p>\n<p>\n\tAltuna sees parallels today. “That border between freedom and oppression can blur very quickly. At a time when totalitarianism resurfaces in different parts of the world, cinema too can be a form of resistance — and of continuing to believe in the possibility of a fairer world.”</p>\n</div>"

    "body": "<div><p>\n\t<br />Nick Cassavetes (“John Q, “The Notebook”) is set to direct the U.S. remake of “The Boy With the Pink Pants,” which topped last year’s Italian box office and broke many hearts along the way. The film tells the harrowing true story of Andrea Spezzacatena, a 15 year-old boy who committed suicide in 2012 after enduring bullying at school and online.</p>\n<p>\n\tThe original movie, directed by Margherita Ferri, became a cultural phenomenon in Italy where it grossed more than $11.8 million from nearly two million moviegoers, beating Hollywood blockbusters such as “Wicked” and strong Italian auteurs such as Paolo Sorrentino with “Parthenope. The film has also inspired a musical stage version which is set to debut next February and is now poised to continue its journey in the U.S.\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\tTarak Ben Ammar, who produced and distributed the original movie with his company <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/eagle-pictures/\">Eagle Pictures</a>, will be producing the American remake with Mark Burg. \n</p>\n<p>\n\t“The Boy with the Pink Pants” seems to be a perfect vehicle for Cassavetes who has demonstrated his talent for creating emotionally charged movies such as “The Notebook,” “John Q” and “Alpha Dog” which marked generations and have become cult. </p>\n<p>\n\t“This movie has all the makings of a great film,” said Cassavetes. “Family, adolescence, first love, but also the terrible reminder that every child, no matter how put together they seem to be on the outside, is vulnerable, and needs to be looked after closely,” he continued, adding that the film also “features a strong and relatable female role.” “It’s a gut punch. It’s a powerhouse,” Cassavetes said. \n\t</p>\n<p>\n\t“The Boy with the Pink Pants” follows a bright adolescent, Andrea, who enrolls in a new school and struggles to cope with his parents’ divorce while trying to make friends. Longing to fit in, the young man attempts by every mean to impress a popular classmate with whom he forms an ambiguous bond. A laundry incident that causes his red pants to become pink becomes the catalyst for the school bullying to intensify, pushing Andrea over the edge. </p>\n<p>\n\t“Unfortunately, Andrea Spezzacatena’s story is not just an Italian story,” Ben Ammar said. “The tragic phenomenon of minors committing suicide due to bullying and cyberbullying has become a global scourge that cinema has a duty to address,” he continued. </p>\n<p>\n\tBen Ammar – who has now created a dedicated division at Eagle Pictures to produce films promoting social changes and aimed at teenagers — pointed out “The Boy With the Pink Pants” struck a chord in Italy, where “it made a difference for hundreds of thousands of young people.” He hopes that “with the American remake, we have the chance to achieve the same effect on millions of people worldwide.”</p>\n<p>\n\tBurg, meanwhile, said was “left speechless” when he saw the Italian film. “The way it handled such a difficult subject with both lightness and depth, making it accessible to such a wide audience, truly moved me—and that’s the main reason so many people embraced it,” Burg said. “Our intention is to preserve the same delicate yet impactful tone, and the first director I thought of for this project was Nick Cassavetes, with whom I made ‘John Q,’ another story where emotions illuminate a very current social drama,” he continued. </p>\n<p>\n\tGina Cassavetes, who is co-producing the film, said, “I’m so proud to be a part of this project. It’s an extremely important story. One that gives us a peek into the new world our youth are growing up in and how as a a family we navigate loving our children the best way we can, when the world can be so cruel”</p>\n<p>\n\tThe screenplay for the remake will be written by Roberto Proia, who was nominated at the Italian Oscars for best adapted screenplay for the original film, and Michael Gallagher.</p>\n<p>\n\tThe American remake will transpose the story to the United States, most likely in a small town; and will flesh out the character of Andrea’s mother, Teresa Manes, whose unique relationship with her son is one of the film’s emotional anchors. Since his tragic death, Manes has become an advocate for anti-bullying initiative and also wrote a book about her son’s experience.</p>\n</div>"

    "body": "<div><p>\n\t<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/beta-film/\">Beta Film</a> has come aboard “<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/a-lovely-mess-rob-the-rich/\">A Lovely Mess – Rob the Rich</a>,” a sharp social dramedy where keeping up with the Joneses means turning to crime.</p>\n<p>\n\tBlending adventure with romantic comedy and class satire, the six-part farce follows Justine (Éléonore Bernheim, “The Art of Crime”) and Rémi (Gil Alma, “The Wagner Method”), a middle-aged couple who hit financial rock bottom just as their family is poised to climb the social ladder. Desperate to keep up appearances, they dive headfirst into a nocturnal double-life, burgling the very elite they long to impress, while uncovering bigger secrets —  and rediscovering each other — along the way. \n\t</p>\n<p>\n\tProduced by Paris-based indie Redstone for France Télévisions, “A Lovely Mess – Rob the Rich” comes from writer Sarah Tissandier and director Stéphanie Pillonca. More serialized than procedural, the show still leans into French TV’s “light crime” tradition—blending intrigue, family drama, and a playful tone that has proven to travel with audiences both at home and abroad. \n</p>\n<p>\n\tBeta Film will roll out international sales at <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/mipcom/\">Mipcom</a> as a part of a diverse lineup that also includes series “Mozart Mozart,” “Empathy” and “Velvet New York – The New Empire.”</p>\n<p>\n\tProduced by Germany’s Story House Pictures (“Sisi”) and ARD, The historical drama “Mozart Mozart” reimagines Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart’s life through the eyes of his talented sister Maria Anna. Here, she assumes her brother’s identity to perform for Emperor Joseph II, navigate the challenges of court life, and pursue her own ambitions, all while keeping a delicate secret from her rival — and paramour — Salieri. \n\t</p>\n<p>\n\tFrom Canada comes “Empathy,” the multi-award-winning dramedy from Florence Longpré. The series follows psychiatrist-criminologist Suzanne as she returns to a secure psychiatric facility to treat dangerous patients using unconventional methods that unsettle her colleagues – except for Mortimer, a fellow professional with his own hidden vulnerabilities. The show recently earned Crave Canada’s highest-performing fiction debut and the Audience Award at Series Mania 2025.</p>\n<p>\n\tRounding out the slate is “Velvet New York – The New Empire,” the U.S. adaptation of the acclaimed Spanish hit “Velvet.” Set in the glamorous world of New York fashion, the series follows a young seamstress and a fashion heir as they navigate love, loss, and betrayal amid ambition and social intrigue. The series was Telemundo’s #1 Spanish-language program, drawing 1.29 million viewers and significantly outperforming the network’s average.</p>\n</div>"

    "body": "<div><p>\n\tSan Sebastián is where Basque cinema’s strategy plays out at scale. This year’s bumper lineup – 13 Basque world premieres and 38 total projects across features, shorts, docs and retrospectives – showcases linguistic resilience and industrial range: Jose Mari Goenaga and <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/aitor-arregi/\">Aitor Arregi</a>’s intimate Official Selection comeback “<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/maspalomas/\">Maspalomas</a>;” <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/asier-altuna/\">Asier Altuna</a>’s historical epic “<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/karmele/\">Karmele</a>;” Koldo Almandoz’s noir-tinged “Mouths of Sky”; and Irati Gorostidi’s austere “Aro Berria.” \n\t</p>\n<p>\n\tDocumentaries include cultural portraits such as “Itoiz Summer Sessions,” “Ez gera alferrik pasako” and “Hombre Bala.”\n</p>\n<p>\n\tIn “Karmele,” one of the Basque films at this year’s festival, the Basque language itself comes under threat. For centuries, rulers sought to stamp out cultural difference, Franco banning Basque from being spoken, sung, or taught. An ancient tongue — believed to be Europe’s oldest still in use — Basque endures where Etruscan and Iberian have vanished.</p>\n<p>\n\tLike Gaelic, Irish, and Breton, Basque has undergone revival, and filmmakers are at the forefront of it. Once seen as a barrier to distribution, subtitles are now far more standard in global viewing, especially for younger audiences raised on streaming. That shift has altered market dynamics. Ireland’s “The Quiet Girl,” shot largely in Irish, became its nation’s first international feature Oscar nominee. Basque producers hope for a similar breakthrough, positioning their language not as a handicap but as a marker of distinction.</p>\n<p>\n\tTaken together, this year’s slate forms a wide canvas from exile and return, generational shifts, and political legacies to music, identity and memory and with it a broader industry play: Basque producers betting on language, story and place to stand out in a too crowded market.\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\tWe profile a number of projects below:</p>\n<p>\n\t<br /><strong>“<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/sundays/\">Sundays</a>”</strong> <strong>(“Los Domingos”) dir. Alauda Ruiz de Azua </strong>(Movistar Plus+, Buenapinta Media, Colosé Producciones, Sayaka Producciones, Encanta Films)</p>\n<p>\n\tAinara, 17, startles her liberal family by announcing she is contemplating joining an enclosed religious order. From the creator of Series Mania’s 2025 Grand Prix winner “Querer,” and offering many of the same pleasures: the mix of suspense drama and psychological and social observance grounded in a knowingly depicted Basque reality; the contrast of two mindsets and a top notch cast. One of San Sebastián’s most anticipated main competition titles, now with a trailer, backed by Movistar Plus+ (“Sirât”), sold by France’s Le Pacte.</p>\n<div>\n<figure>\n<p><img srcset=\"https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Sundays.jpg 800w, https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Sundays.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Sundays.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Sundays.jpg?resize=681,454 681w, https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Sundays.jpg?resize=450,300 450w, https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Sundays.jpg?resize=250,167 250w\" src=\"https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Sundays.jpg\" alt=\"\" />\n\t</p>\n<figcaption>\n\t\t\t\t\t<span>“Sundays,” courtesy of San Sebastián Film Festival</span>\n\t</figcaption>\n</figure>\n</div>\n<p>\n\t<strong>“Los Tigres” dir. <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/alberto-rodriguez-2/\">Alberto Rodríguez</a></strong>(Mazagón Films, Kowalski Films, Feelgood Media, Movistar Plus+, Le Pacte)<br />The “Marshland” and “Prison 77” helmer’s thriller follows siblings Antonio and Estrella, children of a diver, whose lives at sea collapse after Antonio suffers an accident. Discovering hidden cocaine on an oil tanker, Antonio sees escape. With Antonio de la Torre and Bárbara Lennie toplining, the Spain–France co-production mixes survival drama with social point. </p>\n<p>\n\t<strong>“Maspalomas” dirs. <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/jose-mari-goenaga-2/\">José Mari Goenaga</a>, Aitor Arregi</strong> (Irusoin, Moriarti, Maspalomas Pelikula)</p>\n<p>\n\tGoenaga and Arregi (“The Endless Trench”) return with a 100% Basque production about Vicente, 76, who, after an accident, leaves Gran Canaria’s gay scene for a San Sebastián retirement home. There he hides his sexuality once more. Anchored by José Ramón Soroiz (“Homeland”,) the film explores aging, repression and reconciliation. Competing for multiple awards, including the Sebastiane, “Maspalomas” combines intimate storytelling with broader reflections on LGBTQ+ visibility in late life.</p>\n<p>\n\t<strong>She Walks in Darkness (“Un Fantasma en la Batalla”) dir. Agustín Díaz Yanes</strong>(<em>Basoilarraren Filmak)</em><br />Starring Susana Abaitua, Andrés Gertrúdix and Iraia Elias,, Díaz Yanes’ feature dramatizes Spain’s largest covert Civil Guard operation against ETA in the 1990s–2000s. Following Amaia, a young officer who spends a decade undercover, the latest from the Goya winning veteran – whose debut “Nobody Will Speak Of Us When We’re Dead” won a slew of awards – fuses an edge-of-the-seat survival thriller, spotlighting the toll of infiltration. \n\t</p>\n<p>\n\t<strong>“Karmele” dir. Asier Altuna</strong> (Txintxua Films)</p>\n<p>\n\tAltuna’s Basque-language epic traces Karmele’s life from 1937 exile to return from Venezuela, weaving love, music and resistance. “Karmele” is positioned as one of the year’s most ambitious Basque productions, revisiting war, displacement and cultural resilience through a personal love story rooted in history and identity. We linger on folded arms, stay with a hymn to the end and span many decades, this is a film that understands the power of time.</p>\n<p>\n\t<strong>Mouths of Sky (“Zeru Ahoak”) dir. Koldo Almandoz</strong>(Zeru Ahoak, Garabi Films)<br />Almandoz (“Oreina”) returns with a noir-inflected thriller set in Bilbao. Former policewoman Nerea, dismissed from the force, is drawn back when ritualistic murders emerge, confronting ghosts of her past and city’s underworld. With “Querer” lead Nagore Aranburu and Josean Bengoetxea starring, “Mouths of Sky” plays in Special Screenings. Rooted in Basque atmosphere yet shaped by genre, the film offers both detective intrigue and reflections on personal trauma.</p>\n<p>\n\t“<strong>Aro Berria” dir. Irati Gorostidi Agirretxe</strong> (Apellaniz y de Sosa)</p>\n<p>\n\tDeveloped at Ikusmira Berriak in 2022, Gorostidi’s feature debut is set in San Sebastián, 1978. After a failed strike, disillusioned workers leave the factory for a mountain commune, seeking radical change in intimate spheres. Mixing political memory with collective portraiture, the Basque-language film explores post-Franco youthful idealism. Competing for the New Directors, Youth and Irizar Basque Film Awards, “Aro Berria” signals a new voice.</p>\n<p>\n\t<strong>“Lurdes Iriondo, ez gera alferrik pasako” dir. Inge Mendioroz Ibañez</strong> (Maluta films)</p>\n<p>\n\tMendioroz Ibañez’s portrait revisits the life and legacy of singer Lurdes Iriondo. We see she was more than a performer, Iriondo was pivotal in transmitting Basque culture to younger generations, understanding children as the key to the language’s survival. We learn she wrote for both adults and children, she did theatre, she even drew, clearly aware of the importance to portray her culture by any means at hand throughout her life. A compelling tale of cultural resilience and identity.</p>\n<p>\n\t<strong>“Hombre Bala” dir. Anuska Ariztimuño</strong> (Urrelili AIE, Gona Cinema S.L., Baleuko S.L.)\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\tAriztimuño’s documentary portraits veteran musician Mikel Erentxun, reflecting on four decades in Spain’s pop-rock scene and a 25-year relationship with his partner. The film captures the artist’s confrontation with age, mortality and time’s erosion. A public history with private reckoning. </p>\n<p>\n\t<strong>“Arg(h)itzen: Speaking Clearly of Torture, Enlightening Torture” (“Arg(h)itzen: Torturaz argi hitz egiten, tortura argitzen”) dir. Mikelatxo Urbi Taldea </strong>(Nafarroako Torturatuen Sarea)</p>\n<p>\n\tA collective work, “Arg(h)itzen” assembles testimony from 30 victims tortured in Navarre’s Sakana region between 1966 and 2011. We bear witness to the survivors’ accounts and expert analysis, it maps personal trauma against state structures of impunity. The project’s collaborative roots — neighbors joining to recover suppressed truths — lend urgency to its drive for recognition and eradication of torture. </p>\n<p>\n\t<strong>“Daniela, Forever” dir. Nacho Vigalondo </strong> (Sayaka Producciones, Señor y Señora, Mediacrest, Wrong Men)</p>\n<p>\n\tPlaying last year Toronto’s Platform – one of international’s most prestigious competitions – the latest from Basque sci-fi auteur, and the Basque Country’s most international of filmmakers. The English-language movie boasts one of Henry Golding’s finest performances, some critics said, though the final results split reviewers. </p>\n<p>\n\t<strong>“Eloy de la Iglesia, Film Addict” (“Eloy de la Iglesia, Adicto al Cine”) dir. Gaizka Urrest </strong>(Altube Filmiak, Allmura Films)</p>\n<p>\n\tDouble Goya winner Urresti’s (“Labordeta, un hombre sin más”) doc revisits Eloy de la Iglesia, enfant terrible of Spain’s Transition, fearless chronicler of marginal lives. Mixing testimony from collaborators José Sacristán, Fernando Guillén Cuervo and others, it maps a career marked by audacity, drug addiction, ostracism and revival. Competing for both the Irizar Basque Film and Sebastiane Awards, the film reclaims a director who made cinema itself his addiction.</p>\n<p>\n\t<strong>“Pheasant Island”</strong> <strong>(“Faisaien Irla”) dir. Asier Urbieta</strong> (Arcadia Motion Pictures SL, La Tentación Producciones, La Fidèle Production, Galatea Films)<br />Set on Europe’s smallest co-sovereign territory, the Bidasoa River’s Pheasant Island, Urbieta’s fiction debut entwines local life and cross-border politics with a mystery thriller. After a couple witness two men swimming across the river, a corpse appears during the island’s ritual transfer of sovereignty between France and Spain. With Jone Laspiur, also seen in festival with “Karmele”, and Itziar Ituño starring, it balances geopolitical backdrop with intimate drama. Latido Films handles sales.\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\t<strong>“Gregorio Ordóñez, el asesinato que despertó la rebelión contra ETA” dirs. Arantxa Aldaz, Javier Roldán, David Taberna</strong>(El Diario Vasco) </p>\n<p>\n\tMarking 30 years since the killing of San Sebastián deputy mayor and People’s Party councillor Gregorio Ordóñez, the doc reconstructs the events of January 1995 and the subsequent mobilization against ETA. Combining archive and testimony, the film places Ordóñez’s assassination in the broader Basque context, tracing how his death galvanized resistance to ETA. </p>\n<p>\n\t<strong>“Itoiz Summer Sessions” (“Itoiz Udako Sesioak”) dirs. Larraitz Zuazo, Zuri Goikoetxea, Ainhoa Andraka</strong></p>\n<p>\n\t(Doxa Producciones S.L.)<br />Prompted by the discovery of unpublished tapes, Juan Carlos Pérez, frontman of Basque cult band Itoiz, revisits the group’s arc from 1970s prog-rock to their controversial pivot toward pop. Mixing rare material with interviews, the documentary blends nostalgia with a meditation on artistic identity. For Pérez, retracing Itoiz’s trajectory becomes a reckoning with the past and with decisions that split the band at the height of their fame.</p>\n<p>\n\t<strong>“Jone, Sometimes” (“Jone, Batzuetan”) dir. Sara Fantova</strong></p>\n<p>\n\t<em>(Escándalo Films, ESCAC Studio, Amania Films, ECPV)</em></p>\n<p>\n\tDuring Bilbao’s Semana Grande, Jone lives her first love with Olga, as her father’s Parkinson’s illness worsens. A Basque-language coming of age and family tale marking the first feature from Bilbao-born Sara Fantova, an Escac alum cherry-picked to direct three episodes of “This Is Not Sweden.” Produced by the Sergi Casamitjana-led Escac Estudios (“Salve, María”) and Amania Films, headed by director David Pérez Sañudo (“The Last Romantics”). A buzzy title thanks to wins at Málaga and Barcelona’s D’A.</p>\n<p>\n\t<strong>“Breaking Walls” (“Los Aitas”) dir. Borja Cobeaga</strong> (Despadres, Inicia Films, BTeam Prods, Sayaka Producciones)<br />Cobeaga’s return to features unfolds in 1980s Bilbao, where a rhythmic gymnastics team prepares to compete in Berlin. When mothers can’t travel, reluctant fathers step in, embarking on a journey coinciding with the fall of the Wall. With Juan Diego Botto and Quim Gutiérrez among the cast, it layers comedy with social observation, charting how men averse to hands-on parenting confront their changing roles. \n\t</p>\n<p>\n\t“<strong>Ombuaren Itzala” dir. Patxi Bisquert</strong> <strong>(Eguzki Art Zinema) Bisquert’s historical drama turns on poet and <em>bertsolari</em> Pello </strong></p>\n<p>\n\tMari Otaño, who fled Spain to avoid conscription, later returning to Gipuzkoa, marrying, and staging verse performances before illness and political circumstances forced him back to Argentina. With Joseba Usabiaga and Sara Cózar starring, the film traces his struggle to balance literature, ideology and family. “Ombuaren Itzala” reflects on exile and self through the story of a cultural figure divided between continents.</p>\n<p>\n\t“<strong>Ashes” (“Popel”) dir. Oier Plaza</strong> (Fmk media. Filmak, CinePoint, Babel Doc)</p>\n<p>\n\tPlaza’s feature hybridizes documentary investigation and dramatization as two researchers probe the fates of Spaniards deported to Nazi camps. In Prague, their search intersects with the tale of František Suchý, who, with his son, risked their lives to preserve the ashes of 2,000 victims. With cross-border production backing, “Ashes” ties Spanish exile histories to Central European memory, exploring themes of loss, truth, and the persistence of human solidarity under atrocity.</p>\n<div>\n<figure>\n<p><img srcset=\"https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/MASPALOMAS_2-1600x900-1.jpg 1600w, https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/MASPALOMAS_2-1600x900-1.jpg?resize=150,84 150w, https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/MASPALOMAS_2-1600x900-1.jpg?resize=300,169 300w, https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/MASPALOMAS_2-1600x900-1.jpg?resize=125,70 125w, https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/MASPALOMAS_2-1600x900-1.jpg?resize=1000,563 1000w, https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/MASPALOMAS_2-1600x900-1.jpg?resize=910,511 910w, https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/MASPALOMAS_2-1600x900-1.jpg?resize=681,383 681w, https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/MASPALOMAS_2-1600x900-1.jpg?resize=450,253 450w, https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/MASPALOMAS_2-1600x900-1.jpg?resize=250,140 250w\" src=\"https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/MASPALOMAS_2-1600x900-1.jpg?w=1024\" alt=\"\" />\n\t</p>\n<figcaption>\n\t\t\t\t\t<span>“Maspalomas,” courtesy of San Sebastián Film Festival</span>\n\t</figcaption>\n</figure>\n</div>\n<p>\n\t<strong>“The Last Rapture” (“El Último Arrebato”) dirs. Marta Medina, Enrique López Lavigne</strong> (Apache Films, 39 Escalones Films)</p>\n<p>\n\tRevisiting Iván Zulueta’s cult art house horror classic “Rapture,”  Medina and López Lavigne probe the legacy of a film that presaged Spain’s “movida” collapse and mirrored its director’s descent. The documentary positions Arrebato as both prophecy and personal tragedy. Competing for Irizar and Sebastiane Awards, “The Last Rapture” frames Zulueta as Spain’s cursed auteur, embodying the dangers and intoxications of art, drugs and obsession.</p>\n<p>\n\t<strong>“The Truce” (“La Tregua”) dir. Miguel Ángel Vivas, Spain–Kazakhstan)</strong> <strong>(Spassk 99, Umai Film)</strong></p>\n<p>\n\tSet in Spassk-99, a Soviet-era labor camp on the Kazakh steppe during WWII, it follows Spaniards from both sides of the Civil War — Republicans trained in the USSR and Blue Division volunteers captured at Leningrad — forced to cooperate for survival. With Miguel Herrán and Arón Piper starring, Vivas’ historical drama examines ideological enmity confronted by shared hardship. A rare cross border partnering between Spain and Kazakhstan showing in the RTVE Gala.\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\t“<strong>Gipuzkoa Hegan” dirs. Javi Gutiérrez Pereda, Lorea Pérez de Albéniz</strong> (Leike Produkzioak)</p>\n<p>\n\tLaunching a multi-part docuseries, “Gipuzkoa Hegan” offers an aerial journey through the Basque province’s stunning coastline, landscapes and towns, tracing customs and history with narration by Toti Martínez de Lezea. Original music by Fernando Velázquez scores imagery shot from the air. Presented as an EITB Gala, the doc is framed as both cultural showcase and visual celebration of territory, situating Gipuzkoa within a broader project mapping the Basque Country from above.</p>\n<p>\n\t<strong>“Tetsu, Txispa, Hoshi” dir. Jon Arregui Larrazabal</strong>(Digytal Audiovisuales)<br />Following Japanese chef Tetsuro Maeda, who built Michelin-starred restaurant Txispa at the foot of Mount Anboto, it blends food documentary with cultural meditation. Narrated through Maeda’s own reflections, the film charts his journey from Tokyo childhood to culinary reinvention in the Basque Country, anchoring his dishes in local landscapes and myths. </p>\n<p>\n\t“<strong>Heidi: Rescue of the Lynx” (“Heidi, Katamotzaren Erreskatea”) dirs. Tobias Schwarz, Aizea Roca</strong> (3Doubles Producciones, Studio 100 Film, Heidi Production Film, Hotel Hungaria Animatie, Sumendi Uhartea)<br />Reinventing Johanna Spyri’s classic, the animated feature follows Heidi as she discovers an injured lynx and sets out with Peter to reunite it with its family. Facing off against an unscrupulous businessman threatening nature, Heidi’s mission blends adventure with ecological themes. Co-directed by Germany’s Tobias Schwarz and Spain’s Aizea Roca, and produced with Belgian backing, the family film screens in Movies for Kids, expanding Basque co-production into international animation.</p>\n<p>\n\t<strong>“White Roses, Fall!” (“¡Caigan las Rosas Blancas!”) dir. Albertina Carri</strong> (Gentil Cine)<br />Argentine auteur Carri (“The Blonds”) returns with a hybrid autofiction where a young filmmaker, once author of a lesbian porn experiment, is hired to direct a mainstream porn production. Rejecting convention, she embarks on a schlep with friends from Buenos Aires to São Paulo, searching for alternative ways to narrate gender and desire.

Julio Medem</strong> (Morena Films, Eidan Produce, Barbazul La Película)\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\tSan Sebastián-born Julio Medem (“Lovers of the Arctic Circle”) premieres “8,” an epic intertwining Octavio and Adela’s lives across 90 years, beginning with their births on the day of Spain’s Second Republic proclamation. Played by Ana Rujas, Javier Rey and Álvaro Morte, the characters’ fates loop across history in the shape of infinity. Produced out of Spain with Basque involvement, “8” marks Medem’s ambitious return, mixing love story with sweeping political backdrop.</p>\n<p>\n\t<strong>“Undercover”</strong> <strong>(“La Infiltrada”) dir. Arantxa Echevarría</strong> (Esto También Pasará, Bowfinger International Pictures, Beta Fiction Spain)</p>\n<p>\n\tA big, big breakout in Spain last year, grossing €9.7 million ($11.3 million), the second highest box office score in Spain over the last 18 months. Echevarría (“Carmen &amp; Lola”) directs a thriller about a police officer infiltrating ETA’s circles as a sympathizer, then tasked with sheltering militants preparing attacks. With Carolina Yuste and Luis Tosar starring, the feature dramatizes the most dangerous mission of her life, as she balances reporting to her superiors with the constant risk of discovery by the group. It squeezes the Basque conflict through a taut undercover drama.</p>\n<p>\n\t<br /><strong>“Queen of Coal” (“Miss Carbón”) dir. Agustina Macri</strong> (Morena Films, The Warning of Rivard)</p>\n<p>\n\tA Netflix title in Latin America, providing the closing night gala for August’s Sanfic in Chile. Drawing from real events, Macri’s co-production follows Carlita, the first woman miner in a town where superstition barred female presence underground. Starring Lux Pascal and Paco León, “Queen of Coal” shows her fight for recognition against gendered prohibitions and community hostility. Produced between Spain and Argentina, the film plays Made in Spain, spotlighting themes of perseverance, gender boundaries and social prejudice in a narrative pitched between biopic and social drama.</p>\n<p>\n\t<br /><strong>“The Story of Us” (“Nosotros”) dir.

    "body": "<div><p>\n\t<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/dani-de-la-orden/\">Dani de la Orden</a>, director of 2024 breakout “A House on Fire,” is set to adapt for <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/beta/\">Beta</a> Fiction Spain “<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/el-director/\">El director</a>,” the best-selling non-fiction book written by David Jiménez, about his experience as editor-in-chief of Spanish daily newspaper.</p>\n<p>\n\tA former international correspondent in Asia and war reporter, Jiménez was brought in in May 2014 supposedly to lead El Mundo’s digital transformation. What he found, however, as he recounts in “El director,” was a mutual favors pact between the newspaper and Spain’s establishment. Refusing to compromise the publication’s independence he was dismissed after just a year.\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\tDe la Orden will helm “El Director” from a screenplay by two of Spain’s most reputed screenwriters, Michel Gaztambide (“No Rest for the Wicked,” “Close Your Eyes”) and Alejandro Hernández (“Los Farad,” “The Captive”). \n</p>\n<p>\n\tA “high-profile drama,” the film will go into principal photography in February 2026, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/beta-fiction-spain/\">Beta Fiction Spain</a> CEO Mercedes Gamero told <em>Variety</em>. “This is a very interesting, very contemporary, very important topic, underscored by what has just happened to Jimmy Kimmel,” he added, noting as a reference in tone “All the President’s Men,” added Pablo Nogueroles, General Manager of Beta Fiction Spain.</p>\n<p>\n\t<strong>Terrorist Manhunt Thriller ‘Cronos’ Goes Into Production</strong><br />News of the “El Director” adaptation comes just days after Beta Fiction Spain and Nostromo Pictures, behind Netflix smash hit “Through My Window,” announced production on “Cronos,” a large scale high-stakes thriller centering on the real-life operation – Operation Cronos – launched to hunt down the perpetrators of the 2017 Barcelona terrorist attacks. \n\t</p>\n<p>\n\tShooting for eight weeks from Sept. 29 on different locations in Catalonia, the film is directed by Fernando González Molina, a specialist in big canvas movies such as “Palm Trees in the Snow” and “The Invisible Guardian,” both from Nostromo. Written by genre specialist Alberto Marini (“Retribution,” “Sleep Tight”) “Cronos” will be narrated from the point of view of the head of operations of Catalonia’s Mossos D’Esquadra police force, its communications director and a police officer in Ripoll, the small town in the Pyrenees where the terrorists came from, Gamero said.</p>\n<p>\n\t“Cronos” is based on two years of research, including the real-life figures portrayed in the film who were met by the film’s actors, to understand their real feelings during what became a four-day manhunt. “This will establish highly emotional dramatic arcs for the main characters in the film,” Gamero noted. Film Factory Ent. handles international sales rights.<br /></p>\n<p>\n\t<strong>‘La Roja,’ ‘Rondallas’</strong></p>\n<p>\n\tThe man-hunt thriller goes into production as Beta Fiction moves into pre-production on “La Roja” from Marcel Barrera, writer-director of 2025 best-picture Goya winner “El 47,” another eye-catching box office breakout which has grossed €4.0 million ($4.7 million) in Spain.<br />A feel-good dramedy with social elements a la ‘Full Monty,’ but based on true facts like ‘El 47,’” Gamero has said, “La Roja” comes in on immigration from a novel angle, turning on Pakistan and Indian nationals who came to the people to form an important part of the Spanish national cricket team.</p>\n<p>\n\t<strong>New Acquisitions: ‘Anxious People,’ ‘Violette’ and ‘Les Miserables’</strong><br />In other news, Beta Fiction Spain has acquired Spanish distribution rights to three high-profile upcoming movies. Starring Angelina Jolie, Aimee Lou Wood and Jason Segel, “Anxious People” is helmed by “A Man Called Otto” and “World War Z” director Marc Forster from a script by Oscar-nominated screenwriter David Magee, adapting Fredrik Backman’s novel. Black Bear, Hope Studios, 2DUX, and World Wide Word produce the feature which is currently shooting at the newly launched Pinewood Indie Film Hub.</p>\n<p>\n\tHeaded by Matthias Schoenaerts, Melvil Poupaud and Leila Bekhti, “Violette,” the second-chance drama marking the next film by “Amelie” director Jean-Pierre Jeunet, was introduced to buyers by <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/studiocanal/\">Studiocanal</a> at this year’s Cannes Market. Mediawan’s Palomar and 24 25 Films produce.\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\tFollowing on Beta Fiction Spain’s successful release of “The Count of Monte Cristo,” it has also acquired “Les Miserables,” also from Studiocanal, starring Vincent Lindon and Tahar Rahim. “We feel that these timeless, well-written stories can resonate with audiences, as happened recently with “The Count of Montecristo” said Gamero.</p>\n<p>\n\t<strong>Beta Fiction Spain’s Way Forward</strong><br />“It’s increasingly more difficult to be successful theatrically, but that’s our goal. We’re building our pipeline. said Nogueroles, noting Beta Fiction Spain will release La “Familia Benneton 2” in 2026. “Our goal will be to be the number one independent or one of one of the top independent distributors in Spain on the distribution side,” he added.<br />Several tailwinds play in Beta Fiction Spain’s favor.</p>\n<p>\n\tFor one thing, it is now up to full speed. “This is our third year of operations and the first year in which we will have what we were set up to do which is to have 10-12 movies theatrically released per year, about half of them films that we produced or co-produced with partners. And the other half films that we acquire,” said Nogueroles.</p>\n<p>\n\tIt has excellent talent relations, also attaching Arantxa Echevarría, behind ETA mole thriller “Undercover” which has grossed an extraordinary €9.7 million ($11.3 million) in Spain, to direct bio “Dolores,” an upcoming fiction film portrait of Dolores Ibarruri, La Pasionaria.</p>\n<p>\n\t“One of our goals is to keep on working with the talent we used to work in our previous lives. Having the next movies of Marcel Barrena, Dani de la Orden, Arantxa Echevarría, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/fernando-gonzalez-molina/\">Fernando Gonzalez Molina</a> – four of the top notch filmmakers in Spain, is for us important,” Gamero observed.</p>\n<p>\n\tAs the theatrical market contracts around a select number of releases, BFS has the muscle to take big swings. “We are certainly looking for bigger films on the acquisition front, uh, from bigger partners and from better partners,” said Nogueroles.</p>\n<p>\n\tIn what may move towards a closer title-by-title relationship in Spain between two of Europe’s most important and ambitious upscale studios – Beta and Studiocanal – Beta Fiction has not only acquired two of the best selling Studiocanal titles at Cannes – “Violette” and “Les Miserables” but has also picked up “Band Together” (“Rondallas”), produced by Ramón Campos’ Bambú Producciones, co-owned by Studiocanal. \n\t</p>\n<p>\n\tThe return to feature film direction by Sánchez Arévalo, one of Spain’s foremost crossover filmmakers, the film world premieres at San Sebastián and could prove a crowd-pleaser, follows the inhabitants of a town in Galicia who, after a traffic accident at sea, decide to dust off the village “rondalla,” a traditional music band.</p>\n<p>\n\tSpain, moreover, has not suffered so much the pull back of streaming services seen in many parts of the world. According to the European Audiovisual Observatory, last year global streamers plowed €2.0 billion ($2.3 billion) into Spanish originals, doubling their investment in France, Germany and Italy.</p>\n<p>\n\tStreaming services are also increasingly ready to partner on different widowing models. “We continue working with partners like Movistar Plus+, Atresmedia, Amazon Prime Video, HBO Max. Their support has been vital to us as a new company. Without them, we wouldn’t have been able to do anything,” said Nogueroles.</p>\n</div>"
