That’s when producer <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/devon-franklin/\">DeVon Franklin</a> decided to ask Serayah to audition for the role of Ruth. He was already familiar with her acting and singing talents from producing the BET+ series “Kingdom Business,” a drama in which she starred, set in the gospel music industry. \n\t</p>\n<p>\n\t“The moment she auditioned, it was like ‘There’s Ruth,'” Franklin told <em>Variety</em>. “But we didn’t know who Boaz was going to be.” \n</p>\n<p>\n\tThe filmmakers watched hundreds of actors’ auditions and settled on a handful of finalists, he recalled. “Then, at the 11th hour, Tyler Lepley sent in his self-tape. And we were like, ‘There’s Boaz,'” Franklin said. “We did a chemistry read [with Serayah], and it was just magic.”</p>\n<p>\n\tAs fate would have it, the actors had recently wrapped making a movie together, the upcoming horror film “Goons,” before reuniting for these roles. “It was a beautiful thing for them to have this type of chemistry, to have already worked together and now get the chance to bring this classic love story to the big screen,” Franklin said, acknowledging the divine alignment at play. “It was just amazing how it came together.”</p>\n<div>\n<figure>\n<p><img srcset=\"https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Screenshot-2025-09-24-at-10.15.50 https://variety.com/2025/film/news/ruth-boaz-serayah-tyler-lepley-producer-devon-franklin-1236528178/AM.png 1018w, https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Screenshot-2025-09-24-at-10.15.50 https://variety.com/2025/film/news/ruth-boaz-serayah-tyler-lepley-producer-devon-franklin-1236528178/AM.png?resize=150,76 150w, https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Screenshot-2025-09-24-at-10.15.50 https://variety.com/2025/film/news/ruth-boaz-serayah-tyler-lepley-producer-devon-franklin-1236528178/AM.png?resize=300,151 300w\" src=\"https://variety.com/wp-content/themes/pmc-variety-2020/assets/public/lazyload-fallback.gif\" alt=\"\" />\n\t</p>\n<figcaption>\n\t\t\t\t\t<span>Serayah and Tyler Lepley in “Ruth & Boaz.”</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tNetflix\n\t</figcaption>\n</figure>\n</div>\n<p>\n\t“Ruth & Boaz,” now streaming on Netflix, puts a modern spin on the bible story and centers on rising hip-hop artist Ruth Moably (Serayah), who gives up her promising music career and leaves Atlanta after a heated dispute with her manager results in the death of her boyfriend. In hopes of a fresh start, Ruth moves to a rural city in Tennessee, where she cares for her late boyfriend’s widowed mother, Naomi (Phylicia Rashad). Ruth takes on a new job working in a local vineyard, where she meets Boaz (Lepley), a winemaker, and begins to fall in love, rediscovering her passion for music in the process.\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\t​Serayah, who is also a music artist, was surprised by some of the parallels she shared with Ruth. She said that Ruth finding her voice, speaking up and stepping out on faith are similar to the experiences she’s had to navigate in the music industry.</p>\n<p>\n\t​“Falling in love is also a parallel in my real life,” Serayah said. “You never know where things are going to lead you. When you’re open enough to receive and let your guard down, you realize you have to stop fighting yourself. I have to stop fighting divinity. I have to give in. There’s something beautiful on the other side of that.”</p>\n<p>\n\t​Set against the backdrop of Atlanta’s music scene, “Ruth & Boaz” included cameo appearances from industry powerhouses Jermaine Dupri, Yung Joc and Kenneth “Babyface” Edmonds. In fact, the R&B maestro Babyface wrote, recorded and produced a song for the film, titled “Faithful,” which Serayah performs onscreen. </p>\n<p>\n\tThe collaboration was Serayah’s first time working with the 13-time Grammy winner, and she admitted she was a little terrified to work with the high-profile artist. “I didn’t want to fan girl too much and make him uncomfortable, but I’m like, ‘You wrote this?’ It’s a beautiful record,” Serayah said, with a laugh. “It was amazing,” Serayah said about working with the 13-time Grammy winner for the first time. “His voice is angelic. It sounds just like the records. He’s just so poised, grounded, easy to talk to and create with.”</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd, for the record, she’d love to collaborate again. “That would be a dream come true,” Serayah said at the suggestion that they make another track.</p>\n<div>\n<figure>\n<p><img srcset=\"https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Screenshot-2025-09-24-at-10.14.47 https://variety.com/2025/film/news/ruth-boaz-serayah-tyler-lepley-producer-devon-franklin-1236528178/AM.png 943w, https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Screenshot-2025-09-24-at-10.14.47 https://variety.com/2025/film/news/ruth-boaz-serayah-tyler-lepley-producer-devon-franklin-1236528178/AM.png?resize=150,100 150w, https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Screenshot-2025-09-24-at-10.14.47 https://variety.com/2025/film/news/ruth-boaz-serayah-tyler-lepley-producer-devon-franklin-1236528178/AM.png?resize=300,199 300w, https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Screenshot-2025-09-24-at-10.14.47 https://variety.com/2025/film/news/ruth-boaz-serayah-tyler-lepley-producer-devon-franklin-1236528178/AM.png?resize=910,607 910w, https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Screenshot-2025-09-24-at-10.14.47 https://variety.com/2025/film/news/ruth-boaz-serayah-tyler-lepley-producer-devon-franklin-1236528178/AM.png?resize=681,454 681w, https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Screenshot-2025-09-24-at-10.14.47 https://variety.com/2025/film/news/ruth-boaz-serayah-tyler-lepley-producer-devon-franklin-1236528178/AM.png?resize=450,300 450w, https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Screenshot-2025-09-24-at-10.14.47 https://variety.com/2025/film/news/ruth-boaz-serayah-tyler-lepley-producer-devon-franklin-1236528178/AM.png?resize=250,167 250w\" src=\"https://variety.com/wp-content/themes/pmc-variety-2020/assets/public/lazyload-fallback.gif\" alt=\"\" />\n\t</p>\n<figcaption>\n\t\t\t\t\t<span>Kenny “Babyface” Edmonds in “Ruth & Boaz.”</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tNetflix\n\t</figcaption>\n</figure>\n</div>\n<p>\n\tUnlike Serayah, who said she was familiar with the bible story before starring in the film, Lepley was introduced to <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/ruth-and-boaz/\">Ruth and Boaz</a> once he signed on to the project. While he might not have been as well-versed on the ins and outs of their story, the actor said he isn’t a stranger to having his faith tested. Just like Boaz, he has also faced challenges where relying on his faith was his only option.</p>\n<p>\n\t​“For the most part, my faith hasn’t wavered,” Lepley explained. “But we’re human. You’re going to go up. You’re going to go down. I feel like I have it figured out, then I don’t. All we have is God at the end of the day.”\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\tDirected by Alanna Brown, ​“Ruth & Boaz” marks the first film that <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/tyler-perry/\">Tyler Perry</a> and Franklin have produced <a href=\"https://variety.com/2024/film/news/tyler-perry-devon-franklin-faith-films-netflix-1235992932/\" target=\"_blank\">under their first-look partnership </a>with Netflix to bring more faith-based stories to the platform. Franklin, who is also a minister, was inspired to tell this particular Bible story after preaching a sermon series on singleness and relationships.</p>\n<p>\n\t​“As I was studying, it helped me understand what it means to be single and committed to service and a purpose greater than yourself,” Franklin said. </p>\n<p>\n\tHe also recognized that Ruth and Boaz’s tale had all the elements of a great movie. “This has romance. There’s some danger. There are great characters,” he explained. “I did some research, and I don’t think there’s ever been a modern version of the story of Ruth and Boaz. It felt like everything was aligning and that this was the right story to tell at the right time.”</p>\n<p>\n\tWhile grief, faith and love are embedded throughout the film, the last of those themes is what Franklin hopes inspires viewers the most. </p>\n<p>\n\t“Love is the most powerful force in the universe,” he said. “Love always wins. Stay open to love. When we’re open, love can go out and come in. If we have love, we have everything that we need.”</p>\n<div>\n<figure>\n<p><img srcset=\"https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Screenshot-2025-09-24-at-11.06.57 https://variety.com/2025/film/news/ruth-boaz-serayah-tyler-lepley-producer-devon-franklin-1236528178/AM.png 992w, https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Screenshot-2025-09-24-at-11.06.57 https://variety.com/2025/film/news/ruth-boaz-serayah-tyler-lepley-producer-devon-franklin-1236528178/AM.png?resize=150,102 150w, https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Screenshot-2025-09-24-at-11.06.57 https://variety.com/2025/film/news/ruth-boaz-serayah-tyler-lepley-producer-devon-franklin-1236528178/AM.png?resize=300,204 300w\" src=\"https://variety.com/wp-content/themes/pmc-variety-2020/assets/public/lazyload-fallback.gif\" alt=\"\" />\n\t</p>\n<figcaption>\n\t\t\t\t\t<span>Serayah in “Ruth & Boaz.”</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tNetflix\n\t</figcaption>\n</figure>\n</div>\n</div>"

    "body": "<div><p>\n\tThere aren’t very many shows where you can reasonably claim that if it ended after the first number, you’d have gone home happy. And maybe even in the case of <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/paul-mccartney/\">Paul McCartney</a>‘s concert Friday night at the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/santa-barbara-bowl/\">Santa Barbara Bowl</a>, it would count as  hyperbolic. An audience that paid $300-600 for tickets to see him in an uncharacteristically smallish venue would have expected — and got — a little more for their money than that. Even so, let’s just go with that slightly exaggerated feeling and emphasize what a major kick it was to see McCartney open his 2025 tour by singing the John Lennon-associated Beatles song “Help!” in full in public for the first time in his career. \n\t</p>\n<p>\n\tIt was a <em>you had to be there</em> moment, but a lot more people <em>will</em> be there in the weeks to come, and presuming this stays as the opener for all the shows to come, the joy will be spread around to considerably more than just the roughly 4,900 people who got to see it in Friday’s underplay gig. The tour continues Monday night on a different end of southern California, at Palm Springs’ Acrisure Arena, where it will have what was initially set to be (and may still count as) its official opening, and will definitely count as the first truly representative show of the tour, with no staging or curfew restrictions. \n</p>\n<p>\n\tWe won’t be sure until Palm Springs, in other words, whether McCartney’s regular setlists might be a little longer than the hour and 55 minutes that he played in Santa Barbara, which due to its mid-residential nature has a hard out of 10 p.m. But who care about curfew issues, anyway? Didn’t I just tell say it could have ended at 8:05 and it’d have been fine?\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\tThe asterisk on his performance of “Help!” is that, as Macca-holics will well remember, McCartney <em>did</em> have it in his nighty setlist back in 1990 — but only a 50-seconds-or-so snippet of it as part of a Lennon tribute medley late in the show. Kicking off his shows with the number now is a more radical and expansive move. It follows in a recent tradition, actually, of beginning concerts with a Lennon-associated number, something he did a decade ago with “A Hard Day’s Night.” But “Help!” is even more identified as a John song … some of us would even consider it <em>the</em> best John song, if forced to do something so foolish as single out such a thing. And as tributes to his fallen comrade go, this is a hundred times more effective at this point than reviving “Here Today” again would be. No speeches or preambles necessary — it’s an inherently sentimental choice that’s also just viscerally exciting, regardless of whether you’re giving its rarity or heritage a second thought.</p>\n<p>\n\tThe second number of the show was, if not as much of a surprise, equally a corker… and a thematically appropriate choice for the followup choice in the set. Right after singing “I’m feeling down,” he kicked into “Coming Up”… because let’s face it, in Paul McCartney’s oft-rosy world, no one is going to suffer from depression, even exhilarating depression, for more than one song at a time. And “Coming Up” is underrated, if anything, as one of McCartney’s great explosions of joy (at least in the live single version that became a No. 1 hit in 1980). On a big screen behind the stage, McCartney’s crew put up animated footage of an apocalyptic cityscape giving way to massive flower blooms, as a three-man brass section, the Hot City Horns, came out for the first of many appearances to help McCartney and his funk-efficient band in set the world aright again. This might be the best one-two punch to open a show that McCartney has ever had on one of his tours. </p>\n<p>\n\tFrom there, the concert followed along more expected lines in its sequence and content, as largely a condensed version of the epic show that passed through SoCal in 2022, when he was playing SoFi Stadium. If you were hoping that he would be using the occasion of an upcoming Wings book, documentary and best-of collection to start pulling out some ’70s obscurities, no, this tour is not offering that kind of a refresh, at least as of opening night. At 83, McCartney is definitely staying focused on what he now considers to be his core concert repertoire, But it’s a solidification, not a calcification. If you’ve seen him in recent years, you have a very good idea of what’s coming in the setlist, following that startling opening. \n\t</p>\n<p>\n\tBut what you don’t see or remember coming, maybe, is how good it feels to hear <em>this band</em> playing <em>those songs</em>, in a way that makes you feel like you’re setting the needle down on “Let Me Roll It” or “Jet” for the first or second time. As has been noted, his ensemble — guitarist Rusty Anderson, guitarist-bassist Brian Ray, drummer Abe Laboriel Jr. and keyboardist Paul “Wix” Wickens — has been with him for about a thousand years longer than the Beatles were ever together, give or take. And they still seem to be having as much fun as McCartney is, which is a high bar. Collectively with their front-legend, they are pulling off a neat hat trick: playing the classics very close to the way they were recorded — there’s hardly anything in the set you could even call a re-arrangement — but as fresh takes that are living and breathing on their own with little flourishes and ad libs that reinforce we are hearing the songs in real time. It’s no wonder he wants to stay on the road: Against the odds, everything comes together to make it feel like there is still a lot of tread on the tires of everything that is being performed.</p>\n<p>\n\tThere can also be some element of surprise in what most galvanizes a crowd. The audience in Santa Barbara, not surprisingly, looked to be a little older on average than even the median age for a McCartney show “in town,” as it were — and so there was just a surprising amount of <em>sitting</em>, up in the seated areas of the house, if obviously not in the GA floor area. But looking through the setlist, would you guess the number that finally got everyone in the Bowl on their feet, en masse, no exceptions? You would probably not, because that song was… “Ob-La-Di, Ob-La-Da.” Nothing against it, bra, but we would not have pegged it as <em>the</em> completely irresistible, take-no-prisoners barnburner of the night. (At future tour stops, your crowd’s mileage may vary.)</p>\n<p>\n\tThe Santa Barbara show was tacked on to the beginning of the tour with the proviso that it would not be the full, <em>full </em>production than fans would see beginning Monday in Palm Springs. But you could have fooled the Santa Barbarians: Far from a bare-bones presentation, Friday’s show certainly looked as if it could be the whole setup, with two vertical screens on either side of the stage for musician closeups and a rear screen for pre-recorded video and the occasional crowd shot. The green lasers we’ve been seeing since the “Wings Over the World” tour of ’75-76, which by now have to count as a nostalgic touch? Still present and accounted for. During “Live and Let Die,” smoke plumes went up, violently, on the appropriate beats — but the only flames were on the screen, so it’s possible that actual pyro is the one thing fans missed out on that will turn up from Palm Springs forward. We’ll quickly find out.\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\t(An additional side note about the Santa Barbara show, set at one of the world’s loveliest amphitheater settings: As much turmoil as there was around untold thousands of people trying and failing to get tickets through the online lottery earlier in the week… there <em>were</em> tickets on sale at the Bowl box office, after all, in the run-up to showtime, for those willing to brave their way first to SB and then navigate the long and rather confusing box office lines. Read it and weep.)</p>\n<p>\n\tThe real beginning of the show, pre-“Help!,” was a computer-graphics video that climaxed with the sight of McCartney’s Hofner bass exploding into tiny shards. <em>Noooo, he just got it back</em>, the crowd cried (not really, but there <em>is</em> a <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/2025/film/global/paul-mccartney-stolen-guitar-documentary-superman-bbc-1236506795/\">forthcoming documentary movie about that</a>). Not to worry, this very intact artifact was his instrument of choice for the beginning of the show, though he naturally switched to electric and acoustic guitars, piano and (for “Dance Tonight”) mandolin over the course of the next two hours. (No drums; some vintage footage of him on a kit during the “Get Back” sessions had to suffice there.) </p>\n<p>\n\tHe played only a little bit of lead guitar, but the fact that this is a band with three lead guitarists of course comes into play during the climactic “The End” when he, Ray and Anderson take turns playing elaborate variations on the solo bits that he, Lennon and Harrison played on the same stretch of “Abbey Road.” This is a reliable conceit of theirs, thrilling in the final moments, that still gives “three-ways” a good name.</p>\n<p>\n\tAt the outset, McCartney promised “some old songs, some new songs and some in-betweeners.” The “new songs” part was a bit of a misnomer; no, he was not about to offer a sneak preview of the album he’s apparently been working on in spurts with producer Andrew Watt since 2021, and the freshest solo song in the set was 207’s “Dance Tonight.” But technically, we would count as new the one number that post-dates his previous stop in these parts three years ago, the “final” Beatles song, “Now and Then.” The other Beatles were only spliced into this number on the big screen, not on audiotape — although, for the encore of “I’ve Got a Feeling,” he continues to bring in both audio and video of Lennon’s duet part. (Those of us who have  longed to hear McCartney take over the entire tune and be the one to sing “everybody had a wet dream” still just have to wait.)\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\tSpeaking of “I’ve Got a Feeling,” there is a moment in that great, great song that provides a sort of a test for McCartney: How long into his advanced years will he be able to sing that uppity bridge — <em>“All that I been lookin’ for was somebody who looked like you!”</em> — and still sound at least a little like Little Richard?</p>\n<p>\n\tThe answer, I’m happy to report, is that at 83, he has not rounded that bend. Fans, of course, will be looking for a report on the state of McCartney’s voice, just as they are before or after buying tickets for any of the rockers who are now out there doing it in their 80s, whether it’s the ones who were not belters per se but still are among the great idiosyncratic voices, like Paul Simon and Mick Jagger, or those whom we might worry about more, who <em>are</em> all-time howlers, like Roger Daltrey (whose farewell tour with the Who is also passing through SoCal this week). McCartney, of course, belongs in that latter camp — he’s got arguably the greatest rock ‘n’ roll voice of all time, and just for the sake of argument, let’s go ahead and say that’s inarguable.</p>\n<p>\n\tWould you believe me if I tell you he’s still got it? Granted, he had a few shaky moments near the beginning of the show, including in “Help!”; if I had just one wish for the show, it would’ve been that he would have come back around at the end and reprised it as a final encore, when he was completely warmed up and then some. Because McCartney completely came into his power over the course of the first few numbers, and unless you are the kind of nitpicker who is unable to make any allowance for the effects of age, there were few nits to pick with his performance Friday night. The suppleness of a tender reverie like “My Valentine” may not be 100% what it was to when he first recorded it, but it’s close enough for balladic rock ‘n’ roll. Certainly by the time he got to a solo acoustic “Blackbird,” he was in pitch-perfect form. And when it comes to the actual rockers, he is still going for it and seemingly holding almost nothing back, going screamo on us in “Helter Skelter” or engaging in fun little bits of falsetto melisma, not seeming or sounding at all like a guy who is worried he needs to be conservative with his voice.</p>\n<p>\n\tAll to say: his marvelous singing continues to be one of the wonders of the world, even without an 83-is-the-new-38 handicap, but especially taking that into account. (The act of dragging one’s sorry ass up the hundreds of steps required to reach the scenic heights of the Santa Barbara Bowl does give one time to consider decrepitude, or someone else’s lack of it.) Simply put: If you are one of the folks we occasionally encounter on the internet saying they won’t consider coming because they prefer to remember McCartney as he was (versus more defensible reasons, like distance or economics), then you, sir, may be the fool on the hill.\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\tHere’s one trivial question that may lead to a less trivial one: Does this count as a new tour, or is it the continuation of an ongoing one? It’s kind of both: The attendant publicity and McCartney himself have described it as a tour kickoff, yet the advertising and poster art still have it as the “Got Back” tour, which officially extends back to 2022. But he has adopted an off-again, on-again touring model that kind of renders this a moot point. He’s rather like Bob Dylan, in that way, who has been on his so-called “never ending tour” for decades now, putting batches of fresh dates on sale without making clear demarcations  between which “era” the concerts belong to. For both these artists, it’s not about the act of plugging, it’s about the joy of playing. And about hitting markets they have rarely or even never played before, as they spread their immortality around. </p>\n<p>\n\tTheir approaches couldn’t be more different, when it comes to on-stage personas: Dylan is acting his age, while McCartney is defying his. Either mindset is valid and has its own separate rewards for the audience and themselves.

Although the “One Battle After Another” star said he disagreed with “almost everything” Kirk believed in, he maintained that “we need” people like Kirk to promote open discussion on social issues.</p>\n<p>\n\t“We need that debate,” Penn said. “We’ve gotta fight it out and find a compromise. [Acts of political violence] do come into fashion, and the way we kill the fashion of it is people of conscience on both sides recognizing that if somebody really believes something, that’s your friend.”\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\tPenn added that the nation is in desperate need of mutual understanding across political lines, and that people need to start recognizing differing viewpoints as “valid opinions.”\n</p>\n<p>\n\t“I’m talking about if somebody believes that a human being starts at conception, if you can’t understand that concept, you’re just stupid,” Penn said. “And if you’re not willing to tolerate the concept as a concept that’s held as deeply as I may have a belief that, I don’t know, let the woman decide. All of these are valid opinions.”</p>\n<p>\n\tPenn is hardly the first in Hollywood to speak out about Kirk.

    "body": "<div><p>\n\tA group of prominent Nepali filmmakers has filed a formal complaint with the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences challenging the selection of “<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/anjila/\">Anjila</a>” as <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/nepal/\">Nepal</a>‘s Oscar submission, alleging procedural violations and conflicts of interest in the selection process. But the film’s director is firing back, claiming rivals offered up to $100,000 to unseat his movie.</p>\n<p>\n\tThe controversy centers on “Anjila,” a biographical drama about Anjila Tumbapo Subba, captain and goalkeeper of Nepal’s national women’s soccer team, with Subba playing herself in the lead role. The film follows her journey from being confined within her home to becoming team captain, showcasing her struggles against societal expectations and determination to excel in sports. \n\t</p>\n<p>\n\tIn a written statement provided to <em>Variety</em>, “Anjila” director Milan Chams dismisses the protest as “personal disappointment” and claims Samundra Bhatta, director of competing film “Gunyo Cholo,” offered up to $100,000 to get “Anjila” withdrawn from consideration while boasting about Academy connections through her executive producer.\n</p>\n<p>\n\t“She expressed complete confidence that her film would be selected, citing personal relationships with committee members,” Chams said. “The final decision came as a shock to her.”</p>\n<p>\n\tThe Academy declined to comment.</p>\n<p>\n\tThe controversy erupted when Nepal’s Oscar selection committee announced “Anjila” as the country’s International Feature submission on Sept. 5, following what critics say was a rigged nine-day application window <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/2025/politics/news/nepal-gen-z-mass-protests-social-media-ban-1236511575/\">during a national crisis</a> that included curfews and the Prime Minister’s resignation.\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\tAccording to the complaint, Jeevan Kumar Parajuli served as both a voting committee member and the media coordinator for “Anjila,” creating what the complainants describe as an obvious conflict of interest.</p>\n<p>\n\tThe selection committees for all countries are required to adhere to the rules and regulations of the international feature award to be eligible for submissions. However, selection committees can create their own process to determine their selection as long as it meets the requirements of the category. Committees are required to publish their film selection process. That process can be published on social media, a website or an announcement made through the media.</p>\n<p>\n\t“This is so unfair to Nepali filmmakers,” Ram Krishna Pokharel wrote on social media. “Not announcing the call for entries publicly but secretly selecting a film is not acceptable.”</p>\n<p>\n\tThe rebels, led by <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/deepak-rauniyar/\">Deepak Rauniyar</a> and Binod Paudel, fired off a scathing letter to the Academy demanding a full investigation and threatening to blow up Nepal’s Oscar dreams entirely.</p>\n<p>\n\tAccording to the rules and regulations for the 98th Oscars, all submissions, applications and materials for international feature must be submitted to the Academy by Oct. 1 at 5 p.m. PT. After the submission deadline, all entries are vetted to ensure they meet the eligibility requirements. The International Feature Film Executive Committee will address any issues and questions regarding eligibility in accordance with the award rules and selection committee guidelines.</p>\n<p>\n\tNoteworthy, the Academy does not intervene or dictate the processes and procedures of each country’s selection committee. When an established and approved selection committee meets the requirements of the category, the selection is considered to be in good standing.</p>\n<p>\n\tRauniyar’s “Pooja, Sir” premiered at Venice and has been collecting awards across the festival circuit. Bhatta’s “Gunyo Cholo,” executive produced by Rithy Panh, tackles transgender identity in Nepal. Paudel’s “Bhutan – The World’s Happiest Man” stars veteran Nepali actors alongside Hollywood veteran Bruce Dern. </p>\n<p>\n\tThe complaint alleges the selection committee operated in near-total secrecy, with international members allegedly not even watching all submitted films. The application window was slashed from the usual month-long period to just nine days, buried during a national crisis when many filmmakers were literally unable to access government offices due to civil unrest.\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\t“Many teams learned of the call only after closure,” the filmmakers wrote in their Academy complaint, seen by <em>Variety</em>.</p>\n<p>\n\tBut Chams isn’t backing down, claiming the real story is sour grapes from competitors who thought they had the fix in. “I am aware that there was dissatisfaction among a few filmmakers and their close circles. However, this appears to be driven more by personal interest than by objective critique,” he said in his statement.</p>\n<p>\n\t“She informed me that she and her Executive Producer were willing to pay up to $100,000 USD if necessary, and publicly stated both on her own Facebook wall and in a comment on my post – that she was ready to contribute NPR1,000,000 [$7,040] to secure the nomination,” Chams said.</p>\n<p>\n\tThe filmmakers are demanding Nepal restart the entire process with a transparent, 30-day application window and independent oversight – essentially asking the Academy to declare the current selection invalid.</p>\n<p>\n\t“This request concerns process, not the artistic merits of any single film,” the complaint states. </p>\n<div><p>\n\tThe Oscars will announce the official eligible submissions before the start of the preliminary voting.</p></div>\n</div>"

    "body": "<div><p>\n\tDivas collided at the Dolce & Gabbana Milan Fashion Week show on Sept. 27, as <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/meryl-streep/\">Meryl Streep</a>, reviving her character Miranda Priestly from 2006’s “<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/the-devil-wears-prada/\">The Devil Wears Prada</a>,” met up with real-life Vogue editor <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/anna-wintour/\">Anna Wintour</a> backstage. Wintour, who served as Vogue’s lead fashion editor from 1988 to 2025, was the supposed inspiration for Streep’s mercilessly powerful, yet impeccably elegant Priestly, who runs the fictional fashion magazine Runway in the film. \n\t</p>\n<p>\n\tBoth donning their iconic dark sunglasses at the indoor event, the pair shared a hug and a laugh backstage. A video posted on <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/reel/DPHEqUnjouI/?igsh=NTc4MTIwNjQ2YQ%3D%3D\" target=\"_blank\">Vogue’s Instagram shows</a> the two rubbing shoulders, catching up, and Streep, clearly breaking character, admitting, “This is my first fashion show.” The video also shows Wintour chatting with Streep’s co-star, Stanley Tucci, who played fashion correspondent Nigel Kipling in the 2006 film, and Simone Ashley, who is set to appear alongside Streep and Tucci in “<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/the-devil-wears-prada-2/\">The Devil Wears Prada 2</a>” next year.\n</p>\n<p>\n\t“The Devil Wears Prada 2” will be a direct sequel to the original movie. In addition to Streep, Tucci and Ashley, the film will see the returns of Anne Hathaway as Andy Sachs, Emily Blunt as Emily Charlton, Tibor Feldman as Irv Ravitz and Tracie Thoms as Lily. Kennith Bragah joins the cast as Priestly’s husband alongside fellow franchise newcomers Lucy Liu, Justin Theroux, B.J. Novak and Pauline Chalamet. David Frankel and Aline Brosh McKenna return as director and screenwriter, respectively. 20th Century Studios will release the film in May 2026, nearly twenty years after the original’s release.\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\tStreep, Tucci and Ashley sat side-by-side in the front row at the event’s spring 2026 collection runway show, each dressed head-to-toe in Dolce & Gabbana. Streep wore a vinyl trench coat from the SS25 runway collection, with a lamé animalier shirt, slim-fit trousers, a leopard print belt, a leopard print faux fur Marlene clutch and green pumps. Tucci sported a deconstructed single-breasted Galles wool suit with a black cotton shirt and a leopard print chiffon foulard, while Ashley wore a tulle corset with satin cups and satin boning detail above a crystal mesh skirt from the FW24-25 runway, a collection of satin corset-style culottes with the DG logo and patent leather pumps. She carried a black leather MySicily handbag. All three put on the serious demeanors of their fashion-savvy characters for the show’s duration.</p>\n</div>"

    "body": "<div><p>\n\t<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/warner-bros/\">Warner Bros.</a>‘ “<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/one-battle-after-another/\">One Battle After Another</a>” took $8.8 million across Friday and previews from 3,634 locations in North America. That haul includes grosses from advance fan-first screenings on Tuesday, which played premium large-format auditoriums. </p>\n<p>\n\tThe studio didn’t pinch on pennies for <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/paul-thomas-anderson/\">Paul Thomas Anderson</a> and <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/leonardo-dicaprio/\">Leonardo DiCaprio</a>‘s hyper-contemporary action epic, spending more than $130 million before a global marketing campaign. To the director’s credit, Anderson delivered the goods. “One Battle After Another” already has the stature of a modern classic among critics, instantly positioning itself as an awards season heavyweight. On top of that, it’s playing like a crowdpleaser, with moviegoer survey firm CinemaScore polling a superb “A” grade. Compare that the “C” grade that Anderson’s now beloved “Boogie Nights” was dealt in 1997. It’s also DiCaprio’s highest score from the service since “Titanic” landed an “A+” in that same year.\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\tAll that prestige hype matches the film’s uniquely ornate theatrical rollout, which includes Imax and other premium large-formats. There are also showings on 70mm, Imax 70mm and even four venues projecting in the long-dormant format VistaVision, which Anderson shot the film on. Each of those options comes with luxury ticket prices, boosting grosses.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tFor now, “One Battle” is on pace to land within pre-weekend tracking for an opening between $20 million and $25 million. Best case is glowing reviews and great buzz buoy the film’s relevance among moviegoers for one week after another. But with a light debut, “One Battle” has to string together a word-of-mouth phenomenon, plus a significant overseas draw, to turn a profit in theaters.\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\tAt least it won’t take much for the film to finish as the biggest theatrical release ever for Anderson, who showed awareness with a crack about being “box-office challenged” in an August interview <a href=\"https://www.esquire.com/entertainment/movies/a65619469/leonardo-dicaprio-paul-thomas-anderson-interview-2025/\" target=\"_blank\">at Esquire</a>. The writer-director’s top hit ever is his 2007 critical darling “There Will Be Blood,” which finished with $40 million domestic and $76 million worldwide. For Warner Bros., the studio is coming off seven consecutive films opening above $40 million domestic — <a href=\"https://variety.com/2025/film/box-office/one-battle-after-another-leonardo-dicaprio-box-office-opening-weekend-projection-1236526905/\" target=\"_blank\">a historic first in Hollywood</a>. “One Battle” comes as a box office heat check, with significant costs.</p>\n<p>\n\tIn a true contrast of counter-programming, Universal is opening the G-rated “Gabby’s Dollhouse: The Movie” in 3,500 locations, eyeing a second place debut after earning $4.3 million across Friday and previews. Projections are now at a $13.6 million opening, landing between pre-weekend tracking for $12 million to $15 million. The DreamWorks Animation production is looking for a theatrical hit in adapting the popular animated pre-K Netflix series “Gabby’s Dollhouse,” which has racked up 11 seasons since debuting in 2021. The big-screen version, which blends live-action and animation elements, cost $32 million to produce. It’ll want to stick around in theaters, though it’s playing great for its audience, with an “A+” grade from CinemaScore.</p>\n<p>\n\tAlso opening this weekend, Lionsgate is bowing “The Strangers: Chapter II,” the middle entry in what is supposed to be a contained, Renny Harlin-directed trilogy for the horror property. The home invasion continuation earned $2.4 million across Friday and previews from 2,690 locations, with projections for the three-day opening now around $5.6 million. That’d be less than half of the $11.8 million debut that “The Strangers: Chapter I” earned back in May 2024. </p>\n<p>\n\tThe first installment wasn’t a hit with critics and reviews are just as bad for the follow-up, even after a producer told <a href=\"https://screenrant.com/the-strangers-2-3-enhacement-shoots-after-chapter-1/\" target=\"_blank\">ScreenRant</a> that the sequel did significant “enhancement” reshoots after the release of “Chapter I.” Audiences aren’t impressed either, with Cinema Score turning in a rough “C-” grade. Still, the film cost a light $8.5 million to produce. Lionsgate has plans to release “Chapter III” sometime down the line.</p>\n<p>\n\tAfter topping domestic charts for two weekends, Sony and Crunchyroll’s “Demon Slayer: Kimetsu no Yaiba Infinity Castle” is sliding to third place after earning another $1.8 million on Friday. It’s looking at a $6.8 million third weekend, down 61%. These grosses are largely a cherry on top for “Infinity Castle” after its historic fan-driven opening weekend. The epic-length film is looking to hit a $117.8 million domestic total through Sunday, currently ranking as the 15th-highest grossing North American release of 2025 — a stature that seemed unthinkable for an anime film for decades.\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\tWarner Bros. is also vying for bronze, with “The Conjuring: Last Rites,” which cast out<strong> </strong>another $2 million on Friday, down 46% from its daily total a week ago. The New Line horror sequel looks to hit $161 million through its fourth weekend of release — a terrific result against its $55 million price tag. While “Last Rites” marketed itself as the final chapter for paranormal investigators Ed and Lorraine Warren, it’s difficult to imagine the property is finished after delivering its biggest theatrical hit ever.</p>\n<p>\n\tAlso of note, Universal’s football horror film “Him” is losing a lot of ground in its sophomore outing, plummeting hard with a projected 71% drop after bad reviews. It looks to hit a $20.9 million domestic total through its second weekend — a less-than-desirable result against a $27 million production budget. Sony’s “A Big Bold Beautiful Journey” is fading fast too, eyeing a $1.2 million sophomore outing after cratering in its opening. The projected 10-day domestic haul is $5.9 million for the $45 million project.</p>\n</div>"

    "body": "<div><p>\n\tAll <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/paul-thomas-anderson/\">Paul Thomas Anderson</a> movies are layered with fascinating characters and distinctive looks, but “<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/one-battle-after-another/\">One Battle After Another</a>” might be the most ambitious of them all in terms of its massive scope. The movie races across the desert east of San Diego, down to the Tijuana border and into the NorCal redwoods as Sean Penn’s whacked-out Col Steven J. Lockjaw pursues <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/leonardo-dicaprio/\">Leonardo DiCaprio</a>‘s depressed stoner Bob and his radiant teenage daughter Willa, played by Chase Infiniti.\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\tPulling together all these locations and settings was no small feat, production designer <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/florencia-martin/\">Florencia Martin</a> tells <em>Variety</em>. For Anderson’s last movie, “Licorice Pizza,” Martin meticulously reproduced the streetscapes, homes and restaurants of the 1970s San Fernando Valley. But “One Battle After Another” was an epic of another magnitude — set in the sort-of present day, but occupying a reality all its own.</p>\n<p>\n\tAnderson had been mulling the project for years, but research for locations started just before the Coivd pandemic, with serious scouting beginning in 2022.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tIn Thomas Pynchon’s novel “Vineland,” on which “One Battle After Another” <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/2025/film/news/one-battle-after-another-changes-vineland-1236527544/\">was loosely based</a>, the revolutionary group based on the Weather Underground flees to Humboldt County in the far north of California. So the scouting trip started up north in Eureka. </p>\n<p>\n\t“That was the way we approached finding this film,” Martin says. “We’d go to all these inland neighborhoods like Sacramento, Stockton, Fresno. It really is like a tapestry of California to me – a California that we don’t really know.”</p>\n<p>\n\tThe big-budget production filmed in at least nine counties in California, at L.A. Center Studios and in El Paso, Texas, with help from $8.4 million in California production subsidies. But the locations weren’t the typical coastal sights of the Golden State — instead, the Sacramento rail yards, the Tijuana border crossing at Otay Mesa and the undulating hills of the Anza-Borrego desert are some of the places that make “One Battle” completely distinctive from other California-set films.\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\tWhen the film jumps forward 16 years, viewers might wonder if it’s 16 years in the future — or if the early scenes are in fact 16 years in the past. But Anderson keeps things a bit mysterious.</p>\n<p>\n\t“We’re not trying to say this is a story that takes place today, but this is a story that is happening in present time,” Martin says cryptically.</p>\n<p>\n\tViewers will also have to use their imagination to visualize the central fictional city of Baktan Cross, which is a combination of Eureka and El Paso. The dramatic dance scene was filmed at Eureka High School, with actual students as background actors, while Sacramento’s Reagan Mansion was, fittingly, the headquarters for the nefarious Christmas Adventurer’s Club.</p>\n<p>\n\tCreating the technology for revolutionaries operating in an amorphous present, such as the scanner device, was another fascinating challenge. “That was very fun, a long process to get to the scanners and how this group works,” Martin explains. “It was just looking at 3G networks and ham radios and satellite and how would people communicate given a circumstance like this — and also a little bit of fantasy too, with this trust device. And how a mad scientist like Howard Sommerville would create something that is this specific — it’s already old.”</p>\n<p>\n\tMartin spoke to <em>Variety</em> to break down how some of the most arresting scenes in “One Battle After Another” were created.</p>\n<div>\n<figure>\n<p><img srcset=\"https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Screenshot-2025-09-26-at-3.08.06 https://variety.com/2025/film/features/one-battle-after-another-car-chase-location-breakdown-1236529697/PM.jpg 1280w, https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Screenshot-2025-09-26-at-3.08.06 https://variety.com/2025/film/features/one-battle-after-another-car-chase-location-breakdown-1236529697/PM.jpg?resize=150,94 150w, https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Screenshot-2025-09-26-at-3.08.06 https://variety.com/2025/film/features/one-battle-after-another-car-chase-location-breakdown-1236529697/PM.jpg?resize=300,188 300w\" src=\"https://variety.com/wp-content/themes/pmc-variety-2020/assets/public/lazyload-fallback.gif\" alt=\"\" />\n\t</p>\n<figcaption>\n\t\t\t\t\t<span>Over the years, Bob’s character got into plants and crystals at his funky hideout near Baktan Cross.</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tWarner Bros.\n\t</figcaption>\n</figure>\n</div>\n\t<h3>\n\t\tBob and Willa’s House\t</h3>\n<p>\n\t“Bob has evolved from his politics, and now is like a hermit,” Martin says. “We ended up in a single bedroom house that was engulfed by redwoods.” The tunnel that leads to the outhouse was up the street, and the property the team found where the tunnel comes out was like “a theme park of tiny cars all engulfed with moss,” Martin marvels. “We built the redwood outhouse amongst those cars in the backyard, as if that’s also one of Bob’s hobbies.”</p>\n<p>\n\tAfter Willa’s bedroom was built onto the small house, the cottage was dressed to show the accumulation of the years the father and daughter had lived there. “It’s that sense of someone who found a little sanctuary and a little privacy and got really settled in,” Martin says. “We had a lot of artwork from Paul’s kids and our set decorator, Anthony Carlino, and Willa — Chase Infiniti — gave us her photos of when she was a baby. We made certificates from elementary school and middle school. And she has all her karate trophies. And the calendar from Sensei, which becomes a clue of trying to find her.”\n\t</p>\n<div>\n<figure>\n<p><img srcset=\"https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/OBAA-screenshot-5.jpg 1280w, https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/OBAA-screenshot-5.jpg?resize=150,94 150w, https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/OBAA-screenshot-5.jpg?resize=300,188 300w\" src=\"https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/OBAA-screenshot-5.jpg?w=1024\" alt=\"\" />\n\t</p>\n<figcaption>\n\t\t\t\t\t<span>El Paso’s Genesis Perfumeria provided the perfect entry to Sensei’s labyrinth apartment that sheltered migrants.</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tWarner Bros.\n\t</figcaption>\n</figure>\n</div>\n\t<h3>\n\t\tSensei’s ‘underground railroad’ apartment\t</h3>\n<p>\n\tThough much of “One Battle” was shot up and down the length of California, El Paso also provided an important setting with its historic architecture and selection of Latino businesses. Benicio del Toro’s Sensei oversees a sprawling apartment building that harbors refugees. Anderson’s camera travels through the warren of living spaces, richly layered with the objects of family life.</p>\n<p>\n\t“With the local location scout, Jacob Cena, we started getting access to all these rooftops and stores,” Martin explains. “When we went to the Genesis Perfumeria (where Benicio del Toro’s wife works in the film) we just saw this incredible fluorescent green interior with thousands of perfume bottles. They have these stairs that led upstairs. That’s how his story started to grow. And we were very fortunate that the second floor of that entire block was empty. So I built Sensei’s apartment with my team practically on the second floor.</p>\n<p>\n\t“That is one of my favorite sets I’ve ever been a part of, and I worked very closely with Anthony Carlino, our set decorator,” Martin says. “We gave a story to each of these family members, and then worked with Cassandra (Kulukundis) on the casting of which type of family lives here, which type of family lives there.”</p>\n<div>\n<figure>\n<p><img srcset=\"https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/OBAA-screenshot2.jpg 1280w, https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/OBAA-screenshot2.jpg?resize=150,94 150w, https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/OBAA-screenshot2.jpg?resize=300,188 300w\" src=\"https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/OBAA-screenshot2.jpg?w=1024\" alt=\"\" />\n\t</p>\n<figcaption>\n\t\t\t\t\t<span>Willa meets Col.

Those experts included the Sisters of the Valley, an actual group of non-religious “weed nuns” based in Merced, Calif. who helped inform the idea for the compound belonging to the movie’s Sisters of the Brave Beaver. </p>\n<p>\n\t“You don’t really see it, but they actually had a really big marijuana growing section to the convent,” Martin says of the concept behind the hideout.</p>\n<p>\n\tThe Sisters’ convent was filmed at La Purisima Mission in Lompoc, north of Santa Barbara, now a public park. Martin explains that Anderson had an image of where he wanted to shoot, but it was hard to track down the site. “We went to about six missions along the Camino Real mission trail. Paul had a beautiful photograph or painting of a dilapidated mission set against the hills with this church and we couldn’t find it,” she recalled. And most of the missions looked too perfect. “It was one of the most challenging set pieces, because California has done a magnificent job at restoring all these missions.\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\t“La Purisima was the most stripped away, the closest to being a believable space that these women would have found in the secluded hills and taken it over, initially as a sanctuary place to welcome people, and then now it’s a monetized situation. Their story is they no longer harbor people. They have to make money, living together as a group of women.”</p>\n<p>\n\tAnderson envisioned the scene where Penn’s Lockjaw does his paternity test with Willa as taking place in a chapel, so La Purisima’s sanctuary provided the perfect backdrop for his perverse quest.</p>\n<div>\n<figure>\n<p><img srcset=\"https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/OBAA-screenshot-4.jpg 1280w, https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/OBAA-screenshot-4.jpg?resize=150,94 150w, https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/OBAA-screenshot-4.jpg?resize=300,188 300w\" src=\"https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/OBAA-screenshot-4.jpg?w=1024\" alt=\"\" />\n\t</p>\n<figcaption>\n\t\t\t\t\t<span>Paul Thomas Anderson, right, shooting near the detention camp</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tWarner Bros.\n\t</figcaption>\n</figure>\n</div>\n\t<h3>\n\t\tThe border detention camps\t</h3>\n<p>\n\tMartin consulted contemporary and historic photos of border camps to design the chilling compounds where children and families are held in chain-link fencing pens. The crew also worked with a military advisor. “I spoke to a lot of people in the military and who had been deployed,” Martin says.</p>\n<p>\n\t“It’s a temporary camp in the beginning of the film. They’re set up to detain people, and they’re not fully organized yet. The idea in the beginning, which is based on a real happening, was that they were detaining people under overpasses, which our location manager, Michael Glaser, had the challenge of finding. He found the most incredible spot that allowed us to create this camp right next to the border wall. We would have Border Patrol and immigrants crossing in as we were shooting.”</p>\n<p>\n\t“It’s a very sensitive subject and heartbreaking seeing the way that these families are split up and children are detained, so we just tried to be really respectful to what these processes were and not make up our own interpretation of it, but really look at how these detention centers are run and laid out,” says Martin.</p>\n<div>\n<figure>\n<p><img srcset=\"https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/OBAA-screenshot3.jpg 1280w, https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/OBAA-screenshot3.jpg?resize=150,94 150w, https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/OBAA-screenshot3.jpg?resize=300,188 300w\" src=\"https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/OBAA-screenshot3.jpg?w=1024\" alt=\"\" />\n\t</p>\n<figcaption>\n\t\t\t\t\t<span>The crew referred to the desert roads near the Texas Dip as “the river of hills.”</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tWarner Bros.\n\t</figcaption>\n</figure>\n</div>\n\t<h3>\n\t\tThe car chase\t</h3>\n<p>\n\tReturning from scouting in Blythe near the Arizona border, Martin came across what would become the epic setting of the chase scene. “We were going back to Borrego Springs, and we all got on this road and instantly felt how special and magnetic and unique it was, to suddenly be dipping up and down through these hills. So then I studied the landscape all through Borrego Springs and Anza Borrego and pieced together the sequence,” she says.\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\t“The road where Lockjaw drops Avanti off is in Ocotillo Wells. And that road that connects you from Ocotillo to Borrego Springs became Lockjaw’s road. And then that car flipping is in Borrego Springs. It’s a lot of studying of the architecture of the road, and working really closely with Paul and (cinematographer) Mike Bauman on time of day and directionality. Then the most satisfying one is the car chase at the end, in the <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=upZBXDN0Up4\" target=\"_blank\">Texas Dip</a>, which is in Borrego Springs, which is this huge dip down and back up, and that just seemed like the way to punctuate this moment.</p>\n<p>\n\t“We call it the river of hills, that highway. Paul is someone who likes to do a lot of camera tests, so you try to come in with everything, with as much as information and planning as you can, but also leaving some room  to explore,” Martin says. </p>\n<p>\n\tMartin cut her teeth in the art department for “Mad Men,” which famously made use of L.A.’s mid-century landmarks to stand in for New York, so she’s long had a close connection to shooting locally. </p>\n<p>\n\tBut “One Battle After Another” was her biggest undertaking yet. “This was, bar none, the most extensive scouting away from home that I’ve done,” Martin says, “getting the chance to explore California like this and really connect to the community.” </p>\n<p>\n\t“The biggest thing too, is to be able to continue to film in California and work with my team, who I think, are all best in the business,” says Martin, “I just hope that we can continue that, right?” </p>\n</div>"
