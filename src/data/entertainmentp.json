    "body": "<div><p>\n\tTo wrap this year’s Creative Investors’ Conference at the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/san-sebastian-film-festival-2/\">San Sebastián Film Festival</a>, four leading executives working within or frequently with the U.S. gathered to discuss some of the new ways of working emerging in the market and how to move the industry forward.  </p>\n<p>\n\tWhen it comes to the advantages and key differences between the U.S. and European markets, Anton CEO Sébastien Raybaud said the one key thing that shifted the power balance between the two is that now Europe has access to capital market. This reality was not even remotely possible 15 years ago. “Now we have capital market access with a lot of funds in Europe. We also have powerhouses with access to many talented producers.” Alas, the one thing Europe is still lacking in comparison to its North American counterpart is scale, with European projects not yet landing major franchises, globally relevant IP and recurrent mega-budget productions. \n\t</p>\n<p>\n\tBut there is also a downside to the American rule of bigger is better, said Killer Films founder and veteran producer <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/christine-vachon/\">Christine Vachon</a>. “An extremely American thing is to grow your company as much as you can and then sell it,” she continued. “We were a little bit on that trajectory. It’s the capitalist system. Then, at a certain point, we realised we didn’t want to grow our company. We wanted to keep it as small as possible, hire young people who would understand the upper mobility in our company was really limited, but who would bring a fresh perspective.” \n</p>\n<p>\n\tMany such people, Vachon is proud to say, are “more successful” than Killer Films now, but the producer doesn’t regret her strategy. “It has kept the company something we can completely control. Am I the richest of my colleagues? Absolutely not. But I’m leading a creative and professional life that is pretty much exactly what I want.”\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\tAlthough tax credit is scarce and the process is lengthy and convoluted, Vachon said the U.S. model offers the key advantage of forcing filmmakers to engage with their audiences. “Sometimes in Europe, filmmakers don’t, and the films reflect that. The system helps create a creative base for the kinds of films we want to make.” As for the idea that a label like Killer Films doesn’t produce “commercial films,” Vachon pointed out that “a commercial film is a movie that makes its money back. If you make a movie for the right price and market it to the right audience and it can be a really niche audience, it can make its money back.”</p>\n<p>\n\tRobert Walak, head of film & TV at Iconoclast, offered yet another reason to be positive about the U.S. market: New distributors are launching, such as Row K Ent. which made its third deal at Toronto announced a couple of days ago, buying the “Cliffhanger” reboot for a reported seven-digit sum.. “We haven’t had that for a while,” he said, without making reference to any company in particular. In general, however, “for the last few years, we’ve been wondering who was going to step in, and it’s hugely encouraging seeing how the pendulum has swung back to features and the theatrical experience.”</p>\n<div>\n<figure>\n<p><img srcset=\"https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/IMG_7831.jpg 4032w, https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/IMG_7831.jpg?resize=150,113 150w, https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/IMG_7831.jpg?resize=300,225 300w\" src=\"https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/IMG_7831.jpg?w=1024\" alt=\"\" />\n\t</p>\n<figcaption>\n\t\t\t\t\t<span>Courtesy of Rafa Sales Ross</span>\n\t</figcaption>\n</figure>\n</div>\n<p>\n\tAnother key talking point during the conversation was the increased number of partnerships between production companies and major fashion labels. Saint Laurent (<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/ysl/\">YSL</a>) has even created a subsidiary, Saint Laurent Productions, to work on film projects, which include Jim Jarmusch’s recent Golden Lion winner “Father Mother Sister Brother,” Pedro Almodóvar’s “Strange Way of Life” and Jacques Audiard’s “Emilia Pérez.” </p>\n<p>\n\tAsked whether she would partner with a fashion label, Vachon said she is “pretty agnostic.” “You want to give us money, we’ll take your money. We work with directors who understand the ecosystem they’re working with and also understand that if there is an opportunity where desires can collide in a positive way, there’s no reason not to pursue that.”</p>\n<p>\n\tVachon even posed the question of whether working with major brands is all that different from banking on cash rebates that stipulate certain creative conditions, such as having heads of department who come from the countries providing the relief. “Those kinds of compromises are simply part of how we make those movies work and how we get as many resources as possible,” she added. “The filmmaker and I have to figure out that one can work and that one can’t. If you’re going to work with YSL, which we have explored, we haven’t come to a project with them or another fashion brand yet, but we probably will at some point.”\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\tWalak echoed that thought, stating that while in the past these partnerships used to focus mainly on product placement, they are now a matter of “creative alignment.” “It is about a brand that wants to be associated with a director or certain themes. Now they can reach their demographic in a way that is not aggressive, that is not uglily branded with all their logos there. It’s much more about a careful alignment.” To the exec, this is a positive sign that there are more stakeholders interested in entering the film business. “It all goes back to this idea of [a creative] community.”</p>\n</div>"

    "body": "<div><p>\n\tThe jump is filmed in such chilly long shot that you very nearly wouldn’t notice it happening, if not for the brilliant aquamarine overcoat of the jumper, hurling herself from a busy pedestrian bridge in wintry Geneva, dropping like a luminous pin into the freezing Rhône waters below. She is Lina (Isabel Aimé González Sola), a gifted Argentine fashion designer in town to receive an award that means nothing to her. In the opening minutes of <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/milagros-mumenthaler/\">Milagros Mumenthaler</a>‘s airily elliptical character study “<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/the-currents/\">The Currents</a>,” we’ve already seen her toss the glass tchotchke in the bathroom trash and slip out of the ceremony to pace the streets, before attempting suicide in such a sudden, fluid movement, you wonder if it’s a passing whim.\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\tNothing initially makes much sense in “The Currents,” and Mugenthaler — a distinctively talented Swiss-Argentine filmmaker who won the top prize at Locarno with her 2011 debut “Back to Stay” — is in no great hurry to make clear, transparent order of her heroine’s flailing, fragmented state of mind. Lina, after all, hasn’t figured herself out, and this patient, intuitive, arrestingly styled film prefers not to be several steps of its protagonist, often assuming her point of view on a world that has slipped out of alignment with her expectations, and with others’ expectations of her. \n</p>\n<p>\n\tThe result is both fascinating and intractable, an entry in cinema’s rich tradition of deconstructed feminine portraiture that skids ambitiously along a tonal and stylistic spectrum between Hitchcock’s “Marnie” and Todd Haynes’s “Safe.” Not all of Mugenthaler’s sideways turns yield satisfying discoveries, and “The Currents” gets less interesting when it seeks out tidier interior motivations toward its third act. But this is impressively composed, searching high-art cinema, elevated by its meticulous, silkily textured formal construction, and likely to be the most widely distributed of its helmer’s three features to date following its premiere in Toronto’s Platform competition, with further festival appointments in San Sebastian, Busan and the main New York slate.\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\tWe don’t see Lina rescued from the water — just a shot of her briskly entering the lobby of her luxury hotel in a foil emergency blanket — and when she returns to her comfortable apartment in Buenos Aires, where her handsome hotshot husband Pedro (Esteban Bigliardi) and adorable five-year-old daughter Sofia (Emma Fayo Duarte) are waiting for her, it’s as if the whole cryptic incident never happened at all. Save for one key after-effect: Now stricken with an extreme fear of water, Lina does her best to avoid bathing, feigning wellness as her skin breaks out in assorted rashes, and her lustrous mane of hair turns lank and greasy. </p>\n<p>\n\tConsider it a less enigmatic, more self-inflicted version of the eerie environmental allergy that plagues Julianne Moore’s similarly picture-perfect wife and mother in “Safe” — and likewise plays on Lina’s frayed nerves, exposing manifold insecurities and a debilitatingly heightened sensory perception of every space she’s in, as well as some she’s not. Intricately layered, selectively amplified sound design  (sometimes merged with lush, lapping intrusions of classical music) of living wholly in your own head at some points, and dissociatively out of it at others, to the point where Lina begins seeing herself from a distance, an identical stranger through a glass store window. It’s a fleeting, noir-ish detail that follows through on the sinister languor of the film’s pacing, and the uncannily smooth textures and rich oil-paint accents of DP Gabriel Sandru’s lensing — briefly suggesting a reality cracked in two.</p>\n<p>\n\tLina’s hydrophobia, then, isn’t the focus of “The Currents,” but one of many colliding conditions bringing her inner life to a disconcerting standstill, as her perplexed husband, frustrated daughter and other, less attentive friends and associates look on from the psychologically distant sidelines. The longer we spend in her opaque but vulnerable company — González Sola’s performance consistently favors unnerving, hairline-fractured serenity over jittery, unhinged tics — the more we sense there’s no great mystery to be unpacked here, just a woman falling behind the beat of a life at once privileged and heavily burdened with domestic, social and professional obligations. (In one lovely, piercing scene, Sofia’s dinner-time observation that Lina never cooks meals like her friends’ mothers do is both innocent and ruthless.)\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\tSo it’s a slight shame that, in a subplot that sees Lina delving into her own shuttered family history, Mugenthaler’s script somewhat over-explains personal baggage that has already become glimmeringly implicit. “The Currents” is most exciting when it leaves its audience to float in uncertainty, or in oblique side streams — as in one gorgeous, disorienting sequence where, from the lighthouse-like summit of her apartment building, Lina appears to gain some manner of second sight, omnisciently observing the private routines of other women in her orbit, and for a moment living more peacefully through them. </p>\n</div>"

    "body": "<div><p>\n\t<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/jennifer-lawrence/\">Jennifer Lawrence</a> spoke up for Palestine at a <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/san-sebastian-film-festival/\">San Sebastian Film Festival</a> press conference on Friday, saying what’s happening in Gaza is “no less than a genocide.”</p>\n<p>\n\tThe Oscar winner, who is on hand at the festival to screen her new film “<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/die-my-love/\">Die My Love</a>” and receive the prestigious Donostia Award, was asked several times to comment on the war in Gaza during the presser. Though festival moderators attempted to stop the questions, Lawrence eloquently gave her opinion on the matter toward the end of the conference.\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\t“I’m terrified and it’s mortifying. What’s happening is no less than a genocide and it’s unacceptable,” she said when asked about Palestine. “I’m terrified for my children, for all of our children.”\n</p>\n<p>\n\tShe then spoke about American politics, saying that it makes her “so sad” that the current “disrespect and discourse” is going to be the status quo for children growing up in the U.S. today.</p>\n<p>\n\t“I mean, the kids who are voting right now at 18, it’s going to be totally normal to them that politics has no integrity. Politicians lie, there is no empathy,” she said. “And everybody needs to remember that when you ignore what’s happening on one side of the world, it won’t be long until it’s on your side as well.”</p>\n<p>\n\tHowever, Lawrence also reminded the room of journalists that the onus shouldn’t be on artists to fix the world’s political problems. “I wish that there was something I could say, something that I could do to fix this extremely complex and disgraceful situation. It breaks my heart,” she said. “But the reality is, our fear in speaking too much or answering too many of these questions is that my words will just be used to add more fire and rhetoric to something that is in the hands of our elected officials.”\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\tShe continued: “I just want people to stay focused on who is responsible and the things that they can do and when they need to show up and vote, and not let the actors and the artists who are trying to express freedom of art, freedom of speech take the heat for the individuals that are actually responsible.”</p>\n<p>\n\tEarlier in the conference, Lawrence acknowledged that America’s “freedom of speech and freedom of expression is under attack,” making film festivals an even more sacred space.</p>\n<p>\n\t“We can see each other’s stories and connect and learn from each other, and more importantly realize that we are all connected and we all matter and deserve empathy and freedom,” she said. </p>\n<p>\n\t“Die My Love” will premiere at San Sebastian on Friday night. It follows Grace (Lawrence), a new mother whose deteriorating mental health sends her relationship with Jackson (Robert Pattinson) into unsettling territory. The film premiered at Cannes Film Festival in May, earning a <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/2025/film/news/jennifer-lawrence-cannes-die-my-love-premiere-robert-pattinson-1236388352/\">six-minute standing ovation</a> and praise for Lawrence’s fearless performance. During the fest, the film was <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/2025/film/global/mubi-jennifer-lawrence-robert-pattinson-die-my-love-1236402473/\">purchased by Mubi</a> in a huge $24 million deal. </p>\n<p>\n\tIn <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/2025/film/reviews/die-my-love-review-jennifer-lawrence-robert-pattinson-1236401527/\"><em>Variety</em>‘s review</a> of “Die My Love,” chief film critic Owen Gleiberman wrote that Lawrence’s performance “feels so explosive but, at the same time, so emotionally reined in … You feel the power of her presence, the hellbent quality of her rage. When it comes to chewing out a blabby cashier, crawling around like an animal, trashing the bathroom and pouring soap products all over the floor, or bashing her head on a mirror, she’s an ace wastrel.”</p>\n</div>"

Two weeks of laughter in the desert, don’t miss it!’” he said in a video. “I mean, the same guy that’s gonna pay them is the same guy that paid that guy to bone-saw Jamal Khashoggi and put him in a fucking suitcase. But don’t let that stop the yucks, it’s gonna be a good time!”</p>\n<p>\n\tHuman Rights Watch noted that U.S. stand-up comedian and podcaster Tim Dillon on his August 30 podcast said: “I am doing this because they are paying me a large sum of money.” Dillon on the podcast said the Saudi festival was paying him $375,000 for the one show on Oct. 8 and that other performers were offered as much as $1.6 million. “They bought comedy,” Dillon added. “Do I have issues with the policies towards freedom of speech? Of course I do, but I believe in my own financial well-being,” he added.\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\tInterestingly, as Human Rights Watch reported,on Sept. 20, Dillon announced that his performance had been canceled after Saudi authorities were allegedly “unhappy” about his comedic remarks on the treatment of migrant workers and other human rights issues. “I addressed it in a funny way and they fired me,” he said.</p>\n<p>\n\tAnother U.S. comedian, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/shane-gillis/\">Shane Gillis</a>, said on his Secret Podcast that he turned down a “significant bag” for an appearance at the festival, even after they doubled their offer. “I took a principled stand. You don’t 9/11 your friends,” he said.</p>\n<p>\n\tHuman Rights Watch pointed out that Jimmy Carr, who is co-headlining the festival on Oct. 6, does not list his appearance in Saudi Arabia on his website or on his social media. </p>\n<p>\n\tOther U.S. comedy stars reportedly set to appear at the Riyadh Comedy Festival include Bill Burr, Kevin Hart, Pete Davidson, Russell Peters, Gabriel Iglesias, Dave Chappelle and Louis C.K.</p>\n</div>"

We cannot wait for cinema goers all over the world to get the chance to discover <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/ildiko-enyedi-2/\">Ildiko Enyedi</a>‘s latest film, which is a playful and timely film questioning our relationship with nature.”</p>\n<p>\n\tAs well as the FIPRESCI Prize from the International Federation of Film Critics and the Marcello Mastroianni Award for best new talent for Luna Wedler, the film won the Interfilm Award for Promoting Interreligious Dialogue, the Green Drop Award, the CinemaSara Prize and the Edipo Re Inclusion and Sustainability Award.\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\t“Silent Friend,” which stars Tony Leung Chiu-Wai, Luna Wedler, Enzo Brumm, Sylvester Groth and Léa Seydoux, centers on a majestic ginkgo tree in a botanical garden in a medieval university town in Germany.</p>\n<p>\n\tThis silent witness has observed over a century the quiet rhythms of transformation across three human lives.</p>\n<p>\n\tIn 2020, a neuroscientist from Hong Kong, exploring the mind of babies, begins an unexpected experiment with the old tree. In 1972, a young student is profoundly changed by the simple act of observing and connecting with a geranium. In 1908, the university’s first female student discovers, through the lens of photography, sacred patterns of the universe hidden within the humblest of plants.</p>\n<p>\n\tWe follow their clumsy, awkward attempts to connect — each one of them deeply rooted in their own present — as they are transformed by the quiet, enduring, and mysterious power of nature. The ancient ginkgo tree brings us closer to what it means to be human — to our longing to belong.</p>\n</div>"
