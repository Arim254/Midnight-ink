    "body": "<div><p>\n\t<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/jimmy-fallon/\">Jimmy Fallon</a> plans to keep “<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/the-tonight-show/\">The Tonight Show</a>” out of politics.</p>\n<p>\n\tDuring a recent interview with CNBC’s “<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QmsP_qBBz_Q\" target=\"_blank\">Squawk on the Street,</a>” the late-night frontman said his show has “never really been political,” and he plans to keep it that way.</p>\n<p>\n\t“We hit both sides equally, and we try to make everybody laugh, and that’s really the way our show works,” Fallon said. “Our monologues are kind of the same that we’ve been doing since Johnny Carson was hosting ‘The Tonight Show.’ So really, I just keep my head down and make sure the jokes are funny.”\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\t“I have great writers,” he added. “And we’re just trying to make the best show we possibly can and entertain everybody.”\n</p>\n<p>\n\tDiscussion surrounding politics on late-night TV has consumed the industry ever since <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/jimmy-kimmel/\">Jimmy Kimmel</a> was temporarily <a href=\"https://variety.com/2025/tv/news/nexstar-jimmy-kimmel-abc-charlie-kirk-1236522584/\" target=\"_blank\">pulled off the air</a> for his commentary on the <a href=\"https://variety.com/2025/politics/news/charlie-kirk-dead-shot-1236514498/\" target=\"_blank\">death of conservative activist Charlie Kirk.</a></p>\n<p>\n\tABC, which has hosted Kimmel for 24 seasons, sidelined “Jimmy Kimmel Live!” after Nexstar Media and Sinclair, two major U.S. TV station owners, vowed to preempt the late-night program after Kimmel said in his Sept. 15 monologue that the “MAGA gang” was trying to build political momentum off Kirk’s murder.</p>\n<p>\n\tThe announcements came shortly after FCC chair Brendan Carr <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/2025/tv/news/brendan-carr-abc-fcc-jimmy-kimmel-charlie-kirk-1236522406/\">seemed to suggest</a> that broadcasters should take action against Kimmel for his comments on Kirk. He said on Benny Johnson’s podcast, “We can do this the easy way or the hard way. These companies can find ways to change conduct and take action, frankly, on Kimmel or there’s going to be additional work for the FCC ahead.”\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\tABC put Kimmel back on the air Sept. 22, and <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/2025/tv/news/jimmy-kimmel-fully-back-abc-tv-nexstar-sinclair-1236530517/\">Nexstar</a> and <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/2025/tv/news/sinclair-resumes-jimmy-kimmel-live-abc-stations-1236530166/\">Sinclair</a> did the same days later. After Kimmel’s return, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/donald-trump/\">Donald Trump</a> took to <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/2025/tv/news/trump-disney-abc-jimmy-kimmel-return-bunch-of-losers-1236526488/\">Truth Social to sound off</a> on the late-night show.</p>\n<p>\n\t“Why would they want someone back who does so poorly, who’s not funny, and who puts the Network in jeopardy by playing 99% positive Democrat GARBAGE,” he wrote. “He is yet another arm of the DNC and, to the best of my knowledge, that would be a major Illegal Campaign Contribution. I think we’re going to test ABC out on this. Let’s see how we do. Last time I went after them, they gave me $16 Million Dollars. This one sounds even more lucrative. A true bunch of losers! Let Jimmy Kimmel rot in his bad Ratings.”</p>\n</div>"

Combs’ counsel argued that his recordings of sex acts with male escorts were technically amateur pornography, which they said was protected under the First Amendment. They also claimed that he deserved a new trial because his RICO and sex trafficking counts should not have been joined together with his Mann Act counts, which they say prejudiced the jury against him on the latter charges.\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\tIn his ruling, Subramanian stated that Combs failed to carry his “heavy burden” of showing spillover prejudice to the jury, as he was found not guilty of the more serious RICO and sex trafficking charges. “The government proved its case many times over,” wrote Subramanian. “That by itself might be enough to dispose of Combs’s challenge. […] Had the prejudice indeed been so great, one would expect a jury to convict on the most relevant counts before it could spill over and infect the others. A new trial is not warranted.”\n</p>\n<p>\n\tOn Monday evening, prosecutors filed a 164-page memorandum that recommended no less than 11 years of imprisonment, claiming that he is “unrepentant” and that “the punishment for his crimes of conviction must take into account the manner in which he committed them.” The government previously suggested that he serve a sentence of four to five years.</p>\n<p>\n\tLast week, Combs’ attorneys argued that he should serve no more than 14 months in prison, claiming that he’d been punished enough. Along with the filing, Combs’ former girlfriend Yung Miami and producer Dallas Austin submitted letters of support, as did inmates who had taken Combs’ “Free Game” course.\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\tCombs was found guilty in July on two counts of transportation for prostitution, but dodged more serious charges of sex trafficking and racketeering. He faces up to 20 years in prison.</p>\n</div>"

    "body": "<div><p>\n\t<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/alex-honnold/\">Alex Honnold</a>, the rock climber known for his daring “<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/free-solo/\">free solo</a>” feats of ascending cliffs without the help of any ropes or safety equipment, has set his sights on a new challenge: Taiwan’s Taipei 101 skyscraper. And this time, he’ll be doing it live on <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/netflix/\">Netflix</a>.</p>\n<p>\n\t“<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/skyscraper-live/\">Skyscraper Live</a>,” a 2-hour special set to take place some time in early 2026, will follow Honnold as he attempts to free solo the Taipei 101, a 101-story skyscraper that is the 11th tallest building in the world (and the tallest in Taiwan) at 1,667 feet. \n\t</p>\n<p>\n\tBrandon Riegg, the VP of nonfiction series and sports at Netflix, bills it as the streamer’s “latest global must-watch live event… Watching Alex Honnold free climb Taipei 101 will be an adrenaline inducing spectacle that you can’t look away from,” he said. “Everyone will be talking about it as it happens.”\n</p>\n<p>\n\tPlimsoll Prods. Limited, a part of ITV Studios, is producing the special. The company has previously documented Honnold’s feats via the series “The Devil’s Climb” and “Arctic Ascent With Alex Honnold,” both for Disney+ and National Geographic. Plimsoll has also been behind live specials including “Earth Live” and “Yellowstone Live,” both for Nat Geo.</p>\n<p>\n\tEarlier this month, Honnold was spotted in Taipei conducting a practice climb of the Taipei 101, as <a href=\"https://news.tvbs.com.tw/english/2987240\" target=\"_blank\">chronicled by TVBS News</a>: “Using specialized climbing gear including clips and ropes, Honnold executed a spectacular free climb of the 508-meter tower, showcasing his extraordinary technical prowess and fearless approach,” the outlet wrote in a report translated into English. </p>\n<p>\n\t“The daring ascent transformed downtown Taipei into an impromptu amphitheater as crowds gathered to witness this unprecedented climbing feat,” the report added. “Taipei 101 management implemented rigorous safety protocols for the climb, with all procedures meticulously designed by professional teams and properly reported to relevant authorities. Honnold charmed building occupants during his ascent by spontaneously interacting with surprised onlookers through office windows, creating memorable moments throughout the tower.”\n\t</p>\n<figure><p>\n<iframe width=\"500\" height=\"375\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/RtGVXbYePk8?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\"></iframe>\n</p></figure>\n<p>\n\tWhat wasn’t revealed at the time, however, was how this was a prelude to the Netflix special early next year. Al Berman will serve as showrunner and executive producer of “Skyscraper Live,” whole Honnold, Grant Mansfield, James Smith, Alan Eyres and Jonathan Retseck are also EPs. Joe DeMaio is director.</p>\n<p>\n\tHonnold is one of the most famous climbers in the world thanks in part to “Free Solo,” the documentary that chronicled his climb of El Capitan’s 3,000-foot “Freerider” route in Yosemite National Park. That 2018 Nat Geo doc, directed by Chai Vasarhelyi and Jimmy Chin, won the Oscar for best documentary feature, as well as the BAFTA for best documentary feature and seven Emmys.</p>\n<p>\n\tOther notable free solo climbs by Honnold include Zion’s Moonlight Buttress, Yosemite’s Half Dome and the Yosemite “Triple Crown,” which he completed alone under 24 hours. Honnold is also an author, co-host of the podcasts “Climbing Gold” and “Planet Visionaries,” and founder of the nonprofit Honnold Foundation.</p>\n<div>\n<figure>\n<p><img srcset=\"https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Alex-Honnold-Taipei-101.jpg 3000w, https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Alex-Honnold-Taipei-101.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Alex-Honnold-Taipei-101.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Alex-Honnold-Taipei-101.jpg?resize=1920,1280 1920w, https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Alex-Honnold-Taipei-101.jpg?resize=1360,907 1360w, https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Alex-Honnold-Taipei-101.jpg?resize=1000,667 1000w, https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Alex-Honnold-Taipei-101.jpg?resize=910,607 910w, https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Alex-Honnold-Taipei-101.jpg?resize=681,454 681w, https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Alex-Honnold-Taipei-101.jpg?resize=450,300 450w, https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Alex-Honnold-Taipei-101.jpg?resize=250,167 250w\" src=\"https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Alex-Honnold-Taipei-101.jpg?w=1024\" alt=\"\" />\n\t</p>\n<figcaption>\n\t</figcaption>\n</figure>\n</div>\n<p>\n\tAt Netflix, besides series like “WWE Raw” and “Dinner Time Live With David Chang,” live events have included Paul vs. Tyson, “The Roast of Tom Brady,” “Jake vs. Tank,” Canelo vs. Crawford, Taylor vs. Serrano 3, and both the NFL Christmas Day on Netflix amd FIFA Women’s World Cup.</p>\n<p>\n\tPlimsoll has worked on projects with talent like David Attenborough, Pedro Pascal, Tom Hiddleston, Robin Roberts, Jeff Goldblum, Morgan Freeman and Sigourney Weaver.

    "body": "<div><p>\n\t<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/taylor-swift/\">Taylor Swift</a>, movie theater messiah? </p>\n<p>\n\tThe pop star is returning to cinemas with “The Official Release Party of a Showgirl,” which is tracking a debut of $35 million to $40 million over the weekend. Those projected ticket sales are significant considering “Showgirl” was <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/2025/music/news/taylor-swift-film-theaters-october-showgirl-1236524158/\">announced just two weeks ago</a> and is entering theaters with minimal promotion outside of Swift’s social media feeds. However, any box office boost might be short lived; “Release Party” is only slated to play screens for the weekend of Oct. 3 through 5.\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\t“The Official Release Party of a Showgirl” should earn Swift her second consecutive No. 1 box office debut following her prior theatrical release, 2023’s successful “Taylor Swift: The Eras Tour” ($93 million debut). This new venture isn’t a traditional movie, or a concert film like “The Eras Tour,” but instead an 89-minute event with a new music video and behind-the-scenes footage. The “release party” — for which Swift says dancing is “optional but very much encouraged” — coincides with the singer’s 12th studio album, “<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/the-life-of-a-showgirl/\">The Life of a Showgirl</a>,” which drops on Oct. 3. A self-proclaimed fan of numerology, Swift put tickets on sale for $12, which is above the average national price but way less than expensive than major cities like New York City or Los Angeles.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tSwift looks to take the box office crown over two movie stars. Dwayne “the Rock” Johnson’s sports drama “<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/the-smashing-machine/\">The Smashing Machine</a>” is aiming for $8 million to $15 million in its debut while Leonardo DiCaprio’s comedic action epic “One Battle After Another” is targeting $10 million to $11 million in its second weekend of release.\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\t“The Smashing Machine” marks a departure from the family-friendly fare that turned Johnson into a household name. In a rare dramatic performance, Johnson plays wrestler Mark Kerr, a champion in the early days of MMA fighting who made a career comeback after battling substance abuse. “The Smashing Machine,” which cost $50 million, is the solo directing debut of Benny Safdie, who is best known for collaborating with his older brother Josh on films like “Uncut Gems” and “Good Time.”</p>\n<p>\n\tMeanwhile, the industry will be closely watching the sophomore outing of “One Battle After Another,” which topped the box office last weekend but requires staying power — and lots of it — to justify its outsized budget. Glowing word-of-mouth and demand for Imax and other premium large format screens could help the film stick around in theaters. “One Battle After Another,” starring Leonardo DiCaprio as an ex-revolutionary on the run, has generated $24 million domestically and $53 million globally against a production budget above $130 million. Since ticket sales are typically split 50-50 between studios and theater operators, “One Battle After Another” requires roughly $300 million to break even theatrically.</p>\n<p>\n\tElsewhere, Disney’s “Avatar: The Way of Water” re-release is targeting $3 million to $4 million from 2,100 theaters. The studio is bringing James Cameron’s $2 billion sequel back to the big screen ahead of the third installment, “Avatar: Fire and Ash,” which opens in December. Audiences will be treated to an exclusive clip of “Fire and Ash” after the screenings of “The Way of Water.” Pandora beckons!</p>\n</div>"

    "body": "<div><p>\n\tWhich night of <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/paul-mccartney/\">Paul McCartney</a>‘s 2025 tour was the <em>official </em>opening night — Friday, where he played an only recently announced gig at the Santa Barbara Bowl, or Monday, where he did what had long been announced as the first show, at the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/acrisure-arena/\">Acrisure Arena</a> in Palm Desert? That may seem like a small and unimportant distinction to the non-Macca-heads among us. But for anyone planning to attend his road show coming up, or just following it vicariously, there were good reasons to be curious about the differences between the two shows. (Which is, of course, why we did the vigorous journalistic duty of attending both; see our r<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/2025/music/concert-reviews/paul-mccartney-tour-santa-barbara-bowl-setlist-help-review-1236533062/\">eview of Friday night’s Santa Barbara gig here</a>.) It has to do with the geeky task of nailing down his setlist for the tour, yes, but more significantly, it has to do with nailing down his <em>stamina</em>.\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\tWhen we last saw McCartney doing a tour on these shores (playing SoFi Stadium, in this region), it was the first half of 2022, when he was still a wee lad of 79. And maybe we were amazed that he was pulling off epic, nearly three-hour shows at the time. Surely,  no one would begrudge him cutting that down now to the kind of set that befits mortal men who have to pace themselves at any age, let alone. But the answer was left unclear from the Santa Barbara show, where he performed for a more modest two hours — possibly due to the early residential curfew for that intimate outdoor venue, sure, but also maybe reflecting a new normal for McCartney shows. Which would be fine! No one who attended the coastal warm-up — which McCartney did say was the first night of the tour, after all, and not just a warm-up) would have told anyone it felt like anything less than a full meal. \n\t</p>\n<p>\n\tBut now that McCartney fans have the Palm Desert show under their belt, the paradigm for the remainder of the tour is clear: nothing but marathons ahead. He is relishing being able to perform like a long-distance runner each night, and we get to relish the rhapsody in that. He powered this gig all the way to the 2-hours-40-minute mark, never leaving the stage except for a brief encore break. Unlike similarly long Bruce Springsteen shows, a McCartney gig never feels like an act of athleticism;. We never see him sweat — literally or, least of all, figuratively, with his eternally jolly and jaunty stage presence. Yet, to be more than 60 years into a rock ‘n’ roll career and be doing an almost three-hour show where you sing and play about as robustly as you always have — and, swear to God, that’s what he’s doing right now — you’ve got to have a bit of the athlete’s spirit within you. Unless just being an inveterate people-pleaser produces the same result. </p>\n<p>\n\tMcCartney’s show in the desert began the same way the earlier one: with the delirious one-two punch of “Help!” and “Coming Up.” Those happen to be the only two numbers out of the show that he didn’t perform at SoFi three and a half years ago — so, yes, it is a continuation of the Got Back Tour, after some long breaks, and incorporating multitudinous surprises and obscurities is not part of the game. But after an opening like that, you’ve earned the right to do what you want with the rest of the show. And what McCartney and his band of 20-years-plus did with it was raucous and remarkable, even if we saw most of the song selections coming. Almost right from the start, he was reintroducing searing songs that he had apparently cut for time in Santa Barbara, like “Letting Go.” Seeing the show in S.B. and taking note of what got skipped, I had allowed myself to think silly thoughts like: “Well, maybe he is leaving out ‘Maybe I’m Amazed’ because it’s too demanding to sing anymore,” or “Maybe he’s gotten tired of doing his usual John tribute, with ‘Here Today,’ or the George salute, with ‘Something’.” Nope… all that stuff is getting a return airing in the full-length shows on this tour, after all. </p>\n<p>\n\tIt’s quite a survey of Wings over America, the Beatles buried under the roar of Shea Stadium, and a handful of more recent solo signposts along the way. As he had on the opening night, McCartney promised the faithful that they would hear “some old songs, some new songs and some in-between songs” — and in this instance, he explained that “new” actually meant “probably about 10 years old — that’s new-<em>ish</em>.” He was specifically referring here to the re-addition of “Come On to Me” (which is only eight years old… come on!). But it also applied to “Now and Then,” the recently completed “final” Beatles track that has its basis in a 1970s Lennon demo — lovely here, as played by Paul and his post-Fab comrades (even if it was difficult to focus on the music and not the manic AI time-warp video on the big screen).\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\tFriday’s Santa Barbara show had been billed as lacking some of the tour’s big production elements, but there were only a few obvious ones that required the Acrisure’s larger footprint. One was the giant platform at the front of the stage that rises high up in the air to allow McCartney do a couple of solo-acoustic songs (“Blackbird,” “Here Today”) while aloft… maybe born out of the idea that folks wouldn’t pay enough attention to the really, really quiet stuff unless the star was lording it over them from on high. They would’ve, but it’s still nice for the people in the loge seats to get to see him at eye level. The other big element not seen in the first show was the full pyro for “Live and Let Die,” with flames you could feel at both the front and rear of the stage, and bombs bursting in air, and some kind of fireworks effect overhead. After that barrage, which must’ve woken up several surrounding desert bedroom communities, Paul stuck his fingers in his ears and scornfully said what the audience was thinking: “Too loud.” (Obviously, it will be just as explosive at the next stop.)</p>\n<p>\n\tOtherwise, the special effects were not that elaborate, unless you count McCartney’s “magic piano” (one of two he had on stage) and an equally Haight-Asbury-looking electric guitar he played to match. The fireworks, as they say, were mostly in the band’s performances. Abe Laboriel Jr. puts more muscularity into all these songs than you ever could have imagined them carrying, back in their original arrangements; he deserves the title of “basher” almost as much as Keith Moon, but somehow, it’s never so over-the-top that it threatens to overpower the man in front — that’s a wonderful feat. Keyboardist Paul “Wix” Wickens, the longest-standing (circa ’90s) member of this crew, gets a swell organ solo almost right out of the gate that brings home the soul of “Let Me Roll It,” though I’m not sure he ever has a bigger audience moment than when he just plays the doorbell intro of “Let ‘Em In.” </p>\n<div>\n<figure>\n<p><img srcset=\"https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Acrisure_PaulMcCartney_TaraHoward-22.jpg 2484w, https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Acrisure_PaulMcCartney_TaraHoward-22.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Acrisure_PaulMcCartney_TaraHoward-22.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Acrisure_PaulMcCartney_TaraHoward-22.jpg?resize=1920,1280 1920w, https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Acrisure_PaulMcCartney_TaraHoward-22.jpg?resize=1360,907 1360w, https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Acrisure_PaulMcCartney_TaraHoward-22.jpg?resize=1000,667 1000w, https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Acrisure_PaulMcCartney_TaraHoward-22.jpg?resize=910,607 910w, https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Acrisure_PaulMcCartney_TaraHoward-22.jpg?resize=681,454 681w, https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Acrisure_PaulMcCartney_TaraHoward-22.jpg?resize=450,300 450w, https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Acrisure_PaulMcCartney_TaraHoward-22.jpg?resize=250,167 250w\" src=\"https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Acrisure_PaulMcCartney_TaraHoward-22.jpg?w=1024\" alt=\"\" />\n\t</p>\n<figcaption>\n\t\t\t\t\t<span>Paul McCartney performs at Acrisure Arena on September 29, 2025</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tTara Howard\n\t</figcaption>\n</figure>\n</div>\n<p>\n\tRusty Anderson never sleeps, getting by far the most impressive guitar solos of the night, though he has some competition in that space from alternating bassist/guitarist Brian Ray and from McCartney himself. It was appropriate that “Letting Go” was reintroduced into the set for Palm Desert after being let go for a night in Santa Barbara: It features no less than three terrific guitar solos from Ray, a Palm Springs resident getting to play a hometown show, for once. But when it comes time to pay homage to Jimi Hendrix with the instrumental excerpt of “Foxy Lady” that is traditionally appended to “Let Me Roll It,” only McCartney himself would have the chutzpah to step into those shoes, so it’s the man himself doing the soloing there. Of course, when all three of them team up for the round-robin soloing on the climactic “The End,” it’s a quick bit of manna from jam-band heaven.\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\tWith Wings nostalgia in the air — a greatest-hits album and book this fall; a documentary next year — it’s ironic, in a way, to think that McCartney has had for almost 25 years the solid band that eluded him during the decade of Wings. All he had to do was give up the idea of a group that would be anything other than a traditional backup band, yet give them just enough leash each night that they all seem to have having the time of their lives a quarter-century in.</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd is Paul himself really having a grand time? I don’t think you sing with as many delightful vocal flourishes as McCartney does over the course of almost three hours if on any level you’re phoning it in, however many successive years he’s been performing some of these selections now. He could be saving his voice for hour 3, or night 3, or the tour finale, but there’s very little sense of that as he consistently delivers above and beyond the basic level that he could (and, some vocal coach might argue, should) be putting out at this stage in his career. In Palm Springs, he sounded more solid from the outset than he did in Santa Barbara (though it didn’t take him long to get there at the earlier show). Maybe it’s illusory, but he sounds better now than he did on the 2023 tour. Of course, that could be a function of it being early in; as McCartney told the audience at the start, “it’s the second night of the tour, so we’re young and fresh and restless.” But he’s doing shorter bursts of touring now anyhow, so there is every reason to imagine that whatever he’s doing to sound this strong will be maintained. Honestly: when it comes to Paul McCartney still <em>sounding like Paul McCartney</em>, prepare to be delighted.</p>\n<div>\n<figure>\n<p><img srcset=\"https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Acrisure_PaulMcCartney_TaraHoward-5.jpg 1275w, https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Acrisure_PaulMcCartney_TaraHoward-5.jpg?resize=100,150 100w, https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Acrisure_PaulMcCartney_TaraHoward-5.jpg?resize=200,300 200w\" src=\"https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Acrisure_PaulMcCartney_TaraHoward-5.jpg?w=682\" alt=\"\" />\n\t</p>\n<figcaption>\n\t\t\t\t\t<span>Paul McCartney performs at Acrisure Arena on September 29, 2025</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tTara Howard\n\t</figcaption>\n</figure>\n</div>\n<p>\n\tWhat marks a show of his is the combination of jocularity and generosity. It’s easy for some to underrate him because of his mirthful spirit on stage. But the more the years have advanced, the more I’ve come to appreciate McCartney as a man not just of “silly love songs” but of silly hand gestures. Now, as always, you see him standing up behind the piano between songs and think: What <em>does</em> he think he’s pantomiming? </p>\n<p>\n\tBut, of course, there’s a seriousness of crowd-satisfying intent beneath that casual good humor. He’s not one to make grand pronouncements, the way an equally epic-performance-loving Bruce Springsteen might, about playing each show as if it were your last. But he does each show as if it were the audience’s <em>first</em>. For a majority of attendees, it will be. For those of us with a lot more privilege in having attending his shows (one fellow held up a sign registering the number of gigs he’d attended at “138,” and McCartney responded, “It’s a bit obsessive, but I like it”),  it’s not a big stretch for it to feel like the first time. \n\t</p>\n<p>\n\tSo when he sang “Why Don’t We Do It in the Road?” back in the Beatles’ day, and we thought it was something dirty, it never occurred to us that maybe what he was really aspiring to was: <em>running a marathon</em>. In his career, and, better yet, now, every night.</p>\n<div>\n<figure>\n<p><img srcset=\"https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/6A03C88F-EC2B-4A4B-ADE5-1D61C72AE283.jpg 4096w, https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/6A03C88F-EC2B-4A4B-ADE5-1D61C72AE283.jpg?resize=150,127 150w, https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/6A03C88F-EC2B-4A4B-ADE5-1D61C72AE283.jpg?resize=300,255 300w\" src=\"https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/6A03C88F-EC2B-4A4B-ADE5-1D61C72AE283.jpg?w=1024\" alt=\"\" />\n\t</p>\n<figcaption>\n\t\t\t\t\t<span>Paul McCartney at Acrisure Arena</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tChris Willman/Variety\n\t</figcaption>\n</figure>\n</div>\n<p>\n\t<strong>Setlist for Paul McCartney at the Acrisure Arena, Palm Desert, Sept. 29, 2025:</strong></p>\n<p>\n\tHelp!<br />Coming Up<br />Got to Get You Into My Life<br />Letting Go<br />Drive My Car<br />Come On to Me<br />Let Me Roll It/Foxy Lady<br />Getting Better<br />Let ‘Em In<br />My Valentine<br />Nineteen Hundred and Eighty-Five<br />Maybe I’m Amazed<br />I’ve Just Seen a Face<br />In Spite of All the Danger<br />Love Me Do<br />Dance Tonight<br />Blackbird<br />Here Today<br />Now and Then<br />Lady Madonna<br />Jet<br />Being for the Benefit of Mr. Kite<br />Something<br />Ob-La-Di, Ob-La-Da<br />Band on the Run<br />Get Back<br />Let It Be<br />Live and Let Die<br />Hey Jude</p>\n<p>\n\tEncore:<br />I’ve Got a Feeling<br />Sgt.

The pilot will star <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/zach-galifianakis/\">Zach Galifianakis</a> (“The Hangover,” FX’s “Baskets”), Dolly Wells (“Doll & Em,” “Inside Man”), and Spencer House (“Tell Me Lies,” “The Society”) as well as Nikki Crawford (Broadway’s “Fat Ham,” “Cruel Intentions”) and <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/kumail-nanjiani/\">Kumail Nanjiani</a> (“Silicon Valley,” “The Big Sick’). As previously reported, Cary Elwes (“Robin Hood: Men in Tights,” “The Princess Bride”) will also star.\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\tExact plot details are being kept under wraps, aside from the fact that the pilot is inspired by the Mel Brooks-Gene Wilder film “Young Frankenstein.” Character details are likewise under wraps, but sources say that Galifianakis will play Dr. Frankenstein. It was also previously reported that Elwes would play the President of the United States. Should the show get picked up to series, it would air on Hulu. \n</p>\n<p>\n\t“Very Young Frankenstein” hails from writer Stefani Robinson, who also executive produces along with Taika Waititi and Garrett Basch. All three are alums of the hit FX comedy series “What We Do in the Shadows.” Waititi will also direct the pilot. Brooks, who co-wrote and directed the film, will executive produce, as will Kevin Salter and Michael Gruskoff. Salter is Brooks’ producing partner, while Gruskoff produced the original film. 20th Television is the studio. </p>\n<p>\n\tGalifianakis is repped by UTA, Brillstein Entertainment Partners, and Yorn, Levine, Barnes. Nanjiani is repped by Mosaic, UTA, and Origin PR. Crawford is repped by Artists & Representatives and The Zachary Co. House is repped by Gersh. Wells is repped by UTA in the U.S., Independent in the U.K., and manager Heather Nunn. Elwes is repped by IAG, Link Entertainment, attorney Lev Ginsburg and Hamilton Hodell in the U.K.\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\t“Young Frankenstein” premiered in 1974 to love from both critics and audiences. It is widely cited as one of the funniest American films ever made. Wilder starred as Dr. Frederick Frankenstein (or Fronk-en-steen), the grandson of Victor Frankenstein. When he inherits his grandfather’s estate in Transylvania, Frederick finds himself drawn to continuing his predecessor’s work in reanimating the dead. </p>\n<p>\n\tThe cast also included Cloris Leachman, Marty Feldman, Teri Garr, Madeline Kahn, Peter Boyle, and Kenneth Mars. Gene Hackman also makes a brief appearance in the film as a blind man who encounters Frankenstein’s monster. </p>\n</div>"
