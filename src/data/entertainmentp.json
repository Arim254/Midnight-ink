    "body": "<div><p>\n\t“<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/steal-away/\">Steal Away</a>” starts with intertitles that announce it as a tale of “two princesses.” The implied fairy tale trappings are appropriate for this metaphor heavy film. Director <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/clement-virgo/\">Clement Virgo</a> adapts, with Tamara Faith Berger, the nonfiction novel “Steal Away Home” by Karolyn Smardz Frost. The book explored the relationship between an escaped slave and her mistress, whom she met when they were both young girls. Virgo’s film takes that premise and reimagines it as a twisty psychological allegory, laden with weighty themes. But “Steal Away” proves more rewarding to decipher afterward than to sit through.\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\tWithout establishing time or geographic setting, the film follows Cecile (Mallori Johnson), a young woman from the Congo who flees war in her home country and arrives as a refugee taken in by a white family who live in a strange big mansion. There she becomes the companion of Fanny (<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/angourie-rice/\">Angourie Rice</a>), a girl her age who appears extremely naive in contrast. Cecile is worldly and has seen her share of sorrow, while Fanny has been cloistered in this elaborate old castle under the watchful eye of an over-protective mother and eccentric grandmother. The differences between Cecile and Fanny, in race and in maturity, become the reason they are both fascinated and repelled by each other. \n</p>\n<p>\n\tAs Fanny starts imitating Cecile — wearing her clothes, picking up her mannerisms — the film recalls movies of double personalities like “Persona” or even the more schlocky “Single White Female” — only here with added racial undertones. When Fanny wears Cecile’s Afro futuristic costumes, the themes explored encompass cultural appropriation. The film wisely lets the audience take in these topics and does not push into them with obvious dialogue. \n\t</p>\n<p>\n\tBut “Steal Away” never builds a true psychological conflict between its two leads. Cecile starts a steamy relationship with the mansion’s gardener’s son (Idrissa Sanogo Bamba) whom Fanny had eyes for. So all these considerable themes the film was trying to explore end up adding up to little more than a rudimentary sexual jealousy plot.</p>\n<p>\n\tThere are other more successful elements in the world-building of this fantasy land, which bears resemblance to several historical realities. The film could be argued as being set in a small European country in the mid 20th century, or in the contemporary American South, or even a futuristic yet unknown place. The political, social and racial mores of this place are in tandem with the current migration crisis attitudes in North America and Europe. There are visual motives and African costumes that hint at themes of colonization and cultural appropriation.</p>\n<p>\n\tHowever, hinting is all that “Steal Away” does. It remains elusive, never confronting any of these themes head on. There is a difference between trying to start a conversation by not stating the obvious and staying so opaque that a dialogue never even starts. “Steal Away” leans towards the latter. Johnson has an earthy screen presence that contrasts well with Rice’s ice princess ingenue. The actors are able to bring life to the abstract dialogue while building believable tension and affection between their characters. Johnson’s character has more to do, thus she remains intriguing throughout; Fanny is not given much of an arc, so Rice has to keep repeating the same notes. </p>\n<p>\n\tIn the end,<em> “</em>Steal Away” feels incomplete: an assemblage of evocative ideas and images that never cohere to a resonant dramatic narrative. Virgo and Berger gesture at their themes rather than fully exploring them. Perhaps most egregiously, they give up in the end and fully explain the film’s metaphorical mystery. It’s unforgivable for a film whose most ambitious element to that point was keeping the audience guessing. Still a mood lingers, one of dislocation and unease. “Steal Away” occupies a peculiar place: too elusive to satisfy as narrative, too suggestive to dismiss as mere ornament — and ultimately too obvious to take seriously as an exploration of the tumultuous political and socioeconomic present.</p>\n</div>"

Disney said in a statement Monday, “Last Wednesday, we made the decision to suspend production on the show to avoid further inflaming a tense situation at an emotional moment for our country.

Terms of the agreement are still unclear, including whether Kimmel will have to apologize for his comments on Kirk.</p>\n<p>\n\tSinclair vowed last week to run a special news report on Charlie Kirk during Kimmel’s slot last week instead of the replacement programming ABC planned to air. But the company ended up moving the special to its streaming platform, and sticking with an ABC game show.</p>\n</div>"

    "body": "<div><p>\n\tA vivid portrait of a legendary kabuki actor over the course of his career, “<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/kokuho/\">Kokuho</a>” joins a rich tradition of films that depict the personal cost of making art. Too often, such stories present an overly simplified version of the given artform’s rigors and qualities, diluting any undergirding sense of what drives the characters to put themselves through the ringer. By contrast, Japanese director <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/lee-sang-il/\">Lee Sang-il</a>’s surprise hit “Kokuho” spends a great deal of its lengthy runtime capturing the beautiful physicality and anguished storylines around which the performances revolve, mirroring the many struggles and complicated triumphs of its central protagonist’s existence.\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\tThe title “Kokuho” translates to “national treasure,” a title bestowed by the Japanese government upon high masters of an art or craft. Its director, Lee, is best known for his films “Hula Girls” (2006) and “Unforgiven,” a 2013 remake of the Clint Eastwood movie, starring Ken Watanabe. “Kokuho” has become a veritable phenomenon in Japan, where it has earned nearly $100 million since opening in June, shortly after it premiered in Directors’ Fortnight at Cannes. The film was subsequently picked to represent Japan at the Oscars.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tAfter Kikuo (played by Ryo Yoshizawa as an adult and Ryusei Yokohama as a child) — the 14-year-old son of a yakuza leader in 1964 Nagasaki — witnesses the death of his father, he moves to Osaka to begin studying as an apprentice to Hanjiro (Ken Watanabe), widely considered the best kabuki actor in the city. There, he forms a bond with the performer’s son, Shunsuke (Ryusei Yokohama), who only possesses a modicum of passion compared to the intense drive and natural ability to inhabit the role of an onnagata (a man playing a woman’s role in traditional kabuki), beginning a friendship and rivalry that will last for many years.\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\tAt nearly three hours, “Kokuho” takes its time in covering the events of 50 years — ending, after its longest of many time jumps, in 2014 — but it remains engaging throughout, in no small part because of its ambivalent perspective toward its protagonist. As viewed by Lee and screenwriter Satoko Okudera (who adapted the novel by Shuichi Yoshida, whose work inspired Lee’s 2010 film “Villain”), Kikuo is deliberately something of a cipher, clearly a performer who takes great pride in his work but whose sense of self and his ability to relate to others is often murky. As becomes clear through the course of the film, kabuki puts high importance on family lineage. Shunsuke is the heir to the House of Tanban-ya to which Hanjiro belongs. Despite his gift, Kikuo must resort to questionable tactics to maintain his standing in the insular community.</p>\n<p>\n\tWhen Ryo Yoshizawa takes over the role of Kikuo approximately 40 minutes in, this aspect of his character becomes even more paramount to the essential mystery of “Kokuho.” When not in the heavy stage makeup that blurs the lines between Kikuo and Shunsuke, there is a slight coldness to his affect, especially compared to Yokohama’s more extroverted performance, which constantly calls into question the sincerity of his sentiments. Though other characters bear the extreme strain of kabuki training and performance much more harshly, the 31-year-old actor appears oddly alien as he ages, a man who never fit into the preestablished traditions of his artform who nevertheless achieves success.</p>\n<p>\n\tIn many ways, Kikuo acts as an embodiment of his art’s place in post-war Japan. Though the film makes little mention of the world outside kabuki — save for Kikuo’s mention that the “A-bomb disease” killed most of his family — it subtly forms a portrait of the changing times, signaled primarily by costume and production design. Kabuki never loses its popularity in the film, similar to its continued place of honor in real life, but there’s a great tension between its 17th-century roots and the machinations of the 20th century, reflected most prominently in the Mitsutomo Corporation’s heavy sponsorship of the House of Tanban-ya. After all, it is an elaborate production, which must be bankrolled through distinctly modern means.\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\tTo bring all this to life, Lee Sang-il relies heavily on both tight closeups and widescreen long shots that work in tandem to capture the physicality of the many performances. Cinematographer Sofian El Fani (“Blue Is the Warmest Color”)’s bright colors render Yohei Taneda’s art direction and Kumiko Ogawa’s costumes with the appropriate vibrancy. But perhaps the most fascinating touch of all comes courtesy of chyrons that appear when a new kabuki play is introduced. In the American release of “Kokuho,” the Japanese name of the play appears, along with its English translation and a brief description of the play’s narrative. Though performances are not presented in their entirety, this approach offers Western audiences a fuller understanding of the often tragic nature of these tales of unrequited love and death, plus a deeper appreciation of kabuki’s legacy.</p>\n</div>"

    "body": "<div><p>\n\t<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/dave-bautista/\">Dave Bautista</a> recently <a href=\"https://collider.com/dave-bautista-afterburn-jj-perry-highlander-the-killers-game/\" target=\"_blank\">told Collider </a>that he’s no longer going to work with assholes because it’s “absolutely awful,” and he’s fortunately hit a threshold in his acting career where he can be choosier about the projects he takes on and the actors who become his co-stars.</p>\n<p>\n\t“I’m just at the age and at the point of my life where life’s just too goddamn short,” Bautista said. “I want to work with people I just love and respect, because I love this business. I love filmmaking, and if people don’t want to be there, I don’t want to be there with them. You know?”\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\t“I’m <em>happy </em>to be there. It’s a love thing for me, and I’m passionate about it,” Bautista added. “I want to be there, and I want to make the most of it, so I don’t want to hear people bitching, complaining, moaning, and groaning about doing something that we’re all fortunate enough to be doing and making.”\n</p>\n<p>\n\tBautista has long been candid about his desire to diversify his acting filmography and branch out far beyond his breakthrough role as Drax the Destroyer in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, including James Gunn’s “Guardians of the Galaxy” trilogy. He’s even lost weight to gain access to a larger pool of acting roles.</p>\n<p>\n\t“I started trimming down because I got really big for a role. Uncomfortably big,” Bautista <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/2024/film/news/dave-bautista-weight-loss-acting-career-1236142514/\">said last year</a>. “For ‘Knock at the Cabin’ I got really big. I was around 315 pounds…I put the weight on really fast and I put on an uncomfortable amount of weight and it took forever to shed it out.”</p>\n<p>\n\t“The more I trimmed down the better I looked on camera and the better I looked next to other actors,” he explained. “I’m still a large human being. At 6’4 and 240 pounds next to your typical actor, I look like a gorilla and it’s distracting. I’ll probably lose a few more pounds. I’m just killing myself to be this trim. I’m training hard.”\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\tBautista told <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.gq.com/story/gq-hype-dave-bautista\">GQ magazine</a> around the same time that “I just want to be a good fucking actor. A respected actor.” For this reason, he’s always cherished his collaborations with Denis Villeneuve, such as “Blade Runner 2049” and the “<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/dune/\">Dune</a>” films. </p>\n<p>\n\t“I’ve never had a director until Denis, since Denis, say to me that you’re a very strong actor,” Bautista told <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://gizmodo.com/dave-bautista-dune-2-character-wwe-marvel-drax-scifi-1851287353\">Gizmodo</a> last year. “And he said this to me on the first film. I was holding back because I was self-conscious [and] I was. I was very unsure of myself. And he came to me. He said, ‘I feel like you’re holding back. You’re a very strong actor, my friend. Just follow your instincts.’ And so I started belting it out, and I started finding this character. He not only loved it so much, but he was so supportive of my performance that he wanted to capture other people’s reactions to my performance. And so when you’re getting that kind of support, that was an experience I’ve never had before or since, with a director of that caliber. So it means everything. It’s validation.”</p>\n<p>\n\tBautista currently stars in “Afterburn,” now playing in theaters. His upcoming credits include the action thriller “Trap House,” the indie science-fiction movie “Alpha Gang” and a voice role in “The Legend of Aang: The Last Airbender.”<br /></p>\n</div>"

The network is allowing the producers to shop the series elsewhere, and MTV will continue to air episodes from the “Catfish” library.</p>\n<p>\n\tHosted by Nev Schulman, “Catfish” helped people discover the truth about their suspicious digital romances — and sometimes come to terms with the person on the other side of the computer screen. The series is based on Schulman’s 2010 documentary of the same name, which coined the term “catfish” for someone who uses a false identity or stolen photos to deceive others on the internet.\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\tDeveloped by Schulman, Ariel Schulman and Max Joseph, “Catfish: The TV Show” debuted in 2012 on MTV and ended with Season 9 in July 2024. Nev Schulman and Joseph co-hosted the show for its first seven seasons. In 2018, Joseph was replaced by a rotating list of presenters, including Elle King, Nick Young and Machine Gun Kelly. Eventually, Kamie Crawford joined as a permanent host, joining Schulman for 96 episodes.\n</p>\n<p>\n\t“Catfish” not only gave a name to the phenomenon of digital deception. The series also spawned international spinoffs in Colombia, Chile, Brazil, Mexico and the United Kingdom. Its legacy continues on-screen: a recent episode of “The Paper” centered on an employee being catfished by someone impersonating a celebrity, and the current No. 1 documentary on Netflix is titled “Unknown Number: The High School Catfish.”</p>\n<p>\n\tSince the end of Season 9, the status of “Catfish: The TV Show” was up in the air, as it had not received a renewal or cancellation from MTV amid the restructuring of the Paramount merger. Last month, Schulman announced he had earned his real estate broker’s license and would be helping people buy and sell homes in New York. </p>\n</div>"

Come on! Wonderful news for my dear friend Jimmy and his amazing staff.” \n\t</p>\n<p>\n\tThen, Colbert grabbed the Emmy that he won last weekend for outstanding talk show: “I’m so happy for them, plus, now that Jimmy’s not being canceled, I get to enjoy this again!” Then he quipped: “Once more, I am the only martyr in late nights. Wait, unless, CBS, you want to announce anything?”\n</p>\n<div>\n<figure>\n<p><img srcset=\"https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/3112416_0020-e1758588635577.jpg 2000w, https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/3112416_0020-e1758588635577.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/3112416_0020-e1758588635577.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/3112416_0020-e1758588635577.jpg?resize=1920,1280 1920w, https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/3112416_0020-e1758588635577.jpg?resize=1360,907 1360w, https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/3112416_0020-e1758588635577.jpg?resize=1000,667 1000w, https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/3112416_0020-e1758588635577.jpg?resize=910,607 910w, https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/3112416_0020-e1758588635577.jpg?resize=681,454 681w, https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/3112416_0020-e1758588635577.jpg?resize=450,300 450w, https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/3112416_0020-e1758588635577.jpg?resize=250,167 250w\" src=\"https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/3112416_0020-e1758588635577.jpg?w=1024\" alt=\"\" />\n\t</p>\n<figcaption>\n\t\t\t\t\t<span>“The Late Show with Stephen Colbert” during Monday’s September 22, 2025 show.

In an unprecedented threat, Carr went on a far-right podcast to proclaim that the FCC had “remedies we can look at. We can do this the easy way or the hard way.”</p>\n<p>\n\tIn his Sept. 18 monologue, Colbert noted that “Shortly after Carr made his statements about ABC, Kimmel gets yanked off the air. This decision came after senior executives at ABC, Disney and affiliates convened emergency meetings during which multiple execs felt that Kimmel had not actually said anything over the line, but the threat of Trump administration retaliation loomed. As one source at ABC put it, they were pissing themselves all day. On the bright side, that proves Disney is No. 1 in streaming.”\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\tColbert continued in that Sept. 18 monologue, “Carr was quick to reassure everyone posting, ‘While this may be an unprecedented decision, it is important for broadcasters to push back on Disney programming that they determine falls short of community values.’ Well, you know what my community values are, buster? Freedom of speech.”</p>\n<p>\n\tDuring that episode “The Late Show” also parodied “Be Our Guest” from “Beauty and the Beast,” in which the character Lumiere sings for Disney employees to “shut your trap” and “the new rule at ABC don’t make fun of Donny T.” </p>\n<p>\n\tColbert also called the Kimmel decision “blatant censorship” and added “With an autocrat, you cannot give an inch… Jimmy, I stand with you and your staff 100%.”</p>\n<p>\n\tEarlier this summer, Kimmel had thrown his support behind Colbert after CBS announced it would cancel “The Late Show” and end that talker’s run in May 2026. “Jimmy Kimmel Live!” even put up Emmy For Your Consideration billboards throwing Kimmel’s support behind Colbert. And it worked: Colbert won the outstanding talk series Emmy at this year’s ceremony.</p>\n<p>\n\tWhen Colbert’s show was canceled, it was also seen as a means by Paramount Global to curry favor with the FCC as it needed the agency’s approval to be acquired by Skydance. Both Paramount and Skydance denied that speculation, but the timing of the news still left many curious about how Colbert’s cancellation was handled.</p>\n<p>\n\tKimmel <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/2025/tv/awards/jimmy-kimmel-defends-colbert-late-night-tv-not-dying-1236479160/\">later told <em>Variety</em></a><em>: </em>“I think we were all shocked and disappointed that this kind of thing is happening in America, and also disappointed that we don’t see more people on the right stepping up and saying, ‘Hey, this is no good.’ Silencing comedians, commentators, whatever you want to call people… I have to say, if Joe Biden had used his muscle to get Sean Hannity kicked off the air, you may be surprised to learn that I would not support that. I would, in fact, support Sean Hannity in that situation, because I thought one of the founding principles of this country was free speech. But people don’t seem to care about protecting it unless you agree with them.”</p>\n</div>"

    "body": "<div><p>\n\t<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/jimmy-kimmel/\">Jimmy Kimmel</a>’s return to his talk show on Tuesday night promises to be one of the most massive television moments of the decade. </p>\n<p>\n\tAnd based on past performance, Kimmel is up to the challenge.</p>\n<p>\n\tIn bringing down the temperature around his show — a show that became the object of conservative ire and FCC threats after a series of jokes last week pertaining to the aftermath of the assassination of Charlie Kirk — Kimmel will need to demonstrate some sensitivity. In reasserting himself as a comedian with the right to speak his mind without reprisal from the government, he will need to keep his signature bite. And through it all, he will have to be funny.\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\tConsider, for instance, his broadcasts after the birth of his son Billy, in 2017. Billy was born with a congenital heart defect that required surgery; Kimmel’s discussing the personal matter, and his larger takeaways about this country’s healthcare system, positioned him as a potential heir to David Letterman, that previous master of using storytelling and vulnerability to bring the audience into his world. \n</p>\n<p>\n\tBack then, Kimmel’s approach to politics was that of someone who’d rather not have to be discussing it — who had been thrust into a new understanding of problems many Americans face by circumstance, and was trying to make sense of it. This is an appealing and relatable posture, and one that might serve him well in discussing his moment at the center of a censorship controversy. Kimmel is not, at his core, a political comedian, which may help explain why the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/2025/tv/news/nexstar-jimmy-kimmel-abc-charlie-kirk-1236522584/\">jokes that got him in trouble did so</a>, since even his defenders can admit that the wording was garbled and easy to purposefully misinterpret. But politics comes for us all, and Kimmel’s self-presentation as a common-sense figure who’d been misread in the midst of a tense moment for the nation might go a long way toward bringing the show back sustainably.\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\tThis hiatus has been more intriguingly complicated than the canceling of Stephen Colbert’s “Late Show” for a few reasons — among them that Colbert is so plainly at home in the world of politics, and so upfront about where he positions himself, that thrumming under the coverage of his dismissal was the sense that perhaps this was bound to happen, sooner or later. Twenty or even 10 years ago, no one might have expected Kimmel to be the face of a political movement, but these are strange times. Kimmel’s unpolished approach to politics got him into trouble, but can, paradoxically, be a tool to get him back out. Some segment of the viewing public who might generally disapprove of perceived disrespect to the Kirk story might also be willing to give the benefit of the doubt to a host who does not present as a movement liberal and who speaks about politics a bit like any old person. </p>\n<p>\n\tWatching the stratospheric <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/2025/tv/columns/south-park-new-season-donald-trump-1236478231/\">success of “South Park”</a> this year has made clear that the comic entities best-positioned actually to land insights and humor about our current political situation are ones that speak the language of the president — that of crassness and of personal animus. For now, it would be wiser for Kimmel to put this particular tool away, but his plainspoken ability to connect remains extant. </p>\n<p>\n\tAfter all, Kimmel has massaged a complicated situation before, and made everyone feel comfortable enough. The stakes were (marginally) lower, but the 2017 Oscar broadcast — in which “La La Land” was falsely declared the winner of best picture, before a minutes-later reversal — required all the diplomacy and tact Kimmel, that year’s Oscar host, could muster. In the moment, I recall thinking that, if anything, Kimmel was being too magnanimous. (He suggested, musing aloud, that the award be declared a tie. No! “Moonlight” won!) But that capacity for magnanimity is what’s required now. </p>\n<p>\n\tMillions of potential viewers — if by no means on the night, but the next morning on YouTube — will tune in with interest to what Kimmel has to say. Some of them may have had absolutely no problem with what Kimmel said in the first place; others may have taken issue with his wording (or with how it was characterized to them by people with their own agendas) but have been concerned about the government’s overreach in pushing to get Kimmel sidelined. This is a moment to be frank and direct, but also funny. Kimmel’s final and most crucial strength may be in his willingness to needle his own bosses. His annual roasts of ABC’s programming at the network’s upfront are presented in an it’s-all-in-good-fun spirit, but this is still a man who’s not afraid to push back against his employer. The one thing that would utterly botch his return is if it felt forced or dutiful. Whatever compromise Kimmel manages to strike with ABC about his wording, the end result must feel like he remains his own man. Past precedent suggests that it will. </p>\n</div>"
