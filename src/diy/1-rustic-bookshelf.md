### Step 1: Prepare the Wood

Start by sanding all the wood planks until they are smooth to the touch. Wipe them clean and apply a coat of your favorite wood stain. Let it dry completely.

### Step 2: Assemble the Frame

Assemble the steel pipes to create the side supports for your bookshelf. This typically involves screwing together various lengths of pipe with elbow and tee fittings.

### Step 3: Attach the Shelves

Once the side supports are built, lay them on the floor and place your wood planks at the desired heights. Secure each plank to the pipe frame from underneath using wood screws.
